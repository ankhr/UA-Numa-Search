Afonso de Albuquerque

Afonso de Albuquerque, Duke of Goa (; 1453 – 16 December 1515) (also spelled Aphonso or Alfonso), was a Portuguese general, a "great conqueror", a statesman, and an empire builder.

Afonso advanced the three-fold Portuguese grand scheme of combating Islam, spreading Christianity, and securing the trade of spices by establishing a Portuguese Asian empire. Among his achievements, Afonso was the first European of his Renaissance to raid the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, and he led the first voyage by a European fleet into the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>. His military and administrative works are generally regarded as among the most vital to building and securing the <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese Empire</a> in the Orient, the Middle East, and the <a href="spice%20trade">spice routes</a> of eastern <a href="Oceania">Oceania</a>.

Afonso is generally considered a military genius, and "probably the greatest naval commander of the age" given his successful strategy—he attempted to close all the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> naval passages to the Atlantic, <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>, <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, and to the Pacific, transforming it into a Portuguese "<a href="mare%20clausum">mare clausum</a>" established over the opposition of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and its Muslim and Hindu allies. In the expansion of the <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese Empire</a>, Afonso initiated a rivalry that would become known as the <a href="Ottoman%E2%80%93Portuguese%20conflicts">Ottoman–Portuguese</a> war, which would endure for many years. Many of the Ottoman–Portuguese conflicts in which he was directly involved took place in the Indian Ocean, in the Persian Gulf regions for control of the trade routes, and on the coasts of India. It was his military brilliance in these initial campaigns against the much larger Ottoman Empire and its allies that enabled Portugal to become the first global empire in history. He had a record of engaging and defeating much larger armies and fleets. For example, his <a href="Capture%20of%20Ormuz%20%281507%29">capture of Ormuz in 1507</a> against the Persians was accomplished with a fleet of seven ships. Other famous battles and offensives which he led include the <a href="Portuguese%20Conquest%20of%20Goa%20%281510%29">conquest of Goa in 1510</a> and the <a href="Capture%20of%20Malacca%20%281511%29">capture of Malacca in 1511</a>. He became admiral of the Indian Ocean, and was appointed head of the "fleet of the Arabian and Persian sea" in 1506.

During the last five years of his life, he turned to administration, where his actions as the <a href="List%20of%20governors%20of%20Portuguese%20India">second governor</a> of <a href="Portuguese%20India">Portuguese India</a> were crucial to the longevity of the Portuguese Empire. He pioneered European sea trade with China during the <a href="Ming%20Dynasty">Ming Dynasty</a> with envoy <a href="Rafael%20Perestrello">Rafael Perestrello</a>, <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> with <a href="Duarte%20Fernandes">Duarte Fernandes</a> as envoy, and with <a href="Timor">Timor</a>, passing through Malaysia and Indonesia in a voyage headed by <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%20de%20Abreu">António de Abreu</a> and <a href="Francisco%20Serr%C3%A3o">Francisco Serrão</a>. He also aided diplomatic relations with <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> using priest envoys João Gomes and João Sanches, and established diplomatic ties with Persia, during the <a href="Safavid%20dynasty">Safavid dynasty</a>.

He became known as "the Great", "the Terrible", "the Caesar of the East", "the Lion of the Seas", and "the Portuguese Mars".

Afonso de Albuquerque was born in 1453 in <a href="Vila%20Franca%20de%20Xira">Alhandra</a>, near <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>. He was the second son of Gonçalo de Albuquerque, Lord of Vila Verde dos Francos, and Dona Leonor de Menezes. His father held an important position at court and was connected by remote illegitimate descent with the Portuguese monarchy. He was educated in mathematics and Latin at the court of <a href="Afonso%20V%20of%20Portugal">Afonso V of Portugal</a>, where he befriended Prince John, the future King <a href="John%20II%20of%20Portugal">John II of Portugal</a>.

Afonso’s early training is described by Diogo Barbosa Machado:
"“D. Alfonso de Albuquerque, surnamed the Great, by reason of the heroic deeds wherewith he filled Europe with admiration, and Asia with fear and trembling, was born in the year 1453, in the Estate called, for the loveliness of its situation, the Paradise of the Town of Alhandra, six leagues distant from Lisbon. He was the second son of Gonçalo de Albuquerque, Lord of Villaverde, and of D. Leonor de Menezes, daughter of D. Álvaro Gonçalves de Athayde, Count of Atouguia, and of his wife D. Guiomar de Castro, and corrected this injustice of nature by climbing to the summit of every virtue, both political and moral. He was educated in the Palace of the King D. Afonso V, in whose palaestra he strove emulously to become the rival of that African Mars”.

Afonso served 10 years in North Africa, where he gained military experience in fierce campaigns against Muslim powers and Ottoman Turks.

In 1471, under the command of <a href="Afonso%20V%20of%20Portugal">Afonso V of Portugal</a>, he was present at the conquest of <a href="Tangier">Tangier</a> and <a href="Conquest%20of%20Asilah">Arzila</a> in <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, serving there as an officer for some years. In 1476 he accompanied <a href="John%20II%20of%20Portugal">Prince John</a> in wars against Castile, including the <a href="Battle%20of%20Toro">Battle of Toro</a>. He participated in the campaign on the Italian peninsula in 1480 to rescue <a href="Ferdinand%20II%20of%20Aragon">Ferdinand II of Aragon</a> from the <a href="Ottoman%20invasion%20of%20Otranto">Ottoman invasion of Otranto</a> that ended in victory. On his return in 1481, when Prince John was crowned as King John II, Afonso was made <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Horse">Master of the Horse</a> for his distinguished exploits, chief <a href="equerry">equerry</a> ("estribeiro-mor") to the King, a post which he held throughout John's reign (1481–95). In 1489 he returned to military campaigns in North Africa, as commander of defense in the <a href="Graciosa%20fortress">Graciosa fortress</a>, an island in the river Luco near the city of <a href="Larache">Larache</a>, and in 1490 was part of the guard of King John II, returning to Arzila in 1495, where his younger brother Martim died fighting by his side.

Afonso made his mark under the stern John II, and won military campaigns in Africa and the Mediterranean sea, yet Asia is where he would make his greatest impact.

When King <a href="Manuel%20I%20of%20Portugal">Manuel I of Portugal</a> was enthroned, he showed some reticence towards Afonso, a close friend of his dreaded predecessor and seventeen years his senior. Eight years later, on 6 April 1503, after a long military career and at a mature age, Afonso was sent on his first expedition to India together with his cousin Francisco de Albuquerque. Each commanded three ships, sailing with <a href="Duarte%20Pacheco%20Pereira">Duarte Pacheco Pereira</a> and <a href="Nicolau%20Coelho">Nicolau Coelho</a>. They engaged in several battles against the forces of the <a href="Zamorin">Zamorin</a> of <a href="Kozhikode">Calicut</a> ("Calecute", Kozhikode) and succeeded in establishing the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Cochin">King</a> of <a href="Kochi%2C%20India">Cohin</a> ("Cohim", Kochi) securely on his throne. In return, the King gave them permission to build the Portuguese <a href="Fort%20Emmanuel">fort "Immanuel" (Fort Kochi)</a> and establish trade relations with <a href="Quilon">Quilon</a> ("Coulão", <a href="Kollam">Kollam</a>). This laid the foundation for the eastern <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese Empire</a>.

Afonso returned home in July 1504, and was well received by King Manuel I. After he assisted with the creation of a strategy for the Portuguese efforts in the east, King Manuel entrusted him with the command of a squadron of five vessels in the fleet of sixteen sailing for India in early 1506 headed by <a href="Trist%C3%A3o%20da%20Cunha">Tristão da Cunha</a>.
Their aim was to conquer <a href="Socotra">Socotra</a> and build a fortress there, hoping to close the trade in the Red Sea.
Afonso went as "chief-captain for the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Coast of Arabia</a>", sailing under da Cunha's orders until reaching Mozambique. He carried a sealed letter with a secret mission ordered by the King: after fulfilling the first mission, he was to replace the first viceroy of India, <a href="Francisco%20de%20Almeida">Francisco de Almeida</a>, whose term ended two years later. Before departing, he legitimized a natural son born in 1500, and made his will.

The fleet left Lisbon on 6 April 1506. Afonso piloted his ship himself, having lost his appointed pilot on departure. In <a href="Juan%20de%20Nova%20Island">Mozambique Channel</a>, they rescued Captain <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20da%20Nova">João da Nova</a>, who had encountered difficulties on his return from India; da Nova and his ship, the "<a href="Frol%20de%20la%20mar">Frol de la mar</a>", joined da Cunha's fleet. From <a href="Malindi">Malindi</a>, da Cunha sent envoys to <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, which at the time was thought to be closer than it actually is. Those included the priest João Gomes, João Sanches and Tunisian Sid Mohammed who, having failed to cross the region, headed for <a href="Socotra">Socotra</a>; from there, Afonso managed to land them in <a href="Cape%20Guardafui">Filuk</a>.
After successful attacks on Arab cities on the east Africa coast, they conquered Socotra and built a fortress at Suq, hoping to establish a base to stop the Red Sea commerce to the Indian Ocean. However, Socotra was abandoned four years later, as it was not advantageous as a base.

At Socotra, they parted ways: Tristão da Cunha sailed for India, where he would relieve the Portuguese <a href="Siege%20of%20Cannanore%20%281507%29">besieged at Cannanore</a>, while Afonso took seven ships and 500 men to <a href="Ormuz">Ormuz</a> in the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, one of the chief eastern centers of commerce. On his way, he conquered the cities of Curiati (Kuryat), <a href="Muscat%2C%20Oman">Muscat</a> in July 1507, and <a href="Khor%20Fakkan">Khor Fakkan</a>, accepting the submission of the cities of Kalhat and <a href="Sohar">Sohar</a>. He arrived at Ormuz on 25 September and soon <a href="Capture%20of%20Ormuz%20%281507%29">captured the city</a>, which agreed to become a tributary state of the Portuguese king. A few days later, the King of Ormuz was met by an envoy demanding the payment of tribute to Shah <a href="Ismail%20I">Ismail I</a> from <a href="Persia">Persia</a>. He was sent back with the answer that the only tribute would be in cannonballs and guns, thus beginning the connection between Alfonso and Shah Ismail I (often named Xeque Ismael). Afonso began building the <a href="Fort%20of%20Our%20Lady%20of%20the%20Conception%20in%20Hormoz%20island">Fort of Our Lady of Victory</a> (later renamed Fort of Our Lady of the Conception), engaging his men of all ranks in the work.

However, some of his officers revolted against the heavy work and climate and, claiming that Afonso was exceeding his orders, departed for India. With the fleet reduced to two ships and left without supplies, he was unable to maintain this position for long. Forced to abandon Ormuz in January 1508, he raided coastal villages to resupply the settlement of Socotra, returned to Ormuz, and then headed to India.

Afonso arrived at <a href="Kannur">Cannanore</a> on the <a href="Malabarian%20Coast">Malabar coast</a> in December 1508, where he opened before the viceroy, Dom Francisco de Almeida, the sealed letter which he had received from the King, and which named as governor to succeed Almeida.
The viceroy, supported by the officers who had abandoned Afonso at Ormuz, had a matching royal order, but declined to yield, protesting that his term ended only in January and stating his intention to avenge his son's death by fighting the <a href="Mamluk%20Sultanate%20%28Cairo%29">Mamluk</a> fleet of <a href="Mirocem">Mirocem</a>, refusing Afonso's offer to fight him himself. Afonso avoided confrontation, which could have led to civil war, and moved to <a href="Kochi%2C%20India">Kochi, India</a>, to await further instruction from the King, maintaining his entourage himself. He was described by <a href="Fern%C3%A3o%20Lopes%20de%20Castanheda">Fernão Lopes de Castanheda</a> as patiently enduring open opposition from the group that had gathered around Almeida, with whom he kept formal contact. Increasingly isolated, he wrote to <a href="Diogo%20Lopes%20de%20Sequeira">Diogo Lopes de Sequeira</a>, who arrived in India with a new fleet, but was ignored as Sequeira joined the Viceroy. At the same time, Afonso refused approaches from opponents of the Viceroy, who encouraged him to seize power.

On 3 February 1509, Almeida fought the naval <a href="Battle%20of%20Diu">Battle of Diu</a> against a joint fleet of <a href="Burji%20dynasty">Mamluks</a>, <a href="Ottomans">Ottomans</a>, the <a href="Zamorin">Zamorin</a> of <a href="Kozhikode">Calicut</a>, and the <a href="Mahmud%20Begada">Sultan of Gujarat</a>, regarding it as personal revenge for the death of his son. His victory was decisive: the Ottomans and Mamluks abandoned the Indian Ocean, easing the way for Portuguese rule there for the next century. In August, after a petition from Afonso's former officers with the support of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira claiming him unfit for governance, Afonso was sent in custody to <a href="St.%20Angelo%20Fort">St. Angelo Fort</a> in <a href="Kannur">Cannanore</a>. There he remained under what he considered to be imprisonment.

In September 1509, Sequeira tried to establish contact with the <a href="Malacca%20sultanate">Sultan of Malacca</a> but failed, leaving behind 19 Portuguese prisoners.

Afonso was released after three months' confinement, on the arrival at Cannanore of the <a href="Marshal%20of%20Portugal">Marshal of Portugal</a> with a large fleet.
The Portuguese Marshal was the most important Portuguese noble ever to visit India and he brought an armada of fifteen ships and 3,000 men sent by the King to defend Afonso's rights, and to take <a href="Kozhikode">Calicut</a>.

On 4 November 1509, Afonso became the second Governor of the State of India, a position he would hold until his death. Almeida having returned home in 1510, Afonso speedily showed the energy and determination of his character. He intended to dominate the Muslim world and control the <a href="Spice%20trade">Spice trade</a>.

Initially King Manuel I and his council in Lisbon tried to distribute the power, outlining three areas of jurisdiction in the Indian Ocean. In 1509, the nobleman <a href="Diogo%20Lopes%20de%20Sequeira">Diogo Lopes de Sequeira</a> was sent with a fleet to Southeast Asia, to seek an agreement with <a href="Sultan%20Mahmud%20Shah">Sultan Mahmud Shah</a> of <a href="Malacca">Malacca</a>, but failed and returned to Portugal. To Jorge de Aguiar was given the region between the Cape of Good Hope and Gujarat. He was succeeded by Duarte de Lemos, but left for Cochin and then for Portugal, leaving his fleet to Afonso.

In January 1510, obeying the orders from the King and aware of the absence of <a href="Zamorin">Zamorin</a>, Afonso advanced on Calicut. The attack was unsuccessful, as Marshal Fernando Coutinho ventured into the inner city against instructions, fascinated by its richness, and was ambushed. During the rescue, Afonso was wounded and had to retreat.

Soon after the failed attack, Afonso assembled a fleet of 23 ships and 1200 men. Contemporary reports state that he wanted to fight the <a href="Mamluk%20Sultanate%20%28Cairo%29">Egyptian Mamluk Sultanate</a> fleet in the Red Sea or return to Hormuz. However, he had been informed by <a href="Timoji">Timoji</a> (a privateer in the service of the Hindu <a href="Vijayanagara%20Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a>) that it would be easier to fight them in <a href="Goa">Goa</a>, where they had sheltered after the Battle of Diu, and also of the illness of the Sultan <a href="Yusuf%20Adil%20Shah">Yusuf Adil Shah</a>, and war between the <a href="Deccan%20sultanates">Deccan sultanates</a>. So he relied on surprise in the capture of Goa from the <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Bijapur">Sultanate of Bijapur</a>. He thus completed another mission, for Portugal wanted not to be seen as an eternal "guest" of Kochi and had been coveting Goa as the best trading port in the region.

A first assault took place in Goa from 4 March to 20 May 1510. After initial occupation, feeling unable to hold the city given the poor condition of its fortifications, the cooling of Hindu residents' support and insubordination among his ranks following an attack by <a href="Ismail%20Adil%20Shah">Ismail Adil Shah</a>, Afonso refused a truce offered by the Sultan and abandoned the city in August. His fleet was scattered, and a palace revolt in Kochi hindered his recovery, so he headed to <a href="Fort%20Anjediva">Fort Anjediva</a>. New ships arrived from Portugal, which were intended for the nobleman Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos at Malacca, who had been given a rival command of the region.

Three months later, on 25 November Afonso reappeared at Goa with a renovated fleet. Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos was compelled to accompany him with the reinforcements for Malacca and about 300 Malabari reinforcements from Cannanore. In less than a day, they took Goa from Ismail Adil Shah and his Ottoman allies, who surrendered on 10 December. It is estimated that 6000 of the 9000 Muslim defenders of the city died, either in the fierce battle in the streets or by drowning while trying to escape. Alfonso regained the support of the Hindu population, although he frustrated the initial expectations of Timoji, who aspired to become governor. Afonso rewarded him by appointing him chief "<a href="Aguazil">Aguazil</a>" of the city, an administrator and representative of the Hindu and Muslim people, as a knowledgeable interpreter of the local customs. He then made an agreement to lower the yearly tribute.

In Goa, Afonso established the first Portuguese <a href="Mint%20%28coin%29">mint</a> in the East, after Timoja's merchants had complained of the scarcity of currency, taking it as an opportunity to solidify the territorial conquest. The new <a href="Portuguese%20Indian%20rupia">coin</a>, based on the existing local coins, showed a cross on the obverse and an <a href="armillary%20sphere">armillary sphere</a> (or "esfera"), King Manuel's badge, on the reverse. Gold cruzados or "manueis", silver "esferas" and "alf-esferas", and bronze "leais" were issued. Another mint was established at Malacca in 1511.

Albuquerque founded at Goa the "Hospital Real de Goa" or Royal Hospital of Goa, by the Church of Santa Catarina. Upon hearing that the doctors were extorting the sickly with excessive fees, Albuquerque summoned them, declaring that "You charge a physicians' pay and don't know what disease the men who serve our lord the King suffer from. Thus, I want to teach you what is it that they die from" and put them to work building the city walls all day till nightfall before releasing them.

Despite constant attacks, Goa became the center of Portuguese India, with the conquest triggering the compliance of neighbouring kingdoms: the <a href="Sultan%20of%20Gujarat">Sultan of Gujarat</a> and the <a href="Zamorin">Zamorin</a> of Calicut sent embassies, offering alliances and local grants to fortify.

Afonso then used Goa to secure the <a href="Spice%20trade">Spice trade</a> in favor of Portugal and sell <a href="Persia">Persia</a>n <a href="horse">horse</a>s to <a href="Vijayanagara">Vijayanagara</a> and Hindu princes in return for their assistance.

Afonso explained to his armies why the Portuguese wanted to capture Malacca:

In February 1511, through a friendly Hindu merchant, Nina Chatu, Afonso received a letter from Rui de Araújo, one of the nineteen Portuguese held at Malacca since 1509. It urged moving forward with the largest possible fleet to demand their release, and gave details of the fortifications. Afonso showed it to Diogo Mendes de Vasconcelos, as an argument to advance in a joint fleet. In April 1511, after fortifying Goa, he gathered a force of about 900 Portuguese, 200 Hindu mercenaries and about eighteen ships. He then sailed to <a href="Malacca%20Sultanate">Malacca</a> against orders and despite the protest of Diogo Mendes, who claimed command of the expedition. Afonso eventually centralized the Portuguese government in the Indian Ocean. After the Malaccan conquest he wrote a letter to the King to explain his disagreement with Diogo Mendes, suggesting that further divisions could be harmful to the Portuguese in India. Under his command was <a href="Ferdinand%20Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a>, who had participated in the failed embassy of Diogo Lopes de Sequeira in 1509.

After a false start towards the Red Sea, they sailed to the Strait of Malacca. It was the richest city that the Portuguese tried to take, and a focal point in the trade network where Malay traders met Gujarati, Chinese, Japanese, Javanese, Bengali, Persian and Arabic, among others, described by <a href="Tom%C3%A9%20Pires">Tomé Pires</a> as of invaluable richness. Despite its wealth, it was mostly a wooden-built city, with few masonry buildings but was defended by a mercenary force estimated at 20,000 men and more than 2000 pieces of artillery. Its greatest weakness was the unpopularity of the government of <a href="Sultan%20Mahmud%20Shah">Sultan Mahmud Shah</a>, who favoured Muslims, arousing dissatisfaction amongst other merchants.

Afonso made a bold approach to the city, his ships decorated with banners, firing cannon volleys. He declared himself lord of all the navigation, demanded the Sultan release the prisoners and pay for damages, and demanded consent to build a fortified trading post. The Sultan eventually freed the prisoners, but was unimpressed by the small Portuguese contingent. Afonso then burned some ships at the port and four coastal buildings as a demonstration. The city being divided by the Malacca River, the connecting bridge was a strategic point, so at dawn on 25 July the Portuguese landed and fought a tough battle, facing poisoned arrows, taking the bridge in the evening. After fruitlessly waiting for the Sultan's reaction, they returned to the ships and prepared a <a href="Junk%20%28ship%29">junk</a> (offered by Chinese merchants), filling it with men, artillery and sandbags. Commanded by <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%20de%20Abreu">António de Abreu</a>, it sailed upriver at high tide to the bridge. The day after, all had landed. After a fierce fight during which the Sultan appeared with an army of <a href="war%20elephant">war elephant</a>s, the defenders were dispersed and the Sultan fled. Afonso waited for the reaction of the Sultan. Merchants approached, asking for Portuguese protection. They were given banners to mark their premises, a sign that they would not be looted. On 15 August, the Portuguese attacked again, but the Sultan had fled the city. Under strict orders, they looted the city, but respected the banners.

Afonso prepared Malacca's defenses against a Malay counterattack, building a fortress, assigning his men to shifts and using stones from the mosque and the cemetery. Despite the delays caused by heat and malaria, it was completed in November 1511, its surviving door now known as "<a href="A%20Famosa">A Famosa</a>" ('the famous'). It was possibly then that Afonso had a large stone engraved with the names of the participants in the conquest. To quell disagreements over the order of the names, he had it set facing the wall, with the single inscription "Lapidem quem reprobaverunt aedificantes" (Latin for "The stone the builders rejected", from <a href="David">David</a>'s prophecy, Psalm 118:22–23) on the front.

He settled the Portuguese administration, reappointing Rui de Araújo as <a href="factor%20%28agent%29">factor</a>, a post assigned before his 1509 arrest, and appointing rich merchant Nina Chatu to replace the previous "<a href="bendahara">bendahara</a>", representative of the "<a href="Kafir">Kafir</a>" people and adviser. Besides assisting in the governance of the city and first Portuguese coinage, he provided the junks for several diplomatic missions. Meanwhile, Afonso arrested and had executed the powerful Javanese merchant Utimuti Raja who, after being appointed to a position in the Portuguese administration as representative of the Javanese population, had maintained contacts with the exiled royal family.

Afonso arranged for the shipping of many <a href="%C3%93rf%C3%A3s%20d%27El-Rei">Órfãs d'El-Rei</a> to Portuguese Malacca.

On 20 November 1511 Afonso sailed from Malacca to the coast of Malabar on the old "<a href="Flor%20de%20la%20mar">Flor de la mar</a>" <a href="carrack">carrack</a> that had served to support the conquest of Malacca. Despite its unsound condition, he used it to transport the treasure amassed in the conquest, given its large capacity. He wanted to give the court of King Manuel a show of Malaccan treasures. There were also the offers from the <a href="Ayutthaya%20Kingdom">Kingdom of Siam</a> (Thailand) to the King of Portugal and all his own fortune. On the voyage the "<a href="Flor%20De%20La%20Mar">Flor De La Mar</a>" was wrecked in a storm, and Afonso barely escaped drowning.

Most Muslim and Gujarati merchants having fled the city, Afonso invested in diplomatic efforts demonstrating generosity to Southeast Asian merchants, like the Chinese, to encourage good relations with the Portuguese. Trade and diplomatic missions were sent to continental kingdoms: Rui Nunes da Cunha was sent to <a href="Pegu">Pegu</a> (Burma), from where King Binyaram sent back a friendly emissary to Kochi in 1514 and <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>, Sumatran kings of Kampar and Indragiri sending emissaries to Afonso accepting the new power, as vassal states of Malacca. Knowing of Siamese ambitions over Malacca, Afonso sent <a href="Duarte%20Fernandes">Duarte Fernandes</a> in a diplomatic mission to the <a href="Ayutthaya%20Kingdom">Kingdom of Siam</a> (Thailand), returning in a Chinese junk. He was one of the Portuguese who had been arrested in Malacca, having gathered knowledge about the culture of the region. There he was the first European to arrive, establishing amicable relations between the kingdom of Portugal and the court of the King of Siam <a href="Ramathibodi%20II">Ramathibodi II</a>, returning with a Siamese envoy bearing gifts and letters to Afonso and the King of Portugal.

In November, after having secured Malacca and learning the location of the then secret "<a href="Maluku%20Islands">spice islands</a>", Afonso sent three ships to find them, led by trusted <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%20de%20Abreu">António de Abreu</a> with deputy commander <a href="Francisco%20Serr%C3%A3o">Francisco Serrão</a>. <a href="Malay%20%28ethnic%20group%29">Malay</a> sailors were recruited to guide them through <a href="Java">Java</a>, the <a href="Lesser%20Sunda%20Islands">Lesser Sunda Islands</a> and the <a href="Ambon%20Island">Ambon Island</a> to <a href="Banda%20Islands">Banda Islands</a>, where they arrived in early 1512. There they remained for a month, buying and filling their ships with <a href="nutmeg">nutmeg</a> and <a href="clove">clove</a>s. António de Abreu then sailed to Amboina whilst Serrão sailed towards the Moluccas, but he was shipwrecked near Seram. <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Ternate">Sultan Abu Lais of Ternate</a> heard of their stranding, and, seeing a chance to ally himself with a powerful foreign nation, brought them to Ternate in 1512 where they were permitted to build a fort on the island, the Forte de São João Baptista de Ternate (, built in 1522.)

In early 1513, <a href="Jorge%20%C3%81lvares">Jorge Álvares</a>, sailing on a mission under Afonso's orders, was allowed to land in <a href="Lintin%20Island">Lintin Island</a>, on the <a href="Pearl%20River%20Delta">Pearl River Delta</a> in southern China. Soon after, Afonso sent <a href="Rafael%20Perestrello">Rafael Perestrello</a> to southern China, seeking trade relations with the <a href="Ming%20dynasty">Ming dynasty</a>. In ships from <a href="Portuguese%20Malacca">Portuguese Malacca</a>, Rafael sailed to Canton (<a href="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a>) in 1513, and again from 1515 to 1516 to trade with Chinese merchants. These ventures, along with those of <a href="Tom%C3%A9%20Pires">Tomé Pires</a> and <a href="Fern%C3%A3o%20Pires%20de%20Andrade">Fernão Pires de Andrade</a>, were the first direct European diplomatic and commercial ties with China. However, after the death of the Chinese <a href="Zhengde%20Emperor">Zhengde Emperor</a> on 19 April 1521, conservative factions at court seeking to limit eunuch influence rejected the new Portuguese embassy, fought sea battles with the Portuguese around <a href="Tuen%20Mun">Tuen Mun</a>, and Tomé was forced to write letters to Malacca stating that he and other ambassadors would not be released from prison in China until the Portuguese relinquished their control of Malacca and returned it to the deposed <a href="Sultan%20of%20Malacca">Sultan of Malacca</a> (who was previously a Ming tributary vassal). Nonetheless, Portuguese relations with China became normalized again by the 1540s and in 1557 a permanent Portuguese base at <a href="Macau">Macau</a> in southern China was established with consent from the Ming court.

Afonso returned from Malacca to Cochin, but could not sail to Goa as it faced a serious revolt headed by the forces of <a href="Ismael%20Adil%20Shah">Ismael Adil Shah</a>, the Sultan of <a href="Adil%20Shahi%20dynasty">Bijapur</a>, commanded by <a href="Rasul%20Khan">Rasul Khan</a> and his countrymen. During Afonso's absence from Malacca, Portuguese who opposed the taking of Goa had waived its possession, even writing to the King that it would be best to let it go. Held up by the monsoon and with few forces available, Afonso had to wait for the arrival of reinforcement fleets headed by his nephew D. Garcia de Noronha, and Jorge de Mello Pereira.

While at Cochin, Albuquerque started a school. In a private letter to King Manuel I, he states that he had found a chest full of books with which to teach the children of married Portuguese settlers ("casados") and Christian converts to read and write which, according to Albuquerque, there were about a hundred in his time, "all very sharp and easily learn what they are taught".

On 10 September 1512, Afonso sailed from Cochin to Goa with fourteen ships carrying 1,700 soldiers. Determined to recapture the fortress, he ordered trenches dug and a wall breached. But on the day of the planned final assault, Rasul Khan surrendered. Afonso demanded the fort be handed over with its artillery, ammunition and horses, and the deserters to be given up. Some had joined Rasul Khan when the Portuguese were forced to flee Goa in May 1510, others during the recent siege. Rasul Khan consented, on condition that their lives be spared. Afonso agreed and he left Goa. He did spare the lives of the deserters, but had them horribly mutilated. One such renegade was <a href="Fern%C3%A3o%20Lopes%20%28soldier%29">Fernão Lopes</a>, bound for Portugal in custody, who escaped at the island of Saint Helena and led a 'Robinson Crusoe' life for many years. After such measures the town became the most prosperous Portuguese settlement in India.

In December 1512 an envoy from <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> arrived at Goa. <a href="Mateus%20%28Ethiopia%29">Mateus</a> was sent by the regent queen <a href="Eleni%20of%20Ethiopia">Eleni</a>, following the arrival of the Portuguese from Socotra in 1507, as an ambassador for the king of Portugal in search of a coalition to help face growing Ottoman influence. He was received in Goa with great honour by Afonso, as a long-sought "<a href="Prester%20John">Prester John</a>" envoy. His arrival was announced by King Manuel to <a href="Pope%20Leo%20X">Pope Leo X</a> in 1513. Although Mateus faced the distrust of Afonso's rivals, who tried to prove he was some impostor or Muslim spy, Afonso sent him to Portugal. The King is described as having wept with joy at their report.

In February 1513, while Mateus was in Portugal, Afonso sailed to the Red Sea with a force of about 1000 Portuguese and 400 Malabaris. He was under orders to secure that channel for Portugal. Socotra had proved ineffective to control the Red Sea entrance and was abandoned, and Afonso's hint that <a href="Massawa">Massawa</a> could be a good Portuguese base might have been influenced by Mateus' reports.

Knowing that the Mamluks were preparing a second fleet at <a href="Suez">Suez</a>, he wanted to advance before reinforcements arrived in <a href="Aden">Aden</a>, and accordingly laid siege to the city. Aden was a fortified city, but although he had scaling ladders they broke and after half a day of fierce battle Afonso was forced to retreat. He cruised the Red Sea inside the <a href="Bab%20al-Mandab">Bab al-Mandab</a>, with the first European fleet to have sailed this route. He attempted to reach <a href="Jeddah">Jeddah</a>, but the winds were unfavourable and so he sheltered at <a href="Kamaran">Kamaran</a> island in May, until sickness among the men and lack of fresh water forced him to retreat. In August 1513, after a second attempt to reach Aden, he returned to India with no substantial results. In order to destroy the power of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, he is said to have entertained the idea of diverting the course of the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> river to render the whole country barren. Perhaps most tellingly, he intended to steal the body of the Islamic prophet, <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, and hold it for ransom until all Muslims had left the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a>.

In 1514 Afonso devoted himself to governing Goa, concluding peace with Calicut and receiving embassies from Indian governors, strengthening the city and encouraging marriages of Portuguese men and local women. At that time, Portuguese women were barred from traveling overseas. In 1511 under a policy which Afonso promulgated, the Portuguese government encouraged their explorers to marry local women. To promote settlement, the King of Portugal granted freeman status and exemption from Crown taxes to Portuguese men (known as "casados", or "married men") who ventured overseas and married local women. With Afonso's encouragement, mixed marriages flourished. He appointed local people for positions in the Portuguese administration and did not interfere with local traditions (except "<a href="Sati%20%28practice%29">sati</a>", the practice of immolating widows, which he banned).

In March 1514 King Manuel sent to <a href="Pope%20Leo%20X">Pope Leo X</a> a huge and exotic embassy led by <a href="Trist%C3%A3o%20da%20Cunha">Tristão da Cunha</a>, who toured the streets of Rome in an extravagant procession of animals from the colonies and wealth from the Indies. His reputation reached its peak, laying foundations of the Portuguese Empire in the East.

In early 1514, Afonso sent ambassadors to <a href="Gujarat%20Sultanate">Gujarat's Sultan</a> <a href="Muzaffar%20Shah%20II">Muzaffar Shah II</a>, ruler of <a href="Cambay">Cambay</a>, to seek permission to build a fort on <a href="Diu%2C%20India">Diu, India</a>. The mission returned without an agreement, but <a href="diplomatic%20gift">diplomatic gift</a>s were exchanged, including an <a href="Indian%20rhinoceros">Indian rhinoceros</a>. Alfonso sent the gift, named "ganda", and its Indian keeper, Ocem, to King Manuel. In late 1515, Manuel sent it as a gift, the famous <a href="D%C3%BCrer%27s%20Rhinoceros">Dürer's Rhinoceros</a> to Pope Leo X. Dürer never saw the actual rhinoceros, which was the first living example seen in Europe since <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman times</a>.

In 1513, at Cannanore, Afonso was visited by a <a href="Persia">Persia</a>n ambassador from Shah <a href="Ismail%20I">Ismail I</a>, who had sent ambassadors to Gujarat, <a href="Ormuz">Ormuz</a> and Bijapur. The <a href="shah">shah</a>'s ambassador to Bijapur invited Afonso to send back an envoy to Persia. Miguel Ferreira was sent via Ormuz to <a href="Tabriz">Tabriz</a>, where he had several interviews with the shah about common goals on defeating the Mamluk sultan.

Having returned with rich presents and an ambassador, on the journey back in March 1515 they were met by Afonso at Ormuz. Fueled by the shah's offers, Afonso had decided to recapture Ormuz. He had learned that after the Portuguese retreat in 1507, a young king was reigning under the influence of a powerful Persian <a href="vizier">vizier</a>, Reis Hamed, whom the king greatly feared. At Ormuz, Afonso met the king and asked the vizier to be present. He then had him immediately stabbed and killed by his entourage, thus "freeing" the dominated king, so the island in the Persian Gulf yielded to him without resistance and remained a vassal state of the <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese Empire</a>. Ormuz itself would not be Persian territory for another century, until a British-Persian alliance finally expelled the Portuguese in 1622. There in Ormuz, Afonso remained, engaging in diplomatic efforts and receiving envoys while becoming increasingly ill. In November 1515, he decided to return to Goa, but he fell increasingly ill during the journey and died in the harbour of Goa.

Afonso's life ended on a bitter note, with a painful and ignominious close. At this time, his political enemies at the Portuguese court were planning his downfall. They had lost no opportunity in stirring up the jealousy of King Manuel against him, insinuating that Afonso intended to usurp power in Portuguese India.

Since at least the beginning of November 1515, Afonso knew that he had been replaced in the government of India by a political adversary, <a href="Lopo%20Soares%20de%20Albergaria">Lopo Soares de Albergaria</a>. Reportedly, he even received a letter from the ambassador of the Persian potentate Shah Ismael, inviting Afonso to become a leading lord in Persia. His illness was reported as early as September 1515.

While on his return voyage from Ormuz in the Persian Gulf, near the harbor of <a href="Goa">Goa</a>, he received news of a Portuguese fleet arriving from Europe, bearing dispatches announcing that he was to be replaced by his personal foe, the Portuguese Lopo Soares de Albergaria. Feeling himself near death, he drew up his will, appointed the captain and senior officials of Ormuz, and organized a final council with his captains to decide the main matters affecting the Estado da Índia.

He wrote a long letter to King Manuel, voicing his bitterness: "I am in ill favor with the King for love of men, and with men for love of the King." He asked the King to confer onto his <a href="natural%20son">natural son</a> "all of the high honors and rewards" that were justly due to Afonso. He wrote in dignified and affectionate terms, assuring Manuel of his loyalty. On 16 December 1515, Afonso de Albuquerque died within sight of Goa. The gentiles were reported as saying, "It could not be that he was dead, but that God had need of him for some war and had therefore sent for him".

In Portugal, King Manuel's zigzagging policies continued, still trapped by the constraints of real-time medieval communication between Lisbon and India and unaware that Afonso was dead. Hearing rumours that the <a href="Mamluk%20Sultanate%20%28Cairo%29">Mamluk Sultan of Egypt</a> was preparing a magnificent army at Suez to prevent the conquest of Ormuz, he repented of having replaced Afonso, and in March 1516 urgently wrote to Albergaria to return the command of all operations to Afonso and provide him with resources to face the Egyptian threat. He organized a new Portuguese navy in Asia, with orders that Afonso (if he was still in India), be made commander-in-chief against the Sultan of Cairo's armies. Manuel would afterwards learn that Afonso had died many months earlier, and that his reversed decision had been delivered many months too late.

Afonso's body was buried in Goa, according to his will, in the Church of Nossa Senhora da Serra (Our Lady of the Hill), which he had caused to be built in 1513 to thank the Madonna for his escape from <a href="Kamaran">Kamaran</a> island. After 51 years, in 1566, his body was moved to Nossa Senhora da Graça church in Lisbon, which was ruined and rebuilt after the <a href="1755%20Lisbon%20earthquake">1755 Great Lisbon earthquake</a>.

King Manuel I of Portugal was belatedly convinced of Afonso's loyalty, and endeavoured to atone for his lack of confidence in Afonso by heaping honours upon his son, <a href="Br%C3%A1s%20de%20Albuquerque">Brás de Albuquerque</a> (1500–1580), whom he renamed "Afonso" in memory of the father.

Afonso de Albuquerque was a prolific writer, having sent numerous letters to the king during his governorship, covering topics from minor issues to major strategies. In 1557 his son published a collection of his letters under the title "Commentarios do Grande Affonso d'Alboquerque"- a clear reference to <a href="Caesar%27s%20Commentaries%20%28disambiguation%29">Caesar's Commentaries</a>- which he reviewed and re-published in 1576. There Afonso was described as "a man of middle stature, with a long face, fresh complexion, the nose somewhat large. He was a prudent man, and a Latin scholar, and spoke in elegant phrases; his conversation and writings showed his excellent education. He was of ready words, very authoritative in his commands, very circumspect in his dealings with the Moors, and greatly feared yet greatly loved by all, a quality rarely found united in one captain. He was very valiant and favoured by fortune."

In 1572, Afonso's feats were described in "<a href="The%20Lusiads">The Lusiads</a>", the Portuguese main <a href="Epic%20poetry">epic poem</a> by <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20de%20Cam%C3%B5es">Luís Vaz de Camões</a> (Canto X, strophes 40–49). The poet praises his achievements, but has the <a href="muses">muses</a> frown upon the harsh rule of his men, of whom Camões was almost a contemporary fellow. In 1934, Afonso was celebrated by <a href="Fernando%20Pessoa">Fernando Pessoa</a> in "Mensagem", a symbolist epic. In the first part of this work, called "Brasão" (Coat-of-Arms), he relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields in the Portuguese coat-of-arms, Afonso being one of the wings of the <a href="griffin">griffin</a> headed by Henry the Navigator, the other wing being King John II.

A <a href="Alphonso%20%28mango%29">variety of mango</a> that he used to bring on his journeys to India has been named in his honour.

Numerous homages have been paid to Afonso; he is featured in the <a href="Padr%C3%A3o%20dos%20Descobrimentos">Padrão dos Descobrimentos</a> monument; there is a <a href="Afonso%20de%20Albuquerque%20Square">square carrying his name</a> in the Portuguese capital of <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, which also features a bronze statue; two Portuguese Navy ships have been named in his honour: the sloop <a href="Afonso%20de%20Albuquerque%20%281884%29">NRP "Afonso de Albuquerque" (1884)</a> and the warship <a href="NRP%20Afonso%20de%20Albuquerque">NRP "Afonso de Albuquerque"</a>, the latter belonging to a sloop class named Albuquerque.

The fabled <a href="Maluku%20Islands">Spice Islands</a> were on the imagination of Europe since ancient times. In the 2nd century AD, Malaya was known by the Greek philosopher <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, who labeled it 'Aurea Chersonesus"; and who said that it was believed the fabled area held gold in abundance. Even Indian traders referred to the East Pacific region as "Land of Gold" and made regular visits to Malaya in search of the precious metal, tin and sweet scented jungle woods. But neither Ptolemy, nor Rome, nor Alexander was able to see the fabled regions of the East Pacific. Afonso de Albuquerque became the first European to reach the Spice Islands. Upon discovering <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, he proceeded in 1511 to conquer Malacca, then commissioned an expedition under the command of <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%20de%20Abreu">António de Abreu</a> and Vice-Commander <a href="Francisco%20Serr%C3%A3o">Francisco Serrão</a> (the latter being a cousin of Magellan) to further explore the extremities of the region in east Indonesia. As a result of these voyages of exploration, the Portuguese became the first Europeans to discover and to reach the fabled Spice Islands of Malaysia, <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> and the <a href="Indies">Indies</a> in addition to discovering their sea routes. Afonso found what had evaded Columbus' grasp — the wealth of the Orient. His discoveries did not go unnoticed, and it took little time for <a href="Ferdinand%20Magellan">Magellan</a> to arrive in the same region a few years later and discover the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> for Spain, giving birth to the Papal <a href="Treaty%20of%20Zaragoza">Treaty of Zaragoza</a>.

Afonso's operations sent a voyage pushing further south which made the European discovery of Timor in the far south of Oceania, and the discovery of <a href="History%20of%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a> in 1512. This was followed up by another Portuguese, <a href="Jorge%20de%20Menezes">Jorge de Menezes</a> in 1526, who named Papua New Guinea, the "Island of the Papua".
Through Alfonso's diplomatic activities, Portugal opened the sea between Europe and China. As early as 1513, Jorge de Albuquerque, a Portuguese commanding officer in Malacca, sent his subordinate <a href="Jorge%20%C3%81lvares">Jorge Álvares</a> to sail to China on a ship loaded with pepper from Sumatra. After sailing across the sea, Jorge Álvares and his crew dropped anchor in Tamao, an island located at the mouth of the Pearl River. This was the first Portuguese to set foot in the territory known as China, the mythical "Middle Kingdom" where they erected a stone <a href="Padr%C3%A3o">Padrão</a>. Álvares is the first European to reach Chinese land by sea, and, the first European to enter Hong Kong. In 1514 Afonso de Albuquerque, the Viceroy of the Estado da India dispatched <a href="Rafael%20Perestrello">Rafael Perestrello</a> to sail to China in order to pioneer European trade relations with the Chinese nation. Rafael Perestrelo was quoted as saying, "being a very good and honest people, the Chinese hope to make friends with the Portuguese." In spite of initial harmony and excitement between the two empires, difficulties soon arose. Portugal's efforts in establishing lasting ties with China did pay off in the long run; the Portuguese colonized Macau, and established the first European permanent settlement on Chinese soil, which served as a permanent colonial base in southern China, and the two empires maintained an exchange in culture and trade for nearly 500 years. The longest empire in history (1515–1999), begun by Alfonso de Albuquerque five centuries earlier, ended when Portugal ceded the government of <a href="Portuguese%20Macau">Macau</a> to China.

Afonso de Albuquerque pioneered trade relations with Thailand, and was as such the first recorded European to contact Thailand.


Afonso de Albuquerque had a <a href="Legitimacy%20%28family%20law%29">bastard son</a> with an unrecorded woman. He legitimized the boy in February 1506. Before his death, he asked King Manuel I to leave to the son all his wealth and that the King oversee the son's education. When Alfonso died, Manuel I renamed the child "Afonso" in his father's memory. Brás Afonso de Albuquerque, or Braz in the old spelling, was born in 1500 and died in 1580.

Alcaeus of Mytilene

Alcaeus of <a href="Mytilene">Mytilene</a> (; , "Alkaios"; c. 620 – 6th century BC) was a <a href="Greek%20lyric">lyric poet</a> from the Greek island of <a href="Lesbos">Lesbos</a> who is credited with inventing the <a href="Alcaic%20stanza">Alcaic stanza</a>. He was included in the <a href="canon%20%28fiction%29">canonical</a> list of <a href="nine%20lyric%20poets">nine lyric poets</a> by the scholars of <a href="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. He was an older contemporary and an alleged lover of <a href="Sappho">Sappho</a>, with whom he may have exchanged poems. He was born into the <a href="Aristocracy%20%28government%29">aristocratic</a> governing <a href="Social%20class">class</a> of <a href="Mytilene">Mytilene</a>, the main city of Lesbos, where he was involved in political disputes and feuds.

The broad outlines of the poet's life are well known. He was born into the aristocratic, warrior class that dominated Mytilene, the strongest city-state on the island of Lesbos and, by the end of the seventh century BC, the most influential of all the North Aegean Greek cities, with a strong navy and colonies securing its trade-routes in the Hellespont. The city had long been ruled by kings born to the Penthilid clan but, during the poet's life, the Penthilids were a spent force and rival aristocrats and their factions contended with each other for supreme power. Alcaeus and his older brothers were passionately involved in the struggle but experienced little success. Their political adventures can be understood in terms of three tyrants who came and went in succession:

Sometime before 600 BC, Mytilene fought Athens for control of <a href="Sigeion">Sigeion</a> and Alcaeus was old enough to participate in the fighting. According to the historian <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, the poet threw away his shield to make good his escape from the victorious Athenians then celebrated the occasion in a poem that he later sent to his friend, Melanippus. It is thought that Alcaeus travelled widely during his years in exile, including at least one visit to Egypt. His older brother, Antimenidas, appears to have served as a mercenary in the army of <a href="Nebuchadnezzar%20II">Nebuchadnezzar II</a> and probably took part in the conquest of Askelon. Alcaeus wrote verses in celebration of Antimenides' return, including mention of his valour in slaying the larger opponent (frag. 350), and he proudly describes the military hardware that adorned their family home (frag. 357).

Alcaeus was a contemporary and a countryman of <a href="Sappho">Sappho</a> and, since both poets composed for the entertainment of Mytilenean friends, they had many opportunities to associate with each other on a quite regular basis, such as at the "Kallisteia", an annual festival celebrating the island's federation under Mytilene, held at the 'Messon' (referred to as "temenos" in frs. 129 and 130), where Sappho performed publicly with female choirs. Alcaeus' reference to Sappho in terms more typical of a divinity, as "holy/pure, honey-smiling Sappho" (fr. 384), may owe its inspiration to her performances at the festival. The Lesbian or Aeolic school of poetry "reached in the songs of Sappho and Alcaeus that high point of brilliancy to which it never after-wards approached" and it was assumed by later Greek critics and during the early centuries of the Christian era that the two poets were in fact lovers, a theme which became a favourite subject in art (as in the urn pictured above).

The poetic works of Alcaeus were collected into ten books, with elaborate commentaries, by the Alexandrian scholars <a href="Aristophanes%20of%20Byzantium">Aristophanes of Byzantium</a> and <a href="Aristarchus%20of%20Samothrace">Aristarchus of Samothrace</a> sometime in the 3rd century BC, and yet his verses today exist only in fragmentary form, varying in size from mere phrases, such as "wine, window into a man" (fr. 333) to entire groups of verses and stanzas, such as those quoted below (fr. 346). Alexandrian scholars numbered him in their <a href="Nine%20lyric%20poets">canonic nine</a> (one lyric poet per Muse). Among these, <a href="Pindar">Pindar</a> was held by many ancient critics to be pre-eminent, but some gave precedence to Alcaeus instead. The canonic nine are traditionally divided into two groups, with Alcaeus, Sappho and <a href="Anacreon">Anacreon</a>, being 'monodists' or 'solo-singers', with the following characteristics:
The other six of the canonic nine composed verses for public occasions, performed by choruses and professional singers and typically featuring complex metrical arrangements that were never reproduced in other verses. However, this division into two groups is considered by some modern scholars to be too simplistic and often it is practically impossible to know whether a lyric composition was sung or recited, or whether or not it was accompanied by musical instruments and dance. Even the private reflections of Alcaeus, ostensibly sung at dinner parties, still retain a public function.

Critics often seek to understand Alcaeus in comparison with Sappho:

The Roman poet, Horace, also compared the two, describing Alcaeus as "more full-throatedly singing" — see <a href="Alcaeus%20of%20Mytilene%23Horace">Horace's tribute</a> below. Alcaeus himself seems to underscore the difference between his own 'down-to-earth' style and Sappho's more 'celestial' qualities when he describes her almost as a goddess (as cited above), and yet it has been argued that both poets were concerned with a balance between the divine and the profane, each emphasising different elements in that balance.

<a href="Dionysius%20of%20Halicarnassus">Dionysius of Halicarnassus</a> exhorts us to "Observe in Alcaeus the sublimity, brevity and sweetness coupled with stern power, his splendid figures, and his clearness which was unimpaired by the dialect; and above all mark his manner of expressing his sentiments on public affairs," while <a href="Quintilian">Quintilian</a>, after commending Alcaeus for his excellence "in that part of his works where he inveighs against tyrants and contributes to good morals; in his language he is concise, exalted, careful and often like an orator;" goes on to add: "but he descended into wantonness and amours, though better fitted for higher things."

The works of Alcaeus are conventionally grouped according to five genres.

The following verses demonstrate some key characteristics of the Alcaic style (square brackets indicate uncertainties in the ancient text):
The Greek meter here is relatively simple, comprising the Greater <a href="Asclepiad%20%28poetry%29">Asclepiad</a>, adroitly used to convey, for example, the rhythm of jostling cups (). The language of the poem is typically direct and concise and comprises short sentences — the first line is in fact a model of condensed meaning, comprising an exhortation ("Let's drink!), a rhetorical question ("Why are we waiting for the lamps?") and a justifying statement (Only an inch of daylight left.) The meaning is clear and uncomplicated, the subject is drawn from personal experience, and there is an absence of poetic ornament, such as simile or metaphor. Like many of his poems (e.g., frs. 38, 326, 338, 347, 350), it begins with a verb (in this case "Let's drink!") and it includes a proverbial expression ("Only an inch of daylight left") though it is possible that he coined it himself.

Alcaeus rarely used metaphor or simile and yet he had a fondness for the allegory of the storm-tossed ship of state. The following fragment of a hymn to Castor and Polydeuces (the <a href="Dioscuri">Dioscuri</a>) is possibly another example of this though some scholars interpret it instead as a prayer for a safe voyage.
<poem style="margin-left:2em">
Hither now to me from your isle of Pelops,
You powerful children of Zeus and Leda,
Showing youselves kindly by nature, Castor
And Polydeuces!

Travelling abroad on swift-footed horses,
Over the wide earth, over all the ocean,
How easily you bring deliverance from
Death's gelid rigor,

Landing on tall ships with a sudden, great bound,
A far-away light up the forestays running,
Bringing radiance to a ship in trouble,
Sailed in the darkness!
</poem>

The poem was written in <a href="Sapphic%20stanza">Sapphic stanza</a>s, a verse form popularly associated with his compatriot, Sappho, but in which he too excelled, here paraphrased in English to suggest the same rhythms. There were probably another three stanzas in the original poem but only nine letters of them remain. The 'far-away light' () is a reference to <a href="St%20Elmo%27s%20Fire">St Elmo's Fire</a>, an electrical discharge supposed by ancient Greek mariners to be an epiphany of the Dioscuri, but the meaning of the line was obscured by gaps in the papyrus until reconstructed by a modern scholar—such reconstructions are typical of the extant poetry (see <a href="Alcaeus%20of%20Mytilene%23Scholars%2C%20fragments%20and%20sources">Scholars, fragments and sources</a> below). This poem doesn't begin with a verb but with an adverb (Δευτέ) but still communicates a sense of action. He probably performed his verses at <a href="Symposium">drinking parties</a> for friends and political allies—men for whom loyalty was essential, particularly in such troubled times.

The Roman poet <a href="Horace">Horace</a> modelled his own lyrical compositions on those of Alcaeus, rendering the Lesbian poet's verse-forms, including 'Alcaic' and 'Sapphic' stanzas, into concise Latin — an achievement he celebrates in his third book of odes. In his second book, in an ode composed in Alcaic stanzas on the subject of an almost fatal accident he had on his farm, he imagines meeting Alcaeus and Sappho in <a href="Hades">Hades</a>:
<a href="Ovid">Ovid</a> compared Alcaeus to Sappho in <a href="Heroides">Letters of the Heroines</a>, where Sappho is imagined to speak as follows:

The story of Alcaeus is partly the story of the scholars who rescued his work from oblivion. His verses have not come down to us through a manuscript tradition — generations of scribes copying an author's collected works, such as delivered intact into the modern age four entire books of <a href="Pindar">Pindar</a>'s odes — but haphazardly, in quotes from ancient scholars and commentators whose own works have chanced to survive, and in the tattered remnants of papyri uncovered from an ancient rubbish pile at <a href="Oxyrhynchus">Oxyrhynchus</a> and other locations in Egypt: sources that modern scholars have studied and correlated exhaustively, adding little by little to the world's store of poetic fragments.

Ancient scholars quoted Alcaeus in support of various arguments. Thus for example Heraclitus 'The Allegorist' quoted fr. 326 and part of fr. 6, about ships in a storm, in his study on Homer's use of allegory. The hymn to Hermes, fr308(b), was quoted by <a href="Hephaestion%20%28grammarian%29">Hephaestion (grammarian)</a> and both he and <a href="Libanius">Libanius</a>, the rhetorician, quoted the first two lines of fr. 350, celebrating the return from Babylon of Alcaeus' brother. The rest of fr. 350 was paraphrased in prose by the historian/geographer <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>. Many fragments were supplied in quotes by <a href="Athenaeus">Athenaeus</a>, principally on the subject of wine-drinking, but fr. 333, "wine, window into a man", was quoted much later by the Byzantine grammarian, <a href="John%20Tzetzes">John Tzetzes</a>.

The first 'modern' publication of Alcaeus' verses appeared in a Greek and Latin edition of fragments collected from the canonic nine lyrical poets by Michael Neander, published at Basle in 1556. This was followed by another edition of the nine poets, collected by <a href="Henricus%20Stephanus">Henricus Stephanus</a> and published in Paris in 1560. Fulvius Ursinus compiled a fuller collection of Alcaic fragments, including a commentary, which was published at Antwerp in 1568. The first separate edition of Alcaeus was by Christian David Jani and it was published at Halle in 1780. The next separate edition was by August Matthiae, Leipzig 1827.

Some of the fragments quoted by ancient scholars were able to be integrated by scholars in the nineteenth century. Thus for example two separate quotes by Athenaeus were united by <a href="Theodor%20Bergk">Theodor Bergk</a> to form fr. 362. Three separate sources were combined to form fr. 350, as mentioned above, including a prose paraphrase from Strabo that first needed to be restored to its original meter, a synthesis achieved by the united efforts of Otto Hoffmann, <a href="Karl%20Otfried%20Muller">Karl Otfried Muller</a> and <a href="Franz%20Heinrich%20Ludolf%20Ahrens">Franz Heinrich Ludolf Ahrens</a>. The discovery of the Oxyrhynchus papyri towards the end of the nineteenth century dramatically increased the scope of scholarly research. In fact, eight important fragments have now been compiled from papyri — frs. 9, 38A, 42, 45, 34, 129, 130 and most recently S262. These fragments typically feature lacunae or gaps that scholars fill with 'educated guesses', including for example a "brilliant supplement" by <a href="Maurice%20Bowra">Maurice Bowra</a> in fr. 34, a hymn to the Dioscuri that includes a description of <a href="St%20Elmo%27s%20fire">St Elmo's fire</a> in the ship's rigging. Working with only eight letters ( or "pro...tr...ntes"), Bowra conjured up a phrase that brilliantly develops the meaning and the euphony of the poem ( or "proton' ontrechontes"), describing luminescence "running along the forestays".

Alcamenes

Alcamenes () was an <a href="ancient%20Greek">ancient Greek</a> <a href="Sculpture">sculptor</a> of <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a> and <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, who flourished in the 2nd half of the 5th century BC. He was a younger contemporary of <a href="Phidias">Phidias</a> and noted for the delicacy and finish of his works, among which a <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a> and an <a href="Aphrodite%20of%20the%20Gardens">Aphrodite "of the Gardens"</a> were conspicuous.

<a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> says that he was the author of one of the pediments of the temple of <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> at <a href="Olympia%2C%20Greece">Olympia</a>, but this seems a chronological and stylistic impossibility. Pausanias also refers to a statue of Ares by Alcamenes that was erected on the <a href="Athenian%20agora">Athenian agora</a>, which some have related to the <a href="Ares%20Borghese">Ares Borghese</a>. However, the temple of Ares to which he refers had only been moved from <a href="Acharnes">Acharnes</a> and re-sited in the Agora in <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>'s time, and statues known to derive from Alcamenes' statue show the god in a <a href="breastplate">breastplate</a>, so the identification of Alcamenes' Ares with the Ares Borghese is not secure.

At <a href="Pergamum">Pergamum</a> there was discovered in 1903 a Hellenistic copy of the head of the Hermes "Propylaeus" of Alcamenes. As, however, the deity is represented in an <a href="Neo-Attic">Neo-Attic</a>, archaistic and conventional character, this copy cannot be relied on as giving us much information as to the usual style of Alcamenes, who was almost certainly a progressive and original artist.

It is safer to judge him by the sculptural decoration of the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>, in which he must almost certainly have taken a share under the direction of Phidias. He is said to be the most eminent sculptor in <a href="Athens">Athens</a> after the departure of Phidias for <a href="Olympia%2C%20Greece">Olympia</a>, but enigmatic in that none of the sculptures associated with his name in classical literature can be securely connected with existing copies.

Alcmene

In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, Alcmene or Alcmena ( or Ἀλκμάνα [Doric]) was the wife of <a href="Amphitryon">Amphitryon</a> by whom she bore two children, <a href="Iphicles">Iphicles</a> and <a href="Laonome">Laonome</a>. She is, however, better known as the mother of <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a> whose father was the god <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>.

According to the "<a href="Bibliotheca%20%28Pseudo-Apollodorus%29">Bibliotheca</a>", Alcmene was born to <a href="Electryon">Electryon</a>, the son of <a href="Perseus%20%28mythology%29">Perseus</a> and <a href="Andromeda%20%28mythology%29">Andromeda</a>, and king of <a href="Tiryns">Tiryns</a> and <a href="Mycenae">Mycenae</a> or Medea in <a href="Argolis%20%28ancient%20region%29">Argolis</a>. Her mother was <a href="Anaxo">Anaxo</a>, daughter of <a href="Alcaeus%20%28mythology%29">Alcaeus</a> and <a href="Astydameia">Astydamia</a>. Other accounts say her mother was <a href="Lysidice%20%28mythology%29">Lysidice</a>, the daughter of <a href="Pelops">Pelops</a> and <a href="Hippodamia">Hippodameia</a>, or <a href="Eurydice%20of%20Mycenae">Eurydice</a> the daughter of <a href="Pelops">Pelops</a>. According to <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a>, the poet <a href="Asius%20of%20Samos">Asius</a> made Alcmene the daughter of <a href="Amphiaraus">Amphiaraus</a> and <a href="Eriphyle">Eriphyle</a>.

<a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a> describes Alcmene as the tallest, most beautiful woman with wisdom surpassed by no person born of mortal parents. It is said that her face and dark eyes were as charming as <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>'s, and that she honoured her husband like no woman before her.

According to the "<a href="Bibliotheca%20%28Pseudo-Apollodorus%29">Bibliotheca</a>", Alcmene went with <a href="Amphitryon">Amphitryon</a> to <a href="Ancient%20Thebes%20%28Boeotia%29">Thebes</a>, where he was purified by <a href="Creon">Creon</a> for accidentally killing <a href="Electryon">Electryon</a>. Alcmene refused to marry Amphitryon until he had avenged the death of her brothers. During Amphitryon's expedition against the <a href="Taphians">Taphians</a> and <a href="Teleboans">Teleboans</a>, <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> visited Alcmene disguised as Amphitryon. Extending one night into three, Zeus slept with Alcmene, his great-granddaughter, thereby conceiving <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a>, while recounting Amphitryon's victories against the Teleboans. When Amphitryon finally returned to Thebes, Alcmene told him that he had come the night before and slept with her; he learned from <a href="Tiresias">Tiresias</a> what Zeus had done.

In <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>", when Alcmene was about to give birth to Heracles, Zeus announced to all the gods that on that day a child by Zeus himself, would be born and rule all those around him. <a href="Hera">Hera</a>, after requesting Zeus to swear an oath to that effect, descended from <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Olympus</a> to <a href="Argos">Argos</a> and made the wife of <a href="Sthenelus%20%28son%20of%20Andromeda%20and%20Perseus%29">Sthenelus</a> (son of Perseus) give birth to <a href="Eurystheus">Eurystheus</a> after only seven months, while at the same time preventing Alcmene from delivering Heracles. This resulted in the fulfilment of Zeus's oath in that it was Eurystheus rather than Heracles.

According to <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>", while in labour, Alcmene was having great difficulty giving birth to such a large child. After seven days and nights of agony, Alcmene stretched out her arms and called upon <a href="Lucina%20%28goddess%29">Lucina</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20Roman%20birth%20and%20childhood%20deities">goddess of childbirth</a> (the <a href="Roman%20mythology">Roman</a> equivalent of <a href="Eileithyia">Eileithyia</a>). While Lucina did go to Alcmene, she had been previously instructed by <a href="Juno%20%28mythology%29">Juno</a> (Hera) to prevent the delivery. With her hands clasped and legs crossed, Lucina muttered charms, thereby preventing Alcmene from giving birth. Alcmene writhed in pain, cursed the heavens, and came close to death. <a href="Galanthis">Galanthis</a>, a maid of Alcmene who was nearby, observed Lucina's behaviour and quickly deduced that it was Juno's doing. To put an end to her mistress's suffering, she announced that Alcmene had safely delivered her child, which surprised Lucina so much that she immediately jumped up and unclenched her hands. As soon as Lucina leapt up, Alcmene was released from her spell, and gave birth to Heracles. As punishment for deceiving Lucina, Galanthis was transformed into a <a href="weasel">weasel</a>; she continued to live with Alcmene.

In <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias'</a> recounting, Hera sent witches (as they were called by the Thebans) to hinder Alcmene's delivery of Heracles. The witches were successful in preventing the birth until <a href="Galanthis">Historis</a>, daughter of Tiresias, thought of a trick to deceive the witches. Like Galanthis, Historis announced that Alcmene had delivered her child; having been deceived, the witches went away, allowing Alcmene to give birth.

In contrast to the depictions of a difficult labor above, an alternative version is presented in "<a href="Amphitryon%20%28Plautus%20play%29">Amphitryon</a>", a comedic play by <a href="Plautus">Plautus</a>. Here Alcmene calls upon Jupiter, who performs a miracle allowing her to give birth quickly and without pain. After a crash of thunder and light, the baby arrives without anyone's assistance.

After the death of Amphitryon, Alcmene married <a href="Rhadamanthus">Rhadamanthys</a>, son of Zeus, and lived with him in exile at <a href="Ocalea%20%28town%29">Ocaleae</a> in <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a>. It is said that after Heracles was <a href="apotheosis">apotheosis</a>ed, Hyllus, having pursued and killed <a href="Eurystheus">Eurystheus</a>, cut off Eurystheus' head and gave it to Alcmene, who gouged out the eyes with weaving pins. In <a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>, an aging Alcmene recounted the story of the birth of Heracles to <a href="Iole">Iole</a>.

There are two accounts of Alcmene's death. In the first, according to the Megarians, Alcmene was walking from Argos to Thebes when she died at <a href="Megara">Megara</a>. The <a href="Heracleidae">Heracleidae</a> fell into disagreement about where to take Alcmene's body, with some wishing to take her corpse back to Argos, and others wishing to take it to Thebes to be buried with Amphitryon and Heracles' children by <a href="Megara%20%28mythology%29">Megara</a>. However, the god in <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a> gave the Heracleidae an oracle that it was better to bury Alcmene in Megara. In the second account given by the Thebans, when Alcmene died, she was turned from human form to a stone.

Pausanias indicated that an altar to Alcmene had been built in the <a href="Cynosarges">Cynosarges</a> in Athens, alongside altars to Heracles, <a href="Hebe%20%28mythology%29">Hebe</a>, and <a href="Iolaus">Iolaus</a>. Pausanias also said that Alcmene's tomb is located near the Olympieum at Megara.

Alcidamas

Alcidamas (), of <a href="Elaea%20%28Aeolis%29">Elaea</a>, in <a href="Aeolis">Aeolis</a>, <a href="ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> <a href="sophist">sophist</a> and <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a>ian, flourished in the 4th century BC.

He was the pupil and successor of <a href="Gorgias">Gorgias</a> and taught at <a href="Athens">Athens</a> at the same time as <a href="Isocrates">Isocrates</a>, whose rival and opponent he was. We possess two declamations under his name: "On Sophists" (Περὶ Σοφιστῶν), directed against Isocrates and setting forth the superiority of extempore over written speeches (a more recently discovered fragment of another speech against Isocrates is probably of later date); "Odysseus" (perhaps spurious) in which <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> accuses <a href="Palamedes%20%28mythology%29">Palamedes</a> of treachery during the siege of <a href="Troy">Troy</a>.

According to Alcidamas, the highest aim of the orator was the power of speaking "extempore" on every conceivable subject. <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> ("Rhet." iii. 3) criticizes his writings as characterized by pomposity of style and an extravagant use of poetical epithets and compounds and far-fetched metaphors.

Of other works only fragments and the titles have survived: "Messeniakos", advocating the freedom of the <a href="Messenia%20%28ancient%20region%29">Messenians</a> and containing the sentiment that "God has left all men free; nature has made no man a slave"; a "Eulogy of Death", in consideration of the wide extent of human sufferings; a "Techne" or instruction-book in the art
of rhetoric; and a "Phusikos logos". Lastly, his "Mouseion" (a word invoking the <a href="Muse">Muse</a>s) seems to have contained the narrative of the "<a href="Contest%20of%20Homer%20and%20Hesiod">Contest of Homer and Hesiod</a>", of which the version that has survived is the work of a grammarian in the time of <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>, based on Alcidamas. This hypothesis of the contents of the "Mouseion", originally suggested by <a href="Nietzsche">Nietzsche</a> ("Rheinisches Museum" 25 (1870) & 28 (1873)), appears to have been confirmed by three papyrus findsone 3rd century BC ("Flinders Petrie Papyri", ed. <a href="John%20Pentland%20Mahaffy">Mahaffy</a>, 1891, pl. xxv.), one 2nd century BC (Basil Mandilaras, 'A new papyrus fragment of the "Certamen Homeri et Hesiodi"' "Platon" 42 (1990) 45–51) and one 2nd or 3rd century AD (University of Michigan pap. 2754: Winter, J.

Aldine Press

Aldine Press was the <a href="printing">printing</a> office started by <a href="Aldus%20Manutius">Aldus Manutius</a> in 1494 in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, from which were issued the celebrated Aldine editions of the classics (Latin and Greek masterpieces plus a few more modern works). The first book that was dated and printed under his name appeared in 1495.

The Aldine Press is famous in the history of <a href="typography">typography</a>, among other things, for the introduction of <a href="italics">italics</a>. The press was the first to issue printed books in the small <a href="octavo%20%28book%29">octavo</a> size, similar to that of a modern paperback, and like that intended for portability and ease of reading. According to Curt Buhler, the press issued 132 books during twenty years of activity under Aldus. After Aldus’ death in 1515 the press was continued by his wife, Maria and her father, Andrea Torresani, until his son, Paulus Manutius (1512–1574) took over. His grandson <a href="Aldus%20Manutius%20the%20Younger">Aldus Manutius the Younger</a> then ran the firm until his death in 1597. Today, antique books printed by the Aldine Press in Venice are referred to as "Aldines".

The press enjoyed a <a href="Printing%20patent">monopoly</a> of works printed in Greek in the Republic of Venice, effectively giving it copyright protection. Protection outside the Republic was more problematic, however. The firm maintained an agency in Paris, but its commercial success was affected by many counterfeit editions, produced in Lyons and elsewhere.

<a href="Aldus%20Manutius">Aldus Manutius</a> the founder of the Aldine Press was originally a humanist scholar and teacher. Manutius met Andrea Torresani who had acquired publishing equipment from <a href="Nicolas%20Jenson">Nicholas Jensen</a>'s widow. The Aldine Press was originally owned half by Pier Francesco Barbarigo, the nephew of the current doge of the time, <a href="Agostino%20Barbarigo">Agostino Barbarigo</a>, and the other half by Andrea Torresani. Manutius owned one fifth of Torresani's share. Manutius mainly was in charge of the scholarship and editing, leaving financial and operating concerns to Barbarigo and Torresani. In 1496, Aldus established his own location in a building called the "Thermae" in the <a href="San%20Polo">Sestiere di San Polo</a>. The building was later demolished in 1873. Manutius lived and worked in the "Thermae" to produce published books from the Aldine Press. This was also the location of the "New Academy" where a group of Manutius' friends, associates, and editors came together to translate Greek and Latin texts.
The press was started by Manutius based on his love of classics and the need of preservation of Hellenic studies, at first the press printed new copies of Plato, Aristotle, and other Greek and Latin classics. He also printed dictionaries and grammars to help people interpret the books, which scholars wanting to learn Greek used to employ learned Greeks to teach them directly. Historian <a href="Elizabeth%20Eisenstein">Elizabeth Eisenstein</a> claimed that the fall of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in 1453 had threatened the importance and survival of Greek scholarship, but publications such as those by the Aldine Press secured it. <a href="Erasmus">Erasmus</a> was one of the scholars learned in Greek that the Aldine Press partnered with to provide accurately translated text. The Aldine Press also expanded into current languages, mainly Italian and French.
Aldus Manutius hired <a href="Francesco%20Griffo">Francesco Griffo</a> to create a typeface designed to reproduce the written hand of the humanists. This resulted in the first roman face adapted and known today as <a href="italic%20type">italic type</a>. It was first used to print <a href="Pietro%20Bembo">Cardinal Pietro Bembo's</a> "De Aetna" in 1495. Before this time print publishing used block letters, the look of handwriting as print was a new phenomenon and try as he might to prevent it, Manutius' typeface was illegally copied, spreading through Europe.
In 1505 Manutius produced plain texts in useful form, using the term "<a href="enchiridion">enchiridion</a>", meaning a manual or small, hand-held weapon. The <a href="octavo">octavo</a> was the first appearance of the editio minor, a straightforward text, established as well as the editor can manage. Although these new, portable books were not cheap, the books of the Aldine Press did not force upon their buyers a substantial investment that large volumes of text and commentary demanded during this era. The editio minor, instead, brought financial and logistical benefits to those interested in the classics. An individual didn't have to go to the book, rather now the book came along with them.

In 1501, Aldus used as his publisher's device, the image of a <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a> wrapped around an <a href="anchor">anchor</a>. "The dolphin and anchor device owed its origins, most immediately to Pietro Bembo. Aldus was to tell Erasmus six years later that Bembo had given him a silver coin minted under the Emperor Vesparian and bearing an image of this device" The image of the dolphin and anchor on the coin came with a saying, "Festina Lente" meaning "make haste slowly". This would become the motto for the Aldine Press.
<a href="Aldus%20Manutius">Aldus Manutius</a> the Elder died on February 6, 1515. After his death the firm was run by Andrea Torresani and his daughter, Maria, the widow of Aldus Manutius. The Aldine Press was named in 1508 as "In the House of Aldus and Andrea Torresano" which kept this name until 1529. In 1533, <a href="Paulus%20Manutius">Paulus Manutius</a> managed the firm, starting it up again and changing its name to "Heirs of Aldus and Andrea Torresano". In 1539 the imprint changed to "Sons of Aldo Manuzio". In 1567 <a href="Aldus%20Manutius%20the%20Younger">Aldus Manutius the Younger</a> continued the business until his death.

A partial list of publications from the Aldine Press cited from Aldus Manutius: A Legacy More Lasting than Bronze.

Works published from the Greeks. Manutius printed thirty editiones principes of Greek texts, allowing these texts to escape the fragility of the manuscript tradition.

<doc id="1583" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1583" title="Ealdred (archbishop of York)">
Ealdred (archbishop of York)

Ealdred (or Aldred; died 11 September 1069) was <a href="Abbot%20of%20Tavistock">Abbot of Tavistock</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a>, and <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a> in <a href="History%20of%20Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon England</a>. He was related to a number of other ecclesiastics of the period. After becoming a monk at the monastery at <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a>, he was appointed <a href="Abbot">Abbot</a> of <a href="Tavistock%20Abbey">Tavistock Abbey</a> in around 1027. In 1046 he was named to the Bishopric of Worcester. Ealdred, besides his episcopal duties, served <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>, the King of England, as a diplomat and as a military leader. He worked to bring one of the king's relatives, <a href="Edward%20the%20Exile">Edward the Exile</a>, back to England from Hungary to secure an heir for the childless king.

In 1058 he undertook a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the first bishop from England to do so. As administrator of the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Hereford">Diocese of Hereford</a>, he was involved in fighting against the Welsh, suffering two defeats at the hands of raiders before securing a settlement with <a href="Gruffydd%20ap%20Llywelyn">Gruffydd ap Llywelyn</a>, a Welsh ruler.

In 1060, Ealdred was elected to the archbishopric of York, but had difficulty in obtaining papal approval for his appointment, only managing to do so when he promised not to hold the bishoprics of York and Worcester simultaneously. He helped secure the election of <a href="Wulfstan%20%28Bishop%20of%20Worcester%29">Wulfstan</a> as his successor at Worcester. During his archiepiscopate, he built and embellished churches in his diocese, and worked to improve his clergy by holding a synod which published regulations for the priesthood.

Some sources state that following King Edward the Confessor's death in 1066, it was Ealdred who crowned <a href="Harold%20Godwinson">Harold Godwinson</a> as King of England. Ealdred supported Harold as king, but when Harold was defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a>, Ealdred backed <a href="Edgar%20the%20%C3%86theling">Edgar the Ætheling</a> and then endorsed King <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William the Conqueror</a>, the <a href="Duke%20of%20Normandy">Duke of Normandy</a> and a distant relative of King Edward's. Ealdred crowned King William on Christmas Day in 1066. William never quite trusted Ealdred or the other English leaders, and Ealdred had to accompany William back to Normandy in 1067, but he had returned to York by the time of his death in 1069. Ealdred supported the churches and monasteries in his diocese with gifts and building projects.

Ealdred was probably born in the west of England, and could be related to <a href="Lyfing%20of%20Winchester">Lyfing</a>, his predecessor as bishop of Worcester. His family, from Devonshire, may have been well-to-do. Another relative was Wilstan or Wulfstan, who under Ealdred's influence became <a href="Abbot%20of%20Gloucester">Abbot of Gloucester</a>. Ealdred was a monk in the <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> at <a href="Winchester%20Cathedral">Winchester Cathedral</a> before becoming abbot of Tavistock Abbey about 1027, an office he held until about 1043. Even after leaving the abbacy of Tavistock, he continued to hold two properties from the abbey until his death. No contemporary documents relating to Ealdred's time as abbot have been discovered.

Ealdred was made bishop of Worcester in 1046, a position he held until his resignation in 1062. He may have acted as <a href="Suffragan%20bishop">suffragan</a>, or subordinate bishop, to his predecessor Lyfing before formally assuming the bishopric, as from about 1043 Ealdred witnessed as an "episcopus", or bishop, and a charter from 1045 or early 1046 names Sihtric as abbot of Tavistock. Lyfing died on 26 March 1046, and Ealdred became bishop of Worcester shortly after. However, Ealdred did not receive the other two dioceses that Lyfing had held, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Crediton">Crediton</a> and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Cornwall">Cornwall</a>; King Edward the Confessor (reigned 1043–1066) granted these to <a href="Leofric%20%28bishop%29">Leofric</a>, who combined the two sees at Crediton in 1050.

Ealdred was an advisor to King Edward the Confessor, and was often involved in the royal government. He was also a military leader, and in 1046 he led an unsuccessful expedition against the Welsh. This was in retaliation for a raid led by the Welsh rulers <a href="Gruffydd%20ap%20Rhydderch">Gruffydd ap Rhydderch</a>, <a href="Rhys%20ap%20Rhydderch">Rhys ap Rhydderch</a>, and Gruffydd ap Llywelyn. Ealdred's expedition was betrayed by some Welsh soldiers who were serving with the English, and Ealdred was defeated.

In 1050, Ealdred went to Rome "on the king's errand", apparently to secure papal approval to move the seat, or centre, of the bishopric of Crediton to Exeter. It may also have been to secure the release of the king from a vow to go on pilgrimage, if sources from after the <a href="Norman%20Conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest of England</a> are to be believed. While in Rome, he attended a papal council, along with his fellow English bishop <a href="Herman%20%28bishop%29">Herman</a>. That same year, as Ealdred was returning to England he met <a href="Sweyn%20Godwinson">Sweyn</a>, a son of <a href="Godwin%2C%20Earl%20of%20Wessex">Godwin, Earl of Wessex</a>, and probably absolved Sweyn for having abducted the abbess of <a href="Leominster%20Abbey">Leominster Abbey</a> in 1046. Through Ealdred's intercession, Sweyn was restored to his earldom, which he had lost after abducting the abbess and murdering his cousin <a href="Beorn%20Estrithson">Beorn Estrithson</a>. Ealdred helped Sweyn not only because Ealdred was a supporter of Earl Godwin's family but because Sweyn's earldom was close to his bishopric. As recently as 1049 Irish raiders had allied with Gruffydd ap Rhydderch of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Gwent">Gwent</a> in raiding along the <a href="River%20Usk">River Usk</a>. Ealdred unsuccessfully tried to drive off the raiders, but was again routed by the Welsh. This failure underscored Ealdred's need for a strong earl in the area to protect against raids. Normally, the <a href="bishop%20of%20Hereford">bishop of Hereford</a> would have led the defence in the absence of an Earl of Hereford, but in 1049 the incumbent, <a href="%C3%86thelstan%20%28Bishop%20of%20Hereford%29">Æthelstan</a>, was blind, so Ealdred took on the role of defender.

Earl Godwin's rebellion against the king in 1051 came as a blow to Ealdred, who was a supporter of the earl and his family. Ealdred was present at the royal council at London that banished Godwin's family. Later in 1051, when he was sent to intercept Harold Godwinson and his brothers as they fled England after their father's outlawing, Ealdred "could not, or would not" capture the brothers. The banishment of Ealdred's patron came shortly after the death of <a href="%C3%86lfric%20Puttoc">Ælfric Puttoc</a>, the Archbishop of York. York and Worcester had long had close ties, and the two sees had often been held in <a href="Benefice">plurality</a>, or at the same time. Ealdred probably wanted to become Archbishop of York after Ælfric's death, but his patron's eclipse led to the king appointing <a href="Cynesige">Cynesige</a>, a royal chaplain, instead. In September 1052, though, Godwin returned from exile and his family was restored to power. By late 1053 Ealdred was once more in royal favour. At some point, he was alleged to have accompanied Swein on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but proof is lacking.

In 1054 King Edward sent Ealdred to Germany to obtain Emperor <a href="Henry%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry III</a>'s help in returning <a href="Edward%20the%20Exile">Edward the Exile</a>, son of <a href="Edmund%20Ironside">Edmund Ironside</a>, to England. Edmund (reigned 1016) was an elder half-brother of King Edward the Confessor, and Edmund's son Edward was in Hungary with King <a href="Andrew%20I%20of%20Hungary">Andrew I</a>, having left England as an infant after his father's death and the accession of <a href="Canute%20the%20Great">Cnut</a> as King of England. In this mission Ealdred was somewhat successful and obtained insight into the working of the German church during a stay of a year with <a href="Herman%20II%20%28Archbishop%20of%20Cologne%29">Hermann II</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Cologne">Archbishop of Cologne</a>. He also was impressed with the buildings he saw, and later incorporated some of the German styles into his own constructions. The main objective of the mission, however, was to secure the return of Edward; but this failed, mainly because Henry III's relations with the Hungarians were strained, and the emperor was unable or unwilling to help Ealdred. Ealdred was able to discover that Edward was alive, and had a place at the Hungarian court. Although some sources state that Ealdred attended the coronation of Emperor <a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry IV</a>, this is not possible, as on the date that Henry was crowned, Ealdred was in England consecrating an abbot.

Ealdred had returned to England by 1055, and brought with him a copy of the "<a href="Pontificale%20Romano-Germanicum">Pontificale Romano-Germanicum</a>", a <a href="Roman%20Pontifical">set of liturgies</a>, with him. An extant copy of this work, currently manuscript <a href="Cotton%20library">Cotton Vitellus E xii</a>, has been identified as a copy owned by Ealdred. It appears likely that the "<a href="Chrodegang%20of%20Metz">Rule of Chrodegang</a>", a continental set of ordinances for the communal life of <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">secular canons</a>, was introduced into England by Ealdred sometime before 1059. Probably he brought it back from Germany, possibly in concert with Harold.

After Ealdred's return to England he took charge of the sees of Hereford and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ramsbury%20%28ancient%29">Ramsbury</a>. Ealdred also administered <a href="Winchcombe%20Abbey">Winchcombe Abbey</a> and <a href="Gloucester%20Abbey">Gloucester Abbey</a>. The authors of the "Handbook of British Chronology Third Edition" say he was named bishop of Hereford in 1056, holding the see until he resigned it in 1060, but other sources say that he merely administered the see while it was vacant, or that he was bishop of Hereford from 1055 to 1060.

Ealdred became involved with the see of Ramsbury after its bishop <a href="Herman%20%28bishop%29">Herman</a> got into a dispute with King Edward over the movement of the seat of his bishopric to <a href="Malmesbury%20Abbey">Malmesbury Abbey</a>. Herman wished to move the seat of his see, but Edward refused permission for the move. Ealdred was a close associate of Herman's, and the historian <a href="H.%20R.%20Loyn">H. R. Loyn</a> called Herman "something of an alter ego" to Ealdred. According to the medieval chronicler <a href="John%20of%20Worcester">John of Worcester</a>, Ealdred was given the see of Ramsbury to administer while Herman remained outside England. Herman returned in 1058, and resumed his bishopric. There is no contemporary documentary evidence of Ealdred's administration of Ramsbury.

The king again employed Ealdred as a diplomat in 1056, when he assisted earls Harold and Leofric in negotiations with the Welsh. Edward sent Ealdred after the death in battle of Bishop <a href="Leofgar%20of%20Hereford">Leofgar of Hereford</a>, who had attacked Gruffydd ap Llywelyn after encouragement from the king. However, Leofgar lost the battle and his life, and Edward had to sue for peace. Although details of the negotiations are lacking, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn swore loyalty to King Edward, but the oath may not have had any obligations on Gruffydd's part to Edward. The exact terms of the submission are not known in total, but Gruffydd was not required to assist Edward in war nor attend Edward's court. Ealdred was rewarded with the administration of the see of Hereford, which he held until 1061, and was appointed Archbishop of York. The diocese had suffered a serious raid from the Welsh in 1055, and during his administration, Ealdred continued the rebuilding of the cathedral church as well as securing the cathedral chapter's rights. Ealdred was granted the administration in order that the area might have someone with experience with the Welsh in charge.

In 1058 Ealdred made a pilgrimage to <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, the first English bishop to make the journey. He travelled through Hungary, and the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" stated that "he went to Jerusalem in such state as no-one had done before him". While in Jerusalem he made a gift of a gold chalice to the <a href="church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Sepulchre">church of the Holy Sepulchre</a>. It is possible that the reason Ealdred travelled through Hungary was to arrange the travel of Edward the Exile's family to England. Another possibility is that he wished to search for other possible heirs to King Edward in Hungary. It is not known exactly when Edward the Exile's family returned to England, whether they returned with Edward in 1057, or sometime later, so it is only a possibility that they returned with Ealdred in 1058.

Very little documentary evidence is available from Ealdred's time as Bishop of Worcester. Only five leases that he signed survive, and all date from 1051 to 1053. Two further leases exist in "<a href="Hemming%27s%20Cartulary">Hemming's Cartulary</a>" as copies only. How the <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Worcester">diocese of Worcester</a> was administered when Ealdred was abroad is unclear, although it appears that <a href="Wulfstan%20%28Bishop%20of%20Worcester%29">Wulfstan</a>, the prior of the <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a>, performed the religious duties in the diocese. On the financial side, the "<a href="Chronicon%20Abbatiae%20de%20Evesham">Evesham Chronicle</a>" states that <a href="%C3%86thelwig">Æthelwig</a>, who became abbot of <a href="Evesham%20Abbey">Evesham Abbey</a> in 1058, administered Worcester before he became abbot.

Cynesige, the archbishop of York, died on 22 December 1060, and Ealdred was elected <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a> on Christmas Day, 1060. Although a bishop was promptly appointed to Hereford, none was named to Worcester, and it appears that Ealdred intended to retain Worcester along with York, which several of his predecessors had done. There were a few reasons for this, one of which was political, as the kings of England preferred to appoint bishops from the south to the northern bishoprics, hoping to counter the northern tendency towards separatism. Another reason was that York was not a wealthy see, and Worcester was. Holding Worcester along with York allowed the archbishop sufficient revenue to support himself.

In 1061 Ealdred travelled to Rome to receive the <a href="pallium">pallium</a>, the symbol of an archbishop's authority. Journeying with him was <a href="Tostig%20Godwinson">Tostig</a>, another son of Earl Godwin, who was now earl of <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>. William of Malmesbury says that Ealdred, by "amusing the simplicity of King Edward and alleging the custom of his predecessors, had acquired, more by bribery than by reason, the archbishopric of York while still holding his former see." On his arrival in Rome, however, charges of <a href="simony">simony</a>, or the buying of ecclesiastical office, and lack of learning were brought against him, and his elevation to York was refused by <a href="Pope%20Nicholas%20II">Pope Nicholas II</a>, who also deposed him from Worcester. The story of Ealdred being deposed comes from the "Vita Edwardi", a life of Edward the Confessor, but the "Vita Wulfstani", an account of the life of Ealdred's successor at Worcester, <a href="Wulfstan%20%28Bishop%20of%20Worcester%29">Wulfstan</a>, says that Nicholas refused the pallium until a promise to find a replacement for Worcester was given by Ealdred. Yet another chronicler, John of Worcester, mentions nothing of any trouble in Rome, and when discussing the appointment of Wulfstan, says that Wulfstan was elected freely and unanimously by the clergy and people. John of Worcester also claims that at Wulfstan's consecration, <a href="Stigand">Stigand</a>, the archbishop of Canterbury extracted a promise from Ealdred that neither he nor his successors would lay claim to any jurisdiction over the diocese of Worcester. Given that John of Worcester wrote his chronicle after the eruption of the Canterbury–York supremacy struggle, the story of Ealdred renouncing any claims to Worcester needs to be considered suspect.

For whatever reason, Ealdred gave up the see of Worcester in 1062, when papal legates arrived in England to hold a council and make sure that Ealdred relinquished Worcester. This happened at Easter in 1062. Ealdred was succeeded by Wulfstan, chosen by Ealdred, but John of Worcester relates that Ealdred had a hard time deciding between Wulfstan and Æthelwig. The legates had urged the selection of Wulfstan because of his saintliness. Because the position of Stigand, the archbishop of Canterbury, was irregular, Wulfstan sought and received consecration as a bishop from Ealdred. Normally, Wulfstan would have gone to the archbishop of Canterbury, as the see of Worcester was within Canterbury's province. Although Ealdred gave up the bishopric, the appointment of Wulfstan was one that allowed Ealdred to continue his considerable influence on the see of Worcester. Ealdred retained a number of estates belonging to Worcester. Even after the Norman Conquest, Ealdred still controlled some events in Worcester, and it was Ealdred, not Wulfstan, who opposed <a href="Urse%20d%27Abetot">Urse d'Abetot</a>'s attempt to extend the castle of Worcester into the cathedral after the Norman Conquest.

While archbishop, Ealdred built at <a href="Beverley">Beverley</a>, expanding on the building projects begun by his predecessor Cynesige, as well as repairing and expanding other churches in his diocese. He also built refectories for the canons at York and Southwell. He also was the one bishop that published ecclesiastical legislation during Edward the Confessor's reign, attempting to discipline and reform the clergy. He held a synod of his clergy shortly before 1066.

John of Worcester, a medieval chronicler, stated that Ealdred crowned King Harold II in 1066, although the <a href="Normans">Norman</a> chroniclers mention Stigand as the officiating prelate. Given Ealdred's known support of Godwin's family, John of Worcester is probably correct. Stigand's position as archbishop was canonically suspect, and as earl Harold had not allowed Stigand to consecrate one of the earl's churches, it is unlikely that Harold would have allowed Stigand to perform the much more important royal coronation. Arguments for Stigand having performed the coronation, however, rely on the fact that no other English source names the ecclesiastic who performed the ceremony; all Norman sources name Stigand as the presider. In all events, Ealdred and Harold were close, and Ealdred supported Harold's bid to become king. Ealdred perhaps accompanied Harold when the new king went to York and secured the support of the northern magnates shortly after Harold's consecration.

According to the medieval chronicler <a href="Geoffrey%20Gaimar">Geoffrey Gaimar</a>, after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stamford%20Bridge">Battle of Stamford Bridge</a> Harold entrusted the loot gained from <a href="Harald%20III%20of%20Norway">Harold Hardrada</a> to Ealdred. Gaimar asserts that King Harold did this because he had heard of Duke William's landing in England, and needed to rush south to counter it. After the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate Edgar the Ætheling, Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted to William the Conqueror at <a href="Berkhamsted">Berkhamsted</a>. John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated over what to do while William ravaged the countryside, which led to Ealdred and Edgar's submission to William.

Ealdred crowned William king on <a href="Christmas">Christmas Day</a> 1066. An innovation in William's coronation ceremony was that before the actual crowning, Ealdred asked the assembled crowd, in English, if it was their wish that William be crowned king. The <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Coutances">Bishop of Coutances</a> then did the same, but in <a href="Norman%20language">Norman French</a>. In March 1067, William took Ealdred with him when William returned to <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, along with the other English leaders Earl <a href="Edwin%2C%20Earl%20of%20Mercia">Edwin of Mercia</a>, Earl <a href="Morcar">Morcar</a>, Edgar the Ætheling, and Archbishop Stigand. Ealdred at <a href="Whitsun">Whitsun</a> 1068 performed the coronation of <a href="Matilda%20of%20Flanders">Matilda</a>, William's wife. The "<a href="Laudes%20Regiae">Laudes Regiae</a>", or song commending a ruler, that was performed at Matilda's coronation may have been composed by Ealdred himself for the occasion. In 1069, when the northern <a href="thegn">thegn</a>s rebelled against William and attempted to install Edgar the Ætheling as king, Ealdred continued to support William. He was the only northern leader to support William, however. Ealdred was back at York by 1069; he died there on 11 September 1069, and was buried in his episcopal cathedral. He may have taken an active part in trying to calm the rebellions in the north in 1068 and 1069. The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury records a story that when the new sheriff of Worcester, Urse d'Abetot, encroached on the cemetery of the cathedral chapter for <a href="Worcester%20Cathedral">Worcester Cathedral</a>, Ealdred pronounced a rhyming curse on him, saying "Thou are called Urse. May you have God's curse."

After Ealdred's death, one of the restraints on William's treatment of the English was removed. Ealdred was one of a few native Englishmen who William appears to have trusted, and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate Englishmen into the administration, although such efforts did not entirely stop. In 1070, a church council was held at Westminster and a number of bishops were deposed. By 1073 there were only two Englishmen in episcopal sees, and by the time of William's death in 1089, there was only one, Wulfstan II of Worcester.

Ealdred did much to restore discipline in the monasteries and churches under his authority, and was liberal with gifts to the churches of his diocese. He built the monastic church of St Peter at <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a> (now <a href="Gloucester%20Cathedral">Gloucester Cathedral</a>, though nothing of his fabric remains), then part of his diocese of Worcester. He also repaired a large part of <a href="Beverley%20Minster">Beverley Minster</a> in the diocese of York, adding a <a href="Presbytery%20%28architecture%29">presbytery</a> and an unusually splendid painted ceiling covering "all the upper part of the church from the choir to the tower...intermingled with gold in various ways, and in a wonderful fashion". He added a pulpit "in German style" of bronze, gold and silver, surmounted by an arch with a <a href="rood">rood</a> cross in the same materials; these were examples of the lavish decorations added to important churches in the years before the conquest.

Ealdred encouraged Folcard, a monk of <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury</a>, to write the "Life" of Saint <a href="John%20of%20Beverley">John of Beverley</a>. This was part of Ealdred's promotion of the cult of Saint John, who had only been canonised in 1037. Along with the "Pontificale", Ealdred may have brought back from Cologne the first manuscript of the "<a href="Cambridge%20Songs">Cambridge Songs</a>" to enter England, a collection of Latin <a href="Goliard">Goliard</a>ic songs which became famous in the Middle Ages. The historian Michael Lapidge suggests that the "Laudes Regiae", which are included in Cotton Vitellius E xii, might have been composed by Ealdred, or a member of his household. Another historian, H. J. Cowdrey, argued that the "laudes" were composed at Winchester. These praise songs are probably the same performed at Matilda's coronation, but might have been used at other court ceremonies before Ealdred's death.

Historians have seen Ealdred as an "old-fashioned prince-bishop". Others say that he "raised the see of York from its former rustic state". He was known for his generosity and for his diplomatic and administrative abilities. After the Conquest, Ealdred provided a degree of continuity between the pre- and post-Conquest worlds. One modern historian feels that it was Ealdred who was behind the compilation of the D version of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", and gives a date in the 1050s as its composition. Certainly, Ealdred is one of the leading figures in the work, and it is likely that one of his clerks compiled the version.

Alexander I of Epirus

Alexander I of <a href="Epirotes">Epirus</a> (, 370 BC – 331 BC), also known as Alexander <a href="Molossians">Molossus</a> (), was a king of <a href="Epirus%20%28ancient%20state%29">Epirus</a> (350–331 BC) of the <a href="Aeacides%20of%20Epirus">Aeacid dynasty</a>.

As the son of <a href="Neoptolemus%20I%20of%20Epirus">Neoptolemus I</a> and brother of <a href="Olympias">Olympias</a>, Alexander I was an uncle of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>. He was also an uncle of <a href="Pyrrhus%20of%20Epirus">Pyrrhus of Epirus</a>. He was brought at an early age to the court of <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a>, and after the Hellenic fashion became the object of his attachment. At the age of about 20, Philip made him king of Epirus, after dethroning his uncle <a href="Arybbas%20of%20Epirus">Arybbas</a>.

When Olympias was repudiated by her husband, 337 BC, she went to her brother, and endeavoured to induce him to make war on Philip.

Alexander, however, declined the contest, and formed a second alliance with Philip by taking to wife the daughter of Philip (Alexander's niece) <a href="Cleopatra%20of%20Macedonia">Cleopatra</a> in marriage (336 BC). At the wedding Philip was assassinated by <a href="Pausanias%20of%20Orestis">Pausanias of Orestis</a>.

In 334 BC, Alexander I, at the request of the Greek colony of <a href="Taranto">Taras</a> (in <a href="Magna%20Graecia">Magna Graecia</a>), crossed over into <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, to aid them in battle against several <a href="Ancient%20Italic%20peoples">Italic tribes</a>, the <a href="Lucanians">Lucanians</a> and <a href="Bruttii">Bruttii</a>. After a victory over the <a href="Samnium">Samnites</a> and Lucanians near <a href="Paestum">Paestum</a>, 332 BC, he made a treaty with the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Romans</a>. Success still followed his arms. He took <a href="Heraclea%20%28Lucania%29">Heraclea</a> from the Lucanians, and <a href="Terina%20%28ancient%20city%29">Terina</a> and <a href="Siponto">Sipontum</a> from the Bruttii. Through the treachery of some Lucanian exiles, he was compelled to engage under unfavourable circumstances in the <a href="battle%20of%20Pandosia">battle of Pandosia</a> and was killed by a Lucanian. He left a son, <a href="Neoptolemus%20II%20of%20Epirus">Neoptolemus</a>, and a daughter, Cadmea.

In a famous passage that is often considered the first specimen of <a href="Counterfactual%20history">alternative history</a>, <a href="Livy">Livy</a> speculates on what would have been the outcome of a military showdown between <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> and the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a>. He reports there that as Alexander of Epirus lay mortally wounded on the battlefield at Pandosia he compared his fortunes to those of his famous nephew and said that the latter "waged war against women".

Alexander Balas

Alexander I Balas (), was the ruler of the <a href="Greece">Greek</a> <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid kingdom</a> in 150–146 BC. Alexander defeated his brother <a href="Demetrius%20Soter">Demetrius Soter</a> for the crown in 150 BC. Ruling briefly, he lost the crown to his brother during his defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Antioch%20%28145%20BC%29">Battle of Antioch (145 BC)</a> in Syria, dying shortly after.

He is the title character of the <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a> "<a href="Alexander%20Balus">Alexander Balus</a>", written in 1747 by <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a>.

He was a native of <a href="%C4%B0zmir">Smyrna</a> of humble origin, but gave himself out to be the son of <a href="Antiochus%20IV%20Epiphanes">Antiochus IV Epiphanes</a> and <a href="Laodice%20IV">Laodice IV</a> and heir to the Seleucid throne. Along with his sister <a href="Laodice%20VI">Laodice VI</a>, the youngster Alexander was "discovered" by Heracleides, a former minister of Antiochus IV and brother of <a href="Timarchus">Timarchus</a>, an usurper in <a href="Medes">Media</a> who had been executed by the reigning king <a href="Demetrius%20I%20of%20Syria">Demetrius I Soter</a>.

Alexander's claims were recognized by the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a>, <a href="Ptolemy%20VI%20of%20Egypt">Ptolemy Philometor of Egypt</a> and others. He married <a href="Cleopatra%20Thea">Cleopatra Thea</a>, a daughter of the <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic dynasty</a>. At first unsuccessful, Alexander finally defeated Demetrius Soter in 150 BC. Being now master of the empire, he is said to have abandoned himself to a life of debauchery. Whatever the truth behind this, the young king was forced to depend heavily on his Ptolemaic support and even struck portraits with the characteristic features of king <a href="Ptolemy%20I">Ptolemy I</a>.

Demetrius Soter's son <a href="Demetrius%20II%20of%20Syria">Demetrius II</a> profited by the opportunity to regain the throne. Ptolemy Philometor, who was Alexander's father-in-law, went over to his side, and Alexander was defeated in the <a href="battle%20of%20Antioch%20%28145%20BC%29">battle of Antioch (145 BC)</a> in Syria, sometimes known as the battle of the Oenoparus.

He fled for refuge to a <a href="Nabataea">Nabataea</a>n prince, who murdered him and sent his head to Ptolemy Philometor, who had been mortally wounded in the engagement.

<doc id="1587" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1587" title="Alexander of Pherae">
Alexander of Pherae

Alexander () was "<a href="Tagus%20%28title%29">tagus</a>" or <a href="despotism">despot</a> of <a href="Pherae">Pherae</a> in <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>, and ruled from 369 BC to 358 BC.

The accounts of how he came to power vary somewhat in minor points. <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a> tells us that upon the assassination of the tyrant <a href="Jason%20of%20Pherae">Jason of Pherae</a>, in 370 BC, his brother Polydorus ruled for a year, but he was then poisoned by Alexander, another brother. However, according to <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a>, Polydorus was murdered by his brother Polyphron, who was, in turn, murdered by his nephew Alexander —son of Jason, in 369 BC. <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> relates that Alexander worshiped the spear he slew his uncle with as if it were a god. Alexander governed tyrannically, and according to <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus</a>, differently from the former rulers, but Polyphron, at least, seems to have set him the example. The states of <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>, which had previously acknowledged the authority of <a href="Jason%20of%20Pherae">Jason of Pherae</a>, were not so willing to submit to Alexander the tyrant, (especially the old family of the <a href="Aleuadae">Aleuadae</a> of <a href="Larissa">Larissa</a>, who had most reason to fear him). Therefore, they applied for help from <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Macedon">Alexander II of Macedon</a>.

Alexander of Pherae prepared to meet his enemy in <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>ia, but the king anticipated him, and, reaching <a href="Larissa">Larissa</a>, was admitted into the city. Alexander withdrew to <a href="Pherae">Pherae</a> whilst the Macedonian King placed a garrison in Larissa, as well as in <a href="Crannon">Crannon</a>, which had also come over to him. But once the bulk of the Macedonian army had retired, the states of Thessaly feared the return and vengeance of Alexander, and so sent for aid to <a href="Thebes%20%28Greece%29">Thebes</a>, whose policy it was to put a check on any neighbor who might otherwise become too formidable. Thebes accordingly dispatched <a href="Pelopidas">Pelopidas</a> to the aid of Thessaly. On arrival of Pelopidas at Larissa, whence according to Diodorus, he dislodged the Macedonian garrison, Alexander presented himself and offered submission. When Pelopidas expressed indignation at the tales of Alexander's profligacy and cruelty, Alexander took alarm and fled.

These events appear to refer to the early part of the year 368 BC. In the summer of that year Pelopidas was again sent into <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>, in consequence of fresh complaints against Alexander. Accompanied by <a href="Ismenias">Ismenias</a>, he went merely as a negotiator, without any military force, and was seized by Alexander and thrown into prison. The scholar <a href="William%20Mitford">William Mitford</a> suggested that Pelopidas was taken prisoner in battle, but the language of <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a> hardly supports such an inference. The Thebans sent a large army into Thessaly to rescue Pelopidas, but they could not keep the field against the superior cavalry of Alexander, who, aided by auxiliaries from <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, pursued them with great slaughter. The destruction of the whole Theban army is said to only have been averted by the ability of <a href="Epaminondas">Epaminondas</a>, who was serving in the campaign, but not as general.

In 367 BC, Alexander carried out a massacre of the citizens of <a href="Skotousa">Skotousa</a>;. A fresh Theban expedition into <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>, under <a href="Epaminondas">Epaminondas</a> resulted, according to <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, in a three-year truce and the release of prisoners, including Pelopidas. During the next three years, Alexander seemed to renew his attempts to subdue the states of Thessaly, especially <a href="Magnesia%20%28regional%20unit%29">Magnesia</a> and <a href="Phthiotis">Phthiotis</a>, for upon the expiry of the truce, in 364 BC, they again applied to Thebes for protection from him. The Theban army under Pelopidas is said to have been dismayed by an <a href="eclipse">eclipse</a> (on July 13, 364, see <a href="List%20of%20solar%20eclipses%20in%20the%204th%20century%20BC">4th century BC eclipses</a>), and Pelopidas, leaving the bulk of his army behind, entered Thessaly at the head of three hundred volunteer horsemen and some mercenaries. At <a href="Battle%20of%20Cynoscephalae">Cynoscephalae</a>, the Thebans defeated Alexander, but Pelopidas was killed. This was closely followed by another Theban victory under Malcites and Diogiton. Alexander was then forced to restore the conquered towns to the Thessalians, confine himself to Pherae, join the <a href="Boeotian%20League">Boeotian League</a>, and become a dependent ally of <a href="Thebes%20%28Greece%29">Thebes</a>.

If the death of <a href="Epaminondas">Epaminondas</a> in 362 BC freed Athens from fear of Thebes, it appears at the same time to have exposed it to further aggression from Alexander of Pherae, who made a <a href="piracy">piratical</a> raid on <a href="Tinos">Tinos</a> and other cities of the <a href="Cyclades">Cyclades</a>, plundering them, and making slaves of the inhabitants. He also besieged <a href="Peparethus">Peparethus</a>, and "even landed troops in Attica itself, and seized the port of Panormus, a little eastward of <a href="Sounion">Sounion</a>." The Athenian admiral <a href="Leosthenes">Leosthenes</a> defeated Alexander and managed to relieve Peparethus, but Alexander escaped from being blockaded in Panormus, took several Attic <a href="trireme">trireme</a>s, and plundered the <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>.

The murder of Alexander is assigned by <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus</a> to 357/356 BC. <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> gives a detailed account of it, with a lively picture of the palace. Guards watched throughout the night, except at Alexander's bedchamber, which was at the top of a ladder with a ferocious chained dog guarding the door. Thebe, Alexander's wife and cousin (or half-sister, as the daughter of <a href="Jason%20of%20Pherae">Jason of Pherae</a>), concealed her three brothers in the house during the day, had the dog removed when Alexander had gone to rest, and, having covered the steps of the ladder with wool, brought up the young men to her husband's chamber. Though she had taken away Alexander's sword, they feared to set about the deed until she threatened to wake him. Her brothers then entered and killed Alexander. His body was cast into the streets, and exposed to every indignity.

Of Thebe's motive for the murder different accounts are given. <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> states it to have been fear of her husband, together with hatred of his cruel and brutal character, and ascribes these feelings principally to the representations of Pelopidas, when she visited him in his prison. In <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> the deed is ascribed to jealousy. Other accounts have it that Alexander had taken Thebe's youngest brother as his <a href="eromenos">eromenos</a> and tied him up. Exasperated by his wife's pleas to release the youth, he murdered the boy, which drove her to revenge.
It is written in <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>'s Second Oration On the Fortune or the Virtue of Alexander the Great (see "<a href="Moralia">Moralia</a>"), and in <a href="Claudius%20Aelianus">Claudius Aelianus</a>' <a href="Claudius%20Aelianus%23Varia%20Historia">"Varia Historia"</a> that Alexander Pherae left a tragedy in a theatre because he did not wish to weep at fiction when unmoved by his own cruelty. This suggests that while Alexander was a tyrant, perhaps his iron heart could be softened. The actor was threatened with punishment because Alexander was so moved while watching.

Alexander II of Epirus

Alexander II was a king of <a href="Epirus%20%28ancient%20state%29">Epirus</a>, and the son of <a href="Pyrrhus%20of%20Epirus">Pyrrhus</a> and <a href="Lanassa%20%28wife%20of%20Pyrrhus%29">Lanassa</a>, the daughter of the Sicilian tyrant <a href="Agathocles%20of%20Syracuse">Agathocles</a>.

He succeeded his father as king in 272 BC, and continued the war which his father had begun with <a href="Antigonus%20II%20Gonatas">Antigonus II Gonatas</a>, whom he succeeded in driving from the kingdom of <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>.
He was, however, dispossessed of both <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a> and <a href="Epirus%20%28ancient%20state%29">Epirus</a> by <a href="Demetrius%20II%20of%20Macedon">Demetrius II of Macedon</a>, the son of Antigonus II; upon which he took refuge amongst the <a href="Acarnania">Acarnania</a>ns. By their assistance and that of his own subjects, who entertained a great attachment for him, he recovered Epirus. It appears that he was in alliance with the <a href="Aetolia">Aetolia</a>ns. 

Alexander married his paternal half-sister <a href="Olympias%20II%20of%20Epirus">Olympias</a>, by whom he had two sons, <a href="Pyrrhus%20II%20of%20Epirus">Pyrrhus</a>, <a href="Ptolemy%20of%20Epirus">Ptolemy</a> and a daughter, <a href="Phthia%20of%20Macedon">Phthia</a>. On the death of Alexander, around 242 BC, Olympias assumed the regency on behalf of her sons, and married Phthia to Demetrius. 
There are extant silver and copper coins of this king.

Alexander Jagiellon

Alexander I Jagiellon (; ) (5 August 1461 – 19 August 1506) of the <a href="House%20of%20Jagiellon">House of Jagiellon</a> was the Grand Duke of <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> and later also King of <a href="Poland">Poland</a>. He was the fourth son of <a href="Casimir%20IV%20Jagiellon">Casimir IV Jagiellon</a>. He was elected Grand Duke of Lithuania on the death of his father (1492), and King of Poland on the death of his brother <a href="John%20I%20Albert">John I Albert</a> (1501).

Alexander was born as son of the King <a href="Casimir%20IV%20Jagiellon">Casimir IV Jagiellon</a> of <a href="Poland">Poland</a> and <a href="Elisabeth%20of%20Austria%20%28d.%201505%29">Elisabeth Habsburg of Hungary</a>, daughter of the King <a href="Albert%20of%20Hungary">Albert of Hungary</a>. Alexander's shortage of funds immediately made him subservient to the Polish Senate and nobility (<a href="szlachta">szlachta</a>), who deprived him of control of the mint (then one of the most lucrative sources of revenue for the Polish kings), curtailed his prerogatives, and generally endeavored to reduce him to a subordinate position. For want of funds, Alexander was unable to resist the Grand Master of the <a href="Teutonic%20Knights">Teutonic Knights</a> or prevent Grand Duke of Muscovy <a href="Ivan%20III%20of%20Russia">Ivan III</a> from ravaging <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a> with the <a href="Tatars">Tatars</a>. The most the Grand Duke of Lithuania could do was to garrison <a href="Smolensk">Smolensk</a> and other strongholds and employ his wife Helena, the Tsar's daughter, to mediate a truce between his father-in-law and himself after the disastrous <a href="Battle%20of%20Vedrosha">Battle of Vedrosha</a> (1500). In the terms of the truce, Lithuania had to surrender about a third of its territory to the nascent expansionist Russian state.

During his reign, Poland suffered much humiliation at the hands of her subject principality, <a href="Moldavia">Moldavia</a>. Only the death of <a href="Stephen%20III%20of%20Moldavia">Stephen</a>, the great "<a href="hospodar">hospodar</a>" of Moldavia, enabled Poland still to hold her own on the <a href="Danube%20River">Danube River</a>; while the liberality of <a href="Pope%20Julius%20II">Pope Julius II</a>, who issued no fewer than 29 bulls in favor of Poland and granted Alexander <a href="Peter%27s%20Pence">Peter's Pence</a> and other financial help, enabled him to restrain somewhat the arrogance of the Teutonic Order.

Alexander Jagellon never felt at home in Poland, and bestowed his favor principally upon his fellow Lithuanians, the most notable of whom was the wealthy Lithuanian magnate <a href="Michael%20Glinski">Michael Glinski</a>, who justified his master's confidence by his great victory over the Tatars at <a href="Kleck">Kleck</a> (5 August 1506), news of which was brought to Alexander on his deathbed in <a href="Vilnius">Vilnius</a>.

It is important to note that Alexander was the last known ruler of the <a href="Gediminids">Gediminids</a> dynasty to have maintained the family's ancestral <a href="Lithuanian%20language">Lithuanian language</a>. From his death, Polish became the sole language of the family, thus fully <a href="Polonisation">Polonising</a> the <a href="Jagiello">Jagiello</a> family.

<doc id="1592" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1592" title="Alexander III of Russia">
Alexander III of Russia

Alexander III (; 1845 1894) was the <a href="Emperor%20of%20Russia%23Emperors%20of%20Russia">Emperor</a> of <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a>, <a href="King%20of%20Poland">King of Poland</a>, and <a href="Grand%20Duke%20of%20Finland">Grand Duke of Finland</a> from until his death on . He was highly <a href="conservative">conservative</a> and reversed some of the liberal reforms of his father, <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II</a>. During Alexander's reign Russia fought no major wars, for which he was styled "The Peacemaker" ().

Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich was born on 10 March 1845 at the <a href="Winter%20Palace">Winter Palace</a> in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, the second son and third child of <a href="Emperor%20of%20Russia%23Emperors%20of%20Russia">Emperor</a> <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II of Russia</a> and his first wife <a href="Marie%20of%20Hesse">Marie of Hesse</a>.

In disposition Alexander bore little resemblance to his soft-hearted, liberal father, and still less to his refined, philosophic, sentimental, chivalrous, yet cunning great-uncle, Emperor <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia">Alexander I of Russia</a>, who could have been given the title of "the first gentleman of <a href="Europe">Europe</a>". Although an enthusiastic amateur musician and patron of the <a href="ballet">ballet</a>, Alexander was seen as lacking refinement and elegance. Indeed, he rather relished the idea of being of the same rough texture as some of his subjects. His straightforward, abrupt manner savoured sometimes of gruffness, while his direct, unadorned method of expressing himself harmonized well with his rough-hewn, immobile features and somewhat sluggish movements. His education was not such as to soften these peculiarities. More than six feet tall (about 1.9 m), he was also noted for his immense physical strength. A <a href="sebaceous%20cyst">sebaceous cyst</a> on the left side of his nose caused him to be mocked by some of his contemporaries, and he sat for photographs and portraits with the right side of his face most prominent.

An account from the memoirs of the artist <a href="Alexander%20Benois">Alexander Benois</a> gives one impression of Alexander III:

After a performance of the ballet "<a href="Tsar%20Kandavl%20or%20Le%20Roi%20Candaule">Tsar Kandavl</a>" at the <a href="Mariinsky%20Theatre">Mariinsky Theatre</a>, I first caught sight of the Emperor. I was struck by the size of the man, and although cumbersome and heavy, he was still a mighty figure. There was indeed something of the <a href="muzhik">muzhik</a> "[Russian peasant]" about him. The look of his bright eyes made quite an impression on me. As he passed where I was standing, he raised his head for a second, and to this day I can remember what I felt as our eyes met. It was a look as cold as steel, in which there was something threatening, even frightening, and it struck me like a blow. The Tsar's gaze! The look of a man who stood above all others, but who carried a monstrous burden and who every minute had to fear for his life and the lives of those closest to him. In later years I came into contact with the Emperor on several occasions, and I felt not the slightest bit timid. In more ordinary cases Tsar Alexander III could be at once kind, simple, and even almost homely.

Though he was destined to be a strongly counter-reforming emperor, Alexander had little prospect of succeeding to the throne during the first two decades of his life, as he had an elder brother, <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Nicholas%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">Nicholas</a>, who seemed of robust constitution. Even when Nicholas first displayed symptoms of delicate health, the notion that he might die young was never taken seriously, and he was betrothed to <a href="Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%20%28Maria%20Feodorovna%29">Princess Dagmar of Denmark</a>, daughter of <a href="King%20Christian%20IX%20of%20Denmark">King Christian IX of Denmark</a> and <a href="Louise%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Queen Louise of Denmark</a>, and whose siblings included <a href="Frederick%20VIII%20of%20Denmark">King Frederick VIII of Denmark</a>, <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Alexandra, Queen of the United Kingdom</a> and <a href="King%20George%20I%20of%20Greece">King George I of Greece</a>. Great solicitude was devoted to the education of Nicholas as <a href="tsesarevich">tsesarevich</a>, whereas Alexander received only the training of an ordinary Grand Duke of that period. This included acquaintance with <a href="French%20language">French</a>, <a href="English%20language">English</a> and <a href="German%20language">German</a>, and <a href="military%20drill">military drill</a>.

Alexander became <a href="Tsesarevich">Tsesarevich</a> upon Nicholas's sudden death in 1865; it was then that he began to study the principles of law and administration under <a href="Konstantin%20Pobedonostsev">Konstantin Pobedonostsev</a>, then a professor of <a href="Civil%20law%20%28legal%20system%29">civil law</a> at <a href="Moscow%20State%20University">Moscow State University</a> and later (from 1880) <a href="chief%20procurator">chief procurator</a> of the <a href="Holy%20Synod">Holy Synod</a> of the Orthodox Church in Russia. Pobedonostsev instilled into the young man's mind the belief that zeal for <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox</a> thought was an essential factor of Russian <a href="patriotism">patriotism</a> to be cultivated by every right-minded emperor. While he was <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a> from 1865 to 1881 Alexander did not play a prominent part in public affairs, but allowed it to become known that he had ideas which did not coincide with the principles of the existing government.

On his deathbed the previous tsesarevich was said to have expressed the wish that his fiancée, Princess Dagmar of Denmark, should marry his successor. This wish was swiftly realized when on in the <a href="Grand%20Church%20of%20the%20Winter%20Palace">Grand Church of the Winter Palace</a> in <a href="St.%20Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a>, Alexander wed Dagmar, who converted to Orthodox Christianity and took the name <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Maria Feodorovna</a>. The union proved a happy one to the end; unlike his father's, there was no adultery in his marriage. The couple spent their wedding night at the Tsesarevich's private dacha known as "My Property".

Later on the Tsesarevich became estranged from his father; this was due to their vastly differing political views, as well was his resentment towards Alexander II's long-standing relationship with <a href="Catherine%20Dolgorukov">Catherine Dolgorukov</a> (with whom he had several illegitimate children) while his mother, the <a href="Marie%20Alexandrovna%2C%20Tsarina%20of%20Russia">Empress</a>, was suffering from chronic ill-health. To the scandal of many at court, including the Tsesarevich himself, Alexander II married Catherine a mere month after Marie Alexandrovna's death in 1880.

On 1 March 1881 (O.S.) Alexander's father, <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II</a>, was assassinated by members of the <a href="terrorism">terrorist</a> organization <a href="Narodnaya%20Volya">Narodnaya Volya</a>. As a result, he ascended to the Russian imperial throne in <a href="Ninasi">Nennal</a> on 13 March 1881. He and Maria Feodorovna were officially crowned and anointed at the <a href="Assumption%20Cathedral%20in%20Moscow">Assumption Cathedral in Moscow</a> on 27 May 1883.

On the day of his assassination Alexander II had signed an <a href="ukaz">ukaz</a> setting up consultative commissions to advise the monarch. On ascending to the throne, however, Alexander III took <a href="Pobedonostsev">Pobedonostsev</a>'s advice and canceled the policy before its publication. He made it clear that his <a href="autocracy">autocracy</a> would not be limited.

All of Alexander III's internal reforms aimed to reverse the liberalization that had occurred in his father's reign. The new Emperor believed that remaining true to Russian <a href="Orthodoxy%2C%20Autocracy%2C%20and%20Nationality">Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality</a> (the ideology introduced by his grandfather, emperor <a href="Nicholas%20I%20of%20Russia">Nicholas I</a>) would save Russia from revolutionary agitation. Alexander's political ideal was a nation composed of a single nationality, language, and religion, as well as one form of administration. He attempted to realize this by the institution of mandatory teaching of the <a href="Russian%20language">Russian language</a> throughout the empire, including to his <a href="Germans%20in%20Russia">German</a>, <a href="Poles">Polish</a>, and other non-Russian subjects (with the exception of the <a href="Finns">Finns</a>), by the patronization of <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a>y, by the destruction of the remnants of German, Polish, and <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a> institutions in the respective provinces, and by the weakening of <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> through persecution of the <a href="Jew">Jew</a>s. The latter policy was implemented in the "<a href="May%20Laws">May Laws</a>" of 1882, which banned Jews from inhabiting rural areas and <a href="shtetl">shtetl</a>s (even within the <a href="Pale%20of%20Settlement">Pale of Settlement</a>) and restricted the occupations in which they could engage.

Alexander weakened the power of the "<a href="zemstvo">zemstvo</a>" (elective local administrative bodies resembling British <a href="Parish%20councils%20in%20England">parish council</a>s) and placed the administration of peasant communes under the supervision of land-owning proprietors appointed by his government. These "land captains" ("zemskiye nachalniki") were feared and resented throughout the Empire's peasant communities. These acts weakened the nobility and the peasantry and brought Imperial administration under the Emperor's personal control.

In such policies Alexander III had the encouragement of <a href="Konstantin%20Pobedonostsev">Konstantin Pobedonostsev</a>, who retained control of the Church in Russia through his long tenure as Procurator of the Holy Synod (from 1880 to 1905) and who became tutor to Alexander's son and heir, Nicholas. (Pobedonostsev appears as "Toporov" in Tolstoy's novel "Resurrection".) Other conservative advisors included Count <a href="Dmitry%20Tolstoy">D. A. Tolstoy</a> (minister of education, and later of internal affairs) and <a href="Ivan%20Durnovo">I. N. Durnovo</a> (D. A. Tolstoy's successor in the latter post). <a href="Mikhail%20Katkov">Mikhail Katkov</a> and other journalists supported the emperor in his autocracy.

Encouraged by its successful assassination of Alexander II, the <a href="Narodnaya%20Volya">Narodnaya Volya</a> movement began planning the murder of Alexander III. The <a href="Okhrana">Okhrana</a> uncovered the plot and five of the conspirators, including <a href="Alexander%20Ulyanov">Alexander Ulyanov</a>, the older brother of <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, were captured and hanged on . On the Imperial train <a href="derailment">derailed</a> in an <a href="Borki%20train%20disaster">accident</a> at <a href="Borki%2C%20Kharkiv%20Oblast">Borki</a>. At the moment of the crash, the imperial family was in the dining car. Its roof collapsed, and Alexander supposedly held its remains on his shoulders as the children fled outdoors. The onset of Alexander’s kidney failure was later attributed to the blunt trauma suffered in this incident.

The famine of 1891–1892 and the ensuing cholera epidemic permitted some liberal activity, as the Russian government could not cope with the crisis and had to allow zemstvos to help with relief (among others, <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Tolstoy</a> helped organize soup-kitchens, and <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Chekhov</a> directed anti-cholera precautions in several villages).

In foreign affairs Alexander III was a man of peace, but not at any price, and held that the best means of averting war is to be well-prepared for it. Though he was indignant at the conduct of German chancellor <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a> towards Russia, he avoided an open rupture with <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a>—even reviving the <a href="League%20of%20Three%20Emperors">League of Three Emperors</a> for a period of time—and in 1887, signed the <a href="Reinsurance%20Treaty">Reinsurance Treaty</a> with the Germans. However, in 1890, the expiration of the treaty coincided with the dismissal of Bismarck by the new German emperor, <a href="Kaiser%20Wilhelm%20II">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a> (for whom the Tsar had an immense dislike), and the unwillingness of Wilhelm II's government to renew the treaty. In response Alexander III then began cordial relations with France, eventually entering into an <a href="Franco-Russian%20Alliance">alliance</a> with the French in 1892.

Despite chilly relations with Berlin, the Tsar nevertheless confined himself to keeping a large number of troops near the German frontier. With regard to Bulgaria he exercised similar self-control. The efforts of <a href="Alexander%2C%20Prince%20of%20Bulgaria">Prince Alexander</a> and afterwards of <a href="Stefan%20Stambolov">Stambolov</a> to destroy Russian influence in the principality roused his indignation, but he vetoed all proposals to intervene by force of arms.

In <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>n affairs he followed the traditional policy of gradually extending Russian domination without provoking conflict with the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a> (see <a href="Panjdeh%20Incident">Panjdeh Incident</a>), and he never allowed the bellicose partisans of a forward policy to get out of hand. His reign cannot be regarded as an eventful period of <a href="History%20of%20Russia">Russian history</a>; but under his hard rule the country made considerable progress.

Alexander and his wife regularly spent their summers at <a href="Langinkoski">Langinkoski</a> manor near <a href="Kotka">Kotka</a> on the <a href="Finland">Finnish</a> coast, where their children were immersed in a Scandinavian lifestyle of relative modesty.

Alexander deprecated foreign influence, German influence in particular, thus the adoption of local national principles was off in all spheres of official activity, with a view to realizing his ideal of a Russia homogeneous in language, administration and religion. These ideas conflicted with those of his father, who had German sympathies despite being a patriot; Alexander II often used the German language in his private relations, occasionally ridiculed the <a href="Slavophiles">Slavophiles</a> and based his foreign policy on the Prussian alliance. 

Some differences had first appeared during the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a>, when Alexander II supported the cabinet of <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> while the Tsesarevich made no effort to conceal his sympathies for the French. These sentiments would resurface during 1875-1879, when the <a href="Eastern%20Question">Eastern Question</a> excited Russian society. At first the Tsesarevich was more Slavophile than the government, but his <a href="phlegmatic">phlegmatic</a> nature restrained him from many exaggerations, and any popular illusions he may have imbibed were dispelled by personal observation in <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, where he commanded the left wing of the invading army. Never consulted on political questions, Alexander confined himself to military duties and fulfilled them in a conscientious and unobtrusive manner. After many mistakes and disappointments, the army reached <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and the <a href="Treaty%20of%20San%20Stefano">Treaty of San Stefano</a> was signed, but much that had been obtained by that important document had to be sacrificed at the <a href="Congress%20of%20Berlin">Congress of Berlin</a>.

<a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Bismarck</a> failed to do what was expected of him by the Russian emperor. In return for the Russian support which had enabled him to create the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>, it was thought that he would help Russia to solve the Eastern question in accordance with Russian interests, but to the surprise and indignation of the cabinet of Saint Petersburg he confined himself to acting the part of "honest broker" at the Congress, and shortly afterwards contracted an alliance with <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> for the purpose of counteracting Russian designs in <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>.

The Tsesarevich could refer to these results as confirmation of the views he had expressed during the Franco-Prussian War; he concluded that for Russia, the best thing was to recover as quickly as possible from her temporary exhaustion, and prepare for future contingencies by military and naval reorganization. In accordance with this conviction, he suggested that certain reforms should be introduced.

Following his father's assassination, Alexander III was advised that it would be difficult for him to be kept safe at the Winter Palace. As a result, Alexander relocated his family to the <a href="Gatchina%20Palace">Gatchina Palace</a>, located twenty miles south of St. Petersburg, making it his primary residence. Under heavy guard he would make occasional visits into St. Petersburg, but even then he would stay in the <a href="Anichkov%20Palace">Anichkov Palace</a>, as opposed to the Winter Palace.

In the 1860s Alexander fell madly in love with his mother's lady-in-waiting, Princess Maria Elimovna Meshcherskaya. Dismayed to learn that Prince Wittgenstein had proposed to her in spring 1866, he told his parents that he was prepared to give up his rights of succession in order to marry his beloved "Dusenka". On 19 May 1866, Alexander II informed his son that Russia had come to an agreement with the parents of Princess Dagmar of Denmark, his fourth cousin. Before then, she had been the fiancée of his late elder brother Nicholas. At first Alexander refused to travel to Copenhagen, declaring that he did not love Dagmar and his desire to marry Maria. In response the enraged emperor ordered Alexander to go straight to Denmark and propose to Princess Dagmar. The Tsesarevich then realised that he was not a free man and that duty had to come first and foremost; the only thing left to do was to write in his diary "Farewell, dear Dusenka." Maria was forced to leave Russia, accompanied by her aunt, Princess Chernyshova. Almost a year after her first appearance in Paris, <a href="Pavel%20Pavlovich%20Demidov%2C%202nd%20Prince%20of%20San%20Donato">Pavel Pavlovich Demidov, 2nd Prince di San Donato</a>, fell in love with her and the couple married in 1867. Maria would die giving birth to her son <a href="Elim%20Pavlovich%20Demidov%2C%203rd%20Prince%20of%20San%20Donato">Elim Pavlovich Demidov, 3rd Prince di San Donato</a>. Alexander's reaction to the news of her death and the birth of her child is unknown.

Alexander soon grew fond of Dagmar and had six children by her, five of whom survived into adulthood: <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas</a> (b. 1868), <a href="Grand%20Duke%20George%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">George</a> (b. 1871), <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Xenia%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Xenia</a> (b. 1875), <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Michael%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">Michael</a> (b. 1878) and <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Olga%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Olga</a> (b. 1882). Of his five surviving children, he was closest to his youngest two.

Each summer his parents-in-law, <a href="King%20Christian%20IX%20of%20Denmark">King Christian IX</a> and <a href="Louise%20of%20Hesse-Kassel">Queen Louise</a>, held family reunions at the Danish royal palaces of <a href="Fredensborg%20Palace">Fredensborg</a> and <a href="Bernstorff%20Palace">Bernstorff</a>, bringing Alexander, Maria and their children to Denmark. His sister-in-law, the <a href="Queen%20Alexandra">Princess of Wales</a>, would come from Great Britain with some of her children, and his brother-in-law, <a href="King%20George%20I%20of%20Greece">King George I of Greece</a>, his wife, <a href="Queen%20Olga%20of%20Greece">Queen Olga</a>, who was a first cousin of Alexander and a Romanov Grand Duchess by birth, came with their children from Athens. In contrast to the strict security observed in Russia, Alexander and Maria revelled in the relative freedom that they enjoyed in Denmark, Alexander once commenting to the Prince and Princess of Wales near the end of a visit that he envied them being able to return to a happy home in England, while he was returning to his Russian prison. In Denmark, he was able to enjoy joining his children in muddy ponds looking for tadpoles, sneaking into his father-in-law's orchard to steal apples, and playing pranks, such as turning a water hose on the visiting <a href="Oscar%20II%20of%20Sweden">King Oscar II of Sweden</a>.

As Tsesarevich—and then as Tsar—Alexander had an extremely poor relationship with his brother <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Vladimir%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Vladimir</a>. This tension was reflected in the rivalry between Maria Feodorovna and Vladimir's wife, <a href="Marie%20of%20Mecklenburg-Schwerin%20%28Maria%20Pavlovna%20of%20Russia%29">Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna</a>. Alexander had better relationships with his other brothers: <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Alexei%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">Alexei</a> (whom he made rear admiral and then a grand admiral of the Russian Navy), <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Sergei%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">Sergei</a> (whom he made governor of Moscow) and <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Paul%20Alexandrovich%20of%20Russia">Paul</a>.

Despite the antipathy that Alexander had towards his stepmother, <a href="Catherine%20Dolgorukov">Princess Catherine Dolgorukov</a>, he nevertheless allowed her to remain in the Winter Palace for some time after his father's assassination and to retain various keepsakes of him. These included Alexander II's blood-soaked uniform that he died wearing, and his reading glasses.

In 1894 Alexander III became ill with terminal kidney disease (<a href="nephritis">nephritis</a>). In the fall of that year, Maria Fyodorovna's sister-in-law, Queen Olga of Greece, offered her villa of <a href="Mon%20Repos%2C%20Corfu">Mon Repos</a>, on the island of <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a>, in the hope that it might improve the Tsar's condition. However, by the time that they reached <a href="Crimean%20Peninsula">Crimea</a>, they stayed at the Maly Palace in <a href="Livadia%20Palace">Livadia</a>, as Alexander was too weak to travel any further. Recognizing that the Tsar's days were numbered, various imperial relatives began to descend on Livadia. Even the famed clergyman, <a href="John%20of%20Kronstadt">John of Kronstadt</a>, paid a visit and administered Communion to the Tsar. On 21 October, Alexander received Nicholas's fiancée, Princess Alix, who had come from her native Darmstadt to receive the Tsar's blessing. Despite being exceedingly weak, Alexander insisted on receiving Alix in full dress uniform, an event that left him exhausted. Soon after, his health began to deteriorate more rapidly. He eventually died in the arms of his wife at Maly Palace in Livadia on the afternoon of at the age of forty-nine, and was succeeded by his eldest son Tsesarevich Nicholas, who took the throne as <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II</a>. After leaving Livadia on 6 November and traveling to St. Petersburg by way of Moscow, his remains were interred on 18 November at the <a href="Peter%20and%20Paul%20Fortress">Peter and Paul Fortress</a>.

Alexander III had six children (five of whom survived to adulthood) of his marriage with <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Princess Dagmar of Denmark</a>, also known as Marie Feodorovna.

In 1909 a bronze <a href="equestrian%20statue">equestrian statue</a> of Alexander III sculpted by <a href="Paolo%20Troubetzkoy">Paolo Troubetzkoy</a> was placed in <a href="Znamenskaya%20Square">Znamenskaya Square</a> in front of the <a href="Moskovsky%20Rail%20Terminal%20%28Saint%20Petersburg%29">Moscow Rail Terminal</a> in <a href="St.%20Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a>. Both the horse and rider were sculpted in massive form, leading to the nickname of "hippopotamus". Troubetzkoy envisioned the statue as a <a href="caricature">caricature</a>, jesting that he wished "to portray an animal atop another animal", and it was quite controversial at the time, with many, including the members of the Imperial Family, opposed to the design, but it was approved because of the <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Empress Dowager</a> unexpectedly liking the monument. Following the Revolution of 1917 the statue remained in place as a symbol of tsarist autocracy until 1937 when it was placed in storage. In 1994 it was again put on public display, in front of the <a href="Marble%20Palace">Marble Palace</a>.
Another memorial is located in the city of <a href="Irkutsk">Irkutsk</a> at the <a href="Angara%20River">Angara</a> embankment.

Alexander I of Scotland

Alexander I (<a href="Middle%20Irish%20language">medieval Gaelic</a>: "Alaxandair mac Maíl Coluim"; <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic%20language">modern Gaelic</a>: "Alasdair mac Mhaol Chaluim"; c. 1078 – 23 April 1124), posthumously nicknamed The Fierce, was the <a href="King%20of%20Scotland">King of Scotland</a> from 1107 to his death.

Alexander was the fifth son of <a href="Malcolm%20III%20of%20Scotland">Malcolm III</a> by his wife <a href="Saint%20Margaret%20of%20Scotland">Margaret of Wessex</a>, grandniece of <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>. Alexander was named after <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20II">Pope Alexander II</a>.

He was the younger brother of King <a href="Edgar%20of%20Scotland">Edgar</a>, who was unmarried, and his brother's <a href="heir%20presumptive">heir presumptive</a> by 1104 (and perhaps earlier). In that year he was the senior layman present at the examination of the remains of <a href="Saint%20Cuthbert">Saint Cuthbert</a> at <a href="Durham%2C%20England">Durham</a> prior to their re-interment. He held lands in Scotland north of the <a href="River%20Forth">Forth</a> and in <a href="Lothian">Lothian</a>.

On the death of Edgar in 1107 he succeeded to the Scottish crown; but, in accordance with Edgar's instructions, their brother <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">David</a> was granted an <a href="appanage">appanage</a> in southern Scotland. Edgar's will granted David the lands of the former <a href="kingdom%20of%20Strathclyde">kingdom of Strathclyde</a> or Cumbria, and this was apparently agreed in advance by Edgar, Alexander, David and their brother-in-law <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I of England</a>. In 1113, perhaps at Henry's instigation, and with the support of his <a href="Anglo-Norman">Anglo-Norman</a> allies, David demanded, and received, additional lands in <a href="Lothian">Lothian</a> along the Upper <a href="River%20Tweed">Tweed</a> and <a href="River%20Teviot">Teviot</a>. David did not receive the title of king, but of "prince of the Cumbrians", and his lands remained under Alexander's final authority.

The dispute over Tweeddale and Teviotdale does not appear to have damaged relations between Alexander and David, although it was unpopular in some quarters. A <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic%20language">Gaelic</a> poem laments:It's bad what Malcolm's son has done,<br>dividing us from Alexander;<br>he causes, like each king's son before,<br>the plunder of stable Alba.

The dispute over the eastern marches does not appear to have caused lasting trouble between Alexander and Henry of England. In 1114 he joined Henry on campaign in Wales against <a href="Gruffudd%20ap%20Cynan">Gruffudd ap Cynan</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Gwynedd">Gwynedd</a>. Alexander's marriage with Henry's illegitimate daughter <a href="Sybilla%20of%20Normandy">Sybilla of Normandy</a> may have occurred as early as 1107, or as at late as 1114.

<a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>'s account attacks Sybilla, but the evidence argues that Alexander and Sybilla were a devoted but childless couple and Sybilla was of noteworthy piety. Sybilla died in unrecorded circumstances at "Eilean nam Ban" (<a href="Kenmore%2C%20Perth%20and%20Kinross">Kenmore</a> on <a href="Loch%20Tay">Loch Tay</a>) in July 1122 and was buried at <a href="Dunfermline%20Abbey">Dunfermline Abbey</a>. Alexander did not remarry and <a href="Walter%20Bower">Walter Bower</a> wrote that he planned an <a href="Augustinian">Augustinian</a> <a href="Priory">Priory</a> at the "Eilean nam Ban" dedicated to Sybilla's memory, and he may have taken steps to have her <a href="Veneration">venerated</a>.

Alexander had at least one illegitimate child, <a href="M%C3%A1el%20Coluim%20mac%20Alaxandair">Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair</a>, who was later to be involved in a revolt against <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">David I</a> in the 1130s. He was imprisoned at <a href="Roxburgh">Roxburgh</a> for many years afterwards, perhaps until his death some time after 1157.

Alexander was, like his brothers Edgar and David, a notably pious king. He was responsible for foundations at <a href="Scone%2C%20Perthshire">Scone</a> and <a href="Inchcolm">Inchcolm</a>. His mother's chaplain and <a href="hagiography">hagiographer</a> <a href="Thurgot">Thurgot</a> was named <a href="Bishop%20of%20Saint%20Andrews">Bishop of Saint Andrews</a> (or "Cell Rígmonaid") in 1107, presumably by Alexander's order. The case of Thurgot's would-be successor <a href="Eadmer">Eadmer</a> shows that Alexander's wishes were not always accepted by the religious community, perhaps because Eadmer had the backing of the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="Ralph%20d%27Escures">Ralph d'Escures</a>, rather than <a href="Thurstan">Thurstan</a> of <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">York</a>. Alexander also patronised <a href="Saint%20Andrews">Saint Andrews</a>, granting lands intended for an Augustinian Priory, which may have been the same as that intended to honour his wife.

For all his religiosity, Alexander was not remembered as a man of peace. <a href="John%20of%20Fordun">John of Fordun</a> says of him:
He manifested the terrible aspect of his character in his reprisals in the <a href="Mormaerdom%20of%20Moray">Mormaerdom of Moray</a>. <a href="Andrew%20of%20Wyntoun">Andrew of Wyntoun</a>'s "Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland" says that Alexander was holding court at <a href="Invergowrie">Invergowrie</a> when he was attacked by "men of the Isles". Walter Bower says the attackers were from Moray and Mearns. Alexander pursued them north, to "Stockford" in <a href="Ross">Ross</a> (near <a href="Beauly">Beauly</a>) where he defeated them. This, says Wyntoun, is why he was named the "Fierce". The dating of this is uncertain, as are his enemies' identity. However, in 1116 the <a href="Annals%20of%20Ulster">Annals of Ulster</a> report: "Ladhmann son of Domnall, grandson of the king of Scotland, was killed by the men of Moray." The king referred to is Alexander's father, Malcolm III, and Domnall was Alexander's half brother. The Mormaerdom or Kingdom of Moray was ruled by the family of <a href="Macbeth%20of%20Scotland">Macbeth</a> (Mac Bethad mac Findláich) and <a href="Lulach%20of%20Scotland">Lulach</a> (Lulach mac Gille Coemgáin): not overmighty subjects, but a family who had ruled Alba within little more than a lifetime. Who the Mormaer or King was at this time is not known; it may have been <a href="%C3%93engus%20of%20Moray">Óengus of Moray</a> or his father, whose name is not known. As for the Mearns, the only known <a href="Mormaer%20of%20Mearns">Mormaer of Mearns</a>, <a href="M%C3%A1el%20Petair%20of%20Mearns">Máel Petair</a>, had murdered Alexander's half-brother <a href="Duncan%20II%20of%20Scotland">Duncan II</a> (Donnchad mac Maíl Coluim) in 1094.

Alexander died in April 1124 at his court at Stirling; his brother David, probably the acknowledged heir since the death of Sybilla, succeeded him.

Alexander I has been depicted in a fantasy novel.:

Alexander II of Scotland

Alexander II (<a href="Middle%20Irish">Mediaeval Gaelic</a>: '; <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Modern Gaelic</a>: '; 24 August 11986 July 1249) was <a href="King%20of%20Scots">King of Scots</a> from
1214 until his death in 1249.

He was born at <a href="Haddington%2C%20East%20Lothian">Haddington, East Lothian</a>, the only son of the Scottish king <a href="William%20the%20Lion">William the Lion</a> and <a href="Ermengarde%20of%20Beaumont">Ermengarde of Beaumont</a>. He spent time in England (<a href="John%20of%20England">John of England</a> knighted him at <a href="Clerkenwell%20Priory">Clerkenwell Priory</a> in 1213) before succeeding to the kingdom on the death of his father on 4 December 1214, being crowned at <a href="Scone%2C%20Perth%20and%20Kinross">Scone</a> on 6 December the same year.

In 1215, the year after his accession, the clans <a href="Meic%20Uilleim">Meic Uilleim</a> and <a href="MacHeths">MacHeths</a>, inveterate enemies of the Scottish crown, broke into revolt; but loyalist forces speedily quelled the insurrection. In the same year Alexander joined the English barons in their struggle against <a href="John%20of%20England">John of England</a>, and led an army into the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Kingdom of England</a> in support of their cause. This action led to the sacking of <a href="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick-upon-Tweed</a> as John's forces ravaged the north.

The Scottish forces reached the south coast of England at the port of <a href="Dover">Dover</a> where in September 1216, Alexander paid homage to the pretender <a href="Louis%20VIII%20of%20France">Prince Louis of France</a> for his lands in England, chosen by the barons to replace King John. But <a href="John%20of%20England">John</a> having died, the Pope and the English aristocracy changed their allegiance to his nine-year-old son, <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry</a>, forcing the French and the Scots armies to return home.

Peace between Henry III, Louis of France, and Alexander followed on 12 September 1217 with the treaty of Kingston. Diplomacy further strengthened the reconciliation by the marriage of Alexander to Henry's sister <a href="Joan%20of%20England%2C%20Queen%20consort%20of%20Scotland">Joan of England</a> on 18 June or 25 June 1221.

The next year marked the subjection of the hitherto semi-independent district of <a href="Argyll">Argyll</a> (much smaller than the modern area by that name, it only comprised <a href="Craignish">Craignish</a>, <a href="Ardscotnish">Ardscotnish</a>, <a href="River%20Add">Glassary</a>, <a href="River%20Aray">Glenary</a>, and <a href="Cowal">Cowal</a>; <a href="Lorne%2C%20Scotland">Lorn</a> was a separate province, while <a href="Kintyre">Kintyre</a> and <a href="Knapdale">Knapdale</a> were part of <a href="Scandinavian%20Scotland%23">Suðreyar</a>). Royal forces crushed a revolt in <a href="Galloway">Galloway</a> in 1235 without difficulty; nor did an invasion attempted soon afterwards by its exiled leaders meet with success. Soon afterwards a claim for homage from Henry of England drew forth from Alexander a counter-claim to the northern English counties. The two kingdoms, however, settled this dispute by a compromise in 1237. This was the <a href="Treaty%20of%20York">Treaty of York</a> which defined the boundary between the two kingdoms as running between the Solway Firth (in the west) and the mouth of the River Tweed (in the east).

Joan died in March 1238 in Essex. Alexander married his second wife, <a href="Marie%20de%20Coucy">Marie de Coucy</a>, the following year on 15 May 1239. Together they had one son, the future <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Scotland">Alexander III</a>, born in 1241.

A threat of invasion by Henry in 1243 for a time interrupted the friendly relations between the two countries; but the prompt action of Alexander in anticipating his attack, and the disinclination of the English barons for war, compelled him to <a href="Treaty%20of%20Newcastle%20%281244%29">make peace</a> next year at <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a>. Alexander now turned his attention to securing the <a href="Western%20Isles">Western Isles</a>, which were still part of the Norwegian domain of <a href="Scandinavian%20Scotland%23Geography">Suðreyjar</a>. He repeatedly attempted negotiations and purchase, but without success.

The English chronicler <a href="Matthew%20Paris">Matthew Paris</a> in his <a href="Chronica%20Majora">Chronica Majora</a> described Alexander as red-haired:

"[King John] taunted King Alexander, and because he was red-headed, sent word to him,<br> 
saying, 'so shall we hunt the red fox-cub from his lairs."

Alexander attempted to persuade <a href="Ewen%20MacDougall">Ewen</a>, the son of Duncan, Lord of <a href="Argyll">Argyll</a>, to sever his allegiance to <a href="Haakon%20IV%20of%20Norway">Haakon IV of Norway</a>. When Ewen rejected these attempts, Alexander sailed forth to compel him, but on the way he suffered a fever at the Isle of <a href="Kerrera">Kerrera</a> in the <a href="Inner%20Hebrides">Inner Hebrides</a>. He died there in 1249 and was buried at <a href="Melrose%20Abbey">Melrose Abbey</a>

1. <a href="Joan%20of%20England%2C%20Queen%20Consort%20of%20Scotland">Joan of England</a>, (22 July 12104 March 1238), was the eldest legitimate daughter and third child of <a href="John%20of%20England">John of England</a> and <a href="Isabella%20of%20Angoul%C3%AAme">Isabella of Angoulême</a>. She and Alexander II married on 21 June 1221, at <a href="York%20Minster">York Minster</a>. Alexander was 23. Joan was 11. They had no children. Joan was Alexander's 3rd cousin, their closest common ancestor being <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I of England</a>. Joan died in <a href="Essex">Essex</a> in 1238, and was buried at <a href="Tarrant%20Crawford">Tarant Crawford Abbey</a> in <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>.

2. <a href="Marie%20de%20Coucy">Marie de Coucy</a>, who became mother of <a href="Alexander%20III%20of%20Scotland">Alexander III of Scotland</a>. She was Alexander's 3rd cousin once removed by their common ancestor <a href="Hugh%2C%20Count%20of%20Vermandois">Hugh I, Count of Vermandois</a>.

Alexander I of Serbia

Alexander I or Aleksandar Obrenović (<a href="Serbian%20Cyrillic%20alphabet">Cyrillic</a>: Александар Обреновић; 14 August 187611 June 1903) was king of <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> from 1889 to 1903 when he and his wife, Queen <a href="Draga%20Ma%C5%A1in">Draga</a>, were <a href="May%20Coup%20%28Serbia%29">assassinated</a> by a group of Army officers, led by Captain <a href="Dragutin%20Dimitrijevi%C4%87">Dragutin Dimitrijević</a>.

Alexander was born on 14 August 1876 to King <a href="Milan%20I%20of%20Serbia">Milan</a> and Queen <a href="Natalie%20of%20Serbia">Natalie of Serbia</a>. He belonged to the Obrenović dynasty.

In 1889, King Milan unexpectedly abdicated and withdrew to private life, proclaiming Alexander king of Serbia under a regency until he should attain his majority at eighteen years of age. His mother became his regent. His parents were second cousins. In 1893, King Alexander, aged sixteen, arbitrarily proclaimed himself of full age, dismissed the <a href="regent">regent</a>s and their government, and took the royal authority into his own hands. His action won popular support, as did his appointment of a radical ministry. In May 1894 King Alexander arbitrarily abolished King Milan's liberal constitution of 1888 and restored the conservative one of 1869. His attitude during the <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281897%29">Greco-Turkish War (1897)</a> was one of strict <a href="Neutrality%20%28international%20relations%29">neutrality</a>.

In 1894 the young King brought his father, Milan, back to Serbia and, in 1898, appointed him commander-in-chief of the Serbian army. During that time, Milan was regarded as the "de facto" ruler of the country.

In the summer of 1900, King Alexander suddenly announced his engagement to the widowed Madame <a href="Draga%20Ma%C5%A1in">Draga Mašin</a>, formerly a lady-in-waiting to his mother and 12 years older than him. The proposed union aroused great opposition: not only was Draga of unequal birth and obscure family, but at 36 years of age, the chances of her bearing an heir were slim. Alexander was an only child, and it was imperative to secure the succession.

Before making the announcement, Alexander did not consult with his father, who had been on vacation in <a href="Karlovy%20Vary">Karlovy Vary</a> and making arrangements to secure the hand of <a href="Germany">German</a> princess <a href="Prince%20William%20of%20Schaumburg-Lippe%23Marriage">Alexandra zu Schaumburg-Lippe</a> for his son, or his <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Serbia">Prime Minister</a> Dr. Vladan Đorđević, who was visiting the <a href="Paris">Paris</a> <a href="World%20Exhibition">Universal Exhibition</a> at the time of the announcement. Both immediately resigned from their respective offices and Alexander had difficulty in forming a new cabinet. Alexander's mother also opposed the marriage and was subsequently banished from the kingdom. She was known to have been seen in the nearby countries, such as Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria.

Opposition to the union seemed to subside somewhat for a time upon the publication of <a href="Tsar%20Nicholas%20II">Tsar Nicholas II</a>'s congratulations to the king on his engagement and of his acceptance to act as the principal witness at the wedding. The marriage duly took place in August 1900. Even so, the unpopularity of the union weakened the King's position in the eyes of the army and of the country at large.

King Alexander tried to reconcile political parties by unveiling a <a href="classical%20liberalism">liberal</a> <a href="constitution">constitution</a> of his own initiative, introducing for the first time in the constitutional history of Serbia the system of two chambers ("<a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Serbia">skupština</a>" and "<a href="senate">senate</a>"). This reconciled the political parties but did not reconcile the army which, already dissatisfied with the king's marriage, became still more so at the rumors that one of the two unpopular brothers of <a href="Draga%20Ma%C5%A1in">Queen Draga</a>, Lieutenant Nikodije, was to be proclaimed heir-presumptive to the throne.

Meanwhile, the independence of the <a href="senate">senate</a> and of the council of state caused increasing irritation to King Alexander. In March 1903 the King suspended the <a href="constitution">constitution</a> for half an hour, time enough to publish the decrees dismissing and replacing the old senators and councillors of state. This arbitrary act increased dissatisfaction in the country.

The general impression was that, as much as the <a href="senate">senate</a> was packed with men devoted to the royal couple and the government obtained a large majority at the general elections, King Alexander would not hesitate any longer to proclaim Queen Draga's brother as the <a href="heir%20presumptive">heir presumptive</a> to the throne. In spite of this, it had been agreed with the Serbian Government that <a href="Prince%20Mirko%20of%20Montenegro">Prince Mirko of Montenegro</a>, who was married to <a href="Natalija%20Konstantinovic">Natalija Konstantinovic</a>, the granddaughter of <a href="Princess%20Anka%20Obrenovi%C4%87">Princess Anka Obrenović</a>, an aunt of King Milan, would be proclaimed heir-presumptive in the event that the marriage of King Alexander and Queen Draga was childless.

Apparently to prevent Queen Draga's brother being named heir-presumptive, but in reality to replace Alexander Obrenović with <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Serbia">Peter Karađorđević</a>, a conspiracy was organized by a group of Army officers headed by Captain <a href="Dragutin%20Dimitrijevi%C4%87">Dragutin Dimitrijević</a> also known as "Apis", and Norman Perović, a young Greek Orthodox militant who was in the pay of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russians</a>, as well as the leader of the <a href="Black%20Hand%20%28Serbia%29">Black Hand</a> <a href="secret%20society">secret society</a> which would assassinate <a href="Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand%20of%20Austria">Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a> in 1914. Several politicians were also part of the conspiracy, and allegedly included former Prime Minister, <a href="Nikola%20Pa%C5%A1i%C4%87">Nikola Pašić</a>. The royal couple's <a href="The%20Old%20Palace">palace</a> was invaded and they hid in a cupboard in the Queen's bedroom. (There is another possibility, used in a Serbian TV history series "The End of the Obrenović Dynasty" in which the royal couple was hidden in a secret <a href="panic%20room">panic room</a> hidden behind the mirror in a common bedroom. The room contained an entrance to a secret passage leading out of the palace, but the entrance was inaccessible due to the placement of the queen's wardrobe over it after the wedding.)

The conspirators searched the palace and eventually discovered the royal couple and murdered them in the early morning of June 11, 1903. King Alexander and Queen Draga were shot and their bodies mutilated and disemboweled and, according to eyewitness accounts, thrown from a second floor window of the palace onto piles of garden manure. The King was only 26 years old at the time of his death. King Alexander and Queen Draga were buried in the crypt of <a href="St.%20Mark%27s%20Church%2C%20Belgrade">St. Mark's Church, Belgrade</a>.

Alexander III of Scotland

Alexander III married at the age of 9 "Alaxandair mac Alaxandair"; Modern Gaelic: "Alasdair mac Alasdair") (4 September 1241 – 19 March 1286) was <a href="King%20of%20Scots">King of Scots</a> from 1249 to his death.

Alexander was born at <a href="Roxburgh">Roxburgh</a>, the only son of <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Scotland">Alexander II</a> by his second wife <a href="Marie%20de%20Coucy">Marie de Coucy</a>. Alexander III was also the grandson of <a href="William%20the%20Lion">William the Lion</a>. Alexander's father died on 8 July 1249 and he became king at the age of seven, inaugurated at <a href="Scone%2C%20Perth%20and%20Kinross">Scone</a> on 13 July 1249.

The years of his minority featured an embittered struggle for the control of affairs between two rival parties, the one led by <a href="Walter%20Comyn">Walter Comyn</a>, <a href="Earl%20of%20Menteith">Earl of Menteith</a>, the other by <a href="Alan%20Durward">Alan Durward</a>, <a href="Justiciar%20of%20Scotia">Justiciar of Scotia</a>. The former dominated the early years of Alexander's reign. At the marriage of Alexander to <a href="Margaret%20of%20England">Margaret of England</a> in 1251, <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III of England</a> seized the opportunity to demand from his son-in-law homage for the Scottish kingdom, but Alexander did not comply. In 1255 an interview between the English and Scottish kings at <a href="Kelso%2C%20Scottish%20Borders">Kelso</a> led to Menteith and his party losing to Durward's party. But though disgraced, they still retained great influence, and two years later, seizing the person of the king, they compelled their rivals to consent to the erection of a regency representative of both parties.

On attaining his majority at the age of 21 in 1262, Alexander declared his intention of resuming the projects on the <a href="Western%20Isles">Western Isles</a> which the death of his father thirteen years before had cut short. He laid a formal claim before the <a href="Norway">Norwegian</a> king <a href="Haakon%20IV%20of%20Norway">Haakon</a>. Haakon rejected the claim, and in the following year responded with a formidable invasion. Sailing around the west coast of Scotland he halted off the <a href="Isle%20of%20Arran">Isle of Arran</a>, and negotiations commenced. Alexander artfully prolonged the talks until the autumn storms should begin. At length Haakon, weary of delay, attacked, only to encounter a terrific <a href="extreme%20weather">storm</a> which greatly damaged his ships. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Largs">Battle of Largs</a> (October 1263) proved indecisive, but even so, Haakon's position was hopeless. Baffled, he turned homewards, but died in Orkney on 15 December 1263. The Isles now lay at Alexander's feet, and in 1266 Haakon's successor concluded the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Perth">Treaty of Perth</a> by which he ceded the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> and the <a href="Western%20Isles">Western Isles</a> to Scotland in return for a monetary payment. Norway retained only <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a> in the area.

Alexander had married <a href="Margaret%20of%20England">Margaret</a> (his 4th cousin by <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I of England</a>), daughter of King <a href="Henry%20III%20of%20England">Henry III of England</a> and <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Provence">Eleanor of Provence</a>, on 26 December 1251. She died in 1275, after they had three children.

According to the <a href="Lanercost%20Chronicle">Lanercost Chronicle</a>, Alexander did not spend his decade as a widower alone: "he used never to forbear on account of season nor storm, nor for perils of flood or rocky cliffs, but would visit none too creditably nuns or matrons, virgins or widows as the fancy seized him, sometimes in disguise."

Towards the end of Alexander's reign, the death of all three of his children within a few years made the question of the succession one of pressing importance. In 1284 he induced the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Estates</a> to recognize as his heir-presumptive his granddaughter <a href="Margaret%20of%20Scotland%20%28Maid%20of%20Norway%29">Margaret, the "Maid of Norway"</a>. The need for a male heir led him to contract a second marriage to <a href="Yolande%20de%20Dreux%20%28Scotland%29">Yolande de Dreux</a> on 1 November 1285.

Alexander died in a fall from his horse while riding in the dark to visit the queen at <a href="Kinghorn">Kinghorn</a> in <a href="Fife">Fife</a> on 18 March 1286 because it was her birthday the next day. He had spent the evening at Edinburgh Castle celebrating his second marriage and overseeing a meeting with royal advisors. He was advised by them not to make the journey to Fife because of weather conditions, but he travelled anyway. Alexander became separated from his guides and it is assumed that in the dark his horse lost its footing. The 44-year-old king was found dead on the shore the following morning with a broken neck. Some texts have said that he fell off a cliff. Although there is no cliff at the site where his body was found, there is a very steep rocky embankment, which "would have been fatal in the dark." After Alexander's death, his strong realm was plunged into a period of darkness that would eventually lead to war with England. He was buried in <a href="Dunfermline%20Abbey">Dunfermline Abbey</a>.

As Alexander left no surviving children, the heir to the throne was his unborn child by Queen Yolande. When Yolande's pregnancy ended, probably with a miscarriage, Alexander's seven-year-old granddaughter <a href="Margaret%2C%20Maid%20of%20Norway">Margaret, Maid of Norway</a>, became the heir. Margaret died, still uncrowned, on her way to Scotland in 1290. The inauguration of <a href="John%20Balliol">John Balliol</a> as king on 30 November 1292 ended the six years of the <a href="Guardians%20of%20Scotland">Guardians of Scotland</a> governing the land.

The death of Alexander and the subsequent period of instability in Scotland was lamented in an early <a href="Scots%20language">Scots</a> poem recorded by <a href="Andrew%20of%20Wyntoun">Andrew of Wyntoun</a> in his <a href="Orygynale%20Cronykil%20of%20Scotland">Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland</a>.

In 1886, a monument to Alexander III was erected at the approximate location of his death in <a href="Kinghorn">Kinghorn</a>.

Alexander III has been depicted in historical novels. They include:

Alexander of Aphrodisias

Alexander of Aphrodisias (; fl. 200 AD) was a <a href="Peripatetic%20school">Peripatetic</a> philosopher and the most celebrated of the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> <a href="Commentaries%20on%20Aristotle">commentators</a> on the writings of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>. He was a native of <a href="Aphrodisias">Aphrodisias</a> in <a href="Caria">Caria</a>, and lived and taught in <a href="Athens">Athens</a> at the beginning of the 3rd century, where he held a position as head of the <a href="Peripatetic%20school">Peripatetic school</a>. He wrote many commentaries on the works of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, extant are those on the "<a href="Prior%20Analytics">Prior Analytics</a>", "<a href="Topics%20%28Aristotle%29">Topics</a>", "<a href="Meteorology%20%28Aristotle%29">Meteorology</a>", "<a href="Sense%20and%20Sensibilia%20%28Aristotle%29">Sense and Sensibilia</a>", and "<a href="Metaphysics%20%28Aristotle%29">Metaphysics</a>". Several original treatises also survive, and include a work "On Fate", in which he argues against the <a href="Stoicism">Stoic</a> doctrine of necessity; and one "On the Soul". His commentaries on Aristotle were considered so useful that he was styled, by way of pre-eminence, "the commentator" ().

Alexander was a native of <a href="Aphrodisias">Aphrodisias</a> in <a href="Caria">Caria</a> and came to <a href="Athens">Athens</a> towards the end of the 2nd century. He was a student of the two <a href="Stoicism">Stoic</a>, or possibly <a href="Peripatetic%20school">Peripatetic</a>, philosophers <a href="Sosigenes%20the%20Peripatetic">Sosigenes</a> and <a href="Herminus">Herminus</a>, and perhaps of <a href="Aristotle%20of%20Mytilene">Aristotle of Mytilene</a>. At Athens he became head of the <a href="Peripatetic%20school">Peripatetic school</a> and lectured on Peripatetic philosophy. Alexander's dedication of "On Fate" to <a href="Septimius%20Severus">Septimius Severus</a> and <a href="Caracalla">Caracalla</a>, in gratitude for his position at Athens, indicates a date between 198 and 209. A recently published inscription from Aphrodisias confirms that he was head of one of the Schools at Athens and gives his full name as Titus Aurelius Alexander. His full nomenclature shows that his grandfather or other ancestor was probably given Roman citizenship by the emperor <a href="Antoninus%20Pius">Antoninus Pius</a>, while proconsul of Asia. The inscription honours his father, also called Alexander and also a philosopher. This fact makes it plausible that some of the suspect works that form part of Alexander's corpus should be ascribed to his father.

Alexander composed several <a href="Commentaries%20on%20Aristotle">commentaries on the works of Aristotle</a>, in which he sought to escape a <a href="Syncretism">syncretistic</a> tendency and to recover the pure doctrines of Aristotle. His extant commentaries are on "<a href="Prior%20Analytics">Prior Analytics</a>" (Book 1), "<a href="Topics%20%28Aristotle%29">Topics</a>", "<a href="Meteorology%20%28Aristotle%29">Meteorology</a>", "<a href="Sense%20and%20Sensibilia%20%28Aristotle%29">Sense and Sensibilia</a>", and "<a href="Metaphysics%20%28Aristotle%29">Metaphysics</a>" (Books 1-5). The commentary on the "<a href="Sophistical%20Refutations">Sophistical Refutations</a>" is deemed spurious, as is the commentary on the final nine books of the "Metaphysics". The lost commentaries include works on the "<a href="De%20Interpretatione">De Interpretatione</a>", "<a href="Posterior%20Analytics">Posterior Analytics</a>", "<a href="Physics%20%28Aristotle%29">Physics</a>", "<a href="On%20the%20Heavens">On the Heavens</a>", "<a href="On%20Generation%20and%20Corruption">On Generation and Corruption</a>", "<a href="On%20the%20Soul">On the Soul</a>", and "<a href="On%20Memory">On Memory</a>". <a href="Simplicius%20of%20Cilicia">Simplicius of Cilicia</a> mentions that Alexander provided commentary on the <a href="quadrature%20of%20the%20lune">quadrature of the lune</a>s, and the corresponding problem of <a href="squaring%20the%20circle">squaring the circle</a>. In April 2007, it was reported that imaging analysis had discovered an early commentary on Aristotle's "<a href="Categories%20%28Aristotle%29">Categories</a>" in the <a href="Archimedes%20Palimpsest">Archimedes Palimpsest</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Sharples%20%28classicist%29">Robert Sharples</a> suggested Alexander as the most likely author.

There are also several extant original writings by Alexander. These include: "On the Soul", "Problems and Solutions", "Ethical Problems", "On Fate", and "On Mixture and Growth". Three works attributed to him are considered spurious: "Medical Questions", "Physical Problems", and "On Fevers". Additional works by Alexander are preserved in <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> translation, these include: "On the Principles of the Universe", "On Providence", and "Against <a href="Galen">Galen</a> on Motion".

"On the Soul" ("De anima") is a treatise on the <a href="Soul%20%28spirit%29">soul</a> written along the lines suggested by Aristotle in his own "<a href="On%20the%20Soul">De anima</a>". Alexander contends that the undeveloped reason in man is material ("nous hylikos") and inseparable from the body. He argued strongly against the doctrine of the soul's immortality. He identified the active intellect ("nous poietikos"), through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual, with <a href="God">God</a>. A second book is known as the "Supplement to On the Soul" ("Mantissa"). The "Mantissa" is a series of twenty-five separate pieces of which the opening five deal directly with <a href="psychology">psychology</a>. The remaining twenty pieces cover problems in <a href="physics">physics</a> and <a href="ethics">ethics</a>, of which the largest group deals with questions of <a href="visual%20perception">vision</a> and <a href="light">light</a>, and the final four with <a href="destiny">fate</a> and <a href="Divine%20Providence">providence</a>. The "Mantissa" was probably not written by Alexander in its current form, but much of the actual material may be his.

"Problems and Solutions" ("Quaestiones") consists of three books which, although termed "problems and solutions of physical questions," treat of subjects which are not all physical, and are not all problems. Among the sixty-nine items in these three books, twenty-four deal with physics, seventeen with psychology, eleven with <a href="logic">logic</a> and <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>, and six with questions of fate and providence. It is unlikely that Alexander wrote all of the "Quaestiones", some may be Alexander's own explanations, while others may be exercises by his students.

"Ethical Problems" was traditionally counted as the fourth book of the "Quaestiones". The work is a discussion of ethical issues based on Aristotle, and contains responses to questions and problems deriving from Alexander's school. It is likely that the work was not written by Alexander himself, but rather by his pupils on the basis of debates involving Alexander.

"On Fate" is a treatise in which Alexander argues against the <a href="Stoicism">Stoic</a> doctrine of necessity. In "On Fate" Alexander denied three things - necessity (), the foreknowledge of fated events that was part of the Stoic identification of God and Nature, and <a href="determinism">determinism</a> in the sense of a sequence of causes that was laid down beforehand () or predetermined by antecedents (). He defended a view of moral responsibility we would call <a href="Libertarianism%20%28metaphysics%29">libertarianism</a> today.

"On Mixture and Growth" discusses the topic of <a href="mixture">mixture</a> of physical bodies. It is both an extended discussion (and polemic) on <a href="Stoic%20physics">Stoic physics</a>, and an exposition of Aristotelian thought on this theme.

"On the Principles of the Universe" is preserved in Arabic translation. This treatise is not mentioned in surviving Greek sources, but it enjoyed great popularity in the Muslim world, and a large number of copies have survived. The main purpose of this work is to give a general account of Aristotelian cosmology and metaphysics, but it also has a polemical tone, and it may be directed at rival views within the Peripatetic school. Alexander was concerned with filling the gaps of the Aristotelian system and smoothing out its inconsistencies, while also presenting a unified picture of the world, both physical and ethical. The topics dealt with are the nature of the heavenly motions and the relationship between the unchangeable celestial realm and the <a href="Sublunary%20sphere">sublunar world</a> of generation and decay. His principal sources are the "<a href="Physics%20%28Aristotle%29">Physics</a>" (book 7), "<a href="Metaphysics%20%28Aristotle%29">Metaphysics</a>" (book 12), and the <a href="Pseudo-Aristotle">Pseudo-Aristotelian</a> "<a href="On%20the%20Universe">On the Universe</a>".

"On Providence" survives in two Arabic versions. In this treatise, Alexander opposes the Stoic view that <a href="divine%20Providence">divine Providence</a> extends to all aspects of the world; he regards this idea as unworthy of the gods. Instead, providence is a power that emanates from the heavens to the sublunar region, and is responsible for the generation and destruction of earthly things, without any direct involvement in the lives of individuals.

By the 6th century Alexander's commentaries on Aristotle were considered so useful that he was referred to as "the commentator" (). His commentaries were greatly esteemed among the <a href="Arab">Arab</a>s, who translated many of them, and he is heavily quoted by <a href="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>.

In 1210, the Church Council of Paris issued <a href="Condemnations%20%28University%20of%20Paris%29%23Condemnation%20of%201210">a condemnation</a>, which probably targeted the writings of Alexander among others.

In the early <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> his doctrine of the soul's mortality was adopted by <a href="Pietro%20Pomponazzi">Pietro Pomponazzi</a> (against the <a href="Thomists">Thomists</a> and the <a href="Averroists">Averroists</a>), and by his successor <a href="Cesare%20Cremonini%20%28philosopher%29">Cesare Cremonini</a>. This school is known as <a href="Alexandrists">Alexandrists</a>.

<a href="Alexander%27s%20band">Alexander's band</a>, an <a href="optical%20phenomenon">optical phenomenon</a>, is named after him.

Several of Alexander's works were published in the <a href="Aldine%20Press">Aldine</a> edition of Aristotle, Venice, 1495–1498; his "De Fato" and "De Anima" were printed along with the works of <a href="Themistius">Themistius</a> at Venice (1534); the former work, which has been translated into <a href="Latin">Latin</a> by <a href="Grotius">Grotius</a> and also by <a href="Schulthess">Schulthess</a>, was edited by <a href="Johann%20Caspar%20von%20Orelli">J. C. Orelli</a>, <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, 1824; and his commentaries on the Metaphysica by <a href="H.%20Bonitz">H. Bonitz</a>, <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, 1847. In 1989 the first part of his "On Aristotle Metaphysics" was published as part of the <a href="Ancient%20commentators%20project">Ancient commentators project</a>. Since then, other works of his have been translated into English.

Severus Alexander

Severus Alexander (; 1 October 20819 March 235) was <a href="Roman%20Emperor">Roman Emperor</a> from 222 to 235 and the last emperor of the <a href="Severan%20dynasty">Severan dynasty</a>. He succeeded his cousin <a href="Elagabalus">Elagabalus</a>, upon the latter's <a href="assassination">assassination</a> in 222, and was ultimately assassinated himself, marking the <a href="epoch%20event">epoch event</a> for the <a href="Crisis%20of%20the%20Third%20Century">Crisis of the Third Century</a> — nearly 50 years of civil wars, foreign invasion, and collapse of the monetary economy, though this last part is now disputed.

Alexander was the heir to his cousin, the 18-year-old Emperor who had been murdered along with his mother <a href="Julia%20Soaemias">Julia Soaemias</a>, by his own guards, who, as a mark of contempt, had their remains cast into the <a href="Tiber%20river">river Tiber</a>. He and his cousin were both grandsons of the influential and powerful <a href="Julia%20Maesa">Julia Maesa</a>, who had arranged for Elagabalus' acclamation as emperor by the famous <a href="Legio%20III%20Gallica">Third Gallic Legion</a>. It was the rumor of Alexander's death that triggered the assassination of Elagabalus and his mother. His 13-year reign was the longest reign of a "sole" emperor since <a href="Antoninus%20Pius">Antoninus Pius</a>.

As emperor, Alexander's peace time reign was prosperous. However, Rome was militarily confronted with the rising <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanid Empire</a> and growing incursions from the tribes of <a href="Germania">Germania</a>. He managed to check the threat of the Sassanids. But when campaigning against <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic tribes</a>, Alexander attempted to bring peace by engaging in diplomacy and bribery. This alienated many in the <a href="Roman%20Army">Roman Army</a> and led to a conspiracy to assassinate and replace him.

Under the influence of his mother, Alexander did much to improve the morals and condition of the people, and to enhance the dignity of the state. He employed noted <a href="jurist">jurist</a>s to oversee the administration of justice, such as the famous jurist <a href="Ulpian">Ulpian</a>. His advisers were men like the <a href="Roman%20Senate">senator</a> and historian <a href="Cassius%20Dio">Cassius Dio</a>, and it is claimed that he created a select board of 16 senators, although this claim is disputed. He also created a municipal council of 14 who assisted the <a href="urban%20prefect">urban prefect</a> in administering the affairs of the 14 districts of Rome. Excessive luxury and extravagance at the imperial court were diminished, and he restored the <a href="Baths%20of%20Nero">Baths of Nero</a> in 227 or 229; consequently, they are sometimes also known as the Baths of Alexander after him.

Upon his accession he reduced the silver purity of the <a href="denarius">denarius</a> from 46.5% to 43% — the actual silver weight dropped from 1.41 grams to 1.30 grams; however, in 229 he revalued the denarius, increasing the silver purity and weight to 45% and 1.46 grams, respectively. The following year he decreased the amount of base metal in the denarius while adding more silver, raising the silver purity and weight again to 50.5% and 1.50 grams. Also during his reign taxes were lightened; literature, art and science were encouraged; and, for the convenience of the people, loan offices were instituted for lending money at a moderate rate of interest.

In religious matters, Alexander preserved an open mind. It is said that he was desirous of erecting a temple to <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> but was dissuaded by the <a href="Paganism">pagan</a> priests. He allowed a <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a> to be built in Rome, and he gave as a gift to this synagogue a scroll of the <a href="Torah">Torah</a> known as the <a href="Severus%20Scroll">Severus Scroll</a>.

In legal matters, Alexander did much to aid <a href="Military%20justice">the rights of his soldiers</a>. He confirmed that soldiers could name anyone as heirs in their <a href="Will%20and%20testament">will</a>, whereas civilians had strict restrictions over who could become heirs or receive a legacy. Alexander also confirmed that soldiers could free their slaves in their wills. Additionally, he protected the rights of soldiers to their property when they were off on campaign and reasserted that a soldier's property acquired in or because of military service (his "castrense peculium") could be claimed by no one else, not even the soldier's father.

On the whole, Alexander's reign was prosperous until the rise, in the east, of the <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanids</a> under <a href="Ardashir%20I">Ardashir I</a>. Of the war that followed there are various accounts. According to <a href="Herodian">Herodian</a>, the Roman armies suffered a number of humiliating setbacks and defeats, while according to the <a href="Historia%20Augusta">Historia Augusta</a> as well as Alexander's own dispatch to the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a>, he gained great victories. Making <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> his base, he marched at the head of his troops towards <a href="Ctesiphon">Ctesiphon</a>, but a second army was destroyed by the Persians, and further losses were incurred by the retreating Romans in <a href="Roman%20Armenia">Armenia</a>.

Nevertheless, although the Sassanids were checked for the time, the conduct of the <a href="Imperial%20Roman%20army">Roman army</a> showed an extraordinary lack of discipline. In 232 there was a mutiny in the Syrian legion, who proclaimed <a href="Taurinus">Taurinus</a> emperor. Alexander managed to suppress the uprising, and Taurinus drowned while attempting to flee across the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>. The emperor returned to <a href="Rome">Rome</a> and celebrated a triumph in 233.

After the Persian war, Alexander returned to Antioch with the famous <a href="Origen">Origen</a>, one of the greatest Fathers of the Christian Church. Alexander's mother, Julia Mammaea, asked for Origen to tutor Alexander in <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>.

While Alexander was being educated in the Christian doctrines, the northern portion of his empire was being invaded by Germanic and Sarmatian tribes. A new and menacing enemy started to emerge directly after Alexander's success in the Persian war. In A.D 234, the barbarians crossed the Rhine and Danube in hordes that even caused panic at the gates of Rome. The soldiers serving under Alexander, who were already demoralized after their costly war against the Persians, were further discontented with their emperor when their homes were destroyed by the barbarian invaders.

As word of the invasion spread, the Emperor took the front line and went to battle against the Germanic invaders. The Romans prepared heavily for the war, building a brigade of ships to carry the entire battalion across. However, at this point in Alexander's career, he still knew little about being a general. Because of this, he hoped the sole threat of his armies might be enough to persuade the Germanics to surrender. Severus enforced a strict military discipline in his men that sparked a rebellion among the Germanic legions. Due to incurring heavy losses against the Persians, and on the advice of his mother, Alexander attempted to buy the Germanic tribes off, so as to gain time.

It was this decision that resulted in the <a href="Legionary">legionaries</a>' looking down upon Alexander. They considered him dishonorable and feared he was unfit to be Emperor. Under these circumstances the army swiftly looked to replace Alexander.

<a href="Maximinus%20Thrax">Gaius Iulius Verus Maximinus</a> was the next best option. He was a soldier from Thrace who had a golden reputation and was working hard to increase his military status. He was also a man with superior personal strength, who rose from peasantry to ultimately being the one chosen for the throne. With the Thracian's hailing came the end of the Severan Dynasty. With Severus' own army growing with animosity and turning against him, the path for his assassination was paved.

Alexander was forced to face his German enemies in the early months of 235. By the time he and his mother arrived, the situation had settled, and so his mother convinced him that to avoid violence, trying to bribe the German army to surrender was the more sensible course of action. According to historians, it was this tactic combined with insubordination from his own men that destroyed his reputation and popularity. Pusillanimity was responsible for the revolt of Alexander’s army, resulting in Severus' falling victim to the swords of his own men, following the nomination of Maximinus as emperor.

Alexander was assassinated on March 19, 235 together with his mother, in a mutiny of the <a href="Legio%20XXII%20Primigenia">Legio XXII "Primigenia"</a> at <a href="Mainz">Moguntiacum (Mainz)</a> while at a meeting with his generals. These assassinations secured the throne for Maximinus.
<a href="Aelius%20Lampridius">Lampridius</a> documents two theories that elaborate on Severus's assassination. The first claims that the disaffection of Mammaea was the main motive behind the homicide. However, Lampridius makes it clear that he is more supportive of an alternative theory, that Alexander was murdered in Sicilia (located in Britain).

This theory has it that, in an open tent after his lunch, Alexander was consulting with his insubordinate troops, who compared him to his cousin <a href="Elagabalus">Elagabalus</a>, the divisive and unpopular Emperor whose own assassination paved the way for Alexander's reign. A German servant entered the tent and initiated the call for Alexander's assassination, at which point many of the troops joined in the attack. Alexander's attendants fought against the other troops but could not hold off the combined might of those seeking the Emperor's assassination. Within minutes, Alexander was dead.

After Alexander's death his economic policies were completely discarded, and the Roman currency was devalued. This marked the beginning of the Crisis of the Third Century, a time period in which the Roman empire came close to falling apart entirely.

Alexander was the last of the Syrian emperors and the first emperor to be overthrown by military discontent on a wide scale. His death signaled the end of the <a href="Severan%20dynasty">Severan dynasty</a> and the beginning of the chaotic period known as the <a href="Crisis%20of%20the%20Third%20Century">Crisis of the Third Century</a>, which brought the empire to near collapse.

Alexander's death at the hands of his troops can also be seen as the heralding of a new role for Roman emperors. Though they were not yet expected to personally fight in battle during Alexander's time, emperors were increasingly expected to display general competence in military affairs. Thus, Alexander's taking of his mother's advice to not get involved in battle, his dishonorable and unsoldierly methods of dealing with the Germanic threat, and the relative failure of his military campaign against the Persians were all deemed highly unacceptable by the soldiers. Indeed, Maximinus was able to overthrow Alexander by "harping on his own military excellence in contrast to that feeble coward." Yet by arrogating the power to dethrone their emperor, the legions paved the way for a half-century of widespread chaos and instability.

Alexander's reign was also characterized by a significant breakdown of military discipline. In 223, the <a href="Praetorian%20Guard">Praetorian Guard</a> murdered their <a href="Praetorian%20prefect">prefect</a>, Ulpian, in Alexander's presence and despite the emperor's pleas. The soldiers then fought a three-day battle against the populace of Rome, and this battle ended after several parts of the city were set on fire.

Dio was among those who gave a highly critical account of military discipline during the time, saying that they would rather just surrender to the enemy. Different reasons are given for this breakdown of military discipline: Campbell points to "...the decline in the prestige of the Severan dynasty, the feeble nature of Alexander himself, who appeared to be no soldier and to be completely dominated by his mother's advice, and lack of real military success at a time during which the empire was coming under increasing pressure."
Herodian, on the other hand, was convinced that "the emperor's miserliness (partly the result of his mother's greed) and slowness to bestow donatives" were instrumental in the fall of military discipline under Alexander.

According to Canduci, Alexander is remembered as an emperor who was "level headed, well meaning, and conscientious," but his fatal flaw was his domination by his mother and grandmother. Not only did this undermine his authority, but his mother's influence was the cause of Alexander's least popular actions (convincing him not to take part in battle and trying to buy off the warring Germanic barbarians).

Although the Senate declared the emperor and his rule damned upon the report of his death and the ascension of a replacement emperor, Alexander was <a href="Apotheosis">deified</a> after the death of Maximinus in 238. His "<a href="Damnatio%20memoriae">Damnatio memoriae</a>" was also reversed after Maximinus's death.

Severus Alexander became emperor when he was 13 years old, making him the youngest emperor in Rome's history, until the ascension of <a href="Gordian%20III">Gordian III</a>. Alexander's grandmother believed that he had more potential to rule than her other grandson, the increasingly unpopular emperor <a href="Elagabalus">Elagabalus</a>, whom Alexander replaced. Thus, to preserve her own position, she had Elagabalus adopt the young Alexander and then arranged for Elagabulus' assassination, securing the throne for Alexander. The Roman army hailed Alexander as emperor on March 13, 222, immediately instilling him with the titles of Augustus," pater patriae", and "pontifex maximus."

Throughout his life, Alexander relied heavily on guidance from his grandmother, Maesa, and mother, <a href="Julia%20Avita%20Mamaea">Julia Mamaea</a>. Maesa died in 223, leaving Mamaea as the sole influence upon Alexander's actions.

As a young, immature, and inexperienced 13-year-old, Alexander knew little about government, warcraft, or the role of ruling over an empire. Because of this, throughout his entire reign he was a puppet of his mother's advice and entirely under her jurisdiction, a prospect that was not popular among the soldiers.

Alexander was married three times. His most famous wife was <a href="Sallustia%20Orbiana">Sallustia Orbiana</a>, "<a href="Augusta%20%28honorific%29">Augusta</a>," whom he married in 225 when she was 16 years old. Their marriage was arranged by Alexander's mother, Mamaea. However, as soon as Orbiana received the title of "Augusta," Mamaea became increasingly jealous and resentful of Alexander's wife due to Mamaea's excessive desire of all regal female titles. Alexander divorced and exiled Orbiana in 227, after her father, <a href="Seius%20Sallustius">Seius Sallustius</a>, was executed after being accused of attempting to assassinate the emperor.

Alexander's second wife was Sulpicia Memmia, a member of one of the most ancient Patrician families in Rome. Her father was a man of consular rank; her grandfather's name was "Catulus".

The identity of Alexander's third wife is unknown. Alexander did not father children with any of his wives.

According to the <a href="Augustan%20History">Augustan History</a>, a late Roman work containing biographies of emperors and others, and considered by scholars to be a work of very dubious historical reliability, Alexander prayed every morning in his private chapel. He was extremely tolerant of <a href="Jews">Jews</a> and Christians alike. He continued all privileges towards Jews during his reign, and the Augustan History relates that Alexander placed images of Abraham and Jesus in his oratory, along with other Roman deities and classical figures.

<doc id="1606" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1606" title="Alexander Jannaeus">
Alexander Jannaeus

Alexander Jannaeus (also known as Alexander Jannai/Yannai; <a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a>: אלכסנדר ינאי) was the second <a href="Hasmonean%20dynasty">Hasmonean</a> king of Judaea from 103 to 76 BC. A son of <a href="John%20Hyrcanus">John Hyrcanus</a>, he inherited the throne from his brother <a href="Aristobulus%20I">Aristobulus I</a>, and married his brother's widow, Queen <a href="Salome%20Alexandra">Salome Alexandra</a>. From his conquests to expand the kingdom to a bloody civil war, Alexander's reign has been generalized as cruel and oppressive with never ending conflict. Although Josephus and other historians refer to him by the name of "Alexander Yannai", his full name was "Alexander Jonathan" as attested to by his coins wherein he calls himself "Yehonathan the king".

Alexander Jannaeus was the third son of John Hyrcanus, by his second wife. When Aristobulus I, Hyrcanus' son by his first wife, became king, he deemed it necessary for his own security to imprison his half-brother. Aristobulus died after a reign of one year. Upon his death, his widow, <a href="Salome%20Alexandra">Salome Alexandra</a> had Alexander and his brothers released from prison.

Alexander, as the oldest living brother, had the right not only to the throne but also to Salome, the widow of his deceased brother, who had died childless; and, although she was thirteen years older than him, he married her in accordance with Jewish law. By her, he had two sons, the eldest, <a href="Hyrcanus%20II">Hyrcanus II</a> became high-priest in 62 BC and <a href="Aristobulus%20II">Aristobulus II</a> who was high-priest from 66 - 62 BC and started a bloody civil war with his brother, ending in his capture by <a href="Pompey">Pompey the Great</a>. Like his brother he was an avid supporter of the aristocratic priestly faction known as the <a href="Sadducees">Sadducees</a>, his wife Salome on the other hand came from a <a href="pharisaic">pharisaic</a> family (her brother was <a href="Simeon%20ben%20Shetach">Simeon ben Shetach</a> a famous pharisee leader), and was more sympathetic to their cause and protected them throughout his turbulent reign. Like his father Alexander also served as the high priest. This raised the ire of the Rabbis who insisted that these two offices should not be combined. According to the Talmud Yannai was a questionable desecrated priest (rumor had it that his mother was captured in Modiin and violated) and was not allowed to serve in the temple according to the rabbis, this infuriated the king and sided with the Sadducees who defended him. This incident led the king to turn against the pharisees and persecute them until his death.

Alexander's first expedition was against the city of Ptolemais (<a href="Akko">Acre</a>). While Alexander went forward to siege the city, Zoilus, ruler of the coastal city <a href="Dor%2C%20Israel">Dora</a> and <a href="Caesarea%20Maritima">Straton's Tower</a> took the opportunity to see if he could perhaps save Ptolemais in hopes of gaining territory. Alexander's Hasmonean army quickly defeated Zoilus's forces with little trouble. Ptolemais and Zoilus then requested aid from <a href="Ptolemy%20IX%20Lathyros">Ptolemy IX Lathyros</a>, who had been cast out by his mother <a href="Cleopatra%20III%20of%20Egypt">Cleopatra III</a>. Ptolemy founded a kingdom in <a href="History%20of%20Cyprus">Cyprus</a> after being cast out by his mother. The situation at Ptolemais was seized as an opportunity by Ptolemy to possibly gain a stronghold and control the Judean coast in order to invade Egypt.

Ptolemy landed a large army for the relief of the town; but Alexander met him with treachery, arranging an alliance with him openly while secretly he sought to obtain the help of his mother against him. When Alexander formed an alliance with Ptolemy, Ptolemy in good gesture, handed over Ptolemais, Zoilus, Dora, and Straton's Tower to Alexander. As soon as Ptolemy learned of Alexander's scheme, he invaded the <a href="Galilee">Galilee region</a> capturing <a href="Shikhin">Asochis</a>. Ptolemy also initiated an attack upon <a href="Sepphoris">Sepphoris</a> but failed.

Alexander might easily have lost his crown and Judea its independence as the result of this battle, had it not been for the assistance extended by Egypt. Cleopatra's two Jewish generals, Helkias and Ananias, persuaded the queen of the dangers of allowing her banished son Ptolemy to remain victorious and she entrusted them with an army against him. As a result, Ptolemy was forced to withdraw to Cyprus, and Alexander was saved. The Egyptians, as compensation for their aid, desired to annex Judea to their country, but considerations touching the resident Egyptian Jews, who were the main support of her throne, induced Cleopatra to modify her longings for conquest. The Egyptian army withdrawn, Alexander found his hands free; and forthwith he planned new campaigns.

Alexander captured <a href="Gadara">Gadara</a> and the strong fortress <a href="Amathus%20%28Transjordan%29">Amathus</a> in the <a href="Transjordan%20%28region%29">Transjordan</a> region; but, in an ambush set for him by Theodorus, ruler of Amathus, he lost the battle. Alexander was more successful in his expedition against the Hellenized coastal cities (what had once been <a href="Philistia">Philistia</a>), capturing <a href="Rafah">Raphia</a> and <a href="Anthedon%20%28Palestine%29">Anthedon</a>. Finally, in 96 BC Jannaeus outlasted the inhabitants of <a href="Gaza%20City">Gaza</a> in a year-long siege, which he occupied through treachery, and gave up to be pillaged and burned by his soldiery. This victory gained Judean control over the Mediterranean outlet for the <a href="Nabataean%20kingdom">Nabatean</a> trade routes.

The Judean Civil War initially began after the conquest of Gaza by Jannaeus around 99 BC. Due to Jannaeus's victory at Gaza, the Nabatean kingdom no longer controlled their main trade route to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> at Gaza and to the road leading to Damascus. Therefore, the Nabatean king <a href="Obodas%20I">Obodas I</a> launched an ambush on Alexander in a steep valley in <a href="Gadara">Gadara</a> where Jannaeus "was lucky to escape alive". After Jannaeus was defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gadara">Battle of Gadara</a> against the Nabataeans, he returned to fierce Jewish opposition in Jerusalem. Alexander had to cede the acquired territories to the Nabataeans so that he could dissuade Obodas from supporting his opponents in Judea.

During the Jewish holiday of <a href="Sukkot">Feast of Tabernacles</a>, Alexander Jannaeus, while officiating as the <a href="High%20Priest%20of%20Israel">High Priest</a> at the Temple in Jerusalem, demonstrated his support of the <a href="Sadducees">Sadducees</a> by refusing to perform the water <a href="libation">libation</a> ceremony properly: instead of pouring it on the altar, he poured it on his feet. The crowd responded with shock at his mockery and showed their displeasure by pelting Alexander with the <a href="etrog">etrog</a>im (<a href="citron">citron</a>s) that they were holding in their hands. Outraged, he ordered soldiers to kill those who insulted him, more than 6,000 people in the Temple courtyard were massacred. With further frustration, Alexander had wooden barriers build around the altars preventing people from sacrificing and deny daily offerings except for the priests. He also allied himself with foreign troops such as the <a href="Pisidia">Pisidia</a>ns and the <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>ns who would later help his regime during the civil war. This incident during the Feast of Tabernacles was a major factor leading up to the Judean Civil War by igniting popular opponents of Jannaeus.

Overall, the war lasted six years and left 50,000 Judeans dead. After Jannaeus succeeded early in the war, the rebels asked for Seleucid assistance. Judean insurgents joined forces with <a href="Demetrius%20III%20Eucaerus">Demetrius III Eucaerus</a> to fight against Jannaeus. The Seleucid forces defeated Jannaeus at <a href="Shechem">Shechem</a> and forced him to take refuge in the mountains. However, these Judean rebels ultimately decided that it was better to live under a terrible Jewish king than backtrack to a Seleucid ruler. After 6,000 Jews returned to Jannaeus, Demetrius was defeated. The end of the Civil War brought a sense of national solidarity against Seleucid influence. Nevertheless, Jannaeus was uninterested in reconciliation within the Judean State.

The aftermath of the Judean Civil War consisted of popular unrest, poverty and grief over the fallen soldiers on both sides. The greatest impact of the war was the victor's revenge. Josephus reports that Jannaeus brought 800 Pharisee rebels to Jerusalem and had them crucified, and had the throats of the rebel's wives and children cut before their eyes as Jannaeus ate with his concubines.

The coinage of Alexander Jannaeus is characteristic of the early Jewish coinage in that it avoided human or animal representations, in opposition to the surrounding Greek, and later Roman types of the period. Jewish coinage instead focused on symbols, either natural, such as the <a href="palm%20tree">palm tree</a>, the <a href="pomegranate">pomegranate</a> or the star, or man-made, such as the <a href="Temple%20in%20Jerusalem">Temple</a>, the <a href="Menorah%20%28Temple%29">Menorah</a>, trumpets or <a href="cornucopia">cornucopia</a>.
Alexander Jannaeus was the first of the Jewish kings to introduce the "eight-ray star" or "eight-spoked wheel" symbol, in his <a href="bronze">bronze</a> "Widow's mite" coins, in combination with the widespread <a href="Seleucid">Seleucid</a> numismatic symbol of the anchor. Depending on the make, the star symbol can be shown with straight spokes connected to the outside circle, in a style rather indicative of a wheel. On others, the spokes can have a more "flame-like" shape, more indicative of the representation of a star within a diadem.

It is not clear what the wheel or star may exactly symbolize, and interpretations vary, from the morning star, to the sun or the heavens. The influence of some <a href="Persia">Persia</a>n symbols of a star within a diadem, or the eight-spoked <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> wheel (see the coins of the <a href="Indo-Greek">Indo-Greek</a> king <a href="Menander%20I">Menander I</a> with this symbol) have also been suggested. The eight-spoked Macedonian star (a variation of which is the <a href="Vergina%20Sun">Vergina Sun</a>), emblem of the royal <a href="Argead%20dynasty">Argead dynasty</a> and the ancient kingdom of <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>ia, within a Hellenistic <a href="Diadem%20%28personal%20wear%29">diadem</a> symbolizing royalty (many of the coins depict a small knot with two ends on top of the diadem), seem to be the most probable source for this symbol.

The most likely explanation is that the symbol is a star encased in a diadem and it is a religious explanation. Biblical law forbids the making of graven images (especially see ), yet the image of a monarch is a staple of Hellenistic coins. In place of an image of himself, therefore, it is likely that Alexander Jannaeus chose a star, in keeping with , "A star rises from Jacob, a scepter comes forth from Israel". This verse generally was seen as a biblical support for monarchy (and specifically as support for a Davidic monarchy). Jannaeus, however, could have seen it as an image of his achievements, if not his own rule. This is how the rest of Numbers 24:17 and verses 18 and 19 continue: The star, it says, "smashes the brow of Moab, the foundation of all children of Seth. Edom becomes a possession, yea, Seir a possession of its enemies; but Israel is triumphant. A victor issues from Jacob to wipe out what is left of Ir". Considering Jannaeus' conquests—creating a kingdom that rivalled those of David and Solomon and may have even exceeded those—the "star" envisioned in the prophecy of Balaam in Numbers was a perfect match for him.

According to the orthodox <a href="Thomism">Thomism</a> of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> rightly regarded reason as a facility of the individual soul.

The Alexandrists, led by <a href="Pietro%20Pomponazzi">Pietro Pomponazzi</a>, assailed these beliefs and denied that either was rightly attributed to Aristotle.

Alexios I Komnenos (, c. 1048 – 15 August 1118) was <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> <a href="List%20of%20Byzantine%20Emperors">emperor</a> from 1081 to 1118. Although he was not the founder of the <a href="Komnenos">Komnenian dynasty</a>, it was during his reign that the Komnenos family came to full power. Inheriting a collapsing empire and faced with constant warfare during his reign against both the <a href="Seljuq%20Turks">Seljuq Turks</a> in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a> and the <a href="Italo-Normans">Normans</a> in the western <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>, Alexios was able to curb the Byzantine decline and begin the military, financial, and territorial recovery known as the "<a href="Komnenian%20restoration">Komnenian restoration</a>". The basis for this recovery were various reforms initiated by Alexios. His appeals to Western Europe for help against the Turks were also the catalyst that likely contributed to the convoking of the <a href="Crusades">Crusades</a>.

Alexios was the son of the <a href="Domestic%20of%20the%20Schools">Domestic of the Schools</a> <a href="John%20Komnenos%20%28Domestic%20of%20the%20Schools%29">John Komnenos</a> and <a href="Anna%20Dalassena">Anna Dalassena</a>, and the nephew of <a href="Isaac%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI%20Komnenos">Isaac I Komnenos</a> (emperor 1057–1059). Alexios' father declined the throne on the abdication of Isaac, who was thus succeeded by four emperors of other families between 1059 and 1081. Under one of these emperors, <a href="Romanos%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIV%20Diogenes">Romanos IV Diogenes</a> (1067–1071), Alexios served with distinction against the <a href="Seljuq%20Turks">Seljuq Turks</a>. Under <a href="Michael%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVII%20Doukas">Michael VII Doukas</a> "Parapinakes" (1071–1078) and <a href="Nikephoros%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII%20Botaneiates">Nikephoros III Botaneiates</a> (1078–1081), he was also employed, along with his elder brother <a href="Isaac%20Komnenos%20%28brother%20of%20Alexios%20I%29">Isaac</a>, against rebels in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, and in <a href="Epirus">Epirus</a>.

In 1074, western mercenaries led by <a href="Roussel%20de%20Bailleul">Roussel de Bailleul</a> rebelled in Asia Minor, but Alexios successfully subdued them by 1076. In 1078, he was appointed commander of the field army in the West by Nikephoros III. In this capacity, Alexios defeated the rebellions of <a href="Nikephoros%20Bryennios%20the%20Elder">Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder</a> (whose son or grandson later married Alexios' daughter Anna) and <a href="Nikephoros%20Basilakes">Nikephoros Basilakes</a>, the first at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kalavrye">Battle of Kalavrye</a> and the latter in a surprise night attack on his camp. Alexios was ordered to march against his brother-in-law <a href="Nikephoros%20Melissenos">Nikephoros Melissenos</a> in Asia Minor but refused to fight his kinsman. This did not, however, lead to a demotion, as Alexios was needed to counter the expected invasion of the <a href="Italo-Normans">Normans</a> of Southern Italy, led by <a href="Robert%20Guiscard">Robert Guiscard</a>.

While Byzantine troops were assembling for the expedition, the Doukas faction at court approached Alexios and convinced him to join a <a href="conspiracy%20%28political%29">conspiracy</a> against Nikephoros III. The mother of Alexios, Anna Dalassena, was to play a prominent role in this coup d'état of 1081, along with the current empress, <a href="Maria%20of%20Alania">Maria of Alania</a>. First married to Michael VII Doukas and secondly to <a href="Nikephoros%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII%20Botaneiates">Nikephoros III Botaneiates</a>, she was preoccupied with the future of her son by Michael VII, <a href="Constantine%20Doukas">Constantine Doukas</a>. Nikephoros III intended to leave the throne to one of his close relatives, and this resulted in Maria's ambivalence and alliance with the Komnenoi, though the real driving force behind this political alliance was Anna Dalassena.

The empress was already closely connected to the Komnenoi through Maria's cousin Irene's marriage to Isaac Komnenos, so the Komnenoi brothers were able to see her under the pretense of a friendly family visit. Furthermore, to aid the conspiracy Maria had adopted Alexios as her son, though she was only five years older than he. Maria was persuaded to do so on the advice of her own "Alans" and her eunuchs, who had been instigated by Isaac Komnenos. Given Anna's tight hold on her family, Alexios must have been adopted with her implicit approval. As a result, Alexios and Constantine, Maria's son, were now adoptive brothers, and both Isaac and Alexios took an oath that they would safeguard his rights as emperor. By secretly giving inside information to the Komnenoi, Maria was an invaluable ally.

As stated in the Alexiad, Isaac and Alexios left Constantinople in mid-February 1081 to raise an army against Botaneiates. However, when the time came, Anna quickly and surreptitiously mobilized the remainder of the family and took refuge in the <a href="Hagia%20Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a>. From there she negotiated with the emperor for the safety of family members left in the capital, while protesting her sons' innocence of hostile actions. Under the falsehood of making a vesperal visit to worship at the church, she deliberately excluded the grandson of Botaneiates and his loyal tutor, met with Alexios and Isaac, and fled for the forum of Constantine. The tutor discovered they were missing and eventually found them on the palace grounds, but Anna was able to convince him that they would return to the palace shortly. Then to gain entrance to both the outer and inner sanctuary of the church, the women pretended to the gatekeepers that they were pilgrims from <a href="Cappadocia">Cappadocia</a> who had spent all their funds and wanted to worship before starting their return trip. However, before they were to gain entry into the sanctuary, Straboromanos and royal guards caught up with them to summon them back to the palace. Anna then protested that the family was in fear for their lives, her sons were loyal subjects (Alexios and Isaac were discovered absent without leave), and had learned of a plot by enemies of the Komnenoi to have them both blinded and had, therefore, fled the capital so they may continue to be of loyal service to the emperor. She refused to go with them and demanded that they allow her to pray to the <a href="Mother%20of%20God">Mother of God</a> for protection. This request was granted and Anna then manifested her true theatrical and manipulative capabilities:

Nikephoros III Botaneiates was forced into a public vow that he would grant protection to the family. Straboromanos tried to give Anna his cross, but for her it was not sufficiently large enough for all bystanders to witness the oath. She also demanded that the cross be personally sent by Botaneiates as a vow of his good faith. He obliged, sending a complete assurance for the family with his own cross. At the emperor's further insistence, and for their own protection, they took refuge at the convent of Petrion, where they were eventually joined by <a href="Maria%20of%20Bulgaria">Maria of Bulgaria</a>, mother of Irene Doukaina. Botaneiates allowed them to be treated as refugees rather than as guests. They were allowed to have family members bring in their own food and were on good terms with the guards from whom they learned the latest news. Anna was highly successful in three important aspects of the revolt: she bought time for her sons to steal imperial horses from the stables and escape the city; she distracted the emperor, giving her sons time to gather and arm their troops; and she gave a false sense of security to Botaneiates that there was no real treasonous coup against him. After bribing the Western troops guarding the city, Isaac and Alexios Komnenos entered the capital victoriously on April 1, 1081.

During this time, Alexios was rumored to be the lover of Empress <a href="Maria%20Bagrationi">Maria of Alania</a>, the daughter of King <a href="Bagrat%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIV%20of%20Georgia">Bagrat IV of Georgia</a>, who had been successively married to <a href="Michael%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVII">Michael VII</a> Doukas and his successor Nikephoros III Botaneiates, and who was renowned for her beauty. Alexios arranged for Maria to stay on the palace grounds, and it was thought that he was considering marrying her. However, his mother consolidated the Doukas family connection by arranging the Emperor's marriage to <a href="Irene%20Doukaina">Irene Doukaina</a>, granddaughter of the <a href="John%20Doukas%2C%20Caesar">Caesar John Doukas</a>, the uncle of Michael VII, who would not have supported Alexios otherwise. As a measure intended to keep the support of the Doukai, Alexios restored <a href="Constantine%20Doukas%20%28co-emperor%29">Constantine Doukas</a>, the young son of Michael VII and Maria, as co-emperor and a little later betrothed him to his own first-born daughter <a href="Anna%20Komnene">Anna</a>, who moved into the Mangana Palace with her fiancé and his mother.

This situation changed drastically, however, when Alexios' first son <a href="John%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%20Komnenos">John II Komnenos</a> was born in 1087: Anna's engagement to Constantine was dissolved, and she was moved to the main Palace to live with her mother and grandmother. Alexios became estranged from Maria, who was stripped of her imperial title and retired to a monastery, and Constantine Doukas was deprived of his status as co-emperor. Nevertheless, he remained in good relations with the imperial family and succumbed to his weak constitution soon afterwards.

The nearly thirty-seven year reign of Alexios was full of struggle. At the outset he faced the formidable attack of the Normans, led by <a href="Robert%20Guiscard">Robert Guiscard</a> and his son <a href="Bohemond%20I%20of%20Antioch">Bohemund</a>, who took <a href="Dyrrhachium">Dyrrhachium</a> and <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a> and laid siege to <a href="Larissa">Larissa</a> in <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> (see <a href="Battle%20of%20Dyrrhachium%20%281081%29">Battle of Dyrrhachium</a>). Alexios suffered several defeats before he was able to strike back with success. He enhanced his resistance by bribing the German king <a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry IV</a> with 360,000 gold pieces to attack the Normans in Italy, which forced the Normans to concentrate on their defenses at home in 1083–84. He also secured the alliance of <a href="Henry%2C%20Count%20of%20Monte%20Sant%27Angelo">Henry, Count of Monte Sant'Angelo</a>, who controlled the <a href="Gargano%20Peninsula">Gargano Peninsula</a> and dated his charters by Alexios' reign. Henry's allegiance would be the last example of Byzantine political control on peninsular Italy. The Norman danger subsided with the death of Guiscard in 1085, and the Byzantines recovered most of their losses.

Alexios next had to deal with disturbances in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, where the heretical sects of the <a href="Bogomils">Bogomils</a> and the <a href="Paulicians">Paulicians</a> revolted and made common cause with the <a href="Pechenegs">Pechenegs</a> from beyond the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>. Paulician soldiers in imperial service likewise deserted during Alexios' battles with the Normans. As soon as the Norman threat had passed, Alexios set out to punish the rebels and deserters, confiscating their lands. This led to a further revolt near <a href="Plovdiv">Philippopolis</a>, and the commander of the field army in the west, Gregory Pakourianos, was defeated and killed in the ensuing battle. In 1087 the Pechenegs raided into Thrace, and Alexios crossed into <a href="Moesia">Moesia</a> to retaliate but failed to take Dorostolon (<a href="Silistra">Silistra</a>). During his retreat, the emperor was surrounded and worn down by the Pechenegs, who forced him to sign a truce and to pay protection money. In 1090 the Pechenegs invaded Thrace again, while <a href="Tzachas">Tzachas</a>, the brother-in-law of the Sultan of <a href="Sultanate%20of%20R%C3%BBm">Rum</a>, launched a fleet and attempted to arrange a joint siege of Constantinople with the Pechenegs. Alexios overcame this crisis by entering into an alliance with a horde of 40,000 <a href="Cumans">Cumans</a>, with whose help he crushed the Pechenegs at <a href="Battle%20of%20Levounion">Levounion</a> in Thrace on 29 April 1091.

This put an end to the Pecheneg threat, but in 1094 the Cumans began to raid the imperial territories in the Balkans. Led by a pretender claiming to be <a href="Constantine%20Diogenes%20%28pretender%29">Constantine Diogenes</a>, a long-dead son of the Emperor <a href="Romanos%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIV">Romanos IV</a>, the Cumans crossed the mountains and raided into eastern Thrace until their leader was eliminated at <a href="Adrianople">Adrianople</a>. With the Balkans more or less pacified, Alexios could now turn his attention to <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, which had been almost completely overrun by the <a href="Seljuq%20Turks">Seljuq Turks</a>.

By the time Alexios ascended the throne, the Seljuqs had taken most of Asia Minor. Alexios was able to secure much of the coastal regions by sending peasant soldiers to raid the Seljuq camps, but these victories were unable to stop the Turks altogether. As early as 1090, Alexios had taken reconciliatory measures towards the <a href="Papacy">Papacy</a>, with the intention of seeking western support against the Seljuqs. In 1095 his ambassadors appeared before <a href="Pope%20Urban%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Pope Urban II</a> at the <a href="Council%20of%20Piacenza">Council of Piacenza</a>. The help he sought from the West was simply some <a href="mercenary">mercenary</a> forces, not the immense hosts that arrived, to his consternation and embarrassment, after the pope preached the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a> at the <a href="Council%20of%20Clermont">Council of Clermont</a> later that same year. Not quite ready to supply this number of people as they traversed his territories, the emperor saw his Balkan possessions subjected to further pillage at the hands of his own allies. Alexios dealt with the first disorganized group of Crusaders, led by the preacher <a href="Peter%20the%20Hermit">Peter the Hermit</a>, by sending them on to Asia Minor, where they were massacred by the Turks in 1096.

The second and much more formidable host of crusaders gradually made its way to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, led in sections by <a href="Godfrey%20of%20Bouillon">Godfrey of Bouillon</a>, <a href="Bohemond%20I%20of%20Antioch">Bohemond of Taranto</a>, <a href="Raymond%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIV%20of%20Toulouse">Raymond IV of Toulouse</a>, and other important members of the western nobility. Alexios used the opportunity to meet the crusader leaders separately as they arrived, extracting from them oaths of homage and the promise to turn over conquered lands to the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a>. Transferring each contingent into Asia, Alexios promised to supply them with provisions in return for their oaths of homage. The crusade was a notable success for Byzantium, as Alexios recovered a number of important cities and islands. The <a href="siege%20of%20Nicaea">siege of Nicaea</a> by the crusaders forced the city to surrender to the emperor in 1097, and the subsequent crusader victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Dorylaeum%20%281097%29">Dorylaion</a> allowed the Byzantine forces to recover much of western Asia Minor. <a href="John%20Doukas%20%28megas%20doux%29">John Doukas</a> re-established Byzantine rule in <a href="Chios">Chios</a>, <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>, <a href="Smyrna">Smyrna</a>, <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a>, <a href="Sardis">Sardis</a>, and <a href="Ala%C5%9Fehir">Philadelphia</a> in 1097–1099. This success is ascribed by Alexios' daughter Anna to his policy and diplomacy, but by the Latin historians of the crusade to his treachery and deception. In 1099, a Byzantine fleet of ten ships was sent to assist the crusaders in capturing <a href="Laodicea%20in%20Syria">Laodicea</a> and other coastal towns as far as <a href="Tripoli%2C%20Lebanon">Tripoli</a>. The crusaders believed their oaths were made invalid when the Byzantine contingent under <a href="Tatikios">Tatikios</a> failed to help them during the <a href="siege%20of%20Antioch">siege of Antioch</a>; Bohemund, who had set himself up as <a href="Principality%20of%20Antioch">Prince of Antioch</a>, briefly went to war with Alexios in the Balkans, but he was blockaded by the Byzantine forces and agreed to become a vassal of Alexios by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Devol">Treaty of Devol</a> in 1108.

In 1116, though already terminally ill, Alexios conducted a series of defensive operations in Bythinia and Mysia to defend his Anatolian territories against the inroads of <a href="Malik%20Shah%20%28R%C3%BBm%29">Malik Shah</a>, the Seljuq Sultan of Iconium. In 1117 he moved onto the offensive and pushed his army deep into the Turkish-dominated Anatolian Plateau, where he defeated the Seljuq sultan at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Philomelion">Battle of Philomelion</a>.

During the last twenty years of his life Alexios lost much of his popularity. The years were marked by persecution of the followers of the <a href="Paulicianism">Paulician</a> and <a href="Bogomilism">Bogomil</a> heresies—one of his last acts was to publicly burn at the stake <a href="Basil%20the%20Physician">Basil</a>, a Bogomil leader, with whom he had engaged in a theological dispute. In spite of the success of the First Crusade, Alexios also had to repel numerous attempts on his territory by the Seljuqs in 1110–1117.

Alexios was for many years under the strong influence of an "eminence grise", his mother <a href="Anna%20Dalassene">Anna Dalassene</a>, a wise and immensely able politician whom, in a uniquely irregular fashion, he had crowned as "<a href="Augusta%20%28honorific%29">Augusta</a>" instead of the rightful claimant to the title, his wife Irene Doukaina. Dalassena was the effective administrator of the Empire during Alexios' long absences in military campaigns: she was constantly at odds with her daughter-in-law and had assumed total responsibility for the upbringing and education of her granddaughter Anna Komnene.

Alexios' last years were also troubled by anxieties over the succession. Although he had crowned his son <a href="John%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%20Komnenos">John II Komnenos</a> co-emperor at the age of five in 1092, his wife, Irene Doukaina wished to alter the succession in favor of their daughter Anna and Anna's husband, <a href="Nikephoros%20Bryennios%20the%20Younger">Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger</a>. Bryennios had been made "<a href="Caesar%20%28title%29">kaisar</a>" (Caesar) and received the newly created title of "<a href="panhypersebastos">panhypersebastos</a>" ("honoured above all"), and remained loyal to both Alexios and John. Nevertheless, the intrigues of Irene and Anna disturbed even Alexios' dying hours.

Apart from all of his external enemies, a host of rebels also sought to overthrow Alexios from the imperial throne, thereby posing another major threat to his reign. Due to the troubled times the empire was enduring, he had by far the greatest number of rebellions against him of all the Byzantine emperors. These included:



Under Alexios the debased "<a href="solidus%20%28coin%29">solidus</a>" ("<a href="tetarteron">tetarteron</a>" and "<a href="histamenon">histamenon</a>") was discontinued and a gold coinage of higher fineness (generally .900–.950) was established in 1092, commonly called the "<a href="hyperpyron">hyperpyron</a>" at 4.45 grs. The "hyperpyron" was slightly smaller than the "solidus".

It was introduced along with the <a href="electrum">electrum</a> "<a href="aspron%20trachy">aspron trachy</a>" worth a third of a "hyperpyron" and about 25% gold and 75% silver, the <a href="Billon%20%28alloy%29">billon</a> "aspron trachy" or "<a href="stamenon">stamenon</a>", valued at 48 to the "hyperpyron" and with 7% silver wash and the copper "<a href="tetarteron">tetarteron</a>" and "<a href="noummion">noummion</a>" worth 18 and 36 to the billon "aspron trachy".

Alexios' reform of the Byzantine monetary system was an important basis for the financial recovery and therefore supported the so-called <a href="Komnenian%20restoration">Komnenian restoration</a>, as the new coinage restored financial confidence.

Alexios I had overcome a dangerous crisis and stabilized the Byzantine Empire, inaugurating a century of imperial prosperity and success. He had also profoundly altered the nature of the Byzantine government. By seeking close alliances with powerful noble families, Alexios put an end to the tradition of imperial exclusivity and co-opted most of the nobility into his extended family and, through it, his government. Those who did not become part of this extended family were deprived of power and prestige. This measure, which was intended to diminish opposition, was paralleled by the introduction of new courtly dignities, like that of "<a href="panhypersebastos">panhypersebastos</a>" given to Nikephoros Bryennios, or that of "<a href="sebastokrator">sebastokrator</a>" given to the emperor's brother Isaac Komnenos. Although this policy met with initial success, it gradually undermined the relative effectiveness of imperial bureaucracy by placing family connections over merit. Alexios' policy of integration of the nobility bore the fruit of continuity: every Byzantine emperor who reigned after Alexios I Komnenos was related to him by either descent or marriage.

By his marriage with <a href="Irene%20Doukaina">Irene Doukaina</a>, Alexios I had the following children:

Alexis (poet)

Alexis (; c. 375 – c. 275 BC) was a <a href="Greece">Greek</a> <a href="comedian">comic</a> <a href="poet">poet</a> of the <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20comedy">Middle Comedy</a> period. He was born at <a href="Thurii">Thurii</a> (in present-day Calabria, Italy) in <a href="Magna%20Graecia">Magna Graecia</a> and taken early to <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, where he became a citizen, being enrolled in the <a href="deme">deme</a> "Oion" () and the tribe Leontides. It is thought he lived to the age of 106 and died on the stage while being crowned. According to the "<a href="Suda">Suda</a>", a 10th-century <a href="encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>, Alexis was the paternal uncle of the dramatist <a href="Menander">Menander</a> and wrote 245 comedies, of which only fragments now survive, including some 130 preserved titles.

It was said he had a son, called Stephanus, who also wrote comedies. He appears to have been rather addicted to the pleasures of the table, according to <a href="Athenaeus">Athenaeus</a>.

He won his first <a href="Lenaean">Lenaean</a> victory in the 350s BC, most likely, where he was sixth after <a href="Eubulus%20%28poet%29">Eubulus</a>, and fourth after <a href="Antiphanes%20%28comic%20poet%29">Antiphanes</a>. While being a Middle Comic poet, Alexis was contemporary with several leading figures of New Comedy, such as Philippides, <a href="Philemon%20%28poet%29">Philemon</a>, <a href="Diphilus">Diphilus</a>, and even Menander. There is also some evidence that, during his old age, he wrote plays in the style of New Comedy.

<a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> says that he lived to the age of 106 and 5 months, and that he died on the stage while being crowned victor. He was certainly alive after 345 BC, for <a href="Aeschines">Aeschines</a> mentions him as alive in that year. He was also living at least as late as 288 BC, from which his birth date is calculated. According to the "<a href="Suda">Suda</a>" he wrote 245 comedies, of which only fragments including some 130 titles survive. His plays include "Meropis", "Ankylion", "Olympiodoros", "Parasitos" (exhibited in 360 BC, in which he ridiculed <a href="Plato">Plato</a>), "Agonis" (in which he ridiculed Misgolas), and the "Adelphoi" and the "Stratiotes", in which he satirized <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a>, and acted shortly after 343 BC.
Also "Hippeis" (316 BC) (in which he referred to the decree of <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a> against the philosophers), "Pyraunos" (312 BC), "Pharmakopole" (306 BC) , "Hypobolimaios" (306 BC), and "Ankylion".

Because he wrote a lot of plays, the same passages often appear in more than 3 plays. It was said that he also borrowed from Eubulus and many other playwrights in some of his plays. According to <a href="Carystius">Carytius of Pergamum</a>, Alexis was the first to use the part of the parasite. Alexis was known in <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> times; <a href="Aulus%20Gellius">Aulus Gellius</a> noted that Alexis' poetry was used by Roman comedians, including <a href="Turpilius">Turpilius</a> and possibly <a href="Plautus">Plautus</a>.

Only fragments have survived from any of Alexis's plays - about 340 in all, totaling about 1,000 lines. They attest to the author's wit and refinement, which Athenaeus praises. The surviving fragments also show that Alexis invented a great many words, mostly compound words, that he used normal words in an unusual way, and made strange and unusual forms of common words. The main sources of the fragments of Alexis are <a href="Stobaeus">Stobaeus</a> and Athenaeus.

The following 139 titles of Alexis's plays have been preserved:

Alexios II Komnenos

Alexios II Komnenos or Alexius II Comnenus () (10 September 1169October 1183) was <a href="Byzantine%20emperor">Byzantine emperor</a> from 1180 to 1183. He was the son of Emperor <a href="Manuel%20I%20Komnenos">Manuel I Komnenos</a> and <a href="Maria%20of%20Antioch">Maria</a>, daughter of <a href="Raymond%20of%20Antioch">Raymond of Poitiers</a>, <a href="Principality%20of%20Antioch">prince of Antioch</a>. He was the long-awaited male heir and was named Alexius as a fulfilment of the <a href="AIMA%20prophecy">AIMA prophecy</a>.

On Manuel's death in 1180, Maria, who became a nun under the name Xene, took the position of regent (according to some historians). She excluded her young son from power, entrusting it instead to Alexios the "<a href="protosebastos">prōtosebastos</a>" (a cousin of Alexios II), who was popularly believed to be her lover. Friends of the young Alexios II now tried to form a party against the empress mother and the "prōtosebastos"; Alexios II's half-sister Maria, wife of Caesar John (<a href="Renier%20of%20Montferrat">Renier of Montferrat</a>), stirred up riots in the streets of the capital.

Their party was defeated on 2 May 1182, but <a href="Andronikos%20I%20Komnenos">Andronikos Komnenos</a>, a first cousin of Emperor Manuel, took advantage of the disorder to aim at the crown. He entered Constantinople, received with almost divine honours, and overthrew the government. His arrival was celebrated by a <a href="Massacre%20of%20the%20Latins">massacre of 80,000 Latins</a> in Constantinople, especially the <a href="Venice">Venetian</a> merchants, which he made no attempt to stop. He allowed Alexios II to be crowned but was responsible for the death of most of the young emperor's actual or potential defenders, including his mother, his half-sister, and the Caesar, and he refused to allow him any voice in public affairs.

The betrothal in 1180 of Alexios II to <a href="Agnes%20of%20France%2C%20Byzantine%20Empress">Agnes of France</a>, daughter of <a href="Louis%20VII%20of%20France">Louis VII of France</a> and his third wife <a href="Ad%C3%A8le%20of%20Champagne">Adèle of Champagne</a> and at the time a child of nine, had not apparently been followed by their marriage. Andronikos was now formally proclaimed as co-emperor before the crowd on the terrace of the <a href="Arslan%20Hane%2C%20Istanbul">Church of Christ of the Chalkè</a>, and not long afterwards, on the pretext that divided rule was injurious to the Empire, he caused Alexios II to be strangled with a bow-string in October 1183. During the reign of Alexius II, the Byzantine Empire was invaded by King <a href="B%C3%A9la%20III">Béla III</a>, losing <a href="Syrmia">Syrmia</a> and <a href="Bosnia%20%28region%29">Bosnia</a> to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Kingdom of Hungary</a> in 1181; later even <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a> was lost to the Venetians. <a href="Kilij%20Arslan%20II">Kilij Arslan II</a> invaded the empire in 1182, defeating the Byzantines at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Cotyaeum">Siege of Cotyaeum</a>, resulting in the Empire losing <a href="Cotyaeum">Cotyaeum</a> and <a href="Sozopolis%2C%20Pisidia">Sozopolis</a>.

Alexios is a character in the historical novel "Agnes of France" (1980) by <a href="Greece">Greek</a> writer <a href="Kostas%20Kyriazis">Kostas Kyriazis</a>. The novel describes the events of the reigns of Manuel I, Alexios II, and Andronikos I through the eyes of Agnes.

Alexios III Angelos () (1211) was <a href="Byzantine%20Emperors">Byzantine Emperor</a> from March 1195 to July 17/18, 1203. A member of the extended imperial family, Alexios came to throne after deposing, blinding, and imprisoning his younger brother <a href="Isaac%20II%20Angelos">Isaac II Angelos</a>. The most significant event of his reign was the attack of the <a href="Fourth%20Crusade">Fourth Crusade</a> on <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in 1203, on behalf of <a href="Alexios%20IV%20Angelos">Alexios IV Angelos</a>. Alexios III took over the defense of the city, which he mismanaged, then fled the city at night with one of his three daughters. From <a href="Adrianople">Adrianople</a>, and then <a href="Mosynopolis">Mosynopolis</a>, he unsuccessfully attempted to rally his supporters, only to end up a captive of Marquis <a href="Boniface%20of%20Montferrat">Boniface of Montferrat</a>. He was ransomed, sent to Asia Minor where he plotted against his son-in-law <a href="Theodore%20I%20Laskaris">Theodore Laskaris</a>, but was eventually arrested and spent his last days confined to the Monastery of Hyakinthos in <a href="Nicaea">Nicaea</a>, where he died.

Alexios III Angelos was the second son of <a href="Andronikos%20Doukas%20Angelos">Andronikos Doukas Angelos</a> and <a href="Euphrosyne%20Kastamonitissa">Euphrosyne Kastamonitissa</a>. Andronikos was himself a son of <a href="Theodora%20Komnene%20%28daughter%20of%20Alexios%20I%29">Theodora Komnene</a>, the youngest daughter of Emperor <a href="Alexios%20I%20Komnenos">Alexios I Komnenos</a> and <a href="Irene%20Doukaina">Irene Doukaina</a>. Thus Alexios Angelos was a member of the extended imperial family. Together with his father and brothers, Alexios had conspired against Emperor <a href="Andronikos%20I%20Komnenos">Andronikos I Komnenos</a> (), and thus he spent several years in exile in Muslim courts, including that of <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a>.

His younger brother <a href="Isaac%20II%20Angelos">Isaac</a> was threatened with execution under orders of Andronikos I, their first-cousin once-removed, on September 11, 1185. Isaac made a desperate attack on the imperial agents and soon killed their leader <a href="Stephen%20Hagiochristophorites">Stephen Hagiochristophorites</a>. He then took refuge in the church of <a href="Hagia%20Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a> and from there appealed to the populace. His actions provoked a riot, which resulted in the deposition of Andronikos I and the proclamation of Isaac as Emperor. Alexios was now closer to the imperial throne than ever before.

By 1190 Alexios had returned to the court of his younger brother, from whom he received the elevated title of "<a href="sebastokrator">sebastokratōr</a>". In March 1195 while Isaac II was away hunting in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, Alexios was acclaimed as emperor by the troops with the covert support of Alexios' wife <a href="Euphrosyne%20Doukaina%20Kamatera">Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera</a>. Alexios captured Isaac at <a href="Stagira">Stagira</a> in <a href="Macedonia%20%28region%29">Macedonia</a>, <a href="political%20mutilation%20in%20Byzantine%20culture">put out his eyes</a>, and thenceforth kept him a close prisoner, despite having previously been redeemed by Alexios from captivity at <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> and showered with honours.

To compensate for this crime and to solidify his position as emperor, Alexios had to scatter money so lavishly as to empty his treasury, and to allow such licence to the officers of the army as to leave the Empire practically defenceless. These actions inevitably led to the financial ruin of the state. At Christmas 1196, Holy Roman Emperor <a href="Henry%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry VI</a> attempted to force Alexios to pay him a tribute of 5,000 pounds (later negotiated down to 1,600 pounds) of gold or face invasion. Alexios gathered the money by plundering imperial tombs at the church of the Holy Apostles and <a href="Alamanikon">taxing the people heavily</a>, though Henry's death in September 1197 meant the gold was never dispatched. The able and forceful empress Euphrosyne tried in vain to sustain his credit and his court; Vatatzes, the favourite instrument in her attempts at reform, was <a href="assassination">assassinated</a> by the emperor's orders.

In the east the Empire was overrun by the <a href="Seljuk%20Turks">Seljuk Turks</a>; from the north, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Kingdom of Hungary</a> and the rebellious <a href="Bulgarians">Bulgarians</a> and <a href="Vlachs">Vlachs</a> descended unchecked to ravage the Balkan provinces of the Empire, sometimes penetrating as far as Greece, while Alexios squandered the public treasure on his palaces and gardens and attempted to deal with the crisis through diplomatic means. The Emperor's attempts to bolster the empire's defences by special concessions to <a href="pronoia">pronoia</a>rs (notables) in the frontier zone backfired, as the latter increased their regional autonomy. Byzantine authority survived, but in a much weakened state.

Soon Alexios was threatened by a new and more formidable danger. In 1202, soldiers assembled at <a href="Venice">Venice</a> to launch the <a href="Fourth%20Crusade">Fourth Crusade</a>. <a href="Alexios%20IV%20Angelos">Alexios IV Angelos</a>, the son of the deposed Isaac II, had recently escaped from <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and now appealed for support to the crusaders, promising to end the <a href="East-West%20Schism">schism</a> of <a href="Eastern%20Orthodoxy">East</a> and <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">West</a>, to pay for their transport, and to provide military support if they would help him depose his uncle and ascend to his father's throne.

The crusaders, whose objective had been <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, were persuaded to set their course for Constantinople, arriving there in June 1203, proclaiming Alexios IV as Emperor, and inviting the populace of the capital to depose his uncle. Alexios III took no effective measures to resist, and his attempts to bribe the crusaders failed. His son-in-law, <a href="Theodore%20I%20Laskaris">Theodore Laskaris</a>, who was the only one to attempt anything significant, was defeated at <a href="%C3%9Csk%C3%BCdar">Scutari</a>, and the siege of Constantinople began. Unfortunately for the city, misgovernment by Alexios III had left the Byzantine navy with only 20 worm-eaten hulks by the time the crusaders arrived.

In July, the crusaders, led by the aged <a href="Doge%20of%20Venice">Doge</a> <a href="Enrico%20Dandolo">Enrico Dandolo</a>, scaled the walls and took control of a major section of the city. In the ensuing fighting, the crusaders set the city on fire, ultimately leaving 20,000 people homeless. On 17 July Alexios III finally took action and led 17 divisions from the <a href="Gate%20of%20St.%20Romanus">St. Romanus Gate</a>, vastly outnumbering the crusaders. His courage failed, however, and the Byzantine army returned to the city without a fight. His courtiers demanded action, and Alexios III promised to fight. Instead, that night (July 17/18), Alexios III hid in the palace, and finally, with one of his daughters, Eirene, and as much treasure (1,000 pounds of gold) as he could collect, got into a boat and escaped to <a href="Debeltos">Debeltos</a> in Thrace, leaving his wife and his other daughters behind. Isaac II, drawn from his prison and robed once more in the imperial purple, received his son, Alexios IV, in state.

Alexios III attempted to organize resistance to the new regime from <a href="Adrianople">Adrianople</a> and then <a href="Mosynopolis">Mosynopolis</a>, where he was joined by the later usurper <a href="Alexios%20V%20Doukas">Alexios V Doukas "Mourtzouphlos"</a> in April 1204, after the definitive fall of Constantinople to the crusaders and the establishment of the <a href="Latin%20Empire">Latin Empire</a>. At first Alexios III received Alexios V well, even allowing him to marry his daughter <a href="Eudokia%20Angelina">Eudokia Angelina</a>. Later Alexios V was blinded and deserted by his father-in-law, who fled from the crusaders into <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a>. Here Alexios III eventually surrendered, with Euphrosyne, to Marquis <a href="Boniface%20of%20Montferrat">Boniface of Montferrat</a>, who was establishing himself as ruler of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Thessalonica">Kingdom of Thessalonica</a>.

Alexios III attempted to escape Boniface's "protection" in 1205, seeking shelter with <a href="Michael%20I%20Komnenos%20Doukas">Michael I Komnenos Doukas</a>, the ruler of <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">Epirus</a>. Captured by Boniface, Alexios and his retinue were sent to <a href="Montferrat">Montferrat</a> before being brought back to <a href="Thessalonica">Thessalonica</a> in . At that point the deposed emperor was ransomed by Michael I, who sent him to <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, where Alexios' son-in-law Theodore Laskaris - now <a href="Empire%20of%20Nicaea">emperor of Nicaea</a> - was holding his own against the Latins. Here Alexios conspired against his son-in-law after the latter refused to recognize Alexios' authority, receiving the support of <a href="Kaykhusraw%20I">Kaykhusraw I</a>, the <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Rum">sultan of Rûm</a>. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Antioch%20on%20the%20Meander">Battle of Antioch on the Meander</a> in 1211, the sultan was defeated and killed, and Alexios was captured by Theodore Laskaris. Alexios was then confined to a <a href="monastery">monastery</a> at <a href="%C4%B0znik">Nicaea</a>, where he died later in 1211.

By his marriage to <a href="Euphrosyne%20Doukaina%20Kamatera">Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera</a>, Alexios had three daughters:

Alexios V Doukas

Alexios V Doukas or Alexius V Ducas (;  December 1204) was the <a href="Byzantine%20emperor">Byzantine emperor</a> from 5 February to 12 April 1204 during the <a href="siege%20of%20Constantinople%20%281204%29">second and final siege</a> of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> by the participants of the <a href="Fourth%20Crusade">Fourth Crusade</a>. He was a member of the <a href="Doukas">Doukas</a> family, nicknamed Mourtzouphlos or Murtzuphlus (), either in reference to bushy, overhanging <a href="eyebrow">eyebrow</a>s or a sullen, gloomy character.

A Byzantine nobleman, his participation in the attempted overthrow of <a href="Alexios%20III%20Angelos">Alexios III Angelos</a> by <a href="John%20Komnenos%20the%20Fat">John Komnenos the Fat</a> in 1200 had led to his imprisonment until the restoration to the throne of <a href="Isaac%20II%20Angelos">Isaac II Angelos</a>. Isaac II, along with his son <a href="Alexios%20IV%20Angelos">Alexios IV Angelos</a>, were restored to the throne through the intervention of leaders of the Fourth Crusade in July 1203. Released, Murtzuphlus was allowed the court position of "<a href="protovestiarios">protovestiarios</a>". He had been married twice but was allegedly the lover of <a href="Eudokia%20Angelina">Eudokia Angelina</a>, a daughter of Emperor <a href="Alexios%20III%20Angelos">Alexios III Angelos</a>.

By the beginning of 1204, Isaac II and Alexios IV had inspired little confidence among the people of Constantinople in their efforts to defend the city from the Latins and Venetians, who were restless and rioted when the money and aid promised by Alexios IV was not forthcoming. Alexios Doukas emerged as a leader of the anti-Latin movement and personally led some skirmishes against the crusaders. When the populace rebelled in late January 1204, the two emperors barricaded themselves in the palace and entrusted Alexios Doukas with a mission to seek help from the crusaders. Instead, Alexios Doukas used his access to the palace to arrest the emperors. The young Alexios IV was strangled in prison, while his father Isaac died shortly afterwards, his death variously attributed to fright, sorrow, or foul play. Alexios V Doukas was crowned in early February 1204.

After his coronation, Alexios V began to strengthen the <a href="Walls%20of%20Constantinople">defenses</a> of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and ended negotiations with the Latins. It was too late, however, for the new Emperor to make much of a difference. An attempted surprise attack against the crusader camp failed despite the Emperor's personal leadership. During the ensuing fight, the defenders of Constantinople held out against the crusader counterattack of 9 April. The crusaders' second attack proved too strong to repel, and Alexios V fled towards <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> on the night of 12 April 1204, accompanied by Eudokia Angelina and her mother <a href="Euphrosyne%20Doukaina%20Kamatera">Euphrosyne Doukaina Kamatera</a>. Constantinople was under Latin control by the next day.

The refugees reached <a href="Mosynopolis">Mosynopolis</a>, the base of the deposed emperor Alexios III Angelos, where they were initially well received, with Alexios V marrying Eudokia Angelina. Later, however, Alexios III arranged for his new son-in-law to be ambushed and blinded, making him ineligible for the imperial throne. Abandoned by his supporters and enemies alike, Alexios V was captured near Mosynopolis by the advancing Latins under <a href="Thierry%20de%20Loos">Thierry de Loos</a> in November 1204. Brought back to Constantinople, Alexios V was condemned to death for treason against Alexios IV, and was thrown from the top of the <a href="Column%20of%20Theodosius">Column of Theodosius</a>. He was the last Byzantine Emperor to reign in Constantinople before the establishment of the <a href="Latin%20Empire">Latin Empire</a>, which controlled the city for the next 57 years, until it was recovered by the <a href="Empire%20of%20Nicaea">Nicaean Emperor</a> <a href="Michael%20VIII%20Palaiologos">Michael VIII Palaiologos</a>.

Alexei Petrovich, Tsarevich of Russia

Alexei Petrovich Romanov (28 February 1690- 7 July 1718) was a <a href="Russia">Russia</a>n <a href="Tsarevich">Tsarevich</a>. He was born in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>, the son of Tsar <a href="Peter%20the%20Great">Peter I</a> and his first wife, <a href="Eudoxia%20Lopukhina">Eudoxia Lopukhina</a>.

The young Alexei was brought up by his mother, who fostered an atmosphere of disdain towards <a href="Peter%20the%20Great">Peter the Great</a>, Alexei's father. Alexei's relations with his father suffered from the hatred between his father and his mother, as it was very difficult for him to feel affection for his mother's worst persecutor. From the ages of 6 to 9, Alexei was educated by his tutor Vyazemsky, but after the removal of his mother by Peter the Great to the <a href="Suzdal%20Kremlin%23History">Suzdal Intercession Convent</a>, Alexei was confined to the care of educated foreigners, who taught him history, geography, mathematics and French.

In 1703, Alexei was ordered to follow the army to the field as a private in a <a href="artillery">bombardier</a> regiment. In 1704, he was present at the capture of <a href="Narva">Narva</a>. At this period, the preceptors of the Tsarevich had the highest opinion of his ability. Alexei had strong leanings towards <a href="archaeology">archaeology</a> and <a href="ecclesiology">ecclesiology</a>. However, Peter had wished his son and heir to dedicate himself to the service of new <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, and demanded from him unceasing labour in order to maintain Russia's new wealth and power. Painful relations between father and son, quite apart from the prior personal antipathies, were therefore inevitable. It was an additional misfortune for Alexei that his father should have been too busy to attend to him just as he was growing up from boyhood to manhood. He was left in the hands of <a href="reactionary">reactionary</a> <a href="boyars">boyars</a> and priests, who encouraged him to hate his father and wish for the death of the Tsar.
In 1708 Peter sent Alexei to <a href="Smolensk">Smolensk</a> to collect <a href="food">provender</a> and recruits, and after that to <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> to fortify it against <a href="Charles%20XII%20of%20Sweden">Charles XII of Sweden</a>. At the end of 1709, Alexei went to <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> for one year. There, he finished lessons in French, German, mathematics and fortification. After his education, Alexei married, <a href="Charlotte%20of%20Brunswick-Wolfenb%C3%BCttel">Princess Charlotte of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel</a>, whose family was connected by marriage to many of the great families of Europe (i.e., Charlotte's sister <a href="Elisabeth%20Christine%20of%20Brunswick-Wolfenb%C3%BCttel">Elizabeth</a> was married to <a href="Charles%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI</a>, ruler of the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg Monarchy</a>). He met with Princess Charlotte, both were pleased with each other and the marriage went forward. In theory, Alexei could have refused the marriage, and he had been encouraged by his father to at least meet his intended. "Why haven't you written to tell me what you thought about her?" wrote Peter (in a tone that can only be guessed) in a letter dated 13 August 1710.

The marriage contract was signed in September. The wedding was celebrated at <a href="Torgau">Torgau</a>, Germany, on 14 October 1711. One of the terms of the marriage contract agreed to by Alexei was that while any forthcoming children were to be raised in the Orthodox faith, Charlotte herself was allowed to retain her Protestant faith, an agreement opposed by Alexei's followers.

As for the marriage itself, the first 6 months went well but quickly became a failure within 6 months. Alexis was drunk constantly and Alexei pronounced his bride "pock-marked" and "too thin". He insisted on separate apartments and ignored her in public.

Three weeks later, the bridegroom was hurried away by his father to <a href="Toru%C5%84">Toruń</a> to superintend the provisioning of the Russian troops in Poland. For the next twelve months Alexei was kept constantly on the move. His wife joined him at Toruń in December, but in April 1712 a peremptory <a href="ukase">ukase</a> ordered him off to the army in <a href="Pomerania">Pomerania</a>, and in the autumn of the same year he was forced to accompany his father on a tour of inspection through <a href="Finland">Finland</a>. 

He had two children with Charlotte:


Peter Alexeyevich would succeed as the <a href="Emperor">Emperor</a> <a href="Peter%20II%20of%20Russia">Peter II</a> in 1727. With his death in 1730, the direct male-line of the House of Romanov became extinct.

After the birth of Natalia in 1714, Alexei brought his long-time Finnish serf <a href="Mistress%20%28lover%29">mistress</a> <a href="Yefrosinya%20Fedorov">Afrosinia</a> to live in the palace. Some historians speculate that it was his conservative powerbase's disapproval of his foreign, non-Orthodox bride, more so than her appearance, that caused Alexei to spurn Charlotte. Another influence was <a href="Alexander%20Kikin">Alexander Kikin</a>, a high-placed official who had fallen out with the Tsar and had been deprived of his estates.

Immediately on his return from Finland, Alexei was dispatched by his father to <a href="Staraya%20Russa">Staraya Russa</a> and <a href="Lake%20Ladoga">Lake Ladoga</a> to see to the building of new ships. This was the last commission entrusted to him, since Peter had not been satisfied with his son's performance and his lack of enthusiasm. Nevertheless, Peter made one last effort to "reclaim" his son. On 11 October 1715, Charlotte died, after giving birth to a son, the grand-duke Peter, the future Emperor <a href="Peter%20II%20of%20Russia">Peter II</a>. On the day of the funeral, Peter sent Alexei a stern letter, urging him to take interest in the affairs of the state. Peter threatened to cut him off if he did not acquiesce in his father's plans. Alexei wrote a pitiful reply to his father, offering to renounce the succession in favour of his infant son Peter. Peter would agree but on the condition that Alexei remove himself as a dynastic threat and become a monk.

While Alexei was pondering his options, on 26 August 1716 Peter wrote to Alexei from abroad, urging him, if he desired to remain <a href="tsarevich">tsarevich</a>, to join him and the army without delay. Rather than face this ordeal, Alexei fled to <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> and placed himself under the protection of his brother-in-law, the emperor <a href="Charles%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles VI</a>, who sent him for safety first to the <a href="Tirol%20Castle">Tirol</a>ean fortress of Ehrenberg (near <a href="Reutte">Reutte</a>), and finally to the castle of <a href="Sant%27Elmo">Sant'Elmo</a> at <a href="Naples">Naples</a>. He was accompanied throughout his journey by Afrosinia. That the emperor sincerely sympathized with Alexei, and suspected Peter of harbouring murderous designs against his son, is plain from his confidential letter to <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I of Great Britain</a>, whom he consulted on this delicate affair. Peter felt insulted: the flight of the tsarevich to a foreign potentate was a reproach and a scandal, and he had to be recovered and brought back to Russia at all costs. This difficult task was accomplished by Count <a href="Peter%20Tolstoi">Peter Tolstoi</a>, the most subtle and unscrupulous of Peter's servants.

Alexei would only consent to return on his father solemnly swearing, that if he came back he should not be punished in the least, but cherished as a son and allowed to live quietly on his estates and marry Afrosinia.

On 31 January 1718, the tsarevich reached Moscow. Peter had already determined to institute a searching inquisition in order to get at the bottom of the mystery of the flight. On 18 February a "confession" was extorted from Alexei which implicated most of his friends, and he then publicly renounced the succession to the throne in favour of the baby grand-duke Peter Petrovich. A brutal reign of terror ensued, in the course of which the ex-tsaritsa Eudoxia was dragged from her monastery and publicly tried for alleged <a href="adultery">adultery</a>, while all who had in any way befriended Alexei were <a href="impalement">impaled</a> or <a href="breaking%20wheel">broken on the wheel</a> while having their flesh torn with red-hot pincers or their bare backs or bare feet slowly roasted over burning coals, and were otherwise lingeringly done to death. All this was done to terrorize the reactionaries and isolate the tsarevich.

In April 1718 fresh confessions were extorted from, and in regard to, Alexei. This included the words of Afrosinia, who had turned state's evidence. "I shall bring back the old people..." Alexei is reported to have told her,
"...and choose myself new ones according to my will;
when I become sovereign I shall live in Moscow and leave Saint Petersburg simply as any other town; I won't launch any ships; I shall maintain troops only for defense, and won't make war on anyone; I shall be content with the old domains. In winter I shall live in Moscow, and in summer in <a href="Yaroslavl">Iaroslavl</a>."

Despite this and other hearsay evidence, there were no facts to go upon. The worst that could be brought against him was that he had wished his father's death. In the eyes of Peter, his son was now a self-convicted and most dangerous traitor, whose life was forfeit. But there was no getting over the fact that his father had sworn to pardon him and let him live in peace if he returned to Russia. The whole matter was solemnly submitted to a grand council of <a href="prelate">prelate</a>s, <a href="Governing%20Senate">senator</a>s, <a href="Minister%20%28government%29">ministers</a> and other <a href="Dignitary">dignitaries</a> on 13 June 1718. The <a href="clergy">clergy</a>, for their part, declared the Tsarevich Alexei,

"...had placed his Confidence in those who loved the ancient Customs, and that he had become acquainted with them by the Discourses they held, wherein they had constantly praised the ancient Manners, and spoke with Distaste of the Novelties his Father had introduced."

Declaring this to be a civil rather than an ecclesiastical matter, the clergy left the matter to the tsar's own decision.

At noon on 24 June, the temporal dignitaries—the 126 members of both the Senate and magistrates that comprised the court—declared Alexei guilty and sentenced him to death. But the examination by torture continued, so desperate was Peter to uncover any possible collusion.

On 19 June, the weak and ailing tsarevich received twenty-five strokes with the <a href="knout">knout</a>, and then, on the 24th, he was subject to fifteen more. On 26 June, Alexei died in the <a href="Peter%20and%20Paul%20fortress">Peter and Paul fortress</a> in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, two days after the senate had condemned him to death for conspiring rebellion against his father, and for hoping for the cooperation of the common people and the armed intervention of his brother-in-law, the emperor.

Jackson briefly served as Florida's first territorial governor before winning election as a U.S. Senator from Tennessee. Jackson ran for president in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201824">1824</a>, winning a plurality of the popular and electoral vote. As no candidate won an electoral majority, the House of Representatives elected <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> in a <a href="contingent%20election">contingent election</a>. In reaction to the alleged "<a href="corrupt%20bargain">corrupt bargain</a>" between Adams and <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> and the ambitious agenda of President Adams, Jackson's supporters founded the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>.

Jackson ran again in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201828">1828</a>, defeating Adams in a landslide. Jackson faced the threat of secession by <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> over the "<a href="Tariff%20of%20Abominations">Tariff of Abominations</a>." The <a href="Nullification%20Crisis">crisis</a> was defused when the tariff was <a href="Tariff%20of%201833">amended</a>, and Jackson <a href="Force%20Bill">threatened</a> the use of military force if South Carolina attempted to secede. Congress, led by Clay, tried to reauthorize the <a href="Second%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Second Bank of the United States</a>; Jackson regarded the Bank as a corrupt institution and vetoed the renewal of its charter. After a lengthy <a href="Bank%20War">struggle</a>, Jackson and his allies thoroughly dismantled the Bank. In 1835, Jackson became the only president to completely pay off the national debt, fulfilling a longtime goal. His presidency marked the beginning of the ascendancy of the "<a href="spoils%20system">spoils system</a>" in American politics. In 1830, Jackson signed the <a href="Indian%20Removal%20Act">Indian Removal Act</a>, which <a href="Trail%20of%20Tears">relocated</a> most members of the <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> tribes in the South to <a href="Indian%20Territory">Indian Territory</a>. The relocation process dispossessed the Indians and resulted in widespread death and sickness. In foreign affairs, Jackson's administration concluded a "most favored nation" treaty with Great Britain, settled claims of damages against France from the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, and recognized the <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a>. He vehemently opposed the rising trend of <a href="abolitionism">abolitionism</a>.

In his retirement, Jackson remained active in Democratic Party politics, supporting the presidencies of <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a> and <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a>. Though fearful of its effects on the slavery debate, Jackson advocated the <a href="Texas%20annexation">annexation of Texas</a>, which was accomplished shortly before his death. Jackson was widely revered in the United States as an advocate for the causes of democracy and the common man, but his reputation has declined since the <a href="African-American%20Civil%20Rights%20Movement%20%281954%E2%80%931968%29">civil rights movement</a>, largely due to his role in Indian removal and support for <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a>. Surveys of historians and scholars have <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">ranked</a> Jackson between 6th and 18th most successful among United States presidents.

Andrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767, in the <a href="Waxhaws">Waxhaws</a> region of the Carolinas. His parents were <a href="Scotch-Irish%20American">Scots-Irish</a> colonists Andrew and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson, <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterians</a> who had emigrated from present day Northern <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> two years earlier. Jackson's father was born in <a href="Carrickfergus">Carrickfergus</a>, <a href="County%20Antrim">County Antrim</a>, in current-day <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, around 1738. Jackson's parents lived in the village of <a href="Boneybefore">Boneybefore</a>, also in County Antrim. His paternal family line originated in <a href="Eske">Killingswold Grove</a>, <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, <a href="England">England</a>.

When they immigrated to North America in 1765, Jackson's parents probably landed in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. Most likely they traveled overland through the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> to the Scots-Irish community in the <a href="Waxhaws">Waxhaws</a> region, straddling the border between <a href="North%20Carolina">North</a> and <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>. They brought two children from Ireland, Hugh (born 1763) and Robert (born 1764). Jackson's father died in an accident in February 1767 at the age of 29, three weeks before his son Andrew was born. Jackson, his mother, and his brothers lived with Jackson's aunt and uncle in the Waxhaws region, and Jackson received schooling from two nearby priests.

Jackson's exact birthplace is unclear because he was born about the time his mother was making a difficult trip home from burying Jackson's father. The area was so remote that the border between North and South Carolina had not been officially surveyed. In 1824 Jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born at an uncle's plantation in <a href="Lancaster%20County%2C%20South%20Carolina">Lancaster County, South Carolina</a>. Jackson may have claimed to be a South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the <a href="Tariff%20of%201824">Tariff of 1824</a>, which he opposed. In the mid-1850s, second-hand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a different uncle's home in North Carolina.

During the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a>, Jackson's eldest brother, Hugh, died from heat exhaustion after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stono%20Ferry">Battle of Stono Ferry</a> on June 20, 1779. Anti-British sentiment intensified following the brutal <a href="Battle%20of%20Waxhaws">Waxhaws Massacre</a> on May 29, 1780. Jackson's mother encouraged him and his elder brother Robert to attend the local militia drills. Soon, they began to help the militia as couriers. They served under Colonel <a href="William%20Richardson%20Davie">William Richardson Davie</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hanging%20Rock">Battle of Hanging Rock</a> on August 6. Andrew and Robert were eventually captured by the British in 1781 while staying at the home of the Crawford family. When Andrew refused to clean the boots of a British officer, the officer slashed at the youth with a sword, leaving him with scars on his left hand and head, as well as an intense hatred for the British. Robert also refused to do as commanded and was struck with the sword. The two brothers were held as prisoners, contracted <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, and nearly starved to death in captivity.

After a time, their mother Elizabeth secured the brothers' release. She then began to walk both boys back to their home in the Waxhaws. Robert Jackson died on the way a few days later on April 27, 1781. After nursing Andrew back to health, Elizabeth volunteered to nurse <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> on board two ships in the <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a> harbor, where there had been an outbreak of <a href="cholera">cholera</a>. In November she died from the disease and was buried in an unmarked grave. Andrew became an orphan at age 14. He blamed the British personally for the loss of his brothers and mother.

After the Revolutionary War, Jackson received a sporadic education in a local Waxhaw school. In 1781 he worked for a time in a saddle-maker's shop. On bad terms with much of his extended family, he boarded with several different people while teaching school or working for the saddle-maker. In 1784, he left the Waxhaws region for <a href="Salisbury%2C%20North%20Carolina">Salisbury, North Carolina</a>, where he studied law under attorney <a href="Spruce%20Macay">Spruce Macay</a>. With the help of various lawyers, he was able to learn enough to qualify for the bar. In September 1787, Jackson was admitted to the North Carolina bar. Shortly thereafter, a friend helped Jackson get appointed to a vacant prosecutor position in the <a href="Washington%20District%2C%20North%20Carolina">Western District</a> of North Carolina, which would later become the state of Tennessee. During his travel west, Jackson bought his first slave and in 1788, having been offended by fellow lawyer Waightstill Avery, fought his first duel. The duel ended with both men firing into the air, having made a secret agreement to do so before the engagement.

Jackson moved to the frontier town of <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a> in 1788, where he lived as a boarder with Rachel Stockly Donelson, the widow of <a href="John%20Donelson">John Donelson</a>. Here Jackson became acquainted with their daughter, <a href="Rachel%20Jackson">Rachel Donelson Robards</a>. At the time, the younger Rachel was in an unhappy marriage with Captain Lewis Robards; he was subject to fits of jealous rage. The two were separated in 1790. According to Jackson, he married Rachel after hearing that Robards had obtained a divorce. However, the divorce had never been completed, making Rachel's marriage to Jackson bigamous and therefore invalid. After the divorce was officially completed, Rachel and Jackson remarried in 1794. To complicate matters further, evidence shows that Rachel had been living with Jackson and referred to herself as Mrs. Jackson before the petition for divorce was ever made. It was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved unofficially, as long as they were recognized by the community.

In 1794, Jackson formed a business with fellow lawyer and planter <a href="John%20Overton%20%28judge%29">John Overton</a>, overtly buying and selling land which had been reserved by treaty for the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> and <a href="Chickasaw">Chickasaw</a>. Theirs was a frank avowal; they, like many of their contemporaries, would deal with lands within Indian territory. Most of the transactions involved grants made under the 'land grab' act of 1783 that briefly opened to claim by North Carolinians all of the Indian lands in that state's transmontane west. He was one of the three original investors who founded <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, in 1819.

After moving to Nashville, Jackson became a protege of <a href="William%20Blount">William Blount</a>, a friend of the Donelsons and one of the most powerful men in the state. Jackson became attorney general in 1791, and he won election as a delegate to the Tennessee <a href="constitutional%20convention%20%28political%20meeting%29">constitutional convention</a> in 1796. When Tennessee achieved statehood that year, he was elected its only <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. Representative</a>. The following year, the state legislature elected him as <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senator</a>. He resigned within a year. While in Philadelphia, then the nation's capital, Jackson aligned himself with the <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party">Democratic-Republican Party</a>, and he strongly opposed the <a href="Jay%20Treaty">Jay Treaty</a>. In 1798, with strong support from western Tennessee, he was elected to serve as a judge of the <a href="Tennessee%20Supreme%20Court">Tennessee Supreme Court</a>, at an annual salary of $600. Jackson's service as a judge is generally viewed as a success and earned him a reputation for honesty and good decision making. Jackson resigned the judgeship in 1804 and returned full-time to his business interests. His official reason for resigning was ill health. He had been suffering financially from poor land ventures, and so it is also possible that he wanted to return full-time to his business interests.

After arriving in Tennessee, Jackson won the appointment of judge advocate of the Tennessee militia. While serving on the Tennessee Supreme Court, he was appointed in 1801 as a <a href="colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a> in the Tennessee <a href="militia%20%28United%20States%29">militia</a>. In 1802 he declared his candidacy for major general, or commander, of the Tennessee militia, a position voted on by the officers. Jackson, with strong support from western Tennessee, tied with <a href="John%20Sevier">John Sevier</a> with seventeen votes. Sevier was a popular Revolutionary War veteran and former governor, the recognized leader of politics in eastern Tennessee. On February 5, Governor <a href="Archibald%20Roane">Archibald Roane</a> broke the tie in Jackson's favor. Jackson had also presented Roane with evidence against Sevier of land fraud. Subsequently, in 1803, when Sevier announced his intention to regain the governorship, Roane released the evidence. Sevier responded with hostility to Jackson, and the two nearly fought a duel over the matter. Despite the charges leveled against Sevier, he defeated Roane, and continued to serve as governor until 1809. Sevier took revenge on Jackson by dividing the militia into east and west districts, and giving Jackson control of only the west.

In addition to his legal and political career, Jackson prospered as <a href="Planter%20%28American%20South%29">planter</a>, <a href="slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slave owner</a>, and merchant. He built a home and the first general store in <a href="Gallatin%2C%20Tennessee">Gallatin, Tennessee</a>, in 1803. The next year, he acquired the <a href="The%20Hermitage%20%28Nashville%2C%20Tennessee%29">Hermitage</a>, a plantation in <a href="Davidson%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Davidson County</a>, near <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a>. He later added to the plantation, which eventually totaled . The primary crop was <a href="cotton">cotton</a>, grown by slaves—Jackson began with nine, owned as many as 44 by 1820, and later up to 150, making him among the planter elite. Jackson also co-owned with his son Andrew Jackson Jr. the Halcyon plantation in <a href="Coahoma%20County%2C%20Mississippi">Coahoma County, Mississippi</a>, which housed 51 slaves at the time of his death. Throughout his lifetime Jackson may have owned as many as 300 slaves.

Men, women, and child slaves were owned by Jackson on three sections of the Hermitage plantation. Slaves lived in extended family units of between five and ten persons and were quartered in cabins made either of brick or logs. The size and quality of the Hermitage slave quarters exceeded the standards of his times. To help slaves acquire food, Jackson supplied them with guns, knives, and fishing equipment. At times he paid his slaves with monies and coins to trade in local markets. The Hermitage plantation was a profit-making enterprise. Jackson permitted slaves to be whipped to increase productivity or if he believed his slaves' offenses were severe enough. At various times he posted advertisements for fugitive slaves who had escaped from his plantation. For the standards of his times, Jackson was considered a humane slave owner who furnished his slaves food and housing, and he did not prohibit his female slaves from having children.

The controversy surrounding his marriage to Rachel remained a sore point for Jackson, who deeply resented attacks on his wife's honor. By May 1806, <a href="Charles%20Dickinson%20%28historical%20figure%29">Charles Dickinson</a>, who, like Jackson, raced horses, had published an attack on Jackson in the local newspaper, and it resulted in a written challenge from Jackson to a <a href="duel">duel</a>. Since Dickinson was considered an expert shot, Jackson determined it would be best to let Dickinson turn and fire first, hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness; Jackson would wait and take careful aim at Dickinson. Dickinson did fire first, hitting Jackson in the chest. The bullet that struck Jackson was so close to his heart that it could not be removed. Under the rules of dueling, Dickinson had to remain still as Jackson took aim and shot and killed him. Jackson's behavior in the duel outraged men in Tennessee, who called it a brutal, cold-blooded killing and saddled Jackson with a reputation as a violent, vengeful man. He became a social outcast.

After the Sevier affair and the duel, Jackson was looking for a way to salvage his reputation. He chose to align himself with former Vice President <a href="Aaron%20Burr">Aaron Burr</a>, who after leaving office in 1805 went on a tour of the western United States. During that time he stayed for several days at the Hermitage. Burr's true intentions are not known with certainty. He seems to have been <a href="Burr%20conspiracy">planning</a> a military operation to conquer <a href="Spanish%20Florida">Spanish Florida</a> and drive the Spanish from <a href="Texas">Texas</a>. To many westerners like Jackson, the promise seemed enticing. Western American settlers had long held bitter feelings towards the Spanish due to territorial disputes and the persistent failure of the Spanish to keep Indians living on their lands from raiding American settlements. On October 4, 1806, Jackson addressed the Tennessee militia, declaring that the men should be "at a moment's warning ready to march." On the same day, he wrote to <a href="James%20Winchester">James Winchester</a>, proclaiming that the United States "can conquer not only the Floridas, but all Spanish North America." He continued:
Jackson agreed to provide boats and other provisions for the expedition. However, on November 10, he learned from a military captain that Burr's plans apparently included seizure of New Orleans, then part of the <a href="Louisiana%20Territory">Louisiana Territory</a> of the United States, and incorporating it, along with lands won from the Spanish, into a new empire. He was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of Brigadier General <a href="James%20Wilkinson">James Wilkinson</a>, whom he deeply disliked, in the plan. Jackson acted cautiously at first, but wrote letters to public officials, including President <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, vaguely warning them about the scheme. In December, Jefferson, a political opponent of Burr, issued a proclamation declaring that a treasonous plot was underway in the West and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators. Jackson, safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail, organized the militia. Burr was soon captured, and the men were sent home. Jackson traveled to <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>, to testify on Burr's behalf in trial. The defense team decided against placing him on the witness stand, fearing his remarks were too provocative. Burr was acquitted of treason, despite Jefferson's efforts to have him convicted. Jackson endorsed <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a> for President in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201808">1808</a> against <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a>. The latter was part of the Jeffersonian wing of the Democratic-Republican Party.

Leading up to 1812, the United States found itself increasingly drawn into international conflict. Formal hostilities with Spain or France never materialized, but tensions with Britain increased for a number of <a href="Origins%20of%20the%20War%20of%201812">reasons</a>. Among these was the <a href="Manifest%20destiny">desire</a> of <a href="war%20hawk">many</a> Americans for more land, particularly <a href="Canada%20under%20British%20rule">British Canada</a> and Florida, the latter still controlled by Spain, Britain's European ally. On June 18, 1812, Congress officially declared war on the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a>, beginning the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. Jackson responded enthusiastically, sending a letter to Washington offering 2,500 volunteers. However, the men were not called up for many months. Biographer <a href="Robert%20V.%20Remini">Robert V. Remini</a> claims that Jackson saw the apparent slight as payback by the Madison administration for his support of Burr and Monroe. Meanwhile, the United States military repeatedly suffered devastating defeats on the battlefield.

On January 10, 1813, Jackson led an army of 2,071 volunteers to <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> to defend the region against British and Native American attacks. He was to serve under General Wilkinson, who commanded Federal forces in New Orleans. Lacking adequate provisions, Wilkinson ordered Jackson to halt in Natchez, now part of the <a href="Mississippi%20Territory">Mississippi Territory</a>, and await further orders. Jackson reluctantly obeyed. The newly appointed <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a>, <a href="John%20Armstrong%20Jr.">John Armstrong Jr.</a>, sent a letter to Jackson dated February 6 ordering him dismiss his forces and to turn over his supplies to Wilkinson. In reply to Armstrong on March 15, Jackson defended the character and readiness of his men, and promised to turn over his supplies. However, he also promised to, instead of dismissing the troops without provisions in Natchez, march them back to Nashville. The march was filled with agony. Many of the men had fallen ill. Jackson and his officers turned over their horses to the sick. He paid for provisions for the men out of his own pocket. The soldiers began referring to their commander as "Hickory" because of his toughness, and Jackson became known as "Old Hickory." The army arrived in Nashville within about a month. Jackson's actions earned him the widespread respect and praise of the people of Tennessee. On June 14, Jackson served as a second in a duel on behalf of his junior officer <a href="William%20Carroll%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">William Carroll</a> against Jesse Benton. In September, Jackson and his top cavalry officer, Brigadier General <a href="John%20Coffee">John Coffee</a>, were involved in a street brawl with Jesse and his brother, <a href="Thomas%20Hart%20Benton%20%28politician%29">Thomas</a>. Jackson was severely wounded by Jesse with a gunshot to the shoulder.

On August 30, 1813, a group of <a href="Muscogee">Muscogee</a> (also known as Creek Indians) called the <a href="Red%20Sticks">Red Sticks</a>, so named for the color of their war paint, perpetrated the <a href="Fort%20Mims%20massacre">Fort Mims massacre</a>. The Red Sticks, led by chiefs <a href="William%20Weatherford">Red Eagle</a> and <a href="Peter%20McQueen">Peter McQueen</a>, had broken away from the rest of the Creek Confederacy, which wanted peace with the United States. They were allied with <a href="Tecumseh">Tecumseh</a>, a <a href="Shawnee">Shawnee</a> chief who had launched <a href="Tecumseh%27s%20War">Tecumseh's War</a> against the United States, and who was fighting alongside the British. During the massacre, hundreds of white American settlers and non-Red Stick Creeks were slaughtered. The resulting conflict became known as the <a href="Creek%20War">Creek War</a>.

Jackson, with 2,500 men, was ordered to crush the hostile Indians. On October 10, he set out on the expedition, his arm still in a sling. Jackson established <a href="Fort%20Strother">Fort Strother</a> as a supply base. On November 3, Coffee defeated a band of Red Sticks at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tallushatchee">Battle of Tallushatchee</a>. Coming to the relief of friendly Creeks besieged by Red Sticks, Jackson won another decisive victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Talladega">Battle of Talladega</a>. In the winter, Jackson, encamped at Fort Strother, faced a severe shortage of troops due to the expiration of enlistments and chronic desertions. He sent Coffee with the cavalry (which abandoned him) back to Tennessee to secure more enlistments. Jackson decided to combine his force with that of the Georgia militia, and marched to meet the Georgia troops. From January 22–24, 1814, while on their way, the Tennessee militia and allied Muscogee were attacked by the Red Sticks at the <a href="Battles%20of%20Emuckfaw%20and%20Enotachopo%20Creek">Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek</a>. Jackson's troops repelled the attackers, but outnumbered, were forced to withdraw to Fort Strother. Jackson, now with over 2,000 troops, marched most of his army south to confront the Red Sticks at a fortress they had constructed at a bend in the <a href="Tallapoosa%20River">Tallapoosa River</a>. On March 27, enjoying an advantage of more than 2 to 1, he engaged them at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Horseshoe%20Bend%20%281814%29">Battle of Horseshoe Bend</a>. An initial artillery barrage did little damage to the well-constructed fort. However, a subsequent Infantry charge, in addition to an assault by Coffee's cavalry and diversions caused by the friendly Creeks, overwhelmed the Red Sticks.

The campaign ended three weeks later with Red Eagle's surrender, although some Red Sticks such as McQueen fled to <a href="East%20Florida">East Florida</a>. On June 8, Jackson accepted a commission as <a href="brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>, and 10 days later became a <a href="major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">major general</a>, in command of the Seventh Military Division. Subsequently, Jackson, with Madison's approval, imposed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Jackson">Treaty of Fort Jackson</a>. The treaty required the Muscogee, including those who had not joined the Red Sticks, to surrender 23 million acres of land to the United States. Though in ill-health from <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>, Jackson turned his attention to defeating Spanish and British forces. Jackson accused the Spanish of arming the Red Sticks and of violating the terms of their neutrality by allowing British soldiers into the Floridas. The first charge was true, while the second ignored the fact that it was Jackson's threats to invade Florida which had caused them to seek British protection. In the November 7 <a href="Battle%20of%20Pensacola%20%281814%29">Battle of Pensacola</a>, Jackson defeated British and Spanish forces in a short skirmish. The Spanish surrendered and the British fled. Weeks later, he learned that the British were planning an attack on <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, which sat on the mouth of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> and held immense strategic and commercial value. Jackson abandoned Pensacola to the Spanish, placed a force in <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a> to guard against a possible invasion there, and rushed the rest of his force west to defend the city.

The Creeks coined their own name for Jackson, "Jacksa Chula Harjo" or "Jackson, old and fierce".

After arriving in New Orleans on December 1, Jackson instituted <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a> in the city, as he worried about the loyalty of the city's <a href="Louisiana%20Creole%20people">Creole</a> and Spanish inhabitants. At the same time, he formed an alliance with <a href="Jean%20Lafitte">Jean Lafitte</a>'s smugglers, and formed military units consisting of African-Americans and Muscogees, in addition to recruiting volunteers in the city. Jackson received some criticism for paying white and non-white volunteers the same salary. These forces, along with U.S. Army regulars and volunteers from surrounding states, joined with Jackson's force in defending New Orleans. The approaching British force, led by Admiral <a href="Alexander%20Cochrane">Alexander Cochrane</a> and later General <a href="Edward%20Pakenham">Edward Pakenham</a>, consisted of over 10,000 soldiers, many of whom had served in the Napoleonic Wars. Jackson only had about 5,000 men.

The British arrived on the east bank of the Mississippi River on the morning of December 23. That evening Jackson attacked the British and temporarily drove them back. On January 8, 1815, the British launched a major frontal assault against Jackson's defenses. Despite some success in attacking the right flank, the overall attack ended in disaster. For the battle on January 8, Jackson admitted to only 71 total casualties. Of these, 13 men were killed, 39 wounded, and 19 missing or captured. The British, however, admitted 2,037 casualties. Of these, 291 men were killed (including Pakenham), 1,262 wounded, and 484 missing or captured. After the battle, the British retreated from the area, and open hostilities ended shortly thereafter when word spread that the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Ghent">Treaty of Ghent</a> had been signed in Europe that December. Coming in the waning days of the war, Jackson's victory made him a national hero, as the country celebrated the end of what many called the "Second American Revolution" against the British. By a Congressional resolution on February 27, 1815, Jackson was given the <a href="Thanks%20of%20Congress">Thanks of Congress</a> and awarded a <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a>.

<a href="Alexis%20de%20Tocqueville">Alexis de Tocqueville</a> ("underwhelmed" by Jackson according to a 2001 commentator) later wrote in "<a href="Democracy%20in%20America">Democracy in America</a>" that Jackson "was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans."

Jackson, still not knowing for certain of the treaty's signing, refused to lift martial law in the city. He ordered the arrest of U. S. District Court Judge <a href="Dominic%20Augustin%20Hall">Dominic A. Hall</a> in March 1815, after the judge signed a writ of "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>" on behalf of a Louisiana legislator whom Jackson had arrested. State senator Louis Louaillier had written an anonymous piece in the New Orleans newspaper, challenging Jackson's refusal to release the militia after the British ceded the field of battle. Jackson did not relent his campaign of suppressing dissent until after ordering the arrest of a Louisiana legislator, a federal judge, and a lawyer, and after the intervention of State Judge <a href="Joshua%20Lewis%20%28judge%29">Joshua Lewis</a>. Lewis was simultaneously serving under Jackson in the militia, and also had signed a writ of "habeas corpus" against Jackson, his commanding officer, seeking Judge Hall's release.

Civilian authorities in New Orleans had reason to fear Jackson—he summarily ordered the execution of six members of the militia. Their deaths were not revealed until the <a href="Coffin%20Handbills">Coffin Handbills</a> were circulated during his 1828 presidential campaign.

Following the war, Jackson remained in command of Army forces on the southern border of the U.S. He conducted official business from The Hermitage. He signed treaties with the Cherokee and Chickasaw which gained for the United States large parts of Tennessee and Kentucky. The treaty with the Chickasaw, finally agreed to later in the year, is commonly known as the <a href="Jackson%20Purchase%20%28U.S.%20historical%20region%29">Jackson Purchase</a>.

Several Native American tribes, which became known as the <a href="Seminole">Seminole</a>, straddled the border between the U.S. and Florida. The Seminole, in alliance with escaped slaves, frequently raided Georgia settlements before retreating back into Florida. These skirmishes continually escalated, and the conflict is now known as the <a href="First%20Seminole%20War">First Seminole War</a>. In 1816, Jackson led a detachment into Florida which <a href="Battle%20of%20Negro%20Fort">destroyed</a> the <a href="Fort%20Gadsden">Negro Fort</a>, a community of escaped slaves and their descendants. Jackson was ordered by President <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a> in December 1817 to lead a campaign in <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> against the Seminole and Creek Indians. Jackson was also charged with preventing <a href="Spanish%20Florida">Spanish Florida</a> from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves, after Spain promised freedom to fugitive slaves. Critics later alleged that Jackson exceeded orders in his Florida actions. His orders from President Monroe were to "terminate the conflict". Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida from Spain once and for all. Before departing, Jackson wrote to Monroe, "Let it be signified to me through any channel ... that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished."
Jackson invaded Florida on March 15, 1818, capturing Pensacola. He crushed Seminole and Spanish resistance in the region and captured two British agents, <a href="Arbuthnot%20and%20Ambrister%20incident">Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot</a>. After a brief trial, Jackson executed both British agents, causing a diplomatic incident with the British. Jackson's actions polarized Monroe's cabinet, some of whom argued that Jackson had gone against Monroe's orders and violated the Constitution, since the United States had not <a href="Declaration%20of%20war%20by%20the%20United%20States">declared war</a> upon Spain. Yet Jackson was defended by <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a>. Adams thought that Jackson's conquest of Florida would force Spain to finally sell the province, and Spain did indeed sell Florida to the United States in the <a href="Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs%20Treaty">Adams–Onís Treaty</a> of 1819. A congressional investigation exonerated Jackson, but Jackson was deeply angered by the criticism he received, particularly from Speaker of the House <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>. After the ratification of the Adams–Onís Treaty in 1821, Jackson briefly served as the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Florida">Governor of Florida</a> before returning to Tennessee.

After returning to Tennessee, Jackson turned down an offer to run for governor of his home state, but accepted <a href="John%20Overton%20%28judge%29">John Overton's</a> plan to have the legislature nominate him for president. Jackson had come to detest Secretary of the Treasury <a href="William%20H.%20Crawford">William H. Crawford</a>, who had been the most vocal critic of Jackson in Monroe's cabinet, and he hoped to prevent Tennessee's electoral votes from going to Crawford. Yet Jackson's nomination garnered a welcoming response even outside of Tennessee, as many Americans appreciated Jackson's attacks on banks. The <a href="Panic%20of%201819">Panic of 1819</a> had devastated the fortunes of many, and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular. With his growing political viability, Jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates, along with Crawford, Secretary of State Adams, Speaker of the House Henry Clay, and <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a>. During the <a href="Era%20of%20Good%20Feelings">Era of Good Feelings</a>, the Federalist Party had faded away, and all five presidential contenders were members of the Democratic-Republican Party. Jackson's campaign promoted him as a defender of the common people, as well as the one candidate who could rise above sectional divisions. On the major issues of the day, most prominently the <a href="Tariffs%20in%20United%20States%20history">tariff</a>, Jackson expressed centrist beliefs, and opponents accused him of obfuscating his positions. At the forefront of Jackson's campaign was combatting corruption, which had increased during the Monroe administration. Jackson vowed to restore honesty in government and to scale back its excesses.

In 1823, Jackson reluctantly allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of Tennessee's U.S. Senate seats, and the legislature narrowly elected him. His return, after 24 years, 11 months, 3 days out of office, marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history.

Democratic-Republican presidential nominees had historically been chosen by informal <a href="Congressional%20nominating%20caucus">Congressional nominating caucus</a>es, but this method had become unpopular. In 1824, most of the Democratic-Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus. Those who attended backed Crawford for President and <a href="Albert%20Gallatin">Albert Gallatin</a> for Vice President. A Pennsylvania convention nominated Jackson for President a month later, stating that the irregular caucus ignored the "voice of the people" and was a "vain hope that the American people might be thus deceived into a belief that he [Crawford] was the regular democratic candidate." Gallatin criticized Jackson as "an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory, but from incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for the office." After Jackson won the Pennsylvania nomination, Calhoun dropped out of the presidential race and successfully sought the vice presidency instead.

In the presidential election, Jackson won a plurality of the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">electoral vote</a>, taking several southern and western states as well as the mid-Atlantic states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. He was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base, as Adams dominated New England, Clay took three western states, and Crawford won Virginia and Georgia. Jackson won a plurality of the popular vote, taking 42 percent, although not all states held a popular vote for the presidency. He won 99 electoral votes, more than any other candidates, but still short of 131, which he needed for a true majority. With no candidate having won a majority of the electoral, the House of Representatives held a <a href="contingent%20election">contingent election</a> under the terms of the <a href="Twelfth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Twelfth Amendment</a>. The amendment specifies that only the top three electoral vote-winners are eligible to be elected by the House, so Clay was eliminated from contention. Jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election, as Crawford and Adams lacked Jackson's national appeal, and Crawford had suffered a debilitating stroke that made many doubt his physical fitness for the presidency. However, Clay saw Jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership. He threw his support behind Adams, who shared Clay's support for federally-funded <a href="internal%20improvement">internal improvement</a>s such as roads and canals. With Clay's backing, Adams won the contingent election on the first ballot. Furious supporters of Jackson accused Clay and Adams of having reached a "<a href="corrupt%20bargain">corrupt bargain</a>" after Adams appointed Clay as his Secretary of State. After the election,
Jackson resigned his Senate seat and returned to Tennessee.

Jackson was nominated for president by Tennessee legislature in October 1825, more than three years before the 1828 election. It was the earliest such nomination in presidential history, and it attested to the fact that Jackson's supporters began the 1828 campaign almost as soon as the 1824 campaign ended. Adams's presidency floundered, as his ambitious agenda faced defeat in a new era of mass politics. Critics led by Jackson attacked Adams's policies as a dangerous expansion of Federal power. Senator <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>, who had been a prominent supporter of Crawford in the 1824 election, emerged as one of the strongest opponents of Adams's policies, and he settled on Jackson as his preferred candidate in the 1828 election. Van Buren was joined by Vice President Calhoun, who also opposed much of Adams's agenda on states' rights grounds. Van Buren and other Jackson allies established numerous pro-Jackson newspapers and clubs around the country, while Jackson avoided campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his Hermitage plantation. In the election, Jackson won a commanding 56 percent of the popular vote and 68 percent of the electoral vote. The election marked the definitive end of the one-party Era of Good Feelings, as Jackson's supporters coalesced into the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> and Adams's followers became known as the <a href="National%20Republican%20Party">National Republicans</a>.

The campaign was very much a personal one. As was the custom at the time, neither candidate personally campaigned, but their political followers organized many campaign events. Both candidates were rhetorically attacked in the press. Jackson was strongly attacked as a <a href="slave%20trader">slave trader</a>, who bought and sold slaves and moved them about in defiance of higher standards of slaveholder behavior. A series of pamphlets known as the <a href="Coffin%20Handbills">Coffin Handbills</a> were published to attack Jackson. One revealed that he had ordered the execution of six soldiers at New Orleans. Another accused him of engaging in cannibalism by eating the bodies of American Indians killed in battle, while still another labeled his mother a "common prostitute" and stated that Jackson's father was a "mulatto man."

Rachel Jackson was also a frequent target of attacks, and was widely accused of bigamy, a reference to the controversial situation of her marriage with Jackson. Jackson's campaigners fired back by claiming that while serving as Minister to Russia, Adams had procured a young girl to serve as a prostitute for <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Russia">Emperor Alexander I</a>. They also stated that Adams had a billiard table in the White House and that he had charged the government for it.

Rachel had been under extreme stress during the election, and often struggled while Jackson was away. She began experiencing significant physical stress during the election season. Jackson described her symptoms as "excruciating pain in the left shoulder, arm, and breast." After struggling for three days, Rachel finally died of a heart attack on December 22, 1828 three weeks after her husband's victory in the election (which began on October 31 and ended on December 2) and 10 weeks before Jackson took office as President. A distraught Jackson had to be pulled from her so the undertaker could prepare the body. He felt that the accusations from Adams's supporters had hastened her death and never forgave him. Rachel was buried on Christmas Eve. "May God Almighty forgive her murderers," Jackson swore at her funeral. "I never can."

Jackson's name has been associated with <a href="Jacksonian%20democracy">Jacksonian democracy</a> or the shift and expansion of democracy with the passing of some political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in political parties. "The Age of Jackson" shaped the national agenda and American politics. Jackson's philosophy as President was similar to that of <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, advocating Republican values held by the Revolutionary War generation. Jackson took a moral tone, with the belief that agrarian sympathies, and a limited view of states rights and the federal government, would produce less corruption. He feared that monied and business interests would corrupt <a href="Republicanism%20in%20the%20United%20States">republican values</a>. When South Carolina opposed the tariff law, he took a strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession.

Jackson believed that the president's authority was derived from the people, and that public officials should obey their will or resign. Jackson chose <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a> of New York as Secretary of State, <a href="John%20Eaton%20%28politician%29">John Eaton</a> of Tennessee as Secretary of War, <a href="Samuel%20D.%20Ingham">Samuel D. Ingham</a> of Pennsylvania as Secretary of Treasury, <a href="John%20Branch">John Branch</a> of North Carolina as Secretary of Navy, <a href="John%20M.%20Berrien">John M. Berrien</a> of Georgia as Attorney General, and <a href="William%20T.%20Barry">William T. Barry</a> of Kentucky as Postmaster General. Jackson's first choice of Cabinet proved to be unsuccessful, full of bitter partisanship and gossip.

On March 4, 1829, Andrew Jackson became the first United States president-elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol. In his inaugural speech, Jackson promised to respect the sovereign powers of states and the constitutional limits of the presidency. He also promised to pursue "reform" by removing power from "unfaithful or incompetent hands." At the conclusion of the ceremony, Jackson invited the public to the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>, where his supporters held a raucous party. Thousands of spectators overwhelmed the White House staff, and minor damage was caused to fixtures and furnishings. Jackson's populism earned him the nickname "King Mob."

Jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his early years in office responding to what came to be known as the "Petticoat affair" or "Eaton affair". Washington gossip circulated among Jackson's Cabinet members and their wives, including Calhoun's wife <a href="Floride%20Calhoun">Floride Calhoun</a>, concerning Secretary of War Eaton and his wife <a href="Margaret%20O%27Neill%20Eaton">Peggy Eaton</a>. Salacious rumors held that Peggy, as a barmaid in her father's tavern, had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute. Controversy also ensued because Peggy had married soon after her previous husband's death, and it was alleged that she and her husband and engaged in an adulterous affair while her previous husband was still living. Petticoat politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members, led by Mrs. Calhoun, refused to socialize with the Eatons. Allowing a prostitute in the official family was of course unthinkable—but Jackson refused to believe the rumors, telling his Cabinet that "She is as chaste as a virgin!" Jackson believed that the dishonorable people were the rumormongers, who in essence questioned and dishonored Jackson himself by, in attempting to drive the Eatons out, daring to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet. Jackson was also reminded of the attacks that were made against his wife. These memories increased his dedication to defending Peggy Eaton.

Meanwhile, the Cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all American women was at stake. They believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that went with marriage. A woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable. Historian <a href="Daniel%20Walker%20Howe">Daniel Walker Howe</a> notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the woman's rights movement. Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, a widower, was already forming a coalition against Calhoun. He could now see his main chance to strike hard; he took the side of Jackson and Eaton.

In the spring of 1831, Jackson, at Van Buren's suggestion, demanded the resignations of all the cabinet member except Barry. Van Buren himself resigned to avoid the appearance of bias. In 1832, Jackson nominated Van Buren to be Minister to England. Calhoun blocked the nomination with a tie-breaking vote against it, claiming the defeated nomination would "...kill him, sir, kill dead. He will never kick, sir, never kick." Van Buren, however, fully recovered and played a leading role in the Jackson's unofficial <a href="Kitchen%20Cabinet">Kitchen Cabinet</a>.

Throughout his eight years in office, Jackson made about 70 treaties with Native American tribes both in the <a href="Old%20Southwest">South</a> and the <a href="Old%20Northwest">Northwest</a>. Jackson's presidency marked a new era in Indian-<a href="European%20American">Anglo</a> American relations initiating a policy of Indian removal. Jackson himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating process with various Indian tribes, though other times he left the negotiations to his subordinates. The southern tribes included the <a href="Choctaw">Choctaw</a>, <a href="Muscogee">Creek</a>, <a href="Chickasaw">Chickasaw</a>, <a href="Seminole">Seminole</a> and the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>. The northwest tribes include the <a href="Chippewa">Chippewa</a>, <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, and the <a href="Potawatomi">Potawatomi</a>.

Relations between Indians and Americans increasingly grew tense and sometimes violent as a result of territorial conflicts. Previous presidents had at times supported removal or attempts to "civilize" the Indians, but generally let the problem play itself out with minimal intervention. There had developed a growing popular and political movement to deal with the issue, and out of this policy to relocate certain Indian populations. Jackson, never known for timidity, became an advocate for this relocation policy in what many historians consider the most controversial aspect of his presidency.

In his First Annual Message to Congress, Jackson advocated land west of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> be set aside for Indian tribes. On May 26, 1830, Congress passed the <a href="Indian%20Removal%20Act">Indian Removal Act</a>, which Jackson signed into law two days later. The Act authorized the President to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in exchange for lands farther west, outside of existing state borders. The act specifically pertained to the <a href="Five%20Civilized%20Tribes">Five Civilized Tribes</a> in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a>, the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey state law.

Jackson, Eaton, and General Coffee negotiated with the Chickasaw, who quickly agreed to move. Jackson put Eaton and Coffee in charge of negotiating with the Choctaw. Lacking Jackson's skills at negotiation, they frequently bribed to the chiefs in order to gain their submission. The tactics worked, and the chiefs <a href="Treaty%20of%20Dancing%20Rabbit%20Creek">agreed</a> to move. The removal of the Choctaw took place in the winter of 1831 and 1832, and was wrought with misery and suffering. The Seminole, despite the signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Payne%27s%20Landing">Treaty of Payne's Landing</a> in 1832, refused to move. In December 1835, this dispute began the <a href="Second%20Seminole%20War">Second Seminole War</a>. The war lasted over six years, finally ending in 1842. Members of the Creek Nation had signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Cusseta">Treaty of Cusseta</a> in 1832, agreeing to move their tribe. However, the Creeks later resisted, leading to a second <a href="Creek%20War%20of%201836">Creek War</a>. A common complaint was that the men who had signed the treaties did not represent the whole tribe.
The state of <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> became involved in a contentious dispute with the Cherokee, culminating in the 1832 <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> decision in "<a href="Worcester%20v.%20Georgia">Worcester v. Georgia</a>". In that decision, <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a> <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice</a> <a href="John%20Marshall">John Marshall</a>, writing for the court, ruled that Georgia could not forbid whites from entering tribal lands, as it had attempted to do with two missionaries supposedly stirring up resistance amongst the tribespeople. Jackson is frequently attributed the following response: "John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it." The quote, apparently indicating Jackson's dismissive view of the courts, was attributed to Jackson by <a href="Horace%20Greeley">Horace Greeley</a>, who cited as his source Representative <a href="George%20N.%20Briggs">George N. Briggs</a>. Remini argues that Jackson did not say it because, while it "certainly sounds like Jackson...[t]here was nothing for him to enforce." This is because a writ of "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>" had never been issued for the missionaries. The Court also did not ask <a href="federal%20marshal">federal marshal</a>s to carry out the decision, as had become standard.

A group of Cherokees led by <a href="John%20Ridge">John Ridge</a> negotiated the <a href="Treaty%20of%20New%20Echota">Treaty of New Echota</a>. Ridge was not a widely recognized leader of the Cherokee, and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate. Another faction, led by <a href="John%20Ross%20%28Cherokee%20chief%29">John Ross</a>, unsuccessfully petitioned to protest the proposed removal. The treaty was enforced by Jackson's successor, President <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>, who sent 7,000 troops to carry out the relocation policy. Due to the infighting between political factions, many Cherokees thought their appeals were still being considered when the relocation began.; subsequently, as many as 4,000 Cherokees died on the "<a href="Trail%20of%20Tears">Trail of Tears</a>" in 1838. More than 45,000 American Indians were relocated to the West during Jackson's administration, though a few Cherokees walked back afterwards or migrated to the high <a href="Great%20Smoky%20Mountains">Smoky Mountains</a>. The <a href="Black%20Hawk%20War">Black Hawk War</a> took place during Jackson's presidency in 1832 after a group of Indians crossed into U.S. territory.

Jackson's initiatives to deal with the conflicts between Indians and American settlers has been a source of controversy. Starting around 1970, Jackson came under sharp attack from writers on the left, often on this issue. <a href="Howard%20Zinn">Howard Zinn</a> called him "the most aggressive enemy of the Indians in early American history" and "exterminator of Indians." In 1969, <a href="Francis%20Paul%20Prucha">Francis Paul Prucha</a> argued that Jackson's removal of the "Five Civilized Tribes" from the very hostile white environment in the Old South to Oklahoma probably saved their very existence. Similarly, Remini claims that, if not for Jackson's policies, the Southern tribes would have been totally wiped out, just like other tribes-namely, the <a href="Yamasee">Yamasee</a>, <a href="Mahican">Mahican</a>, and <a href="Narragansett%20people">Narragansett</a>-which did not move.

In an effort to purge the government of corruption, Jackson launched presidential investigations into all executive Cabinet offices and departments. He believed appointees should be hired on merit and withdrew many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies. He asked Congress to reform embezzlement laws, reduce fraudulent applications for federal pensions, revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties, and laws to improve government accounting. Jackson's Postmaster Barry resigned after a Congressional investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services, collusion and favoritism in awarding lucrative contracts, failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances. Jackson replaced Barry with Treasury Auditor and prominent Kitchen Cabinet member <a href="Amos%20Kendall">Amos Kendall</a>, who went on to implement much needed reforms in the Postal Service.
Jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a> by constitutional amendment in his annual messages to Congress as President. In his third annual message to Congress, he expressed the view "I have heretofore recommended amendments of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Federal Constitution</a> giving the election of President and Vice-President to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term. So important do I consider these changes in our fundamental law that I can not, in accordance with my sense of duty, omit to press them upon the consideration of a new Congress."

Jackson's time in the presidency also saw various improvements in financial provisions for veterans and their dependents. The Service Pension Act of 1832, for instance, provided pensions to veterans "even where there existed no obvious financial or physical need", while an Act of July 1836 enabled widows of Revolutionary War soldiers who met certain criteria to receive their husband's pensions. In 1836, Jackson established the ten-hour day in national shipyards.

Jackson enforced the <a href="Tenure%20of%20Office%20Act%20%281820%29">Tenure of Office Act</a>, signed earlier by President Monroe in 1820, that limited appointed office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates. Jackson believed that a <a href="Term%20limits%20in%20the%20United%20States">rotation in office</a> was actually a democratic reform preventing father-to-son succession of office and made civil service responsible to the popular will. Jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was "a leading principle in the republican creed". Jackson noted, "In a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station than another." Jackson believed that rotating political appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt bureaucracy. The number of federal office holders removed by Jackson were exaggerated by his opponents; Jackson only rotated about 20% of federal office holders during his first term, some for dereliction of duty rather than political purposes. Jackson, however, did use his image and presidential power to award loyal Democrats by granting them federal office appointments. Jackson's approach incorporated patriotism for country as qualification for holding office. Having appointed a soldier who had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to a postmastership Jackson stated "If he lost his leg fighting for his country, that is ... enough for me."

Jackson's theory regarding rotation of office generated what would later be called the <a href="spoils%20system">spoils system</a>. The political realities of Washington, however, ultimately forced Jackson to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations. Historians believe Jackson's presidency marked the beginning of an era of decline in public ethics. Supervision of bureaus and departments whose operations were outside of Washington (such as the New York Customs House; the Postal Service; the Departments of Navy and War; and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, whose budget had increased enormously in the previous two decades) proved to be difficult.

In 1828, Congress had approved the "<a href="Tariff%20of%20Abominations">Tariff of Abominations</a>," which set the tariff at an historically high rate. Southern planters, who sold their cotton on the world market, strongly opposed this tariff, which they saw as favoring northern interests. The issue nonetheless came to a head during Jackson's presidency, resulting in the <a href="Nullification%20Crisis">Nullification Crisis</a>, in which South Carolina threatened disunion.

The <a href="South%20Carolina%20Exposition%20and%20Protest">South Carolina Exposition and Protest</a> of 1828, secretly written by Calhoun, asserted that their state had the right to "nullify"—declare void—the tariff legislation of 1828. Although Jackson sympathized with the South in the tariff debate, he also vigorously supported a strong union, with effective powers for the central government. Jackson attempted to face down Calhoun over the issue, which developed into a bitter rivalry between the two men. One incident was at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving after-dinner toasts. <a href="Robert%20Hayne">Robert Hayne</a> began by toasting to "The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the States". Jackson then rose, and in a booming voice added "Our federal Union: It must be preserved!" – a clear challenge to Calhoun. Calhoun clarified his position by responding "The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!"

In May 1830, Jackson discovered that Calhoun had asked President Monroe to censure then-General Jackson for his invasion of <a href="Spanish%20Florida">Spanish Florida</a> in 1818 while Calhoun was serving as Secretary of War. Calhoun's and Jackson's relationship deteriorated further. By February 1831, the break between Calhoun and Jackson was final. Responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud, Calhoun had published letters between him and Jackson detailing the conflict in the "United States Telegraph". Jackson and Calhoun began an angry correspondence which lasted until Jackson stopped it in July. The "Telegraph," edited by <a href="Duff%20Green">Duff Green</a>, had previously supported Jackson. After it took the side of Calhoun, Jackson needed a new organ for the administration. He enlisted the help of longtime supporter <a href="Francis%20Preston%20Blair">Francis Preston Blair</a>, who in November 1830 established a newspaper known as "The Washington Globe," which from then on served as the official mouthpiece of the Democratic Party.

On July 14, 1832, Jackson signed into law the <a href="Tariff%20of%201832">Tariff of 1832</a>. It was designed to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates, but the nullifiers in South Carolina remained unsatisfied. On November 24, the South Carolina legislature officially nullified both the Tariff of 1832 and the Tariff of 1828. In response, Jackson sent <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> warships to <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a> harbor, and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession. On December 28, 1832, with less than two months remaining in his term, Calhoun resigned as Vice President to become a U.S. Senator for South Carolina.

In December 1832, Jackson issued a resounding proclamation against the "nullifiers", stating that he considered "the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</a>, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed". South Carolina, the President declared, stood on "the brink of insurrection and treason", and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had fought. Jackson also denied the right of secession: "The Constitution ... forms a government not a league ... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States is not a nation."

Jackson asked Congress to pass a "<a href="Force%20Bill">Force Bill</a>" explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the tariff, but its passage was delayed until <a href="protectionism">protectionists</a> led by Clay agreed to a reduced <a href="Tariff%20of%201833">Compromise Tariff</a>. The Force Bill and Compromise Tariff passed on March 1, 1833, and Jackson signed both. The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance, but in a final show of defiance, nullified the Force Bill. On May 1, 1833, Jackson wrote, "the tariff was only the pretext, and <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">disunion</a> and <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">southern confederacy</a> the real object. The next pretext will be the negro, or <a href="History%20of%20slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a> question."

Addressing the subject of foreign affairs in his First Annual Address to Congress, Jackson declared it to be his "settled purpose to ask nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that is wrong."

When Jackson took office, spoliation claims, or compensation demands for the capture of American ships and sailors, dating from the <a href="Napoleon">Napoleonic era</a>, caused strained relations between the U.S. and <a href="France">French</a> governments. The <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> had captured and sent American ships to Spanish ports while holding their crews captive forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules. According to Secretary of State <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a>, relations between the U.S. and France were "hopeless." Jackson's Minister to France, <a href="William%20Cabell%20Rives">William C. Rives</a>, through diplomacy was able to convince the French government to sign a reparations treaty on July 4, 1831, that would award the U.S. ₣ 25,000,000 ($5,000,000) in damages. The French government became delinquent in payment due to internal financial and political difficulties. The French king <a href="Louis%20Philippe%20I">Louis Philippe I</a> and his ministers blamed the French Chamber of Deputies. By 1834, the non-payment of reparations by the French government drew Jackson's ire and he became impatient. In , Jackson sternly reprimanded the French government for non-payment, stating the federal government was "wholly disappointed" by the French, and demanded Congress authorize trade reprisals against France. Feeling insulted by Jackson's words, the French people demanded an apology. In his December 1835 State of the Union Address, Jackson refused to apologize, stating he had a good opinion of the French people and his intentions were peaceful. Jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the French government was purposely stalling payment. The French government accepted Jackson's statements as sincere and in February 1836, American reparations were paid.

In addition to France, the Jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>, and <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. Jackson's state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>, and <a href="Siam">Siam</a>. Under the treaty of Great Britain, American trade was reopened in the West Indies. The trade agreement with Siam was America's first treaty between the United States and an Asiatic country. As a result, American exports increased 75% while imports increased 250%.

Jackson's attempt to purchase Texas from Mexico for $5,000,000 failed. The <a href="charg%C3%A9%20d%27affaires">chargé d'affaires</a> in Mexico, Colonel Anthony Butler, suggested that the U.S. take Texas over militarily, but Jackson refused. Butler was later replaced toward the end of Jackson's presidency. In 1835, the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a> began when pro-slavery American settlers in Texas fought the Mexican government for Texan independence. By May 1836, they had routed the Mexican military, establishing an independent <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a>. The new Texas government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from President Jackson and annexation into the United States. However, Jackson was hesitant recognizing Texas, unconvinced that the new republic could maintain independence from Mexico, and not wanting to make Texas an anti-slavery issue during the 1836 election. The strategy worked; the Democratic Party and national loyalties were held intact, and Van Buren was elected President. Jackson formally recognized the Republic of Texas, nominating a chargé d'affaires on the last full day of his Presidency, March 3, 1837.

Jackson was unsuccessful in opening trade with <a href="China">China</a> and <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. He was unsuccessful at thwarting Great Britain's presence and power in South America.

The <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201832">1832 presidential election</a> demonstrated the rapid development and organization of political parties during this time period. The Democratic Party's first national convention, held in Baltimore, nominated Jackson's choice for vice president, Van Buren. The National Republican Party, who had held their first convention in Baltimore earlier in December 1831, nominated <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>, now a senator from <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, and <a href="John%20Sergeant%20%28politician%29">John Sergeant</a> of Pennsylvania. The <a href="Anti-Masonic%20Party">Anti-Masonic Party</a>, which had earlier held its convention also in Baltimore in September 1831, nominated <a href="William%20Wirt%20%28Attorney%20General%29">William Wirt</a> of Maryland and <a href="Amos%20Ellmaker">Amos Ellmaker</a> of Pennsylvania; both Jackson and Clay were Masons.

In 1816, the <a href="Second%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Second Bank of the United States</a> was chartered by President <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> to restore the United States economy devastated by the War of 1812. Monroe had appointed <a href="Nicholas%20Biddle%20%28banker%29">Nicholas Biddle</a> as the Bank's executive. Clay hoped to make the Bank an issue in the election, so as to accuse Jackson of going beyond his powers. In January 1832 Biddle submitted to Congress a renewal of the Bank's charter four years before the original 20-year charter was to end. Biddle's recharter bill passed the Senate on June 11 and the House on July 3, 1832. Jackson believed that Bank was a fundamentally corrupt monopoly. Its stock was mostly held by foreigners, he insisted, and it exerted an unfair amount of control over the political system. He vetoed the bill on July 10. Jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values, believing the Bank was being run exclusively for the wealthy. Jackson stated the Bank made "the rich richer and the potent more powerful." He accused it of making loans with the intent of influencing elections. The <a href="National%20Republican%20Party">National Republican Party</a> immediately made Jackson's veto of the Bank a political issue. Jackson's political opponents castigated the veto as "the very slang of the leveller and demagogue," claiming Jackson was using class warfare to gain support from the common man.

Jackson, however, managed to successfully portray his veto as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny. Clay proved to be no match to Jackson's ability to resonate with the people and the Democratic Party's strong political networks. Democratic newspapers, parades, barbecues, and rallies increased Jackson's popularity. At Biddle's direction, the Bank poured thousands of dollars into a campaign to defeat Jackson, seemingly confirming Jackson's view that it interfered in the political process. Jackson himself made numerous popular public appearances on his return trip from Tennessee to Washington D.C. Jackson won the election decisively by a landslide, receiving 54 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes. Clay received 37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes. Wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote and seven electoral votes while the Anti-Masonic Party folded. Jackson believed the solid victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the Bank's recharter and his continued warfare on the Bank's control over the national economy.

In 1833, Jackson attempted to begin removing federal deposits from the bank, whose money-lending functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across America, thus drastically increasing credit and speculation. Jackson's moves were greatly controversial. He removed his moderately pro-Bank Treasury Secretary <a href="Louis%20McLane">Louis McLane</a>, having him serve instead as Secretary of State, replacing <a href="Edward%20Livingston">Edward Livingston</a>. He replaced McLane with <a href="William%20J.%20Duane">William J. Duane</a>. However, in September he fired Duane for refusing to remove the deposits. He replaced him with Attorney General <a href="Roger%20B.%20Taney">Roger B. Taney</a>, a strong opponent of the Bank. Under Taney, the deposits began to be removed. Biddle responded by stockpiling the Bank's reserves and contracting credit, thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about a financial panic. Intended to force Jackson into a compromise, the move backfired, increasing anti-Bank sentiment.

In 1834, those who opposed Jackson's expansion of executive power united and formed the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a>, calling Jackson "King Andrew I," and named their party after the <a href="Whigs%20%28British%20political%20party%29">English Whigs</a> who <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">opposed</a> eighteenth century British monarchy. A movement emerged amongst Whigs in the Senate to censure Jackson. The censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by Jackson-rival Senator <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>, which served only to perpetuate the animosity between him and Jackson. Jackson called Clay "reckless and as full of fury as a drunken man in a brothel." On March 28, the Senate voted to censure Jackson 26–20. It also rejected Taney as Treasury Secretary. Finally, on January 16, 1837, when the Jacksonians had a majority in the Senate, the censure was expunged after years of effort by Jackson supporters. The expunction movement was led by <a href="Thomas%20Hart%20Benton%20%28politician%29">Thomas Hart Benton</a>, who, despite the brawl years earlier, had become an ardent supporter of the president.

In 1836, in response to increased land speculation, Jackson issued the <a href="Specie%20Circular">Specie Circular</a>, an <a href="executive%20order%20%28United%20States%29">executive order</a> that required buyers of government lands to pay in "specie" (gold or silver coins). The result was high demand for specie, which many banks could not meet in exchange for their notes, causing the <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a>. The White House Van Buren biography notes, "Basically the trouble was the 19th-century cyclical economy of "boom and bust", which was following its regular pattern, but Jackson's financial measures contributed to the crash. His destruction of the Second Bank of the United States had removed restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks; wild speculation in lands, based on easy bank credit, had swept the West. To end this speculation, Jackson in 1836 had issued a Specie Circular..."

The first recorded physical attack on a U.S. president was directed at Jackson. He had ordered the dismissal of Robert B. Randolph from the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">navy</a> for <a href="embezzlement">embezzlement</a>. On May 6, 1833, Jackson sailed on USS "Cygnet" to <a href="Fredericksburg%2C%20Virginia">Fredericksburg, Virginia</a>, where he was to lay the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of <a href="Mary%20Ball%20Washington">Mary Ball Washington</a>, <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>'s mother. During a stopover near <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Virginia">Alexandria</a>, Randolph appeared and struck the President. He fled the scene chased by several members of Jackson's party, including the writer <a href="Washington%20Irving">Washington Irving</a>. Jackson declined to press charges.

On January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill a sitting President of the United States occurred just outside the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">United States Capitol</a>. When Jackson was leaving through the East Portico after the funeral of <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> Representative <a href="Warren%20R.%20Davis">Warren R. Davis</a>, <a href="Richard%20Lawrence%20%28failed%20assassin%29">Richard Lawrence</a>, an unemployed house painter from England, aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired. Lawrence pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired. Historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double misfiring. Jackson, infuriated, attacked Lawrence with his cane. Others present, including <a href="Davy%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BCrockett">Davy Crockett</a>, restrained and disarmed Lawrence.

Lawrence told doctors later his reasons for the shooting. He blamed Jackson for the loss of his job. He claimed that with the President dead, "money would be more plenty" (a reference to Jackson's struggle with the Bank of the United States) and that he "could not rise until the President fell". Finally, he told his interrogators that he was a deposed English king—specifically, <a href="Richard%20III%20of%20England">Richard III</a>, dead since 1485—and that Jackson was his clerk. He was deemed insane and was institutionalized.

Afterwards, the pistols were tested and retested. Each time they performed perfectly. Many believed that Jackson had been protected by the same <a href="Divine%20providence">Providence</a> that they believed also protected their young nation. The incident became a part of the Jacksonian mythos. Jackson initially suspected that a number of his political enemies may have orchestrated the attempt on his life. His suspicions were never proven.

During the summer of 1835, Northern <a href="abolitionism">abolitionists</a> began sending anti-slavery tracts through the U.S. Postal system into the South. Pro-slavery Southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials, which were deemed "incendiary". Some rioting also broke out. Jackson wanted sectional peace, and desired to placate Southerners ahead of the 1836 election. He fiercely disliked the abolitionists, whom he believed were, by instituting sectional jealousies, attempting to destroy the Union. However, Jackson also did not want to condone open insurrection. He supported the solution of Postmaster General <a href="Amos%20Kendall">Amos Kendall</a>, which gave Southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti-slavery tracts. That December, Jackson called on Congress to prohibit the circulation through the South of "incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection."

Jackson initially opposed any federal exploratory scientific expeditions during his first term in office. The last scientific federally funded expeditions took place from 1817 to 1823, led by <a href="Stephen%20Harriman%20Long">Stephen H. Harriman</a> on the <a href="Red%20River%20of%20the%20North">Red River of the North</a>. Jackson's predecessor, President Adams, attempted to launch a scientific oceanic exploration in 1828, but Congress was unwilling to fund the effort. When Jackson assumed office in 1829 he pocketed Adams' expedition plans. However, wanting to establish his presidential legacy, similar to <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and the <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark Expedition</a>, Jackson finally sponsored scientific exploration during his second term. On May 18, 1836, Jackson signed a law creating and funding the oceanic <a href="United%20States%20Exploring%20Expedition">United States Exploring Expedition</a>. Jackson put Secretary of Navy <a href="Mahlon%20Dickerson">Mahlon Dickerson</a> in charge, to assemble suitable ships, officers, and scientific staff for the expedition; with a planned launch before Jackson's term of office expired. Dickerson however proved unfit for the task, preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until 1838, during the presidency of Van Buren. One <a href="brig">brig</a> ship, , later used in the expedition; having been laid down, built, and commissioned by Secretary Dickerson in May 1836, circumnavigated the world, explored and mapped the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a>, confirming the existence of the <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> continent.

The national economy following the withdrawal of the remaining Funds from the Bank was booming and the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills. In January 1835, Jackson paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that has been accomplished. However, reckless speculation in land and railroads caused the <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a>. Contributing factors included Jackson's veto of the Second National Bank renewal charter in 1832 and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state banks in 1833 that caused Western Banks to relax their lending standards. Two other Jacksonian acts in 1836 contributed to the Panic of 1837: the <a href="Specie%20Circular">Specie Circular</a>, that mandated Western lands only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver, and the Deposit and Distribution Act, that transferred federal monies from Eastern to western state banks which in turn led to a speculation frenzy by banks. Jackson's "Specie Circular", albeit designed to reduce speculation and stabilize the economy, left many investors unable to afford to pay loans backed by gold and silver. The same year there was a downturn in Great Britain's economy that stopped investment in the United States. As a result, the U.S. economy went into a depression, banks became insolvent, the national debt (previously paid off) increased, business failures rose, cotton prices dropped, and unemployment dramatically increased. The depression that followed lasted for four years until 1841 when the economy began to rebound.

Jackson appointed six Justices to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a>.

Two new states were admitted into the Union during Jackson's presidency: <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> (June 15, 1836) and <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> (January 26, 1837).

After serving two terms as president, Jackson retired to his <a href="The%20Hermitage%20%28Nashville%2C%20Tennessee%29">Hermitage plantation</a> in 1837, and immediately began putting it in order as it had been poorly managed in his absence by his adopted son, Andrew Jr. Although he suffered ill health, Jackson remained influential in both national and state politics. He was a firm advocate of the federal union of the states and rejected any talk of secession, insisting, "I will die with the Union." Blamed for causing the <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a>, he was unpopular in his early retirement. Jackson continued to denounce the "perfidy and treachery" of banks and urged his successor, Van Buren, to repudiate the "Specie Circular" as president.

As a solution to the panic, he supported an <a href="Independent%20Treasury">Independent Treasury</a> system, which was designed to hold the money balances of the government in the form of <a href="Hard%20money%20%28policy%29">gold or silver</a> and would be restricted from printing <a href="Banknote">paper money</a> so as to prevent further <a href="inflation">inflation</a>. However, a coalition of conservative Democrats and Whigs opposed the bill, and it was not passed until 1840. During the delay, no effective remedy had been implemented for the depression. Van Buren grew deeply unpopular. A unified Whig Party nominated popular war hero <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> and former Jacksonian <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201840">1840 presidential election</a>. The Whigs' campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the Democrats during Jackson's campaigns. They depicted Van Buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary Americans, while glorifying Harrison's military record and portraying him as a man of the people. Jackson campaigned heavily for Van Buren in Tennessee. He favored the nomination of <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a> of Tennessee for vice president at the <a href="1840%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1840 Democratic National Convention</a> over unpopular incumbent <a href="Richard%20Mentor%20Johnson">Richard Mentor Johnson</a>. However, no nominee was chosen, and the party chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors.

Harrison won the election, and the Whigs captured majorities in both houses of Congress. "The democracy of the United States has been shamefully beaten," Jackson wrote to Van Buren. "but I trust, not conquered." However, Harrison died only a month into his term, and was replaced by Tyler. Jackson was encouraged because Tyler had a strong independent streak and was not bound by party lines. Sure enough, Tyler quickly incurred the wrath of the Whigs in 1841 when he vetoed two Whig-sponsored bills to establish a new national bank, bringing satisfaction to Jackson and other Democrats. After the second veto, Tyler's entire cabinet, with the exception of <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a>, resigned.

Jackson strongly favored the <a href="Texas%20annexation">annexation of Texas</a>, a feat he had been unable to accomplish during his own presidency. While Jackson still feared that annexation would stir up anti-slavery sentiment, his belief that the British would use Texas as a base to threaten the United States overrode his other concerns. He also insisted that Texas was part of the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a> and therefore rightfully belonged to the United States. At the request of Senator <a href="Robert%20J.%20Walker">Robert J. Walker</a> of Mississippi, acting on behalf of the Tyler administration, which also supported annexation, Jackson wrote several letters to Texas President <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a>, urging him to wait for the Senate to approve annexation and lecturing him on how much being a part of the United States would benefit Texas. Initially, Jackson again supported Van Buren for president in 1844 and Polk for vice president. When a letter from Calhoun to British Ambassador <a href="Richard%20Pakenham">Richard Pakenham</a> linking annexation to slavery was made public, Van Buren was moved into writing the "Hamlet letter," opposing annexation. This effectively extinguished any support that Van Buren might previously have enjoyed in the South. Jackson then threw his support behind Polk for the nomination. At the <a href="1844%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1844 Democratic National Convention</a>, Polk emerged as the party's nominee after Van Buren failed to win the required two-thirds majority of delegates. <a href="George%20M.%20Dallas">George M. Dallas</a> was selected for vice president. Jackson convinced Tyler to drop his plans of running for re-election as an independent by promising, as Tyler requested, to welcome the president and his allies back into the Democratic Party and by instructing Blair to stop criticizing the president. Polk won the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201844">election</a>, defeating the Whig nominee, Henry Clay. A bill of annexation was finally signed by Tyler on March 1, 1845.

Jackson died at his plantation on June 8, 1845, at the age of 78, of chronic <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, <a href="dropsy">dropsy</a>, and <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a>. According to a newspaper account from the Boon Lick Times, "[he] fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed ... but he subsequently revived ... Gen. Jackson died at the Hermitage at 6 o'clock P.M. on Sunday the 8th instant. ... When the messenger finally came, the old soldier, patriot and Christian was looking out for his approach. He is gone, but his memory lives, and will continue to live."

In his will, Jackson left his entire estate to his adopted son, Andrew Jackson Jr., except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various friends and other family members.

Jackson had three adopted sons: Theodore, an Indian about whom little is known, Andrew Jackson Jr., the son of Rachel's brother Severn Donelson, and <a href="Lyncoya%20Jackson">Lyncoya</a>, a Creek Indian orphan adopted by Jackson after the Battle of Tallushatchee. Lyncoya died of tuberculosis on July 1, 1828, at the age of sixteen.

The Jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children. John Samuel Donelson, <a href="Daniel%20Smith%20Donelson">Daniel Smith Donelson</a>, and <a href="Andrew%20Jackson%20Donelson">Andrew Jackson Donelson</a> were the sons of Rachel's brother Samuel Donelson, who died in 1804. Andrew Jackson Hutchings was Rachel's orphaned grand nephew. Caroline Butler, Eliza Butler, Edward Butler, and Anthony Butler were the orphaned children of Edward Butler, a family friend. They came to live with the Jacksons after the death of their father.

The widower Jackson invited Rachel's niece <a href="Emily%20Donelson">Emily Donelson</a> to serve as hostess at the White House. Emily was married to <a href="Andrew%20Jackson%20Donelson">Andrew Jackson Donelson</a>, who acted as Jackson's private secretary and in 1856 ran for Vice President on the <a href="Know%20Nothing">American Party</a> ticket. The relationship between the President and Emily became strained during the Petticoat affair, and the two became estranged for over a year. They eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House hostess. <a href="Sarah%20Yorke%20Jackson">Sarah Yorke Jackson</a>, the wife of Andrew Jackson Jr., became co-hostess of the White House in 1834. It was the only time in history when two women simultaneously acted as unofficial First Lady. Sarah took over all hostess duties after Emily died from tuberculosis in 1836. Jackson used <a href="Rip%20Raps">Rip Raps</a> as a retreat.

Jackson's quick temper was notorious. Biographer <a href="H.%20W.%20Brands">H. W. Brands</a> notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper: "Observers likened him to a volcano, and only the most intrepid or recklessly curious cared to see it erupt. ...His close associates all had stories of his blood-curdling oaths, his summoning of the Almighty to loose His wrath upon some miscreant, typically followed by his own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition. Given his record—in duels, brawls, mutiny trials, and summary hearings—listeners had to take his vows seriously."

On the last day of the presidency, Jackson admitted that he had but two regrets, that he "had been unable to shoot Henry Clay or to hang John C. Calhoun." Remini expressed the opinion that Jackson was often in control of his rage, and that he used it, along with his fearsome reputation, as a tool to get what he wanted.

Jackson was a lean figure, standing at tall, and weighing between on average. Jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair, which had completely grayed by the time he became president at age 61. He had penetrating deep blue eyes. Jackson was one of the more sickly presidents, suffering from chronic headaches, abdominal pains, and a hacking cough. Much of his trouble was caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed, that often brought up blood and sometimes made his whole body shake.

In 1838, Jackson became a member of the <a href="Downtown%20Presbyterian%20Church%20%28Nashville%29">First Presbyterian Church</a> in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a>.

Jackson was a <a href="Freemasonry">Freemason</a>, initiated at <a href="Harmony%20Lodge%20No.%201">Harmony Lodge No. 1</a> in Tennessee; he also participated in chartering several other lodges in Tennessee. He was the only U.S. president to have served as Grand Master of a state's Grand Lodge until <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> in 1945. His Masonic apron is on display in the <a href="Tennessee%20State%20Museum">Tennessee State Museum</a>. An obelisk and bronze Masonic plaque decorate his tomb at The Hermitage.

Jackson remains one of the most studied and controversial figures in American history. Historian <a href="Charles%20Grier%20Sellers">Charles Grier Sellers</a> says, "Andrew Jackson's masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most controversial figures ever to stride across the American stage." His most controversial presidential actions included removal of the Indians from the southeast, the dismantling of the Bank of the United States, and his threat to use military force against the state of South Carolina to make it stop nullifying federal laws. Not at all controversial was his resounding victory over the British at New Orleans in the last battle of the War of 1812. He was the main founder of the modern Democratic Party and became its iconic hero. He was always a fierce partisan, with many friends and many enemies.

Jackson was criticised by his contemporary <a href="Alexis%20de%20Tocqueville">Alexis de Tocqueville</a> in "<a href="Democracy%20in%20America">Democracy in America</a>" for flattering the dominant ideas of his time, including the mistrust over the federal power, for sometimes enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law:

Brands observes that Jackson's reputation declined after the mid-20th century as his actions towards Indians and African Americans received new attention. After the <a href="African-American%20Civil%20Rights%20Movement%20%281954%E2%80%931968%29">Civil Rights movement</a>, Brand writes, "his unrepentant ownership of slaves marked him as one to be censured rather than praised." Further, "By the turn of the present [21st] century, it was scarcely an exaggeration to say that the one thing American schoolchildren learned about Jackson was that he was the author of the Trail of Tears."

On a more favorable note, Remini argues that Jacksonian democracy..."stretches the concept of democracy about as far as it can go and still remain workable...As such it has inspired much of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in American history—<a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Populism</a>, <a href="Progressive%20Era">Progressivism</a>, the <a href="New%20Deal">New</a> and <a href="Fair%20Deal">Fair</a> Deals, and the programs of the <a href="New%20Frontier">New Frontier</a> and <a href="Great%20Society">Great Society</a>."

Jackson has long been honored, along with Thomas Jefferson, in the <a href="Jefferson%E2%80%93Jackson%20Day">Jefferson–Jackson Day</a> fundraising dinners. Each year, the dinner has been held by state <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> organizations to honor the two men whom the party regards as its founders. However, due to the fact that both Jefferson and Jackson were slave owners, as well as Jackson's Indian removal policies, many state party organizations have renamed the dinners.

Jackson <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Presidents%20on%20currency%23Andrew%20Jackson">has appeared</a> on U.S. banknotes as far back as 1869, and extending into the 21st century. His image has appeared on the $5, $10, $20 and $10,000 note. Most recently, his image appears on the U.S. $20 Federal reserve note, Series 2004-2006, with a redesigned, larger portrait. In 2016, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Secretary</a> <a href="Jack%20Lew">Jack Lew</a> announced his goal that by 2020 an image of <a href="Harriet%20Tubman">Harriet Tubman</a> would replace Jackson's depiction on the front side of the $20 banknote, and that an image of Jackson would be placed on the reverse side, though the final decision will be made by his successors.

Jackson has appeared on 13 different <a href="U.S.%20presidents%20on%20U.S.%20postage%20stamps%23Andrew%20Jackson">U.S. postage stamps</a>. Only George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> have appeared more often. He first appeared on an 1863 2-Cent stamp, which is commonly referred to by collectors as the "<a href="Black%20Jack%20%28stamp%29">Black Jack</a>" due to the large <a href="portrait%20painting">portraiture</a> of Jackson on its face printed in pitch black. During the American Civil War the Confederate government also issued two <a href="Postage%20stamps%20and%20postal%20history%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States">Confederate postage stamps</a> bearing Jackson's portrait, one a and the other a , both issued in 1863.

Numerous counties and cities are named after him, including the city of Jacksonville in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Florida</a> and <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>; the city of Jackson in <a href="Jackson%2C%20Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, <a href="Jackson%2C%20Michigan">Michigan</a>, <a href="Jackson%2C%20Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, <a href="Jackson%2C%20Missouri">Missouri</a>, and <a href="Jackson%2C%20Tennessee">Tennessee</a>; Jackson County in <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Florida">Florida</a>, <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Illinois">Illinois</a>, <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Missouri">Missouri</a>, <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Ohio">Ohio</a>, and <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Oregon">Oregon</a>; and <a href="Jackson%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Jackson Parish</a> in Louisiana.

Memorials to Jackson include a set of four identical <a href="equestrian%20statue">equestrian statue</a>s by the sculptor <a href="Clark%20Mills%20%28sculptor%29">Clark Mills</a>: in <a href="Lafayette%20Square%2C%20Washington%2C%20D.C.">Lafayette Square</a>, Washington, D.C.; in <a href="Jackson%20Square%20%28New%20Orleans%29">Jackson Square</a>, New Orleans; in Nashville on the grounds of the <a href="Tennessee%20State%20Capitol">Tennessee State Capitol</a>; and in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>. Other equestrian statues of Jackson have been erected elsewhere, as in the State Capitol grounds in <a href="Raleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina">Raleigh, North Carolina</a>. That statue controversially identifies him as one of the "presidents North Carolina gave the nation," and he is featured alongside James Polk and <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, both U.S. presidents born in North Carolina. There is a bust of Andrew Jackson in <a href="Plaza%20Ferdinand%20VII">Plaza Ferdinand VII</a> in <a href="Pensacola%2C%20Florida">Pensacola, Florida</a>, where he became the first governor of the <a href="Florida%20Territory">Florida Territory</a> in 1821.

Jackson and his wife Rachel were the main subjects of a 1951 historical novel by <a href="Irving%20Stone">Irving Stone</a>, "The President's Lady", which told the story of their lives up until Rachel's death. The novel was the basis for the <a href="The%20President%27s%20Lady">1953 film of the same name</a> starring <a href="Charlton%20Heston">Charlton Heston</a> as Jackson and <a href="Susan%20Hayward">Susan Hayward</a> as Rachel.

Jackson has been a supporting character in a number of historical films and television productions. <a href="Lionel%20Barrymore">Lionel Barrymore</a> played Jackson in "<a href="The%20Gorgeous%20Hussy">The Gorgeous Hussy</a>" (1936), a fictionalized biography of Peggy Eaton starring <a href="Joan%20Crawford">Joan Crawford</a>.

Andrew Johnson

Andrew Johnson (December 29, 1808 July 31, 1875) was the <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">17th President of the United States</a>, serving from 1865 to 1869. Johnson became president as he was <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president</a> at the time of the <a href="assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">assassination of Abraham Lincoln</a>. A <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Democratic%20Party">Democrat</a> who ran with Lincoln on the <a href="National%20Union%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">National Union</a> ticket, Johnson came to office as the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> concluded. The new president favored quick restoration of the <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">seceded states</a> to the Union. His plans did not give protection to the <a href="Freedmen%23United%20States">former slaves</a>, and he came into conflict with the <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Republican%20Party">Republican</a>-dominated Congress, culminating in <a href="Impeachment%20of%20Andrew%20Johnson">his impeachment</a> by the House of Representatives. He was acquitted in the Senate by one vote. 

Johnson was born in poverty in <a href="Raleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina">Raleigh, North Carolina</a>. Apprenticed as a tailor, he worked in several frontier towns before settling in <a href="Greeneville%2C%20Tennessee">Greeneville, Tennessee</a>. He served as <a href="alderman">alderman</a> and mayor there before being elected to the <a href="Tennessee%20House%20of%20Representatives">Tennessee House of Representatives</a> in 1835. After brief service in the <a href="Tennessee%20Senate">Tennessee Senate</a>, Johnson was elected to the federal House of Representatives in 1843, where he served five two-year terms. He became <a href="Governor%20of%20Tennessee">Governor of Tennessee</a> for four years, and was elected by the legislature to the US Senate in 1857. In his congressional service, he sought passage of the <a href="Homestead%20Bill">Homestead Bill</a>, which was enacted soon after he left his Senate seat in 1862. As <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern</a> slave states, including Tennessee, seceded to form the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>, Johnson remained firmly with the Union. He was the only sitting senator from a Confederate state who did not resign his seat upon learning of his state's secession. In 1862, Lincoln appointed him as military governor of Tennessee after most of it had been retaken. In 1864, Johnson, as a <a href="War%20Democrat">War Democrat</a> and <a href="Southern%20Unionist">Southern Unionist</a>, was a logical choice as <a href="running%20mate">running mate</a> for Lincoln, who wished to send a message of national unity in his re-election campaign; their ticket easily won. When Johnson was sworn in as vice president in March 1865, he gave a rambling speech, after which he secluded himself to avoid public ridicule. Six weeks later, the assassination of Lincoln made him president.

Johnson implemented his own form of <a href="Presidential%20Reconstruction">Presidential Reconstruction</a> – a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re-form their civil governments. When Southern states returned many of their old leaders, and passed <a href="Black%20Codes%20%28United%20States%29">Black Codes</a> to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, Congressional Republicans refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the Southern actions. Johnson vetoed their bills, and Congressional Republicans overrode him, setting a pattern for the remainder of his presidency. Johnson opposed the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, which gave citizenship to former slaves. In 1866, Johnson went on an unprecedented national tour promoting his executive policies, seeking to destroy his Republican opponents. As the conflict between the branches of government grew, Congress passed the <a href="Tenure%20of%20Office%20Act%20%281867%29">Tenure of Office Act</a>, restricting Johnson's ability to fire Cabinet officials. When he persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War <a href="Edwin%20Stanton">Edwin Stanton</a>, he was impeached by the House of Representatives, and narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate and removal from office. After failing to win the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination, Johnson left office in 1869.

Returning to Tennessee after his presidency, Johnson sought political vindication, and gained it in his eyes when he was elected to the Senate again in 1875, making Johnson the only former president to serve in the Senate. He died just months into his term. While some admire Johnson's strict <a href="constitutionalism">constitutionalism</a>, his strong opposition to federally guaranteed rights for <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a> is widely criticized. He is regarded by many historians as <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">one of the worst presidents in American history</a>.

Andrew Johnson was born in <a href="Raleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina">Raleigh, North Carolina</a>, on December 29, 1808, to <a href="Jacob%20Johnson%20%28father%20of%20Andrew%20Johnson%29">Jacob Johnson</a> (1778–1812) and Mary ("Polly") McDonough (1783–1856), a laundress. He was of English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. He had a brother William, four years his senior, and an older sister Elizabeth, who died in childhood. Johnson's birth in a <a href="log%20cabin">log cabin</a> was a political asset in the mid-19th century, and he would frequently remind voters of his humble origins. Jacob Johnson was a poor man, as had been his father, William Johnson, but he became town constable of Raleigh before marrying and starting a family. He died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell, shortly after rescuing three drowning men, when his son Andrew was three. Polly Johnson worked as a washerwoman and became the sole support of her family. Her occupation was then looked down on, as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied. There were even rumors that Andrew, who did not resemble his brother or sister, had been fathered by another man. Polly Johnson eventually remarried, to Turner Doughtry, who was as poor as she was.

Johnson's mother apprenticed her son William to a tailor, James Selby. Andrew also became an apprentice in Selby's shop at age ten and was legally bound to serve until his 21st birthday. Johnson lived with his mother for part of his service, and one of Selby's employees taught him rudimentary literacy skills. His education was augmented by citizens who would come to Selby's shop to read to the tailors as they worked. Even before he became an apprentice, Johnson came to listen. The readings caused a lifelong love of learning, and one of his biographers, <a href="Annette%20Gordon-Reed">Annette Gordon-Reed</a>, suggests that Johnson, later a gifted public speaker, learned the art as he threaded needles and cut cloth.

Johnson was not happy at James Selby's, and after about five years, both he and his brother ran away. Selby responded by placing a reward for their return: "Ten Dollars Reward. Ran away from the subscriber, two apprentice boys, legally bound, named William and Andrew Johnson ... [payment] to any person who will deliver said apprentices to me in Raleigh, or I will give the above reward for Andrew Johnson alone." The brothers went to <a href="Carthage%2C%20North%20Carolina">Carthage, North Carolina</a>, where Andrew Johnson worked as a tailor for several months. Fearing he would be arrested and returned to Raleigh, Johnson moved to <a href="Laurens%2C%20South%20Carolina">Laurens, South Carolina</a>. He found work quickly, met his first love, Mary Wood, and made her a quilt as a gift. However, she rejected his marriage proposal. He returned to Raleigh, hoping to buy out his apprenticeship, but could not come to terms with Selby. Unable to stay in Raleigh, where he risked being apprehended for abandoning Selby, he decided to move west.

Johnson left North Carolina for Tennessee, traveling mostly on foot. After a brief period in <a href="Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee">Knoxville</a>, he moved to <a href="Mooresville%2C%20Alabama">Mooresville, Alabama</a>. He then worked as a tailor in <a href="Columbia%2C%20Tennessee">Columbia, Tennessee</a>, but was called back to Raleigh by his mother and stepfather, who saw limited opportunities there and who wished to emigrate west. Johnson and his party traveled through the <a href="Blue%20Ridge%20Mountains">Blue Ridge Mountains</a> to <a href="Greeneville%2C%20Tennessee">Greeneville, Tennessee</a>. Andrew Johnson fell in love with the town at first sight, and when he became prosperous purchased the land where he had first camped and planted a tree in commemoration.

In Greeneville, Johnson established a successful tailoring business in the front of his home. In 1827, at the age of 18, he married 16-year-old <a href="Eliza%20McCardle%20Johnson">Eliza McCardle</a>, the daughter of a local shoemaker. The pair were married by Justice of the Peace Mordecai Lincoln, first cousin of <a href="Thomas%20Lincoln">Thomas Lincoln</a>, whose son would become president. The Johnsons were married for almost 50 years and had five children: Martha (1828), Charles (1830), Mary (1832), Robert (1834), and Andrew Jr. (1852). Though she suffered from <a href="Tuberculosis">Tuberculosis</a>, Eliza supported her husband's endeavors. She taught him mathematics skills and tutored him to improve his writing. Shy and retiring by nature, Eliza Johnson usually remained in Greeneville during Johnson's political rise. She was not often seen during her husband's presidency; their daughter Martha usually served as official hostess.

Johnson's tailoring business prospered during the early years of the marriage, enabling him to hire help and giving him the funds to invest profitably in real estate. He later boasted of his talents as a tailor, "my work never ripped or gave way." He was a voracious reader. Books about famous orators aroused his interest in political dialogue, and he had private debates on the issues of the day with customers who held opposing views. He also took part in debates at <a href="Greeneville%20College">Greeneville College</a>.

Johnson helped organize a mechanics' (working men's) ticket in the 1829 Greeneville municipal election. He was elected town alderman, along with his friends Blackston McDannel and Mordecai Lincoln. Following the 1831 <a href="Nat%20Turner%27s%20slave%20rebellion">Nat Turner slave rebellion</a>, a state convention was called to pass a new constitution, including provisions to <a href="disfranchisement">disenfranchise</a> free people of color. The convention also wanted to reform real estate tax rates, and provide ways of funding improvements to Tennessee's infrastructure. The constitution was submitted for a public vote, and Johnson spoke widely for its adoption; the successful campaign provided him with statewide exposure. On January 4, 1834, his fellow aldermen elected him mayor of Greeneville.
In 1835, Johnson made a bid for election to the "floater" seat which <a href="Greene%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Greene County</a> shared with neighboring <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20Tennessee">Washington County</a> in the <a href="Tennessee%20House%20of%20Representatives">Tennessee House of Representatives</a>. According to his biographer, <a href="Hans%20L.%20Trefousse">Hans L. Trefousse</a>, Johnson "demolished" the opposition in debate and won the election with almost a two to one margin. Soon after taking his seat, Johnson purchased his first slave, Dolly, aged 14. Dolly had three children over the years. Johnson had the reputation of treating his slaves kindly, and the fact that Dolly was dark-skinned, and her offspring much lighter, led to speculation both during and after his lifetime that he was the father. During his Greeneville days, Johnson joined the <a href="Tennessee%20Army%20National%20Guard">Tennessee Militia</a> as a member of the 90th Regiment. He attained the rank of <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a>, though while an enrolled member, Johnson was fined for an unknown offense. Afterwards, he was often addressed or referred to by his rank.

In his first term in the legislature, which met in the state capital of Nashville, Johnson did not consistently vote with either the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> or the newly formed <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a>, though he revered President <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>, a Democrat and Tennessean. The major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals, with the party system in a state of flux. The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson, fearing the concentration of power in the Executive Branch of the government; Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads, while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation. After <a href="Brookins%20Campbell">Brookins Campbell</a> and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re-election in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years. In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a Democrat and was elected. From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County. Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked to hear him.

In 1840, Johnson was selected as a presidential elector for Tennessee, giving him more statewide publicity. Although Democratic President <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a> was defeated by former Ohio senator <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>, Johnson was instrumental in keeping Tennessee and Greene County in the Democratic column. He was elected to the <a href="Tennessee%20Senate">Tennessee Senate</a> in 1841, where he served a two-year term. He had achieved financial success in his tailoring business, but sold it to concentrate on politics. He had also acquired additional real estate, including a larger home and a farm (where his mother and stepfather took residence), and among his assets numbered eight or nine slaves.

Having served in both houses of the state legislature, Johnson saw election to Congress as the next step in his political career. He engaged in a number of political maneuvers to gain Democratic support, including the displacement of the Whig postmaster in Greeneville, and defeated <a href="Jonesborough%2C%20Tennessee">Jonesborough</a> lawyer John A. Aiken by 5,495 votes to 4,892. In Washington, he joined a new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. Johnson advocated for the interests of the poor, maintained an anti-<a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> stance, argued for only limited spending by the government and opposed protective tariffs. With Eliza remaining in Greeneville, Congressman Johnson shunned social functions in favor of study in the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>. Although a fellow Tennessee Democrat, <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a>, <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201844">was elected president</a> in 1844, and Johnson had campaigned for him, the two men had difficult relations, and President Polk refused some of his patronage suggestions.

Johnson believed, as did many Southern Democrats, that the Constitution protected private property, including slaves, and thus prohibited the federal and state governments from abolishing slavery. He won a second term in 1845 against <a href="William%20Gannaway%20Brownlow">Wiliam G. Brownlow</a>, presenting himself as the defender of the poor against the aristocracy. In his second term, Johnson supported the Polk administration's decision to fight the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican War</a>, seen by some Northerners as an attempt to gain territory to expand slavery westward, and opposed the <a href="Wilmot%20Proviso">Wilmot Proviso</a>, a proposal to ban slavery in any territory gained from Mexico. He introduced for the first time his Homestead Bill, to grant to people willing to settle the land and gain title to it. This issue was especially important to Johnson because of his own humble beginnings.

In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201848">presidential election of 1848</a>, the Democrats split over the slavery issue, and abolitionists formed the <a href="Free%20Soil%20Party">Free Soil Party</a>, with former president Van Buren as their nominee. Johnson supported the Democratic candidate, former Michigan senator <a href="Lewis%20Cass">Lewis Cass</a>. With the party split, Whig nominee General <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a> was easily victorious, and carried Tennessee. Johnson's relations with Polk remained poor; the President recorded of his final New Year's reception in 1849 that

Johnson, due to national interest in new railroad construction and in response to the need for better transportation in his own district, also supported government assistance for the <a href="East%20Tennessee%2C%20Virginia%20and%20Georgia%20Railway">East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad</a>.
In his campaign for a fourth term, Johnson concentrated on three issues: slavery, homesteads and judicial elections. He defeated his opponent, <a href="Nathaniel%20G.%20Taylor">Nathaniel G. Taylor</a>, in August 1849, with a greater margin of victory than in previous campaigns. When the House convened in December, the party division caused by the Free Soil Party precluded the formation of the majority needed to elect a Speaker. Johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a Speaker by a plurality; some weeks later others took up a similar proposal, and Democrat <a href="Howell%20Cobb">Howell Cobb</a> was elected.

Once the Speaker election had concluded and Congress was ready to conduct legislative business, the issue of slavery took center stage. Northerners sought to admit California, a free state, to the Union. Kentucky's <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> introduced in the Senate a series of resolutions, the <a href="Compromise%20of%201850">Compromise of 1850</a>, to admit California and pass legislation sought by each side. Johnson voted for all the provisions except for the abolition of slavery in the nation's capital. He pressed resolutions for constitutional amendments to provide for popular election of senators (then elected by state legislatures) and of the president (chosen by the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a>), and limiting the tenure of federal judges to 12 years. These were all defeated.

A group of Democrats nominated <a href="Landon%20Carter%20Haynes">Landon Carter Haynes</a> to oppose Johnson as he sought a fifth term; the Whigs were so pleased with the internecine battle among the Democrats in the general election that they did not nominate a candidate of their own. The campaign included fierce debates: Johnson's main issue was the passage of the Homestead Bill; Haynes contended it would facilitate abolition. Johnson won the election by more than 1600 votes. Though he was not enamored of the party's presidential nominee in 1852, former New Hampshire senator <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a>, Johnson campaigned for him. Pierce was elected, but he failed to carry Tennessee. In 1852, Johnson managed to get the House to pass his Homestead Bill, but it failed in the Senate. The Whigs had gained control of the Tennessee legislature, and, under the leadership of <a href="Gustavus%20Adolphus%20Henry%2C%20Sr.">Gustavus Henry</a>, redrew the boundaries of Johnson's First District to make it a safe seat for their party. The "Nashville Union" termed this "Henry-mandering"; lamented Johnson, "I have no political future."

If Johnson considered retiring from politics upon deciding not to seek re-election, he soon changed his mind. His political friends began to maneuver to get him the nomination for governor. The Democratic convention unanimously named him, though some party members were not happy at his selection. The Whigs had won the past two gubernatorial elections, and still controlled the legislature. That party nominated Henry, making the "Henry-mandering" of the First District an immediate issue. The two men debated in county seats the length of Tennessee before the meetings were called off two weeks before the August 1853 election due to illness in Henry's family. Johnson won the election by 63,413 votes to 61,163; some votes for him were cast in return for his promise to support Whig <a href="Nathaniel%20Green%20Taylor">Nathaniel Taylor</a> for his old seat in Congress.

Tennessee's governor had little power: Johnson could propose legislation but not veto it, and most appointments were made by the Whig-controlled legislature. Nevertheless, the office was a "<a href="bully%20pulpit">bully pulpit</a>" that allowed him to publicize himself and his political views. He succeeded in getting the appointments he wanted in return for his endorsement of <a href="John%20Bell%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">John Bell</a>, a Whig, for one of the state's U.S. Senate seats. In his first biennial speech, Johnson urged simplification of the state judicial system, abolition of the Bank of Tennessee, and establishment of an agency to provide uniformity in weights and measures; the last was passed. Johnson was critical of the Tennessee common school system and suggested funding be increased via taxes, either statewide or county by county—a mixture of the two was passed. Reforms carried out during Johnson's time as governor included the foundation of the State's public library (making books available to all) and its first public school system, and the initiation of regular state fairs to benefit craftsmen and farmers.

Although the Whig Party was on its final decline nationally, it remained strong in Tennessee, and the outlook for Democrats there in 1855 was poor. Feeling that re-election as governor was necessary to give him a chance at the higher offices he sought, Johnson agreed to make the run. <a href="Meredith%20P.%20Gentry">Meredith P. Gentry</a> received the Whig nomination. A series of more than a dozen vitriolic debates ensued. The issues in the campaign were slavery, the prohibition of alcohol, and the <a href="nativism%20%28politics%29">nativist</a> positions of the <a href="Know%20Nothing%20Party">Know Nothing Party</a>. Johnson favored the first, but opposed the others. Gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question, and had gained the support of the Know Nothings, a group Johnson portrayed as a secret society. Johnson was unexpectedly victorious, albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853.

When the presidential election of 1856 approached, Johnson hoped to be nominated; some Tennessee county conventions designated him a "<a href="favorite%20son">favorite son</a>". His position that the best interests of the Union were served by slavery in some areas made him a practical compromise candidate for president. He was never a major contender; the nomination fell to former Pennsylvania senator <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>. Though he was not impressed by either, Johnson campaigned for Buchanan and his running mate, <a href="John%20C.%20Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a>, who were elected.

Johnson decided not to seek a third term as governor, with an eye towards election to the U.S. Senate. In 1857, while returning from Washington, his train derailed, causing serious damage to his right arm. This injury would trouble him in the years to come.

The victors in the 1857 state legislative campaign would, once they convened in October, elect a United States Senator. Former Whig governor <a href="William%20B.%20Campbell">William B. Campbell</a> wrote to his uncle, "The great anxiety of the Whigs is to elect a majority in the legislature so as to defeat Andrew Johnson for senator. Should the Democrats have the majority, he will certainly be their choice, and there is no man living to whom the Americans and Whigs have as much antipathy as Johnson." The governor spoke widely in the campaign, and his party won the gubernatorial race and control of the legislature. Johnson's final address as governor gave him the chance to influence his electors, and he made proposals popular among Democrats. Two days later the legislature elected him to the Senate. The opposition was appalled, with the Richmond "Whig" newspaper referring to him as "the vilest radical and most unscrupulous demagogue in the Union."

Johnson gained high office due to his proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and self-employed tradesmen who made up much of Tennessee's electorate. He called them the "plebeians"; he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state Democratic Party, but none could match him as a vote-getter. After his death, one Tennessee voter wrote of him, "Johnson was always the same to everyone ... the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen." Always seen in impeccably tailored clothing, he cut an impressive figure, and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate. Mostly denied the party's machinery, he relied on a network of friends, advisers, and contacts. One friend, Hugh Douglas, stated in a letter to him, "you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time. At heart many of us never wanted you to be Governor only none of the rest of us Could have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use you. Then we did not want you to go to the Senate but "the people would send you"."

The new senator took his seat when Congress convened in December 1857 (the term of his predecessor, <a href="James%20C.%20Jones">James C. Jones</a>, had expired in March). He came to Washington as usual without his wife and family; Eliza would visit Washington only once during Johnson's first time as senator, in 1860. Johnson immediately set about introducing the <a href="Homestead%20Bill">Homestead Bill</a> in the Senate, but as most senators who supported it were Northern (many associated with the newly founded <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>), the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue. Southern senators felt that those who took advantage of the provisions of the Homestead Bill were more likely to be Northern non-slaveholders. The issue of slavery had been complicated by the Supreme Court's ruling earlier in the year in "<a href="Dred%20Scott%20v.%20Sandford">Dred Scott v. Sandford</a>" that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories. Johnson, a slaveholding senator from a Southern state, made a major speech in the Senate the following May in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the Homestead Bill and slavery were not incompatible. Nevertheless, Southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation, 30–22. In 1859, it failed on a procedural vote when Vice President Breckinridge broke a tie against the bill, and in 1860, a watered-down version passed both houses, only to be vetoed by Buchanan at the urging of Southerners. Johnson continued his opposition to spending, chairing a committee to control it.

He argued against funding to build Washington, D.C.'s infrastructure, stating that it was unfair to expect state citizens to pay for the city's streets, even if it was the seat of government. He opposed spending money for troops to put down <a href="Utah%20War">the revolt</a> by the Mormons in <a href="Utah%20Territory">Utah Territory</a>, arguing for temporary volunteers as the United States should not have a standing army.

In October 1859, abolitionist <a href="John%20Brown%20%28abolitionist%29">John Brown</a> and sympathizers <a href="John%20Brown%27s%20raid%20on%20Harpers%20Ferry">raided the federal arsenal</a> at <a href="Harpers%20Ferry%2C%20West%20Virginia">Harpers Ferry</a>, Virginia (today West Virginia). Tensions in Washington between pro- and anti-slavery forces increased greatly. Johnson gave a major speech in the Senate in December, decrying Northerners who would endanger the Union by seeking to outlaw slavery. The Tennessee senator stated that "all men are created equal" from the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a> did not apply to African Americans, since the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Illinois">Constitution of Illinois</a> contained that phrase—and that document barred voting by African Americans.

Johnson hoped that he would be a compromise candidate for the presidential nomination as the Democratic Party tore itself apart over the slavery question. Busy with the Homestead Bill during the <a href="1860%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1860 Democratic National Convention</a> in <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>, he sent two of his sons and his chief political adviser to represent his interests in the backroom deal-making. The convention deadlocked, with no candidate able to gain the required two-thirds vote, but the sides were too far apart to consider Johnson as a compromise. The party split, with Northerners backing Illinois Senator <a href="Stephen%20Douglas">Stephen Douglas</a> while Southerners, including Johnson, supported Vice President Breckinridge for president. With former Tennessee senator <a href="John%20Bell%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">John Bell</a> running a fourth-party candidacy and further dividing the vote, the Republican Party elected its first president, former Illinois representative <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201860">The election of Lincoln</a>, known to be against the spread of slavery, was unacceptable to many in the South. Although secession from the Union had not been an issue in the campaign, talk of it began in the Southern states.

Johnson took to the Senate floor after the election, giving a speech well received in the North, "I will not give up this government ... No; I intend to stand by it ... and I invite every man who is a patriot to ... rally around the altar of our common country ... and swear by our God, and all that is sacred and holy, that the Constitution shall be saved, and the Union preserved." As Southern senators announced they would resign if their states seceded, he reminded Mississippi Senator <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> that if Southerners would only hold to their seats, the Democrats would control the Senate, and could defend the South's interests against any infringement by Lincoln. Gordon-Reed points out that while Johnson's belief in an indissoluble Union was sincere, he had alienated Southern leaders, including Davis, who would soon be <a href="President%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States%20of%20America">the president</a> of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>, formed by the seceding states. If the Tennessean had backed the Confederacy, he would have had small influence in its government.

Johnson returned home when his state took up the issue of secession. His successor as governor, <a href="Isham%20G.%20Harris">Isham G. Harris</a>, and the legislature, organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against both questions, sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him. Although Johnson's <a href="East%20Tennessee">eastern region of Tennessee</a> was largely against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Believing he would be killed if he stayed, Johnson fled through the <a href="Cumberland%20Gap">Cumberland Gap</a>, where his party was in fact shot at. He left his wife and family in Greeneville.

As the only member from a seceded state to remain in the Senate and the most prominent <a href="Southern%20Unionist">Southern Unionist</a>, Johnson had Lincoln's ear in the early months of the war. With most of Tennessee in Confederate hands, Johnson spent congressional recesses in Kentucky and Ohio, trying in vain to convince any Union commander who would listen to conduct an operation into East Tennessee.

Johnson's first tenure in the Senate came to a conclusion in March 1862 when Lincoln appointed him military governor of Tennessee. Much of the central and western portions of that seceded state had been recovered. Although some argued that civil government should simply resume once the Confederates were defeated in an area, Lincoln chose to use his power as commander in chief to appoint military governors over Union-controlled Southern regions. The Senate quickly confirmed Johnson's nomination along with the rank of <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a>. In response, the Confederates confiscated his land and his slaves, and turned his home into a military hospital. Later in 1862, after his departure from the Senate and in the absence of most Southern legislators, the <a href="Homestead%20Bill">Homestead Bill</a> was finally enacted. Along with legislation for <a href="land-grant%20college">land-grant college</a>s and for the <a href="transcontinental%20railroad">transcontinental railroad</a>, the Homestead Bill has been credited with opening the American West to settlement.

As military governor, Johnson sought to eliminate rebel influence in the state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and the ebb and flow of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as best he could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General <a href="Nathan%20Bedford%20Forrest">Nathan Bedford Forrest</a>. Relief from Union regulars did not come until <a href="William%20S.%20Rosecrans">William S. Rosecrans</a> defeated the Confederates at <a href="Battle%20of%20Murfreesboro">Murfreesboro</a> in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.

When Lincoln issued the <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a> in January 1863, declaring freedom for all slaves in Confederate-held areas, he exempted Tennessee at Johnson's request. The proclamation increased the debate over what should become of the slaves after the war, as not all Unionists supported abolition. Johnson finally decided that slavery had to end. He wrote, "If the institution of slavery ... seeks to overthrow it [the Government], then the Government has a clear right to destroy it". He reluctantly supported efforts to enlist former slaves into the Union Army, feeling that African Americans should perform menial tasks to release white Americans to do the fighting. Nevertheless, he succeeded in recruiting 20,000 black soldiers to serve the Union.

In 1860, Lincoln's running mate had been Maine Senator <a href="Hannibal%20Hamlin">Hannibal Hamlin</a>. Vice President Hamlin had served competently, was in good health, and was willing to run again. Nevertheless, Johnson emerged as running mate for Lincoln's re-election bid in 1864.

Lincoln considered several <a href="War%20Democrat">War Democrat</a>s for the ticket in 1864, and sent an agent to sound out General <a href="Benjamin%20Butler%20%28politician%29">Benjamin Butler</a> as a possible running mate. In May 1864, the President dispatched General <a href="Daniel%20Sickles">Daniel Sickles</a> to Nashville on a fact-finding mission. Although Sickles denied he was there either to investigate or interview the military governor, Johnson biographer Hans L. Trefousse believes Sickles's trip was connected to Johnson's subsequent nomination for vice president. According to historian Albert Castel in his account of Johnson's presidency, Lincoln was impressed by Johnson's administration of Tennessee. Gordon-Reed points out that while the Lincoln-Hamlin ticket might have been considered geographically balanced in 1860, "having Johnson, the "southern" War Democrat, on the ticket sent the right message about the folly of secession and the continuing capacity for union within the country." Another factor was the desire of Secretary of State <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William Seward</a> to frustrate the vice-presidential candidacy of his fellow New Yorker, former senator <a href="Daniel%20S.%20Dickinson">Daniel S. Dickinson</a>, a War Democrat, as Seward would probably have had to yield his place if another New Yorker became vice president. Johnson, once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of Sickles' visit, was active on his own behalf, giving speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy.

To sound a theme of unity, Lincoln in 1864 ran under the banner of the <a href="National%20Union%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">National Union Party</a>, rather than the Republicans. At <a href="1864%20National%20Union%20National%20Convention">the party's convention</a> in Baltimore in June, Lincoln was easily nominated, although there had been some talk of replacing him with a Cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals. After the convention backed Lincoln, former Secretary of War <a href="Simon%20Cameron">Simon Cameron</a> offered a resolution to nominate Hamlin, but it was defeated. Johnson was nominated for vice president by C.M. Allen of Indiana with an Iowa delegate as seconder. On the first ballot, Johnson led with 200 votes to 150 for Hamlin and 108 for Dickinson. On the second ballot, Kentucky switched to vote for Johnson, beginning a stampede. Johnson was named on the second ballot with 491 votes to Hamlin's 17 and eight for Dickinson; the nomination was made unanimous. Lincoln expressed pleasure at the result, "Andy Johnson, I think, is a good man." When word reached Nashville, a crowd assembled and the military governor obliged with a speech contending his selection as a Southerner meant that the rebel states had not actually left the Union.

Although it was unusual at the time for a national candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, <a href="George%20McClellan">George McClellan</a>, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.
Now Vice President-elect, Johnson was anxious to complete the work of re-establishing civilian government in Tennessee, although the timetable for the election of a new governor did not allow it to take place until after Inauguration Day, March 4. He hoped to remain in Nashville to complete his task, but was told by Lincoln's advisers that he could not stay, but would be sworn in with Lincoln. In these months, Union troops finished the retaking of eastern Tennessee, including Greeneville. Just before his departure, the voters of Tennessee ratified a new constitution, abolishing slavery, on February 22, 1865. One of Johnson's final acts as military governor was to certify the results.

Johnson traveled to Washington to be sworn in, although according to Gordon-Reed, "in light of what happened on March 4, 1865, it might have been better if Johnson had stayed in Nashville." He may have been ill; Castel cited typhoid fever, though Gordon-Reed notes that there is no independent evidence for that diagnosis. On the evening of March 3, Johnson attended a party in his honor; he drank heavily. Hung over the following morning at the Capitol, he asked Vice President Hamlin for some whiskey. Hamlin produced a bottle, and Johnson took two stiff drinks, stating "I need all the strength for the occasion I can have." In the Senate Chamber, Johnson delivered a rambling address as Lincoln, the Congress, and dignitaries looked on. Almost incoherent at times, he finally meandered to a halt, whereupon Hamlin hastily swore him in as vice president. Lincoln, who had watched sadly during the debacle, was sworn in, and delivered his acclaimed <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln%27s%20second%20inaugural%20address">Second Inaugural Address</a>.

In the weeks after the inauguration, Johnson only presided over the Senate briefly, and hid from public ridicule at the Maryland home of a friend, <a href="Francis%20Preston%20Blair">Francis Preston Blair</a>. When he did return to Washington, it was with the intent of leaving for Tennessee to re-establish his family in Greeneville. Instead, he remained after word came that General <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> had captured the Confederate capital of <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>, presaging the end of the war. Lincoln stated, in response to criticism of Johnson's behavior, that "I have known Andy Johnson for many years; he made a bad slip the other day, but you need not be scared; Andy ain't a drunkard."

On the afternoon of April 14, 1865, Lincoln and Johnson met for the first time since the inauguration. Trefousse states that Johnson wanted to "induce Lincoln not to be too lenient with traitors"; Gordon-Reed agrees.
That night, President Lincoln was shot and mortally wounded by <a href="John%20Wilkes%20Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a>, a Confederate sympathizer. The shooting of the President was part of a conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln, Johnson, and Seward the same night. Seward barely survived his wounds, while Johnson escaped attack as his would-be assassin, <a href="George%20Atzerodt">George Atzerodt</a>, got drunk instead of killing the vice president. <a href="Leonard%20J.%20Farwell">Leonard J. Farwell</a>, a fellow boarder at the Kirkwood House, awoke Johnson with news of Lincoln's shooting at <a href="Ford%27s%20Theatre">Ford's Theatre</a>. Johnson rushed to the President's deathbed, where he remained a short time, on his return promising, "They shall suffer for this. They shall suffer for this." Lincoln died at 7:22 am the next morning; Johnson's swearing in occurred between 10 and 11 am with Chief Justice <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a> presiding in the presence of most of the Cabinet. Johnson's demeanor was described by the newspapers as "solemn and dignified". Some Cabinet members had last seen Johnson, apparently drunk, at the inauguration. At noon, Johnson conducted his first Cabinet meeting in the Treasury Secretary's office, and asked all members to remain in their positions.

The events of the assassination resulted in speculation, then and subsequently, concerning Johnson and what the conspirators might have intended for him. In the vain hope of having his life spared after his capture, Atzerodt spoke much about the conspiracy, but did not say anything to indicate that the plotted assassination of Johnson was merely a ruse. Conspiracy theorists point to the fact that on the day of the assassination, Booth came to the Kirkwood House and left one of his cards. This object was received by Johnson's private secretary, William A. Browning, with an inscription, "Don't wish to disturb you. Are you at home? J. Wilkes Booth."

Johnson presided with dignity over Lincoln's funeral ceremonies in Washington, before his predecessor's body was sent home to <a href="Springfield%2C%20Illinois">Springfield, Illinois</a>, for burial. Shortly after Lincoln's death, Union General <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">William T. Sherman</a> reported he had, without consulting Washington, reached an armistice agreement with Confederate General <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a> for the surrender of Confederate forces in North Carolina in exchange for the existing state government remaining in power, with private property rights to be respected. This did not even acknowledge the freedom of those in slavery. This was not acceptable to Johnson or the Cabinet who sent word for Sherman to secure the surrender without making political deals, which he did. Further, Johnson placed a $100,000 bounty (equivalent to $ in ) on Confederate President Davis, then a fugitive, which gave him the reputation of a man who would be tough on the South. More controversially, he permitted the execution of <a href="Mary%20Surratt">Mary Surratt</a> for her part in Lincoln's assassination. Surratt was executed with three others, including Atzerodt, on July 7, 1865.

Upon taking office, Johnson faced the question of what to do with the Confederacy. President Lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee as the Union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a <a href="ten%20percent%20plan">ten percent plan</a> that would allow elections after ten percent of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the Union. Congress considered this too lenient; <a href="Wade%E2%80%93Davis%20Bill">its own plan</a>, requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath, passed both houses in 1864, but Lincoln <a href="pocket%20veto">pocket veto</a>ed it.

Johnson had three goals in Reconstruction. He sought a speedy restoration of the states, on the grounds that they had never truly left the Union, and thus should again be recognized once loyal citizens formed a government. To Johnson, African-American suffrage was a delay and a distraction; it had always been a state responsibility to decide who should vote. Second, political power in the Southern states should pass from the planter class to his beloved "plebeians". Johnson feared that the freedmen, many of whom were still economically bound to their former masters, might vote at their direction. Johnson's third priority was election in his own right in 1868, a feat no one who had succeeded a deceased president had managed to accomplish, attempting to secure a Democratic anti Congressional Reconstruction coalition in the South.

The Republicans had formed a number of factions. The <a href="Radical%20Republican">Radical Republican</a>s sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans. They believed that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in gratitude for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. They believed that top Confederates should be punished. The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic about the idea of African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states. They did not support African-American suffrage, which might threaten Democratic control in the South.

Johnson was initially left to devise a Reconstruction policy without legislative intervention, as Congress was not due to meet again until December 1865. Radical Republicans told the President that the Southern states were economically in a state of chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the Union. But Johnson, with the support of other officials including Seward, insisted that the franchise was a state, not a federal matter. The Cabinet was divided on the issue.

Johnson's first Reconstruction actions were two proclamations, with the unanimous backing of his Cabinet, on May 29. One recognized the Virginia government led by provisional Governor <a href="Francis%20Pierpont">Francis Pierpont</a>. The second provided amnesty for all ex-rebels except those holding property valued at $20,000 or more; it also appointed a temporary governor for North Carolina and authorized elections. Neither of these proclamations included provisions regarding <a href="black%20suffrage">black suffrage</a> or freedmen's rights. The President ordered constitutional conventions in other former rebel states.

As Southern states began the process of forming governments, Johnson's policies received considerable public support in the North, which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the South. While he received such support from the white South, he underestimated the determination of Northerners to ensure that the war had not been fought for nothing. It was important, in Northern public opinion, that the South acknowledge its defeat, that slavery be ended, and that the lot of African Americans be improved. Voting rights were less important—after all, only a handful of Northern states (mostly in New England) gave African-American men the right to vote on the same basis as whites, and in late 1865, Connecticut, Wisconsin, and Minnesota voted down African-American suffrage proposals by large margins. Northern public opinion tolerated Johnson's inaction on black suffrage as an experiment, to be allowed if it quickened Southern acceptance of defeat. Instead, white Southerners felt emboldened. A number of Southern states passed <a href="Black%20Codes%20%28United%20States%29">Black Codes</a>, binding African-American laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not quit, and allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for vagrancy and rent out their labor. Most Southerners elected to Congress were former Confederates, with the most prominent being Georgia Senator-designate and former Confederate vice president <a href="Alexander%20Stephens">Alexander Stephens</a>. Congress assembled in early December 1865; Johnson's conciliatory <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union">annual message</a> to them was well received. Nevertheless, Congress refused to seat the Southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate Reconstruction legislation.

Northerners were outraged at the idea of unrepentant Confederate leaders, such as Stephens, rejoining the federal government at a time when emotional wounds from the war remained raw. They saw the Black Codes placing African Americans in a position barely above slavery. Republicans also feared that restoration of the Southern states would return the Democrats to power. In addition, according to <a href="David%20O.%20Stewart">David O. Stewart</a> in his book on Johnson's impeachment, "the violence and poverty that oppressed the South would galvanize the opposition to Johnson".

Congress was reluctant to confront the President, and initially only sought to fine-tune Johnson's policies towards the South. According to Trefousse, "If there was a time when Johnson could have come to an agreement with the moderates of the Republican Party, it was the period following the return of Congress". The President was unhappy about the provocative actions of the Southern states, and about the continued control by the antebellum elite there, but made no statement publicly, believing that Southerners had a right to act as they did, even if it was unwise to do so. By late January 1866, he was convinced that winning a showdown with the Radical Republicans was necessary to his political plans – both for the success of Reconstruction and for re-election in 1868. He would have preferred that the conflict arise over the legislative efforts to enfranchise African Americans in the District of Columbia, a proposal that had been defeated overwhelmingly in an all-white referendum. A bill to accomplish this passed the House of Representatives, but to Johnson's disappointment, stalled in the Senate before he could veto it.
Illinois Senator <a href="Lyman%20Trumbull">Lyman Trumbull</a>, leader of the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an understanding with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the <a href="Freedmen%27s%20Bureau">Freedmen's Bureau</a> beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson, and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, to the delight of white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated, and that the Moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates too wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.

On February 22, 1866, <a href="Washington%27s%20Birthday">Washington's Birthday</a>, Johnson gave an impromptu speech to supporters who had marched to the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> and called for an address in honor of <a href="George%20Washington">the first president</a>. In his hour-long speech, he instead referred to himself over 200 times. More damagingly, he also spoke of "men ... still opposed to the Union" to whom he could not extend the hand of friendship he gave to the South. When called upon by the crowd to say who they were, Johnson named Pennsylvania Congressman <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a>, Massachusetts Senator <a href="Charles%20Sumner">Charles Sumner</a>, and abolitionist <a href="Wendell%20Phillips">Wendell Phillips</a>, and accused them of plotting his assassination. Republicans viewed the address as a declaration of war, while one Democratic ally estimated Johnson's speech cost the party 200,000 votes in the 1866 congressional midterm elections.

Although strongly urged by Moderates to sign the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201866">Civil Rights Bill</a>, Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African Americans and against whites. Within three weeks, Congress had overridden his veto, the first time that had been done on a major bill in American history. The veto of the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201866">Civil Rights Act of 1866</a>, often seen as a key mistake of Johnson's presidency, convinced Moderates there was no hope of working with him. Historian <a href="Eric%20Foner">Eric Foner</a> in his volume on Reconstruction views it as "the most disastrous miscalculation of his political career". According to Stewart, the veto was "for many his defining blunder, setting a tone of perpetual confrontation with Congress that prevailed for the rest of his presidency".

Congress also proposed the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> to the states. Written by Trumbull and others, it was sent for ratification by state legislatures in a process in which the president plays no part, though Johnson opposed it. The amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but also went further. The amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of Confederate war debts. Further, it disqualified many former Confederates from office, although the disability could be removed—by Congress, not the president. Both houses passed the Freedmen's Bureau Act a second time, and again the President vetoed it; this time, the veto was overridden. By the summer of 1866, when Congress finally adjourned, Johnson's method of restoring states to the Union by executive fiat, without safeguards for the freedmen, was in deep trouble. His home state of Tennessee ratified the Fourteenth Amendment despite the President's opposition. When Tennessee did so, Congress immediately seated its proposed delegation, embarrassing Johnson.

Efforts to compromise failed, and a political war ensued between the united Republicans on one side, and on the other, Johnson and his allies in the Democratic Party, North and South. He called a convention of the National Union Party. Republicans had returned to using their previous identifier; Johnson intended to use the discarded name to unite his supporters and gain election to a full-term, in 1868. The battleground was the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201866">election of 1866</a>; Southern states were not allowed to vote. Johnson campaigned vigorously, undertaking a public speaking tour, known as the "<a href="Swing%20Around%20the%20Circle">Swing Around the Circle</a>". The trip, including speeches in Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis and Columbus, proved politically disastrous, with the President making controversial comparisons between himself and Christ, and engaging in arguments with hecklers. These exchanges were attacked as beneath the dignity of the presidency. The Republicans won by a landslide, increasing their two-thirds majority in Congress, and made plans to control Reconstruction. Johnson blamed the Democrats for giving only lukewarm support to the National Union movement.

Even with the Republican victory in November 1866, Johnson considered himself in a strong position. The Fourteenth Amendment had been ratified by none of the Southern or <a href="Border%20states%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">border states</a> except Tennessee, and had been rejected in Kentucky, Delaware, and Maryland. As the amendment required ratification by three-quarters of the states to become part of the Constitution, he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor, leading to his election in 1868. Once it reconvened in December 1866, an energized Congress began passing legislation, often over a presidential veto; this included the District of Columbia voting bill. Congress admitted Nebraska to the Union over a veto, and the Republicans gained two senators and a state that promptly ratified the amendment. Johnson's veto of a bill for statehood for <a href="Colorado%20Territory">Colorado Territory</a> was sustained; enough senators agreed that a district with a population of 30,000 was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day.

In January 1867, Congressman Stevens introduced legislation to dissolve the Southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts, under <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a>. The states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions. African Americans could vote for or become delegates; former Confederates could not. In the legislative process, Congress added to the bill that restoration to the Union would follow the state's ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and completion of the process of adding it to the Constitution. Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise, whereby the South would agree to a modified version of the amendment without the disqualification of former Confederates, and for limited black suffrage. The Republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment, and the deal fell through. Although Johnson could have pocket vetoed the <a href="Reconstruction%20Acts">First Reconstruction Act</a> as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, he chose to veto it directly on March 2, 1867; Congress overruled him the same day. Also on March 2, Congress passed the <a href="Tenure%20of%20Office%20Act%20%281867%29">Tenure of Office Act</a> over the President's veto, in response to statements during the Swing Around the Circle that he planned to fire Cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him. This bill, requiring Senate approval for the firing of Cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards, was immediately controversial, with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to Johnson, whose key Cabinet officers were Lincoln holdovers.

Secretary of War <a href="Edwin%20Stanton">Edwin Stanton</a> was an able and hard-working man, but difficult to deal with. Johnson both admired and was exasperated by his War Secretary, who, in combination with <a href="General%20of%20the%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">General of the Army</a> Grant, worked to undermine the president's Southern policy from within his own administration. Johnson considered firing Stanton, but respected him for his wartime service as secretary. Stanton, for his part, feared allowing Johnson to appoint his successor and refused to resign, despite his public disagreements with his president.

The new Congress met for a few weeks in March 1867, then adjourned, leaving the House Committee on the Judiciary behind, charged with reporting back to the full House whether there were grounds for Johnson to be impeached. This committee duly met, examined the President's bank accounts, and summoned members of the Cabinet to testify. When a federal court released former Confederate president Davis on bail on May 13 (he had been captured shortly after the war), the committee investigated whether the President had impeded the prosecution. It learned that Johnson was eager to have Davis tried. A bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges; the committee adjourned on June 3.

Later in June, Johnson and Stanton battled over the question of whether the military officers placed in command of the South could override the civil authorities. The President had Attorney General <a href="Henry%20Stanbery">Henry Stanbery</a> issue an opinion backing his position that they could not. Johnson sought to pin down Stanton either as for, and thus endorsing Johnson's position, or against, showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the Cabinet. Stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications. When Congress reconvened in July, it passed a Reconstruction Act against Johnson's position, waited for his veto, overruled it, and went home. In addition to clarifying the powers of the generals, the legislation also deprived the President of control over the Army in the South. With Congress in recess until November, Johnson decided to fire Stanton and relieve one of the military commanders, General <a href="Philip%20Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a>, who had dismissed the governor of Texas and installed a replacement with little popular support. He was initially deterred by a strong objection from Grant. On August 5, the President demanded Stanton's resignation; the secretary refused to quit with Congress out of session. Johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of Congress as permitted under the Tenure of Office Act; Grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the Army.

Grant, under protest, followed Johnson's order transferring Sheridan and another of the district commanders, <a href="Daniel%20Sickles">Daniel Sickles</a>, who had angered Johnson by firmly following Congress's plan. The President also issued a proclamation pardoning most Confederates, exempting those who held office under the Confederacy, or who had served in federal office before the war and had breached their oaths. Although Republicans expressed anger with his actions, the 1867 elections generally went Democratic. No seats in Congress were directly elected in the polling, but the Democrats took control of the <a href="Ohio%20General%20Assembly">Ohio General Assembly</a>, allowing them to defeat for re-election one of Johnson's strongest opponents, Senator <a href="Benjamin%20Wade">Benjamin Wade</a>. Voters in Ohio, Connecticut, and Minnesota turned down propositions to grant African Americans the vote. The adverse results momentarily put a stop to Republican calls to impeach Johnson, who was elated by the elections. Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed.

Johnson notified Congress of Stanton's suspension and Grant's interim appointment. In January 1868, the Senate disapproved of his action, and reinstated Stanton, contending the President had violated the Tenure of Office Act. Grant stepped aside over Johnson's objection, causing a complete break between them. Johnson then dismissed Stanton and appointed <a href="Lorenzo%20Thomas">Lorenzo Thomas</a> to replace him. Stanton refused to leave his office, and on February 24, 1868, the House impeached the President for intentionally violating the Tenure of Office Act, by a vote of 128 to 47. The House subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment, for the most part alleging that he had violated the Tenure of Office Act, and had questioned the legitimacy of Congress.
On March 5, 1868, the impeachment trial began in the Senate and lasted almost three months; Congressmen <a href="George%20S.%20Boutwell">George S. Boutwell</a>, Benjamin Butler and Thaddeus Stevens acted as managers for the House, or prosecutors, and <a href="William%20M.%20Evarts">William M. Evarts</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20R.%20Curtis">Benjamin R. Curtis</a> and former Attorney General Stanbery were Johnson's counsel; Chief Justice Chase served as presiding judge. The defense relied on the provision of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act, and also argued that the President had the right to test the constitutionality of an act of Congress. Johnson's counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except for a pair of interviews in April, he complied.

Johnson maneuvered to gain an acquittal; for example, he pledged to Iowa Senator <a href="James%20W.%20Grimes">James W. Grimes</a> that he would not interfere with Congress's Reconstruction efforts. Grimes reported to a group of Moderates, many of whom voted for acquittal, that he believed the President would keep his word. Johnson also promised to install the respected <a href="John%20Schofield">John Schofield</a> as War Secretary. Kansas Senator <a href="Edmund%20G.%20Ross">Edmund G. Ross</a> received assurances that the new, Radical-influenced constitutions ratified in South Carolina and Arkansas would be transmitted to the Congress without delay, an action which would give him and other senators political cover to vote for acquittal. One reason senators were reluctant to remove the President was that his successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the <a href="President%20pro%20tempore%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">president "pro tempore"</a> of the Senate. Wade, a <a href="lame%20duck%20%28politics%29">lame duck</a> who left office in early 1869, was a Radical who supported such measures as women's suffrage, placing him beyond the pale politically in much of the nation. Additionally, a President Wade was seen as an obstacle to Grant's ambitions.

With the dealmaking, Johnson was confident of the result in advance of the verdict, and in the days leading up to the ballot, newspapers reported that Stevens and his Radicals had given up. On May 16, the Senate voted on the 11th article of impeachment, accusing Johnson of firing Stanton in violation of the Tenure of Office of Act once the Senate had overturned his suspension. Thirty-five senators voted "guilty" and 19 "not guilty", thus falling short by a single vote of the two-thirds majority required for conviction under the Constitution. Seven Republicans—Senators Grimes, Ross, Trumbull, <a href="William%20Pitt%20Fessenden">William Pitt Fessenden</a>, <a href="Joseph%20S.%20Fowler">Joseph S. Fowler</a>, <a href="John%20B.%20Henderson">John B. Henderson</a>, and <a href="Peter%20G.%20Van%20Winkle">Peter G. Van Winkle</a>—voted to acquit the President. With Stevens bitterly disappointed at the result, the Senate then adjourned for the <a href="1868%20Republican%20National%20Convention">Republican National Convention</a>; Grant was nominated for president. The Senate returned on May 26 and voted on the second and third articles, with identical 35–19 results. Faced with those results, Johnson's opponents gave up and dismissed proceedings. Stanton "relinquished" his office on May 26, and the Senate subsequently confirmed Schofield. When Johnson renominated Stanbery to return to his position as Attorney General after his service as a defense manager, the Senate refused to confirm him.

Allegations were made at the time and again later that bribery dictated the outcome of the trial. Even when it was in progress, Representative Butler began an investigation, held contentious hearings, and issued a report, unendorsed by any other congressman. Butler focused on a New York–based "Astor House Group", supposedly led by <a href="political%20boss">political boss</a> and editor <a href="Thurlow%20Weed">Thurlow Weed</a>. This organization was said to have raised large sums of money from whiskey interests through Cincinnati lawyer Charles Woolley to bribe senators to acquit Johnson. Butler went so far as to imprison Woolley in the Capitol building when he refused to answer questions, but failed to prove bribery.

Soon after taking office as president, Johnson reached an accord with Secretary of State <a href="William%20H.%20Seward">William H. Seward</a> that there would be no change in foreign policy. In practice, this meant that Seward would continue to run things as he had under Lincoln. Seward and Lincoln had been rivals for the nomination in 1860; the victor hoped that Seward would succeed him as president in 1869. At the time of Johnson's accession, <a href="French%20intervention%20in%20Mexico">the French had intervened in Mexico</a>, sending troops there. While many politicians had indulged in <a href="saber-rattling">saber-rattling</a> over the Mexican matter, Seward preferred quiet diplomacy, warning the French through diplomatic channels that their presence in Mexico was not acceptable. Although the President preferred a more aggressive approach, Seward persuaded him to follow his lead. In April 1866, the French government informed Seward that its troops would be brought home in stages, to conclude by November 1867.

Seward was an expansionist, and sought opportunities to gain territory for the United States. By 1867, the Russian government saw its <a href="Russian%20America">North American colony</a> (today Alaska) as a financial liability, and feared losing control as American settlement reached there. It instructed its minister in Washington, Baron <a href="Eduard%20de%20Stoeckl">Eduard de Stoeckl</a>, to negotiate a sale. De Stoeckl did so deftly, getting Seward to raise his offer from $5 million (coincidentally, the minimum that Russia had instructed de Stoeckl to accept) to $7 million, and then getting $200,000 added by raising various objections. This sum of $7.2 million is equivalent to $ in present-day terms. On March 30, 1867, de Stoeckl and Seward signed the treaty, working quickly as the Senate was about to adjourn. Johnson and Seward took the signed document to the President's Room in the Capitol, only to be told there was no time to deal with the matter before adjournment. The President summoned the Senate into session to meet on April 1; that body approved the treaty, 37–2. Emboldened by his success in Alaska, Seward sought acquisitions elsewhere. His only success was staking an American claim to uninhabited <a href="Wake%20Island">Wake Island</a> in the Pacific, which would be officially claimed by the U.S. <a href="William%20McKinley%23Peace%20and%20territorial%20gain">in 1898</a>. He came close with the <a href="Danish%20West%20Indies">Danish West Indies</a> as Denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite, but the Senate never voted on the treaty and it expired.

Another treaty that fared badly was the Johnson-Clarendon convention, negotiated in settlement of the <a href="Alabama%20Claims">"Alabama" Claims</a>, for damages to American shipping from British-built Confederate raiders. Negotiated by the <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">United States Minister to Britain</a>, former Maryland senator <a href="Reverdy%20Johnson">Reverdy Johnson</a>, in late 1868, it was ignored by the Senate during the remainder of the President's term. The treaty was rejected after he left office, and the Grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from Britain.

Johnson appointed nine Article III federal judges during his presidency, all to <a href="United%20States%20district%20court">United States district court</a>s; he did not appoint a justice to serve on the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a>. In April 1866, he nominated <a href="Henry%20Stanbery">Henry Stanbery</a> to fill the vacancy left with the death of <a href="John%20Catron">John Catron</a>, but Congress eliminated the seat to prevent the appointment, and to ensure that he did not get to make any appointments eliminated the next vacancy as well, providing that the court would shrink by one justice when one next departed from office. Johnson appointed his Greeneville crony, <a href="Samuel%20Milligan">Samuel Milligan</a>, to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Claims">United States Court of Claims</a>, where he served from 1868 until his death in 1874.

In June 1866, Johnson signed the Southern Homestead Act into law, believing that the legislation would assist poor whites. Around 28,000 land claims were successfully patented, although few former slaves benefitted from the law, fraud was rampant, and much of the best land was off-limits; reserved for grants to veterans or railroads. In June 1868, Johnson signed an eight-hour law passed by Congress that established an eight-hour workday for laborers and mechanics employed by the Federal Government. Although Johnson told members of a Workingmen's party delegation in Baltimore that he could not directly commit himself to an eight-hour day, he nevertheless told the same delegation that he greatly favoured the "shortest number of hours consistent with the interests of all." According to Richard F. Selcer, however, the good intentions behind the law were "immediately frustrated" as wages were cut by 20%.

Johnson sought nomination by the <a href="1868%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1868 Democratic National Convention</a> in New York in July 1868. He remained very popular among Southern whites, and boosted that popularity by issuing, just before the convention, a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted, meaning that only Davis and a few others still might face trial. On the first ballot, Johnson was second to former Ohio representative <a href="George%20H.%20Pendleton">George H. Pendleton</a>, who had been his Democratic opponent for vice president in 1864. Johnson's support was mostly from the South, and fell away as the ballots passed. On the 22nd ballot, former New York governor <a href="Horatio%20Seymour">Horatio Seymour</a> was nominated, and the President received only four votes, all from Tennessee.

The conflict with Congress continued. Johnson sent Congress proposals for amendments to limit the president to a single six-year term and make the president and the Senate directly elected, and for term limits for judges. Congress took no action on them. When the President was slow to officially report ratifications of the Fourteenth Amendment by the new Southern legislatures, Congress passed a bill, again over his veto, requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt. He still delayed as much as he could, but was required, in July 1868, to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the Constitution.
Seymour's operatives sought Johnson's support, but he long remained silent on the presidential campaign. It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour at all, and he never endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, in part because of their animus from the Stanton affair. In his annual message to Congress in December, Johnson urged the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, all would have been well. He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children, though not including those of <a href="President-elect%20of%20the%20United%20States">President-elect</a> Grant, who did not allow his to go.

On Christmas Day 1868, Johnson issued a final amnesty, this one covering everyone, including Davis. He also issued, in his final months in office, pardons for crimes, including one for Dr. <a href="Samuel%20Mudd">Samuel Mudd</a>, controversially convicted of involvement in the Lincoln assassination (he had set Booth's broken leg) and imprisoned in on Florida's <a href="Dry%20Tortugas">Dry Tortugas</a>.

On March 3, the President hosted a large public reception at the White House on his final full day in office. Grant had made it known that he was unwilling to ride in the same carriage as Johnson, as was customary, and Johnson refused to go to the inauguration at all. Despite an effort by Seward to prompt a change of mind, he spent the morning of March 4 finishing last-minute business, and then shortly after noon rode from the White House to the home of a friend.

After leaving the presidency, Johnson remained for some weeks in Washington, then returned to Greeneville for the first time in eight years. He was honored with large public celebrations along the way, especially in Tennessee, where cities hostile to him during the war hung out welcome banners. He had arranged to purchase a large farm near Greeneville to live on after his presidency.

Some expected Johnson to seek to be Tennessee's governor again or to attempt a return to the Senate, others that he would become a railroad executive. Johnson found Greeneville boring, and his private life was embittered by the suicide of his son Robert in 1869. Seeking vindication for himself, and revenge against his political enemies, he launched a Senate bid soon after returning home. Tennessee had gone Republican, but court rulings restoring the vote to some whites and the violence of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> kept down the African-American vote, leading to a Democratic victory in the legislative elections in August 1869. Johnson was seen as a likely victor in the Senate election, although hated by Radical Republicans, and also by some Democrats because of his wartime activities. Although he was at one point within a single vote of victory in the legislature's balloting, the Republicans eventually elected <a href="Henry%20Cooper%20%28U.S.%20Senator%29">Henry Cooper</a> over Johnson, 54–51. In 1872, there was a special election for an ; Johnson initially sought the Democratic nomination, but when he saw that it would go to former Confederate general <a href="Benjamin%20F.%20Cheatham">Benjamin F. Cheatham</a>, decided to run as an independent. The former president was defeated, finishing third, but the split in the Democratic Party defeated Cheatham in favor of an old Johnson Unionist ally, <a href="Horace%20Maynard">Horace Maynard</a>.

In 1873, Johnson contracted <a href="cholera">cholera</a> during an epidemic but recovered; that year he lost about $73,000, when the First National Bank of Washington went under, though he was eventually repaid much of the sum. He began looking towards the next Senate election, to take place in the legislature in early 1875. Johnson began to woo the farmers' <a href="The%20National%20Grange%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Patrons%20of%20Husbandry">Grange movement</a>; with his <a href="Jeffersonian%20democracy">Jeffersonian leanings</a>, he easily gained their support. He spoke throughout the state in his final campaign tour. Few African Americans outside the large towns were now able to vote as Reconstruction faded in Tennessee, setting a pattern that would be repeated in the other Southern states; the white domination would last almost a century. In the Tennessee legislative elections in August, the Democrats elected 92 legislators to the Republicans' eight, and Johnson went to Nashville for the legislative session. When the balloting for the Senate seat began on January 20, 1875, he led with 30 votes, but did not have the required majority as three former Confederate generals, one former colonel, and a former Democratic congressman split the vote with him. Johnson's opponents tried to agree on a single candidate who might gain majority support and defeat him, but failed, and he was elected on January 26 on the 54th ballot, with a margin of a single vote. Nashville erupted in rejoicing; remarked Johnson, "Thank God for the vindication."

Johnson's comeback garnered national attention, with the "St. Louis Republican" calling it, "the most magnificent personal triumph which the history of American politics can show". At his swearing-in in the Senate on March 5, 1875, he was greeted with flowers and sworn in with his predecessor as vice president, Hamlin, by that office's current incumbent, <a href="Henry%20Wilson">Henry Wilson</a>, who as senator had voted for his ousting. Many Republicans ignored Senator Johnson, though some, such as Ohio's <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a> (who had voted for conviction), shook his hand. Johnson remains the only former president to serve in the Senate. He spoke only once in the short session, on March 22 lambasting President Grant for his use of federal troops in support of Louisiana's Reconstruction government. The former president asked, "How far off is military despotism?" and concluded his speech, "may God bless this people and God save the Constitution."

Johnson returned home after the special session concluded. In late July, convinced some of his opponents were defaming him in the Ohio gubernatorial race, he decided to travel there to give speeches. He began the trip on July 28, and broke the journey at his daughter Mary's farm near <a href="Elizabethton%2C%20Tennessee">Elizabethton</a>, where his daughter Martha was also staying. That evening he suffered a stroke, but refused medical treatment until the next day, when he did not improve and two doctors were sent for from Elizabethton. He seemed to respond to their ministrations, but suffered another stroke on the evening of July 30, and died early the following morning at the age of 66. President Grant had the "painful duty" of announcing the death of the only surviving past president. Northern newspapers, in their obituaries, tended to focus on Johnson's loyalty during the war, while Southern ones paid tribute to his actions as president. Johnson's funeral was held on August 3 in Greeneville. He was buried with his body wrapped in an American flag and a copy of the U.S. Constitution placed under his head, according to his wishes. The burial ground was dedicated as the <a href="Andrew%20Johnson%20National%20Cemetery">Andrew Johnson National Cemetery</a> in 1906, and with his home and tailor's shop, is part of the <a href="Andrew%20Johnson%20National%20Historic%20Site">Andrew Johnson National Historic Site</a>.

According to Castel, "historians [of Johnson's presidency] have tended to concentrate to the exclusion of practically everything else upon his role in that titanic event [Reconstruction]". Through the remainder of the 19th century, there were few historical evaluations of Johnson and his presidency. Memoirs from Northerners who had dealt with him, such as former vice president Henry Wilson and Maine Senator <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a>, depicted him as an obstinate boor who tried to favor the South in Reconstruction, but who was frustrated by Congress. According to historian <a href="Howard%20K.%20Beale">Howard K. Beale</a> in his journal article about the historiography of Reconstruction, "Men of the postwar decades were more concerned with justifying their own position than they were with painstaking search for truth. Thus [Alabama congressman and historian] <a href="Hilary%20Herbert">Hilary Herbert</a> and his corroborators presented a Southern indictment of Northern policies, and Henry Wilson's history was a brief for the North."

The turn of the 20th century saw the first significant historical evaluations of Johnson. Leading the wave was Pulitzer Prize-winning historian <a href="James%20Ford%20Rhodes">James Ford Rhodes</a>, who wrote of the former president:

Rhodes ascribed Johnson's faults to his personal weaknesses, and blamed him for the problems of the postbellum South. Other early 20th-century historians, such as <a href="John%20Burgess%20%28political%20scientist%29">John Burgess</a>, <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> (who later became president himself) and <a href="William%20Dunning">William Dunning</a>, all Southerners, concurred with Rhodes, believing Johnson flawed and politically inept, but concluding that he had tried to carry out Lincoln's plans for the South in good faith. Author and journalist Jay Tolson suggests that Wilson "depict[ed Reconstruction] as a vindictive program that hurt even repentant southerners while benefiting northern opportunists, the so-called Carpetbaggers, and cynical white southerners, or Scalawags, who exploited alliances with blacks for political gain".
Even as Rhodes and his school wrote, <a href="Dunning%20School">another group of historians</a> was setting out on the full rehabilitation of Johnson, using for the first time primary sources such as his papers, provided by his daughter Martha before her death in 1901, and the diaries of Johnson's Navy Secretary, <a href="Gideon%20Welles">Gideon Welles</a>, first published in 1911. The resulting volumes, such as David Miller DeWitt's "The Impeachment and Trial of President Andrew Johnson" (1903), presented him far more favorably than they did those who had sought to oust him. In James Schouler's 1913 "History of the Reconstruction Period", the author accused Rhodes of being "quite unfair to Johnson", though agreeing that the former president had created many of his own problems through inept political moves. These works had an effect; although historians continued to view Johnson as having deep flaws which sabotaged his presidency, they saw his Reconstruction policies as fundamentally correct. 

Castel writes:
Beale wondered in 1940, "is it not time that we studied the history of Reconstruction without first assuming, at least subconsciously, that carpetbaggers and Southern white Republicans were wicked, that Negroes were illiterate incompetents, and that the whole white South owes a debt of gratitude to the restorers of 'white supremacy'?" Despite these doubts, the favorable view of Johnson survived for a time. In 1942, <a href="Van%20Heflin">Van Heflin</a> portrayed the former president as a fighter for democracy in the Hollywood film "<a href="Tennessee%20Johnson">Tennessee Johnson</a>". In 1948, a poll of his colleagues by historian <a href="Arthur%20M.%20Schlesinger">Arthur M. Schlesinger</a> deemed Johnson among the average presidents; in 1956, one by Clinton L. Rossiter named him as one of the near-great Chief Executives. Foner notes that at the time of these surveys, "the Reconstruction era that followed the Civil War was regarded as a time of corruption and misgovernment caused by granting black men the right to vote".

Earlier historians, including Beale, believed that money drove events, and had seen Reconstruction as an economic struggle. They also accepted, for the most part, that reconciliation between North and South should have been the top priority of Reconstruction. In the 1950s, historians began to focus on the African-American experience as central to Reconstruction. They rejected completely any claim of black inferiority, which had marked many earlier historical works, and saw the developing <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> as a second Reconstruction; <a href="Neoabolitionism">some writers stated</a> they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights. These authors sympathized with the Radical Republicans for their desire to help the African American, and saw Johnson as callous towards the freedman. In a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as <a href="Fawn%20Brodie">Fawn Brodie</a>, the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedman's lot. These volumes included major biographies of Stevens and Stanton. Reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society.

In the early 21st century, Johnson is among those commonly mentioned as the worst presidents in U.S. history. According to historian Glenn W. Lafantasie, who believes <a href="James%20Buchanan">Buchanan</a> the worst president, "Johnson is a particular favorite for the bottom of the pile because of his impeachment ... his complete mishandling of Reconstruction policy ... his bristling personality, and his enormous sense of self-importance." Tolson suggests that "Johnson is now scorned for having resisted Radical Republican policies aimed at securing the rights and well-being of the newly emancipated African-Americans". Gordon-Reed notes that Johnson, along with his contemporaries Pierce and Buchanan, are generally listed among the five worst presidents, but states, "there have never been more difficult times in the life of this nation. The problems these men had to confront were enormous. It would have taken a succession of Lincolns to do them justice."

Trefousse considers Johnson's legacy to be "the maintenance of white supremacy. His boost to Southern conservatives by undermining Reconstruction was his legacy to the nation, one that would trouble the country for generations to come." Gordon-Reed states of Johnson:

Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn (; , ; 11 December 1918 – 3 August 2008) (often Romanized to Alexandr or Alexander) was a Russian novelist, historian, and short story writer. He was an outspoken critic of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and <a href="communism">communism</a> and helped to raise global awareness of its <a href="Gulag">Gulag</a> forced labor camp system. He was allowed to publish only one work in the Soviet Union, "<a href="One%20Day%20in%20the%20Life%20of%20Ivan%20Denisovich">One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</a>" (1962), in the periodical "<a href="Novy%20Mir">Novy Mir</a>". After this he had to publish in the West, most notably "<a href="Cancer%20Ward">Cancer Ward</a>" (1968), "<a href="August%201914%20%28novel%29">August 1914</a>" (1971), and "<a href="The%20Gulag%20Archipelago">The Gulag Archipelago</a>" (1973). Solzhenitsyn was awarded the 1970 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> "for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian literature". Solzhenitsyn was afraid to go to <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> to receive his award for fear that he would not be allowed to reenter. He was eventually expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974, but returned to Russia in 1994 after <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">the state's dissolution</a>.

Solzhenitsyn was born in <a href="Kislovodsk">Kislovodsk</a>, <a href="Russian%20Soviet%20Federative%20Socialist%20Republic">RSFSR</a> (now in <a href="Stavropol%20Krai">Stavropol Krai</a>, Russia). His mother, Taisiya Zakharovna (née Shcherbak) was of <a href="Ukrainians">Ukrainian</a> descent. Her father had risen from humble beginnings to become a wealthy landowner, acquiring a large estate in the <a href="Kuban">Kuban</a> region in the northern foothills of the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>. During World War I, Taisiya went to Moscow to study. While there she met and married Isaakiy Solzhenitsyn, a young officer in the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Army">Imperial Russian Army</a> of <a href="Cossack">Cossack</a> origins and fellow native of the Caucasus region. The family background of his parents is vividly brought to life in the opening chapters of "August 1914", and in the later "<a href="The%20Red%20Wheel">Red Wheel</a>" novels.

In 1918, Taisia became pregnant with Aleksandr. On 15 June, shortly after her pregnancy was confirmed, Isaakiy was killed in a hunting accident. Aleksandr was raised by his widowed mother and aunt in lowly circumstances. His earliest years coincided with the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a>. By 1930 the family property had been turned into a <a href="kolkhoz">collective farm</a>. Later, Solzhenitsyn recalled that his mother had fought for survival and that they had to keep his father's background in the old Imperial Army a secret. His educated mother (who never remarried) encouraged his literary and scientific learnings and raised him in the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox</a> faith; she died in 1944.

As early as 1936, Solzhenitsyn began developing the characters and concepts for a planned epic work on <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>. This eventually led to the novel "August 1914" – some of the chapters he wrote then still survive. Solzhenitsyn studied mathematics at <a href="Rostov%20State%20University">Rostov State University</a>. At the same time he took correspondence courses from the Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History, at this time heavily ideological in scope. As he himself makes clear, he did not question the state ideology or the superiority of the Soviet Union until he spent time in the camps.

During the war Solzhenitsyn served as the commander of a <a href="sound-ranging">sound-ranging</a> battery in the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a>, was involved in major action at the front, and twice decorated. He was awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Red%20Star">Order of the Red Star</a> on 8 July 1944 for sound-ranging two German artillery batteries and adjusting counterbattery fire onto them, resulting in their destruction.

A series of writings published late in his life, including the early uncompleted novel "Love the Revolution!", chronicles his wartime experience and his growing doubts about the moral foundations of the Soviet regime.

While serving as an artillery officer in <a href="East%20Prussia">East Prussia</a>, Solzhenitsyn witnessed <a href="Soviet%20war%20crimes%23Germany">war crimes against local German civilians</a> by Soviet military personnel. The noncombatants and the elderly were robbed of their meager possessions and <a href="Mass%20rape%20of%20German%20women%20by%20Soviet%20Red%20Army">women and girls were gang-raped to death</a>. A few years later, in the forced labor camp, he memorized a poem entitled "<a href="Prussian%20Nights">Prussian Nights</a>" about these incidents. In this poem, which describes the gang-rape of a <a href="Poles">Polish</a> woman whom the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> soldiers mistakenly thought to be a German, the first-person narrator comments on the events with sarcasm and refers to the responsibility of official Soviet writers like <a href="Ilya%20Ehrenburg">Ilya Ehrenburg</a>.

In "<a href="The%20Gulag%20Archipelago">The Gulag Archipelago</a>", Solzhenitsyn wrote, "There is nothing that so assists the awakening of omniscience within us as insistent thoughts about one's own transgressions, errors, mistakes. After the difficult cycles of such ponderings over many years, whenever I mentioned the heartlessness of our highest-ranking bureaucrats, the cruelty of our executioners, I remember myself in my Captain's shoulder boards and the forward march of my battery through East Prussia, enshrouded in fire, and I say: 'So were "we" any better?'"

In February 1945, while serving in <a href="East%20Prussia">East Prussia</a>, Solzhenitsyn was arrested by <a href="SMERSH">SMERSH</a> for writing derogatory comments in private letters to a friend, Nikolai Vitkevich, about the conduct of the war by <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, whom he called "<a href="Khozyain">Khozyain</a>" ("the boss"), and "Balabos" (<a href="Yiddish%20dialects">Yiddish</a> rendering of <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> "baal ha-bayit" for "master of the house").
He was accused of anti-Soviet propaganda under <a href="Article%2058">Article 58</a> paragraph 10 of the Soviet criminal code, and of "founding a hostile organization" under paragraph 11.
Solzhenitsyn was taken to the <a href="Lubyanka%20Building">Lubyanka</a> prison in Moscow, where he was interrogated. On 9 May 1945, it was announced that Germany had surrendered and all of Moscow broke out in celebrations with fireworks and searchlights illuminating the sky to celebrate the victory in the Great Patriotic War as Russians call the war with Germany. From his cell in the Lubyanka, Solzhenitsyn remembered: "Above the muzzle of our window, and from all the other cells of the Lubyanka, and from all the windows of the Moscow prisons, we too, former prisoners of war and former front-line soldiers, watched the Moscow heavens, patterned with fireworks and crisscrossed with beams of searchlights. There was no rejoicing in our cells and no hugs and no kisses for us. That victory was not ours". On 7 July 1945, he was sentenced in his absence by <a href="Special%20Council%20of%20the%20NKVD">Special Council of the NKVD</a> to an eight-year term in a <a href="labour%20camp">labour camp</a>. This was the normal sentence for most crimes under Article 58 at the time.

The first part of Solzhenitsyn's sentence was served in several different work camps; the "middle phase," as he later referred to it, was spent in a "<a href="sharashka">sharashka</a>" (i.e., a special scientific research facility run by Ministry of State Security), where he met <a href="Lev%20Kopelev">Lev Kopelev</a>, upon whom he based the character of "Lev Rubin" in his book "<a href="The%20First%20Circle">The First Circle</a>", published in a self-censored or "distorted" version in the West in 1968 (an English translation of the full version was eventually published by Harper Perennial in October 2009).
In 1950, he was sent to a "Special Camp" for political prisoners. During his imprisonment at the camp in the town of <a href="Ekibastuz">Ekibastuz</a> in Kazakhstan, he worked as a miner, bricklayer, and foundry foreman. His experiences at Ekibastuz formed the basis for the book "<a href="One%20Day%20in%20the%20Life%20of%20Ivan%20Denisovich">One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</a>". One of his fellow political prisoners, <a href="Ion%20Moraru">Ion Moraru</a>, remembers that Solzhenitsyn spent some of his time at Ekibastuz writing.
While there Solzhenitsyn had a tumor removed. His cancer was not diagnosed at the time.

In March 1953, after his sentence ended, Solzhenitsyn was sent to internal exile for life at Birlik, a village in Baidibek district of South Kazakhstan region of Kazakhstan (Kok-terek rural district). His undiagnosed cancer spread until, by the end of the year, he was close to death. In 1954, he was permitted to be treated in a hospital in <a href="Tashkent">Tashkent</a>, where his tumor went into remission. His experiences there became the basis of his novel "<a href="Cancer%20Ward">Cancer Ward</a>" and also found an echo in the short story "The Right Hand." It was during this decade of imprisonment and exile that Solzhenitsyn abandoned <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a> and developed the philosophical and religious positions of his later life, gradually becoming a philosophically-minded Eastern Orthodox Christian as a result of his experience in prison and the camps.
He repented for some of his actions as a Red Army captain, and in prison compared himself to the perpetrators of the Gulag: "I remember myself in my captain's shoulder boards and the forward march of my battery through East Prussia, enshrouded in fire, and I say: 'So were we any better?'" His transformation is described at some length in the fourth part of "<a href="The%20Gulag%20Archipelago">The Gulag Archipelago</a>" ("The Soul and Barbed Wire"). The narrative poem "The Trail" (written without benefit of pen or paper in prison and camps between 1947 and 1952) and the 28 poems composed in prison, forced-labour camp, and exile also provide crucial material for understanding Solzhenitsyn's intellectual and spiritual odyssey during this period. These "early" works, largely unknown in the West, were published for the first time in Russian in 1999 and excerpted in English in 2006.

On 7 April 1940, while at the university, Solzhenitsyn married Natalia Alekseevna Reshetovskaya. They had just over a year of married life before he went into the army, then to the Gulag. They divorced in 1952, a year before his release, because wives of Gulag prisoners faced loss of work or residence permits. After the end of his internal exile, they remarried in 1957, divorcing a second time in 1972.

The following year Solzhenitsyn married his second wife, Natalia Dmitrievna Svetlova, a mathematician who had a son from a brief prior marriage. He and Svetlova (born 1939) had three sons: Yermolai (1970), <a href="Ignat%20Solzhenitsyn">Ignat</a> (1972), and Stepan (1973).

Solzhenitsyn's adopted son Dmitri Turin died on March 18, 1994, age 32 in Cavendish, Vermont, shortly before he could return with his father to Russia.

After <a href="Khrushchev%27s%20Secret%20Speech">Khrushchev's Secret Speech</a> in 1956, Solzhenitsyn was freed from exile and <a href="Rehabilitation%20%28Soviet%29">exonerated</a>. Following his return from exile, Solzhenitsyn was, while teaching at a secondary school during the day, spending his nights secretly engaged in writing. In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech he wrote that "during all the years until 1961, not only was I convinced I should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime, but, also, I scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything I had written because I feared this would become known."

In 1960, aged 42, he approached <a href="Aleksandr%20Tvardovsky">Aleksandr Tvardovsky</a>, a poet and the chief editor of the "Novyi Mir" magazine, with the manuscript of "<a href="One%20Day%20in%20the%20Life%20of%20Ivan%20Denisovich">One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich</a>". It was published in edited form in 1962, with the explicit approval of <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>, who defended it at the presidium of the Politburo hearing on whether to allow its publication, and added: "There's a Stalinist in each of you; there's even a Stalinist in me. We must root out this evil." The book quickly sold out and became an instant hit. In the 1960s, while he was publicly known to be writing "Cancer Ward", he was simultaneously writing "The Gulag Archipelago". During Khrushchev's tenure, "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich" was studied in schools in the Soviet Union, as were three more short works of Solzhenitsyn's, including his acclaimed short story "<a href="Matryona%27s%20Place">Matryona's Home</a>", published in 1963. These would be the last of his works published in the Soviet Union until 1990.

"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich" brought the Soviet system of prison labour to the attention of the West. It caused as much of a sensation in the Soviet Union as it did in the West—not only by its striking realism and candor, but also because it was the first major piece of Soviet literature since the 1920s on a politically charged theme, written by a non-party member, indeed a man who had been to Siberia for "libelous speech" about the leaders, and yet its publication had been officially permitted. In this sense, the publication of Solzhenitsyn's story was an almost unheard of instance of free, unrestrained discussion of politics through literature. Most Soviet readers realized this, but after Khrushchev had been ousted from power in 1964, the time for such raw exposing works came to an end.

Solzhenitsyn made an unsuccessful attempt, with the help of Tvardovsky, to get his novel, "Cancer Ward", legally published in the Soviet Union. This had to get the approval of the <a href="USSR%20Union%20of%20Writers">Union of Writers</a>. Though some there appreciated it, the work ultimately was denied publication unless it was to be revised and cleaned of suspect statements and anti-Soviet insinuations.

After Krushchev's removal in 1964, the cultural climate again became more repressive. Publishing of Solzhenitsyn's work quickly stopped; as a writer, he became a <a href="non-person">non-person</a>, and, by 1965, the <a href="KGB">KGB</a> had seized some of his papers, including the manuscript of "The First Circle". Meanwhile, Solzhenitsyn continued to secretly and feverishly work upon the most well-known of all his writings, "The Gulag Archipelago". The seizing of his novel manuscript first made him desperate and frightened, but gradually he realized that it had set him free from the pretenses and trappings of being an "officially acclaimed" writer, something which had come close to second nature, but which was becoming increasingly irrelevant.

After the KGB had confiscated Solzhenitsyn's materials in Moscow, during 1965–67 the preparatory drafts of "<a href="The%20Gulag%20Archipelago">The Gulag Archipelago</a>" were turned into finished typescript in hiding at his friends' homes in <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a>. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had befriended <a href="Arnold%20Susi">Arnold Susi</a>, a lawyer and former Estonian Minister of Education in a <a href="Lubyanka%20Building">Lubyanka</a> Prison cell. After completion, Solzhenitsyn's original handwritten script was kept hidden from the KGB in Estonia by Arnold Susi's daughter Heli Susi until the collapse of the Soviet Union.

In 1969 Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Union of Writers. In 1970, he was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a>. He could not receive the prize personally in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> at that time, since he was afraid he would not be let back into the Soviet Union. Instead, it was suggested he should receive the prize in a special ceremony at the Swedish embassy in Moscow. The Swedish government refused to accept this solution because such a ceremony and the ensuing media coverage might upset the Soviet Union and damage Swedish-Soviet relations. Instead, Solzhenitsyn received his prize at the 1974 ceremony after he had been expelled from the Soviet Union.

"The Gulag Archipelago" was composed from 1958 to 1967. It was a three-volume, seven part work on the Soviet prison camp system (Solzhenitsyn never had all seven parts of the work in front of him at one time). The book was based upon Solzhenitsyn's own experience as well as the testimony of 256 former prisoners and Solzhenitsyn's own research into the history of the Russian penal system. It discussed the system's origins from the founding of the Communist regime, with <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> having responsibility, detailing interrogation procedures, prisoner transports, prison camp culture, <a href="Kengir%20uprising">prisoner uprisings and revolts</a>, and the practice of <a href="Exile">internal exile</a>. "The Gulag Archipelago" has sold over thirty million copies in thirty-five languages.

According to fellow gulag historian <a href="Anne%20Applebaum">Anne Applebaum</a>, "The Gulag Archipelago"'s rich and varied authorial voice, its unique weaving together of personal testimony, philosophical analysis, and historical investigation, and its unrelenting indictment of communist ideology made "The Gulag Archipelago" one of the most impactful books of the 20th century.

Even though "The Gulag Archipelago" was not published in the Soviet Union, it was extensively criticized by the Party-controlled Soviet press. An editorial in "<a href="Pravda">Pravda</a>" on 14 January 1974 accused Solzhenitsyn of supporting "Hitlerites" and making "excuses for the crimes of the <a href="Committee%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20the%20Peoples%20of%20Russia">Vlasovites</a> and <a href="Stepan%20Bandera">Bandera</a> gangs." According to the editorial, Solzhenitsyn was "choking with pathological hatred for the country where he was born and grew up, for the socialist system, and for Soviet people."

During this period, he was sheltered by the cellist <a href="Mstislav%20Rostropovich">Mstislav Rostropovich</a>, who suffered considerably for his support of Solzhenitsyn and was eventually forced into exile himself.

In August 1971 the KGB allegedly made an attempt to assassinate Solzhenitsyn using an unknown biological agent (most likely <a href="ricin">ricin</a>) with an experimental gel-based delivery method. The attempt left him seriously ill but was unsuccessful.

In a discussion of its options in dealing with Solzhenitsyn the members of the Politburo considered his arrest and imprisonment and his expulsion to a socialist country. Guided by KGB chief <a href="Yury%20Andropov">Yury Andropov</a>, and with encouraging statements from <a href="Willy%20Brandt">Willy Brandt</a>, it was decided to deport the writer directly to <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>.

On 12 February 1974, Solzhenitsyn was arrested and deported the next day from the Soviet Union to <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, West Germany and stripped of his Soviet <a href="citizenship">citizenship</a>. The KGB had found the manuscript for the first part of "The Gulag Archipelago" and, less than a week later, <a href="Yevgeny%20Yevtushenko">Yevgeny Yevtushenko</a> suffered reprisals for his support of Solzhenitsyn. U.S. military attaché <a href="William%20Odom">William Odom</a> managed to smuggle out a large portion of Solzhenitsyn's archive, including the author's membership card for the <a href="Writers%27%20Union">Writers' Union</a> and Second World War military citations; Solzhenitsyn subsequently paid tribute to Odom's role in his memoir "Invisible Allies" (1995).

In West Germany, Solzhenitsyn lived in <a href="Heinrich%20B%C3%B6ll">Heinrich Böll</a>'s house in <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>. He then moved to <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, Switzerland before <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a> invited him to stay in the United States to "facilitate your work, and to accommodate you and your family." He stayed on the 11th floor of the <a href="Hoover%20Tower">Hoover Tower</a>, part of the <a href="Hoover%20Institution">Hoover Institution</a>, before moving to <a href="Cavendish%2C%20Vermont">Cavendish</a>, Vermont in 1976. He was given an honorary Literary Degree from <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> in 1978 and on Thursday, 8 June 1978 he gave his Commencement Address condemning, among other things, <a href="anthropocentrism">anthropocentrism</a> in modern western culture.

Over the next 17 years, Solzhenitsyn worked on his dramatized history of the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20of%201917">Russian Revolution of 1917</a>, "<a href="The%20Red%20Wheel">The Red Wheel</a>". By 1992, four "knots" (parts) had been completed and he had also written several shorter works.

Despite spending almost two decades in the United States, Solzhenitsyn did not become fluent in spoken English. He had, however, been reading English-language literature since his teens, encouraged by his mother. More importantly, he resented the idea of becoming a media star and of tempering his ideas or ways of talking in order to suit television. Solzhenitsyn's warnings about the dangers of Communist aggression and the weakening of the moral fiber of the West were generally well received in Western conservative circles (e.g. Ford administration staffers <a href="Richard%20Cheney">Richard Cheney</a> and <a href="Donald%20Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a> advocated on Solzhenitsyn's behalf for him to speak directly to President <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a> about the Soviet threat), prior to and alongside the tougher foreign policy pursued by US President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>. At the same time, liberals and <a href="secularism">secularists</a> became increasingly critical of what they perceived as his <a href="reactionary">reactionary</a> preference for <a href="Russian%20nationalism">Russian nationalism</a> and the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox</a> religion.

Solzhenitsyn also harshly criticised what he saw as the ugliness and spiritual vapidity of the dominant <a href="popular%20culture">pop culture</a> of the modern West, including television and much of popular music: "...the human soul longs for things higher, warmer, and purer than those offered by today's mass living habits... by TV stupor and by intolerable music." Despite his criticism of the "weakness" of the West, Solzhenitsyn always made clear that he admired the political liberty which was one of the enduring strengths of western democratic societies. In a major speech delivered to the International Academy of Philosophy in Liechtenstein on 14 September 1993, Solzhenitsyn implored the West not to "lose sight of its own values, its historically unique stability of civic life under the rule of law—a hard-won stability which grants independence and space to every private citizen."

In a series of writings, speeches, and interviews after his return to his native Russia in 1994, Solzhenitsyn spoke about his admiration for the local self-government he had witnessed first hand in Switzerland and New England. He "praised 'the sensible and sure process of <a href="grassroots%20democracy">grassroots democracy</a>, in which the local population solves most of its problems on its own, not waiting for the decisions of higher authorities.'" Solzhenitsyn's patriotism was inward-looking. He called for Russia to "renounce all mad fantasies of foreign conquest and begin the peaceful long, long long period of recuperation," as he put it in a 1979 BBC interview with Janis Sapiets.

In 1990, his Soviet citizenship was restored, and, in 1994, he returned to Russia with his wife, Natalia, who had become a United States citizen. Their sons stayed behind in the United States (later, his oldest son Yermolai returned to Russia to work for the Moscow office of a leading management consultancy firm). From then until his death, he lived with his wife in a <a href="dacha">dacha</a> in <a href="Troitse-Lykovo">Troitse-Lykovo</a> (Троице-Лыково) in west Moscow between the dachas once occupied by Soviet leaders <a href="Mikhail%20Suslov">Mikhail Suslov</a> and <a href="Konstantin%20Chernenko">Konstantin Chernenko</a>. A staunch believer in traditional Russian culture, Solzhenitsyn expressed his disillusionment with post-Soviet Russia in works such as "Rebuilding Russia", and called for the establishment of a strong presidential republic balanced by vigorous institutions of local self-government. The latter would remain his major political theme. Solzhenitsyn also published eight two-part short stories, a series of contemplative "miniatures" or prose poems, a literary memoir on his years in the West ("The Grain Between the Millstones"), among many other writings. Once back in Russia Solzhenitsyn hosted a television talk show program. Its eventual format was Solzhenitsyn delivering a 15-minute monologue twice a month; it was discontinued in 1995.

All of Solzhenitsyn's sons became US citizens. One, <a href="Ignat%20Solzhenitsyn">Ignat</a>, is acclaimed as a pianist and <a href="conductor%20%28music%29">conductor</a> in the United States.

Solzhenitsyn died of heart failure near Moscow on 3 August 2008, at the age of 89. A burial service was held at <a href="Donskoy%20Monastery">Donskoy Monastery</a>, Moscow, on Wednesday, 6 August 2008. He was buried the same day in the monastery in a spot he had chosen. Russian and world leaders paid tribute to Solzhenitsyn following his death.

The most complete 30-volume edition of Solzhenitsyn's collected works is soon to be published in Russia. The presentation of its first three volumes, already in print, recently took place in Moscow. Unhappy with the economic and social malaise of the <a href="Boris%20Yeltsin">Yeltsin era</a>, Solzhenitsyn expressed his admiration for <a href="President%20of%20Russia">President</a> <a href="Vladimir%20Putin">Vladimir Putin</a>'s attempts to restore a sense of national pride. Putin signed a <a href="Decree%20of%20the%20President%20of%20Russia">decree</a> conferring on Solzhenitsyn the <a href="State%20Prize%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation">State Prize of the Russian Federation</a> for his humanitarian work and personally visited the writer at his home on 12 June 2007 to present him with the award.

Yermolai Solzhenitsyn has translated some of his father's works. Stepan Solzhenitsyn lives and works in Moscow. <a href="Ignat%20Solzhenitsyn">Ignat Solzhenitsyn</a> is the music director of <a href="The%20Chamber%20Orchestra%20of%20Philadelphia">The Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia</a>.

On 8 August 1971, Solzhenitsyn was <a href="Poison%20laboratory%20of%20the%20Soviet%20secret%20services">poisoned</a> with what was later determined to be <a href="ricin">ricin</a>, but survived.

On 19 September 1974, <a href="Yuri%20Andropov">Yuri Andropov</a> approved a large-scale operation to discredit Solzhenitsyn and his family and cut his communications with <a href="Soviet%20dissidents">Soviet dissidents</a>. The plan was jointly approved by <a href="Vladimir%20Kryuchkov">Vladimir Kryuchkov</a>, <a href="Philipp%20Bobkov">Philipp Bobkov</a>, and Grigorenko (heads of First, Second and Fifth KGB Directorates). The residencies in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="Rome">Rome</a> and other European cities participated in the operation. Among other active measures, at least three <a href="StB">StB</a> agents became translators and secretaries of Solzhenitsyn (one of them translated the poem <a href="Prussian%20Nights">Prussian Nights</a>), keeping KGB informed regarding all contacts by Solzhenitsyn.

The KGB sponsored a series of hostile books about Solzhenitsyn, most notably a "memoir published under the name of his first wife, Natalia Reshetovskaya, but probably mostly composed by Service", according to historian <a href="Christopher%20Andrew%20%28historian%29">Christopher Andrew</a>. Andropov also gave an order to create "an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion between Pauk and the people around him" by feeding him rumors that everyone in his surrounding was a KGB agent and deceiving him in all possible ways. Among other things, the writer constantly received envelopes with photographs of car accidents, brain surgery and other frightening illustrations. After the KGB harassment in Zürich, Solzhenitsyn settled in <a href="Cavendish%2C%20Vermont">Cavendish</a>, Vermont, reduced communications with others and surrounded his property with a <a href="barbed%20wire">barbed wire</a> fence. His influence and <a href="moral%20authority">moral authority</a> for the West diminished as he became increasingly isolated and critical of Western individualism. KGB and <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">CPSU</a> experts finally concluded that he alienated American listeners by his "reactionary views and intransigent criticism of the US way of life", so no further <a href="active%20measures">active measures</a> would be required.

Regarding atheism, Solzhenitsyn declared:
In his 1974 essay "Repentance and Self-Limitation in the Life of Nations", Solzhenitsyn called for Russian Gentiles and Jews alike to take moral responsibility for the "renegades" from both communities who enthusiastically created a <a href="Marxist-Leninist">Marxist-Leninist</a> <a href="police%20state">police state</a> after the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a>. In a November 13, 1985 review of Solzhenitsyn's novel "August 1914" in the "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>", <a href="Jewish-American">Jewish-American</a> historian <a href="Richard%20Pipes">Richard Pipes</a> commented: "Every culture has its own brand of anti-Semitism. In Solzhenitsyn's case, it's not racial. It has nothing to do with blood. He's certainly not a racist; the question is fundamentally religious and cultural. He bears some resemblance to <a href="Fyodor%20Dostoyevsky">Fyodor Dostoyevsky</a>, who was a fervent Christian and patriot and a rabid anti-Semite. Solzhenitsyn is unquestionably in the grip of the Russian extreme right's view of the Revolution, which is that it was <a href="Jewish%20Bolshevism">the doing of the Jews</a>".

<a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> survivor <a href="Elie%20Wiesel">Elie Wiesel</a> denied this claim and insisted that Solzhenitsyn was not an anti-Semite: "He is too intelligent, too honest, too courageous, too great a writer." He added he wished Solzhenitsyn were more sensitive to Jewish suffering, but believed his insensitivity to be unconscious.

In his 1998 book "Russia in Collapse", Solzhenitsyn excoriated the Russian extreme right's obsession with anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic <a href="Conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy theories</a>.

In 2001, however, Solzhenitsyn published a two-volume work on the history of Russian-Jewish relations ("<a href="Two%20Hundred%20Years%20Together">Two Hundred Years Together</a>" 2001, 2002). A bestseller in Russia, the book triggered renewed accusations of <a href="anti-Semitism">anti-Semitism</a>.

The controversy was fueled by the similarities between "Two Hundred Years Together" and an anti-Semitic essay titled "Jews in the USSR and in the Future Russia". According to professor of Jewish history <a href="Semyon%20Reznik">Semyon Reznik</a>, textological analyses of the essay indicate Solzhenitsyn's authorship. Solzhenitsyn responded by saying that the essay was written using manuscripts stolen from him by the KGB forty years before. They were then carefully edited as part of the Soviet State's "<a href="active%20measures">active measures</a>" against him.

In some of his later political writings, such as "Rebuilding Russia" (1990) and "Russia in Collapse" (1998), Solzhenitsyn criticized the oligarchic excesses of the new Russian 'democracy,' while opposing any nostalgia for Soviet Communism. He defended moderate and self-critical patriotism (as opposed to <a href="Radical%20nationalism%20in%20Russia">extreme nationalism</a>), urged local self-government to a free Russia, and expressed concerns for the fate of the 25 million ethnic Russians in the "<a href="near%20abroad">near abroad</a>" of the former Soviet Union.

In a 2007 interview with "<a href="Der%20Spiegel">Der Spiegel</a>", Solzhenitsyn expressed disappointment that the "conflation of 'Soviet' and 'Russian', against which I spoke so often in the 1970s, has not passed away in the West, in the ex-socialist countries, or in the former Soviet republics. The elder political generation in communist countries is not ready for repentance, while the new generation is only too happy to voice grievances and level accusations, with present-day Moscow [as] a convenient target. They behave as if they heroically liberated themselves and lead a new life now, while Moscow has remained communist. Nevertheless, I dare [to] hope that this unhealthy phase will soon be over, that all the peoples who have lived through communism will understand that communism is to blame for the bitter pages of their history."

Delivering the commencement address at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> in 1978, he called the United States spiritually weak and mired in vulgar <a href="materialism">materialism</a>. Americans, he said, speaking in Russian through a translator, suffered from a "decline in courage" and a "lack of manliness." Few were willing to die for their ideals, he said. He condemned both the United States government and American society for its "hasty" capitulation in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. He criticized the country's music as intolerable and attacked its <a href="freedom%20of%20the%20press">unfettered press</a>, accusing it of violations of privacy. He said that the West erred in measuring other civilizations by its own model. While faulting Soviet society for denying fair legal treatment of people, he also faulted the West for being too legalistic: "A society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities." Solzhenitsyn also argued that the West erred in "denying [Russian culture's] autonomous character and therefore never understood it".

Solzhenitsyn emphasized the significantly more oppressive character of the Soviet <a href="totalitarian">totalitarian</a> regime, in comparison to the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> of the <a href="House%20of%20Romanov">House of Romanov</a>. He asserted that Imperial Russia did not practice any real censorship in the style of the Soviet <a href="Glavlit">Glavlit</a>, that political prisoners typically were not forced into <a href="labor%20camps">labor camps</a>, and that the number of political prisoners and exiles was only one ten-thousandth of those in the Soviet Union. He noted that the Tsar's secret police, or <a href="Okhrana">Okhrana</a>, was only present in the three largest cities, and not at all in the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Army">Imperial Russian Army</a>.

Shortly before his return to Russia, Solzhenitsyn delivered a speech in <a href="Lucs-sur-Boulogne">Lucs-sur-Boulogne</a> to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the <a href="Vend%C3%A9e%20Uprising">Vendée Uprising</a>. During his speech, Solzhenitsyn compared Lenin's <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s with the <a href="Jacobin%20Club">Jacobin Party</a> during the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>. He also compared the Vendean rebels with the Russian, Ukrainian, and Cossack peasants who rebelled against the Bolsheviks, saying that both were destroyed mercilessly by revolutionary despotism. However, he commented that, while the French <a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">Reign of Terror</a> ended with the <a href="Thermidorian%20reaction">toppling of the Jacobins</a> and the execution of <a href="Maximilien%20Robespierre">Maximilien Robespierre</a>, its Soviet equivalent continued to accelerate until the <a href="Khrushchev%20thaw">Khrushchev thaw</a> of the 1950s.

According to Solzhenitsyn, Russians were not the ruling nation in the Soviet Union. He believed that all the traditional culture of all ethnic groups were equally oppressed in favor of an atheism and Marxist-Leninism. Russian culture was even more repressed than any other culture in the Soviet Union, since the regime was more afraid of ethnic uprisings among Russian Christians than among any other ethnicity. Therefore, Solzhenitsyn argued, <a href="Russian%20nationalism">Russian nationalism</a> and the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox Church</a> should not be regarded as a threat by the West but rather as allies.

In "Rebuilding Russia," an essay first published in 1990 in "<a href="Komsomolskaya%20Pravda">Komsomolskaya Pravda</a>" Solzhenitsyn urged Russia to grant independence to all the non-Slav republics, which he claimed were sapping the Russian nation and he called for the creation of a new Slavic state bringing together Russia, <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>, and parts of <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> that he considered to be <a href="Russified">Russified</a>.

In 2006 Solzhenitsyn accused <a href="NATO">NATO</a> of trying to bring Russia under its control; he claimed this was visual because of its "ideological support for the '<a href="colour%20revolutions">colour revolutions</a>' and the paradoxical forcing of North Atlantic interests on Central Asia". In an 2006 interview with "<a href="Der%20Spiegel">Der Spiegel</a>" he stated "This was especially painful in the case of Ukraine, a country whose closeness to Russia is defined by literally millions of family ties among our peoples, relatives living on different sides of the national border. At one fell stroke, these families could be torn apart by a new dividing line, the border of a military bloc."

<a href="Daniel%20J.%20Mahoney">Daniel J. Mahoney</a>, however, has accused those who paint Solzhenitsyn as an uncritical adherent of Tsarism of "traducing" his real philosophy. Mahoney has written, "...if one opens almost any page of Solzhenitsyn's 1994 essay "The Russian Question" at the End of the Twentieth Century" one finds Solzhenitsyn attacking the cruelties and injustice of <a href="Serfdom%20in%20Russia">serfdom</a>, faulting Tsarist authorities for their blindness about the need for political liberty in Russia, and for their wasting of the nation's strength in unnecessary and counterproductive foreign adventures. Moreover, he attacks <a href="Pan-Slavism">Pan-Slavism</a>, the idea that Russia had a mission to unite Slavic peoples and to come to the defense of the Orthodox wherever they were under threat, as a 'wretched idea'."

Solzhenitsyn gave a speech to <a href="AFL%E2%80%93CIO">AFL–CIO</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> on 30 June 1975, where he mentioned how the system created by <a href="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a> in 1917 caused dozens of problems in the Soviet Union. He described how this system "in time of peace, artificially created a famine, causing 6 million people to die in the Ukraine in 1932 and 1933." Following this, he stated that "they died on the very edge of Europe. And Europe didn't even notice it. The world didn't even notice it—6 million people!" Solzhenitsyn opined on 2 April 2008 in "<a href="Izvestia">Izvestia</a>" that the <a href="Holodomor">1930s famine in the Ukraine</a> was no different from the <a href="Russian%20famine%20of%201921">Russian famine of 1921</a> as both were caused by the ruthless robbery of peasants by Bolshevik grain procurements. He claimed that the "provocatory shriek about a 'genocide' was started in the minds of Ukrainian chauvinists decades later, who are also viciously opposed to '<a href="Moskal">Moskal</a>s.'" The writer cautioned that the genocidal claim has its chances to be accepted by the West due to the general western ignorance of Russian and Ukrainian history.

Solzhenitsyn criticized the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> for not opening a new front against <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> in the west earlier in World War II. This resulted in Soviet domination and oppression of the nations of Eastern Europe. Solzhenitsyn claimed the Western democracies apparently cared little about how many died in the East, as long as they could end the war quickly and painlessly for themselves in the West.

Once in the United States, Solzhenitsyn urged the United States to reconsider its attitude towards the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> (which had ended in April 1975). In his commencement address at Harvard University in 1978, Solzhenitsyn alleged that many in the U.S. did not understand the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. He rhetorically asked if the American <a href="Anti-War%20Movement">Anti-War Movement</a> ever realized the contemptuous laughter which, he said, their actions had always provoked among the elderly men in the Soviet <a href="Politburo">Politburo</a>. Solzhenitsyn also accused American anti-war activists of moral responsibility for the political repression that followed the <a href="Fall%20of%20Saigon">Fall of Saigon</a>: "But members of the U.S. antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>ern nations, in a <a href="Cambodian%20genocide">genocide</a> and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there. Do those convinced <a href="Pacifism">pacifists</a> hear the moans coming from there?"


Solzhenitsyn's philosophy plays a key role in the 2012 film "<a href="Cloud%20Atlas%20%28film%29">Cloud Atlas</a>", where a character previously kept ignorant and subservient is illegally educated, and is shown reading and quoting his works.

In 1998, Russian filmmaker <a href="Alexander%20Sokurov">Alexander Sokurov</a> shot TV documentary "Besedy s Solzhenitsynym" ("<a href="The%20Dialogues%20with%20Solzhenitsyn">The Dialogues with Solzhenitsyn</a>") of four parts. The documentary shot in Solzhenitsyn's home shows his everyday life and covers his reflections on Russian history and literature.

On 12 December 2009, the Russian channel "<a href="Rossiya%20K">Rossiya K</a>" showed the French television documentary "L'Histoire Secrète de l'Archipel du Goulag" [The Secret History of the Goulag Archipel] made by Jean Crépu and <a href="Nicolas%20Miletitch">Nicolas Miletitch</a> and translated into Russian under the title "Taynaya Istoriya "Arkhipelaga Gulag"" ("Secret History: The Gulag Archipelago"). The documentary covers events related to creation and publication of "<a href="The%20Gulag%20Archipelago">The Gulag Archipelago</a>".

Aberdeen

Aberdeen (; , ; ; ) is <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>'s third most populous <a href="City%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">city</a>, one of Scotland's 32 <a href="Local%20government%20in%20Scotland">local government</a> <a href="Subdivisions%20of%20Scotland">council areas</a> and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>'s <a href="List%20of%20urban%20areas%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">37th most populous built-up area</a>, with an official population estimate of 196,670 for the city of Aberdeen and for the local authority area.

Nicknames include the "Granite City", the "Grey City" and the "Silver City with the Golden Sands". During the mid-18th to mid-20th centuries, Aberdeen's buildings incorporated locally quarried grey granite, which can sparkle like silver because of its high <a href="mica">mica</a> content. Since the discovery of <a href="North%20Sea%20oil">North Sea oil</a> in the 1970s, other nicknames have been the "Oil Capital of the World" or the "Energy Capital of the World".
The area around Aberdeen has been settled since at least 8,000 years ago, when prehistoric villages lay around the mouths of the rivers <a href="River%20Dee%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Dee</a> and <a href="River%20Don%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Don</a>. The city has a long, sandy coastline and a marine climate, the latter resulting in chilly summers and mild winters.

Aberdeen received <a href="Royal%20burgh">Royal Burgh</a> status from <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">David I of Scotland</a> (1124–53), transforming the city economically. The city's two universities, the <a href="University%20of%20Aberdeen">University of Aberdeen</a>, founded in 1495, and <a href="Robert%20Gordon%20University">Robert Gordon University</a>, which was awarded university status in 1992, make Aberdeen the educational centre of the north-east of Scotland. The traditional industries of fishing, paper-making, shipbuilding, and textiles have been overtaken by the <a href="Petroleum%20industry">oil industry</a> and Aberdeen's seaport. Aberdeen Heliport is one of the busiest commercial <a href="heliport">heliport</a>s in the world and the seaport is the largest in the north-east of Scotland.

Aberdeen has won the <a href="Britain%20in%20Bloom">Britain in Bloom</a> competition a record-breaking ten times, and hosts the <a href="Aberdeen%20International%20Youth%20Festival">Aberdeen International Youth Festival</a>, a major international event which attracts up to 1000 of the most talented young performing arts companies. In 2015, <a href="Mercer%20%28consulting%20firm%29">Mercer</a> named Aberdeen the 57th most liveable city in the world, as well as the fourth most liveable city in Britain. In 2012, <a href="HSBC">HSBC</a> named Aberdeen as a leading business hub and one of eight 'super cities' spearheading the UK's economy, marking it as the only city in Scotland to receive this accolade.

The Aberdeen area has seen human settlement for at least 8,000 years. The city began as two separate <a href="burgh">burgh</a>s: <a href="Old%20Aberdeen">Old Aberdeen</a> at the mouth of the river Don; and New Aberdeen, a fishing and trading settlement, where the Denburn waterway entered the river Dee estuary. The earliest <a href="charter">charter</a> was granted by <a href="William%20the%20Lion">William the Lion</a> in 1179 and confirmed the corporate rights granted by <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">David I</a>. In 1319, the Great Charter of <a href="Robert%20the%20Bruce">Robert the Bruce</a> transformed Aberdeen into a property-owning and financially independent community. Granted with it was the nearby <a href="Forest%20of%20Stocket">Forest of Stocket</a>, whose income formed the basis for the city's <a href="Common%20Good%20Fund%20%28Aberdeen%29">Common Good Fund</a> which still benefits Aberdonians.
During the <a href="Wars%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">Wars of Scottish Independence</a>, Aberdeen was under English rule, so Robert the Bruce laid siege to <a href="Aberdeen%20Castle">Aberdeen Castle</a> before destroying it in 1308, followed by the massacring of the English garrison and the retaking of Aberdeen for the townspeople. The city was burned by <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III of England</a> in 1336, but was rebuilt and extended, and called New Aberdeen. The city was strongly fortified to prevent attacks by neighbouring lords, but the gates were removed by 1770.
During the <a href="Scotland%20in%20the%20Wars%20of%20the%20Three%20Kingdoms">Wars of the Three Kingdoms</a> of 1644–1647 the city was plundered by both sides. In 1644, it was taken and ransacked by Royalist troops after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aberdeen%20%281644%29">Battle of Aberdeen</a> and two years later <a href="Battle%20of%20Aberdeen%20%281646%29">it was stormed</a> by a Royalist force under the command of <a href="George%20Gordon%2C%202nd%20Marquis%20of%20Huntly">Marquis of Huntly</a>. In 1647 an outbreak of <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a> killed a quarter of the population. In the 18th century, a new Town Hall was built and the first social services appeared with the <a href="Aberdeen%20Royal%20Infirmary">Infirmary</a> at <a href="Woolmanhill%20Hospital">Woolmanhill</a> in 1742 and the Lunatic Asylum in 1779. The council began major road improvements at the end of the 18th century with the main thoroughfares of <a href="George%20Street%2C%20Aberdeen">George Street</a>, <a href="King%20Street%2C%20Aberdeen">King Street</a> and <a href="Union%20Street%2C%20Aberdeen">Union Street</a> all completed at the beginning of the 19th century.
The expensive infrastructure works led to the city becoming bankrupt in 1817 during the <a href="Post-Napoleonic%20depression">Post-Napoleonic depression</a>, an economic downturn immediately after the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic wars</a>; but the city's prosperity later recovered. The increasing economic importance of Aberdeen and the development of the shipbuilding and fishing industries led to the construction of the present harbour including Victoria Dock and the South Breakwater, and the extension of the North Pier. Gas street lighting arrived in 1824 and an enhanced water supply appeared in 1830 when water was pumped from the Dee to a reservoir in Union Place. An underground sewer system replaced open sewers in 1865. The city was <a href="Municipal%20corporation">incorporated</a> in 1891. Although Old Aberdeen has a separate history and still holds its ancient charter, it is no longer officially independent. It is an integral part of the city, as is Woodside and the <a href="Royal%20Burgh">Royal Burgh</a> of <a href="Torry">Torry</a> to the south of the River Dee.

Though <a href="Common%20Brittonic">Brittonic</a> was spoken in Southern Scotland (part of "yr <a href="Hen%20Ogledd">Hen Ogledd</a>") up to medieval times, as evidenced (for example) by the poem "<a href="Y%20Gododdin">Y Gododdin</a>", Aberdeen was in <a href="Pictish">Pictish</a> territory and became Gaelic-speaking at some time in the medieval period. Old Aberdeen is the approximate location of "Aberdon", the first settlement of Aberdeen; this literally means "the mouth of the Don". The <a href="Celtic%20languages">Celtic</a> word "aber" means "river mouth", as in modern Welsh (Aberystwyth, Aberdare, Aberbeeg etc.). The Gaelic name is "Obar Dheathain" (variation: "Obairreadhain") ("obar" presumably being a loan from the earlier Pictish; the Gaelic term is "inbhir"), and in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> referred to the river as "Devana". Mediaeval (or ecclesiastical) Latin has it as "Aberdonia".

Aberdeen is locally governed by the <a href="Aberdeen%20City%20Council">Aberdeen City Council</a>, which comprises forty-five councillors who represent the city's <a href="ward%20%28politics%29">wards</a> and is headed by the <a href="List%20of%20Provosts%20and%20Lord%20Provosts%20of%20Aberdeen">Lord Provost</a>. The current Lord Provost is Barney Crockett. From May 2003 until May 2007 the council was run by a <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrat</a> and <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> coalition. Following the May 2007 local elections, the Liberal Democrats formed a new coalition with the <a href="Scottish%20National%20Party">Scottish National Party</a>. After a later SNP by-election gain from the Conservatives, this coalition held 28 of the 43 seats. Following the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%202017">election of 4 May 2017</a>, the council was controlled by a coalition of <a href="Scottish%20Labour%20Party">Scottish Labour</a>, <a href="Scottish%20Conservatives">Scottish Conservatives</a> and <a href="Independent%20%28politician%29">independent</a> councillors; the Labour councillors were subsequently suspended by Scottish Labour Party leader, <a href="Kezia%20Dugdale">Kezia Dugdale</a>.

Aberdeen is represented in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament of the United Kingdom</a> by three <a href="constituencies">constituencies</a>: <a href="Aberdeen%20North%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Aberdeen North</a> and <a href="Aberdeen%20South%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Aberdeen South</a> which are wholly within the Aberdeen City council area, and <a href="Gordon%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Gordon</a>, which includes a large area of the <a href="Aberdeenshire%20Council">Aberdeenshire Council</a> area.

In the <a href="Scottish%20Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a>, the city is represented by three constituencies with different boundaries: <a href="Aberdeen%20Central%20%28Scottish%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Aberdeen Central</a> and <a href="Aberdeen%20Donside%20%28Scottish%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Aberdeen Donside</a> are wholly within the Aberdeen City council area. <a href="Aberdeen%20South%20and%20North%20Kincardine%20%28Scottish%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Aberdeen South and North Kincardine</a> includes the North <a href="Kincardine">Kincardine</a> ward of <a href="Aberdeenshire%20Council">Aberdeenshire Council</a>. A further seven MSPs are elected as part of the <a href="North%20East%20Scotland%20%28Scottish%20Parliament%20electoral%20region%29">North East Scotland</a> electoral region. In the <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a> the city is represented by six <a href="Member%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament">MEPs</a> as part of the all-inclusive Scotland constituency.

The arms and banner of the city show three silver towers on red. This motif dates from at least the time of <a href="Robert%20the%20Bruce">Robert the Bruce</a> and represents the buildings that stood on the three hills of medieval Aberdeen: Aberdeen Castle on Castle Hill (today's <a href="Castlegate%2C%20Aberdeen">Castlegate</a>); the city gate on Port Hill; and a church on St Catherine's Hill (now levelled).

"Bon Accord" is the <a href="motto">motto</a> of the city and is French for "Good Agreement". Legend tells that its use dates from a password used by Robert the Bruce during the 14th century <a href="Wars%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">Wars of Scottish Independence</a>, when he and his men laid siege to the English-held Aberdeen Castle before destroying it in 1308. It is still widely present in the city, throughout street names, business names and the city's Bon Accord shopping mall.

The shield in the coat of arms is <a href="supporters%20%28heraldry%29">supported</a> by two <a href="leopard">leopard</a>s. A local magazine is called the "Leopard" and, when Union Bridge was widened in the 20th century, small statues of the creature in a sitting position were cast and placed on top of the railing posts (known locally as Kelly's Cats). The city's toast is "Happy to meet, sorry to part, happy to meet again"; this has been commonly misinterpreted as the translation of Bon Accord.

Being sited between two river mouths, the city has little natural exposure of bedrock. This leaves local geologists in a slight quandary: despite the high concentration of geoscientists in the area (courtesy of the oil industry), there is only a vague understanding of what underlies the city. To the south side of the city, coastal cliffs expose high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Grampian Group; to the south-west and west are extensive granites intruded into similar high-grade schists; to the north the metamorphics are intruded by gabbroic complexes instead. The small amount of geophysics done, and occasional building-related exposures, combined with small exposures in the banks of the River Don, suggest that it is actually sited on an inlier of Devonian "Old Red" sandstones and silts. The outskirts of the city spread beyond the (inferred) limits of the outlier onto the surrounding metamorphic/ igneous complexes formed during the <a href="Dalradian">Dalradian</a> period (approximately 480–600 million years ago) with sporadic areas of <a href="igneous%20rock">igneous</a> <a href="Diorite">Diorite</a> granites to be found, such as that at the <a href="Rubislaw%20quarry">Rubislaw quarry</a> which was used to build much of the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> parts of the city.

On the coast, Aberdeen has a long sand beach between the two rivers, the <a href="River%20Dee%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Dee</a> and the <a href="River%20Don%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Don</a>, which turns into high <a href="sand%20dunes">sand dunes</a> north of the Don stretching as far as <a href="Fraserburgh">Fraserburgh</a>; to the south of the Dee are steep rocky cliff faces with only minor pebble and shingle beaches in deep inlets. A number of granite outcrops along the south coast have been quarried in the past, making for spectacular scenery and good rock-climbing.

The city extends to , and includes the former burghs of Old Aberdeen, New Aberdeen, <a href="Woodside%2C%20Aberdeen">Woodside</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Burgh">Royal Burgh</a> of <a href="Torry">Torry</a> to the south of <a href="River%20Dee%2C%20Aberdeenshire">River Dee</a>. In this gave the city a population density of . The city is built on many hills, with the original beginnings of the city growing from Castle Hill, St. Catherine's Hill and Windmill Hill.

Aberdeen features an <a href="oceanic%20climate">oceanic climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen</a> "Cfb"). Aberdeen has far milder winter temperatures than one might expect for its northern location, although statistically it is the coldest city in the UK. During the winter, especially throughout December, the length of the day is very short, averaging 6 hours and 41 minutes between sunrise and sunset at winter solstice. As winter progresses, the length of the day grows fairly quickly, to 8 hours and 20 minutes by the end of January. Around summer solstice, the days will be around 18 hours long, having 17 hours and 55 minutes between sunrise and sunset. During this time of the year marginal <a href="nautical%20twilight">nautical twilight</a> lasts the entire night. Temperatures at this time of year will be typically hovering around during the day in most of the urban area, though nearer directly on the coast, and around in the westernmost suburbs, illustrating the cooling effect of the North Sea during summer. In addition, from June onward skies are more overcast than in April/May, as reflected in a lower percentage of possible sunshine (the percentage of daylight hours that are sunny). These factors render summer to be very temperate by European standards.

Two weather stations collect climate data for the area, <a href="Aberdeen%20Airport">Aberdeen/Dyce Airport</a>, and Craibstone. Both are about to the north west of the city centre, and given that they are in close proximity to each other, exhibit very similar climatic regimes. Dyce tends to have marginally warmer daytime temperatures year round owing to its slightly lower elevation, though it is more susceptible to harsh frosts. The coldest temperature to occur in recent years was during December 2010, while the following winter, Dyce set a new February high temperature station record on 28 February 2012 of ., and a new March high temperature record of on 25 March 2012.

The average temperature of the sea ranges from in March to in August.

The latest population estimate (mid 2012) for the urban area of Aberdeen is 196,670. For the wider settlement of Aberdeen including <a href="Cove%20Bay">Cove Bay</a> and Dyce the latest population estimate (mid 2012) is 209,460. For the local authority area of Aberdeen City the latest estimate (mid ) is 

In 1396 the population was about 3,000. By 1801 it had become 26,992; (1901) 153,503; (1941) 182,467.

The 2011 census showed that there are fewer young people in Aberdeen, with 16.4% under 16, opposed to the national average of 19.2%. According to the 2011 census Aberdeen is 91.9% white, ethnically, 24.7% were born outside Scotland, higher than the national average of 16%. Of this population 7.6% were born in other parts of the UK. 8.2% of Aberdonians stated to be from an ethnic minority (non-white) in the 2011 census, with 9,519 (4.3%) being Asian, with 3,385 (1.5%) coming from <a href="India">India</a> and 2,187 (1.0%) being <a href="British%20Chinese">Chinese</a>. The city has around 5,610 (2.6%) residents of African or Caribbean origin, which is a higher percentage than both <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> and <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. The most multicultural part of the city is George Street, which has many ethnic restaurants, supermarkets and hairdressers.

In the household, there were 97,013 individual dwellings recorded in the city of which 61% were privately owned, 9% privately rented and 23% rented from the council. The most popular type of dwellings are apartments which comprise 49% of residences followed by semi-detached at just below 22%.
The median income of a household in the city is £16,813 (the mean income is £20,292) (2005) which places approximately 18% households in the city below the poverty line (defined as 60% of the mean income). Conversely, an Aberdeen postcode has the second highest number of millionaires of any postcode in the UK.

<a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> is the main religion practised in the city. Aberdeen's largest denominations are the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> (through the <a href="Presbytery%20of%20Aberdeen">Presbytery of Aberdeen</a>) and the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, both with numerous churches across the city, with the <a href="Scottish%20Episcopal%20Church">Scottish Episcopal Church</a> having the third-largest number. The most recent census in 2001 showed that Aberdeen has the highest proportion of non-religious residents of any city in Scotland, with nearly 43% of citizens claiming to have no religion and several former churches in the city have been converted into bars and restaurants. In the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the <a href="Kirk%20of%20St%20Nicholas%2C%20Aberdeen">Kirk of St Nicholas</a> was the only burgh kirk and one of Scotland's largest parish churches. Like a number of other Scottish kirks, it was subdivided after the <a href="Scottish%20Reformation">Reformation</a>, in this case into the East and West churches. At this time, the city also was home to houses of the <a href="Carmelites">Carmelites</a> (Whitefriars) and <a href="Franciscans">Franciscans</a> (Greyfriars), the latter of which surviving in modified form as the chapel of Marischal College as late as the early 20th century.

<a href="St%20Machar%27s%20Cathedral">St Machar's Cathedral</a> was built twenty years after <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">David I</a> (1124–53) transferred the pre-Reformation <a href="Diocese">Diocese</a> from Mortlach in <a href="Banffshire">Banffshire</a> to Old Aberdeen in 1137. With the exception of the episcopate of <a href="William%20Elphinstone">William Elphinstone</a> (1484–1511), building progressed slowly. <a href="Gavin%20Dunbar%20%28Bishop%20of%20Aberdeen%29">Gavin Dunbar</a>, who followed him in 1518, completed the structure by adding the two western spires and the southern transept. It is now a congregation of the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a>. Aberdeen has two other cathedrals: <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Aberdeen">St. Mary's Cathedral</a> is a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> cathedral in <a href="Gothic%20style">Gothic style</a>, erected in 1859. In addition, <a href="St.%20Andrew%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Aberdeen">St. Andrew's Cathedral</a> serves the <a href="Scottish%20Episcopal%20Church">Scottish Episcopal Church</a>. It was constructed in 1817 as <a href="Archibald%20Simpson">Archibald Simpson</a>'s first commission and contains a memorial to the consecration of the first bishop of the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America">Episcopal Church in the United States of America</a>, which took place nearby. In 1804, <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20Church%2C%20Aberdeen">St Peter's Church</a>, the first permanent Roman Catholic church in the city after the Reformation was built.

Numerous other Protestant denominations have a presence in Aberdeen. <a href="The%20Salvation%20Army">The Salvation Army</a> citadel on the Castlegate dominates the view of east end of Union Street. In addition, there is a <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> church, established in 1833 and located in Skene Terrace. <a href="Christadelphians">Christadelphians</a> have been present in Aberdeen since at least 1844. Over the years, they have rented space to meet at a number of locations and currently meet in the Inchgarth Community Centre in Garthdee. There is also a <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a> meetinghouse on Crown street, the only purpose built <a href="Quaker%20House">Quaker House</a> in Scotland that is still in use today. In addition, there are a number of Baptist congregations in the city, and <a href="Evangelical">Evangelical</a> congregations have been appearing in significant numbers since the late 2000s. The city also has two meetinghouses of <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (LDS Church).

There is also a <a href="Aberdeen%20Mosque%20and%20Islamic%20Centre">mosque</a> in Old Aberdeen which serves the Islamic community in the city, and an <a href="Aberdeen%20Synagogue">Orthodox Jewish Synagogue</a> established in 1945. There is also a <a href="Thailand">Thai</a> <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> temple located in the Hazelhead area of the city.There are no formal <a href="Hinduism">Hindu</a> buildings, although the <a href="University%20of%20Aberdeen">University of Aberdeen</a> has a small <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Bahá'í</a> society and there is a fortnightly Hindu religious gathering in the 1st and 3rd Sunday afternoons at Queens Cross Parish church hall.

Traditionally, Aberdeen was home to fishing, textile mills, shipbuilding and paper making. These industries have been largely replaced. High technology developments in the electronics design and development industry, research in agriculture and fishing and the <a href="oil%20industry">oil industry</a>, which has been largely responsible for Aberdeen's economic boom in the last three decades, are now major parts of Aberdeen's economy.
Until the 1970s, most of Aberdeen's leading industries dated from the 18th century; mainly these were textiles, foundry work, shipbuilding and paper-making, the oldest industry in the city, with paper having been first made there in 1694. Paper-making has reduced in importance since the closures of Donside Paper Mill in 2001 and the Davidson Mill in 2005 leaving the <a href="Paper%20mills%20of%20Aberdeen">Stoneywood Paper Mill</a> with a workforce of approximately 500. Textile production ended in 2004 when <a href="Richards%20of%20Aberdeen">Richards of Aberdeen</a> closed.

Grey granite was <a href="quarry">quarried</a> at <a href="Rubislaw%20quarry">Rubislaw quarry</a> for more than 300 years, and used for paving setts, kerb and building stones, and monumental and other ornamental pieces. Aberdeen granite was used to build the terraces of the <a href="Houses%20of%20Parliament">Houses of Parliament</a> and <a href="Waterloo%20Bridge">Waterloo Bridge</a> in London. Quarrying finally ceased in 1971. The current owners have begun pumping 40 years of rain water from the quarry with the aim of developing a heritage centre on the site.

Fishing was once the predominant industry, but was surpassed by deep-sea fisheries, which derived a great impetus from improved technologies throughout the 20th century. Catches have fallen because of overfishing and the use of the harbour by oil support vessels, and so although still an important fishing port it is now eclipsed by the more northerly ports of <a href="Peterhead">Peterhead</a> and Fraserburgh. The <a href="Fisheries%20Research%20Services">Fisheries Research Services</a> are headquartered in Aberdeen, and there is a marine research lab in Torry.

Aberdeen is well regarded for the agricultural and soil research carried out at <a href="The%20James%20Hutton%20Institute">The James Hutton Institute</a> (formerly the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute), which has close links to the city's two universities. The <a href="Rowett%20Research%20Institute">Rowett Research Institute</a> is a world-renowned research centre for studies into food and nutrition located in Aberdeen. It has produced three Nobel laureates and there is a high concentration of <a href="life%20scientists">life scientists</a> working in the city.

As oil reserves in the North Sea decrease there is an effort to rebrand Aberdeen as "Energy Capital of Europe" rather than "Oil Capital of Europe", and there is interest in the development of new energy sources; and technology transfer from oil into renewable energy and other industries is under way. The "Energetica" initiative led by Scottish Enterprise has been designed to accelerate this process. As of 2013, Aberdeen remained a major world center for undersea petroleum technology.

Aberdeen had been a major maritime centre throughout the 19th century, when a group of local entrepreneurs launched the first steam-powered trawler. The steam trawling industry expanded and by 1933 Aberdeen was Scotland's top fishing port, employing nearly 3,000 men with 300 vessels sailing from its harbour. By the time oil was coming on stream, much of the trawling fleet had relocated to <a href="Peterhead">Peterhead</a>. Although Aberdeen still brings in substantial catches, the tugs, safety vessels and supply ships which pack the harbour far outnumber the trawlers.

Geologists had speculated about the existence of oil and gas in the North Sea since the middle of the 20th century, but tapping its deep and inhospitable waters was another story. With the Middle Eastern oil sheiks becoming more aware of the political and economic power of their oil reserves and government threats of rationing, the industry began to consider the North Sea as a viable source of oil. Exploration commenced in the 1960s and the first major find in the British sector was in November 1970 in the Forties field, east of Aberdeen.

By late 1975, after years of intense construction the necessary infrastructure was in place. In Aberdeen, at BP's (British Petroleum) headquarters, the Queen pressed the button that would set the whole thing moving. Oil flowed from the rig directly to the refinery at far-away Grangemouth. While many ports have suffered decline, Aberdeen remains busy because of the oil trade and the influx of people connected with the industry, a subsequent rise in property prices have brought prosperity to the area.

The industry supports about 47,000 jobs locally, and known reserves ensure that oil will continue to flow well into the 21st century.

As a major port in the UK, Aberdeen receives many ships calling at the port. Seafarers' welfare organisation, <a href="Apostleship%20of%20the%20Sea">Apostleship of the Sea</a> has a <a href="http%3A//www.apostleshipofthesea.org.uk/contact-our-chaplains">port chaplain</a> in Aberdeen to offer practical and pastoral support to them.

In 2011, the Centre for Cities named Aberdeen as the best placed city for growth in Britain, as the country looked to emerge from the recent economic downturn. With energy still providing the backbone of the local economy, recent years have seen very large new investment in the North Sea owing to rising oil prices and favourable government tax incentives. This has led to several oil majors and independents building new global offices in the city.

Aberdeen City and Shire's Gross Domestic Product is estimated at over £11.4billion, accounting for over 17% of the overall Scottish GDP. Five of Scotland's top ten businesses are based in Aberdeen with a collective turnover of £14billion, yielding a profit in excess of £2.4billion. Alongside this 29 of Scotland's top 100 businesses are located in Aberdeen with an employment rate of 77.9%, making it the 2nd highest UK city for employment.

Figures released in 2016 ranked Aberdeen as having the second highest amount of patents processed per person in the UK.

The city ranks third in Scotland for shopping. The traditional shopping streets are <a href="Union%20Street%2C%20Aberdeen">Union Street</a> and <a href="George%20Street%2C%20Aberdeen">George Street</a>, now complemented by shopping centres, notably the <a href="Bon%20Accord%20%26amp%3B%20St%20Nicholas">Bon Accord & St Nicholas</a> and the <a href="Trinity%20Shopping%20Centre">Trinity Shopping Centre</a>. A new retail <a href="http%3A//www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/acci/web/site/CouncilNews/pr/pr_hammer_280706.asp">£190 million</a> development, <a href="Union%20Square%20Aberdeen">Union Square</a>, reached completion in late September/early October 2009. Major <a href="retail%20park">retail park</a>s away from the city centre include the Berryden Retail Park, the Kittybrewster Retail Park and the Beach Boulevard Retail Park.

In March 2004, Aberdeen was awarded <a href="Fairtrade%20City">Fairtrade City</a> status by the <a href="Fairtrade%20Foundation">Fairtrade Foundation</a>. Along with Dundee, it shares the distinction of being the first city in Scotland to receive this accolade.

Aberdeen's <a href="architecture">architecture</a> is known for its principal use during the Victorian era of <a href="granite">granite</a>, which has led to its local <a href="nickname">nickname</a> of the "Granite City" or more romantically the less commonly used name the "Silver City", since the <a href="Mica">Mica</a> in the stone sparkles in the sun. The hard grey stone is one of the most durable materials available and helps to explain why the city's buildings look brand-new when they have been newly cleaned and the cement has been pointed. Unlike other Scottish cities where <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> has been used, the buildings are not weathering and need very little structural maintenance on their masonry. The buildings can however become noticeably darker as a result of pollution and grime accumulated over the years. There has however been great success in cleaning the buildings which can result in their façade being restored back to much how they looked originally.

Amongst the notable buildings in the city's main street, <a href="Union%20Street%2C%20Aberdeen">Union Street</a>, are the Town and County Bank, <a href="The%20Music%20Hall%20%28Aberdeen%29">the Music Hall</a>, the <a href="Seven%20Incorporated%20Trades%20of%20Aberdeen">Trinity Hall of the incorporated trades</a> (originating between 1398 and 1527, although completely rebuilt in the 1860s), now a shopping mall; the former office of the Northern Assurance Company, and the <a href="National%20Bank%20of%20Scotland">National Bank of Scotland</a>. In Castle Street, a continuation eastwards of Union Street, is the new Town House, a very prominent landmark in Aberdeen, built between 1868 and 1873 to a design by Peddie and Kinnear.

<a href="Alexander%20Marshall%20Mackenzie">Alexander Marshall Mackenzie</a>'s extension to <a href="Marischal%20College">Marischal College</a> on Broad Street, opened by King <a href="Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Edward VII</a> in 1906, created the second largest granite building in the world (after the <a href="Escorial">Escorial</a>, <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>).

In addition to the many fine landmark buildings, Aberdeen has many prominent public statues, three of the most notable being <a href="William%20Wallace">William Wallace</a> at the junction between Union Terrace and Rosemount Viaduct, <a href="Robert%20Burns">Robert Burns</a> on Union Terrace above <a href="Union%20Terrace%20Gardens">Union Terrace Gardens</a>, and Robert the Bruce holding aloft the charter he issued to the city in 1319 on Broad Street, outside <a href="Marischal%20College">Marischal College</a>.

Aberdeen has long been famous for its 45 <a href="park">park</a>s and <a href="garden">garden</a>s, and citywide floral displays which include two million roses, eleven million daffodils and three million crocuses. The city has won the <a href="Royal%20Horticultural%20Society">Royal Horticultural Society</a>'s <a href="Britain%20in%20Bloom">Britain in Bloom</a> 'Best City' award ten times, the overall Scotland in Bloom competition twenty times and the large city category every year since 1968. However, despite recent spurious reports, Aberdeen has never been banned from the Britain in Bloom competition. The city won the 2006 Scotland in Bloom "Best City" award along with the International Cities in Bloom award. The suburb of Dyce also won the Small Towns award.

<a href="Duthie%20Park">Duthie Park</a> opened in 1899 on the north bank of the <a href="River%20Dee%2C%20Aberdeenshire">River Dee</a>. It was named after and given to the city by Miss Elizabeth Crombie Duthie of Ruthrieston in 1881. It has extensive gardens, a rose hill, boating pond, bandstand, and play area as well as Europe's second largest enclosed gardens the David Welch Winter Gardens. <a href="Hazlehead%20Park">Hazlehead Park</a>, is large and forested, located on the outskirts of the city, it is popular with walkers in the forests, sports enthusiasts, naturalists and picnickers. There are football pitches, two golf courses, a pitch and putt course and a horse riding school.

Aberdeen's success in the Britain in Bloom competitions is often attributed to <a href="Johnston%20Gardens">Johnston Gardens</a>, a small park of one hectare in the west end of the city containing many different flowers and plants which have been renowned for their beauty. In 2002, the garden was named the best garden in the <a href="British%20Islands">British Islands</a>. <a href="Seaton%20Park">Seaton Park</a>, formerly the grounds of a private house, is on the edge of the grounds of <a href="St%20Machar%27s%20Cathedral">St Machar's Cathedral</a>. The Cathedral Walk is maintained in a formal style with a great variety of plants providing a popular display. The park includes several other areas with contrasting styles to this. <a href="Union%20Terrace%20Gardens">Union Terrace Gardens</a> opened in 1879 and is situated in the centre of the city. It covers in the centre of Aberdeen bordered on three sides by Union Street, Union Terrace and Rosemount Viaduct. The park forms a natural amphitheatre located in the Denburn Valley and is an oasis of peace and calm in the city centre. A recent proposal to build a three-storey concrete and steel superstructure in place of the gardens, part of which will provide a commercial concourse, has proved highly controversial. 

Situated next to each other, <a href="Victoria%20Park%2C%20Aberdeen">Victoria Park</a> and <a href="Westburn%20Park">Westburn Park</a> cover between them. <a href="Victoria%20Park%2C%20Aberdeen">Victoria Park</a> opened in 1871. There is a conservatory used as a seating area and a fountain made of fourteen different granites, presented to the people by the granite polishers and master builders of Aberdeen. Opposite to the north is <a href="Westburn%20Park">Westburn Park</a> opened in 1901. With large grass pitches it is widely used for field sports. There is large tennis centre with indoor and outdoor courts, a children's cycle track, play area and a grass boules lawn.

Aberdeen has hosted several theatres throughout its history, some of which have subsequently been converted or destroyed. The most
famous include:

The main concert hall is the <a href="Music%20Hall%20Aberdeen">Music Hall</a> on Union Street, built in 1822.

<a href="Aberdeen%20Airport">Aberdeen Airport</a> (ABZ), at <a href="Dyce">Dyce</a> in the north of the city, serves domestic and international destinations including France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Ireland and Scandinavian countries. The heliport which serves the oil industry and rescue services is one of the world's busiest commercial heliports. <a href="Aberdeen%20railway%20station">Aberdeen railway station</a> is on the main UK rail network and <a href="Abellio%20ScotRail">Abellio ScotRail</a> has frequent direct trains to major cities such as <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> and <a href="Inverness">Inverness</a>. <a href="Virgin%20Trains%20East%20Coast">Virgin Trains East Coast</a> and the <a href="Caledonian%20Sleeper">Caledonian Sleeper</a> operate direct trains to London. The station is being updated to bring it into the modern age. In 2007 additions were made and a new ticket office was built in the building. The UK's longest direct rail journey runs from Aberdeen to <a href="Penzance%20railway%20station">Penzance</a>. It is operated by <a href="CrossCountry">CrossCountry</a>, leaving Aberdeen at 08:20 and taking 13 hours and 23 minutes.

Until 2007, a 1950s-style concrete bus station at Guild Street served out-of-the-city locations; it has since transferred to a new and well-presented bus station just 100 metres to the east off Market Street as part of the <a href="Union%20Square%20Aberdeen">Union Square</a> development. There are six major roads in and out of the city. The A90 is the main arterial route into the city from the north and south, linking Aberdeen to <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="Dundee">Dundee</a>, <a href="Brechin">Brechin</a> and <a href="Perth%2C%20Scotland">Perth</a> in the south and <a href="Ellon%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Ellon</a>, <a href="Peterhead">Peterhead</a> and <a href="Fraserburgh">Fraserburgh</a> in the north. The A96 links <a href="Elgin%2C%20Moray">Elgin</a> and <a href="Inverness">Inverness</a> and the north west. The A93 is the main route to the west, heading towards Royal Deeside and the <a href="Cairngorms">Cairngorms</a>. After <a href="Braemar">Braemar</a>, it turns south, providing an alternative tourist route to Perth. The A944 also heads west, through <a href="Westhill%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Westhill</a> and on to <a href="Alford%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Alford</a>.

After first being mooted some 60 years ago and being held up for the past five years by a number of legal challenges, Aberdeen's long-awaited Western Peripheral Route was given the go-ahead after campaigners lost their appeal to the UK Supreme Court in October 2012. The route is earmarked to be completed in 2018 and is hoped to significantly reduce traffic congestion in and around the city. Aberdeen Harbour is important as the largest in the north of Scotland and as a ferry route to <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a>. Established in 1136, it has been referred to as the oldest business in Britain.

<a href="FirstGroup">FirstGroup</a> operates the city buses under the name <a href="First%20Aberdeen">First Aberdeen</a>, as the successor of Grampian Regional Transport (GRT) and Aberdeen Corporation Tramways. Aberdeen is the global headquarters of FirstGroup plc, having grown from the <a href="GRT%20Group">GRT Group</a>. First is still based at the former Aberdeen Tramways depot on King Street, which has now been redeveloped into a new Global Headquarters and Aberdeen bus depot. <a href="Stagecoach%20East%20Scotland">Stagecoach East Scotland</a> also run buses in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, under the Stagecoach Bluebird brand. <a href="Megabus%20%28Europe%29">Megabus</a> run buses from the bus station to places north and south of the city.

In addition, there are <a href="Megabus%20%28Europe%29">Megabus</a> services to <a href="London">London</a> and <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> and <a href="Scottish%20Citylink">Scottish Citylink</a> services to Glasgow, operated by Stagecoach East Scotland and Parks of Hamilton using the Citylink gold and blue livery.

Aberdeen is connected to the UK <a href="National%20Cycle%20Network">National Cycle Network</a>, and has a track to the south connecting to cities such as Dundee and Edinburgh and one to the north that forks about from the city into two different tracks heading to Inverness and Fraserburgh respectively. Two popular footpaths along old railway tracks are the <a href="Deeside%20Way">Deeside Way</a> to <a href="Banchory">Banchory</a> (which will eventually connect to Ballater) and the <a href="Formartine%20and%20Buchan%20Way">Formartine and Buchan Way</a> to Ellon, both used by a mixture of cyclists, walkers and occasionally horses. Four park-and-ride sites serve the city: Stonehaven and Ellon (approx out from the city centre) and Kingswells and Bridge of Don (approx out).

The <a href="Dee%20Estuary%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Dee Estuary</a>, Aberdeen's harbour, has continually been improved. Starting out as a fishing port, moving onto steam trawlers, the oil industry, it is now a major port of departure for the <a href="Baltic%20region">Baltic</a> and <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>. Major exports include fertiliser, granite, and chemicals.

Aberdeen has two universities, the ancient "<a href="University%20of%20Aberdeen">University of Aberdeen</a>", and "<a href="Robert%20Gordon%20University">Robert Gordon University</a>", a modern university often referred to as RGU. Aberdeen's student rate of 11.5% is higher than the national average of 7%.

The <a href="University%20of%20Aberdeen">University of Aberdeen</a> began as <a href="King%27s%20College%2C%20Aberdeen">King's College, Aberdeen</a>, which was founded in 1495 by <a href="William%20Elphinstone">William Elphinstone</a> (1431–1514), <a href="Bishop%20of%20Aberdeen">Bishop of Aberdeen</a> and Chancellor of Scotland. <a href="Marischal%20College">Marischal College</a>, a separate institution, was founded in "New" Aberdeen by George Keith, fifth Earl Marischal of Scotland in 1593. These institutions were merged by order of Parliament in 1860 to form the University of Aberdeen. The university is the fifth oldest in the English-speaking world and offers degrees in a full range of disciplines. Its main campus is in Old Aberdeen in the north of the city and it currently has approximately 14,000 students. The university's debating society is the oldest in Scotland, founded in 1848 as the King's College Debating Society.

<a href="Robert%20Gordon%27s%20College">Robert Gordon's College</a> (originally Robert Gordon's Hospital) was founded in 1750 by the merchant <a href="Robert%20Gordon%20%28philanthropist%29">Robert Gordon</a>, grandson of the map maker Robert Gordon of Straloch, and was further endowed in 1816 by Alexander Simpson of Collyhill. Originally devoted to the instruction and maintenance of the sons of poor burgesses of guild and trade in the city, it was reorganised in 1881 as a day and night school for secondary and technical education. In 1903, the vocational education component of the college was designated a <a href="Central%20Institution">Central Institution</a> and was renamed as the Robert Gordon Institute of Technology in 1965. In 1992, university status was awarded and it became <a href="Robert%20Gordon%20University">Robert Gordon University</a>. The university has expanded and developed significantly in recent years, and was named Best Modern University in the UK for 2012 by "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>". It was previously "The Sunday Times" Scottish University of the Year for 2011, primarily because of its record on graduate employment. The citation for the 2011 award read: ""With a graduate unemployment rate that is lower than the most famous universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, plus a flourishing reputation for research, high student satisfaction rates and ambitious plans for its picturesque campus, the Robert Gordon University is The Sunday Times Scottish University of the Year"". RGU had two campuses: one in the city centre at Schoolhill/St. Andrew Street and a larger suburban campus at <a href="Garthdee">Garthdee</a> and currently has approximately 15,500 students. As of 2013, the Garthdee campus was expanded to include all schools, with the Schoolhill/St. Andrew Street campus being sold to Robert Gordon's College, and the building now functions as the school's Science and Technology Centre. The closure of the Schoolhill site includes the removal of the Student Union building, giving Aberdeen the dubious distinction of having two universities but no student bar.
Aberdeen is also home to two artistic schools: <a href="Gray%27s%20School%20of%20Art">Gray's School of Art</a>, founded in 1886, which is one of the oldest established colleges of art in the UK. <a href="The%20Scott%20Sutherland%20School%20of%20Architecture%20and%20Built%20Environment">The Scott Sutherland School of Architecture and the Built Environment</a>, was one of the first architectural schools to have its training courses recognised by the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">Royal Institute of British Architects</a>.

Antipope

An antipope () is a person who, in opposition to the one who is generally seen as the legitimately elected <a href="Pope">Pope</a>, makes a significantly accepted competing claim to be the Pope, the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Rome">Bishop of Rome</a> and leader of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>. At times between the 3rd and mid-15th century, antipopes were supported by a fairly significant faction of religious <a href="cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29">cardinals</a> and secular <a href="monarch">monarch</a>s and kingdoms. Persons who claim to be pope, but have few followers, such as the modern <a href="Sedevacantism">sedevacantist</a> antipopes, are not classified with the historical antipopes.

<a href="Hippolytus%20of%20Rome">Hippolytus of Rome</a> (d. 235) is commonly considered to be the earliest antipope, as he headed a separate group within the Church in Rome against <a href="Pope%20Callixtus%20I">Pope Callixtus I</a>. Hippolytus was reconciled to Callixtus's second successor, <a href="Pope%20Pontian">Pope Pontian</a>, and both he and Pontian are honoured as saints by the Roman Catholic Church with a shared <a href="feast%20day">feast day</a> on 13 August. Whether two or more persons have been confused in this account of Hippolytus and whether Hippolytus actually declared himself to be the Bishop of Rome, remains unclear, since no such claim by Hippolytus has been cited in the writings attributed to him.

<a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a> quotes from an unnamed earlier writer the story of Natalius, a <a href="Christianity%20in%20the%203rd%20century">3rd-century</a> priest who accepted the bishopric of the <a href="Adoptionism">Adoptionists</a>, a heretical group in Rome. Natalius soon repented and tearfully begged <a href="Pope%20Zephyrinus">Pope Zephyrinus</a> to receive him into communion.

<a href="Novatian">Novatian</a> (d. 258), another third-century figure, certainly claimed the See of Rome in opposition to <a href="Pope%20Cornelius">Pope Cornelius</a>, and if Natalius and Hippolytus were excluded because of the uncertainties concerning them, Novatian could then be said to be the first antipope.

The period in which antipopes were most numerous was during the struggles between the popes and the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>s of the 11th and 12th centuries. The emperors frequently imposed their own nominees to further their own causes. The popes, likewise, sometimes sponsored rival imperial claimants (<a href="anti-king">anti-king</a>s) in Germany to overcome a particular emperor.

The <a href="Western%20Schism">Western Schism</a> — which began in 1378, when the French cardinals, claiming that the election of <a href="Pope%20Urban%20VI">Pope Urban VI</a> was invalid, elected antipope <a href="Antipope%20Clement%20VII">Clement VII</a> as a rival to the Roman Pope — led eventually to two competing lines of antipopes: the <a href="Avignon%20Papacy">Avignon line</a> (Clement VII took up residence in <a href="Avignon">Avignon</a>, France), and the <a href="Council%20of%20Pisa">Pisan</a> line. The Pisan line was named after the town of Pisa, Italy, where the (Pisan) council had elected antipope <a href="Antipope%20Alexander%20V">Alexander V</a> as a third claimant. To end the schism, in May 1415, the <a href="Council%20of%20Constance">Council of Constance</a> deposed antipope <a href="Antipope%20John%20XXIII">John XXIII</a> of the Pisan line. <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20XII">Pope Gregory XII</a> of the Roman line resigned in July 1415. In 1417, the Council also formally deposed antipope <a href="Antipope%20Benedict%20XIII">Benedict XIII</a> of Avignon, but he refused to resign. Afterwards, <a href="Pope%20Martin%20V">Pope Martin V</a> was elected and was accepted everywhere except in the small and rapidly diminishing area that remained faithful to Benedict XIII. The scandal of the Western Schism created anti-papal sentiment and fed into the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> at the turn of the 16th century.

The following table gives the names of the antipopes included in the list of popes and antipopes in the "<a href="Annuario%20Pontificio">Annuario Pontificio</a>", with the addition of the names of Natalius (in spite of doubts about his historicity) and <a href="Antipope%20Clement%20VIII">Antipope Clement VIII</a> (whose following was insignificant).
An asterisk marks those who were included in the conventional numbering of later Popes who took the same name. More commonly, the antipope is ignored in later papal regnal numbers; for example, there was an <a href="Antipope%20John%20XXIII">Antipope John XXIII</a>, but the new Pope John elected in 1958 was also called <a href="Pope%20John%20XXIII">John XXIII</a>. For the additional confusion regarding Popes named John, see <a href="Pope%20John%20%28numbering%29">Pope John (numbering)</a>.

The list of popes and antipopes in the "Annuario Pontificio" attaches the following note to the name of <a href="Pope%20Leo%20VIII">Pope Leo VIII</a> (963–965):

At this point, as again in the mid-11th century, we come across <a href="Papal%20conclave">elections</a> in which problems of harmonising historical criteria and those of <a href="theology">theology</a> and <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a> make it impossible to decide clearly which side possessed the legitimacy whose factual existence guarantees the unbroken lawful succession of the successors of <a href="Saint%20Peter">Saint Peter</a>. The uncertainty that in some cases results has made it advisable to abandon the assignation of successive numbers in the list of the popes.
Thus, because of the obscurities about mid-11th-century canon law and the historical facts, the "Annuario Pontificio" lists <a href="Pope%20Sylvester%20III">Sylvester III</a> as a pope, without thereby expressing a judgement on his legitimacy. The "<a href="Catholic%20Encyclopedia">Catholic Encyclopedia</a>" places him in its "List of Popes", but with the annotation: "Considered by some to be an antipope". Other sources classify him as an antipope.

Those with asterisks (*) were counted in subsequent Papal numbering.

Many antipopes created cardinals, known as "quasi-cardinals", and a few created <a href="cardinal-nephew">cardinal-nephew</a>s, known as "quasi-cardinal-nephews".
In modern times various people claim to be pope and, though they do not fit the technical definition of "antipope", are sometimes referred to as such. They are usually leaders of <a href="sedevacantism">sedevacantist</a> groups who view the See of Rome as vacant and elect someone to fill it. They are sometimes referred to as <a href="conclavism">conclavists</a> because of their claim, on the basis of an election by a "conclave" of perhaps half a dozen laypeople, as in the case of <a href="David%20Bawden">David Bawden</a> ("Pope Michael I"), to have rendered the See no longer vacant. A significant number of these have taken the name "<a href="Pope%20Peter%20II">Peter II</a>", owing to its special significance. From the point of view of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, they are <a href="schism%20%28religion%29">schismatics</a>, and as such are <a href="Latae%20sententiae">automatically excommunicated</a>.



The Palmarian Catholic Church regards <a href="Pope%20Paul%20VI">Pope Paul VI</a>, whom they revere as a martyr, and his predecessors as true popes, but hold, on the grounds of claimed apparitions, that the Pope of Rome is excommunicated and that the position of the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a> has, since 1978, been transferred to the See of <a href="El%20Palmar%20de%20Troya">El Palmar de Troya</a>.

The following were elected by allegedly faithful Catholics, none of whom was a <a href="Cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29">cardinal</a>:

As the <a href="Patriarch%20of%20Alexandria">Patriarch of Alexandria</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, has historically also held the <a href="Pope%20of%20the%20Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Alexandria%23Episcopal%20title">title of Pope</a>, a person who, in opposition to someone who is generally accepted as a legitimate <a href="Pope%20of%20Alexandria">Pope of Alexandria</a>, claims to hold that position may also be considered an Antipope. In 2006, the defrocked <a href="marriage">married</a> <a href="Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Alexandria">Coptic</a> <a href="lector">lector</a> Max Michel became an Antipope of Alexandria, calling himself Maximos I. His claim to the Alexandrine Papacy was dismissed by both the <a href="Coptic%20Orthodox">Coptic Orthodox</a> <a href="Pope%20Shenouda%20III%20of%20Alexandria">Pope Shenouda III</a> and <a href="Patriarch%20Theodore%20II%20of%20Alexandria">Pope Theodore II</a> of the <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Alexandria">Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria</a>. The Coptic Pope of Alexandria and the Greek Pope of Alexandria currently view one another, not as Antipopes, but rather as successors to differing lines of <a href="apostolic%20succession">apostolic succession</a> that formed as a result of <a href="christology">christological</a> disputes in the fifth century.

Another Coptic (Alexandrian) Antipope is known to have laid claim in the Fourth Century. His name was <a href="Gregory%20of%20Cappadocia">Gregory of Cappadocia</a>.

Antipopes have appeared as fictional characters. These may be either in <a href="historical%20fiction">historical fiction</a>, as fictional portraits of well-known historical antipopes or as purely imaginary antipopes.

Aquaculture

Aquaculture (less commonly spelled aquiculture), also known as aquafarming, is the farming of <a href="fish">fish</a>, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s, <a href="aquatic%20plant">aquatic plants,</a> <a href="algae">algae</a>, and other aquatic organisms. Aquaculture involves cultivating freshwater and saltwater populations under controlled conditions, and can be contrasted with <a href="commercial%20fishing">commercial fishing</a>, which is the harvesting of <a href="wild%20fish">wild fish</a>. <a href="Mariculture">Mariculture</a> refers to aquaculture practiced in marine environments and in underwater habitats.

According to the <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)</a>, aquaculture "is understood to mean the farming of aquatic organisms including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants. Farming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated." The reported output from global aquaculture operations in 2014 supplied over one half of the fish and shellfish that is directly consumed by humans; however, there are issues about the reliability of the reported figures. Further, in current aquaculture practice, products from several pounds of wild fish are used to produce one pound of a <a href="piscivorous">piscivorous</a> fish like <a href="Aquaculture%20of%20salmon">salmon</a>.

Particular kinds of aquaculture include <a href="fish%20farming">fish farming</a>, <a href="shrimp%20farm">shrimp farm</a>ing, <a href="oyster%20farming">oyster farming</a>, <a href="mariculture">mariculture</a>, <a href="algaculture">algaculture</a> (such as <a href="seaweed%20farming">seaweed farming</a>), and the cultivation of <a href="ornamental%20fish">ornamental fish</a>. Particular methods include <a href="aquaponics">aquaponics</a> and <a href="integrated%20multi-trophic%20aquaculture">integrated multi-trophic aquaculture</a>, both of which integrate fish farming and plant farming.
The indigenous <a href="Gunditjmara">Gunditjmara</a> people in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, may have raised eels as early as 6000 BC. Evidence indicates they developed about of volcanic <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>s in the vicinity of <a href="Lake%20Condah">Lake Condah</a> into a complex of channels and dams, and used woven <a href="Fishing%20trap">traps</a> to capture <a href="eel">eel</a>s, and preserve them to eat all year round.

Aquaculture was operating in China "circa" 2500 BC. When the waters subsided after river floods, some fish, mainly carp, were trapped in lakes. Early aquaculturists fed their brood using <a href="nymph%20%28biology%29">nymphs</a> and <a href="silkworm">silkworm</a> feces, and ate them. A fortunate genetic mutation of <a href="Common%20carp">carp</a> led to the emergence of <a href="goldfish">goldfish</a> during the <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a>.

Japanese cultivated <a href="seaweed">seaweed</a> by providing <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a> poles and, later, nets and <a href="oyster">oyster</a> shells to serve as anchoring surfaces for <a href="spore">spore</a>s.

<a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> bred fish in ponds and farmed oysters in coastal lagoons before 100 CE.

In central Europe, early Christian <a href="monastery">monasteries</a> adopted Roman aquacultural practices. Aquaculture spread in Europe during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> since away from the seacoasts and the big rivers, fish had to be salted so they did not rot. Improvements in transportation during the 19th century made fresh fish easily available and inexpensive, even in inland areas, making aquaculture less popular. The 15th-century fishponds of the <a href="T%C5%99ebo%C5%88">Trebon Basin</a> in the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a> are maintained as a <a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20Site">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>.

Hawaiians constructed <a href="Hawaiian%20aquaculture">oceanic fish ponds</a>. A remarkable example is a fish pond dating from at least 1,000 years ago, at Alekoko. Legend says that it was constructed by the mythical <a href="Menehune">Menehune</a> dwarf people.

In first half of 18th century, German experimented with <a href="external%20fertilization">external fertilization</a> of <a href="brown%20trout">brown trout</a>s and <a href="salmon">salmon</a>. He wrote an article ""Von der künstlichen Erzeugung der Forellen und Lachse"." By the latter decades of the 18th century, oyster farming had begun in estuaries along the Atlantic Coast of North America.

The word aquaculture appeared in an 1855 newspaper article in reference to the harvesting of ice. It also appeared in descriptions of the terrestrial agricultural practise of subirrigation in the late 19th century before becoming associated primarily with the cultivation of aquatic plant and animal species.

In 1859, Stephen Ainsworth of <a href="West%20Bloomfield%2C%20New%20York">West Bloomfield, New York</a>, began experiments with <a href="brook%20trout">brook trout</a>. By 1864, Seth Green had established a commercial fish-hatching operation at Caledonia Springs, near <a href="Rochester%2C%20New%20York">Rochester, New York</a>. By 1866, with the involvement of Dr. W. W. Fletcher of <a href="Concord%2C%20Massachusetts">Concord, Massachusetts</a>, artificial fish hatcheries were under way in both Canada and the United States. When the <a href="Dildo%20Island">Dildo Island</a> fish hatchery opened in Newfoundland in 1889, it was the largest and most advanced in the world. The word aquaculture was used in descriptions of the hatcheries experiments with cod and lobster in 1890.

By the 1920s, the American Fish Culture Company of <a href="Carolina%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Carolina, Rhode Island</a>, founded in the 1870s was one of the leading producers of trout. During the 1940s, they had perfected the method of manipulating the day and night cycle of fish so that they could be artificially spawned year around.

Californians harvested wild <a href="kelp">kelp</a> and attempted to manage supply around 1900, later labeling it a wartime resource.

Harvest stagnation in <a href="wild%20fisheries">wild fisheries</a> and <a href="overexploitation">overexploitation</a> of popular marine species, combined with a growing demand for high-quality protein, encouraged aquaculturists to domesticate other marine species. At the outset of modern aquaculture, many were optimistic that a "Blue Revolution" could take place in aquaculture, just as the <a href="Green%20Revolution">Green Revolution</a> of the 20th century had revolutionized agriculture. Although land animals had long been domesticated, most seafood species were still caught from the wild. Concerned about the impact of growing demand for seafood on the world's oceans, prominent ocean explorer <a href="Jacques%20Cousteau">Jacques Cousteau</a> wrote in 1973: "With earth’s burgeoning human populations to feed, we must turn to the sea with new understanding and new technology.”

About 430 (97%) of the species cultured as of 2007 were domesticated during the 20th and 21st centuries, of which an estimated 106 came in the decade to 2007. Given the long-term importance of agriculture, to date, only 0.08% of known land plant species and 0.0002% of known land animal species have been domesticated, compared with 0.17% of known marine plant species and 0.13% of known marine animal species. Domestication typically involves about a decade of scientific research. Domesticating aquatic species involves fewer risks to humans than do land animals, which took a large toll in human lives. Most major human diseases originated in domesticated animals, including diseases such as <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> and <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a>, that like most infectious diseases, move to humans from animals. No human <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s of comparable virulence have yet emerged from marine species. 

Biological control methods to manage parasites are already being used, such as cleaner fish (e.g. lumpsuckers and wrasse) to control sea lice populations in salmon farming. Models are being used to help with spatial planning and siting of fish farms in order to minimize impact.

The decline in wild fish stocks has increased the demand for farmed fish. However, finding alternative sources of protein and oil for fish feed is necessary so the aquaculture industry can grow sustainably; otherwise, it represents a great risk for the over-exploitation of forage fish.

Another recent issue following the banning in 2008 of organotins by the International Maritime Organization is the need to find environmentally friendly, but still effective, compounds with antifouling effects.

Many new natural compounds are discovered every year, but producing them on a large enough scale for commercial purposes is almost impossible.

It is highly probable that future developments in this field will rely on microorganisms, but greater funding and further research is needed to overcome the lack of knowledge in this field.

<a href="Microalgae">Microalgae</a>, also referred to as <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a>, <a href="microphytes">microphytes</a>, or <a href="planktonic%20algae">planktonic algae</a>, constitute the majority of cultivated <a href="algae">algae</a>. Macroalgae commonly known as <a href="seaweed">seaweed</a> also have many commercial and industrial uses, but due to their size and specific requirements, they are not easily cultivated on a large scale and are most often taken in the wild.

The farming of fish is the most common form of aquaculture. It involves raising fish commercially in tanks, <a href="fish%20pond">fish pond</a>s, or ocean enclosures, usually for food. A facility that releases juvenile fish into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species' natural numbers is generally referred to as a fish <a href="hatchery">hatchery</a>. Worldwide, the most important fish species used in fish farming are, in order, <a href="carp">carp</a>, <a href="salmon">salmon</a>, <a href="tilapia">tilapia</a>, and <a href="catfish">catfish</a>.

In the Mediterranean, young <a href="Atlantic%20bluefin%20tuna">bluefin tuna</a> are netted at sea and towed slowly towards the shore. They are then interned in <a href="Offshore%20aquaculture">offshore</a> pens where they are further grown for the market. In 2009, researchers in Australia managed for the first time to coax <a href="southern%20bluefin%20tuna">southern bluefin tuna</a> to breed in landlocked tanks. Southern bluefin tuna are also caught in the wild and fattened in grow-out sea cages in southern <a href="Spencer%20Gulf">Spencer Gulf</a>, <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>.

A similar process is used in the salmon-farming section of this industry; juveniles are taken from hatcheries and a variety of methods are used to aid them in their maturation. For example, as stated above, some of the most important fish species in the industry, salmon, can be grown using a cage system. This is done by having netted cages, preferably in open water that has a strong flow, and feeding the salmon a special food mixture that aids their growth. This process allows for year-round growth of the fish, thus a higher harvest during the correct seasons. An additional method, known sometimes as sea ranching, has also been used within the industry. Sea ranching involves raising fish in a <a href="hatchery">hatchery</a> for a brief time and then releasing them into marine waters for further development, whereupon the fish are recaptured when they have matured.

Commercial <a href="shrimp">shrimp</a> farming began in the 1970s, and production grew steeply thereafter. Global production reached more than 1.6 million tonnes in 2003, worth about <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>9 billion. About 75% of farmed shrimp is produced in Asia, in particular in China and Thailand. The other 25% is produced mainly in Latin America, where Brazil is the largest producer. Thailand is the largest exporter.

Shrimp farming has changed from its traditional, small-scale form in Southeast Asia into a global industry. Technological advances have led to ever higher densities per unit area, and <a href="broodstock">broodstock</a> is shipped worldwide. Virtually all farmed shrimp are <a href="penaeid">penaeid</a>s (i.e., shrimp of the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Penaeidae">Penaeidae</a>), and just two species of shrimp, the <a href="Whiteleg%20shrimp">Pacific white shrimp</a> and the <a href="giant%20tiger%20prawn">giant tiger prawn</a>, account for about 80% of all farmed shrimp. These industrial <a href="monoculture">monoculture</a>s are very susceptible to disease, which has decimated shrimp populations across entire regions. Increasing <a href="ecology">ecological</a> problems, repeated disease outbreaks, and pressure and criticism from both <a href="nongovernmental%20organization">nongovernmental organization</a>s and consumer countries led to changes in the industry in the late 1990s and generally stronger regulations. In 1999, governments, industry representatives, and environmental organizations initiated a program aimed at developing and promoting more <a href="sustainable%20agriculture">sustainable farming</a> practices through the <a href="Seafood%20Watch">Seafood Watch</a> program.

<a href="Freshwater%20prawn%20farm">Freshwater prawn farm</a>ing shares many characteristics with, including many problems with, marine shrimp farming. Unique problems are introduced by the developmental lifecycle of the main species, the <a href="giant%20river%20prawn">giant river prawn</a>.

The global annual production of freshwater prawns (excluding <a href="crayfish">crayfish</a> and <a href="crab">crab</a>s) in 2003 was about 280,000 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s, of which China produced 180,000 tonnes followed by India and Thailand with 35,000 tonnes each. Additionally, China produced about 370,000 tonnes of <a href="Chinese%20river%20crab">Chinese river crab</a>.

Aquacultured shellfish include various <a href="oyster">oyster</a>, <a href="mussel">mussel</a>, and clam species. These bivalves are filter and/or deposit feeders, which rely on ambient primary production rather than inputs of fish or other feed. As such, shellfish aquaculture is generally perceived as benign or even beneficial.

Depending on the species and local conditions, bivalve molluscs are either grown on the beach, on longlines, or suspended from rafts and harvested by hand or by dredging. In May 2017 a Belgian consortium installed the first of two trial mussel farms on a wind farm in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>.

<a href="Abalone">Abalone</a> farming began in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Japan and China. Since the mid-1990s, this industry has become increasingly successful. Overfishing and <a href="poaching">poaching</a> have reduced wild populations to the extent that farmed abalone now supplies most abalone meat. Sustainably farmed molluscs can be certified by Seafood Watch and other organizations, including the <a href="World%20Wildlife%20Fund">World Wildlife Fund</a> (WWF). WWF initiated the "Aquaculture Dialogues" in 2004 to develop measurable and performance-based standards for responsibly farmed seafood. In 2009, WWF co-founded the <a href="Aquaculture%20Stewardship%20Council">Aquaculture Stewardship Council</a> with the Dutch Sustainable Trade Initiative to manage the global standards and certification programs.

After trials in 2012, a commercial "sea ranch" was set up in <a href="Flinders%20Bay">Flinders Bay</a>, Western Australia, to raise abalone. The ranch is based on an artificial reef made up of 5000 () separate concrete units called "abitats" (abalone habitats). The 900 kg abitats can host 400 abalone each. The reef is seeded with young abalone from an onshore hatchery. The abalone feed on seaweed that has grown naturally on the abitats, with the ecosystem enrichment of the bay also resulting in growing numbers of dhufish, pink snapper, wrasse, and Samson fish, among other species.

Brad Adams, from the company, has emphasised the similarity to wild abalone and the difference from shore-based aquaculture. "We're not aquaculture, we're ranching, because once they're in the water they look after themselves."

Other groups include aquatic reptiles, amphibians, and miscellaneous invertebrates, such as <a href="echinoderm">echinoderm</a>s and <a href="jellyfish">jellyfish</a>. They are separately graphed at the top right of this section, since they do not contribute enough volume to show clearly on the main graph.

Commercially harvested echinoderms include <a href="sea%20cucumber">sea cucumber</a>s and <a href="sea%20urchin">sea urchin</a>s. In China, sea cucumbers are farmed in artificial ponds as large as .

Kolmogorov complexity

In <a href="algorithmic%20information%20theory">algorithmic information theory</a> (a subfield of <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a> and <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>), the Kolmogorov complexity of an object, such as a piece of text, is the length of the shortest <a href="computer%20program">computer program</a> (in a predetermined <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a>) that produces the object as output.
It is a measure of the <a href="computation">computation</a>al resources needed to specify the object, and is also known as descriptive complexity, Kolmogorov–<a href="Gregory%20Chaitin">Chaitin</a> complexity, algorithmic entropy, or program-size complexity. It is named after <a href="Andrey%20Kolmogorov">Andrey Kolmogorov</a>, who first published on the subject in 1963.

The notion of Kolmogorov complexity can be used to state and <a href="Proof%20of%20impossibility">prove impossibility</a> results akin to <a href="Cantor%27s%20diagonal%20argument">Cantor's diagonal argument</a>, <a href="G%C3%B6del%27s%20incompleteness%20theorem">Gödel's incompleteness theorem</a>, and <a href="halting%20problem">Turing's halting problem</a>.
In particular, for almost each object it is not possible to compute even a lower bound for its Kolmogorov complexity (<a href="%23Chaitin%27s%20incompleteness%20theorem">Chaitin 1964</a>), let alone its exact value.

Consider the following two <a href="string%20%28computer%20science%29">strings</a> of 32 lowercase letters and digits:

The first string has a short English-language description, namely "ab 16 times", which consists of 11 characters. The second one has no obvious simple description (using the same character set) other than writing down the string itself, which has 32 characters.

More formally, the <a href="complexity">complexity</a> of a string is the length of the shortest possible description of the string in some fixed <a href="Turing%20complete">universal</a> description language (the sensitivity of complexity relative to the choice of description language is discussed below). It can be shown that the Kolmogorov complexity of any string cannot be more than a few bytes larger than the length of the string itself. Strings like the "abab" example above, whose Kolmogorov complexity is small relative to the string's size, are not considered to be complex.

The Kolmogorov complexity can be defined for any mathematical object, but for simplicity the scope of this article is restricted to strings. We must first specify a description language for strings. Such a description language can be based on any computer programming language, such as <a href="Lisp%20programming%20language">Lisp</a>, <a href="Pascal%20%28programming%20language%29">Pascal</a>, or <a href="Java%20virtual%20machine">Java virtual machine</a> bytecode. If P is a program which outputs a string "x", then P is a description of "x". The length of the description is just the length of P as a character string, multiplied by the number of bits in a character (e.g. 7 for <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a>).

We could, alternatively, choose an encoding for <a href="Turing%20machine">Turing machine</a>s, where an "encoding" is a function which associates to each Turing Machine M a bitstring <M>. If M is a Turing Machine which, on input "w", outputs string "x", then the concatenated string <M> "w" is a description of "x". For theoretical analysis, this approach is more suited for constructing detailed formal proofs and is generally preferred in the research literature. In this article, an informal approach is discussed.

Any string "s" has at least one description, namely the program:

If a description of "s", "d"("s"), is of minimal length (i.e. it uses the fewest bits), it is called a minimal description of "s". Thus, the length of "d"("s") (i.e. the number of bits in the description) is the Kolmogorov complexity of "s", written "K"("s"). Symbolically,

The length of the shortest description will depend on the choice of description language; but the effect of changing languages is bounded (a result called the "invariance theorem").

There are some description languages which are optimal, in the following sense: given any description of an object in a description language, said description may be used in the optimal description language with a constant overhead. The constant depends only on the languages involved, not on the description of the object, nor the object being described.

Here is an example of an optimal description language. A description will have two parts:


In more technical terms, the first part of a description is a computer program, with the second part being the input to that computer program which produces the object as output.

The invariance theorem follows: Given any description language "L", the optimal description language is at least as efficient as "L", with some constant overhead.

Proof: Any description "D" in "L" can be converted into a description in the optimal language by first describing "L" as a computer program "P" (part 1), and then using the original description "D" as input to that program (part 2). The
total length of this new description "D′" is (approximately):

The length of "P" is a constant that doesn't depend on "D". So, there is at most a constant overhead, regardless of the object described. Therefore, the optimal language is universal <a href="up%20to">up to</a> this additive constant.

Theorem: If "K" and "K" are the complexity functions relative to <a href="Turing%20complete">Turing complete</a> description languages "L" and "L", then there is a constant "c" – which depends only on the languages "L" and "L" chosen – such that

Proof: By symmetry, it suffices to prove that there is some constant "c" such that for all strings "s"

Now, suppose there is a program in the language "L" which acts as an <a href="interpreter%20%28computing%29">interpreter</a> for "L":

where "p" is a program in "L". The interpreter is characterized by the following property:

Thus, if P is a program in "L" which is a minimal description of "s", then codice_1(P) returns the string "s". The length of this description of "s" is the sum of


This proves the desired upper bound.

<a href="Algorithmic%20information%20theory">Algorithmic information theory</a> is the area of computer science that studies Kolmogorov complexity and other complexity measures on strings (or other <a href="data%20structure">data structure</a>s).

The concept and theory of Kolmogorov Complexity is based on a crucial theorem first discovered by <a href="Ray%20Solomonoff">Ray Solomonoff</a>, who published it in 1960, describing it in "A Preliminary Report on a General Theory of Inductive Inference" as part of his invention of <a href="algorithmic%20probability">algorithmic probability</a>. He gave a more complete description in his 1964 publications, "A Formal Theory of Inductive Inference," Part 1 and Part 2 in "Information and Control".

Andrey Kolmogorov later <a href="multiple%20discovery">independently published</a> this theorem in "Problems Inform. Transmission" in 1965. Gregory Chaitin also presents this theorem in "J. ACM" – Chaitin's paper was submitted October 1966 and revised in December 1968, and cites both Solomonoff's and Kolmogorov's papers.

The theorem says that, among algorithms that decode strings from their descriptions (codes), there exists an optimal one. This algorithm, for all strings, allows codes as short as allowed by any other algorithm up to an additive constant that depends on the algorithms, but not on the strings themselves. Solomonoff used this algorithm, and the code lengths it allows, to define a "universal probability" of a string on which inductive inference of the subsequent digits of the string can be based. Kolmogorov used this theorem to define several functions of strings, including complexity, randomness, and information.

When Kolmogorov became aware of Solomonoff's work, he acknowledged Solomonoff's priority. For several years, Solomonoff's work was better known in the Soviet Union than in the Western World. The general consensus in the scientific community, however, was to associate this type of complexity with Kolmogorov, who was concerned with randomness of a sequence, while Algorithmic Probability became associated with Solomonoff, who focused on prediction using his invention of the universal prior probability distribution. The broader area encompassing descriptional complexity and probability is often called Kolmogorov complexity. The computer scientist Ming Li considers this an example of the <a href="Matthew%20effect%20%28sociology%29">Matthew effect</a>: "... to everyone who has more will be given ..."

There are several other variants of Kolmogorov complexity or algorithmic information. The most widely used one is based on <a href="self-delimiting%20program">self-delimiting program</a>s, and is mainly due to <a href="Leonid%20Levin">Leonid Levin</a> (1974).

An axiomatic approach to Kolmogorov complexity based on <a href="Blum%20axioms">Blum axioms</a> (Blum 1967) was introduced by Mark Burgin in the paper presented for publication by Andrey Kolmogorov (Burgin 1982).

In the following discussion, let "K"("s") be the complexity of the string "s".

It is not hard to see that the minimal description of a string cannot be too much larger than the string itself — the program codice_4 above that outputs "s" is a fixed amount larger than "s".

Theorem: There is a constant "c" such that

Theorem: There exist strings of arbitrarily large Kolmogorov complexity. Formally: for each "n" ∈ ℕ, there is a string "s" with "K"("s") ≥ "n".

Proof: Otherwise all of the infinitely many possible finite strings could be generated by the finitely many programs with a complexity below "n" bits.

Theorem: "K" is not a <a href="computable%20function">computable function</a>. In other words, there is no program which takes a string "s" as input and produces the integer "K"("s") as output.

The following <a href="indirect%20proof">indirect proof</a> uses a simple <a href="Pascal%20%28programming%20language%29">Pascal</a>-like language to denote programs; for sake of proof simplicity assume its description (i.e. an <a href="interpreter%20%28computing%29">interpreter</a>) to have a length of bits.
Assume for contradiction there is a program

which takes as input a string "s" and returns "K"("s"); for sake of proof simplicity, assume the program's length to be bits.
Now, consider the following program of length bits:

Using codice_5 as a subroutine, the program tries every string, starting with the shortest, until it returns a string with Kolmogorov complexity at least bits, i.e. a string that cannot be produced by any program shorter than bits. However, the overall length of the above program that produced "s" is only bits, which is a contradiction. (If the code of codice_5 is shorter, the contradiction remains. If it is longer, the constant used in codice_7 can always be changed appropriately.)

The above proof used a contradiction similar to that of the <a href="Berry%20paradox">Berry paradox</a>: "The smallest positive integer that cannot be defined in fewer than twenty English words". It is also possible to show the non-computability of "K" by reduction from the non-computability of the halting problem "H", since "K" and "H" are <a href="turing%20degree%23Turing%20equivalence">Turing-equivalent</a>.

There is a corollary, humorously called the "<a href="full%20employment%20theorem">full employment theorem</a>" in the programming language community, stating that there is no perfect size-optimizing compiler.

A naive attempt at a program for K

At first glance it might seem trivial to write a program which can compute "K"("s") for any "s" (thus disproving the above theorem), such as the following:

This program iterates through all possible programs (by iterating through all possible strings and only considering those which are valid programs), starting with the shortest. Each program is executed to find the result produced by that program, comparing it to the input "s". If the result matches the length of the program is returned.

However this will not work because some of the programs "p" tested will not terminate, e.g. if they contain infinite loops. There is no way to avoid all of these programs by testing them in some way before executing them due to the non-computability of the halting problem.

The chain rule for Kolmogorov complexity states that

It states that the shortest program that reproduces "X" and "Y" is <a href="Big-O%20notation">no more</a> than a logarithmic term larger than a program to reproduce "X" and a program to reproduce "Y" given "X". Using this statement, one can define <a href="Mutual%20information%23Absolute%20mutual%20information">an analogue of mutual information for Kolmogorov complexity</a>.

It is straightforward to compute upper bounds for "K"("s") – simply <a href="data%20compression">compress</a> the string "s" with some method, implement the corresponding decompressor in the chosen language, concatenate the decompressor to the compressed string, and measure the length of the resulting string – concretely, the size of a <a href="self-extracting%20archive">self-extracting archive</a> in the given language.

A string "s" is compressible by a number "c" if it has a description whose length does not exceed |"s"|−"c" bits. This is equivalent to saying that "K"("s") ≤ |"s"|-"c". Otherwise, "s" is incompressible by "c". A string incompressible by 1 is said to be simply "incompressible" – by the <a href="pigeonhole%20principle">pigeonhole principle</a>, which applies because every compressed string maps to only one uncompressed string, <a href="incompressible%20string">incompressible string</a>s must exist, since there are 2 bit strings of length "n", but only 2 - 1 shorter strings, that is, strings of length less than "n", (i.e. with length 0,1...,"n − 1).

For the same reason, most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be significantly compressed – their "K"("s") is not much smaller than |"s"|, the length of "s" in bits. To make this precise, fix a value of "n". There are 2 bitstrings of length "n". The <a href="Uniform%20distribution%20%28discrete%29">uniform</a> <a href="probability">probability</a> distribution on the space of these bitstrings assigns exactly equal weight 2 to each string of length "n".

Theorem: With the uniform probability distribution on the space of bitstrings of length "n", the probability that a string is incompressible by "c" is at least 1 - 2 + 2.

To prove the theorem, note that the number of descriptions of length not exceeding "n"-"c" is given by the geometric series:

There remain at least

bitstrings of length "n" that are incompressible by "c". To determine the probability, divide by 2.

We know that, in the set of all possible strings, most strings are complex in the sense that they cannot be described in any significantly "compressed" way. However, it turns out that the fact that a specific string is complex cannot be formally proven, if the complexity of the string is above a certain threshold. The precise formalization is as follows. First, fix a particular <a href="axiomatic%20system">axiomatic system</a> S for the <a href="natural%20number">natural number</a>s. The axiomatic system has to be powerful enough so that, to certain assertions A about complexity of strings, one can associate a formula F in S. This association must have the following property:

If F is provable from the axioms of S, then the corresponding assertion A must be true. This "formalization" can be achieved, either by an artificial encoding such as a <a href="G%C3%B6del%20numbering">Gödel numbering</a>, or by a formalization which more clearly respects the intended interpretation of S.

Theorem: There exists a constant "L" (which only depends on the particular axiomatic system and the choice of description language) such that there does not exist a string "s" for which the statement

can be proven within the axiomatic system S.

Note that, by the abundance of nearly incompressible strings, the vast majority of those statements must be true.

The proof of this result is modeled on a self-referential construction used in <a href="Berry%27s%20paradox">Berry's paradox</a>. The proof is by contradiction. If the theorem were false, then

We can find an effective enumeration of all the formal proofs in S by some procedure

which takes as input "n" and outputs some proof. This function enumerates all proofs. Some of these are proofs for formulas we do not care about here, since every possible proof in the language of S is produced for some "n". Some of these are complexity formulas of the form "K"("s") ≥ "n" where "s" and "n" are constants in the language of S. There is a program

which determines whether the "n"th proof actually proves a complexity formula "K"("s") ≥ "L". The strings "s", and the integer "L" in turn, are computable by programs:

Consider the following program

Given an "n", this program tries every proof until it finds a string and a proof in the <a href="formal%20system">formal system</a> S of the formula "K"("s") ≥ "L" for some "L" ≥ "n". The program terminates by our Assumption (X). Now, this program has a length "U". There is an integer "n" such that "U" + log("n") + "C" < "n", where "C" is the overhead cost of

(note that "n" is hard-coded into the above function, and the summand log("n") already allows for its encoding). The program GenerateProvablyParadoxicalString outputs a string "s" for which there exists an "L" such that "K"("s") ≥ "L" can be formally proved in S with "L" ≥ "n". In particular, "K"("s") ≥ "n" is true. However, "s" is also described by a program of length "U" + log("n") + "C", so its complexity is less than "n". This contradiction proves Assumption (X) cannot hold.

Similar ideas are used to prove the properties of <a href="Chaitin%27s%20constant">Chaitin's constant</a>.

The minimum message length principle of statistical and inductive inference and machine learning was developed by <a href="Chris%20Wallace%20%28computer%20scientist%29">C.S. Wallace</a> and D.M. Boulton in 1968. MML is <a href="Bayesian%20probability">Bayesian</a> (i.e. it incorporates prior beliefs) and information-theoretic. It has the desirable properties of statistical invariance (i.e. the inference transforms with a re-parametrisation, such as from polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates), statistical consistency (i.e. even for very hard problems, MML will converge to any underlying model) and efficiency (i.e. the MML model will converge to any true underlying model about as quickly as is possible). C.S. Wallace and D.L. Dowe (1999) showed a formal connection between MML and algorithmic information theory (or Kolmogorov complexity).

"Kolmogorov randomness" defines a string (usually of <a href="bit">bit</a>s) as being <a href="randomness">random</a> if and only if it is shorter than any <a href="computer%20program">computer program</a> that can produce that string. To make this precise, a <a href="Universal%20Turing%20machine">universal computer</a> (or universal Turing machine) must be specified, so that "program" means a program for this universal machine. A random string in this sense is "incompressible" in that it is impossible to "compress" the string into a program whose length is shorter than the length of the string itself. A <a href="counting%20argument">counting argument</a> is used to show that, for any universal computer, there is at least one algorithmically random string of each length. Whether any particular string is random, however, depends on the specific universal computer that is chosen.

This definition can be extended to define a notion of randomness for "infinite" sequences from a finite alphabet. These <a href="algorithmically%20random%20sequence">algorithmically random sequence</a>s can be defined in three equivalent ways. One way uses an effective analogue of <a href="measure%20theory">measure theory</a>; another uses effective <a href="Martingale%20%28probability%20theory%29">martingales</a>. The third way defines an infinite sequence to be random if the prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity of its initial segments grows quickly enough — there must be a constant "c" such that the complexity of an initial segment of length "n" is always at least "n"−"c". This definition, unlike the definition of randomness for a finite string, is not affected by which universal machine is used to define prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity.
For dynamical systems, entropy rate and algorithmic complexity of the trajectories are related by a theorem of Brudno, that the equality K(x;T) = h(T) holds for almost all x.

It can be shown that for the output of <a href="Markov%20information%20source">Markov information source</a>s, Kolmogorov complexity is related to the <a href="Entropy%20%28information%20theory%29">entropy</a> of the information source. More precisely, the Kolmogorov complexity of the output of a Markov information source, normalized by the length of the output, converges almost surely (as the length of the output goes to infinity) to the <a href="Entropy%20%28information%20theory%29">entropy</a> of the source.

The conditional Kolmogorov complexity of two strings formula_1 is, roughly speaking, defined as the Kolmogorov complexity of "x" given "y" as an auxiliary input to the procedure.

There is also a length-conditional complexity formula_2, which is the complexity of "x" given the length of "x" as known/input.

Alfred the Great

Alfred the Great (, "elf counsel" or "wise elf"; 849 – 26 October 899) was King of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> from 871 to 899.

Alfred successfully defended his kingdom against the <a href="Viking">Viking</a> attempt at conquest, and by the time of his death had become the dominant ruler in <a href="England">England</a>. He is one of only two English monarchs to be given the <a href="epithet">epithet</a> "the Great", the other being the Scandinavian <a href="Cnut%20the%20Great">Cnut the Great</a>. He was also the first <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Wessex">King of the West Saxons</a> to style himself "King of the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a>". Details of Alfred's life are described in a work by the <a href="9th%20century%20in%20England">9th-century</a> <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh</a> scholar and bishop <a href="Asser">Asser</a>.

Alfred had a reputation as a learned and merciful man of a gracious and level-headed nature who encouraged education, proposing that primary education be taught in <a href="Old%20English">English</a> rather than Latin, and improved his kingdom's <a href="law">legal</a> system, <a href="military">military</a> structure and his people's quality of life. In 2002 Alfred was ranked number 14 in the BBC's poll of the <a href="100%20Greatest%20Britons">100 Greatest Britons</a>.

Alfred was born in the village of Wanating, now <a href="Wantage">Wantage</a>, historically in <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a> but now in <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>. He was the youngest son of King <a href="%C3%86thelwulf%20of%20Wessex">Æthelwulf of Wessex</a> by his first wife, <a href="Osburh">Osburh</a>.

In 853, at the age of four, Alfred is reported by the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" to have been sent to Rome where he was <a href="confirmation">confirmed</a> by <a href="Pope%20Leo%20IV">Pope Leo IV</a>, who "anointed him as king". <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> writers later interpreted this as an anticipatory <a href="coronation">coronation</a> in preparation for his eventual succession to the throne of Wessex. This is unlikely; his succession could not have been foreseen at the time as Alfred had three living elder brothers. A letter of Leo IV shows that Alfred was made a "<a href="consul">consul</a>"; a misinterpretation of this investiture, deliberate or accidental, could explain later confusion. It may also be based on Alfred's later having accompanied his father on a pilgrimage to Rome where he spent some time at the court of <a href="Charles%20the%20Bald">Charles the Bald</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Frankish%20kings">King of the Franks</a>, around 854–855.

On their return from Rome in 856 Æthelwulf was deposed by his son <a href="%C3%86thelbald%20of%20Wessex">Æthelbald</a>. With civil war looming the <a href="magnate">magnate</a>s of the realm met in council to hammer out a compromise. Æthelbald would retain the western shires (i.e. historical Wessex), and Æthelwulf would rule in the east. When King Æthelwulf died in 858 Wessex was ruled by three of Alfred's brothers in succession: Æthelbald, <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Wessex">Æthelberht</a> and <a href="%C3%86thelred%20of%20Wessex">Æthelred</a>.

Bishop Asser tells the story of how as a child Alfred won as a prize a book of Saxon poems, offered by his mother to the first of her children able to memorize it. Legend also has it that the young Alfred spent time in Ireland seeking healing. Alfred was troubled by health problems throughout his life. It is thought that he may have suffered from <a href="Crohn%27s%20disease">Crohn's disease</a>. Statues of Alfred in Winchester and Wantage portray him as a great warrior. Evidence suggests he was not physically strong and, though not lacking in courage, he was noted more for his intellect than as a warlike character.

Alfred is not mentioned during the short reigns of his older brothers <a href="%C3%86thelbald%20of%20Wessex">Æthelbald of Wessex</a> and <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Wessex">Æthelberht of Wessex</a>. The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" describe the <a href="Great%20Heathen%20Army">Great Heathen Army</a>, an army of <a href="Danes%20%28Germanic%20tribe%29">Danes</a>, landing in East Anglia with the intent of conquering the four kingdoms that constituted Anglo-Saxon England in 865. Alfred's public life began at age 16 with the accession of his third brother, 18 year old King <a href="%C3%86thelred%20of%20Wessex">Æthelred of Wessex</a> in 865.

During this period, Bishop Asser applied to Alfred the unique title of "secundarius", which may indicate a position similar to the Celtic "<a href="Tanistry">tanist</a>", a recognised successor closely associated with the reigning monarch. This arrangement may have been sanctioned by Alfred's father or by the <a href="Witenagemot">Witan</a> to guard against the danger of a disputed succession should Æthelred fall in battle. It is well known among other <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic peoples</a> to crown a successor as royal prince and military commander, such as among the <a href="Swedes%20%28Germanic%20tribe%29">Swedes</a> and <a href="Franks">Franks</a>, to whom the Anglo-Saxons were closely related.

In 868, Alfred is recorded as fighting beside Æthelred in an unsuccessful attempt to keep the <a href="Great%20Heathen%20Army">Great Heathen Army</a> led by <a href="Ivar%20the%20Boneless">Ivar the Boneless</a> out of the adjoining <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Mercia">Kingdom of Mercia</a>. The Danes arrived in his homeland at the end of 870, and nine engagements were fought in the following year, with varying outcomes, though the places and dates of two of these battles have not been recorded.

A successful skirmish at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Englefield">Battle of Englefield</a> in Berkshire on 31 December 870 was followed by a severe defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Reading%20%28871%29">siege and Battle of Reading</a> by Ivar's brother <a href="Halfdan%20Ragnarsson">Halfdan Ragnarsson</a> on 5 January 871. Four days later, the Anglo-Saxons won a brilliant victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ashdown">Battle of Ashdown</a> on the <a href="North%20Wessex%20Downs%20AONB">Berkshire Downs</a>, possibly near <a href="Compton%2C%20Berkshire">Compton</a> or <a href="Aldworth">Aldworth</a>. Alfred is particularly credited with the success of last battle.

The Saxons were defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Basing">Battle of Basing</a> on 22 January. They were defeated again on 22 March at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Merton">Battle of Merton</a> (perhaps Marden in <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> or Martin in <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>). Æthelred died shortly afterwards on 23 April.

In April 871 King Æthelred died and Alfred succeeded to the throne of Wessex and the burden of its defence, even though Æthelred left two under-age sons, <a href="%C3%86thelhelm">Æthelhelm</a> and <a href="%C3%86thelwold%20of%20Wessex">Æthelwold</a>. This was in accordance with the agreement that Æthelred and Alfred had made earlier that year in an assembly at "Swinbeorg". The brothers had agreed that whichever of them outlived the other would inherit the personal property that King Æthelwulf had left jointly to his sons in his will. The deceased's sons would receive only whatever property and riches their father had settled upon them, and whatever additional lands their uncle had acquired. The unstated premise was that the surviving brother would be king. Given the ongoing Danish invasion, and the youth of his nephews, Alfred's accession probably went uncontested.

While he was busy with the burial ceremonies for his brother, the Danes defeated the Saxon army in his absence at an unnamed spot, and then again in his presence at <a href="Wilton%2C%20Wiltshire">Wilton</a> in May. The defeat at Wilton smashed any remaining hope that Alfred could drive the invaders from his kingdom. He was forced instead to make peace with them, according to sources that do not tell what the terms of the peace were. Bishop Asser claimed that the pagans agreed to vacate the realm and made good their promise.

Indeed, the Viking army did withdraw from Reading in the autumn of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London. Although not mentioned by Asser, or by the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", Alfred probably also paid the Vikings cash to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year. <a href="Hoard">Hoard</a>s dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/2 have been excavated at <a href="Croydon">Croydon</a>, <a href="Gravesend%2C%20Kent">Gravesend</a>, and <a href="Waterloo%20Bridge">Waterloo Bridge</a>. These finds hint at the cost involved in making peace with the Vikings. For the next five years the Danes occupied other parts of England.
In 876 under their new leader, <a href="Guthrum">Guthrum</a>, the Danes slipped past the Saxon army and attacked and occupied <a href="Wareham%2C%20Dorset">Wareham</a> in <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>. Alfred blockaded them but was unable to take Wareham by assault. Accordingly, he negotiated a peace which involved an exchange of hostages and oaths, which the Danes swore on a "holy ring" associated with the worship of <a href="Thor">Thor</a>. The Danes broke their word and, after killing all the hostages, slipped away under cover of night to <a href="Exeter%2C%20England">Exeter</a> in <a href="Devon">Devon</a>.

Alfred blockaded the Viking ships in Devon and, with a relief fleet having been scattered by a storm, the Danes were forced to submit. The Danes withdrew to Mercia. In January 878 the Danes made a sudden attack on <a href="Chippenham%2C%20Wiltshire">Chippenham</a>, a royal stronghold in which Alfred had been staying over Christmas, "and most of the people they killed, except the King Alfred, and he with a little band made his way by wood and swamp, and after Easter he made a fort at <a href="Athelney">Athelney</a> in the marshes of <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, and from that fort kept fighting against the foe." From his fort at <a href="Athelney">Athelney</a>, an island in the marshes near <a href="North%20Petherton">North Petherton</a>, Alfred was able to mount an effective resistance movement, rallying the local <a href="militia">militia</a>s from <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> and <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a>.

A legend, originating from 12th century chronicles, tells how when he first fled to the <a href="Somerset%20Levels">Somerset Levels</a>, Alfred was given shelter by a peasant woman who, unaware of his identity, left him to watch some wheaten cakes she had left cooking on the fire. Preoccupied with the problems of his kingdom Alfred accidentally let the cakes burn and was roundly scolded by the woman upon her return.

878 was the low-water mark in the history of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. With all the other kingdoms having fallen to the Vikings Wessex alone was still resisting.

In the seventh week after Easter (4–10 May 878), around <a href="Whitsuntide">Whitsuntide</a>, Alfred rode to <a href="Egbert%27s%20Stone">Egbert's Stone</a> east of <a href="Selwood%2C%20Somerset">Selwood</a> where he was met by "all the people of Somerset and of <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> and of that part of <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> which is on this side of the sea (that is, west of <a href="Southampton%20Water">Southampton Water</a>), and they rejoiced to see him". Alfred's emergence from his marshland stronghold was part of a carefully planned offensive that entailed raising the <a href="fyrd">fyrd</a>s of three <a href="shire">shire</a>s. This meant not only that the king had retained the loyalty of <a href="ealdormen">ealdormen</a>, royal <a href="High-reeve">reeves</a> and king's <a href="thegn">thegn</a>s, who were charged with levying and leading these forces, but that they had maintained their positions of authority in these localities well enough to answer his summons to war. Alfred's actions also suggest a system of scouts and messengers.

Alfred won a decisive victory in the ensuing <a href="Battle%20of%20Edington">Battle of Edington</a> which may have been fought near <a href="Westbury%2C%20Wiltshire">Westbury, Wiltshire</a>. He then pursued the Danes to their stronghold at <a href="Chippenham">Chippenham</a> and starved them into submission. One of the terms of the surrender was that Guthrum convert to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>. Three weeks later the Danish king and 29 of his chief men were baptised at Alfred's court at Aller, near <a href="Athelney">Athelney</a>, with Alfred receiving Guthrum as his spiritual son.

According to Asser:

The unbinding of the <a href="Chrisom">Chrisom</a> took place with great ceremony eight days later at the royal estate at <a href="Wedmore">Wedmore</a> 

While at Wedmore Alfred and Guthrum negotiated what some historians have called the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Wedmore">Treaty of Wedmore</a>, but it was to be some years after the cessation of hostilities that a formal treaty was signed. Under the terms of the so-called Treaty of Wedmore the converted Guthrum was required to leave Wessex and return to East Anglia. Consequently, in 879 the Viking army left Chippenham and made its way to Cirencester. The formal <a href="Treaty%20of%20Alfred%20and%20Guthrum">Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum</a>, preserved in <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> in <a href="Corpus%20Christi%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Corpus Christi College, Cambridge</a> (Manuscript 383), and in a <a href="Latin">Latin</a> compilation known as "<a href="Quadripartitus">Quadripartitus</a>", was negotiated later, perhaps in 879 or 880, when King <a href="Ceolwulf%20II%20of%20Mercia">Ceolwulf II of Mercia</a> was deposed.

That treaty divided up the kingdom of Mercia. By its terms the boundary between Alfred's and Guthrum's kingdoms was to run up the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> to the <a href="River%20Lea">River Lea</a>, follow the Lea to its source (near <a href="Luton">Luton</a>), from there extend in a straight line to <a href="Bedford">Bedford</a>, and from Bedford follow the <a href="River%20Great%20Ouse">River Ouse</a> to <a href="Watling%20Street">Watling Street</a>.

In other words, Alfred succeeded to Ceolwulf's kingdom consisting of western Mercia, and Guthrum incorporated the eastern part of Mercia into an enlarged <a href="kingdom%20of%20East%20Anglia">kingdom of East Anglia</a> (henceforward known as the <a href="Danelaw">Danelaw</a>). By terms of the treaty, moreover, Alfred was to have control over the Mercian city of London and its mints—at least for the time being. The disposition of <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, held by West Saxon kings since the days of <a href="Egbert%20of%20Wessex">Egbert</a>, is unclear from the treaty though, given Alfred's political and military superiority, it would have been surprising if he had conceded any disputed territory to his new godson.

With the signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Alfred%20and%20Guthrum">Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum</a>, an event most commonly held to have taken place around 880 when Guthrum's people began settling <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>, Guthrum was neutralised as a threat. The Viking army, which had stayed at Fulham during the winter of 878–879, sailed for Ghent and was active on the continent from 879–892.

Alfred was still forced to contend with a number of Danish threats. A year later, in 881, Alfred fought a small sea battle against four Danish ships "on the high seas", Two of the ships were destroyed and the others surrendered to Alfred's forces. Similar small skirmishes with independent Viking raiders would have occurred for much of the period, as they had for decades.

In 883—though there is some debate over the year—King Alfred, because of his support and his donation of alms to Rome, received a number of gifts from <a href="Pope%20Marinus%20I">Pope Marinus</a>. Among these gifts was reputed to be a piece of the <a href="true%20cross">true cross</a>, a great treasure for the devout Saxon king. According to Asser, because of Pope Marinus' friendship with King Alfred, the pope granted an exemption to any Anglo-Saxons residing within Rome from tax or tribute.

After the signing of the treaty with Guthrum, Alfred was spared any large-scale conflicts for some time. Despite this relative peace the king was still forced to deal with a number of Danish raids and incursions. Among these was a raid in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, an allied kingdom in <a href="South%20East%20England">South East England</a>, during the year 885, which was quite possibly the largest raid since the battles with Guthrum. Asser's account of the raid places the Danish raiders at the Saxon city of <a href="Rochester%2C%20Kent">Rochester</a> where they built a temporary fortress in order to besiege the city. In response to this incursion Alfred led an <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> force against the Danes who, instead of engaging the army of Wessex, fled to their beached ships and sailed to another part of Britain. The retreating Danish force supposedly left Britain the following summer.

Not long after the failed Danish raid in Kent, Alfred dispatched his fleet to East Anglia. The purpose of this expedition is debated, though Asser claims that it was for the sake of plunder. After travelling up the <a href="River%20Stour%2C%20Suffolk">River Stour</a> the fleet was met by Danish vessels that numbered 13 or 16 (sources vary on the number) and a battle ensued. The Anglo-Saxon fleet emerged victorious and, as Huntingdon accounts, "laden with spoils". The victorious fleet was then caught unawares when attempting to leave the River Stour and was attacked by a Danish force at the mouth of the river. The Danish fleet defeated Alfred's fleet, which may have been weakened in the previous engagement.
A year later, in 886, Alfred reoccupied the city of <a href="London">London</a> and set out to make it habitable again. Alfred entrusted the city to the care of his son-in-law <a href="%C3%86thelred%2C%20Ealdorman%20of%20Mercia">Æthelred</a>, <a href="ealdorman">ealdorman</a> of Mercia. The restoration of London progressed through the latter half of the 880s and is believed to have revolved around: a new street plan; added fortifications in addition to the existing Roman walls; and, some believe, the construction of matching fortifications on the south bank of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>.

This is also the period in which almost all chroniclers agree that the Saxon people of pre-unification England submitted to Alfred. This was not, however, the point at which Alfred came to be known as King of England; in fact he would never adopt the title for himself.

Between the restoration of London and the resumption of large-scale Danish attacks in the early 890s, Alfred's reign was rather uneventful. The relative peace of the late 880s was marred by the death of Alfred's sister, <a href="%C3%86thelswith">Æthelswith</a>, en route to Rome in 888. In the same year the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, Æthelred, also died. One year later Guthrum, or Athelstan by his baptismal name, Alfred's former enemy and king of East Anglia, died and was buried in <a href="Hadleigh%2C%20Suffolk">Hadleigh, Suffolk</a>.
Guthrum's passing changed the political landscape for Alfred. The resulting power vacuum stirred up other power–hungry warlords eager to take his place in the following years. The quiet years of Alfred's life were coming to a close and war was on the horizon.

After another lull, in the autumn of 892 or 893, the Danes attacked again. Finding their position in mainland Europe precarious, they crossed to England in 330 ships in two divisions. They entrenched themselves, the larger body, at <a href="Appledore%2C%20Kent">Appledore, Kent</a>, and the lesser under <a href="Hastein">Hastein</a>, at <a href="Milton%2C%20Kent">Milton</a>, also in Kent. The invaders brought their wives and children with them indicating a meaningful attempt at conquest and colonisation. Alfred, in 893 or 894, took up a position from which he could observe both forces.

While he was in talks with Hastein the Danes at Appledore broke out and struck northwestwards. They were overtaken by Alfred's eldest son, <a href="Edward%20the%20Elder">Edward</a>, and were defeated in a general engagement at <a href="Farnham">Farnham</a> in <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>. They took refuge on an island at <a href="Thorney%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Thorney</a>, on the <a href="River%20Colne%2C%20Hertfordshire">River Colne</a> between <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a> and <a href="Middlesex">Middlesex</a>, where they were blockaded and forced to give hostages and promise to leave Wessex. They then went to Essex and, after suffering another defeat at <a href="South%20Benfleet">Benfleet</a>, joined with Hastein's force at <a href="Shoeburyness">Shoebury</a>.

Alfred had been on his way to relieve his son at Thorney when he heard that the <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>n and East Anglian Danes were besieging <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a> and an unnamed stronghold on the <a href="North%20Devon">North Devon</a> shore. Alfred at once hurried westward and raised the <a href="Siege">Siege</a> of <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>. The fate of the other place is not recorded.

Meanwhile, the force under Hastein set out to march up the <a href="Thames%20Valley">Thames Valley</a>, possibly with the idea of assisting their friends in the west. They were met by a large force under the three great ealdormen of <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>, <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> and <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> and, forced to head off to the northwest, being finally overtaken and blockaded at <a href="Buttington">Buttington</a>. (Some identify this with Buttington Tump at the mouth of the <a href="River%20Wye">River Wye</a>, others with Buttington near <a href="Welshpool">Welshpool</a>.) An attempt to break through the English lines was defeated. Those who escaped retreated to Shoebury. After collecting reinforcements, they made a sudden dash across England and occupied the ruined <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> walls of <a href="Chester">Chester</a>. The English did not attempt a winter <a href="blockade">blockade</a> but contented themselves with destroying all the supplies in the district.

Early in 894 or 895 lack of food obliged the Danes to retire once more to <a href="Essex">Essex</a>. At the end of the year the Danes drew their ships up the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> and the <a href="River%20Lea">River Lea</a> and fortified themselves north of London. A direct attack on the Danish lines failed but, later in the year, Alfred saw a means of obstructing the river so as to prevent the egress of the Danish ships. The Danes realised that they were outmanoeuvred. They struck off north-westwards and wintered at <a href="Quatford">Cwatbridge</a> near <a href="Bridgnorth">Bridgnorth</a>. The next year, 896 (or 897), they gave up the struggle. Some retired to <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>, some to <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>. Those who had no connections in England withdrew back to the continent.

The Germanic tribes who invaded Britain in the fifth and sixth centuries relied upon the unarmoured infantry supplied by their <a href="Conscription">tribal levy</a>, or fyrd, and it was upon this system that the military power of the several kingdoms of early Anglo-Saxon England depended. The fyrd was a local <a href="militia">militia</a> in the Anglo-Saxon shire in which all freemen had to serve; those who refused military service were subject to fines or loss of their land.
According to the <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20law">law code</a> of <a href="Ine%20of%20Wessex">King Ine of Wessex</a>, issued in about 694:
Wessex's history of failures preceding his success in 878 emphasised to Alfred that the traditional system of battle he had inherited played to the Danes' advantage. While both the Anglo-Saxons and the Danes attacked settlements to seize wealth and other resources, they employed very different strategies. In their raids the Anglo-Saxons traditionally preferred to attack head-on by assembling their forces in a <a href="shield%20wall">shield wall</a>, advancing against their target and overcoming the oncoming wall marshaled against them in defence.

In contrast the Danes preferred to choose easy targets, mapping cautious forays designed to avoid risking all their accumulated plunder with high-stake attacks for more. Alfred determined their strategy was to launch smaller scaled attacks from a secure and reinforced defensible base to which they could retreat should their raiders meet strong resistance.

These bases were prepared in advance, often by capturing an estate and augmenting its defences with surrounding ditches, <a href="defensive%20wall">ramparts</a> and <a href="palisade">palisade</a>s. Once inside the fortification, Alfred realised, the Danes enjoyed the advantage, better situated to outlast their opponents or crush them with a counter-attack as the provisions and stamina of the besieging forces waned.

The means by which the Anglo-Saxons marshaled forces to defend against marauders also left them vulnerable to the Vikings. It was the responsibility of the shire fyrd to deal with local raids. The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom but, in the case of the Viking hit-and-run raids, problems with communication, and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough. It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather their men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the fyrd could assemble and arrive. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.

With these lessons in mind Alfred capitalised on the relatively peaceful years immediately following his victory at Edington by focusing on an ambitious restructuring of his kingdom's military defences. On a trip to Rome Alfred had stayed with <a href="Charles%20the%20Bald">Charles the Bald</a> and it is possible that he may have studied how the Carolingian kings had dealt with the Viking problem. Learning from their experiences he was able to put together a system of taxation and defence for his own kingdom. Also there had been a system of fortifications in pre-Viking Mercia that may have been an influence. So when the Viking raids resumed in 892 Alfred was better prepared to confront them with a standing, mobile field army, a network of garrisons, and a small fleet of ships navigating the rivers and estuaries.

Tenants in Anglo-Saxon England had a threefold obligation based on their landholding: the so-called "common burdens" of military service, fortress work, and bridge repair. This threefold obligation has traditionally been called "trinoda neccessitas" or "trimoda neccessitas". The Old English name for the fine due for neglecting military service was "fierdwite" or "fyrdwitee".

To maintain the <a href="burh">burh</a>s, and to reorganise the fyrd as a standing army, Alfred expanded the tax and conscription system based on the productivity of a tenant's landholding. The "hide" was the basic unit of the system on which the tenant's public obligations were assessed. A "hide" is thought to represent the amount of land required to support one family. The "hide" would differ in size according to the value and resources of the land, and the landowner would have to provide service based on how many "hides" he owned.

At the centre of Alfred's reformed military defence system was the network of <a href="burh">burh</a>s, distributed at strategic points throughout the kingdom. There were thirty-three in total, spaced approximately apart, enabling the military to confront attacks anywhere in the kingdom within a single day.

Alfred's burhs (later termed <a href="boroughs">boroughs</a>) ranged from former Roman towns, such as Winchester, where the stone walls were repaired and ditches added, to massive earthen walls surrounded by wide ditches, probably reinforced with wooden <a href="revetment">revetment</a>s and palisades, such as at Burpham, Sussex. The size of the burhs ranged from tiny outposts such as Pilton to large fortifications in established towns, the largest being at <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a>.

A contemporary document now known as the <a href="Burghal%20Hidage">Burghal Hidage</a> provides an insight into how the system worked. It lists the "hidage" for each of the fortified towns contained in the document. For example, Wallingford had a "hidage" of 2400, which meant that the landowners there were responsible for supplying and feeding 2,400 men, the number sufficient for maintaining of wall. A total of 27,071 soldiers were needed system-wide, or approximately one in four of all the free men in Wessex.

Many of the burhs were twin towns that straddled a river and were connected by a fortified bridge, like those built by <a href="Charles%20the%20Bald">Charles the Bald</a> a generation before. The double-burh blocked passage on the river, forcing Viking ships to navigate under a garrisoned bridge lined with men armed with stones, spears, or arrows. Other burhs were sited near fortified royal villas, allowing the king better control over his strongholds.
The burhs were also interconnected by a road system maintained for army use (known as "<a href="herepath">herepath</a>s"). These roads would allow an army to be quickly assembled, sometimes from more than one burh, to confront the Viking invader. This network posed significant obstacles to Viking invaders, especially those laden with booty. The system threatened Viking routes and communications making it far more dangerous for the Viking raiders. The Vikings lacked both the equipment necessary to undertake a siege against a burh and a developed doctrine of <a href="siegecraft">siegecraft</a>, having tailored their methods of fighting to rapid strikes and unimpeded retreats to well-defended fortifications. The only means left to them was to starve the burh into submission, but this gave the king time to send his mobile field army or garrisons from neighbouring burhs along the well-maintained army roads. In such cases the Vikings were extremely vulnerable to pursuit by the king's joint military forces. Alfred's burh system posed such a formidable challenge against Viking attack that when the Vikings returned in 892, and successfully stormed a half-made, poorly garrisoned fortress up the Lympne estuary in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, the Anglo-Saxons were able to limit their penetration to the outer frontiers of Wessex and Mercia.

Alfred's burghal system was revolutionary in its strategic conception and potentially expensive in its execution. His contemporary biographer Asser wrote that many nobles balked at the new demands placed upon them even though they were for "the common needs of the kingdom".

Alfred also tried his hand at naval design. In 896 he ordered the construction of a small fleet, perhaps a dozen or so longships that, at 60 oars, were twice the size of Viking warships. This was not, as the Victorians asserted, the birth of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">English Navy</a>. Wessex had possessed a royal fleet before this. <a href="%C3%86thelstan%20of%20Wessex">King Athelstan</a> of Kent and Ealdorman Ealhhere had defeated a Viking fleet in 851 capturing nine ships, and Alfred himself had conducted naval actions in 882.

Nevertheless, 897 clearly marked an important development in the naval power of Wessex. The author of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" related that Alfred's ships were larger, swifter, steadier and rode higher in the water than either Danish or Frisian ships. It is probable that, under the classical tutelage of Asser, Alfred utilised the design of <a href="Hellenistic-era%20warships">Greek and Roman warships</a>, with high sides, designed for fighting rather than for navigation.

Alfred had seapower in mind—if he could intercept raiding fleets before they landed, he could spare his kingdom from being ravaged. Alfred's ships may have been superior in conception. In practice they proved to be too large to manoeuvre well in the close waters of estuaries and rivers, the only places in which a naval battle could occur.

The warships of the time were not designed to be ship killers but rather troop carriers. It has been suggested that, like sea battles in late Viking age Scandinavia, these battles may have entailed a ship coming alongside an enemy vessel, lashing the two ships together and then boarding the enemy craft. The result was effectively a land battle involving hand-to-hand fighting on board the two lashed vessels.

In the one recorded naval engagement in 896 Alfred's new fleet of nine ships intercepted six Viking ships in the mouth of an unidentified river along the south of England. The Danes had beached half their ships and gone inland, either to rest their rowers or to forage for food. Alfred's ships immediately moved to block their escape to the sea. The three Viking ships afloat attempted to break through the English lines. Only one made it; Alfred's ships intercepted the other two.

Lashing the Viking boats to their own the English crew boarded the enemy's vessels and proceeded to kill everyone on board. The one ship that escaped managed to do so only because all of Alfred's heavy ships became grounded when the tide went out. What ensued was a land battle between the crews of the grounded ships. The Danes, heavily outnumbered, would have been wiped out if the tide had not risen. When that occurred the Danes rushed back to their boats which, being lighter with shallower drafts, were freed before Alfred's ships. Helplessly the English watched as the Vikings rowed past them. The pirates had suffered so many casualties (120 Danes dead against 62 Frisians and English) that they had difficulty putting out to sea. All were too damaged to row around Sussex and two were driven against the Sussex coast (possibly at <a href="Selsey%20Bill">Selsey Bill</a>). The shipwrecked sailors were brought before Alfred at Winchester and hanged.

In the late 880s or early 890s Alfred issued a long "<a href="Doom%20book">domboc</a>" or <a href="law%20code">law code</a> consisting of his "own" laws, followed by a code issued by his late seventh-century predecessor King <a href="Ine%20of%20Wessex">Ine of Wessex</a>. Together these laws are arranged into 120 chapters. In his introduction Alfred explains that he gathered together the laws he found in many "<a href="synod">synod</a>-books" and "ordered to be written many of the ones that our forefathers observed—those that pleased me; and many of the ones that did not please me, I rejected with the advice of my councillors, and commanded them to be observed in a different way".

Alfred singled out in particular the laws that he "found in the days of Ine, my kinsman, or <a href="Offa">Offa</a>, king of the Mercians, or King <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Kent">Æthelberht of Kent</a> who first among the English people received baptism". He appended, rather than integrated, the laws of Ine into his code and, although he included, as had Æthelbert, a scale of payments in compensation for injuries to various body parts the two injury tariffs are not aligned. Offa is not known to have issued a law code leading historian <a href="Patrick%20Wormald">Patrick Wormald</a> to speculate that Alfred had in mind the legatine capitulary of 786 that was presented to Offa by two papal legates.

About a fifth of the law code is taken up by Alfred's introduction which includes translations into English of the <a href="Ten%20Commandments">Ten Commandments</a>, a few chapters from the <a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Book of Exodus</a>, and the "Apostolic Letter" from the <a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a> (15:23–29). The Introduction may best be understood as Alfred's meditation upon the meaning of Christian law. It traces the continuity between God's gift of law to Moses to Alfred's own issuance of law to the West Saxon people. By doing so, it linked the holy past to the historical present and represented Alfred's law-giving as a type of divine legislation.

Similarly Alfred divided his code into 120 chapters because 120 was the age at which Moses died and, in the number-symbolism of early medieval biblical exegetes, 120 stood for law. The link between the Mosaic Law and Alfred's code is the "Apostolic Letter" which explained that Christ "had come not to shatter or annul the commandments but to fulfill them; and he taught mercy and meekness". (Intro, 49.1) The mercy that Christ infused into Mosaic Law underlies the injury tariffs that figure so prominently in barbarian law codes since Christian synods "established, through that mercy which Christ taught, that for almost every misdeed at the first offence secular lords might with their permission receive without sin the monetary compensation which they then fixed".

The only crime that could not be compensated with a payment of money was treachery to a lord "since Almighty God adjudged none for those who despised Him, nor did Christ, the Son of God, adjudge any for the one who betrayed Him to death; and He commanded everyone to love his lord as Himself". Alfred's transformation of Christ's commandment, from "Love your neighbour as yourself" (Matt. 22:39–40) to love your secular lord as you would love the Lord Christ himself, underscores the importance that Alfred placed upon lordship which he understood as a sacred bond instituted by God for the governance of man.

When one turns from the domboc's introduction to the laws themselves it is difficult to uncover any logical arrangement. The impression one receives is of a hodgepodge of miscellaneous laws. The law code, as it has been preserved, is singularly unsuitable for use in lawsuits. In fact several of Alfred's laws contradicted <a href="Ine%20of%20Wessex%23Laws">the laws of Ine</a> that form an integral part of the code. Patrick Wormald's explanation is that Alfred's law code should be understood not as a legal manual but as an ideological manifesto of kingship "designed more for symbolic impact than for practical direction". In practical terms the most important law in the code may well have been the very first: "We enjoin, what is most necessary, that each man keep carefully his oath and his pledge" which expresses a fundamental tenet of Anglo-Saxon law.

Alfred devoted considerable attention and thought to judicial matters. Asser underscores his concern for judicial fairness. Alfred, according to Asser, insisted upon reviewing contested judgments made by his ealdormen and reeves and "would carefully look into nearly all the judgements which were passed [issued] in his absence anywhere in the realm to see whether they were just or unjust". A charter from the reign of his son Edward the Elder depicts Alfred as hearing one such appeal in his chamber while washing his hands.

Asser represents Alfred as a <a href="Judgment%20of%20Solomon">Solomonic</a> judge, painstaking in his own judicial investigations and critical of royal officials who rendered unjust or unwise judgments. Although Asser never mentions Alfred's law code he does say that Alfred insisted that his judges be literate so that they could apply themselves "to the pursuit of wisdom". The failure to comply with this royal order was to be punished by loss of office.

The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", commissioned at the time of Alfred, was probably written to promote unification of England, whereas Asser's "The Life of King Alfred" promoted Alfred's achievements and personal qualities. It was possible that the document was designed this way so that it could be disseminated in Wales, as Alfred had recently acquired overlordship of that country.

Asser speaks grandiosely of Alfred's relations with foreign powers but little definite information is available. His interest in foreign countries is shown by the insertions which he made in his translation of <a href="Paulus%20Orosius">Orosius</a>. He corresponded with <a href="Elias%20III%20of%20Jerusalem">Elias III</a>, the <a href="Orthodox%20Patriarch%20of%20Jerusalem">Patriarch of Jerusalem</a>, and embassies to Rome conveying the English alms to the <a href="Pope">Pope</a> were fairly frequent. Around 890 <a href="Wulfstan%20of%20Hedeby">Wulfstan of Hedeby</a> undertook a journey from <a href="Hedeby">Hedeby</a> on <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a> along the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> to the <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n trading town of <a href="Truso">Truso</a>. Alfred personally collected details of this trip.

Alfred's relations with the Celtic princes in the western half of <a href="Great%20Britain">Britain</a> are clearer. Comparatively early in his reign, according to Asser, the <a href="South%20Wales">southern Welsh</a> princes, owing to the pressure on them from <a href="North%20Wales">North Wales</a> and <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>, commended themselves to Alfred. Later in his reign the <a href="North%20Wales">North Welsh</a> followed their example and the latter cooperated with the English in the campaign of 893 (or 894). That Alfred sent alms to Irish and Continental monasteries may be taken on Asser's authority. The visit of the three pilgrim "Scots" (i.e. Irish) to Alfred in 891 is undoubtedly authentic. The story that he himself in his childhood was sent to Ireland to be healed by Saint <a href="Modwenna">Modwenna</a>, though mythical, may show Alfred's interest in that island.

In the 880s, at the same time that he was "cajoling and threatening" his nobles to build and man the <a href="burh">burh</a>s, Alfred, perhaps inspired by the example of <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> almost a century before, undertook an equally ambitious effort to revive learning. During this time period the Viking raids were often seen as a divine punishment and Alfred may have wished to revive religious awe in order to appease God's wrath. This revival entailed the recruitment of clerical scholars from Mercia, Wales and abroad to enhance the tenor of the court and of the <a href="episcopacy">episcopacy</a>; the establishment of a court school to educate his own children, the sons of his nobles, and intellectually promising boys of lesser birth; an attempt to require literacy in those who held offices of authority; a series of translations into the vernacular of Latin works the king deemed "most necessary for all men to know"; the compilation of a chronicle detailing the rise of Alfred's kingdom and house, with a genealogy that stretched back to Adam, thus giving the West Saxon kings a biblical ancestry.

Very little is known of the church under Alfred. The Danish attacks had been particularly damaging to the monasteries. Although Alfred founded monasteries at Athelney and Shaftesbury, these were the first new monastic houses in Wessex since the beginning of the eighth century. According to Asser, Alfred enticed foreign monks to England for his monastery at Athelney as there was little interest for the locals to take up the monastic life.

Alfred undertook no systematic reform of ecclesiastical institutions or religious practices in Wessex. For him the key to the kingdom's spiritual revival was to appoint pious, learned, and trustworthy bishops and abbots. As king he saw himself as responsible for both the temporal and spiritual welfare of his subjects. Secular and spiritual authority were not distinct categories for Alfred.

He was equally comfortable distributing his translation of <a href="Gregory%20the%20Great">Gregory the Great</a>'s "<a href="Pastoral%20Care">Pastoral Care</a>" to his bishops so that they might better train and supervise priests and using those same bishops as royal officials and judges. Nor did his piety prevent him from expropriating strategically sited church lands, especially estates along the border with the Danelaw, and transferring them to royal <a href="thegn">thegn</a>s and officials who could better defend them against Viking attacks.

The Danish raids had a devastating effect on learning in England. Alfred lamented in the preface to his translation of Gregory's "Pastoral Care" that "learning had declined so thoroughly in England that there were very few men on this side of the Humber who could understand their divine services in English or even translate a single letter from Latin into English: and I suppose that there were not many beyond the Humber either". Alfred undoubtedly exaggerated, for dramatic effect, the abysmal state of learning in England during his youth. That Latin learning had not been obliterated is evidenced by the presence in his court of learned Mercian and West Saxon clerics such as Plegmund, Wæferth, and Wulfsige.

Manuscript production in England dropped off precipitously around the 860s when the Viking invasions began in earnest, not to be revived until the end of the century. Numerous Anglo-Saxon manuscripts burnt up along with the churches that housed them. And a solemn diploma from <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Canterbury">Christ Church, Canterbury</a>, dated 873, is so poorly constructed and written that historian <a href="Nicholas%20Brooks">Nicholas Brooks</a> posited a scribe who was either so blind he could not read what he wrote or who knew little or no Latin. "It is clear", Brooks concludes, "that the metropolitan church [of Canterbury] must have been quite unable to provide any effective training in the scriptures or in Christian worship".

Following the example of <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> Alfred established a court school for the education of his own children, those of the nobility, and "a good many of lesser birth". There they studied books in both English and Latin and "devoted themselves to writing, to such an extent ... they were seen to be devoted and intelligent students of the liberal arts". He recruited scholars from the Continent and from Britain to aid in the revival of Christian learning in Wessex and to provide the king personal instruction. <a href="Grimbald">Grimbald</a> and John the Saxon came from Francia; Plegmund (whom Alfred appointed archbishop of Canterbury in 890), Bishop Werferth of Worcester, Æthelstan, and the royal chaplains Werwulf, from Mercia; and Asser, from St David's in southwestern Wales.

Alfred's educational ambitions seem to have extended beyond the establishment of a court school. Believing that without Christian wisdom there can be neither prosperity nor success in war, Alfred aimed "to set to learning (as long as they are not useful for some other employment) all the free-born young men now in England who have the means to apply themselves to it". Conscious of the decay of Latin literacy in his realm Alfred proposed that primary education be taught in <a href="Old%20English">English</a>, with those wishing to advance to holy orders to continue their studies in Latin.

There were few "books of wisdom" written in English. Alfred sought to remedy this through an ambitious court-centred programme of translating into English the books he deemed "most necessary for all men to know". It is unknown when Alfred launched this programme but it may have been during the 880s when Wessex was enjoying a respite from Viking attacks. Alfred was, until recently, often considered to have been the author of many of the translations but this is now considered doubtful in almost all cases. Scholars more often refer to translations as "Alfredian" indicating that they probably had something to do with his patronage but are unlikely to be his own work.

Apart from the lost "Handboc" or "Encheiridio", which seems to have been a <a href="commonplace%20book">commonplace book</a> kept by the king, the earliest work to be translated was the "Dialogues" of <a href="Gregory%20the%20Great">Gregory the Great</a>, a book greatly popular in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. The translation was undertaken at Alfred's command by <a href="Werferth">Werferth</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Bishop of Worcester</a>, with the king merely furnishing a preface. Remarkably Alfred, undoubtedly with the advice and aid of his court scholars, translated four works himself: Gregory the Great's "Pastoral Care", <a href="Boethius">Boethius</a>'s "<a href="Consolation%20of%20Philosophy">Consolation of Philosophy</a>"", <a href="St.%20Augustine">St. Augustine</a>'s "Soliloquies" and the first fifty psalms of the <a href="Psalter">Psalter</a>.

One might add to this list the translation, in Alfred's law code, of excerpts from the <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> Book of Exodus. The Old English versions of <a href="Paulus%20Orosius">Orosius</a>'s "Histories against the Pagans" and <a href="Bede">Bede</a>'s "<a href="Historia%20ecclesiastica%20gentis%20Anglorum">Ecclesiastical History of the English People</a>" are no longer accepted by scholars as Alfred's own translations because of lexical and stylistic differences. Nonetheless the consensus remains that they were part of the Alfredian programme of translation. <a href="Simon%20Keynes">Simon Keynes</a> and <a href="Michael%20Lapidge">Michael Lapidge</a> suggest this also for Bald's "Leechbook" and the anonymous "Old English Martyrology".

The preface of Alfred's translation of Pope Gregory the Great's "Pastoral Care" explained why he thought it necessary to translate works such as this from Latin into English. Although he described his method as translating "sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense", the translation actually keeps very close to the original although, through his choice of language, he blurred throughout the distinction between spiritual and secular authority. Alfred meant the translation to be used, and circulated it to all his bishops. Interest in Alfred's translation of "Pastoral Care" was so enduring that copies were still being made in the 11th century.

Boethius"'Consolation of Philosophy" was the most popular philosophical handbook of the Middle Ages. Unlike the translation of the "Pastoral Care" the <a href="Metres%20of%20Boethius">Alfredian text</a> deals very freely with the original and, though the late Dr. G. Schepss showed that many of the additions to the text are to be traced not to the translator himself but to the glosses and commentaries which he used, still there is much in the work which is distinctive to the translation and has been taken to reflect philosophies of kingship in Alfred's milieu. It is in the Boethius that the oft-quoted sentence occurs: "To speak briefly: I desired to live worthily as long as I lived, and after my life to leave to them that should come after, my memory in good works." The book has come down to us in two manuscripts only. In one of these the writing is prose, in the other a combination of prose and alliterating verse. The latter manuscript was severely damaged in the 18th and 19th centuries.

The last of the Alfredian works is one which bears the name "Blostman", i.e. "Blooms" or Anthology. The first half is based mainly on the "Soliloquies" of St <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>, the remainder is drawn from various sources. The material has traditionally been thought to contain much that is Alfred's own and highly characteristic of him. The last words of it may be quoted; they form a fitting epitaph for the noblest of English kings. "Therefore, he seems to me a very foolish man, and truly wretched, who will not increase his understanding while he is in the world, and ever wish and long to reach that endless life where all shall be made clear." Alfred appears as a character in the twelfth- or thirteenth-century poem "<a href="The%20Owl%20and%20the%20Nightingale">The Owl and the Nightingale</a>" where his wisdom and skill with proverbs is praised. "<a href="The%20Proverbs%20of%20Alfred">The Proverbs of Alfred</a>", a thirteenth-century work, contains sayings that are not likely to have originated with Alfred but attest to his posthumous medieval reputation for wisdom.

The <a href="Alfred%20jewel">Alfred jewel</a>, discovered in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a> in 1693, has long been associated with King Alfred because of its <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> inscription AELFRED MEC HEHT GEWYRCAN (Alfred ordered me to be made). The jewel is about long, made of <a href="filigree">filigree</a>d gold, enclosing a highly polished piece of quartz crystal beneath which is set in a cloisonné enamel plaque with an enamelled image of a man holding floriate sceptres, perhaps personifying Sight or the Wisdom of God.

It was at one time attached to a thin rod or stick based on the hollow socket at its base. The jewel certainly dates from Alfred's reign. Although its function is unknown it has been often suggested that the jewel was one of the "æstels"—pointers for reading—that Alfred ordered sent to every bishopric accompanying a copy of his translation of the "Pastoral Care". Each "æstel" was worth the princely sum of 50 <a href="mancus">mancus</a>es which fits in well with the quality workmanship and expensive materials of the Alfred jewel".

Historian Richard Abels sees Alfred's educational and military reforms as complementary. Restoring religion and learning in Wessex, Abels contends, was to Alfred's mind as essential to the defence of his realm as the building of the burhs. As Alfred observed in the preface to his English translation of Gregory the Great's "Pastoral Care", kings who fail to obey their divine duty to promote learning can expect earthly punishments to befall their people. The pursuit of wisdom, he assured his readers of the Boethius, was the surest path to power: "Study Wisdom, then, and, when you have learned it, condemn it not, for I tell you that by its means you may without fail attain to power, yea, even though not desiring it".

The portrayal of the West-Saxon resistance to the Vikings by Asser and the chronicler as a Christian holy war was more than mere rhetoric or 'propaganda'. It reflected Alfred's own belief in a doctrine of divine rewards and punishments rooted in a vision of a hierarchical Christian world order in which God is the Lord to whom kings owe obedience and through whom they derive their authority over their followers. The need to persuade his nobles to undertake work for the 'common good' led Alfred and his court scholars to strengthen and deepen the conception of Christian kingship that he had inherited by building upon the legacy of earlier kings such as Offa as well as clerical writers such as Bede, Alcuin and the other luminaries of the <a href="Carolingian%20renaissance">Carolingian renaissance</a>. This was not a cynical use of religion to manipulate his subjects into obedience but an intrinsic element in Alfred's worldview. He believed, as did other kings in ninth-century England and Francia, that God had entrusted him with the spiritual as well as physical welfare of his people. If the Christian faith fell into ruin in his kingdom, if the clergy were too ignorant to understand the Latin words they butchered in their offices and liturgies, if the ancient monasteries and collegiate churches lay deserted out of indifference, he was answerable before God, as Josiah had been. Alfred's ultimate responsibility was the pastoral care of his people.

<a href="Asser">Asser</a> wrote of Alfred in his "<a href="Asser">Life of King Alfred</a>":
It is also written by Asser that Alfred did not learn to read until he was twelve years old or later, which is described as "shameful negligence" of his parents and tutors. Alfred was an excellent listener and had an incredible memory and he retained poetry and psalms very well. A story is told by Asser about how his mother held up a book of Saxon poetry to him and his brothers, and said; "I shall give this book to whichever one of you can learn it the fastest." After excitedly asking, "Will you really give this book to the one of us who can understand it the soonest and recite it to you?" Alfred then took it to his teacher, learned it, and recited it back to his mother.

Alfred is also noted as carrying around a small book, probably a medieval version of a small pocket notebook, which contained psalms and many prayers that he often collected. Asser writes: these "he collected in a single book, as I have seen for myself; amid all the affairs of the present life he took it around with him everywhere for the sake of prayer, and was inseparable from it."

An excellent hunter in every branch of the sport, Alfred is remembered as an enthusiastic huntsman against whom nobody’s skills could compare.

Although he was the youngest of his brothers, he was probably the most open-minded. He was an early advocate for education. His desire for learning could have come from his early love of English poetry and inability to read or physically record it until later in life. Asser writes that Alfred "could not satisfy his craving for what he desired the most, namely the liberal arts; for, as he used to say, there were no good scholars in the entire kingdom of the West Saxons at that time".

In 868 Alfred married <a href="Ealhswith">Ealhswith</a>, daughter of a Mercian nobleman, <a href="%C3%86thelred%20Mucel">Æthelred Mucel</a>, <a href="Ealdorman">Ealdorman</a> of the <a href="Gaini">Gaini</a>. The Gaini were probably one of the tribal groups of the Mercians. Ealhswith's mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family.

They had five or six children together including: <a href="Edward%20the%20Elder">Edward the Elder</a> who succeeded his father as king; <a href="%C3%86thelfl%C3%A6d">Æthelflæd</a> who became Lady (ruler) of the Mercians in her own right; and <a href="%C3%86lfthryth%2C%20Countess%20of%20Flanders">Ælfthryth</a> who married <a href="Baldwin%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Flanders">Baldwin II</a> the <a href="Count%20of%20Flanders">Count of Flanders</a>. His mother was <a href="Osburga">Osburga</a>, daughter of Oslac of the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, Chief <a href="Butler">Butler</a> of England. <a href="Asser">Asser</a>, in his "Vita Ælfredi" asserts that this shows his lineage from the <a href="Jutes">Jutes</a> of the Isle of Wight. This is unlikely as <a href="Bede">Bede</a> tells us that they were all slaughtered by the Saxons under <a href="C%C3%A6dwalla%20of%20Wessex">Cædwalla</a>. In 2008 the skeleton of Queen <a href="Eadgyth">Eadgyth</a>, granddaughter of Alfred the Great was found in <a href="Magdeburg%20Cathedral">Magdeburg Cathedral</a> in Germany. It was confirmed in 2010 that these remains belong to her—one of the earliest members of the English royal family.

<a href="Osferth">Osferth</a> was described as a relative in King Alfred's will and he attested charters in a high position until 934. A charter of King Edward's reign described him as the king's brother, "mistakenly" according to Keynes and Lapidge, but in the view of <a href="Janet%20Nelson">Janet Nelson</a> he probably was an illegitimate son of King Alfred.

Alfred died on 26 October 899. How he died is unknown, although he suffered throughout his life with a painful and unpleasant illness. His biographer Asser gave a detailed description of Alfred's symptoms and this has allowed modern doctors to provide a possible diagnosis. It is thought that he had either <a href="Crohn%27s%20disease">Crohn's disease</a> or <a href="hemorrhoids">haemorrhoidal disease</a>. His grandson King <a href="Eadred">Eadred</a> seems to have suffered from a similar illness.

Alfred was originally buried temporarily in the <a href="Old%20Minster%2C%20Winchester">Old Minster</a> in <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a>. Four years after his death he was moved to the <a href="New%20Minster%2C%20Winchester">New Minster</a> (perhaps built especially to receive his body). When the New Minster moved to Hyde, a little north of the city, in 1110, the monks were transferred to <a href="Hyde%20Abbey">Hyde Abbey</a> along with Alfred's body and those of his wife and children, which were presumably interred before the high altar. Soon after the dissolution of the abbey in 1539, during the reign of <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a>, the church was demolished, leaving the graves intact.

The royal graves and many others were probably rediscovered by chance in 1788 when a prison was being constructed by convicts on the site. Prisoners dug across the width of the altar area in order to dispose of rubble left at the dissolution. Coffins were stripped of lead, and bones were scattered and lost. The prison was demolished between 1846 and 1850. Further excavations in 1866 and 1897 were inconclusive. In 1866 amateur antiquarian John Mellor claimed to have recovered a number of bones from the site which he said were those of Alfred. These later came into the possession of the vicar of nearby St Bartholomew's Church who reburied them in an unmarked grave in the church graveyard.

Excavations conducted by the Winchester Museums Service of the Hyde Abbey site in 1999 located a second pit dug in front of where the high altar would have been located, which was identified as probably dating to Mellor's 1886 excavation. The 1999 archeological excavation uncovered the foundations of the abbey buildings and some bones. Bones suggested at the time to be those of Alfred proved instead to belong to an elderly woman.

In March 2013 the Diocese of Winchester exhumed the bones from the unmarked grave at St Bartholomew's and placed them in secure storage. The diocese made no claim they were the bones of Alfred, but intended to secure them for later analysis, and from the attentions of people whose interest may have been sparked by the recent identification of the remains of <a href="Richard%20III%20of%20England">King Richard III</a>. The bones were <a href="Radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon-dated</a> but the results showed that they were from the 1300s and therefore unrelated to Alfred. In January 2014, a fragment of pelvis unearthed in the 1999 excavation of the Hyde site, which had subsequently lain in a Winchester museum store room, was radiocarbon-dated to the correct period. It has been suggested that this bone may belong to either Alfred or his son <a href="Edward%20the%20Elder">Edward</a>, but this remains unproven.

Alfred is venerated as a <a href="saint">saint</a> by some Christian traditions, but an attempt by <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI of England</a> in 1441 to have him canonized by the <a href="Pope%20Eugene%20IV">pope</a> was unsuccessful. The <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a> venerates him as a <a href="Saints%20in%20Anglicanism">Christian hero</a>, with a <a href="Lesser%20Festival%20%28Anglicanism%29">feast day</a> or commemoration on 26 October, and he may often be found depicted in <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> in <a href="Church%20of%20England%20parish%20church">Church of England parish church</a>es.

Alfred commissioned Bishop Asser to write his biography, which inevitably emphasised Alfred's positive aspects. Later medieval historians, such as <a href="Geoffrey%20of%20Monmouth">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a>, also reinforced Alfred's favourable image. By the time of the <a href="Reformation">Reformation</a> Alfred was seen as being a pious Christian ruler who promoted the use of English rather than Latin, and so the translations that he commissioned were viewed as untainted by the later Roman Catholic influences of the Normans. Consequently, it was writers of the sixteenth century who gave Alfred his epithet as 'the Great' rather than any of Alfred's contemporaries. The epithet was retained by succeeding generations of Parliamentarians and empire-builders who saw Alfred's patriotism, success against barbarism, promotion of education and establishment of the rule of law as supporting their own ideals.

A number of educational establishments are named in Alfred's honour. These include:

The <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> has named one ship and two <a href="shore%20establishment">shore establishment</a>s <a href="HMS%20King%20Alfred">HMS "King Alfred"</a>, and one of the first ships of the <a href="US%20Navy">US Navy</a> was named <a href="USS%20Alfred">USS "Alfred"</a> in his honour. In 2002, Alfred was ranked number 14 in the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s list of the <a href="100%20Greatest%20Britons">100 Greatest Britons</a> following a UK-wide vote.

One of the first items visible when entering the campus of Alfred University is a bronze statue of the king, created in 1990 by William Underhill. It features the king as a young man, holding a shield in his left hand and an open book in his right.

A prominent statue of King Alfred the Great stands in the middle of <a href="Pewsey">Pewsey</a>. It was unveiled in June 1913 to commemorate the coronation of King <a href="George%20V">George V</a>.

A statue of Alfred the Great, situated in the <a href="Wantage">Wantage</a> <a href="market%20place">market place</a>, was sculpted by <a href="Prince%20Victor%20of%20Hohenlohe-Langenburg">Count Gleichen</a>, a relative of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, and unveiled on 14 July 1877 by the <a href="Edward%20VII">Prince</a> and <a href="Alexandra%20of%20Denmark">Princess of Wales</a>.
The statue was vandalised on <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">New Year's Eve</a> 2007, losing part of its right arm and axe. After the arm and axe were replaced the statue was again vandalised on <a href="Christmas%20Eve">Christmas Eve</a> 2008, losing its axe.

A bronze statue of Alfred the Great stands at the eastern end of The Broadway, close to the site of <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a>'s medieval East Gate. The statue was designed by Hamo Thornycroft, and erected in 1899 to mark one thousand years since Alfred's death. The statue is placed on a pedestal consisting of two immense blocks of gray Cornish granite.

A marble statue of Alfred the Great stands on the North side of the <a href="Cuyahoga%20County%20Courthouse">Cuyahoga County Courthouse</a> in <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland, Ohio</a>. It was sculpted by Isidore Konti in 1910.

Alessandro Algardi

Alessandro Algardi (31 July 159810 June 1654) was an <a href="Italy">Italian</a> high-<a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> sculptor active almost exclusively in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, where for the latter decades of his life, he was, along with <a href="Francesco%20Borromini">Francesco Borromini</a> and <a href="Pietro%20da%20Cortona">Pietro da Cortona</a>, one of the major rivals of <a href="Gian%20Lorenzo%20Bernini">Gian Lorenzo Bernini</a>.

Algardi was born in <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, where at a young age, he was apprenticed in the studio of <a href="Agostino%20Carracci">Agostino Carracci</a>. However, his aptitude for <a href="sculpture">sculpture</a> led him to work for Giulio Cesare Conventi (1577–1640), an artist of modest talents. His two earliest known works date back to this period: two statues of saints, made of chalk, in the Oratory of Santa Maria della Vita in Bologna. By the age of twenty, <a href="Duke%20of%20Mantua">Ferdinando I, Duke of Mantua</a>, began commissioning works from him, and he was also employed by local jewelers for figurative designs. After a short residence in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, he went to Rome in 1625 with an introduction from the Duke of Mantua to the <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20XV">late pope's</a> nephew, Cardinal <a href="Ludovico%20Ludovisi">Ludovico Ludovisi</a>, who employed him for a time in the restoration of ancient statues.

Propelled by the <a href="Borghese">Borghese</a> and <a href="Barberini">Barberini</a> patronage, Gian Lorenzo Bernini and his studio garnered most of the major Roman sculptural commissions. For nearly a decade, Algardi struggled for recognition. In Rome he was aided by friends that included <a href="Pietro%20da%20Cortona">Pietro da Cortona</a> and his fellow Bolognese, <a href="Domenichino">Domenichino</a>. His early Roman commissions included terracotta and some marble portrait busts, while he supported himself with small works like crucifixes. In the 1630s he worked on the tombs of the Mellini family in the <a href="Mellini%20Chapel%20%28Santa%20Maria%20del%20Popolo%29">Mellini Chapel</a> in <a href="Santa%20Maria%20del%20Popolo">Santa Maria del Popolo</a>.
Algardi's first major commission came about in 1634, when Cardinal Ubaldini (Medici) contracted for a funeral monument for his great-uncle, <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XI">Pope Leo XI</a>, the third of the <a href="Medici">Medici</a> popes, who had reigned for less than a month in 1605. The monument was started in 1640, and mostly completed by 1644. The arrangement mirrors the one designed by Bernini for the Tomb of <a href="Urban%20VIII">Urban VIII</a> (1628–47), with a central hieratic sculpture of the pope seated in full regalia and offering a hand of blessing, while at his feet, two allegorical female figures flank his sarcophagus. However, in Bernini's tomb, the vigorous upraised arm and posture of the pope is counterbalanced by an active drama below, wherein the figures of "Charity" and "Justice" are either distracted by "putti" or lost in contemplation, while skeletal "Death" actively writes the epitaph. Algardi's tomb is much less dynamic. The allegorical figures of "Magnanimity" and "Liberality" have an impassive, ethereal dignity. Some have identified the helmeted figure of "Magnanimity" with that of <a href="Athena">Athena</a> and iconic images of "Wisdom". "Liberality" resembles <a href="Francois%20Duquesnoy">Duquesnoy's</a> famous "Santa Susanna", but rendered more elegant. The tomb is somberly monotone and lacks the polychromatic excitement that detracts from the elegiac mood of Urban VIII's tomb.

In 1635–38, <a href="Pietro%20Boncompagni">Pietro Boncompagni</a> commissioned from Algardi a colossal statue of <a href="Philip%20Neri">Philip Neri</a> with kneeling angels for <a href="Santa%20Maria%20in%20Vallicella">Santa Maria in Vallicella</a>, completed in 1640. Immediately after this, Algardi produced an interactive sculptural group representing the beheading of <a href="Paul%20of%20Tarsus">Saint Paul</a> with two figures: a kneeling, resigned saint and the executioner poised to strike the sword-blow, for the church of <a href="San%20Paolo%2C%20Bologna">San Paolo, Bologna</a>. These works established his reputation. Like Bernini's characteristic works, they often express the Baroque aesthetic of depicting dramatic attitudes and emotional expressions, yet Algardi's sculpture has a restraining sobriety in contrast to those of his rival.

With the death of the Barberini <a href="Pope%20Urban%20VIII">Pope Urban VIII</a> in 1644 and the accession of the <a href="Pamphilj">Pamphilj</a> <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20X">Pope Innocent X</a>, the Barberini family and their favorite artist, Bernini, fell into disrepute. Algardi, on the other hand, was embraced by the new pope and the pope's nephew, <a href="Camillo%20Pamphilj">Camillo Pamphilj</a>. Algardi's portraits were highly prized, and their formal severity contrasts with Bernini's more vivacious expression. A large hieratic bronze of Innocent X by Algardi is now to be found in the <a href="Musei%20Capitolini">Capitoline Museums</a>.

Algardi was not renowned for his architectural abilities. Although he was in charge of the project for the papal villa, the Villa Pamphili, now <a href="Villa%20Doria%20Pamphili">Villa Doria Pamphili</a>, outside the Porta San Pancrazio in Rome, he may have had professional guidance on the design of the casino from the architect/engineer <a href="Girolamo%20Rainaldi">Girolamo Rainaldi</a> and help with supervising its construction from his assistant <a href="Giovanni%20Francesco%20Grimaldi">Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi</a>. The casino was a showcase for the Pamphili collection of sculpture, ancient and contemporary, on which Algardi was well able to advise. In the villa grounds, Algardi and his studio executed sculpture-encrusted fountains and other garden features, where some of his free-standing sculpture and bas-reliefs remain.

In 1650 Algardi met <a href="Diego%20Vel%C3%A1zquez">Diego Velázquez</a>, who obtained commissions for his work from <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. As a consequence there are four chimney-pieces by Algardi in the <a href="Royal%20Palace%20of%20Aranjuez">Royal Palace of Aranjuez</a>, and in the gardens, the figures on the fountain of <a href="Neptune%20%28god%29">Neptune</a> are also by him. The Augustinian monastery at <a href="Salamanca">Salamanca</a> contains the tomb of the Count and Countess de Monterey, another work by Algardi.

Algardi's large dramatic marble high-relief panel of Pope Leo and Attila(1646–53) for <a href="St%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">St Peter's Basilica</a>, and reinvigorated the use of such marble reliefs. There had been large marble reliefs used previously in Roman churches, but for most patrons, sculpted marble altarpieces were far too costly. In this relief, the two principal figures, the stern and courageous pope and the dismayed and frightened <a href="Attila">Attila</a>, surge forward from the center into three dimensions. Only they two see the descending angelic warriors rallying to the pope's defense, while all others in the background reliefs, persist in performing their respective earthly duties.

The subject was apt for a papal state seeking clout, since it depicts the historical legend when the greatest of the popes Leo, with supernatural aid, deterred the Huns from looting Rome. From a <a href="baroque">baroque</a> standpoint it is a moment of divine intervention in the affairs of man. No doubt part of his patron's message would be that all viewers would be sternly reminded of the papal capacity to invoke divine retribution against enemies.

Algardi died in Rome within a year of completing his famous relief, which was admired by contemporaries.

In his later years Algardi controlled a large studio and amassed a great fortune. Algardi's classicizing manner was carried on by pupils (including <a href="Ercole%20Ferrata">Ercole Ferrata</a> and <a href="Domenico%20Guidi">Domenico Guidi</a>). <a href="Antonio%20Raggi">Antonio Raggi</a> initially trained with him. The latter two completed his design for an altarpiece of the "Vision of Saint Nicholas" (<a href="San%20Nicola%20da%20Tolentino%2C%20Rome">San Nicola da Tolentino, Rome</a>) using two separate marble pieces linked together in one event and place, yet successfully separating the divine and earthly spheres. Other lesser known assistants from his studio include <a href="Francesco%20Barrata">Francesco Barrata</a>, <a href="Girolamo%20Lucenti">Girolamo Lucenti</a>, and <a href="Giuseppe%20Peroni">Giuseppe Peroni</a>.

Algardi was also known for his portraiture which shows an obsessive attention to details of psychologically revealing <a href="physiognomy">physiognomy</a> in a sober but immediate <a href="Naturalism%20%28visual%20art%29">naturalism</a>, and minute attention to costume and draperies, such as in the busts of <a href="Laudivio%20Zacchia">Laudivio Zacchia</a>, Camillo Pamphilj, and of Muzio Frangipane and his two sons Lello and Roberto.

In temperament, his style was more akin to the classicized and restrained baroque of <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Duquesnoy">Duquesnoy</a> than to the emotive works of other baroque artists. From an artistic point of view, he was most successful in portrait-statues and groups of children, where he was obliged to follow nature most closely. His terracotta models, some of them finished works of art, were prized by collectors. An outstanding series of terracotta models is at the <a href="Hermitage%20Museum">Hermitage Museum</a>, <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>.

Alger of Liège

Alger of Liège (1055–1131), known also as Alger of Cluny and Algerus Magister, was a learned <a href="clergyman">clergyman</a> from <a href="Li%C3%A8ge%20%28city%29">Liège</a> author of several notable works.

Algiers

Algiers (, "al-Jazā’er"; <a href="Algerian%20Arabic">Algerian Arabic</a> pronunciation: دزاير Dzayer, , ) is the <a href="Capital%20%28political%29">capital</a> and largest city of <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>. In 2011, the city's population was estimated to be around 3,500,000. An estimate puts the population of the larger metropolitan city to be around 5,000,000. Algiers is located on the Mediterranean Sea and in the north-central portion of Algeria.

Sometimes nicknamed "El-Behdja" (البهجة) or alternatively "Alger la Blanche" ("Algiers the White") for the glistening white of its buildings as seen rising up from the sea, Algiers is situated on the west side of a bay of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. The modern part of the city is built on the level ground by the seashore; the old part, the ancient city of the <a href="dey">dey</a>s, climbs the steep hill behind the modern town and is crowned by the <a href="Kasbah">casbah</a> or citadel, above the sea. The casbah and the two quays form a triangle.

The city name is derived (via <a href="French%20language">French</a> "Alger" and <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a> "Alger") from the Arabic name الجزائر "al-Jazā’ir", which translates as "The Islands", referring to the four islands which used to lie off the city's coast until becoming part of the mainland in 1525. "Al-Jazā’ir" is itself a truncated form of the city's older name جزائر بني مزغانة "Jaza'ir Bani Mazghana", "The Islands of the <a href="Banu%20Mazghanna">Sons of Mazghana</a>", used by early medieval geographers such as <a href="al-Idrisi">al-Idrisi</a> and <a href="Yaqut%20al-Hamawi">Yaqut al-Hamawi</a>.

A <a href="Phoenicians">Phoenician</a> commercial outpost called "Ikosim" which later developed into a small <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> town called "<a href="Icosium">Icosium</a>" existed on what is now the marine quarter of the city. The "rue de la Marine" follows the lines of what used to be a Roman street. Roman cemeteries existed near "<a href="Bab-el-Oued">Bab-el-Oued</a>" and "<a href="Bab%20Azoun">Bab Azoun</a>". The city was given <a href="Latin%20citizenship">Latin</a> rights by Emperor <a href="Vespasian">Vespasian</a>. The <a href="bishop">bishop</a>s of Icosium are mentioned as late as the 5th century.

The present-day city was founded in 944 by <a href="Bologhine%20ibn%20Ziri">Bologhine ibn Ziri</a>, the founder of the <a href="Berber%20people">Berber</a> <a href="Zirid">Zirid</a>–<a href="Sanhaja">Sanhaja</a> dynasty. He had earlier (935) built his own house and a <a href="Sanhaja">Sanhaja</a> center at Ashir, just south of Algiers. Although his Zirid dynasty was overthrown by <a href="Roger%20II%20of%20Sicily">Roger II of Sicily</a> in 1148, the Zirids had already lost control of Algiers to their cousins the <a href="Hammadid">Hammadid</a>s in 1014. The city was wrested from the Hammadids by the <a href="Almohads">Almohads</a> in 1159, and in the 13th century came under the dominion of the <a href="Ziyanid">Ziyanid</a> sultans of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Tlemcen">Tlemcen</a>. Nominally part of the sultanate of Tlemcen, Algiers had a large measure of independence under <a href="amir">amir</a>s of its own due to <a href="Oran">Oran</a> being the chief seaport of the Ziyanids.

As early as 1302 the islet of Peñón in front of Algiers harbour had been occupied by Spaniards. Thereafter, a considerable amount of trade began to flow between Algiers and <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. However, Algiers continued to be of comparatively little importance until after the <a href="Reconquista%23Conversions%20and%20expulsions">expulsion of the Moors</a> from Spain, many of whom sought asylum in the city. In 1510, following their occupation of Oran and other towns on the coast of Africa, the Spaniards fortified the islet of Peñon and imposed a levy intended to suppress <a href="Barbary%20corsairs">corsair</a> activity.

In 1516, the amir of Algiers, Selim b. Teumi, invited the corsair brothers <a href="Aruj">Aruj</a> and <a href="Barbarossa%20%28Ottoman%20admiral%29">Hayreddin "Barbarossa"</a> to expel the Spaniards. Aruj came to Algiers, ordered the assassination of Selim, and seized the town and ousted the Spanish in the <a href="Capture%20of%20Algiers%20%281516%29">Capture of Algiers (1516)</a>. Hayreddin, succeeding Aruj after the latter was killed in battle against the Spaniards in the <a href="Fall%20of%20Tlemcen%20%281517%29">Fall of Tlemcen (1517)</a>, was the founder of the "<a href="pashaluk">pashaluk</a>", which subsequently became the "<a href="bey">bey</a>lik", of Algeria. Barbarossa lost Algiers in 1524 but regained it with the <a href="Capture%20of%20Algiers%20%281529%29">Capture of Algiers (1529)</a>, and then formally invited the Sultan <a href="Suleiman%20the%20Magnificent">Suleiman the Magnificent</a> to accept sovereignty over the territory and to annex Algiers to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>.

Algiers from this time became the chief seat of the <a href="Barbary%20pirates">Barbary pirates</a>. In October 1541 in the <a href="Algiers%20expedition%20%281541%29">Algiers expedition</a>, the King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a> sought to capture the city, but a storm destroyed a great number of his ships, and his army of some 30,000, chiefly made up of Spaniards, was defeated by the Algerians under their <a href="Pasha">Pasha</a>, Hassan.

Formally part of the Ottoman Empire but essentially free from Ottoman control, starting in the 16th century Algiers turned to piracy and ransoming. Due to its location on the periphery of both the Ottoman and European economic spheres, and depending for its existence on a Mediterranean that was increasingly controlled by European shipping, backed by European navies, piracy became the primary economic activity. Repeated attempts were made by various nations to subdue the pirates that disturbed shipping in the western Mediterranean and engaged in slave raids as far north as Iceland. The <a href="United%20States">United States</a> fought two wars (the <a href="First%20Barbary%20War">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Barbary%20War">Second Barbary War</a>s) over Algiers' attacks on shipping.

Among the notable people held for ransom was the future Spanish novelist <a href="Miguel%20de%20Cervantes">Miguel de Cervantes</a>, who was captive in Algiers almost five years, and who wrote two plays set in Algiers of the period. The primary source for knowledge of Algiers of this period, since there are no contemporary local sources, is the "Topografía e historia general de Argel" (1612, but written earlier), published by Diego de Haedo, but whose authorship is disputed. This work describes in detail the city, the behavior of its inhabitants, and its military defenses, with the unsuccessful hope of facilitating an attack by Spain so as to end the piracy.

A significant number of renegades lived in Algiers at the time, Christians converted voluntarily to <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, many fleeing the law or other problems at home. Once converted to Islam, they were safe in Algiers. Many occupied positions of authority, such as <a href="Samson%20Rowlie">Samson Rowlie</a>, an Englishman who became Treasurer of Algiers.

The city under Ottoman control was enclosed by a wall on all sides, including along the seafront. In this wall, five gates allowed access to the city, with five roads from each gate dividing the city and meeting in front of the Ketchaoua Mosque. In 1556, a citadel was constructed at the highest point in the wall. A major road running north to south divided the city in two: The upper city (al-Gabal, or 'the mountain') which consisted of about fifty small quarters of <a href="Andalusian%20people">Andalusian</a>, <a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish, <a href="Moors">Moorish</a> and <a href="Kabyle%20people">Kabyle</a> communities, and the lower city (al-Wata, or 'the plains') which was the administrative, military and commercial centre of the city, mostly inhabited by Turkish dignitaries and other upper-class families.

In August 1816, the city was bombarded by a British squadron under <a href="Edward%20Pellew%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Exmouth">Lord Exmouth</a> (a descendant of Thomas Pellew, taken in an Algerian slave raid in 1715), assisted by <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> men-of-war, destroying the corsair fleet harboured in Algiers.

The history of Algiers from 1830 to 1962 is bound to the larger history of <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a> and its relationship to <a href="France">France</a>. On July 4, 1830, under the pretext of an affront to the French consul—whom the <a href="dey">dey</a> had hit with a <a href="fly-whisk">fly-whisk</a> when the consul said the French government was not prepared to pay its large outstanding debts to two Algerian merchants—a French army under <a href="Louis-Auguste-Victor%2C%20Count%20de%20Ghaisnes%20de%20Bourmont">General de Bourmont</a> attacked the city in the <a href="invasion%20of%20Algiers%20in%201830">1830 invasion of Algiers</a>. The city capitulated the following day. Algiers became the capital of <a href="French%20Algeria">French Algeria</a>.

Many Europeans settled in Algiers, and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the city's population. During the 1930s, the architect <a href="Le%20Corbusier">Le Corbusier</a> drew up plans for a complete redesign of the colonial city. Le Corbusier was highly critical of the urban style of Algiers, describing the European district as "nothing but crumbling walls and devastated nature, the whole a sullied blot". He also criticised the difference in living standards he perceived between the European and African residents of the city, describing a situation in which "the 'civilised' live like rats in holes" whereas "the 'barbarians' live in solitude, in well-being". However, these plans were ultimately ignored by the French administration.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Algiers was the last city to be seized from the Germans by the Allies during <a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a>.
In 1962, after a bloody independence struggle in which hundreds of thousands (estimates range between 350,000 and 1,500,000) died (mostly Algerians but also French and <a href="Pied-Noir">Pieds-Noirs</a>) during fighting between the <a href="French%20Army">French Army</a> and the Algerian <a href="National%20Liberation%20Front%20%28Algeria%29">Front de Libération Nationale</a>, Algeria gained its independence, with Algiers as its capital. Since then, despite losing its entire "<a href="pied-noir">pied-noir</a>" population, the city has expanded massively. It now has about five million inhabitants, or 10 percent of Algeria's population—and its suburbs now cover most of the surrounding <a href="Geography%20of%20Algeria">Mitidja</a> plain.

Algiers also played a pivotal role in the <a href="Algerian%20War">Algerian War</a> (1954–1962), particularly during the <a href="Algerian%20War%23Battle%20of%20Algiers">Battle of Algiers</a> when the 10th Parachute Division of the French Army, starting on January 7, 1957, and on the orders of then French Minister of Justice <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mitterrand">François Mitterrand</a> (who authorized any means "to eliminate the insurrectionists"), led attacks against the Algerian fighters for independence. Algiers remains marked by this battle, which was characterized by merciless fighting between FLN forces which carried out a guerrilla campaign against the French military and police and pro-French Algerian soldiers, and the French Army which responded with a bloody repression, torture and blanket terrorism against the native population. The demonstrations of May 13 during the crisis of 1958 provoked the fall of the <a href="French%20Fourth%20Republic">Fourth Republic</a> in France, as well as the return of General <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">de Gaulle</a> to power.

Algeria achieved <a href="independence">independence</a> on July 5, 1962. Run by the FLN that had secured independence, Algiers became a member of <a href="Non-Aligned%20Movement">Non-Aligned Movement</a> during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. In October 1988, one year before the fall of the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a>, Algiers was the site of demonstrations demanding the end of the single party system and the creation of a "real" <a href="democracy">democracy</a> baptized the "Spring of Algier". The demonstrators were repressed by the authorities (more than 300 dead), but the movement constituted a turning point in the political history of modern Algeria. In 1989, a new constitution was adopted that put an end to the one-party rule and saw the creation of more than fifty political parties, as well as official freedom of the press.

The city became the theatre of many political demonstrations of all descriptions until 1992. In 1991, a political entity dominated by religious conservatives called the <a href="Islamic%20Salvation%20Front">Islamic Salvation Front</a> engaged in a political test of wills with the authorities. In the 1992 elections for the Algerian National Assembly, the Islamists garnered a large amount of support in the first round, helped by a massive abstention from disillusioned Algerian voters by the turn of events. Fearing an eventual win by the Islamists, the army cancelled the election process, setting off a <a href="Algerian%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> between the State and armed religious conservatives which would last for a decade.

On December 11, 2007, two car <a href="11%20December%202007%20Algiers%20bombings">bombs exploded in Algiers</a>. One bomb targeted two United Nations buildings and the other targeted a government building housing the Supreme Court. The death toll was at least 62, with over two hundred injured in the attacks. However, only 26 remained hospitalized the following day. , it is speculated that the attack was carried out by the Al Qaida cell within the city.

Indigenous terrorist groups have been actively <a href="Islamic%20insurgency%20in%20Algeria%20%282002%E2%80%93present%29%232007">operating in Algeria since around 2002</a>.

Algiers has a <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> "Csa"). Its proximity to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> aids in moderating the city's temperatures. As a result, Algiers usually does not see the extreme temperatures that are experienced in the adjacent interior deserts. Algiers on average receives roughly of rain per year, the bulk of which is seen between October and April. The precipitation is very similar to coastal mediterranean <a href="Spain">Spain</a> as opposed to the interior North African arid climate.

Snow is very rare; in 2012, the city received , its first snowfall in eight years.

There are many public buildings of interest, including the whole <a href="Kasbah">Kasbah</a> quarter, Martyrs Square ("Sahat ech-Chouhada" ساحة الشهداء), the government offices (formerly the <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> consulate), the "Grand", "New", and Ketchaoua <a href="Mosque">Mosque</a>s, the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> cathedral of <a href="Notre%20Dame%20d%27Afrique">Notre Dame d'Afrique</a>, the <a href="Bardo%20National%20Museum%20of%20Prehistory%20and%20Ethnography">Bardo Museum</a> (a former Turkish mansion), the old "Bibliothèque Nationale d'Alger"—a <a href="Turkey">Turkish</a> palace built in 1799–1800—and the new <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Algeria">National Library</a>, built in a style reminiscent of the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>.

The main building in the Kasbah was begun in 1516 on the site of an older building, and served as the palace of the deys until the French conquest. A road has been cut through the centre of the building, the mosque turned into <a href="barracks">barracks</a>, and the hall of audience allowed to fall into ruin. There still remain a <a href="minaret">minaret</a> and some marble arches and columns. Traces exist of the vaults in which were stored the treasures of the dey.

The <a href="Great%20Mosque%20of%20Algiers">Great Mosque</a> ("Jamaa-el-Kebir" الجامع الكبير) is the oldest mosque in Algiers. It was first built by <a href="Yusuf%20ibn%20Tashfin">Yusuf ibn Tashfin</a>, but reconstructed many times. The pulpit ("<a href="minbar">minbar</a>" منبر) bears an inscription showing that the building existed in 1097. The minaret was built by the sultan of <a href="Tlemcen">Tlemcen</a>, in 1324. The interior of the mosque is square and is divided into aisles by columns joined by <a href="Moors">Moorish</a> arches.

The New Mosque ("Jamaa-el-Jedid" الجامع الجديد), dating from the 17th century, is in the form of a <a href="Greek%20cross">Greek cross</a>, surmounted by a large white cupola, with four small cupolas at the corners. The minaret is high. The interior resembles that of the Grand Mosque.

The church of the Holy Trinity (built in 1870) stands at the southern end of the "rue d'Isly" near the site of the demolished Fort Bab Azoun باب عزون. The interior is richly decorated with various coloured marbles. Many of these marbles contain memorial inscriptions relating to the British residents (voluntary and involuntary) of Algiers from the time of John Tipton, the first English consul, in 1580 (NB Some sources give 1585). One tablet records that in 1631 two Algerine pirate crews landed in <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a>, sacked <a href="Baltimore%2C%20County%20Cork">Baltimore</a>, and enslaved its inhabitants.

The Ketchaoua mosque ("Djamaa Ketchaoua" جامع كتشاوة), at the foot of the Casbah, was before independence in 1962 the cathedral of St Philippe, itself made in 1845 from a mosque dating from 1612. The principal entrance, reached by a flight of 23 steps, is ornamented with a <a href="portico">portico</a> supported by four black-veined marble columns. The roof of the nave is of <a href="Moorish%20Empire">Moorish</a> <a href="plaster">plaster</a> work. It rests on a series of arcades supported by white marble columns. Several of these columns belonged to the original mosque. In one of the chapels was a tomb containing the bones of <a href="San%20Geronimo">San Geronimo</a>. The building seems a curious blend of Moorish and <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> styles.

Algiers possesses a college with schools of law, medicine, science and letters. The college buildings are large and handsome. The <a href="Bardo%20National%20Museum">Bardo Museum</a> in <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a> holds some of the ancient sculptures and mosaics discovered in Algeria, together with medals and Algerian money.

The port of Algiers is sheltered from all winds. There are two harbours, both artificial—the old or northern harbour and the southern or Agha harbour. The northern harbour covers an area of . An opening in the south <a href="jetty">jetty</a> affords an entrance into Agha harbour, constructed in Agha Bay. Agha harbour has also an independent entrance on its southern side. The inner harbour was begun in 1518 by <a href="Khair-ad-Din%20Barbarossa">Khair-ad-Din Barbarossa</a> (see History, below), who, to accommodated his pirate vessels, caused the island on which was Fort Penon to be connected with the mainland by a <a href="mole%20%28architecture%29">mole</a>. The lighthouse which occupies the site of <a href="Fort%20Penon">Fort Penon</a> was built in 1544.

Algiers was a walled city from the time of the deys until the close of the 19th century. The French, after their occupation of the city (1830), built a <a href="Defensive%20wall">rampart</a>, <a href="parapet">parapet</a> and <a href="ditch%20%28fortification%29">ditch</a>, with two terminal forts, <a href="Bab%20Azoun">Bab Azoun</a> باب عزون to the south and <a href="Bab-el-Oued">Bab-el-Oued</a> اد to the north. The forts and part of the ramparts were demolished at the beginning of the 20th century, when a line of forts occupying the heights of <a href="Bouzareah">Bouzareah</a> بوزريعة (at an elevation of above the sea) took their place.

<a href="Notre%20Dame%20d%27Afrique">Notre Dame d'Afrique</a>, a church built (1858–1872) in a mixture of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> and <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> styles, is conspicuously situated overlooking the sea, on the shoulder of the <a href="Bouzareah">Bouzareah</a> hills, 
to the north of the city. Above the altar is a statue of the <a href="Mary%2C%20the%20mother%20of%20Jesus">Virgin</a> depicted as a black woman. The church also contains a solid silver statue of the <a href="archangel%20Michael">archangel Michael</a>, belonging to the confraternity of <a href="Naples">Neapolitan</a> fishermen.

<a href="Villa%20Abd-el-Tif">Villa Abd-el-Tif</a>, former residence of the <a href="dey">dey</a>, was used during the French period, to accommodate French artists, chiefly painters, and winners of the <a href="Abd-el-Tif%20prize">Abd-el-Tif prize</a>, among whom <a href="Maurice%20Boitel">Maurice Boitel</a>, for a while of two years. Nowadays, Algerian artists are back in the villa's studios.



Algiers has a population of about 3,335,418(2012 estimate).

The ethnic distribution is 53% from an Arabic-speaking background, 44% from a Berber-speaking background and 3% foreign-born.

Algiers is an important economic, commercial and financial center, with in particular a stock exchange with a capitalisation of 60 million euros. The city has the highest cost of living of any city in <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, as well as the 50th highest worldwide, as of March 2007, having gained one position compared to the previous year.

Mohamed Ben Ali El Abbar, president of the Council of Administration of the Emirate Group EMAAR, presented five "megaprojects" to Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, during a ceremony which took place Saturday, July 15, within the Palace of the People of Algiers. These projects will transform the city of Algiers and its surroundings by equipping them with a retail area and restoration and leisure facilities.

The first project will concentrate on the reorganization and the development of the infrastructures of the railway station "Aga" located in the downtown area. The ultramodern station intended to accommodate more than 80.000 passengers per day, will become a center of circulation in the heart of the grid system, surrounded by commercial offices and buildings and hotels intended for travelers in transit. A shopping centre and three high-rise office buildings rising with the top of the commercial zone will accompany the project.

The second project will not relate to the bay of Algiers and aims to revitalize the sea front. The development of the sea front will include marinas, channels, luxury hotels, offices, apartments of great standing, luxury stores and leisure amenities. A crescent-shaped peninsula will be set up on the open sea. The project of the bay of Algiers will also comprise six small islands, of which four of round form, connected to each other by bridges and marinas and will include tourist and residential complexes.

The third project will relate to restructuring an area of Algiers, qualified by the originators of the project of "city of wellness". El Abbar indicated to the journalists that the complex would be "agreeable for all those which will want to combine tourism and well-being or tourism and relaxation". The complex will include a university, a research center and a medical centre. It should also include a hospital complex, a care centre, a hotel zone, an urban centre and a thermal spa with villas and apartments. The university will include a medical school and a school for care male nurses which will be able to accommodate 500 students. The university campus will have the possibility of seeing setting up broad ranges of buildings of research laboratories and residences.

Another project relates to technological implantation of a campus in Sidi Abdellah, south-east from Algiers. This site will include shopping centres, residential zones with high standard apartments and a golf course surrounded by villas and hotels. Two other residential zones, including 1.800 apartments and 40 high standard villas, will be built on the surrounding hills.

The fifth project is that of the tourist complex Colonel Abbès, which will be located west from Algiers. This complex will include several retail zones, meeting places, and residential zones composed of apartments and villas with views of the sea.

Currently there is another project under construction, by the name of Algiers Medina. The first step of the project is nearly complete.

A <a href="Hewlett%20Packard">Hewlett Packard</a> office for French-speaking countries in Africa is in Algiers.

Ibn al-Haytham

Ibn al-Haytham (also known by the <a href="Latinization%20of%20names">Latinization</a> Alhazen or Alhacen, full name ""  ) was a <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> <a href="scientist">scientist</a>, <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a>, <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a>, and <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a>. Ibn al-Haytham made significant contributions to the principles of <a href="optics">optics</a>, <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="visual%20perception">visual perception</a>. He has been dubbed the "father of optics". 
He was the first to explain that vision occurs when light bounces on an object and then is directed to one's eyes. He spent most of his life close to the court of the <a href="Fatimid%20Caliphate">Fatimid Caliphate</a> in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> and earned his living authoring various treatises and tutoring members of the nobilities.

Ibn al-Haytham is widely considered to be one of the first <a href="List%20of%20theoretical%20physicists">theoretical physicists</a>, and an early proponent of the concept that a hypothesis must be proved by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical evidence—hence understanding the <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a> five centuries before <a href="History%20of%20science%20in%20the%20Renaissance">Renaissance scientists</a>.

In <a href="medieval%20Europe">medieval Europe</a>, Ibn al-Haytham <a href="scholastic%20accolades">was honored</a> as (the "Second <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>") or simply called "The Physicist". He is also sometimes called "al-Baṣrī" after his birthplace, <a href="Basra">Basra</a> in <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, or "al-Miṣrī" ("of Egypt").

Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) was born c. 965 in <a href="Basra">Basra</a>, which was then part of the <a href="Buyid%20dynasty">Buyid emirate</a>, to an Arab family.
Alhazen arrived in Cairo under the reign of <a href="Fatimid%20Caliphate">Fatimid</a> Caliph <a href="Al-Hakim%20bi-Amr%20Allah">al-Hakim</a>, a patron of the sciences who was particularly interested in astronomy. He proposed to the Caliph a <a href="Hydraulic%20empire">hydraulic project</a> to improve regulation of the <a href="flooding%20of%20the%20Nile">flooding of the Nile</a>, a task requiring an early attempt at building a <a href="dam">dam</a> at the present site of the <a href="Aswan%20Dam">Aswan Dam</a>, but later his field work convinced him of the technical impracticality of this scheme. Alhazen continued to live in Cairo, in the neighborhood of the famous <a href="al-Azhar%20University">University of al-Azhar</a>, until his death in 1040. Legend has it that after deciding the scheme was impractical and fearing the <a href="caliph">caliph</a>'s anger, Alhazen <a href="feigned%20madness">feigned madness</a> and was kept under <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a> from 1011 until al-Hakim's death in 1021. During this time, he wrote his influential "<a href="Book%20of%20Optics">Book of Optics</a>" and continued to write further treatises on astronomy, geometry, <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>, optics and natural philosophy.

Among his students were Sorkhab (Sohrab), a <a href="Persian%20people">Persian</a> from <a href="Semnan%20%28city%29">Semnan</a> who was his student for over three years, and Abu al-Wafa Mubashir ibn Fatek"," an <a href="Egyptians">Egyptian</a> prince who learned mathematics from Alhazen.

Alhazen's most famous work is his seven-volume treatise on <a href="optics">optics</a> "Kitab al-Manazir" ("Book of Optics"), written from 1011 to 1021.

"Optics" was <a href="Latin%20translations%20of%20the%2012th%20century">translated into Latin</a> by an unknown scholar at the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century. It was printed by <a href="Friedrich%20Risner">Friedrich Risner</a> in 1572, with the title "Opticae thesaurus: Alhazeni Arabis libri septem, nuncprimum editi; Eiusdem liber De Crepusculis et nubium ascensionibus" (English : Thesaurus of Optics: seven books of the Arab Alhazeni, first edition: concerning twilight and the advancement of clouds). Risner is also the author of the name variant "Alhazen"; before Risner he was known in the west as Alhacen, which is the correct transcription of the Arabic name. This work enjoyed a great reputation during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. Works by Alhazen on geometric subjects were discovered in the <a href="Biblioth%C3%A8que%20nationale">Bibliothèque nationale</a> in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> in 1834 by E. A. Sedillot. In all, A. Mark Smith has accounted for 18 full or near-complete manuscripts, and five fragments, which are preserved in 14 locations, including one in the <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a> at <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, and one in the library of <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a>.

Two major theories on vision prevailed in <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a>. The first theory, the <a href="Emission%20theory%20%28vision%29">emission theory</a>, was supported by such thinkers as <a href="Euclid">Euclid</a> and <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, who believed that sight worked by the <a href="eye">eye</a> emitting <a href="Ray%20%28optics%29">rays</a> of <a href="light">light</a>. The second theory, the intromission theory supported by <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and his followers, had physical forms entering the eye from an object. Previous Islamic writers (such as <a href="al-Kindi">al-Kindi</a>) had argued essentially on Euclidean, Galenist, or Aristotelian lines. The strongest influence on the "Book of Optics" was from Ptolemy's <a href="Ptolemy%23Optics">"Optics"</a>, while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on Galen's account. Alhazen's achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of Euclid, the medical tradition of <a href="Galen">Galen</a>, and the intromission theories of Aristotle. Alhazen's intromission theory followed al-Kindi (and broke with Aristotle) in asserting that "from each point of every colored body, illuminated by any light, issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point". This however left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation; in particular, every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye. What Alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye. He attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object—for any one point on the eye only saw the ray that reached it directly, without being refracted by any other part of the eye, would be perceived. He argued using a physical analogy that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays; in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board, whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off, perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays, and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye. As there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point, and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone, this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye; if only the perpendicular ray mattered, then he had a one-to-one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved. He later asserted (in book seven of the "Optics") that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived "as if" perpendicular.

His arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why "only" perpendicular rays were perceived; why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly? His later argument that refracted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive. However, despite its weaknesses, no other theory of the time was so comprehensive, and it was enormously influential, particularly in Western Europe: Directly or indirectly, his "De Aspectibus" inspired much activity in optics between the 13th and 17th centuries. <a href="Kepler">Kepler</a>'s later theory of the <a href="retina">retina</a>l image (which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye) built directly on the conceptual framework of Alhazen.

Alhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines, and carried out various experiments with <a href="lens%20%28optics%29">lenses</a>, <a href="mirror">mirror</a>s, <a href="refraction">refraction</a>, and <a href="Reflection%20%28physics%29">reflection</a>. His analyses of reflection and refraction considered the vertical and horizontal components of light rays separately.

The <a href="camera%20obscura">camera obscura</a> was known to the <a href="History%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology%20in%20China">ancient Chinese</a>, and was described by the <a href="Han%20Chinese">Han Chinese</a> <a href="polymath">polymath</a>ic <a href="genius">genius</a> <a href="Shen%20Kuo">Shen Kuo</a> in his scientific book "<a href="Dream%20Pool%20Essays">Dream Pool Essays</a>", published in the year 1088 C.E.. Aristotle had discussed the basic principle behind it in his "Problems", however Alhazen's work also contained the first clear description, outside of <a href="History%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology%20in%20China">China</a>, of <a href="camera%20obscura">camera obscura</a> in the areas of the <a href="middle%20east">middle east</a>, <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="India">India</a>. and early analysis of the device.

Alhazen studied the process of sight, the structure of the eye, image formation in the eye, and the <a href="visual%20system">visual system</a>. Ian P. Howard argued in a 1996 "<a href="Perception%20%28journal%29">Perception</a>" article that Alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories previously attributed to Western Europeans writing centuries later. For example, he described what became in the 19th century <a href="Hering%27s%20law%20of%20equal%20innervation">Hering's law of equal innervation</a>. He wrote a description of vertical <a href="horopter">horopter</a>s 600 years before <a href="Aguilonius">Aguilonius</a> that is actually closer to the modern definition than Aguilonius's—and his work on <a href="binocular%20disparity">binocular disparity</a> was repeated by Panum in 1858. Craig Aaen-Stockdale, while agreeing that Alhazen should be credited with many advances, has expressed some caution, especially when considering Alhazen in isolation from <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>, who Alhazen was extremely familiar with. Alhazen corrected a significant error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision, but otherwise his account is very similar; Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Hering's law. In general, Alhazen built on and expanded the optics of Ptolemy. In a more detailed account of Ibn al-Haytham's contribution to the study of binocular vision based on Lejeune and Sabra, Raynaud showed that the concepts of correspondence, homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in Ibn al-Haytham's optics. But contrary to Howard, he explained why Ibn al-Haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why, by reasoning experimentally, he was in fact closer to the discovery of Panum's fusional area than that of the Vieth-Müller circle. In this regard, Ibn al-Haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limits: the lack of recognition of the role of the retina, and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts.

Alhazen's most original contribution was that after describing how he thought the eye was anatomically constructed, he went on to consider how this anatomy would behave functionally as an optical system. His understanding of pinhole projection from his experiments appears to have influenced his consideration of image inversion in the eye, which he sought to avoid. He maintained that the rays that fell perpendicularly on the lens (or glacial humor as he called it) were further refracted outward as they left the glacial humor and the resulting image thus passed upright into the optic nerve at the back of the eye. He followed <a href="Galen">Galen</a> in believing that the <a href="Lens%20%28anatomy%29">lens</a> was the receptive organ of sight, although some of his work hints that he thought the <a href="retina">retina</a> was also involved.

Alhazen's synthesis of light and vision adhered to the Aristotelian scheme, exhaustively describing the process of vision in a logical, complete fashion.

An aspect associated with Alhazen's optical research is related to systemic and methodological reliance on experimentation ("i'tibar")(Arabic: إعتبار) and <a href="Scientific%20control">controlled testing</a> in his scientific inquiries. Moreover, his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics ("ilm tabi'i") with mathematics ("ta'alim"; geometry in particular). This mathematical-physical approach to experimental science supported most of his propositions in "Kitab al-Manazir" ("The Optics"; "De aspectibus" or "Perspectivae") and grounded his theories of vision, light and colour, as well as his research in catoptrics and <a href="dioptrics">dioptrics</a> (the study of the reflection and refraction of light, respectively). 

According to Matthias Schramm, Alhazen "was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner, in an experiment showing that the intensity of the light-spot formed by the projection of the <a href="moonlight">moonlight</a> through two small <a href="apertures">apertures</a> onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up." G. J. Toomer expressed some skepticism regarding Schramm's view, arguing that caution is needed to avoid reading anachronistically particular passages in Alhazen's very large body of work, because at the time (1964), his "Book of Optics" had not yet been fully translated from Arabic. While acknowledging Alhazen's importance in developing experimental techniques, Toomer argued that Alhazen should not be considered in isolation from other Islamic and ancient thinkers. Toomer does concede that "Schramm sums up [Alhazen's] achievement in the development of scientific method."

Mark Smith recounts Alhazen's elaboration of Ptolemy's experiments in double vision, reflection, and refraction: Alhazen's "Optics" book influenced the Perspectivists in Europe, Roger Bacon, Witelo, and Peckham. "The Optics" was incorporated into Risner's 1572 printing of "Opticae Thesaurus", through which Kepler finally resolved the contradictions inherent in <a href="Witelo">Witelo</a>'s explanation of the imaging chain, from external object to the retina of the eye.

His work on <a href="catoptrics">catoptrics</a> in Book V of the Book of Optics contains a discussion of what is now known as Alhazen's problem, first formulated by <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> in 150 AD. It comprises drawing lines from two points in the <a href="plane%20%28mathematics%29">plane</a> of a circle meeting at a point on the <a href="circumference">circumference</a> and making equal angles with the <a href="Normal%20%28geometry%29">normal</a> at that point. This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular <a href="billiard%20table">billiard table</a> at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point. Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, "Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer." This leads to an <a href="Quartic%20equation">equation of the fourth degree</a>. This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of <a href="fourth%20power">fourth power</a>s, where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated. His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers, although he did not himself do this (perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in). He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an <a href="Integral">integration</a>, where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a <a href="paraboloid">paraboloid</a>. Alhazen eventually solved the problem using <a href="conic%20section">conic section</a>s and a geometric proof. His solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in Latin translation. Later mathematicians used <a href="Descartes">Descartes</a>' analytical methods to analyse the problem, with a new solution being found in 1997 by the Oxford mathematician <a href="Peter%20M.%20Neumann">Peter M. Neumann</a>. Recently, <a href="Mitsubishi%20Electric%20Research%20Laboratories">Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories</a> (MERL) researchers Amit Agrawal, Yuichi Taguchi and Srikumar Ramalingam solved the extension of Alhazen's problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptical mirrors. They showed that the mirror reflection point can be computed by solving an eighth degree equation in the most general case. If the camera (eye) is placed on the axis of the mirror, the degree of the equation reduces to six. Alhazen's problem can also be extended to multiple refractions from a spherical ball. Given a light source and a spherical ball of certain refractive index, the closest point on the spherical ball where the light is refracted to the eye of the observer can be obtained by solving a tenth degree equation.

 The Kitab al-Manazir (Book of Optics) describes several experimental observations that Alhazen made and how he used his results to explain certain optical phenomena using mechanical analogies. He conducted experiments with <a href="projectile">projectile</a>s and concluded that only the impact of <a href="perpendicular">perpendicular</a> projectiles on surfaces was forceful enough to make them penetrate, whereas surfaces tended to deflect <a href="Oblique%20angle">oblique</a> projectile strikes. For example, to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet. A perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through, whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not. He also used this result to explain how intense, direct light hurts the eye, using a mechanical analogy: Alhazen associated 'strong' lights with perpendicular rays and 'weak' lights with oblique ones. The obvious answer to the problem of multiple rays and the eye was in the choice of the perpendicular ray, since only one such ray from each point on the surface of the object could penetrate the eye.

Sudanese psychologist Omar Khaleefa has argued that Alhazen should be considered the founder of <a href="experimental%20psychology">experimental psychology</a>, for his pioneering work on the psychology of visual perception and <a href="optical%20illusion">optical illusion</a>s. Khaleefa has also argued that Alhazen should also be considered the "founder of <a href="psychophysics">psychophysics</a>", a sub-discipline and precursor to modern psychology. Although Alhazen made many subjective reports regarding vision, there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and the claim has been rebuffed.

Alhazen offered an explanation of the <a href="Moon%20illusion">Moon illusion</a>, an illusion that played an important role in the scientific tradition of medieval Europe. Many authors repeated explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the Moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does when higher up in the sky. Alhazen argued against Ptolemy's refraction theory, and defined the problem in terms of perceived, rather than real, enlargement. He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. When the Moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects, so the Moon appears close. The perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance. Therefore, the Moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky, and further and larger on the horizon. Through works by <a href="Roger%20Bacon">Roger Bacon</a>, <a href="John%20Pecham">John Pecham</a> and Witelo based on Alhazen's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with the refraction theory being rejected in the 17th century. Although Alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation, he was not the first author to offer it. <a href="Cleomedes">Cleomedes</a> ( 2nd century) gave this account (in addition to refraction), and he credited it to <a href="Posidonius">Posidonius</a> ( 135-50 BC). Ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his "Optics", but the text is obscure. Alhazen's writings were more widely available in the Middle Ages than those of these earlier authors, and that probably explains why Alhazen received the credit.

Besides the "Book of Optics", Alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject, including his "Risala fi l-Daw’" ("Treatise on Light"). He investigated the properties of <a href="luminance">luminance</a>, the <a href="rainbow">rainbow</a>, <a href="eclipse">eclipse</a>s, twilight, and <a href="moonlight">moonlight</a>. Experiments with mirrors and <a href="Magnifying%20glass">magnifying lenses</a> provided the foundation for his theories on <a href="catoptrics">catoptrics</a>.

Alhazen discussed the <a href="physics">physics</a> of the celestial region in his "Epitome of Astronomy", arguing that Ptolemaic models must be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypotheses—in other words that it should be possible to create physical models where (for example) none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other. The suggestion of mechanical models for the Earth centred <a href="Ptolemaic%20model">Ptolemaic model</a> "greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the Ptolemaic system among the Christians of the West". Alhazen's determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important, however, because it meant astronomical hypotheses "were accountable to the <a href="Physical%20law">laws of physics</a>", and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms.

He also wrote "Maqala fi daw al-qamar" ("On the Light of the Moon").

In his work, Alhazen discussed theories on the <a href="Motion%20%28physics%29">motion</a> of a body. In his "Treatise on Place", Alhazen disagreed with <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s view that nature abhors a void, and he used <a href="geometry">geometry</a> in an attempt to demonstrate that place ("al-makan") is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.

In his "On the Configuration of the World" Alhazen presented a detailed description of the physical structure of the earth:

The book is a non-technical explanation of Ptolemy's <a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>, which was eventually translated into <a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> and <a href="Latin">Latin</a> in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as <a href="Georg%20von%20Peuerbach">Georg von Peuerbach</a> during the European <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> and <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>.

In his "Al-Shukūk ‛alā Batlamyūs", variously translated as "Doubts Concerning Ptolemy" or "Aporias against Ptolemy", published at some time between 1025 and 1028, Alhazen criticized <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>'s "Almagest", "Planetary Hypotheses", and "Optics", pointing out various contradictions he found in these works, particularly in astronomy. Ptolemy's "Almagest" concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets, whereas the "Hypotheses" concerned what Ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets. Ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other, arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error, but Alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in Ptolemy's works. He considered that some of the mathematical devices Ptolemy introduced into astronomy, especially the <a href="equant">equant</a>, failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion, and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles:

Having pointed out the problems, Alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in Ptolemy in a later work. Alhazen believed there was a "true configuration" of the planets that Ptolemy had failed to grasp. He intended to complete and repair Ptolemy's system, not to replace it completely. In the "Doubts Concerning Ptolemy" Alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories:

He held that the criticism of existing theories—which dominated this book—holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge.

Alhazen's "The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets" was written 1038. Only one damaged manuscript has been found, with only the introduction and the first section, on the theory of planetary motion, surviving. (There was also a second section on astronomical calculation, and a third section, on astronomical instruments.) Following on from his "Doubts on Ptolemy", Alhazen described a new, geometry-based planetary model, describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry, infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry. He kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular, which required the inclusion of <a href="epicycles">epicycles</a> to explain observed motion, but he managed to eliminate Ptolemy's <a href="equant">equant</a>. In general, his model didn't try to provide a causal explanation of the motions, but concentrated on providing a complete, geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy's model.

Alhazen wrote a total of twenty-five astronomical works, some concerning technical issues such as "Exact Determination of the Meridian", a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation, a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>; Alhazen argued for a distant location, based on the fact that it does not move in relation to the fixed stars. The fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory, including the "Doubts" and "Model of the Motions" discussed above.

In <a href="Islamic%20mathematics">mathematics</a>, Alhazen built on the mathematical works of <a href="Euclid">Euclid</a> and <a href="Thabit%20ibn%20Qurra">Thabit ibn Qurra</a> and worked on "the beginnings of the link between <a href="algebra">algebra</a> and <a href="geometry">geometry</a>."

He developed a formula for summing the first 100 natural numbers, using a geometric proof to prove the formula.

Alhazen explored what is now known as the <a href="Euclidean%20geometry">Euclidean</a> <a href="parallel%20postulate">parallel postulate</a>, the fifth <a href="Axiom">postulate</a> in <a href="Euclid%27s%20Elements">Euclid's "Elements"</a>, using a <a href="Reductio%20ad%20absurdum">proof by contradiction</a>, and in effect introducing the concept of motion into geometry. He formulated the <a href="Lambert%20quadrilateral">Lambert quadrilateral</a>, which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the "Ibn al-Haytham–Lambert quadrilateral".

In elementary geometry, Alhazen attempted to solve the problem of <a href="squaring%20the%20circle">squaring the circle</a> using the area of <a href="Lune%20%28mathematics%29">lune</a>s (crescent shapes), but later gave up on the impossible task. The two lunes formed from a <a href="right%20triangle">right triangle</a> by erecting a semicircle on each of the triangle's sides, inward for the hypotenuse and outward for the other two sides, are known as the <a href="Lune%20of%20Hippocrates">lunes of Alhazen</a>; they have the same total area as the triangle itself.

Alhazen's contributions to <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a> include his work on <a href="perfect%20number">perfect number</a>s. In his "Analysis and Synthesis", he may have been the first to state that every even perfect number is of the form 2(2 − 1) where 2 − 1 is <a href="Prime%20number">prime</a>, but he was not able to prove this result; <a href="Leonhard%20Euler">Euler</a> later proved it in the 18th century.

Alhazen solved problems involving <a href="congruence%20relation">congruences</a> using what is now called <a href="Wilson%27s%20theorem">Wilson's theorem</a>. In his "Opuscula", Alhazen considers the solution of a system of congruences, and gives two general methods of solution. His first method, the canonical method, involved Wilson's theorem, while his second method involved a version of the <a href="Chinese%20remainder%20theorem">Chinese remainder theorem</a>.

Alhazen discovered the sum formula for the fourth power, using a method that could be generally used to determine the sum for any integral power. He used this to find the volume of a <a href="paraboloid">paraboloid</a>. He could find the integral formula for any polynomial without having developed a general formula.

Alhazen also wrote a "Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals", although no copies have survived. It appears to have been concerned with the question of whether animals could react to music, for example whether a camel would increase or decrease its pace.

In <a href="Inventions%20in%20the%20Islamic%20world">engineering</a>, one account of his career as a <a href="civil%20engineer">civil engineer</a> has him summoned to Egypt by the Fatimid <a href="Caliph">Caliph</a>, <a href="Al-Hakim%20bi-Amr%20Allah">Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah</a>, to regulate the <a href="flooding">flooding</a> of the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> River. He carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual <a href="inundation">inundation</a> of the Nile River, and he drew plans for building a <a href="dam">dam</a>, at the site of the modern-day <a href="Aswan%20Dam">Aswan Dam</a>. His field work, however, later made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme, and he soon <a href="feigned%20madness">feigned madness</a> so he could avoid punishment from the Caliph.

In his "Treatise on Place", Alhazen disagreed with <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s view that nature abhors a <a href="Vacuum">void</a>, and he used <a href="geometry">geometry</a> in an attempt to demonstrate that place ("al-makan") is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body. <a href="Abd%20al-Latif%20al-Baghdadi%20%28medieval%20writer%29">Abd-el-latif</a>, a supporter of Aristotle's philosophical view of place, later criticized the work in "Fi al-Radd ‘ala Ibn al-Haytham fi al-makan" ("A refutation of Ibn al-Haytham’s place") for its geometrization of place.

Alhazen also discussed <a href="Depth%20perception">space perception</a> and its <a href="Epistemology">epistemological</a> implications in his "<a href="Book%20of%20Optics">Book of Optics</a>". In "tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhazen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for
correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things."

Alhazen was a devout <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>, though it is uncertain which branch of <a href="Islam">Islam</a> he followed. He may have been either a follower of the <a href="Ash%27ari">Ash'ari</a> school of <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni</a> <a href="Islamic%20theology">Islamic theology</a> according to <a href="Ziauddin%20Sardar">Ziauddin Sardar</a> and Lawrence Bettany (and opposed to the views of the <a href="Mu%27tazili">Mu'tazili</a> school), a follower of the Mu'tazili school of Islamic theology according to Peter Edward Hodgson, or a possibly follower of <a href="Shia%20Islam">Shia Islam</a> according to <a href="A.%20I.%20Sabra">A. I. Sabra</a>.

Alhazen wrote a work on Islamic theology in which he discussed <a href="prophet">prophet</a>hood and developed a system of philosophical criteria to discern its false claimants in his time. He also wrote a treatise entitled "Finding the Direction of Qibla by Calculation" in which he discussed finding the <a href="Qibla">Qibla</a>, where <a href="Salat">Salat</a> prayers are directed towards, mathematically.

He wrote in his "Doubts Concerning Ptolemy":

In "The Winding Motion", Alhazen further wrote:

Alhazen described his theology:

According to medieval biographers, Alhazen wrote more than 200 works on a wide range of subjects, of which at least 96 of his scientific works are known. Most of his works are now lost, but more than 50 of them have survived to some extent. Nearly half of his surviving works are on mathematics, 23 of them are on astronomy, and 14 of them are on optics, with a few on other subjects. Not all his surviving works have yet been studied, but some of the ones that have are given below.



Alhazen made significant contributions to optics, number theory, geometry, astronomy and natural philosophy. Alhazen's work on optics is credited with contributing a new emphasis on experiment.

His main work, "<a href="Book%20of%20Optics">Kitab al-Manazir</a>" ("Book of Optics"), was known in the <a href="Muslim%20world">Muslim world</a> mainly, but not exclusively, through the thirteenth-century commentary by <a href="Kam%C4%81l%20al-D%C4%ABn%20al-F%C4%81ris%C4%AB">Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī</a>, the "Tanqīḥ "al-Manāẓir" li-dhawī l-abṣār wa l-baṣā'ir". In <a href="al-Andalus">al-Andalus</a>, it was used by the eleventh-century prince of the <a href="Banu%20Hud">Banu Hud dynasty</a> of <a href="Zaragoza">Zaragossa</a> and author of an important mathematical text, <a href="al-Mu%27taman%20ibn%20Hud">al-Mu'taman ibn Hūd</a>. A Latin translation of the "Kitab al-Manazir" was made probably in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century. This translation was read by and greatly influenced a number of scholars in Christian Europe including: <a href="Roger%20Bacon">Roger Bacon</a>, <a href="Robert%20Grosseteste">Robert Grosseteste</a>, <a href="Witelo">Witelo</a>, <a href="Giambattista%20della%20Porta">Giambattista della Porta</a>, <a href="Leonardo%20Da%20Vinci">Leonardo Da Vinci</a>, <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a>, <a href="Christiaan%20Huygens">Christiaan Huygens</a>, <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a>, and <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Johannes Kepler</a>. His research in <a href="catoptrics">catoptrics</a> (the study of optical systems using mirrors) centred on spherical and <a href="Parabola">parabolic</a> mirrors and <a href="spherical%20aberration">spherical aberration</a>. He made the observation that the ratio between the <a href="angle%20of%20incidence%20%28optics%29">angle of incidence</a> and <a href="refraction">refraction</a> does not remain constant, and investigated the <a href="Magnification">magnifying</a> power of a <a href="Lens%20%28optics%29">lens</a>. His work on catoptrics also contains the problem known as "<a href="Alhazen%27s%20problem">Alhazen's problem</a>". Meanwhile in the Islamic world, Alhazen's work influenced <a href="Averroes">Averroes</a>' writings on optics, and his legacy was further advanced through the 'reforming' of his "Optics" by Persian scientist <a href="Kamal%20al-Din%20al-Farisi">Kamal al-Din al-Farisi</a> (died ca. 1320) in the latter's "Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir" ("The Revision of" [Ibn al-Haytham's] "Optics"). Alhazen wrote as many as 200 books, although only 55 have survived. Some of his treatises on optics survived only through Latin translation. During the Middle Ages his books on <a href="cosmology">cosmology</a> were translated into Latin, <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> and other languages. 

The crater <a href="Alhazen%20%28crater%29">Alhazen</a> on the Moon is named in his honour, as was the <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a> <a href="59239%20Alhazen">59239 Alhazen</a>. In honour of Alhazen, the <a href="Aga%20Khan%20University">Aga Khan University</a> (Pakistan) named its Ophthalmology endowed chair as "The Ibn-e-Haitham Associate Professor and Chief of Ophthalmology". Alhazen, by the name Ibn al-Haytham, is featured on the obverse of the Iraqi 10,000-<a href="dinar">dinar</a> banknote issued in 2003, and on 10-dinar notes from 1982.

The 2015 <a href="International%20Year%20of%20Light">International Year of Light</a> celebrated the 1000th anniversary of the works on optics by Ibn Al-Haytham.

In 2014, the "<a href="Hiding%20in%20the%20Light">Hiding in the Light</a>" episode of "", presented by <a href="Neil%20deGrasse%20Tyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a>, focused on the accomplishments of Ibn al-Haytham. He was voiced by <a href="Alfred%20Molina">Alfred Molina</a> in the episode.

Over forty years previously, <a href="Jacob%20Bronowski">Jacob Bronowski</a> presented Alhazen's work in a similar television documentary (and the corresponding book), "<a href="The%20Ascent%20of%20Man">The Ascent of Man</a>". In episode 5 ("The Music of the Spheres"), Bronowski remarked that in his view, Alhazen was "the one really original scientific mind that Arab culture produced", whose theory of optics was not improved on till the time of Newton and Leibniz.

<a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> declared 2015 the <a href="International%20Year%20of%20Light">International Year of Light</a>. Amongst others, this was to celebrate Ibn Al-Haytham's achievements in optics, mathematics and astronomy. An international campaign, created by the "1001 Inventions" organisation, titled 1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham featuring a series of interactive exhibits, workshops and live shows about his work, partnering with science centers, science festivals, museums, and educational institutions, as well as digital and social media platforms. The campaign also produced and released the short educational film <a href="1001%20Inventions%20and%20the%20World%20of%20Ibn%20Al-Haytham">1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham</a>, In honour of Alhazen, the Aga Khan University (Pakistan) named its Ophthalmology endowed chair as "The Ibn-e-Haitham Associate Professor and Chief of Ophthalmology"

Mark Smith's critical editions of "De Aspectibus" contain a Latin glossary with page numbers of each occurrence of the words, to illustrate Alhazen's experimental viewpoint. Smith shows that Alhacen was received well in the West because he reinforced the importance of the Hellenic tradition to it.

 has noted that Alhazen's treatment of refraction describes an experimental setup without publication of data. Ptolemy published his experimental results for refraction, in contrast. One generation before Alhazen, <a href="Ibn%20Sahl">Ibn Sahl</a> discovered his statement of the lengths of the hypotenuse for each incident and refracted right triangle, respectively. This is equivalent to Descartes' formulation for refraction. Alhazen's convention for describing the incident and refracted angles is still in use.

Ibn al-Haytham is the main character in "The Prisoner of Al-Hakim" by American novelist <a href="Bradley%20Steffens">Bradley Steffens</a>, which recounts the scholar's journey to Egypt, his ten-year imprisonment under <a href="Al-Hakim%20bi-Amr%20Allah">Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah</a>, and his major discoveries in the field of optics.

Alessandro Allori

Alessandro di Cristofano di Lorenzo del Bronzino Allori (Florence, 31 May 153522 September 1607) was an <a href="Italy">Italian</a> portrait <a href="Painting">painter</a> of the late <a href="Mannerism">Mannerist</a> <a href="Florence">Florentine</a> school.

In 1540, after the death of his father, he was brought up and trained in art by a close friend, often referred to as his 'uncle', the mannerist painter <a href="Agnolo%20Bronzino">Agnolo Bronzino</a>, whose name he sometimes assumed in his pictures. In some ways, Allori is the last of the line of prominent Florentine painters, of generally undiluted Tuscan artistic heritage: <a href="Andrea%20del%20Sarto">Andrea del Sarto</a> worked with <a href="Fra%20Bartolomeo">Fra Bartolomeo</a> (as well as <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>), <a href="Pontormo">Pontormo</a> briefly worked under Andrea, and trained <a href="Bronzino">Bronzino</a>, who trained Allori. Subsequent generations in the city would be strongly influenced by the tide of <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> styles pre-eminent in other parts of Italy.

Freedberg derides Allori as derivative, claiming he illustrates "the ideal of Maniera by which art (and style) are generated out of pre-existing art." The polish of figures has an unnatural marble-like form as if he aimed for cold statuary. It can be said of late phase mannerist painting in Florence, that the city that had early breathed life into statuary with the works of masters like <a href="Donatello">Donatello</a> and <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, was still so awed by them that it petrified the poses of figures in painting. While by 1600 the Baroque elsewhere was beginning to give life to painted figures, Florence was painting two-dimensional statues. Furthermore, in general, with the exception of the Counter-"Maniera" (<a href="Counter-Mannerism">Counter-Mannerism</a>) artists, it dared not stray from high themes or stray into high emotion.

Among his collaborators was <a href="Giovanni%20Maria%20Butteri">Giovanni Maria Butteri</a> and his main pupil was <a href="Giovanni%20Bizzelli">Giovanni Bizzelli</a>. Cristoforo del Altissimo, <a href="Cesare%20Dandini">Cesare Dandini</a>, <a href="Aurelio%20Lomi">Aurelio Lomi</a>, John Mosnier, <a href="Alessandro%20Pieroni">Alessandro Pieroni</a>, <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Vanni">Giovanni Battista Vanni</a>, and Monanni also were his pupils. Allori was one of the artists, working under <a href="Vasari">Vasari</a>, included in the decoration of the <a href="Studiolo%20of%20Francesco%20I">Studiola of Francesco I</a>.

He was the father of the painter <a href="Cristofano%20Allori">Cristofano Allori</a> (1577–1621).


In 2006 the BBC foreign correspondent <a href="Charles%20Wheeler%20%28journalist%29">Sir Charles Wheeler</a> returned an original Alessandro Allori painting to the <a href="Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie%2C%20Berlin">Gemäldegalerie, Berlin</a>. He had been given it in Germany in 1952, but only recently realized its origin and that it must have been looted in the wake of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The work is possibly a portrait of Eleonora (Dianora) di Toledo de' Medici, niece of <a href="Eleonora%20di%20Toledo">Eleonora di Toledo</a>, and measures 12 cm x 16 cm.

<doc id="1649" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1649" title="Almoravid dynasty">
Almoravid dynasty

The Almoravid dynasty (; , "Al-Murābiṭūn") was an imperial <a href="Berbers">Berber</a> <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> <a href="dynasty">dynasty</a> centered in <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>. It established an empire in the 11th century that stretched over the western <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a> and <a href="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a>. Founded by <a href="Abdallah%20ibn%20Yasin">Abdallah ibn Yasin</a>, the Almoravid capital was <a href="Marrakesh">Marrakesh</a>, a city the ruling house founded in 1062. The dynasty originated among the <a href="Lamtuna">Lamtuna</a> and the <a href="Godala">Gudala</a>, nomadic Berber tribes of the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a>, traversing the territory between the <a href="Draa%20River">Draa</a>, the <a href="Niger%20River">Niger</a>, and the <a href="Senegal%20river">Senegal</a> rivers.

The Almoravids were crucial in preventing the fall of <a href="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a> to the Iberian Christian kingdoms, when they decisively defeated a coalition of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castilian</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Aragon">Aragonese</a> armies at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sagrajas">Battle of Sagrajas</a> in 1086. This enabled them to control an empire that stretched 3,000 kilometers (1,900 mi) north to south. However, the rule of the dynasty was relatively short-lived. The Almoravids fell—at the height of their power—when they failed to quell the <a href="Masmuda">Masmuda</a>-led rebellion initiated by <a href="Ibn%20Tumart">Ibn Tumart</a>. As a result, their last king <a href="Ishaq%20ibn%20Ali">Ishaq ibn Ali</a> was killed in Marrakesh in April 1147 by the <a href="Almohad%20Caliphate">Almohad Caliphate</a>, who replaced them as a ruling dynasty both in Morocco and <a href="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a>.

The term "Almoravid" comes from the Arabic "al-Murabitun" (), which is the plural form of "al-Murabit"—literally meaning "one who is tying" but figuratively meaning "one who is ready for battle at a fortress". The term is related to the notion of <a href="Ribat">Ribat</a>, a frontier monastery-fortress, through the root r-b-t ( "Rabat": "to tie to unite" or "Raabat": "to encamp").

The name "Almoravid" was tied to a school of Malikite law called "Dar al-Murabitin" founded in <a href="Sus%20al-Aksa">Sus al-Aksa</a>, modern day <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, by a certain scholar named <a href="Waggag%20ibn%20Zallu%20al-Lamti">Waggag Ibn Zallu</a>. Ibn Zallu sent his student <a href="Abdallah%20ibn%20Yasin">Abdallah ibn Yasin</a> to preach Malikite Islam to the Sanhaja Berbers of the Sous and Adrar (present-day <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a>). Hence, the name of the Almoravids comes from the followers of the Dar al-Murabitin, "the house of those who were bound together in the cause of God." 

It is uncertain exactly when or why the Almoravids acquired that appellation. <a href="al-Bakri">al-Bakri</a>, writing in 1068, before their apex, already calls them the "al-Murabitun", but does not clarify the reasons for it. Writing three centuries later, <a href="Ibn%20Abi%20Zar">Ibn Abi Zar</a> suggested it was chosen early on by <a href="Abdallah%20ibn%20Yasin">Abdallah ibn Yasin</a> because, upon finding resistance among the Gudala Berbers of Adrar (Mauritania) to his teaching, he took a handful of followers to erect a makeshift "ribat" (monastery-fortress) on an offshore island (possibly <a href="Tidra">Tidra</a> island, in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Arguin">Bay of Arguin</a>). <a href="Ibn%20Idhari">Ibn Idhari</a> wrote that the name was suggested by Ibn Yasin in the "persevering in the fight" sense, to boost morale after a particularly hard-fought battle in the <a href="Draa">Draa</a> valley c. 1054, in which they had taken many losses. Whichever explanation is true, it seems certain the appellation was chosen by the Almoravids for themselves, partly with the conscious goal of forestalling any tribal or ethnic identifications.

The name might be related to the "ribat" of <a href="Waggag%20ibn%20Zallu%20al-Lamti">Waggag ibn Zallu</a> in the village of Aglu (near present-day <a href="Tiznit">Tiznit</a>), where the future Almoravid spiritual leader Abdallah ibn Yasin got his initial training. The 13th-century Moroccan biographer <a href="Ibn%20al-Zayyat%20al-Tadili">Ibn al-Zayyat al-Tadili</a>, and <a href="Qadi%20Ayyad">Qadi Ayyad</a> before him in the 12th century, note that Waggag's learning center was called "Dar al-Murabitin" (The house of the Almoravids), and that might have inspired Ibn Yasin's choice of name for the movement.

Contemporaries frequently referred to them as the "al-mulathimun" ("the veiled ones", from "litham", <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> for "veil"). The Almoravids veiled themselves below the eyes with a <a href="tagelmust">tagelmust</a>, a custom they adapted from southern <a href="Sanhaja">Sanhaja</a> Berbers. (This can still be seen among the modern <a href="Tuareg%20people">Tuareg people</a>, but it was unusual further north.) Although practical for the desert dust, the Almoravids insisted on wearing the veil everywhere, as a badge of "foreignness" in urban settings, partly as a way of emphasizing their puritan credentials. It served as the uniform of the Almoravids. Under their rule, <a href="sumptuary%20law">sumptuary law</a>s forbade anybody else from wearing the veil, thereby making it the distinctive dress of the ruling class. In turn, the succeeding <a href="Almohads">Almohads</a> made a point of mocking the Almoravid veil as symbolic of <a href="effeminacy">effeminacy</a> and decadence.

The Berbers of the Maghreb in the early Middle Ages could be roughly classified into three major groups: the <a href="Zenata">Zenata</a> across the north, the <a href="Masmuda">Masmuda</a> concentrated in central Morocco, and the Sanhaja, clustered in two areas: the western part of the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a> and the hills of the eastern Maghreb. The eastern Sanhaja included the <a href="Kutama">Kutama</a> Berbers, who had been the base of the <a href="Fatimid">Fatimid</a> rise in the early 10th century, and the <a href="Zirid%20dynasty">Zirid dynasty</a>, who ruled <a href="Ifriqiya">Ifriqiya</a> as vassals of the Fatimids after the latter moved to Egypt in 972. The western <a href="Sanhaja">Sanhaja</a> were divided into several tribes: the Gazzula and the <a href="Lamta">Lamta</a> in the <a href="Draa%20valley">Draa valley</a> and the foothills of the <a href="Anti-Atlas">Anti-Atlas</a> range; further south, encamped in the western <a href="Sahara%20desert">Sahara desert</a>, were the Massufa, the <a href="Lamtuna">Lamtuna</a> and the Banu Warith; and most southerly of all, the Gudala (or Judala), in littoral <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a> down to the borderlands of the <a href="Senegal%20River">Senegal River</a>.

The western Sanhaja had been converted to <a href="Islam">Islam</a> some time in the 9th century. They were subsequently united in the 10th century and, with the zeal of neophyte converts, launched several campaigns against the "<a href="Sudan%20%28region%29">Sudan</a>ese" (pagan peoples of <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>). Under their king Tinbarutan ibn Usfayshar, the Sanhaja Lamtuna erected (or captured) the citadel of <a href="Awdaghust">Awdaghust</a>, a critical stop on the <a href="trans-Saharan%20trade">trans-Saharan trade</a> route. After the collapse of the Sanhaja union, Awdagust passed over to the <a href="Ghana%20empire">Ghana empire</a>; and the trans-Saharan routes were taken over by the Zenata <a href="Maghrawa">Maghrawa</a> of <a href="Sijilmassa">Sijilmassa</a>. The Maghrawa also exploited this disunion to dislodge the Sanhaja Gazzula and Lamta out of their pasturelands in the Sous and Draa valleys. Around 1035, the Lamtuna chieftain Abu Abdallah Muhammad ibn Tifat (alias Tarsina), tried to reunite the Sanhaja desert tribes, but his reign lasted less than three years.

Around 1040, <a href="Yahya%20ibn%20Ibrahim">Yahya ibn Ibrahim</a>, a chieftain of the Gudala (and brother-in-law of the late Tarsina), went on <a href="Hajj">pilgrimage</a> to <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a>. On his return, he stopped by <a href="Kairouan">Kairouan</a> in <a href="Ifriqiya">Ifriqiya</a>, where he met <a href="Abu%20Imran%20al-Fasi">Abu Imran al-Fasi</a>, a native of <a href="Fes">Fes</a> and a jurist and scholar of the <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a> <a href="Maliki">Maliki</a> school. At this time, Ifriqiya was in ferment. The <a href="Zirid%20dynasty">Zirid</a> ruler <a href="al-Muizz%20ibn%20Badis">al-Muizz ibn Badis</a>, was openly contemplating breaking with his <a href="Shi%27ite">Shi'ite</a> <a href="Fatimid">Fatimid</a> overlords in Cairo, and the jurists of Kairouan were agitating for him to do so. Within this heady atmosphere, Yahya and Abu Imran fell into conversation on the state of the faith in their western homelands, and Yahya expressed his disappointment at the lack of religious education and negligence of <a href="Islamic%20law">Islamic law</a> among his southern Sanhaja people. With Abu Imran's recommendation, Yahya ibn Ibrahim made his way to the "ribat" of Waggag ibn Zelu in the <a href="Sous">Sous</a> valley of southern Morocco, to seek out a Maliki teacher for his people. Waggag assigned him one of his residents, <a href="Abdallah%20ibn%20Yasin">Abdallah ibn Yasin</a>.

Abdallah ibn Yasin was a Gazzula Berber, and probably a convert rather than a born Muslim. His name can be read as "son of <a href="Ya%20Sin">Ya Sin</a>" (the title of the 36th <a href="Sura">Sura</a> of the <a href="Qur%27an">Qur'an</a>), suggesting he had obliterated his family past and was "re-born" of the Holy Book. Ibn Yasin certainly had the ardor of a puritan zealot; his creed was mainly characterized by a rigid formalism and a strict adherence to the dictates of the <a href="Qur%27an">Qur'an</a>, and the <a href="Sunnah">Orthodox tradition</a>. (Chroniclers such as al-Bakri allege Ibn Yasin's learning was superficial.) Ibn Yasin's initial meetings with the Gudala people went poorly. As he had more ardor than depth, Ibn Yasin's arguments were disputed by his audience. He responded to questioning with charges of apostasy and handed out harsh punishments for the slightest deviations. The Gudala soon had enough and expelled him almost immediately after the death of his protector, Yahya ibn Ibrahim, sometime in the 1040s.

Ibn Yasin, however, found a more favorable reception among the neighboring Lamtuna people. Probably sensing the useful organizing power of Ibn Yasin's pious fervor, the Lamtuna chieftain <a href="Yahya%20ibn%20Umar%20al-Lamtuni">Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni</a> invited the man to preach to his people. The Lamtuna leaders, however, kept Ibn Yasin on a careful leash, forging a more productive partnership between them. Invoking stories of the early life of Muhammad, Ibn Yasin preached that conquest was a necessary addendum to Islamicization, that it was not enough to merely adhere to God's law, but necessary to also destroy opposition to it. In Ibn Yasin's ideology, anything and everything outside of Islamic law could be characterized as "opposition". He identified tribalism, in particular, as an obstacle. He believed it was not enough to urge his audiences to put aside their blood loyalties and ethnic differences, and embrace the equality of all Muslims under the Sacred Law, it was necessary to make them do so. For the Lamtuna leadership, this new ideology dovetailed with their long desire to refound the Sanhaja union and recover their lost dominions. In the early 1050s, the Lamtuna, under the joint leadership of Yahya ibn Umar and Abdallah ibn Yasin—soon calling themselves the "al-Murabitin" (Almoravids)—set out on a campaign to bring their neighbors over to their cause.

From the year 1053, the Almoravids began to spread their religious way to the Berber areas of the Sahara, and to the regions south of the desert. After winning over the <a href="Sanhaja">Sanhaja</a> Berber tribe, they quickly took control of the entire desert trade route, seizing <a href="Sijilmasa">Sijilmasa</a> at the northern end in 1054, and <a href="Aoudaghost">Aoudaghost</a> at the southern end in 1055. Yahya ibn Umar was killed in a battle in 1057, but Abdullah ibn Yasin, whose influence as a religious teacher was paramount, named his brother <a href="Abu%20Bakr%20ibn%20Umar">Abu Bakr ibn Umar</a> as chief. Under him, the Almoravids soon began to spread their power beyond the desert, and conquered the tribes of the <a href="Atlas%20Mountains">Atlas Mountains</a>. They then came in contact with the <a href="Berghouata">Berghouata</a>, a Berber tribal confederation, who followed an Islamic "heresy" preached by <a href="Salih%20ibn%20Tarif">Salih ibn Tarif</a> three centuries earlier. The Berghouata resisted. Abdullah ibn Yasin was killed in battle with them in 1059, in Krifla, a village near <a href="Rommani">Rommani</a>, <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>. They were, however, completely conquered by <a href="Abu%20Bakr%20ibn%20Umar">Abu Bakr ibn Umar</a>, and were forced to convert to orthodox Islam. Abu Bakr married a noble and wealthy Berber woman, <a href="Zaynab%20an-Nafzawiyyat">Zaynab an-Nafzawiyyat</a>, who would become very influential in the development of the dynasty. Zaynab was the daughter of a wealthy merchant from Houara, who was said to be from <a href="Kairouan">Kairouan</a>.

In 1061, Abu Bakr ibn Umar made a division of the power he had established, handing over the more-settled parts to his cousin <a href="Yusuf%20ibn%20Tashfin">Yusuf ibn Tashfin</a> as <a href="viceroy">viceroy</a>, and also assigning to him his favourite wife Zaynab. Ibn Umar kept the task of suppressing the revolts that had broken out in the desert. When he returned to resume control, he found his cousin too powerful to be superseded. In November 1087, Abu Bakr was killed in battle - according to oral tradition by an arrow, while fighting in the historic region of the <a href="Sudan%20%28region%29">Sudan</a>.

Yusuf ibn Tashfin had in the meantime brought the large area of what is now known as <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, <a href="Western%20Sahara">Western Sahara</a>, and <a href="Mauritania">Mauritania</a> into complete subjection. In 1062 he founded the city of <a href="Marrakech">Marrakech</a>. In 1080, he conquered the kingdom of <a href="Tlemcen">Tlemcen</a> (in modern-day <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>) and founded the present city of that name, his rule extending as far east as <a href="Oran">Oran</a>.

According to Arab tradition, the Almoravids conquered the <a href="Ghana%20Empire">Ghana Empire</a> sometime around 1076 CE. An example of this tradition is the record of historian <a href="Ibn%20Khaldun">Ibn Khaldun</a>, who cited Shaykh Uthman, the <a href="Faq%C4%ABh">faqih</a> of Ghana, writing in 1394. According to this source, the Almoravids weakened Ghana and collected tribute from the Sudan, to the extent that the authority of the rulers of Ghana dwindled away, and they were subjugated and absorbed by the <a href="Sosso%20Empire">Susu</a>, a neighboring people of the Sudan. Traditions in Mali related that the Soso attacked and took over Mali as well, and the ruler of the Soso, Sumaouro Kanté took over the land.

However criticism from Conrad and Fisher (1982) argued that the notion of any Almoravid military conquest at its core is merely perpetuated folklore, derived from a misinterpretation or naive reliance on Arabic sources. According to Professor Timothy Insoll, the archaeology of ancient Ghana simply does not show the signs of rapid change and destruction that would be associated with any Almoravid-era military conquests.

Dierke Lange agreed with the original military incursion theory but argues that this doesn't preclude Almoravid political agitation, claiming that the main factor of the demise of Ghana empire owed much to the latter. According to Lange, the Almoravid religious influence was gradual and not heavily involved in military strife; there the Almoravids increased in power by marrying among the nation's nobility. Lange attributes the decline of ancient Ghana to numerous unrelated factors, only one of which can be likely attributable to internal dynastic struggles that were instigated by Almoravid influence and Islamic pressures, but devoid of military conversion and conquest.

This interpretation of events has been disputed by later scholars like Sheryl L. Burkhalter (1992), who argued that, whatever the nature of the "conquest" in the south of the Sahara, the influence and success of the Almoravid movement in securing west African gold and circulating it widely necessitated a high degree of political control.

The traditional position says that the ensuing war with the Almoravids pushed Ghana over the edge, ending the kingdom's position as a commercial and military power by 1100. It collapsed into tribal groups and chieftaincies, some of which later assimilated into the Almoravids while others founded the <a href="Mali%20Empire">Mali Empire</a>.

The Arab geographer <a href="Al-Zuhri">Al-Zuhri</a> wrote that the Almoravids ended <a href="Ibadi">Ibadi</a>sm in Tadmekka in 1084 and that Abu Bakr "arrived at the mountain of gold" in the deep south.
After the death of Abu Bakr (1087), the confederation of Berber tribes in the Sahara was divided between the descendants of Abu Bakr and his brother Yahya, and would have lost control of Ghana. Sheryl Burkhalter suggests that Abu Bakr’s son Yahya was the leader of the Almoravid expedition that conquered Ghana in 1076, and that the Almoravids would have survived the loss of Ghana and the defeat in the Maghreb by the Almohads, and would have ruled the Sahara until the end of the 12th century.

In 1086 <a href="Yusuf%20ibn%20Tashfin">Yusuf ibn Tashfin</a> was invited by the Muslim "<a href="taifa">taifa</a>" princes of <a href="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a> in the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a> to defend their territories from the encroachment of <a href="Alfonso%20VI%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Alfonso VI</a>, King of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">León</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castile</a>. In that year, <a href="Yusuf%20ibn%20Tashfin">Yusuf ibn Tashfin</a> crossed the <a href="Strait%20of%20Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a> to <a href="Algeciras">Algeciras</a>, and defeated Castile at the <a href="Battle%20of%20az-Zallaqah">Battle of az-Zallaqah</a> (Battle of Sagrajas). He was prevented from following up his victory by trouble in <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, which he chose to settle in person.

He returned to Iberia in 1090, avowedly for the purpose of annexing the "taifa" principalities of Iberia. He was supported by most of the Iberian people, who were discontented with the heavy taxation imposed upon them by their spendthrift rulers. Their religious teachers, as well as others in the east, (most notably, <a href="al-Ghazali">al-Ghazali</a> in <a href="Iran">Persia</a> and <a href="al-Tartushi">al-Tartushi</a> in Egypt, who was himself an Iberian by birth from <a href="Tortosa">Tortosa</a>), detested the "taifa" rulers for their religious indifference. The clerics issued a "<a href="fatwa">fatwa</a>" (a non-binding legal opinion) that Yusuf was of sound morals and had the religious right to dethrone the rulers, whom he saw as heterodox in their faith. By 1094, Yusuf had annexed most of the major "taifas", with the exception of the one at <a href="Saragossa">Saragossa</a>. The Almoravids were victorious at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Consuegra">Battle of Consuegra</a>, during which the son of El Cid, Diego Rodríguez, perished. Alfonso, with some Leónese, retreated into the castle of Consuegra, which was besieged for eight days until the Almoravids withdrew to the south.

After friendly correspondence with the caliph at <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, whom he acknowledged as "Amir al-Mu'minin" ("Commander of the Faithful"), Yusuf ibn Tashfin in 1097 assumed the title of "Amir al Muslimin" ("Commander of the Muslims"). He died in 1106, when he was reputed to have reached the age of 100. The Almoravid power was at its height at Yusuf's death: the Moorish empire then included all of Northwest Africa as far eastward as <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a>, and all of Iberia south of the <a href="Tagus">Tagus</a> and as far eastward as the mouth of the <a href="Ebro">Ebro</a>, and including the <a href="Balearic%20Islands">Balearic Islands</a>.

In 1108 Tamim Al Yusuf defeated the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Kingdom of Castile</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ucl%C3%A9s%20%281108%29">Battle of Uclés</a>. Yusuf did not reconquer much territory from the Christian kingdoms, except that of <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a>; but he did hinder the progress of the Christian <a href="Reconquista">Reconquista</a> by uniting <a href="al-Andalus">al-Andalus</a>. In 1134 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fraga">Battle of Fraga</a> the Almoravids dynasty was victorious and even succeeded in slaying <a href="Alfonso%20I%20of%20Aragon">Alfonso I of Aragon</a> in the battle.

Three years afterwards, under Yusuf's son and successor, <a href="Ali%20ibn%20Yusuf">Ali ibn Yusuf</a>, <a href="Sintra">Sintra</a> and <a href="Santar%C3%A9m%2C%20Portugal">Santarém</a> were added, and he invaded Iberia again in 1119 and 1121, but the tide had turned, as the French had assisted the Aragonese to recover <a href="Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a>. In 1138, Ali ibn Yusuf was defeated by <a href="Alfonso%20VII%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Alfonso VII of León</a>, and in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ourique">Battle of Ourique</a> (1139), by <a href="Afonso%20I%20of%20Portugal">Afonso I of Portugal</a>, who thereby won his crown. <a href="Siege%20of%20Lisbon">Lisbon was conquered</a> by the Portuguese in 1147.

According to some scholars, Ali ibn Yusuf was a new generation of leadership that had forgotten the desert life for the comforts of the city. He was defeated by the combined action of his Christian foes in Iberia and the agitation of <a href="Almohads">Almohads</a> (the Muwahhids) in Morocco. After Ali ibn Yusuf's death in 1143, his son Tashfin ibn Ali lost ground rapidly before the Almohads. In 1146 he was killed in a fall from a precipice while attempting to escape after a defeat near <a href="Oran">Oran</a>.

His two successors were <a href="Ibrahim%20ibn%20Tashfin">Ibrahim ibn Tashfin</a> and <a href="Ishaq%20ibn%20Ali">Ishaq ibn Ali</a>, but their reigns were short. The conquest of the city of <a href="Marrakech">Marrakech</a> by the Almohads in 1147 marked the fall of the dynasty, though fragments of the Almoravids (the <a href="Banu%20Ghaniya">Banu Ghaniya</a>), continued to struggle in the Balearic Islands, and finally in <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>.

<a href="Abdallah%20ibn%20Yassin">Abdallah ibn Yassin</a> imposed very strict discipline measures on his forces for every breach of his laws. The Almoravids' first military leader, Yahya ibn Umar al-Lamtuni, gave them a good military organization. Their main force was infantry, armed with javelins in the front ranks and pikes behind, which formed into a phalanx; and was supported by camelmen and horsemen on the flanks. They also had a flag carrier at the front who guided the forces behind him; when the flag was upright, the combatants behind would stand and when it was turned down, they would sit.

<a href="Al-Bakri">Al-Bakri</a> reports that, while in combat, the Almoravids did not pursue those who fled in front of them. Their fighting was intense and they did not retreat when disadvantaged by an advancing opposing force; they preferred death over defeat. These characteristics were possibly unusual at the time.

After the death of <a href="El%20Cid">El Cid</a>, Christian chronicles reported a legend of a Turkish woman leading a band of 300 black African female archers. This legend was possibly inspired by the ominous veils on the faces of the warriors and the dark skin colored blue by the indigo of their robes.

Aloe

Aloe ( or ), also written "Aloë", is a <a href="genus">genus</a> containing over 500 <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering</a> <a href="succulent%20plant">succulent</a> <a href="plant">plant</a>s. The most widely known species is "<a href="Aloe%20vera">Aloe vera</a>", or "true aloe", so called because it is cultivated as the standard source of so-called "aloe vera" for assorted pharmaceutical purposes. Other species, such as "<a href="Aloe%20ferox">Aloe ferox</a>", also are cultivated or harvested from the wild for similar applications.

The <a href="APG%20IV%20system">APG IV system</a> (2016) places the genus in the family <a href="Asphodelaceae">Asphodelaceae</a>, subfamily <a href="Asphodeloideae">Asphodeloideae</a>. In the past, it has been assigned to the family <a href="Aloaceae">Aloaceae</a> (now included in the Asphodelaceae) or to a broadly <a href="Circumscription%20%28taxonomy%29">circumscribed</a> family <a href="Liliaceae">Liliaceae</a> (the lily family). The plant "<a href="Agave%20americana">Agave americana</a>", which is sometimes called "American aloe", belongs to the <a href="Asparagaceae">Asparagaceae</a>, a different family.

The genus is native to tropical and southern <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>, the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>, and various islands in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> (<a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a>, <a href="Comoros">Comoros</a>, etc.). A few species have also become naturalized in other regions (<a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>, <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="North%20America">North</a> and <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, etc.).

Most "Aloe" species have a <a href="rosette%20%28botany%29">rosette</a> of large, thick, fleshy <a href="Leaf">leaves</a>. "Aloe" <a href="flower">flower</a>s are tubular, frequently yellow, orange, pink, or red, and are borne, densely clustered and pendant, at the apex of simple or branched, leafless stems. Many species of "Aloe" appear to be stemless, with the rosette growing directly at ground level; other varieties may have a branched or unbranched <a href="plant%20stem">stem</a> from which the fleshy leaves spring. They vary in color from grey to bright-green and are sometimes striped or <a href="mottle">mottle</a>d. Some aloes native to South Africa are tree-like (arborescent).

The <a href="APG%20IV%20system">APG IV system</a> (2016) places the genus in the family <a href="Asphodelaceae">Asphodelaceae</a>, subfamily <a href="Asphodeloideae">Asphodeloideae</a>. In the past it has also been assigned to the families <a href="Liliaceae">Liliaceae</a> and Aloeaceae, as well as the family Asphodelaceae <a href="sensu%20stricto">sensu stricto</a>, before this was merged into the Asphodelaceae <a href="sensu%20lato">sensu lato</a>.

The <a href="circumscription%20%28taxonomy%29">circumscription</a> of the genus has varied widely. Many genera, such as "Lomatophyllum", have been brought into <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonymy</a>. Species at one time placed in "Aloe", such as "<a href="Agave%20americana">Agave americana</a>", have been moved to other genera.

Over 500 species are accepted in the genus "Aloe", plus even more synonyms and unresolved species, subspecies, varieties, and hybrids. Some of the accepted species are:

In addition to the species and hybrids between species within the genus, several hybrids with other genera have been created in cultivation, such as between "Aloe" and "<a href="Gasteria">Gasteria</a>" ("<a href="%C3%97Gasteraloe">×Gasteraloe</a>"), and between "Aloe" and "<a href="Astroloba">Astroloba</a>" ("<a href="%C3%97Aloloba">×Aloloba</a>").

Aloe species are frequently cultivated as ornamental plants both in gardens and in pots. Many aloe species are highly decorative and are valued by collectors of succulents. "Aloe vera" is used both internally and externally on humans as <a href="folk%20medicine">folk</a> or <a href="alternative%20medicine">alternative</a> medicine. The plants can also be made into types of special soaps.

Historical use of various aloe species is well documented. Documentation of the clinical effectiveness is available, although relatively limited.

Of the 500+ species, only a few were used traditionally as <a href="herbal%20medicine">herbal medicine</a>s, "Aloe vera" again being the most commonly used species. Also included are "A. perryi" and "A. ferox". The Ancient Greeks and Romans used "Aloe vera" to treat wounds. In the Middle Ages, the yellowish liquid found inside the leaves was favored as a <a href="purgative">purgative</a>. Unprocessed aloe that contains <a href="aloin">aloin</a> is generally used as a laxative, whereas processed juice does not usually contain significant aloin.

Some species, particularly "Aloe vera", are used in alternative medicine and first aid. Both the translucent inner pulp and the resinous yellow aloin from wounding the aloe plant are used externally for skin discomforts. As an herbal medicine, "Aloe vera" juice is commonly used internally for digestive discomfort.

Relatively few studies about possible benefits of aloe gel taken internally have been conducted. Components of "Aloe" have shown the possibility of inhibiting tumor growth in animal studies, but these effects have not been demonstrated clinically in humans. Some studies in animal models indicate that extracts of "Aloe" have a significant antihyperglycemic effect, and may be useful in treating Type II diabetes, but these studies have not been confirmed in humans.

According to <a href="Cancer%20Research%20UK">Cancer Research UK</a>, a potentially deadly product called T-UP is made of concentrated aloe, and promoted as a cancer cure. They say "there is currently no evidence that aloe products can help to prevent or treat cancer in humans".

On May 9, 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a final rule banning the use of aloin, the yellow sap of the aloe plant, for use as a laxative ingredient in <a href="over-the-counter%20drug">over-the-counter drug</a> products. Most aloe juices today do not contain significant aloin.

According to W. A. Shenstone, two classes of aloins are recognized: (1) nataloins, which yield <a href="picric%20acid">picric</a> and <a href="oxalic%20acid">oxalic acid</a>s with <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a>, and do not give a red coloration with nitric acid; and (2) <a href="barbaloin">barbaloin</a>s, which yield aloetic acid (CHNO), chrysammic acid (CHNO), picric and oxalic acids with nitric acid, being reddened by the acid. This second group may be divided into a-barbaloins, obtained from Barbados "Aloe", and reddened in the cold, and b-barbaloins, obtained from "Aloe Socotrina" and Zanzibar "Aloe", reddened by ordinary nitric acid only when warmed or by fuming acid in the cold. Nataloin (2CHO·HO) forms bright-yellow scales, barbaloin (CHO) <a href="Prism%20%28geometry%29">prism</a>atic crystals. "Aloe" species also contain a trace of volatile oil, to which their odour is due.

"Aloe perryi", "A. barbadensis", "A. ferox", and hybrids of this species with "A. africana" and "A. spicata" are listed as natural flavoring substances in the US government "Electronic Code of Federal Regulations". "Aloe Socotrina" is said to be used in yellow <a href="Chartreuse%20%28liqueur%29">Chartreuse</a>.

"Aloe rubrolutea" occurs as a charge in <a href="heraldry">heraldry</a>, for example in the Civic Heraldry of Namibia.

Alyattes of Lydia

Alyattes, king of <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a> (619–560 BC), considered to be the founder of the <a href="Lydian%20empire">Lydian empire</a>, was the son of <a href="Sadyattes">Sadyattes</a>, of the house of the <a href="Mermnadae">Mermnadae</a>.

For several years he continued the war against the Greek colony of <a href="Miletus">Miletus</a> begun by his father, but was obliged to turn his attention towards the <a href="Medes">Medes</a> and <a href="Babylonians">Babylonians</a>. On May 28, 585 BC, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Halys%20%28585%20BC%29">Battle of Halys</a> fought against <a href="Cyaxares">Cyaxares</a>, king of Media, <a href="Eclipse%20of%20Thales">a solar eclipse</a> took place; hostilities were suspended, peace concluded, and the <a href="Halys%20River">Halys River</a> was fixed as the boundary between the two kingdoms.

Alyattes drove the <a href="Cimmerians">Cimmerians</a> from <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, with the help of <a href="war%20dogs">war dogs</a>. He further subdued the <a href="Carians">Carians</a>, and took several <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a>n cities, including <a href="Smyrna">Smyrna</a> and <a href="Colophon%20%28city%29">Colophon</a>. Smyrna was sacked and destroyed with its inhabitants forced to move into the countryside.

He standardised the weight of coins (1 <a href="stater">stater</a> = 168 grains of wheat). The coins were produced using an <a href="hammered%20coinage">anvil die</a> technique and stamped with a lion's head, the symbol of the Mermnadae.

He was succeeded by his son <a href="Croesus">Croesus</a>. His daughter <a href="Aryenis%20of%20Lydia">Aryenis of Lydia</a> was <a href="queen%20consort">queen consort</a> of <a href="Astyages">Astyages</a>, King of Media.

His <a href="tomb">tomb</a> still exists on the plateau between Lake Gygaea and the <a href="Gediz%20River">river Hermus</a> to the north of <a href="Sardis">Sardis</a>—a large mound of earth with a substructure of huge stones. It was excavated by <a href="Spiegelthal">Spiegelthal</a> in 1854, who found that it covered a large vault of finely cut marble blocks approached by a flat-roofed passage of the same stone from the south. The <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> and its contents had been removed by early plunderers of the tomb. All that was left were some broken alabaster vases, pottery and charcoal. On the summit of the mound were large <a href="phallus">phalli</a> of stone.

In "<a href="Histories%20%28Herodotus%29">The Histories</a>", <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> recounts how Alyattes continued his father's war against Miletus. According to Herodotus, Alyattes invaded Miletus annually to burn their crops over the course of several years. The troops left the horses and houses untouched so that the Milesians could plant a new crop, which the Lydians would then burn the following year. This continued until the end of the war eleven years later.

Age of consent

The age of consent is the age at which a person is considered to be <a href="legally%20competent">legally competent</a> to consent to <a href="Human%20sexual%20activity">sexual acts</a>, and is thus the minimum age of a person with whom another person is legally permitted to engage in sexual activity. The distinguishing aspect of the age of consent laws is that the person below the minimum age is regarded as the victim, and their sex partner as the offender.

The term "age of consent" rarely appears in legal <a href="statute">statute</a>s. Generally, a law will instead establish the age below which it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with that person. It has sometimes been used with other meanings, such as the age at which a person becomes competent to consent to <a href="marriageable%20age">marriage</a>, but the meaning given above is the one now generally understood. It should not be confused with the <a href="age%20of%20majority">age of majority</a>, <a href="defense%20of%20infancy">age of criminal responsibility</a>, the <a href="voting%20age">voting age</a>, the <a href="Legal%20drinking%20age">drinking age</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20minimum%20driving%20age">driving age</a>, etc.

Age of consent laws vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, though most jurisdictions set the age of consent in the range 14 to 18. The laws may also vary by the type of sexual act, the gender of the participants, or other restrictions such as being in a <a href="position%20of%20trust">position of trust</a>; some jurisdictions may also make allowances for minors engaged in sexual acts with each other, rather than a single age. Charges resulting from a breach of these laws may range from a <a href="misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a> such as "corruption of a minor", to what is popularly called "<a href="statutory%20rape">statutory rape</a>" (which is considered equivalent to rape, both in severity and sentencing).

There are many "grey areas" in this area of law, some regarding unspecific and untried legislation, others brought about by debates regarding changing societal attitudes, and others due to conflicts between <a href="federal%20law">federal</a> and <a href="state%20law">state</a> laws. These factors all make age of consent an often confusing subject, and a topic of highly charged debates.

In traditional societies, the age of consent for a sexual union was a matter for the family to decide, or a tribal custom. In most cases, this coincided with signs of <a href="puberty">puberty</a>, <a href="menstruation">menstruation</a> for a woman, and pubic hair for a man. The ancient Greek poet <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a> in "<a href="Works%20and%20Days">Works and Days</a>" (c. 700 BC) suggests that a man should marry around the age of thirty, and that he should take a wife who is five years past puberty.

Reliable data for ages at marriage is scarce. In England, for example, the only reliable data in the early modern period comes from property records made after death. Not only were the records relatively rare, but not all bothered to record the participants' ages, and it seems that the more complete the records are, the more likely they are to reveal young marriages. Modern historians have sometimes shown reluctance to accept evidence of young ages of marriage, dismissing it as a 'misreading' by a later copier of the records.

In the 12th century, <a href="Gratian%20%28jurist%29">Gratian</a>, the influential founder of <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a> in <a href="medieval">medieval</a> Europe, accepted age of puberty for marriage to be around 12 (girls) and around 14 (boys) but acknowledged consent to be meaningful if the children were older than 7. There were authorities that said that consent could take place earlier. Marriage would then be valid as long as neither of the two parties annulled the marital agreement before reaching puberty, or if they had already consummated the marriage. Judges sometimes honored marriages based on mutual consent at ages younger than 7: in contrast to established canon, there are recorded marriages of 2 and 3 year olds.

The first "recorded" age-of-consent law dates from 1275 in England; as part of its provisions on rape, the <a href="Statute%20of%20Westminster%201275">Statute of Westminster 1275</a> made it a misdemeanor to "ravish" a "maiden within age," whether with or without her consent. The phrase "within age" was later interpreted by jurist Sir Edward Coke as meaning the age of marriage, which at the time was 12 years of age.

The American colonies followed the English tradition, and the law was more of a guide. For example, Mary Hathaway (Virginia, 1689) was only 9 when she was married to William Williams. Sir Edward Coke (England, 17th century) "made it clear that the marriage of girls under 12 was normal, and the age at which a girl who was a wife was eligible for a <a href="dower">dower</a> from her husband's estate was 9 even though her husband be only four years old."

In the 16th century, a small number of Italian and German states set the minimum age for sexual intercourse for girls, setting it at 12 years. Towards the end of the 18th century, other European countries also began to enact similar laws. The first French Constitution of 1791 established the minimum age at 11 years. Portugal, Spain, Denmark and the Swiss cantons initially set the minimum age at 10–12 years.

Age of consent laws were, historically, difficult to follow and enforce: legal norms based on "age" were not, in general, common until the 19th century, because clear proof of exact age and precise date of birth were often unavailable.

In <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> societies, <a href="fornication">sex outside marriage</a> was forbidden. Older children were often punished themselves for being complicit in sexual interaction with an adult. Until the late 18th century, there was little understanding of <a href="childhood">childhood</a> as a concept, and children were seen as "little adults". Indeed, prior to the 12th century, there was virtually no notion of childhood at all. Western Christianity also deemed that children were born into the <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a>, and, as such, were perceived as inherently immoral. Children had very few rights and were considered the <a href="wikt%3Achattel">chattel</a> of the father. From the late 18th century, and especially in the 19th century, attitudes started to change. By the mid-19th century there was increased concern over child sexual abuse.

A general shift in social and legal attitudes toward issues of sex occurred during the modern era. Attitudes on the appropriate age of permission for females to engage in sexual activity drifted toward adulthood. While ages from 10 to 13 were typically regarded as acceptable ages for sexual consent in <a href="western%20world">Western countries</a> during the mid-19th century, by the end of the 19th century changing attitudes towards sexuality and childhood resulted in the raising of the age of consent.

The English <a href="common%20law">common law</a> had traditionally set the age of consent within the range of 10 to 12, but in 1875 the age was raised to 13. Early feminists of the <a href="Social%20Purity%20movement">Social Purity movement</a>, such as <a href="Josephine%20Butler">Josephine Butler</a> and others, instrumental in securing the repeal of the <a href="Contagious%20Diseases%20Acts">Contagious Diseases Acts</a>, began to turn towards the problem of <a href="child%20prostitution">child prostitution</a> by the end of the 1870s. Sensational media revelations about the scourge of child prostitution in London in the 1880s then caused outrage among the respectable middle-classes, leading to pressure for the age of consent to be raised again.

The investigative journalist <a href="William%20Thomas%20Stead">William Thomas Stead</a> of the "<a href="Pall%20Mall%20Gazette">Pall Mall Gazette</a>" was pivotal in exposing the problem of child prostitution in the London underworld through a publicity stunt. In 1885 he "purchased" one victim, <a href="The%20Eliza%20Armstrong%20Case">Eliza Armstrong</a>, the 13-year-old daughter of a <a href="chimney%20sweep">chimney sweep</a>, for five pounds and took her to a brothel where she was drugged. He then published a series of four exposés entitled "<a href="The%20Maiden%20Tribute%20of%20Modern%20Babylon">The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon</a>", which shocked its readers with tales of child prostitution and the abduction, procurement, and sale of young English virgins to Continental "pleasure palaces". The "Maiden Tribute" was an instant sensation with the reading public, and Victorian society was thrown into an uproar about prostitution. Fearing riots on a national scale, the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, <a href="William%20Vernon%20Harcourt%20%28politician%29">Sir William Harcourt</a>, pleaded in vain with Stead to cease publication of the articles. A wide variety of reform groups held protest meetings and marched together to <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a> demanding that the age of consent be raised. The government was forced to propose the <a href="Criminal%20Law%20Amendment%20Act%201885">Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885</a>, which raised the age of consent to 16 and clamped down on prostitution.

In the United States, as late as the 1880s most States set the minimum age at 10–12, (in Delaware it was 7 in 1895). Inspired by the "Maiden Tribute" articles, female reformers in the US initiated their own campaign which petitioned legislators to raise the legal minimum age to at least 16, with the ultimate goal to raise the age to 18. The campaign was successful, with almost all states raising the minimum age to 16–18 years by 1920.

In <a href="France">France</a>, Portugal, Denmark and the <a href="Swiss%20canton">Swiss canton</a>s and other countries, the minimum age was raised to between 13 and 16 years in the following decades. Though the original arguments for raising the age of consent were based on morality, since then the "raison d'être" of the laws has changed to <a href="child%20welfare">child welfare</a> and a so-called right to childhood or innocence.

In France, under the <a href="Napoleonic%20Code">Napoleonic Code</a> the age of consent was set in 1832 at 11, and was raised to 13 in 1863. It was increased to 15 in 1945.

In <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, it was set in 1822 at "puberty age", and changed to 12 in 1870, which was kept until 1999, when it became 13; and in 2015 it was raised to 16.

In the 21st century, concerns about <a href="child%20sex%20tourism">child sex tourism</a> and <a href="commercial%20sexual%20exploitation">commercial sexual exploitation</a> of children gained international prominence, and have resulted in legislative changes in several jurisdictions, as well as in the adoption of several international instruments.

The <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a> <a href="Convention%20on%20the%20Protection%20of%20Children%20against%20Sexual%20Exploitation%20and%20Sexual%20Abuse">Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse</a> (<a href="Lanzarote">Lanzarote</a>, 25 October 2007), and the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>'s "Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council" of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography were adopted.

The <a href="Optional%20Protocol%20on%20the%20Sale%20of%20Children%2C%20Child%20Prostitution%20and%20Child%20Pornography">Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography</a> came into force in 2002.

The <a href="Protocol%20to%20Prevent%2C%20Suppress%20and%20Punish%20Trafficking%20in%20Persons%2C%20especially%20Women%20and%20Children">Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children</a>, which came into force in 2003, prohibits commercial sexual exploitation of children.

The <a href="Council%20of%20Europe%20Convention%20on%20Action%20against%20Trafficking%20in%20Human%20Beings">Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings</a> (which came into force in 2008) also deals with commercial sexual exploitation of children.

Several Western countries have raised their ages of consent recently. These include <a href="Ages%20of%20consent%20in%20Canada">Canada</a> (in 2008 - from 14 to 16); and in Europe, <a href="Ages%20of%20consent%20in%20Europe%23Iceland">Iceland</a> (in 2007 - from 14 to 15), <a href="Ages%20of%20consent%20in%20Europe%23Lithuania">Lithuania</a> (in 2010 - from 14 to 16), <a href="Ages%20of%20consent%20in%20Europe%23Croatia">Croatia</a> (in 2013 - from 14 to 15), and <a href="Ages%20of%20consent%20in%20Europe%23Spain">Spain</a> (in 2015 - from 13 to 16).

The International Criminal Court Statute does not provide a specific age of consent in its rape/sexual violence statute, but makes reference to sexual acts committed against persons ""incapable of giving genuine consent""; and the explicative footnote states, "It is understood that a person may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural, induced or "age-related incapacity"." (see note 51)

Sexual relations with a person under the age of consent is a crime in most countries. Jurisdictions use a variety of terms for the offense, including "<a href="child%20sexual%20abuse">child sexual abuse</a>", "<a href="statutory%20rape">statutory rape</a>", "illegal <a href="carnal%20knowledge">carnal knowledge</a>", "corruption of a minor", besides others.

The enforcement practices of age-of-consent laws vary depending on the social sensibilities of the particular culture (see above). Often, enforcement is not exercised to the letter of the law, with legal action being taken only when a sufficiently socially-unacceptable age gap exists between the two individuals, or if the perpetrator is in a position of power over the minor (e.g., a teacher, minister, or doctor). The <a href="sex">sex</a> of each participant can also influence perceptions of an individual's guilt and therefore enforcement.

The threshold age for engaging in sexual activity varies between jurisdictions (<a href="%23By%20country%20or%20region">see below</a>). Most jurisdictions have set a fixed age of consent. However, some jurisdictions permit sex with a person after their <a href="puberty">puberty</a>, such as <a href="Ages%20of%20consent%20in%20Asia%23Yemen">Yemen</a>, but only in marriage. Ages can also vary based on the type of calendar used, such as the <a href="Lunar%20calendar">Lunar calendar</a>, how <a href="February%2029%23Births">birth dates</a> in <a href="leap%20years">leap years</a> are handled, or even the method by which birth date is calculated.

The age of consent is a legal barrier to the minor's ability to consent and therefore obtaining consent is not in general a defense to having sexual relations with a person under the prescribed age, for example:


Some countries have age of consent laws which apply not only to acts committed within the country, but also to those committed by its citizens or inhabitants while they are on foreign soil. For example, a federal United States law bans sexual activity by its citizens with foreigners or with U.S. citizens from another state, if the partner is under 18 and the activity is illegal under the federal, state, or local law. This applies in cases where any of the partners travels into or out of the United States, or from one state into another, for the purpose of an illegal sexual encounter.

There is debate as to whether the gender of those involved should lead to different treatment of the sexual encounter, in law or in practice. Traditionally, age of consent laws regarding vaginal intercourse were often meant to protect the chastity of unmarried girls. Many feminists and social campaigners in the 1970s have objected to the social importance of virginity, and have also attempted to change the stereotypes of female passivity and male aggression; demanding that the law protect children from exploitation regardless of their gender, rather than dealing with concerns of chastity. This has led to gender-neutral laws in many jurisdictions. On the other hand, there is an opposing view which argues that the act of vaginal intercourse is an "unequal act" for males and females, due to issues such as pregnancy, increased risk of STDs, and risk of physical injury if the girl is too young and not physically ready. In the US, in "<a href="Michael%20M.%20v.%20Superior%20Court%20of%20Sonoma%20County">Michael M. v. Superior Ct.450 U.S. 464 (1981)</a>" it was ruled that the double standard of offering more legal protection to girls is valid because "the Equal Protection Clause does not mean that the physiological differences between men and women must be disregarded".

Traditionally, many age of consent laws dealt primarily with men engaging in sexual acts with underage girls and boys (the latter acts often falling under <a href="sodomy">sodomy</a> and <a href="buggery">buggery</a> laws). This means that in some legal systems, women having sexual contact with underage youth were rarely acknowledged. For example, until 2000, in the UK, before the <a href="Sexual%20Offences%20%28Amendment%29%20Act%202000">Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000</a>, there was no statutory age of consent for <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a> sex. In <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, before 2005, there were no age of consent laws dealing with women having sex with underage boys. Previously, in Fiji, male offenders of child sexual abuse could receive up to life imprisonment, whilst female offenders would receive up to seven years. Situations like these have been attributed to societal views on traditional <a href="gender%20roles">gender roles</a>, and to constructs of <a href="male%20sexuality">male sexuality</a> and <a href="female%20sexuality">female sexuality</a>; according to E Martellozzo, "[V]iewing females as perpetrators of sexual abuse goes against every stereotype that society has of women: women as mothers and caregivers and not as people who abuse and harm". <a href="Alissa%20Nutting">Alissa Nutting</a> argues that women are not acknowledged as perpetrators of sex crimes because society does not accept that women have an autonomous sexuality of their own.

The age at which a person can be legally married can differ from the age of consent. In jurisdictions where the marriageable age is lower than the age of consent, those laws usually override the age of consent laws in the case of a married couple where one or both partners are below the age of consent. Some jurisdictions prohibit all sex outside of marriage irrespective of age, as in the case of <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a>.

In many countries, there are specific laws dealing with child prostitution.

In some countries, states, or other jurisdictions, the age of consent may be lower than the age at which a person can appear in <a href="pornography">pornographic</a> images and films. In many jurisdictions, the minimum age for participation and even viewing such material is 18. As such, in some jurisdictions, films and images showing individuals under the age of 18, but above the age of consent, that meet the legal definition of <a href="child%20pornography">child pornography</a> are prohibited despite the fact that the sexual acts depicted are legal to engage in otherwise under that jurisdiction's age of consent laws. In those cases, it is only the filming of the sex act that is the crime as the act itself would not be considered a sex crime. For example, in the United States under federal law it is a crime to film minors below 18 in sexual acts, even in states where the age of consent is below 18. In those states, charges such as child pornography can be used to prosecute someone having sex with a minor, who could not be otherwise be prosecuted for statutory rape, provided they filmed or photographed the act.

<a href="Jailbait%20images">Jailbait images</a> can be differentiated from <a href="child%20pornography">child pornography</a>, as they do not feature minors before the onset of puberty, nor do they contain nudity. The images are, however, usually sexualized, often featuring <a href="Tween%20%28demographic%29">tween</a> or young teen girls in bikinis, skirts, underwear or lingerie. Whether or not these images are legal is debated. When questioned regarding their legality legal analyst <a href="Jeffrey%20Toobin">Jeffrey Toobin</a> stated he thought it was not illegal, though legal expert <a href="Sunny%20Hostin">Sunny Hostin</a> was more skeptical, describing jailbait images as "borderline" child pornography which may be illegal.

The human <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> continues to develop after puberty. The age of exposure has an influence upon if the immune system can fend off infections in general, and this is also true in the case of some <a href="sexually%20transmitted%20diseases">sexually transmitted diseases</a>. For example, a risk factor for <a href="HPV">HPV</a> strains causing <a href="genital%20wart">genital wart</a>s is sexual debut at a young age; if this extends to the cancer causing strains, then sexual debut at a young age would potentially also increase risk of persistence of HPV infections that cause the very <a href="Human%20papillomavirus%23Cancer">HPV induced cancers</a> that are being diagnosed in spiking numbers of relatively young people.

Age-of-consent reform refers to the efforts of some individuals or groups, for different reasons, to alter or abolish age-of-consent laws. These efforts advocate five main positions:

<doc id="1655" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1655" title="Amalasuntha">
Amalasuntha

Amalasuntha (also known as Amalasuentha, Amalaswintha, Amalasuintha, Amalswinthe or Amalasontha) (30 April 534/535) was a regent of the <a href="Ostrogoths">Ostrogoths</a> from 526 to 534. She was the youngest daughter of <a href="Theoderic%20the%20Great">Theoderic the Great</a>, and firmly believed in the upholding of Roman virtues and values. She is best known for her diplomatic relationship with <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a>, who would invade Italy in response to her assassination.

In 515, Amalasuntha married <a href="Eutharic">Eutharic</a> (522), an Ostrogoth noble of the old <a href="Amali%20dynasty">Amali dynasty</a> who had been previously living in the <a href="Visigothic%20Kingdom%23Arian%20Kingdom%20of%20Hispania">Arian Kingdom of Hispania</a>. Her husband was the son of Widerich (born ), grandson of Berismund (born ), and great-grandson of <a href="Thorismund">Thorismund</a> (died after 400), <a href="Ostrogoths%23Ostrogothic%20rulers">king of the Ostrogoths</a> . It was important to Amalasuntha's father, <a href="Theoderic%20the%20Great">Theoderic the Great</a>, that she marry into a legitimate royal family, lest her own family's legitimacy be questioned.

She was very much an intellectual, and was well known for her extensive knowledge, which included the study of three languages, Latin, Greek and <a href="Gothic%20language">Gothic</a>. In addition, she was a student of philosophy and was said to possess the wisdom of <a href="Solomon">Solomon</a>. Amalasuntha was also described in her day as possessing all of the central <a href="Virtue%23Roman_virtues">Roman virtues</a> expected of a noble woman: Happiness, fertility, and patience, although more emphasis was placed on her virtues within the political realm versus the feminine, something that separates her from other Ostrogoth princesses.

Her husband died, apparently in the early years of her marriage, leaving her with two children, <a href="Athalaric">Athalaric</a> and <a href="Matasuntha">Matasuntha</a> (after 550), wife of <a href="Germanus%20%28cousin%20of%20Justinian%20I%29">Germanus</a>. On the death of her father on 28 August 526, her son succeeded him at the age of ten, but she held the power as <a href="regent">regent</a> for her son. Her tremendous influence in her position as regent can be seen in a <a href="diptych">diptych</a> she appears in alongside her son, Athalaric, in 530. Deeply imbued with the old Roman culture, she gave to that son's education a more refined and literary turn than suited the ideas of her Gothic subjects. Conscious of her unpopularity she banished — and afterwards put to death — three Gothic nobles whom she suspected of conspiring against her rule. At the same time, she opened negotiations with the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine emperor</a> <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a> with the view of removing herself and the Gothic treasure to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. Her son's death in 534 made little change in the posture of affairs.

After Athalaric's death, Amalasuntha became queen, ruling independently only for a short while before making her cousin <a href="Theodahad">Theodahad</a> partner of her throne (not, as sometimes stated, her husband, for his wife was still living), with the intent of strengthening her position. Theodahad was a prominent leader of the Gothic military aristocracy, the very group that so opposed her pro-Roman stances. Amalasuntha believed this pairing would help to make supporters out of her harshest critics. The choice was unfortunate, for Theodahad fostered the disaffection of the Goths, and either by his orders or with his permission, Amalasuntha was imprisoned in the island of Martana in the Tuscan <a href="Lake%20Bolsena">lake of Bolsena</a>, where on 30 April in the spring of 534/535 she was murdered in her bath.

The death of Amalasuntha would give <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian</a> a reason to go to war with the Ostrogoths and attempt to take Italy. According to the Eastern Roman historian <a href="Procopius">Procopius</a>, it is believed that Amalasuntha and Justinian I had a very close diplomatic relationship. More specifically, Procopius believed that Amalasuntha was thinking about handing over Italy to Justinian around the time of her death. Shortly after Amalasuntha's murder, Theodahad was replaced by <a href="Vitiges">Witigis</a>, Amalasuntha's son-in-law. With the people's support, Witigis had Theodahad put to death.

The letters of <a href="Cassiodorus">Cassiodorus</a>, chief minister and literary adviser of Amalasuntha, and the histories of <a href="Procopius">Procopius</a> and <a href="Jordanes">Jordanes</a>, give us our chief information as to the character of Amalasuntha. Cassiodorus was a part of a greater pro-Roman party that desired to Romanize the traditional Ostrogothic kingship, further evidence of the pro-Roman circle that Amalasuntha surrounded herself with.

The life of Amalasuntha was made the subject of a <a href="tragedy">tragedy</a>, the first play written by the young <a href="Carlo%20Goldoni">Carlo Goldoni</a> and presented at <a href="Milan">Milan</a> in 1733.

Amalric of Bena

Amalric of Bena (; ; died 1204–1207 AD) was a <a href="France">French</a> <a href="theology">theologian</a> and <a href="sect">sect</a> leader, after whom the <a href="Amalricians">Amalricians</a> are named.

Amalric was born in the latter part of the 12th century at Bennes, a village between <a href="Oll%C3%A9">Ollé</a> and <a href="Chauffours">Chauffours</a> in the <a href="diocese%20of%20Chartres">diocese of Chartres</a>.

Amalric taught philosophy and theology at the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">University of Paris</a> and enjoyed a great reputation as a subtle <a href="dialectic">dialectic</a>ian; his lectures developing the <a href="philosophy%20of%20Aristotle">philosophy of Aristotle</a> attracted a large circle of hearers. In 1204 his doctrines were condemned by the university, and, on a personal appeal to <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20III">Pope Innocent III</a>, the sentence was ratified, Amalric being ordered to return to Paris and recant his errors.

His death was caused, it is said, by grief at the humiliation to which he had been subjected.
In 1209 ten of his followers were burnt before the gates of Paris, and Amalric's own body was exhumed and burnt and the ashes given to the winds. The doctrines of his followers, known as the <a href="Amalrician">Amalrician</a>s, were formally condemned by the <a href="Fourth%20Council%20of%20the%20Lateran">fourth Lateran Council</a> in 1215.

Amalric appears to have derived his philosophical system from <a href="Johannes%20Scotus%20Eriugena">Eriugena</a>, whose principles he developed in a one-sided and strongly <a href="pantheist">pantheist</a>ic form.

Three propositions only can with certainty be attributed to him:

Because of the first proposition, God himself is thought as invisible and only recognizable in his creation.

These three propositions were further developed by his followers, who maintained that God revealed Himself in a threefold revelation, the first in the Biblical patriarch <a href="Abraham">Abraham</a>, marking the "epoch of the Father"; the second in <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a>, who began the "epoch of the Son"; and the third in Amalric and his disciples, who inaugurated the "era of the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Ghost</a>."

Amalricians taught:

Due to persecutions, this sect does not appear to have long survived the death of its founder. Not long after the burning of ten of their members (1210), the sect itself lost its importance, while some of the surviving Amalricians became <a href="Brethren%20of%20the%20Free%20Spirit">Brethren of the Free Spirit</a>.

According to <a href="Hosea%20Ballou">Hosea Ballou</a>, then <a href="Pierre%20Batiffol">Pierre Batiffol</a> and <a href="George%20T.%20Knight%20%28Universalist%29">George T. Knight</a> (1914) Amalric was a believer that all people would eventually be saved and this was one of the counts upon which he was declared a heretic by <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20III">Pope Innocent III</a>.

Afonso I of Portugal

Afonso I (1106/ 25 July 1109 /11116 December 1185), nicknamed "the Conqueror" (), "the Founder" () or "the Great" () by the <a href="Portuguese%20people">Portuguese</a>, and "El-Bortukali" [in Arabic البرتقالي] ("the Portuguese") and "Ibn-Arrink" [in Arabic ابن الرَّنك or ابن الرَنْق] ("son of Henry", "Henriques") by the <a href="Moors">Moors</a> whom he fought, was the first <a href="King%20of%20Portugal">King of Portugal</a>. He achieved the independence of the southern part of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Galicia">Kingdom of Galicia</a>, the County of Portugal, from Galicia's overlord, the <a href="King%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">King of León</a>, in 1139, establishing a new kingdom and doubling its area with the "<a href="Reconquista">Reconquista</a>", an objective that he pursued until his death, in 1185, after forty-six years of wars against the Moors.

Afonso was the son of <a href="Henry%2C%20Count%20of%20Portugal">Henry of Burgundy</a> and <a href="Theresa%2C%20Countess%20of%20Portugal">Theresa</a>, the natural daughter of King <a href="Alfonso%20VI%20of%20Le%C3%B3n%20and%20Castile">Alfonso VI of León and Castile</a>. According to <a href="Fern%C3%A3o%20Lopes">Fernão Lopes</a>' "Crónica de Portugal de 1419," the future Portuguese king was born in <a href="Guimar%C3%A3es">Guimarães</a>, which was at the time the most important political center of his parents. This was accepted by most Portuguese scholarship until Torquato de Sousa Soares proposed in 1990 Coimbra, the center of the county of Coimbra and another political center of Afonso's progenitors, as his birthplace, which caused a huge outrage in Guimarães and a polemic between this historian and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Hermano%20Saraiva">José Hermano Saraiva</a>. Almeida Fernandes later proposed <a href="Viseu">Viseu</a> as the birth place of Afonso basing himself on the "<a href="Chronica%20Gothorum">Chronica Gothorum</a>", which states Afonso was born in 1109, a position followed by <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Mattoso">José Mattoso</a> in his biography of the king. Abel Estefânio has suggested a different date and thesis, proposing 1106 as the birth date and the region of <a href="Tierra%20de%20Campos">Tierra de Campos</a> or even <a href="Sahag%C3%BAn">Sahagún</a> as likely birth places based on the known itineraries of counts Henry and Teresa. 

The pair reigned jointly as count and countess of Portugal until Henry's death on 22 May 1112 during the siege of <a href="Astorga%2C%20Spain">Astorga</a>, after which Theresa reigned alone.

It is not known who was the tutor of Afonso. Later traditions, probably started with João Soares Coelho (a bastard descendant of Egas Moniz through a female line) in the mid-13th century and ampliated by later chronicles such as the "Crónica de Portugal de 1419", asserted he had been <a href="Egas%20Moniz%20o%20Aio">Egas Moniz de Ribadouro</a>, possibly with the help of oral memories that associated the tutor to the house of Ribadouto. Yet, contemporary documents, namely from the chancery of Afonso in his early years as count of Portucale, indicate according to José Mattoso that the most likely tutor of Afonso Henriques was Egas Moniz's oldest brother, <a href="Erm%C3%ADgio%20Moniz">Ermígio Moniz</a>, who, besides being the senior brother within the family of Ribadouro, became the "dapifer" and "<a href="Mayor%20of%20the%20Palace">majordomus</a>" of Afonso I from 1128 until his death in 1135, which indicates his closer proximity to the prince.

In an effort to pursue a larger share in the Leonese inheritance, his mother Theresa joined forces with <a href="Fernando%20P%C3%A9rez%20de%20Trava">Fernando Pérez de Trava</a>, the most powerful count in <a href="kingdom%20of%20Galicia">Galicia</a>. The Portuguese nobility disliked the alliance between Galicia and Portugal and rallied around Afonso. The <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Braga">Archbishop of Braga</a> was also concerned with the dominance of Galicia, apprehensive of the ecclesiastical pretensions of his new rival the Galician <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Santiago%20de%20Compostela">Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela</a>, <a href="Diego%20Gelm%C3%ADrez">Diego Gelmírez</a>, who had claimed an alleged discovery of relics of <a href="James%2C%20son%20of%20Zebedee">Saint James</a> in his town, as a way to gain power and riches over the other cathedrals in the Iberian Peninsula. In 1122, Afonso turned fourteen, the adult age in the 12th century. He made himself a <a href="knight">knight</a> on his own account in the <a href="Cathedral%20of%20Zamora">Cathedral of Zamora</a> in 1125, with the permission of her mother and her husband. After the military campaign of Alfonso VII against his mother in 1127, Afonso revolted against her and proceeded to take control of the county from its queen.

In 1128, near <a href="Guimar%C3%A3es">Guimarães</a>, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20S%C3%A3o%20Mamede">Battle of São Mamede</a> Afonso and his supporters overcame troops under his Count <a href="Fernando%20Peres%20de%20Trava">Fernando Peres de Trava</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Galicia">Galicia</a>. Afonso exiled his mother to Galicia, and took over rule of the County of Portucale. Thus the possibility of re-incorporating Portugal (up to then known as Southern Galicia) into a Kingdom of Portugal and Galicia as before was eliminated and Afonso became sole ruler following demands for independence from the county's church and nobles. He also vanquished his mother's nephew, <a href="Alfonso%20VII%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Alfonso VII of León</a>, who came to her rescue, and thus freed the country from political dependence on the crown of his cousin of León. On 6 April 1129, Afonso Henriques dictated the <a href="writ">writ</a> in which he proclaimed himself Prince of Portugal.

Afonso then turned his arms against the persistent problem of the Moors in the south. His campaigns were successful and, on 25 July 1139, he obtained an overwhelming victory in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ourique">Battle of Ourique</a>, and straight after was possibly unanimously proclaimed King of the Portuguese by his soldiers, establishing his equality in rank to the other realms of the Peninsula, although the first reference to his royal title dates from 1140. The first assembly of the <a href="Portuguese%20Cortes">Portuguese Cortes</a> convened at <a href="Lamego">Lamego</a> (wherein he would have been given the crown from the Archbishop of Braga, to confirm his independence) is a 17th-century embellishment of Portuguese history.

Independence from Alfonso VII of León's <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a>, however, was not a thing he just could achieve militarily. The County of Portugal still had to be acknowledged diplomatically by the neighboring lands as a kingdom and, most importantly, by the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> and the <a href="Pope">Pope</a>. Afonso wed <a href="Mafalda%20of%20Savoy%2C%20Queen%20of%20Portugal">Mafalda of Savoy</a>, daughter of <a href="Amadeus%20III%2C%20Count%20of%20Savoy">Amadeus III, Count of Savoy</a>, and sent ambassadors to Rome to negotiate with the Pope. He succeeded in renouncing the suzerainty of his cousin, Alfonso VII of León, becoming instead a vassal of the papacy, as the kings of Sicily and Aragon had done before him. In 1179 the bull "<a href="Manifestis%20Probatum">Manifestis Probatum</a>" accepted the new king as vassal to the pope exclusively.

In Portugal he built several monasteries and convents and bestowed important privileges to religious orders. He is notably the builder of <a href="Alcoba%C3%A7a%20Monastery">Alcobaça Monastery</a>, to which he called the <a href="Cistercians">Cistercian Order</a> of his uncle <a href="Bernard%20of%20Clairvaux">Bernard of Clairvaux</a> of <a href="Burgundy%20%28region%29">Burgundy</a>. In 1143, he wrote to <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20II">Pope Innocent II</a> to declare himself and the kingdom servants of the church, swearing to pursue driving the Moors out of the Iberian Peninsula. Bypassing any king of León, Afonso declared himself the direct <a href="wikt%3Aliege">liege man</a> of the papacy. Afonso continued to distinguish himself by his exploits against the Moors, from whom he wrested <a href="Santar%C3%A9m%2C%20Portugal">Santarém</a> (see <a href="Conquest%20of%20Santar%C3%A9m">Conquest of Santarém</a>) and <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> in 1147 (see <a href="Siege%20of%20Lisbon">Siege of Lisbon</a>). He also conquered an important part of the land south of the <a href="Tagus">Tagus</a> River, although this was lost again to the Moors in the following years.

Meanwhile, King Alfonso VII of León (Afonso's cousin) regarded the independent ruler of Portugal as nothing but a rebel. Conflict between the two was constant and bitter in the following years. Afonso became involved in a war, taking the side of the Aragonese king, an enemy of Castile. To ensure the alliance, his son <a href="Sancho%20I%20of%20Portugal">Sancho</a> was engaged to <a href="Dulce%20of%20Aragon">Dulce</a>, sister of the <a href="Count%20of%20Barcelona">Count of Barcelona</a> and Infanta of Aragon. Finally after winning the <a href="Battle%20of%20Valdevez">Battle of Valdevez</a>, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Zamora%20%281143%29">Treaty of Zamora (1143)</a> established peace between the cousins and the recognition by the Kingdom of León that Portugal was a sovereign kingdom.

In 1169 the now old Dom Afonso was possibly disabled in an engagement near <a href="Badajoz">Badajoz</a> by a fall from his horse, and made prisoner by the soldiers of the king of León <a href="Ferdinand%20II%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Fernando II</a> also his son-in-law. From this time onward, the Portuguese king never rode a horse again, but it is not certain this was because of the disability: according to the later Portuguese chronistic tradition, this happened because Afonso would have to surrender himself again to Fernando II of León or risk war between the two kingdoms if he rode a horse. Portugal was obliged to surrender as his ransom almost all the conquests Afonso had made in Galicia (north of the <a href="Minho%20River">Minho River</a>) in the previous years.

In 1179 the privileges and favours given to the Roman Catholic Church were compensated. In the <a href="papal%20bull">papal bull</a> " <a href="Manifestis%20Probatum">Manifestis Probatum</a>", <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20III">Pope Alexander III</a> acknowledged Afonso as king and Portugal as an independent crown with the right to conquer lands from the Moors. With this papal blessing, Portugal was at last secured as a kingdom.

In 1184, the Almohad caliph <a href="Abu%20Yaqub%20Yusuf">Abu Yaqub Yusuf</a> rallied a great <a href="Almohad%20Caliphate">Almohad</a> force to retaliate against the Portuguese raids done since the end of a five year truce in 1178 and besieged <a href="Santar%C3%A9m%2C%20Portugal">Santarém</a>, which was defended by the heir <a href="Sancho%20I%20of%20Portugal">Sancho</a>. The Almohad siege failed when news arrived the archbishop of Compostela had come to the defense of the city and Fernando II of León himself with his army. The Almohads ended the siege and their retreat turned into a rout due to panic in their camp, with the Almohad caliph being injured in the process (according to one version, because of a <a href="crossbow">crossbow</a> bolt) and dying on the way back to <a href="Seville">Seville</a>. Afonso died shortly after, probably out of a sudden cause of death, on 6 December 1185. The Portuguese revere him as a hero, both on account of his personal character and as the founder of their nation. There are mythical stories that it took 10 men to carry his sword, and that Afonso wanted to engage other monarchs in personal combat, but no one would dare accept his challenge.

In July 2006, the tomb of the king (which is located in the <a href="Monastery%20of%20Santa%20Cruz%20%28Coimbra%29">Santa Cruz Monastery</a> in <a href="Coimbra">Coimbra</a>) was to be opened for scientific purposes by researchers from the <a href="University%20of%20Coimbra">University of Coimbra</a> (Portugal) and the <a href="University%20of%20Granada">University of Granada</a> (Spain). The opening of the tomb provoked considerable concern among some sectors of Portuguese society and <a href="IPPAR">IPPAR</a> – "Instituto Português do Património Arquitectónico" (Portuguese State Agency for Architectural Patrimony). The government halted the opening, requesting more protocols from the scientific team because of the importance of the king in the nation's formation.

These are the known ancestors of Afonso Henriques, going back five generations.

In 1146, Afonso married <a href="Matilda%20of%20Savoy%2C%20Queen%20of%20Portugal">Mafalda</a>, daughter of <a href="Amadeus%20III%2C%20Count%20of%20Savoy">Amadeus III, Count of Savoy</a> and <a href="Mahaut%20of%20Albon">Mahaut of Albon</a>, both appearing together for the first time in May of that year confirming royal charters. They had the following issue:


Before his marriage to Mafalda, King Afonso fathered his first male son with Chamoa Gómez, daughter of Count <a href="G%C3%B3mez%20N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez">Gómez Núñez</a> and Elvira Pérez, sister of <a href="Fernando%20P%C3%A9rez%20de%20Traba">Fernando</a> and <a href="Bermudo%20P%C3%A9rez%20de%20Traba">Bermudo Pérez de Traba</a>:

Afonso II of Portugal

Afonso II (; English: "Alphonzo"), or "Affonso" (Archaic Portuguese), "Alfonso" or "Alphonso" (<a href="Portuguese-Galician%20languages">Portuguese-Galician</a>) or "Alphonsus" (<a href="Latin">Latin</a> version), nicknamed "the Fat" (<a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> "o Gordo"), <a href="List%20of%20Portuguese%20monarchs">King of Portugal</a>, was born in <a href="Coimbra">Coimbra</a> on 23 April 1185 and died on 25 March 1223 in the same city. He was the second but eldest surviving son of <a href="Sancho%20I%20of%20Portugal">Sancho I of Portugal</a> by his wife, <a href="Dulce%20of%20Aragon">Dulce</a>, "<a href="Infante">Infanta</a>" of <a href="Crown%20of%20Aragon">Aragon</a>. Afonso succeeded his father on 27 March 1211.

As a king, Afonso II set a different approach of government. Hitherto, his father Sancho I and his grandfather <a href="Afonso%20I%20of%20Portugal">Afonso I</a> were mostly concerned with military issues either against the neighbouring <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Kingdom of Castile</a> or against the <a href="Moors">Moorish</a> lands in the south. Afonso did not pursue territory enlargement policies and managed to insure peace with Castile during his reign. Despite this, some towns, like <a href="Alc%C3%A1cer%20do%20Sal">Alcácer do Sal</a> in 1217, were conquered from the Moors by the private initiative of noblemen. This does not mean that he was a weak or somehow cowardly man. The first years of his reign were marked instead by internal disturbances between Afonso and his brothers and sisters. The king managed to keep security within Portuguese borders only by outlawing and exiling his kin.

Since military issues were not a government priority, Afonso established the state's administration and centralized power on himself. He designed the first set of Portuguese written laws. These were mainly concerned with <a href="private%20property">private property</a>, civil justice, and <a href="Mint%20%28coin%29">minting</a>. Afonso also sent ambassadors to European kingdoms outside the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a> and began amicable commercial relations with most of them.

Other reforms included the always delicate matters with the pope. In order to get the independence of Portugal recognized by Rome, his grandfather, Afonso I, had to legislate an enormous number of privileges to the Church. These eventually created a state within the state. With Portugal's position as a country firmly established, Afonso II endeavoured to weaken the power of the clergy and to apply a portion of the enormous revenues of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> to purposes of national utility. These actions led to a serious diplomatic conflict between the pope and Portugal. After being <a href="excommunicated">excommunicated</a> for his audacities by <a href="Pope%20Honorius%20III">Pope Honorius III</a>, Afonso II promised to make amends to the church, but he died in Coimbra on 25 March 1223 before making any serious attempts to do so.

King Afonso was buried originally at the <a href="Monastery%20of%20Santa%20Cruz%20%28Coimbra%29">Monastery of Santa Cruz</a> in Coimbra where his body remained for nearly ten years. His remains were transferred subsequently to <a href="Alcoba%C3%A7a%20Monastery">Alcobaça Monastery</a>, as he had stipulated in his will. He and his wife, Queen Urraca, were buried at its Royal Pantheon.

In 1206, he married his fourth cousin Infanta <a href="Urraca%20of%20Castile%2C%20Queen%20of%20Portugal">Urraca of Castile</a>, daughter of <a href="Alfonso%20VIII%20of%20Castile">Alfonso VIII of Castile</a> and <a href="Eleanor%20of%20England%2C%20Queen%20of%20Castile">Eleanor of England</a>, both being descendants of King <a href="Alfonso%20VI%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Alfonso VI of León</a>. The offspring of this marriage were:


Out of wedlock, he had two illegitimate sons:

Afonso III of Portugal

Afonso III (; rare English alternatives: "Alphonzo" or "Alphonse"), or "Affonso" (Archaic Portuguese), "Alfonso" or "Alphonso" (<a href="Portuguese-Galician%20languages">Portuguese-Galician</a>) or "Alphonsus" (<a href="Latin">Latin</a>), the "Bolognian" (<a href="Portuguese%20language">Port.</a> "o Bolonhês"), <a href="List%20of%20Portuguese%20monarchs">King of Portugal</a> (5 May 121016 February 1279) was the first to use the title "King of Portugal and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Algarve">Algarve</a>", from 1249. He was the second son of King <a href="Afonso%20II%20of%20Portugal">Afonso II of Portugal</a> and his wife, <a href="Urraca%20of%20Castile%2C%20Queen%20of%20Portugal">Urraca of Castile</a>; he succeeded his brother, King <a href="Sancho%20II%20of%20Portugal">Sancho II of Portugal</a>, who died on 4 January 1248.

Afonso was born in <a href="Coimbra">Coimbra</a>. As the second son of King <a href="Afonso%20II%20of%20Portugal">Afonso II of Portugal</a>, he was not expected to inherit the throne, which was destined to go to his elder brother Sancho.

He lived mostly in France, where he married Matilda, the heiress of <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne</a>, in 1238, thereby becoming <a href="Count%20of%20Boulogne">Count of Boulogne</a>, <a href="Mortain">Mortain</a>, <a href="Aumale">Aumale</a> and <a href="Dammartin-en-Go%C3%ABle">Dammartin-en-Goële</a> "<a href="jure%20uxoris">jure uxoris</a>".

In 1246, conflicts between his brother, the king, and the church became unbearable. In 1247, <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20IV">Pope Innocent IV</a> ordered Sancho II to be removed from the throne and to be replaced by the Count of Boulogne. Afonso, of course, did not refuse the papal order and consequently marched to Portugal. Since Sancho was not a popular king and the order was not hard to enforce, he fled in exile to Toledo, Castile, where he died on 4 January 1248. Until his brother's death and his own eventual coronation, Afonso retained and used the title of "Visitador, Curador e Defensor do Reino" (Overseer, Curator and Defender of the Kingdom).

In order to ascend the throne Afonso abdicated his rights to the county of Boulogne in 1248. In 1253, he divorced Matilde in order to marry <a href="Beatrice%20of%20Castile%20%281242%E2%80%931303%29">Beatrice of Castile</a>, illegitimate daughter of <a href="Alfonso%20X%20of%20Castile">Alfonso X, King of Castile</a>, and <a href="Mayor%20Guill%C3%A9n%20de%20Guzm%C3%A1n">Mayor Guillén de Guzmán</a>.

Determined not to make the same mistakes as his brother, Afonso III paid special attention to what the middle class, composed of merchants and small land owners, had to say. In 1254, in the city of <a href="Leiria">Leiria</a>, he held the first session of the "<a href="Portuguese%20Cortes">Cortes</a>", a general assembly comprising the nobility, the middle class and representatives of all <a href="municipalities">municipalities</a>. He also made laws intended to restrain the upper classes from abusing the least favored part of the population. Remembered as a notable administrator, Afonso III founded several towns, granted the title of city to many others and reorganized public administration.

Afonso showed extraordinary vision for the time. Progressive measures taken during his kingship include: representatives of the commons, besides the nobility and clergy, were involved in governance; the end of preventive arrests such that henceforward all arrests had to be first presented to a judge to determine the detention measure; and fiscal innovation, such as negotiating extraordinary taxes with the mercantile classes and direct taxation of the Church, rather than debasement of the coinage. These may have led to his excommunication by the holy see and possibly precipitated his death, and his son <a href="Denis%20of%20Portugal">Denis</a>'s premature rise to the throne at only 18 years old.

Secure on the throne, Afonso III then proceeded to make war with the Muslim communities that still thrived in the south. In his reign the <a href="Algarve">Algarve</a> became part of the kingdom, following the capture of <a href="Faro%2C%20Portugal">Faro</a>.

Following his success against the Moors, Afonso III had to deal with a political situation concerning the country's borders with Castile. The neighbouring kingdom considered that the newly acquired lands of the Algarve should be Castilian, not Portuguese, which led to a series of wars between the two kingdoms. Finally, in 1267, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Badajoz%20%281267%29">Treaty of Badajoz (1267)</a> was signed in <a href="Badajoz">Badajoz</a>, determining that the southern border between Castile and Portugal should be the River <a href="Guadiana">Guadiana</a>, as it is today.

Afonso died in <a href="Alcoba%C3%A7a%20%28Portugal%29">Alcobaça</a>, <a href="Coimbra">Coimbra</a> or <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, aged 68.

Afonso's first wife was <a href="Matilda%20II%2C%20Countess%20of%20Boulogne">Matilda II, Countess of Boulogne</a>, daughter of <a href="Renaud%2C%20Count%20of%20Dammartin">Renaud, Count of Dammartin</a>, and <a href="Ida%2C%20Countess%20of%20Boulogne">Ida, Countess of Boulogne</a>. They had no surviving children. He divorced Matilda in 1253 and, in the same year, married <a href="Beatrice%20of%20Castile%20%281242%E2%80%931303%29">Beatrice of Castile</a>, illegitimate daughter of <a href="Alfonso%20X%20of%20Castile">Alfonso X, King of Castile</a>, and <a href="Mayor%20Guill%C3%A9n%20de%20Guzm%C3%A1n">Mayor Guillén de Guzmán</a>.

Afonso IV of Portugal

Afonso IV (; 8 February 129128 May 1357), called the Brave (), was <a href="King%20of%20Portugal%20and%20the%20Algarves">King of Portugal and the Algarves</a> from 1325 until his death. He was the only legitimate son of King <a href="Denis%20of%20Portugal">Denis of Portugal</a> by his wife <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Aragon">Elizabeth of Aragon</a>.

Afonso, born in <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, was the rightful heir to the Portuguese throne. However, he was not Denis' favourite son, the old king preferring his illegitimate son, Afonso Sanches. The notorious rivalry between the half brothers led to civil war several times. On 7 January 1325, Afonso's father died and he became king, whereupon he exiled his rival to <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Castile</a>, and stripped him of all the lands and <a href="fiefdom">fiefdom</a> given by their father. From Castile, Afonso orchestrated a series of attempts to usurp the crown. After a few failed attempts at invasion, the brothers signed a peace treaty, arranged by Afonso's mother Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Aragon">Elizabeth</a>.

In 1309, Afonso IV married Infanta <a href="Beatrice%20of%20Castile%20%281293%E2%80%931359%29">Beatrice of Castile</a>, daughter of King <a href="Sancho%20IV%20of%20Castile">Sancho IV of Castile</a> by his wife <a href="Mar%C3%ADa%20de%20Molina">María de Molina</a>. The first-born of this union was Infanta <a href="Maria%20of%20Portugal%2C%20Queen%20of%20Castile">Maria of Portugal</a>.

In 1325 <a href="Alfonso%20XI%20of%20Castile">Alfonso XI of Castile</a> entered a child-marriage with <a href="Constanza%20Manuel">Constanza Manuel</a> of Castile, the daughter of one of his regents. Two years later, he had the marriage annulled so he could marry Afonso's daughter, Maria of Portugal. Maria became Queen of Castile in 1328 upon her marriage to Alfonso XI, who soon became involved publicly with a mistress. Constanza was imprisoned in a castle in Toro while her father, <a href="Juan%20Manuel%2C%20Prince%20of%20Villena">Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena</a>, waged war against Alfonso XI until 1329. Eventually, the two reached a peaceful accord after mediation by Juan del Campo, Bishop of Oviedo; this secured Constance's release from prison.

The public humiliation of his daughter led Afonso IV to have his son and heir, <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Portugal">Peter</a>, marry the no less aggrieved Castilian infanta, Constanza. Afonso subsequently started a war against Castile, peace arriving four years later, through the intervention of the Infanta Maria herself. A year after the peace treaty was signed in <a href="Seville">Seville</a>, Portuguese troops played an important role in defeating the <a href="Moors">Moors</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20R%C3%ADo%20Salado">Battle of Río Salado</a> in October 1340.

Political intrigue marked the last part of Afonso IV's reign, although Castille was torn by civil war after Alfonso XI died. <a href="Henry%20of%20Trast%C3%A1mara">Henry of Trastámara</a> challenged the new King <a href="Pedro%20of%20Castile">Pedro of Castile</a>, who sent many Castilian <a href="nobility">nobles</a> into exile in Portugal. Afonso's heir, <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Portugal">Pedro</a>, fell in love with his new wife's lady-in-waiting, <a href="In%C3%AAs%20de%20Castro">Inês de Castro</a>. Inês was the daughter of an important noble family from <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Galicia">Galicia</a>, with links (albeit illegitimate) to both the royal houses of Castile and Portugal. Her brothers were aligned with the Trastamara faction, and became favorites of crown prince Pedro, much to the dismay of others at the Portuguese court, who considered them Castilian upstarts. When <a href="Constance%20of%20Pe%C3%B1afiel">Constance of Peñafiel</a> died weeks after giving birth to their third child, Pedro began living openly with Inês, recognized all her children as his and repudiated the idea of marrying anyone other than Inês herself. His father refused to go to war again against Castile, hoping his heir's infatuation would end, and tried to arrange another dynastic marriage for Pedro.

The situation became worse as the years passed and the aging Afonso lost control over his court. His grandson and Pedro's only legitimate son, future king <a href="Ferdinand%20I%20of%20Portugal">Fernando of Portugal</a>, was a sickly child, while Inês' illegitimate children thrived. Worried about his legitimate grandson's life, and the growing power of Castile within Portugal's borders, Afonso ordered Inês de Castro first imprisoned in his mother's old convent in <a href="Coimbra">Coimbra</a>, and then murdered in 1355. He expected his son to give in and marry a princess, but the heir became enraged upon learning of his lover's decapitation in front of their young child. Pedro put himself at the head of an army and devastated the country between the <a href="Douro">Douro</a> and the <a href="Minho%20River">Minho</a> rivers before he was reconciled to his father in early 1357. Afonso died almost immediately after, in Lisbon in May.

Afonso IV's nickname "the Brave" alludes to his martial exploits. However, his most important accomplishments were the relative peace enjoyed by the country during his long reign and the support he gave to the <a href="Portuguese%20Navy">Portuguese Navy</a>. Afonso granted public funding to raise a proper commercial fleet and ordered the first Portuguese maritime explorations. The conflict with Pedro, and the explorations he initiated, eventually became the foundation of the Portuguese national epic, "<a href="Os%20Lus%C3%ADadas">Os Lusíadas</a>" by <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20de%20Cam%C3%B5es">Luís de Camões</a>.

The dramatic circumstances of the relationship between father and son and Inês de Castro was used as the basis for the plot of more than twenty operas and ballets, as well as the "Nise lastimosa" and "Nise laureada" (1577) by <a href="Jer%C3%B3nimo%20Berm%C3%BAdez">Jerónimo Bermúdez</a>, 'Reinar despues de morir' by <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20V%C3%A9lez%20de%20Guevara">Luís Vélez de Guevara</a>, "Inez de Castro" by <a href="Mary%20Russell%20Mitford">Mary Russell Mitford</a>, and La Reine morte (The Dead Queen) by <a href="Henry%20de%20Montherlant">Henry de Montherlant</a>. The story with its tragic denouement is immortalized in several plays and poems in Portuguese, such as "<a href="Os%20Lus%C3%ADadas">The Lusíadas</a>" by <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20de%20Cam%C3%B5es">Luís de Camões</a> (canto iii, stanzas 118-135), and in Spanish, including "Nise lastimosa" and "Nise laureada" (1577) by <a href="Jer%C3%B3nimo%20Berm%C3%BAdez">Jerónimo Bermúdez</a>, "Reinar despues de morir" by <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20V%C3%A9lez%20de%20Guevara">Luís Vélez de Guevara</a>, as well as a play by French playwright <a href="Henry%20de%20Montherlant">Henry de Montherlant</a> called "La Reine morte" ("The Dead Queen"). <a href="Mary%20Russell%20Mitford">Mary Russell Mitford</a> also wrote a drama based on the story entitled "Inez de Castro". "Inês de Castro" is a novel by <a href="Maria%20Pilar%20Queralt%20del%20Hierro">Maria Pilar Queralt del Hierro</a> in Spanish and Portuguese.

On 12 September 1309, Afonso married <a href="Beatrice%20of%20Castile%20%281293%E2%80%931359%29">Beatrice of Castile</a>, daughter of <a href="Sancho%20IV%20of%20Castile">Sancho IV of Castile</a>, and <a href="Mar%C3%ADa%20de%20Molina">María de Molina</a>, and had four sons and three daughters. Afonso broke the tradition of previous kings and did not have any children out of wedlock.

Afonso V of Portugal

Afonso V () <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">KG</a> (15 January 1432 – 28 August 1481), called the African (), was <a href="List%20of%20Portuguese%20monarchs">King of Portugal</a> and of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Algarve">the Algarves</a>. His sobriquet refers to his conquests in <a href="Northern%20Africa">Northern Africa</a>. As of 1471, Afonso V was the first king of Portugal to claim dominion over a plural "Kingdom of the Algarves," instead of the singular "Kingdom of the Algarve." Territories added to the Portuguese crown lands in North Africa during the 15th century came to be referred to as possessions of the Kingdom of the Algarve (now a region of southern Portugal), not the Kingdom of Portugal. The "Algarves" then were considered to be the southern Portuguese territories on both sides of the <a href="Strait%20of%20Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a>.

Afonso was born in <a href="Sintra">Sintra</a>, the eldest son of King <a href="Edward%20of%20Portugal">Edward of Portugal</a> by his wife <a href="Leonor%20of%20Aragon%20%281402-1445%29">Eleanor of Aragon</a>. Afonso V was only six years old when he succeeded his father in 1438.

During his minority, Afonso V was placed under the regency of his mother in accordance with a will of his late father. As both a foreigner and a woman, the queen was not a popular choice for regent. Opposition rose and without any important ally among the Portuguese aristocracy other than <a href="Afonso%2C%20Duke%20of%20Braganza">Afonso, Count of Barcelos</a>, the illegitimate half brother of King Edward, the queen's position was untenable. In 1439, the <a href="Portuguese%20Cortes">Portuguese Cortes</a> (assembly of the kingdom) decided to replace the queen with <a href="Peter%2C%20Duke%20of%20Coimbra">Peter, Duke of Coimbra</a> (Dom Pedro), the young king's oldest uncle.

Peter's main policies were concerned with restricting the political power of the great noble houses and expanding the powers of the crown. The country prospered under his rule, but not peacefully, as his laws interfered with the ambition of powerful nobles. The count of Barcelos, a personal enemy of the Duke of Coimbra (despite being half-brothers) eventually became the king's favourite uncle and began a constant struggle for power. In 1442, the king made Afonso the first <a href="Duke%20of%20Braganza">Duke of Braganza</a>. With this title and its lands, he became the most powerful man in Portugal and one of the richest men in Europe. To secure his position as regent, Peter had Afonso marry his daughter, <a href="Isabella%20of%20Coimbra">Isabella of Coimbra</a>, in 1445.

But on 9 June 1448, when the king came of age, Peter had to surrender his power to Afonso V. The years of conspiracy by the Duke of Braganza finally came to a head. On 15 September of the same year, Afonso V nullified all the laws and edicts approved under the regency. In the following year, led by what were later discovered to be false accusations, Afonso declared Peter a rebel and defeated his army in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alfarrobeira">Battle of Alfarrobeira</a>, in which his uncle (and father-in-law) was killed. After this battle and the loss of one of Portugal's most remarkable infantes, the Duke of Braganza became the "de facto" ruler of the country.

Afonso V then turned his attentions to North Africa. In the reign of his grandfather <a href="John%20I%20of%20Portugal">John I</a>, <a href="Ceuta">Ceuta</a> had been conquered from the king of <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, and now the new king wanted to expand the conquests. The king's army conquered <a href="Alc%C3%A1cer%20Ceguer">Alcácer Ceguer</a> in 1458 and <a href="Conquest%20of%20Arzila">Arzila</a> in 1471. <a href="Tangiers">Tangiers</a>, on the other hand, was won and lost several times between 1460 and 1464. These achievements granted the king the nickname of "the African" or "Africano". The king also supported the exploration of the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> led by prince <a href="Henry%20the%20Navigator">Henry the Navigator</a> but after Henry's death in 1460, he did nothing to continue Henry's work. Administratively, Afonso V was a passive king. He chose not to pursue the revision of laws or development of commerce, preferring instead to preserve the legacy of his father Edward and grandfather <a href="John%20I%20of%20Portugal">John I</a>.

In 1452, <a href="Pope%20Nicholas%20V">Pope Nicholas V</a> issued the <a href="papal%20bull">papal bull</a> "<a href="Dum%20Diversas">Dum Diversas</a>", which granted Afonso V the right to reduce "Saracens, pagans and any other unbelievers" to hereditary slavery. This was reaffirmed and extended in the <a href="Romanus%20Pontifex">Romanus Pontifex</a> bull of 1455 (also by Nicholas V). These papal bulls came to be seen by some as a justification for the subsequent era of slave trade and European colonialism.

When the campaigns in Africa were over, Afonso V found new grounds for battle in neighboring <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Castile</a>. On December 11, 1474 King <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20Castile">Henry IV of Castile</a> died without a male heir, leaving from his two marriages only a daughter, <a href="Joanna%20la%20Beltraneja">Joanna la Beltraneja</a> (1462-1530). But her paternity was questioned; it was rumored that his queen <a href="Joan%20of%20Portugal">Joan of Portugal</a> had an affair with a nobleman named <a href="Beltr%C3%A1n%20de%20La%20Cueva">Beltrán de La Cueva</a>. The birth of princess Joanna in 1462, openly called "La Beltraneja", caused the separation of her parents. She was never considered legitimate and, when the king was dying, no one took her as a serious contender for the crown. Her father's half-sister, the future Queen <a href="Isabella%20I%20of%20Castile">Isabella I of Castile</a>, was due to inherit the crown, but Afonso V was persuaded to intervene in the succession. In 1475, he <a href="Pedigree%20collapse">married his niece</a> Joanna, whom he considered the legitimate heir to the crown. He proclaimed himself King of Castile and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">León</a> and prepared to defend his wife's rights. After the indecisive <a href="Battle%20of%20Toro">Battle of Toro</a> in 1476 against King <a href="Ferdinand%20II%20of%20Aragon">Ferdinand II of Aragon</a>, the husband of Isabella I of Castile, Afonso went to <a href="France">France</a> to obtain the assistance of King <a href="Louis%20XI%20of%20France">Louis XI</a>, but finding himself deceived by the French monarch, he returned to Portugal in 1477. Disillusioned, he abdicated for a few days in November 1477 in favor of his son <a href="John%20II%20of%20Portugal">John II</a>, then after returning to the throne, he retired to a monastery in Sintra, where he died in 1481.

Afonso married firstly, in 1447, with <a href="Isabella%20of%20Coimbra">Isabella of Coimbra</a>, with whom he had three children: 


Afonso married secondly, in 1475, with <a href="Joanna%20la%20Beltraneja">Joanna of Castile</a>, known as "La Beltraneja", but no children was born of this marriage.

Afonso VI of Portugal

Afonso VI (; English: "Alphonzo" or "Alphonse", Old Portuguese: "Affonso"; 21 August 164312 September 1683), known as "the Victorious" (), was the second <a href="list%20of%20Portuguese%20monarchs">King of Portugal</a> and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Algarve">Algarves</a> of the <a href="House%20of%20Braganza">House of Braganza</a> from 1656 until his death. He was initially under the regency of his mother, <a href="Luisa%20of%20Medina-Sidonia">Luisa of Medina-Sidonia</a>, until 1662, when he removed her to a convent and took power with the help of his favourite, the <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20de%20Vasconcelos%20e%20Sousa%2C%203rd%20Count%20of%20Castelo%20Melhor">Count of Castelo Melhor</a>.

Afonso's reign saw the end of the <a href="Portuguese%20Restoration%20War">Restoration War</a> (1640–68) and Spain's recognition of Portugal's independence. He also negotiated a French alliance through his marriage. However, the king was physically and mentally weak. In 1668, his brother <a href="Peter%20II%20of%20Portugal">Pedro</a> conspired to have him declared incapable of ruling and took power as regent. His French wife, Queen <a href="Maria%20Francisca%20of%20Savoy">Marie Françoise</a>, received an annulment and married Pedro. Afonso spent the rest of his life and reign practically a prisoner.

At the age of three, Afonso suffered an illness that left him paralyzed on the left side of his body, also leaving him mentally unstable. His father created him 10th <a href="Duke%20of%20Braganza">Duke of Braganza</a>.

After the death of his eldest brother <a href="Teod%C3%B3sio%2C%20Prince%20of%20Brazil">Teodósio, Prince of Brazil</a> in 1653, Afonso became the <a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a> to the throne of the kingdom. He received also the crown-princely title 2nd <a href="Prince%20of%20Brazil">Prince of Brazil</a>.

He succeeded his father (<a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20IV">João IV</a>) in 1656 at the age of thirteen. His mother, <a href="Luisa%20of%20Medina-Sidonia">Luisa of Medina-Sidonia</a>, was named regent in his father's will. His mental instability and paralysis, plus his lack of interest in government, left his mother as regent for six years, until 1662. Afonso oversaw decisive military victories over the Spanish at <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Lines%20of%20Elvas">Elvas</a> (14 January 1659), <a href="Battle%20of%20Ameixial">Ameixial</a> (8 June 1663) and <a href="Battle%20of%20Montes%20Claros">Montes Claros</a> (17 June 1665), culminating in the final Spanish recognition of sovereignty of Portugal's new ruling dynasty, the <a href="House%20of%20Braganza">House of Braganza</a>, on 13 February 1668 in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Lisbon%20%281668%29">Treaty of Lisbon</a>.

Colonial affairs saw the <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> conquest of <a href="Jaffna">Jaffna</a>patam, Portugal's last colony in <a href="Portuguese%20Ceylon">Portuguese Ceylon</a> (1658) and the cession of <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a> and <a href="Tangier">Tangier</a> to England (23 June 1661) as dowry for Afonso's sister, <a href="Catherine%20of%20Braganza">Catherine of Braganza</a>, who had married King <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II of England</a>. English mediation in 1661 saw the Netherlands acknowledge Portuguese rule of <a href="Colonial%20Brazil">Brazil</a> in return for uncontested control of <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a>.

In 1662, the <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20de%20Vasconcelos%20e%20Sousa%2C%203rd%20Count%20of%20Castelo%20Melhor">Count of Castelo Melhor</a> saw an opportunity to gain power at court by befriending the king. He managed to convince the king that his mother was out to steal his throne and exile her in Portugal. As a result, Afonso took control of the throne and his mother was sent to a convent.

He married <a href="Marie%20Fran%C3%A7oise%20of%20Nemours">Marie Françoise of Nemours</a>, the daughter of the <a href="Duke%20of%20Savoy">Duke of Savoy</a> in 1666, but the marriage was short-lived. Marie Françoise, or Maria Francisca in Portuguese, filed for an annulment in 1667 based on the impotence of the king. The Church granted her the annulment, and she married Afonso's brother, Pedro, <a href="Duke%20of%20Beja">Duke of Beja</a> (the future <a href="Peter%20II%20of%20Portugal">Peter II</a>).

That same year, Pedro managed to gain enough support to force the king to relinquish control of the government and he became Prince Regent in 1668. Afonso was exiled to the island of <a href="Terceira">Terceira</a> in the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> for seven years, returning to mainland Portugal shortly before he died at <a href="Sintra">Sintra</a> in 1683.

His trial is the basis of <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20M%C3%A1rio%20Grilo">João Mário Grilo</a>'s 1990 film, "The King's Trial" ("O Processo do Rei").

<doc id="1664" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1664" title="Alfonso II of Asturias">
Alfonso II of Asturias

Alfonso II of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Asturias">Asturias</a> (842), nicknamed the Chaste (), was the <a href="king%20of%20Asturias">king of Asturias</a> during two different periods: first in the year 783 and later from 791 until his death in 842. Upon his death, Nepociano, a family member of undetermined relation, attempted to usurp the crown in place of the future Ramiro I.

During his reign, which covered a span of 51 years, Alfonso discovered the supposed tomb of <a href="James%2C%20son%20of%20Zebedee">apostle Santiago</a> in the town of Compostela, which later became known as the city of <a href="Santiago%20de%20Compostela">Santiago de Compostela</a>.

He was the son of <a href="Fruela%20I%20of%20Asturias">Fruela I</a> and the <a href="Basque%20people">Basque</a> Munia.

He was born in <a href="Oviedo">Oviedo</a> in 759 or 760. He was put under the guardianship of his aunt <a href="Adosinda">Adosinda</a> after his father's death, but one tradition relates his being put in the monastery of <a href="Samos">Samos</a>. He was the governor of the palace during the reign of Adosinda's husband <a href="Silo%20of%20Asturias">Silo</a>. On Silo's death, he was elected king by Adosinda's allies, but the magnates raised his uncle <a href="Mauregatus%20of%20Asturias">Mauregatus</a> to the throne instead. Alfonso fled to <a href="%C3%81lava">Álava</a> where he found shelter with his maternal relatives. Mauregatus was succeeded by <a href="Bermudo%20I%20of%20Asturias">Bermudo</a>, Alfonso's cousin, who abdicated after his defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Burbia%20River">Battle of the Burbia River</a>.

Alfonso was subsequently elected king on September 14, 791. Poets of a later generation invented the story of the secret marriage between his sister Ximena and Sancho, count of Saldana, and the feats of their son <a href="Bernardo%20del%20Carpio">Bernardo del Carpio</a>. Bernardo is the hero of a "<a href="cantar%20de%20gesta">cantar de gesta</a>" ("chanson de geste") written to please the anarchical spirit of the nobles.

On accession to the throne, <a href="Hisham%20I%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Hisham I</a>, son of <a href="Abd%20al-Rahman%20I">Abd al-Rahman I</a>, commenced a string of military campaigns in the eastern Pyrenees and to the north-west. In 794, a raid spearheaded by Abd al-Karim dealt a major military blow to Alfonso II on the eastern fringes of the Kingdom of Asturias (Cantabria and Castile). The Asturian king asked for the assistance of the <a href="Basque%20people">Basque</a> Frankish vassal Belasco, master of <a href="%C3%81lava">Álava</a> and bordering regions at the time. Abd al-Karim advanced deeper west into Asturias and pillaged the region, while his brother Abd al-Malik ventured into the western Asturian lands.

Confronted with heavy fire, Alfonso II reached out to <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>'s Franks. He sent delegations to <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a> and <a href="Aix-la-Chapelle">Aix-la-Chapelle</a> in 796, 797, and 798. These diplomacy efforts may have aimed to strengthen his legitimacy and the government structures of Asturias against ongoing internal unrest——troubles in Galicia——and external attacks of the Ibn Mugait brothers, i.e. generals Abd al-Karim and Abd al-Malik.

Alfonso was acknowledged as a king by Charlemagne and the Pope, and Asturias as a kingdom for the first time. The king showed an interest in the Frankish cult of Saint <a href="Martin%20of%20Tours">Martin of Tours</a>, and most notably he encouraged Carolingian Church influence into Asturias. Unsurprisingly, during Alfonso's reign, the alleged resting-place of St. James was revealed. Alfonso's envoys to Charlemagne's courts may have also dealt with the <a href="adoptionist">adoptionist</a> controversy, which had brought Bermudo's kingdom into Charlemagne's view. It seems that Carolingian support did much to spur his military raid into Andalusian territory up to <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>. The Andalusian city in turn was captured and sacked by his troops in 798.

In 825 he defeated Cordovan forces at <a href="Nar%C3%B3n">Narón</a> and <a href="Anceo">Anceo</a> (825) and, thanks to these victories, the "repopulation" of parts of <a href="Gallaecia">Galicia</a>, <a href="Le%C3%B3n%20%28province%29">León</a>, and <a href="Castile%20%28historical%20region%29">Castile</a> was started—charter granting that confirmed the possession of the territories.

Alfonso also moved the capital from <a href="Pravia">Pravia</a>, where Silo had located it, to <a href="Oviedo">Oviedo</a>, the city of his father's founding and his birth. There he constructed churches and a palace. He built <a href="San%20Tirso">San Tirso</a>, where he is buried, and <a href="Santullano">Santullano</a>, on the outskirts. The "Crónica Sebastianense" records his death in 842, saying:

Tradition relates that in 814, the body of <a href="Saint%20James%20the%20Greater">Saint James the Greater</a> was discovered in <a href="Santiago%20de%20Compostela">Compostela</a> and that Alfonso was the first pilgrim to that famous medieval (and modern) shrine.

Amara Sinha

Amara Sinha (or Amara Simha, IAST: Amarasiṃha) (c. CE 375) was a <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> <a href="grammar">grammar</a>ian and <a href="poet">poet</a>, of whose personal history hardly anything is known. He is said to have been "one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of <a href="Vikramaditya">Vikramaditya</a>," and according to the evidence of <a href="Xuanzang">Xuanzang</a>, this is the <a href="Chandragupta%20Vikramaditya">Chandragupta Vikramaditya</a> (<a href="Chandragupta%20II">Chandragupta II</a>) who flourished about CE 375. Other sources describe him as belonging to the period of <a href="Vikramaditya">Vikramaditya</a> of 7th century. Most of Amarasiṃha's work was destroyed, with the exception of the celebrated "<a href="Amara-Kosha">Amara-Kosha</a>" (IAST: "Amarakośa") ("Treasury of Amara"). The first reliable mention of the "Amarakosha" is in the Amoghavritti of Shakatayana composed during the reign of <a href="Amoghavarsha">Amoghavarsha</a> (814-867CE)

The "Amarakosha" is a vocabulary of Sanskrit roots, in three books, and hence sometimes called "Trikanda" or the "Tripartite". It is also known as "Namalinganushasana". The "Amarakosha" contains 10,000 words, and is arranged, like other works of its class, in metre, to aid the memory.

The first chapter of the "Kosha" was printed at <a href="Rome">Rome</a> in Tamil character in 1798. An edition of the entire work, with English notes and an index by <a href="Henry%20Thomas%20Colebrooke">HT Colebrooke</a> appeared at <a href="Serampore">Serampore</a> in 1808. The Sanskrit text was printed at <a href="Calcutta">Calcutta</a> in 1831.

Alfonso XII (Alfonso Francisco de Asís Fernando Pío Juan María de la Concepción Gregorio Pelayo; 28 November 185725 November 1885) was <a href="List%20of%20Spanish%20monarchs">King of Spain</a>, reigning from 1874 to 1885, after a "coup d'état" restored the monarchy and ended the ephemeral <a href="First%20Spanish%20Republic">First Spanish Republic</a>.

Having been forced into exile after the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution%20%28Spain%29">Glorious Revolution</a> deposed his mother <a href="Isabella%20II%20of%20Spain">Isabella II</a> from the throne in 1868, Alfonso studied in <a href="Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="France">France</a>. His mother abdicated in his favour in 1870, and he returned to Spain as king in 1874 following a military coup. Alfonso died aged 27 in 1885, and was succeeded by his unborn son, who became <a href="Alfonso%20XIII%20of%20Spain">Alfonso XIII</a> on his birth the following year.

Alfonso was born in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> as the eldest son of <a href="Isabella%20II%20of%20Spain">Queen Isabella II</a>. Officially, his father was her husband, <a href="Francis%2C%20Duke%20of%20C%C3%A1diz">Infante Francis</a>. Alfonso's biological paternity is uncertain: there is speculation that his biological father may have been Enrique Puigmoltó y Mayans (a captain of the guard). These rumours were used as political propaganda against Alfonso by the <a href="Carlism">Carlists</a>.

His mother's accession created the second cause of instability, which was the Carlist Wars. The supporters of the <a href="Infante%20Carlos%2C%20Count%20of%20Molina">Count of Molina</a> as king of Spain rose to have him enthroned. In addition, within the context of the post-Napoleonic restorations and revolutions which engulfed the West both in Europe and the Americas, both the Carlistas as well as the Isabelino conservatives were opposed to the new Napoleonic constitutional system. Much like in Britain, which subtracted itself from the liberal constitutional process, Spanish conservatives wanted to continue with the Traditional Spanish Organic Laws such as the <a href="Fuero%20Juzgo">Fuero Juzgo</a>, the Novísima Recopilación and the <a href="Siete%20Partidas">Partidas of Alfonso X</a>. This led to the third cause of instability of note, the "Independence of the American Kingdoms", recognized between 1823 and 1850.

When Queen Isabella and her husband were forced to leave Spain by the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution%20%28Spain%29">Revolution of 1868</a>, Alfonso accompanied them to Paris. From there, he was sent to the <a href="Theresianum">Theresianum</a> at <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> to continue his studies. On 25 June 1870, he was recalled to Paris, where his mother abdicated in his favour, in the presence of a number of Spanish nobles who had tied their fortunes to that of the exiled queen. He assumed the name Alfonso XII, for although no King of united Spain had borne the name "Alfonso XI", the Spanish monarchy was regarded as continuous with the more ancient monarchy represented by the 11 kings of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Asturias">Asturias</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">León</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castile</a> also named <a href="Alfonso">Alfonso</a>.

After Amadeo's abandonment in 1873, Parliament declared the Federal Republic (including Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Pacific Archipelagos), the first act of President Estanislao Figueras was to extend the Abolition Act to Puerto Rico. Cuban slaves would have to wait until 1889.

But the republicans were not in agreement either, and they had to contend with the War in Cuba, and Muslim uprisings in Spanish Morocco. In the midst of the crisis during and after the First Spanish Republic, the <a href="Carlism">Carlist</a> party made itself strong in areas with claims over their national and institutional specificity, such as Catalonia or the Basque districts. By 1872, the <a href="Third%20Carlist%20War">Third Carlist War</a> erupted. This unrest led to the creation of a group in favor of the Bourbon restoration, made by some sectors of the conservatives led by Canovas del Castillo.

The Prince of Asturias, Alfonso, was the person chosen to develop the new road map proposed by Canovas, which led to the June 1870 abdication of Queen Isabel II in favour of her son Prince Alfonso. The new road map, which indeed ended the eternal crisis begun in 1810 was called 'Alfonsismo', and the moderate centrist Cánovas del Castillo became the spokesman. As having Alfonso in Spain would be a problem, Cánovas became responsible for his education. He sent Alfonso to the <a href="Sandhurst%20Military%20Academy">Sandhurst Military Academy</a> in England, where the training Alfonso received was severe but more cosmopolitan than in Spain, given the current atmosphere.

On 1 December 1874, Alfonso issued the Sandhurst Manifesto, where he set the ideological basis of the Bourbon Restoration. It was drafted in reply to a birthday greeting from his followers, a manifesto proclaiming himself the sole representative of the Spanish monarchy. At the end of 1874, Brigadier <a href="Arsenio%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20Campos">Martínez Campos</a>, who had long been working more or less openly for the king, led some battalions of the central army to <a href="Sagunto">Sagunto</a>, rallied to his own flag the troops sent against him, and entered <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a> in the king's name. Thereupon the President resigned, and his power was transferred to the king's plenipotentiary and adviser, <a href="Antonio%20C%C3%A1novas%20del%20Castillo">Antonio Cánovas</a>. The 29 December 1874 military coup of Gen. Martinez Campos in Sagunto ended the failed republic and meant the rise of the young Prince Alfonso.

Within a few days after Canovas del Castillo took power as Premier, the new king, proclaimed on 29 December 1874, arrived at Madrid, passing through <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a> and was acclaimed everywhere (1875). In 1876, a vigorous campaign against the <a href="Carlists">Carlists</a>, in which the young king took part, resulted in the defeat of <a href="Carlos%2C%20Duke%20of%20Madrid">Don Carlos</a> and the Duke's abandonment of the struggle.

Initially led by Canovas del Castillo as moderate prime minister, what was thought at one time as a coup aimed at placing the military in the political-administrative positions of power, in reality ushered in a civilian regime that lasted until <a href="Miguel%20Primo%20de%20Rivera">Primo de Rivera</a>'s 1923 <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>. Cánovas was the real architect of the new regime of the Restoration.

In order to eliminate one of the problems of the reign of Isabel II, the single party and its destabilizing consequences, the Liberal Party was allowed to incorporate and participate in national politics, and the 'turnismo' or alternation was to become the new system. Turnismo would be endorsed in the Constitution of 1876 and the Pact of Pardo Palace (1885). It meant that liberal and conservative prime ministers would succeed each other ending thus the troubles.

This led to the end of the Carlist revolts and the victory over the New York-backed Cuban revolutionaries, and led to a huge backing both by insular and peninsular Spaniards of Alfonso as a wise and able king.

Alfonso's short reign established the foundations for the final socioeconomic recuperation of Spain after the 1808–1874 crisis. Both European (the coastal regions, such as the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Asturias) and Overseas – Antilles and Pacific were able to grow steadily. Cuba and Puerto Rico prospered to the point that Spain's first train was between Havana and Camaguey, and the world's first telegraph was in Puerto Rico, as Samuel Morse lived there with his daughter, married to a Puerto Rican businessman. Upon the American invasion of Puerto Rico, ten US dollars were needed to buy one Puerto Rican peso.

On 23 January 1878 at the Basilica of <a href="Basilica%20of%20Nuestra%20Se%C3%B1ora%20de%20Atocha">Atocha</a> in Madrid, Alfonso married his first cousin, Princess <a href="Mercedes%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Maria de las Mercedes</a>, daughter of <a href="Antoine%2C%20Duke%20of%20Montpensier">Antoine, Duke of Montpensier</a>, but she died within six months of the marriage.

On 29 November 1879 at the Basilica of Atocha in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, Alfonso married a much more distant relative, <a href="Maria%20Christina%20of%20Austria">Maria Christina of Austria</a>, daughter of <a href="Karl%20Ferdinand%2C%20Archduke%20of%20Austria">Archduke Karl Ferdinand</a> and <a href="Archduchess%20Elisabeth%20Franziska%20of%20Austria">Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria</a>. During the honeymoon, a pastry cook named Otero fired at the young sovereign and his wife as they were driving in Madrid.

The children of this marriage were:

Alfonso had two sons by Elena Armanda Nicolasa Sanz y Martínez de Arizala (<a href="Castell%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20Plana">Castellón de la Plana</a>, 15 December 1849Paris, 24 December 1898):

In 1881 Alfonso refused to sanction a law by which the ministers were to remain in office for a fixed term of 18 months. Upon the consequent resignation of Canovas del Castillo, he summoned <a href="Pr%C3%A1xedes%20Mateo%20Sagasta">Práxedes Mateo Sagasta</a>, the Liberal leader, to form a new cabinet.

In November 1885, Alfonso died, just short of his 28th birthday, at the <a href="Royal%20Palace%20of%20El%20Pardo">Royal Palace of El Pardo</a>. He had been suffering from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, but the immediate cause of his death was a recurrence of <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>.

In 1902, his widow Maria Cristina initiated a national contest to build a monument in memory of Alfonso. The winning design, by <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Grases%20Riera">José Grases Riera</a>, was erected in an artificial lake in Madrid's <a href="Parque%20del%20Buen%20Retiro">Parque del Buen Retiro</a> in 1922.

Coming to the throne at such an early age Alfonso had served no apprenticeship in the art of ruling. Benevolent and sympathetic in disposition, he won the affection of his people by fearlessly visiting districts ravaged by <a href="cholera">cholera</a> or devastated by earthquake in 1885. His capacity for dealing with men was considerable, and he never allowed himself to become the instrument of any particular party. During his short reign, peace was established both at home and abroad, finances were well regulated, and the various administrative services were placed on a basis that afterwards enabled Spain to pass through the disastrous <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">war with the United States</a> without the threat of a revolution.

Alfonso XIII of Spain

Alfonso XIII (<a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>: "Alfonso León Fernando María Jaime Isidro Pascual Antonio de Borbón y Habsburgo-Lorena"; 17 May 1886 – 28 February 1941) was <a href="King%20of%20Spain">King of Spain</a> from 1886 until the proclamation of the <a href="Second%20Republic%20of%20Spain">Second Republic</a> in 1931. Alfonso was monarch from birth as his father, <a href="Alfonso%20XII">Alfonso XII</a>, had died the previous year. Alfonso's mother, <a href="Maria%20Christina%20of%20Austria">Maria Christina of Austria</a>, served as regent until he assumed full powers on his sixteenth birthday in 1902.

During Alfonso's reign Spain experienced four major problems that contributed to the end of the liberal monarchy: the lack of real political representation of broad social groups, the poor situation of the popular classes, especially peasants, problems arising from the <a href="Rif%20War">Rif War</a> and <a href="Catalan%20nationalism">Catalan nationalism</a>. This political and social turbulence that began with the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> prevented the turnaround parties from establishing a true liberal democracy, which led to the establishment of the dictatorship of <a href="Miguel%20Primo%20de%20Rivera">Primo de Rivera</a>. With the political failure of the dictatorship, Alfonso impelled a return to the democratic normality with the intention of regenerating the regime. Nevertheless, it was abandoned by all political classes, as they felt betrayed by the king's support of the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera.

He left Spain voluntarily after the municipal elections of April 1931, that was taken as a plebiscite between monarchy or republic. In exile, he retained his claim to the defunct throne until 1941, when he renounced his claim in favour of his third son <a href="Juan%20de%20Borbon">Juan</a> (whose eldest son, <a href="Juan%20Carlos">Juan Carlos</a>, did eventually become king when the monarchy was restored) and died six weeks later. Buried in Rome, his remains were not transferred until 1980 to the Pantheon of the Kings in the monastery of <a href="El%20Escorial">El Escorial</a>.

Alfonso was born in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> on 17 May 1886. He was the posthumous son of <a href="Alfonso%20XII%20of%20Spain">Alfonso XII of Spain</a>, who had died in November 1885, and became King of Spain upon his birth. Just after he was born, he was carried naked to the Spanish prime minister on a silver tray. Five days later he was carried in a solemn court procession with a golden fleece round his neck and was baptized with water specially brought from the River Jordan in Palestine. The French newspaper "<a href="Le%20Figaro">Le Figaro</a>" described the young king in 1889 as "the happiest and best-loved of all the rulers of the earth". His mother, <a href="Maria%20Christina%20of%20Austria">Maria Christina of Austria</a>, served as his regent until his 16th birthday. During the regency, in 1898, Spain lost its colonial rule over <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, <a href="Guam">Guam</a> and the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> to the United States as a result of the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>.

When he came of age in May 1902, the week of his majority was marked by festivities, bullfights, balls and receptions throughout Spain. He took his oath to the constitution before members of the Cortes on 17 May.

By 1905, Alfonso was looking for a suitable consort. On a state visit to the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a>, he stayed at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> with King <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>. There he met Princess <a href="Victoria%20Eugenie%20of%20Battenberg">Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg</a>, the <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a>-born daughter of Edward's youngest sister <a href="Princess%20Beatrice%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Princess Beatrice</a>, and a granddaughter of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. He found her attractive, and she returned his interest. There were obstacles to the marriage. Victoria was a <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a>, and would have to become a Catholic. Victoria's brother Leopold was a <a href="haemophilia">haemophilia</a>c, so there was a 50 percent chance that Victoria was a carrier of the trait. Finally, Alfonso's mother Maria Christina wanted him to marry a member of her family, the <a href="House%20of%20Habsburg-Lorraine">House of Habsburg-Lorraine</a> or some other Catholic princess, as she considered the Battenbergs to be non-dynastic.

Victoria was willing to change her religion, and her being a haemophilia carrier was only a possibility. Maria Christina was eventually persuaded to drop her opposition. In January 1906 she wrote an official letter to Princess Beatrice proposing the match. Victoria met Maria Christina and Alfonso in <a href="Biarritz">Biarritz</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, later that month, and converted to Catholicism in <a href="San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n">San Sebastián</a> in March.
In May, diplomats of both kingdoms officially executed the agreement of marriage. Alfonso and Victoria were married at the <a href="San%20Jer%C3%B3nimo%20el%20Real">Royal Monastery of San Jerónimo</a> in Madrid on 31 May 1906, with British royalty in attendance, including Victoria's cousins the Prince and Princess of Wales (later <a href="King%20George%20V">King George V</a> and <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a>). The wedding was marred by an assassination attempt on Alfonso and Victoria by Catalan <a href="anarchist">anarchist</a> <a href="Mateu%20Morral">Mateu Morral</a>. As the wedding procession returned to the palace, he threw a bomb from a window which killed or injured several bystanders and members of the procession.

On 10 May 1907, the couple's first child, <a href="Alfonso%2C%20Prince%20of%20Asturias%20%281907%E2%80%931938%29">Alfonso, Prince of Asturias</a>, was born. However, Victoria was in fact a haemophilia carrier, and Alfonso inherited the condition.

Neither of the two daughters born to the King and Queen were haemophilia carriers, but another of their sons, <a href="Gonzalo%20of%20Spain">Gonzalo</a> (1914–1934), had the condition. Alfonso distanced himself from his Queen for transmitting the condition to their sons.

From 1914 on, he had several mistresses, and fathered five illegitimate children. A sixth illegitimate child was born before his marriage.

During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, because of his family connections with both sides and the division of popular opinion, Spain remained neutral. The King established an office for assistance to prisoners of war on all sides. This office used the Spanish diplomatic and military network abroad to intercede for thousands of POWs – transmitting and receiving letters for them, and other services. The office was located in the <a href="Palacio%20Real">Royal Palace</a>.

Alfonso became gravely ill during the <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">1918 flu pandemic</a>. Spain was neutral and thus under no wartime censorship restrictions, so his illness and subsequent recovery were reported to the world, while flu outbreaks in the belligerent countries were concealed. This gave the misleading impression that Spain was the most-affected area and led to the pandemic being dubbed "the Spanish Flu."

Following World War I, Spain entered the lengthy yet victorious <a href="Rif%20War">Rif War</a> (1920–1926) to preserve its colonial rule over northern Morocco. Critics of the monarchy thought the war was an unforgivable loss of money and lives, and nicknamed Alfonso "el Africano" ("the African"). Alfonso had not acted as a strict constitutional monarch, and supported the "africanistas" who wanted to conquer for Spain a new empire in Africa to compensate for the lost empire in the Americas and Asia. The Rif War had starkly polarized Spanish society between the "africanistas" who wanted to conquer an empire in Africa vs. the "abandonistas" who wanted to abandon Morocco as not worth the blood and treasure. Alfonso liked to play favourites with his generals, and one of his most favored generals was <a href="Manuel%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20Silvestre">Manuel Fernández Silvestre</a>. In 1921, when Silvestre advanced up into the Rif mountains of Morocco, Alfonso sent him a telegram whose first line read "Hurrah for real men!", urging Silvestre not to retreat at a time when Silvestre was experiencing major difficulties. Silvestre stayed the course, leading his men into the <a href="Battle%20of%20Annual">Battle of Annual</a>, one of Spain's worst defeats. Alfonso, who was on holiday in the south of France at the time, was informed of the "Disaster of the Annual" while he was playing golf. Reportedly, Alfonso's response to the news was to shrug his shoulders and say "Chicken meat is cheap", before resuming his game of golf. Alfonso remained in France and did not return to Spain to comfort the families of the soldiers lost at the "Disaster of the Annual", which many people at the time saw as a callous and cold act, a sign that the King couldn't care less about the lives of his soldiers. In 1922, the "Cortes" started an investigation into the responsibility for the Annual disaster and soon discovered evidence that the King had been one of the main supporters of Silvestre's advance into the Rif mountains.

After the "Disaster of the Annual", Spain's war in the Rif went from bad to worse, and as the Spanish were barely hanging onto Morocco, support for the "abandonistas" grew as many people could see no point to the war. In August 1923, Spanish soldiers embarking for Morocco mutinied, other soldiers in Malaga simply refused to board the ships that were to take them to Morocco, while in Barcelona huge crowds of left-wingers had staged anti-war protests at which Spanish flags were burned while the flag of the Rif Republic was waved about. With the "africanistas" comprising only a minority, it was clear that it was only a matter of time before the "abandonistas" forced the Spanish to give up on the Rif, which was part of the reason for the military coup d'état later in 1923. On September 13, 1923, <a href="General">General</a> <a href="Miguel%20Primo%20de%20Rivera%2C%202nd%20Marquis%20of%20Estella">Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marqués de Estella</a>, seized power in a military coup. He ruled as a dictator with Alfonso's support until 1930. It is believed that one of Alfonso's main reasons for supporting the coup was his desire to suppress the publication of the damning "Cortes" report into the Annual disaster. The poetic <a href="Generation%20of%20%2727">Generation of '27</a> and Catalan and Basque nationalism grew in this era

In January 1930, due to economic problems and general unpopularity, the 2nd <a href="Miguel%20Primo%20de%20Rivera%2C%202nd%20Marquis%20of%20Estella">Marqués de Estella</a> resigned as Prime Minister. Alfonso, as the <a href="Marquis">Marqués</a>'s ally, shared the popular dislike. The King had so closely associated with the Primo de Rivera dictatorship that it was difficult for him to distance himself from the regime he had supported for almost 7 years. In April 1931, <a href="General">General</a> <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Sanjurjo">Le Marqués del Rif</a> told him even the army was not loyal. On 12 April, the republican parties won a landslide victory in municipal elections. The municipal elections were fought as a virtual referendum on the future of the monarchy. On 14 April, he fled the country as the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a> was proclaimed, but did not formally abdicate. He settled eventually in Rome.

By a law of 26 November 1931, Alfonso was accused by the Cortes of high treason. This law would later be repealed by a new law dated 15 December 1938, signed by <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a>.

In 1933, his two eldest sons, Alfonso and Jaime, renounced their claims to the throne, and in 1934 his youngest son Gonzalo died. This left his third son <a href="Juan%2C%20Count%20of%20Barcelona">Juan, Count of Barcelona</a> his only heir. Juan later was the father of <a href="Juan%20Carlos%20I%20of%20Spain">Juan Carlos I</a>.

When the Army rose up against the democratically elected Republican Government, war broke out, Alfonso made it clear he favoured the "Nationalist" military rebels against the Republic. But in September 1936 the Nationalist leader, General <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a>, declared that the Nationalists would not restore Alfonso as king. (The Nationalist army included many <a href="Carlism">Carlist</a> supporters of a rival pretender.)

Nevertheless, he sent his son Juan to Spain in 1936, to participate in the uprising. However, General <a href="Emilio%20Mola">Mola</a> had Juan arrested near the French border and expelled from the country.

On 29 September 1936, upon the death of <a href="Infante%20Alfonso%20Carlos%2C%20Duke%20of%20San%20Jaime">Infante Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime</a> (the Carlist pretender), Alfonso also became the senior heir of <a href="Hugh%20Capet">Hugh Capet</a> and so was hailed by some French <a href="legitimists">legitimists</a> as King Alphonse I of France and Navarre.

On 15 January 1941, Alfonso XIII abdicated his rights to the defunct Spanish throne in favour of Juan. He died in Rome on 28 February of that year.

In Spain, the dictator Franco ordered three days of national mourning. His funeral was held in Rome in the Church of <a href="Santa%20Maria%20degli%20Angeli%20e%20dei%20Martiri">Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri</a>. Alfonso was buried in the Church of <a href="Santa%20Maria%20in%20Monserrato%20degli%20Spagnoli">Santa Maria in Monserrato degli Spagnoli</a>, the Spanish national church in Rome, immediately below the tombs of <a href="Pope%20Callixtus%20III">Pope Callixtus III</a> and <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20VI">Pope Alexander VI</a>. In January 1980 his remains were transferred to <a href="El%20Escorial">El Escorial</a> in Spain.

Alfonso was a promoter of tourism in Spain. The need for the lodging of his wedding guests prompted the construction of the luxury <a href="Hotel%20Palace">Hotel Palace</a> in Madrid. He also supported the creation of a network of state-run lodges (<a href="Parador">Parador</a>) in historic buildings of Spain. His fondness for the sport of <a href="Association%20football">football</a> led to the patronage of several "Royal" ("Real" in Spanish) football clubs, the first being <a href="Real%20Club%20Deportivo%20de%20La%20Coru%C3%B1a">Real Club Deportivo de La Coruña</a> in 1907. Selected others include <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>, <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a>, <a href="Real%20Uni%C3%B3n">Real Unión</a>, <a href="RCD%20Espanyol">Espanyol</a> and <a href="Real%20Zaragoza">Real Zaragoza</a>.

An avenue in the northern Madrid neighbourhood of Chamartín, Avenida de Alfonso XIII, is named after him. A plaza or town center in <a href="Iloilo%20City">Iloilo City</a>, <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> (now Plaza Libertad) was named in his honour called Plaza Alfonso XIII. A street in <a href="Merthyr%20Tydfil">Merthyr Tydfil</a>, in <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, was built especially to house Spanish immigrants in the mining industry and named Alphonso Street after Alfonso XIII.

Alfonso XIII appears as "King Buby" in <a href="Luis%20Coloma">Luis Coloma</a>'s story of <a href="Ratoncito%20P%C3%A9rez">Ratoncito Pérez</a> (1894), which was written for the King when he was 8 years old. The story of Ratoncito Pérez has been adapted into further literary works and movies since then, with the character of Alfonso XIII appearing in some. Alfonso XIII is also mentioned on the plaque to Ratoncito Pérez on the second floor of "<a href="la%20calle%20del%20Arenal">la calle del Arenal</a>".

On 31 May 1906, Alfonso married <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a>-born <a href="Victoria%20Eugenie%20of%20Battenberg">Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg</a> (1887–1969).

Alfonso the Battler

Alfonso I (1073/10747 September 1134), called the Battler or the Warrior (), was the <a href="Kings%20of%20Aragon">king of Aragon</a> and <a href="Kings%20of%20Navarre">Pamplona</a> from 1104 until his death in 1134. He was the second son of King <a href="Sancho%20I%20of%20Aragon">Sancho Ramírez</a> and successor of his brother <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Aragon">Peter I</a>. With his marriage to <a href="Urraca%20of%20Castile">Urraca</a>, queen regnant of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castile</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">León</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Galicia">Galicia</a>, in 1109, he began to use, with some justification, the grandiose title <a href="Imperator%20totius%20Hispaniae">Emperor of Spain</a>, formerly employed by his father-in-law, <a href="Alfonso%20VI%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Alfonso VI</a>. Alfonso the Battler earned his sobriquet in the <a href="Reconquista">Reconquista</a>. He won his greatest military successes in the middle <a href="Ebro">Ebro</a>, where he conquered <a href="Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a> in 1118 and took <a href="Ejea%20de%20los%20Caballeros">Ejea</a>, <a href="Tudela%2C%20Navarre">Tudela</a>, <a href="Calatayud">Calatayud</a>, <a href="Borja%2C%20Zaragoza">Borja</a>, <a href="Tarazona">Tarazona</a>, <a href="Daroca">Daroca</a>, and <a href="Monreal%20del%20Campo">Monreal del Campo</a>. He died in September 1134 after an unsuccessful battle with the <a href="Muslims">Muslims</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fraga">Battle of Fraga</a>.

His earliest years were passed in the <a href="Abbey%20of%20San%20Pedro%20de%20Siresa">monastery of Siresa</a>, learning to read and write and to practice the military arts under the tutelage of Lope Garcés the Pilgrim, who was repaid for his services by his former charge with the county of <a href="Pedrola">Pedrola</a> when Alfonso came to the throne.

During his brother's reign, he participated in the taking of Huesca (the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alcoraz">Battle of Alcoraz</a>, 1096), which became the largest city in the kingdom and the new capital. He also joined <a href="El%20Cid">El Cid</a>'s expeditions in <a href="Valencia%20%28taifa%29">Valencia</a>. His father gave him the lordships of <a href="Biel%2C%20Zaragoza">Biel</a>, <a href="Luna%2C%20Zaragoza">Luna</a>, <a href="Ardenes">Ardenes</a>, and <a href="Bailo%2C%20Spain">Bailo</a>.

A series of deaths put Alfonso directly in line for the throne. His brother's children, Isabella and Peter (who married María Rodríguez, daughter of <a href="El%20Cid">El Cid</a>), died in 1103 and 1104 respectively.

A passionate fighting-man (he fought twenty-nine battles against Christian or Moor), he was married (when well over 30 years and a habitual bachelor) in 1109 to the ambitious Queen <a href="Urraca%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Urraca of León</a>, widow of <a href="Raymond%20of%20Burgundy">Raymond of Burgundy</a>, a passionate woman unsuited for a subordinate role. The marriage had been arranged by her father <a href="Alfonso%20VI%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Alfonso VI of León</a> in 1106 to unite the two chief Christian states against the <a href="Almoravides">Almoravids</a>, and to supply them with a capable military leader. But Urraca was tenacious of her right as <a href="queen%20regnant">queen regnant</a> and had not learnt chastity in the polygamous household of her father. Husband and wife quarrelled with the brutality of the age and came to open war, even placing Urraca under siege at Astorga in 1112. Alfonso had the support of one section of the nobles who found their account in the confusion. Being a much better soldier than any of his opponents he won the <a href="Battle%20of%20Candespina">Battle of Candespina</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Viadangos">Battle of Viadangos</a>, but his only trustworthy supporters were his Aragonese, who were not numerous enough to keep <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castile</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">León</a> subjugated. The marriage of Alfonso and Urraca was declared null by the Pope, as they were second cousins, in 1110, but he ignored the papal nuncio and clung to his liaison with Urraca until 1114. During his marriage, he had called himself "King and Emperor of Castile, Toledo, Aragón, Pamplona, Sobrarbe, and Ribagorza" in recognition of his rights as Urraca's husband; of his inheritance of the lands of his father, including the kingdom of his great-uncle <a href="Gonzalo%20of%20Sobrarbe%20and%20Ribagorza">Gonzalo</a>; and his prerogative to conquer <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a> from the Muslims. He inserted the title of "imperator" on the basis that he had three kingdoms under his rule.

Alfonso's late marriage and his failure to remarry and produce the essential legitimate heir that should have been a dynastic linchpin of his aggressive territorial policies have been adduced as a lack of interest in women. Ibn al-Athir (1166–1234) describes Alfonso as a tireless soldier who would sleep in his armor without benefit of cover, whom when asked why he did not take his pleasure from one of the captives of Muslim chiefs, responded that the man devoted to war needs the companionship of men not women.

The king quarrelled with the church, and particularly the <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a>s, almost as violently as with his wife. As he defeated her, so he drove <a href="Bernard%20de%20Sedirac">Archbishop Bernard</a> into exile and expelled the monks of <a href="Sahag%C3%BAn%2C%20Spain">Sahagún</a>. He was finally compelled to give way in Castile and León to his stepson, <a href="Alfonso%20VII%20of%20Castile">Alfonso VII of Castile</a>, son of Urraca and her first husband. The intervention of <a href="Pope%20Calixtus%20II">Pope Calixtus II</a> brought about an arrangement between the old man and his young namesake.

In 1122 in Belchite, he founded <a href="Confraternity%20of%20Belchite">a confraternity of knights</a> to fight against the Almoravids. It was the start of the military orders in Aragon. Years later, he organised a branch of the "Militia Christi" of the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a> at <a href="Monreal%20del%20Campo">Monreal del Campo</a>.

Alfonso spent his first four years as king in near-constant war with the Muslims. In 1105, he conquered Ejea and Tauste and refortified Castellar and Juslibol. In 1106, he defeated <a href="Ahmad%20II%20al-Musta%27in">Ahmad II al-Musta'in</a> of Zaragoza at Valtierra. In 1107, he took Tamarite de Litera and Esteban de la Litera. Then followed a period dominated by his relations with Castile and León through his wife, Urraca. He resumed his conquest in 1117 by conquering <a href="Fitero">Fitero</a>, <a href="Corella%2C%20Spain">Corella</a>, <a href="Cintru%C3%A9nigo">Cintruénigo</a>, <a href="Murchante">Murchante</a>, <a href="Monteagudo%2C%20Navarre">Monteagudo</a>, and <a href="Cascante">Cascante</a>.

In 1118, the Council of Toulouse declared a <a href="crusade">crusade</a> to assist in the conquest of <a href="Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a>. Many Frenchmen consequently joined Alfonso at <a href="Ayerbe">Ayerbe</a>. They took Almudévar, Gurrea de Gállego, and Zuera, besieging Zaragoza itself by the end of May. The city fell on 18 December, and the forces of Alfonso occupied the Azuda, the government tower. The great palace of the city was given to the monks of Bernard. Promptly, the city was made Alfonso's capital. Two years later, in 1120, he defeated a Muslim army intent on reconquering his new capital at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cutanda">Battle of Cutanda</a>. He promulgated the "fuero" of "tortum per tortum", facilitating taking the law into one's own hands, which among others reassumed the Muslim right to dwell in the city and their right to keep their properties and practice their religion under their own jurisdiction as long as they maintained tax payment and relocated to the suburbs.
In 1119, he retook Cervera, Tudejen, Castellón, Tarazona, Ágreda, Magallón, Borja, Alagón, Novillas, Mallén, Rueda, Épila and populated the region of <a href="Soria">Soria</a>. He began the siege of <a href="Calatayud">Calatayud</a>, but left to defeat the army at Cutanda trying to retake Zaragoza. When Calatayud fell, he took Bubierca, Alhama de Aragón, Ariza, and Daroca (1120). In 1123, he besieged and took <a href="Lleida">Lleida</a>, which was in the hands of the <a href="count%20of%20Barcelona">count of Barcelona</a>. From the winter of 1124 to September 1125, he was on a risky expedition to Peña Cadiella deep in Andalusia.

In the great raid of 1125, he carried away a large part of the subject Christians from Granada, and in the south-west of France, he had claims as usurper-king of Navarre. From 1125 to 1126, he was on campaign against <a href="Granada">Granada</a>, where he was trying to install a Christian prince, and <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%20%28Spain%29">Córdoba</a>, where got only as far as Motril. In 1127, he reconquered Longares, but simultaneously lost all his Castilian possessions to <a href="alfonso%20VII%20of%20Castile">Alfonso VII</a>. He confirmed a treaty with Castile the next year (1128) with the <a href="Peace%20of%20T%C3%A1mara">Peace of Támara</a>, which fixed the boundaries of the two realms.

He conquered Molina de Aragón and populated <a href="Monz%C3%B3n">Monzón</a> in 1129, before besieging <a href="Valencia%20%28city%20in%20Spain%29">Valencia</a>, which had fallen again upon the Cid's death.

He went north of the Pyrenees in October 1130 to protect the <a href="Val%20d%27Aran">Val d'Aran</a>. Early in 1131, he besieged <a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a>. It is said he ruled "from Belorado to Pallars and from Bayonne to Monreal."

At the <a href="Siege%20of%20Bayonne">Siege of Bayonne</a> in October 1131, three years before his death, he published a will leaving his kingdom to three autonomous religious orders based in Palestine and politically largely independent - the <a href="Knights%20Templars">Knights Templars</a>, the <a href="Hospitallers">Hospitallers</a>, and the Knights of the <a href="Holy%20Sepulchre">Holy Sepulchre</a>, whose influences might have been expected to cancel one another out. The will has greatly puzzled historians, who have read it as a bizarre gesture of extreme piety uncharacteristic of Alfonso's character, one that effectively undid his life's work. Elena Lourie (1975) suggested instead that it was Alfonso's attempt to neutralize the papacy's interest in a disputed succession — Aragon had been a fief of the Papacy since 1068 — and to fend off Urraca's son from her first marriage, Alfonso VII of Castile, for the Papacy would be bound to press the terms of such a pious testament. Generous bequests to important churches and abbeys in Castile had the effect of making the noble churchmen there beneficiaries who would be encouraged by the will to act as a brake on Alfonso VII's ambitions to break it — and yet among the magnates witnessing the will in 1131 there is not a single cleric. In the event it was a will that his nobles refused to carry out — instead bringing his brother Ramiro from the monastery to assume royal powers — an eventuality that Lourie suggests was Alfonso's hidden intent.

His final campaigns were against Mequinenza (1133) and Fraga (1134), where <a href="Garc%C3%ADa%20Ram%C3%ADrez%20of%20Navarre">García Ramírez</a>, the future king of Navarre, and a mere 500 other knights fought with him. It fell on 17 July. He was dead by September. His tomb is in the <a href="Abbey%20of%20San%20Pedro%20el%20Viejo">monastery of San Pedro</a> in <a href="Huesca">Huesca</a>.

The testament of Alfonso leaving his kingdom to the three orders was dismissed out of hand by the nobility of his kingdoms, and possible successors were sought. Alfonso's only brother, <a href="Ramiro%20II%20of%20Aragon">Ramiro</a>, had been a <a href="Order%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Benedictine</a> monk since childhood, and his commitment to the church, his temperament and vow of celibacy made him ill-suited to rule a kingdom under constant military threat and in need of a stable line of succession. The step-son of the deceased king, <a href="Alfonso%20VII%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Alfonso VII of León</a>, as reigning monarch and legitimate descendant of <a href="Sancho%20III%20of%20Navarre">Sancho III of Navarre</a>, put himself forward but garnered no local support. The nobility of Navarre aligned behind <a href="Pedro%20de%20Atar%C3%A9s">Pedro de Atarés</a>, the grandson of Alfonso's illegitimate uncle, while the Aragonese nobility rallied around the abbot-bishop Ramiro. A convention was called at <a href="Borja%2C%20Zaragoza">Borja</a> to develop a consensus, but there Peter so alienated his own partisans with perceived arrogance that they abandoned him, yet were unwilling to accept Ramiro. The convention broke up without arriving at a compromise and the two regional factions then acted independently.

The choice of the Navarrese lords fell on <a href="Garc%C3%ADa%20Ram%C3%ADrez%20of%20Navarre">García Ramírez</a>, Lord of <a href="Monz%C3%B3n">Monzón</a>, descendant of an illegitimate son of <a href="Garc%C3%ADa%20S%C3%A1nchez%20III%20of%20Navarre">García Sánchez III</a> and protégé of Alfonso VII to be their king. The Aragonese took Ramiro out of a monastery and made him king, marrying him without papal dispensation to Agnes, sister of the <a href="Duke%20of%20Aquitaine">Duke of Aquitaine</a>, then betrothing their newborn daughter to <a href="Ramon%20Berenguer%20IV%2C%20Count%20of%20Barcelona">Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona</a>, who was then named Ramiro's heir. "The result of the crisis produced by the result of Alfonso I's will was a major reorientation of the peninsula's kingdoms: the separation of Aragon and Navarre, the union of Aragon and Catalonia and — a moot point but stressed particularly by some Castilian historians — the affirmation of 'Castilian hegemony' in Spain" by the rendering of homage for <a href="Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a> by Alfonso's eventual heir, Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona.

Sometime during the reign of <a href="Alfonso%20II%20of%20Aragon">Alfonso II of Aragon</a>, the Battler's grandnephew, a man came forward claiming to be Alfonso the Battler. The only contemporary references to this event are two letters of Alfonso II addressed to <a href="Louis%20VII%20of%20France">Louis VII of France</a>; they were carried to Louis by <a href="Berengar%20%28Bishop%20of%20L%C3%A9rida%29">Berengar</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20L%C3%A9rida">Bishop of Lleida</a>, but are not dated. According to the second of these, the pretender was then living in Louis's domains, meaning the <a href="Principality%20of%20Catalonia">Principality of Catalonia</a>, which was ruled by Alfonso under Louis's suzerainty. This pretender was an old man (appropriately, since the Battler had died some decades earlier) and Alfonso II expressed confidence that Louis would arrest him at the earliest possible moment and bring him to justice. The first letter supplies sufficient information to date it approximately, since the Bishop sojourned at the court of Louis on his way to Rome. It is known from other sources that Berengar attended the <a href="Third%20Lateran%20Council">Third Lateran Council</a> in March 1179. The letters were probably written towards the end of 1178 or in January 1179 at the latest. According to an annalist source for the years 1089–1196, the pretender was received with honour and pomp in Zaragoza, Calatayud, and Daroca, which the Battler had conquered, but after it was found out that he was false he was executed before the city of Barcelona in 1181. Modern historian <a href="Antonio%20Ubieto%20Arteta">Antonio Ubieto Arteta</a> has hypothesised that the Aragonese lords of the tenencies of Zaragoza, Calatayud, and Daroca — Pedro de Luesia, Loferrench de Luna, Pedro de Castillazuelo (lord of Calatayud), Pedro Cornel (lord of Murillo de Gállego), and the majordomo Jimeno de Artusilla, all of whom disappear between 1177 and 1181 in the documentation of their tenencies — supported, at least inititally, the pretender. These lords also appear in the later legend of the <a href="Bell%20of%20Huesca">Bell of Huesca</a>, which has no historical basis, as the victims of Ramiro II (1136). Since, historically, they were not active in the 1130s, it is possible that the historically-based legend of the pseudo-Alfonso had some influence on the genesis of the Bell of Huesca.

The earliest chronicle source for the imposture is <a href="Rodrigo%20Jim%C3%A9nez%20de%20Rada">Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada</a>, writing in the middle of the thirteenth century, who records that there were several legends then current about the death of Alfonso the Battler: some believed he perished in the <a href="battle%20of%20Fraga">battle of Fraga</a>, some that his body had never been recovered, others that he was buried in the monastery of <a href="Castle%20of%20Montearag%C3%B3n">Montearagón</a>, and still others that he had fled from Fraga in shame after his defeat and became a pilgrim as an act of penance. Some years later, Rodrigo writes, though he does not give a year, an impostor arose and was received by many as the Battler, though Alfonso II had him arrested and hanged. This is the earliest reference to the impostor's end. The legend was amplified in later years. According to the fourteenth-century "<a href="Cr%C3%B3nica%20de%20los%20Estados%20Peninsulares">Crónica de los Estados Peninsulares</a>", the Battler went on a pilgrimage to <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, where he lived for many years. The "<a href="Cr%C3%B3nica%20de%20San%20Juan%20de%20la%20Pe%C3%B1a">Crónica de San Juan de la Peña</a>" also recounts the incident, but it depends entirely on Rodrigo and the "Estados Peninsulares". It is not until the seventeenth-century historian <a href="Jer%C3%B3nimo%20Zurita">Jerónimo Zurita</a> penned his "Anales de la Corona de Aragón" that new details were added to the legend. Zurita dates the impostor's appearance to the death of <a href="Raymond%20Berengar%20IV%20of%20Barcelona">Raymond Berengar IV of Barcelona</a>, who had been exercising power in Aragon, and the succession of the child Alfonso II in 1162. The death of the impostor, by hanging, must have occurred in 1163.

Amaryllis

Amaryllis () is the only <a href="genus">genus</a> in the <a href="subtribe">subtribe</a> Amaryllidinae (<a href="tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a> <a href="Amaryllideae">Amaryllideae</a>). It is a small genus of flowering <a href="bulb">bulb</a>s, with two species. The better known of the two, "Amaryllis belladonna", is a <a href="native%20plant">native</a> of the <a href="Western%20Cape">Western Cape</a> region of <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, particularly the rocky southwest area between the <a href="Olifants%20River%20%28Western%20Cape%29">Olifants River</a> Valley to <a href="Knysna%2C%20Western%20Cape">Knysna</a>. For many years there was confusion among botanists over the generic names "Amaryllis" and "Hippeastrum", one result of which is that the common name "amaryllis" is mainly used for <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s of the genus "<a href="Hippeastrum">Hippeastrum</a>", widely sold in the winter months for their ability to <a href="flower">bloom</a> indoors. Plants of the genus "Amaryllis" are known as belladonna lily, Jersey lily, naked lady, amarillo, Easter lily in Southern <a href="Australia">Australia</a> or, in South Africa, March lily due to its propensity to flower around March. This is one of numerous genera with the common name "lily" due to their flower shape and growth habit. However, they are only distantly related to the true lily, "<a href="Lilium">Lilium</a>".

"Amaryllis" is a <a href="bulb">bulb</a>ous plant, with each bulb being in diameter. It has several strap-shaped, green <a href="leaf">leaves</a>, long and broad, arranged in two rows.

Each bulb produces one or two leafless stems 30–60 cm tall, each of which bears a cluster of two to twelve funnel-shaped <a href="flower">flower</a>s at their tops. Each flower is diameter with six <a href="tepal">tepal</a>s (three outer sepals, three inner petals, with similar appearance to each other). The usual color is white with crimson veins, but pink or purple also occur naturally.

The single genus in <a href="subtribe">subtribe</a> Amaryllidinae, in the <a href="Amaryllideae">Amaryllideae</a> tribe. The taxonomy of the genus has been controversial. In 1753 <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> created the name "Amaryllis belladonna", the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "Amaryllis". At the time both South African and South American plants were placed in the same genus; subsequently they were separated into two different genera. The key question is whether Linnaeus's type was a South African plant or a South American plant. If the latter, "Amaryllis" would be the correct name for the genus "<a href="Hippeastrum">Hippeastrum</a>", and a different name would have to be used for the genus discussed here. <a href="Alan%20W.%20Meerow">Alan W. Meerow</a> et al. have briefly summarized the debate, which took place from 1938 onwards and involved botanists on both sides of the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a>. The outcome was a decision by the 14th International Botanical Congress in 1987 that "Amaryllis" should be a conserved name (i.e. correct regardless of priority) and ultimately based on a specimen of the South African "<a href="Amaryllis%20belladonna">Amaryllis belladonna</a>" from the Clifford Herbarium at the British Museum.

Amaryllidinae are placed within Amaryllideae as follow:

These are phylogenetically related as follows:

The name "Amaryllis" is taken from a shepherdess in <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s pastoral "<a href="Eclogues">Eclogues</a>", (from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> (""), meaning "to sparkle") and also from "Amarella" for the bitterness of the bulb.

Although the 1987 decision settled the question of the scientific name of the genus, the common name "amaryllis" continues to be used differently. Bulbs sold as amaryllis and described as "ready to bloom for the holidays" belong to the allied genus "<a href="Hippeastrum">Hippeastrum</a>". The common name "naked lady" used for "Amaryllis" is also used for other bulbs with a similar growth and flowering pattern; some of these have their own widely used and accepted common names, such as the resurrection lily ("<a href="Lycoris%20squamigera">Lycoris squamigera</a>"). The common name "naked lady" comes from the plant's pattern of flowering when the foliage has died down.

In areas of its native habitat with mountainous <a href="fynbos">fynbos</a> flowering tends to be suppressed until after bush fires as dense overhead vegetation prevents growth. In more open sandy areas of the Western Cape, the plant flowers annually. Plants tend to be very localized in dense concentrations due to the seeds' large size and heavy weight. Strong winds shake loose the seeds, which fall to ground and immediately start to germinate, aided by the first winter rains.

The leaves are produced in the autumn or early spring in warm climates depending on the onset of rain and eventually die down by late spring. The bulb is then dormant until late summer. The plant is not frost-tolerant, nor does it do well in tropical environments since they require a dry resting period between leaf growth and flower spike production.

One or two leafless stems arise from the bulb in the dry ground in late summer (March in its native habitat and August in <a href="hardiness%20zone">USDA zone 7</a>).

The plant has a <a href="Symbiosis">symbiotic</a> relationship with <a href="carpenter%20bee">carpenter bee</a>s. It is also visited by <a href="Noctuidae">noctuid moths</a> at night. The relative importance of these animals as pollinators has not yet been established; however, Carpenter bees are thought to be the main pollinators of amaryllis on the <a href="Cape%20Peninsula">Cape Peninsula</a>. The plant's main parasite is the lily borer "<a href="Brithys%20crini">Brithys crini</a>" and/or "<a href="Diaphone%20eumela">Diaphone eumela</a>".

"Amaryllis belladonna" was introduced into cultivation at the beginning of the eighteenth century. It reproduces slowly by either bulb division or seeds and has gradually naturalized from plantings in urban and suburban areas throughout the lower elevations and coastal areas in much of the West Coast of the USA since these environments mimic their native South African habitat. Hardiness zones 6-8. It is also naturalized in Australia.

There is an "Amaryllis belladonna" hybrid which was bred in the 1800s in Australia. No one knows the exact species it was crossed with to produce color variations of white, cream, peach, magenta and nearly red hues. The hybrids were crossed back onto the original "Amaryllis belladonna" and with each other to produce naturally seed-bearing crosses that come in a very wide range of flower sizes, shapes, stem heights and intensities of pink. Pure white varieties with bright green stems were bred as well. The hybrids are quite distinct in that the many shades of pink also have stripes, veining, darkened edges, white centers and light yellow centers, also setting them apart from the original light pink. In addition, the hybrids often produce flowers in a fuller circle rather than the "side-facing" habit of the "old-fashioned" pink. The hybrids are able to adapt to year-round watering and fertilization but can also tolerate completely dry summer conditions if need be.

"A. belladonna" has gained the <a href="Royal%20Horticultural%20Society">Royal Horticultural Society</a>'s <a href="Award%20of%20Garden%20Merit">Award of Garden Merit</a>.

"Amaryllis belladonna" has been crossed in cultivation with "<a href="Crinum%20moorei">Crinum moorei</a>" to produce a hybrid called <a href="%C3%97%20Amarcrinum">× "Amarcrinum"</a>, which has named cultivars. Hybrids said to be between "Amaryllis belladonna" and "<a href="Brunsvigia%20josephinae">Brunsvigia josephinae</a>" have been called × "Amarygia". Neither hybrid genus name is accepted by the "World Checklist of Selected Plant Families".

Alfonso III of Aragon

Alfonso III (4 November 1265, in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Valencia">Valencia</a> – 18 June 1291), called the Liberal ("el Liberal") or the Free (also "the Frank," from "el Franc"), was the <a href="King%20of%20Aragon">King of Aragon</a> and <a href="Count%20of%20Barcelona">Count of Barcelona</a> (as Alfons II) from 1285. He conquered the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Majorca">Kingdom of Majorca</a> between his succession and 1287.

He was a son of King <a href="Peter%20III%20of%20Aragon">Peter III of Aragon</a> and <a href="Constance%20of%20Sicily%2C%20Queen%20of%20Aragon">Constance</a>, daughter and heiress of King <a href="Manfred%20of%20Sicily">Manfred of Sicily</a>.

Soon after assuming the throne, he conducted a campaign to reincorporate the <a href="Balearic%20Islands">Balearic Islands</a> into the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Aragon">Kingdom of Aragon</a> - which had been lost due to the division of the kingdom by his grandfather, <a href="James%20I%20of%20Aragon">James I of Aragon</a>. Thus in 1285 he declared war on his uncle, <a href="James%20II%20of%20Majorca">James II of Majorca</a>, and conquered both Majorca (1285) and Ibiza (1286), effectively reassuming suzerainty over the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Majorca">Kingdom of Majorca</a>. He followed this with the conquest of <a href="Menorca">Menorca</a> - until then, an autonomous <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> state (<a href="Man%C3%BBrqa">Manûrqa</a>) within the Kingdom of Majorca - on 17 January 1287, the anniversary of which now serves as Menorca's national holiday.

He initially sought to maintain Aragonese control over Sicily early in his reign by supporting the claims to the island of his brother, <a href="James%20II%20of%20Aragon">James II of Aragon</a>. However, he later retracted the support for his brother shortly before his death and instead tried to make peace with the <a href="Papal%20States">Papal States</a> France.

His reign was marred by a constitutional struggle with the Aragonese nobles, which eventually culminated in the articles of the <a href="Union%20of%20Aragon">Union of Aragon</a> - the so-called "Magna Carta of Aragon", which devolved several key royal powers into the hands of lesser nobles. His inability to resist the demands of his nobles was to leave a heritage of disunity in Aragon and further dissent amongst the nobility, who increasingly saw little reason to respect the throne, and brought the Kingdom of Aragon close to anarchy.

During his lifetime a dynastic marriage with <a href="Eleanor%20of%20England%20%281269-1298%29">Eleanor</a>, daughter of King <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I of England</a>, was arranged. However Alfonso died before meeting his bride. He died at the age of 26 in 1291, and was buried in the Franciscan convent in Barcelona; since 1852 his remains have been buried in Barcelona Cathedral.

<a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a>, in <a href="the%20Divine%20Comedy">the Divine Comedy</a>, recounts that he saw Alfonso's spirit seated outside the gates of <a href="Purgatory">Purgatory</a> with the other monarchs whom Dante blamed for the chaotic political state of <a href="Europe">Europe</a> during the 13th century.

Alfonso IV of Aragon

Alfonso IV, called the Kind (also "the Gentle" or "the Nice", ) (2 November 1299 – 24 January 1336) was the <a href="King%20of%20Aragon">King of Aragon</a> and <a href="Count%20of%20Barcelona">Count of Barcelona</a> (as Alfonso III) from 1327 to his death. He was born in <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, the second son of <a href="James%20II%20of%20Aragon">James II</a> and <a href="Blanche%20of%20Anjou">Blanche of Anjou</a>. His reign saw the incorporation of the <a href="County%20of%20Urgell">County of Urgell</a>, <a href="Duchy%20of%20Athens">Duchy of Athens</a>, and <a href="Duchy%20of%20Neopatria">Duchy of Neopatria</a> into the <a href="Crown%20of%20Aragon">Crown of Aragon</a>.

During the reign of his father, he was the procurator general of the Crown. He married <a href="Teresa%20d%27Enten%C3%A7a%20y%20Cabrera">Teresa d'Entença y Cabrera</a>, heiress of <a href="Urgell">Urgell</a>, in 1314 in the Cathedral of <a href="Lerida">Lerida</a>. He is reputed to have been so liberal in the expenses during the wedding, that the local counsels imposed restrictions on how much he could spend. In 1323–1324, he undertook the <a href="Aragonese%20conquest%20of%20Sardinia">conquest of Sardinia</a>. He became heir after his older brother <a href="James%20of%20Aragon%20%28monk%29">James</a> renounced his rights to become a monk. In 1329, he began a long war with the <a href="Republic%20of%20Genoa">Republic of Genoa</a>. The city of <a href="Sassari">Sassari</a> surrendered in 1323, but rebelled three more times and was contested by Genoa.

After being widowed in 1327, Alfonso married in February 1329 <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Castile%20%281307-1359%29">Eleanor of Castile</a> (1308–1359), who was betrothed to his brother James, who had refused to consummate the marriage. She was the sister of <a href="Alfonso%20XI%20of%20Castile">Alfonso XI of Castile</a>. Because of some favoritism he showed towards his second wife, the last years of his life, he had to contend with the son of his first marriage, the future <a href="Peter%20IV%20of%20Aragon">Peter IV</a>.

<doc id="1685" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1685" title="Amasis II">
Amasis II

Amasis II () or Ahmose II was a <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a> (reigned 570 BCE526 BCE) of the <a href="Twenty-sixth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt</a>, the successor of <a href="Apries">Apries</a> at <a href="Sais%2C%20Egypt">Sais</a>. He was the last great ruler of <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a> before the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian</a> conquest.

Most of our information about him is derived from <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> (2.161ff) and can only be imperfectly verified by monumental evidence. According to the Greek historian, he was of common origins. He was originally an <a href="officer">officer</a> in the Egyptian army. His birthplace was Siuph at <a href="Sa%C3%AFs">Saïs</a>. He took part in a general campaign of Pharaoh <a href="Psamtik%20II">Psamtik II</a> in 592 BC in <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>.

A revolt which broke out among native Egyptian soldiers gave him his opportunity to seize the throne. These troops, returning home from a disastrous military expedition to <a href="Cyrene%20%28city%29">Cyrene</a> in Libya, suspected that they had been betrayed in order that <a href="Apries">Apries</a>, the reigning king, might rule more absolutely by means of his Greek <a href="mercenaries">mercenaries</a>; many Egyptians fully sympathized with them. General Amasis, sent to meet them and quell the revolt, was proclaimed king by the rebels instead, and Apries, who had now to rely entirely on his mercenaries, was defeated. Apries fled to the Babylonians and was killed mounting an invasion of his native homeland in 567 BCE with the aid of a Babylonian army. An inscription confirms the struggle between the native Egyptian and the foreign soldiery, and proves that Apries was killed and honourably buried in the third year of Amasis ( BCE). Amasis then married Chedebnitjerbone II, one of the daughters of his predecessor <a href="Apries">Apries</a>, in order to legitimise his kingship.

Some information is known about the family origins of Amasis: his mother was a certain Tashereniset, as a bust of her, today located in the British Museum, shows. A stone block from Mehallet el-Kubra also establishes that his maternal grandmother—Tashereniset's mother—was a certain Tjenmutetj.

His court is relatively well known. The head of the gate guard Ahmose-sa-Neith appears on numerous monuments, including the location of his sarcophagus. He was referenced on monuments of the 30th dynasty and apparently had a special significance in his time. Wahibre was 'Leader of the southern foreigners' and 'Head of the doors of foreigners', so he was the highest official for border security. Under Amasis the career of the doctor Udjahorresnet began, who was of particular importance to the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persians</a>. Several "heads of the fleet" are known. Psamtek Meryneit and Pasherientaihet / Padineith are the only known viziers.

<a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> describes how Amasis II would eventually cause a confrontation with the Persian armies. According to Herodotus, Amasis was asked by <a href="Cambyses%20II">Cambyses II</a> or <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus the Great</a> for an Egyptian <a href="ophthalmologist">ophthalmologist</a> on good terms. Amasis seems to have complied by forcing an Egyptian physician into mandatory labor, causing him to leave his family behind in Egypt and move to Persia in forced exile. In an attempt to exact revenge for this, the physician grew very close to Cambyses and suggested that Cambyses should ask Amasis for a daughter in marriage in order to solidify his bonds with the Egyptians. Cambyses complied and requested a daughter of Amasis for marriage.

Amasis, worrying that his daughter would be a concubine to the Persian king, refused to give up his offspring; Amasis also was not willing to take on the Persian empire, so he concocted a deception in which he forced the daughter of the ex-pharaoh <a href="Apries">Apries</a>, whom Herodotus explicitly confirms to have been killed by Amasis, to go to Persia instead of his own offspring.

This daughter of Apries was none other than <a href="Nitetis">Nitetis</a>, who was, as per Herodotus's account, "tall and beautiful." Nitetis naturally betrayed Amasis and upon being greeted by the Persian king explained Amasis's trickery and her true origins. This infuriated Cambyses and he vowed to take revenge for it. Amasis died before Cambyses reached him, but his heir and son Psamtik III was defeated by the Persians.

First, Cambyses signed alliance agreements with the <a href="Lydia">Lydia</a>n King <a href="Croesus">Croesus</a> and <a href="Nabonidus">Nabonidus</a> the Babylonian king in 542 BC. The actual aim of the agreements was to prevent aid between Egypt and her allies. With both now deprived of Egyptian support, the Persians conquered, first, Croesus's empire in 541 BCE, and, then, the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 539 BCE.

Herodotus also describes that just like his predecessor, Amasis relied on Greek mercenaries and councilmen. One such figure was <a href="Phanes%20of%20Halicarnassus">Phanes of Halicarnassus</a>, who would later on leave Amasis, for reasons Herodotus does not clearly know but suspects were personal between the two figures. Amasis sent one of his <a href="eunuch">eunuch</a>s to capture Phanes, but the eunuch was bested by the wise councilman and Phanes fled to Persia, meeting up with Cambyses and providing advice in his invasion of Egypt. Egypt was finally lost to the Persians during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pelusium%20%28525%20BC%29">battle of Pelusium</a> in 525 BC.

Although Amasis appears first as champion of the disparaged native, he had the good sense to cultivate the friendship of the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek world</a>, and brought Egypt into closer touch with it than ever before. Herodotus relates that under his prudent administration, Egypt reached a new level of wealth; Amasis adorned the temples of <a href="Lower%20Egypt">Lower Egypt</a> especially with splendid <a href="monolith">monolith</a>ic <a href="shrine">shrine</a>s and other monuments (his activity here is proved by existing remains). For example, a temple built by him was excavated at <a href="Tell%20Nebesha">Tell Nebesha</a>.

Amasis assigned the commercial colony of <a href="Naucratis">Naucratis</a> on the <a href="Canopus%2C%20Egypt">Canopic</a> branch of the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> to the Greeks, and when the <a href="temple%20of%20Delphi">temple of Delphi</a> was burnt, he contributed 1,000 <a href="talent%20%28weight%29">talents</a> to the rebuilding. He also married a Greek princess named <a href="Ladice%20%28Cyrenaean%20Princess%29">Ladice</a> daughter of King <a href="Battus%20III%20of%20Cyrene">Battus III</a> and made alliances with <a href="Polycrates">Polycrates</a> of Samos and <a href="Croesus">Croesus</a> of Lydia.

Under Amasis, Egypt's agricultural based economy reached its zenith. Herodotus, who visited Egypt less than a century after Amasis II's death, writes that:
His kingdom consisted probably of Egypt only, as far as the <a href="First%20Cataract">First Cataract</a>, but to this he added <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, and his influence was great in Cyrene. In his fourth year ( BCE), Amasis was able to defeat an invasion of Egypt by the Babylonians under <a href="Nebuchadnezzar%20II">Nebuchadnezzar II</a>; henceforth, the Babylonians experienced sufficient difficulties controlling their empire that they were forced to abandon future attacks against Amasis. However, Amasis was later faced with a more formidable enemy with the rise of Persia under <a href="Cyrus%20II%20of%20Persia">Cyrus</a> who ascended to the throne in 559 BCE; his final years were preoccupied by the threat of the impending Persian onslaught against Egypt. With great strategic skill, Cyrus had destroyed Lydia in 546 BCE and finally defeated the Babylonians in 538 BCE which left Amasis with no major Near Eastern allies to counter Persia's increasing military might. Amasis reacted by cultivating closer ties with the Greek states to counter the future Persian invasion into Egypt but was fortunate to have died in 526 BCE shortly before the Persians attacked. The final assault instead fell upon his son <a href="Psamtik%20III">Psamtik III</a>, whom the Persians defeated in 525 BCE after a reign of only six months.

Amasis II died in 526 BC. He was buried at the royal necropolis of Sais, and while his tomb was never discovered, Herodotus describes it for us:

Herodotus also relates the desecration of Ahmose II/Amasis' mummy when the Persian king Cambyses conquered Egypt and thus ended the 26th Saite dynasty:

From the fifth century BCE, there is evidence of stories circulating about Amasis, in Egyptian sources (including a demotic papyrus of the third century BCE), <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, <a href="Hellanicus%20of%20Lesbos">Hellanikos</a>, and <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>'s "<a href="Convivium%20Septem%20Sapientium">Convivium Septem Sapientium</a>". 'In those tales Amasis was presented as a non-conventional Pharaoh, behaving in ways unbecoming to a king but gifted with practical wisdom and cunning, a trickster on the trone or a kind of comic Egyptian <a href="Solomon">Solomon</a>'.

Alfonso V of Aragon

Alfonso the Magnanimous <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">KG</a> (also Alphonso; ; 1396 – 27 June 1458) was the <a href="King%20of%20Aragon">King of Aragon</a> (as Alfonso V), <a href="King%20of%20Valencia">Valencia</a> (as Alfonso III), <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Majorca">Majorca</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sardinia">Sardinia and Corsica</a> (as Alfonso II), <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Sicily">Sicily</a> (as Alfonso I) and <a href="Count%20of%20Barcelona">Count of Barcelona</a> (as Alfonso IV) from 1416, and <a href="King%20of%20Naples">King of Naples</a> (as Alfonso I) from 1442 until his death. He was one of the most prominent figures of the early <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> and a knight of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Dragon">Order of the Dragon</a>.

Born at <a href="Medina%20del%20Campo">Medina del Campo</a>, he was the son of <a href="Ferdinand%20I%20of%20Aragon">Ferdinand I of Aragon</a> and <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Alburquerque">Eleanor of Alburquerque</a>. He represented the old line of the counts of <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> through the female line, and was on his father's side descended from the <a href="House%20of%20Trastamara">House of Trastamara</a>, the reigning House of <a href="Castile%20%28historical%20region%29">Castile</a>. By hereditary right he was king of <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> and claimed the island of <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a> for himself, though it was then in the possession of <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>. Alfonso was also in possession of much of <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a> by the 1420s.

In 1421 the childless Queen <a href="Joanna%20II%20of%20Naples">Joanna II of Naples</a> adopted and named him as heir to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Naples">Kingdom of Naples</a>, and Alfonso went to <a href="Naples">Naples</a>. Here he hired the <a href="condottiero">condottiero</a> <a href="Braccio%20da%20Montone">Braccio da Montone</a> with the task of reducing the resistance of his rival claimant, <a href="Louis%20III%20of%20Anjou">Louis III of Anjou</a>, and his forces led by <a href="Muzio%20Attendolo">Muzio Attendolo</a> <a href="Sforza">Sforza</a>. With Pope <a href="Martin%20V">Martin V</a> supporting Sforza, Alfonso switched his religious allegiance to the Aragonese <a href="antipope%20Benedict%20XIII">antipope Benedict XIII</a>. When Sforza abandoned Louis' cause, Alfonso seemed to have all his problems solved; however, his relationship with Joanna suddenly worsened, and in May 1423 he had her lover, <a href="Gianni%20Caracciolo">Gianni Caracciolo</a>, a powerful figure in the Neapolitan court, arrested.

After an attempt to arrest the queen herself had failed, Joan called on Sforza who defeated the Aragonese militias near <a href="Castel%20Capuano">Castel Capuano</a> in Naples. Alfonso fled to <a href="Castel%20Nuovo">Castel Nuovo</a>, but the help of a fleet of 22 galleys led by <a href="Giovanni%20da%20Cardona">Giovanni da Cardona</a> improved his situation. Sforza and Joanna ransomed Caracciolo and retreated to the fortress of <a href="Aversa">Aversa</a>. Here she repudiated her earlier adoption of Alfonso and, with the backing of Martin V, named Louis III as her heir instead.

The Duke of Milan, <a href="Filippo%20Maria%20Visconti">Filippo Maria Visconti</a>, joined the anti-Aragonese coalition. Alfonso requested support from Braccio da Montone, who was besieging Joanna's troops in <a href="L%27Aquila">L'Aquila</a>, but had to set sail for Spain, where a war had broken out between his brothers and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Kingdom of Castile</a>. On his way towards Barcelona, Alfonso destroyed <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a>, a possession of Louis III.

In late 1423 the Genoese fleet of Filippo Maria Visconti moved in the southern <a href="Tyrrhenian%20Sea">Tyrrhenian Sea</a>, rapidly conquering <a href="Gaeta">Gaeta</a>, <a href="Procida">Procida</a>, <a href="Castellammare%20di%20Stabia">Castellammare</a> and <a href="Sorrento">Sorrento</a>. Naples, which was held by Alfonso's brother, Pedro de Aragon, was besieged in 1424 by the Genoese ships and Joanna's troops, now led by <a href="Francesco%20Sforza">Francesco Sforza</a>, the son of Muzio Sforza (who had met his death at L'Aquila). The city fell in April 1424. Pedro, after a short resistance in Castel Nuovo, fled to <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> in August. Joanna II and Louis III again took possession of the realm, although the true power was in the hands of <a href="Gianni%20Caracciolo">Gianni Caracciolo</a>.

An opportunity for Alfonso to reconquer Naples occurred in 1432, when Caracciolo was killed in a conspiracy. Alfonso tried to regain the favour of the queen, but failed, and had to wait for the death of both Louis (at Cosenza in 1434) and Joanna herself (February 1435). In her will, she bequeathed her realm to <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20I%20of%20Naples">René of Anjou</a>, Louis III's younger brother. This solution was opposed by the new pope, <a href="Eugene%20IV">Eugene IV</a>, who nominally was the feudal lord of the King of Naples. The Neapolitans having called in the French, Alfonso decided to intervene and, with the support of several barons of the kingdom, captured <a href="Capua">Capua</a> and besieged the important sea fortress of Gaeta. His fleet of 25 galleys was met by the Genoese ships sent by Visconti, led by <a href="Biagio%20Assereto">Biagio Assereto</a>. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ponza%20%281435%29">battle of Ponza</a> that ensued, Alfonso was defeated and taken prisoner.

In Milan, however, he impressed his captor with his cultured demeanor and persuaded him to let him go by making it plain that it was not in Milan's interest to prevent the victory of the Aragonese party in Naples. Helped by a Sicilian fleet, Alfonso recaptured Capua and set his base in Gaeta in February 1436. Meanwhile, papal troops had invaded the Neapolitan kingdom, but Alfonso bribed their commander, Cardinal <a href="Giovanni%20Vitelleschi">Giovanni Vitelleschi</a>, and their successes waned.

In the meantime, René had managed to reach Naples on 19 May 1438. Alfonso tried to besiege the city in the following September, but failed. His brother Pedro was killed during the battle. Castel Nuovo, where an Aragonese garrison resisted, fell to the Angevine mercenaries in August 1439. After the death of his condottiero <a href="Jacopo%20Caldora">Jacopo Caldora</a>, however, René's fortune started to decline: Alfonso could easily capture <a href="Aversa">Aversa</a>, <a href="Salerno">Salerno</a>, <a href="Benevento">Benevento</a>, <a href="Manfredonia">Manfredonia</a> and <a href="Bitonto">Bitonto</a>. René, whose possession included now only part of the <a href="Abruzzi">Abruzzi</a> and Naples, obtained 10,000 men from the pope, but the cardinal leading them signed a truce with Alfonso. Giovanni Sforza came with a reduced corps, as troops sent by Eugene IV had halted his father Francesco in the <a href="Marche">Marche</a>.

Alfonso, provided with the most impressive artillery of the times, again besieged Naples. The siege began on 10 November 1441, ending on 2 June the following year. After the return of René to Provence, Alfonso easily reduced the remaining resistance and made his triumphal entrance in Naples on 26 February 1443, as the monarch of a pacified kingdom. In 1446 he also conquered Sardinia.

Alfonso, by formally submitting his reign to the Papacy, obtained the consent of Pope <a href="Eugene%20IV">Eugene IV</a> that the Kingdom of Naples would go to his illegitimate son <a href="Ferdinand%20I%20of%20Naples">Ferdinand</a>. He died in <a href="Castel%20dell%27Ovo">Castel dell'Ovo</a> in 1458, while he was planning the conquest of <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>. At the time, Alfonso was at odds with <a href="Pope%20Callixtus%20III">Callixtus III</a>, who died shortly afterwards.

His Spanish possessions were ruled for him by his brother John, later king <a href="John%20II%20of%20Aragon">John II of Aragon</a>. Sicily and <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a> were also inherited by his brother.

Alfonso was also a powerful and faithful supporter of <a href="Skanderbeg">Skanderbeg</a>, whom he decided to take under his protection as a vassal in 1451, shortly after the latter had scored his second victory against <a href="Murad%20II">Murad II</a>. In addition to financial assistance, he supplied the <a href="Albania">Albania</a>n leader with troops, military equipment, and sanctuary for himself and his family if such a need should arise. This was because in 1448, while Skanderbeg was victoriously fighting off the Turkish invasions, three military columns, commanded by <a href="Demetrio%20Reres">Demetrio Reres</a> along with his sons Giorgio and Basilio, had been dispatched to help Alfonso V defeat the barons of Naples who had rebelled against him.

Alfonso had been betrothed to <a href="Maria%20of%20Castile">Maria of Castile</a> (1401–1458; sister of <a href="John%20II%20of%20Castile">John II of Castile</a>) in <a href="Valladolid">Valladolid</a> in 1408; the marriage was celebrated in <a href="Valencia%20%28city%20in%20Spain%29">Valencia</a> on 12 June 1415. They failed to produce children. Alfonso had been in love with a woman of noble family named <a href="Lucrezia%20d%27Alagno">Lucrezia d'Alagno</a>, who served as a "de facto" queen at the Neapolitan court as well as an inspiring <a href="muse">muse</a>.

Genealogical records in the <a href="Occitan%20language">Old Occitan</a> <a href="Chronique%20romane">Chronicle of Montpellier</a> in "Le petit Thalamus de Montpellier" indicate that Alphonso's relationship with his mistress, <a href="Giraldona%20Carlino">Giraldona Carlino</a>, produced three children:


Giraldona was the daughter of Enrique Carlino and his wife, Isabel.

Like many Renaissance rulers, Alfonso V was a patron of the arts. He founded the Academy of <a href="Naples">Naples</a> under <a href="Giovanni%20Pontano">Giovanni Pontano</a>, and for his entrance into the city in 1443 had a magnificent triumphal arch added to the main gate of <a href="Castel%20Nuovo">Castel Nuovo</a>. The edifice was designed by <a href="Francesco%20Laurana">Francesco Laurana</a>.

Alfonso was particularly attracted to <a href="classical%20literature">classical literature</a>. He reportedly brought copies of the works of <a href="Livy">Livy</a> and <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> on his campaigns; the poet <a href="Antonio%20Beccadelli%20%28poet%29">Antonio Beccadelli</a> even claimed that Alfonso was cured of a disease by the reading of a few pages from <a href="Quintus%20Curtius%20Rufus">Quintus Curtius Rufus</a>' history of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>. Although this reputed erudition attracted scholars to his court, Alfonso apparently enjoyed pitting them against each other in spectacles of bawdy Latin rhetoric.

After his conquest of Naples in 1442, Alfonso ruled primarily through his mercenaries and political lackeys. In his Italian kingdom, he maintained the former political and administrative institutions. His holdings in Spain were governed by his brother John.

A unified General Chancellorship for the whole Aragonese realm was set up in Naples, although the main functionaries were of Aragonese nationality. Apart from financial, administrative and artistic improvements, his other accomplishments in the Sicilian kingdom include the restoration of the aqueducts, the drainage of marshy areas, and the paving of streets.

Alfonso was the object of diplomatic contacts from the empire of <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>. In 1428, he received a letter from <a href="Yeshaq%20I%20of%20Ethiopia">Yeshaq I of Ethiopia</a>, borne by two dignitaries, which proposed an alliance against the <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s and would be sealed by a dual marriage that would require the <a href="Peter%20of%20Aragon%2C%20Count%20of%20Alburquerque">Infante Peter</a> to bring a group of artisans to Ethiopia where he would marry Yeshaq's daughter.

In return, Alfonso sent a party of 13 craftsmen, all of whom perished on the way to Ethiopia. He later sent a letter to Yeshaq's successor <a href="Zara%20Yaqob">Zara Yaqob</a> in 1450, in which he wrote that he would be happy to send artisans to Ethiopia if their safe arrival could be guaranteed, but it probably never reached the Emperor.

Amathus

Amathus or Amathous () was an ancient city and one of the ancient royal cities of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> until about 300 BC. Some of its impressive remains can be seen today on the southern coast in front of <a href="Agios%20Tychonas">Agios Tychonas</a>, about 24 miles west of <a href="Larnaca">Larnaca</a> and 6 miles east of <a href="Limassol">Limassol</a>. Its ancient cult sanctuary of <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a> was the second most important in Cyprus, her homeland, after <a href="Paphos">Paphos</a>.

Archaeological work has recently been continued at the site and many finds are exhibited in the Limassol Museum.

The pre-history of Amathus mixes myth and <a href="archaeology">archaeology</a>. Archaeology has detected human activity from the earliest <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>, BC. 
The city's legendary founder was <a href="Cinyras">Cinyras</a>, linked with the birth of <a href="Adonis">Adonis</a>, who called the city after his mother Amathous. According to a version of the <a href="Ariadne">Ariadne</a> legend noted by <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, <a href="Theseus">Theseus</a> abandoned Ariadne at Amathousa, where she died giving birth to her child and was buried in a sacred tomb. According to Plutarch's source, Amathousians called the <a href="sacred%20grove">sacred grove</a> where her shrine was situated the Wood of Aphrodite Ariadne. More purely Hellenic myth would have Amathus settled instead by one of the sons of <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a>, thus accounting for the fact that he was worshiped there.
It was said in antiquity that the people of Amathus were <a href="Autochthon%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">autochthonous</a>, or "<a href="Pelasgian">Pelasgian</a>". Their non-Greek language is confirmed on the site by <a href="Eteocypriot">Eteocypriot</a> inscriptions in the <a href="Cypriot%20syllabary">Cypriot syllabary</a> which alone in the Aegean world survived the <a href="Bronze%20Age%20collapse">Bronze Age collapse</a> and continued to be used down to the 4th century BC.
Amathus was built on the coastal cliffs with a natural harbour and flourished at an early date, soon requiring several cemeteries. Greeks from <a href="Euboea">Euboea</a> left their pottery at Amathus from the 10th century BC. During the post-Phoenician era of the 8th century BC, a <a href="palace">palace</a> was erected and a port was also constructed, which served the trade with the <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a> and the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>ines. A special burial ground for infants, a "<a href="tophet">tophet</a>" served the culture of the <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>ns. For the Hellenes, high on the cliff a temple was built, which became a worship site devoted to <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>, in her particular local presence as "<a href="Amathusia">Aphrodite Amathusia</a>" along with a bearded male Aphrodite called "<a href="Aphroditos">Aphroditos</a>". The excavators discovered the final stage of the Temple of Aphrodite, also known as <a href="Aphrodisias">Aphrodisias</a>, which dates approximately to the 1st century BC. According to the legend, it was where festive <a href="Adonia">Adonia</a> took place, in which athletes competed in hunting wild boars during sport competitions; they also competed in dancing and singing, all to the honour of Adonis.
The earliest remains hitherto found on the site are tombs of the early <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> period of Graeco-<a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>n influences (1000-600 BC). Amathus is identified with "Kartihadasti" (Phoenician "New-Town") in the Cypriote tribute-list of <a href="Esarhaddon">Esarhaddon</a> of <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a> (668 BC). It certainly maintained strong <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>n sympathies, for it was its refusal to join the philhellene league of <a href="Onesilus">Onesilos</a> of <a href="Salamis%2C%20Cyprus">Salamis</a> which provoked the revolt of Cyprus from <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Persia</a> in 500-494 BC, when Amathus was besieged unsuccessfully and avenged itself by the capture and execution of Onesilos. Herodotus reports

Amathus was a rich and densely populated kingdom with a flourishing agriculture (grain and sheep) and copper mines situated very close to the northeast <a href="Tenta%2C%20Cyprus">Kalavasos</a>.

About 385-380 BC, the philhellene <a href="Evagoras%20I">Evagoras</a> of Salamis was similarly opposed by Amathus, allied with <a href="Citium">Citium</a> and <a href="Soli%2C%20Cyprus">Soli</a>; and even after <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander</a> the city resisted annexation, and was bound over to give hostages to <a href="Seleucus%20I%20Nicator">Seleucus</a>. Its political importance was now ended but its temple of <a href="Adonis">Adonis</a> and <a href="Amathusia">Aphrodite Amathusia</a> remained famous in <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman times</a>. The epithet "Amathusia" in Roman poetry often means little more than "Cypriote," but attesting to the fame of the city.

From the 4th century BC the pedestals of two sculptures donated by the last Basileus of Amathous, Androkles, representing his two sons, Orestheus and Andragoras, have survived. Their inscriptions are in both Eteozypric and Greek languages.

The decline of Amathous is often measured by the Ptolemaic gifts to <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, where Amathous donated only 40 drachmas in 170-160 BC, but Kition and Salamis gave 208, Kourion 172, and Paphos 100. However, this figure contradicts the archaeologic evidence of new buildings in this period including a balneion, a bath, a gymnasium, as well as fortifications of the Acropolis, including a new tower. However, the port of Paphos lost traffic compared to Amathous in the Ptolemaic period, an indication that Paphos as the capital of the island perhaps offered fewer drachmas than the other cities for different reasons, like Amathous.

In the Roman era Amathus became the capital of one of the four administrative regions of Cyprus.

A Roman temple was built in the 1st century AD on top of the Hellenistic predecessor. The temple facilities remained so important in Roman times that 'Amathusia' was used as a synonym for 'Cypriot'.

Later, in the 4th century AD, Amasus became the see of a Christian bishop and continued to flourish until the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> period. Of its bishops, Heliodorus was at the <a href="Council%20of%20Chalcedon">Council of Chalcedon</a> in 451 and Alexander at the <a href="Second%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">Second Council of Nicaea</a> in 787. In the late 6th century, Saint Ioannis Eleimonas (John the Charitable), protector of the <a href="Knights%20of%20St.%20John">Knights of St. John</a>, was born in Amathus and after 614 sent Theodorus, bishop of Amathus, to Jerusalem to ransom some slaves.

Today, Amathus is a see of the <a href="Church%20of%20Cyprus">Church of Cyprus</a> and is also listed (under the name "Amathus in Cypro", to distinguish it from "<a href="Amathus%2C%20Transjordan">Amathus in Transjordan</a>") as a <a href="titular%20see">titular see</a> by the Catholic Church, which however, in line with the practice adopted after the <a href="Second%20Vatican%20Council">Second Vatican Council</a>, has made no appointments to the bishopric since the death of the last <a href="Latin%20Church">Latin</a> <a href="titular%20bishop">titular bishop</a> in 1984.

<a href="Anastasius%20Sinaita">Anastasius Sinaita</a>, the famous 7th-century prolific monk of <a href="Saint%20Catherine%27s%20Monastery">Saint Catherine's Monastery</a>, was born here. It is thought that he left Cyprus after the 649 Arab conquest of the island, setting out for the Holy Land, and eventually becoming a monk on Sinai.

Amathus declined and was already almost deserted when <a href="Richard%20I%20of%20England">Richard Plantagenet</a> won Cyprus by a victory there over <a href="Isaac%20Comnenus%20of%20Cyprus">Isaac Comnenus</a> in 1191. The tombs were plundered and the stones from the beautiful edifices were brought to <a href="Limassol">Limassol</a> to be used for new constructions. Much later, in 1869, a great number of blocks of stone from Amathus were used for the construction of the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. A ruined <a href="Byzantian%20Empire">Byzantine</a> church marks its site.

A new settlement close to Amathus but further inland, Agios Tychonas, is named after the bishop Saint <a href="Tychon%20of%20Amathus">Tychon of Amathus</a>. The site of the ruins is within the borders of this village, though the expansion of the Limassol tourist area has threatened the ruins: it is speculated that some of the hotels are on top of the Amathus necropolis.

The city had vanished, except for fragments of wall and of a great stone urn on the acropolis, dating from the 6th century BC of which a similar vessel was taken to the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20du%20Louvre">Musée du Louvre</a> in 1867. It is tall and weighs 14 tons. It was made from a single piece of stone and has four curved handles carved with bulls. In the 1870s, <a href="Luigi%20Palma%20di%20Cesnola">Luigi Palma di Cesnola</a> excavated the <a href="necropolis">necropolis</a> of Amathus, as elsewhere in Cyprus, enriching the early collections of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>; some objects went to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>. More modern archaeological joint Cypriote-French excavations started in 1980 and still continue. The Acropolis, the Temple of Aphrodite, the agora, the city’s walls, the <a href="basilica">basilica</a> and the port have all been excavated.

Further archaeological objects found during the excavations are preserved at both the Cyprus Museum in Nicosia and the Limassol District Archaeological Museum.
In the agora there are marble columns decorated with spirals and a huge paved squares. On the coastal side of the city there is an Early Christian basilica with mosaic floors decorated with semi-precious stones. Further, near the terraced road leading to the Temple, situated on the top of the cliff, several houses built in a row dating to the Hellenistic period have been discovered. At the east and west extremes of the city the two acropoleis are situated where a number of tombs have been found, many of which are intact.

Two small sanctuaries, with terracotta votive offerings of Graeco-Phoenician age, lie not far off, but the location of the great shrines of Adonis and Aphrodite have not been identified (M. Ohnefalsch-Richter, "Kypros," i. ch.1).

Alphons

Alphons (Latinized "Alphonsus, Adelphonsus, Adefonsus") is a male given name recorded from the 8th century (<a href="Alfonso%20I%20of%20Asturias">Alfonso I of Asturias</a>, r. 739-757) in the Christian successor states of the <a href="Visigothic%20kingdom">Visigothic kingdom</a> in the <a href="Iberian%20peninsula">Iberian peninsula</a>. In the later medieval period it became a standard name in the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Spain">Hispanic</a> and <a href="kingdom%20of%20Portugal">Portuguese</a> royal families.

It is derived from a <a href="Gothic%20name">Gothic name</a>, or a conflation of several Gothic names; from "*Aþalfuns", composed of the elements "<a href="a%C3%BEal">aþal</a>" "noble" and "funs" "eager, brave, ready", and perhaps influenced by names such as "*Alafuns", "*Adefuns" and "*<a href="Ildefonsus">Hildefuns</a>".
It is recorded as "Adefonsus" in the 9th and 10th century, 
and as "Adelfonsus", "Adelphonsus" in the 10th to 11th. The reduced form "Alfonso" is recorded in the late 9th century, and the Portuguese form "Afonso" from the early 11th.

Variants of the name include: "Alfonso" (Spanish and Italian), "Alfons" (Dutch, German, Catalan, Polish and Scandinavian), "Afonso" (<a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>), "<a href="Alphonse%20%28given%20name%29">Alphonse</a>", "Alfonse" (Italian, French and English), etc.









"Alphonse", "Alphonso", "Alfonso" is occasionally seen as a surname derived from the given name, the latter descending from <a href="Asturias">Asturias</a> and <a href="Cantabria">Cantabria</a>.

Amati

Amati is the last name of a family of <a href="Italy">Italian</a> <a href="violin">violin</a> makers, who lived at <a href="Cremona">Cremona</a> from about 1538 to 1740. Their importance is considered equal to those of the <a href="Carlo%20Bergonzi%20%28luthier%29">Bergonzi</a>, <a href="Guarneri">Guarneri</a> and <a href="Stradivarius">Stradivari</a> families. Today, violins created by Nicolò Amati are valued at around $600,000.

Andrea Amati () designed and created the violin, viola and cello known as the "violin family". He standardized the basic form, shape, size, materials and method of construction. Makers from nearby <a href="Brescia">Brescia</a> experimented, such as Gasparo da Salò, Micheli, Zanetto and Pellegrino, but it was Andrea Amati in Cremona, Italy, who gave the modern violin family their definitive profile.

The first violin was ordered by <a href="Lorenzo%20De%20Medici">Lorenzo de' Medici</a> in 1555. His letter to Amati stated the instrument was to be "made of the highest quality materials like that of a lute, but simple to play". The first violin was intended to be used by illiterate musicians, so the design was simple and it was easy to play. What became of this first violin is not known. A number of his instruments survived for some time, dating between 1538 (Amati made the first Cello called "The King" in 1538 [1]) and 1574. The largest number these are from 1560, a set for an entire orchestra of 38 ordered by <a href="Catherine%20De%20Medici">Catherine de Médicis</a> the regent queen of France and bore hand painted royal French decorations in gold including the motto and coat of arms of her son <a href="Charles%20IX%20of%20France">Charles IX of France</a>. Of these 38 instruments ordered, Amati created violins of two sizes, violas of two sizes and large-sized cellos. They were in use until the French revolution of 1789 and only 14 of these instruments survived. His work is marked by selection of the finest materials, great elegance in execution, soft clear amber, soft translucent varnish, and an in depth use of acoustic and geometrical principles in design.
Andrea Amati was succeeded by his sons Antonio Amati (–1607) and Girolamo Amati (–1630). "The Brothers Amati", as they were known, implemented far-reaching innovations in design, including the perfection of the shape of the <a href="f-holes">f-holes</a>. They are also thought to have pioneered the modern alto format of <a href="viola">viola</a>, in contrast to older tenor violas, but the widespread belief that they were the first ones to do so is incorrect given that <a href="Gasparo%20da%20Salo">Gasparo da Salo</a> made violas ranging from altos of 39 cm to tenors of 44.7 cm.

Nicolò Amati (December 3, 1596April 12, 1684) was the son of Girolamo Amati. He was the most eminent of the family. He improved the model adopted by the rest of the Amatis and produced instruments capable of yielding greater power of <a href="timbre">tone</a>. His pattern was unusually small, but he also made a wider model now known as the "Grand Amati", which have become his most sought-after violins.

Of his pupils, the most famous were <a href="Antonio%20Stradivari">Antonio Stradivari</a> and <a href="Andrea%20Guarneri">Andrea Guarneri</a>, the first of the Guarneri family of violin makers. (There is much controversy regarding the apprenticeship of Antonio Stradivari. While the label on Stradivari's first known violin states that he was a pupil of Amati, the validity of his statement is questioned.)

The last maker of the family was Nicolò's son, Girolamo Amati, known as Hieronymus II (February 26, 1649February 21, 1740). Although he improved on the arching of his father's instruments, by and large they are inferior and no match for the greatest maker of his day, Antonio Stradivari.

Instruments in the UK include Andrea Amati violins from the set delivered to <a href="Charles%20IX%20of%20France">Charles IX of France</a> in 1564.

Amazons

In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, the Amazons (, ', singular , ') were a tribe of women warriors. <a href="Apollonius%20Rhodius">Apollonius Rhodius</a>, at <a href="Argonautica">Argonautica</a>, mentions that Amazons were the daughters of <a href="Ares">Ares</a> and <a href="Harmonia%20%28mythology%29">Harmonia</a> (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.

<a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> and <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> place them on the banks of the <a href="Thermodon">Thermodon</a>, while <a href="Diodorus">Diodorus</a> giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas, states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya. These Amazons started from <a href="Ancient%20Libya">Libya</a> passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the <a href="Ca%C3%AFcus">Caïcus</a> in <a href="Aeolis">Aeolis</a>, near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established <a href="Mitylene">Mitylene</a> a little way beyond the Caïcus. <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>, at <a href="Prometheus%20Bound">Prometheus Bound</a>, places the original home of the Amazons in the country about <a href="Lake%20Maeotis">Lake Maeotis</a> and they later moved to <a href="Themiscyra%20%28Pontus%29">Themiscyra</a> on the Thermodon. <a href="Homer">Homer</a> tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near <a href="Lycia">Lycia</a>.

Notable queens of the Amazons are <a href="Penthesilea">Penthesilea</a>, who participated in the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>, and her sister <a href="Hippolyta">Hippolyta</a>, whose magical girdle, given to her by her father <a href="Ares">Ares</a>, was the object of one of the <a href="labours%20of%20Heracles">labours of Heracles</a>. <a href="Diodorus">Diodorus</a> mentions that the Amazons traveled from Libya under Queen <a href="Myrina%20%28mythology%29">Myrina</a>. Amazon warriors were often depicted in battle with Greek warriors in <a href="amazonomachy">amazonomachies</a> in classical art.

The <a href="Scythian">Scythian</a> women may have inspired the myth. From the <a href="early%20modern%20period">early modern period</a>, their name has become a term for female warriors in general. Amazons were said to have founded the cities and temples of Smyrna, Sinope, Cyme, Gryne, Ephesus, Pitania, Magnesia, Clete, Pygela, Latoreria and Amastris; according to legend, the Amazons also invented the <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a>.

<a href="Palaephatus">Palaephatus</a>, who was trying to rationalize the Greek myths in his work "On Unbelievable Tales" or "On Incredible Tales" (), stated that the Amazons most probably were men mistaken for women by their enemies because they wore clothing which reached their feet, tied up their hair in headbands and shaved their beards, and also, since they did not exist during his time, most probably they did nοt exist in the past either.

The origin of the word is uncertain. It may be derived from an <a href="Iranian%20peoples">Iranian</a> <a href="ethnonym">ethnonym</a> "*ha-mazan-" "warriors", a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in <a href="Hesychius%20of%20Alexandria">Hesychius of Alexandria</a>'s gloss (""": 'to make war' in Persian"), where it appears together with the <a href="Indo-Iranian%20languages">Indo-Iranian</a> root "*kar-" "make" (from which <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> "<a href="karma">karma</a>" is also derived).

It may also be derived from "" "manless, without husbands" (<a href="privative%20a">"a-" privative</a> and a derivation of "<a href="Man%20%28word%29">*man-</a>" also found in Slavic "muzh") has been proposed, an explanation deemed "unlikely" by <a href="Hjalmar%20Frisk">Hjalmar Frisk</a>. 19th century scholarship also connected the term to the ethnonym <a href="Amazigh">Amazigh</a>. A further explanation proposes Iranian *"ama-janah" "virility-killing" as source.

Among Classical Greeks, "amazon" was given a <a href="False%20etymology">folk etymology</a> as originating from ' () and ' (), "without <a href="breast">breast</a>", connected with an <a href="etiology">etiological</a> tradition once claimed by <a href="Justin%20%28historian%29">Marcus Justinus</a> who alleged that Amazons had their right <a href="mastectomy">breast cut off</a> or <a href="breast%20ironing">burnt out</a>. There is no indication of such a practice in ancient works of art, in which the Amazons are always represented with both breasts, although one is frequently covered. Adrienne Mayor suggests the origin of this myth was due to the word's etymology.

Greeks also used some epithets for them. Herodotus used the "Androktones" (, singular , ') ("killers of men") and "Androleteirai" (, singular , ') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"), in the <a href="Iliad">Iliad</a> they are also called "Antianeirai" (, singular , "") ("those who fight like men") and Aeschylus in his work, Prometheus Bound, used the "styganor" () ("those who loathe all men").

<a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> and <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> placed them on the banks of the <a href="Thermodon">Thermodon</a> and <a href="Themiscyra%20%28Pontus%29">Themiscyra</a>. Herodotus also mentions that some Amazons lived at Scythia because after the Greeks defeated the Amazons in battle, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them, then these Amazons landed at Scythian lands. Strabo, mention that the original home of the Amazons were in Themiscyra and the plains about Thermodon and the mountains that lie above them, but later they were driven out of these places and during his time they are said to live in the mountains above <a href="Caucasian%20Albania">Caucasian Albania</a> (should not be confused with the modern <a href="Albania">Albania</a>), but he also states that some others, among them <a href="Metrodorus%20of%20Scepsis">Metrodorus of Scepsis</a> and <a href="Hypsicrates">Hypsicrates</a>, say that after Themiscyra, the Amazons traveled and lived on the borders of the Gargarians, in the northerly foothills of those parts of the <a href="Caucasian%20Mountains">Caucasian Mountains</a> which are called Ceraunian.
<a href="Diodorus">Diodorus</a> giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya. These Amazons started from <a href="Ancient%20Libya">Libya</a> passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the <a href="Ca%C3%AFcus">Caïcus</a> in <a href="Aeolis">Aeolis</a>, near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established <a href="Mitylene">Mitylene</a> a little way beyond the Caïcus.
<a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>, at <a href="Prometheus%20Bound">Prometheus Bound</a>, places the original home of the Amazons in the country about <a href="Lake%20Maeotis">Lake Maeotis</a> and they later moved to <a href="Themiscyra%20%28Pontus%29">Themiscyra</a> on the Thermodon. 
According to <a href="Pseudo-Plutarch">Pseudo-Plutarch</a>, the Amazons lived in and about the Tanais () river (modern <a href="Don%20River%20%28Russia%29">Don river</a>), formerly called the Amazonian or Amazon () river, because the Amazons bathed themselves therein. The Amazons later moved to <a href="Themiscyra%20%28mythology%29">Themiscyra</a> (modern <a href="Terme">Terme</a>) on the River <a href="Thermodon">Thermodon</a> (the Terme river in northern Turkey).
<a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, mentions that the campaign(s) of <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a> and <a href="Theseus">Theseus</a> against the Amazons was at <a href="Euxine%20Sea">Euxine Sea</a> (modern Black Sea). 
<a href="Homer">Homer</a> tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near <a href="Lycia">Lycia</a>.

The Amazons were supposed to have founded many towns, amongst them <a href="Smyrna">Smyrna</a>, <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a>, <a href="Cyme%20%28Aeolis%29">Cyme</a>, <a href="Myrina%20%28Aeolis%29">Myrina</a>, <a href="Sinop%2C%20Turkey">Sinope</a>, <a href="Paphos">Paphos</a>, <a href="Mitylene">Mitylene</a>. At <a href="Patmos">Patmos</a> there was a place called Amazonium. Also, on the island of <a href="Lemnos">Lemnos</a>, there was another Myrina. The cities of Myrina had this name after the amazon <a href="Myrina%20%28mythology%29">Myrina</a>.

<a href="Apollonius%20Rhodius">Apollonius Rhodius</a>, at <a href="Argonautica">Argonautica</a>, mentions that at Thermodon the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians (), in another the Lycastians (), and in another the Chadesians ().

Greeks also used epithets for them. Herodotus used the "Androktones" (, singular , ') ("killers/slayers of men") and "Androleteirai" (, singular , ') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"), in the <a href="Iliad">Iliad</a> they are also called "Antianeirai" (, singular , "") ("those who fight like men") and Aeschylus used the "Steganor" () ("those who loathe all men").

<a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> stated that in the Scythian language they were called "Oiorpata", oior means "man", and pata means "to slay".

In some versions of the myth, no men were permitted to have sexual encounters or reside in Amazon country; but once a year, in order to prevent their race from dying out, they visited the <a href="Gargareans">Gargareans</a>, a neighbouring tribe.

<a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>, giving credits to <a href="Metrodorus%20of%20Scepsis">Metrodorus of Scepsis</a> and <a href="Hypsicrates">Hypsicrates</a>, mentions that at his time the Amazons were believed to live on the borders of the <a href="Gargareans">Gargareans</a>. There were two special months in the spring in which they would go up into the neighboring mountain which separates them and the Gargareans. The Gargareans also, in accordance with an ancient custom, would go there to offer sacrifice with the Amazons and also to have intercourse with them for the sake of begetting children. They did this in secrecy and darkness, any Gargareans at random with any Amazon, and after making them pregnant they would send them away. Any females that were born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but the males would be taken to the Gargareans to be brought up; and each Gargareans to whom a child is brought would adopt the child as his own, regarding the child as his son because of his uncertainty. He also stated that the Gargarians went up from Themiscyra into this region with the Amazons, then, in company with some Thracians and Euboeans who had wandered thus far, waged war against them. They later ended the war against the Amazons and made a compact that they should have dealings with one another only in the matter of children, and that each people should live independent of the other.
In addition, he states that the right breasts of all Amazons are seared when they are infants, so that they can easily use their right arm for every needed purpose, and especially that of throwing the javelin and use the bow.

Herodotus mentions that when Greeks defeated the Amazons at war, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them. But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the Scythians, there they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they thought that they were men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should do. If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first. The men were not able to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned Scythian.

<a href="Apollonius%20Rhodius">Apollonius Rhodius</a>, at <a href="Argonautica">Argonautica</a>, mentions that Amazons were the daughters of <a href="Ares">Ares</a> and <a href="Harmonia%20%28mythology%29">Harmonia</a> (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war. According to him, the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians (), in another the Lycastians (), and in another the Chadesians (). Also, he mention that on an island, the Queens of the Amazons, Otrere () and Antiope (), built a marble temple of Ares. On this desert island there were ravening birds, which in countless numbers haunt it. <a href="Argonauts">Argonauts</a> passed by Themiscyra on their journey to <a href="Colchis">Colchis</a>. Zeus sent <a href="Boreas%20%28god%29">Boreas</a> (the North Wind), and with his help the Argonauts stood out from the shore near Themiscyra where the Themiscyreian Amazons were arming for battle.

The King <a href="Iobates">Iobates</a> sent <a href="Bellerophon">Bellerophon</a> against Amazons, hoping that they would kill him, but Bellerophon killed them all.

The Amazons appear in <a href="Greek%20art">Greek art</a> of the <a href="Archaic%20Greece">Archaic period</a> and in connection with several Greek legends. The tomb of <a href="Myrine">Myrine</a> is mentioned in the "Iliad"; later interpretation made of her an Amazon: according to <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus</a>, 

According to Diodorus, the Amazons under the rule of Queen Myrina, invaded the lands of the <a href="Atlantis">Atlantians</a>. Amazons defeated the army of the Atlantian city of Cerne, treated the captives savagely, killed all the men, led into slavery the children and women, and razed the city. When the terrible fate of the inhabitants of Cerne became known among the other Atlantians, they were struck with terror, surrendered their cities on terms of capitulation and announced that they would do whatever should be commanded them. Queen Myrina bearing herself honourably towards the Atlantians, established friendship with them and founded a city to bear her name in place of the city of Cerne which had been razed; and in it she settled both the captives and any native who so desired. Atlantians presented her with magnificent presents and by public decree voted to her notable honours, and she in return accepted their courtesy and in addition promised that she would show kindness to their nation. Diodorus also mentions that the Amazons of Queen Myrina used the skins of gigantic snakes, from Libya, to protect themselves at battle. Later Queen Myrine led her Amazons to victory against the <a href="Gorgons">Gorgons</a>. After the battle against the Gorgons, Myrina accorded a funeral to her fallen comrades on three pyres and raised up three great heaps of earth as tombs, which are called "Amazon Mounds" ().

One of the <a href="Labours%20of%20Hercules">tasks imposed upon Hercules</a> by <a href="Eurystheus">Eurystheus</a> was to obtain possession of the <a href="girdle">girdle</a> of the Amazonian queen <a href="Hippolyta">Hippolyta</a>. He was accompanied by his friend <a href="Theseus">Theseus</a>, who carried off the princess <a href="Antiope%20%28Amazon%29">Antiope</a>, sister of Hippolyta, an incident which led to a retaliatory invasion of <a href="Attica">Attica</a>, in which Antiope perished fighting by the side of Theseus. In some versions, however, Theseus marries Hippolyta and in others, he marries Antiope and she does not die; by this marriage with the Amazon Theseus had a son <a href="Hippolytus%20%28son%20of%20Theseus%29">Hippolytus</a>. 
In another version of this myth, Theseus made this voyage on his own account, after the time of Heracles.
The battle between the Athenians and Amazons is often commemorated in an entire genre of art, <a href="amazonomachy">amazonomachy</a>, in marble <a href="bas-relief">bas-relief</a>s such as from the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> or the sculptures of the <a href="Mausoleum%20of%20Halicarnassus">Mausoleum of Halicarnassus</a>.
<a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, in his work <a href="Parallel%20Lives">Parallel Lives</a>-The Life of Theseus, mentions that Bion said that the Amazons, were naturally friendly to men, and did not fly from Theseus when he touched upon their coasts.

Amazons attacked the <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a>ns, who were assisted by <a href="Priam">Priam</a>, then a young man. In his later years, however, towards the end of the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>, his old opponents took his side against the Greeks under their queen <a href="Penthesilea">Penthesilea</a> "of <a href="Thrace">Thracian</a> birth", who was slain by <a href="Achilles">Achilles</a>.

The God <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a> and his entourage fought the amazons at <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a>, the amazons fled to <a href="Samos">Samos</a>, but Dionysus pursued them and at Samos he killed a great number of them on a spot which was, from that occurrence, called Panaema (), which means blood-soaked field. In another myth Dionysus united with the Amazons to fight against <a href="Cronus">Cronus</a> and the <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titans</a>.

The Amazons are also said to have undertaken an expedition against the <a href="Snake%20Island%20%28Black%20Sea%29">island of Leuke</a>, at the mouth of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>, where the ashes of Achilles had been deposited by <a href="Thetis">Thetis</a>. The ghost of the dead hero appeared and so terrified the horses, that they threw and trampled upon the invaders, who were forced to retire. <a href="Pompey">Pompey</a> is said to have found them in the army of <a href="Mithridates%20VI%20of%20Pontus">Mithridates</a>.

They are heard of in the time of Alexander, when some of the king's biographers make mention of Amazon Queen <a href="Thalestris">Thalestris</a> visiting him and becoming a mother by him (the story is known from the "<a href="Alexander%20Romance">Alexander Romance</a>"). However, several other biographers of Alexander dispute the claim, including the highly regarded <a href="secondary%20source">secondary source</a>, <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>. In his writing he makes mention of a moment when Alexander's secondary naval commander, <a href="Onesicritus">Onesicritus</a>, was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King <a href="Lysimachus">Lysimachus</a> of <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> who was on the original expedition: the king smiled at him and said "And where was I, then?"

The Roman writer <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s characterization of the <a href="Volsci">Volsci</a>an warrior maiden <a href="Camilla%20%28mythology%29">Camilla</a> in the "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>" borrows heavily from the myth of the Amazons.

<a href="Jordanes">Jordanes</a>' "<a href="Getica">Getica</a>" (), purporting to give the earliest history of the <a href="Goths">Goths</a>, relates that the Goths' ancestors, descendants of <a href="Magog%20%28Bible%29">Magog</a>, originally dwelt within Scythia, on the <a href="Sea%20of%20Azov">Sea of Azov</a> between the <a href="Dnieper">Dnieper</a> and <a href="Don%20River%20%28Russia%29">Don Rivers</a>. After a few centuries, following an incident where the Goths' women successfully fended off a raid by a neighboring tribe, while the menfolk were off campaigning against Pharaoh <a href="Vesosis">Vesosis</a>, the women formed their own army under <a href="Marpesia">Marpesia</a> and crossed the Don, invading Asia. Her sister <a href="Lampedo">Lampedo</a> remained in Europe to guard the homeland. They procreated with men once a year. These Amazons conquered Armenia, Syria, and all of Asia Minor, even reaching <a href="Ionia">Ionia</a> and <a href="Aeolis">Aeolia</a>, holding this vast territory for 100 years. Jordanes also mentions that they fought with Hercules, and in the Trojan War, and that a smaller contingent of them endured in the Caucasus Mountains until the time of Alexander. He mentions by name the Queens Menalippe, Hippolyta, and Penthesilea.

In the Grottaferrata Version of "<a href="Digenes%20Akritas">Digenes Akritas</a>", the twelfth century medieval epic of Basil, the Greek-Syrian knight of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> frontier, the hero battles with and kills the female warrior Maximo.


There are several (conflicting) lists of names of Amazons.


Other names of Amazons from various sources include:


According to ancient sources (<a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, <a href="Theseus">Theseus</a>, <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a>), Amazon tombs could be found frequently throughout what was once known as the ancient Greek world. Some are found in <a href="Megara">Megara</a>, <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, <a href="Chaeronea">Chaeronea</a>, <a href="Chalcis">Chalcis</a>, <a href="Thessaly">Thessaly</a> at <a href="Skotousa">Skotousa</a>, in <a href="Cynoscephalae">Cynoscephalae</a>, and statues of Amazons are all over Greece.

At both Chalcis and Athens, <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> tells us that there was an Amazoneum or shrine of Amazons that implied the presence of both tombs and cult. At the entrance of Athens there was a monument to the Amazon <a href="Antiope%20%28Amazon%29">Antiope</a>. On the day before the Thesea at Athens there were annual sacrifices to the Amazons. In historical times Greek maidens of <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a> performed an annual circular dance with weapons and shields that had been established by <a href="Hippolyta">Hippolyta</a> and her Amazons. They had initially set up wooden statues of <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a>, a "bretas" (<a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a>, (fl.c.160): "Description of Greece", Book I: Attica).

In works of art, battles between Amazons and Greeks are placed on the same level as – and often associated with – battles of Greeks and <a href="centaur">centaur</a>s. The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings. Amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of Scythian or Sarmatian horsemen. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly in the shape of a crescent, called "pelta", and in early art a helmet. The model in the Greek mind had apparently been the goddess <a href="Athena">Athena</a>. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly <a href="Iran">Persian</a> – that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the "kidaris". They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot.
This depiction of Amazons demonstrates just how closely, in the Greek mind, the Amazons were linked to the Scythians. Their manner of dress has been noted to bear a striking similarity to the traditional dress of nomadic peoples from the Crimea to Mongolia. Amazons were described by Herodotus as wearing trousers and having tall stiff caps. The double-sided axe was the most emblematic of their weapons. Amazons can also be identified in vase paintings by the fact that they are wearing one earring. The battle between Theseus and the Amazons (<a href="Amazonomachy">Amazonomachy</a>) is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples (e.g. the reliefs from the frieze of the <a href="Temple%20of%20Apollo%20at%20Bassae">Temple of Apollo at Bassae</a>, now in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>), vases and sarcophagus reliefs; at <a href="Athens">Athens</a> it was represented on the shield of the statue of <a href="Athena%20Parthenos">Athena Parthenos</a>, on wall-paintings in the <a href="Theseum">Theseum</a> and in the "<a href="Stoa%20Poikile">Stoa Poikile</a>". There were also three standard <a href="Amazon%20statue%20types">Amazon statue types</a>.
Later in the <a href="The%20Renaissance">Renaissance</a>, as Amazon myth evolved, artists started to depict warrior women in a new light. <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth</a> was often thought of as an Amazon-like warrior during her reign and can be seen in many paintings as such. Though, as explained in "Divinia Viagro" by Winfried Schleiner, Celeste T. Wright "has given a detailed account of the bad press Amazons had in the Renaissance (with respect to their unwomanly conduct and Scythian cruelty). She notes that she has not found any Elizabethans comparing the queen directly to an Amazon, and suggests that they might have hesitated to do so because of the association of Amazons with enfranchisement of women, which was considered contemptible."

<a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Peter Paul Ruben</a> and <a href="Jan%20Brueghel%20the%20Elder">Jan Brueghel</a> depicted the Battle of the Amazons around 1598, showing many attributes of Renaissance-styled paintings. Amazons also appear in the <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a> period in another painting titled "Battle of the Amazons" by <a href="Johann%20Georg%20Platzer">Johann Georg Platzer</a>. As a part of the Romantic period revival, German artist <a href="Anselm%20Feuerbach">Anselm Feuerbach</a> painted the Amazons as well. His paintings “engendered all the aspirations of the Romantics: their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world; their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul; their search for a national identity, and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the Germanic nation; finally, their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past.”

<a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men". Moreover, said Herodotus, "No girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle". In the story related by Herodotus, a group of Amazons was blown across the <a href="Sea%20of%20Azov">Maeotian Lake</a> (the <a href="Sea%20of%20Azov">Sea of Azov</a>) into <a href="Scythia">Scythia</a> near the cliff region (today's southeastern <a href="Crimean%20Peninsula">Crimea</a>). After learning the Scythian language, they agreed to marry Scythian men, on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of Scythian women. According to Herodotus, this band moved toward the northeast, settling beyond the <a href="Don%20River%20%28Russia%29">Tanais</a> (<a href="Don%20River%20%28Russia%29">Don</a>) river, and became the ancestors of the <a href="Sarmatians">Sauromatians</a>. According to Herodotus, the <a href="Sarmatians">Sarmatians</a> fought with the Scythians against <a href="Darius%20the%20Great">Darius the Great</a> in the 5th century BC.

Hippocrates describes them as: "They have no right breasts...for while they are yet babies their mothers make red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it, so that its growth is arrested, and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm."

Amazons came to play a role in <a href="Roman%20historiography">Roman historiography</a>. Caesar reminded the Senate of the conquest of large parts of Asia by <a href="Semiramis">Semiramis</a> and the Amazons. Successful Amazon raids against Lycia and Cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by Lydian cavalry against the invaders (<a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> 5.504; Nicholas Damascenus). <a href="Gnaeus%20Pompeius%20Trogus">Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus</a> pays particularly detailed attention to the Amazons. The story of the Amazons as deriving from a Cappadocian colony of two Scythian princes Ylinos and Scolopetos is due to him. <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> records some surprising facts pointing to the valley of the <a href="Terme%20River">Terme River</a> as possibly being their home: a mountain named for them (the modern Mason Dagi), as well as a settlement Amazonium; Herodotus (VI.86) first mentions their capital <a href="Themiscyra%20%28Pontus%29">Themiscyra</a>, which Pliny locates near the Terme. <a href="Philostratus">Philostratus</a> places the Amazons in the <a href="Taurus%20Mountains">Taurus Mountains</a>. <a href="Ammianus%20Marcellinus">Ammianus</a> places them east of <a href="Tanais">Tanais</a>, as neighbouring the <a href="Alans">Alans</a>. <a href="Procopius">Procopius</a> places them in the Caucasus. <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a> ("<a href="Bibliotheca%20historica">Bibliotheca historica</a>" III, chapter 52) mentioned that besides <a href="Pontus%20%28region%29">Pontus</a> Amazons existed much older race (at that time entirely disappeared) of Amazons from western <a href="Ancient%20Libya">Libya</a>, and retells their mythological story which includes <a href="Atlantis">Atlantis</a> and Greek mythology.

Although Strabo shows skepticism as to their historicity, the Amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout Late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers speak of the Amazons as of a real people. <a href="Gaius%20Julius%20Solinus">Solinus</a> embraces the account of Pliny. Under <a href="Aurelianus">Aurelianus</a>, captured <a href="Goths">Gothic</a> women were identified as Amazons (<a href="Claudian">Claudian</a>us). The account of <a href="Justin%20%28historian%29">Justinus</a> was influential, and was used as a source by <a href="Paulus%20Orosius">Orosius</a> who continued to be read during the European Middle Ages. Medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, <a href="Adam%20of%20Bremen">Adam of Bremen</a> placing them at the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> and <a href="Paulus%20Diaconus">Paulus Diaconus</a> in the heart of Germania.

Amazons continued to be discussed by authors of the European Renaissance, and with the <a href="Age%20of%20Exploration">Age of Exploration</a>, they were located in ever more remote areas. In 1542, <a href="Francisco%20de%20Orellana">Francisco de Orellana</a> reached the <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon River</a> ("Amazonas" in Spanish), naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have encountered and fought on the <a href="Nhamund%C3%A1%20River">Nhamundá River</a>, a tributary of the Amazon. Afterwards the whole basin and region of the Amazon ("Amazônia" in Portuguese, "Amazonía" in Spanish) were named after the river. Amazons also figure in the accounts of both <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> and <a href="Walter%20Raleigh">Walter Raleigh</a>. Famous medieval traveller <a href="John%20Mandeville">John Mandeville</a> mentions them in his book:

Medieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the <a href="Corded%20Ware%20culture">battle-axe</a>. This is probably related to the "<a href="sagaris">sagaris</a>", an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also <a href="Thracian%20tomb%20of%20Aleksandrovo%20kurgan">Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan</a>). <a href="Paulus%20Hector%20Mair">Paulus Hector Mair</a> expresses astonishment that such a "manly weapon" should have been invented by a "tribe of women", but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, <a href="Johannes%20Aventinus">Johannes Aventinus</a>.

<a href="Ludovico%20Ariosto">Ariosto</a>'s "<a href="Orlando%20Furioso">Orlando Furioso</a>" contains a country of warrior women, ruled by Queen Orontea; the epic describes an origin much like that in Greek myth, in that the women, abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers, rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced, to prevent them from regaining power. The Amazons and Queen Hippolyta are also referenced in <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>'s "<a href="The%20Canterbury%20Tales">Canterbury Tales</a>" in "<a href="The%20Knight%27s%20Tale">The Knight's Tale</a>".

<a href="Classics">Classicist</a> Peter Walcot wrote, "Wherever the Amazons are located by the Greeks, whether it is somewhere along the Black Sea in the distant north-east, or in Libya in the furthest south, it is always beyond the confines of <a href="Civilization">the civilized world</a>. The Amazons exist outside the range of normal human experience."

Nevertheless, there are various proposals for a historical nucleus of the Amazons of Greek historiography, the most obvious candidates being historical <a href="Scythia">Scythia</a> and <a href="Sarmatia">Sarmatia</a> in line with the account by <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, but some authors prefer a comparison to cultures of Asia Minor or even <a href="Minoan%20Crete">Minoan Crete</a>.

Speculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials, pointing to the possibility that some Sarmatian women may have participated in battle. These findings have led scholars to suggest that the Amazonian legend in <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> may have been "inspired by real warrior women".

Evidence of high-ranking warrior women comes from <a href="kurgan">kurgan</a>s in southern Ukraine and Russia.
David Anthony notes, "About 20% of <a href="Scythians">Scythian</a>-<a href="Sarmatian">Sarmatian</a> 'warrior graves' on the lower <a href="Don%20River%20%28Russia%29">Don</a> and lower <a href="Volga%20river">Volga</a> contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress, a phenomenon that probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons."
Up to 25% of military burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows. Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya points out that when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-<a href="hegemony">hegemony</a> in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.

Before modern archaeology uncovered some of the Scythian burials of warrior-maidens entombed under <a href="kurgan">kurgan</a>s in the region of <a href="Altai%20Mountains">Altai Mountains</a> and Sarmatia,

When <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan</a> archeology was still in its infancy, nevertheless, a theory raised in an essay regarding the Amazons contributed by <a href="Lewis%20Richard%20Farnell">Lewis Richard Farnell</a> and <a href="John%20Myres">John Myres</a> to <a href="Robert%20Ranulph%20Marett">Robert Ranulph Marett</a>'s "Anthropology and the Classics" (1908), placed their possible origins in Minoan civilization, drawing attention to overlooked similarities between the two cultures. According to Myres, the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed Amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in Minoan culture. 

<a href="Francisco%20de%20Orellana">Francisco de Orellana</a> gave the <a href="Amazon%20river">Amazon river</a> its name after reporting pitched battles with tribes of female warriors, whom he likened to the Amazons.

The city of <a href="Samsun">Samsun</a> in modern-day <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> features a recently constructed "Amazon Village" museum, created to bring attention to the legacy of the Amazons and to generate both academic interest and popular tourism. A festival is also held every year in the <a href="Terme">Terme</a> district of <a href="Samsun%20Province">Samsun Province</a> to celebrate the Amazons.

In Greece, female <a href="equestrians">equestrians</a> are also called "Amazons" ().
