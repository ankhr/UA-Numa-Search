Bison

Bison are large, <a href="even-toed%20ungulate">even-toed ungulate</a>s in the genus "Bison" within the subfamily <a href="Bovinae">Bovinae</a>.

Two <a href="extant%20taxon">extant</a> and six <a href="extinction">extinct</a> species are recognised. Of the six extinct species, five went extinct in the <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event">Quaternary extinction event</a>. "Bison palaeosinensis" evolved in the <a href="Early%20Pleistocene">Early Pleistocene</a> in <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a>, and was the evolutionary ancestor of "B. priscus" (<a href="steppe%20bison">steppe bison</a>), which was the ancestor of all other "Bison" species. From <a href="Gelasian">2 MYA</a> to <a href="6th%20millennium%20BC">6,000 BCE</a>, steppe bison ranged across the <a href="mammoth%20steppe">mammoth steppe</a>, inhabiting Europe and northern Asia with "B. schoetensacki" (woodland bison), and North America with "<a href="Bison%20antiquus">B. antiquus</a>", "<a href="Bison%20latifrons">B. latifrons</a>", and "<a href="Bison%20occidentalis">B. occidentalis</a>." The last species to go extinct, "B. occidentalis", was succeeded at <a href="30th%20century%20BC">3,000 BCE</a> by "B. bison".

Of the two surviving species, the <a href="American%20bison">American bison</a>, "B. bison", found only in North America, is the more numerous. Although generally known as a buffalo in North America, it is only distantly related to the <a href="Bubalus">true buffalo</a>. The North American species is composed of two subspecies, the <a href="Plains%20bison">Plains bison</a>, "B. b. bison", and the <a href="Wood%20bison">Wood bison</a>, "B. b. athabascae", which is the namesake of <a href="Wood%20Buffalo%20National%20Park">Wood Buffalo National Park</a> in Canada. A third subspecies, the Eastern Woodland Bison ("B. b. pennsylvanicus") is no longer considered a valid <a href="taxon">taxon</a>, being a junior synonym of "B. b. bison". References to "Woods Bison" or "Wood Bison" from the eastern United States confusingly refer to this subspecies, not "B. b. athabascae", which was not found in the region. The <a href="European%20bison">European bison</a>, "B. bonasus", or "wisent", is found in Europe and the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, reintroduced after being extinct in the wild.

While all bison species are classified in their own <a href="genus">genus</a>, they are sometimes bred with domestic cattle (genus "Bos") and produce fertile offspring called <a href="beefalo">beefalo</a> or <a href="zubron">zubron</a>.

The American bison and the European bison (Wisent) are the largest surviving terrestrial animals in North America and Europe. Bison are good swimmers and can cross rivers over half a mile (800 meters) wide. They are nomadic <a href="Grazing">grazers</a> and travel in <a href="herd">herd</a>s. The bulls leave the herds of females at two or three years of age, and join a male herd, which are generally smaller than female herds. Mature bulls rarely travel alone. Towards the end of the summer, for the reproductive season, the sexes necessarily commingle. American bison are known for living in the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a>, but formerly had a much larger range including much of the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. Both species were hunted close to <a href="extinction">extinction</a> during the 19th and 20th centuries, but have since rebounded; the Wisent owing its survival, in part, to the Chernobyl Disaster, ironically, as the <a href="Chernobyl%20Exclusion%20Zone">Chernobyl Exclusion Zone</a> has become a kind of wildlife preserve for Wisent and other rare megafauna such as the <a href="Przewalski%27s%20Horse">Przewalski's Horse</a>, though poaching has become a threat in recent years. The American Plains bison is no longer listed as <a href="endangered">endangered</a>, but this does not mean the species is secure. Genetically pure "B. b. bison" currently number only ~20,000, separated into fragmented herds—all of which require active conservation measures. The Wood bison is on the endangered species list in Canada and is listed as threatened in the United States, though there have been numerous attempts by beefalo ranchers to have it entirely removed from the <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species List</a>.

Although superficially similar, physical and behavioural differences exist between the American and European bison. The American species has 15 ribs, while the European bison has 14. The American bison has four lumbar vertebrae, while the European has five. (The difference in this case is that what would be the first lumbar vertebra has ribs attached to it in American bison and is thus counted as the 15th thoracic vertebra, compared to 14 thoracic vertebrae in wisent.) Adult American bison are less slim in build and have shorter legs. American bison tend to graze more, and <a href="Browsing%20%28herbivory%29">browse</a> less than their European relatives. Their anatomies reflect this behavioural difference; the American bison's head hangs lower than the European's. The body of the American bison is typically hairier, though its tail has less hair than that of the European bison. The horns of the European bison point through the plane of their faces, making them more adept at fighting through the interlocking of horns in the same manner as domestic cattle, unlike the American bison, which favours butting. American bison are more easily tamed than their European cousins, and breed with domestic cattle more readily.

The bovine tribe (Bovini) split about 5 to 10 million years ago into the buffalos ("<a href="Bubalus">Bubalus</a>" and "<a href="Syncerus">Syncerus</a>") and a group leading to bison and taurine cattle. Thereafter, the family lineage of bison and taurine cattle does not appear to be a straightforward "tree" structure as is often depicted in much evolution, because evidence of interbreeding and crossbreeding is seen between different species and members within this family, even many millions of years after their ancestors separated into different species. This crossbreeding was not sufficient to conflate the different species back together, but it has resulted in unexpected relationships between many members of this group, such as yak being related to American bison, when such relationships would otherwise not be apparent.

A 2003 study of mitochondrial DNA indicated four distinct maternal lineages in tribe <a href="Bovini">Bovini</a>:
However, Y chromosome analysis associated wisent and American bison. An earlier study using amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting showed a close association of wisent with American bison, and probably with the yak, but noted that the interbreeding of Bovini species made determining relationships problematic.

The "Bison" genus diverged from the lineage that led to <a href="cattle">cattle</a> ("<a href="Aurochs">Bos primigenius</a>") at the <a href="Plio-Pleistocene">Plio-Pleistocene</a> boundary in <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a>. Two <a href="extant%20taxon">extant</a> and six <a href="extinction">extinct</a> species are recognised. Of the six extinct species, five went extinct in the <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event">Quaternary extinction event</a>. Three were North American <a href="endemism">endemics</a>: "<a href="Bison%20antiquus">Bison antiquus</a>", "<a href="Bison%20latifrons">B. latifrons</a>", and "<a href="Bison%20occidentalis">B. occidentalis</a>". The fourth, "<a href="Steppe%20Wisent">B. priscus</a>" (steppe bison), ranged across <a href="steppe">steppe</a> environments from Western Europe, through Central Asia, <a href="East%20Asia">East Asia</a> including Japan, and onto North America. The fifth, "B. schoetensacki" (woodland bison), inhabited Eurasian <a href="forest">forest</a>s, extending from western Europe to the south of Siberia.

The sixth, "B. palaeosinensis", evolving in the <a href="Early%20Pleistocene">Early Pleistocene</a> in <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a>, is presumed to have been the evolutionary ancestor of "B. priscus" and all successive "Bison" lineages. The <a href="steppe%20bison">steppe bison</a> ("B. priscus") evolved from "Bison palaeosinensis" in the <a href="Early%20Pleistocene">Early Pleistocene</a>. "B. priscus" is seen clearly in the fossil record around 2 million years ago. The steppe bison spread across Eurasia, and all proceeding contemporary and successive species are believed to have derived from the steppe bison. Going extinct in 6,000 BCE, outlasted only by "<a href="Bison%20occidentalis">B. occidentalis</a>", "<a href="European%20bison">B. bonansus</a>" and "<a href="American%20bison">B. bison</a>", the steppe bison was the predominant bison pictured in the ancient cave paintings of Spain and Southern France.

The modern <a href="European%20bison">European bison</a> is likely to have arisen from the steppe bison. There is no direct fossil evidence of successive species between the steppe bison and the European bison, though there are three possible lines of ancestry pertaining to the European wisent. Past research has suggested that the European bison is descended from bison that had migrated from Asia to North America, and then back to Europe, where they crossbred with existing steppe bison. However, more recent <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> research points to an origin either form the <a href="Phenotype">phenotypically</a> and <a href="Genetic%20distance">genetically</a> similar Pleistocene woodland bison ("B. schoetensacki") or the result of an interbreeding event between the steppe bison and the <a href="aurochs">aurochs</a> ("Bos primigenius"), the ancestor of domesticated cattle, around 120,000 years ago. The possible hybrid is referred to in vernacular as the 'Higgs bison' as a hat-tip to the discovery process of the <a href="Higgs%20boson">Higgs boson</a>.

At one point, some steppe bison crossbred with the ancestors of the modern yak. After that crossbreeding, a population of steppe bison crossed the <a href="Bering%20Land%20Bridge">Bering Land Bridge</a> to North America. The steppe bison spread through the northern parts of North America and lived in Eurasia until around 11,000 years ago and North America until 4,000 to 8,000 years ago.

The Pleistocene woodland bison ("B"."schoetensacki)" evolved in the <a href="Middle%20Pleistocene">Middle Pleistocene</a> from "B. priscus", and tended to inhabit the <a href="Semi-arid%20climate%23Cold%20semi-arid%20climates">dry</a> <a href="Pinophyta">conifer</a> <a href="forest">forest</a>s and <a href="woodland">woodland</a> which lined the <a href="mammoth%20steppe">mammoth steppe</a>, occupying a range from western Europe to the south of Siberia. Although their fossil records are far rarer than their antecedent, they are thought to have existed until at least 36,000 BCE.

"<a href="Bison%20latifrons">Bison latifrons</a>" (the "giant" or "longhorn" bison) is thought to have evolved in midcontinent North America from "B. priscus", after the steppe bison crossed into North America. Giant bison ("B. latifrons") appeared in the fossil record about 120,000 years ago. "B. latifrons" was one of many species of North American megafauna that became extinct during the transition from the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> to the <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> <a href="epoch%20%28geology%29">epoch</a> (an event referred to as the Quaternary extinction event). It is thought to have disappeared some 21,000–30,000 years ago, during the late Wisconsin glaciation.

"B. latifrons" co-existed with the slightly smaller "<a href="Bison%20antiquus">B. antiquus</a>" for over 100,000 years. Their predecessor, the steppe bison appeared in the North American fossil record around 190,000 years ago. "B. latifrons" is believed to have been a more woodland-dwelling, non-herding species, while "B. antiquus" was a herding grassland-dweller, very much like its descendant "B. bison". "B. antiquus" gave rise to both "<a href="Bison%20occidentalis">B. occidentalis</a>," and later "<a href="American%20bison">B. bison</a>", the modern American bison, some 5,000 to 10,000 years ago. "B. antiquus" was the most common megafaunal species on the North American continent during much of the <a href="Late%20Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a> and is the most commonly found large animal found at the <a href="La%20Brea%20Tar%20Pits">La Brea Tar Pits</a>.

In 2016, DNA extracted from "Bison priscus" fossil remains beneath a 130,000-year-old volcanic <a href="wikt%3Aashfall">ashfall</a> in the <a href="Yukon">Yukon</a> suggested recent arrival of the species. That genetic material indicated that all American bison had a common ancestor 135,000 to 195,000 years ago, during which period the Bering Land Bridge was exposed; this hypothesis precludes an earlier arrival. The researchers sequenced mitochondrial genomes from both that specimen and from the remains of a recently discovered, estimated 120,000-year-old giant, long-horned, "B. latifrons" from Snowmass, Colorado. The genetic information also indicated that a second, Pleistocene migration of bison over the land bridge occurred 21,000 to 45,000 years ago.

During the population bottleneck, after the great slaughter of American bison during the 19th century, the number of bison remaining alive in North America declined to as low as 541. During that period, a handful of ranchers gathered remnants of the existing herds to save the species from extinction. These ranchers bred some of the bison with cattle in an effort to produce "cattleo" (today called "<a href="beefalo">beefalo</a>") Accidental crossings were also known to occur. Generally, male domestic bulls were crossed with buffalo cows, producing offspring of which only the females were fertile. The crossbred animals did not demonstrate any form of hybrid vigor, so the practice was abandoned. Wisent-American bison hybrids were briefly experimented with in Germany (and found to be fully fertile) and a herd of such animals is maintained in Russia. A herd of cattle-wisent crossbreeds (<a href="zubron">zubron</a>) is maintained in Poland. First-generation crosses do not occur naturally, requiring caesarean delivery. First-generation males are infertile. The U.S. National Bison Association has adopted a code of ethics that prohibits its members from deliberately crossbreeding bison with any other species. In the United States, many ranchers are now using DNA testing to cull the residual cattle genetics from their bison herds. The proportion of cattle DNA that has been measured in introgressed individuals and bison herds today is typically quite low, ranging from 0.56 to 1.8%.

There are also remnant purebred American bison herds on public lands in North America. Three herds are in <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>, <a href="Wind%20Cave%20National%20Park">Wind Cave National Park</a> in <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a> and <a href="Elk%20Island%20National%20Park">Elk Island National Park</a> in <a href="Alberta%2C%20Canada">Alberta, Canada</a>. In 2015 a fourth purebred herd of 350 individuals was identified on public lands in the <a href="Henry%20Mountains">Henry Mountains</a> of southern <a href="Utah">Utah</a> via genetic testing of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. This study, published in 2015, also showed the <a href="Henry%20Mountains%20bison%20herd">Henry Mountains bison herd</a> to be free of <a href="brucellosis">brucellosis</a>, a bacterial disease that was imported with non-native domestic cattle to North America.

<a href="Wallowing%20in%20animals">Wallowing</a> is a common behavior of bison. A bison wallow is a shallow depression in the soil, either wet or dry. Bison roll in these depressions, covering themselves with mud or dust. Possible explanations suggested for wallowing behavior include grooming behavior associated with moulting, male-male interaction (typically <a href="Rut%20%28mammalian%20reproduction%29">rutting</a> behavior), social behavior for group cohesion, play behavior, relief from skin irritation due to biting insects, reduction of <a href="Parasitism">ectoparasite</a> load (<a href="tick">tick</a>s and <a href="Louse">lice</a>), and thermoregulation. In the process of wallowing, bison may become infected by the fatal disease <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a>, which may occur naturally in the soil.

Bison temperament is often unpredictable. They usually appear peaceful, unconcerned, even lazy, yet they may attack anything, often without warning or apparent reason. They can move at speeds up to and cover long distances at a lumbering gallop.

Their most obvious weapons are the horns borne by both males and females, but their massive heads can be used as battering rams, effectively using the momentum produced by what is a typical weight of (can be up to 2700 lbs) moving at . The hind legs can also be used to kill or maim with devastating effect. In the words of early naturalists, they were dangerous, savage animals that feared no other animal and in prime condition could best any foe (except for wolves and brown bears).

The rutting, or mating, season lasts from June through September, with peak activity in July and August. At this time, the older bulls rejoin the herd, and fights often take place between bulls. The herd exhibits much restlessness during breeding season. The animals are belligerent, unpredictable, and most dangerous.

American bison live in river valleys, and on prairies and plains. Typical habitat is open or semiopen grasslands, as well as sagebrush, semiarid lands, and scrublands. Some lightly wooded areas are also known historically to have supported bison. They also graze in hilly or mountainous areas where the slopes are not steep. Though not particularly known as high-altitude animals, bison in the <a href="Yellowstone%20Park%20bison%20herd">Yellowstone Park bison herd</a> are frequently found at elevations above 8,000 feet and the <a href="Henry%20Mountains%20bison%20herd">Henry Mountains bison herd</a> is found on the plains around the Henry Mountains, Utah, as well as in mountain valleys of the Henry Mountains to an altitude of 10,000 feet.

European bison tend to live in lightly wooded to fully wooded areas and areas with increased shrubs and bushes, though they can also live on grasslands and plains.

Throughout most of their historical range, landowners have sought restrictions on free-ranging bison. Herds on private land are required be fenced in. In the state of Montana, free-ranging bison on public lands may be shot, due to concerns about transmission of disease to cattle and damage to public property. In 2013, Montana legislative measures concerning the bison were proposed and passed by Republicans, but opposed by Native American tribes as they impinged on sovereign tribal rights. Three such bills were vetoed by <a href="Steve%20Bullock%20%28American%20politician%29">Steve Bullock</a>, the Democratic governor of Montana. The bison's circumstances remain an issue of contention between Native American tribes and private landowners.

Bison are herbivores and eat simple foods. They generally rest during the day and graze in the mornings and the evenings. The bison's main foodstuff is grass and <a href="Cyperaceae">sedges</a>, though they will also eat any available low-lying shrubbery. In the winter, bison forage for grass under the snow. If little grass is available, they will eat the twigs of shrubs. Bison are notably better browsers than cattle, since cattle are more obligate grazers, though wood bison have also been described as "obligate grazers". Wisent tend to browse on shrubs and low-hanging trees more often than do the American bison, which prefer grass to shrubbery and trees.

Due to their size, bison have few predators. Four notable exceptions are the <a href="grey%20wolf">grey wolf</a>, <a href="human">human</a>, <a href="brown%20bear">brown bear</a>, and <a href="coyote">coyote</a>. The grey wolf generally takes down a bison while in a pack, but cases of a single wolf killing bison have been reported. <a href="Brown%20bear">Brown bear</a> also consume bison, often by driving off the pack and consuming the wolves' kill. Brown bear and coyotes also prey on bison calves. Historically and prehistorically, <a href="lion">lion</a>s, <a href="tiger">tiger</a>s, "<a href="Smilodon">Smilodon</a>", "<a href="Homotherium">Homotherium</a>", <a href="cave%20hyena">cave hyena</a>s and "<a href="Homo">Homo sp.</a>" had posed threats to bison.

For the American bison, the main cause of illness is <a href="malignant%20catarrhal%20fever">malignant catarrhal fever</a>, though <a href="brucellosis">brucellosis</a> is a serious concern in the Yellowstone Park bison herd. Bison in the <a href="Antelope%20Island%20bison%20herd">Antelope Island bison herd</a> are regularly inoculated against brucellosis, parasites, "Clostridium" infection, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, and bovine vibriosis.

The major concerns for illness in European bison are foot-and-mouth disease and balanoposthitis, which affects the male sex organs; a number of parasitic diseases have also been cited as threats. The inbreeding of the species caused by the small population plays a role in a number of genetic defects and immunity to diseases, which in turn poses greater risks to the population.

The term "buffalo" is sometimes considered to be a <a href="misnomer">misnomer</a> for this animal, as it is only distantly related to either of the two "true buffalo", the Asian <a href="water%20buffalo">water buffalo</a> and the <a href="African%20buffalo">African buffalo</a>. <a href="Samuel%20de%20Champlain">Samuel de Champlain</a> applied the term buffalo ("buffles" in French) to the bison in 1616 (published 1619), after seeing skins and a drawing shown to him by members of the <a href="Nipissing%20First%20Nation">Nipissing First Nation</a>, who said they travelled forty days (from east of Lake Huron) to trade with another nation who hunted the animals. Though "bison" might be considered more scientifically correct, as a result of standard usage, "buffalo" is also considered correct and is listed in many dictionaries as an acceptable name for American buffalo or bison. Buffalo has a much longer history than bison, which was first recorded in 1774.

Humans were almost exclusively accountable for the near-extinction of the American bison in the 1800s. At the beginning of the century, tens of millions of bison roamed North America. Humans slaughtered an estimated 50 million bison, not for sustenance but for sport, in a bid by the U.S. government to strip the <a href="Plains%20Indians">Plains Indians</a> of a vital component of their way of life. Railroads were advertising "hunting by rail", where trains encountered large herds alongside or crossing the tracks. Men aboard fired from the trains roof or windows, leaving countless animals to rot where they died. The overhunting of the bison reduced their population to hundreds. Attempts to revive the American bison have been highly successful. Farming of bison has increased their population to nearly 150,000. The American bison is, therefore, no longer considered an <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a>. The extinction of four species of bison ("B. antiquus", "B. latifrons", "B. occidentalis", and "B. priscus") was due to <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a> (see section "Evolution and genetic history").

As of July 2015, an estimated 4,900 bison lived in <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>, the largest U.S. bison population on public land. During 1983–1985 visitors experienced 33 bison-related injuries (range = 10–13/year), so the park implemented education campaigns. After years of success, five injuries associated with bison encounters occurred in 2015, because visitors did not maintain the required distance of 75 ft (23 m) from bison while hiking or taking pictures.

<div style="float: right; clear: right;">
Bison is an excellent source of complete protein and a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of multiple vitamins including Riboflavin, Niacin, Vitamin B6, and Vitamin B12 and is also a rich source of minerals including iron, phosphorus, and zinc. Additionally, bison is a good source (10% or more of the Daily Value) of thiamine.

In America, the commercial industry for bison has been slow to develop despite individuals, such as <a href="Ted%20Turner">Ted Turner</a>, who have long marketed bison meat. In the 1990s, Turner found limited success with restaurants for high-quality cuts of meat, which include bison steaks and tenderloin. Lower-quality cuts suitable for hamburger and hot dogs have been described as "almost nonexistent". This created a marketing problem for commercial farming because the majority of usable meat, about 400 pounds for each bison, is suitable for these products. In 2003, the United States Department of Agriculture purchased $10 million worth of frozen overstock to save the industry, which would later recover through better use of consumer marketing. Restaurants have played a role in popularizing bison meat, like <a href="Ted%27s%20Montana%20Grill">Ted's Montana Grill</a>, which added bison to their menus. <a href="Ruby%20Tuesday%20%28restaurant%29">Ruby Tuesday</a> first offered bison on their menus in 2005.

In Canada, commercial bison farming began in the mid 1980s, concerning an unknown number of animals then. The first census of the bison occurred in 1996, which recorded 45,235 bison on 745 farms, and grew to 195,728 bison on 1,898 farms for the 2006 census.

Several pet food companies use bison as a red meat alternative in dog foods. The companies producing these formulas include <a href="Natural%20Balance%20Pet%20Foods">Natural Balance Pet Foods</a>, <a href="Freshpet">Freshpet</a>, The Blue Buffalo Company, <a href="Solid%20Gold%20%28pet%20food%29">Solid Gold</a>, Canidae, and Taste of the Wild.

Baryon

A baryon is a <a href="composite%20particle">composite</a> <a href="subatomic%20particle">subatomic particle</a> made up of three <a href="quark">quark</a>s (a triquark, as distinct from <a href="meson">meson</a>s, which are composed of one quark and one <a href="antiquark">antiquark</a>). Baryons and mesons belong to the <a href="hadron">hadron</a> <a href="list%20of%20particles">family of particles</a>, which are the quark-based particles. The name "baryon" comes from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> word for "heavy" (βαρύς, "barys"), because, at the time of their naming, most known elementary particles had lower masses than the baryons.

As quark-based particles, baryons participate in the <a href="strong%20interaction">strong interaction</a>, whereas <a href="lepton">lepton</a>s, which are not quark-based, do not. The most familiar baryons are the <a href="proton">proton</a>s and <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s that make up most of the mass of the visible <a href="matter">matter</a> in the <a href="universe">universe</a>. <a href="Electron">Electron</a>s (the other major component of the <a href="atom">atom</a>) are leptons.

Each baryon has a corresponding <a href="antiparticle">antiparticle</a> (antibaryon) where quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks. For example, a proton is made of two <a href="up%20quark">up quark</a>s and one <a href="down%20quark">down quark</a>; and its corresponding antiparticle, the <a href="antiproton">antiproton</a>, is made of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.

Baryons are strongly interacting <a href="fermion">fermion</a>s, that is, they are acted on by the <a href="strong%20nuclear%20force">strong nuclear force</a> and are described by <a href="Fermi%E2%88%92Dirac%20statistics">Fermi−Dirac statistics</a>, which apply to all particles obeying the <a href="Pauli%20exclusion%20principle">Pauli exclusion principle</a>. This is in contrast to the <a href="boson">boson</a>s, which do not obey the exclusion principle.

Baryons, along with <a href="meson">meson</a>s, are <a href="hadron">hadron</a>s, meaning they are particles composed of <a href="quark">quark</a>s. Quarks have <a href="baryon%20number">baryon number</a>s of "B" =  and antiquarks have baryon numbers of "B" = −. The term "baryon" usually refers to "triquarks"—baryons made of three quarks ("B" =  +  +  = 1).

Other <a href="exotic%20baryon">exotic baryon</a>s have been proposed, such as <a href="pentaquark">pentaquark</a>s—baryons made of four quarks and one antiquark ("B" =  +  +  +  −  = 1), but their existence is not generally accepted. The particle physics community as a whole did not view their existence as likely in 2006, and in 2008, considered evidence to be overwhelmingly against the existence of the reported pentaquarks. However, in July 2015, the <a href="LHCb">LHCb</a> experiment observed two resonances consistent with pentaquark states in the Λ → J/ψKp decay, with a combined <a href="statistical%20significance">statistical significance</a> of 15σ.

In theory, heptaquarks (5 quarks, 2 antiquarks), nonaquarks (6 quarks, 3 antiquarks), etc. could also exist.

Nearly all matter that may be encountered or experienced in everyday life is baryonic <a href="matter">matter</a>, which includes <a href="atom">atom</a>s of any sort, and provides those with the property of mass. Non-baryonic matter, as implied by the name, is any sort of matter that is not composed primarily of baryons. This might include <a href="neutrino">neutrino</a>s and free <a href="electron">electron</a>s, <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a>, such as <a href="supersymmetry">supersymmetric particles</a>, <a href="axion">axion</a>s, and <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s.

The very existence of baryons is also a significant issue in cosmology, because it is assumed that the Big Bang produced a state with equal amounts of baryons and antibaryons. The process by which baryons came to outnumber their antiparticles is called <a href="baryogenesis">baryogenesis</a>.

Experiments are consistent with the number of quarks in the universe being a constant and, to be more specific, the number of baryons being a constant ; in technical language, the total <a href="baryon%20number">baryon number</a> appears to be "<a href="Conservation%20law%20%28physics%29">conserved</a>." Within the prevailing <a href="Standard%20Model">Standard Model</a> of particle physics, the number of baryons may change in multiples of three due to the action of <a href="sphaleron">sphaleron</a>s, although this is rare and has not been observed under experiment. Some <a href="grand%20unified%20theory">grand unified theories</a> of particle physics also predict that a single <a href="proton">proton</a> can decay, changing the baryon number by one; however, this has not yet been observed under experiment. The excess of baryons over antibaryons in the present universe is thought to be due to non-<a href="conservation%20of%20baryon%20number">conservation of baryon number</a> in the very early universe, though this is not well understood.

The concept of isospin was first proposed by <a href="Werner%20Heisenberg">Werner Heisenberg</a> in 1932 to explain the similarities between protons and neutrons under the <a href="strong%20interaction">strong interaction</a>. Although they had different electric charges, their masses were so similar that physicists believed they were the same particle. The different electric charges were explained as being the result of some unknown excitation similar to spin. This unknown excitation was later dubbed "isospin" by <a href="Eugene%20Wigner">Eugene Wigner</a> in 1937.

This belief lasted until <a href="Murray%20Gell-Mann">Murray Gell-Mann</a> proposed the <a href="quark%20model">quark model</a> in 1964 (containing originally only the u, d, and s quarks). The success of the isospin model is now understood to be the result of the similar masses of the u and d quarks. Since the u and d quarks have similar masses, particles made of the same number then also have similar masses. The exact specific u and d quark composition determines the charge, as u quarks carry charge + while d quarks carry charge −. For example, the four <a href="Delta%20baryon">Deltas</a> all have different charges ( (uuu), (uud), (udd), (ddd)), but have similar masses (~1,232 MeV/c) as they are each made of a combination of three u and d quarks. Under the isospin model, they were considered to be a single particle in different charged states.

The mathematics of isospin was modeled after that of spin. Isospin projections varied in increments of 1 just like those of spin, and to each projection was associated a "<a href="Quantum%20state">charged state</a>". Since the "<a href="Delta%20baryon">Delta particle</a>" had four "charged states", it was said to be of isospin "I" = . Its "charged states" , , , and , corresponded to the isospin projections "I" = +, "I" = +, "I" = −, and "I" = −, respectively. Another example is the "nucleon particle". As there were two nucleon "charged states", it was said to be of isospin . The positive nucleon (proton) was identified with "I" = + and the neutral nucleon (neutron) with "I" = −. It was later noted that the isospin projections were related to the up and down quark content of particles by the relation:<br>
where the "n"'s are the number of up and down quarks and antiquarks.

In the "isospin picture", the four Deltas and the two nucleons were thought to be the different states of two particles. However, in the quark model, Deltas are different states of nucleons (the N or N are forbidden by <a href="Pauli%27s%20exclusion%20principle">Pauli's exclusion principle</a>). Isospin, although conveying an inaccurate picture of things, is still used to classify baryons, leading to unnatural and often confusing nomenclature.

The <a href="strangeness">strangeness</a> <a href="flavour%20%28particle%20physics%29%23Flavour%20quantum%20numbers">flavour quantum number</a> "S" (not to be confused with spin) was noticed to go up and down along with particle mass. The higher the mass, the lower the strangeness (the more s quarks). Particles could be described with isospin projections (related to charge) and strangeness (mass) (see the uds octet and decuplet figures on the right). As other quarks were discovered, new quantum numbers were made to have similar description of udc and udb octets and decuplets. Since only the u and d mass are similar, this description of particle mass and charge in terms of isospin and flavour quantum numbers works well only for octet and decuplet made of one u, one d, and one other quark, and breaks down for the other octets and decuplets (for example, ucb octet and decuplet). If the quarks all had the same mass, their behaviour would be called "symmetric", as they would all behave in exactly the same way with respect to the strong interaction. Since quarks do not have the same mass, they do not interact in the same way (exactly like an electron placed in an electric field will accelerate more than a proton placed in the same field because of its lighter mass), and the symmetry is said to be <a href="broken%20symmetry">broken</a>.

It was noted that charge ("Q") was related to the isospin projection ("I"), the <a href="baryon%20number">baryon number</a> ("B") and flavour quantum numbers ("S", "C", "B"′, "T") by the <a href="Gell-Mann%E2%80%93Nishijima%20formula">Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula</a>:<br>

where "S", "C", "B"′, and "T" represent the <a href="strangeness">strangeness</a>, <a href="charm%20%28quantum%20number%29">charm</a>, <a href="bottomness">bottomness</a> and <a href="topness">topness</a> flavour quantum numbers, respectively. They are related to the number of strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks and antiquark according to the relations:<br>

meaning that the Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula is equivalent to the expression of charge in terms of quark content:

<a href="Spin%20%28physics%29">Spin</a> (quantum number "S") is a <a href="Euclidean%20vector">vector</a> quantity that represents the "intrinsic" <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a> of a particle. It comes in increments of  <a href="Planck%27s%20constant">ħ</a> (pronounced "h-bar"). The ħ is often dropped because it is the "fundamental" unit of spin, and it is implied that "spin 1" means "spin 1 ħ". In some systems of <a href="natural%20units">natural units</a>, ħ is chosen to be 1, and therefore does not appear anywhere.

<a href="Quark">Quark</a>s are <a href="fermion">fermion</a>ic particles of spin ("S" = ). Because spin projections vary in increments of 1 (that is 1 ħ), a single quark has a spin vector of length , and has two spin projections ("S" = + and "S" = −). Two quarks can have their spins aligned, in which case the two spin vectors add to make a vector of length "S" = 1 and three spin projections ("S" = +1, "S" = 0, and "S" = −1). If two quarks have unaligned spins, the spin vectors add up to make a vector of length "S" = 0 and has only one spin projection ("S" = 0), etc. Since baryons are made of three quarks, their spin vectors can add to make a vector of length "S" = , which has four spin projections ("S" = +, "S" = +, "S" = −, and "S" = −), or a vector of length "S" =  with two spin projections ("S" = +, and "S" = −).

There is another quantity of angular momentum, called the <a href="angular%20momentum%20operator">orbital angular momentum</a>, (<a href="azimuthal%20quantum%20number">azimuthal quantum number</a> "L"), that comes in increments of 1 ħ, which represent the angular moment due to quarks orbiting around each other. The <a href="angular%20momentum%20operator">total angular momentum</a> (<a href="total%20angular%20momentum%20quantum%20number">total angular momentum quantum number</a> "J") of a particle is therefore the combination of intrinsic angular momentum (spin) and orbital angular momentum. It can take any value from to , in increments of 1.

Particle physicists are most interested in baryons with no orbital angular momentum ("L" = 0), as they correspond to <a href="ground%20state">ground state</a>s—states of minimal energy. Therefore, the two groups of baryons most studied are the "S" = ; "L" = 0 and "S" = ; "L" = 0, which corresponds to "J" =  and "J" = , respectively, although they are not the only ones. It is also possible to obtain "J" =  particles from "S" =  and "L" = 2, as well as "S" =  and "L" = 2. This phenomenon of having multiple particles in the same total angular momentum configuration is called "<a href="degenerate%20energy%20level">degeneracy</a>". How to distinguish between these degenerate baryons is an active area of research in <a href="baryon%20spectroscopy">baryon spectroscopy</a>.

If the universe were reflected in a mirror, most of the laws of physics would be identical—things would behave the same way regardless of what we call "left" and what we call "right". This concept of mirror reflection is called "<a href="parity%20%28physics%29">intrinsic parity</a>" or "parity" ("P"). <a href="Gravity">Gravity</a>, the <a href="electromagnetic%20force">electromagnetic force</a>, and the <a href="strong%20interaction">strong interaction</a> all behave in the same way regardless of whether or not the universe is reflected in a mirror, and thus are said to <a href="P-symmetry">conserve parity</a> (P-symmetry). However, the <a href="weak%20interaction">weak interaction</a> "does" distinguish "left" from "right", a phenomenon called <a href="parity%20violation">parity violation</a> (P-violation).

Based on this, one might think that, if the <a href="wavefunction">wavefunction</a> for each particle (in more precise terms, the <a href="quantum%20field">quantum field</a> for each particle type) were simultaneously mirror-reversed, then the new set of wavefunctions would perfectly satisfy the laws of physics (apart from the weak interaction). It turns out that this is not quite true: In order for the equations to be satisfied, the wavefunctions of certain types of particles have to be multiplied by −1, in addition to being mirror-reversed. Such particle types are said to have "negative" or "odd" parity ("P" = −1, or alternatively "P" = –), while the other particles are said to have "positive" or "even" parity ("P" = +1, or alternatively "P" = +).

For baryons, the parity is related to the orbital angular momentum by the relation:

As a consequence, baryons with no orbital angular momentum ("L" = 0) all have even parity ("P" = +).

Baryons are classified into groups according to their <a href="isospin">isospin</a> ("I") values and <a href="quark">quark</a> ("q") content. There are six groups of baryons—<a href="nucleon">nucleon</a> (), <a href="Delta%20baryon">Delta</a> (), <a href="Lambda%20baryon">Lambda</a> (), <a href="Sigma%20baryon">Sigma</a> (), <a href="Xi%20baryon">Xi</a> (), and <a href="Omega%20baryon">Omega</a> (). The rules for classification are defined by the <a href="Particle%20Data%20Group">Particle Data Group</a>. These rules consider the <a href="up%20quark">up</a> (), <a href="down%20quark">down</a> () and <a href="strange%20quark">strange</a> () quarks to be "light" and the <a href="charm%20quark">charm</a> (), <a href="bottom%20quark">bottom</a> (), and <a href="top%20quark">top</a> () quarks to be "heavy". The rules cover all the particles that can be made from three of each of the six quarks, even though baryons made of top quarks are not expected to exist because of the <a href="top%20quark">top quark's short lifetime</a>. The rules do not cover pentaquarks.


It is also a widespread (but not universal) practice to follow some additional rules when distinguishing between some states that would otherwise have the same symbol.


Quarks carry charge, so knowing the charge of a particle indirectly gives the quark content. For example, the rules above say that a contains a c quark and some combination of two u and/or d quarks. The c quark has a charge of ("Q" = +), therefore the other two must be a u quark ("Q" = +), and a d quark ("Q" = −) to have the correct total charge ("Q" = +1).

Braille embosser

A braille embosser is an <a href="impact%20printer">impact printer</a> that renders text as tactile <a href="braille">braille</a> cells. Using <a href="braille%20translator">braille translation</a> software, a document can be embossed with relative ease, making braille production efficient and cost-effective.

Blind users tend to call other <a href="Printer%20%28computing%29">printer</a>s "ink printers," to distinguish them from their braille counterparts. This is often the case regardless of the type of printer being discussed (e.g., <a href="Thermal%20printing">thermal printers</a> being called "ink printers" even though they use no ink).

As with ink printers and presses, embossers range from those intended for consumers to those used by large publishers. Thus, an embosser can cost roughly anywhere from US$2,000 to $150,000.

The fastest industrial braille embosser is probably the $77,000 Belgian-made <a href="NV%20Interpoint%2055">NV Interpoint 55</a>, first produced in 1991, which uses a separate <a href="air%20compressor">air compressor</a> to drive the embossing head and can output up to 800 braille characters per second. Adoption was slow at first; in 2000 the <a href="National%20Federation%20of%20the%20Blind">National Federation of the Blind</a> said there were only three of these in the USA, one owned by the NFB itself and the other two by the <a href="Watchtower%20Bible%20and%20Tract%20Society">Watchtower Bible and Tract Society</a>. As of 2008 there are more than 60 in use across the world.

Smaller desktop braille embossers are more common and can be found in libraries, universities, and specialist education centers, as well as being privately owned by blind individuals. Particularly with some lower-priced embossers, it may be necessary to use an acoustic cabinet or hood to <a href="Soundproofing">dampen the noise level</a>.

Braille embossers usually need special braille paper which is thicker and more expensive than normal paper. Some high-end embossers are capable of printing on normal paper. Embossers can be either one-sided or two-sided. Duplex embossing requires lining up the dots so they do not overlap (called "interpoint" because the points on the other side are placed in between the points on the first side).

Once one copy of a document has been produced, printing further copies is often quicker by means of a device called a <a href="thermoform">thermoform</a>, which produces copies on soft plastic. However the resulting braille is not as easily readable as braille that has been freshly embossed, in much the same way that a poor-quality <a href="photocopy">photocopy</a> is not as readable as the original. Hence large publishers do not generally use thermoforms.

Basic Role-Playing

Basic Role-Playing (BRP) is a <a href="role-playing%20game%20system">role-playing game system</a> which originated in the "<a href="RuneQuest">RuneQuest</a>" <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a>. The "BRP" standalone booklet was first released in 1980 in the boxes set release of the second edition of "RuneQuest". <a href="Greg%20Stafford">Greg Stafford</a> and <a href="Lynn%20Willis">Lynn Willis</a> are credited as the authors. A percentile skill-based system, "BRP" was used as the basis for most of the games published by <a href="Chaosium">Chaosium</a>, including "<a href="Call%20of%20Cthulhu%20%28role-playing%20game%29">Call of Cthulhu</a>", "<a href="Stormbringer%20%28role-playing%20game%29">Stormbringer</a>", and "<a href="Elfquest%20%28role-playing%20game%29">Elfquest</a>".

The core rules were originally written by <a href="Steve%20Perrin">Steve Perrin</a> as part of his game "RuneQuest". It was <a href="Greg%20Stafford">Greg Stafford</a>'s idea to simplify the rules (eliminating such things as Strike Ranks and Hit Locations) and issue them in a 16-page booklet called "Basic Role-Playing". Over the years several others, including <a href="Sandy%20Petersen">Sandy Petersen</a>, <a href="Lynn%20Willis">Lynn Willis</a>, and <a href="Steve%20Henderson%20%28game%20designer%29">Steve Henderson</a>, contributed to the system.

The "BRP" was notable for being the first role-playing game system to introduce a full skill system to characters regardless of their profession. This was developed in "RuneQuest" but was also later adopted by the more skill-oriented "Call of Cthulhu". 

"BRP" was conceived of as a generic system for playing any sort of RPG. Specific rule systems to support differing genres can be added to the core rules in anodular design. In order to underscore this, in 1982 Chaosium released the "<a href="Worlds%20of%20Wonder%20%28game%29">Worlds of Wonder</a>" box set, which contained a revised main booklet and several booklets providing the additional rules for playing in specific genres. "<a href="Superworld">Superworld</a>", a superhero-themed game, began as a portion of the "Worlds of Wonder" set. A third edition of the core booklet, now titled "Basic Roleplaying: The Chaosium System", was released in 2002.

In 2004, Chaosium published the "Basic Roleplaying" monographs, a series of paperback booklets. The first four monographs ("Players Book", "Magic Book", "Creatures Book", and "Gamemaster Book") were essentially "RuneQuest" 3rd Edition, but with the "RuneQuest" name and other trademarks removed, as Chaosium had lost the rights to the name but retained copyright of the rules text. Additional monographs allowing for new mechanics, thereby extending the system to other genres, were released in the following years. Many of these mongraphs reproduced rules from other Chaosium-published "BRP" games that had gone out of print. 

In 2008 most monographs were collected and updated as a single, comprehensive book, nicknamed the "Big Gold Book", allowing game masters to essentially build their own game from the various subsystems included. A quickstart booklet for new players accompanied it.

Other games published over the years by Chaosium using the "BRP" ruleset include "<a href="Ringworld%20%28RPG%29">Ringworld</a>", "<a href="Hawkmoon%20%28role-playing%20game%29">Hawkmoon</a>", and "<a href="Nephilim%20%28RPG%29">Nephilim</a>".

"BRP" is similar to other generic systems such as "<a href="GURPS">GURPS</a>", "<a href="Hero%20System">Hero System</a>" or "<a href="Savage%20Worlds">Savage Worlds</a>" in that it uses a simple resolution method which can be broadly applied. "BRP" uses a core set of seven <a href="Ability%20score">characteristics</a>: Size, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Power, and Appearance or Charisma. From those, a character derives scores in various <a href="Skill%20%28role-playing%29">skills</a>, expressed as percentages. These skill scores are the basis of play. When attempting an action, the player rolls percentile dice trying to get a result equal to or lower than the character's current skill score. Each incarnation of the "BRP" rules has changed or added to the core ideas and mechanics, so that games are not identical. For example, in "Call of Cthulhu", skills may never be over 100%, while in "Stormbringer" skills in excess of 100% are within reach for all characters. Scores can increase through experience checks, the mechanics of which vary in an individual game. 

"BRP" treats armor and defense as separate functions: the act of parrying is a defensive skill that reduced an opponent's chance to successfully land an attack, and the purpose of armor is to absorb damage. 

The last major element of many "BRP" games is that there is no difference between the player character race systems and that of the monster or opponents. By varying ability scores, the same system is used for a human hero as a troll villain. This approach allows for players to play a wide variety of non-human species.

Chaosium was an early adopter of licensing out its "BRP" system to other companies, something that was unique at the time they began but rather commonplace now thanks to the <a href="D20%20System">d20</a> licenses. This places the "BRP" in the notable position of being one of the first products to allow other game companies to develop games or game aids for their work. Companies such as Green Knight and <a href="Pagan%20Publishing">Pagan Publishing</a> earliest works were built to support Chaosium's games.

Other, non-Chaosium games have used "BRP" for its core rules. For example, "<a href="Other%20Suns">Other Suns</a>", published by <a href="Fantasy%20Games%20Unlimited">Fantasy Games Unlimited</a> (FGU), used them under license. "BRP" was also used as the base for the highly successful Swedish game "<a href="Drakar%20och%20Demoner">Drakar och Demoner</a>" from <a href="Target%20Games">Target Games</a>.

The "BRP" itself has been the recipient, via its games, of many awards. Most notable was the 1981 <a href="Origins%20Award">Origins Award</a> for "Best Roleplaying Rules" for "Call of Cthulhu". Other editions of "Call of Cthulhu" have also won Origins Awards including the Hall of Fame award. The "BRP" Character Generation software has also won awards for its design.

Block cipher

In <a href="cryptography">cryptography</a>, a block cipher is a <a href="deterministic%20algorithm">deterministic algorithm</a> operating on fixed-length groups of <a href="bit">bit</a>s, called a "block", with an unvarying transformation that is specified by a <a href="symmetric%20key">symmetric key</a>. Block ciphers operate as important <a href="cryptographic%20primitive">elementary component</a>s in the design of many <a href="cryptographic%20protocol">cryptographic protocol</a>s, and are widely used to implement <a href="encryption">encryption</a> of bulk data.

The modern design of block ciphers is based on the concept of an iterated <a href="product%20cipher">product cipher</a>. In his seminal 1949 publication, "<a href="Communication%20Theory%20of%20Secrecy%20Systems">Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems</a>", <a href="Claude%20Shannon">Claude Shannon</a> analyzed product ciphers and suggested them as a means of effectively improving security by combining simple operations such as <a href="substitution%20cipher">substitution</a>s and <a href="transposition%20cipher">permutation</a>s. Iterated product ciphers carry out encryption in multiple rounds, each of which uses a different subkey derived from the original key. One widespread implementation of such ciphers, named a <a href="Feistel%20network">Feistel network</a> after <a href="Horst%20Feistel">Horst Feistel</a>, is notably implemented in the <a href="Data%20Encryption%20Standard">DES</a> cipher. Many other realizations of block ciphers, such as the <a href="Advanced%20Encryption%20Standard">AES</a>, are classified as <a href="substitution-permutation%20network">substitution-permutation network</a>s.

The publication of the DES cipher by the United States National Bureau of Standards (subsequently the U.S. <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a>, NIST) in 1977 was fundamental in the public understanding of modern block cipher design. It also influenced the academic development of <a href="cryptanalysis">cryptanalytic attack</a>s. Both <a href="differential%20cryptanalysis">differential</a> and <a href="linear%20cryptanalysis">linear cryptanalysis</a> arose out of studies on the DES design. there is a palette of attack techniques against which a block cipher must be secure, in addition to being robust against <a href="brute%20force%20attack">brute force attack</a>s.

Even a secure block cipher is suitable only for the encryption of a single block under a fixed key. A multitude of <a href="block%20cipher%20modes%20of%20operation">modes of operation</a> have been designed to allow their repeated use in a secure way, commonly to achieve the security goals of <a href="confidentiality">confidentiality</a> and <a href="authentication">authenticity</a>. However, block ciphers may also feature as building-blocks in other cryptographic protocols, such as <a href="universal%20hash%20function">universal hash function</a>s and <a href="pseudo-random%20number%20generator">pseudo-random number generator</a>s.

A block cipher consists of two paired <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a>s, one for encryption, "E", and the other for decryption, "D". Both algorithms accept two inputs: an input block of size "n" bits and a <a href="key%20%28cryptography%29">key</a> of size "k" bits; and both yield an "n"-bit output block. The decryption algorithm "D" is defined to be the <a href="inverse%20function">inverse function</a> of encryption, i.e., "D" = "E". More formally, a block cipher is specified by an encryption function
which takes as input a key "K" of bit length "k", called the "key size", and a bit string "P" of length "n", called the "block size", and returns a string "C" of "n" bits. "P" is called the <a href="plaintext">plaintext</a>, and "C" is termed the <a href="ciphertext">ciphertext</a>. For each "K", the function "E"("P") is required to be an invertible mapping on {0,1}. The inverse for "E" is defined as a function
taking a key "K" and a ciphertext "C" to return a plaintext value "P", such that

For example, a block cipher encryption algorithm might take a 128-bit block of plaintext as input, and output a corresponding 128-bit block of ciphertext. The exact transformation is controlled using a second input – the secret key. Decryption is similar: the decryption algorithm takes, in this example, a 128-bit block of ciphertext together with the secret key, and yields the original 128-bit block of plain text.

For each key "K", "E" is a <a href="permutation">permutation</a> (a <a href="bijective">bijective</a> mapping) over the set of input blocks. Each key selects one permutation from the possible set of formula_4.

Most block cipher algorithms are classified as "iterated block ciphers" which means that they transform fixed-size blocks of plain-text into identical size blocks of ciphertext, via the repeated application of an invertible transformation known as the "round function", with each iteration referred to as a "round".

Usually, the round function "R" takes different "round keys" "K" as second input, which are derived from the original key:
where formula_6 is the plaintext and formula_7 the ciphertext, with "r" being the round number.

Frequently, <a href="key%20whitening">key whitening</a> is used in addition to this. At the beginning and the end, the data is modified with key material (often with <a href="Exclusive%20or">XOR</a>, but simple arithmetic operations like adding and subtracting are also used):

Given one of the standard iterated block cipher design schemes, it is fairly easy to construct a block cipher that is cryptographically secure, simply by using a large number of rounds. However, this will make the cipher inefficient. Thus, efficiency is the most important additional design criterion for professional ciphers. Further, a good block cipher is designed to avoid side-channel attacks, such as input-dependent memory accesses that might leak secret data via the cache state or the execution time. In addition, the cipher should be concise, for small hardware and software implementations. Finally, the cipher should be easily cryptanalyzable, such that it can be shown to how many rounds the cipher needs to be reduced such that the existing cryptographic attacks would work and, conversely, that the number of actual rounds is large enough to protect against them.

One important type of iterated block cipher known as a "<a href="substitution-permutation%20network">substitution-permutation network</a> (SPN)" takes a block of the plaintext and the key as inputs, and applies several alternating rounds consisting of a <a href="Substitution%20box">substitution stage</a> followed by a <a href="Permutation%20box">permutation stage</a>—to produce each block of ciphertext output. The non-linear substitution stage mixes the key bits with those of the plaintext, creating Shannon's "<a href="confusion%20%28cryptography%29">confusion</a>". The linear permutation stage then dissipates redundancies, creating "<a href="diffusion%20%28cryptography%29">diffusion</a>".

A "<a href="substitution%20box">substitution box</a> (S-box)" substitutes a small block of input bits with another block of output bits. This substitution must be <a href="Bijection">one-to-one</a>, to ensure invertibility (hence decryption). A secure S-box will have the property that changing one input bit will change about half of the output bits on average, exhibiting what is known as the <a href="avalanche%20effect">avalanche effect</a>—i.e. it has the property that each output bit will depend on every input bit.

A "<a href="permutation%20box">permutation box</a> (P-box)" is a <a href="permutation">permutation</a> of all the bits: it takes the outputs of all the S-boxes of one round, permutes the bits, and feeds them into the S-boxes of the next round. A good P-box has the property that the output bits of any S-box are distributed to as many S-box inputs as possible.

At each round, the round key (obtained from the key with some simple operations, for instance, using S-boxes and P-boxes) is combined using some group operation, typically <a href="XOR">XOR</a>.

<a href="Decryption">Decryption</a> is done by simply reversing the process (using the inverses of the S-boxes and P-boxes and applying the round keys in reversed order).

In a "<a href="Feistel%20cipher">Feistel cipher</a>", the block of plain text to be encrypted is split into two equal-sized halves. The round function is applied to one half, using a subkey, and then the output is XORed with the other half. The two halves are then swapped.

Let formula_11 be the round function and let
formula_12 be the sub-keys for the rounds formula_13 respectively.

Then the basic operation is as follows:

Split the plaintext block into two equal pieces, (formula_14, formula_15)

For each round formula_16, compute

Then the ciphertext is formula_19.

Decryption of a ciphertext formula_19 is accomplished by computing for formula_21

Then formula_24 is the plaintext again.

One advantage of the Feistel model compared to a <a href="substitution-permutation%20network">substitution-permutation network</a> is that the round function formula_11 does not have to be invertible.

The Lai-Massey scheme offers security properties similar to those of the <a href="Feistel%20structure">Feistel structure</a>. It also shares its advantage that the round function formula_26 does not have to be invertible. Another similarity is that is also splits the input block into two equal pieces. However, the round function is applied to the difference between the two, and the result is then added to both half blocks.

Let formula_26 be the round function and formula_28 a half-round function and let formula_29 be the sub-keys for the rounds formula_13 respectively.

Then the basic operation is as follows:

Split the plaintext block into two equal pieces, (formula_14, formula_15)

For each round formula_16, compute

where formula_35 and formula_36

Then the ciphertext is formula_37.

Decryption of a ciphertext formula_38 is accomplished by computing for formula_21

where formula_41 and formula_42

Then formula_43 is the plaintext again.

Many modern block ciphers and hashes are ARX algorithms—their round function involves only three operations: <a href="modular%20addition">modular addition</a>, <a href="circular%20shift">rotation</a> with fixed rotation amounts, and <a href="exclusive%20or">XOR</a> (ARX). Examples include <a href="Salsa20">Salsa20</a>, <a href="Speck%20%28cipher%29">Speck</a>, <a href="XXTEA">XXTEA</a>, and <a href="BLAKE%20%28hash%20function%29">BLAKE</a>.
Many authors draw an ARX network, a kind of <a href="data%20flow%20diagram">data flow diagram</a>, to illustrate such a round function.

These ARX operations are popular because they are relatively fast and cheap in hardware and software,
and also because they run in constant time, and are therefore immune to <a href="timing%20attack">timing attack</a>s.
The <a href="rotational%20cryptanalysis">rotational cryptanalysis</a> technique attempts to attack such round functions.

Other operations often used in block ciphers include
data-dependent rotations as in <a href="RC5">RC5</a> and <a href="RC6">RC6</a>,
a <a href="substitution%20box">substitution box</a> implemented as a <a href="lookup%20table">lookup table</a> as in <a href="Data%20Encryption%20Standard">Data Encryption Standard</a> and <a href="Advanced%20Encryption%20Standard">Advanced Encryption Standard</a>,
a <a href="permutation%20box">permutation box</a>,
and multiplication as in <a href="IDEA%20%28cipher%29">IDEA</a>.

A block cipher by itself allows encryption only of a single data block of the cipher's block length. For a variable-length message, the data must first be partitioned into separate cipher blocks. In the simplest case, known as the <a href="electronic%20codebook">electronic codebook</a> (ECB) mode, a message is first split into separate blocks of the cipher's block size (possibly extending the last block with <a href="Padding%20%28cryptography%29">padding</a> bits), and then each block is encrypted and decrypted independently. However, such a naive method is generally insecure because equal plaintext blocks will always generate equal ciphertext blocks (for the same key), so patterns in the plaintext message become evident in the ciphertext output.

To overcome this limitation, several so-called <a href="block%20cipher%20modes%20of%20operation">block cipher modes of operation</a> have been designed and specified in national recommendations such as NIST 800-38A and <a href="Bundesamt%20f%C3%BCr%20Sicherheit%20in%20der%20Informationstechnik">BSI</a> TR-02102 and international standards such as <a href="ISO/IEC%2010116">ISO/IEC 10116</a>. The general concept is to use <a href="randomization">randomization</a> of the plaintext data based on an additional input value, frequently called an <a href="initialization%20vector">initialization vector</a>, to create what is termed <a href="probabilistic%20encryption">probabilistic encryption</a>. In the popular <a href="cipher%20block%20chaining">cipher block chaining</a> (CBC) mode, for encryption to be <a href="semantic%20security">secure</a> the initialization vector passed along with the plaintext message must be a random or <a href="pseudo-random">pseudo-random</a> value, which is added in an <a href="Exclusive%20or">exclusive-or</a> manner to the first plaintext block before it is being encrypted. The resultant ciphertext block is then used as the new initialization vector for the next plaintext block. In the <a href="cipher%20feedback">cipher feedback</a> (CFB) mode, which emulates a <a href="stream%20cipher%23Self-synchronizing%20stream%20ciphers">self-synchronizing stream cipher</a>, the initialization vector is first encrypted and then added to the plaintext block. The <a href="output%20feedback">output feedback</a> (OFB) mode repeatedly encrypts the initialization vector to create a <a href="key%20stream">key stream</a> for the emulation of a <a href="Stream%20cipher%23Synchronous%20stream%20ciphers">synchronous stream cipher</a>. The newer <a href="counter%20mode">counter</a> (CTR) mode similarly creates a key stream, but has the advantage of only needing unique and not (pseudo-)random values as initialization vectors; the needed randomness is derived internally by using the initialization vector as a block counter and encrypting this counter for each block.

From a <a href="provable%20security">security-theoretic</a> point of view, modes of operation must provide what is known as <a href="semantic%20security">semantic security</a>. Informally, it means that given some ciphertext under an unknown key one cannot practically derive any information from the ciphertext (other than the length of the message) over what one would have known without seeing the ciphertext. It has been shown that all of the modes discussed above, with the exception of the ECB mode, provide this property under so-called <a href="chosen%20plaintext%20attack">chosen plaintext attack</a>s.

Some modes such as the CBC mode only operate on complete plaintext blocks. Simply extending the last block of a message with zero-bits is insufficient since it does not allow a receiver to easily distinguish messages that differ only in the amount of padding bits. More importantly, such a simple solution gives rise to very efficient <a href="padding%20oracle%20attack">padding oracle attack</a>s. A suitable <a href="padding%20%28cryptography%29">padding scheme</a> is therefore needed to extend the last plaintext block to the cipher's block size. While many popular schemes described in standards and in the literature have been shown to be vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, a solution which adds a one-bit and then extends the last block with zero-bits, standardized as "padding method 2" in <a href="ISO/IEC%209797-1">ISO/IEC 9797-1</a>, has been proven secure against these attacks.

Due to a block cipher's characteristic as an invertible function, its output becomes <a href="distinguishing%20attack">distinguishable</a> from a truly random output string over time due to the <a href="birthday%20attack">birthday attack</a>. This property results in the cipher's security degrading quadratically, and needs to be taken into account when selecting a block size. There is a trade-off though as large block sizes can result in the algorithm becoming inefficient to operate. Earlier block ciphers such as the <a href="Data%20Encryption%20Standard">DES</a> have typically selected a 64-bit block size, while newer designs such as the <a href="Advanced%20Encryption%20Standard">AES</a> support block sizes of 128 bits or more, with some ciphers supporting a range of different block sizes.

"<a href="Linear%20cryptanalysis">Linear cryptanalysis</a>" is a form of cryptanalysis based on finding <a href="affine%20transformation">affine</a> approximations to the action of a <a href="cipher">cipher</a>. Linear cryptanalysis is one of the two most widely used attacks on block ciphers; the other being <a href="differential%20cryptanalysis">differential cryptanalysis</a>. 

The discovery is attributed to <a href="Mitsuru%20Matsui">Mitsuru Matsui</a>, who first applied the technique to the <a href="FEAL">FEAL</a> cipher (Matsui and Yamagishi, 1992).

"<a href="Integral%20cryptanalysis">Integral cryptanalysis</a>" is a cryptanalytic attack that is particularly applicable to block ciphers based on substitution-permutation networks. Unlike differential cryptanalysis, which uses pairs of chosen plaintexts with a fixed XOR difference, integral cryptanalysis uses sets or even multisets of chosen plaintexts of which part is held constant and another part varies through all possibilities. For example, an attack might use 256 chosen plaintexts that have all but 8 of their bits the same, but all differ in those 8 bits. Such a set necessarily has an XOR sum of 0, and the XOR sums of the corresponding sets of ciphertexts provide information about the cipher's operation. This contrast between the differences of pairs of texts and the sums of larger sets of texts inspired the name "integral cryptanalysis", borrowing the terminology of calculus.

In addition to linear and differential cryptanalysis, there is a growing catalog of attacks: <a href="truncated%20differential%20cryptanalysis">truncated differential cryptanalysis</a>, partial differential cryptanalysis, <a href="integral%20cryptanalysis">integral cryptanalysis</a>, which encompasses square and integral attacks, <a href="slide%20attack">slide attack</a>s, <a href="boomerang%20attack">boomerang attack</a>s, the <a href="XSL%20attack">XSL attack</a>, <a href="impossible%20differential%20cryptanalysis">impossible differential cryptanalysis</a> and algebraic attacks. For a new block cipher design to have any credibility, it must demonstrate evidence of security against known attacks.

When a block cipher is used in a given <a href="Block%20cipher%20mode%20of%20operation">mode of operation</a>, the resulting algorithm should ideally be about as secure as the block cipher itself. ECB (discussed above) emphatically lacks this property: regardless of how secure the underlying block cipher is, ECB mode can easily be attacked. On the other hand, CBC mode can be proven to be secure under the assumption that the underlying block cipher is likewise secure. Note, however, that making statements like this requires formal mathematical definitions for what it means for an encryption algorithm or a block cipher to "be secure". This section describes two common notions for what properties a block cipher should have. Each corresponds to a mathematical model that can be used to prove properties of higher level algorithms, such as CBC.

This general approach to cryptography---proving higher-level algorithms (such as CBC) are secure under explicitly stated assumptions regarding their components (such as a block cipher)---is known as "provable security".

Informally, a block cipher is secure in the standard model if an attacker cannot tell the difference between the block cipher (equipped with a random key) and a random permutation.

To be a bit more precise, let "E" be an "n"-bit block cipher. We imagine the following game:

The attacker, which we can model as an algorithm, is called an "<a href="Adversary%20%28cryptography%29">adversary</a>". The function "f" (which the adversary was able to query) is called an "<a href="Oracle%20machine">oracle</a>".

Note that an adversary can trivially ensure a 50% chance of winning simply by guessing at random (or even by, for example, always guessing "heads"). Therefore, let "P(A)" denote the probability that the adversary "A" wins this game against "E", and define the "advantage" of "A" as 2("P(A)" - 1/2). It follows that if "A" guesses randomly, its advantage will be 0; on the other hand, if "A" always wins, then its advantage is 1. The block cipher "E" is a "pseudo-random permutation" (PRP) if no adversary has an advantage significantly greater than 0, given specified restrictions on "q" and the adversary's running time. If in Step 2 above adversaries have the option of learning "f(X)" instead of "f(X)" (but still have only small advantages) then "E" is a "strong" PRP (SPRP). An adversary is "non-adaptive" if it chooses all "q" values for "X" before the game begins (that is, it does not use any information gleaned from previous queries to choose each "X" as it goes).

These definitions have proven useful for analyzing various modes of operation. For example, one can define a similar game for measuring the security of a block cipher-based encryption algorithm, and then try to show (through a <a href="Reduction%20%28complexity%29">reduction argument</a>) that the probability of an adversary winning this new game is not much more than "P(A)" for some "A". (The reduction typically provides limits on "q" and the running time of "A".) Equivalently, if "P(A)" is small for all relevant "A", then no attacker has a significant probability of winning the new game. This formalizes the idea that the higher-level algorithm inherits the block cipher's security.

Block ciphers may be evaluated according to multiple criteria in practice. Common factors include:

<a href="Lucifer%20%28cipher%29">Lucifer</a> is generally considered to be the first civilian block cipher, developed at <a href="IBM">IBM</a> in the 1970s based on work done by <a href="Horst%20Feistel">Horst Feistel</a>. A revised version of the algorithm was adopted as a U.S. government <a href="Federal%20Information%20Processing%20Standard">Federal Information Processing Standard</a>: FIPS PUB 46 <a href="Data%20Encryption%20Standard">Data Encryption Standard</a> (DES). It was chosen by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (NBS) after a public invitation for submissions and some internal changes by <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">NBS</a> (and, potentially, the <a href="NSA">NSA</a>). DES was publicly released in 1976 and has been widely used.

DES was designed to, among other things, resist a certain cryptanalytic attack known to the NSA and rediscovered by IBM, though unknown publicly until rediscovered again and published by <a href="Eli%20Biham">Eli Biham</a> and <a href="Adi%20Shamir">Adi Shamir</a> in the late 1980s. The technique is called <a href="differential%20cryptanalysis">differential cryptanalysis</a> and remains one of the few general attacks against block ciphers; <a href="linear%20cryptanalysis">linear cryptanalysis</a> is another, but may have been unknown even to the NSA, prior to its publication by <a href="Mitsuru%20Matsui">Mitsuru Matsui</a>. DES prompted a large amount of other work and publications in cryptography and <a href="cryptanalysis">cryptanalysis</a> in the open community and it inspired many new cipher designs.

DES has a block size of 64 bits and a <a href="key%20size">key size</a> of 56 bits. 64-bit blocks became common in block cipher designs after DES. Key length depended on several factors, including government regulation. Many observers in the 1970s commented that the 56-bit key length used for DES was too short. As time went on, its inadequacy became apparent, especially after a <a href="EFF%20DES%20cracker">special purpose machine designed to break DES</a> was demonstrated in 1998 by the <a href="Electronic%20Frontier%20Foundation">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>. An extension to DES, <a href="Triple%20DES">Triple DES</a>, triple-encrypts each block with either two independent keys (112-bit key and 80-bit security) or three independent keys (168-bit key and 112-bit security). It was widely adopted as a replacement. As of 2011, the three-key version is still considered secure, though the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) standards no longer permit the use of the two-key version in new applications, due to its 80-bit security level.

The "<a href="International%20Data%20Encryption%20Algorithm">International Data Encryption Algorithm</a>" ("IDEA") is a block cipher designed by <a href="James%20Massey">James Massey</a> of <a href="ETH%20Zurich">ETH Zurich</a> and <a href="Xuejia%20Lai">Xuejia Lai</a>; it was first described in 1991, as an intended replacement for DES.

IDEA operates on 64-bit <a href="block%20size%20%28cryptography%29">blocks</a> using a 128-bit key, and consists of a series of eight identical transformations (a "round") and an output transformation (the "half-round"). The processes for encryption and decryption are similar. IDEA derives much of its security by interleaving operations from different <a href="group%20%28mathematics%29">groups</a> — <a href="modular%20arithmetic">modular</a> addition and multiplication, and bitwise "<a href="exclusive%20or">exclusive or</a> (XOR)" — which are algebraically "incompatible" in some sense.

The designers analysed IDEA to measure its strength against <a href="differential%20cryptanalysis">differential cryptanalysis</a> and concluded that it is immune under certain assumptions. No successful <a href="linear%20cryptanalysis">linear</a> or algebraic weaknesses have been reported. , the best attack which applies to all keys can break full 8.5 round IDEA using a narrow-bicliques attack about four times faster than brute force.

RC5 is a block cipher designed by <a href="Ron%20Rivest">Ronald Rivest</a> in 1994 which, unlike many other ciphers, has a variable block size (32, 64 or 128 bits), key size (0 to 2040 bits) and number of rounds (0 to 255). The original suggested choice of parameters were a block size of 64 bits, a 128-bit key and 12 rounds.

A key feature of RC5 is the use of data-dependent rotations; one of the goals of RC5 was to prompt the study and evaluation of such operations as a cryptographic primitive. RC5 also consists of a number of <a href="modular%20arithmetic">modular</a> additions and XORs. The general structure of the algorithm is a <a href="Feistel%20cipher">Feistel</a>-like network. The encryption and decryption routines can be specified in a few lines of code. The key schedule, however, is more complex, expanding the key using an essentially <a href="one-way%20function">one-way function</a> with the binary expansions of both <a href="e%20%28mathematical%20constant%29">e</a> and the <a href="golden%20ratio">golden ratio</a> as sources of "<a href="nothing%20up%20my%20sleeve%20number">nothing up my sleeve number</a>s". The tantalising simplicity of the algorithm together with the novelty of the data-dependent rotations has made RC5 an attractive object of study for cryptanalysts.

12-round RC5 (with 64-bit blocks) is susceptible to a <a href="differential%20cryptanalysis">differential attack</a> using 2 chosen plaintexts. 18–20 rounds are suggested as sufficient protection.

DES has been superseded as a United States Federal Standard by the AES, adopted by NIST in 2001 after a 5-year <a href="Advanced%20Encryption%20Standard%20process">public competition</a>. The cipher was developed by two Belgian cryptographers, <a href="Joan%20Daemen">Joan Daemen</a> and <a href="Vincent%20Rijmen">Vincent Rijmen</a>, and submitted under the name "Rijndael".

AES has a fixed block size of 128 bits and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits, whereas Rijndael can be specified with block and key sizes in any multiple of 32 bits, with a minimum of 128 bits. The blocksize has a maximum of 256 bits, but the keysize has no theoretical maximum. AES operates on a 4×4 <a href="column-major%20order">column-major order</a> matrix of bytes, termed the "state" (versions of Rijndael with a larger block size have additional columns in the state).

"<a href="Blowfish%20%28cipher%29">Blowfish</a>" is a block cipher, designed in 1993 by <a href="Bruce%20Schneier">Bruce Schneier</a> and included in a large number of cipher suites and encryption products. Blowfish has a 64-bit block size and a variable <a href="key%20length">key length</a> from 1 bit up to 448 bits. It is a 16-round <a href="Feistel%20cipher">Feistel cipher</a> and uses large key-dependent <a href="Substitution%20box">S-boxes</a>. Notable features of the design include the key-dependent <a href="S-box">S-box</a>es and a highly complex <a href="key%20schedule">key schedule</a>.

Schneier designed Blowfish as a general-purpose algorithm, intended as an alternative to the ageing DES and free of the problems and constraints associated with other algorithms. At the time Blowfish was released, many other designs were proprietary, encumbered by <a href="patent">patent</a>s or were commercial/government secrets. Schneier has stated that, "Blowfish is unpatented, and will remain so in all countries. The algorithm is hereby placed in the <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a>, and can be freely used by anyone." Blowfish provides a good encryption rate in software and no effective <a href="cryptanalysis">cryptanalysis</a> of the full-round version has been found to date.

M. Liskov, R. Rivest, and D. Wagner have described a generalized version of block ciphers called "tweakable" block ciphers. A tweakable block cipher accepts a second input called the "tweak" along with its usual plaintext or ciphertext input. The tweak, along with the key, selects the permutation computed by the cipher. If changing tweaks is sufficiently lightweight (compared with a usually fairly expensive key setup operation), then some interesting new operation modes become possible. The <a href="disk%20encryption%20theory">disk encryption theory</a> article describes some of these modes.

Block ciphers traditionally work over a binary <a href="Alphabet%20%28computer%20science%29">alphabet</a>. That is, both the input and the output are binary strings, consisting of "n" zeroes and ones. In some situations, however, one may wish to have a block cipher that works over some other alphabet; for example, encrypting 16-digit credit card numbers in such a way that the ciphertext is also a 16-digit number might facilitate adding an encryption layer to legacy software. This is an example of "format-preserving encryption". More generally, format-preserving encryption requires a keyed permutation on some finite <a href="Formal%20language">language</a>. This makes format-preserving encryption schemes a natural generalization of (tweakable) block ciphers. In contrast, traditional encryption schemes, such as CBC, are not permutations because the same plaintext can encrypt to multiple different ciphertexts, even when using a fixed key.

Block ciphers can be used to build other cryptographic primitives, such as those below. For these other primitives to be cryptographically secure, care has to be taken to build them the right way.


Just as block ciphers can be used to build hash functions, hash functions can be used to build block ciphers. Examples of such block ciphers are <a href="SHACAL">SHACAL</a>, <a href="BEAR_and_LION_ciphers">BEAR and LION</a>.

Wireless broadband

Wireless broadband is technology that provides high-speed <a href="wireless">wireless</a> <a href="Internet%20access">Internet access</a> or <a href="computer%20networking">computer networking</a> access over a wide area.

Originally the word "<a href="broadband">broadband</a>" had a technical meaning, but became a marketing term for any kind of relatively high-speed computer network or Internet access technology.
According to the <a href="IEEE%20802.16">802.16-2004</a> standard, broadband means "having instantaneous <a href="Bandwidth%20%28signal%20processing%29">bandwidths</a> greater than 1 <a href="MHz">MHz</a> and supporting <a href="bit%20rate">data rates</a> greater than about 1.5 <a href="Megabit">Mbit</a>/s."
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently re-defined the definition to mean download speeds of at least 25 <a href="Megabit">Mbit</a>/s and upload speeds of at least 3 <a href="Megabit">Mbit</a>/s.

Wireless networks can feature data rates roughly equivalent to some wired networks, such as that of <a href="asymmetric%20digital%20subscriber%20line">asymmetric digital subscriber line</a> (ADSL) or a <a href="cable%20modem">cable modem</a>. Wireless networks can also be symmetrical, meaning the same rate in both directions (<a href="downstream%20%28networking%29">downstream</a> and <a href="upstream%20%28networking%29">upstream</a>), which is most commonly associated with <a href="fixed%20wireless">fixed wireless</a> networks. A fixed wireless network link is a stationary terrestrial wireless connection, which can support higher data rates for the same power as mobile or satellite systems.

Few <a href="wireless%20Internet%20service%20provider">wireless Internet service provider</a>s (WISPs) provide download speeds of over 100 Mbit/s; most broadband wireless access (BWA) services are estimated to have a range of from a tower. Technologies used include <a href="Local%20Multipoint%20Distribution%20Service">LMDS</a> and <a href="Multichannel%20Multipoint%20Distribution%20Service">MMDS</a>, as well as heavy use of the <a href="ISM%20band">ISM band</a>s and one particular access technology was standardized by <a href="IEEE%20802.16">IEEE 802.16</a>, with products known as <a href="WiMAX">WiMAX</a>.

WiMAX is highly popular in Europe but has not met full acceptance in the United States because cost of deployment does not meet <a href="return%20on%20investment">return on investment</a> figures. In 2005 the <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> adopted a <a href="Report%20and%20Order">Report and Order</a> that revised the FCC’s rules to open the 3650 MHz band for terrestrial wireless broadband operations.

On November 14, 2007 the Commission released Public Notice DA 07-4605 in which the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau announced the start date for licensing and registration process for the <a href="IEEE%20802.11y-2008">3650–3700 MHz</a> band.
In 2010 the FCC adopted the TV White Space Rules (TVWS) and allowed some of the better no line of sight frequency (700 MHz) into the FCC Part-15 Rules. The Wireless Internet Service Providers Association, a national association of WISPs, petitioned the FCC and won.

Initially, WISPs were only found in rural areas not covered by <a href="Cable%20Internet%20access">cable</a> or <a href="DSL">DSL</a>. These early WISPs would employ a high-capacity <a href="T-carrier">T-carrier</a>, such as a <a href="Digital%20Signal%201">T1</a> or <a href="Digital%20Signal%203">DS3</a> connection, and then broadcast the signal from a high elevation, such as at the top of a <a href="water%20tower">water tower</a>. To receive this type of Internet connection, consumers mount a small <a href="Parabolic%20antenna">dish</a> to the roof of their home or office and point it to the transmitter. <a href="Line-of-sight%20propagation">Line of sight</a> is usually necessary for WISPs operating in the <a href="IEEE%20802.11">2.4 and 5 GHz</a> bands with 900 MHz offering better <a href="NLOS">NLOS</a> (non-line-of-sight) performance.

Providers of fixed wireless broadband services typically provide equipment to customers and install a small antenna or dish somewhere on the roof. This equipment is usually deployed as a service and maintained by the company providing that service. Fixed wireless services have become particularly popular in many rural areas where Cable, DSL or other typical home Internet services are not available.

Many companies in the US and worldwide have started using wireless alternatives to incumbent and local providers for internet and voice service. These providers tend to offer competitive services and options in areas where there is a difficulty getting affordable Ethernet connections from terrestrial providers such as ATT, Comcast, Verizon and others. Also, companies looking for full diversity between carriers for critical uptime requirements may seek wireless alternatives to local options.

To cope with increased demand for wireless broadband, increased <a href="Radio%20spectrum">spectrum</a> would be needed. Studies began in 2009, and while some unused spectrum was available, it appeared broadcasters would have to give up at least some spectrum. This led to strong objections from the broadcasting community. In 2013, auctions were planned, and for now any action by broadcasters is voluntary.

Björn Borg

Björn Rune Borg (; born 6 June 1956) is a <a href="Swedes">Swedish</a> former <a href="List%20of%20ATP%20number%201%20ranked%20singles%20players">world No. 1</a> <a href="tennis%20player">tennis player</a> widely considered to be one of the greatest in the history of the sport. Between 1974 and 1981 he became the first man in the <a href="Open%20Era">Open Era</a> to win 11 <a href="Grand%20Slam%20%28tennis%29">Grand Slam</a> singles titles (six at the <a href="French%20Open">French Open</a> and five consecutive at <a href="The%20Championships%2C%20Wimbledon">Wimbledon</a>). He also won three <a href="Open%20Era%20tennis%20records%20%E2%80%93%20men%27s%20singles%23Year-end%20championships">year-end championships</a> and 15 <a href="Grand%20Prix%20Super%20Series">Grand Prix Super Series</a> titles. Overall, he set <a href="Bj%C3%B6rn%20Borg%23Records">numerous records</a> that still stand.

A teenage sensation at the start of his career, Borg's unprecedented stardom and consistent success helped propel the rising popularity of tennis during the 1970s. As a result, the professional tour became more lucrative, and in 1979 he was the first player to earn more than one million dollars in prize money in a single season. He also made millions in endorsements throughout his career. The downside, however, was that the constant attention and pressure eventually caused <a href="Burnout%20%28psychology%29">burnout</a> and his retirement at the age of 26.

Björn Borg was born in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, Sweden, on 6 June 1956, as the only child of Rune and Margaretha Borg. He grew up in nearby <a href="S%C3%B6dert%C3%A4lje">Södertälje</a>. As a child, Borg became fascinated with a golden tennis racket that his father won at a <a href="table-tennis">table-tennis</a> tournament. His father gave him the racket, beginning his tennis career.

A player of great athleticism and endurance, he had a distinctive style and appearance—bowlegged and very fast. His muscularity allowed him to put heavy topspin on both his forehand and two-handed backhand. He followed <a href="Jimmy%20Connors">Jimmy Connors</a> in using the two-handed backhand. By the time he was 13 he was beating the best of Sweden's under-18 players, and Davis Cup captain <a href="Lennart%20Bergelin">Lennart Bergelin</a> (who served as Borg's primary coach throughout his professional career) cautioned against anyone trying to change Borg's rough-looking, jerky strokes.

At the age of 15 Borg represented Sweden in the 1972 <a href="Davis%20Cup">Davis Cup</a> and won his debut singles <a href="rubber">rubber</a> in five sets against veteran <a href="Onny%20Parun">Onny Parun</a> of <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>. Later that year, he won the Wimbledon junior singles title, recovering from a 5–2 deficit in the final set to overcome Britain's <a href="Buster%20Mottram">Buster Mottram</a>. Then in December he won the <a href="Dunlop%20Orange%20Bowl">Orange Bowl Junior Championship</a> for boys, 18 and under after a straight sets victory in the final over <a href="Vitas%20Gerulaitis">Vitas Gerulaitis</a>. Borg joined the professional circuit in 1973, and reached his first singles final in April at the <a href="1973%20Monte%20Carlo%20Open">Monte Carlo Open</a> which he lost to <a href="Ilie%20N%C4%83stase">Ilie Năstase</a>. He was unseeded at his first <a href="1973%20French%20Open">French Open</a> and reached the fourth round where he lost in four sets to eight-seeded <a href="Adriano%20Panatta">Adriano Panatta</a>. Borg was seeded sixth at his first <a href="1973%20Wimbledon%20Championships">Wimbledon Championships</a>, in large part due to a <a href="1973%20Wimbledon%20Championships%23ATP%20boycott">boycott by the ATP</a>, and reached the quarterfinal where he was defeated in a five-set match by <a href="Roger%20Taylor%20%28tennis%29">Roger Taylor</a>. In the second half of 1973 he was runner-up in <a href="1973%20Pacific%20Coast%20Open">San Francisco</a>, <a href="1973%20Stockholm%20Open">Stockholm</a> and <a href="1973%20South%20American%20Open%20%28tennis%29">Buenos Aires</a> and finished the year ranked No. 18.

Borg made his only appearance at the Australian Open, at the age of 17, and reached the third round where he lost in straight sets to eventual finalist <a href="Phil%20Dent">Phil Dent</a>. In January he won his first career singles title at the <a href="1974%20New%20Zealand%20Open">New Zealand Open</a>, followed by titles in <a href="1974%20Rothmans%20International%20Tennis%20Tournament">London</a> and <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20WCT">São Paulo</a> in February and March respectively. Just before his 18th birthday in June 1974, Borg won his first top-level singles title at the <a href="Rome%20Masters">Italian Open</a>, defeating defending champion and top-seeded <a href="Ilie%20N%C4%83stase">Ilie Năstase</a> in the final and becoming its youngest winner. Two weeks later he won the singles title at the <a href="French%20Open">French Open</a>, his first <a href="Grand%20Slam%20%28tennis%29">Grand Slam</a> tournament title, defeating <a href="Manuel%20Orantes">Manuel Orantes</a> in the final in five sets. Barely 18, Borg was the youngest-ever male French Open champion up to that point.

In early 1975, Borg defeated <a href="Rod%20Laver">Rod Laver</a>, then 36 years old, in a semifinal of the <a href="World%20Championship%20Tennis">World Championship Tennis</a> (WCT) finals in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, Texas, in five sets. Borg subsequently lost to <a href="Arthur%20Ashe">Arthur Ashe</a> in the final.
Borg retained his French Open title in 1975, beating <a href="Guillermo%20Vilas">Guillermo Vilas</a> in the final in straight sets. Borg then reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals, where he lost to eventual champion Ashe. Borg did not lose another match at Wimbledon until 1981. Borg won two singles and one doubles rubber in the 1975 Davis Cup final, as Sweden beat <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> 3–2. With these singles wins, Borg had won 19 consecutive Davis Cup singles rubbers since 1973. That was already a record at the time. However, Borg never lost another Davis Cup singles rubber, and, by the end of his career, he had stretched that winning streak to 33.

In early 1976, Borg won the <a href="World%20Championship%20Tennis">World Championship Tennis</a> year-end <a href="WCT%20Finals">WCT Finals</a> in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, Texas, with a four-set victory over <a href="Guillermo%20Vilas">Guillermo Vilas</a> in the final. At the 1976 French Open, Borg lost to the Italian <a href="Adriano%20Panatta">Adriano Panatta</a>, who remains the only player to defeat Borg at this tournament. Panatta did it twice: in the fourth round in 1973, and in the 1976 quarterfinals. Borg won Wimbledon in 1976 without losing a set, defeating the favored <a href="Ilie%20N%C4%83stase">Ilie Năstase</a> in the final. Borg became the youngest male Wimbledon champion of the modern era at 20 years and 1 month (a record subsequently broken by <a href="Boris%20Becker">Boris Becker</a>, who won Wimbledon aged 17 in 1985). It would be the last time Borg played Wimbledon as an underdog. Năstase later exclaimed, "We're playing tennis, he's [Borg] playing something else." Borg also reached the final of the 1976 <a href="U.S.%20Open%20%28tennis%29">US Open</a>, which was then being played on clay courts. Borg lost in four sets to world no. 1 <a href="Jimmy%20Connors">Jimmy Connors</a>.

In February 1977 <a href="World%20Championship%20Tennis">World Championship Tennis</a> (WCT) sued Borg and his management company <a href="IMG%20%28company%29">IMG</a> claiming that Borg had committed a breach of contract by electing to participate in the competing <a href="1977%20Grand%20Prix%20%28tennis%29">1977 Grand Prix circuit</a> instead of the <a href="1977%20World%20Championship%20Tennis%20circuit">WCT circuit</a>. Borg eventually played, and won, a single WCT event, the Monte Carlo WCT. An out-of-court settlement was reached whereby Borg committed to play six or eight WCT events in 1978 which were then part of the <a href="1978%20Grand%20Prix%20%28tennis%29">Grand Prix circuit</a>.

Borg skipped the French Open in 1977 because he was under contract with <a href="World%20Team%20Tennis">WTT</a>, but he repeated his Wimbledon triumph, although this time he was pushed much harder. He defeated his good friend <a href="Vitas%20Gerulaitis">Vitas Gerulaitis</a> in a semifinal in five sets. In the final, Borg was pushed to five sets for the third time in the tournament, this time by Connors. The win propelled Borg to the no. 1 ranking on the computer, albeit for just one week in August. Prior to the 1977 US Open, Borg aggravated a shoulder injury while waterskiing with Vitas Gerulaitis. This injury ultimately forced him to retire from the Open during a Round of 16 match vs Dick Stockton. Through 1977, he had never lost to a player younger than himself.

Borg was at the height of his career from 1978 through 1980, completing the difficult French Open-Wimbledon double all three years. In 1978, Borg won the French Open with a win over Vilas in the final. Borg did not drop a set during the tournament, a feat only he, Năstase (in 1973), and <a href="Rafael%20Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> (in 2008, 2010 and 2017) have accomplished at the French Open during the open era. Borg defeated Connors in straight sets at the 1978 Wimbledon. At the US Open, now held on hard courts in Flushing Meadow, New York, he lost the final in straight sets to Connors. Borg was suffering from a bad blister on his thumb that required pre-match injections. That autumn, Borg faced <a href="John%20McEnroe">John McEnroe</a> for the first time in a semifinal of the Stockholm Open, and lost to McEnroe.
Borg lost to McEnroe again in four sets in the final of the 1979 WCT Finals but was now overtaking Connors for the top ranking. Borg established himself firmly in the top spot with his fourth French Open singles title and fourth straight Wimbledon singles title, defeating Connors in a straight-set semifinal at the latter tournament. At the French Open, Borg defeated big-serving <a href="Victor%20Pecci">Victor Pecci</a> in a four-set final, and at Wimbledon, Borg took five sets to overcome an even bigger server, <a href="Roscoe%20Tanner">Roscoe Tanner</a>. Borg was upset by Tanner at the US Open, in a four-set quarterfinal played under the lights. At the season-ending <a href="Tennis%20Masters%20Cup">Masters</a> tournament in January 1980, Borg survived a close semifinal against McEnroe. He then beat Gerulaitis in straight sets, winning his first Masters and first title in New York.

In June, he overcame Gerulaitis, again in straight sets, for his fifth French Open title. Again, he did not drop a set.

Borg won his fifth consecutive Wimbledon singles title, the <a href="1980%20Wimbledon%20Men%27s%20Singles%20final">1980 Wimbledon Men's Singles final</a>, by defeating McEnroe in a five-set match, often cited as the best Wimbledon final ever played – the only comparable match being the Federer – Nadal final in 2008. Having lost the opening set to an all-out McEnroe assault, Borg took the next two and had two championship points at 5–4 in the fourth. However, McEnroe averted disaster and went on to level the match in Wimbledon's most memorable 34-point tiebreaker, which he won 18–16. In the fourth-set tiebreak, McEnroe saved five match points, and Borg six set points, before McEnroe won the set. Björn served first to begin the 5th set and fell behind 15–40. Borg then won 19 straight points on serve in the deciding set and prevailed after 3 hours, 53 minutes. Borg himself commented years later that this was the first time that he was afraid that he would lose, as well as feeling that it was the beginning of the end of his dominance.

He defeated McEnroe in the final of the 1980 Stockholm Open, and faced him one more time that year, in the round-robin portion of the year-end Masters, played in January 1981. With 19,103 fans in attendance, Borg won a deciding third-set tie-break for the second year in a row. Borg then defeated <a href="Ivan%20Lendl">Ivan Lendl</a> for his second Masters title.

Borg won his last Grand Slam title at the French Open in 1981, defeating Lendl in a five-set final. Borg's six French Open Grand Slam titles was a record bettered only by <a href="Rafael%20Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> in 2012.

In reaching the Wimbledon final in 1981, Borg stretched his winning streak at the <a href="All%20England%20Club">All England Club</a> to a record 41 matches. In a semifinal, Borg was down to Connors by two sets to love, before coming back to win the match. However, Borg's streak was brought to an end by McEnroe, who defeated him in four sets. Years afterward, Borg remarked "And when I lost what shocked me was I wasn't even upset. That was not me: losing a Wimbledon final and not upset. I hate to lose." Borg around that time felt that his desire to play was gone, despite McEnroe's desperate efforts to persuade him not to retire and continue their rivalry.

Borg went on to lose to McEnroe at the 1981 US Open. After that defeat, Borg walked off the court and out of the stadium before the ceremonies and press conference had begun, and headed straight for the airport. There are reports that Borg received threats after his semifinal win over Connors. In later years, Borg apologized to McEnroe. The 1981 US Open would be the Swede's last Grand Slam final. Major tournaments and tour organizers were enforcing a new rule; by 1982, that players had to play at least 10 official tournaments per year. However, Borg wanted to curtail his schedule after many years of winning so often. Although he felt in good condition physically, he recognized that the relentless drive to win and defy tour organizers had begun to fade.

Borg failed to win the US Open in 10 tries, losing four finals, 1976 and 1978 to <a href="Jimmy%20Connors">Jimmy Connors</a>, and 1980 and 1981 to McEnroe. He played on hard courts at the US Open from 1978 to 1981 and reached the final there on three occasions, in 1978, 1980 and 1981. He led 3–2 in the fifth set of the 1980 final, before losing. That match followed Borg's classic encounter with McEnroe at the 1980 Wimbledon. In 1978, 1979 and 1980, Borg was halfway to a Grand Slam after victories at the French and Wimbledon (the Australian Open being the last Grand Slam tournament of each year at the time) only to falter at Flushing Meadow, lefty Tanner his conqueror in 1979.

In 1982, Borg played only one tournament, losing to <a href="Yannick%20Noah">Yannick Noah</a> in the quarterfinals of <a href="Monte%20Carlo%20Masters">Monte Carlo</a> in April. Nevertheless, Borg's announcement in January 1983 that he was retiring from the game at the age of 26 was a shock to the tennis world. McEnroe tried unsuccessfully to persuade Borg to continue. He did, however, play Monte Carlo again in March 1983, reaching the second round, and Stuttgart in July 1984.

Upon retirement, Borg had three residences, a penthouse in Monte Carlo, not far from his <a href="pro%20shop">pro shop</a>, a mansion on Long Island, New York and a small island off the Swedish coast.

Borg later bounced back as the owner of the Björn Borg fashion label. In Sweden his label has become very successful, second only to <a href="Calvin%20Klein">Calvin Klein</a>.

From 1991–1993, Borg attempted a comeback on the men's professional tennis tour, coached by a Welsh karate expert named Ron Thatcher (aka Tai Honsai). Before his 1991 return, Borg grew his hair out as it had been during his previous professional tennis career and he returned to using a wooden racket; he had kept his hair cut and used modern graphite rackets in exhibitions he played during the late 1980s. Borg, however, failed to win a single match. He faced <a href="Jordi%20Arrese">Jordi Arrese</a> in his first match back, again at Monte Carlo but without practising or playing any exhibition matches, and fell in two sets. In his first nine matches, played in 1991 and 1992, Borg failed to win a single set. He fared slightly better in 1993, taking a set off his opponent in each of the three matches he played. He came closest to getting a win in what turned out to be his final tour match, falling to <a href="Alexander%20Volkov%20%28tennis%29">Alexander Volkov</a>.

In 1992 Borg, aged 35, using a Donnay Graphite Midsize racket strung at 85 <a href="pound%20%28force%29">lbf</a> tension, defeated <a href="John%20Lloyd%20%28tennis%29">John Lloyd</a>, 37, at the Inglewood Forum Tennis Challenge. Borg later joined the champions tour, returning to shorter hair and using modern rackets.

Borg married Romanian tennis pro <a href="Mariana%20Simionescu">Mariana Simionescu</a> in <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a> on 24 July 1980. The marriage ended in divorce in 1984. He fathered a child by the Swedish model Jannike Björling, and he was married to the Italian singer <a href="Loredana%20Bert%C3%A9">Loredana Berté</a> from 1989 to 1993. In 2002, Borg married for a third time, wedding Patricia Östfeld on 8 June.

He narrowly avoided personal bankruptcy when business ventures failed.

In March 2006, <a href="Bonhams">Bonhams</a> Auction House in London announced that it would auction Borg's Wimbledon trophies and two of his winning rackets on 21 June 2006. Several players then called Borg in an attempt to make him reconsider, including Jimmy Connors and Andre Agassi who volunteered to buy them to keep them together. According to "<a href="Dagens%20Nyheter">Dagens Nyheter</a>" – who had talked to Borg – McEnroe called Borg from New York and asked, "What's up? Have you gone mad?" and said "What the hell are you doing?" The conversation with McEnroe, paired with pleas from Connors and Agassi, eventually persuaded Borg to buy out the trophies from Bonhams for an undisclosed amount.


With 11 Grand Slam titles, Borg ranks sixth in the list of male tennis players who have won the most Grand Slam singles titles behind <a href="Roger%20Federer">Roger Federer</a> (19), <a href="Rafael%20Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a> (16), <a href="Pete%20Sampras">Pete Sampras</a> (14), <a href="Roy%20Emerson">Roy Emerson</a> (12), and <a href="Novak%20Djokovic">Novak Djokovic</a> (12). The French Open—Wimbledon double he achieved three times consecutively was called by Wimbledon officials "the most difficult double in tennis" and "a feat considered impossible among today's players." Only Nadal (in 2008 and 2010) and Federer (in 2009) have managed to achieve this double since, and <a href="Andre%20Agassi">Andre Agassi</a>, Nadal, Federer and Djokovic are the only male players since Borg to have won the French Open and Wimbledon men's singles titles over their career. <a href="Ilie%20N%C4%83stase">Ilie Năstase</a> once said about Borg, "We're playing tennis, and he's playing something else".

In his 1979 autobiography, <a href="Jack%20Kramer%20%28tennis%20player%29">Jack Kramer</a>, the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, had already included Borg in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time. And in 2003, <a href="Bud%20Collins">Bud Collins</a> chose Borg as one of his top-five male players of all time.

In 2008, <a href="ESPN.com">ESPN.com</a> asked tennis analysts, writers, and former players to build the perfect open era player. Borg was the only player mentioned in four categories: defense, footwork, intangibles, and mental toughness—with his mental game and footwork singled out as the best in open era history.

Borg famously never won the <a href="US%20Open%20%28tennis%29">US Open</a>, losing in the final four times. Borg also never won the Australian Open, as he only played in the event once, in 1974 as a 17-year-old. The only players to defeat Borg in a Grand Slam final were fellow World No. 1 tennis players <a href="John%20McEnroe">John McEnroe</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Connors">Jimmy Connors</a>. Even though it was then played on grass, a surface where he enjoyed much success, Borg chose to play the Australian Open only once, in 1974, where he lost in the third round. <a href="Phil%20Dent">Phil Dent</a>, a contemporary of Borg, has pointed out that skipping Grand Slam tournaments—especially the Australian Open—was not unusual then, before counting Grand Slam titles became the norm. Additionally, another contemporary <a href="Arthur%20Ashe">Arthur Ashe</a> told "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>", "I think Bjorn could have won the U.S. Open. I think he could have won the Grand Slam, but by the time he left, the historical challenge didn't mean anything. He was bigger than the game. He was like <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis</a> or <a href="Liz%20Taylor">Liz Taylor</a> or somebody."

Borg had one of the most distinctive playing styles in the Open Era. He played from the baseline, with powerful ground-strokes. His highly unorthodox backhand involved taking his racket back with both hands but actually generating his power with his dominant right hand, letting go of the grip with his left hand around point of contact, and following through with his swing as a one-hander. He hit the ball hard and high from the back of the court and brought it down with considerable <a href="topspin">topspin</a>, which made his ground strokes very consistent. There had been other players, particularly <a href="Rod%20Laver">Rod Laver</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Ashe">Arthur Ashe</a>, who played with topspin on both the forehand and backhand, yet Laver and Ashe used topspin only as a way to mix up their shots to pass their opponents at the net easily. Borg was one of the first top players to use heavy topspin on his shots consistently.

Complementing his consistent ground-strokes was his fitness. Both of these factors allowed Borg to be dominant at the French Open.

One of the factors that made Borg unique was his dominance on the grass courts of Wimbledon, where baseliners since World War II did not usually succeed. Some experts attributed his dominance on this surface to his consistency, an underrated serve, equally underrated volleys, and his adaptation to grass courts. Against the best players, he almost always served-and-volleyed on his first serves (but he naturally played from the baseline after his second serves).

Another trait usually associated with Borg is his grace under pressure. His calm court demeanor earned him the nickname of the "Ice Man" or "Ice-Borg."

Borg's physical conditioning was legendary and unrivalled. He could outlast most of his opponents under the most grueling conditions. Contrary to popular belief, however, this wasn't due to his exceptionally low resting heart rate, often reported to be near 35 beats per minute. In his introduction to Borg's autobiography "My Life and Game", Eugene Scott relates that this rumor arose from a medical exam the 18-year-old Borg once took for military service, where his pulse was recorded as 38. Scott goes on to reveal Borg's true pulse rate as "about 50 when he wakes up and around 60 in the afternoon." Borg is credited with helping to develop the style of play that has come to dominate the game today.

From 22–24 September 2017, Borg was the victorious captain of Team Europe in the first ever edition of the <a href="2017%20Laver%20Cup">Laver Cup</a>, held in <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>. Borg's Team Europe defeated a rest of the world team, known as Team World, who were coached by Borg's old rival, <a href="John%20McEnroe">John McEnroe</a>. Europe won the contest 15 points to 9, with <a href="Roger%20Federer">Roger Federer</a> achieving a narrow vital victory over <a href="Nick%20Kyrgios">Nick Kyrgios</a> in the last match played.

Battle of the Nile

The Battle of the Nile (also known as the Battle of Aboukir Bay; ; ) was a major naval battle fought between the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> and the Navy of the <a href="French%20First%20Republic">French Republic</a> at <a href="Aboukir%20Bay">Aboukir Bay</a> on the Mediterranean coast off the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a> of <a href="Egypt%20Eyalet">Egypt</a> from 1 to 3 August 1798. The battle was the climax of a <a href="Mediterranean%20campaign%20of%201798">naval campaign</a> that had ranged across the Mediterranean during the previous three months, as a large French convoy sailed from <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a> to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> carrying an expeditionary force under General <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>. The British fleet was led in the battle by Rear-Admiral Sir <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a>; they decisively defeated the French under Vice-Admiral <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Paul%20Brueys%20d%27Aigalliers">François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers</a>.

Bonaparte sought to invade Egypt as the first step in a campaign against <a href="British%20India">British India</a>, part of a greater effort to drive Britain out of the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>. As Bonaparte's fleet crossed the Mediterranean, it was pursued by a British force under Nelson who had been sent from the British fleet in the <a href="Tagus">Tagus</a> to learn the purpose of the French expedition and to defeat it. He chased the French for more than two months, on several occasions only missing them by a matter of hours. Bonaparte was aware of Nelson's pursuit and enforced absolute secrecy about his destination. He was able to capture <a href="Malta">Malta</a> and then land in Egypt without interception by the British naval forces.

With the French army ashore, the French fleet anchored in Aboukir Bay, northeast of Alexandria. Commander Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers believed that he had established a formidable defensive position. The British fleet arrived off Egypt on 1 August and discovered Brueys's dispositions, and Nelson ordered an immediate attack. His ships advanced on the French line and split into two divisions as they approached. One cut across the head of the line and passed between the anchored French and the shore, while the other engaged the seaward side of the French fleet. Trapped in a crossfire, the leading French warships were battered into surrender during a fierce three-hour battle, while the centre succeeded in repelling the initial British attack. As British reinforcements arrived, the centre came under renewed assault and, at 22:00, the French flagship <a href="French%20ship%20Orient%20%281791%29">"Orient"</a> exploded. The rear division of the French fleet attempted to break out of the bay, with Brueys dead and his <a href="vanguard">vanguard</a> and centre defeated, but only two <a href="ships%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a> and two <a href="frigate">frigate</a>s escaped from a total of 17 ships engaged.

The battle reversed the strategic situation between the two nations' forces in the Mediterranean and entrenched the Royal Navy in the dominant position that it retained for the rest of the war. It also encouraged other European countries to turn against France, and was a factor in the outbreak of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Second%20Coalition">War of the Second Coalition</a>. Bonaparte's army was trapped in Egypt, and Royal Navy dominance off the Syrian coast contributed significantly to its defeat at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Acre%20%281799%29">Siege of Acre</a> in 1799 which preceded Bonaparte's return to Europe. Nelson had been wounded in the battle, but he was proclaimed a hero across Europe and was subsequently made <a href="Baron%20Nelson">Baron Nelson</a>—although he was privately dissatisfied with his rewards. His captains were also highly praised and went on to form the nucleus of the legendary <a href="Nelson%27s%20Band%20of%20Brothers">Nelson's Band of Brothers</a>. The legend of the battle has remained prominent in the popular consciousness, with perhaps the best-known representation being <a href="Felicia%20Hemans">Felicia Hemans</a>' 1826 poem "<a href="Casabianca%20%28poem%29">Casabianca</a>".

<a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>'s victories in northern Italy over the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a> helped secure victory for the French in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition">War of the First Coalition</a> in 1797, and Great Britain remained the only major European power still at war with the <a href="French%20First%20Republic">French Republic</a>. The <a href="French%20Directory">French Directory</a> investigated a number of strategic options to counter British opposition, including projected invasions of Ireland and Britain and the expansion of the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> to challenge the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> at sea. Despite significant efforts, British control of Northern European waters rendered these ambitions impractical in the short term, and the Royal Navy remained firmly in control of the Atlantic Ocean. However, the French navy was dominant in the Mediterranean, following the withdrawal of the British fleet after the outbreak of war between Britain and Spain in 1796. This allowed Bonaparte to propose an <a href="Napoleonic%20Campaign%20in%20Egypt">invasion of Egypt</a> as an alternative to confronting Britain directly, believing that the British would be too distracted by an imminent <a href="Irish%20Rebellion%20of%201798">Irish uprising</a> to intervene in the Mediterranean.

Bonaparte believed that, by establishing a permanent presence in Egypt (nominally part of the neutral <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>), the French would obtain a staging point for future operations against <a href="British%20India">British India</a>, possibly in conjunction with the <a href="Tipu%20Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a> of <a href="Seringapatam">Seringapatam</a>, that might successfully drive the British out of the war. The campaign would sever the chain of communication that connected Britain with India, an essential part of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> whose trade generated the wealth that Britain required to prosecute the war successfully. The French Directory agreed with Bonaparte's plans, although a major factor in their decision was a desire to see the politically ambitious Bonaparte and the fiercely loyal veterans of his Italian campaigns travel as far from France as possible. During the spring of 1798, Bonaparte assembled more than 35,000 soldiers in Mediterranean France and Italy and developed a powerful fleet at <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a>. He also formed the "<a href="Commission%20des%20Sciences%20et%20des%20Arts">Commission des Sciences et des Arts</a>", a body of scientists and engineers intended to establish a French colony in Egypt. Napoleon kept the destination of the expedition top secret—most of the army's officers did not know of its target, and Bonaparte did not publicly reveal his goal until the first stage of the expedition was complete.

Bonaparte's armada sailed from Toulon on 19 May 1798, making rapid progress through the <a href="Ligurian%20Sea">Ligurian Sea</a> and collecting more ships at <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>, before sailing southwards along the <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>n coast and passing <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> on 7 June. On 9 June, the fleet arrived off <a href="Malta">Malta</a>, then under the ownership of the <a href="Knights%20of%20St.%20John%20of%20Jerusalem">Knights of St. John of Jerusalem</a>, ruled by <a href="List%20of%20Grand%20Masters%20of%20the%20Knights%20Hospitaller">Grand Master</a> <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Hompesch%20zu%20Bolheim">Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim</a>. Bonaparte demanded that his fleet be permitted entry to the fortified harbour of <a href="Valletta">Valletta</a>. When the Knights refused, the French general responded by ordering a large scale invasion of the Maltese Islands, overrunning the defenders after 24 hours of skirmishing. The Knights formally surrendered on 12 June and, in exchange for substantial financial compensation, handed the islands and all of their resources over to Bonaparte, including the extensive property of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> on Malta. Within a week, Bonaparte had resupplied his ships, and on 19 June, his fleet departed for <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in the direction of <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, leaving 4,000 men at Valletta under General <a href="Claude-Henri%20Belgrand%20de%20Vaubois">Claude-Henri Vaubois</a> to ensure French control of the islands.

While Bonaparte was sailing to Malta, the Royal Navy re-entered the Mediterranean for the first time in more than a year. Alarmed by reports of French preparations on the Mediterranean coast, <a href="George%20Spencer%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Spencer">Lord Spencer</a> at the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> sent a message to Vice-Admiral <a href="John%20Jervis%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20St%20Vincent">Earl St. Vincent</a>, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet based in the <a href="Tagus%20River">Tagus River</a>, to despatch a squadron to investigate. This squadron, consisting of three <a href="Ship%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a> and three <a href="frigates">frigates</a>, was entrusted to Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson.

Nelson was a highly experienced officer who had been blinded in one eye during fighting in <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a> in 1794 and subsequently commended for his capture of two Spanish <a href="ships%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20St.%20Vincent%20%281797%29">Battle of Cape St. Vincent</a> in February 1797. In July 1797, he lost an arm at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Santa%20Cruz%20de%20Tenerife%20%281797%29">Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife</a> and had been forced to return to Britain to recuperate. Returning to the fleet at the Tagus in late April 1798, he was ordered to collect the squadron stationed at <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> and sail for the Ligurian Sea. On 21 May, as Nelson's squadron approached Toulon, it was struck by a fierce gale and Nelson's flagship, <a href="HMS%20Vanguard%20%281787%29">HMS "Vanguard"</a>, lost its topmasts and was almost wrecked on the Corsican coast. The remainder of the squadron was scattered. The ships of the line sheltered at <a href="San%20Pietro%20Island">San Pietro Island</a> off Sardinia; the frigates were blown to the west and failed to return.

On 7 June, following hasty repairs to his flagship, a fleet consisting of ten ships of the line and a <a href="fourth-rate">fourth-rate</a> joined Nelson off Toulon. The fleet, under the command of Captain <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Troubridge%2C%201st%20Baronet">Thomas Troubridge</a>, had been sent by Earl St. Vincent to reinforce Nelson, with orders that he was to pursue and intercept the Toulon convoy. Although he now had enough ships to challenge the French fleet, Nelson suffered two great disadvantages: He had no intelligence regarding the destination of the French, and no frigates to scout ahead of his force. Striking southwards in the hope of collecting information about French movements, Nelson's ships stopped at <a href="Elba">Elba</a> and <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, where the British ambassador, <a href="William%20Hamilton%20%28diplomat%29">Sir William Hamilton</a>, reported that the French fleet had passed Sicily headed in the direction of Malta. Despite pleas from Nelson and Hamilton, <a href="Ferdinand%20I%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies">King Ferdinand of Naples</a> refused to lend his frigates to the British fleet, fearing French reprisals. On 22 June, a brig sailing from <a href="Dubrovnik">Ragusa</a> brought Nelson the news that the French had sailed eastwards from Malta on 16 June. After conferring with his captains, the admiral decided that the French target must be Egypt and set off in pursuit. Incorrectly believing the French to be five days ahead rather than two, Nelson insisted on a direct route to Alexandria without deviation.

On the evening of 22 June, Nelson's fleet passed the French in the darkness, overtaking the slow invasion convoy without realising how close they were to their target. Making rapid time on a direct route, Nelson reached Alexandria on 28 June and discovered that the French were not there. After a meeting with the suspicious Ottoman commander, Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim, Nelson ordered the British fleet northwards, reaching the coast of <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> on 4 July and turning westwards back towards Sicily. Nelson had missed the French by less than a day—the scouts of the French fleet arrived off Alexandria in the evening of 29 June.

Concerned by his near encounter with Nelson, Bonaparte ordered an immediate invasion, his troops coming ashore in a poorly managed <a href="amphibious%20operation">amphibious operation</a> in which at least 20 drowned. Marching along the coast, the French army stormed Alexandria and captured the city, after which Bonaparte led the main force of his army inland. He instructed his naval commander, Vice-Admiral <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Paul%20Brueys%20D%27Aigalliers">François-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers</a>, to anchor in Alexandria harbour, but naval surveyors reported that the channel into the harbour was too shallow and narrow for the larger ships of the French fleet. As a result, the French selected an alternative anchorage at <a href="Aboukir%20Bay">Aboukir Bay</a>, northeast of Alexandria.

Nelson's fleet reached <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a> in Sicily on 19 July and took on essential supplies. There the admiral wrote letters describing the events of the previous months: "It is an old saying, 'the Devil's children have the Devil's luck.' I cannot find, or at this moment learn, beyond vague conjecture where the French fleet are gone to. All my ill fortune, hitherto, has proceeded from want of frigates." Meanwhile, the French were securing Egypt by the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Pyramids">Battle of the Pyramids</a>. By 24 July, the British fleet was resupplied and, having determined that the French must be somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean, Nelson sailed again in the direction of the <a href="Morea">Morea</a>. On 28 July, at <a href="Koroni">Coron</a>, Nelson finally obtained intelligence describing the French attack on Egypt and turned south across the Mediterranean. His scouts, <a href="HMS%20Alexander%20%281778%29">HMS "Alexander"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Swiftsure%20%281787%29">HMS "Swiftsure"</a>, sighted the French transport fleet at Alexandria on the afternoon of 1 August.

When Alexandria harbour had proved inadequate for his fleet, Brueys had gathered his captains and discussed their options. Bonaparte had ordered the fleet to anchor in Aboukir Bay, a shallow and exposed anchorage, but had supplemented the orders with the suggestion that, if Aboukir Bay was too dangerous, Brueys could sail north to <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a>, leaving only the transports and a handful of lighter warships at Alexandria. Brueys refused, in the belief that his squadron could provide essential support to the French army on shore, and called his captains aboard his 120-gun flagship "<a href="French%20ship%20Orient%20%281791%29">Orient</a>" to discuss their response should Nelson discover the fleet in its anchorage. Despite vocal opposition from <a href="Contre-amiral">Contre-amiral</a> <a href="Armand%20Blanquet">Armand Blanquet</a>, who insisted that the fleet would be best able to respond in open water, the rest of the captains agreed that anchoring in a <a href="line%20of%20battle">line of battle</a> inside the bay presented the strongest tactic for confronting Nelson. It is possible that Bonaparte envisaged Aboukir Bay as a temporary anchorage: on 27 July, he expressed the expectation that Brueys had already transferred his ships to Alexandria, and three days later, he issued orders for the fleet to make for Corfu in preparation for naval operations against the Ottoman territories in the Balkans, although <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> <a href="Irregular%20military">partisans</a> intercepted and killed the courier carrying the instructions. 

Aboukir Bay is a coastal indentation across, stretching from the village of <a href="Abu%20Qir">Abu Qir</a> in the west to the town of <a href="Rosetta">Rosetta</a> to the east, where one of the mouths of the <a href="River%20Nile">River Nile</a> empties into the Mediterranean. In 1798, the bay was protected at its western end by extensive rocky shoals which ran into the bay from a <a href="promontory">promontory</a> guarded by Aboukir Castle. A small fort situated on <a href="Nelson%27s%20Island">an island</a> among the rocks protected the shoals. The fort was garrisoned by French soldiers and armed with at least four cannon and two heavy <a href="mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortars</a>. Brueys had augmented the fort with his <a href="bomb%20vessel">bomb vessel</a>s and <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a>s, anchored among the rocks to the west of the island in a position to give support to the head of the French line. Further shoals ran unevenly to the south of the island and extended across the bay in a rough semicircle approximately from the shore. These shoals were too shallow to permit the passage of larger warships, and so Brueys ordered his thirteen ships of the line to form up in a line of battle following the northeastern edge of the shoals to the south of the island, a position that allowed the ships to disembark supplies from their port sides while covering the landings with their starboard batteries. Orders were issued for each ship to attach strong cables to the bow and stern of their neighbours, which would effectively turn the line into a long battery forming a theoretically impregnable barrier. Brueys positioned a second, inner line of four frigates approximately west of the main line, roughly halfway between the line and the shoal. The van of the French line was led by "<a href="French%20ship%20Guerrier%20%281754%29">Guerrier</a>", positioned southeast of Aboukir Island and about from the edge of the shoals that surrounded the island. The line stretched southeast, with the centre bowed seawards away from the shoal. The French ships were spaced at intervals of and the whole line was long, with the flagship "Orient" at the centre and two large 80-gun ships anchored on either side. The rear division of the line was under the command of Contre-amiral <a href="Pierre-Charles%20Villeneuve">Pierre-Charles Villeneuve</a> in "<a href="French%20ship%20Guillaume%20Tell%20%281795%29">Guillaume Tell</a>".

In deploying his ships in this way, Brueys hoped that the British would be forced by the shoals to attack his strong centre and rear, allowing his van to use the prevailing northeasterly wind to counterattack the British once they were engaged. However, he had made a serious misjudgement: he had left enough room between "Guerrier" and the shoals for an enemy ship to cut across the head of the French line and proceed between the shoals and the French ships, allowing the unsupported vanguard to be caught in a crossfire by two divisions of enemy ships. Compounding this error, the French only prepared their ships for battle on their starboard (seaward) sides, from which they expected the attack would have to come; their landward port sides were unprepared.
The port side gun ports were closed, and the decks on that side were uncleared, with various stored items blocking access to the guns. Brueys' dispositions had a second significant flaw: The 160-yard gaps between ships were large enough for a British ship to push through and break the French line. Furthermore, not all of the French captains had followed Brueys' orders to attach cables to their neighbours' bow and stern, which would have prevented such a manoeuvre. The problem was exacerbated by orders to only anchor at the bow, which allowed the ships to swing with the wind and widened the gaps. It also created areas within the French line not covered by the broadside of any ship. British vessels could anchor in those spaces and engage the French without reply. In addition, the deployment of Brueys' fleet prevented the rear from effectively supporting the van due to the prevailing winds.

A more pressing problem for Brueys was a lack of food and water for the fleet: Bonaparte had unloaded almost all of the provisions carried aboard and no supplies were reaching the ships from the shore. To remedy this, Brueys sent foraging parties of 25 men from each ship along the coast to requisition food, dig wells, and collect water. Constant attacks by Bedouin partisans, however, required escorts of heavily armed guards for each party. Hence, up to a third of the fleet's sailors were away from their ships at any one time. Brueys wrote a letter describing the situation to <a href="List%20of%20Naval%20Ministers%20of%20France">Minister of Marine</a> <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Eustache%20Bruix">Étienne Eustache Bruix</a>, reporting that "Our crews are weak, both in number and quality. Our rigging, in general, out of repair, and I am sure it requires no little courage to undertake the management of a fleet furnished with such tools."

Although initially disappointed that the main French fleet was not at Alexandria, Nelson knew from the presence of the transports that they must be nearby. At 14:00 on 1 August, lookouts on <a href="HMS%20Zealous%20%281785%29">HMS "Zealous"</a> reported the French anchored in Aboukir Bay, its signal lieutenant just beating the lieutenant on <a href="HMS%20Goliath%20%281781%29">HMS "Goliath"</a> with the signal, but inaccurately describing 16 French ships of the line instead of 13. At the same time, French lookouts on "<a href="French%20ship%20Heureux%20%281782%29">Heureux</a>", the ninth ship in the French line, sighted the British fleet approximately nine nautical miles off the mouth of Aboukir Bay. The French initially reported just 11 British ships – "Swiftsure" and "Alexander" were still returning from their scouting operations at Alexandria, and so were to the west of the main fleet, out of sight. Troubridge's ship, <a href="HMS%20Culloden%20%281783%29">HMS "Culloden"</a>"," was also some distance from the main body, towing a captured merchant ship. At the sight of the French, Troubridge abandoned the vessel and made strenuous efforts to rejoin Nelson. Due to the need for so many sailors to work onshore, Brueys had not deployed any of his lighter warships as scouts, which left him unable to react swiftly to the sudden appearance of the British.

As his ships readied for action, Brueys ordered his captains to gather for a conference on "Orient" and hastily recalled his shore parties, although most had still not returned by the start of the battle. To replace them, large numbers of men were taken out of the frigates and distributed among the ships of the line. Brueys also hoped to lure the British fleet onto the shoals at Aboukir Island, sending the brigs "<a href="French%20brig%20Alerte%20%281787%29">Alerte</a>" and "Railleur" to act as decoys in the shallow waters. By 16:00, "Alexander" and "Swiftsure" were also in sight, although some distance from the main British fleet. Brueys gave orders to abandon the plan to remain at anchor and instead for his line to set sail. Blanquet protested the order on the grounds that there were not enough men aboard the French ships to both sail the ships and man the guns. Nelson gave orders for his leading ships to slow down, to allow the British fleet to approach in a more organised formation. This convinced Brueys that rather than risk an evening battle in confined waters, the British were planning to wait for the following day. He rescinded his earlier order to sail. Brueys may have been hoping that the delay would allow him to slip past the British during the night and thus follow Bonaparte's orders not to engage the British fleet directly if he could avoid it.

Nelson ordered the fleet to slow down at 16:00 to allow his ships to rig "springs" on their anchor cables, a system of attaching the bow anchor that increased stability and allowed his ships to swing their <a href="broadside">broadside</a>s to face an enemy while stationary. It also increased manoeuvrability and therefore reduced the risk of coming under <a href="raking%20fire">raking fire</a>. Nelson's plan, shaped through discussion with his senior captains during the return voyage to Alexandria, was to advance on the French and pass down the seaward side of the van and centre of the French line, so that each French ship would face two British ships and the massive "Orient" would be fighting against three. The direction of the wind meant that the French rear division would be unable to join the battle easily and would be cut off from the front portions of the line. To ensure that in the smoke and confusion of a night battle his ships would not accidentally open fire on one another, Nelson ordered that each ship prepare four horizontal lights at the head of their <a href="mizzen">mizzen</a> mast and hoist an illuminated <a href="White%20Ensign">White Ensign</a>, which was different enough from the <a href="French%20tricolour">French tricolour</a> that it would not be mistaken in poor visibility, reducing the risk that British ships might fire on one another in the darkness. As his ship was readied for battle, Nelson held a final dinner with "Vanguard"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s officers, announcing as he rose: "Before this time tomorrow I shall have gained a <a href="peerage%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">peerage</a> or <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>," in reference to the rewards of victory or the traditional burial place of British military heroes.
Shortly after the French order to set sail was abandoned, the British fleet began rapidly approaching once more. Brueys, now expecting to come under attack that night, ordered each of his ships to place springs on their anchor cables and prepare for action. He sent the "Alerte" ahead, which passed close to the leading British ships and then steered sharply to the west over the shoal, in the hope that the ships of the line might follow and become grounded. None of Nelson's captains fell for the ruse and the British fleet continued undeterred. At 17:30, Nelson hailed one of his two leading ships, HMS "Zealous" under Captain <a href="Sir%20Samuel%20Hood%2C%201st%20Baronet">Samuel Hood</a>, which had been racing "Goliath" to be the first to fire on the French. The admiral ordered Hood to establish the safest course into the harbour. The British had no charts of the depth or shape of the bay, except a rough sketch map "Swiftsure" had obtained from a merchant captain, an inaccurate British atlas on "Zealous", and a 35-year-old French map aboard "Goliath". Hood replied that he would take careful <a href="Depth%20sounding">soundings</a> as he advanced to test the depth of the water, and that, "If you will allow the honour of leading you into battle, I will keep the lead going." Shortly afterwards, Nelson paused to speak with the brig <a href="HMS%20Mutine%20%281797%29">HMS "Mutine"</a>, whose commander, Lieutenant <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Hardy%2C%201st%20Baronet">Thomas Hardy</a>, had seized some <a href="maritime%20pilots">maritime pilots</a> from a small Alexandrine vessel. As "Vanguard" came to a stop, the following ships slowed. This caused a gap to open up between "Zealous" and "Goliath" and the rest of the fleet. To counter this effect, Nelson ordered <a href="HMS%20Theseus%20%281786%29">HMS "Theseus"</a> under Captain <a href="Ralph%20Willett%20Miller">Ralph Miller</a> to pass his flagship and join "Zealous" and "Goliath" in the vanguard. By 18:00, the British fleet was again under full sail, "Vanguard" sixth in the line of ten ships as "Culloden" trailed behind to the north and "Alexander" and "Swiftsure" hastened to catch up to the west. Following the rapid change from a loose formation to a rigid line of battle both fleets raised their colours; each British ship added additional <a href="Union%20Flag">Union Flag</a>s in its rigging in case its main flag was shot away. At 18:20, as "Goliath" and "Zealous" rapidly bore down on them, the leading French ships "Guerrier" and "<a href="French%20ship%20Conqu%C3%A9rant%20%281747%29">Conquérant</a>" opened fire.
Ten minutes after the French opened fire "Goliath", ignoring fire from the fort to <a href="starboard">starboard</a> and from "Guerrier" to <a href="port%20%28nautical%29">port</a>, most of which was too high to trouble the ship, crossed the head of the French line. Captain <a href="Thomas%20Foley%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Thomas Foley</a> had noticed as he approached that there was an unexpected gap between "Guerrier" and the shallow water of the shoal. On his own initiative, Foley decided to exploit this tactical error and changed his angle of approach to sail through the gap. As the bow of "Guerrier" came within range, "Goliath" opened fire, inflicting severe damage with a double-shotted raking broadside as the British ship turned to port and passed down the unprepared port side of "Guerrier." Foley's <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> and a company of Austrian grenadiers joined the attack, firing their muskets. Foley had intended to anchor alongside the French ship and engage it closely, but his anchor took too long to descend and his ship passed "Guerrier" entirely. "Goliath" eventually stopped close to the bow of "Conquérant", opening fire on the new opponent and using the unengaged starboard guns to exchange occasional shots with the frigate "<a href="French%20frigate%20S%C3%A9rieuse%20%281779%29">Sérieuse</a>" and bomb vessel "Hercule," which were anchored inshore of the battle line.

Foley's attack was followed by Hood in "Zealous", who also crossed the French line and successfully anchored next to "Guerrier" in the space Foley had intended, engaging the lead ship's bow from close range. Within five minutes "Guerrier"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s foremast had fallen, to cheers from the crews of the approaching British ships. The speed of the British advance took the French captains by surprise; they were still aboard "Orient" in conference with the admiral when the firing started. Hastily launching their boats, they returned to their vessels. Captain <a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois-Timoth%C3%A9e%20Trullet">Jean-François-Timothée Trullet</a> of "Guerrier" shouted orders from his barge for his men to return fire on "Zealous".

The third British ship into action was <a href="HMS%20Orion%20%281787%29">HMS "Orion"</a> under Captain <a href="James%20Saumarez%2C%201st%20Baron%20de%20Saumarez">Sir James Saumarez</a>, which rounded the engagement at the head of the battle line and passed between the French main line and the frigates that lay closer inshore. As he did so, the frigate "Sérieuse" opened fire on "Orion", wounding two men. The convention in naval warfare of the time was that ships of the line did not attack frigates when there were ships of equal size to engage, but in firing first French Captain <a href="Claude-Jean%20Martin">Claude-Jean Martin</a> had negated the rule. Saumarez waited until the frigate was at close range before replying. "Orion" needed just one broadside to reduce the frigate to a wreck, and Martin's disabled ship drifted away over the shoal. During the delay this detour caused, two other British ships joined the battle: <a href="%20HMS%20Theseus%20%281786%29">Theseus</a>, which had been disguised as a <a href="first-rate">first-rate</a> ship, followed Foley's track across "Guerrier"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s bow. Miller steered his ship through the middle of the melee between the anchored British and French ships until he encountered the third French ship, "<a href="HMS%20Spartiate%20%281798%29">Spartiate</a>". Anchoring to port, Miller's ship opened fire at close range. <a href="HMS%20Audacious%20%281785%29">HMS "Audacious"</a> under Captain <a href="Davidge%20Gould">Davidge Gould</a> crossed the French line between "Guerrier" and "Conquérant", anchoring between the ships and raking them both. "Orion" then rejoined the action further south than intended, firing on the fifth French ship, "<a href="French%20ship%20Souverain%20%281792%29">Peuple Souverain</a>," and Admiral Blanquet's flagship, "<a href="French%20ship%20Franklin%20%281797%29">Franklin</a>".

The next three British ships, "Vanguard" in the lead followed by <a href="HMS%20Minotaur%20%281793%29">HMS "Minotaur"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Defence%20%281763%29">HMS "Defence"</a>, remained in line of battle formation and anchored on the starboard side of the French line at 18:40. Nelson focused his flagship's fire on "Spartiate", while Captain <a href="Thomas%20Louis">Thomas Louis</a> in "Minotaur" attacked the unengaged "<a href="French%20ship%20Aquilon%20%281789%29">Aquilon</a>" and Captain <a href="John%20Peyton%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Peyton</a> in "Defence" joined the attack on "Peuple Souverain". With the French vanguard now heavily outnumbered, the following British ships, <a href="HMS%20Bellerophon%20%281786%29">HMS "Bellerophon"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Majestic%20%281785%29">HMS "Majestic"</a>"," passed by the melee and advanced on the so far unengaged French centre. Both ships were soon fighting enemies much more powerful than they and began to take severe damage. Captain <a href="Henry%20D%27Esterre%20Darby">Henry Darby</a> on "Bellerophon" missed his intended anchor near "Franklin" and instead found his ship underneath the main battery of the French flagship. Captain <a href="George%20Blagdon%20Westcott">George Blagdon Westcott</a> on "Majestic" also missed his station and almost collided with "Heureux", coming under heavy fire from "<a href="HMS%20Tonnant%20%281792%29">Tonnant</a>". Unable to stop in time, Westcott's <a href="jib">jib boom</a> became entangled with "Tonnant"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s <a href="Shroud%20%28sailing%29">shroud</a>.

The French suffered too, Admiral Brueys on "Orient" was severely wounded in the face and hand by flying debris during the opening exchange of fire with "Bellerophon". The final ship of the British line, "Culloden" under Troubridge, sailed too close to Aboukir Island in the growing darkness and became stuck fast on the shoal. Despite strenuous efforts from the "Culloden"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s boats, the brig "Mutine" and the 50-gun <a href="HMS%20Leander%20%281780%29">HMS "Leander"</a> under Captain <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Thompson%2C%201st%20Baronet">Thomas Thompson</a>, the ship of the line could not be moved, and the waves drove "Culloden" further onto the shoal, inflicting severe damage to the ship's hull.

At 19:00 the identifying lights in the mizzenmasts of the British fleet were lit. By this time, "Guerrier" had been completely dismasted and heavily battered. "Zealous" by contrast was barely touched: Hood had situated "Zealous" outside the arc of most of the French ship's broadsides, and in any case "Guerrier" was not prepared for an engagement on both sides simultaneously, with its port guns blocked by stores. Although their ship was a wreck, the crew of "Guerrier" refused to surrender, continuing to fire the few functional guns whenever possible despite heavy answering fire from "Zealous". In addition to his cannon fire, Hood called up his marines and ordered them to fire volleys of musket shot at the deck of the French ship, driving the crew out of sight but still failing to secure the surrender from Captain Trullet. It was not until 21:00, when Hood sent a small boat to "Guerrier" with a boarding party, that the French ship finally surrendered. "Conquérant" was defeated more rapidly, after heavy broadsides from passing British ships and the close attentions of "Audacious" and "Goliath" brought down all three masts before 19:00. With his ship immobile and badly damaged, the mortally wounded Captain <a href="Etienne%20Dalbarade">Etienne Dalbarade</a> <a href="Striking%20the%20colours">struck his colours</a> and a boarding party seized control. Unlike "Zealous", these British ships suffered relatively severe damage in the engagement. "Goliath" lost most of its rigging, suffered damage to all three masts and suffered more than 60 casualties. With his opponents defeated, Captain Gould on "Audacious" used the spring on his cable to transfer fire to "Spartiate", the next French ship in line. To the west of the battle the battered "Sérieuse" sank over the shoal. Its masts protruded from the water as survivors scrambled into boats and rowed for the shore.

The transfer of "Audacious"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s broadside to "Spartiate" meant that Captain <a href="Maurice-Julien%20Emeriau">Maurice-Julien Emeriau</a> now faced three opponents. Within minutes all three of his ship's masts had fallen, but the battle around "Spartiate" continued until 21:00, when the badly wounded Emeriau ordered his colours struck. Although "Spartiate" was outnumbered, it had been supported by the next in line, "Aquilon", which was the only ship of the French van squadron fighting a single opponent, "Minotaur". Captain <a href="Antoine%20Ren%C3%A9%20Th%C3%A9venard">Antoine René Thévenard</a> used the spring on his anchor cable to angle his broadside into a raking position across the bow of Nelson's flagship, which consequently suffered more than 100 casualties, including the admiral. At approximately 20:30, an iron splinter fired in a <a href="Naval%20artillery%20in%20the%20Age%20of%20Sail%23Shot">langrage</a> shot from "Spartiate "struck Nelson over his blinded right eye. The wound caused a flap of skin to fall across his face, rendering him temporarily completely blind. Nelson collapsed into the arms of Captain <a href="Edward%20Berry">Edward Berry</a> and was carried below. Certain that his wound was fatal, he cried out "I am killed, remember me to my wife", and called for his chaplain, <a href="Stephen%20George%20Comyn">Stephen Comyn</a>. The wound was immediately inspected by "Vanguard"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s surgeon Michael Jefferson, who informed the admiral that it was a simple flesh wound and stitched the skin together. Nelson subsequently ignored Jefferson's instructions to remain inactive, returning to the quarterdeck shortly before the explosion on "Orient" to oversee the closing stages of the battle. Although Thévenard's manoeuvre was successful, it placed his own bow under "Minotaur"s guns and by 21:25 the French ship was dismasted and battered, Captain Thévenard killed and his junior officers forced to surrender. With his opponent defeated, Captain <a href="Thomas%20Louis">Thomas Louis</a> then took "Minotaur" south to join the attack on "Franklin".

"Defence" and "Orion "attacked the fifth French ship, "Peuple Souverain", from either side and the ship rapidly lost the fore and main masts. Aboard the "Orion", a wooden block was smashed off one of the ship's masts, killing two men before wounding Captain Saumarez in the thigh. On "Peuple Souverain", Captain <a href="Pierre-Paul%20Raccord">Pierre-Paul Raccord</a> was badly wounded and ordered his ship's anchor cable cut in an effort to escape the bombardment. "Peuple Souverain" drifted south towards the flagship "Orient", which mistakenly opened fire on the darkened vessel. "Orion" and "Defence" were unable to immediately pursue. "Defence" had lost its fore topmast and an improvised <a href="fireship">fireship</a> that drifted through the battle narrowly missed "Orion". The origin of this vessel, an abandoned and burning ship's boat laden with highly flammable material, is uncertain, but it may have been launched from "Guerrier" as the battle began. "Peuple Souverain" anchored not far from "Orient", but took no further part in the fighting. The wrecked ship surrendered during the night. "Franklin" remained in combat, but Blanquet had suffered a severe head wound and Captain Gillet had been carried below unconscious with severe wounds. Shortly afterwards, a fire broke out on the quarterdeck after an arms locker exploded, which was eventually extinguished with difficulty by the crew.

To the south, HMS "Bellerophon" was in serious trouble as the huge broadside of "Orient" pounded the ship. At 19:50 the mizzenmast and main mast both collapsed and fires broke out simultaneously at several points. Although the blazes were extinguished, the ship had suffered more than 200 casualties. Captain Darby recognised that his position was untenable and ordered the anchor cables cut at 20:20. The battered ship drifted away from the battle under continued fire from "Tonnant" as the foremast collapsed as well. "Orient" had also suffered significant damage and Admiral Brueys had been struck in the midriff by a cannonball that almost cut him in half. He died fifteen minutes later, remaining on deck and refusing to be carried below. "Orient"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s captain, <a href="Luc-Julien-Joseph%20Casabianca">Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca</a>, was also wounded, struck in the face by flying debris and knocked unconscious, while his twelve-year-old son had a leg torn off by a cannonball as he stood beside his father. The most southerly British ship, "Majestic", had become briefly entangled with the 80-gun "Tonnant", and in the resulting battle, suffered heavy casualties. Captain <a href="George%20Blagdon%20Westcott">George Blagdon Westcott</a> was among the dead, killed by French musket fire. Lieutenant Robert Cuthbert assumed command and successfully disentangled his ship, allowing the badly damaged "Majestic" to drift further southwards so that by 20:30 it was stationed between "Tonnant" and the next in line, "Heureux", engaging both. To support the centre, Captain Thompson of "Leander" abandoned the futile efforts to drag the stranded "Culloden" off the shoal and sailed down the embattled French line, entering the gap created by the drifting "Peuple Souverain" and opening a fierce raking fire on "Franklin" and "Orient".

While the battle raged in the bay, the two straggling British ships made strenuous efforts to join the engagement, focusing on the flashes of gunfire in the darkness. Warned away from the Aboukir shoals by the grounded "Culloden", Captain <a href="Benjamin%20Hallowell%20Carew">Benjamin Hallowell</a> in "Swiftsure" passed the melee at the head of the line and aimed his ship at the French centre. Shortly after 20:00, a dismasted hulk was spotted drifting in front of "Swiftsure" and Hallowell initially ordered his men to fire before rescinding the order, concerned for the identity of the strange vessel. Hailing the battered ship, Hallowell received the reply "Bellerophon, going out of action disabled." Relieved that he had not accidentally attacked one of his own ships in the darkness, Hallowell pulled up between "Orient" and "Franklin" and opened fire on them both. "Alexander", the final unengaged British ship, which had followed "Swiftsure", pulled up close to "Tonnant", which had begun to drift away from the embattled French flagship. Captain <a href="Alexander%20John%20Ball">Alexander Ball</a> then joined the attack on "Orient".

At 21:00, the British observed a fire on the lower decks of the "Orient", the French flagship. Identifying the danger this posed to the "Orient", Captain Hallowell directed his gun crews to fire their guns directly into the blaze. Sustained British gun fire spread the flames throughout the ship's stern and prevented all efforts to extinguish them. Within minutes the fire had ascended the rigging and set the vast sails alight. The nearest British ships, "Swiftsure", "Alexander", and "Orion", all stopped firing, closed their gunports, and began edging away from the burning ship in anticipation of the detonation of the enormous ammunition supplies stored on board. In addition, they took crews away from the guns to form fire parties and to soak the sails and decks in seawater to help contain any resulting fires. Likewise the French ships "Tonnant", "Heureux", and "<a href="French%20ship%20Mercure%20%281783%29">Mercure</a>" all cut their anchor cables and drifted southwards away from the burning ship. At 22:00 the fire reached the <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a>, and the "Orient" was destroyed by a massive explosion. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough to rip open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond. Falling wreckage started fires on "Swiftsure", "Alexander", and "Franklin", although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on "Franklin".

It has never been firmly established how the fire on "Orient" broke out, but one common account is that jars of oil and paint had been left on the <a href="poop%20deck">poop deck</a>, instead of being properly stowed after painting of the ship's hull had been completed shortly before the battle. Burning <a href="wadding">wadding</a> from one of the British ships is believed to have floated onto the poop deck and ignited the paint. The fire rapidly spread through the admiral's cabin and into a ready magazine that stored <a href="Carcass%20%28projectile%29">carcass</a> ammunition, which was designed to burn more fiercely in water than in air. Alternatively, Fleet Captain <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20Ganteaume">Honoré Ganteaume</a> later reported the cause as an explosion on the quarterdeck, preceded by a series of minor fires on the main deck among the ship's boats. Whatever its origin, the fire spread rapidly through the ship's rigging, unchecked by the fire pumps aboard, which had been smashed by British shot. A second blaze then began at the bow, trapping hundreds of sailors in the ship's waist. Subsequent archaeological investigation found debris scattered over of seabed and evidence that the ship was wracked by two huge explosions one after the other. Hundreds of men dove into the sea to escape the flames, but fewer than 100 survived the blast. British boats picked up approximately 70 survivors, including the wounded staff officer <a href="L%C3%A9onard-Bernard%20Motard">Léonard-Bernard Motard</a>. A few others, including Ganteaume, managed to reach the shore on rafts. The remainder of the crew, numbering more than 1,000 men, were killed, including Captain Casabianca and his son, Giocante.

For ten minutes after the explosion there was no firing; sailors from both sides were either too shocked by the blast or desperately extinguishing fires aboard their own ships to continue the fight. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of "Orient". At 22:10, "Franklin" restarted the engagement by firing on "Swiftsure". Isolated and battered, Blanquet's ship was soon dismasted and the admiral, suffering a severe head wound, was forced to surrender by the combined firepower of "Swiftsure" and "Defence". More than half of "Franklin"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s crew had been killed or wounded.

By midnight only "Tonnant" remained engaged, as Commodore <a href="Aristide%20Aubert%20Du%20Petit%20Thouars">Aristide Aubert Du Petit Thouars</a> continued his fight with "Majestic" and fired on "Swiftsure" when the British ship moved within range. By 03:00, after more than three hours of close quarter combat, "Majestic" had lost its main and mizzen masts while "Tonnant" was a dismasted hulk. Although Captain Du Petit Thouars had lost both legs and an arm he remained in command, insisting on having the tricolour nailed to the mast to prevent it from being struck and giving orders from his position propped up on deck in a bucket of wheat. Under his guidance, the battered "Tonnant" gradually drifted southwards away from the action to join the southern division under Villeneuve, who failed to bring these ships into effective action. Throughout the engagement the French rear had kept up an arbitrary fire on the battling ships ahead. The only noticeable effect was the smashing of "<a href="French%20ship%20Commerce%20de%20Bordeaux%20%281785%29">Timoléon</a>"s rudder by misdirected fire from the neighbouring "<a href="French%20ship%20G%C3%A9n%C3%A9reux%20%281785%29">Généreux</a>".

As the sun rose at 04:00 on 2 August, firing broke out once again between the French southern division of "Guillaume Tell", "Tonnant", "Généreux" and "Timoléon" and the battered "Alexander" and "Majestic". Although briefly outmatched, the British ships were soon joined by "Goliath" and "Theseus". As Captain Miller manoeuvred his ship into position, "Theseus" briefly came under fire from the frigate "<a href="French%20frigate%20Art%C3%A9mise%20%281794%29">Artémise</a>". Miller turned his ship towards "Artémise", but Captain <a href="Pierre-Jean%20Standelet">Pierre-Jean Standelet</a> struck his flag and ordered his men to abandon the frigate. Miller sent a boat under Lieutenant <a href="William%20Hoste">William Hoste</a> to take possession of the empty vessel, but Standelet had set fire to his ship as he left and "Artémise" blew up shortly afterwards. The surviving French ships of the line, covering their retreat with gunfire, gradually pulled to the east away from the shore at 06:00. "Zealous" pursued, and was able to prevent the frigate "<a href="French%20frigate%20Justice%20%281794%29">Justice</a>" from boarding "Bellerophon", which was anchored at the southern point of the bay undergoing hasty repairs.

Two other French ships still flew the tricolour, but neither was in a position to either retreat or fight. When "Heureux" and "Mercure" had cut their anchor cables to escape the exploding "Orient", their crews had panicked and neither captain (both of whom were wounded) had managed to regain control of his ship. As a result, both vessels had drifted onto the shoal. "Alexander", "Goliath", "Theseus" and "Leander" attacked the stranded and defenceless ships, and both surrendered within minutes. The distractions provided by "Heureux", "Mercure" and "Justice" allowed Villeneuve to bring most of the surviving French ships to the mouth of the bay at 11:00. On the dismasted "Tonnant", Commodore Du Petit Thouars was now dead from his wounds and thrown overboard at his own request. As the ship was unable to make the required speed it was driven ashore by its crew. "Timoléon" was too far south to escape with Villeneuve and, in attempting to join the survivors, had also grounded on the shoal. The force of the impact dislodged the ship's foremast. The remaining French vessels: the ships of the line "Guillaume Tell" and "Généreux" and the frigates "Justice" and "<a href="French%20frigate%20Diane%20%281796%29">Diane</a>", formed up and stood out to sea, pursued by "Zealous". Despite strenuous efforts, Captain Hood's isolated ship came under heavy fire and was unable to cut off the trailing "Justice" as the French survivors escaped seawards. "Zealous" was struck by a number of French shot and lost one man killed.

For the remainder of 2 August Nelson's ships made improvised repairs and boarded and consolidated their prizes. "Culloden" especially required assistance. Troubridge, having finally dragged his ship off the shoal at 02:00, found that he had lost his rudder and was taking on more than of water an hour. Emergency repairs to the hull and fashioning a replacement rudder from a spare topmast took most of the next two days. On the morning of 3 August, Nelson sent "Theseus" and "Leander" to force the surrender of the grounded "Tonnant" and "Timoléon". The "Tonnant", its decks crowded with 1,600 survivors from other French vessels, surrendered as the British ships approached while "Timoléon" was set on fire by its remaining crew who then escaped to the shore in small boats. "Timoléon" exploded shortly after midday, the eleventh and final French ship of the line destroyed or captured during the battle.

British casualties in the battle were recorded with some accuracy in the immediate aftermath as 218 killed and approximately 677 wounded, although the number of wounded who subsequently died is not known. The ships that suffered most were "Bellerophon" with 201 casualties and "Majestic" with 193. Other than "Culloden" the lightest loss was on "Zealous", which had one man killed and seven wounded.

The casualty list included Captain Westcott, five lieutenants and ten junior officers among the dead, and Admiral Nelson, Captains Saumarez, Ball and Darby, and six lieutenants wounded. Other than "Culloden", the only British ships seriously damaged in their hulls were "Bellerophon", "Majestic," and "Vanguard". "Bellerophon" and "Majestic" were the only ships to lose masts: "Majestic" the main and mizzen and "Bellerophon" all three.

French casualties are harder to calculate but were significantly higher. Estimates of French losses range from 2,000 to 5,000, with a suggested median point of 3,500, which includes more than 1,000 captured wounded and nearly 2,000 killed, half of whom died on "Orient". In addition to Admiral Brueys killed and Admiral Blanquet wounded, four captains died and seven others were seriously wounded. The French ships suffered severe damage: Two ships of the line and two frigates were destroyed (as well as a bomb vessel scuttled by its crew), and three other captured ships were too battered ever to sail again. Of the remaining prizes, only three were ever sufficiently repaired for frontline service. For weeks after the battle, bodies washed up along the Egyptian coast, decaying slowly in the intense, dry heat.

Nelson, who on surveying the bay on the morning of 2 August said, "Victory is not a name strong enough for such a scene", remained at anchor in Aboukir Bay for the next two weeks, preoccupied with recovering from his wound, writing dispatches, and assessing the military situation in Egypt using documents captured on board one of the prizes. Nelson's head wound was recorded as being "three inches long" with "the cranium exposed for one inch". He suffered pain from the injury for the rest of his life and was badly scarred, styling his hair to disguise it as much as possible. As their commander recovered, his men stripped the wrecks of useful supplies and made repairs to their ships and prizes.

Throughout the week, Aboukir Bay was surrounded by bonfires lit by Bedouin tribesmen in celebration of the British victory. On 5 August, "Leander" was despatched to <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a> with messages for Earl St. Vincent carried by Captain Edward Berry. Over the next few days the British landed all but 200 of the captured prisoners on shore under strict terms of <a href="Parole%23Prisoners%20of%20war">parole</a>, although Bonaparte later ordered them to be formed into an infantry unit and added to his army. The wounded officers taken prisoner were held on board "Vanguard", where Nelson regularly entertained them at dinner. Historian Joseph Allen recounts that on one occasion Nelson, whose eyesight was still suffering following his wound, offered toothpicks to an officer who had lost his teeth and then passed a <a href="snuff%20%28tobacco%29">snuff-box</a> to an officer whose nose had been torn off, causing much embarrassment. On 8 August the fleet's boats stormed Aboukir Island, which surrendered without a fight. The landing party removed four of the guns and destroyed the rest along with the fort they were mounted in, renaming the island "Nelson's Island".

On 10 August, Nelson sent Lieutenant Thomas Duval from "Zealous" with messages to the government in India. Duval travelled across the Middle East overland via camel train to <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a> and took the <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a> ship "Fly" from <a href="Basra">Basra</a> to <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a>, acquainting <a href="Governor-General%20of%20India">Governor-General of India</a> <a href="Richard%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Wellesley">Viscount Wellesley</a> with the situation in Egypt. On 12 August the frigates <a href="HMS%20Emerald%20%281796%29">HMS "Emerald"</a> under Captain Thomas Moutray Waller and <a href="HMS%20Alcmene%20%281794%29">HMS "Alcmene"</a> under Captain <a href="George%20Johnstone%20Hope">George Johnstone Hope</a>, and the sloop <a href="HMS%20Bonne%20Citoyenne%20%281796%29">HMS "Bonne Citoyenne"</a> under Captain Robert Retalick, arrived off Alexandria. Initially the British mistook the frigate squadron for French warships and "Swiftsure "chased them away. They returned the following day once the error had been realised. The same day as the frigates arrived, Nelson sent "Mutine" to Britain with dispatches, under the command of Lieutenant <a href="Thomas%20Bladen%20Capel">Thomas Bladen Capel</a>, who had replaced Hardy after the latter's promotion to captain of "Vanguard". On 14 August, Nelson sent "Orion", "Majestic", "Bellerophon", "Minotaur", "Defence", "Audacious", "Theseus", "Franklin", "Tonnant", "Aquilon", "Conquérant", "Peuple Souverain," and "Spartiate" to sea under the command of Saumarez. Many ships had only <a href="jury%20masts">jury masts</a> and it took a full day for the convoy to reach the mouth of the bay, finally sailing into open water on 15 August. On 16 August the British burned and destroyed the grounded prize "Heureux" as no longer fit for service and on 18 August also burned "Guerrier" and "Mercure". On 19 August, Nelson sailed for Naples with "Vanguard", "Culloden," and "Alexander", leaving Hood in command of "Zealous", "Goliath", "Swiftsure," and the recently joined frigates to watch over French activities at Alexandria.

The first message to reach Bonaparte regarding the disaster that had overtaken his fleet arrived on 14 August at his camp on the road between <a href="Salahieh">Salahieh</a> and <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>. The messenger was a staff officer sent by the Governor of Alexandria General <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Kl%C3%A9ber">Jean Baptiste Kléber</a>, and the report had been hastily written by Admiral Ganteaume, who had subsequently rejoined Villeneuve's ships at sea. One account reports that when he was handed the message, Bonaparte read it without emotion before calling the messenger to him and demanding further details. When the messenger had finished, the French general reportedly announced ""Nous n'avons plus de flotte: eh bien. Il faut rester en ces contrées, ou en sortir grands comme les anciens"" ("We no longer have a fleet: well, we must either remain in this country or quit it as great as the ancients"). Another story, as told by the general's secretary, <a href="Louis%20Antoine%20Fauvelet%20de%20Bourrienne">Bourienne</a>, claims that Bonaparte was almost overcome by the news and exclaimed "Unfortunate Brueys, what have you done!" Bonaparte later placed much of the blame for the defeat on the wounded Admiral Blanquet, falsely accusing him of surrendering "Franklin" while his ship was undamaged. Protestations from Ganteaume and Minister Étienne Eustache Bruix later reduced the degree of criticism Blanquet faced, but he never again served in a command capacity. Bonaparte's most immediate concern however was with his own officers, who began to question the wisdom of the entire expedition. Inviting his most senior officers to dinner, Bonaparte asked them how they were. When they replied that they were "marvellous," Bonaparte responded that it was just as well, since he would have them shot if they continued "fostering mutinies and preaching revolt." To quell any uprising among the native inhabitants, Egyptians overheard discussing the battle were threatened with having their tongues cut out.

Nelson's first set of dispatches were captured when "Leander" was intercepted and defeated by "Généreux" in a fierce engagement off the western shore of Crete <a href="Action%20of%2018%20August%201798">on 18 August 1798</a>. As a result, reports of the battle did not reach Britain until Capel arrived in "Mutine" on 2 October, entering the Admiralty at 11:15 and personally delivering the news to Lord Spencer, who collapsed unconscious when he heard the report. Although Nelson had previously been castigated in the press for failing to intercept the French fleet, rumours of the battle had begun to arrive in Britain from the continent in late September and the news Capel brought was greeted with celebrations right across the country. Within four days Nelson had been elevated to Baron Nelson of the Nile and Burnham Thorpe, a title with which he was privately dissatisfied, believing his actions deserved better reward. <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a> addressed the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Great%20Britain">Houses of Parliament</a> on 20 November with the words:

Saumarez's convoy of prizes stopped first at Malta, where Saumarez provided assistance to a rebellion on the island among the <a href="Maltese%20people">Maltese population</a>. It then sailed to Gibraltar, arriving on 18 October to the cheers of the garrison. Saumarez wrote that, "We can never do justice to the warmth of their applause, and the praises they all bestowed on our squadron." On 23 October, following the transfer of the wounded to the military hospital and provision of basic supplies, the convoy sailed on towards <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, leaving "Bellerophon" and "Majestic" behind for more extensive repairs. "Peuple Souverain" also remained at Gibraltar: The ship was deemed too badly damaged for the Atlantic voyage to Britain and so was converted to a guardship under the name of HMS "Guerrier". The remaining prizes underwent basic repairs and then sailed for Britain, spending some months at the <a href="Tagus">Tagus</a> and joining with the annual merchant convoy from Portugal in June 1799 under the escort of a squadron commanded by Admiral <a href="Alan%20Gardner%2C%201st%20Baron%20Gardner">Sir Alan Gardner</a>, before eventually arriving at <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>. Their age and battered state meant that neither "Conquérant" nor "Aquilon" were considered fit for active service in the Royal Navy and both were subsequently hulked, although they had been bought into the service for £20,000 (the equivalent of £ as of 2018) each as HMS "Conquerant" and HMS "Aboukir" to provide a financial reward to the crews that had captured them. Similar sums were also paid out for "Guerrier", "Mercure", "Heureux" and "Peuple Souverain", while the other captured ships were worth considerably more. Constructed of Adriatic <a href="oak">oak</a>, "Tonnant" had been built in 1792 and "Franklin" and "Spartiate" were less than a year old. "Tonnant" and "Spartiate", both of which later fought at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a>, joined the Royal Navy under their old names while "Franklin", considered to be "the finest two-decked ship in the world", was renamed HMS "Canopus". The total value of the prizes captured at the Nile and subsequently bought into the Royal Navy was estimated at just over £130,000 (the equivalent of £ as of 2018).
Additional awards were presented to the British fleet: Nelson was awarded £2,000 (£ as of 2018) a year for life by the Parliament of Great Britain and £1,000 per annum by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Ireland">Parliament of Ireland</a>, although the latter was inadvertently discontinued after the <a href="Act%20of%20Union%201800">Act of Union</a> dissolved the Irish Parliament. Both parliaments gave unanimous votes of thanks, each captain who served in the battle was presented with a specially minted gold medal and the first lieutenant of every ship engaged in the battle was promoted to commander. Troubridge and his men, initially excluded, received equal shares in the awards after Nelson personally interceded for the crew of the stranded "Culloden, "even though they did not directly participate in the engagement. The <a href="Honourable%20East%20India%20Company">Honourable East India Company</a> presented Nelson with £10,000 (£ as of 2018) in recognition of the benefit his action had on their holdings and the cities of <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> and other municipal and corporate bodies made similar awards. Nelson's own captains presented him with a sword and a portrait as "proof of their esteem." Nelson publicly encouraged this close bond with his officers and on 29 September 1798 described them as "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers", echoing <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s play "<a href="Henry%20V%20%28play%29">Henry V</a>". From this grew the notion of the <a href="Nelsonic%20Band%20of%20Brothers">Nelsonic Band of Brothers</a>, a cadre of high-quality naval officers that served with Nelson for the remainder of his life. Nearly five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the <a href="Naval%20General%20Service%20Medal%20%281847%29">Naval General Service Medal</a>, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.

Other rewards were bestowed by foreign states, particularly the <a href="Ottoman%20Emperor">Ottoman Emperor</a> <a href="Selim%20III">Selim III</a>, who made Nelson the first Knight Commander of the newly created <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Crescent">Order of the Crescent</a>, and presented him with a <a href="chelengk">chelengk</a>, a diamond studded rose, a sable fur and numerous other valuable presents. Tsar <a href="Paul%20I%20of%20Russia">Paul I of Russia</a> sent, among other rewards, a gold box studded with diamonds, and similar gifts in silver arrived from other European rulers. On his return to Naples, Nelson was greeted with a triumphal procession led by <a href="Ferdinand%20IV%20of%20Naples">King Ferdinand IV</a> and Sir William Hamilton and was introduced for only the third time to Sir William's wife <a href="Emma%2C%20Lady%20Hamilton">Emma, Lady Hamilton</a>, who fainted violently at the meeting, and apparently took several weeks to recover from her injuries. Lauded as a hero by the Neapolitan court, Nelson was later to dabble in Neapolitan politics and become the Duke of Bronté, actions for which he was criticised by his superiors and his reputation suffered. British general <a href="John%20Moore%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">John Moore</a>, who met Nelson in Naples at this time, described him as "covered with stars, medals and ribbons, more like a Prince of Opera than the Conqueror of the Nile."

Rumours of a battle first appeared in the French press as early as 7 August, although credible reports did not arrive until 26 August, and even these claimed that Nelson was dead and Bonaparte a British prisoner. When the news became certain, the French press insisted that the defeat was the result both of an overwhelmingly large British force and unspecified "traitors." Among the anti-government journals in France, the defeat was blamed on the incompetence of the French Directory and on supposed lingering Royalist sentiments in the Navy. Villeneuve came under scathing attack on his return to France for his failure to support Brueys during the battle. In his defence, he pleaded that the wind had been against him and that Brueys had not issued orders for him to counterattack the British fleet. Writing many years later, Bonaparte commented that if the French Navy had adopted the same tactical principles as the British:
By contrast, the British press were jubilant; many newspapers sought to portray the battle as a victory for Britain over anarchy, and the success was used to attack the supposedly pro-republican <a href="Whig%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whig</a> politicians <a href="Charles%20James%20Fox">Charles James Fox</a> and <a href="Richard%20Brinsley%20Sheridan">Richard Brinsley Sheridan</a>.

There has been extensive historiographical debate over the comparative strengths of the fleets, although they were ostensibly evenly matched in size, each containing 13 ships of the line. However, the loss of "Culloden", the relative sizes of "Orient" and "Leander" and the participation in the action by two of the French frigates and several smaller vessels, as well as the theoretical strength of the French position, leads most historians to the conclusion that the French were marginally more powerful. This is accentuated by the weight of broadside of several of the French ships: "Spartiate", "Franklin", "Orient", "Tonnant" and "Guillaume Tell" were each significantly larger than any individual British ship in the battle. However inadequate deployment, reduced crews, and the failure of the rear division under Villeneuve to meaningfully participate, all contributed to the French defeat.

The Battle of the Nile has been called "arguably, the most decisive naval engagement of the great age of sail", and "the most splendid and glorious success which the British Navy gained." Historian and novelist <a href="C.%20S.%20Forester">C. S. Forester</a>, writing in 1929, compared the Nile to the great naval actions in history and concluded that "it still only stands rivalled by <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Tsu-Shima</a> as an example of the annihilation of one fleet by another of approximately equal material force". The effect on the strategic situation in the Mediterranean was immediate, reversing the balance of the conflict and giving the British control at sea that they maintained for the remainder of the war. The destruction of the French Mediterranean fleet allowed the Royal Navy to return to the sea in force, as British squadrons set up <a href="blockade">blockade</a>s off French and allied ports. In particular, British ships cut Malta off from France, aided by the rebellion among the native Maltese population that forced the French garrison to retreat to Valletta and shut the gates. The ensuing <a href="Siege%20of%20Malta%20%281798%E2%80%931800%29">Siege of Malta</a> lasted for two years before the defenders were finally starved into surrender. In 1799, British ships harassed Bonaparte's army as it marched east and north through <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>, and played a crucial part in Bonaparte's defeat at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Acre%20%281799%29">Siege of Acre</a>, when the barges carrying the siege train were captured and the French storming parties were bombarded by British ships anchored offshore. It was during one of these latter engagements that Captain Miller of "Theseus" was killed in an ammunition explosion. The defeat at Acre forced Bonaparte to retreat to Egypt and effectively ended his efforts to carve an empire in the Middle East. The French general returned to France without his army late in the year, leaving Kléber in command of Egypt.

The Ottomans, with whom Bonaparte had hoped to conduct an alliance once his control of Egypt was complete, were encouraged by the Battle of the Nile to go to war against France. This led to a series of campaigns that slowly sapped the strength from the French army trapped in Egypt. The British victory also encouraged the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a> and the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, both of whom were mustering armies as part of a <a href="Second%20Coalition">Second Coalition</a>, which declared war on France in 1799. With the Mediterranean undefended, a Russian fleet entered the <a href="Ionian%20Sea">Ionian Sea</a>, while Austrian armies recaptured much of the Italian territory lost to Bonaparte in the previous war. Without their best general and his veterans, the French suffered a series of defeats and it was not until Bonaparte returned to become <a href="First%20Consul">First Consul</a> that France once again held a position of strength on mainland Europe. In 1801 a British Expeditionary Force defeated the demoralised remains of the French army in Egypt. The Royal Navy used its dominance in the Mediterranean to invade Egypt without the fear of ambush while anchored off the Egyptian coast.

In spite of the overwhelming British victory in the climactic battle, the campaign has sometimes been considered a strategic success for France. Historian <a href="Edward%20Ingram%20%28historian%29">Edward Ingram</a> noted that if Nelson had successfully intercepted Bonaparte at sea as ordered, the ensuing battle could have annihilated both the French fleet and the transports. As it was, Bonaparte was free to continue the war in the Middle East and later to return to Europe personally unscathed. The potential of a successful engagement at sea to change the course of history is underscored by the list of French army officers carried aboard the convoy who later formed the core of the generals and marshals under Emperor Napoleon. In addition to Bonaparte himself, <a href="Louis-Alexandre%20Berthier">Louis-Alexandre Berthier</a>, <a href="Auguste%20de%20Marmont">Auguste de Marmont</a>, <a href="Jean%20Lannes">Jean Lannes</a>, <a href="Joachim%20Murat">Joachim Murat</a>, <a href="Louis%20Desaix">Louis Desaix</a>, <a href="Jean%20Reynier">Jean Reynier</a>, <a href="Antoine-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Andr%C3%A9ossy">Antoine-François Andréossy</a>, <a href="Jean-Andoche%20Junot">Jean-Andoche Junot</a>, <a href="Louis-Nicolas%20Davout">Louis-Nicolas Davout</a> and <a href="Guillaume-Mathieu%20Dumas">Dumas</a> were all passengers on the <a href="Mediterranean%20campaign%20of%201798">cramped Mediterranean crossing</a>.

The Battle of the Nile remains one of the Royal Navy's most famous victories, and has remained prominent in the British popular imagination, sustained by its depiction in a large number of cartoons, paintings, poems, and plays. One of the best known poems about the battle is "<a href="Casabianca%20%28poem%29">Casabianca</a>", which was written by <a href="Felicia%20Dorothea%20Hemans">Felicia Dorothea Hemans</a> in 1826 and describes a fictional account of the death of Captain Casabianca's son on "Orient". Monuments were raised, including <a href="Cleopatra%27s%20Needle%20%28London%29">Cleopatra's Needle</a> in London. <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20of%20Egypt">Muhammad Ali of Egypt</a> gave the monument in 1819 in recognition of the battle of 1798 and the campaign of 1801 but Great Britain did not erect it on the <a href="Victoria%20Embankment">Victoria Embankment</a> until 1878. Another memorial, the <a href="Nile%20Clumps">Nile Clumps</a> near <a href="Amesbury">Amesbury</a>, consists of stands of <a href="beech">beech</a> trees purportedly planted by <a href="Charles%20Douglas%2C%206th%20Marquess%20of%20Queensberry">Lord Queensbury</a> at the bequest of Lady Hamilton and <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Hardy%2C%201st%20Baronet">Thomas Hardy</a> after Nelson's death. The trees form a plan of the battle; each clump represents the position of a British or French ship. A similar arboreal memorial is thought to have been planted near <a href="Alnwick">Alnwick</a> by Nelson's agent <a href="Alexander%20Davison">Alexander Davison</a>. The Royal Navy commemorated the battle with the ship names <a href="HMS%20Aboukir">HMS "Aboukir"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Nile">HMS "Nile"</a>"," and in 1998 commemorated the 200th anniversary of the battle with a visit to Aboukir Bay by the modern frigate <a href="HMS%20Somerset%20%28F82%29">HMS "Somerset"</a>, whose crew laid wreaths in memory of those who lost their lives in the battle.

Although Nelson biographer <a href="Ernle%20Bradford">Ernle Bradford</a> assumed in 1977 that the remains of "Orient" "are almost certainly unrecoverable," the first archaeological investigation into the battle began in 1983, when a French survey team under Jacques Dumas discovered the wreck of the French flagship. <a href="Franck%20Goddio">Franck Goddio</a> later took over the work, leading a major project to explore the bay in 1998. He found that material was scattered over an area in diameter. In addition to military and nautical equipment, Goddio recovered a large number of gold and silver coins from countries across the Mediterranean, some from the 17th century. It is likely that these were part of the treasure taken from Malta that was lost in the explosion aboard "Orient". In 2000, Italian archaeologist Paolo Gallo led an excavation focusing on ancient ruins on Nelson's Island. It uncovered a number of graves that date from the battle, as well as others buried there during the 1801 invasion. These graves, which included a woman and three children, were relocated in 2005 to a cemetery at <a href="Shatby">Shatby</a> in Alexandria. The reburial was attended by sailors from the modern frigate <a href="HMS%20Chatham%20%28F87%29">HMS "Chatham"</a> and a band from the <a href="Egyptian%20Navy">Egyptian Navy</a>, as well as a descendant of the only identified burial, Commander James Russell.

Barnabas

Barnabas (), born Joseph, was an <a href="early%20Christian">early Christian</a>, one of the prominent <a href="Disciple%20%28Christianity%29">Christian disciples</a> in Jerusalem. According to Barnabas was a <a href="Cyprus">Cypriot</a> <a href="Jew">Jew</a>. Named an <a href="Apostle%20%28Christian%29">apostle</a> in , he and <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul the Apostle</a> undertook missionary journeys together and defended <a href="Gentile">Gentile</a> converts against the <a href="Judaizers">Judaizers</a>. They traveled together making more converts ("c" 45–47), and participated in the <a href="Council%20of%20Jerusalem">Council of Jerusalem</a> ("c" 50). Barnabas and Paul successfully evangelized among the <a href="Godfearers">"God-fearing"</a> Gentiles who attended <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>s in various <a href="Hellenization">Hellenized</a> cities of <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>.

Barnabas' story appears in the <a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>, and Paul mentions him in some of his <a href="epistle">epistle</a>s. <a href="Tertullian">Tertullian</a> named him as the author of the <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Hebrews">Epistle to the Hebrews</a>, but this and other attributions are conjecture. <a href="Clement%20of%20Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</a> and some scholars have ascribed the <a href="Epistle%20of%20Barnabas">Epistle of Barnabas</a> to him, but his authorship is disputed.

Although the date, place, and circumstances of his death are historically unverifiable, Christian tradition holds that Barnabas was <a href="martyr">martyr</a>ed at <a href="Salamis%2C%20Cyprus">Salamis, Cyprus</a>, in AD 61. He is traditionally identified as the founder of the <a href="Cypriot%20Orthodox%20Church">Cypriot Orthodox Church</a>. The <a href="feast%20day">feast day</a> of Barnabas is celebrated on June 11.

Barnabas is usually identified as the cousin of <a href="Mark%20the%20Evangelist">Mark the Evangelist</a> on the basis of Colossians 4. Some traditions hold that <a href="Aristobulus%20of%20Britannia">Aristobulus of Britannia</a>, one of the <a href="Seventy%20Disciples">Seventy Disciples</a>, was the brother of Barnabas.

His <a href="Greeks">Hellenic</a> <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> parents called him Joseph (although the <a href="Byzantine%20text-type">Byzantine text-type</a> calls him , "Iōsēs", 'Joses', a <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> variant of 'Joseph'), but when he sold all his goods and gave the money to the apostles in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, they gave him a new name: Barnabas. This name appears to be from the <a href="Aramaic%20language">Aramaic</a> , "", meaning 'the son (of the) prophet'. However, the Greek text of the explains the name as , "hyios paraklēseōs", meaning ""son of consolation" or "son of encouragement"." A similar link between ”prophecy” and ”encouragement” is found in Paul’s letter to the Corinthians ().

Barnabas appears mainly in "Acts", a Christian history of the early Christian church. He also appears in several of Paul's epistles.

Barnabas, a native of Cyprus and a Levite, is first mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles as a member of the early Christian community in Jerusalem, who sold some land that he owned and gave the proceeds to the community (Acts 4:36-37). When the future <a href="Paul%20of%20Tarsus">Apostle Paul</a> returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas introduced him to the apostles (9:27). Easton, in his Bible Dictionary, supposes that they had been fellow students in the school of Rabbi <a href="Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a>.

The successful preaching of Christianity at Antioch to non-Jews led the church at Jerusalem to send Barnabas there to oversee the movement (Acts 11:20–22). He found the work so extensive and weighty that he went to <a href="Tarsus%20%28city%29">Tarsus</a> in search of Paul (still referred to as Saul), "an admirable colleague", to assist him. Paul returned with him to Antioch and labored with him for a whole year (Acts 11:25–26). At the end of this period, the two were sent up to Jerusalem ( 44) with contributions from the church at Antioch for the relief of the poorer Christians in Judea.

They returned to Antioch taking John Mark with them, the cousin or nephew of Barnabas. Later, they went to Cyprus and some of the principal cities of <a href="Pamphylia">Pamphylia</a>, <a href="Pisidia">Pisidia</a>, and <a href="Lycaonia">Lycaonia</a> (Acts 13:14). After recounting that the governor of Cyprus <a href="Sergius%20Paulus">Sergius Paulus</a> believed, the Acts of the Apostles 13:9 speaks of Barnabas's companion no longer as Saul, but as Paul, his Roman name, and generally refers to the two no longer as "Barnabas and Saul" as heretofore (11:30; 12:25; 13:2, 7), but as "Paul and Barnabas" (13:43, 46, 50; 14:20; 15:2, 22, 35). Only in 14:14 and 15:12, 25 does Barnabas again occupy the first place, in the first passage with recollection of 14:12, in the last two, because Barnabas stood in closer relation to the Jerusalem church than Paul. Paul appears as the more eloquent missionary (13:16; 14:8-9, 19-20), whence the <a href="Lystra">Lystra</a>ns regarded him as <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>, Barnabas as <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> (14:12).

Returning from this first missionary journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to consult with the church there regarding the relation of Gentiles to the church (Acts 15:2; ). According to Gal. 2:9-10, Barnabas was included with Paul in the agreement made between them, on the one hand, and <a href="James%2C%20brother%20of%20Jesus">James</a>, <a href="Saint%20Peter">Peter</a>, and <a href="John%20the%20Apostle">John</a>, on the other, that the two former should in the future preach to the pagans, not forgetting the poor at Jerusalem. This matter having been settled, they returned again to Antioch, bringing the agreement of the <a href="Council%20of%20Jerusalem">council</a> that <a href="Gentiles">Gentiles</a> were to be admitted into the church without having to adopt Jewish practices.

After they had returned to Antioch from the Jerusalem council, they spent some time there (15:35). Peter came and associated freely there with the Gentiles, eating with them, until criticized for this by some disciples of James, as against Mosaic law. Upon their remonstrances, Peter yielded apparently through fear of displeasing them, and refused to eat any longer with the Gentiles. Barnabas followed his example. Paul considered that they "walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel" and upbraided them before the whole church (Galatians 2:11-15).

Paul then asked Barnabas to accompany him on another journey (15:36). Barnabas wished to take John Mark along, but Paul did not, as he had left them on the earlier journey (15:37-38). The dispute ended by Paul and Barnabas taking separate routes. Paul took <a href="Silas">Silas</a> as his companion, and journeyed through Syria and <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>; while Barnabas took John Mark to visit Cyprus (15:36-41). John Francis Fenlon suggests that Paul may have been somewhat influenced by the attitude recently taken by Barnabas, which might have proven prejudicial to their work.

Barnabas is not mentioned again in the <a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>. However, Galatians 2:11-13 says, "And when Kephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he clearly was wrong. For, until some people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to draw back and separated himself, because he was afraid of the circumcised. And the rest of the Jews (also) acted hypocritically along with him, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy." Barnabas is also mentioned in the <a href="First%20Epistle%20to%20the%20Corinthians">First Epistle to the Corinthians</a>, in which it is mentioned that he and Paul funded their missions by working side jobs and (it is implied) went without wives and other benefits other apostles received (1 Cor. 9:6); Paul states that he and Barnabas forsook those benefits "that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ" (1 Cor. 9:12).

<a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>, the third-most important city of the Roman Empire, then the capital city of <a href="Syria%20%28Roman%20province%29">Syria province</a>, today <a href="Antakya">Antakya</a>, Turkey, was where Christians were first called thus.
Some of those who had been scattered by the persecution that arose because of Stephen went to Antioch, which became the site of an early Christian community. A considerable minority of the Antioch church of Barnabas's time belonged to the merchant class, and they provided support to the poorer Jerusalem church.

Barnabas participated in the Council of Jerusalem, which dealt with the admission of Gentiles into the Christian community, a crucial problem in early Christianity. Paul and Barnabas proposed that Gentiles be allowed into the community without being <a href="Circumcision%20controversy%20in%20early%20Christianity">circumcised</a>.

Church tradition developed outside of the canon of the New Testament describes the martyrdom of many saints, including the legend of the martyrdom of Barnabas. It relates that certain Jews coming to Syria and Salamis, where Barnabas was then preaching the gospel, being highly exasperated at his extraordinary success, fell upon him as he was disputing in the synagogue, dragged him out, and, after the most inhumane <a href="torture">torture</a>s, stoned him to death. His kinsman, John Mark, who was a spectator of this barbarous action, privately interred his body.

Although it is believed he was martyred of faith by being stoned, the Catholic-Apocryphal <a href="Acts%20of%20Barnabas">Acts of Barnabas</a> states that he was bound with a rope by the neck, and then being dragged only to the site where he would be burned to death. This is highly unlikely since the apocryphal Acts states that his bones were burnt to dust and that relics of some of his bones are stored in a church today; on the other hand, the fire in the apocryphal Acts could have cremated only some of his bones.

According to the History of the Cyprus Church, in 478 Barnabas appeared in a dream to the Archbishop of Constantia (<a href="Salamis%2C%20Cyprus">Salamis, Cyprus</a>) Anthemios and revealed to him the place of his sepulchre beneath a <a href="carob">carob</a>-tree. The following day Anthemios found the tomb and inside it the remains of Barnabas with a manuscript of Matthew's Gospel on his breast. Anthemios presented the Gospel to Emperor <a href="Zeno%20%28emperor%29">Zeno</a> at <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and received from him the privileges of the <a href="Cypriot%20Orthodox%20Church">Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus</a>, that is, the purple cloak which the <a href="List%20of%20archbishops%20of%20Cyprus">Greek Archbishop of Cyprus</a> wears at festivals of the church, the imperial sceptre and the red ink with which he affixes his signature.

Anthemios then placed the venerable remains of Barnabas in a church which he founded near the tomb. Excavations near the site of a present-day church and monastery, have revealed an early church with two empty tombs, believed to be that of St. Barnabas and Anthemios.

St. Barnabas is venerated as the <a href="Patron%20Saint">Patron Saint</a> of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>.

Although many assume that the biblical <a href="Mark%20the%20Cousin%20of%20Barnabas">Mark the Cousin of Barnabas</a> (<a href="Colossians">Colossians</a> 4:10) is the same as John Mark (Acts 12:12, 25; 13:5, 13; 15: 37) and <a href="Mark%20the%20Evangelist">Mark the Evangelist</a>, the traditionally believed author of the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Mark">Gospel of Mark</a>, according to <a href="Hippolytus%20of%20Rome">Hippolytus of Rome</a>, the three "Mark"s are distinct persons. They were all members of the <a href="Seventy%20Disciples">Seventy Apostles of Christ</a>, including Barnabas himself. There are two people named Barnabas among Hippolytus' list of Seventy Disciples, one (#13) became the bishop of Milan, the other (#25) the bishop of Heraclea. Most likely one of these two is the biblical Barnabas; the first one is more likely, because the numbering by Hippolytus seems to indicate a level of significance. <a href="Clement%20of%20Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</a> ("Stromata", ii, 20) also makes Barnabas one of the <a href="Seventy%20Disciples">Seventy Disciples</a> that are mentioned in the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a> 10:1ff.

Other sources bring Barnabas to <a href="Rome">Rome</a> and <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Egypt">Alexandria</a>. In the <a href="Clementine%20literature">"Clementine Recognitions"</a> (i, 7) he is depicted as preaching in Rome even during Christ's lifetime.

Not older than the 3rd century is the tradition of the later activity and martyrdom of Barnabas in <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, where his remains are said to have been discovered under the Emperor <a href="Zeno%20%28emperor%29">Zeno</a>. The <a href="Cypriot%20Orthodox%20Church">Cypriot Church</a> claimed Barnabas as its founder in order to rid itself of the supremacy of the <a href="Patriarch%20of%20Antioch">Patriarch of Antioch</a>, as did the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Milan">Archbishop of Milan</a> afterwards, to become more independent of Rome. In this connection, the question whether Barnabas was an apostle became important, and was often discussed during the Middle Ages.

<a href="Tertullian">Tertullian</a> and other Western writers regard Barnabas as the author of the <a href="Letter%20to%20the%20Hebrews">Letter to the Hebrews</a>. This may have been the Roman tradition—which Tertullian usually follows—and in Rome the epistle may have had its first readers. But the tradition has weighty considerations against it.

“<a href="Photios%20I%20of%20Constantinople">Photius</a> of the ninth century, refers to some in his day who were uncertain whether the Acts was written by Clement of Rome, Barnabas, or Luke. Yet Photius is certain that the work must be ascribed to Luke.” 

He is also traditionally associated with the <a href="Epistle%20of%20Barnabas">Epistle of Barnabas</a>, although some modern scholars think it more likely that that epistle was written in Alexandria in the 130s. John Dominic Crossan quotes Koester as stating that New Testament writings are used "neither explicitly nor tacitly" in the Epistle of Barnabas and that this "would argue for an early date, perhaps even before the end of I C.E." Crossan continues (The Cross that Spoke, p. 121):
Richardson and Shukster have also argued for a first-century date. Among several arguments they point to the detail of "a little king, who shall subdue three of the kings under one" and "a little crescent horn, and that it subdued under one three of the great horns" in Barnabas 4:4-5. They propose a composition "date during or immediately after the reign of Nerva (96-8 C.E.) . . . viewed as bringing to an end the glorious Flavian dynasty of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian . . . when a powerful, distinguished, and successful dynasty was brought low, humiliated by an assassin's knife" (33, 40).
In 16:3-4, the Epistle of Barnabas says: "Furthermore he says again, 'Lo, they who destroyed this temple shall themselves build it.' That is happening now. For owing to the war it was destroyed by the enemy; at present even the servants of the enemy will build it up again." This clearly places Barnabas after the destruction of the temple in 70 CE. But it also places Barnabas before the Bar Kochba revolt in 132 CE, after which there could have been no hope that the Romans would help to rebuild the temple. This shows that the document comes from the period between these two revolts.
Jay Curry Treat states on the dating of Barnabas (The Anchor Bible Dictionary, v. 1, pp. 613–614):
Since Barnabas 16:3 refers to the destruction of the temple, Barnabas must be written after 70 C.E. It must be written before its first indisputable use in Clement of Alexandria, ca. 190. Since 16:4 expects the temple to be rebuilt, it was most likely written before Hadrian built a Roman temple on the site ca. 135. Attempts to use 4:4-5 and 16:1-5 to specify the time of origin more exactly have not won wide agreement. It is important to remember that traditions of varying ages have been incorporated into this work.
Treat comments on the provenance of the Epistle of Barnabas (op. cit., p. 613):
Barnabas does not give enough indications to permit confident identification of either the teacher's location or the location to which he writes. His thought, hermeneutical methods, and style have many parallels throughout the known Jewish and Christian worlds. Most scholars have located the work's origin in the area of Alexandria, on the grounds that it has many affinities with Alexandrian Jewish and Christian thought and because its first witnesses are Alexandrian. Recently, Prigent (Prigent and Kraft 1971: 20-24), Wengst (1971: 114-18), and Scorza Barcellona (1975: 62-65) have suggested other origins based on affinities in Palestine, Syria, and Asia Minor. The place of origin must remain an open question, although the Gk-speaking E. Mediterranean appears most probable.
Concerning the relationship between Barnabas and the New Testament, Treat writes (op. cit., p. 614):
Although Barnabas 4:14 appears to quote Matt 22:14, it must remain an open question whether the Barnabas circle knew written gospels. Based on Koester's analysis (1957: 125-27, 157), it appears more likely that Barnabas stood in the living oral tradition used by the written gospels. For example, the reference to gall and vinegar in Barnabas 7:3, 5 seems to preserve an early stage of tradition that influenced the formation of the passion narratives in the Gospel of Peter and the synoptic gospels.

The 5th century "<a href="Decretum%20Gelasianum">Decretum Gelasianum</a>" includes a "Gospel of Barnabas" amongst works condemned as <a href="apocrypha">apocrypha</a>l; but no certain text or quotation from this work has been identified.

Another book using that same title, the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Barnabas">Gospel of Barnabas</a>, survives in two post-medieval manuscripts in Italian and Spanish. Contrary to the canonical Christian <a href="Gospel">Gospel</a>s, and in accordance with the <a href="Islamic%20view%20of%20Jesus">Islamic view of Jesus</a>, this later Gospel of Barnabas states that <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> was not the <a href="son%20of%20God">son of God</a>, but a <a href="Prophets%20of%20Islam">prophet</a> and messenger. The book also says Jesus rose alive into <a href="Heaven">Heaven</a> without having been <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">crucified</a> and mentions <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> by name. Though the exact dating is disputed, the work is not regarded as authentic by any scholar (in other words, it is <a href="pseudepigraphical">pseudepigraphical</a> or <a href="apocryphal">apocryphal</a>).

The Catholic religious order officially known as "<a href="Regular%20Clerics%20of%20St.%20Paul">Regular Clerics of St. Paul</a>" (Clerici Regulares Sancti Pauli), founded in the 16th Century, was in 1538 given the grand old Monastery of Saint Barnabas by the city wall of <a href="Milan">Milan</a>. This becoming their main seat, the Order was thenceforth known by the popular name of "<a href="Barnabites">Barnabites</a>".

Birka

During the <a href="Viking%20Age">Viking Age</a>, Birka ("Birca" in medieval sources), on the island of <a href="Bj%C3%B6rk%C3%B6%2C%20Eker%C3%B6">Björkö</a> (literally: "Birch Island") in present-day <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, was an important trading center which handled goods from <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> as well as <a href="Central%20Europe">Central</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a> and the Orient. Björkö is located in <a href="M%C3%A4laren">Lake Mälaren</a>, 30 kilometers west of contemporary <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, in the municipality of <a href="Eker%C3%B6">Ekerö</a>. The archaeological sites of Birka and <a href="Hovg%C3%A5rden">Hovgården</a>, on the neighbouring island of <a href="Adels%C3%B6">Adelsö</a>, make up an archaeological complex which illustrates the elaborate <a href="trading%20network">trading network</a>s of Viking <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> and their influence on the subsequent history of <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. Generally regarded as Sweden's oldest town, Birka (along with Hovgården) has been a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> since 1993.
A silver ring from a Viking-era grave in Birka is the first ring with Arabic inscription from that era found in Scandinavia.

Established in the middle of the 8th century and thus being one of the earliest urban settlements in Scandinavia, Birka was the Baltic link in <a href="Dnieper%20trade%20route">the river and portage route</a> through <a href="Staraya%20Ladoga">Ladoga</a> (Aldeigja) and <a href="Novgorod">Novgorod</a> (Holmsgard) to the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> and the <a href="Abbasid">Abbasid</a> <a href="Califate">Califate</a>. Birka was also important as the site of the first known <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> in Sweden, founded in 831 by <a href="Ansgar">Saint Ansgar</a>.

Sources are mainly archaeological remains. No texts survive from this area, though the written text "<a href="Vita%20Ansgari">Vita Ansgari</a>" ("The life of Ansgar") by <a href="Rimbert">Rimbert</a> (c. 865) describes the missionary work of <a href="Ansgar">Ansgar</a> around 830 at Birka, and "Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum" (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church) by <a href="Adam%20of%20Bremen">Adam of Bremen</a> in 1075 describes the <a href="archbishop">archbishop</a> Unni, who died at Birka in 936. St Ansgar's work was the first attempt to convert the inhabitants from <a href="Norse%20Mythology">the Norse religion</a> to Christianity, and it was unsuccessful.

Both Rimbert and Adam were German clergymen writing in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>. There are no known <a href="Old%20Norse%20language">Norse</a> sources mentioning the name of the settlement, or even the settlement itself, and the original Norse name of Birka is unknown. "Birca" is the <a href="Romanization">Latinised</a> form given in the sources and "Birka" its contemporary, unhistorical Swedish form. The Latin name is probably derived from an <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> word "<a href="birk%20%28market%20place%29">birk</a>" which probably meant a market place. Related to this was the "Bjärköa law" (<a href="bj%C3%A4rk%C3%B6ar%C3%A4tt">bjärköarätt</a>) which regulated the life on market places in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Both terms in different forms are very common in Scandinavian place names still today leading to speculation that all references to Birca especially by Adam of Bremen were not about the same location.

Both publications are silent on Birca's size, layout and appearance. Based on Rimbert's account, Birca was significant because it had a port and it was the place for the regional <a href="Thing%20%28assembly%29">ting</a>. Adam only mentions the port, but otherwise Birca seems to have been significant to him because it had been the bridgehead of Ansgar's Christian mission and because archbishop Unni had been buried there.

"Vita Ansgari" and "Gesta" are sometimes ambiguous, which has caused some controversy as to whether Birca and the Björkö settlement were the same location. Many other locations have been suggested through the years. However, Björkö is the only location that can show remains of a town of Birca's significance, which is why the vast majority of scholars regard Björkö as the location of Birca.

Birka was abandoned during the later half of the 10th century. Based on the coin finds, the city seems to have silenced around 960. Roughly around the same time, the nearby settlement of <a href="Sigtuna">Sigtuna</a> supplanted Birka as the main trading centre in the <a href="M%C3%A4laren">Mälaren</a> area. The reasons for Birka's decline are disputed. A contributing factor may have been the <a href="post-glacial%20rebound">post-glacial rebound</a>, which lowered the water level of Mälaren changing it from an arm of the sea into a lake and cut Birka off from the nearest (southern) access to the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>. The Baltic island of <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a> was also in a better strategic position for <a href="Dnieper%20trade%20route">Russian-Byzantine trade</a>, and was gaining eminence as a mercantile stronghold. Historian Neil Kent has speculated that the area may have been the victim of an enemy assault.

The <a href="Varangian">Varangian</a> trade stations in <a href="Russia">Russia</a> suffered a serious decline at roughly the same date.

In "<a href="Vita%20Ansgari">Vita Ansgari</a>" ("The life of Ansgar") monk and later <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Bremen">archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen</a> <a href="Rimbert">Rimbert</a> gives the first known description of Birka. The town was the center of Catholic missionary activities in the 9th century Sweden. Rimbert's interests were in the Christian faith, not so much in the Swedish geopolicy, so his descriptions of Birka remain approximate at best.

This is how it all started in 829:

Ansgar was already experienced in the missionary work in <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, and set forth to Sweden. Rimbert describes the trip very generally:

Rimbert does not say where Ansgar sailed off or where he landed. Noteworthy is just his note about several "seas" that they had to cross to get to Birka from the place they had landed to. Since Rimbert mentions them to have crossed the seas by ship "where it was possible" they clearly had the alternative of going around them as well, meaning that the seas were probably the numerous lakes in southern Sweden. When Ansgar again travelled to Birka from Germany about 852, it went easier:

This might mean that he sailed off from <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> or <a href="Bremen%20%28city%29">Bremen</a> instead of some port in Baltic Sea, since the later account by Adam of Bremen gives the distance of <a href="Scania">Scania</a> and Birka to be only 5 days at sea.

Several Swedish kings of the 9th century, <a href="Bj%C3%B6rn%20at%20Haugi">Björn</a>, <a href="Anund%20Uppsale">Anund</a> and <a href="Olof%20%28I%29%20of%20Sweden">Olof</a>, are all mentioned in "Vita" to have spent time in Birka. None of them is however said to have had his residence there, as the Swedish king and his retinue routinely moved between the <a href="Husby%20%28estate%29">Husby</a>s, parts of the network of royal estates called <a href="Uppsala%20%C3%B6d">Uppsala öd</a>.

King Björn met Ansgar in Birka when he arrived there in 829 (Chapter XI). Later king Olof met him there as well during his last trip in 852 (Chapter XXVI).

Ansgar's missionary work resulted in first churches to be built in Sweden. Talking about <a href="Herigar">Herigar</a>, the prefect of Birka:

Herigar's church was not far from the place where tings were held:

Another church was also built in Sweden, however location is left open:

The exiled Swedish King <a href="Anund%20Uppsale">Anund Uppsale</a> confirms that either one of the churches was in Birka itself when he ponders if Birka should be plundered:

Danes attacked Birka, accompanied with the deposed king <a href="Anund%20Uppsale">Anund</a>, which caused great distress in the town.

As the neighbouring "city" is not mentioned in any other context than during the Danish attack as a place where people took refuge, it probably meant a nearby fortress. Eventually Danes left, sparing Birka from destruction.

When Ansgar asked if King <a href="Olof%20%28I%29%20of%20Sweden">Olof</a> would permit him to establish the Christian religion in the kingdom during his second visit in 852, the king said to him:

<a href="Thing%20%28assembly%29">Tings</a> were huge open-air events, which required plenty of space. The more important ting that king Olof talked about was probably the "<a href="Thing%20of%20all%20Swedes">Ting of all Swedes</a>", which was held at the end of February in <a href="Uppsala">Uppsala</a>, during the <a href="Disting">Disting</a>. The king was obliged to obey the common decisions made at this ting, and the most powerful man at this assembly was not the king, but the <a href="lawspeaker">lawspeaker</a> of <a href="Tiundaland">Tiundaland</a>. Locally important tings were the Westrogothic "<a href="Thing%20of%20all%20Geats">Ting of all Geats</a>" in Skara and the Ostrogothic "<a href="Lionga%20thing">Lionga ting</a>" in the vicinity of today's <a href="Link%C3%B6ping">Linköping</a>.

In "<a href="Gesta%20Hammaburgensis%20ecclesiae%20pontificum">Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum</a>" (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church), Adam of Bremen mentions Birka many times, and the book is the main source of information on the city. After its initial release in 1075/6, "Gesta" was complemented with supplementary "Scholias" until the death of Adam in the 1080s. Birca is described as an existing city in the original version, but then as destroyed in "Scholia 138".

One of Adam's main sources had been the German bishop <a href="Adalvard">Adalvard the Younger</a> of <a href="Sigtuna">Sigtuna</a> and later of <a href="Skara">Skara</a> as hinted in "Scholia 119". He was also very familiar with Rimbert's work. Adam himself never visited Birka.

Adam described Birka as a <a href="Geat">Geat</a>ish port town and had gathered many details about it.

Having described <a href="V%C3%A4sterg%C3%B6tland">Västergötland</a> and <a href="Skara">Skara</a>, Adam writes:

Noteworthy in the following statement is the usage of the term "not far" (non longe) which was also used to describe the distance between Birka and the Uppsala temple:

Adam also had travel instructions from Skåne to <a href="Sigtuna">Sigtuna</a>:

"Telgas" is not mentioned anywhere else, and it remains as speculative as Birka. The most popular identification among many telge names in Sweden is <a href="S%C3%B6dert%C3%A4lje">Södertälje</a>. "Scholia 121" of IV 20 tells also:

The following definition remains even more mysterious:

Since it is physically impossible for any Swedish town to face Jumne, the latter being situated along <a href="Oder">River Oder</a>, Adam's statement is probably a misunderstanding. No place having a similar name to Birka is known to have situated on the opposite shore of Oder, so it may be possible that something similar to Jumne was located opposite to Birka.

<a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Bremen">Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen</a> that oversaw the missionary work in Scandinavia until 1103, had appointed bishops to Sweden at least from 1014 onwards, the first see being in <a href="Skara">Skara</a>. Several bishops were appointed for Sweden in 1060s, one also for Birka.

"Scholia 94" appends this as follows:

Furthermore, the following was said about John's location after talking about Birka:

John seems to have been situated in Birka in order to prepare for the missionary work among the many heathen people that flooded to Birca from around the Baltic coasts. This was a logical continuation to Birka's position as the first missionary town in Sweden. Noteworthy here is that the biggest islands in the Baltic Sea, <a href="%C3%96land">Öland</a> and <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a>, were part of the <a href="diocese%20of%20Link%C3%B6ping">diocese of Linköping</a> in the Middle Ages, covering also Östergötland and eastern <a href="Sm%C3%A5land">Småland</a>.

"Scholia 122" of IV 20 locates the tomb of Hamburg's archbishop <a href="Unni%20%28archbishop%29">Unni</a> in Birka:

According to "Gesta", Unni had died in 936 (I 64).

After having consistently described Birka as an existing city, "Scholia 138" of IV 29 describes Birka's sudden demise. Talking about <a href="Adalvard">Adalvard the Younger</a>, the bishop of Sigtuna and later that of Skara, Adam or a later copyist has written:

The remark does not make it clear if Adalvard found the city destroyed or if that had happened after his visit and the later remark was just to warn the future pilgrims not to go there anymore in vain. As Adalvard was back in Bremen already by 1069 and is mentioned as one of Adam's sources of information, it would have been expected that word about Birka's destruction had reached also Adam before he published his work half a decade later.

The exact location of Birca was also lost during the centuries, leading to speculation from Swedish historians. However, the island of Björkö was first claimed to have been Birka already about 1450 in the so-called "<a href="Chronicle%20of%20Sweden">Chronicle of Sweden</a>" ("Prosaiska krönikan"):

In search of Birka, National Antiquarian <a href="Johan%20Hadorph">Johan Hadorph</a> was the first to attempt excavations on Björkö in the late 17th century.

In the late 19th century, <a href="Hjalmar%20Stolpe">Hjalmar Stolpe</a>, an <a href="Entomology">entomologist</a> by education, arrived on Björkö to study fossilized insects found in <a href="amber">amber</a> on the island. Stolpe found very large amounts of amber on the island, which is unusual since amber is not normally found in lake Mälaren. Stolpe speculated that the island may have been an important trading post, prompting him to conduct a series of archeological excavations between 1871-95. The excavations soon indicated that a major settlement had been located on the island and eventually Stolpe spent two decades excavating the island. After Björkö came to be identified with ancient Birka, it has been assumed that the original name of Birka was simply "Bierkø" (sometimes spelt "Bjärkö"), an earlier form of "Björkö".

Ownership of Björkö is today mainly in private hands, and used for farming. The settlement site, however is an <a href="archaeological">archaeological</a> site, and a <a href="museum">museum</a> has been built nearby for exhibition of finds (mostly replicas), models and reconstructions. It is a popular site to visit during the summer times. The complete collection of archaeological finds from the excavations on Björkö are held by <a href="Swedish%20Museum%20of%20National%20Antiquities">The Swedish History Museum</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, and many of the artefacts are on display there.

The archaeological remains are located in the north part of Björkö and span an area of about 7 <a href="hectare">hectare</a>s (17 <a href="acre">acre</a>s). The remains are both burial-sites and buildings, and in the south part of this area, there is also a <a href="hill%20fort">hill fort</a> called "Borgen" ("The Fortress"). The construction technique of the buildings is still unknown, but the main material was <a href="wood">wood</a>. An adjacent island holds the remains of <a href="Hovg%C3%A5rden">Hovgården</a>, an estate which housed the King's retinue during visits.

Approximately 700 people lived at Birka when it was at its largest, and about 3,000 graves have been found. Its administrative center was supposedly located outside of the settlement itself, on the nearby island of <a href="Adels%C3%B6">Adelsö</a>.

The most recent large excavation was undertaken between 1990-95 in a region of <a href="dark%20earth">dark earth</a>, believed to be the site of the main settlement. Björkö is today mainly agricultural, and shipping lines carry tourists to the island, where a museum showcases a view of life during the Viking era.

Beta-lactamase

Beta-lactamases (β-lactamases, also known as penicillinase) are <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s () produced by bacteria, that provide <a href="Multiple%20drug%20resistance">multi-</a><a href="antibiotic%20resistance">resistance</a> to <a href="%CE%B2-lactam%20antibiotic">β-lactam antibiotic</a>s such as <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>s, <a href="Cephalosporin">Cephalosporin</a>s, <a href="cephamycin">cephamycin</a>s, and <a href="carbapenem">carbapenem</a>s (<a href="ertapenem">ertapenem</a>), although <a href="carbapenem">carbapenem</a>s are relatively resistant to beta-lactamase. Beta-lactamase provides antibiotic resistance by breaking the <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s' structure. These antibiotics all have a common element in their molecular structure: a four-atom ring known as a <a href="%CE%B2-lactam">β-lactam</a>. Through <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a>, the lactamase enzyme breaks the β-lactam ring open, deactivating the molecule's antibacterial properties.

Beta-lactam antibiotics are typically used to treat a broad spectrum of <a href="Gram-positive">Gram-positive</a> and <a href="Gram-negative">Gram-negative</a> bacteria.

Beta-lactamases produced by Gram-negative organisms are usually secreted, especially when antibiotics are present in the environment.

The structure of a "<a href="Streptomyces">Streptomyces</a>" β-lactamase is given by .

Penicillinase is a specific type of β-lactamase, showing specificity for <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>s, again by <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolysing</a> the <a href="%CE%B2-lactam">β-lactam</a> ring. Molecular weights of the various penicillinases tend to cluster near 50 kiloDaltons.

Penicillinase was the first β-lactamase to be identified: It was first isolated by Abraham and Chain in 1940 from Gram-negative "E. coli" even before penicillin entered clinical use, but penicillinase production quickly spread to bacteria that previously did not produce it or produced it only rarely. Penicillinase-resistant beta-lactams such as <a href="methicillin">methicillin</a> were developed, but there is now widespread <a href="antibiotic%20resistance">resistance</a> to even these.

The following functional classification for beta lactamases has been proposed:


Group 2 are penicillinases, cephalosporinases, or both inhibited by clavulanic acid, corresponding to the molecular classes A and D reflecting the original TEM and SHV genes. Additionally, many class A TEM β-lactamases are inhibited by <a href="Beta-lactamase%20inhibitor%20protein">β-lactamase inhibitor protein</a> (BLIP). Because of the increasing number of TEM- and SHV-derived β-lactamases, they were divided into two subclasses, 2a and 2b.











The molecular classification of β-lactamases is based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequences in these enzymes. To date, four classes are recognised (A-D), correlating with the functional classification. Classes A, C, and D act by a <a href="serine">serine</a>-based mechanism, whereas class B or <a href="metallo-beta-lactamase%20protein%20fold">metallo-β-lactamases</a> need <a href="zinc">zinc</a> for their action

"Penicillinase" was discovered in 1940 and renamed Beta-lactamase when the structure of the Beta-lactam ring was finally elucidated.

Among Gram-negative bacteria, the emergence of resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins has been a major concern. It appeared initially in a limited number of bacterial species ("<a href="Enterobacter%20cloacae">C. cloacae</a>", "<a href="Citrobacter%20freundii">C. freundii</a>", "<a href="S.%20marcescens">S. marcescens</a>", and "<a href="P.%20aeruginosa">P. aeruginosa</a>") that could mutate to hyperproduce their chromosomal class C β-lactamase. A few years later, resistance appeared in bacterial species not naturally producing AmpC enzymes ("<a href="K.%20pneumoniae">K. pneumoniae</a>", "<a href="Salmonella">Salmonella</a>" spp., "<a href="Proteus%20mirabilis">P. mirabilis</a>") due to the production of TEM- or SHV-type ESBLs. Characteristically, such resistance has included oxyimino- (for example <a href="ceftizoxime">ceftizoxime</a>, <a href="cefotaxime">cefotaxime</a>, <a href="ceftriaxone">ceftriaxone</a>, and <a href="ceftazidime">ceftazidime</a>, as well as the oxyimino-monobactam <a href="aztreonam">aztreonam</a>), but not 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins (<a href="cephamycins">cephamycins</a>; in other words, <a href="cefoxitin">cefoxitin</a> and <a href="cefotetan">cefotetan</a>); has been blocked by inhibitors such as <a href="clavulanate">clavulanate</a>, <a href="sulbactam">sulbactam</a>, or <a href="tazobactam">tazobactam</a>, and did not involve <a href="carbapenems">carbapenems</a> and <a href="temocillin">temocillin</a>. Chromosomal-mediated AmpC β-lactamases represent a new threat, since they confer resistance to 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins (<a href="cephamycins">cephamycins</a>) such as <a href="cefoxitin">cefoxitin</a> or <a href="cefotetan">cefotetan</a> are not affected by commercially available β-lactamase inhibitors, and can, in strains with loss of outer membrane porins, provide resistance to carbapenems.

Members of the family commonly express <a href="plasmid">plasmid</a>-encoded β-lactamases (e.g., TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1). which confer resistance to penicillins but not to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. In the mid-1980s, a new group of enzymes, the extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), was detected (first detected in 1979). The prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria have been gradually increasing in acute care hospitals. ESBLs are beta-lactamases that hydrolyze extended-spectrum cephalosporins with an oxyimino side chain. These cephalosporins include <a href="cefotaxime">cefotaxime</a>, <a href="ceftriaxone">ceftriaxone</a>, and <a href="ceftazidime">ceftazidime</a>, as well as the oxyimino-monobactam <a href="aztreonam">aztreonam</a>. Thus ESBLs confer <a href="Multiple%20drug%20resistance">multi-resistance</a> to these antibiotics and related oxyimino-beta lactams. In typical circumstances, they derive from genes for TEM-1, TEM-2, or SHV-1 by mutations that alter the amino acid configuration around the active site of these β-lactamases. A broader set of β-lactam antibiotics are susceptible to hydrolysis by these enzymes. An increasing number of ESBLs not of TEM or SHV lineage have recently been described. The ESBLs are frequently plasmid encoded. Plasmids responsible for ESBL production frequently carry genes encoding resistance to other drug classes (for example, aminoglycosides). Therefore, antibiotic options in the treatment of ESBL-producing organisms are extremely limited. <a href="Carbapenem">Carbapenem</a>s are the treatment of choice for serious infections due to ESBL-producing organisms, yet carbapenem-resistant (primarily <a href="ertapenem">ertapenem</a> resistant) isolates have recently been reported. ESBL-producing organisms may appear susceptible to some extended-spectrum <a href="cephalosporin">cephalosporin</a>s. However, treatment with such antibiotics has been associated with high failure rates.

TEM-1 is the most commonly encountered beta-lactamase in <a href="Gram-negative">Gram-negative</a> bacteria. Up to 90% of ampicillin resistance in <a href="Escherichia%20coli">"E. coli"</a> is due to the production of TEM-1. Also responsible for the ampicillin and penicillin resistance that is seen in "<a href="H.%20influenzae">H. influenzae</a>" and "<a href="N.%20gonorrhoeae">N. gonorrhoeae</a>" in increasing numbers. Although TEM-type beta-lactamases are most often found in "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a>" and "<a href="K.%20pneumoniae">K. pneumoniae</a>", they are also found in other species of Gram-negative bacteria with increasing frequency. The amino acid substitutions responsible for the <a href="Beta-lactamase%23Extended-spectrum%20beta-lactamase%20.28ESBL.29">extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)</a> phenotype cluster around the active site of the enzyme and change its configuration, allowing access to oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates. Opening the active site to beta-lactam substrates also typically enhances the susceptibility of the enzyme to β-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanic acid. Single amino acid substitutions at positions 104, 164, 238, and 240 produce the ESBL phenotype, but ESBLs with the broadest spectrum usually have more than a single amino acid substitution. Based upon different combinations of changes, currently 140 TEM-type enzymes have been described. TEM-10, TEM-12, and TEM-26 are among the most common in the United States.

SHV-1 shares 68 percent of its amino acids with TEM-1 and has a similar overall structure. The SHV-1 beta-lactamase is most commonly found in "<a href="K.%20pneumoniae">K. pneumoniae</a>" and is responsible for up to 20% of the plasmid-mediated ampicillin resistance in this species. ESBLs in this family also have amino acid changes around the active site, most commonly at positions 238 or 238 and 240. More than 60 SHV varieties are known. SHV-5 and SHV-12 are among the most common.

These enzymes were named for their greater activity against <a href="cefotaxime">cefotaxime</a> than other oxyimino-beta-lactam substrates (e.g., <a href="ceftazidime">ceftazidime</a>, <a href="ceftriaxone">ceftriaxone</a>, or <a href="cefepime">cefepime</a>). Rather than arising by mutation, they represent examples of plasmid acquisition of beta-lactamase genes normally found on the chromosome of "<a href="Kluyvera">Kluyvera</a>" species, a group of rarely pathogenic commensal organisms. These enzymes are not very closely related to TEM or SHV beta-lactamases in that they show only approximately 40% identity with these two commonly isolated beta-lactamases. More than 80 CTX-M enzymes are currently known. Despite their name, a few are more active on <a href="ceftazidime">ceftazidime</a> than <a href="cefotaxime">cefotaxime</a>. They have mainly been found in strains of "<a href="Salmonella%20enterica">Salmonella enterica</a>" serovar "Typhimurium" and "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a>", but have also been described in other species of <a href="Enterobacteriaceae">Enterobacteriaceae</a> and are the predominant ESBL type in parts of South America. (They are also seen in eastern Europe) CTX-M-14, CTX-M-3, and CTX-M-2 are the most widespread. CTX-M-15 is currently (2006) the most widespread type in "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a>" the UK and is widely prevalent in the community. An example of beta-lactamase CTX-M-15, along with IS"Ecp1", has been found to have recently transposed onto the chromosome of "<a href="Klebsiella%20pneumoniae">Klebsiella pneumoniae</a>" ATCC BAA-2146.

OXA beta-lactamases were long recognized as a less common but also plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase variety that could hydrolyze <a href="oxacillin">oxacillin</a> and related anti-staphylococcal penicillins. These beta-lactamases differ from the TEM and SHV enzymes in that they belong to molecular class D and functional group 2d . The OXA-type beta-lactamases confer resistance to <a href="ampicillin">ampicillin</a> and <a href="cephalothin">cephalothin</a> and are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against <a href="oxacillin">oxacillin</a> and <a href="cloxacillin">cloxacillin</a> and the fact that they are poorly inhibited by <a href="clavulanic%20acid">clavulanic acid</a>. Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. While most ESBLs have been found in "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a>", "<a href="K.%20pneumoniae">K. pneumoniae</a>", and other <a href="Enterobacteriaceae">Enterobacteriaceae</a>, the OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in "<a href="P.%20aeruginosa">P. aeruginosa</a>". OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in "<a href="Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a>" isolates from Turkey and France. The OXA beta-lactamase family was originally created as a phenotypic rather than a genotypic group for a few beta-lactamases that had a specific hydrolysis profile. Therefore, there is as little as 20% sequence homology among some of the members of this family. However, recent additions to this family show some degree of homology to one or more of the existing members of the OXA beta-lactamase family. Some confer resistance predominantly to ceftazidime, but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to cefotaxime and cefepime than it does resistance to ceftazidime.

Other plasmid-mediated ESBLs, such as PER, VEB, GES, and IBC beta-lactamases, have been described but are uncommon and have been found mainly in "<a href="P.%20aeruginosa">P. aeruginosa</a>" and at a limited number of geographic sites. PER-1 in isolates in Turkey, France, and Italy; VEB-1 and VEB-2 in strains from Southeast Asia; and GES-1, GES-2, and IBC-2 in isolates from South Africa, France, and Greece. PER-1 is also common in multiresistant acinetobacter species in Korea and Turkey. Some of these enzymes are found in Enterobacteriaceae as well, whereas other uncommon ESBLs (such as BES-1, IBC-1, SFO-1, and TLA-1) have been found only in Enterobacteriaceae.

While ESBL-producing organisms were previously associated with hospitals and institutional care, these organisms are now increasingly found in the community. CTX-M-15-positive <a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a> are a cause of community-acquired <a href="cystitis">urinary infections</a> in the UK, and tend to be resistant to all oral β-lactam antibiotics, as well as <a href="quinolone%20antibiotic">quinolones</a> and <a href="sulfonamide%20%28medicine%29">sulfonamide</a>s. Treatment options may include <a href="nitrofurantoin">nitrofurantoin</a>, <a href="fosfomycin">fosfomycin</a>, <a href="mecillinam">mecillinam</a> and <a href="chloramphenicol">chloramphenicol</a>. In desperation, once-daily <a href="ertapenem">ertapenem</a> or <a href="gentamicin">gentamicin</a> injections may also be used.

Although the inhibitor-resistant β-lactamases are not ESBLs, they are often discussed with ESBLs because they are also derivatives of the classical TEM- or SHV-type enzymes. These enzymes were at first given the designation IRT for inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamase; however, all have subsequently been renamed with numerical TEM designations. There are at least 19 distinct inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamases. Inhibitor-resistant TEM β-lactamases have been found mainly in clinical isolates of "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a>", but also some strains of "<a href="K.%20pneumoniae">K. pneumoniae</a>", "<a href="Klebsiella%20oxytoca">Klebsiella oxytoca</a>", "<a href="Proteus%20mirabilis">P. mirabilis</a>", and "<a href="Citrobacter%20freundii">Citrobacter freundii</a>". Although the inhibitor-resistant TEM variants are resistant to inhibition by <a href="clavulanic%20acid">clavulanic acid</a> and <a href="sulbactam">sulbactam</a>, thereby showing clinical resistance to the beta-lactam—lactamase inhibitor combinations of <a href="amoxicillin">amoxicillin</a>-<a href="clavulanate">clavulanate</a> (<a href="co-amoxiclav">co-amoxiclav</a>), <a href="ticarcillin">ticarcillin</a>-<a href="clavulanate">clavulanate</a> (<a href="co-ticarclav">co-ticarclav</a>), and <a href="ampicillin/sulbactam">ampicillin/sulbactam</a>, they normally remain susceptible to inhibition by <a href="tazobactam">tazobactam</a> and subsequently the combination of <a href="piperacillin/tazobactam">piperacillin/tazobactam</a>, although resistance has been described. This is no longer a primarily European epidemiology, it is found in northern parts of America often and should be tested for with complex UTI's.

AmpC type β-lactamases are commonly isolated from extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. AmpC β-lactamases (also termed class C or group 1) are typically encoded on the chromosome of many Gram-negative bacteria including "<a href="Citrobacter">Citrobacter</a>", "<a href="Serratia">Serratia</a>" and "<a href="Enterobacter">Enterobacter</a>" species where its expression is usually <a href="Regulation%20of%20gene%20expression%23Inducible%20vs.%20repressible%20systems">inducible</a>; it may also occur on "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">Escherichia coli</a>" but is not usually inducible, although it can be hyperexpressed. AmpC type β-lactamases may also be carried on plasmids. AmpC β-lactamases, in contrast to ESBLs, hydrolyse broad and extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cephamycins as well as to oxyimino-β-lactams) but are not inhibited by β-lactamase inhibitors such as <a href="clavulanic%20acid">clavulanic acid</a>.

Carbapenems are famously stable to AmpC β-lactamases and extended-spectrum-β-lactamases. Carbapenemases are a diverse group of β-lactamases that are active not only against the oxyimino-cephalosporins and cephamycins but also against the carbapenems. Aztreonam is stable to the metallo-β-lactamases,
but many IMP and VIM producers are resistant, owing to other mechanisms. Carbapenemases were formerly believed to derive only from classes A, B, and D, but a class C carbapenemase has been described.

Plasmid-mediated IMP-type carbapenemases, 17 varieties of which are currently known, became established in Japan in the 1990s both in enteric Gram-negative organisms and in "<a href="Pseudomonas">Pseudomonas</a>" and "<a href="Acinetobacter">Acinetobacter</a>" species. IMP enzymes spread slowly to other countries in the Far East, were reported from Europe in 1997, and have been found in Canada and Brazil.

A second growing family of carbapenemases, the VIM family, was reported from Italy in 1999 and now includes 10 members, which have a wide geographic distribution in Europe, South America, and the Far East and have been found in the United States. VIM-1 was discovered in "P. aeruginosa" in Italy in 1996; since then, VIM-2 - now the predominant variant - was found repeatedly in Europe and the Far East; VIM-3 and -4 are minor variants of VIM-2 and -1, respectively. VIM enzymes occur mostly in "P. aeruginosa", also "P. putida" and, very rarely, Enterobacteriaceae.

Amino acid sequence diversity is up to 10% in the VIM family, 15% in the IMP family, and 70% between VIM and IMP. Enzymes of both the families, nevertheless, are similar. Both are integron-associated, sometimes within plasmids. Both hydrolyse all β-lactams except monobactams, and evade all β-lactam inhibitors. The VIM enzymes are among the most widely distributed MBLs, with >40 VIM variants having been reported. Biochemical and biophysical studies revealed that VIM variants have only small variations in their kinetic parameters but substantial differences in their thermal stabilities and inhibition profiles.

The OXA group of β-lactamases occur mainly in Acinetobacter species and are divided into two clusters. OXA carbapenemases hydrolyse carbapenems very slowly "in vitro", and the high MICs seen for some Acinetobacter hosts (>64 mg/L) may reflect secondary mechanisms. They are sometimes augmented in clinical isolates by additional resistance mechanisms, such as impermeability or efflux. OXA carbapenemases also tend to have a reduced hydrolytic efficiency towards penicillins and cephalosporins.

A few class A enzymes, most noted the plasmid-mediated KPC enzymes, are effective carbapenemases as well. Ten variants, KPC-2 through KPC-11 are known, and they are distinguished by one or two <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> substitutions (KPC-1 was re-sequenced in 2008 and found to be 100% homologous to published sequences of KPC-2). KPC-1 was found in North Carolina, KPC-2 in Baltimore and KPC-3 in New York. They have only 45% homology with SME and NMC/IMI enzymes and, unlike them, can be encoded by self-transmissible plasmids.

, the class A "<a href="Klebsiella%20pneumoniae">Klebsiella pneumoniae</a>" carbapenemase (<a href="Klebsiella%20pneumoniae%23Resistant%20strains">KPC</a>) globally has been the most common carbapenemase, and was first detected in 1996 in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, USA. A 2010 publication indicated that KPC producing Enterobacteriaceae were becoming common in the United States.

The first class C carbapenemase was described in 2006 and was isolated from a virulent strain of "Enterobacter aerogenes". It is carried on a plasmid, pYMG-1, and is therefore transmissible to other bacterial strains.

In general, these are of little clinical significance.

CcrA (CfiA). Its gene occurs in c. 1-3% of B. fragilis isolates, but fewer produce the enzyme since expression demands appropriate migration of an insertion sequence. CcrA was known before imipenem was introduced, and producers have shown little subsequent increase.

Originally described from <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a> in 2009, this gene is now widespread in "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">Escherichia coli</a>" and "<a href="Klebsiella%20pneumoniae">Klebsiella pneumoniae</a>" from India and Pakistan. As of mid-2010, NDM-1 carrying bacteria have been introduced to other countries (including the United States and UK), most probably due to the large number of tourists travelling the globe, who may have picked up the strain from the environment, as strains containing the NDM-1 gene have been found in environmental samples in India. NDM have several variants which share different properties.

In general, an isolate is suspected to be an ESBL producer when it shows "in vitro" susceptibility to the second-generation <a href="cephalosporin">cephalosporin</a>s (<a href="cefoxitin">cefoxitin</a>, <a href="cefotetan">cefotetan</a>) but resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins and to <a href="aztreonam">aztreonam</a>. Moreover, one should suspect these strains when treatment with these agents for Gram-negative infections fails despite reported "in vitro" susceptibility. Once an ESBL-producing strain is detected, the laboratory should report it as "resistant" to all penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam, even if it is tested (in vitro) as susceptible. Associated resistance to <a href="aminoglycosides">aminoglycosides</a> and <a href="trimethoprim">trimethoprim</a>-<a href="sulfamethoxazole">sulfamethoxazole</a>, as well as high frequency of co-existence of <a href="fluoroquinolone">fluoroquinolone</a> resistance, creates problems. Beta-lactamase inhibitors such as <a href="clavulanate">clavulanate</a>, <a href="sulbactam">sulbactam</a>, and <a href="tazobactam">tazobactam</a> "in vitro" inhibit most ESBLs, but the clinical effectiveness of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations cannot be relied on consistently for therapy. <a href="Cephamycins">Cephamycins</a> (<a href="cefoxitin">cefoxitin</a> and <a href="cefotetan">cefotetan</a>) are not hydrolyzed by majority of ESBLs, but are hydrolyzed by associated AmpC-type β-lactamase. Also, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations may not be effective against organisms that produce AmpC-type β-lactamase. Sometimes these strains decrease the expression of outer membrane proteins, rendering them resistant to cephamycins. "In vivo" studies have yielded mixed results against ESBL-producing "<a href="K.%20pneumoniae">K. pneumoniae</a>". (<a href="Cefepime">Cefepime</a>, a fourth-generation cephalosporin, has demonstrated "in vitro" stability in the presence of many ESBL/AmpC strains.) Currently, <a href="carbapenems">carbapenems</a> are, in general, regarded as the preferred agent for treatment of infections due to ESBL-producing organisms. Carbapenems are resistant to ESBL-mediated hydrolysis and exhibit excellent "in vitro" activity against strains of <a href="Enterobacteriaceae">Enterobacteriaceae</a> expressing ESBLs.

Strains producing only ESBLs are susceptible to <a href="cephamycins">cephamycins</a> and <a href="carbapenems">carbapenems</a> "in vitro" and show little if any <a href="inoculum%20effect">inoculum effect</a> with these agents.

For organisms producing TEM and SHV type ESBLs, apparent "in vitro" sensitivity to <a href="cefepime">cefepime</a> and to <a href="piperacillin/tazobactam">piperacillin/tazobactam</a> is common, but both drugs show an inoculum effect, with diminished susceptibility as the size of the inoculum is increased from 10 to 10 organisms.

Strains with some CTX-M–type and OXA-type ESBLs are resistant to <a href="cefepime">cefepime</a> on testing, despite the use of a standard inoculum.

Although the inhibitor-resistant TEM variants are resistant to inhibition by <a href="clavulanic%20acid">clavulanic acid</a> and <a href="sulbactam">sulbactam</a>, thereby showing clinical resistance to the beta-lactam—beta lactamase inhibitor combinations of <a href="amoxicillin">amoxicillin</a>-<a href="clavulanate">clavulanate</a> (<a href="Co-amoxiclav">Co-amoxiclav</a>), <a href="ticarcillin">ticarcillin</a>-<a href="clavulanate">clavulanate</a>, and <a href="ampicillin/sulbactam">ampicillin/sulbactam</a>, they remain susceptible to inhibition by <a href="tazobactam">tazobactam</a> and subsequently the combination of <a href="piperacillin/tazobactam">piperacillin/tazobactam</a>.

AmpC-producing strains are typically resistant to <a href="oxyimino-beta%20lactams">oxyimino-beta lactams</a> and to <a href="cephamycins">cephamycins</a> and are susceptible to <a href="carbapenems">carbapenems</a>; however, diminished porin expression can make such a strain carbapenem-resistant as well.

Strains with IMP-, VIM-, and OXA-type carbapenemases usually remain susceptible. Resistance to non-beta-lactam antibiotics is common in strains making any of these enzymes, such that alternative options for non-beta-lactam therapy need to be determined by direct susceptibility testing. Resistance to <a href="fluoroquinolones">fluoroquinolones</a> and <a href="aminoglycosides">aminoglycosides</a> is especially high.

For infections caused by ESBL-producing "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">Escherichia coli</a>" or "<a href="Klebsiella">Klebsiella</a>" species, treatment with <a href="imipenem">imipenem</a> or <a href="meropenem">meropenem</a> has been associated with the best outcomes in terms of survival and bacteriologic clearance. <a href="Cefepime">Cefepime</a> and <a href="piperacillin/tazobactam">piperacillin/tazobactam</a> have been less successful. <a href="Ceftriaxone">Ceftriaxone</a>, <a href="cefotaxime">cefotaxime</a>, and <a href="ceftazidime">ceftazidime</a> have failed even more often, despite the organism's susceptibility to the antibiotic "in vitro". Several reports have documented failure of <a href="cephamycin">cephamycin</a> therapy as a result of resistance due to porin loss. Some patients have responded to <a href="aminoglycoside">aminoglycoside</a> or <a href="Quinolone%20antibiotic">quinolone</a> therapy, but, in a recent comparison of <a href="ciprofloxacin">ciprofloxacin</a> and <a href="imipenem">imipenem</a> for bacteremia involving an ESBL-producing "<a href="K.%20pneumoniae">K. pneumoniae</a>", <a href="imipenem">imipenem</a> produced the better outcome

There have been few clinical studies to define the optimal therapy for infections caused by ESBL producing "<a href="Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a>" strains.

Beta-lactamase enzymatic activity can be detected using <a href="nitrocefin">nitrocefin</a>, a chromogenic <a href="cephalosporin">cephalosporin</a> substrate which changes color from yellow to red upon beta-lactamase mediated hydrolysis.

Beta-lactamases are ancient bacterial enzymes. The class B beta-lactamases (the metallo-beta-lactamases) are divided into three subclasses: B1, B2 and B3. Subclasses B1 and B2 are theorized to have evolved about one <a href="Bya">billion years ago</a> and subclass B3s is theorized to have evolved before the divergence of the Gram-positive and Gram-negative eubacteria about two billion years ago.

The other three groups are serine enzymes that show little homology to each other. Structural studies have shown that groups A and D are sister taxa and that group C diverged before A and D. These serine-based enzymes, like the group B betalactamases, are of ancient origin and are theorized to have evolved about two billion years ago.

The OXA group (in class D) in particular is theorized to have evolved on chromosomes and moved to plasmids on at least two separate occasions.

The "β" (<a href="beta">beta</a>) refers to the <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>'s position on the second carbon in the ring. "Lactam" is a <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of "lactone" (from the <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> "lactis", "milk", since <a href="lactic%20acid">lactic acid</a> was isolated from soured milk) and "<a href="amide">amide</a>". The suffix "-ase", indicating an enzyme, is derived from "<a href="diastase">diastase</a>" (from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "diastasis", "separation"), the first enzyme discovered in 1833 by Payen and Persoz.

Burhanuddin Rabbani

Burhanuddin Rabbani (; 20 September 1940 – 20 September 2011) was <a href="President%20of%20Afghanistan">President</a> of the <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Afghanistan">Islamic State of Afghanistan</a> from 1992 to 1996. After the <a href="Islamic%20Emirate%20of%20Afghanistan">Taliban government</a> was toppled during <a href="Operation%20Enduring%20Freedom">Operation Enduring Freedom</a>, Rabbani returned to <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a> and served as President from November to December 20, 2001, when <a href="Hamid%20Karzai">Hamid Karzai</a> was chosen at the <a href="International%20Conference%20on%20Afghanistan%2C%20Bonn%20%282001%29">Bonn International Conference on Afghanistan</a>. Rabbani was also the leader of <a href="Jamiat-e%20Islami">Jamiat-e Islami Afghanistan</a> (Islamic Society of Afghanistan).

He was one of the earliest founders and movement leaders of the <a href="Mujahideen">Mujahideen</a> in the early 1970s, right before the <a href="Soviet%20war%20in%20Afghanistan">Soviet invasion of Afghanistan</a>. He served as the political head of the <a href="United%20Islamic%20Front%20for%20the%20Salvation%20of%20Afghanistan">United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan</a> (UIFSA), an alliance of various political groups who fought against the Taliban in Afghanistan. His government was recognized by many countries, as well as the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>. He later became head of Afghanistan National Front (known in the media as <a href="United%20National%20Front%20%28Afghanistan%29">United National Front</a>), the largest political opposition to Hamid Karzai's government. On 20 September 2011, Rabbani was assassinated by a <a href="suicide%20bomber">suicide bomber</a> entering his home in Kabul. As suggested by the Afghan parliament, Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai gave him the title of "Martyr of Peace". His son <a href="Salahuddin%20Rabbani">Salahuddin Rabbani</a> was chosen in April 2012 to lead efforts to forge peace in Afghanistan with the Taliban.

Rabbani, son of Muhammed Yousuf, was born in the northern province of <a href="Badakhshan%20Province">Badakhshan</a>. He was a Persian-speaking ethnic <a href="T%C4%81jik%20people">Tajik</a>. After finishing school in his native province, he went to Darul-uloom-e-Sharia (Abu-Hanifa), a religious school in Kabul. When he graduated from Abu-Hanifa, he attended <a href="Kabul%20University">Kabul University</a> to study Islamic Law and Theology, graduating in 1963.

Soon after his graduation in 1963, he was hired as a professor at Kabul University. In order to enhance himself, Rabbani went to <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> in 1966, and he entered the <a href="Al-Azhar%20University">Al-Azhar University</a> in Cairo where he developed close ties to the <a href="Muslim%20Brotherhood">Muslim Brotherhood</a> leadership. In two years, he received his <a href="masters%20degree">masters degree</a> in <a href="Islamic%20Philosophy">Islamic Philosophy</a>. Rabbani was one of the first Afghans to translate the works of <a href="Sayyid%20Qutb">Sayyid Qutb</a> into <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>. Later he returned to Egypt to complete his PhD in Islamic philosophy and his thesis was titled "The Philosophy and Teachings of Abd al-Rahman Muhammad <a href="Jami">Jami</a>." In 2004 he received Afghanistan's highest academic and scientific title "Academician" from the Academy of Sciences of Afghanistan.

Rabbani returned to Afghanistan in 1968, where the High Council of Jamiat-e Islami gave him the duty of organizing the University students. Due to his knowledge, reputation, and active support for the cause of Islam, in 1972, a 15-member council selected him as head of Jamiat-e Islami of Afghanistan; the founder of Jamiat-e Islami of Afghanistan, Ghulam M. Niyazi was also present. Jamiat-e Islami was primarily composed of Tajiks.
In the spring of 1974, the police came to Kabul University to arrest Rabbani for his pro-Islamic stance, but with the help of his students the police were unable to capture him, and he managed to escape to the countryside. In Pakistan, Rabbani gathered important people and established the party. Sayed Noorullah Emad, who was then a young Muslim in the University of Kabul, became the General Secretary of the party and, later, its deputy chief.

When the <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Afghanistan">Soviets supported the 1979 coup</a>, Rabbani helped lead Jamiat-e Islami in resistance to the <a href="People%27s%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Afghanistan">People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan</a> regime. Rabbani's forces were the first Mujahideen elements to enter Kabul in 1992 when the PDPA government fell from power. He took over as President from 1992 until the Taliban's conquest of Kabul in 1996. For the next five years, he and the <a href="Northern%20Alliance">Northern Alliance</a> were busy fighting the Taliban until the 2001 US-led <a href="Operation%20Enduring%20Freedom">Operation Enduring Freedom</a> in which the Taliban government was toppled. Rabbani was head of Afghanistan’s High Peace Council, which had been formed in 2010 to initiate peace talks with the Taliban and other groups in the insurgency, until his death.

Rabbani was killed in a <a href="Suicide%20attack">suicide bombing</a> at his home in Kabul on 20 September 2011, his 71st birthday. Two men posing as Taliban representatives approached him to offer a hug and detonated their explosives. At least one of them had hidden the explosives in his <a href="turban">turban</a>. The suicide bomber claimed to be a Taliban commander and said he wanted to "discuss peace" with Rabbani. Four other members of Afghanistan’s High Peace Council were also killed in the blast.

Afghan officials blamed the <a href="Quetta%20Shura">Quetta Shura</a>, which is the leadership of the Afghan Taliban hiding in the affluent <a href="Satellite%20Town%2C%20Quetta">Satellite Town</a> of <a href="Quetta">Quetta</a> in <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. The Pakistani government confirmed that Rabbani's assassination was linked to <a href="Afghans%20in%20Pakistan">Afghan refugees in Pakistan</a>. A senior Pakistani official stated that over 90% of terrorist attacks in Pakistan are traced back to Afghan elements and that their presence in the country was "an important issue for Pakistan" and "a problem for Afghanistan". Pakistani foreign minister <a href="Hina%20Rabbani%20Khar">Hina Rabbani Khar</a> said that "We are not responsible if Afghan refugees crossed the border and entered Kabul, stayed in a guest house and attacked Professor Rabbani".

In 2011, just days before he died, Rabbani was trying to persuade Islamic scholars to issue a religious edict banning suicide bombings. The former president's 29-year-old daughter said in an interview that her father died shortly after he spoke at a conference on "Islamic Awakening" in <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>. "Right before he was assassinated, he talked about the suicide bombing issue," <a href="Fatima%20Rabbani">Fatima Rabbani</a> told <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a>. "He called on all Islamic scholars in the conference to release a <a href="fatwa">fatwa</a>" against the tactic.

United States President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> and several <a href="NATO">NATO</a> military leaders condemned the assassination. Japan also offered its condolences at the <a href="Sixty-sixth%20session%20of%20the%20United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">Sixty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly</a>. Afghan President <a href="Hamid%20Karzai">Hamid Karzai</a> cut short his trip for the <a href="General%20debate%20of%20the%20sixty-sixth%20session%20of%20the%20United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">General debate of the sixty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly</a> following his assassination. Rabbani's son Salahuddin then took over chairmanship of the High Peace Council from his father.

Boeing 747

The Boeing 747 is an American <a href="wide-body%20aircraft">wide-body</a> commercial <a href="jet%20airliner">jet airliner</a> and <a href="cargo%20aircraft">cargo aircraft</a>, often referred to by its original nickname, ""Jumbo Jet"". Its distinctive "hump" upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft makes it among the world's most recognizable aircraft, and it was the first wide-body produced. Manufactured by <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a>'s <a href="Boeing%20Commercial%20Airplanes">Commercial Airplane</a> unit in the United States, the original version of the 747 was envisioned to have 150 percent greater capacity than the <a href="Boeing%20707">Boeing 707</a>, one of the common large commercial aircraft of the 1960s. First flown commercially in 1970, the 747 held the passenger capacity record for 37 years. 

The four-engine 747 uses a <a href="double-deck%20aircraft">double-deck</a> configuration for part of its length. It is available in passenger, freighter and other versions. Boeing designed the 747's hump-like upper deck to serve as a first class lounge or extra seating, and to allow the aircraft to be easily converted to a cargo carrier by removing seats and installing a front cargo door. Boeing did so because the company expected <a href="Supersonic%20transport">supersonic airliners</a> (development of which was announced in the early 1960s) to render the 747 and other <a href="subsonic%20airliner">subsonic airliner</a>s obsolete, while the demand for subsonic cargo aircraft would be robust well into the future. The 747 was expected to become obsolete after 400 were sold, but it exceeded critics' expectations with production passing the 1,000 mark in 1993. By August 2017, 1,533 aircraft had been built, with 20 of the 747-8 variants remaining on order. , the 747 has been involved in 60 <a href="hull%20loss">hull loss</a>es, resulting in fatalities.

The <a href="Boeing%20747-400">747-400</a>, the most common passenger version in service, has a high-subsonic <a href="cruise%20speed">cruise speed</a> of <a href="Mach%20number">Mach</a> 0.85–0.855 (up to ) with an intercontinental range of 7,260 <a href="nautical%20mile">nautical mile</a>s (8,350 mi or 13,450 km). The 747-400 passenger version can accommodate 416 passengers in a typical <a href="Travel%20class">three-class layout</a>, 524 passengers in a typical two-class layout, or 660 passengers in a high density one-class configuration. The newest version of the aircraft, the <a href="Boeing%20747-8">747-8</a>, is in production and received certification in 2011. Deliveries of the 747-8F freighter version began in October 2011; deliveries of the 747-8I passenger version began in May 2012.

In 1963, the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> started a series of study projects on a very large strategic transport aircraft. Although the <a href="C-141%20Starlifter">C-141 Starlifter</a> was being introduced, they believed that a much larger and more capable aircraft was needed, especially the capability to carry outsized cargo that would not fit in any existing aircraft. These studies led to initial requirements for the CX-Heavy Logistics System (CX-HLS) in March 1964 for an aircraft with a load capacity of and a speed of Mach 0.75 (), and an unrefueled range of with a payload of . The payload bay had to be wide by high and long with access through doors at the front and rear.

Featuring only four engines, the design also required new engine designs with greatly increased power and better fuel economy. In May 1964, airframe proposals arrived from Boeing, <a href="Douglas%20Aircraft%20Company">Douglas</a>, <a href="General%20Dynamics">General Dynamics</a>, <a href="Lockheed%20Corporation">Lockheed</a>, and <a href="Martin%20Marietta">Martin Marietta</a>; engine proposals were submitted by <a href="GE%20Aviation">General Electric</a>, <a href="Curtiss-Wright">Curtiss-Wright</a>, and <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney">Pratt & Whitney</a>. After a downselect, Boeing, Douglas, and Lockheed were given additional study contracts for the airframe, along with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for the engines.

All three of the airframe proposals shared a number of features. As the CX-HLS needed to be able to be loaded from the front, a door had to be included where the cockpit usually was. All of the companies solved this problem by moving the cockpit above the cargo area; Douglas had a small "pod" just forward and above the wing, Lockheed used a long "spine" running the length of the aircraft with the wing spar passing through it, while Boeing blended the two, with a longer pod that ran from just behind the nose to just behind the wing. In 1965 Lockheed's aircraft design and General Electric's engine design were selected for the new <a href="C-5%20Galaxy">C-5 Galaxy</a> transport, which was the largest military aircraft in the world at the time. The nose door and raised cockpit concepts would be carried over to the design of the 747.

The 747 was conceived while air travel was increasing in the 1960s. The era of commercial jet transportation, led by the enormous popularity of the <a href="Boeing%20707">Boeing 707</a> and <a href="Douglas%20DC-8">Douglas DC-8</a>, had revolutionized long-distance travel. Even before it lost the CX-HLS contract, Boeing was asked by <a href="Juan%20Trippe">Juan Trippe</a>, president of <a href="Pan%20American%20World%20Airways">Pan American World Airways</a> (Pan Am), one of their most important airline customers, to build a passenger aircraft more than twice the size of the 707. During this time, airport congestion, worsened by increasing numbers of passengers carried on relatively small aircraft, became a problem that Trippe thought could be addressed by a larger new aircraft.

In 1965, <a href="Joe%20Sutter">Joe Sutter</a> was transferred from Boeing's <a href="Boeing%20737">737</a> development team to manage the design studies for the new airliner, already assigned the model number 747. Sutter initiated a design study with Pan Am and other airlines, to better understand their requirements. At the time, it was widely thought that the 747 would eventually be superseded by <a href="supersonic%20transport">supersonic transport</a> aircraft. Boeing responded by designing the 747 so that it could be adapted easily to carry freight and remain in production even if sales of the passenger version declined. In the freighter role, the clear need was to support the <a href="Containerization">containerized shipping</a> methodologies that were being widely introduced at about the same time. Standard containers are square at the front (slightly higher due to attachment points) and available in lengths. This meant that it would be possible to support a 2-wide 2-high stack of containers two or three ranks deep with a fuselage size similar to the earlier CX-HLS project.
In April 1966, Pan Am ordered 25 747-100 aircraft for US$525 million. During the ceremonial 747 contract-signing banquet in Seattle on Boeing's 50th Anniversary, Juan Trippe predicted that the 747 would be "... a great weapon for peace, competing with <a href="Intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile">intercontinental missiles</a> for mankind's destiny". As launch customer, and because of its early involvement before placing a formal order, Pan Am was able to influence the design and development of the 747 to an extent unmatched by a single airline before or since.

Ultimately, the high-winged CX-HLS Boeing design was not used for the 747, although technologies developed for their bid had an influence. The original design included a full-length double-deck fuselage with eight-across seating and two aisles on the lower deck and seven-across seating and two aisles on the upper deck. However, concern over evacuation routes and limited cargo-carrying capability caused this idea to be scrapped in early 1966 in favor of a wider single deck design. The cockpit was, therefore, placed on a shortened upper deck so that a freight-loading door could be included in the nose cone; this design feature produced the 747's distinctive "bulge". In early models it was not clear what to do with the small space in the pod behind the cockpit, and this was initially specified as a "lounge" area with no permanent seating. (A different configuration that had been considered in order to keep the flight deck out of the way for freight loading had the pilots below the passengers, and was dubbed the "anteater".)
One of the principal technologies that enabled an aircraft as large as the 747 to be drawn up was the <a href="High-bypass%20turbofan%20engine%23High-bypass%20turbofan">high-bypass turbofan engine</a>. The engine technology was thought to be capable of delivering double the power of the earlier <a href="turbojet">turbojet</a>s while consuming a third less fuel. General Electric had pioneered the concept but was committed to developing the engine for the C-5 Galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later. Pratt & Whitney was also working on the same principle and, by late 1966, Boeing, Pan Am and Pratt & Whitney agreed to develop a new engine, designated the <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20JT9D">JT9D</a> to power the 747.

The project was designed with a new methodology called <a href="fault%20tree%20analysis">fault tree analysis</a>, which allowed the effects of a failure of a single part to be studied to determine its impact on other systems. To address concerns about safety and flyability, the 747's design included structural redundancy, redundant <a href="Hydraulic%20machinery">hydraulic</a> systems, quadruple main landing gear and dual control surfaces. Additionally, some of the most advanced <a href="high-lift%20device">high-lift device</a>s used in the industry were included in the new design, to allow it to operate from existing airports. These included <a href="leading-edge%20slats">slats</a> running almost the entire length of the wing, as well as complex three-part slotted <a href="Flap%20%28aircraft%29">flaps</a> along the trailing edge of the wing. The wing's complex three-part flaps increase wing area by 21 percent and lift by 90 percent when fully deployed compared to their non-deployed configuration.

Boeing agreed to deliver the first 747 to Pan Am by the end of 1969. The delivery date left 28 months to design the aircraft, which was two-thirds of the normal time. The schedule was so fast-paced that the people who worked on it were given the nickname "The Incredibles". Developing the aircraft was such a technical and financial challenge that management was said to have "bet the company" when it started the project.

As Boeing did not have a plant large enough to assemble the giant airliner, they chose to build a new plant. The company considered locations in about 50 cities, and eventually decided to build the new plant some north of <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> on a site adjoining a military base at <a href="Paine%20Field">Paine Field</a> near <a href="Everett%2C%20Washington">Everett</a>, Washington. It bought the site in June 1966.

Developing the 747 had been a major challenge, and building its assembly plant was also a huge undertaking. Boeing president <a href="William%20M.%20Allen">William M. Allen</a> asked Malcolm T. Stamper, then head of the company's turbine division, to oversee construction of the <a href="Boeing%20Everett%20Factory">Everett factory</a> and to start production of the 747. To level the site, more than of earth had to be moved. Time was so short that the 747's full-scale <a href="mock-up">mock-up</a> was built before the factory roof above it was finished. The plant is the largest building by volume ever built, and has been substantially expanded several times to permit construction of other models of Boeing wide-body commercial jets.

Before the first 747 was fully assembled, testing began on many components and systems. One important test involved the evacuation of 560 volunteers from a cabin mock-up via the aircraft's emergency chutes. The first full-scale evacuation took two and a half minutes instead of the maximum of 90 seconds mandated by the <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA), and several volunteers were injured. Subsequent test evacuations achieved the 90-second goal but caused more injuries. Most problematic was evacuation from the aircraft's upper deck; instead of using a conventional slide, volunteer passengers escaped by using a harness attached to a reel. Tests also involved taxiing such a large aircraft. Boeing built an unusual training device known as "Waddell's Wagon" (named for a 747 test pilot, Jack Waddell) that consisted of a mock-up cockpit mounted on the roof of a truck. While the first 747s were still being built, the device allowed pilots to practice taxi maneuvers from a high upper-deck position.

On September 30, 1968, the first 747 was rolled out of the Everett assembly building before the world's press and representatives of the 26 airlines that had ordered the airliner. Over the following months, preparations were made for the first flight, which took place on February 9, 1969, with test pilots Jack Waddell and <a href="Brien%20Wygle">Brien Wygle</a> at the controls and Jess Wallick at the flight engineer's station. Despite a minor problem with one of the flaps, the flight confirmed that the 747 handled extremely well. The 747 was found to be largely immune to "<a href="Dutch%20roll">Dutch roll</a>", a phenomenon that had been a major hazard to the early swept-wing jets.
During later stages of the flight test program, <a href="Wing%20flutter">flutter</a> testing showed that the wings suffered oscillation under certain conditions. This difficulty was partly solved by reducing the stiffness of some wing components. However, a particularly severe high-speed flutter problem was solved only by inserting <a href="depleted%20uranium">depleted uranium</a> counterweights as ballast in the outboard engine <a href="nacelle">nacelle</a>s of the early 747s. This measure caused anxiety when these aircraft crashed, for example <a href="El%20Al%20Flight%201862">El Al Flight 1862</a> at <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> in 1992 with of uranium in the <a href="tailplane">tailplane</a> (horizontal stabilizer).

The <a href="flight%20test">flight test</a> program was hampered by problems with the 747's JT9D engines. Difficulties included engine stalls caused by rapid throttle movements and distortion of the turbine casings after a short period of service. The problems delayed 747 deliveries for several months; up to 20 aircraft at the Everett plant were stranded while awaiting engine installation. The program was further delayed when one of the five test aircraft suffered serious damage during a landing attempt at <a href="Renton%20Municipal%20Airport">Renton Municipal Airport</a>, site of the company's <a href="Boeing%20Renton%20Factory">Renton factory</a>. On December 13, 1969 a test aircraft was being taken to have test equipment removed and a cabin installed when pilot Ralph C. Cokely undershot the airport's short runway. The 747's right, outer landing gear was torn off and two engine <a href="nacelle">nacelle</a>s were damaged. However, these difficulties did not prevent Boeing from taking a test aircraft to the 28th <a href="Paris%20Air%20Show">Paris Air Show</a> in mid-1969, where it was displayed to the public for the first time. The 747 received its FAA airworthiness certificate in December 1969, clearing it for introduction into service.
The huge cost of developing the 747 and building the Everett factory meant that Boeing had to borrow heavily from a banking syndicate. During the final months before delivery of the first aircraft, the company had to repeatedly request additional funding to complete the project. Had this been refused, Boeing's survival would have been threatened. The firm's debt exceeded $2 billion, with the $1.2 billion owed to the banks setting a record for all companies. Allen later said, "It was really too large a project for us." Ultimately, the gamble succeeded, and Boeing held a monopoly in very large passenger aircraft production for many years.

On January 15, 1970, <a href="First%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States">First Lady of the United States</a> <a href="Pat%20Nixon">Pat Nixon</a> christened Pan Am's first 747, at <a href="Washington%20Dulles%20International%20Airport">Dulles International Airport</a> (later Washington Dulles International Airport) in the presence of Pan Am chairman <a href="Najeeb%20Halaby">Najeeb Halaby</a>. Instead of champagne, red, white, and blue water was sprayed on the aircraft. The 747 entered service on January 22, 1970, on Pan Am's New York–London route; the flight had been planned for the evening of January 21, but engine overheating made the original aircraft unusable. Finding a substitute delayed the flight by more than six hours to the following day when <a href="Clipper%20Victor">Clipper Victor</a> was used.
The 747 enjoyed a fairly smooth introduction into service, overcoming concerns that some airports would not be able to accommodate an aircraft that large. Although technical problems occurred, they were relatively minor and quickly solved. After the aircraft's introduction with Pan Am, other airlines that had bought the 747 to stay competitive began to put their own 747s into service. Boeing estimated that half of the early 747 sales were to airlines desiring the aircraft's long range rather than its payload capacity. While the 747 had the lowest potential operating cost per seat, this could only be achieved when the aircraft was fully loaded; costs per seat increased rapidly as occupancy declined. A moderately loaded 747, one with only 70 percent of its seats occupied, used more than 95 percent of the fuel needed by a fully occupied 747. Nonetheless, many flag-carriers purchased the 747 due to its iconic status "even if it made no sense economically" to operate. During the 1970s and 1980s, there was often over 30 regularly scheduled 747s at <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport">John F. Kennedy International Airport</a>.

The <a href="recession%20of%201969-1970">recession of 1969-1970</a> greatly affected Boeing. For the year and a half after September 1970 it only sold two 747s in the world, and did not sell any to an American carrier for almost three years. When economic problems in the United States and other countries after the <a href="1973%20oil%20crisis">1973 oil crisis</a> led to reduced passenger traffic, several airlines found they did not have enough passengers to fly the 747 economically, and they replaced them with the smaller and recently introduced <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20DC-10">McDonnell Douglas DC-10</a> and <a href="Lockheed%20L-1011">Lockheed L-1011 TriStar</a> <a href="trijet">trijet</a> wide bodies (and later the <a href="Boeing%20767">767</a> and <a href="Airbus%20A300">A300</a>/<a href="Airbus%20A310">A310</a> <a href="twinjet">twinjet</a>s). Having tried replacing coach seats on its 747s with piano bars in an attempt to attract more customers, American Airlines eventually relegated its 747s to cargo service and in 1983 exchanged them with Pan Am for smaller aircraft; <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> also removed its 747s from service after several years. Later, Delta acquired 747s again in 2008 as part of its merger with <a href="Northwest%20Airlines">Northwest Airlines</a>, although it intends to retire them from service by 2018.
International flights that bypassed traditional hub airports and landed at smaller cities became more common throughout the 1980s, and this eroded the 747's original market. However, many international carriers continued to use the 747 on <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a> routes. In Japan, 747s on domestic routes were configured to carry close to the maximum passenger capacity.

After the initial 747-100, Boeing developed the , a higher <a href="maximum%20takeoff%20weight">maximum takeoff weight</a> (MTOW) variant, and the (Short Range), with higher passenger capacity. Increased maximum takeoff weight allows aircraft to carry more fuel and have longer range. The model followed in 1971, featuring more powerful engines and a higher MTOW. Passenger, freighter and combination passenger-freighter versions of the were produced. The shortened <a href="Boeing%20747SP">747SP</a> (special performance) with a longer range was also developed, and entered service in 1976.

The 747 line was further developed with the launch of the 747-300 in 1980. The 300 series resulted from Boeing studies to increase the <a href="seating%20capacity">seating capacity</a> of the 747, during which modifications such as fuselage plugs and extending the upper deck over the entire length of the fuselage were rejected. The first 747-300, completed in 1983, included a stretched upper deck, increased cruise speed, and increased <a href="seating%20capacity">seating capacity</a>. The -300 variant was previously designated 747SUD for stretched upper deck, then 747-200 SUD, followed by 747EUD, before the 747-300 designation was used. Passenger, short range and combination freighter-passenger versions of the 300 series were produced.
In 1985, development of the longer range <a href="Boeing%20747-400">747-400</a> began. The variant had a new <a href="glass%20cockpit">glass cockpit</a>, which allowed for a cockpit crew of two instead of three, new engines, lighter construction materials, and a redesigned interior. Development cost soared, and production delays occurred as new technologies were incorporated at the request of airlines. Insufficient workforce experience and reliance on overtime contributed to early production problems on the 747-400. The -400 entered service in 1989.

In 1991, a record-breaking 1,087 passengers were airlifted aboard a 747 to Israel as part of <a href="Operation%20Solomon">Operation Solomon</a>. The 747 remained the heaviest commercial aircraft in regular service until the debut of the <a href="Antonov%20An-124">Antonov An-124</a> Ruslan in 1982; variants of the 747-400 would surpass the An-124's weight in 2000. The <a href="Antonov%20An-225%20Mriya">Antonov An-225 "Mriya"</a> <a href="cargo%20aircraft">cargo transport</a>, which debuted in 1988, remains the world's largest aircraft by several measures (including the most accepted measures of maximum takeoff weight and length); one aircraft has been completed and is in service . The <a href="Hughes%20H-4%20Hercules">Hughes H-4 Hercules</a> is the largest aircraft by <a href="wingspan">wingspan</a>, but it only completed a single flight.

Since the arrival of the 747-400, several stretching schemes for the 747 have been proposed. Boeing announced the larger 747-500X and preliminary designs in 1996. The new variants would have cost more than US$5 billion to develop, and interest was not sufficient to launch the program. In 2000, Boeing offered the more modest 747X and 747X stretch derivatives as alternatives to the Airbus <a href="Airbus%20A380">A3XX</a>. However, the 747X family was unable to attract enough interest to enter production. A year later, Boeing switched from the 747X studies to pursue the <a href="Boeing%20Sonic%20Cruiser">Sonic Cruiser</a>, and after the Sonic Cruiser program was put on hold, the <a href="Boeing%20787%20Dreamliner">787 Dreamliner</a>. Some of the ideas developed for the 747X were used on the <a href="Boeing%20747-400ER">747-400ER</a>, a longer range variant of the 747-400.

After several variants were proposed but later abandoned, some industry observers became skeptical of new aircraft proposals from Boeing. However, in early 2004, Boeing announced tentative plans for the 747 Advanced that were eventually adopted. Similar in nature to the 747-X, the stretched 747 Advanced used technology from the 787 to modernize the design and its systems. The 747 remained the largest passenger airliner in service until the <a href="Airbus%20A380">Airbus A380</a> began airline service in 2007.

On November 14, 2005, Boeing announced it was launching the 747 Advanced as the <a href="Boeing%20747-8">Boeing 747-8</a>. The last 747-400s were completed in 2009. , most orders of the 747-8 have been for the freighter variant. On February 8, 2010, the 747-8 Freighter made its <a href="maiden%20flight">maiden flight</a>. The first delivery of the 747-8 went to <a href="Cargolux">Cargolux</a> in 2011. The 1,500th produced Boeing 747 was delivered in June 2014.

In January 2016, Boeing stated it was reducing 747-8 production to six a year beginning in September 2016, incurring a $569 million post-tax charge against its fourth-quarter 2015 profits. At the end of 2015, the company had 20 orders outstanding. On January 29, 2016, Boeing announced that it had begun the preliminary work on the modifications to a commercial 747-8 for the next <a href="Air%20Force%20One">Air Force One</a> Presidential aircraft, expected to be operational by 2020.

On July 12, 2016, Boeing announced that it had finalized terms of acquisition with <a href="Volga-Dnepr%20Group">Volga-Dnepr Group</a> for 20 747-8 freighters, valued at $7.58 billion at list prices. Four aircraft were delivered beginning in 2012. Volga-Dnepr Group is the parent of three major Russian air-freight carriers – <a href="Volga-Dnepr%20Airlines">Volga-Dnepr Airlines</a>, <a href="AirBridgeCargo%20Airlines">AirBridgeCargo Airlines</a> and <a href="Atran%20Airlines">Atran Airlines</a>. The new 747-8 freighters will replace AirBridgeCargo's current 747-400 aircraft and expand the airline's fleet and will be acquired through a mix of direct purchases and leasing over the next six years, Boeing said.

On July 27, 2016, in its quarterly report to the <a href="Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, Boeing discussed the potential termination of 747 production due to insufficient demand and market for the aircraft. With a firm order backlog of 21 aircraft and a production rate of six per year, program accounting has been reduced to 1,555 aircraft, and the 747 line could be closed in the third quarter of 2019. In October 2016, <a href="UPS%20Airlines">UPS Airlines</a> ordered 14 -8Fs to add capacity, along with 14 options, which doubles its official backlog of 15 – including some to refractory airlines – and could extend production by two more years.

The Boeing 747 is a large, wide-body (two-aisle) airliner with four wing-mounted engines. The wings have a high <a href="swept%20wing">sweep</a> angle of 37.5 degrees for a fast, efficient cruise of Mach 0.84 to 0.88, depending on the variant. The sweep also reduces the wingspan, allowing the 747 to use existing <a href="hangar">hangar</a>s. Seating capacity is more than 366 with a 3–4–3 seat arrangement (a cross section of 3 seats, an aisle, 4 seats, another aisle, and 3 seats) in economy class and a 2–3–2 arrangement in first class on the main deck. The upper deck has a 3–3 seat arrangement in economy class and a 2–2 arrangement in first class.
Raised above the main deck, the cockpit creates a hump. The raised cockpit allows front loading of cargo on freight variants. The upper deck behind the cockpit provides space for a lounge or extra seating. The "stretched upper deck" became available as an option on the 747-100B variant and later as standard beginning on the 747-300. The upper deck was stretched more on the 747-8. The 747 cockpit roof section also has an escape hatch from which crew can exit in the event of an emergency if they cannot exit through the cabin.

The 747's maximum takeoff weight ranges from 735,000 pounds (333,400 kg) for the -100 to 970,000 lb (439,985 kg) for the -8. Its range has increased from 5,300 nautical miles (6,100 mi, 9,800 km) on the -100 to 8,000 nmi (9,200 mi, 14,815 km) on the -8I.

The 747 has redundant structures along with four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears with four wheels each, which provide a good spread of support on the ground and safety in case of tire blow-outs. The main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on two opposing landing gears if the others do not function properly. In addition, the 747 has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated triple-slotted <a href="Flap%20%28aircraft%29">flaps</a> that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard-length runways. For transportation of spare engines, 747s can accommodate a non-functioning fifth-pod engine under the port wing of the aircraft between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage.

The 747-100 was the original variant launched in 1966. The 747-200 soon followed, with its launch in 1968. The 747-300 was launched in 1980 and was followed by the 747-400 in 1985. Ultimately, the 747-8 was announced in 2005. Several versions of each variant have been produced, and many of the early variants were in production simultaneously. The <a href="International%20Civil%20Aviation%20Organization">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO) classifies variants using a shortened code formed by combining the model number and the variant designator (e.g. "B741" for all -100 models).

The first 747-100s were built with six upper deck windows (three per side) to accommodate upstairs lounge areas. Later, as airlines began to use the upper deck for premium passenger seating instead of lounge space, Boeing offered a ten-window upper deck as an option. Some early -100s were retrofitted with the new configuration. The -100 was equipped with <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20JT9D">Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3A</a> engines. No freighter version of this model was developed, but many 747-100s were converted into freighters. A total of 167 747-100s were built.

Responding to requests from Japanese airlines for a high-capacity aircraft to serve domestic routes between major cities, Boeing developed the 747SR as a short-range version of the 747-100 with lower fuel capacity and greater payload capability. With increased economy class seating, up to 498 passengers could be carried in early versions and up to 550 in later models. The 747SR had an economic design life objective of 52,000 flights during 20 years of operation, compared to 24,600 flights in 20 years for the standard 747. The initial 747SR model, the -100SR, had a strengthened body structure and landing gear to accommodate the added stress accumulated from a greater number of takeoffs and landings. Extra structural support was built into the wings, fuselage, and the landing gear along with a 20 percent reduction in fuel capacity.
The initial order for the -100SR – four aircraft for Japan Air Lines (JAL, later <a href="Japan%20Airlines">Japan Airlines</a>) – was announced on October 30, 1972; rollout occurred on August 3, 1973, and the first flight took place on August 31, 1973. The type was certified by the FAA on September 26, 1973, with the first delivery on the same day. The -100SR entered service with JAL, the type's sole customer, on October 7, 1973, and typically operated flights within Japan. Seven -100SRs were built between 1973 and 1975, each with a MTOW and <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20JT9D">Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7A</a> engines derated to of thrust.

Following the -100SR, Boeing produced the -100BSR, a 747SR variant with increased takeoff weight capability. Debuting in 1978, the -100BSR also incorporated structural modifications for a high cycle-to-flying hour ratio; a related standard -100B model debuted in 1979. The -100BSR first flew on November 3, 1978, with first delivery to <a href="All%20Nippon%20Airways">All Nippon Airways</a> (ANA) on December 21, 1978. A total of twenty -100BSRs were produced for ANA and JAL. The -100BSR had a 600,000 lb MTOW and was powered by the same JT9D-7A or General Electric CF6-45 engines used on the -100SR. ANA operated this variant on domestic Japanese routes with 455 or 456 seats until retiring its last aircraft in March 2006.

In 1986, two -100BSR SUD models, featuring the stretched upper deck (SUD) of the -300, were produced for JAL. The type's maiden flight occurred on February 26, 1986, with FAA certification and first delivery on March 24, 1986. JAL operated the -100BSR SUD with 563 seats on domestic routes until their retirement in the third quarter of 2006. While only two -100BSR SUDs were produced, in theory, standard -100Bs can be modified to the SUD certification. Overall, twenty-nine 747SRs were built, consisting of seven -100SRs, twenty -100BSRs, and two -100BSR SUDs.

The 747-100B model was developed from the -100SR, using its stronger airframe and landing gear design. The type had an increased fuel capacity of , allowing for a range with a typical 452-passenger payload, and an increased MTOW of was offered. The first -100B order, one aircraft for Iran Air, was announced on June 1, 1978. This aircraft first flew on June 20, 1979, received FAA certification on August 1, 1979, and was delivered the next day. Nine -100Bs were built, one for <a href="Iran%20Air">Iran Air</a> and eight for <a href="Saudia">Saudi Arabian Airlines</a>. Unlike the original -100, the -100B was offered with Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7A, <a href="General%20Electric%20CF6">General Electric CF6-50</a>, or <a href="Rolls-Royce%20RB211%23RB211-524%20series">Rolls-Royce RB211-524</a> engines. However, only RB211-524 (Saudia) and JT9D-7A (Iran Air) engines were ordered. The last 747-100B, EP-IAM was retired by Iran Air in 2014, the last commercial operator of the 747-100 and -100B.

The development of the 747SP stemmed from a joint request between Pan American World Airways and <a href="Iran%20Air">Iran Air</a>, who were looking for a high-capacity airliner with enough range to cover Pan Am's New York–Middle Eastern routes and Iran Air's planned Tehran–New York route. The Tehran–New York route, when launched, was the longest <a href="Non-stop%20flight">non-stop</a> commercial flight in the world. The 747SP is shorter than the 747-100. Fuselage sections were eliminated fore and aft of the wing, and the center section of the fuselage was redesigned to fit mating fuselage sections. The SP's flaps used a simplified single-slotted configuration. The 747SP, compared to earlier variants, had a tapering of the aft upper fuselage into the <a href="empennage">empennage</a>, a double-hinged rudder, and longer vertical and horizontal stabilizers. Power was provided by Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7(A/F/J/FW) or Rolls-Royce RB211-524 engines.

The 747SP was granted a supplemental certificate on February 4, 1976 and entered service with launch customers Pan Am and Iran Air that same year. The aircraft was chosen by airlines wishing to serve major airports with short runways. A total of 45 747SPs were built, with the 44th 747SP delivered on August 30, 1982. In 1987, Boeing re-opened the 747SP production line after five years to build one last 747SP for an order by the United Arab Emirates government. In addition to airline use, one 747SP was modified for the <a href="NASA">NASA</a>/<a href="German%20Aerospace%20Center">German Aerospace Center</a> <a href="Stratospheric%20Observatory%20for%20Infrared%20Astronomy">SOFIA</a> experiment. Iran Air is the last civil operator of the type; its final 747-SP (EP-IAC) was to be retired in June 2016.

While the 747-100 powered by Pratt & Whitney JT9D-3A engines offered enough payload and range for US domestic operations, it was marginal for long international route sectors. The demand for longer range aircraft with increased payload quickly led to the improved -200, which featured more powerful engines, increased MTOW, and greater range than the -100. A few early -200s retained the three-window configuration of the -100 on the upper deck, but most were built with a ten-window configuration on each side. The 747-200 was produced in passenger (-200B), freighter (-200F), convertible (-200C), and combi (-200M) versions.

The 747-200B was the basic passenger version, with increased fuel capacity and more powerful engines; it entered service in February 1971. In its first three years of production, the -200 was equipped with <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20JT9D">Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7</a> engines (initially the only engine available). Range with a full passenger load started at over and increased to with later engines. Most -200Bs had an internally stretched upper deck, allowing for up to 16 passenger seats. The freighter model, the 747-200F, could be fitted with or without a side cargo door, and had a capacity of 105 tons (95.3 tonnes) and an MTOW of up to 833,000 lb (378,000 kg). It entered service in 1972 with Lufthansa. The convertible version, the 747-200C, could be converted between a passenger and a freighter or used in mixed configurations, and featured removable seats and a nose cargo door. The -200C could also be fitted with an optional side cargo door on the main deck.
The combi model, the 747-200M, could carry freight in the rear section of the main deck via a side cargo door. A removable partition on the main deck separated the cargo area at the rear from the passengers at the front. The -200M could carry up to 238 passengers in a three-class configuration with cargo carried on the main deck. The model was also known as the 747-200 Combi. As on the -100, a stretched upper deck (SUD) modification was later offered. A total of 10 converted 747-200s were operated by KLM. <a href="Union%20des%20Transports%20A%C3%A9riens">Union des Transports Aériens</a> (UTA) also had two aircraft converted.

After launching the -200 with Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7 engines, on August 1, 1972 Boeing announced that it had reached an agreement with General Electric to certify the 747 with CF6-50 series engines to increase the aircraft's market potential. Rolls-Royce followed 747 engine production with a launch order from <a href="British%20Airways">British Airways</a> for four aircraft. The option of RB211-524B engines was announced on June 17, 1975. The -200 was the first 747 to provide a choice of powerplant from the three major engine manufacturers.

A total of 393 of the 747-200 versions had been built when production ended in 1991. Of these, 225 were -200B, 73 were -200F, 13 were -200C, 78 were -200M, and 4 were military. Many 747-200s remained in operation, although most large carriers have retired them from their fleets and sold them to smaller operators as of early 2000s. Large carriers have sped up fleet retirement following the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> and the subsequent drop in demand for air travel, scrapping some or turning others into freighters. <a href="Iran%20Air">Iran Air</a> retired the last passenger 747-200 in May 2016, 36 years after it was delivered.

The 747-300 features a upper deck than the -200. The stretched upper deck has two emergency exit doors and is the most visible difference between the -300 and previous models. Before being made standard on the 747-300, the stretched upper deck was previously offered as a retrofit, and appeared on two Japanese 747-100SR aircraft. The 747-300 introduced a new straight stairway to the upper deck, instead of a spiral staircase on earlier variants, which creates room above and below for more seats. Minor aerodynamic changes allowed the -300's cruise speed to reach Mach 0.85 compared with Mach 0.84 on the -200 and -100 models, while retaining the same takeoff weight. The -300 could be equipped with the same Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce powerplants as on the -200, as well as updated <a href="General%20Electric%20CF6">General Electric CF6-80C2B1</a> engines.

Swissair placed the first order for the 747-300 on June 11, 1980. The variant revived the 747-300 designation, which had been previously used on a design study that did not reach production. The 747-300 first flew on October 5, 1982, and the type's first delivery went to Swissair on March 23, 1983. Besides the passenger model, two other versions (-300M, -300SR) were produced. The 747-300M features cargo capacity on the rear portion of the main deck, similar to the -200M, but with the stretched upper deck it can carry more passengers. The 747-300SR, a short range, high-capacity domestic model, was produced for Japanese markets with a maximum seating for 584. No production freighter version of the 747-300 was built, but Boeing began modifications of used passenger -300 models into freighters in 2000.

A total of 81 747-300 series aircraft were delivered, 56 for passenger use, 21 -300M and 4 -300SR versions. In 1985, just two years after the -300 entered service, the type was superseded by the announcement of the more advanced 747-400. The last 747-300 was delivered in September 1990 to <a href="Sabena">Sabena</a>. While some -300 customers continued operating the type, several large carriers replaced their 747-300s with 747-400s. <a href="Air%20France">Air France</a>, <a href="Air%20India">Air India</a>, <a href="Pakistan%20International%20Airlines">Pakistan International Airlines</a>, and <a href="Qantas">Qantas</a> were some of the last major carriers to operate the 747-300. On December 29, 2008, Qantas flew its last scheduled 747-300 service, operating from Melbourne to Los Angeles via Auckland. In July 2015, <a href="Pakistan%20International%20Airlines">Pakistan International Airlines</a> retired their final 747-300 after 30 years of service.As of July 2017, only five 747-300's remain in commercial service, with <a href="Max%20Air">Max Air</a> (3), <a href="Mahan%20Air">Mahan Air</a> (1) and <a href="TransAVIAexport%20Airlines">TransAVIAexport Airlines</a> (1).

The 747-400 is an improved model with increased range. It has wingtip extensions of and <a href="Wingtip%20device">winglets</a> of , which improve the type's fuel efficiency by four percent compared to previous 747 versions. The 747-400 introduced a new glass cockpit designed for a flight crew of two instead of three, with a reduction in the number of dials, gauges and knobs from 971 to 365 through the use of electronics. The type also features tail fuel tanks, revised engines, and a new interior. The longer range has been used by some airlines to bypass traditional fuel stops, such as <a href="Ted%20Stevens%20Anchorage%20International%20Airport">Anchorage</a>. Powerplants include the <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20PW4000">Pratt & Whitney PW4062</a>, <a href="General%20Electric%20CF6">General Electric CF6-80C2</a>, and <a href="Rolls-Royce%20RB211">Rolls-Royce RB211-524</a>.

The was offered in passenger (-400), freighter (-400F), combi (-400M), domestic (-400D), extended range passenger (-400ER), and extended range freighter (-400ERF) versions. Passenger versions retain the same upper deck as the , while the freighter version does not have an extended upper deck. The 747-400D was built for short-range operations with maximum seating for 624. Winglets were not included, but they can be retrofitted. Cruising speed is up to Mach 0.855 on different versions of the 747-400.
The passenger version first entered service in February 1989 with launch customer <a href="Northwest%20Airlines">Northwest Airlines</a> on the Minneapolis to Phoenix route. The combi version entered service in September 1989 with <a href="KLM">KLM</a>, while the freighter version entered service in November 1993 with <a href="Cargolux">Cargolux</a>. The 747-400ERF entered service with Air France in October 2002, while the 747-400ER entered service with Qantas, its sole customer, in November 2002. In January 2004, Boeing and <a href="Cathay%20Pacific">Cathay Pacific</a> launched the Boeing 747-400 Special Freighter program, later referred to as the Boeing Converted Freighter (BCF), to modify passenger 747-400s for cargo use. The first 747-400BCF was redelivered in December 2005.

In March 2007, Boeing announced that it had no plans to produce further passenger versions of the -400. However, orders for 36 -400F and -400ERF freighters were already in place at the time of the announcement. The last passenger version of the 747-400 was delivered in April 2005 to China Airlines. Some of the last built 747-400s were delivered with Dreamliner livery along with the modern Signature interior from the Boeing 777. A total of 694 of the 747-400 series aircraft were delivered. At various times, the largest 747-400 operator has included <a href="Singapore%20Airlines">Singapore Airlines</a>, <a href="Japan%20Airlines">Japan Airlines</a>, and <a href="British%20Airways">British Airways</a> with 31 .

The 747-400 Dreamlifter (originally called the 747 Large Cargo Freighter or LCF) is a Boeing-designed modification of existing 747-400s to a larger configuration to ferry 787 Dreamliner sub-assemblies. <a href="Evergreen%20Group">Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corporation</a> of <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> was contracted to complete modifications of 747-400s into Dreamlifters in Taoyuan. The aircraft flew for the first time on September 9, 2006 in a test flight. Modification of four aircraft was completed by February 2010. The Dreamlifters have been placed into service transporting sub-assemblies for the 787 program to the Boeing plant in Everett, Washington, for final assembly. The aircraft is certified to carry only essential crew and not passengers.

Boeing announced a new 747 variant, the 747-8, on November 14, 2005. Referred to as the 747 Advanced prior to its launch, the 747-8 uses the same engine and cockpit technology as the 787, hence the use of the "8". The variant is designed to be quieter, more economical, and more environmentally friendly. The 747-8's fuselage is lengthened from 232 to 251 feet (70.8 to 76.4 m), marking the first stretch variant of the aircraft. Power is supplied by <a href="General%20Electric%20GEnx">General Electric GEnx-2B67</a> engines.
The 747-8 Freighter, or 747-8F, is derived from the 747-400ERF. The variant has 16 percent more payload capacity than its predecessor, allowing it to carry seven more standard air cargo containers, with a maximum payload capacity of 154 tons (140 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s) of cargo. As on previous 747 freighters, the 747-8F features an overhead nose-door and a side-door on the main deck plus a side-door on the lower deck ("belly") to aid loading and unloading. The 747-8F made its maiden flight on February 8, 2010. The variant received its amended <a href="type%20certificate">type certificate</a> jointly from the FAA and the <a href="European%20Aviation%20Safety%20Agency">European Aviation Safety Agency</a> (EASA) on August 19, 2011. The -8F was first delivered to Cargolux on October 12, 2011.

The passenger version, named 747-8 Intercontinental or 747-8I, is designed to carry up to 467 passengers in a 3-class configuration and fly more than at Mach 0.855. As a derivative of the already common 747-400, the 747-8 has the economic benefit of similar training and interchangeable parts. The type's first test flight occurred on March 20, 2011. The 747-8 has surpassed the <a href="Airbus%20A340">Airbus A340-600</a> as the world's longest airliner. The first -8I was delivered in May 2012 to Lufthansa. The 747-8 has received 135 total orders, including 88 for the -8F and 47 for the -8I .


Boeing has studied a number of 747 variants that have not gone beyond the concept stage.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Boeing studied the development of a shorter 747 with <a href="trijet">three engines</a>, to compete with the smaller <a href="Lockheed%20L-1011%20TriStar">L-1011 TriStar</a> and <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20DC-10">DC-10</a>. The 747 trijet would have had more payload, range, and passenger capacity than the L-1011 and DC-10. The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an <a href="S-duct">S-duct</a> intake similar to the L-1011's. However, engineering studies showed that a total redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary. Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining. Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four-engine 747, resulting in the 747SP.

Boeing announced the 747 ASB ("Advanced Short Body") in 1986 as a response to the <a href="Airbus%20A340">Airbus A340</a> and the <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20MD-11">McDonnell Douglas MD-11</a>. This aircraft design would have combined the advanced technology used on the <a href="Boeing%20747-400">747-400</a> with the foreshortened 747SP fuselage. The aircraft was to carry 295 passengers a range of . However, airlines were not interested in the project and it was canceled in 1988 in favor of the <a href="Boeing%20777">777</a>.

Boeing announced the 747-500X and -600X at the 1996 <a href="Farnborough%20Airshow">Farnborough Airshow</a>. The proposed models would have combined the 747's <a href="fuselage">fuselage</a> with a new 251 ft (77 m) span wing derived from the 777. Other changes included adding more powerful engines and increasing the number of tires from two to four on the nose landing gear and from 16 to 20 on the main landing gear.

The 747-500X concept featured an increased fuselage length of 18 ft (5.5 m) to 250 ft (76.2 m) long, and the aircraft was to carry 462 passengers over a range up to 8,700 nautical miles (10,000 mi, 16,100 km), with a gross weight of over 1.0 <a href="Mega-">Mlb</a> (450 tonnes). The 747-600X concept featured a greater stretch to 279 ft (85 m) with seating for 548 passengers, a range of up to 7,700 nmi (8,900 mi, 14,300 km), and a gross weight of 1.2 Mlb (540 tonnes). A third study concept, the 747-700X, would have combined the wing of the 747-600X with a widened fuselage, allowing it to carry 650 passengers over the same range as a 747-400. The cost of the changes from previous 747 models, in particular the new wing for the 747-500X and -600X, was estimated to be more than US$5 billion. Boeing was not able to attract enough interest to launch the aircraft.

As Airbus progressed with its <a href="Airbus%20A380">A3XX</a> study, Boeing offered a 747 derivative as an alternative in 2000; a more modest proposal than the previous -500X and -600X that retained the 747's overall wing design and add a segment at the root, increasing the span to . Power would have been supplied by either the <a href="Engine%20Alliance%20GP7000">Engine Alliance GP7172</a> or the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Trent%23Trent%20600%20%E2%80%93%20First%20proposal">Rolls-Royce Trent 600</a>, which were also proposed for the <a href="Boeing%20767%23767-400ERX">767-400ERX</a>. A new flight deck based on the 777's would be used. The 747X aircraft was to carry 430 passengers over ranges of up to 8,700 nmi (10,000 mi, 16,100 km). The 747X Stretch would be extended to long, allowing it to carry 500 passengers over ranges of up to 7,800 nmi (9,000 mi, 14,500 km). Both would feature an interior based on the 777. Freighter versions of the 747X and 747X Stretch were also studied.

Like its predecessor, the 747X family was unable to garner enough interest to justify production, and it was shelved along with the 767-400ERX in March 2001, when Boeing announced the <a href="Boeing%20Sonic%20Cruiser">Sonic Cruiser</a> concept. Though the 747X design was less costly than the 747-500X and -600X, it was criticized for not offering a sufficient advance from the existing 747-400. The 747X did not make it beyond the drawing board, but the 747-400X being developed concurrently moved into production to become the <a href="Boeing%20747-400ER">747-400ER</a>.

After the end of the 747X program, Boeing continued to study improvements that could be made to the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long Range) was meant to have an increased range of 7,980 nmi (9,200 mi, 14,800 km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise. Improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400ER and a sawtooth engine nacelle for noise reduction. Although the 747-400XQLR did not move to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced, which has now been launched as the <a href="Boeing%20747-8">747-8</a>.



The 747 has been involved in 146 <a href="aviation%20accidents%20and%20incidents">aviation accidents and incidents</a>, including 61 accidents and <a href="hull%20loss">hull loss</a>es which resulted in 3722 fatalities. The last crash was <a href="Turkish%20Airlines%20Flight%206491">Turkish Airlines Flight 6491</a> in January 2017. There was also 24 deaths in 32 <a href="aircraft%20hijacking">aircraft hijacking</a>s, such as <a href="Pan%20Am%20Flight%2073">Pan Am Flight 73</a> where a Boeing 747-121 was hijacked by four terrorists and resulted in 20 deaths.

Few crashes have been attributed to design flaws of the 747. The <a href="Tenerife%20airport%20disaster">Tenerife airport disaster</a> resulted from pilot error and communications failure, while the <a href="Japan%20Airlines%20Flight%20123">Japan Airlines Flight 123</a> and <a href="China%20Airlines%20Flight%20611">China Airlines Flight 611</a> crashes stemmed from improper aircraft repair. <a href="United%20Airlines%20Flight%20811">United Airlines Flight 811</a>, which suffered an <a href="uncontrolled%20decompression">explosive decompression</a> mid-flight on February 24, 1989, led the <a href="National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a> (NTSB) to issue a recommendation that 747-200 cargo doors similar to those on the Flight 811 aircraft be modified. <a href="Korean%20Air%20Lines%20Flight%20007">Korean Air Lines Flight 007</a> was shot down by a Soviet fighter aircraft in 1983 after it had strayed into Soviet territory, causing U.S. President Ronald Reagan to authorize the then-strictly military <a href="global%20positioning%20system">global positioning system</a> (GPS) for civilian use.

Accidents due to design deficiencies included <a href="TWA%20Flight%20800">TWA Flight 800</a>, where a 747-100 exploded in mid-air on July 17, 1996, probably due to sparking electricity wires inside the fuel tank; this finding led the FAA to propose a rule requiring installation of an <a href="inerting%20system">inerting system</a> in the center fuel tank of most large aircraft that was adopted in July 2008, after years of research into solutions. At the time, the new safety system was expected to cost US$100,000 to $450,000 per aircraft and weigh approximately . <a href="El%20Al%20Flight%201862">El Al Flight 1862</a> crashed after the fuse pins for an engine broke off shortly after take-off due to metal fatigue. Instead of dropping away from the wing, the engine knocked off the adjacent engine and damaged the wing.

As increasing numbers of "classic" 747-100 and 747-200 series aircraft have been retired, some have found their way into museums or other uses. The "City of Everett", the first 747 and prototype, is at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Flight">Museum of Flight</a>, <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, USA where it is sometimes leased to Boeing for test purposes.

In recent years, some older 747-300s and 747-400s have also found their way into museums as well. In April 2016, the first production 747-400 was moved to the <a href="Delta%20Flight%20Museum">Delta Flight Museum</a> in Atlanta, Georgia. 

Upon its retirement from service, the 747 number two in the production line was dismantled and shipped to Hopyeong, <a href="Namyangju">Namyangju</a>, <a href="Gyeonggi-do">Gyeonggi-do</a>, South Korea where it was re-assembled, repainted in a livery similar to that of <a href="Air%20Force%20One">Air Force One</a> and converted into a restaurant. Originally flown commercially by Pan Am as N747PA, "Clipper Juan T.

Battle of Agincourt

The Battle of Agincourt (; in French, Azincourt ) was a battle of the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a> that resulted in a English victory. The battle took place on 25 October 1415 (<a href="Saint%20Crispin%27s%20Day">Saint Crispin's Day</a>) in the <a href="County%20of%20Saint-Pol">County of Saint-Pol</a>, <a href="Artois">Artois</a>, some 40 km south of <a href="Calais">Calais</a> (now <a href="Azincourt">Azincourt</a> in northern <a href="France">France</a>).
<a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a>'s victory at Agincourt against a numerically superior French army crippled <a href="Kingdom%20of%20France">France</a>, and started a new period in the war during which the English king married the French princess <a href="Catherine%20of%20Valois">Catherine of Valois</a> and <a href="Treaty%20of%20Troyes">was made heir to the throne of France</a>.

King <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">Henry V of England</a> led his troops into battle and participated in <a href="Hand-to-hand%20combat">hand-to-hand fighting</a>. The <a href="List%20of%20French%20monarchs">French king</a> of the time, <a href="Charles%20VI%20of%20France">Charles VI</a>, did not command the French army himself, as he suffered from severe psychotic illnesses with moderate mental incapacitation. Instead, the French were commanded by <a href="Constable%20of%20France">Constable</a> <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20Albret">Charles d'Albret</a> and various prominent French noblemen of the <a href="Armagnac%20%28party%29">Armagnac party</a>.

This battle is notable for the use of the <a href="English%20longbow">English longbow</a> in very large numbers, with the English and Welsh archers forming up to 80 percent of Henry's army. The battle is the centrepiece of the play "<a href="Henry%20V%20%28play%29">Henry V</a>" by <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>.

The Battle of Agincourt is well documented by at least seven contemporary accounts, three of them eyewitnesses. The approximate location of the battle has never been in dispute and the place remains relatively unaltered even after 600 years. Immediately after the battle, Henry summoned the <a href="herald">herald</a>s of the two armies who had watched the battle together, and with the principal French herald, Montjoie, settled on the name of the battle as Azincourt, after the nearest fortified place. Two of the most frequently cited accounts come from Burgundian sources: one from <a href="Jean%20Le%20F%C3%A8vre%20de%20Saint-Remy">Jean Le Fèvre de Saint-Remy</a>, who was present at the battle, and the other from <a href="Enguerrand%20de%20Monstrelet">Enguerrand de Monstrelet</a>. The English eyewitness account comes from the anonymous "Gesta Henrici Quinti", believed to have been written by a chaplain in the King's household, who would have been in the baggage train at the battle. A recent reappraisal of Henry's strategy of the Agincourt campaign incorporates these three accounts, and argues that war was seen as a legal due process for solving the disagreement over claims to the French throne.

<a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">Henry V</a> invaded France following the failure of negotiations with the French. He claimed the title of King of France through his great-grandfather <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III</a>, although in practice the English kings were generally prepared to renounce this claim if the French would acknowledge the English claim on <a href="Aquitaine">Aquitaine</a> and other French lands (the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Br%C3%A9tigny">Treaty of Brétigny</a>). He initially called a <a href="Magnum%20Concilium">Great Council</a> in the spring of 1414 to discuss going to war with France, but the lords insisted that he should negotiate further and moderate his claims. In the following negotiations Henry said that he would give up his claim to the French throne if the French would pay the 1.6 million crowns outstanding from the ransom of <a href="John%20II%20of%20France">John II</a> (who had been captured at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Poitiers%20%281356%29">Battle of Poitiers</a> in 1356), and concede English ownership of the lands of <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, <a href="Touraine">Touraine</a>, <a href="Anjou">Anjou</a>, <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brittany">Brittany</a> and <a href="County%20of%20Flanders">Flanders</a>, as well as <a href="Duchy%20of%20Aquitaine">Aquitaine</a>. Henry would marry <a href="Catherine%20of%20Valois">Catherine</a>, the young daughter of <a href="Charles%20VI%20of%20France">Charles VI</a>, and receive a dowry of 2 million crowns. The French responded with what they considered the generous terms of marriage with Catherine, a dowry of 600,000 crowns, and an enlarged Aquitaine. By 1415, negotiations had ground to a halt, with the English claiming that the French had mocked their claims and ridiculed Henry himself. In December 1414, the English <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">parliament</a> was persuaded to grant Henry a "double subsidy", a tax at twice the traditional rate, to recover his inheritance from the French. On 19 April 1415, Henry again asked the Great Council to sanction war with France, and this time they agreed.

Henry's army landed in northern France on 13 August 1415, carried by a fleet described by Shakespeare as "a city on the inconstant billows dancing / For so appears this fleet majestical", often reported to comprise 1,500 ships, but probably far smaller, and besieged the port of <a href="Harfleur">Harfleur</a> with an army of about 12,000, and up to 20,000 horses. The <a href="siege%20of%20Harfleur">siege</a> took longer than expected. The town surrendered on 22 September, and the English army did not leave until 8 October. The campaign season was coming to an end, and the English army had suffered many casualties through disease. Rather than retire directly to England for the winter, with his costly expedition resulting in the capture of only one town, Henry decided to march most of his army (roughly 9,000) through <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> to the port of <a href="Calais">Calais</a>, the English stronghold in northern France, to demonstrate by his presence in the territory at the head of an army that his right to rule in the duchy was more than a mere abstract legal and historical claim. He also intended the manoeuvre as a deliberate provocation to battle aimed at <a href="Louis%2C%20Dauphin%20of%20France%2C%20Duke%20of%20Guyenne">the dauphin</a>, who had failed to respond to Henry's personal challenge to combat at Harfleur.

The French had raised an army during the siege which assembled around <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>. This was not strictly a <a href="feudal">feudal</a> army, but an army paid through a system similar to the English. The French hoped to raise 9,000 troops, but the army was not ready in time to relieve Harfleur. After Henry V marched to the north, the French moved to block them along the <a href="Somme%20river">River Somme</a>. They were successful for a time, forcing Henry to move south, away from Calais, to find a <a href="Ford%20%28crossing%29">ford</a>. The English finally crossed the Somme south of <a href="P%C3%A9ronne%2C%20Somme">Péronne</a>, at <a href="B%C3%A9thencourt-sur-Somme">Béthencourt</a> and <a href="Voyennes">Voyennes</a> and resumed marching north. Without a river obstacle to defend, the French were hesitant to force a battle. They shadowed Henry's army while calling a "semonce des nobles", calling on local nobles to join the army. By 24 October, both armies faced each other for battle, but the French declined, hoping for the arrival of more troops. The two armies spent the night of 24 October on open ground. The next day the French initiated negotiations as a delaying tactic, but Henry ordered his army to advance and to start a battle that, given the state of his army, he would have preferred to avoid, or to fight defensively: that was how <a href="Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy">Crécy</a> and the other famous longbow victories had been won. The English had very little food, had marched in two and a half weeks, were suffering from sickness such as <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>, and faced much larger numbers of well equipped French men at arms. The French army blocked Henry's way to the safety of Calais, however, and delaying battle would only further weaken his tired army and allow more French troops to arrive.

The location of the battle is not precisely fixed in contemporary accounts. Most authors believe it was fought in the narrow strip of open land formed between the woods of <a href="Tramecourt">Tramecourt</a> and Azincourt (close to the modern village of <a href="Azincourt">Azincourt</a>). However, the lack of archaeological evidence at this traditional site has led to suggestions it may have been fought to the west of Azincourt.

Early on the 25th, Henry deployed his army (approximately 1,500 <a href="man-at-arms">men-at-arms</a> and 7,000 <a href="English%20longbow">longbowmen</a>) across a part of the <a href="defile%20%28geography%29">defile</a>. The army was organised into three "battles" or divisions: the <a href="Vanguard%20%28military%20formation%29">vanguard</a>, led by the <a href="Edward%20of%20Norwich%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20York">Duke of York</a>; the main battle led by Henry himself; and the <a href="Rear%20guard">rearguard</a>, led by <a href="Thomas%20de%20Camoys%2C%201st%20Baron%20Camoys">Lord Camoys</a>. In addition, <a href="Thomas%20Erpingham">Sir Thomas Erpingham</a>, one of Henry's most experienced household knights, had a role in marshalling the archers. It is likely that the English adopted their usual battle line of longbowmen on either flank, with men-at-arms and knights in the centre. They may also have deployed some archers in the centre of the line. The English men-at-arms in plate and mail were placed shoulder to shoulder four deep. The English and Welsh archers on the flanks drove pointed wooden <a href="archer%27s%20stake">stakes</a>, or palings, into the ground at an angle to force <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> to veer off. This use of stakes may have been inspired by the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nicopolis">Battle of Nicopolis</a> of 1396, where forces of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> used the tactic against French cavalry.

The English made their confessions before the battle, as was customary. Henry, worried about the enemy launching surprise raids, and wanting his troops to remain focused, ordered all his men to spend the night before the battle in silence, on pain of having an ear cut off. He told his men that he would rather die in the coming battle than be captured and ransomed.

Henry made a speech emphasising the justness of his cause, and reminding his army of previous great defeats the kings of England had inflicted on the French. The <a href="Duchy%20of%20Burgundy">Burgundian</a> sources have him concluding the speech by telling his men that the French had boasted that they would cut off two fingers from the right hand of every archer, so that he could never draw a longbow again. Whether this was true is open to question; as previously noted, death was the normal fate of any soldier who could not be ransomed.

The French force was not only larger than that of the English, their noble men-at-arms would have considered themselves superior to the large number of archers in the English army, whom the French (based on their experience in recent memory of using and facing archers) considered relatively insignificant. For example, the chronicler Edmond de Dyntner stated that there were "ten French nobles against one English", ignoring the archers completely. Several French accounts emphasise that the French leaders were so eager to defeat the English (and win the ransoms of the English men-at-arms) that they insisted on being in the first line; as one of the contemporary accounts put it: "All the lords wanted to be in the vanguard, against the opinion of the constable and the experienced knights."

The French were arrayed in three lines or "battles". The first line was led by Constable d'Albret, <a href="Marshal%20of%20France">Marshal</a> <a href="Jean%20Le%20Maingre">Boucicault</a>, and the <a href="Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Dukes of Orléans</a> and <a href="John%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbon</a>, with attached cavalry wings under the <a href="Louis%2C%20Count%20of%20Vend%C3%B4me">Count of Vendôme</a> and Sir Clignet de Brebant. The second line was commanded by the <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20Bar">Dukes of Bar</a> and <a href="John%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Alen%C3%A7on">Alençon</a> and the <a href="Philip%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Nevers">Count of Nevers</a>. The third line was under the <a href="Counts%20of%20Dammartin">Counts of Dammartin</a> and Fauconberg. The Burgundian chronicler, <a href="Jean%20de%20Wavrin">Jean de Wavrin</a>, writes that there were 8,000 men-at-arms, 4,000 archers and 1,500 crossbowmen in the vanguard, with two wings of 600 and 800 mounted men-at-arms, and the main battle having "as many knights, esquires and archers as in the vanguard", with the rearguard containing "all of the rest of the men-at-arms". The Herald of Berry uses somewhat different figures of 4,800 men-at-arms in the first line, 3,000 men in the second line, with two "wings" containing 600 mounted men-at-arms each, and a total of "10,000 men-at-arms", but does not mention a third line.

Thousands of troops appear to have been in the rearguard, containing servants and commoners whom the French were either unable or unwilling to deploy. Wavrin gives the total French army size as 50,000: "They had plenty of archers and crossbowmen but nobody wanted to let them fire . The reason for this was that the site was so narrow that there was only enough room for the men-at-arms." A different source says that the French did not even deploy 4,000 of the best crossbowmen "on the pretext they had no need of their help".

The field of battle was arguably the most significant factor in deciding the outcome. The recently ploughed land hemmed in by dense woodland favoured the English, both because of its narrowness, and because of the thick mud through which the French knights had to walk.

Accounts of the battle describe the French engaging the English men-at-arms before being rushed from the sides by the longbowmen as the <a href="m%C3%AAl%C3%A9e">mêlée</a> developed. The English account in the "Gesta Henrici" says: "For when some of them, killed when battle was first joined, fall at the front, so great was the undisciplined violence and pressure of the mass of men behind them that the living fell on top of the dead, and others falling on top of the living were killed as well."

Although the French initially pushed the English back, they became so closely packed that they were described as having trouble using their weapons properly. The French monk of St. Denis says: "Their vanguard, composed of about 5,000 men, found itself at first so tightly packed that those who were in the third rank could scarcely use their swords," and the Burgundian sources have a similar passage.

As the battle was fought on a recently ploughed field, and there had recently been heavy rain leaving it very muddy, it proved very tiring to walk through in full plate armour. The French monk of St. Denis describes the French troops as "marching through the middle of the mud where they sank up to their knees. So they were already overcome with fatigue even before they advanced against the enemy". The deep, soft mud particularly favoured the English force because, once knocked to the ground, the heavily armoured French knights had a hard time getting back up to fight in the mêlée. Barker states that some knights, encumbered by their armour, actually drowned in their helmets.

On the morning of 25 October, the French were still waiting for additional troops to arrive. The <a href="Anthony%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brabant">Duke of Brabant</a> (about 2,000 men), the <a href="Louis%20II%20of%20Naples">Duke of Anjou</a> (about 600 men), and the <a href="John%20VI%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany">Duke of Brittany</a> (6,000 men, according to Monstrelet), were all marching to join the army.

For three hours after sunrise there was no fighting. Military textbooks of the time stated: "Everywhere and on all occasions that foot soldiers march against their enemy face to face, those who march lose and those who remain standing still and holding firm win." On top of this, the French were expecting thousands of men to join them if they waited. They were blocking Henry's retreat, and were perfectly happy to wait for as long as it took. There had even been a suggestion that the English would run away rather than give battle when they saw that they would be fighting so many French princes.

Henry's men, on the other hand, were already very weary from hunger, illness and marching. Even though Henry knew as well as the French did that his army would perform better on the defensive, he was eventually forced to take a calculated risk, and move his army farther forward to start the battle. This entailed abandoning his chosen position and pulling out, advancing, and then re-installing the long sharpened wooden stakes pointed outwards toward the enemy, which helped protect the longbowmen from cavalry charges. (The use of stakes was an innovation for the English: during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy">Battle of Crécy</a>, for example, the archers had been instead protected by pits and other obstacles.)

The tightness of the terrain also seems to have restricted the planned deployment of the French forces. The French had originally drawn up a battle plan that had archers and crossbowmen in front of their men-at-arms, with a cavalry force at the rear specifically designed to "fall upon the archers, and use their force to break them," but in the event, the French archers and crossbowmen were deployed "behind" and to the sides of the men-at-arms (where they seem to have played almost no part, except possibly for an initial volley of arrows at the start of the battle). The cavalry force, which could have devastated the English line if it had attacked while they moved their stakes, charged only "after" the initial volley of arrows from the English. It is unclear whether the delay occurred because the French were hoping the English would launch a frontal assault (and were surprised when the English instead started shooting from their new defensive position), or whether the French mounted knights instead did not react quickly enough to the English advance. French chroniclers agree that when the mounted charge did come, it did not contain as many men as it should have; Gilles le Bouvier states that some had wandered off to warm themselves and others were walking or feeding their horses.

The French cavalry, despite being somewhat disorganised and not at full numbers, charged towards the longbowmen, but it was a disaster, with the French knights unable to outflank the longbowmen (because of the encroaching woodland) and unable to charge through the forest of sharpened stakes that protected the archers. <a href="John%20Keegan">John Keegan</a> argues that the longbows' main influence on the battle at this point was injuries to horses: armoured only on the head, many horses would have become dangerously out of control when struck in the back or flank from the high-elevation long range shots used as the charge started. The mounted charge and subsequent retreat churned up the already muddy terrain between the French and the English. Juliet Barker quotes a contemporary account by a monk of <a href="Saint%20Denis%20Basilica">St. Denis</a> who reports how the wounded and panicking horses galloped through the advancing infantry, scattering them and trampling them down in their headlong flight from the battlefield.

The plate armour of the French men-at-arms allowed them to close the 300 yards or so to the English lines while being under what the French monk of Saint Denis described as "a terrifying hail of arrow shot". A complete coat of plate was considered such good protection that shields were generally not used, although the Burgundian contemporary sources specifically distinguish between Frenchmen who used shields and those who did not, and Rogers has suggested that the front elements of the French force may have used axes and shields. Modern historians are somewhat divided on how effective the longbow fire would have been against plate armour of the time, with some modern texts suggesting that arrows could not penetrate, especially the better quality steel armour, but others suggesting arrows could penetrate, especially the poorer quality <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> armour. Rogers suggests that the longbow could penetrate a wrought iron breastplate at short range and penetrate the thinner armour on the limbs even at . He considers a knight in the best quality steel armour would have been more or less invulnerable to an arrow on the breastplate or top of the helmet, but would still have been vulnerable to shots hitting the limbs, particularly at close range. In any case, to protect themselves as much as possible from the arrows, the French had to lower their visors and bend their helmeted heads to avoid being shot in the face—the eye and air-holes in their helmets were among the weakest points in the armour. This head lowered position restricted both their breathing and their vision. Then they had to walk a few hundred yards through thick mud, a press of comrades and wearing armour weighing , gathering sticky clay all the way. Increasingly they had to walk around or over fallen comrades.

The surviving French men-at-arms reached the front of the English line and pushed it back, with the longbowmen on the flanks continuing to shoot at point-blank range. When the archers ran out of arrows, they dropped their bows and using <a href="hatchet">hatchet</a>s, <a href="sword">sword</a>s and the <a href="mallet">mallet</a>s they had used to drive their stakes in, attacked the now disordered, fatigued and wounded French men-at-arms massed in front of them. The French could not cope with the thousands of lightly armoured longbowmen assailants (who were much less hindered by the mud and weight of their armour) combined with the English men-at-arms. The impact of thousands of arrows, combined with the slog in heavy armour through the mud, the heat and lack of oxygen in plate armour with the visor down, and the crush of their numbers meant the French men-at-arms could "scarcely lift their weapons" when they finally engaged the English line. The exhausted French men-at-arms are described as being knocked to the ground by the English and then unable to get back up. As the <a href="Melee">mêlée</a> developed, the French second line also joined the attack, but they too were swallowed up, with the narrow terrain meaning the extra numbers could not be used effectively. Rogers suggests that the French at the back of their deep formation would have been attempting to push forward and quite literally add their weight to the advance, without realising that they were hindering the ability of those at the front to manoeuvre and fight, actually pushing them into the English formation of lancepoints. After the initial wave, the French would have had to fight over and on the bodies of those who had fallen before them. In such a "press" of thousands of men, Rogers finds it plausible that a significant number could have suffocated in their armour, as is described by several sources, and is also known to have happened in other battles.

The French men-at-arms were taken prisoner or killed in the thousands. The fighting lasted about three hours, but eventually the leaders of the second line were killed or captured, as those of the first line had been. The English "Gesta Henrici" describes three great heaps of the slain around the three main English standards.
According to contemporary English accounts, Henry was directly involved in the hand-to-hand fighting. Upon hearing that his youngest brother <a href="Humphrey%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester</a> had been wounded in the groin, Henry took his household guard and stood over his brother, in the front rank of the fighting, until Humphrey could be dragged to safety. The king received an axe blow to the head, which knocked off a piece of the crown that formed part of his helmet.

The only French success was an attack on the lightly protected English baggage train, with Ysembart d'Azincourt (leading a small number of men-at-arms and <a href="Squire">varlets</a> plus about 600 peasants) seizing some of Henry's personal treasures, including a crown. Whether this was part of a deliberate French plan or an act of local <a href="brigandage">brigandage</a> is unclear from the sources. Certainly, d'Azincourt was a local knight but he may have been chosen to lead the attack because of his local knowledge and the lack of availability of a more senior soldier. In some accounts the attack happened towards the end of the battle, and led the English to think they were being attacked from the rear. Barker, following the "Gesta Henrici", believed to have been written by an English chaplain who was actually in the baggage train, concludes that the attack happened at the "start" of the battle.

Regardless of when the baggage assault happened, at some point after the initial English victory, Henry became alarmed that the French were regrouping for another attack. The "Gesta Henrici" places this after the English had overcome the onslaught of the French men-at-arms and the weary English troops were eyeing the French rearguard ("in incomparable number and still fresh"). Le Fèvre and Wavrin similarly say that it was signs of the French rearguard regrouping and "marching forward in battle order" which made the English think they were still in danger. A slaughter of the French prisoners ensued. It seems it was purely a decision of Henry, since the English knights found it contrary to <a href="chivalry">chivalry</a>, and contrary to their interests to kill valuable hostages for whom it was commonplace to ask <a href="ransom">ransom</a>. Henry threatened to hang whoever did not obey his orders.

In any event, Henry ordered the slaughter of what were perhaps several thousand French prisoners, sparing only the most high ranked (presumably those most likely to fetch a large ransom under the chivalric system of warfare). According to most chroniclers, Henry's fear was that the prisoners (who, in an unusual turn of events, actually outnumbered their captors) would realize their advantage in numbers, rearm themselves with the weapons strewn about the field and overwhelm the exhausted English forces. Contemporary chroniclers did not criticise him for it. In his study of the battle, John Keegan argued that the main aim was not to actually kill the French knights but rather to terrorise them into submission and quell any possibility they might resume the fight, which would probably have caused the uncommitted French reserve forces to join the fray, as well. Such an event would have posed a risk to the still-outnumbered English and could have easily turned a stunning victory into a mutually-destructive defeat, as the English forces were now largely intermingled with the French and would have suffered grievously from the arrows of their own longbowmen had they needed to resume shooting. Keegan also speculated that due to the relatively low number of archers actually involved in killing the French knights (roughly 200 by his estimate), together with the refusal of the English knights to assist in a duty they saw as distastefully unchivalrous and combined with the sheer difficulty of killing such a large number of prisoners in such a short space of time, the actual number of French knights killed might not have even reached the hundreds before the reserves fled the field and Henry called an end to the slaughter.

The lack of reliable sources makes it impossible to give a precise figure for the French and English <a href="Casualty%20%28person%29">casualties</a> (dead, wounded, taken prisoner). However, it is clear that though the English were outnumbered, their losses were far lower than those of the French. The French sources all give 4,000–10,000 French dead, with up to 1,600 English dead. The lowest ratio in these French sources has the French losing six times more men than the English. The English sources vary between about 1,500 and 11,000 for the French dead, with English dead put at no more than 100. Barker identifies from the available records "at least" 112 Englishmen killed in the fighting, including <a href="Edward%20of%20Norwich%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20York">Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York</a>, a grandson of <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III</a>.

One widely used estimate puts the English casualties at 450, not an insignificant number in an army of about 8,500, but far fewer than the thousands the French lost, nearly all of whom were killed or captured. Using the lowest French estimate of their own dead of 4,000 would imply a ratio of nearly 9 to 1 in favour of the English, or over 10 to 1 if the prisoners are included.

The French suffered heavily. Three <a href="duke">duke</a>s, at least eight <a href="count">count</a>s, a <a href="viscount">viscount</a>, and an <a href="archbishop">archbishop</a> died, along with numerous other nobles. Of the great royal office holders, France lost her Constable, Admiral, Master of the Crossbowmen and "prévôt" of the marshals. The "<a href="bailli">bailli</a>s" of nine major northern towns were killed, often along with their sons, relatives and supporters. In the words of Juliet Barker, the battle "cut a great swath through the natural leaders of French society in <a href="County%20of%20Artois">Artois</a>, <a href="Ponthieu">Ponthieu</a>, <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, <a href="Picardy">Picardy</a>." Estimates of the number of prisoners vary between 700 and 2,200, amongst them the <a href="Charles%2C%20duc%20d%27Orl%C3%A9ans">Duke of Orléans</a> (the famous poet Charles d'Orléans) and <a href="Jean%20Le%20Maingre">Jean Le Maingre</a> (known as Boucicault) <a href="Marshal%20of%20France">Marshal of France</a>.

Although the victory had been militarily decisive, its impact was complex. It did not lead to further English conquests immediately as Henry's priority was to return to England, which he did on 16 November, to be received in triumph in London on the 23rd. Henry returned a conquering hero, in the eyes of his subjects and European powers outside France, blessed by God. It established the legitimacy of the Lancastrian monarchy and the future campaigns of Henry to pursue his "rights and privileges" in France. Other benefits to the English were longer term. Very quickly after the battle, the fragile truce between the <a href="Armagnac%20%28party%29">Armagnac</a> and <a href="Burgundian%20%28party%29">Burgundian</a> factions broke down. The brunt of the battle had fallen on the Armagnacs and it was they who suffered the majority of senior casualties and carried the blame for the defeat. The Burgundians seized on the opportunity and within 10 days of the battle had mustered their armies and marched on Paris. This lack of unity in France allowed Henry eighteen months to prepare militarily and politically for a renewed campaign. When that campaign took place, it was made easier by the damage done to the political and military structures of Normandy by the battle.

Notable casualties (most named by <a href="Enguerrand%20de%20Monstrelet">Enguerrand de Monstrelet</a>) include:

Leading officers:


Three dukes:

Six counts (seven with d'Albret):

Among the "circa" 1,500 prisoners taken by the English, were the following French notables:


<a href="Anne%20Curry">Anne Curry</a> in her 2005 book "Agincourt: A New History", argues (based on research into the surviving administrative records) that the French army was about 12,000 strong, and the English army about 9,000, giving proportions of four to three. By contrast, <a href="Juliet%20Barker">Juliet Barker</a> in her book "Agincourt: The King, the Campaign, the Battle" (also published in 2005) argues the English and Welsh were outnumbered "at least four to one and possibly as much as six to one". She suggests figures of about 6,000 for the English and 36,000 for the French, based on the "Gesta Henrici"s figures of 5,000 archers and 900 men-at-arms for the English, and <a href="Jean%20de%20Wavrin">Jean de Wavrin</a>'s statement "that the French were six times more numerous than the English". The 2009 "Encyclopædia Britannica" uses the figures of about 6,000 for the English and 20,000 to 30,000 for the French. The 1911 "Britannica" used somewhat different figures of 6,000 archers, 1,000 men-at-arms and "a few thousands of other foot" for the English, with the French outnumbering them by "at least four times".

With one of the lowest estimates for the size of the French army and also one of the highest estimates for the size of the English army, Curry is currently in a minority in suggesting that the ratio of forces were as near equal as four to three. While not necessarily agreeing with the exact numbers Curry uses, some historians have however given support to her assertion that the French army was much smaller than traditionally thought, and the English somewhat bigger. Bertrand Schnerb, a professor of medieval history at the University of Lille, has said that he thinks the French probably had 12,000–15,000 troops. Ian Mortimer, in his 2009 book "1415: Henry V's Year of Glory", notes how Curry "minimises French numbers (by limiting her figures to those in the basic army and a few specific additional companies) and maximises English numbers (by assuming the numbers sent home from Harfleur were no greater than sick lists)", but agrees that previous estimates have exaggerated the odds, and suggests that "the most extreme imbalance which is credible is fifteen thousand French troops against 8,100 English: a ratio of about two-to-one".

However, Clifford J. Rogers, professor of history at the United States Military Academy at West Point, has recently argued that archival records are too incomplete to substantially change his view that the English were outnumbered about 4–1. Juliet Barker also disagrees with Curry's arguments in the acknowledgements section of her 2005 book on Agincourt, saying: "Surviving administrative records on both sides, but especially the French, are simply too incomplete to support [Curry's] assertion that nine thousand English were pitted against an army only twelve thousand strong. And if the differential really was as low as three to four then this makes a nonsense of the course of the battle as described by eyewitnesses and contemporaries."

Those supporting a greater imbalance have generally put more store by contemporary (and especially eyewitness) accounts. The "Gesta Henrici" gives plausible figures for the English of 5,000 archers and 900 men-at-arms, but Mortimer notes it is "wildly inaccurate" in stating the English were outnumbered 30–1, and there have also been doubts as to how much it was written as propaganda for Henry V. The proportions also seem incorrect, as from surviving records we know that Henry set out with about four times as many archers as men-at-arms, not five and a half times as many. Those who have supported the Gesta figures for the English army have generally thought that although the English army may have left Harfleur with eight or nine thousand men, it is plausible that after weeks of campaigning and disease in hostile territory they would have lost two or three thousand fighting men; however Mortimer states: "Despite the trials of the march, Henry had lost very few men to illness or death; and we have independent testimony that no more than 160 had been captured on the way." 

As Mortimer notes, the Burgundian numbers for the size of the French vanguard of 8,000 men-at-arms in the vanguard with 1,400 (or 2,400) men-at-arms in the wings correspond roughly with the figures of ten thousand men-at-arms recorded by the duke of Berry's herald. The Burgundians also recorded 4,000 archers and 1,500 crossbowmen in the "vanguard", which would suggest "fourteen or fifteen thousand fighting men". (It should be noted that the Burgundians actually give the total size of the French army as an implausible 50,000, and the numbers they use do not correspond closely to the odds they describe. Using very similar numbers, Jean Le Fevre states that the English were outnumbered 3–1, whereas Wavrin states that the English were outnumbered 6–1.)

One particular cause of confusion may have been the number of servants on both sides. Mortimer suggests that because there were a much higher proportion of men-at-arms on the French side, the number of non-combatants was much higher. Each man-at-arms could be expected to have a page, who would have ridden one of his spare horses. If the French army had an extra 10,000 mounted men (as opposed to only 1,500 extra for the English), then "the English probably did see an army about three times the size of their own fighting force".

It is open to debate whether these should all be counted as non-combatants; Rogers (for example) accepts that the French probably had about 10,000 men-at-arms, but explicitly includes one "gros valet" (an armed, armoured and mounted military servant) per French man-at-arms in his calculation of the odds.

Soon after the English victory at Agincourt, a number of popular folk songs were created about the battle, the most famous being the "<a href="Agincourt%20Carol">Agincourt Carol</a>", produced in the first half of the 15th century. Other ballads followed, including "<a href="King%20Henry%20Fifth%27s%20Conquest%20of%20France">King Henry Fifth's Conquest of France</a>", raising the popular prominence of particular events mentioned only in passing by the original chroniclers, such as the gift of tennis balls before the campaign.

The most famous cultural depiction of the battle today, however, is through <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="Henry%20V%20%28play%29">Henry V</a>", written in 1599. The play focuses on the pressures of kingship, the tensions between how a king should appear – chivalric, honest and just – and how a king must sometimes act – Machiavellian and ruthless. These tensions are illustrated in the play by Shakespeare's depiction of Henry's decision to kill some of the French prisoners, whilst attempting to justify it and distance himself from the event – this moment of the battle is portrayed both as a break with the traditions of chivalry, and as key example of the paradox of kingship. Shakespeare's depiction of the battle also plays on the theme of modernity – Shakespeare contrasts the modern, English king and his army with the medieval, chivalric, older model of the French. Shakespeare's play presented Henry as leading a truly English force into battle, playing on the importance of the link between the monarch and the common soldiers in the fight. The original play does not, however, feature any scenes of the actual battle itself, leading critic Rose Zimbardo to characterise it as "full of warfare, yet empty of conflict."

The play introduced the famous <a href="St%20Crispin%27s%20Day%20Speech">St Crispin's Day Speech</a>; Shakespeare has Henry give a moving narration to his soldiers just before the battle, urging his "band of brothers" to stand together in the forthcoming fight. One of Shakespeare's most heroic speeches, critic David Margolies describes how it "oozes honour, military glory, love of country and self-sacrifice", and it forms one of the first instances of English literature linking solidarity and comradeship to success in battle. Partially as a result, the battle was used as a metaphor at the beginning of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, when the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">British Expeditionary Force</a>'s attempts to stop the German advances were widely likened to it.

Shakespeare's version of the battle of Agincourt has been turned into (several minor and) two major films – by <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a> in <a href="Henry%20V%20%281944%20film%29">1944</a>, and by <a href="Kenneth%20Branagh">Kenneth Branagh</a> in <a href="Henry%20V%20%281989%20film%29">1989</a>. Made just prior to the invasion of Normandy, Olivier's gives the battle what Sarah Hatchuel has termed an "exhilarating and heroic" tone, with an artificial, cinematic look to the battle scenes. Branagh's version gives a longer, more <a href="Realism%20%28arts%29">Realist</a> portrayal of the battle itself, drawing on both historical sources and images from the Vietnam and Falkland Wars. In his film adaptation, Peter Babakitis uses digital effects to exaggerate realist features during his battle scenes, producing a more <a href="Experimental%20film">avant-garde</a> interpretation of the fighting at Agincourt. 

The battle remains an important symbol in popular culture. For example, a mock trial of Henry V for the crimes associated with the slaughter of the prisoners was held in Washington, D.C. in March 2010, drawing from both the historical record and Shakespeare's play. Participating as judges were Justices <a href="Samuel%20Alito">Samuel Alito</a> and <a href="Ruth%20Bader%20Ginsburg">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a>. The trial ranged widely over whether there was just cause for war and not simply the prisoner issue. Although an audience vote was "too close to call", Henry was unanimously found guilty by the court on the basis of "evolving standards of civil society".

There is a modern museum in Agincourt village dedicated to the battle. The museum lists the names of combatants of both sides who died in the battle.

Bronze Age

The Bronze Age is a historical <a href="Periodization">period</a> characterized by the use of <a href="bronze">bronze</a>, <a href="proto-writing">proto-writing</a>, and other early features of urban <a href="civilization">civilization</a>. The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the <a href="three-age%20system">three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system</a>, as proposed in modern times by <a href="Christian%20J%C3%BCrgensen%20Thomsen">Christian Jürgensen Thomsen</a>, for classifying and studying ancient societies.

An ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by producing <a href="bronze">bronze</a> by <a href="smelting">smelting</a> its own <a href="copper">copper</a> and alloying with <a href="tin">tin</a>, <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>, or other metals, or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere. Bronze itself is harder and more durable than other metals available at the time, allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage.

Copper-tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in <a href="Western%20Asia">Western Asia</a> before trading in bronze began in the <a href="3rd%20millennium%20BC">3rd millennium BC</a>. Worldwide, the Bronze Age generally followed the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> period, with the <a href="Chalcolithic">Chalcolithic</a> serving as a transition. Although the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> generally followed the Bronze Age, in some areas (such as <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>), the Iron Age intruded directly on the Neolithic.

Bronze Age cultures differed in their <a href="history%20of%20writing">development of the first writing</a>. According to archaeological evidence, cultures in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> (<a href="cuneiform%20script">cuneiform script</a>) and <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> (<a href="hieroglyph">hieroglyph</a>s) developed the earliest viable writing systems.

The overall period is characterized by widespread use of bronze, though the place and time of the introduction and development of bronze technology were not universally synchronous. Human-made tin bronze technology requires set production techniques. Tin must be mined (mainly as the tin ore <a href="cassiterite">cassiterite</a>) and smelted separately, then added to molten copper to make bronze alloy. The Bronze Age was a time of extensive use of metals and of developing trade networks (See "<a href="Tin%20sources%20and%20trade%20in%20ancient%20times">Tin sources and trade in ancient times</a>"). A 2013 report suggests that the earliest tin-alloy bronze dates to the mid-5th millennium BC in a <a href="Vin%C4%8Da%20culture">Vinča culture</a> site in <a href="Plo%C4%8Dnik%20%28archaeological%20site%29">Pločnik</a> (<a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>), although the civilization is not conventionally considered part of the Bronze Age. The dating of the foil has been disputed. The tin bronze foil are not the only evidence from the fifth millennium BC. 14 other tin bronze artefacts from the Balkans has been proved that they also were from smelting copper-tin ores.

The Near East was the first region to enter the Bronze Age, which began with the rise of the <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>n civilization of <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a> in the mid 4th millennium BC. Cultures in the ancient Near East (often called one of "the <a href="cradles%20of%20civilization">cradles of civilization</a>") practiced intensive year-round agriculture, developed a writing system, invented the <a href="potter%27s%20wheel">potter's wheel</a>, created a centralized government, written law codes, city and nation states, empires, embarked on advanced architectural projects, introduced <a href="social%20stratification">social stratification</a>, economic and civil administration, <a href="slavery">slavery</a>, and practiced organized warfare, medicine and religion. Societies in the region laid the foundations for <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="astrology">astrology</a>.

The Ancient Near East Bronze Age can be divided as follows:

In <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, the <a href="Bronze%20Age%20Mesopotamia">Mesopotamian Bronze Age</a> began about 3500 BC and ended with the <a href="Kassites">Kassite</a> period (BC – BC). The usual tripartite division into an Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age is not used. Instead, a division primarily based on art-historical and historical characteristics is more common.

The <a href="cities%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Near%20East">cities of the Ancient Near East</a> housed several tens of thousands of people. <a href="Ur">Ur</a>, <a href="Kish%20%28Sumer%29">Kish</a>, <a href="Isin">Isin</a>, <a href="Larsa">Larsa</a> and <a href="Nippur">Nippur</a> in the Middle Bronze Age and <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>, <a href="Calah">Calah</a> and <a href="Assur">Assur</a> in the Late Bronze Age similarly had large populations. The <a href="Akkadian%20Empire">Akkadian Empire</a> (2335–2154 BC) became the dominant power in the region, and after its fall the Sumerians enjoyed a renaissance with the <a href="Neo-Sumerian%20Empire">Neo-Sumerian Empire</a>. <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a> was extant from as early as the 25th century BC, and became a regional power with the <a href="Old%20Assyrian%20Empire">Old Assyrian Empire</a> (–1750 BC). The earliest mention of <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a> (then a small administrative town) appears on a tablet from the reign of <a href="Sargon%20of%20Akkad">Sargon of Akkad</a> in the 23rd century BC. The <a href="Amorite">Amorite</a> dynasty established the <a href="city-state">city-state</a> of Babylon in the 19th century BC. Over 100 years later, it briefly took over the other city-states and formed the short lived First <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>n Empire during what is also called the <a href="First%20Babylonian%20Dynasty">Old Babylonian Period</a>. Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia all used the written <a href="East%20Semitic%20languages">East Semitic</a> <a href="Akkadian%20language">Akkadian language</a> for official use and as a spoken language. By that time, the Sumerian language was no longer spoken, but was still in religious use in Assyria and Babylonia, and would remain so until the 1st century AD. The <a href="Akkadian">Akkadian</a> and <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a>ian traditions played a major role in later Assyrian and Babylonian culture, even though Babylonia (unlike the more militarily powerful Assyria) itself was founded by non-native <a href="Amorites">Amorites</a> and often ruled by other non-indigenous peoples, such as <a href="Kassites">Kassites</a>, <a href="Arameans">Arameans</a> and <a href="Chaldea">Chaldea</a>ns, as well as its Assyrian neighbours.

<a href="Elam">Elam</a> was a "pre-Iranic" ancient civilization located to the east of Mesopotamia. In the Old Elamite period (Middle Bronze Age), Elam consisted of kingdoms on the <a href="Iranian%20Plateau">Iranian Plateau</a>, centered in <a href="Anshan%20%28Persia%29">Anshan</a>, and from the mid-2nd millennium BC, it was centered in <a href="Susa">Susa</a> in the <a href="Khuzestan">Khuzestan</a> lowlands. Its culture played a crucial role in the <a href="Gutian%20people">Gutian Empire</a> and especially during the <a href="Iranic">Iranic</a> <a href="Achaemenid%20dynasty">Achaemenid dynasty</a> that succeeded it.

The <a href="Bactria%E2%80%93Margiana%20Archaeological%20Complex">Oxus civilization</a> was a Bronze Age <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>n culture dated to –1700 BC and centered on the upper <a href="Amu%20Darya">Amu Darya</a> (Oxus). In the Early Bronze Age the culture of the <a href="Kopet%20Dag">Kopet Dag</a> oases and <a href="Altyndepe">Altyndepe</a> developed a proto-urban society. This corresponds to level IV at <a href="Namazga-Tepe">Namazga-Tepe</a>. Altyndepe was a major centre even then. Pottery was wheel-turned. Grapes were grown. The height of this urban development was reached in the Middle Bronze Age BC, corresponding to level V at Namazga-Depe. This Bronze Age culture is called the <a href="Bactria%E2%80%93Margiana%20Archaeological%20Complex">Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex</a> (BMAC).

The <a href="Kulli%20culture">Kulli culture</a>, similar to those of the <a href="Indus%20Valley%20Civilisation">Indus Valley Civilisation</a>, was located in southern <a href="Balochistan">Balochistan</a> (Gedrosia) –2000 BC. Agriculture was the economical base of this people. At several places dams were found, providing evidence for a highly developed water management system.

<a href="Konar%20Sandal">Konar Sandal</a> is associated with the hypothesized "<a href="Jiroft%20culture">Jiroft culture</a>", a 3rd-millennium-BC culture postulated on the basis of a collection of artifacts confiscated in 2001.

The <a href="Hittite%20Empire">Hittite Empire</a> was established in <a href="Hattusa">Hattusa</a> in northern Anatolia from the 18th century BC. In the 14th century BC, the Hittite Kingdom was at its height, encompassing central Anatolia, southwestern <a href="Syria">Syria</a> as far as <a href="Ugarit">Ugarit</a>, and upper <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. After 1180 BC, amid general turmoil in the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> conjectured to have been associated with the sudden arrival of the <a href="Sea%20Peoples">Sea Peoples</a>, the kingdom disintegrated into several independent "Neo-Hittite" city-states, some of which survived until as late as the 8th century BC.

<a href="Arzawa">Arzawa</a> in Western Anatolia during the second half of the <a href="second%20millennium%20BC">second millennium BC</a> likely extended along southern Anatolia in a belt that reaches from near the <a href="Turkish%20Lakes%20Region">Turkish Lakes Region</a> to the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a> coast. <a href="Arzawa">Arzawa</a> was the western neighbor—sometimes a rival and sometimes a vassal—of the <a href="Hittite%20Kingdom">Middle and New Hittite Kingdoms</a>.

The <a href="Assuwa%20league">Assuwa league</a> was a confederation of states in western Anatolia that was defeated by the Hittites under an earlier <a href="Tudhaliya%20I">Tudhaliya I</a>, around 1400 BC. Arzawa has been associated with the much more obscure <a href="Assuwa">Assuwa</a> generally located to its north. It probably bordered it, and may even be an alternative term for it (at least during some periods).

In modern scholarship the chronology of the Bronze Age Levant is divided into Early/Proto Syrian; corresponding to the Early Bronze. Old Syrian; corresponding to the Middle Bronze. Middle Syrian; corresponding to the Late Bronze. The term Neo-Syria is used to designate the early <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>.

The old Syrian period was dominated by the <a href="Ebla%23First%20kingdom">Eblaite first kingdom</a>, <a href="Tell%20Brak%23Kingdom%20of%20Nagar">Nagar</a> and the <a href="Mari%2C%20Syria%23The%20second%20kingdom">Mariote second kingdom</a>. The Akkadian conquered large areas of the Levant and were followed by the <a href="Amorites">Amorite kingdoms</a>, –1600 BC, which arose in <a href="Mari%2C%20Syria%23The%20Lim%20dynasty">Mari</a>, <a href="Yamhad">Yamhad</a>, <a href="Qatna">Qatna</a>, <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>. From the 15th century BC onward, the term <a href="Amurru%20kingdom">Amurru</a> is usually applied to the region extending north of Canaan as far as <a href="Kadesh%20%28Syria%29">Kadesh</a> on the <a href="Orontes%20River">Orontes River</a>.

The earliest known <a href="Ugarit">Ugarit</a> contact with Egypt (and the first exact dating of Ugaritic civilization) comes from a <a href="carnelian">carnelian</a> bead identified with the Middle Kingdom pharaoh Senusret I, 1971 –1926 BC. A <a href="stela">stela</a> and a statuette from the Egyptian pharaohs Senusret III and Amenemhet III have also been found. However, it is unclear at what time these monuments got to Ugarit. In the <a href="Amarna%20letters">Amarna letters</a>, messages from Ugarit BC written by Ammittamru I, Niqmaddu II, and his queen, were discovered. From the 16th to the 13th century BC, Ugarit remained in constant touch with Egypt and Cyprus (named Alashiya).

The <a href="Mitanni">Mitanni</a> was a loosely organized state in northern Syria and south-east Anatolia from BC–1300 BC. Founded by an Indo-Aryan ruling class that governed a predominately Hurrian population, Mitanni came to be a regional power after the Hittite destruction of Kassite Babylon created a power vacuum in Mesopotamia. At its beginning, Mitanni's major rival was Egypt under the Thutmosids. However, with the ascent of the Hittite empire, Mitanni and Egypt made an alliance to protect their mutual interests from the threat of Hittite domination. At the height of its power, during the 14th century BC, it had outposts centered on its capital, <a href="Washukanni">Washukanni</a>, which archaeologists have located on the headwaters of the Khabur River. Eventually, Mitanni succumbed to Hittite, and later Assyrian attacks, and was reduced to a province of the Middle Assyrian Empire.

The <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a> were an <a href="ancient%20Semitic-speaking%20peoples">ancient Semitic-speaking people</a> of the <a href="Ancient%20Near%20East">Ancient Near East</a> who inhabited part of <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a> during the <a href="history%20of%20ancient%20Israel%20and%20Judah">tribal and monarchic periods</a> (15th to 6th centuries BC), and lived in the region in smaller numbers after the fall of the monarchy. The name "Israel" first appears BC, at the end of the <a href="Late%20Bronze%20Age">Late Bronze Age</a> and the very beginning of the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>, on the <a href="Merneptah%20Stele">Merneptah Stele</a> raised by the Egyptian pharaoh <a href="Merneptah">Merneptah</a>.

The <a href="Arameans">Arameans</a> were a Northwest Semitic semi-nomadic and pastoralist people who originated in what is now modern Syria (Biblical Aram) during the Late Bronze Age and the early Iron Age. Large groups migrated to Mesopotamia, where they intermingled with the native Akkadian (Assyrian and Babylonian) population. The Aramaeans never had a unified empire; they were divided into independent kingdoms all across the Near East. After the Bronze Age collapse, their political influence was confined to a number of Syro-Hittite states, which were entirely absorbed into the Neo-Assyrian Empire by the 8th century BC.

In <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> the Bronze Age begins in the <a href="Protodynastic%20Period%20of%20Egypt">Protodynastic period</a>, BC. The archaic "early Bronze Age of Egypt", known as the <a href="Early%20Dynastic%20Period%20of%20Egypt">Early Dynastic Period of Egypt</a>, immediately follows the unification of Lower and Upper Egypt, BC. It is generally taken to include the First and Second Dynasties, lasting from the Protodynastic Period of Egypt until about 2686 BC, or the beginning of the Old Kingdom. With the First Dynasty, the capital moved from <a href="Abydos%2C%20Egypt">Abydos</a> to Memphis with a unified Egypt ruled by an Egyptian god-king. Abydos remained the major holy land in the south. The hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization, such as art, architecture and many aspects of religion, took shape during the Early Dynastic period. <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a> in the Early Bronze Age was the largest city of the time.
The <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a> of the regional Bronze Age is the name given to the period in the 3rd millennium BC when Egypt attained its first continuous peak of civilization in complexity and achievement – the first of three "Kingdom" periods, which mark the high points of civilization in the <a href="Geography%20of%20Egypt%23Nile%20Valley%20and%20Delta">lower Nile Valley</a> (the others being <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> and the <a href="New%20Kingdom">New Kingdom</a>).

The <a href="First%20Intermediate%20Period%20of%20Egypt">First Intermediate Period of Egypt</a>, often described as a "dark period" in ancient Egyptian history, spanned about 100 years after the end of the Old Kingdom from about 2181 to 2055 BC. Very little monumental evidence survives from this period, especially from the early part of it. The First Intermediate Period was a dynamic time when rule of Egypt was roughly divided between two competing power bases: <a href="Herakleopolis%20Magna">Heracleopolis</a> in Lower Egypt and <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Thebes</a> in Upper Egypt. These two kingdoms would eventually come into conflict, with the Theban kings conquering the north, resulting in reunification of Egypt under a single ruler during the second part of the 11th Dynasty.

The <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom of Egypt</a> lasted from 2055 to 1650 BC. During this period, the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">Osiris funerary cult</a> rose to dominate Egyptian popular religion. The period comprises two phases: the 11th Dynasty, which ruled from Thebes and the 12th and 13th Dynasties centered on <a href="el-Lisht">el-Lisht</a>. The unified kingdom was previously considered to comprise the 11th and 12th Dynasties, but historians now at least partially consider the 13th Dynasty to belong to the Middle Kingdom.

During the <a href="Second%20Intermediate%20Period">Second Intermediate Period</a>, Ancient Egypt fell into disarray for a second time, between the end of the Middle Kingdom and the start of the New Kingdom. It is best known for the <a href="Hyksos">Hyksos</a>, whose reign comprised the 15th and 16th dynasties. The Hyksos first appeared in Egypt during the 11th Dynasty, began their climb to power in the 13th Dynasty, and emerged from the Second Intermediate Period in control of <a href="Avaris">Avaris</a> and the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Delta</a>. By the 15th Dynasty, they ruled lower Egypt, and they were expelled at the end of the 17th Dynasty.

The <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom of Egypt</a>, also referred to as the Egyptian Empire, lasted from the 16th to the 11th century BC. The New Kingdom followed the Second Intermediate Period and was succeeded by the <a href="Third%20Intermediate%20Period">Third Intermediate Period</a>. It was Egypt's most prosperous time and marked the peak of Egypt's power. The later New Kingdom, i.e. the 19th and 20th Dynasties (1292–1069 BC), is also known as the <a href="Ramesside%20period">Ramesside period</a>, after the eleven pharaohs that took the name of Ramesses.

The <a href="Altai%20Mountains">Altai Mountains</a> in what is now southern <a href="Russia">Russia</a> and central <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> have been identified as the point of origin of a cultural enigma termed the <a href="Seima-Turbino%20Phenomenon">Seima-Turbino Phenomenon</a>. It is conjectured that changes in climate in this region around 2000 BC and the ensuing ecological, economic and political changes triggered a rapid and massive migration westward into northeast Europe, eastward into China and southward into <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> and <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>
However, recent genetic testings of sites in south Siberia and <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> (<a href="Andronovo">Andronovo</a> horizon) would rather support a spreading of the bronze technology via <a href="Indo-European%20migrations">Indo-European migrations</a> eastwards, as this technology was well known for quite a while in western regions.

Historians disagree about the dates of a "Bronze Age" in China. The difficulty lies in the term "Bronze Age", as it has been applied to signify a period in history when bronze tools replaced stone tools, and, later, were themselves replaced by iron ones. The medium of the new "Age" made that of the old obsolete. In China, however, any attempt to establish a definite set of dates for a Bronze Age is complicated by two factors:
The earliest bronze artifacts have been found in the <a href="Majiayao%20culture">Majiayao culture</a> site (between 3100 and 2700 BC), and from then on, the society gradually grew into the Bronze Age.

Bronze metallurgy in China originated in what is referred to as the <a href="Erlitou">Erlitou</a> () period, which some historians argue places it within the range of dates controlled by the <a href="Shang%20Dynasty">Shang dynasty</a>. Others believe the Erlitou sites belong to the preceding <a href="Xia%20Dynasty">Xia</a> () dynasty. The U.S. <a href="National%20Gallery%20of%20Art">National Gallery of Art</a> defines the Chinese Bronze Age as the "period between about 2000 BC and 771 BC," a period that begins with the Erlitou culture and ends abruptly with the disintegration of <a href="Western%20Zhou%20Dynasty">Western Zhou</a> rule. Though this provides a concise frame of reference, it overlooks the continued importance of bronze in Chinese metallurgy and culture. Since this is significantly later than the discovery of bronze in Mesopotamia, bronze technology could have been imported rather than discovered independently in China. While there may be reason to believe that bronzework developed inside China separately from outside influence, the discovery of Europoid <a href="Tarim%20mummies">mummies in Xinjiang</a> suggests a possible route of transmission from the West.

The <a href="Shang%20Dynasty">Shang Dynasty</a> of the <a href="Yellow%20River%20Valley">Yellow River Valley</a> rose to power after the <a href="Xia%20Dynasty">Xia Dynasty</a>. While some direct information about the Shang Dynasty comes from Shang-era inscriptions on bronze artifacts, most comes from oracle bones – turtle shells, cattle scapulae, or other bones – which bear glyphs that form the first significant corpus of recorded Chinese characters.

Iron is found from the <a href="Zhou%20Dynasty">Zhou Dynasty</a>, but its use is minimal. Chinese literature dating to the 6th century BC attests knowledge of iron smelting, yet bronze continues to occupy the seat of significance in the archaeological and historical record for some time after this. Historian W. C. White argues that iron did not supplant bronze "at any period before the end of the Zhou dynasty (256 BC)" and that bronze vessels make up the majority of metal vessels all the way through the <a href="Han%20Dynasty">Later Han period</a>, or to 221 BC .

The Chinese bronze artifacts generally are either utilitarian, like spear points or adze heads, or <a href="Chinese%20ritual%20bronzes">"ritual bronzes"</a>, which are more elaborate versions in precious materials of everyday vessels, as well as tools and weapons. Examples are the numerous large sacrificial tripods known as <a href="Ding%20%28vessel%29">dings</a> in Chinese; there are many other distinct shapes. Surviving identified Chinese ritual bronzes tend to be highly decorated, often with the "<a href="taotie">taotie</a>" motif, which involves highly stylized animal faces. These appear in three main motif types: those of demons, of symbolic animals, and of abstract symbols. Many large bronzes also bear <a href="Chinese%20bronze%20inscriptions">cast inscriptions</a> that are the great bulk of the surviving body of early <a href="Chinese%20writing">Chinese writing</a> and have helped historians and archaeologists piece together the history of China, especially during the Zhou Dynasty (1046–256 BC).

The bronzes of the Western Zhou Dynasty document large portions of history not found in the extant texts that were often composed by persons of varying rank and possibly even social class. Further, the medium of cast bronze lends the record they preserve a permanence not enjoyed by manuscripts. These inscriptions can commonly be subdivided into four parts: a reference to the date and place, the naming of the event commemorated, the list of gifts given to the artisan in exchange for the bronze, and a dedication. The relative points of reference these vessels provide have enabled historians to place most of the vessels within a certain time frame of the Western Zhou period, allowing them to trace the evolution of the vessels and the events they record.

The beginning of the Bronze Age on the peninsula is around 1000–800 BC. Although the Korean Bronze Age culture derives from the <a href="Liaoning%20bronze%20dagger%20culture">Liaoning</a> and Manchuria, it exhibits unique typology and styles, especially in ritual objects.

The <a href="Mumun%20pottery%20period">Mumun pottery period</a> is named after the Korean name for undecorated or plain cooking and storage vessels that form a large part of the pottery assemblage over the entire length of the period, but especially 850–550 BC. The Mumun period is known for the origins of intensive agriculture and complex societies in both the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese Archipelago.

The Middle Mumun pottery period culture of the southern <a href="Korean%20Peninsula">Korean Peninsula</a> gradually adopted bronze production (–600? BC) after a period when Liaoning-style bronze daggers and other bronze artifacts were exchanged as far as the interior part of the Southern Peninsula (–700 BC). The bronze daggers lent prestige and authority to the personages who wielded and were buried with them in high-status megalithic burials at south-coastal centres such as the <a href="Igeum-dong%20site">Igeum-dong site</a>. Bronze was an important element in ceremonies and as for mortuary offerings until 100.

The Bronze Age on the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> began around 3300 BC with the beginning of the <a href="Indus%20Valley%20Civilization">Indus Valley civilization</a>. Inhabitants of the Indus Valley, the <a href="Harappa">Harappa</a>ns, developed new techniques in metallurgy and produced copper, bronze, lead and tin. The Indian Bronze Age was followed by the Iron Age <a href="Vedic%20Period">Vedic Period</a>. The Late Harappan culture, which dates from 1900–1400 BC, overlapped the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age; thus it is difficult to date this transition accurately.

Dating back to the <a href="Neolithic%20Age">Neolithic Age</a>, the first bronze drum, called the <a href="Dong%20Son%20drum">Dong Son drum</a>, were uncovered in and around the <a href="Red%20River%20Delta">Red River Delta</a> regions of <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> and Southern China. These relate to the prehistoric <a href="Dong%20Son%20Culture">Dong Son Culture</a> of Vietnam. In <a href="Ban%20Chiang">Ban Chiang</a>, <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, (<a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>) bronze <a href="artifact%20%28archaeology%29">artifacts</a> have been discovered dating to 2100 BC. However, according to the radiocarbon dating on the human and pig bones in Ban Chiang, some scholars propose that the initial Bronze Age in Ban Chiang was in late 2nd millennium. In <a href="Nyaunggan">Nyaunggan</a>, <a href="Burma">Burma</a>, bronze tools have been excavated along with ceramics and stone artifacts. Dating is still currently broad (3500–500 BC). Ban Non Wat, excavated by Charles Higham, was a rich site with over 640 graves excavated that gleaned many complex bronze items that may have had social value connected to them.

Ban Chiang, however, is the most thoroughly documented site while having the clearest evidence of metallurgy when it comes to Southeast Asia. With a rough date range of late 3rd millennium BC to the first millennium AD, this site alone has various artifacts such as burial pottery (dating from 2100–1700 BC), fragments of Bronze, copper-base bangles, and much more. What's interesting about this site, however, isn't just the old age of the artifacts but the fact that this technology suggested on-site casting from the very beginning. The on-site casting supports the theory that Bronze was first introduced in Southeast Asia as fully developed which therefore shows that Bronze was actually innovated from a different country. Some scholars believe that the copper-based metallurgy was disseminated from northwest and central China via south and southwest areas such as Guangdong province and Yunnan province and finally into southeast Asia around 1000 BC.

Archaeological research in Northern Vietnam indicates an increase in rates of infectious disease following the advent of metallurgy; skeletal fragments in sites dating to the early and mid-Bronze Age evidence a greater proportion of lesions than in sites of earlier periods. There are a few possible implications of this. One is the increase contact with bacterial and/or fungal pathogens due to increased population density and land clearing/ cultivation. The other one is decreased levels of immunocompetence in the Metal age due to changes in diet caused by agriculture. The last is that there may have been an emergence of infectious disease in the Da But period that evolved into a more virulent form in the metal period. Archaeology also suggests that Bronze Age metallurgy may not have been as significant a catalyst in social stratification and warfare in Southeast Asia as in other regions, social distribution shifting away from chiefdom-states to a heterarchical network. Data analyses of sites such as Ban Lum Khao, Ban Na Di, Non Nok Tha, Khok Phanom Di, and Nong Nor have consistently led researchers to conclude that there was no forentrenched hierarchy.

A few examples of named Bronze Age cultures in Europe in roughly relative order.

The oldest securely dated tin bronze artefact are found in the heart of the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> in <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>. A tin bronze foil from the <a href="Plo%C4%8Dnik%20%28archaeological%20site%29">Pločnik (archaeological site)</a> are dated to 4.650 BC. The foil are not the only tin bronze artefact from the fifth millennium BC. 14 other artefacts from <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> and <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> are dated to before 4000 BC. The recent discoveries indicate that early tin bronze was more common than previously thought, and developed independently in Europe 1500 years before the first tin bronze alloys in the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>.

The production of complex tin bronzes lasted for c. 500 years in the Balkans. Shortly before the end of the fifth millennium BC, there are no longer evidence for production of tin bronze. This coincides with the collapse of large cultural complexes in the Balkans.
Tin bronze would be reintroduced to the area again some 1500 years later.

The Aegean Bronze Age began around 3200 BC, when civilizations first established a far-ranging <a href="trade">trade</a> network. This network imported <a href="tin">tin</a> and charcoal to <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, where <a href="copper">copper</a> was mined and alloyed with the tin to produce bronze. Bronze objects were then exported far and wide, and supported the trade. <a href="Isotope">Isotopic</a> analysis of tin in some <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> bronze artifacts points to the fact that they may have originated from <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>.

Knowledge of <a href="navigation">navigation</a> was well developed at this time, and reached a peak of skill not exceeded (except perhaps by <a href="Polynesia%23Polynesian%20navigation">Polynesian</a> sailors) until 1730 when the invention of the <a href="Marine%20chronometer">chronometer</a> enabled the precise determination of <a href="longitude">longitude</a>.

The <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan civilization</a> based in <a href="Knossos">Knossos</a> on the island of <a href="Crete">Crete</a> appears to have coordinated and defended its Bronze Age trade. <a href="Illyrians">Illyrians</a> are also believed to have roots in the early Bronze Age. Ancient empires valued <a href="luxury%20good">luxury good</a>s in contrast to <a href="staple%20foods">staple foods</a>, leading to famine.

Bronze Age collapse theories have described aspects of the end of the Age in this region. At the end of the Bronze Age in the Aegean region, the <a href="Mycenaean%20Greece">Mycenaean</a> administration of the regional trade empire followed the decline of Minoan primacy. Several Minoan <a href="Client%20States">client states</a> lost much of their population to famine and/or pestilence. This would indicate that the trade network may have failed, preventing the trade that would previously have relieved such famines and prevented illness caused by malnutrition. It is also known that in this era the <a href="breadbasket">breadbasket</a> of the Minoan empire, the area north of the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, also suddenly lost much of its population, and thus probably some capacity to cultivate crops.Drought and famine in Anatolia may have also led to the Aegean Collapse by disrupting trade networks, and therefore preventing the Aegean from accessing bronze and luxury goods.

The Aegean Collapse has been attributed to the exhaustion of the <a href="Cyprus">Cypriot</a> forests causing the end of the bronze trade. These forests are known to have existed into later times, and experiments have shown that <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a> production on the scale necessary for the bronze production of the late Bronze Age would have exhausted them in less than fifty years.

The Aegean Collapse has also been attributed to the fact that as <a href="iron">iron</a> <a href="tools">tools</a> became more common, the main justification for the tin trade ended, and that trade network ceased to function as it did formerly. The colonies of the Minoan empire then suffered drought, famine, war, or some combination of those three, and had no access to the distant resources of an empire by which they could easily recover.

The <a href="Thera%20eruption">Thera eruption</a> occurred around the Aegean Collapse, north of Crete. Speculation include a <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a> from Thera (more commonly known today as Santorini) destroyed Cretan cities. A tsunami may have destroyed the Cretan <a href="navy">navy</a> in its home harbour, which then lost crucial naval battles; so that in the <a href="Minoan%20chronology">LMIB/LMII</a> event ( BC) the cities of <a href="Crete">Crete</a> burned and the <a href="Mycenaean%20civilization">Mycenaean civilization</a> took over <a href="Knossos">Knossos</a>. If the eruption occurred in the late 17th century BC (as most chronologists now think) then its immediate effects belong to the Middle to Late Bronze Age transition, and not to the end of the Late Bronze Age; but it could have triggered the instability that led to the collapse first of Knossos and then of Bronze Age society overall. One such theory looks to the role of Cretan expertise in administering the empire, post-Thera. If this expertise was concentrated in Crete, then the Mycenaeans may have made political and commercial mistakes in administering the Cretan empire.

Archaeological findings, including some on the island of Thera, suggest that the centre of Minoan Civilization at the time of the eruption was actually on Thera rather than on Crete. According to this theory, the catastrophic loss of the political, administrative and economic centre by the eruption as well as the damage wrought by the tsunami to the coastal towns and villages of Crete precipitated the decline of the Minoans. A weakened political entity with a reduced economic and military capability and fabled riches would have then been more vulnerable to human predators. Indeed, the Santorini Eruption is usually dated to BC, while the Mycenaean Greeks first enter the historical record a few decades later, BC. Thus, the later Mycenaean assaults on Crete ( BC) and Troy ( BC) are revealed as mere continuations of the steady encroachments of the Greeks upon the weakened Minoan world.

In <a href="Central%20Europe">Central Europe</a>, the early Bronze Age <a href="Unetice%20culture">Unetice culture</a> (1800–1600 BC) includes numerous smaller groups like the <a href="Straubingen%20culture">Straubing</a>, <a href="Adlerberg%20culture">Adlerberg</a> and <a href="Hatvan">Hatvan</a> cultures. Some very rich burials, such as the one located at <a href="Leubingen">Leubingen</a> with grave gifts crafted from gold, point to an increase of social stratification already present in the Unetice culture. All in all, cemeteries of this period are rare and of small size. The Unetice culture is followed by the middle Bronze Age (1600–1200 BC) <a href="Tumulus%20culture">Tumulus culture</a>, which is characterised by inhumation burials in <a href="tumuli">tumuli</a> (barrows). In the eastern <a href="Hungary">Hungarian</a> <a href="K%C3%B6r%C3%B6s%20River">Körös</a> tributaries, the early Bronze Age first saw the introduction of the <a href="Mako%20culture">Mako culture</a>, followed by the <a href="Otomani%20culture">Otomani</a> and <a href="Gyulavarsand%20culture">Gyulavarsand culture</a>s.

The late Bronze Age <a href="Urnfield">Urnfield</a> culture (1300–700 BC) is characterized by cremation burials. It includes the <a href="Lusatian%20culture">Lusatian culture</a> in eastern <a href="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="Poland">Poland</a> (1300–500 BC) that continues into the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>. The Central European Bronze Age is followed by the Iron Age <a href="Hallstatt%20culture">Hallstatt culture</a> (700–450 BC).

<a href="list%20of%20archaeological%20sites">Important sites</a> include:

The Bronze Age in Central Europe has been described in the chronological schema of German prehistorian <a href="Paul%20Reinecke">Paul Reinecke</a>. He described Bronze A1 (Bz A1) period (2300–2000 BC : triangular daggers, flat axes, stone wrist-guards, flint arrowheads) and Bronze A2 (Bz A2) period (1950–1700 BC : daggers with metal hilt, flanged axes, halberds, pins with perforated spherical heads, solid bracelets) and phases Hallstatt A and B (Ha A and B).

The <a href="Apennine%20culture">Apennine culture</a> (also called Italian Bronze Age) is a technology complex of central and southern Italy spanning the <a href="Chalcolithic">Chalcolithic</a> and Bronze Age proper. The <a href="Camuni">Camuni</a> were an ancient people of uncertain origin (according to <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, they were <a href="Euganei">Euganei</a>; according to <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>, they were <a href="Rhaetians">Rhaetians</a>) who lived in <a href="Val%20Camonica">Val Camonica</a> – in what is now northern <a href="Lombardy">Lombardy</a> – during the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>, although human groups of hunters, shepherds and farmers are known to have lived in the area since the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a>.

Located in <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a> and <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a>, the <a href="Nuragic%20civilization">Nuragic civilization</a> lasted from the early Bronze Age (18th century BC) to the 2nd century AD, when the islands were already Romanized. They take their name from the characteristic nuragic towers, which evolved from the pre-existing megalithic culture, which built <a href="dolmen">dolmen</a>s and <a href="menhir">menhir</a>s. The nuraghe towers are unanimously considered the best preserved and largest megalithic remains in Europe. Their effective use is still debated: some scholars considered them as monumental tombs, others as <a href="Giants%27%20grave">Houses of the Giants</a>, other as fortresses, ovens for metal fusion, prisons or, finally, temples for a solar cult. Around the end of the 3rd millennium BC, Sardinia exported towards Sicily a "Culture" that built small dolmens, trilithic or polygonal shaped, that served as tombs as it has been ascertained in the Sicilian dolmen of “Cava dei Servi”. From this region they reached Malta island and other countries of Mediterranean basin.

The <a href="Terramare">Terramare</a> was an early <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a> civilization in the area of what is now <a href="Pianura%20Padana">Pianura Padana</a> (northern Italy) before the arrival of the <a href="Celts">Celts</a>, and in other parts of Europe. They lived in square villages of wooden <a href="stilt%20houses">stilt houses</a>. These villages were built on land, but generally near a stream, with roads that crossed each other at <a href="right%20angles">right angles</a>. The whole complex denoted the nature of a fortified settlement. Terramare were widespread in the Pianura Padana (specially along the <a href="Panaro%20%28river%29">Panaro</a> river, between <a href="Modena">Modena</a> and <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>) and in the rest of Europe. The civilization developed in the Middle and Late Bronze Age, between the 17th and the 13th centuries BC.

The <a href="Castellieri%20culture">Castellieri culture</a> developed in <a href="Istria">Istria</a> during the Middle Bronze Age. It lasted for more than a millennium, from the 15th century BC until the Roman conquest in the 3rd century BC. It takes its name from the fortified boroughs ("Castellieri", <a href="Friulian%20language">Friulian</a> "cjastelir") that characterized the culture.

The <a href="Canegrate%20culture">Canegrate culture</a> developed from the mid-Bronze Age (13th century BC) till the Iron Age in the <a href="Pianura%20Padana">Pianura Padana</a>, in what are now western <a href="Lombardy">Lombardy</a>, eastern <a href="Piedmont">Piedmont</a> and <a href="Canton%20Ticino">Ticino</a>. It takes its name from the township of <a href="Canegrate">Canegrate</a> where, in the 20th century, some fifty tombs with ceramics and metal objects were found. The Canegrate culture migrated from the northwest part of the Alps and descended to <a href="Pianura%20Padana">Pianura Padana</a> from the Swiss Alps passes and the Ticino.

The <a href="Golasecca%20culture">Golasecca culture</a> developed starting from the late Bronze Age in the <a href="Po%20plain">Po plain</a>. It takes its name from Golasecca, a locality next to the <a href="Ticino">Ticino</a> where, in the early 19th century, abbot Giovanni Battista Giani excavated its first findings (some fifty tombs with ceramics and metal objects). Remains of the Golasecca culture span an area of c. 20,000 square kilometers south to the Alps, between the Po, <a href="Sesia">Sesia</a> and <a href="Serio%20%28river%29">Serio</a> rivers, dating from the 9th to the 4th century BC.

The <a href="Atlantic%20Bronze%20Age">Atlantic Bronze Age</a> is a cultural complex of the period of approximately 1300–700 BC that includes different cultures in Portugal, Andalusia, Galicia and the British Isles. It is marked by economic and cultural exchange. Commercial contacts extend to Denmark and the Mediterranean. The Atlantic Bronze Age was defined by a number of distinct regional centres of metal production, unified by a regular maritime exchange of some of their products.

In <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>, the Bronze Age is considered to have been the period from around 2100 to 750 BC. <a href="Human%20migration">Migration</a> brought new people to the islands from the continent. Recent tooth enamel isotope research on bodies found in early Bronze Age graves around <a href="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> indicate that at least some of the migrants came from the area of modern <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. Another example site is Must Farm, near Whittlesey, which has recently been host to the most complete Bronze Age wheel ever to be found. The <a href="Beaker%20culture">Beaker culture</a> displayed different behaviours from the earlier <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> people, and cultural change was significant. Integration is thought to have been peaceful, as many of the early <a href="henge">henge</a> sites were seemingly adopted by the newcomers. The rich <a href="Wessex%20culture">Wessex culture</a> developed in southern Britain at this time. Additionally, the climate was deteriorating; where once the weather was warm and dry it became much wetter as the Bronze Age continued, forcing the population away from easily defended sites in the hills and into the fertile <a href="valley">valley</a>s. Large livestock farms developed in the lowlands and appear to have contributed to economic growth and inspired increasing forest clearances. The <a href="Deverel-Rimbury%20culture">Deverel-Rimbury culture</a> began to emerge in the second half of the Middle Bronze Age ( –1100 BC) to exploit these conditions. <a href="Devon">Devon</a> and <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> were major sources of <a href="tin">tin</a> for much of western Europe and <a href="copper">copper</a> was extracted from sites such as the <a href="Great%20Orme">Great Orme</a> mine in northern <a href="Wales">Wales</a>. Social groups appear to have been tribal but with growing complexity and hierarchies becoming apparent.

The burial of the dead (which, until this period, had usually been communal) became more individual. For example, whereas in the Neolithic a large <a href="chambered%20cairn">chambered cairn</a> or <a href="long%20barrow">long barrow</a> housed the dead, Early Bronze Age people buried their dead in individual <a href="tumulus">barrows</a> (also commonly known and marked on modern British <a href="Ordnance%20Survey">Ordnance Survey</a> maps as tumuli), or sometimes in <a href="cist">cist</a>s covered with <a href="cairn">cairn</a>s.

The greatest quantities of bronze objects in <a href="England">England</a> were discovered in <a href="East%20Cambridgeshire">East Cambridgeshire</a>, where the most important finds were recovered in <a href="Isleham">Isleham</a> (more than <a href="Isleham%20Hoard">6500 pieces</a>).
Alloying of copper with zinc or tin to make <a href="brass">brass</a> or <a href="bronze">bronze</a> was practised soon after the discovery of copper itself. One copper mine at <a href="Great%20Orme">Great Orme</a> in North Wales, extended to a depth of 70 meters. At <a href="Alderley%20Edge">Alderley Edge</a> in <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, carbon dates have established mining at around 2280 to 1890 BC (at 95% probability). The earliest identified <a href="metalworking">metalworking</a> site (Sigwells, Somerset) is much later, dated by Globular Urn style pottery to approximately the 12th century BC. The identifiable sherds from over 500 mould fragments included a perfect fit of the hilt of a sword in the Wilburton style held in Somerset County Museum.

The <a href="Bronze%20Age%20in%20Ireland">Bronze Age in Ireland</a> commenced around 2000 BC, when copper was alloyed with tin and used to manufacture <a href="Ballybeg">Ballybeg</a> type flat axes and associated metalwork. The preceding period is known as the <a href="Copper%20Age">Copper Age</a> and is characterised by the production of <a href="flat%20axes">flat axes</a>, <a href="daggers">daggers</a>, <a href="halberds">halberds</a> and <a href="stitching%20awl">awls</a> in copper. The period is divided into three phases: <a href="Early%20Bronze%20Age">Early Bronze Age</a> (2000–1500 BC), <a href="Middle%20Bronze%20Age">Middle Bronze Age</a> (1500–1200 BC), and <a href="Late%20Bronze%20Age">Late Bronze Age</a> (1200 – BC). Ireland is also known for a relatively large number of Early Bronze Age burials.

One of the characteristic types of artifact of the Early Bronze Age in Ireland is the <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20130103003030/http%3A//www.metal-detecting.info/bronze-age-flat-axe.html">flat axe</a>. There are five main types of flat axes: <a href="Lough%20Ravel">Lough Ravel</a> ( BC), Ballybeg ( BC), <a href="Killaha">Killaha</a> ( BC), <a href="Ballyvalley">Ballyvalley</a> ( –1600 BC), <a href="Derryniggin">Derryniggin</a> ( BC), and a number of metal ingots in the shape of axes.

The Bronze Age in Northern Europe spans the entire <a href="2nd%20millennium%20BC">2nd millennium BC</a> (<a href="Unetice%20culture">Unetice culture</a>, <a href="Urnfield%20culture">Urnfield culture</a>, <a href="Tumulus%20culture">Tumulus culture</a>, <a href="Terramare%20culture">Terramare culture</a>, <a href="Lusatian%20culture">Lusatian culture</a>) lasting until BC. The <a href="Nordic%20Bronze%20Age">Northern Bronze Age</a> was both a period and a Bronze Age culture in Scandinavian pre-history, –500 BC, with sites that reached as far east as Estonia. Succeeding the Late Neolithic culture, its ethnic and linguistic affinities are unknown in the absence of written sources. It is followed by the <a href="Pre-Roman%20Iron%20Age">Pre-Roman Iron Age</a>.

Even though Northern European Bronze Age cultures were relatively late, and came into existence via trade, sites present rich and well-preserved objects made of wool, wood and imported Central European bronze and gold. Many rock carvings depict ships, and the large stone burial monuments known as stone ships suggest that shipping played an important role. Thousands of rock carvings depict ships, most probably representing sewn plank built canoes for warfare, fishing and trade. These may have a history as far back as the neolithic period and continue into the Pre-Roman Iron Age, as shown by the <a href="Hjortspring%20boat">Hjortspring boat</a>. There are many mounds and rock carving sites from the period. Numerous artifacts of bronze and gold are found. No written language existed in the Nordic countries during the Bronze Age. The rock carvings have been dated through comparison with depicted artifacts.

<a href="Arsenical%20bronze">Arsenical bronze</a> artifacts of the <a href="Maykop%20culture">Maykop culture</a> in the <a href="North%20Caucasus">North Caucasus</a> have been dated around the 4th millennium BC. This innovation resulted in the circulation of arsenical bronze technology over southern and eastern Europe.

The <a href="Yamna%20culture">Yamna culture</a> is a Late Copper Age/Early Bronze Age culture of the Southern Bug/Dniester/Ural region (the Pontic steppe), dating to the 36th–23rd centuries BC. The name also appears in English as Pit-Grave Culture or Ochre-Grave Culture. The <a href="Catacomb%20culture">Catacomb culture</a>, –2200 BC, comprises several related Early Bronze Age cultures occupying what is presently Ukraine. The <a href="Srubna%20culture">Srubna culture</a> was a Late Bronze Age (18th–12th centuries BC) culture. It is a successor to the Yamna and the Poltavka culture.

Iron and copper smelting appeared around the same time in most parts of Africa. As such, most <a href="Classical%20African%20Civilization">African civilizations</a> outside of Egypt did not experience a distinct Bronze Age. Evidence for iron smelting appears earlier or at the same time as copper smelting in <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> circa 900–800 BC, <a href="Rwanda">Rwanda</a> and <a href="Burundi">Burundi</a> circa 700–500 BC and <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a> circa 300 BC.

There is a longstanding debate about whether the development of both copper and iron metallurgy were independently developed in sub-Saharan Africa or were introduced from the outside across the Sahara Desert from North Africa or from the Indian Ocean. Evidence for theories of independent development and for outside introduction are scarce and subject to active scholarly debate. Scholars have suggested that both the relative dearth of archeological research in sub-Saharan Africa as well as long standing prejudices have limited or biased our understanding of pre-historic metallurgy on the continent. One scholar characterized the state of historical knowledge as such: “To say that the history of metallurgy in sub-Saharan Africa is complicated is perhaps an understatement.”

The Bronze Age in <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>, started as early as 2300 BC. Copper smelting was introduced by Egyptians to the Nubian city of <a href="Mero%C3%AB">Meroë</a>, in modern-day <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a>, around 2600 BC. A furnace for bronze casting has been found in <a href="Kerma">Kerma</a> that is dated to 2300–1900 BC.

Copper smelting took place in West Africa prior to the appearance of iron smelting in the region. Evidence for copper smelting furnaces was found near <a href="Agadez">Agadez</a>, Niger that hasbeen dated as early as 2200 BC. However, evidence for copper production in this region before 1000 BC is debated. Evidence of copper mining and smelting has been founded at <a href="Akjoujt">Akjoujt</a>, <a href="Mauretania">Mauretania</a> that suggests small scale production to 400 BC.

The <a href="Moche%20culture">Moche</a> civilization of <a href="South%20America">South America</a> independently discovered and developed bronze smelting. Bronze technology was developed further by the Incas and used widely both for utilitarian objects and sculpture. A later appearance of limited bronze smelting in West <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> (see <a href="Metallurgy%20in%20pre-Columbian%20Mesoamerica">Metallurgy in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica</a>) suggests either contact of that region with <a href="Andean%20civilizations">Andean cultures</a> or separate discovery of the technology. The <a href="Calchaqu%C3%AD">Calchaquí</a> people of Northwest <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> had bronze technology.

The <a href="J%C5%8Dmon%20period">Jōmon period</a> lasted until 300 BC and, towards the end of the period, the Japanese archipelago experienced the introduction of bronze and iron simultaneously. Bronze and iron smelting techniques spread to the Japanese archipelago through immigration and trade from the Korean peninsula and the Chinese mainland. Iron was mainly used for agricultural and other tools, whereas ritual and ceremonial artifacts were mainly made of bronze. Formerly, scholarly theories suggested that a bronze- and iron-using <a href="Yamato%20people">Yamato people</a> gradually spread across the Japanese archipelago, conquering and assimilating the Jōmon people and their descendants, as well as pushing them east and north. Current archaeology suggests a more complex picture of the "Jōmon-Yayoi transition," including as regards ethnic categories; see the article on <a href="Yayoi%20people">Yayoi people</a>.

Trade played a major role in the development of the ancient Bronze Age civilizations. With artifacts of the <a href="Indus%20Valley%20Civilization">Indus Valley Civilization</a> being found in ancient <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, it is clear that these civilizations were not only in touch with each other but also trading with each other. Early long distance trade was limited almost exclusively to luxury goods like spices, textiles and precious metals. Not only did this make cities with ample amounts of these products extremely rich but also led to an inter-mingling of cultures for the first time in history. 

Trade routes were not only over land but also over water. The first and most extensive trade routes were over rivers such as the <a href="Nile">Nile</a>, the <a href="Tigris">Tigris</a> and the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a> which led to growth of cities on the banks of these rivers. The domestication of camels at a later time also helped encourage trade routes over land, which were called caravans, and linked Indus Valley with the Mediterranean. This further led to towns sprouting up in numbers any and everywhere there was a pit-stop or caravan-to-ship port.

BBC News (TV channel)

BBC News (also known as the BBC News Channel) is the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s 24-hour rolling news television network in the United Kingdom. The channel launched as BBC News 24 on 9 November 1997 at 17:30 as part of the BBC's foray into digital domestic television channels, becoming the first competitor to <a href="Sky%20News">Sky News</a>, which had been running since 1989. For a time, looped news, sport and weather bulletins were available to view via <a href="BBC%20Red%20Button">BBC Red Button</a>.

On 22 February 2006, the channel was named "News Channel of the Year" at the Royal Television Society Television Journalism Awards for the first time in its history. The judges remarked that this was the year that the channel had "really come into its own."

From May 2007, UK viewers could watch the channel via the BBC News website. In April 2008, the channel was renamed "BBC News" as part of a £550,000 rebranding of the BBC's news output, complete with a new studio and presentation. Its sister service, BBC World was also renamed "<a href="BBC%20World%20News">BBC World News</a>" while the national news bulletins became "BBC News at One", "BBC News at Six" and "BBC News at Ten". Across the day the channel averages about twice the audience of Sky News.

As a major part of the <a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a> department, the channel is based at and broadcast from <a href="Broadcasting%20House">Broadcasting House</a> in Central London.

It was named <a href="Royal%20Television%20Society">RTS</a> "News Channel of the Year" in 2017.

BBC News 24 was originally available to digital terrestrial, satellite and cable television subscribers. To this day, it and <a href="BBC%20Parliament">BBC Parliament</a> remain the only BBC "digital" channels which are made available to analogue cable subscribers. This coverage was improved in 1998 with the advent of <a href="digital%20television">digital television</a> in the United Kingdom allowing <a href="satellite">satellite</a> and <a href="digital%20terrestrial%20television">digital terrestrial television</a> viewers to also view the service. Initially it was difficult to obtain a digital satellite or terrestrial receiver without a subscription to Sky or <a href="ITV%20Digital">ONdigital</a> respectively, but now the channel forms an important part of the <a href="Freeview%20%28UK%29">Freeview</a> and <a href="Freesat">Freesat</a> channel packages.

The BBC had run the international news channel <a href="BBC%20World%20News">BBC World</a> for two and a half years prior to the launch of BBC News 24 on 9 November 1997. <a href="Sky%20News">Sky News</a> had had a free hand with domestic news for over eight years (since 5 February 1989) and being owned by <a href="News%20Corporation">News Corporation</a> their papers were used to criticise the BBC for extending its news output.

<a href="Sky%20News">Sky News</a> objected to the breaking of its monopoly, complaining about the costs associated with running a channel that only a minority could view from the <a href="Television%20licence">licence fee</a>. Sky News claimed that a number of British cable operators had been incentivised to carry News 24 (which, as a licence-fee funded channel was made available to such operators for free) in preference to the commercial Sky News. However, in September 1999 the <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a> ruled against a complaint made by Sky News that the publicly funded channel was unfair and illegal under EU law. The Commission ruled that the <a href="Television%20licence">licence fee</a> should be considered state aid but that such aid was justified due to the public service remit of the BBC and that it did not exceed actual costs.

The channel's journalistic output has been overseen by Controller of the channel, <a href="Kevin%20Bakhurst">Kevin Bakhurst</a>, since 16 December 2005. This was a return to having a dedicated Controller for the channel in the same way as the rest of the BBC's domestic television channels. At launch, Tim Orchard was Controller of News 24 from 1997 until 2000. Editorial decisions were then overseen by Rachel Atwell in her capacity as Deputy Head of television news. Her deputy Mark Popescu became responsible for editorial content in 2004, a role he continued in until the appointment of Bakhurst as Controller in 2005.

A further announcement by Head of television news <a href="Peter%20Horrocks">Peter Horrocks</a> came at the same time as Bakhurst's appointment in which he outlined his plan to provide more funding and resources for the channel and shift the corporation's emphasis regarding news away from the traditional BBC One bulletins and across to the rolling news channel. The introduction of simulcasts of the main bulletins on the channel was to allow the news bulletins to pool resources rather than work against each other at key times in the face of competition particularly from Sky News.

The <a href="Board%20of%20Governors%20of%20the%20BBC">BBC Governors</a>' annual report for 2005/2006 reported that average audience figures for fifteen-minute periods had reached 8.6% in multichannel homes, up from 7.8% in 2004/2005. The 2004 report claimed that the channel outperformed Sky News in both weekly and monthly reach in multichannel homes for the January 2004 period, and for the first time in two years moved ahead of Sky News in being perceived as the channel best for news.

On 21 April 2008, BBC News 24 was renamed "BBC News" on the channel itself – but is referred to as the "BBC News Channel" on other BBC services. This is part of the creative futures plan, launched in 2006, to bring all BBC News output under the single brand name.

The BBC News Channel moved from the Studio N8 set, which became home to BBC World News, to what was the home of the national news in Studio N6, allowing the channel to share its set with the "<a href="BBC%20News%20at%20One">BBC News at One</a>" and the "<a href="BBC%20News%20at%20Ten">BBC News at Ten</a>" – with other bulletins moving to Studio TC7.

The channel relocated, along with the remaining BBC News services at Television Centre, to the newly refurbished Broadcasting House on 18 March 2013 at 13:00 GMT. Presentation and on-screen graphics were refreshed, with new full HD studios and a live newsroom backdrop. Moving cameras in the newsroom form part of the top of the hour title sequence and are used at the start of weather bulletins.

On 16 July 2013, the BBC announced that a <a href="High-definition%20television">high-definition</a> (HD) <a href="simulcast">simulcast</a> of BBC News would be launched by early 2014. The channel broadcasts on the BBC's new HD multiplex on Freeview. HD output from BBC News has been simulcast on BBC One HD and BBC Two HD since the move to Broadcasting House in March 2013. The channel launched on 10 December 2013 (at an early date), though will roll-out nationwide up to June 2014 (as will <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four HD</a> and <a href="CBeebies">CBeebies HD</a>).

Each hour consists of headlines on each quarter-hour, extended at the top of the hour to form the main part of the daily schedule though these are interspaced with other programmes, generally at weekends. This will be often be displaced by rolling news coverage including reports and live interviews. This channel also provides half-hourly weather summaries by forecasters from the <a href="BBC%20Weather">BBC Weather</a> centre and the sports news from the BBC Sport centre at MediaCityUK. At 21:25 a global weather forecast is broadcast and 21:55 "Weather for the Week Ahead" is broadcast.

The BBC maintains guidelines for procedures to be taken for <a href="breaking%20news">breaking news</a>. With domestic news, the correspondent first recorded a "generic minute" summary (for use by all stations and channels) and then priority was to report on <a href="BBC%20Radio%205%20Live">BBC Radio 5 Live</a>, then on the BBC News channel and any other programmes that are on air. Since 5 Live's move to Manchester, this has been reversed. For foreign news, first a "generic minute" is recorded, then reports are to <a href="BBC%20World%20Service">World Service</a> radio, then the reporter talks to any other programmes that are on air.

A key claim made by Lord Lambert in his report had been that the channel was slower to react to breaking news compared with its main rival Sky News. To counteract this, a new feature introduced with the 2003 relaunch was a 'breaking news sting': a globe shown briefly onscreen to direct a viewer's attention to the breaking news.

The graphics relaunch in January 2007 has since seen the globe sting replaced by a red strapline to highlight the breaking story immediately.

To complement this, a permanent live news ticker had earlier been introduced in 2006: this had previously been in use only sporadically. News statements are shown as continuously scrolling upper-case text located at the bottom of the screen; some past ambiguities noted have included spelling the plural of MPs as "MPS", together with other occasional spelling and grammatical errors. The design of this ticker was slightly altered with the 2007 graphics redesign and from June turned red to indicate breaking news, as "<a href="Newswatch%20%28BBC%29">Newswatch</a>" reported viewers' confusion. The ticker is removed during trails and weather forecasts.

The BBC began <a href="simulcast">simulcast</a>ing the channel overnight on <a href="Terrestrial%20television">terrestrial</a> channel BBC One with the launch of the channel, ending the tradition of a closedown but at the same time effectively making the service available to many more viewers. In the early 2000s, BBC Two also started simulcasting the channel, although the weekend morning show "Weekend 24" had been simulcast on the channel in the early days. During major breaking news events, the BBC News Channel has been broadcast on BBC One; examples of special broadcasts include the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">11 September 2001 attacks</a>, <a href="7%20July%202005%20London%20bombings">7 July 2005 London bombings</a>, <a href="Operation%20Red%20Dawn">the capture of Saddam Hussein</a>, and the <a href="death%20of%20Osama%20bin%20Laden">death of Osama bin Laden</a>. Coverage of major events has also been simulcast on BBC World News. Currently, overnight viewers receive 25-minute editions of BBC News every hour, and on weekdays 00:00–01:30 receive "<a href="Newsday%20%28programme%29">Newsday</a>", live from Singapore and from London 01:30–02:00 "<a href="ABC%20World%20News%20Tonight">ABC World News Tonight</a>" 02:00–05:30 (00:00–06:00 on weekends) receive "<a href="BBC%20World%20News%20%28programme%29">BBC World News</a>".

"<a href="BBC%20Breakfast">BBC Breakfast</a>" has been simulcast since launch (in 2000) on <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> and BBC News, replacing the individual breakfast shows that had run on both channels. Since May 2006, the simulcast runs from 06:00 until 08:30. "Breakfast" on BBC One then continues from <a href="MediaCityUK">MediaCityUK</a> until 09:15 with entertainment and features, whilst <a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a> goes to <a href="BBC%20Business%20Live">BBC Business Live</a> until 09:00 and reverts to its traditional format from 09:00.

The "<a href="BBC%20News%20at%20Ten">BBC News at Ten</a>" began simulcasting on the channel on 30 January 2006 as part of the "Ten O'Clock Newshour", followed by extended sport and business news updates. The bulletin was joined in being simulcast on 10 April 2006 when the "<a href="BBC%20News%20at%20One">BBC News at One</a>" (with <a href="British%20Sign%20Language">British Sign Language</a> in-vision signing) and "<a href="BBC%20News%20at%20Six">BBC News at Six</a>" bulletins were added to the schedule following a similar format to the "News at Ten" in terms of content on the channel once each simulcast ends.

During the summer, the hour-long programme "News 24 Sunday" was broadcast both on BBC One and the BBC News Channel at 09:00, to replace "<a href="The%20Andrew%20Marr%20Show">The Andrew Marr Show</a>", which is off air. It was presented by a news presenter, and came from the main News channel studio. The programme was made up mostly of interviews focusing on current affairs, and included a full paper review, a weather summary, and a news update at 09:00, 09:30 and 10:00. "<a href="Sunday%20Morning%20Live%20%28BBC%29">Sunday Morning Live</a>" and alternate programming now fill this slot.

From 2013, a new programme was created for <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> for 11am-12pm weekdays, consisting of 30 minutes domestic and 30 minutes of BBC World News. On Wednesdays, when parliament is sitting the latter is replaced by the <a href="Daily%20Politics">Daily Politics</a> for coverage of <a href="Prime%20Ministers%20Questions">Prime Ministers Questions</a>. In March 2016 the channel started showing Newsnight at 23:15.


Pre-recorded programmes include:

Previous BBC News programming includes "Head 2 Head", "<a href="Your%20News">Your News</a>", "E24", "The Record Europe", "<a href="STORYFix">STORYFix</a>" and "News 24 Tonight", a weekday evening programme which ran from 2005 to 2008, providing a round up of the day's news.

As part of budget cuts, major changes to the channel were announced in late 2014/early 2015. This included axing some bulletins and replacing them with "<a href="Victoria%20Derbyshire%20%28TV%20programme%29">Victoria Derbyshire</a>" and "<a href="BBC%20Business%20Live">BBC Business Live</a>" with Sally Bundock and Ben Thompson in the morning. "<a href="Outside%20Source">Outside Source</a> with <a href="Ros%20Atkins">Ros Atkins</a>" – an "interactive" show already broadcast on BBC World News – aired Mondays-Thursday at (During major stories 18:00) and 21:00 and a new edition of "<a href="World%20News%20Today">World News Today</a>" Friday-Sunday at 21:00 (During major stories 19:00/20:00 Monday-Friday) adding to the 19:00 edition on <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a>. "<a href="HARDtalk">HARDtalk</a>" was moved to 20:30 in May. The 00:00 edition was replaced on Sundays-Thursday with "<a href="Newsday%20%28programme%29">Newsday</a>" and on Friday-Saturday a standard edition of "<a href="BBC%20World%20News">BBC World News</a>".

Between 00:00-06:00 (weekdays) UK time, the channel simulcasts with its sister channel, BBC World News, for the first 25 minutes of each hour with world news shown all through the simulcasts. Previously UK output continued until 01:00.

Simulcasts may also happen during major or set-piece events; the News Channel presenter will join the BBC World News presenter in Studio C as it used by both channels, or a journalist will present on location. Examples include the <a href="2013%20Glasgow%20helicopter%20crash">Glasgow helicopter crash</a>, the <a href="Papal%20conclave%2C%202013">election of Pope Francis</a> and the <a href="Boston%20Marathon%20bombing">Boston Marathon bombing</a> and certain elections.

On 1 October 2007, BBC World News started broadcasting "<a href="BBC%20World%20News%20America">BBC World News America</a>" and "<a href="World%20News%20Today">World News Today</a>" at 00:00 and 03:00 GMT respectively. "World News Today" was simulcast on the BBC News channel at 03:00 GMT. "BBC World News America" used to be aired as a reduced length, <a href="Time%20shifting">time-delay</a>ed version at 00:30 GMT, with "<a href="ABC%20World%20News%20Tonight">ABC World News Tonight</a> with <a href="David%20Muir">David Muir</a>" also being shown at 01:30 every Tuesday-Friday.

From 13 June 2011, the weekday editions of <a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a> at 01:00, 02:00, 03:00 and 04:00 were replaced with "<a href="Newsday%20%28programme%29">Newsday</a>". The programme acts as a morning news bulletin for the <a href="Asia-Pacific">Asia-Pacific</a> region and is broadcast as a double-headed news bulletin with <a href="Rico%20Hizon">Rico Hizon</a> in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> and <a href="Babita%20Sharma">Babita Sharma</a> in London. "Asia Business Report" and "<a href="Sport%20Today">Sport Today</a>" are aired at the back of the first three hours of "Newsday". But Newsday changed to 23:00–02:00 on BBC News a year later meaning. <a href="Mike%20Embley">Mike Embley</a> presents Tuesday-Friday "BBC World News" 23:00–02:00 with <a href="Kasia%20Madera">Kasia Madera</a> on Saturdays and Daniela Ritorto 00:00–06:00 Sunday, 02:00–05:00 Friday/Monday. the slot's focus is placed on audiences watching on PBS in the US in June 2015 this was changed to Newsday at 00:00-02:00. "BBC World News" and "World Business Report" air at 05:00 this was previously known as "The World Today" on both channels and in lieu of commercials seen on the international broadcasts, the presenters give a brief update on UK news for domestic audiences.

In June 2015, BBC News began simulcasting "Outside Source with Ros Atkins" on Mondays-Thursday at (During major stories 18:00) / at 21:00 and a new edition of "World News Today" Friday-Sunday at (during major stories Monday-Friday 19:00) 21:00.

Traditionally, during simulcasts in December, care has been taken to conceal the newsroom Christmas tree for international audiences.

Since 5 March 2012, sports bulletins come from the "BBC Sport Centre" in <a href="MediaCityUK">MediaCityUK</a> in <a href="Salford%20Quays">Salford Quays</a>, where the sports network <a href="BBC%20Radio%205%20Live">BBC Radio 5 Live</a> is also based.

Headlines are usually provided at 15 minutes past the hour with a full bulletin after the bottom-of-the-hour headlines. There are also extended sports bulletins per day, entitled "Sportsday" or "Sport Today" (when simulcasting with BBC World News) broadcast at 00:45, 01:45, 02:45, 03:45, 13:30, 18:30, 19:30 (weekends only), 22:30 (weekdays only). Each bulletin is read by a single sports presenter, with the exception of Saturday "Sportsday", which is double headed.

The channel's sports bulletins (internally known as Sport 24) have always had a separate, dedicated production gallery, which is also responsible for the graphics.

Bulletins during <a href="BBC%20Breakfast">BBC Breakfast</a> are presented by <a href="Sally%20Nugent">Sally Nugent</a> or <a href="Mike%20Bushell">Mike Bushell</a>, with the latter also appearing on other sports bulletins on the channel. As of March 2012 the main sports presenters on the channel are Olly Foster, Katie Gornall, <a href="Katherine%20Downes">Katherine Downes</a>, <a href="Damian%20Johnson%20%28broadcaster%29">Damian Johnson</a>, Andrew Lindsay and Jenny Culshaw.

Until March 2012 bulletins came from the News Channel studio at the quarter to the hour. Presenters for bulletins on the channel have included: Reshmin Choudhury, <a href="Amanda%20Davies">Amanda Davies</a>, <a href="Sean%20Fletcher">Sean Fletcher</a>, Olly Foster, Matt Gooderick, <a href="Lizzie%20Greenwood-Hughes">Lizzie Greenwood-Hughes</a>, Amelia Harris, <a href="Celina%20Hinchcliffe">Celina Hinchcliffe</a>, <a href="Rachael%20Hodges">Rachael Hodges</a>, <a href="Damian%20Johnson%20%28broadcaster%29">Damian Johnson</a>, <a href="Adnan%20Nawaz">Adnan Nawaz</a>, George Riley and Olympic gold medallist turned journalist <a href="Matthew%20Pinsent">Matthew Pinsent</a>.

Before BBC News moved to Broadcasting House, an hourly business update was included during the weekday schedule from the BBC Business Unit. There were two shifts, from 08:30–14:00 and 14:00–23:00, presented by Penny Haslam, <a href="Maryam%20Moshiri">Maryam Moshiri</a>, Ben Thompson, <a href="Adam%20Parsons">Adam Parsons</a>, <a href="Susannah%20Streeter">Susannah Streeter</a>, <a href="Joe%20Lynam">Joe Lynam</a>, Sara Coburn or Sally Eden. News Channel updates were usually broadcast at 40 minutes past the hour between 08:00 and 23:00. The 21:40 round-up was often earlier and the 22:40 bulletin is an extended round-up of the day's business news. Until May 2009, the business updates on the BBC News Channel were broadcast from one of the <a href="London%20Stock%20Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a>'s studios in central London. From then until March 2013 the bulletins were provided from the channel's studio at <a href="BBC%20Television%20Centre">BBC Television Centre</a>. The business updates were axed in March 2013 as part of the BBC's Delivering Quality First plan. But after complaints returned in November 2013. Stock market updates now only appear during the quarter-to-the-hour headlines, but it was changed after complaints in November with Ben Thompson and Victoria Friz are the main presenters sharing 08:00–14:00 or 14:00–18:00 between them. With <a href="Juliette%20Foster">Juliette Foster</a>, <a href="Adam%20Parsons">Adam Parsons</a>, Alice Baxter, Jamie Robertson, <a href="Aaron%20Heslehurst">Aaron Heslehurst</a> and <a href="Sally%20Bundock">Sally Bundock</a> offer relief. Bundock and Thompson present "Business Live" on weekdays at 08:30. Declan Curry presented "Your Money", a weekly round-up on a Saturday morning.

<a href="Rico%20Hizon">Rico Hizon</a> or <a href="Sharanjit%20Leyl">Sharanjit Leyl</a> regularly present the main business stories during the early hours of the morning from Singapore during the BBC's "<a href="Asia%20Business%20Report">Asia Business Report</a>", which is simulcast from BBC World News. Alice Baxter and <a href="Sally%20Bundock">Sally Bundock</a> present "<a href="World%20Business%20Report">World Business Report</a>".

These programmes are simulcast with <a href="BBC%20World%20News">BBC World News</a> and either <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> or <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a>. Madera, <a href="Ben%20Bland">Ben Bland</a> and <a href="Mike%20Embley">Mike Embley</a> regularly present 02:00–05:00 weekdays and weekends.

Komla Dumor died suddenly on 18 January 2014 of a heart attack. Martine Dennis left the BBC to join Al Jazeera English in March 2014

The simulcasting of the main national news bulletins has led to the presenters of those bulletins appearing on the channel and offer relief on the news channel including Huw Edwards, <a href="Victoria%20Derbyshire">Victoria Derbyshire</a>, <a href="Fiona%20Bruce">Fiona Bruce</a>, <a href="George%20Alagiah">George Alagiah</a>, <a href="Sophie%20Raworth">Sophie Raworth</a>, <a href="Kate%20Silverton">Kate Silverton</a> and <a href="Mishal%20Husain">Mishal Husain</a>.

During a major news event one or more of the main news presenters may be sent to present live for the channel from the scene of the story, where they will conduct interviews with the people involved, question correspondents, introduce related reports and also give general information on the story, much as a reporter sent to cover a story would. The presenters often have expertise in the story they are sent to cover, for example channel presenters and former reporters Ben Brown and Clive Myrie were dispatched to <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> and <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> during the Middle East uprisings.

The channel was criticised at launch for its style of presentation, with accusations of it being less authoritative than the BBC One news bulletins, with presenters appearing on-screen without jackets. <a href="Jenny%20Abramsky">Jenny Abramsky</a> had originally planned to have a television version of the informal news radio channel <a href="BBC%20Radio%205%20Live">BBC Radio 5 Live</a>, or a TV version of <a href="Radio%204%20News%20FM">Radio 4 News FM</a> both of which she had run. The bright design of the set was also blamed for this – one insider reportedly described it as a "car crash in a shower" – and was subject to the network relaunch on 25 October 1999. The channel swapped studios with sister channel BBC World, moving to studio N8 within the newsroom, where it remained until 2008. New music and title sequences accompanied this set change, following the look of newly relaunched BBC One bulletins.

Graphics and titles were developed by the <a href="Lambie-Nairn">Lambie-Nairn</a> design agency and were gradually rolled out across the whole of BBC News, including a similar design for regional news starting with "<a href="Newsroom%20South%20East">Newsroom South East</a>" and the three 'BBC Nations' – <a href="BBC%20Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="BBC%20Wales">Wales</a> and <a href="BBC%20Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. The similarity of main BBC News output was intended to increase the credibility of the channel as well as aiding cross-channel promotion.

A graphics relaunch in January 2007 saw the channel updated, with redesigned headline straplines, a redesigned '<a href="digital%20on-screen%20graphic">digital on-screen graphic</a>' and repositioned clock. The clock was originally placed to the left hand side of the channel name though following complaints that this could only be viewed in widescreen, it was moved to the right in February 2007. Bulletins on BBC World News and BBC One also introduced similar graphics and title sequences on the same day.

In 2008, the graphics were again relaunched, using the style introduced in 2007 and a new colour scheme.

The Lambert Report into the channel's performance in 2002 called upon News 24 to develop a better brand of its own, to allow viewers to differentiate between itself and similar channels such as <a href="Sky%20News">Sky News</a>. As a direct result of this, a brand new style across all presentation for the channel launched on 8 December 2003 at 09:00. <a href="Philip%20Hayton">Philip Hayton</a> and <a href="Anna%20Jones">Anna Jones</a> were the first two presenters on the set, the relaunch of which had been put back a week due to previous power disruptions at Television Centre where the channel was based. The new designs also featured a dynamic set of titles for the channel; the globe would begin spinning from where the main story was taking place, while the headline scrolled around in a ribbon; this was occasionally replaced by the BBC News logo. The titles concluded with a red globe surrounded by a red stylised clamshell and BBC News ribbons forming above the BBC News logo.

Bulletins on BBC One moved into a new set in January 2003 although retained the previous ivory Lambie-Nairn titles until February 2004. News 24 updated the title colours slightly to match those of BBC One bulletins in time for the 50th anniversary of BBC television news on 5 July 2004.

An important part of the channel's presentation since launch has been the top of the hour countdown sequence, since there is no presentation system with continuity announcers so the countdown provides a link to the beginning of the next hour. A similar musical device is used on <a href="BBC%20Radio%205%20Live">BBC Radio 5 Live</a>, and mirrors the <a href="BBC%20pips">pips</a> on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a>.

Previous styles have included a series of fictional flags set to music between 1997 and 1999 before the major relaunch, incorporating the new contemporary music composed by <a href="David%20Lowe%20%28television%20and%20radio%20composer%29">David Lowe</a>, and graphics developed by <a href="Lambie-Nairn">Lambie-Nairn</a>. Various images, originally ivory numbers fully animated against a deep red background, were designed to fit the pace of the channel, and the music soon gained notoriety, and was often satirised and parodied in popular culture, perhaps most famously by comic <a href="Bill%20Bailey">Bill Bailey</a> who likened the theme music to an "apocalyptic <a href="rave">rave</a>". Images of life around the UK were added in replacement later with the same music, together with footage of the newsroom and exterior of Television Centre. The 2003 relaunch saw a small change to this style with less of a metropolitan feel to the footage.

A new sequence was introduced on 28 March 2005, designed and created by <a href="Red%20Bee%20Media">Red Bee Media</a> and directed by Mark Chaudoir. The full version ran for 60 seconds, though only around 30 seconds were usually shown on air. The music was revised completely but the biggest change came in the footage used – reflecting the methods and nature of newsgathering, while a strong emphasis was placed on the BBC logo itself. Satellite dishes are shown transmitting and receiving red "data streams". In production of the countdown sequence, Clive Norman filmed images around the United Kingdom, Richard Jopson in the United States, while BBC News cameramen filmed images from <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, Beijing (<a href="Tiananmen%20Square">Tiananmen Square</a>), <a href="Bund%20of%20Shanghai">Bund of Shanghai</a>, Africa, as well as areas affected by the <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">2004 Asian tsunami</a> and others.

The sequence has since seen several remixes to the music and a change in visuals to focus more on the well-known journalists, with less footage of camera crews and production teams. Changes have also seen the channel logo included during the sequences and at the end, as well as the fonts used for the time. The conclusion of the countdown was altered in 2008 to feature the new presentation style, rather than a data stream moving in towards the camera. Also in 2008, the graphic for the countdown changed, resembling BBC One Rhythm and Movement Idents, due to the logo being in a red square in inferior-left corner.

To coincide with the move of BBC News to <a href="Broadcasting%20House%23Second%20phase">Broadcasting House</a>, on 18 March 2013 the countdown was updated again along with several other presentation elements. Three of the most striking features of the new countdown include music performed by the <a href="BBC%20Concert%20Orchestra">BBC Concert Orchestra</a>, a redesign of the "data streams" and the ending of the sequence no longer fading to the BBC News globe and logo, but instead stopping with a time-lapse shot outside the corporation's headquarters. The countdown was also extended back to 90 seconds, of which approximately 86 were seen before the first hour from Broadcasting House.

A full three-minute version of the countdown music was made available on <a href="BBC%20News%20Online">BBC News Online</a> and David Lowe's own website after a remix on 16 May 2006.

An international version of the countdown was launched on BBC World News on 5 September 2005 featuring more international content and similar music. Various changes have been made to the music and visuals since then, with presentation following the style of BBC News. The visuals in the sequence were updated on 10 May 2010. In June 2011, further imagery was added relating to recent events, including the conflict in Libya and views of outside 10 Downing Street. In January 2013, as part of the relocation of BBC News to <a href="Broadcasting%20House%23Second%20phase">Broadcasting House</a> in Central London, BBC World News received a new countdown in the same style as the BBC News Channel's updated countdown, with some minor differences.

Oddie undertook an <a href="Australia">Australia</a>n tour during June 2013 in all of the mainland states capital cities – <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> and <a href="Perth">Perth</a> – in a series of one-off shows, ""An Oldie but a Goodie"". A video message from Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden was shown during the performances. Oddie made personal appearances on both "<a href="The%20Project%20%28Australian%20TV%20program%29">The Project</a>" and "<a href="Adam%20Hills%20Tonight">Adam Hills Tonight</a>" TV shows during the tour; he also filmed a guest-programming spot for the ABC-TV's all-night music video show "<a href="Rage%20%28TV%20program%29">Rage</a>".

His then agent David Foster said: "Bill gets these bouts every two or three years where he gets down for about two weeks and recovers. He sometimes goes into hospital or takes a break or has a change of scenery to recharge his batteries." In January 2010 Oddie spoke to the media, revealing that he had in fact had two separate stays in different hospitals, only being discharged "in time for Christmas".

Oddie stated that he was planning to meet with BBC executives to discuss his return to television work.

His illness meant that Oddie did not appear in the 2009 and 2010 series of "Springwatch", although he made a guest appearance in the penultimate episode of the latter.

Oddie supports the <a href="Green%20Party%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Green Party</a>. In October 2014, on the BBC's "<a href="Sunday%20Morning%20Live%20%28BBC%29">Sunday Morning Live</a>", he stated that he wanted a limit on the number of children that British families can have, saying that he was "very often ashamed" to be British, whom he called "a terrible race".

In 2001, Oddie became the third person to decline to appear on "<a href="This%20Is%20Your%20Life%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">This Is Your Life</a>". He changed his mind a few hours later and agreed to appear on the show.

In June 2004, Oddie and <a href="Johnny%20Morris">Johnny Morris</a> were jointly profiled in the first of a three part <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> series, "<a href="The%20Way%20We%20Went%20Wild">The Way We Went Wild</a>", about television wildlife presenters. In May 2005, he received the <a href="British%20Naturalists%27%20Association">British Naturalists' Association</a>'s <a href="Peter%20Scott">Peter Scott</a> Memorial Award, from BNA president <a href="David%20Bellamy">David Bellamy</a>, "in recognition of his great contribution to our understanding of natural history and conservation." He is a recipient of the <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds%23RSPB%20Medal">RSPB Medal</a>.

On 30 June 2009, he was proposed for inclusion in the <a href="Birmingham%20Walk%20of%20Stars">Birmingham Walk of Stars</a>, with the public invited to vote.

Bill Oddie also co-wrote the Springwatch & Autumnwatch book with <a href="Kate%20Humble">Kate Humble</a> and <a href="Simon%20King%20%28television%29">Simon King</a>.

Broadway (Manhattan)

Broadway is a road in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. Broadway runs from <a href="State%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">State Street</a> at <a href="Bowling%20Green%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Bowling Green</a> for through the <a href="Borough%20%28New%20York%20City%29">borough</a> of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> and through <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a>, exiting north from the city to run an additional through the municipalities of <a href="Yonkers%2C%20New%20York">Yonkers</a>, <a href="Hastings-on-Hudson%2C%20New%20York">Hastings-On-Hudson</a>, <a href="Dobbs%20Ferry%2C%20New%20York">Dobbs Ferry</a>, <a href="Irvington%2C%20New%20York">Irvington</a>, and <a href="Tarrytown%2C%20New%20York">Tarrytown</a>, and terminating north of <a href="Sleepy%20Hollow%2C%20New%20York">Sleepy Hollow</a> in <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County</a>.

It is the oldest north–south main thoroughfare in New York City, dating to the first <a href="New%20Amsterdam">New Amsterdam</a> settlement, although most of it did not bear its current name until the late 19th century. The name "Broadway" is the English language <a href="calque">literal translation</a> of the <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> name, "<a href="wikt%3Abreed%23Dutch">Brede</a> <a href="wikt%3Aweg%23Dutch">weg</a>", and is also a very common placename element in most English towns where it is used for the principal market street.

Broadway in Manhattan is known widely as the heart of the <a href="Broadway%20theatre">American theatre industry</a>, and is used as a <a href="metonym">metonym</a> for it.

Broadway was originally the <a href="Wickquasgeck">Wickquasgeck</a> Trail, carved into the brush of Manhattan by its <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> inhabitants. Wickquasgeck means "birch-bark country" in the <a href="Algonquian%20languages">Algonquian</a> language. This trail originally snaked through swamps and rocks along the length of Manhattan Island.

Upon the arrival of the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch</a>, the trail soon became the main road through the island from "Nieuw Amsterdam" at the southern tip. The Dutch explorer and entrepreneur <a href="David%20Pietersz.%20de%20Vries">David Pietersz. de Vries</a> gives the first mention of it in his journal for the year 1642 ("the Wickquasgeck Road over which the Indians passed daily"). The Dutch named the road ""Heerestraat"". Although current street signs are simply labeled as "Broadway", in a 1776 map of New York City, Broadway is explicitly labeled "Broadway Street". In the mid-eighteenth century, part of Broadway in what is now lower Manhattan was known as "Great George Street". An 1897 City Map shows a segment of Broadway as "Kingsbridge Road" in the vicinity of what is now the George Washington Bridge. 

In the 18th century, Broadway ended at the town commons north of <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a>, where traffic continued up the <a href="East%20Side%20%28Manhattan%29">East Side</a> of the island via <a href="Eastern%20Post%20Road">Eastern Post Road</a> and the <a href="West%20Side%20%28Manhattan%29">West Side</a> via Bloomingdale Road. The western Bloomingdale Road would be widened and paved during the 19th century, and called "Western Boulevard" or "The Boulevard" north of the Grand Circle, now called <a href="Columbus%20Circle">Columbus Circle</a>. On February 14, 1899, the name "Broadway" was extended to the entire Broadway/Bloomingdale/Boulevard road.

Broadway once was a <a href="two-way%20street">two-way street</a> for its entire length. The present status, in which it runs <a href="one-way%20traffic">one-way</a> southbound south of <a href="Columbus%20Circle">Columbus Circle</a> (<a href="59th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">59th Street</a>), came about in several stages. On June 6, 1954, <a href="Seventh%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Seventh Avenue</a> became southbound and <a href="Eighth%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Eighth Avenue</a> became northbound south of Broadway. None of Broadway became one-way, but the increased southbound traffic between Columbus Circle (Eighth Avenue) and <a href="Times%20Square">Times Square</a> (Seventh Avenue) caused the city to re-stripe that section of Broadway for four southbound and two northbound lanes. Broadway became one-way from Columbus Circle south to <a href="Herald%20Square">Herald Square</a> (<a href="34th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">34th Street</a>) on March 10, 1957, in conjunction with <a href="Sixth%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Sixth Avenue</a> becoming one-way from Herald Square north to 59th Street and Seventh Avenue becoming one-way from 59th Street south to Times Square (where it crosses Broadway). On June 3, 1962, Broadway became one-way south of <a href="Canal%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Canal Street</a>, with Trinity Place and <a href="Church%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Church Street</a> carrying northbound traffic. Another change was made on November 10, 1963, when Broadway became one-way southbound from Herald Square to <a href="Madison%20Square">Madison Square</a> (<a href="23rd%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">23rd Street</a>) and <a href="Union%20Square%2C%20Manhattan">Union Square</a> (<a href="14th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">14th Street</a>) to Canal Street, and two routes – <a href="Sixth%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Sixth Avenue</a> south of Herald Square and <a href="Centre%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Centre Street</a>, <a href="Lafayette%20Street">Lafayette Street</a>, and <a href="Fourth%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Fourth Avenue</a> south of Union Square – became one-way northbound. Finally, at the same time as <a href="Madison%20Avenue">Madison Avenue</a> became one-way northbound and <a href="Fifth%20Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a> became one-way southbound, Broadway was made one-way southbound between <a href="Madison%20Square">Madison Square</a> (where Fifth Avenue crosses) and <a href="Union%20Square%2C%20Manhattan">Union Square</a> on January 14, 1966, completing its conversion south of Columbus Circle.

In 2001, a one-block section of Broadway between <a href="72nd%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">72nd Street</a> and <a href="73rd%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">73rd Street</a> at <a href="Verdi%20Square">Verdi Square</a> was reconfigured. Its easternmost lanes, which formerly hosted northbound traffic, were turned into a public park when a new subway entrance for the <a href="72nd%20Street%20%28IRT%20Broadway%E2%80%93Seventh%20Avenue%20Line%29">72nd Street</a> station was built in the exact location of these lanes. Northbound traffic on Broadway is now channeled onto <a href="Tenth%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Amsterdam Avenue</a> to 73rd Street, makes a left turn on the three-lane 73rd Street, and then a right turn on Broadway shortly afterward.

In August 2008, two traffic lanes from 42nd to 35th Streets were taken out of service and converted to public plazas. Additionally, bike lanes were added on Broadway from 42nd Street down to Union Square.

Since May 2009, the portions of Broadway through Duffy Square, Times Square, and Herald Square have been closed entirely to automobile traffic, except for cross traffic on the Streets and Avenues, as part of a traffic and pedestrianization experiment, with the pavement reserved exclusively for walkers, cyclists, and those lounging in temporary seating placed by the city. The city decided that the experiment was successful and decided to make the change permanent in February 2010. Though the anticipated benefits to traffic flow were not as large as hoped, pedestrian injuries dropped dramatically and foot traffic increased in the designated areas; the project was popular with both residents and businesses. The current portions converted into pedestrian plazas are between West 47th Street and West 42nd Street within Times and Duffy Squares, and between West 35th Street and West 33rd Street in the Herald Square area. Additionally, portions of Broadway in the Madison Square and Union Square have been dramatically narrowed, allowing ample pedestrian plazas to exist along the side of the road. 

In May 2013, the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Department%20of%20Transportation">NYCDOT</a> decided to redesign Broadway between 35th and 42nd Streets for the second time in five years, owing to poor connections between pedestrian plazas and decreased vehicular traffic. With the new redesign, the bike lane is now on the right side of the street; it was formerly on the left side adjacent to the pedestrian plazas, causing conflicts between pedestrian and bicycle traffic.

In spring 2017, as part of a capital reconstruction of Worth Square, Broadway between 24th and 25th Street was converted to a <a href="shared%20space">"shared street"</a> where through vehicles are banned and delivery vehicles are restricted to . Delivery vehicles go northbound from Fifth Avenue to 25th Street for that one block, reversing the direction of traffic and preventing vehicles from going south on Broadway south of 25th Street. The capital project expands on a 2008 initiative where part of the intersection of Broadway and Fifth Avenue was repurposed into a public plaza, simplifying that intersection. As part of the 2017 project, Worth Square was expanded, converting the adjoining block of Broadway into a "shared street."

Broadway runs the length of Manhattan Island, roughly parallel to the <a href="North%20River%20%28Hudson%20River%29">North River</a> (the portion of the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> bordering Manhattan), from <a href="Bowling%20Green%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Bowling Green</a> at the south to <a href="Inwood%2C%20Manhattan">Inwood</a> at the northern tip of the island. South of <a href="Columbus%20Circle">Columbus Circle</a>, it is a one-way southbound street. Since 2009, vehicular traffic has been banned at <a href="Times%20Square">Times Square</a> between <a href="47th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">47th</a> and <a href="42nd%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">42nd Streets</a>, and at <a href="Herald%20Square">Herald Square</a> between 35th and 33rd Streets as part of a pilot program; the right-of-way is intact and reserved for cyclists and pedestrians. From the northern shore of Manhattan, Broadway crosses <a href="Spuyten%20Duyvil%20Creek">Spuyten Duyvil Creek</a> via the <a href="Broadway%20Bridge%20%28Manhattan%29">Broadway Bridge</a> and continues through <a href="Marble%20Hill%2C%20Manhattan">Marble Hill</a> (a discontinuous portion of the borough of Manhattan) and <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a> into <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County</a>. <a href="U.S.%20Route%209%20in%20New%20York">U.S. 9</a> continues to be known as Broadway until its junction with <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20117">NY 117</a>.

The section of lower Broadway from its origin at Bowling Green to City Hall Park is the historical location for the city's <a href="ticker-tape%20parade">ticker-tape parade</a>s, and is sometimes called the "<a href="%23Canyon%20of%20Heroes">Canyon of Heroes</a>" during such events. West of Broadway, as far as <a href="Canal%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Canal Street</a>, was the city's fashionable residential area until circa 1825; landfill has more than tripled the area, and the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> shore now lies far to the west, beyond <a href="Tribeca">Tribeca</a> and <a href="Battery%20Park%20City">Battery Park City</a>.

Broadway marks the boundary between <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a> to the west and the <a href="East%20Village%2C%20Manhattan">East Village</a> to the east, passing <a href="Astor%20Place">Astor Place</a>. It is a short walk from there to <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a> near <a href="Washington%20Square%20Park">Washington Square Park</a>, which is at the foot of <a href="Fifth%20Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a>. A bend in front of <a href="Grace%20Church%20%28Manhattan%29">Grace Church</a> allegedly avoids an earlier tavern; from 10th Street it begins its long diagonal course across Manhattan, headed almost due north.

Because Broadway preceded the grid that the <a href="Commissioners%27%20Plan%20of%201811">Commissioners' Plan of 1811</a> imposed on the island, Broadway crosses <a href="midtown%20Manhattan">midtown Manhattan</a> diagonally, intersecting with both the east-west streets and north-south avenues. Broadway's intersections with avenues, marked by "<a href="town%20square">squares</a>" (some merely triangular slivers of open space), have induced some interesting architecture, such as the <a href="Flatiron%20Building">Flatiron Building</a>.

At <a href="Union%20Square%2C%20Manhattan">Union Square</a>, Broadway crosses <a href="14th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">14th Street</a>, merges with <a href="Park%20Avenue">Fourth Avenue</a>, and continues its diagonal uptown course from the Square's northwest corner; Union Square is the only location wherein the physical section of Broadway is discontinuous in Manhattan (other portions of Broadway in Manhattan are pedestrian-only plazas). At <a href="Madison%20Square">Madison Square</a>, the location of the Flatiron Building, Broadway crosses Fifth Avenue at <a href="23rd%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">23rd Street</a>, and is discontinuous to vehicles for a one-block stretch between 24th and 25th Streets. At <a href="Greeley%20Square">Greeley Square</a> (West 33rd Street), Broadway crosses <a href="Sixth%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Sixth Avenue</a> (Avenue of the Americas), and is discontinuous to vehicles. <a href="Macy%27s%20Herald%20Square">Macy's Herald Square</a> department store, one block north of the vehicular discontinuity, is located on the northwest corner of Broadway and West 34th Street and southwest corner of Broadway and West 35th Street; it is one of the largest <a href="department%20store">department store</a>s in the world.

One famous stretch near <a href="Times%20Square">Times Square</a>, where Broadway crosses Seventh Avenue in <a href="midtown%20Manhattan">midtown Manhattan</a>, is the home of many <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> <a href="theatre%20%28structure%29">theatres</a>, housing an ever-changing array of commercial, large-scale plays, particularly <a href="musical%20theatre">musicals</a>. This area of Manhattan is often called the <a href="Theater%20District%2C%20Manhattan">Theater District</a> or the Great White Way, a nickname originating in the headline "Found on the Great White Way" in the edition of February 3, 1902 of the "<a href="New%20York%20Evening%20Telegram">New York Evening Telegram</a>". The journalistic nickname was inspired by the millions of lights on theater <a href="Marquee%20%28sign%29">marquees</a> and <a href="billboard%20%28advertising%29">billboard</a> advertisements that illuminate the area. After becoming the city's de facto <a href="red-light%20district">red-light district</a> in the 1960s and 1970s (as can be seen in the films "<a href="Taxi%20Driver">Taxi Driver</a>" and "<a href="Midnight%20Cowboy">Midnight Cowboy</a>"), since the late 1980s Times Square has emerged as a family tourist center, in effect being <a href="Disneyfication">Disneyfied</a> following the company's purchase and renovation of the <a href="New%20Amsterdam%20Theatre">New Amsterdam Theatre</a> on 42nd Street in 1993.

Until June 2007, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", from which the Square gets its name, was published at offices at 239 West 43rd Street; the paper stopped printing papers there on June 15, 2007.

At the southwest corner of <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a>, Broadway crosses <a href="Eighth%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Eighth Avenue</a> (called Central Park West north of 59th Street) at <a href="59th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">West 59th Street</a> and <a href="Columbus%20Circle">Columbus Circle</a>; on the site of the former <a href="New%20York%20Coliseum">New York Coliseum</a> convention center is the new shopping center at the foot of the <a href="Time%20Warner%20Center">Time Warner Center</a>, headquarters of <a href="Time%20Warner">Time Warner</a>. From Columbus Circle northward, Broadway becomes a wide <a href="boulevard">boulevard</a> to 169th Street; it retains landscaped <a href="median%20%28road%29">center islands</a> that separate northbound from southbound traffic. The medians are a vestige of the central mall of "The Boulevard" that had become the spine of the <a href="Upper%20West%20Side">Upper West Side</a>, and many of these contain public seating.

Broadway intersects with <a href="Columbus%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Columbus Avenue</a> (known as Ninth Avenue south of <a href="59th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">West 59th Street</a>) at West 65th and 66th Streets where the <a href="Juilliard%20School">Juilliard School</a> and <a href="Lincoln%20Center">Lincoln Center</a>, both well-known performing arts landmarks, as well as the <a href="Manhattan%20New%20York%20Temple">Manhattan New York Temple</a> of <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> are located.

Between West 70th and 73rd Streets, Broadway intersects with <a href="Tenth%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Amsterdam Avenue</a> (known as 10th Avenue south of West 59th Street). The wide intersection of the two thoroughfares has historically been the site of numerous traffic accidents and pedestrian casualties, partly due to the long crosswalks. Two small triangular plots of land were created at points where Broadway slices through Amsterdam Avenue. One is a tiny fenced-in patch of shrubbery and plants at West 70th Street called <a href="Sherman%20Square">Sherman Square</a> (although it and the surrounding intersection have also been known collectively as Sherman Square), and the other triangle is a lush tree-filled garden bordering Amsterdam Avenue from just above West 72nd Street to West 73rd Street. Named <a href="Verdi%20Square">Verdi Square</a> in 1921 for its monument to Italian composer <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Giuseppe Verdi</a>, which was erected in 1909, this triangular sliver of public space was designated a Scenic Landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1974, one of nine city parks that have received the designation. In the 1960s and 1970s, the area surrounding both Verdi Square and Sherman Square was known by local drug users and dealers as "Needle Park", and was featured prominently in the gritty 1971 dramatic film "<a href="The%20Panic%20in%20Needle%20Park">The Panic in Needle Park</a>", directed by <a href="Jerry%20Schatzberg">Jerry Schatzberg</a> and starring <a href="Al%20Pacino">Al Pacino</a> in his second onscreen role.

The original brick and stone shelter leading to the entrance of the <a href="72nd%20Street%20%28IRT%20Broadway%20%E2%80%93%20Seventh%20Avenue%20Line%29">72nd Street</a> subway station, one of the <a href="Early%20history%20of%20the%20IRT%20subway">first 28 subway stations</a> in Manhattan, remains located on one of the wide islands in the center of Broadway, on the south side of West 72nd Street. For many years, all traffic on Broadway flowed on either side of this median and its subway entrance, and its uptown lanes went past it along the western edge of triangular Verdi Square. In 2001 and 2002, renovation of the historic 72nd Street station and the addition of a second subway control house and passenger shelter on an adjacent center median just north of 72nd Street, across from the original building, resulted in the creation of a public plaza with stone pavers and extensive seating, connecting the newer building with Verdi Square, and making it necessary to divert northbound traffic to Amsterdam Avenue for one block. While Broadway's southbound lanes at this intersection were unaffected by the new construction, its northbound lanes are no longer contiguous at this intersection. Drivers can either continue along Amsterdam Avenue to head uptown or turn left on West 73rd Street to resume traveling on Broadway.

Several notable apartment buildings are in close proximity to this intersection, including <a href="The%20Ansonia">The Ansonia</a>, its ornate architecture dominating the cityscape here. After the Ansonia first opened as a hotel, live seals were kept in indoor fountains inside its lobby. Later, it was home to the infamous <a href="Plato%27s%20Retreat">Plato's Retreat</a> nightclub. Immediately north of Verdi Square is the formidable <a href="Apple%20Bank%20for%20Savings">Apple Bank for Savings</a> building, formerly the Central Savings Bank, which was built in 1926 and designed to resemble the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Broadway is also home to the <a href="Beacon%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Beacon Theatre</a> at West 74th Street, designated a national landmark in 1979 and still in operation as a concert venue after its establishment in 1929 as a vaudeville and music hall, and "sister" venue to <a href="Radio%20City%20Music%20Hall">Radio City Music Hall</a>.

At its intersection with West 78th Street, Broadway shifts direction and continues directly uptown and aligned approximately with the Commissioners' grid. Past the bend are the historic <a href="the%20Apthorp">Apthorp</a> apartment building, built in 1908, and the <a href="First%20Baptist%20Church%20in%20the%20City%20of%20New%20York">First Baptist Church in the City of New York</a>, incorporated in New York in 1762, its current building on Broadway erected in 1891. The road heads north and passes historically important apartment houses such as <a href="the%20Belnord">the Belnord</a>, the <a href="Astor%20Court%20Building">Astor Court Building</a>, and the <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> <a href="The%20Cornwall">Cornwall</a>.

At Broadway and 95th Street is <a href="Symphony%20Space">Symphony Space</a>, established in 1978 as home to avant-garde and classical music and dance performances in the former Symphony Theatre, which was originally built in 1918 as a premier "music and motion-picture house". At 99th Street, Broadway passes between the controversial skyscrapers of <a href="the%20Ariel">the Ariel</a> East and West.

At 107th Street, Broadway merges with <a href="West%20End%20Avenue">West End Avenue</a>, with the intersection forming <a href="Straus%20Park">Straus Park</a> with its Titanic Memorial by <a href="Augustus%20Lukeman">Augustus Lukeman</a>.

Broadway then passes the campus of <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> at <a href="116th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">116th Street</a> in <a href="Morningside%20Heights%2C%20Manhattan">Morningside Heights</a>, in part on the tract that housed the <a href="Bloomingdale%20Insane%20Asylum">Bloomingdale Insane Asylum</a> from 1808 until it moved to <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County</a> in 1894. Still in Morningside Heights, Broadway passes the park-like campus of <a href="Barnard%20College">Barnard College</a>. Next, the Gothic quadrangle of <a href="Union%20Theological%20Seminary%20%28Manhattan%29">Union Theological Seminary</a> and the brick buildings of the <a href="Jewish%20Theological%20Seminary%20of%20America">Jewish Theological Seminary of America</a> with their landscaped interior courtyards face one another across Broadway. On the next block is the <a href="Manhattan%20School%20of%20Music">Manhattan School of Music</a>.

Broadway then runs past the proposed uptown campus of Columbia University, and the main campus of <a href="City%20College%20of%20New%20York">CUNY–City College</a> near 135th Street; the Gothic buildings of the original City College campus are out of sight, a block to the east. Also to the east are the <a href="brownstone">brownstone</a>s of Hamilton Heights. Hamilton Place is a surviving section of Bloomingdale Road, and originally the address of <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>'s house, <a href="Hamilton%20Grange%20National%20Memorial">The Grange</a>, which has been moved.

Broadway achieves a verdant, park-like effect, particularly in the spring, when it runs between the uptown <a href="Trinity%20Church%20Cemetery">Trinity Church Cemetery</a> and the former Trinity Chapel, now the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Intercession%20%28Manhattan%29">Church of the Intercession</a> near 155th Street.

<a href="NewYork-Presbyterian%20Hospital">NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital</a> lies on Broadway near 166th, 167th, and 168th Streets in <a href="Washington%20Heights%2C%20Manhattan">Washington Heights</a>. The intersection with <a href="Saint%20Nicholas%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Saint Nicholas Avenue</a> at 167th Street forms <a href="Mitchell%20Square%20Park">Mitchell Square Park</a>. At 178th Street, <a href="U.S.%20Route%209%20in%20New%20York">U.S. 9</a> becomes concurrent with Broadway.

Broadway crosses the <a href="Harlem%20River">Harlem River</a> on the <a href="Broadway%20Bridge%20%28Manhattan%29">Broadway Bridge</a> to <a href="Marble%20Hill%2C%20Manhattan">Marble Hill</a>. Afterward, it then enters <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a>, where it is the eastern border of <a href="Riverdale%2C%20Bronx">Riverdale</a> and the western border of <a href="Van%20Cortlandt%20Park">Van Cortlandt Park</a>. At 253rd Street, <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%209A">NY 9A</a> joins with U.S. 9 and Broadway. (NY 9A splits off Broadway at Ashburton Avenue in Yonkers.)

The northwestern corner of the park marks the city limit and Broadway enters <a href="Yonkers%2C%20New%20York">Yonkers</a>, where it is now known as South Broadway. It trends ever westward, closer to the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>, remaining a busy urban commercial street. In downtown Yonkers, it drops close to the river, becomes North Broadway and 9A leaves via Ashburton Avenue. Broadway climbs to the nearby ridgetop runs parallel to the river and the railroad, a few blocks east of both as it passes <a href="St.%20John%27s%20Riverside%20Hospital">St. John's Riverside Hospital</a>. The neighborhoods become more residential and the road gently undulates along the ridgetop. In Yonkers, Broadway passes historic <a href="Philipse%20Manor%20Hall%20State%20Historic%20Site">Philipse Manor</a> house, which dates back to colonial America.

It remains Broadway as it leaves Yonkers for <a href="Hastings-on-Hudson%2C%20New%20York">Hastings-on-Hudson</a>, where it splits into separate north and south routes for . The trees become taller and the houses, many separated from the road by stone fences, become larger. Another National Historic Landmark, the <a href="John%20William%20Draper%20House">John William Draper House</a>, was the site of the first <a href="astrophotograph">astrophotograph</a> of the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>.

In the next village, <a href="Dobbs%20Ferry%2C%20New%20York">Dobbs Ferry</a>, Broadway has various views of the Hudson River while passing through the residential section. Broadway passes by the <a href="Old%20Croton%20Aqueduct">Old Croton Aqueduct</a> and nearby the shopping district of the village. After intersecting with Ashford Avenue, Broadway passes <a href="Mercy%20College%20%28New%20York%29">Mercy College</a>, then turns left again at the center of town just past <a href="South%20Presbyterian%20Church">South Presbyterian Church</a>, headed for equally comfortable <a href="Ardsley-on-Hudson%2C%20New%20York">Ardsley-on-Hudson</a> and <a href="Irvington%2C%20New%20York">Irvington</a>. <a href="Villa%20Lewaro">Villa Lewaro</a>, the home of <a href="Madam%20C.J.%20Walker">Madam C.J. Walker</a>, the first African-American millionaire, is along the highway here. At the north end of the village of Irvington, a <a href="Washington%20Irving%20Memorial">memorial</a> to writer <a href="Washington%20Irving">Washington Irving</a>, after whom the village was renamed, marks the turnoff to his home at <a href="Sunnyside%20%28Tarrytown%2C%20New%20York%29">Sunnyside</a>. Entering into the southern portion of Tarrytown, Broadway passes by historic <a href="Lyndhurst%20%28mansion%29">Lyndhurst mansion</a>, a massive mansion built along the Hudson River built in the early 1800s.

North of here, at the <a href="Kraft%20Foods">Kraft Foods</a> technical center, the <a href="Tappan%20Zee%20Bridge">Tappan Zee Bridge</a> becomes visible. After crossing under the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Thruway">Thruway</a> and I-87 again, here concurrent with <a href="Interstate%20287">I-287</a>, and then intersecting with the four-lane <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20119">NY 119</a>, where 119 splits off to the east, Broadway becomes the busy main street of <a href="Tarrytown%2C%20New%20York">Tarrytown</a>. <a href="Christ%20Episcopal%20Church%20%28Tarrytown%2C%20New%20York%29">Christ Episcopal Church</a>, where Irving worshiped, is along the street. Many high quality restaurants and shops are along this main road. This downtown ends at the eastern terminus of <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20448">NY 448</a>, where Broadway slopes off to the left, downhill, and four signs indicate that Broadway turns left, passing the <a href="Old%20Dutch%20Church%20of%20Sleepy%20Hollow">Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow</a>, another NHL. The road then enters <a href="Sleepy%20Hollow%2C%20New%20York">Sleepy Hollow</a> (formerly North Tarrytown), passing the visitors' center for <a href="Kykuit">Kykuit</a>, the <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> that was (and partially still is) the <a href="Rockefeller%20family">Rockefeller family</a>'s <a href="Estate%20%28house%29">estate</a>. Broadway then passes the historic <a href="Sleepy%20Hollow%20Cemetery">Sleepy Hollow Cemetery</a>, which includes the resting place of Washington Irving and the setting for <a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Sleepy%20Hollow">The Legend of Sleepy Hollow</a>.

Broadway expands to four lanes at the trumpet intersection with <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20117">NY 117</a>, where it finally ends and U.S. 9 becomes <a href="Albany%20Post%20Road">Albany Post Road</a> (and Highland Avenue) at the northern border of <a href="Sleepy%20Hollow%2C%20New%20York">Sleepy Hollow, New York</a>.

"Canyon of Heroes" is occasionally used to refer to the section of lower Broadway in the <a href="Financial%20District%2C%20Manhattan">Financial District</a> that is the location of the city's <a href="ticker-tape%20parade">ticker-tape parade</a>s.

The traditional route of the parade is northward from <a href="Bowling%20Green%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Bowling Green</a> to <a href="City%20Hall%20Park">City Hall Park</a>. Most of the route is lined with tall office buildings along both sides, affording a view of the parade for thousands of office workers who create the snowstorm-like jettison of shredded paper products that characterize the parade.

While typical sports championship parades have been showered with some 50 tons of confetti and shredded paper, the <a href="Victory%20over%20Japan%20Day">V-J Day</a> parade on August 14–15, 1945 – marking the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> – was covered with 5,438 tons of paper, based on estimates provided by the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Department%20of%20Sanitation">New York City Department of Sanitation</a>.

"The Great White Way" is a nickname for a section of Broadway in <a href="Midtown%20Manhattan">Midtown Manhattan</a>, specifically the portion that encompasses the <a href="Theater%20District%2C%20Manhattan">Theater District</a>, between <a href="42nd%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">42nd</a> and <a href="53rd%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">53rd Streets</a>, and encompassing <a href="Times%20Square">Times Square</a>.

In 1880, a stretch of Broadway between <a href="Union%20Square%2C%20Manhattan">Union Square</a> and <a href="Madison%20Square">Madison Square</a> was illuminated by <a href="Charles%20F.%20Brush">Brush</a> <a href="arc%20lamp">arc lamp</a>s, making it among the first electrically lighted streets in the United States. By the 1890s, the portion from <a href="23rd%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">23rd Street</a> to <a href="34th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">34th Street</a> was so brightly illuminated by electrical advertising signs, that people began calling it "The Great White Way". When the theater district moved uptown, the name was transferred to the Times Square area.

The phrase "Great White Way" has been attributed to Shep Friedman, columnist for the "<a href="New%20York%20Morning%20Telegraph">New York Morning Telegraph</a>" in 1901, who lifted the term from the title of a book about the Arctic by <a href="Albert%20Paine">Albert Paine</a>. The headline "Found on the Great White Way" appeared in the February 3, 1902, edition of the "<a href="New%20York%20World-Telegram">New York Evening Telegram</a>".

A portrait of Broadway in the early part of the 20th century and "The Great White Way" late at night appeared in "Artist In Manhattan" (1940) written by the artist-historian <a href="Jerome%20Myers">Jerome Myers</a>:

From south to north, Broadway at one point or another runs over or under various <a href="New%20York%20City%20Subway">New York City Subway</a> lines, including the <a href="IRT%20Lexington%20Avenue%20Line">IRT Lexington Avenue Line</a>, the <a href="BMT%20Broadway%20Line">BMT Broadway Line</a>, <a href="IRT%20Broadway%20%E2%80%93%20Seventh%20Avenue%20Line">IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line</a>, and <a href="IND%20Eighth%20Avenue%20Line">IND Eighth Avenue Line</a> (the <a href="IND%20Sixth%20Avenue%20Line">IND Sixth Avenue Line</a> is the only north-south trunk line in Manhattan that does not run along Broadway).
Early <a href="street%20railway">street railway</a>s on Broadway included the Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad's Broadway and University Place Line (1864?) between <a href="Union%20Square%2C%20Manhattan">Union Square</a> (<a href="14th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">14th Street</a>) and <a href="Times%20Square">Times Square</a> (<a href="42nd%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">42nd Street</a>), the Ninth Avenue Railroad's <a href="Ninth%20and%20Amsterdam%20Avenues%20Line">Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues Line</a> (1884) between 65th Street and 71st Street, the Forty-second Street, Manhattanville and St. Nicholas Avenue Railway's <a href="Broadway%20Branch%20Line">Broadway Branch Line</a> (1885?) between Times Square and <a href="125th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">125th Street</a>, and the Kingsbridge Railway's Kingsbridge Line north of 169th Street. The Broadway Surface Railroad's <a href="Broadway%20Line%20%28Lower%20Manhattan%20surface%29">Broadway Line</a>, a <a href="cable%20car%20%28railway%29">cable car</a> line, opened on lower Broadway (below Times Square) in 1893, and soon became the core of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Street%20Railway">Metropolitan Street Railway</a>, with two cable branches: the <a href="Broadway%20and%20Lexington%20Avenue%20Line">Broadway and Lexington Avenue Line</a> and <a href="Broadway%20and%20Columbus%20Avenue%20Line">Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line</a>.

These streetcar lines were replaced with <a href="bus%20route">bus route</a>s in the 1930s and 1940s. Before Broadway became one-way, the main bus routes along it were the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Omnibus%20Company">New York City Omnibus Company</a>'s (NYCO) <a href="6%20%28NYCO%29">6</a> (Broadway below Times Square), <a href="7%20%28NYCO%29">7</a> (Broadway and Columbus Avenue), and <a href="11%20%28NYCO%29">11</a> (Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues), and the <a href="Surface%20Transportation%20Corporation">Surface Transportation Corporation</a>'s <a href="M100%20%28New%20York%20City%20bus%29">M100</a> (Kingsbridge) and <a href="M104%20%28New%20York%20City%20bus%29">M104</a> (Broadway Branch). Additionally, the <a href="Fifth%20Avenue%20Coach%20Company">Fifth Avenue Coach Company</a>'s (FACCo) <a href="4%20%28FACCo%29">4</a> and 5 used Broadway from <a href="135th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">135th Street</a> north to Washington Heights, and their 5 and 6 used Broadway between <a href="57th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">57th Street</a> and <a href="72nd%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">72nd Street</a>. With the implementation of one-way traffic, the northbound 6 and 7 were moved to <a href="Sixth%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Sixth Avenue</a>.

Bilinear transform

The bilinear transform (also known as <a href="Arnold%20Tustin">Tustin</a>'s method or Mobius Transformation) is used in <a href="digital%20signal%20processing">digital signal processing</a> and discrete-time <a href="control%20theory">control theory</a> to transform continuous-time system representations to discrete-time and vice versa.

The bilinear transform is a special case of a <a href="conformal%20map">conformal map</a>ping (namely, the <a href="M%C3%B6bius%20transformation">Möbius transformation</a>), often used to convert a <a href="transfer%20function">transfer function</a> formula_1 of a <a href="linear">linear</a>, <a href="time-invariant">time-invariant</a> (<a href="LTI%20system%20theory">LTI</a>) filter in the <a href="continuous%20function">continuous</a>-time domain (often called an <a href="analog%20filter">analog filter</a>) to a transfer function formula_2 of a linear, shift-invariant filter in the <a href="discrete%20signal">discrete</a>-time domain (often called a <a href="digital%20filter">digital filter</a> although there are analog filters constructed with <a href="switched%20capacitor">switched capacitor</a>s that are discrete-time filters). It maps positions on the formula_3 axis, formula_4, in the <a href="s-plane">s-plane</a> to the <a href="unit%20circle">unit circle</a>, formula_5, in the <a href="complex%20plane">z-plane</a>. Other bilinear transforms can be used to warp the <a href="frequency%20response">frequency response</a> of any discrete-time linear system (for example to approximate the non-linear frequency resolution of the human auditory system) and are implementable in the discrete domain by replacing a system's unit delays formula_6 with first order <a href="all-pass%20filter">all-pass filter</a>s.

The transform preserves <a href="BIBO%20stability">stability</a> and maps every point of the <a href="frequency%20response">frequency response</a> of the continuous-time filter, formula_7 to a corresponding point in the frequency response of the discrete-time filter, formula_8 although to a somewhat different frequency, as shown in the <a href="%23Frequency%20warping">Frequency warping</a> section below. This means that for every feature that one sees in the frequency response of the analog filter, there is a corresponding feature, with identical gain and phase shift, in the frequency response of the digital filter but, perhaps, at a somewhat different frequency. This is barely noticeable at low frequencies but is quite evident at frequencies close to the <a href="Nyquist%20frequency">Nyquist frequency</a>.

The bilinear transform is a first-order approximation of the natural logarithm function that is an exact mapping of the "z"-plane to the "s"-plane. When the <a href="Laplace%20transform">Laplace transform</a> is performed on a discrete-time signal (with each element of the discrete-time sequence attached to a correspondingly delayed <a href="Dirac%20delta%20function">unit impulse</a>), the result is precisely the <a href="Z%20transform">Z transform</a> of the discrete-time sequence with the substitution of

where formula_10 is the <a href="numerical%20integration">numerical integration</a> step size of the <a href="trapezoidal%20rule">trapezoidal rule</a> used in the bilinear transform derivation; or, in other words, the sampling period. The above bilinear approximation can be solved for formula_11 or a similar approximation for formula_12 can be performed.

The inverse of this mapping (and its first-order bilinear <a href="Logarithm%23Power%20series">approximation</a>) is

The bilinear transform essentially uses this first order approximation and substitutes into the continuous-time transfer function, formula_1

That is

A continuous-time causal filter is <a href="BIBO%20stability">stable</a> if the <a href="Pole%20%28complex%20analysis%29">poles</a> of its transfer function fall in the left half of the <a href="complex%20number">complex</a> <a href="s-plane">s-plane</a>. A discrete-time causal filter is stable if the poles of its transfer function fall inside the <a href="unit%20circle">unit circle</a> in the <a href="complex%20plane">complex z-plane</a>. The bilinear transform maps the left half of the complex s-plane to the interior of the unit circle in the z-plane. Thus filters designed in the continuous-time domain that are stable are converted to filters in the discrete-time domain that preserve that stability.

Likewise, a continuous-time filter is <a href="minimum-phase">minimum-phase</a> if the <a href="Zero%20%28complex%20analysis%29">zeros</a> of its transfer function fall in the left half of the complex s-plane. A discrete-time filter is minimum-phase if the zeros of its transfer function fall inside the unit circle in the complex z-plane. Then the same mapping property assures that continuous-time filters that are minimum-phase are converted to discrete-time filters that preserve that property of being minimum-phase.

As an example take a simple <a href="low-pass">low-pass</a> <a href="RC%20filter">RC filter</a>. This continuous-time filter has a transfer function

If we wish to implement this filter as a digital filter, we can apply the bilinear transform by substituting for formula_18 the formula above; after some reworking, we get the following filter representation:

The coefficients of the denominator are the 'feed-backward' coefficients and the coefficients of the numerator are the 'feed-forward' coefficients used to implement a real-time <a href="digital%20filter">digital filter</a>.

It is possible to relate the coefficients of a continuous-time, analog filter with those of a similar discrete-time digital filter created through the bilinear transform process. Transforming a general, second-order continuous-time filter with the given transfer function

using the bilinear transform (without prewarping any frequency specification) requires the substitution of

where

However, if the frequency warping compensation as described below is used in the bilinear transform, so that both analog and digital filter gain and phase agree at frequency formula_22, then

This results in a discrete-time <a href="digital%20biquad%20filter">digital biquad filter</a> with coefficients expressed in terms of the coefficients of the original continuous time filter:

Normally the constant term in the denominator must be normalized to 1 before deriving the corresponding <a href="difference%20equation">difference equation</a>. This results in

The difference equation (using the <a href="Digital%20filter%23Direct%20Form%20I">Direct Form I</a>) is

To determine the frequency response of a continuous-time filter, the <a href="transfer%20function">transfer function</a> formula_27 is evaluated at formula_28 which is on the formula_29 axis. Likewise, to determine the frequency response of a discrete-time filter, the transfer function formula_30 is evaluated at formula_31 which is on the unit circle, formula_32. The bilinear transform maps the formula_29 axis of the "s"-plane (of which is the domain of formula_27) to the unit circle of the "z"-plane, formula_32 (which is the domain of formula_30), but it is not the same mapping formula_37 which also maps the formula_29 axis to the unit circle. When the actual frequency of formula_39 is input to the discrete-time filter designed by use of the bilinear transform, then it is desired to know at what frequency, formula_40, for the continuous-time filter that this formula_39 is mapped to.

This shows that every point on the unit circle in the discrete-time filter z-plane, formula_43 is mapped to a point on the formula_44 axis on the continuous-time filter s-plane, formula_45. That is, the discrete-time to continuous-time frequency mapping of the bilinear transform is

and the inverse mapping is

The discrete-time filter behaves at frequency formula_48 the same way that the continuous-time filter behaves at frequency formula_49. Specifically, the gain and phase shift that the discrete-time filter has at frequency formula_48 is the same gain and phase shift that the continuous-time filter has at frequency formula_51. This means that every feature, every "bump" that is visible in the frequency response of the continuous-time filter is also visible in the discrete-time filter, but at a different frequency. For low frequencies (that is, when formula_52 or formula_53), then the features are mapped to a "slightly" different frequency; formula_54.

One can see that the entire continuous frequency range

is mapped onto the fundamental frequency interval

The continuous-time filter frequency formula_57 corresponds to the discrete-time filter frequency formula_58 and the continuous-time filter frequency formula_59 correspond to the discrete-time filter frequency formula_60

One can also see that there is a nonlinear relationship between formula_61 and formula_62 This effect of the bilinear transform is called frequency warping. The continuous-time filter can be designed to compensate for this frequency warping by setting formula_46 for every frequency specification that the designer has control over (such as corner frequency or center frequency). This is called pre-warping the filter design.

It is possible, however, to compensate for the frequency warping by pre-warping a frequency specification formula_64 (usually a resonant frequency or the frequency of the most significant feature of the frequency response) of the continuous-time system. These pre-warped specifications may then be used in the bilinear transform to obtain the desired discrete-time system. When designing a digital filter as an approximation of a continuous time filter, the frequency response (both amplitude and phase) of the digital filter can be made to match the frequency response of the continuous filter at a specified frequency formula_64, as well as matching at DC, if the following transform is substituted into the continuous filter transfer function. This is a modified version of Tustin's transform shown above.

However, note that this transform becomes the original transform

as formula_68.

The main advantage of the warping phenomenon is the absence of aliasing distortion of the frequency response characteristic, such as observed with <a href="Impulse%20invariance">Impulse invariance</a>.

Brian Boitano

Brian Anthony Boitano (born October 22, 1963) is an American <a href="Figure%20skating">figure skater</a> from <a href="Sunnyvale%2C%20California">Sunnyvale, California</a>. He is the <a href="Figure%20skating%20at%20the%201988%20Winter%20Olympics">1988 Olympic champion</a>, the 1986 and 1988 <a href="World%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships">World Champion</a>, and the 1985–1988 <a href="United%20States%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships">U.S. National Champion</a>. He turned professional following the 1988 season. He returned to competition in 1993 and competed at the <a href="1994%20Winter%20Olympics">1994 Winter Olympics</a>, where he placed sixth.

Brian Boitano was born in <a href="Mountain%20View%2C%20California">Mountain View, California</a>, and as an adult has lived in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Boitano is a graduate of <a href="Marian%20A.%20Peterson%20High%20School">Marian A. Peterson High School</a> in Sunnyvale, California.

Brian Boitano first made his mark on the international scene when he won the bronze medal at the 1978 <a href="World%20Junior%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships">World Junior Figure Skating Championships</a>, beating future rival <a href="Brian%20Orser">Brian Orser</a> for that medal.

In 1982 Boitano became the first American to land a <a href="Axel%20jump">triple axel</a>. In 1987 he introduced his signature jump, the 'Tano triple <a href="lutz%20jump">lutz</a>' in which the skater raises his left arm above his head. He attempted a quadruple jump throughout the 1986–87 season and at the 1988 <a href="World%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships">World Figure Skating Championships</a>, but did not cleanly land the jump; he double-footed the landing on two occasions.

Boitano was known primarily as a jumper early in his career and he, along with several other skaters, helped push the technical envelope of men's skating. It was not until his failure to defend his World title in 1987 that he focused specifically on improving his artistry.

Boitano placed second at the 1984 <a href="United%20States%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships">United States Figure Skating Championships</a>, earning himself a trip to the <a href="1984%20Winter%20Olympics">1984 Winter Olympics</a>. He placed 5th at the Olympics, setting the stage for his success over the next four years.

Following the 1984 Olympics, several skaters emerged as likely medal hopes following the retirement of <a href="Scott%20Hamilton%20%28figure%20skater%29">Scott Hamilton</a>.

Boitano won the 1985 <a href="United%20States%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships">United States Figure Skating Championships</a>, the first of his four titles. At the first <a href="1985%20World%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships">World Championships</a> of the post-Hamilton era in 1985, <a href="Alexander%20Fadeev%20%28figure%20skater%29">Alexander Fadeev</a> won, with <a href="Brian%20Orser">Brian Orser</a> finishing 2nd and Boitano 3rd. He had injured tendons in his right ankle a few weeks before the 1986 U.S. Championships but went on to win his second national title. At the <a href="1986%20World%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships">1986 World Championships</a>, Boitano took the title, while Fadeev had a disastrous free skate despite having been in an excellent position to win; Orser finished 2nd once again.

During the 1986–87 season, Boitano had introduced two new elements to his programs: the 'Tano triple <a href="lutz%20jump">lutz</a> and a quadruple <a href="toe%20loop%20jump">toe loop</a>, although he never succeeded in landing a clean quadruple jump in competition. The 1987 World Championships were held in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, giving defending World champion Boitano a home-field advantage. The outcome of the event would set the tone for the 1988 Olympics. At Worlds, Boitano fell on his quadruple toe loop attempt and placed second.

After losing the world title to Orser at home, Boitano and his coach <a href="Linda%20Leaver">Linda Leaver</a> decided that some changes needed to be made if Boitano was to become the Olympic champion. Boitano had always been good at the technical requirements ("The first mark"), but he was weak on the artistic ("the second mark"). He was a self-described "jumping robot." In order to help his growth as an artist, he hired choreographer <a href="Sandra%20Bezic">Sandra Bezic</a> to choreograph his programs for the 1987–1988 Olympic season.

Bezic choreographed two programs that featured clean lines and accentuated the skating abilities of the 5' 11" Boitano. The short program was based on <a href="Giacomo%20Meyerbeer">Giacomo Meyerbeer</a>'s ballet "Les Patineurs" in which Boitano plays a cocky young man showing off his tricks, using movements dating back to the 19th century. In one famous moment, Boitano wipes ice shavings, also called snow, off his skate blade and tosses it over his shoulder after landing a triple axel combination. The free skating program was based on the film score, "Napoleon", detailing various phases of a soldier's life.

Boitano debuted his new programs at 1987 <a href="Skate%20Canada%20International">Skate Canada</a>, held in the <a href="Saddledome">Saddledome</a> in <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a>, <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, Canada, the same venue in which he would compete against Brian Orser for the Olympic title three months later. Boitano's new programs were received with standing ovations by the audience. Although Orser won the competition, Boitano skated clean, landing seven triple jumps, including a footwork section into a jump. He did however pop his planned 2nd triple axel. Boitano, Leaver, and Bezic were so confident about the strength of Boitano's new programs that they omitted the quadruple toe loop, which if landed, could have put him a shoulder above Orser in technical merit.

The short program at the 1988 <a href="United%20States%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships">United States Figure Skating Championships</a> proved to be a highlight. Boitano received marks of 6.0 from eight of the nine judges for presentation, the second mark. His free skate was flawed. Due to delays, he did not skate until after midnight. Still, Boitano won the competition, and went into the Olympics as the national champion (U.S.), as did Orser (Canadian).

Going into the Olympics, Boitano and <a href="Brian%20Orser">Brian Orser</a> each had won a World title and each had excellent, balanced repertoire, with Boitano being known as the slightly better technician and Orser as the better artist. Adding to the rivalry, Boitano and Orser were both performing military-themed programs. Boitano's was to the music of Napoleon.

The <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Brians">Battle of the Brians</a> at the <a href="Figure%20skating%20at%20the%201988%20Winter%20Olympics">1988 Winter Olympics</a> was the highlight of Boitano's amateur career. Boitano and Orser were effectively tied going into the <a href="free%20skating">free skating</a> portion of the event and whoever won that portion would win the event. <a href="Alexander%20Vladimirovich%20Fadeyev">Alexander Fadeev</a> had won the <a href="compulsory%20figures">compulsory figures</a> section of the competition with Boitano second and Orser third. In the <a href="Short%20program%20%28figure%20skating%29">short program</a>, Orser placed first and Boitano second. The <a href="free%20skating">free skating</a> was, at the time, worth 50% of the score, and so Boitano's lead would not be enough to hold him in first place if he lost the free skate.

Boitano skated a clean, technically excellent long program, with eight triple jumps, two Axels, and a triple-triple combination. Orser made one small mistake on a jump and omitted his planned second triple axel. Boitano won the Battle in a 5–4 split. Boitano won the gold medal, wearing skates with American flag appliqués that are now part of the collections of the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20American%20History">National Museum of American History</a> at the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>.

Following the Olympics, both Orser and Boitano went to the World Championships, which Boitano won. Boitano turned professional soon after.

Following the Olympics, Boitano went on to dominate competitions in the professional ranks, winning 10 straight professional competitions, including 5 consecutive World Professional Championship titles and 4 consecutive wins at the Challenge of Champions. Boitano also appeared in "<a href="Carmen%20on%20Ice">Carmen on Ice</a>", for which he won an <a href="Emmy">Emmy</a>. However, Boitano wanted to return to amateur competition and make another run at the Olympics.

Boitano's lobby proved successful and in June 1993, the <a href="International%20Skating%20Union">International Skating Union</a> (ISU) introduced a clause, commonly known as the "Boitano rule," which allowed professionals to reinstate as "amateur" or "eligible" skaters. This had been the result of Boitano's active involvement during the early 1990s, which saw professionals being allowed in the Olympic Games in the sports of tennis and basketball. Boitano reinstated as an amateur to compete in the <a href="1994%20Winter%20Olympics">1994 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Lillehammer">Lillehammer</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a>.

Boitano competed at the 1994 <a href="United%20States%20Figure%20Skating%20Championships">United States Figure Skating Championships</a>, led after the short program, but lost to <a href="Scott%20Davis%20%28figure%20skater%29">Scott Davis</a> in the long program in a 6–3 split decision. Boitano was named to the Olympic team. Going into the Olympics as a medal favorite in a strong field, Boitano missed his triple axel combination during the short program for the first time in his career. This mistake proved extremely costly, and knocked Boitano out of medal contention. He skated a good long program and finished 6th.

Boitano returned to the professional ranks afterwards. He was inducted into the <a href="World%20Figure%20Skating%20Hall%20of%20Fame">World Figure Skating Hall of Fame</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Figure%20Skating%20Hall%20of%20Fame">United States Figure Skating Hall of Fame</a> in 1996.

List of political scandals in the United Kingdom

Political scandals in the United Kingdom are commonly referred to by the press and commentators as "'sleaze".

A number of <a href="political%20scandal">political scandal</a>s in the 1980s and 1990s created the impression of what was described in the <a href="British%20press">British press</a> as "sleaze": a perception that the then <a href="British%20Conservative%20Party">Conservative</a> government was associated with <a href="political%20corruption">political corruption</a> and <a href="hypocrisy">hypocrisy</a>. This was revived in the late 1990s due to accounts of so-called "sleaze" by the Labour government.

<doc id="4635" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4635" title="Bombardier Inc.">
Bombardier Inc.

Bombardier Inc. () is a <a href="multinational%20corporation">multinational</a> <a href="aerospace">aerospace</a> and <a href="transport">transport</a>ation company based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Starting as a maker of snow machines or <a href="snowmobile">snowmobile</a>s, over the years it has grown into a large manufacturer of <a href="regional%20airliner">regional airliner</a>s, <a href="business%20jet">business jet</a>s, <a href="mass%20transportation">mass transportation</a> equipment, and recreational equipment, and a provider of financial services.

Bombardier was founded by <a href="Joseph-Armand%20Bombardier">Joseph-Armand Bombardier</a> as "L'Auto-Neige Bombardier Limitée" (loosely translated to "Bombardier Snow Car Limited") on July 10, 1942, at <a href="Valcourt%20%28city%29%2C%20Quebec">Valcourt</a> in the <a href="Eastern%20Townships">Eastern Townships</a>, <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>. A mechanic who dreamed of building a vehicle that could "float on snow," in 1937 Bombardier designed and produced his first <a href="snowmobile">snowmobile</a> in a small <a href="Valcourt%20%28city%29%2C%20Quebec">Valcourt, Quebec</a> repair shop.

Bombardier's technological breakthrough in the design of bush vehicles came in the mid-1930s when he developed a drive system that revolutionized travel in snow and swampy conditions. In 1937 Bombardier sold 12 snowmobiles, named the B7 and, in 1942, created l'Auto-Neige Bombardier Limitée company.

The first snowmobiles were large, multipassenger vehicles designed to help people get around during the long winter months. Snowmobiles were used in rural Quebec to take children to school, carry freight, deliver mail, and as ambulances. His invention filled a very particular need in the region and soon business was booming. In 1941 Armand opened a new factory in Valcourt. Then a major setback hit the growing business: the <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Second World War</a> was well underway and the Canadian government issued wartime rationing regulations. Bombardier customers had to prove that snowmobiles were essential to their livelihood in order to buy one. To keep his business going, Armand shifted his focus and developed vehicles for the military. After the war, Bombardier experienced another setback in his snowmobile business. In 1948, the Quebec government passed a law requiring all highways and local roads to be cleared of snow; the Bombardier company's sales fell by nearly half in one year. Armand Bombardier therefore decided to diversify his business, first by producing tracked snowplows sized specifically for use on municipal sidewalks (replacing <a href="horse-drawn%20vehicles">horse-drawn vehicles</a>), then by making all-terrain vehicles for the <a href="mining">mining</a>, oil, and <a href="forestry">forestry</a> industries.

Of note, the machines had removable front skis that could be replaced with front wheels for use on paved or hard surfaces, thus providing greater utility to his large snowmobiles. Production of these machines evolved over time. During 1951, the wooden bodies were replaced with sheet steel and these vehicles were powered by <a href="Chrysler">Chrysler</a> flathead six-cylinder engines and 3-speed manual transmissions. In the 1960s, V-8 engines began to appear and during the 1969/1970 production years, the standard round "porthole"-style windows were replaced with larger rectangular windows which allowed more interior light and made them feel less claustrophobic. Following these changes came the switchover to more reliable <a href="Chrysler">Chrysler</a> Industrial 318 engines with the automatic Loadflite transmissions. Production of these machines continued into the mid-1970s.

Bombardier wanted to develop a fast, lightweight snowmobile that could carry one or two people. In the early 1950s, Armand set aside his dream to focus on developing his company's other tracked vehicles, but by the end of the decade, smaller, more efficient engines had been developed and were starting to come onto the market. Bombardier resumed his efforts to build a "miniature" snowmobile. He worked alongside his eldest son Germain, who shared his father's mechanical talents. Armand and Germain developed several prototypes of the lightweight snowmobile and finally, the first Bombardier snowmobile went on sale in 1959.

The <a href="Ski-Doo">Ski-Doo</a> snowmobile was originally called the "Ski-Dog" because Bombardier meant it to be a practical vehicle to replace the dogsled for hunters and trappers. By an accident, a painter misinterpreted the name and painted "Ski-Doo" on the first prototype. The public soon discovered that speedy vehicles that could zoom over snow were a lot of fun. Suddenly a new winter sport was born, centred in Quebec. In the first year, Bombardier sold 225 Ski-Doos; four years later, 8,210 were sold. But Armand was reluctant to focus too much on the Ski-Doo and move resources away from his all-terrain vehicles. He vividly remembered his earlier business setbacks that forced him to diversify. Armand slowed down promotion of the Ski-Doo line to prevent it from dominating the other company products, while still allowing him to dominate the snowmobile industry. The snowmobiles produced were of exceptional quality and performance, earning a better reputation than the rival <a href="Polaris%20Industries">Polaris</a> and <a href="Arctic%20Cat">Arctic Cat</a> brand of motosleds. In 1971, Bombardier completed the purchase of the <a href="Moto-Ski">Moto-Ski</a> company.

On February 18, 1964, J. Armand Bombardier died of cancer at age 56. He left behind a thriving business, but also one that had been focused on one person. Armand dominated his company, overseeing all areas of operation. He controlled the small research department, making all the drawings himself. By the time of his death sales of the company had reached <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>20 <a href="million">million</a>, which is the equivalent of C$160 million in 2004 dollars. The younger generation took over, led by Armand's sons and sons-in-law. The young team reorganized and decentralized the company, adopting modern business tactics. The company adopted the latest technological innovation—the computer—to handle inventory, accounts, and billing. Distribution networks were improved and increased, and an incentive program was developed for sales staff.

In 1967 L'Auto-Neige Bombardier Limitée was renamed "Bombardier Limited" and on January 23, 1969, the company went public, listing on the <a href="Montreal%20Exchange">Montreal</a> and <a href="Toronto%20Stock%20Exchange">Toronto</a> <a href="stock%20exchange">stock exchange</a>s.

In October 2016, Bombardier Inc. announced that, by the end of 2018, they will slash up to 7,500 jobs or more than 10 percent of 70,900 employees from 2015. About a half of job cuts will be done in railway technology unit.

In 1986, Bombardier acquired <a href="Canadair">Canadair</a> after the Canadian government-owned aircraft manufacturing company recorded the largest corporate loss in Canadian history. Shortly thereafter, <a href="de%20Havilland%20Canada">de Havilland Canada</a>, <a href="Short%20Brothers">Short Brothers</a> and <a href="Learjet">Learjet</a> operations were absorbed by the aerospace arm, which now accounts for over half of company revenue. Bombardier's most popular aircraft currently include its <a href="Bombardier%20Dash%208">Q400</a>, <a href="Bombardier%20CRJ200">CRJ100/200/440</a>, and <a href="Bombardier%20CRJ700">CRJ700/900/1000</a> lines of <a href="regional%20airliner">regional airliner</a>s. In late September, the Company announced that Indian airline SpiceJet had ordered 25 of the Q400 planes with an option for an additional 25 units. The total sale for 50 would be valued at US$1.7 billion, minus discounts.

Bombardier also manufactures the <a href="Global%20Express">Global Express</a> and the <a href="Bombardier%20Challenger%20600">Challenger</a> business jet. <a href="Learjet">Learjet</a> continues to operate as a subsidiary of Bombardier, manufacturing jets under the Learjet marque. The slogan was changed in 2012 from "We Move People" to "Evolution of Mobility."

After some delay in its development of the <a href="Bombardier_CSeries">Bombardier C Series</a>, the CS100 and CS300 now compete with the smaller aircraft in the <a href="Airbus%20A320%20family">Airbus A320 family</a> and the <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> <a href="Boeing%20737">737 family</a>. On June 29, 2016 Bombardier delivered the first C Series CS100 aircraft to Swiss International Air Lines, which were the launch customer for the new aircraft. Subsequently, both <a href="Air%20Canada">Air Canada</a> and <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> placed firm orders for the CSeries. The CS300 is the latest plane offered by Bombardier with up to 160 seats.

In May 2017, Bombardier and the state-owned Chinese air company <a href="Comac">Comac</a> began holding talks about an investment into Bombardier's passenger jet business.

In late September 2017, the U.S. Department of Commerce proposed a 219% tariff on <a href="Bombardier%20CSeries">Bombardier CSeries</a> aircraft to be imported into the country. This was a preliminary ruling on a complaint by Boeing that Bombardier was selling the CS100 to <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> at unduly low prices, due to subsidies from the governments of Canada and Quebec subsidies; this allegedly produced an unfair competitive advantage. Boeing's complaint stated the the CS100 was being sold at US$19.6 million each, below the US$33.2 million production cost. A final decision on the tariff will be made by the U.S. by spring 2018. Bombardier said it will be disputing the "absurd" ruling. The governments of Canada and the UK also promised their support, threatening to stop ordering Boeing aircraft since the company was putting aerospace jobs at risk.

In 1970 Bombardier acquired the Austrian company <a href="Lohner-Werke">Lohner</a>-<a href="Rotax">Rotax</a>, a manufacturer of snowmobile engines and tramways, and became involved with <a href="Rail%20transport">rail business</a>.

This section started to gain importance in the mid-1990s in the renaissance of <a href="tram">tram</a>ways or "<a href="light%20rail">light-rail transit</a>." Bombardier acquired the assets and designs of <a href="Budd%20Company">Budd Company</a>, <a href="Pullman%20Company">Pullman Company</a>, and <a href="American%20Locomotive%20Company">American Locomotive Company</a>/<a href="Montreal%20Locomotive%20Works">Montreal Locomotive Works</a>, the latter of which continued in the <a href="locomotive">locomotive</a> business until 1985. In the Canadian market, they also acquired <a href="Hawker%20Siddeley%20Canada">Hawker Siddeley Canada</a>’s <a href="Thunder%20Bay">Thunder Bay</a> facilities and <a href="Urban%20Transportation%20Development%20Corporation">UTDC</a> (formerly of <a href="Kingston%2C%20Ontario">Kingston</a>), and in Mexico the company acquired <a href="Concarril">Concarril</a>.

In 2001 Bombardier acquired <a href="Adtranz">Adtranz</a> (DaimlerChrysler Rail Systems), a manufacturer of trains which were widely used throughout Germany and Great Britain. Bombardier was one of the companies that took over <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a>'s Research and Development facilities after <a href="impact%20of%20the%20privatisation%20of%20British%20Rail">privatisation</a> (the remainder largely being absorbed into <a href="AEA%20Technology">AEA Technology</a> and <a href="Alstom">Alstom</a>).

With the acquisition of Adtranz from DaimlerChrysler, Bombardier Transportation emerged as one of the largest manufacturers of railway rolling stock in the world.
Bombardier Capital (BC) was the Bombardier division in charge of financial services. From 1973, when it was based in <a href="Colchester%2C%20Vermont">Colchester, Vermont</a>, it offered financial services such as lending, leasing, and asset-management throughout the Americas. In 2001, BC restricted its loan activity to existing customers. The company, which began transitioning some services to <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a> in 1997, ceased taking on new consumer loans in 2001, focusing instead on loans to retailers and gradually downsizing. In November 2004, Bombardier's credit evaluation was downgraded by <a href="Moody%27s">Moody's</a> from "moderate credit risk" (Baa3) to "questionable credit quality" (Ba2), a below <a href="investment%20grade">investment grade</a> rating which impacted Bombardier Capital, although the company's transportation division was unaffected. In 2005, Bombardier sold the Inventory Finance Division of BC to <a href="GE%20Commercial%20Finance">GE Commercial Finance</a>.

Bombardier used to be a major Canadian <a href="defence%20contractor">defence contractor</a>. With the latest restructuring, the company sold off nearly all of its military-related work in Canada. Military Aviation Services was sold to <a href="SPAR%20Aerospace">SPAR Aerospace</a> and land-based defence products made by <a href="Urban%20Transportation%20Development%20Corporation">Urban Transportation Development Corporation</a> ceased operations as Bombardier moved away from non-aviation defence products.

On 27 August 2003, Bombardier, Inc. announced the sale of its BRP (Recreational Products) unit to a group of investors: <a href="Bain%20Capital">Bain Capital</a> (50%), Bombardier Family (35%) and <a href="Caisse%20de%20d%C3%A9p%C3%B4t%20et%20placement%20du%20Qu%C3%A9bec">Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec</a> (15%) for $875 million.
As part of the deal, BRP retained rights to the sprocket logo, which it subsequently modified. Its <a href="snowcat">snowcat</a>s and snowmobiles dated back to the origins of the company; current brands are Ski-Doo and <a href="Lynx%20%28snowmobile%29">Lynx</a>. Bombardier Recreational Products has also become well known for its <a href="Sea-Doo%20%28disambiguation%29">Sea-Doo</a> <a href="personal%20watercraft">personal watercraft</a> division which also features jet-powered sport boats. Bombardier also makes <a href="all-terrain%20vehicle">all-terrain vehicle</a>s (ATVs). In 2006, the Bombardier ATV was rebranded as Can-Am. Can-Am was the name of the line of dirt bikes it produced in the 1980s which used high-tech engines featuring Rotax Automatic Variable Exhaust (RAVE) valving to create peak power at a wider range of RPMs. The bikes were shelved but technology tweaks re-emerged in the company's Ski-Doo snowmobiles (beginning with the 1989 model year Ski-Doo Mach 1). Many of today's snowmobiles produced by the company feature proprietary engineering by BRP's Rotax brand engine production plant located in Austria. BRP's Can-Am product is among the high tech recreational vehicles which include the <a href="Can-Am%20Spyder">Can-Am Spyder</a>, a three-wheel roadster with a rear-drive wheel and featuring a vehicle stability system (VSS), anti-lock braking system (ABS) and other safety and electronic vehicle control enhancements as certified by the <a href="National%20Highway%20Traffic%20Safety%20Administration">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a> (NHTSA).

In the late 1970s in <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="C%C3%B3ras%20Iompair%20%C3%89ireann">Córas Iompair Éireann</a> (now <a href="Bus%20%C3%89ireann">Bus Éireann</a> and <a href="Dublin%20Bus">Dublin Bus</a>) commissioned a range of single and double decker buses to be designed and produced. The prototypes were devised in Germany and production was carried out in Shannon, Co. Clare, Ireland. A total of 51 express coaches (KE type) and 366 double deck buses (KD) were assembled at this facility between 1980 and 1983. They remained in service until 1997 and 2000 respectively. Some surviving examples are now exhibits at the National Transport Museum of Ireland in Howth, Co. Dublin.

The Bombardier Museum is a large modern museum in Valcourt, Quebec dedicated to the life of Joseph-Armand Bombardier, the snowmobile, and the industry he helped create. Opened in 1971, with substantial renovations in 1990, the museum is professionally curated and features a wide array of Ski-Doos, other industrial designs, and a selection of related books, booklets and other items of interest to enthusiasts.

Also of note at the museum is the original garage "factory" that was the genesis of the Bombardier organization. The garage was carefully removed from its original location in Valcourt and moved to its present site at the museum, which is located blocks away from the present-day <a href="Bombardier%20Recreational%20Products">Bombardier Recreational Products</a> factory.

<doc id="4636" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4636" title="Break key">
Break key

The Break key of a <a href="computer%20keyboard">computer keyboard</a> refers to breaking a <a href="Telegraphy">telegraph</a> circuit and originated with 19th century practice. In modern usage, the key has no well-defined purpose, but while this is the case, it can be used by software for miscellaneous tasks, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection.

Because the break function is usually combined with the pause function on one key since the introduction of the <a href="IBM%20Model%20M">IBM Model M</a> 101-key keyboard in 1985, the Break key is also called the Pause key. It can be used to pause some <a href="computer%20game">computer game</a>s.

A standard telegraph circuit connects all the keys, <a href="Telegraph%20sounder">sounders</a> and batteries in a single series loop. Thus the sounders actuate only when both keys are down (closed, also known as "marking" — after the ink marks made on paper tape by early printing telegraphs). So the receiving operator has to hold their key down or close a built-in shorting switch in order to let the other operator send. As a consequence, the receiving operator could interrupt the sending operator by opening their key, breaking the circuit and forcing it into a "spacing" condition. Both sounders stop responding to the sender's keying, alerting the sender. (A physical break in the telegraph line would have the same effect.)

The <a href="teleprinter">teleprinter</a> operated in a very similar fashion except that the sending station kept the loop closed (logic 1, or "marking") even during short pauses between characters. Holding down a special "break" key opened the loop, forcing it into a continuous logic 0, or "spacing", condition. When this occurred, the teleprinter mechanisms continually actuated without printing anything, as the all-0s character is the non-printing "NUL" in both <a href="Baudot%20code">Baudot</a> and <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a>. The resulting noise got the sending operator's attention.

This practice carried over to teleprinter use on <a href="time-sharing">time-sharing</a> computers. A continuous spacing (logical 0) condition violates the rule that every valid character has to end with one or more logic 1 (marking) "stop" bits. The computer (specifically the <a href="UART">UART</a>) recognized this as a special "break" condition and generated an <a href="interrupt">interrupt</a> that typically stopped a running program or forced the operating system to prompt for a login. Although asynchronous serial telegraphy is now rare, the key once used with terminal emulators can still be used by software for similar purposes.

On the <a href="Sinclair%20ZX80">Sinclair ZX80</a> and <a href="Sinclair%20ZX81">ZX81</a> computers, the Break is accessed by pressing Space. On the <a href="Sinclair%20ZX%20Spectrum">Sinclair ZX Spectrum</a> it is accessed by . The Spectrum+ and later computers have a dedicated key. It does not trigger an interrupt but will halt any running BASIC program, or terminate the loading or saving of data to cassette tape. An interrupted BASIC program can usually be resumed with the codice_1 command. The <a href="Sinclair%20QL">Sinclair QL</a> computer, without a key, maps the function to .

On a <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a> computer, the key generates a hardware reset which would normally cause a <a href="warm%20restart">warm restart</a> of the computer. A <a href="cold%20restart">cold restart</a> is triggered by pressing . If a filing system is installed, will cause the computer to search for and load or run a file called codice_2 on the filing system's default device (eg floppy disk 0, network user BOOT). The latter two behaviours were inherited by the successor to <a href="Acorn%20MOS">Acorn MOS</a>, <a href="RISC%20OS">RISC OS</a>. These behaviours could be changed or exchanged in software, and were often used in rudimentary <a href="software%20piracy">anti-piracy</a> techniques.

On many modern <a href="personal%20computer">PCs</a>, interrupts screen output by <a href="BIOS">BIOS</a> until another key is pressed. This is effective during <a href="booting">boot</a> in <a href="text%20mode">text mode</a> and in a <a href="DOS">DOS</a> box in <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> safe mode with 50 lines. On early keyboards without a key (before the introduction of 101/102-key keyboards) the Pause function was assigned to , and the Break function to ; these key-combinations still work with most programs, even on modern PCs with modern keyboards. Pressing the dedicated key on 101/102-key keyboards sends the same <a href="scancode">scancode</a>s as pressing , then , then releasing them in the reverse order would do; additionally, an E1 prefix is sent, which enables 101/102-key-aware software to discern the two situations, while older software usually just ignores the prefix. The key is different from all other keys in that it sends no scancodes at all on release; therefore it is not possible for any software to determine whether this key is being held down.

On modern keyboards, the key is usually labeled "Pause" with "Break" below, sometimes separated by a line, or "Pause" on the top of the keycap and "Break" on the front. In most Windows environments, the key combination brings up the system properties.

Compact and notebook keyboards often do not have a dedicated key. 

These may use the following substitutes for : 

Substitutes for : 

<a href="Apple%20keyboard">Apple keyboard</a>s do not have the Pause/Break key, as <a href="Mac%20OS%20X">Mac OS X</a> does not use it. The key may be substituted by 

For Dell laptops without a Break key press the ALT+Space bar and select "Interrupt".

While both and combination are commonly implemented as a way of breaking the execution of a console application, they are also used for similar effect in <a href="integrated%20development%20environment">integrated development environment</a>s. Although these two are often considered interchangeable, compilers and execution environments usually assign different signals to these. Additionally, in some kernels (e.g. miscellaneous DOS variants) is detected only at the time OS tries reading from a keyboard buffer and only if it's the only key sequence in the buffer, while is often translated instantly (e.g. by <a href="BIOS%20call">INT 1Bh</a> under DOS). Because of this, is usually a more effective choice under these operating systems; sensitivity for these two combinations can be enhanced by the codice_3 <a href="CONFIG.SYS">CONFIG.SYS</a> statement.

Bogie

A bogie ( ) (in some <a href="Word%20sense">senses</a> called a truck in North American English) is a <a href="chassis">chassis</a> or framework carrying <a href="Wheelset%20%28rail%20transport%29">wheelsets</a>, attached to a vehicle, thus serving as a <a href="Modularity">modular</a> subassembly of <a href="Railroad%20wheel">wheels</a> and <a href="axle">axle</a>s. Bogies take various forms in various modes of transport. A bogie may remain normally attached (as on many <a href="railway">railway</a> carriages [cars] and <a href="semi-trailer">semi-trailer</a>s) or be quickly detachable (as the <a href="dolly%20%28trailer%29">dolly</a> in a <a href="road%20train">road train</a> or in railway <a href="bogie%20exchange">bogie exchange</a>); it may contain a <a href="Suspension%20%28vehicle%29">suspension</a> within it (as most rail and trucking bogies do), or be solid and in turn be suspended (as most bogies of <a href="continuous%20track">tracked</a> vehicles are); it may be mounted on a <a href="swivel">swivel</a>, as traditionally on a railway carriage or locomotive, additionally jointed and sprung (as in the <a href="landing%20gear">landing gear</a> of an <a href="airliner">airliner</a>), or held in place by other means (centreless bogies).

While "bogie" is the preferred spelling and first-listed variant in various dictionaries, bogey and bogy are also used.

A "bogie" in the UK, or a "railroad truck", "wheel truck", or simply "truck" in North America, is a structure underneath a <a href="railway%20vehicle">railway vehicle</a> (wagon, coach or locomotive) to which axles (and, hence, wheels) are attached through <a href="Bearing%20%28mechanical%29">bearing</a>s. In <a href="Indian%20English">Indian English</a>, "bogie" may also refer to an entire <a href="railway%20carriage">railway carriage</a>. In <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, the term "bogie" is often alternatively used to refer to a freight or goods wagon (shortened from "bogie wagon").

The first standard gauge British railway to build coaches with bogies, instead of rigidly mounted axles, was the <a href="Midland%20Railway">Midland Railway</a> in 1874.

Bogies serve a number of purposes:

Usually, two bogies are fitted to each <a href="Railroad%20car">carriage</a>, wagon or <a href="locomotive">locomotive</a>, one at each end. An alternate configuration often is used in <a href="articulated%20vehicle">articulated vehicle</a>s, which places the bogies (often <a href="Jacobs%20bogie">Jacobs bogie</a>s) under the connection between the carriages or wagons.

Most bogies have two axles, but some cars designed for heavy loads have more axles per bogie. Heavy-duty cars may have more than two bogies using <a href="span%20bolster">span bolster</a>s to equalize the load and connect the bogies to the cars.

Usually, the train floor is at a level above the bogies, but the floor of the car may be lower between bogies, such as for a <a href="bilevel%20rail%20car">bilevel rail car</a> to increase interior space while staying within <a href="Loading%20gauge">height restrictions</a>, or in easy-access, stepless-entry, low-floor trains.

Key components of a bogie include:

The connections of the bogie with the rail vehicle allow a certain degree of rotational movement around a vertical axis pivot (bolster), with side bearers preventing excessive movement. More modern, bolsterless bogie designs omit these features, instead taking advantage of the sideways movement of the suspension to permit rotational movement.

The Commonwealth bogie, manufactured by the <a href="English%20Steel%20Corporation">English Steel Corporation</a> under licence from the <a href="Commonwealth%20Steel%20Company">Commonwealth Steel Company</a> in <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, USA. Fitted with <a href="SKF">SKF</a> or <a href="Timken%20Company">Timken</a> bearings, it was introduced in the late 1950s for all BR Mark 1 vehicles. It was a heavy, cast-steel design weighing about , with sealed roller bearings on the axle ends, avoiding the need to maintain <a href="axle%20box">axle box</a> oil levels.

The <a href="leaf%20spring">leaf spring</a>s were replaced by coil springs (one per wheel) running vertically rather than horizontally. The advanced design gave a better ride quality than the BR1, being rated for .

The side frame of the bogie was usually of bar construction, with simple horn guides attached, allowing the axle boxes vertical movements between them. The axle boxes had a cast-steel equaliser beam or bar resting on them. The bar had two steel coil springs placed on it and the bogie frame rested on the springs. The effect was to allow the bar to act as a compensating lever between the two axles and to use both springs to soften shocks from either axle. The bogie had a conventional bolster suspension with swing links carrying a spring plank.

The B4 bogie was introduced in 1963. It was a fabricated steel design versus cast iron and was lighter than the Commonwealth, weighing in at . It also had a speed rating of .

Axle to spring connection was again with fitted roller bearings. However, now two coil springs rather than one were fitted per wheel.

Only a very small number of Mark 1 stock was fitted with the B4 bogie from new, it being used on the Mark 1 only to replace worn BR1 bogies. The <a href="British%20Rail%20Mark%202">British Rail Mark 2</a> coach, however, carried the B4 bogies from new. A heavier-duty version, the B5, was standard on Southern Region Mk1-based EMUs from the 1960s onwards. Some Mark 1 catering cars had mixed bogies—a B5 under the kitchen end, and a B4 under the seating end. Some of the B4-fitted Mark 2s, as well as many B4-fitted Mark 1 <a href="Brake%20Gangwayed">BGs</a> were allowed to run at with extra maintenance, particularly of the wheel profile, and more frequent exams.

The BT10 bogie was introduced on the <a href="British%20Rail%20Mark%203">British Rail Mark 3</a> coach in the 1970s. Each wheel is separately connected to the bogie by a swing-arm axle.

There is dual suspension:

Most <a href="diesel%20locomotive">diesel locomotive</a>s and <a href="electric%20locomotive">electric locomotive</a>s are carried on bogies. Those used in the USA include <a href="AAR%20type%20A%20switcher%20truck">AAR type A switcher truck</a>, <a href="Blomberg%20B">Blomberg B</a>, <a href="HT-C%20truck">HT-C truck</a> and <a href="Flexicoil">Flexicoil</a>.

On a <a href="steam%20locomotive">steam locomotive</a>, the <a href="Leading%20wheel">leading</a> and <a href="trailing%20wheel">trailing wheel</a>s may be mounted on bogies like <a href="pony%20truck">pony truck</a>s or <a href="Bissel%20bogie">Bissel bogie</a>s. <a href="Articulated%20locomotive">Articulated locomotive</a>s (e.g. <a href="Fairlie%20locomotive">Fairlie</a>, <a href="Garratt">Garratt</a> or <a href="Mallet%20locomotive">Mallet</a> locomotives) have power bogies similar to those on diesel and electric locomotives.

A <a href="rollbock">rollbock</a> is a specialized type of bogie that is inserted under the wheels of a rail wagon/car, usually to convert for another <a href="track%20gauge">track gauge</a>. <a href="Transporter%20wagon">Transporter wagon</a>s carry the same concept to the level of a <a href="flatcar">flatcar</a> specialized to take other cars as its load.

In the case of archbar trucks or diamond frame bogies the <a href="List%20of%20railroad%20truck%20parts%23Truck%20side%20frame">side frames</a> are <a href="Metal%20fabrication">fabricated</a> rather than <a href="Cast%20steel">cast</a>.

<a href="Tram">Tram</a> bogies are much simpler in design because of their axle load, and the tighter curves found on tramways mean tram bogies almost never have more than two axles. Furthermore, some tramways have steeper gradients and vertical, as well as horizontal, curves, which means tram bogies often need to pivot on the horizontal axis, as well.

Some <a href="articulated%20tram">articulated tram</a>s have bogies located under articulations, a setup referred to as a <a href="Jacobs%20bogie">Jacobs bogie</a>. Often, <a href="low-floor%20tram">low-floor tram</a>s are fitted with nonpivoting bogies and many <a href="tramway%20enthusiast">tramway enthusiast</a>s see this as a retrograde step, as it leads to more wear of both track and wheels and also significantly reduces the speed at which a tram can round a curve.

In the past, many different types of bogie (truck) have been used under tramcars (e.g. <a href="J.%20G.%20Brill%20and%20Company">Brill</a>, Peckham, maximum traction). A maximum traction truck has one driving axle with large wheels and one nondriving axle with smaller wheels. The bogie pivot is located off-centre, so more than half the weight rests on the driving axle.

The retractable stadium roof on Toronto's <a href="Rogers%20Centre">Rogers Centre</a> used modified off-the-shelf train bogies on a circular rail. The system was chosen for its proven reliability.

<a href="Rubber-tyred%20metro">Rubber-tyred metro</a> trains use a specialised version of railway bogies. Special flanged steel wheels are behind the rubber-tired running wheels, with additional horizontal guide wheels in front of and behind the running wheels, as well. The unusually large flanges on the steel wheels guide the bogie through standard <a href="railroad%20switch">railroad switch</a>es, and in addition keep the train from <a href="derailment">derailing</a> in case the tires deflate.

To overcome <a href="break%20of%20gauge">breaks of gauge</a> some bogies are being fitted with <a href="variable%20gauge">variable gauge</a> axles (VGA) so that they can operate on two different gauges. These include the <a href="SUW%202000">SUW 2000</a> system from <a href="ZNTK%20Pozna%C5%84">ZNTK Poznań</a>.

The Cleminson system is not a true bogie, but serves a similar purpose. It was based on a patent of 1883 by James Cleminson, and was once popular on narrow-gauge rolling stock, e.g. on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man%20Railway%20rolling%20stock">Isle of Man</a> and <a href="Manx%20Northern%20Railway">Manx Northern Railway</a>s. The vehicle would have three axles and the outer two could pivot to adapt to curvature of the track. The pivoting was controlled by levers attached to the third (centre) axle, which could slide sideways.

Some <a href="tank">tank</a>s and other <a href="Caterpillar%20track">tracked</a> vehicles have bogies as external suspension components (see <a href="suspension%20%28vehicle%29%23Armoured%20fighting%20vehicle%20suspension">armoured fighting vehicle suspension</a>). This type of bogie usually has two or more road wheels and some type of sprung suspension to smooth the ride across rough terrain. Bogie suspensions keep much of their components on the outside of the vehicle, saving internal space. Although vulnerable to <a href="antitank">antitank</a> fire, they can often be repaired or replaced in the field.

An articulated bogie is any one of a number of <a href="bogie">bogie</a> designs that allow <a href="railway">railway</a> equipment to safely turn sharp corners, while reducing or eliminating the "screeching" normally associated with metal wheels rounding a bend in the rails. There are a number of such designs, and the term is also applied to train sets that incorporate articulation in the vehicle, as opposed to the bogies themselves.

If one considers a single bogie "up close", it resembles a small rail car with axles at either end. The same effect that causes the bogies to rub against the rails at longer radius causes each of the pairs of wheels to rub on the rails and cause the screeching. Articulated bogies add a second pivot point between the two axles to allow them to rotate to the correct angle even in these cases.

In <a href="Road%20transport%23Trucking%20and%20hauling">trucking</a>, a bogie is the subassembly of axles and wheels that supports a <a href="semi-trailer">semi-trailer</a>, whether permanently attached to the frame (as on a single trailer) or making up the <a href="dolly%20%28trailer%29">dolly</a> that can be hitched and unhitched as needed when hitching up a second or third semi-trailer (as when <a href="semi-trailer">pulling doubles</a> or <a href="road%20train">triples</a>).

British Steel (historic)

British Steel plc was a major British <a href="steel">steel</a> producer. It originated from the <a href="nationalization">nationalised</a> British Steel Corporation (BSC), formed in 1967 which was privatised as a public limited company, British Steel plc in 1988. It was once a constituent of the <a href="FTSE%20100%20Index">FTSE 100 Index</a>. The company merged with <a href="Koninklijke%20Hoogovens">Koninklijke Hoogovens</a> to form <a href="Corus%20Group">Corus Group</a> in 1999.

Alasdair M. Blair (1997), Professor of International Relations and Head of the Department of Politics and Public Policy at De Montfort University, has explored the history of British Steel since the Second World War to evaluate the impact of government intervention in a market economy. He suggests that entrepreneurship was lacking in the 1940s; the government could not persuade the industry to upgrade its plants. For generations the industry had followed a piecemeal growth pattern that proved inefficient in the face of world competition. The <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> came to power in 1945, committed to socialism. In 1946, it put the first steel development plan into practice with the aim of increasing capacity. It passed the <a href="Iron%20and%20Steel%20Act%201949">Iron and Steel Act 1949</a>, which meant nationalisation of the industry, as the government bought out the shareholders, and created the <a href="Iron%20and%20Steel%20Corporation%20of%20Great%20Britain">Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain</a>. American <a href="Marshall%20Plan">Marshall Plan</a> aid in 1948–50 reinforced modernisation efforts and provided funding for them. However, the nationalisation was reversed by the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> government after 1952.

The industry was again nationalised in 1967 under another Labour government, becoming British Steel Corporation (BSC). But by then, twenty years of political manipulation had left companies, such as British Steel, with serious problems: a complacency with existing equipment, plants operating below full capacity (hence the low efficiency), poor-quality assets, outdated technology, government price controls, higher coal and oil costs, lack of funds for capital improvement, and increasing competition in the world market.

By the 1970s the Labour government's main goal for the declining industry was to keep employment high. Since British Steel was a major employer in depressed regions, it was decided to keep many mills and facilities operating at a loss. In the 1980s, Conservative Prime Minister <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> re-privatised BSC as British Steel. Under private control, the company dramatically cut its work force and underwent a radical reorganisation and massive capital investment to again become competitive in the world marketplace.

BSC was formed from the assets of former private companies which had been nationalised, largely under the Labour government of <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, on 28 July 1967. Wilson's was the second attempt at nationalisation, <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>'s <a href="Iron%20and%20Steel%20Corporation%20of%20Great%20Britain">Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain</a> having been largely privatised by the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> governments of the 1950s. Only one steel company, <a href="Richard%20Thomas%20and%20Baldwins">Richard Thomas and Baldwins</a>, remained in public ownership throughout.

BSC was established under the <a href="Iron%20and%20Steel%20Act%201967">Iron and Steel Act 1967</a>, which vested in the Corporation the shares of the fourteen major UK-based steel companies then in operation, being:

At the time of its formation, BSC comprised around ninety percent of the UK's steelmaking capacity; it had around 268,500 employees and around 200 wholly or partly owned subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Africa, South Asia, and South America.

Dorman Long, South Durham and Stewarts and Lloyds had merged as British Steel and Tube Ltd before vesting took place. BSC later arranged an exchange deal with <a href="Guest%2C%20Keen%20and%20Nettlefolds">Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds</a> Ltd (GKN), the parent company of GKN Steel, under which BSC acquired <a href="Dowlais%20Ironworks">Dowlais Ironworks</a> at <a href="Merthyr%20Tydfil">Merthyr Tydfil</a> and GKN took over BSC's <a href="Brymbo%20Steelworks">Brymbo Steelworks</a> near <a href="Wrexham">Wrexham</a>.

According to Blair (1997), British Steel faced serious problems at the time of its formation, including obsolescent plants; plants operating under capacity and thus at low efficiency; outdated technology; price controls that reduced marketing flexibility; soaring coal and oil costs; lack of capital investment funds; and increasing competition on the world market. By the 1970s, the government adopted a policy of keeping employment artificially high in the declining industry. This especially impacted BSC since it was a major employer in a number of depressed regions.

One of the arguments aired in favour of nationalisation was that it would enable steel production to be rationalised. This involved concentrating investment on major integrated plants, placed near the coast for ease of access by sea, and closing older, smaller plants, especially those that had been located inland for proximity to coal supplies.

From the mid-1970s the (now loss-making) British Steel, pursued a strategy of concentrating steelmaking in five areas: South Wales, <a href="South%20Yorkshire">South Yorkshire</a>, <a href="Scunthorpe">Scunthorpe</a>, <a href="Teesside">Teesside</a> and <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. This policy continued following the Conservative victory in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201979">1979 general election</a>. Other traditional steelmaking areas faced cutbacks. Under the Labour government of <a href="James%20Callaghan">James Callaghan</a>, a review by Lord Beswick had led to the reprieve of the so-called 'Beswick plants', for social reasons, but subsequent governments were obliged under EU rules to withdraw subsidies. Major changes resulted across Europe, including in the UK:


British Steel was <a href="privatization">privatised</a> in 1988 by the Conservative government of <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>. It merged with the <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> steel producer "Koninklijke Hoogovens" to form <a href="Tata%20Steel%20Europe">Corus Group</a> on 6 October 1999. Corus itself was taken over in March 2007 by the Indian steel operator <a href="Tata%20Steel">Tata Steel</a>.


Ian MacGregor later became famous for his role as Chairman of the <a href="National%20Coal%20Board">National Coal Board</a> during the <a href="UK%20miners%27%20strike%20%281984%E2%80%931985%29">UK miners' strike (1984–1985)</a>. During the strike the "<a href="Battle%20of%20Orgreave">Battle of Orgreave</a>" took place at British Steel's coking plant.

In 1971 British Steel sponsored Sir <a href="Chay%20Blyth">Chay Blyth</a> in his record-making non-stop <a href="circumnavigation">circumnavigation</a> against the winds and currents, known as 'The Impossible Voyage'. In 1992 they sponsored the <a href="Global%20Challenge">British Steel Challenge</a>, the first of a series of 'wrong way' races for amateur crews.

British Steel had agreed a sponsorship deal with <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough Football Club</a> during the <a href="1994-95%20in%20English%20football">1994–95 season</a>, with a view to British Steel-sponsored Middlesbrough shirts making their appearance <a href="1995-96%20in%20English%20football">the following season</a>. But the sponsorship deal was terminated before it commenced after it was revealed that <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> steel only made up a tiny fraction of steel used in construction of the stadium, and that the bulk of the steel had been imported from <a href="Germany">Germany</a>.

BT Group

BT Group plc (<a href="doing%20business%20as">trading as</a> BT) is a <a href="holding%20company">holding company</a> which owns British Telecommunications plc, a British <a href="Multinational%20corporation">multinational</a> <a href="telecommunication">telecommunication</a>s company with head offices in London, <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. It has operations in around 180 countries and is the largest provider of <a href="Landline">fixed-line</a>, <a href="Mobile%20phone">mobile</a> and <a href="Internet%20access">broadband</a> services in the UK, and also provides <a href="Pay%20television">subscription television</a> and <a href="Information%20technology">IT services</a>.

BT's origins date back to the founding of the <a href="Electric%20Telegraph%20Company">Electric Telegraph Company</a> in 1846 which developed a nationwide communications network. In 1912, the <a href="General%20Post%20Office">General Post Office</a>, a government department, became the monopoly telecoms supplier in the United Kingdom. The Post Office Act of 1969 led to the GPO becoming a public corporation. British Telecommunications, trading as "British Telecom", was formed in 1980, and became independent of the Post Office in 1981. British Telecommunications was privatised in 1984, becoming "British Telecommunications plc", with some 50 percent of its shares sold to investors. The Government sold its remaining stake in further share sales in 1991 and 1993. BT has a primary listing on the <a href="London%20Stock%20Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a>, a secondary listing on the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a>, and is a constituent of the <a href="FTSE%20100%20Index">FTSE 100 Index</a>.

BT controls a number of large subsidiaries. <a href="BT%20Global%20Services">BT Global Services</a> division supplies telecoms services to corporate and government customers worldwide, and its <a href="BT%20Consumer">BT Consumer</a> division supplies <a href="telephony">telephony</a>, <a href="internet%20access">broadband</a>, and <a href="pay%20television">subscription television</a> services in Great Britain to around 18 million customers. BT announced in February 2015 that it had agreed to acquire <a href="EE%20Limited">EE</a> for £12.5 billion, and received final regulatory approval from the <a href="Competition%20and%20Markets%20Authority">Competition and Markets Authority</a> on 15 January 2016. The transaction was completed on 29 January 2016.

BT's origins date back to the establishment of the first telecommunications companies in Britain. Among them was the first commercial <a href="Telegraphy">telegraph service</a>, the <a href="Electric%20Telegraph%20Company">Electric Telegraph Company</a>, established in 1846. As these companies amalgamated and were taken over or collapsed, the remaining companies were transferred to <a href="Government-owned%20corporation">state control</a> under the <a href="General%20Post%20Office">Post Office</a> in 1912. These companies were merged and <a href="Rebranding">rebranded</a> as British Telecom.

In January 1878 <a href="Alexander%20Graham%20Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a> demonstrated his recently developed telephone to <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> at <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne House</a> on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>. A few days later the first telephone in Britain was installed, under licence from the General Post Office, by engineers from David Moseley and Sons, to connect the Dantzic Street premises of <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> hardware merchant, Mr. John Hudson, with his other premises in nearby Shudehill. As the number of installed telephones across the country grew it became sensible to consider constructing telephone exchanges to allow all the telephones in each city to be connected together. The first exchange was opened in London in August 1879, closely followed by the Lancashire Telephonic Exchange in Manchester. From 1878, the telephone service in Britain was provided by private sector companies such as the <a href="National%20Telephone%20Company">National Telephone Company</a>, and later by the General Post Office. In 1896, the National Telephone Company was taken over by the General Post Office. In 1912 it became the primary supplier of telecommunications services, after the Post Office took over the private sector telephone service in GB, except for a few local authority services. Those services all folded within a few years, the sole exception being <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Kingston upon Hull</a>, where the telephone department became present day <a href="KCOM%20Group">KCOM Group</a>.

Converting the Post Office into a nationalised industry, as opposed to a governmental department, was first discussed in 1932 by Lord Wolmer. In 1932 the Bridgeman Committee produced a report that was rejected. In 1961, more proposals were ignored. The Post Office remained a department of central government, with the <a href="Postmaster%20General%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Postmaster General</a> sitting in <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Cabinet</a> as a <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Secretary of State</a>.

In March 1965, <a href="Tony%20Benn">Tony Benn</a>, the acting <a href="Postmaster%20General%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Postmaster General</a>, wrote to <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, the Prime Minister, proposing that studies be undertaken aimed at converting the Post Office into a <a href="State%20ownership">nationalised industry</a>. A committee was set up to look into the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal, and its findings were found to be favourable enough for the Government to re-establish a Steering Group on the Organisation of the Post Office. After some initial deliberations that the business should be divided into five divisions; <a href="General%20Post%20Office">Post</a>, Telecommunications, <a href="National%20Savings%20and%20Investments">Saving</a>s, <a href="Girobank">Giro</a> and National Data Processing Services, it was decided that there should be two: "Post" and "Telecommunications". These events finally resulted in the introduction of the Post Office Act, 1969.

On 1 October 1969, under the Post Office Act of 1969, the Post Office ceased to be a government department and it became established as a <a href="Public%20company">public corporation</a>. The Act gave the Post Office the exclusive privilege of operating telecommunications systems with listed powers to authorise others to run such systems. Effectively, the General Post Office retained its telecommunications monopoly.

In 1977, the Carter Committee Report recommended a further division of the two main services and for their relocation under two individual corporations. The findings contained in the report led to the renaming of <a href="Post%20Office%20Telecommunications">Post Office Telecommunications</a> as British Telecommunications (trading as British Telecom) in 1980, although it remained part of the Post Office.

The <a href="British%20Telecommunications%20Act%201981">British Telecommunications Act 1981</a> transferred the responsibility for telecommunications services from the Post Office, creating two separate corporations, <a href="Post%20Office%20Ltd.">Post Office Ltd.</a> and British Telecommunications. At this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into British telecommunications industry. In particular, the Act empowered the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, as well as British Telecommunications, to license other operators to run public telecommunications systems. Additionally, a framework was established which enabled the Secretary of State to set standards with the <a href="British%20Standards%20Institution">British Standards Institution</a> (BSI) for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties, and had the effect of requiring British Telecommunications to connect approved apparatus to its systems. The Secretary of State made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market, where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in 1981. In 1982, a licence was granted to Cable & Wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary, <a href="Mercury%20Communications%20Ltd">Mercury Communications Ltd</a>.

On 19 July 1982, the Government formally announced its intention to privatise British Telecommunications with the sale of up to 51% of the company's shares to private investors. This intention was confirmed by the passing of the <a href="Telecommunications%20Act%201984">Telecommunications Act 1984</a>, which received Royal Assent on 12 April that year. The transfer to British Telecommunications plc of the business of British Telecommunications, the statutory corporation, took place on 6 August 1984 and, on 20 November 1984, more than 50 per cent of British Telecommunications shares were sold to the public. At the time, this was the largest share issue in the world.

The new legislation was intended to enable British Telecommunications to become more responsive to competition in GB and to expand its operations globally. Commercial freedom granted to British Telecommunications allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and, if it so decided, to engage in the manufacture of its own apparatus. The company's transfer into the private sector continued in December 1991 when the Government sold around half its remaining holding of 47.6% of shares, reducing its stake to 21.8%. Substantially all the government's remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in July 1993, raising £5 billion for the Treasury and introducing 750,000 new shareholders to the company.

The 1984 Act also abolished British Telecommunications's exclusive privilege of running telecommunications systems and established a framework to safeguard the workings of competition. This meant that British Telecommunications finally lost its monopoly in running telecommunications systems, which it had technically retained under the 1981 Act despite the Secretary of State's licensing powers. It now required a licence in the same way as any other telecommunications operator. The principal licence granted to British Telecommunications laid down strict and extensive conditions affecting the range of its activities, including those of manufacture and supply of apparatus.

In 1985, <a href="Cellnet">Cellnet</a> was launched as a subsidiary of Telecom Securicor Cellular Radio Limited, a 60:40 venture between British Telecommunications and <a href="G4S">Securicor</a> respectively. Securicor originally invested £4 million in Cellnet in 1983. In 1999, BT purchased Securicor's shares in Cellnet for £3.15 billion. The company was later rebranded as BT Cellnet, and became a part of BT Wireless, a group of subsidiary companies owned by BT.

The next major development for British Telecommunications, and a move towards a more open market in telecommunications, occurred in 1991. On 5 March, the Government's <a href="White%20Paper">White Paper</a>, "Competition and Choice: Telecommunications Policy" for the 1990s, was issued. In effect, it ended the duopoly which had been shared by British Telecommunications and <a href="Mercury%20Communications">Mercury Communications</a> in the UK since November 1983 and the build-up to privatisation. The new policy enabled customers to acquire telecommunications services from competing providers using a variety of technologies. Independent "retail" companies were permitted to bulk-buy telecommunications capacity and sell it in packages to business and domestic users. The White Paper was endorsed by British Telecommunications, the new policy enabling the company to compete freely and more effectively by offering flexible pricing packages to meet the needs of different types of customer.

On 2 April 1991, the company started using a new trading name, BT, and branding.

In June 1994, BT and <a href="MCI%20Communications">MCI Communication Corporation</a>, the second largest carrier of long distance telecommunications services in the United States, launched <a href="Concert%20Communications%20Services">Concert Communications Services</a>, a $1 billion joint venture company. This alliance gave BT and MCI a global network for providing end-to-end connectivity for advanced business services. Concert was the first company to provide a single-source broad portfolio of global communications services for multinational customers. On 3 November 1996, BT and MCI announced they had entered into a merger agreement to create a global telecommunications company called Concert plc, to be incorporated in GB, with headquarters in both <a href="London">London</a> and <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> As part of the alliance BT acquired a 20% holding in MCI. Nevertheless, following US carrier <a href="WorldCom">WorldCom</a>'s rival bid for MCI on 1 October 1997, BT ultimately decided in November, to sell its stake in MCI to WorldCom for $7 billion. The deal with WorldCom resulted in a profit of more than $2 billion on BT's original investment in MCI, with an additional $465 million severance fee for the break-up of the proposed merger.

In December 2000, following modifications to BT's licence in April 2000, BT offered <a href="local%20loop%20unbundling">local loop unbundling</a> (LLU) to other telecommunications operators, enabling them to use BT's copper local loops (the connection between the customer's premises and the exchange) to connect directly with their customers.

Following the <a href="dot%20com%20crash">dot com crash</a>, the group undertook a board restructuring and asset sale to address its large debts. In May 2001, BT announced a three-for-ten rights issue to raise £5.9 billion—still GB's largest ever rights issue—and the sale of <a href="Yell%20Group">Yell Group</a>, the international directories and associated e-commerce business, for £2.14 billion. Both activities were completed in June 2001. The group also sold its property portfolio to <a href="Telereal%20Trillium">Telereal</a>, a property company.

BT renamed its BT Wireless division as <a href="O2%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">O2</a> in September 2001, and confirmed it planned to demerge the unit in November that year. Shareholders approved the demerger at an <a href="extraordinary%20general%20meeting">extraordinary general meeting</a> held in Birmingham in October 2001, with 4.297 billion British Telecommunications shares voted in favour, and 0.67 million voted against. BT Wireless demerged in 2001, and was relaunched on 18 June 2002 as O2. O2 was acquired by <a href="Telef%C3%B3nica">Telefónica</a> in 2005.

In April 2003, BT unveiled its current corporate identity, known as the "Connected World", and brand values. Reflecting the aspirations of a technologically innovative future, the connected world is designed to embody BT's five corporate values: trustworthy, helpful, inspiring, straightforward, heart. The globe device part of the logo was originally designed by the <a href="Wolff%20Olins">Wolff Olins</a> brand consultancy for BT's <a href="Concert%20Communications%20Services">Concert</a> joint venture with <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Corporation">AT&T</a>, and was subsequently used by BT's internet division, Openworld, prior to being adopted by the company as a whole.

The Communications Act, 2003, which came into force on 25 July 2003, introduced a new industry regulator, the Office of Communications (<a href="Ofcom">Ofcom</a>), to replace the Office of Telecommunications (<a href="Oftel">Oftel</a>). It also introduced a new regulatory framework. The licensing regime was replaced by a general authorisation for companies to provide telecommunications services subject to general conditions of entitlement and, in some instances, specific conditions. Under a specific condition BT retained its universal service obligation (USO) for GB, excluding the Hull area. The USO included connecting consumers to the fixed telephone network, schemes for consumers with special social needs, and the provision of call box services.

In the summer of 2004, BT launched Consult 21, an industry consultation for BT's 21st century network (21CN) programme. <a href="21CN">21CN</a> is a next-generation network transformation, that, at one time, was due for completion by the end of 2010. Using internet protocol technology, 21CN will replace the existing networks and communications from any device such as mobile phone, PC, PDA, or home phone, to any other device.

In 2004, BT was awarded the contract to deliver and manage N3, a secure and fast broadband network for the <a href="NHS%20National%20Programme%20for%20IT">NHS National Programme for IT</a> (NPfIT) program, on behalf of the <a href="English%20National%20Health%20Service">English National Health Service</a> (NHS).

In 2005 BT made a number of important acquisitions. In February 2005, BT acquired Infonet (now re-branded BT Infonet), a large telecoms company based in <a href="El%20Segundo%2C%20California">El Segundo, California</a>, giving BT access to new geographies. It also acquired the second largest telecoms operator in the Italian business market, Albacom. Then in April 2005, it bought Radianz from Reuters (now rebranded as BT Radianz), which expanded BT's coverage and provided BT with more buying power in certain countries.

In August 2006, BT acquired online electrical retailer <a href="Dabs.com">Dabs.com</a> for £30.6 million. The <a href="BT%20Home%20Hub">BT Home Hub</a> manufactured by <a href="Inventel">Inventel</a> was also launched in June 2006.

In October 2006, BT confirmed that it would be investing 75% of its total capital spending, put at £10 billion over five years, in its new <a href="Internet%20Protocol">Internet Protocol</a> (IP) based <a href="BT%2021CN">21st century network</a> (21CN). Annual savings of £1 billion per annum were expected when the transition to the new network was to have been completed in 2010, with over 50% of its customers to have been transferred by 2008. (For actual progress see <a href="BT%2021CN">BT 21CN</a>). That month the first customers on to 21CN was successfully tested at <a href="Adastral%20Park">Adastral Park</a> in Suffolk.

In January 2007, BT acquired Sheffield-based ISP, <a href="PlusNet">PlusNet</a> plc, adding 200,000 customers. BT stated that PlusNet will continue to operate separately out of its Sheffield head-office. On 1 February 2007, BT announced agreed terms to acquire International Network Services Inc. (INS), an international provider of IT consultancy and software. This increases BT presence in North America enhancing BT's consulting capabilities.

On 20 February 2007, Sir Michael Rake, then chairman of accountancy firm <a href="KPMG">KPMG</a> International, succeeded Sir Christopher Bland, who stepped down in September of that year. On 20 April 2007, BT acquired <a href="COMSAT">COMSAT</a> International which provides network services to the South American corporate market. On 1 October 2007, BT purchased Chesterfield based Lynx Technology which has been trading since 1973.

BT acquired Wire One Communications in June 2008 and folded the company into "BT Conferencing", its existing conferencing unit, as a new video business unit
In July 2008, BT acquired the online business directory firm Ufindus for £20 million in order to expand its position in the local information market in GB. On 28 July 2008, BT acquired <a href="Ribbit%20%28telecommunications%20company%29">Ribbit</a>, of <a href="Mountain%20View%2C%20California">Mountain View, California</a>, "Silicon Valley's First Phone Company". Ribbit provides <a href="Adobe%20Flash">Adobe Flash</a>/<a href="Adobe%20Flex">Flex</a> APIs, allowing web developers to incorporate telephony features into their <a href="software%20as%20a%20service">software as a service</a> (SaaS) applications.

In the early days of its fibre broadband rollout, BT said it would deliver fibre-to-the-premises (<a href="FTTP">FTTP</a>) to around 25% of the Country, with the rest catered for by the slower fibre-to-the-cabinet (FTTC), which uses copper wiring to deliver the final stretch of the connection. In 2014, with less than 0.7% of the company's fibre network being FTTP, BT dropped the 25% target, saying that it was "far less relevant today" because of improvements made to the headline speed of FTTC, which had doubled to 80Mbit/s since its fibre broadband rollout was first announced. To supplement FTTC, BT offered an 'FTTP on Demand' product. In January 2015, BT stopped taking orders for the on-demand product.

On 1 April 2009, BT Engage IT was created from the merger of two previous BT acquisitions, Lynx Technology and Basilica. Apart from the name change not much else changed in operations for another 12 months. On 14 May 2009, BT said it was cutting up to 15,000 jobs in the coming year after it announced its results for the year to 31 March 2009. Then in July 2009, BT offered workers a long holiday for an up front sum of 25% of their annual wage or a one-off payment of £1000 if they agree to go part-time.

On 6 April 2011, BT launched the first online <a href="not-for-profit">not-for-profit</a> fundraising service for <a href="United%20Kingdom">UK</a> charities called <a href="BT%20MyDonate">BT MyDonate</a> as part of its investment to the community. The service will pass on 100% of all donations made through the site to the charity, and unlike <a href="Comparison%20of%20online%20charity%20donation%20services%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">other services</a> which take a proportion as commission and charge charities for using their services, BT will only pass on credit/debit card charges for each donation. The service allows people to register to give money to charity or collect fundraising donations. BT developed MyDonate with the support of <a href="Cancer%20Research%20UK">Cancer Research UK</a>, <a href="Changing%20Faces%20%28charity%29">Changing Faces</a>, <a href="KidsOut">KidsOut</a>, <a href="National%20Society%20for%20the%20Prevention%20of%20Cruelty%20to%20Children">NSPCC</a> and <a href="Women%27s%20Aid%20Federation%20of%20England">Women's Aid</a>.

In March 2013, BT was allocated 4G spectrum in the UK following an auction and assignment by Ofcom, after paying £201.5m.

On 1 August 2013, BT launched its first television channels, <a href="BT%20Sport">BT Sport</a>, to compete with rival broadcaster <a href="Sky%20Sports">Sky Sports</a>. Plans for the channels' launch came about when it was announced in June 2012 that BT had been awarded a package of broadcast rights for the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> from the 2013–14 to 2015–16 season, broadcasting 38 matches from each season. In February 2013, BT acquired <a href="ESPN%20Inc.">ESPN Inc.</a>'s UK and Ireland TV channels, continuing its expansion into sports broadcasting. <a href="ESPN%20America">ESPN America</a> and <a href="ESPN%20Classic%20%28UK%29">ESPN Classic</a> were both closed, while <a href="ESPN%20%28UK%29">ESPN</a> continued to be operated by BT. On 9 November 2013, BT announced it had acquired exclusive rights to the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a> and <a href="Europa%20League">Europa League</a> for £897m, from the 2015 season, with some free games remaining including both finals.

On 1 November 2014, BT created a new central business services (CBS) organisation to provide customer services and improve operational efficiency levels.

On 24 November 2014, shares in BT rose considerably on the announcement that the company were in talks to buy back O2; while at the same time BT confirmed that it had been approached by <a href="EE%20Limited">EE</a> to also buy that company. BT confirmed on 15 December 2014 that it had entered into exclusive talks to buy EE. BT confirmed on 5 February 2015 that it had agreed to buy EE for £12.5 billion, subject to regulatory approval. The deal will combine BT's 10 million retail customers and EE's 24.5 million direct mobile subscribers. <a href="Deutsche%20Telekom">Deutsche Telekom</a> will own 12% of BT, while <a href="Orange%20S.A.">Orange S.A.</a> will own 4%.

In March 2015, launched a 4G service as <a href="BT%20Mobile">BT Mobile</a> BT Group CEO <a href="Gavin%20Patterson">Gavin Patterson</a> announced that BT plans to migrate all of its customers onto the IP network by 2025, switching off the company's <a href="ISDN">ISDN</a> network.

On 15 January 2016, BT received final unconditional approval by the <a href="Competition%20and%20Markets%20Authority">Competition and Markets Authority</a> to acquire <a href="EE%20Limited">EE</a>. The deal was officially completed on 29 January 2016 with <a href="Deutsche%20Telekom">Deutsche Telekom</a> now owning 12% of BT, while <a href="Orange%20S.A.">Orange S.A.</a> own 4%.

On 1 February 2016, BT announced a new organisational structure that will take effect from April 2016 following the successful acquisition of <a href="EE%20Limited">EE</a>. The EE brand, network and high street stores will be retained and will become a second consumer division, operating alongside <a href="BT%20Consumer">BT Consumer</a>. It will serve customers with mobile services, broadband and TV and will continue to deliver the Emergency Services Network contract which was awarded to EE in late 2015. There will be a new BT Business and Public Sector division that will have around £5bn of revenues and will serve small and large businesses as well as the public sector in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">UK</a> and <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a>. It will comprise the existing <a href="BT%20Business">BT Business</a> division along with EE's business division and those parts of <a href="BT%20Global%20Services">BT Global Services</a> that are UK focused. There will also be another new division; BT Wholesale and Ventures that will comprise the existing <a href="BT%20Wholesale">BT Wholesale</a> division along with EE's <a href="Mobile%20virtual%20network%20operator">MVNO</a> business as well as some specialist businesses such as Fleet, Payphones and Directories. Gerry McQuade, currently Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Business at EE, will be its CEO.

On 11 February 2016, BT announced they will be launching a new free service later in 2016 to divert nuisance calls within its network before they ring on customers' phones and will use huge computing power to root out 25 million unwanted calls a week. BT customers can currently purchase special phones that will allow them to block nuisance calls or pay to stop calls getting through. However, the new service will identify some of the 5 billion unwanted calls made each year before they arrive, which will then be diverted automatically to a junk voicemail box. BT customers will also be able to add numbers they don't want to hear from to the blacklist, for free.

On 8 June 2017, BT appointed <a href="KPMG">KPMG</a> as its new auditor to replace <a href="PwC">PwC</a> in the wake of the fraud scandal in Italy that triggered a major profit warning earlier this year. In last April, KPMG fired six US employees over a scandal that calls into question efforts to ensure that public company accounts are being properly scrutinised.

On 8 July 2017, <a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a> reported that BT "has called in consultants from <a href="McKinsey">McKinsey</a> to conduct a review of its businesses in the hope of saving hundreds of millions of pounds per year. The work, dubbed 'Project Novator', is understood to include a potential merger of BT’s struggling global services corporate networking and IT unit with its business and public sector division". The word <a href="Novator">Novator</a> is quite widely used so it does not necessarily imply a connection with any company using that name.

BT Group is a <a href="holding%20company">holding company</a>; the majority of its businesses and assets are held by its wholly owned subsidiary British Telecommunications plc. BT's businesses are operated under special government regulation by the British telecoms regulator <a href="Ofcom">Ofcom</a> (formerly <a href="Oftel">Oftel</a>). BT has been found to have significant market power in some markets following market reviews by Ofcom. In these markets, BT is required to comply with additional obligations such as meeting reasonable requests to supply services and not to discriminate.

BT runs the <a href="telephone%20exchange">telephone exchange</a>s, trunk network and <a href="local%20loop">local loop</a> connections for the vast majority of British fixed-line telephones. Currently BT is responsible for approximately 28 million telephone lines in GB. Apart from <a href="KCOM%20Group">KCOM Group</a>, which serves Kingston upon Hull, BT is the only UK telecoms operator to have a "<a href="Universal%20service">Universal Service Obligation</a>," (USO) which means it must provide a fixed telephone line to any address in the UK. It is also obliged to provide public call boxes.

As well as continuing to provide service in those traditional areas in which BT has an obligation to provide services or is closely regulated, BT has expanded into more profitable products and services where there is less regulation. These are principally, broadband internet service and <a href="bespoke">bespoke</a> solutions in telecommunications and information technology.

BT Group's world headquarters and <a href="registered%20office">registered office</a> is the BT Centre, a 10-storey office building at 81 Newgate Street in the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>, opposite <a href="St.%20Paul%27s%20tube%20station">St. Paul's tube station</a>.

BT Group is organised into the following divisions:


<a href="Openreach">Openreach</a> was established following the Telecommunications Strategic Review carried out by Ofcom. BT signed legally binding undertakings with Ofcom in September 2005 to help create a new regulatory framework for BT and the British telecoms industry generally. Openreach commenced operations on 11 January 2006, with 25,000 engineers previously employed by BT's Retail and Wholesale divisions. It provides provision and repair in the "<a href="last%20mile">last mile</a>" of copper wire and is designed to ensure that other communications providers (CPs) have exactly the same operational conditions as parts of the BT Group.

BT's financial results have been as follows:
As the data above suggests that BT's revenues have been more or less static over a period of last 16 years.

BT has the largest <a href="defined%20benefit%20pension%20plan">defined benefit pension plan</a> of any UK public company. The trustees valued the scheme at £36.7 billion at the end of 2010; an actuarial valuation valued the deficit of the scheme at £9.043 billion as of 31 December 2008.
Following a change in the regulations governing inflation index linking, the deficit was estimated at £5.2 billion in November 2010.

BT sponsored Scotland's domestic <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> championship and cup competitions between 1999 and 2006.

On 31 July 2012, it was announced that BT agreed a three-year sponsorship deal with <a href="Ulster%20Rugby">Ulster Rugby</a> and sees BT become the Official Communications Partner. BT's logo will appear on the Ulster Rugby shirt sleeve for all friendlies, <a href="Heineken%20Cup">Heineken Cup</a> and <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20Pro12">RaboDirect Pro12</a> matches as well as a significant brand presence at their home ground; <a href="Ravenhill%20Stadium">Ravenhill Stadium</a>.

On 29 July 2013, it was announced that BT had partnered up with <a href="Scottish%20Rugby%20Union">Scottish Rugby Union</a> in a four-year sponsorship deal with its two professional clubs; <a href="Edinburgh%20Rugby">Edinburgh Rugby</a> and <a href="Glasgow%20Warriors">Glasgow Warriors</a> that will commence from August 2013. The deal involves <a href="BT%20Sport">BT Sport</a> becoming the new shirt sponsor for both clubs as well as being promoted with BT Group at their respective home grounds; <a href="Scotstoun%20Stadium">Scotstoun Stadium</a> and <a href="Murrayfield%20Stadium">Murrayfield Stadium</a>.

On 28 May 2014, it was announced that BT agreed a £20 million four-year sponsorship deal with <a href="Scottish%20Rugby%20Union">Scottish Rugby Union</a> which includes BT securing the naming rights for <a href="Murrayfield%20Stadium">Murrayfield Stadium</a> which becomes BT Murrayfield Stadium, become sponsor of the Scotland sevens team, become principal and exclusive sponsor of Scotland's domestic league and cup competitions from next season, taking over the role from <a href="The%20Royal%20Bank%20of%20Scotland%20Group">The Royal Bank of Scotland Group</a> (RBS), and become sponsor of Scottish Rugby's four new academies that aims to drive forward standards for young players who have aspirations to play professionally.

On 14 April 2015, it was announced that as part of BT's current £20 million four-year sponsorship deal with <a href="Scottish%20Rugby%20Union">Scottish Rugby Union</a> that was announced in May 2014, BT has completed its sponsorship portfolio following an additional investment of £3.6 million for the 3 years remaining of its sponsorship deal, to become the new shirt sponsor for the Scotland national teams.

On 27 January 2016, it was announced that BT, alongside <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> will be the new joint headline sponsors in a three-year deal with <a href="Edinburgh%20International%20Television%20Festival">Edinburgh International Television Festival</a>. The two companies will "share prominence across all branding of the 41st TV Festival, including the famous <a href="Edinburgh_International_Television_Festival%23The_MacTaggart_Lecture">MacTaggart Lecture</a> and will work closely with the festival organisers in their bid to reflect new trends in a rapidly transforming industry, from new ways of distributing content to technical innovations such as <a href="Virtual%20Reality">Virtual Reality</a>".

BT is the founding and principal partner of the <a href="Wayne%20Rooney">Wayne Rooney</a> Foundation, which was established to improve the lives of children and young people. The Foundation will run events "to raise vital funds to support the work of key organisations dedicated to supporting disadvantaged and vulnerable children and young people". These organisations are four chosen charities which are, Manchester United Foundation, <a href="National%20Society%20for%20the%20Prevention%20of%20Cruelty%20to%20Children">NSPCC</a>, <a href="Claire%20House%20Children%27s%20Hospice">Claire House Children's Hospice</a> and <a href="Alder%20Hey%20Children%27s%20Hospital">Alder Hey Children's Hospital</a>. The first of these events was Wayne’s <a href="testimonial%20match">testimonial match</a> in August 2016 between <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United F.C.</a> and <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton F.C.</a> which raised £1.2 million. The match was screened live through <a href="BT%20Sport">BT Sport</a> with <a href="BT%20MyDonate">BT MyDonate</a> being the official fundraising platform for the testimonial, with both online and text options for donations promoted during the match.

On 26 May 2017, it was announced that BT is to sponsor the 2017 <a href="British%20Urban%20Film%20Festival">British Urban Film Festival</a> (BUFF) and sees BT host every event of the film festival, including the Awards at the <a href="BT%20Tower">BT Tower</a>. BT will also broadcast the awards ceremony on BT.com and will have the opportunity to screen films acquired from the festival on its <a href="BT%20TV">BT TV</a> store platform.

In 2004 the BT Group signed the world's largest renewable energy deal with <a href="npower%20%28UK%29">npower</a> and <a href="Centrica">British Gas</a>, and now all of their exchanges, satellite networks and offices are powered by renewable energy. BT is a member of the Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change. They signed a letter urging the government to do more to tackle this problem. Janet Blake, head of global <a href="corporate%20social%20responsibility">corporate social responsibility</a> at BT, says that she would like to see incentives that find ways of rewarding those companies that focus on climate change by making investments in green business models.

BT has made it clear that it has an ambitious plan to reduce <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> emissions. Its strategy includes steps to reduce the company's carbon footprint as well as those of customers, suppliers and employees. BT has actually pledged to achieve an 80% reduction by the year 2016, which will require further efficiency improvements.

BT have been accused of abusing their control of Openreach, underinvesting in the UK's broadband infrastructure, charging high prices and providing poor customer service. Openreach's services receive hundreds of thousands of complaints on an annual basis.

Between 2010 and 2012 the UK intelligence community initiated an investigation aimed at <a href="Huawei">Huawei</a>, the foreign supplier of BT's new fibre infrastructure with increasing urgency after the USA, Canada and Australia prevented the company from operating in their countries. Although BT had notified the UK government in 2003 of Huawei's interest in their £10b network upgrade contract, they did not raise the security implications as BT failed to explain that the Chinese company would have unfettered access to critical infrastructure. On 16 December 2012 David Cameron was supplied with an in-depth report indicating that the intelligence services had very grave doubts regarding Huawei, and that the UK governmental, military, business community and private citizen's privacy may be under serious threat. Subsequently, BT's Infinity program and other projects are now under urgent review.

On 7 June 2013, British lawmakers concluded that BT should never have allowed the Chinese company access to the UK's critical communications network without ministerial oversight, saying they were 'deeply shocked' that BT did not inform government that they were allowing Huawei and ZTE, both foreign entities with ties to the Chinese military, unfettered access to critical national systems. Furthermore, ministers discovered that the agency with the responsibility to ensure Chinese equipment and code was threat-free was entirely staffed by Huawei employees. Subsequently, parliamentarians confirmed that in case of an attack on the UK there was nothing at this point that could be done to stop Chinese infiltration attacking critical national infrastructure.

<a href="ZTE">ZTE</a>, another Chinese company that supplies extensive network equipment and subscriber hardware to BT Infinity, was also under scrutiny by parliament's intelligence and security committee according to a report in the Guardian on Wednesday 10 October 2012 after the US, Canada, Australia and the European Union declared the company a security risk to its citizens.

In 2001, BT discovered it owned a patent () which it believed gave it patent rights on the use of <a href="hyperlink">hyperlink</a> technology on the <a href="World%20Wide%20Web">World Wide Web</a>. The corresponding UK patent had already expired, but the US patent was valid until 2006. On 11 February 2002, BT began a court case relating to its claims in a US federal court against the <a href="Internet%20service%20provider">Internet service provider</a> <a href="Prodigy%20%28ISP%29">Prodigy Communications Corporation</a>. In the case "<a href="British%20Telecommunications%20plc%20v.%20Prodigy">British Telecommunications plc v. Prodigy</a>", the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York">United States District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> ruled on 22 August 2002 that the BT patent was not applicable to web technology and granted Prodigy's request for <a href="summary%20judgment">summary judgment</a> of non-infringement.

In early 2008 it was announced that BT had entered into a contract (along with <a href="Virgin%20Media">Virgin Media</a> and <a href="TalkTalk%20Group">TalkTalk</a>) with the <a href="spyware">spyware</a> company <a href="Phorm">Phorm</a> (responsible under their 121Media guise for the Apropos <a href="rootkit">rootkit</a>) to intercept and analyse their users' click-stream data and sell the anonymised aggregate information as part of Phorm's OIX advertising service. The practice, known as "<a href="behavioural%20targeting">behavioural targeting</a>" and condemned by critics as "data pimping", came under intense fire from various internet communities and other interested-parties who believe that the interception of data without the consent of users and web site owners is illegal under UK law (RIPA). At a more fundamental level, many have argued that the ISPs and Phorm have no right to sell a commodity (a user's data, and the copyright content of web sites) to which they have no claim of ownership. In response to questions about Phorm and the interception of data by the Webwise system Sir <a href="Tim%20Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>, credited as the creator of the World Wide Web protocol, indicated his disapproval of the concept and is quoted as saying of his data and web history:

In September 2012, BT entered into a $23 million deal with the US military to provide a key communications cable connecting <a href="RAF%20Croughton">RAF Croughton</a>, a US military base on UK soil, with <a href="Camp%20Lemonnier">Camp Lemonnier</a>, a large US base in Djibouti. Camp Lemonnier is used as a base for American drone attacks in Yemen and Somalia, and has been described by "The Economist" as "the most important base for drone operations outside the war zone of Afghanistan."

Human rights groups including <a href="Reprieve%20%28organisation%29">Reprieve</a> and <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a> have criticised the use of armed drones outside declared war zones. Evidence produced by <a href="The%20Bureau%20of%20Investigative%20Journalism">The Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a> and <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a>'s International Human Rights & Conflict Resolution Clinic suggest that drone strikes have caused substantial civilian casualties, and may be illegal under international law.

In 2013, BT was the subject of a complaint by <a href="Reprieve%20%28organisation%29">Reprieve</a> to the <a href="Department%20of%20Business%2C%20Innovation%20and%20Skills">Department of Business, Innovation and Skills</a> under the <a href="OECD%20Guidelines%20for%20Multinational%20Enterprises">OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises</a>, following their refusal to explain whether or not their infrastructure was used to facilitate drone strikes. The subsequent refusal of this complaint was appealed in May 2014, on the basis that the UK National Contact Point's decision did not follow the OECD Guidelines. The issue of bias was also raised, due to the appointment of Lord Ian Livingston as government minister for the department which was processing the complaint: Livingston had occupied a senior position at BT when the cable between RAF Croughton and Camp Lemonnier was originally built.

Balmoral Castle

Balmoral Castle is a large <a href="estate%20house">estate house</a> in <a href="Royal%20Deeside">Royal Deeside</a>, <a href="Aberdeenshire">Aberdeenshire</a>, Scotland, near the village of <a href="Crathie">Crathie</a>, west of <a href="Ballater">Ballater</a> and east of <a href="Braemar">Braemar</a>.

Balmoral has been one of the <a href="List%20of%20British%20royal%20residences">residences</a> for members of the <a href="British%20Royal%20Family">British Royal Family</a> since 1852, when the estate and its original castle were purchased privately by <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a>, <a href="Prince%20Consort">consort</a> to <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. They remain as the private property of the royal family and are not the property of <a href="the%20Crown">the Crown</a>.

Soon after the estate was purchased by the royal family, the existing house was found to be too small and the current Balmoral Castle was commissioned. The architect was <a href="William%20Smith%20%28architect%29">William Smith</a> of Aberdeen, although his designs were amended by Prince Albert.

The castle is an example of <a href="Scots%20Baronial">Scots Baronial</a> architecture, and is classified by <a href="Historic%20Scotland">Historic Scotland</a> as a <a href="category%20A%20listed">category A listed</a> building. The new castle was completed in 1856 and the old castle demolished shortly thereafter.

The Balmoral <a href="Estate%20%28land%29">Estate</a> has been added to by successive members of the royal family, and now covers an area of approximately . It is a working estate, including <a href="Red%20Grouse">grouse moors</a>, forestry, and farmland, as well as managed herds of deer, <a href="Highland%20cattle">Highland cattle</a>, and ponies.

<a href="Robert%20II%20of%20Scotland">King Robert II</a> of Scotland (1316–1390) had a <a href="hunting">hunting lodge</a> in the area. Historical records also indicate that a house at Balmoral was built by Sir William Drummond in 1390. The estate is recorded in 1451 as "Bouchmorale", and later was tenanted by Alexander Gordon, second son of the <a href="Alexander%20Gordon%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Huntly">1st Earl of Huntly</a>. A <a href="tower%20houses%20in%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">tower house</a> was built on the estate by the Gordons. 

In 1662 the estate passed to <a href="Charles%20Farquharson">Charles Farquharson</a> of <a href="Inverey">Inverey</a>, brother of <a href="John%20Farquharson%2C%203rd%20of%20Inverey">John Farquharson</a>, the "Black Colonel". The Farquharsons were <a href="jacobitism">Jacobite</a> sympathisers, and James Farquharson of Balmoral was involved in both the 1715 and 1745 <a href="Jacobite%20risings">rebellions</a>. He was wounded at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Falkirk%20%281746%29">Battle of Falkirk</a> in 1746. The Farquharson estates were <a href="wikt%3Aforfeit">forfeit</a>, and passed to the Farquharsons of <a href="Braemar">Auchendryne</a>. In 1798, <a href="James%20Duff%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Fife">James Duff, 2nd Earl Fife</a>, acquired Balmoral and leased the castle. <a href="Robert%20Gordon%20%28diplomat%29">Sir Robert Gordon</a>, a younger brother of the <a href="George%20Gordon%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Aberdeen">4th Earl of Aberdeen</a>, acquired the lease in 1830. He made major alterations to the original castle at Balmoral, including baronial-style extensions that were designed by <a href="John%20Smith%20%28architect%29">John Smith</a> of Aberdeen.

Queen Victoria and Prince Albert first visited Scotland in 1842, five years after her accession to the throne and two years after their marriage. During this first visit they stayed at <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, and at <a href="Taymouth%20Castle">Taymouth Castle</a> in <a href="Perthshire">Perthshire</a>, the home of the <a href="John%20Campbell%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Breadalbane">Marquess of Breadalbane</a>. They returned in 1844 to stay at <a href="Blair%20Castle">Blair Castle</a> and, in 1847, when they rented Ardverikie by <a href="Loch%20Laggan">Loch Laggan</a>. During the latter trip they encountered weather that was extremely rainy, which led <a href="James%20Clark%20%28physician%29">Sir James Clark</a>, the queen's physician, to recommend <a href="River%20Dee%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Deeside</a> instead, for its more healthy climate.

Sir Robert Gordon died in 1847 and his lease on Balmoral reverted to Lord Aberdeen. In February 1848 an arrangement was made—that Prince Albert would acquire the remaining part of the lease on Balmoral, together with its furniture and staff—without having seen the property first.

The royal couple arrived for their first visit on 8 September 1848. Victoria found the house "small but pretty", and recorded in her diary that: "All seemed to breathe freedom and peace, and to make one forget the world and its sad turmoils". The surrounding hilly landscape reminded them of <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a>, Albert's homeland in Germany.

Quickly, the house was confirmed to be too small and, in 1848, John and William Smith were commissioned to design new offices, cottages, and other ancillary buildings. Improvements to the woodlands, gardens, and estate buildings also were being made, with the assistance of the landscape gardener, James Beattie, and possibly by the painter, <a href="james%20Giles%20%28painter%29">James Giles</a>.

Major additions to the old house were considered in 1849, but by then negotiations were under way to purchase the estate from the trustees of the deceased Earl Fife. After seeing a <a href="corrugated%20iron">corrugated iron</a> cottage at the <a href="Great%20Exhibition%20of%201851">Great Exhibition of 1851</a>, Prince Albert ordered a pre-fabricated iron building for Balmoral from E. T. Bellhouse & Co., to serve as a temporary ballroom and dining room. It was in use by 1 October 1851, and would serve as a ballroom until 1856.

The sale was completed in June 1852, the price being £32,000, and Prince Albert formally took possession that autumn. The neighbouring estate of <a href="Birkhall">Birkhall</a> was bought at the same time, and the lease on <a href="Abergeldie%20Castle">Abergeldie Castle</a> secured as well. To mark the occasion, the "Purchase Cairn" was erected in the hills overlooking the castle, the first of many.

The growing family of Victoria and Albert, the need for additional staff, and the quarters required for visiting friends and official visitors such as cabinet members, however, meant that extension of the existing structure would not be sufficient and that a larger house needed to be built. In early 1852, this was commissioned from William Smith. The son of John Smith (who designed the 1830 alterations of the original castle), William Smith was city architect of <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> from 1852. On learning of the commission, <a href="William%20Burn">William Burn</a> sought an interview with the prince, apparently to complain that Smith previously had plagiarised his work, however, Burn was unsuccessful in depriving Smith of the appointment. William Smith's designs were amended by Prince Albert, who took a close interest in details such as turrets and windows.

Construction began during summer 1853, on a site some northwest of the original building that was considered to have a better vista. Another reason for consideration was, that whilst construction was ongoing, the family would still be able to use the old house. Queen Victoria laid the foundation stone on 28 September 1853, during her annual autumn visit. By the autumn of 1855, the royal apartments were ready for occupancy, although the tower was still under construction and the servants had to be lodged in the old house. By coincidence, shortly after their arrival at the estate that autumn, news circulated about the fall of <a href="Siege%20of%20Sevastopol%20%281854%E2%80%9355%29">Sevastopol</a>, ending the Crimean War, resulting in wild celebrations by royalty and locals alike. While visiting the estate shortly thereafter, <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20German%20Emperor">Prince Frederick of Prussia</a> asked for the hand of <a href="Victoria%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Princess Victoria</a>.

The new house was completed in 1856, and the old castle subsequently was demolished. By autumn 1857, a new bridge across the Dee, designed by <a href="Isambard%20Kingdom%20Brunel">Isambard Kingdom Brunel</a> linking Crathie and Balmoral was finished.

Balmoral Castle is built from <a href="granite">granite</a> quarried at Invergelder on the estate, It consists of two main blocks, each arranged around a courtyard. The southwestern block contains the main rooms, while the northeastern contains the service wings. At the southeast is an tall clock tower topped with turrets, one of which has a balustrade similar to a feature at <a href="Castle%20Fraser">Castle Fraser</a>. Being similar in style to the demolished castle of the 1830s, the architecture of the new house is considered to be somewhat dated for its time when contrasted with the richer forms of <a href="Scots%20Baronial">Scots Baronial</a> being developed by William Burn and others during the 1850s. As an exercise in Scots Baronial, it sometimes is described as being too ordered, pedantic, and even, <a href="Architecture%20of%20Germany">Germanic</a>—as a consequence of Prince Albert's influence on the design.

The purchase of a Scottish estate by Victoria and Albert and their adoption of a Scottish architectural style, however, was very influential for the ongoing revival of <a href="Highland%20culture">Highland culture</a>. They decorated Balmoral with tartans and attended <a href="highland%20games">highland games</a> at Braemar. Queen Victoria expressed an affinity for Scotland, even professing herself to be a <a href="Jacobitism">Jacobite</a>. Added to the work of <a href="Sir%20Walter%20Scott">Sir Walter Scott</a>, this became a major factor in promoting the adoption of <a href="Highland%20culture">Highland culture</a> by <a href="Lowland%20Scotland">Lowland Scots</a>. Historian Michael Lynch comments that "the Scottishness of Balmoral helped to give the monarchy a truly British dimension for the first time".

Even before the completion of the new house, the pattern of the life of the royal couple in the Highlands was soon established. Victoria took long walks of up to four hours daily and Albert spent many days hunting deer and game. In 1849, diarist <a href="Charles%20Greville%20%28diarist%29">Charles Greville</a> described their life at Balmoral as resembling that of gentry rather than royalty. Victoria began a policy of commissioning artists to record Balmoral, its surroundings, and its staff. Over the years, numerous painters were employed at Balmoral, including <a href="Edwin%20Landseer">Edwin</a> and <a href="Charles%20Landseer">Charles Landseer</a>, <a href="Carl%20Haag">Carl Haag</a>, <a href="William%20Wyld">William Wyld</a>, and <a href="William%20Henry%20Fisk">William Henry Fisk</a>. The royal couple took great interest in their staff. They established a lending library.

During the 1850s, new plantations were established near the house and exotic conifers were planted on the grounds. Prince Albert had an active role in these improvements, overseeing the design of <a href="parterre">parterre</a>s, the diversion of the main road north of the river via a new bridge, and plans for farm buildings. These buildings included a <a href="model%20farm">model dairy</a> that he developed during 1861, the year of his death. The dairy was completed by Victoria. Subsequently, she also built several monuments to her husband on the estate. These include a pyramid-shaped cairn built a year after Albert's death, on top of "Craig Lurachain". A large statue of Albert with a dog and a gun by <a href="William%20Theed">William Theed</a>, was inaugurated on 15 October 1867, the twenty-eighth anniversary of their engagement.

Following Albert's death, Victoria spent increasing periods at Balmoral, staying for as long as four months a year during early summer and autumn. Few further changes were made to the grounds, with the exception of some alterations to mountain paths, the erection of various cairns and monuments, and the addition of some cottages ("Karim Cottage" and "Baile na Coille") built for senior staff. It was during this period that Victoria began to depend on her servant, <a href="John%20Brown%20%28servant%29">John Brown</a>. He was a local <a href="wikt%3Agillie">ghillie</a> from Crathie, who became one of her closest companions during her long mourning.

In 1887, Balmoral Castle was the birthplace of <a href="Victoria%20Eugenie%20of%20Battenberg">Victoria Eugenie</a>, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. She was born to <a href="Princess%20Beatrice%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Princess Beatrice</a>, the fifth daughter of Victoria and Albert. Victoria Eugenie would become the queen of Spain.

In September 1896, Victoria welcomed <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Emperor Nicholas II of Russia</a> and <a href="Alexandra%20Feodorovna%20%28Alix%20of%20Hesse%29">Empress Alexandra</a> to Balmoral. Four years later Victoria made her last visit to the estate, three months before her death on 22 January 1901.

After Victoria's death, the royal family continued to use Balmoral during annual autumn visits. <a href="George%20V">George V</a> had substantial improvements made during the 1910s and 1920s, including formal gardens to the south of the castle.

During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, royal visits to Balmoral ceased. In addition, due to the enmity with Germany, "Danzig Shiel", a lodge built by Victoria in Ballochbuie was renamed "Garbh Allt Shiel" and the "King of Prussia's Fountain" was removed from the grounds.

Since the 1950s, <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip</a> has added herbaceous borders and a water garden. During the 1980s new staff buildings were built close to the castle.

Though called a castle, Balmoral's primary function is that of a country house. It is a "typical and rather ordinary" country house from the Victorian period. The tower and "pepper pot turrets" are characteristic features of the residence's Scottish Baronial style. The seven story tower is an architectural feature borrowed from medieval defensive <a href="tower%20house">tower house</a>s. The "pepper pot turrets" were influenced by the style of 16th century French <a href="ch%C3%A2teau">château</a>s. Other features of the Scottish Baronial style are the <a href="crow-stepped%20gable">crow-stepped gable</a>s, <a href="dormer">dormer</a> windows, and <a href="battlement">battlement</a>ed <a href="porte-coch%C3%A8re">porte-cochère</a>.

Balmoral is a private property and, unlike the monarch's <a href="official%20residence">official residence</a>s, is not the property of <a href="the%20Crown">the Crown</a>. It originally was purchased personally by Prince Albert, rather than the queen, meaning that no revenues from the estate go to Parliament or to the public purse, as otherwise in accord with the <a href="Civil%20List%20Act%201760">Civil List Act 1760</a> would be the case for property owned outright by the monarch.

Along with <a href="Sandringham%20House">Sandringham House</a> in Norfolk, ownership of Balmoral was inherited by <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward VIII</a> on his accession in 1936. When he <a href="Edward%20VIII%20abdication%20crisis">abdicated</a> later the same year, however, he retained ownership of them. A financial settlement was devised, under which Balmoral and Sandringham were purchased by Edward's brother and successor to the Crown, <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a>.

Currently, the estate is still owned outright by the monarch, but, by Trustees under Deeds of Nomination and Appointment, it is managed by a trust.

Balmoral Estate is within the <a href="Cairngorms%20National%20Park">Cairngorms National Park</a> and is partly within the Deeside and Lochnagar <a href="National%20Scenic%20Area%20%28Scotland%29">National Scenic Area</a>. The estate contains a wide variety of landscapes, from the <a href="River%20Dee%2C%20Aberdeenshire">Dee river valley</a> to open mountains. There are seven <a href="Munro">Munro</a>s (hills in Scotland over ) within the estate, the highest being <a href="Lochnagar">Lochnagar</a> at . This mountain was the setting for a children's story, "<a href="The%20Old%20Man%20of%20Lochnagar">The Old Man of Lochnagar</a>", told originally by <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a> to his younger brothers, <a href="Prince%20Andrew%2C%20Duke%20of%20York">Andrew</a> and <a href="Prince%20Edward%2C%20Earl%20of%20Wessex">Edward</a>. The story was published in 1980, with royalties accruing to <a href="The%20Prince%27s%20Trust">The Prince's Trust</a>. The estate also incorporates the 7,500-acre <a href="Delnadamph%20Lodge">Delnadamph Lodge</a> estate, bought by Elizabeth II in 1978. 

The estate extends to <a href="Loch%20Muick">Loch Muick</a> in the southeast where an old boat house and the Royal <a href="Bothy">Bothy</a> (hunting lodge) now named "<a href="Glas-allt-Shiel">Glas-allt-Shiel</a>", built by Victoria, are located.

The working estate includes <a href="Red%20Grouse">grouse moors</a>, forestry, and farmland, as well as managed herds of deer, <a href="Highland%20cattle">Highland cattle</a>, and ponies. It also offers access to the public for fishing (paid) and hiking during certain seasons.

Approximately 8,000 acres of the estate are covered by trees, with almost 3,000 acres used for forestry that yields nearly 10,000 tonnes of wood per year. "Ballochbuie Forest", one of the largest remaining areas of old Caledonian pine growth in Scotland, consists of approximately 3,000 acres. It is managed with only minimal or no intervention. The principal mammal on the estate is the <a href="red%20deer">red deer</a> with a population of 2,000 to 2,500 head.

The areas of Lochnagar and Ballochbuie were designated in 1998 by the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Scotland">Secretary of State for Scotland</a> as <a href="Special%20Protection%20Areas">Special Protection Areas</a> (SPA) under the European Union (EU) <a href="Birds%20Directive">Birds Directive</a>.
Bird species inhabiting the moorlands include <a href="red%20grouse">red grouse</a>, <a href="black%20grouse">black grouse</a>, <a href="ptarmigan">ptarmigan</a>, and the <a href="capercaillie">capercaillie</a>. Ballochbuie also is protected as a <a href="Special%20Area%20of%20Conservation">Special Area of Conservation</a> by the EU <a href="Habitats%20Directive">Habitats Directive</a>, as "one of the largest remaining continuous areas of native <a href="Caledonian%20Forest">Caledonian Forest</a>". In addition, there are four <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">sites of special scientific interest</a> on the estate.

The royal family employs approximately 50 full-time and 50–100 part-time staff to maintain the working estate. A <a href="Single%20malt%20whisky">malt whisky</a> distillery located on the Balmoral Estate produces the <a href="Royal%20Lochnagar%20Single%20Malt">Royal Lochnagar Single Malt</a> whisky.

There are approximately 150 buildings on the estate, including <a href="Birkhall">Birkhall</a>, formerly home to <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother">Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother</a>, and used now by Prince Charles and the <a href="Camilla%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Cornwall">Duchess of Cornwall</a> for their summer holidays. Craigowan Lodge is used regularly by the family and friends of the royal family and also has been used while Balmoral Castle was being prepared for a royal visit. Six smaller buildings on the estate are let as <a href="holiday%20cottage">holiday cottage</a>s.

In 1931, the castle gardens were opened to the public for the first time and they now are open daily between April and the end of July, after which Queen Elizabeth arrives for her annual stay. The ballroom is the only room in the castle that may be viewed by the public.

Craigowan Lodge is a seven-bedroom stone house approximately a mile from the main castle in Balmoral. More rustic than the castle, the lodge was often the home of Charles and Diana when they visited. Currently, it is used as quarters for important guests.

In the obituary of <a href="Prince%20Michael%20Andreevich%20of%20Russia">Michael Andreevich Romanoff</a>, the highest-ranking member of the Russian imperial family at the time of his death in 2008, it was noted that his family spent most of World War II at Craigowan Lodge.

The lodge has been in the news periodically since 2005, because Queen Elizabeth often spends the first few days of her summer holiday there. During each weekend of the summer the castle is a lucrative source of income from visiting tourists. Sometimes, the Queen arrives at Balmoral before the tourist visiting season is over.

Queen Elizabeth was in residence at Balmoral at the time of the <a href="death%20of%20Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales">death of Diana, Princess of Wales</a> in 1997. Her private discussions with Prime Minister <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> were dramatised in the <a href="Stephen%20Frears">Stephen Frears</a> film, "<a href="The%20Queen%20%28film%29">The Queen</a>" (2006). The 1997 film "<a href="Mrs.%20Brown%20%28film%29">Mrs. Brown</a>" also was based on events at Balmoral. In both films, however, substitute locations were used: <a href="Blairquhan%20Castle">Blairquhan Castle</a> in "The Queen"; and <a href="Duns%20Castle">Duns Castle</a> in "Mrs Brown".

Since 1987 an illustration of the castle has been featured on the reverse side of <a href="Banknotes%20of%20the%20pound%20sterling">£100 notes</a> issued by the <a href="Royal%20Bank%20of%20Scotland">Royal Bank of Scotland</a>.

Breton language

Breton ("" or in <a href="Morbihan">Morbihan</a>) is a <a href="Southwestern%20Brittonic%20languages">Southwestern Brittonic Celtic language</a> spoken in <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a>.

Breton was brought from <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> to <a href="Armorica">Armorica</a> by migrating <a href="Britons%20%28Celtic%20people%29">Britons</a> during the <a href="Early%20Middle%20Ages">Early Middle Ages</a>; it is thus an <a href="Insular%20Celtic%20languages">Insular Celtic language</a>, and as such not closely related to the Continental Celtic <a href="Gaulish%20language">Gaulish language</a> which had been spoken in pre-Roman <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a>. Breton is most closely related to <a href="Cornish%20language">Cornish</a>, both being <a href="Southwestern%20Brittonic%20languages">Southwestern Brittonic languages</a>. <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a> and the extinct <a href="Cumbric%20language">Cumbric</a> are the more distantly related Brittonic languages.

The other <a href="regional%20language">regional language</a> of Brittany, <a href="Gallo%20language">Gallo</a>, is a <a href="Langues%20d%27o%C3%AFl">langue d'oïl</a>. Gallo is consequently close to French, although not mutually intelligible, and a <a href="Romance%20languages">Romance language</a> descended from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> (unlike the similarly named ancient Celtic language <a href="Gaulish%20language">Gaulish</a>).

Having declined from more than 1 million speakers around 1950 to about 200,000 in the first decade of the 21st century, Breton is classified as "severely endangered" by the UNESCO <a href="Red%20Book%20of%20Endangered%20Languages">Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger</a>. However, the number of children attending bilingual classes has risen 33% between 2006 and 2012 to 14,709.

Breton is spoken in <a href="Lower%20Brittany">Lower Brittany</a> (), roughly to the west of a line linking <a href="Plouha">Plouha</a> (west of <a href="Saint-Brieuc">Saint-Brieuc</a>) and <a href="La%20Roche-Bernard">La Roche-Bernard</a> (east of <a href="Vannes">Vannes</a>). It comes from a Brittonic language community that once extended from Great Britain to <a href="Armorica">Armorica</a> (present-day Brittany) and had even established a toehold in <a href="Galicia%20%28Spain%29">Galicia</a> (in present-day Spain). Old Breton is attested from the 9th century. It was the language of the upper classes until the 12th century, after which it became the language of commoners in Lower Brittany. The nobility, followed by the <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a>, adopted <a href="French%20language">French</a>. The written language of the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brittany">Duchy of Brittany</a> was <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, switching to French in the 15th century. There exists a limited tradition of <a href="Breton%20literature">Breton literature</a>. Some Old Breton vocabulary remains in the present day as <a href="Philosophy">philosophical</a> and scientific terms in Modern Breton. The recognized stages of the Breton language are: Old Breton - c.800 to c.1100, Middle Breton - c.1100 to c.1650, Modern Breton - c.1650 to present. 

The French monarchy was not concerned with the <a href="Minority%20language">minority</a> <a href="languages%20of%20France">languages of France</a> spoken by the lower classes, and required the use of French for government business as part of its policy of national unity. During the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, the government introduced policies favouring French over the regional languages, which it pejoratively referred to as '. The revolutionaries assumed that <a href="reactionary">reactionary</a> and <a href="monarchy">monarchist</a> forces preferred <a href="regional%20language">regional language</a>s to try to keep the peasant masses underinformed. In 1794, <a href="Bertrand%20Bar%C3%A8re">Bertrand Barère</a> submitted his "report on the '" to the <a href="Committee%20of%20Public%20Safety">Committee of Public Safety</a> in which he said that "federalism and superstition speak Breton".

Since the 19th century, under the <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">Third</a>, <a href="French%20Fourth%20Republic">Fourth</a> and <a href="French%20Fifth%20Republic">Fifth Republics</a>, the government has attempted to stamp out minority languages, including Breton, in state schools, in an effort to build a national culture. Teachers humiliated students for using their regional languages, and such practices prevailed until the late 1960s.

In the early 21st century, due to the political centralization of France, the influence of the media, and the increasing mobility of people, only about 200,000 people can speak Breton, a dramatic decline from more than a million in 1950. The majority of today's speakers are more than 60 years old, and Breton is now classified as an <a href="endangered%20language">endangered language</a>.

At the beginning of the 20th century, half of the population of Lower Brittany knew only Breton; the other half were bilingual. By 1950, there were only 100,000 <a href="monolingualism">monolingual</a> Bretons, and this rapid decline has continued, with likely no monolingual speakers left today. A statistical survey in 1997 found around 300,000 speakers in Lower Brittany, of whom about 190,000 were aged 60 or older. Few 15- to 19-year-olds spoke Breton.

In 1925, Professor <a href="Roparz%20Hemon">Roparz Hemon</a> founded the Breton-language review "<a href="Gwalarn">Gwalarn</a>." During its 19-year run, "Gwalarn" tried to raise the language to the level of a great international language. Its publication encouraged the creation of original literature in all genres, and proposed Breton translations of internationally recognized foreign works. In 1946, "<a href="Al%20Liamm">Al Liamm</a>" replaced "Gwalarn". Other Breton-language periodicals have been published, which established a fairly large body of literature for a minority language.

In 1977, <a href="Diwan%20%28school%29">Diwan schools</a> were founded to teach Breton by <a href="Language%20immersion">immersion</a>. They taught a few thousand young people from elementary school to high school. See the <a href="%23Education">education section</a> for more information.

The "<a href="Asterix">Asterix</a>" comic series has been translated into Breton. According to the comic, the <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a>ish village where Asterix lives is in the <a href="Armorica">Armorica peninsula</a>, which is now Brittany. Some other popular comics have also been translated into Breton, including "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Tintin">The Adventures of Tintin</a>", "<a href="Spirou%20et%20Fantasio">Spirou</a>", "<a href="Titeuf">Titeuf</a>", "<a href="H%C3%A4gar%20the%20Horrible">Hägar the Horrible</a>", "<a href="Peanuts">Peanuts</a>" and "<a href="Yakari">Yakari</a>".

Some original media are created in Breton. The sitcom, "Ken Tuch", is in Breton. <a href="Radio%20Kerne">Radio Kerne</a>, broadcasting from <a href="Finist%C3%A8re">Finistère</a>, has exclusively Breton programming. Some movies ("<a href="Lancelot%20du%20Lac%20%28film%29">Lancelot du Lac</a>", "<a href="Shakespeare%20in%20Love">Shakespeare in Love</a>", "<a href="Marion%20du%20Faouet">Marion du Faouet</a>", "<a href="Sezneg">Sezneg</a>") and TV series ("<a href="Columbo%20%28TV%20series%29">Columbo</a>", "<a href="Perry%20Mason%20%28TV%20series%29">Perry Mason</a>") have also been translated and broadcast in Breton. Poets, singers, linguists, and writers who have written in Breton, including <a href="Yann-Ber%20Kalloc%27h">Yann-Ber Kalloc'h</a>, <a href="Roparz%20Hemon">Roparz Hemon</a>, <a href="Anjela%20Duval">Anjela Duval</a>, <a href="Xavier%20de%20Langlais">Xavier de Langlais</a>, <a href="P%C3%AAr-Jakez%20Helias">Pêr-Jakez Helias</a>, <a href="Youenn%20Gwernig">Youenn Gwernig</a>, <a href="Glenmor">Glenmor</a> and <a href="Alan%20Stivell">Alan Stivell</a> are now known internationally.

Today, Breton is the only living <a href="Celtic%20languages">Celtic language</a> that is not recognized by national government as an official or regional language. The French State refuses to change the second article of the <a href="French%20Fifth%20Republic">Constitution</a> (added in 1994), which establishes that "the language of the Republic is French." Although Breton was long the Celtic language with the highest number of speakers, it is now endangered.

The first Breton dictionary, the "<a href="Catholicon%20%28trilingual%20dictionary%29">Catholicon</a>", was also the first French dictionary. Edited by Jehan Lagadec in 1464, it was a trilingual work containing Breton, French and Latin. Today bilingual dictionaries have been published for Breton and languages including English, Dutch, German, Spanish and Welsh. A new generation is determined to gain international recognition for Breton. The monolingual dictionary, " (1995), defines Breton words in Breton. The first edition contained about 10,000 words, and the second edition of 2001 contains 20,000 words.

In the early 21st century, the " ("Office of the Breton language") began a campaign to encourage daily use of Breton in the region by both businesses and local communes. Efforts include installing bilingual signs and posters for regional events, as well as encouraging the use of the <a href="Spilhennig">Spilhennig</a> to let speakers identify each other. The office also started an <a href="Internationalization%20and%20localization">Internationalization and localization</a> policy asking <a href="Google">Google</a>, <a href="Firefox">Firefox</a> and <a href="SPIP">SPIP</a> to develop their interfaces in Breton. In 2004, the <a href="Breton%20Wikipedia">Breton Wikipedia</a> started, which now counts more than 50,000 articles. In March 2007, the "Ofis ar Brezhoneg" signed a <a href="wikt%3Atripartite">tripartite agreement</a> with <a href="Regional%20Council%20of%20Brittany">Regional Council of Brittany</a> and <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> for the consideration of the Breton language in Microsoft products. In October 2014, <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> added Breton as one of its 121 languages. after three years of talks between the "Ofis" and the American giant.

Breton is spoken mainly in Lower Brittany, but also in a more dispersed way in Upper Brittany (where <a href="Gallo%20language">Gallo</a> is spoken alongside Breton and French), and in areas around the world that have Breton emigrants.

The four traditional dialects of Breton correspond to medieval bishoprics rather than to linguistic divisions. They are ' (', of the <a href="Viscounty%20of%20L%C3%A9on">county of Léon</a>), ' (', of <a href="Tr%C3%A9gor">Trégor</a>), ' (', of ), and ' (', of <a href="Vannes">Vannes</a>). ' was spoken up to the beginning of the 20th century in the region of <a href="Gu%C3%A9rande">Guérande</a> and <a href="Batz-sur-Mer">Batz-sur-Mer</a>. There are no clear boundaries between the dialects because they form a <a href="dialect%20continuum">dialect continuum</a>, varying only slightly from one village to the next. ', however, is almost mutually unintelligible with most of the other dialects.

As noted, only French is an <a href="official%20language">official language</a> of <a href="France">France</a>. Supporters of Breton and other minority languages continue to argue for their recognition, education in public schools and place in public life.

In July 2008, the legislature amended the <a href="Constitution%20of%20France">French Constitution</a>, adding article 75-1: " (the <a href="regional%20languages">regional languages</a> belong to the heritage of <a href="France">France</a>).

The <a href="European%20Charter%20for%20Regional%20or%20Minority%20Languages">European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages</a>, which obliges signatory states to recognize minority and regional languages, was signed by France in 1999 but has not been ratified. On 27 October 2015, the <a href="Senate%20%28France%29">Senate</a> rejected a draft constitutional law ratifying the charter.

Regional and departmental authorities use Breton to a very limited extent, for example in signage. Some bilingual signage has also been installed, such as street name signs in Breton towns. One station of the <a href="Rennes%20Metro">Rennes metro system</a> has signs in both French and Breton.

Under the French law known as <a href="Toubon%20Law">Toubon</a>, it is illegal for commercial signage to be in Breton alone. Signs must be bilingual or French only. Since commercial signage usually has limited physical space, most businesses have signs only in French.

', the Breton language agency, was set up in 1999 by the Brittany region to promote and develop the daily use of Breton. It created the ' campaign, to encourage enterprises, organisations and communes to promote the use of Breton, for example by installing bilingual signage or translating their websites into Breton.

In the late 20th century, the French government considered incorporating the independent Breton-language immersion schools (called "") into the state education system. This action was blocked by the French <a href="Constitutional%20Council%20of%20France">Constitutional Council</a> based on the 1994 amendment to the Constitution that establishes French as the language of the republic. Therefore, no other language may be used as a language of instruction in state schools. The <a href="Toubon%20Law">Toubon Law</a> implemented the amendment, asserting that French is the language of public education.

The <a href="Diwan%20%28school%29">Diwan schools</a> were founded in Brittany in 1977 to teach Breton by <a href="Language%20immersion">immersion</a>. They taught a few thousand young people from elementary school to high school. They have gained fame owing to their high level of results in school exams. Breton-language schools do not receive funding from the national government, though the Brittany Region may fund them.

Another teaching method is a bilingual approach by ' ("Two Languages") in the State schools, created in 1979. ' ("Awakening") was created in 1990 for bilingual education in the Catholic schools.

In 2012, 14,709 pupils (about 1.63% of all pupils in Brittany) attended Diwan, Div Yezh and Dihun schools. Their number has increased yearly. <a href="Jean-Yves%20Le%20Drian">Jean-Yves Le Drian</a>, the president of the <a href="Regional%20Council%20of%20Brittany">Regional Council</a>, had a goal of 20,000 pupils by 2010, but is encouraged by their progress.

In 2007, some 4,500 to 5,000 adults followed a Breton language course (such as evening course, correspondence, or other). The family transmission of Breton in 1999 is estimated to be 3 percent.

In addition to bilingual education (including Breton-medium education) the region has introduced the Breton language in primary education, mainly in the department of Finistère. These "initiation" sessions are generally one to three hours per week, and consist of songs and games.

Schools in secondary education ("<a href="coll%C3%A8ge">collège</a>s" and "<a href="lyc%C3%A9e">lycée</a>s") offer some courses of Breton (given as either foreign language or option, such as German or Spanish). In 2010, nearly 5,000 students in Brittany were reported to be taking this option. Additionally, the University of Rennes 2 has a Breton language department offering courses in the language along with a master's degree in Breton and Celtic Studies.

Vowels in Breton may be <a href="vowel%20length">short or long</a>. All unstressed vowels are short; stressed vowels can be short or long (vowel lengths are not noted in usual orthographies as they are implicit in the phonology of particular dialects, and not all dialects pronounce stressed vowels as long).

All vowels can also be <a href="nasalization">nasalized</a>, which is noted by appending an 'n' letter after the base vowel, or by adding a combining tilde above the vowel, or more commonly by non-ambiguously appending an letter after the base vowel (this depends on the orthographic variant).
Diphthongs are .


As in <a href="English%20language">English</a> and the other Celtic languages, a variety of verbal constructions are available to express <a href="grammatical%20aspect">grammatical aspect</a>, for example showing a distinction between <a href="progressive%20tense">progressive</a> and habitual actions:

As in other modern <a href="Celtic%20languages">Celtic languages</a>, Breton pronouns are fused into preceding prepositions to produce a sort of <a href="inflected%20preposition">"conjugated" preposition</a>. Below are some examples in Breton, <a href="Cornish%20language">Cornish</a>, <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a>, <a href="Irish%20language">Irish</a>, <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a>, and <a href="Manx%20language">Manx</a>, along with English translations.
Note that in the examples above the <a href="Goidelic%20languages">Goidelic languages</a> (Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx) use the preposition meaning "at" to show possession, whereas the <a href="Brittonic%20languages">Brittonic languages</a> use "with". The Goidelic languages, however, do use the preposition "with" to express "belong to" (Irish ', Scottish ', Manx ", The book belongs to me).

Note also that the above examples of Welsh are the <a href="literary%20Welsh%20morphology%23Prepositions">formal written language</a>. The order and preposition may differ slightly in <a href="colloquial%20Welsh%20morphology%23Prepositions">colloquial Welsh</a> (Formal ', North Wales ', South Wales "). 

Breton has four initial <a href="consonant%20mutation">consonant mutation</a>s: though modern Breton lost the nasal mutation of <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a>, it also has a "hard" mutation, in which voiced stops become voiceless, and a "mixed" mutation, which is a mixture of hard and soft mutations.

The English words and have been borrowed from French, which took them from Breton. However, this is uncertain: for instance, "menhir" is "peulvan" or "maen hir" ("long stone"), "maen sav" ("straight stone") (two words: noun + adjective) in Breton. "Dolmen" is a misconstructed word (it should be "taol-vaen"). Some studies state that these words were borrowed from <a href="Cornish%20language">Cornish</a>. ' can be directly translated from Welsh as "long stone" (which is exactly what a ' or "" is). The Cornish surnames Mennear, Minear and Manhire all derive from the Cornish " " ("long stone"), as does Tremenheere "settlement by the long stone".

The French word ("to jabber in a foreign language") is derived from Breton ' ("bread") and ' ("wine"). The French word ("large seagull") is derived from Breton ', which shares the same root as English "gull" (Welsh ', Cornish "").

The first extant Breton texts, contained in the Leyde manuscript, were written at the end of the 8th century: 50 years prior to the <a href="Strasbourg%20Oaths">Strasbourg Oaths</a>, considered to be the earliest example of <a href="French%20language">French</a>. Old- and Middle Breton orthography was at first, like other medieval orthographies, not standardised and it was often left to the author's sole discretion how a particular word was spelled. In 1499, however, a trilingual dictionary (Breton-French-Latin), the so-called "<a href="Catholicon%20%28trilingual%20dictionary%29">Catholicon</a>", was published and thus remained as a point of reference on how to transcribe the language for the upcoming decades. It was mostly based on French but included unusual digraphs likeand although the vowel system was largely adapted as a whole and even the digraph , a remnant of Latin orthography in French, was in use to denote the pronunciation as /k/ before front vowels. A phonetic occurrence known to France's language only in words originating from Latin expressions starting with the labiovelar /kʷ/ that developed later into /k/. The labiovelar was, ironically, not unknown to Breton and it was transcribed as or . As the differences between the dialects began to magnify, many regions, particularly the Vannes country, began to utilise their own writing systems to meet the requirements of new phonetic and phonological phenomenons. These systems orientated themselves once more towards the French model albeit with some new modifications like (in traditional Vannes orthography) to represent /x/ or /h/ for instance at the end of words which were written with or the likes of it, due to their origin from Old Breton "-θ" that developed to /x/ or /h/ in the Vannes dialect or as a grapheme representing the initial mutation of /k/ which was (and still is) much weaker articulated in Vannes than, for example, the /χ/ of Léon (today written ) and thus needed another transcription. Finally, after centuries of orthography <a href="calque">calque</a>d on the French model, in the 1830s <a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Le%20Gonidec">Jean-François Le Gonidec</a> created a modern phonetic system for the language.

During the early years of the 20th century, a group of writers known as ' elaborated and reformed Le Gonidec's system. They made it more suitable as a super-dialectal representation of the dialects of <a href="Cornouaille">Cornouaille</a>, Leon and Trégor (known as from "Kernev", "Leon" and "Treger" in Breton). This KLT orthography was established in 1911. At the same time writers of the more divergent Vannetais dialect developed a phonetic system also based on that of Le Gonidec.

Following proposals made during the 1920s, the KLT and Vannetais orthographies were merged in 1941 to create an orthographic system to represent all four dialects. This "" ("wholly unified") orthography was significant for the inclusion of the "zh" <a href="Digraph%20%28orthography%29">digraph</a>, which represents a in Vannetais and corresponds to a in the KLT dialects.

In 1955 <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Falc%27hun">François Falc'hun</a> and the group Emgleo Breiz proposed a new orthography. It was designed to use a set of <a href="graphemes">graphemes</a> closer to the conventions of French. This ' ("University Orthography", known in Breton as ') was given official recognition by the French authorities as the "official orthography of Breton in French education." It was opposed in the region and today is used only by the magazine "Brud Nevez" and the publishing house Emgléo Breiz.

Between 1971 and 1974, a new standard orthography was devised — the ' or '. This system is based on the derivation of the words.

Today the majority of writers continue to use the "Peurunvan orthography", and it is the version taught in most Breton-language schools.

Due to the deficient suitableness of those standardised, interdialectal orthography for many dialects (especially the Vannes dialect) they are seen as a threat by some activists, rather than as a helping tool for promoting and spreading the language because it endangers the rich variety of the still living dialects and encourages the usage of a de facto non-existent artificial language.

Breton is written in the <a href="Latin%20script">Latin script</a>. "Peurunvan", the most commonly used orthography, consists of the following letters:

The <a href="circumflex">circumflex</a>, <a href="grave%20accent">grave accent</a>, <a href="trema%20%28diacritic%29">trema</a> and <a href="tilde">tilde</a> appear on some letters. These <a href="diacritic">diacritic</a>s are used in the following way:

See for an introduction to the Breton alphabet and pronunciation.

Both orthographies use the above alphabet, although "é" is used only in .

Differences between the two systems are particularly noticeable in word endings. In Peurunvan, final <a href="obstruent">obstruent</a>s, which are devoiced in absolute final position and voiced in <a href="sandhi">sandhi</a> before voiced sounds, are represented by a grapheme that indicates a voiceless sound. In OU they are written as voiced but represented as voiceless before suffixes: ' (big), ' (bigger).

In addition, Peurunvan maintains the KLT convention, which distinguishes noun/adjective pairs by nouns written with a final voiced consonant and adjectives with a voiceless one. No distinction is made in pronunciation, e.g. ' "Breton language" vs. ' "Breton (adj)".

Broch

A broch () is an <a href="British%20Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> <a href="drystone">drystone</a> hollow-walled structure of a type found only in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. Brochs belong to the classification "complex <a href="atlantic%20roundhouse">atlantic roundhouse</a>" devised by Scottish <a href="archaeologist">archaeologist</a>s in the 1980s. Their origin is a matter of some controversy. 

The word "broch" is derived from <a href="Scots%20language">Lowland Scots</a> 'brough', meaning (among other things) fort. In the mid-19th century Scottish <a href="Antiquarian">antiquaries</a> called brochs 'burgs', after <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> ', with the same meaning. Place names in Scandinavian Scotland such as Burgawater and Burgan show that Old Norse ' is the older word used for these structures in the north. Brochs are often referred to as "<a href="dun">dun</a>s" in the west. Antiquaries began to use the spelling "broch" in the 1870s.

A precise definition for the word has proved elusive. Brochs are the most spectacular of a complex class of roundhouse buildings found throughout Atlantic Scotland. The <a href="Shetland%20Amenity%20Trust">Shetland Amenity Trust</a> lists about 120 sites in <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a> as candidate brochs, while the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20the%20Ancient%20and%20Historical%20Monuments%20of%20Scotland">Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland</a> (RCAHMS) identifies a total of 571 candidate broch sites throughout the country. Researcher Euan MacKie has proposed a much smaller total for Scotland of 104.

The origin of brochs is a subject of continuing research. Sixty years ago most archaeologists believed that brochs, usually regarded as the 'castles' of Iron Age chieftains, were built by immigrants who had been pushed northward after being displaced first by the intrusions of <a href="Belgae">Belgic tribes</a> into what is now southeast England at the end of the second century BC and later by the <a href="Scotland%20during%20the%20Roman%20Empire">Roman invasion</a> of southern Britain beginning in AD 43. Yet there is now little doubt that the hollow-walled broch tower was purely an invention in what is now Scotland; even the kinds of pottery found inside them that most resembled south British styles were local hybrid forms. The first of the modern review articles on the subject (MacKie 1965) did not, as is commonly believed, propose that brochs were built by immigrants, but rather that a hybrid culture formed from the blending of a small number of immigrants with the native population of the Hebrides produced them in the first century BC, basing them on earlier, simpler, promontory forts. This view contrasted, for example, with that of Sir <a href="Lindsay%20Scott">Lindsay Scott</a>, who argued, following Childe (1935), for a wholesale migration into Atlantic Scotland of people from southwest England.

MacKie's theory has fallen from favour too, mainly because starting in the 1970s there was a general move in archaeology away from 'diffusionist' explanations towards those pointing to exclusively indigenous development. Meanwhile, the increasing number – albeit still pitifully few – of <a href="radiocarbon">radiocarbon</a> dates for the primary use of brochs (as opposed to their later, secondary use) still suggests that most of the towers were built in the 1st centuries BC and AD. A few may be earlier, notably the one proposed for <a href="Old%20Scatness%20Broch">Old Scatness Broch</a> in Shetland, where a sheep bone dating to 390–200 BC has been reported. 

The other broch claimed to be substantially older than the 1st century BC is <a href="Crosskirk%20Broch">Crosskirk</a> in Caithness, but a recent review of the evidence suggests that it cannot plausibly be assigned a date earlier than the 1st centuries BC/AD

The distribution of brochs is centred on northern Scotland. <a href="Caithness">Caithness</a>, Sutherland and the <a href="Northern%20Isles">Northern Isles</a> have the densest concentrations, but there are a great many examples in the west of Scotland and the <a href="Hebrides">Hebrides</a>. Although mainly concentrated in the northern Highlands and the Islands, a few examples occur in the <a href="Scottish%20Borders">Borders</a> (for example <a href="Edin%27s%20Hall%20Broch">Edin's Hall Broch</a> and <a href="Bow%20Castle%20Broch">Bow Castle Broch</a>); on the west coast of <a href="Dumfries%20and%20Galloway">Dumfries and Galloway</a>; and near <a href="Stirling">Stirling</a>. In a c.1560 sketch there appears to be a broch by the river next to <a href="Annan%20Castle">Annan Castle</a> in Dumfries and Galloway. This small group of southern brochs has never been satisfactorily explained.

The original interpretation of brochs, favoured by nineteenth century antiquarians, was that they were defensive structures, places of refuge for the community and their livestock. They were sometimes regarded as the work of Danes or Picts. From the 1930s to the 1960s, archaeologists such as <a href="V.%20Gordon%20Childe">V. Gordon Childe</a> and later John Hamilton regarded them as castles where local landowners held sway over a subject population.

The castle theory fell from favour among Scottish archaeologists in the 1980s, due to a lack of supporting archaeological evidence. These archaeologists suggested defensibility was never a major concern in the siting of a broch, and argued that they may have been the "<a href="stately%20home">stately home</a>s" of their time, objects of prestige and very visible demonstrations of superiority for important families (Armit 2003). Once again, however, there is a lack of archaeological proof for this reconstruction, and the sheer number of brochs, sometimes in places with a lack of good land, makes it problematic.

Brochs' close groupings and profusion in many areas may indeed suggest that they had a primarily defensive or even offensive function. Some of them were sited beside precipitous cliffs and were protected by large ramparts, artificial or natural: a good example is at Burland near Gulberwick in <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a>, on a clifftop and cut off from the mainland by huge ditches. Often they are at key strategic points. In Shetland they sometimes cluster on each side of narrow stretches of water: the broch of <a href="Mousa">Mousa</a>, for instance, is directly opposite another at Burraland in Sandwick. In <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> there are more than a dozen on the facing shores of Eynhallow Sound, and many at the exits and entrances of the great harbour of <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>. In <a href="Sutherland">Sutherland</a> quite a few are placed along the sides and at the mouths of deep valleys. Writing in 1956 John Stewart suggested that brochs were forts put up by a military society to scan and protect the countryside and seas.

Finally, some archaeologists consider broch sites individually, doubting that there ever was a single common purpose for which every broch was constructed. There are differences between the various areas in which brochs are found, with regard to position, dimensions and likely status. For example, the broch "villages" which occur at a few places in <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> have no parallel in the <a href="Western%20Isles">Western Isles</a>.

Generally, brochs have a single entrance with bar-holes, door-checks and lintels. There are mural cells and there is a scarcement (ledge), perhaps for timber-framed lean-to dwellings lining the inner face of the wall. Also there is a spiral staircase winding upwards between the inner and outer wall and connecting the galleries. Brochs vary from 5 to 15 metres (16–50 ft) in internal diameter, with 3 metre (10 ft) thick walls. On average, the walls only survive to a few metres in height. There are five extant examples of towers with significantly higher walls: <a href="Dun%20Carloway">Dun Carloway</a> on <a href="Lewis">Lewis</a>, <a href="Dun%20Telve">Dun Telve</a> and <a href="Dun%20Troddan">Dun Troddan</a> in <a href="Glenelg%2C%20Scotland">Glenelg</a>, <a href="Broch%20of%20Mousa">Mousa</a> in Shetland and <a href="Dun%20Dornaigil">Dun Dornaigil</a> in Sutherland, all of whose walls exceed 6.5 m (21 ft) in height. 

Mousa's walls are the best preserved and are still 13 m tall; it is not clear how many brochs originally stood this high. A frequent characteristic is that the walls are galleried: with an open space between, the outer and inner wall skins are separate but tied together with linking stone slabs; these linking slabs may in some cases have served as steps to higher floors. It is normal for there to be a cell breaking off from the passage beside the door; this is known as the guard cell. It has been found in some Shetland brochs that guard cells in entrance passageways are close to large door-check stones. Though there was much argument in the past, it is now generally accepted among archaeologists that brochs were roofed, perhaps with a conical timber framed roof covered with a locally sourced thatch. The evidence for this assertion is still fairly scanty, although excavations at Dun Bharabhat, Lewis, may support it. The main difficulty with this interpretation continues to be the potential source of structural timber, though bog and driftwood may have been plentiful sources.

On the islands of <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a> there are very few cells at <a href="ground%20floor">ground floor</a>. Most brochs have scarcements (ledges) which may have allowed the construction of a very sturdy wooden first floor (first spotted by the antiquary George Low in <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a> in 1774), and excavations at Loch na Berie on the Isle of Lewis show signs of a further, second floor (e.g. stairs on the first floor, which head upwards). Some brochs such as Dun Dornaigil and <a href="Culswick">Culswick</a> in Shetland have unusual triangular lintels above the entrance door.

As in the case of <a href="Old%20Scatness">Old Scatness</a> in Shetland (near <a href="Jarlshof">Jarlshof</a> and <a href="Burroughston%20Broch">Burroughston</a> on <a href="Shapinsay">Shapinsay</a>), brochs were sometimes located close to <a href="arable%20land">arable land</a> and a <a href="water%20supply">source of water</a> (some have wells or natural springs rising within their central space). Sometimes, on the other hand, they were sited in wilderness areas (e.g. <a href="Levenwick">Levenwick</a> and <a href="Culswick">Culswick</a> in Shetland, Castle Cole in Sutherland). Brochs are often built beside the sea (<a href="Carn%20Liath%20%28broch%29">Carn Liath</a>, Sutherland); sometimes they are on islands in <a href="lochs">lochs</a> (e.g. <a href="Clickimin">Clickimin</a> in Shetland).

About 20 Orcadian broch sites include small settlements of stone buildings surrounding the main tower. Examples include Howe, near <a href="Stromness">Stromness</a>, <a href="Gurness%20Broch">Gurness Broch</a> in the north west of <a href="Mainland%2C%20Orkney">Mainland, Orkney</a>, Midhowe on <a href="Rousay">Rousay</a> and Lingro near <a href="Kirkwall">Kirkwall</a> (destroyed in the 1980s). There are "broch village" sites in Caithness, but elsewhere they are unknown.

Most brochs are unexcavated. Those that have been properly examined show that they continued in use for many centuries, with the interiors often modified and changed, and that they underwent many phases of habitation and abandonment. The end of the broch period seems to have come around AD 200–300.
<a href="The%20Crucible%20of%20Iron%20Age%20Shetland">Mousa, Old Scatness and Jarlshof: The Crucible of Iron Age Shetland</a> is a combination of three broch sites in Shetland that are on the United Kingdom "Tentative List" of possible nominations for the <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Sites">World Heritage Programme</a> list of sites of outstanding cultural or <a href="natural">natural</a> importance to the common <a href="Cultural%20heritage">heritage</a> of <a href="humankind">humankind</a>. 
This list, published in July 2010, includes sites that may be nominated for inscription over the next 5–10 years.

Billy Crystal

William Edward Crystal (born March 14, 1948) is an American actor, writer, producer, director, comedian and television host. He gained prominence in the 1970s for playing <a href="Jodie%20Dallas">Jodie Dallas</a> on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> sitcom "<a href="Soap%20%28TV%20series%29">Soap</a>" and became a Hollywood film star during the late 1980s and 1990s, appearing in the critical and box office successes "<a href="When%20Harry%20Met%20Sally...">When Harry Met Sally...</a>" (1989), "<a href="City%20Slickers">City Slickers</a>" (1991), and "<a href="Analyze%20This">Analyze This</a>" (1999) and providing the voice of <a href="List%20of%20Monsters%2C%20Inc.%20characters%23Mike%20Wazowski">Mike Wazowski</a> in the "<a href="Monsters%2C%20Inc.">Monsters, Inc.</a>" franchise.

He has hosted the <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a> 9 times, <a href="62nd%20Academy%20Awards">beginning in 1990</a> and <a href="84th%20Academy%20Awards">most recently in 2012</a>.

Crystal was born at <a href="Doctors%20Hospital%20%28Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%29">Doctors Hospital</a> on the <a href="Upper%20East%20Side">Upper East Side</a> of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> and initially raised in <a href="The%20Bronx">The Bronx</a>. As a toddler, he moved with his family to 549 East Park Avenue in <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20New%20York">Long Beach, New York</a>, on <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>. He and his older brothers Joel and Richard, nicknamed Rip, were the sons of Helen (née Gabler), a housewife, and Jack Crystal, who owned and operated the Commodore Music Store, founded by Helen's father, Julius Gabler. Jack Crystal was also a <a href="jazz">jazz</a> promoter, a producer, and an executive for an affiliated <a href="jazz">jazz</a> record label, <a href="Commodore%20Records">Commodore Records</a>, founded by Helen's brother, musician and songwriter <a href="Milt%20Gabler">Milt Gabler</a>. Crystal is <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a>; (his family emigrated from Austria and Russia). The three young brothers would entertain by reprising comedy routines from the likes of <a href="Bob%20Newhart">Bob Newhart</a>, <a href="Rich%20Little">Rich Little</a> and <a href="Sid%20Caesar">Sid Caesar</a> records their father would bring home. Jazz artists such as <a href="Arvell%20Shaw">Arvell Shaw</a>, <a href="Pee%20Wee%20Russell">Pee Wee Russell</a>, <a href="Eddie%20Condon">Eddie Condon</a>, and <a href="Billie%20Holiday">Billie Holiday</a> were often guests in the home. With the decline of <a href="Dixieland%20jazz">Dixieland jazz</a> circa 1963, Crystal's father lost his business and died later that year at the age of 54 after suffering a heart attack while bowling. His mother, Helen Crystal, died in 2001.

After graduation from <a href="Long%20Beach%20High%20School%20%28New%20York%29">Long Beach High School</a> in 1965, Crystal attended <a href="Marshall%20University">Marshall University</a> in <a href="Huntington%2C%20West%20Virginia">Huntington, West Virginia</a>, on a baseball scholarship, having learned the game from his father, who pitched for <a href="St.%20John%27s%20University%20%28New%20York%20City%29">St. John's University</a>. Crystal never played baseball at Marshall because the program was suspended during his first year. He did not return to Marshall as a sophomore, instead deciding to stay in New York to be close to his future wife. He attended <a href="Nassau%20Community%20College">Nassau Community College</a> with Janice and later transferred to <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>, where he was a film and television directing major. He graduated from <a href="New%20York%20University">NYU</a> in 1970 with a <a href="bachelor%20of%20fine%20arts%20degree">BFA</a> from its <a href="Tisch%20School%20of%20the%20Arts">School of Fine Arts</a>, not yet named for the <a href="Preston%20Robert%20Tisch">Tisch</a> family. One of his instructors was <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> while <a href="Oliver%20Stone">Oliver Stone</a> and <a href="Christopher%20Guest">Christopher Guest</a> were among his classmates.

Crystal returned to New York City. For four years he was part of a comedy trio with two friends. They played colleges and coffee houses and Crystal worked as a substitute teacher on Long Island. He later became a solo act and performed regularly at "<a href="The%20Improv">The Improv</a>" and "<a href="Catch%20a%20Rising%20Star%20%28comedy%20clubs%29">Catch a Rising Star</a>". In 1976, Crystal appeared on an episode of "<a href="All%20in%20the%20Family">All in the Family</a>". He was on the dais for <a href="The%20Dean%20Martin%20Celebrity%20Roast">The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast</a> of <a href="Muhammad%20Ali">Muhammad Ali</a> on February 19, 1976, where he did <a href="Impressionist%20%28entertainment%29">impression</a>s of both Ali and sportscaster <a href="Howard%20Cosell">Howard Cosell</a>. He was scheduled to appear on the first episode of "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">NBC Saturday Night</a>" (later renamed "Saturday Night Live" on October 11, 1975), but his sketch was cut. He did perform on episode 17 of that first season, doing a monologue of an old jazz man capped by the line "Can you dig it? I knew that you could." Host <a href="Ron%20Nessen">Ron Nessen</a> introduced him as "Bill Crystal." Crystal was a guest on the first and the last episode of "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20with%20Jay%20Leno">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a>," which concluded February 6, 2014, after 22 seasons on the air. Crystal also made game show appearances such as "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Squares">The Hollywood Squares</a>," "<a href="All%20Star%20Secrets">All Star Secrets</a>" and "<a href="Pyramid%20%28game%20show%29">The $20,000 Pyramid</a>." To this day, he holds the Pyramid franchise's record for getting his contestant partner to the top of the pyramid in winner's circle in the fastest time: 26 seconds.
Crystal's earliest prominent role was as <a href="Jodie%20Dallas">Jodie Dallas</a> on "<a href="Soap%20%28TV%20series%29">Soap</a>," one of the first unambiguously homosexual characters in the cast of an American television series. He continued in the role during the series's entire 1977–1981 run.

In 1982, Billy Crystal hosted his own variety show, "The Billy Crystal Comedy Hour" on NBC. When Crystal arrived to shoot the fifth episode, he learned it had been canceled after only the first two aired. After hosting "Saturday Night Live" twice, on March 17, 1984 and the show's ninth season finale on May 5, he joined the regular cast for the 1984-85 season. His most famous recurring sketch was his parody of <a href="Fernando%20Lamas">Fernando Lamas</a>, a smarmy talk-show host whose <a href="catchphrase">catchphrase</a>, "You look... mahvelous!," became a media sensation. Crystal subsequently released an album of his stand-up material titled "Mahvelous!" in 1985, as well as the single "You Look Marvelous", which peaked at No. 58 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> in the US, and No. 17 in Canada. Also in the 1980s, Crystal starred in an episode of <a href="Shelley%20Duvall">Shelley Duvall</a>'s "<a href="Faerie%20Tale%20Theatre">Faerie Tale Theatre</a>" as the smartest of the three little pigs.

In 1996, Crystal was the guest star of the third episode of "<a href="Muppets%20Tonight">Muppets Tonight</a>" and hosted three <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s Telecasts: the 29th Grammys; the 30th Grammys; and the 31st Grammys.

In 2015, Crystal co-starred alongside <a href="Josh%20Gad">Josh Gad</a> on the <a href="FX%20%28TV%20channel%29">FX</a> comedy series "<a href="The%20Comedians%20%282015%20TV%20series%29">The Comedians</a>", which ran for just one season before being canceled.

Crystal's first film role was in <a href="Joan%20Rivers">Joan Rivers</a>' 1978 film "<a href="Rabbit%20Test%20%28film%29">Rabbit Test</a>".

Crystal appeared briefly in the <a href="Rob%20Reiner">Rob Reiner</a> "<a href="rockumentary">rockumentary</a>" "<a href="This%20Is%20Spinal%20Tap">This Is Spinal Tap</a>" (1984) as Morty The Mime, a waiter dressed as a mime at one of Spinal Tap's parties. He shared the scene with a then-unknown, non-speaking <a href="Dana%20Carvey">Dana Carvey</a>, stating famously that "Mime is money." He later starred in the action comedy "<a href="Running%20Scared%20%281986%20film%29">Running Scared</a>" (1986) and was directed by Reiner again in "<a href="The%20Princess%20Bride%20%28film%29">The Princess Bride</a>" (1987), in a comedic supporting role as "Miracle Max." Reiner got Crystal to accept the part by saying, "How would you like to play Mel Brooks?" Reiner also allowed Crystal to ad-lib, and his parting shot, "Have fun storming the castle!" is a frequently-quoted line.

Reiner directed Crystal for a third time in the romantic comedy "<a href="When%20Harry%20Met%20Sally...">When Harry Met Sally...</a>" (1989), in which Crystal starred alongside <a href="Meg%20Ryan">Meg Ryan</a> and for which he was nominated for a <a href="Golden%20Globe">Golden Globe</a>. The film has since become an iconic classic for the genre and is Crystal's most celebrated film. Crystal then starred in the award-winning buddy comedy "<a href="City%20Slickers">City Slickers</a>" (1991), which proved very successful both commercially and critically and for which Crystal was nominated for his second Golden Globe. The film was followed by a sequel, which was less successful. In 1992, he narrated "<a href="Dr.%20Seuss">Dr. Seuss</a> Video Classics: <a href="Horton%20Hatches%20the%20Egg">Horton Hatches the Egg</a>".

Following the significant success of these films, Crystal wrote, directed, and starred in "<a href="Mr.%20Saturday%20Night">Mr. Saturday Night</a>" (1992) and "<a href="Forget%20Paris">Forget Paris</a>" (1995). In the former, Crystal played a serious role in aging makeup, as an egotistical comedian who reflects back on his career, although the character was from his "SNL" days. Though some of his subsequent films were not as well received as his earlier hits, Crystal had another success alongside <a href="Robert%20De%20Niro">Robert De Niro</a> in <a href="Harold%20Ramis">Harold Ramis</a>' mobster comedy "<a href="Analyze%20This">Analyze This</a>" (1999). More recent performances include roles in "<a href="America%27s%20Sweethearts">America's Sweethearts</a>" (2001), the sequel "<a href="Analyze%20That">Analyze That</a>" (2002), and "<a href="Parental%20Guidance%20%28film%29">Parental Guidance</a>" (2012).

He directed the made-for-television movie "<a href="61%2A">61*</a>" (2001) based on <a href="Roger%20Maris">Roger Maris</a>'s and <a href="Mickey%20Mantle">Mickey Mantle</a>'s race to break <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>'s single-season home run record in 1961. This earned Crystal an <a href="Emmy">Emmy</a> nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special.

Crystal was originally asked to voice <a href="Buzz%20Lightyear">Buzz Lightyear</a> in "<a href="Toy%20Story">Toy Story</a>" (1995) but turned it down, a decision he later regretted due to the popularity of the series. Crystal later went on to provide the voice of Mike Wazowski in the blockbuster Pixar film "<a href="Monsters%2C%20Inc.">Monsters, Inc.</a>" (2001), and reprised his voice role in the prequel, "<a href="Monsters%20University">Monsters University</a>", which was released in June 2013. Crystal also provided the voice of <a href="Calcifer">Calcifer</a> in the English version of <a href="Hayao%20Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a>'s "<a href="Howl%27s%20Moving%20Castle%20%28film%29">Howl's Moving Castle</a>" (2004).

Crystal hosted the <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a> broadcast in 1990–1993, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2004 and 2012. His hosting was critically praised, resulting in two Emmy wins for hosting and writing the 63rd Academy Awards and an Emmy win for writing the 64th Academy Awards. He returned recently as the host for the 2012 Oscar ceremony, after <a href="Eddie%20Murphy">Eddie Murphy</a> resigned from hosting. His nine times as the M.C. is second only to <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a>'s 18 in most ceremonies hosted. At the <a href="83rd%20Academy%20Awards">83rd Academy Awards</a> ceremony in 2011, he appeared as a presenter for a digitally inserted Bob Hope and before doing so was given a standing ovation. Film critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> said when Crystal came onstage about two hours into the show, he got the first laughs of the broadcast. Crystal's hosting gigs have regularly included an introductory video segment in which he comedically inserts himself into scenes of that year's nominees in addition to a song following his opening monologue.

Crystal won the 2005 <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a> for <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Special%20Theatrical%20Event">Best Special Theatrical Event</a> for "<a href="700%20Sundays">700 Sundays</a>", a two-act, <a href="One-person%20show">one-man play</a>, which he conceived and wrote about his parents and his childhood growing up on <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>. He toured throughout the US with the show in 2006 and then Australia in 2007.

Following the initial success of the play, Crystal wrote the book "700 Sundays" for <a href="Warner%20Books">Warner Books</a>, which was published on October 31, 2005. In conjunction with the book and the play that also paid tribute to his uncle, <a href="Milt%20Gabler">Milt Gabler</a>, Crystal produced two CD compilations: "Billy Crystal Presents: The Milt Gabler Story", which featured his uncle's most influential recordings from <a href="Billie%20Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>'s "<a href="Strange%20Fruit">Strange Fruit</a>" to "<a href="Rock%20Around%20the%20Clock">Rock Around the Clock</a>" by <a href="Bill%20Haley%20%26amp%3B%20His%20Comets">Bill Haley & His Comets</a>; and "Billy Remembers Billie" featuring Crystal's favorite Holiday recordings.

In the fall of 2013, he brought the show back to Broadway for a two-month run at the <a href="Imperial%20Theatre">Imperial Theatre</a>. <a href="HBO">HBO</a> filmed the January 3–4, 2014 performances for a special, which debuted on their network on April 19, 2014.

In 1986, Crystal started hosting "<a href="Comic%20Relief%20USA">Comic Relief</a>" on <a href="Home%20Box%20Office">HBO</a> with <a href="Robin%20Williams">Robin Williams</a> and <a href="Whoopi%20Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>. Founded by <a href="Bob%20Zmuda">Bob Zmuda</a>, Comic Relief raises money for <a href="homeless%20people%20in%20the%20United%20States">homeless people in the United States</a>.

On September 6, 2005, on "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20with%20Jay%20Leno">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a>", Crystal and <a href="Jay%20Leno">Jay Leno</a> were the first celebrities to sign a <a href="Harley-Davidson">Harley-Davidson</a> motorcycle to be auctioned off for Gulf Coast relief.

Crystal has participated in the <a href="Simon%20Wiesenthal%20Center">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> <a href="Museum%20of%20Tolerance">Museum of Tolerance</a> in Los Angeles. Portraying himself in a video, Crystal introduces museum guests to the genealogy wing of the museum.

On March 12, 2008, Crystal signed a one-day minor league contract to play with the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>, and was invited to the team's major league spring training. He wore uniform number 60 in honor of his upcoming 60th birthday. On March 13, in a spring training game against the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>, Crystal led off as the <a href="designated%20hitter">designated hitter</a>. He managed to make contact, fouling a <a href="fastball">fastball</a> up the <a href="first%20base">first base</a> line, but was eventually struck out by Pirates pitcher <a href="Paul%20Maholm">Paul Maholm</a> on six pitches and was later replaced in the batting order by <a href="Johnny%20Damon">Johnny Damon</a>. He was released on March 14, his 60th birthday.

Crystal's boyhood idol was Yankee Hall of Fame legend <a href="Mickey%20Mantle">Mickey Mantle</a> who had signed a program for him when Crystal attended a game where Mantle had hit a home run. Years later on "<a href="The%20Dinah%20Shore%20Show">The Dinah Shore Show</a>", in one of his first television appearances, Crystal met Mantle in person and had Mantle re-sign the same program. Crystal would be good friends with Mickey Mantle until Mantle's death in 1995. He and <a href="Bob%20Costas">Bob Costas</a> together wrote the eulogy Costas read at Mantle's funeral, and <a href="George%20Steinbrenner">George Steinbrenner</a> then invited Crystal to emcee the unveiling of Mantle's monument at <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Yankee Stadium</a>. In his 2013 memoir "Still Foolin' 'Em", Crystal writes that after the ceremony, near the Yankee clubhouse, he was punched in the stomach by <a href="Joe%20DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a>, who was angry at Crystal for not having introduced him to the crowd as the "Greatest living player."

Crystal also was well known for his impressions of Yankee Hall of Famer turned broadcaster <a href="Phil%20Rizzuto">Phil Rizzuto</a>. Rizzuto, known for his quirks calling games, did not travel to <a href="Anaheim%2C%20California">Anaheim, California</a> in 1996 to call the game for <a href="WPIX">WPIX</a>. Instead, Crystal joined the broadcasters in the booth and pretended to be Rizzuto for a few minutes during the August 31 game.

Although a lifelong Yankee fan, he is a part-owner of the <a href="Arizona%20Diamondbacks">Arizona Diamondbacks</a>, even earning a <a href="World%20Series%20ring">World Series ring</a> in 2001 when the Diamondbacks beat his beloved Yankees.

In "City Slickers", Crystal wears a <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a> baseball cap. In the 1986 film "<a href="Running%20Scared%20%281986%20film%29">Running Scared</a>", his character is an avid <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> fan, wearing a Cubs' jersey in several scenes. In the 2012 film "<a href="Parental%20Guidance%20%28film%29">Parental Guidance</a>", his character is the announcer for the <a href="Fresno%20Grizzlies">Fresno Grizzlies</a>, a <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">Minor League Baseball</a> team, and aspires to announce for their <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League affiliate</a>, the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Giants">San Francisco Giants</a>.

Crystal is also a longtime <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Clippers">Los Angeles Clippers</a> fan.

Crystal and his wife Janice (née Goldfinger) married in June 1970, have two daughters, actress <a href="Jennifer%20Crystal%20Foley">Jennifer</a> and producer Lindsay, and are grandparents.
They reside in the <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> neighborhood of <a href="Pacific%20Palisades%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Pacific Palisades, California</a>.

Black hole

A black hole is a region of <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a> exhibiting such strong <a href="gravitation">gravitation</a>al effects that nothing—not even <a href="particle">particle</a>s and <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> such as <a href="light">light</a>—can escape from inside it. The theory of <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a> predicts that a sufficiently compact <a href="mass">mass</a> can deform <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a> to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the <a href="event%20horizon">event horizon</a>. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal <a href="black%20body">black body</a>, as it reflects no light. Moreover, <a href="quantum%20field%20theory%20in%20curved%20spacetime">quantum field theory in curved spacetime</a> predicts that event horizons emit <a href="Hawking%20radiation">Hawking radiation</a>, with <a href="thermal%20radiation">the same spectrum</a> as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for <a href="stellar%20black%20hole">black holes of stellar mass</a>, making it essentially impossible to observe.

Objects whose <a href="gravitational%20field">gravitational field</a>s are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by <a href="John%20Michell">John Michell</a> and <a href="Pierre-Simon%20Laplace">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a>. The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by <a href="Karl%20Schwarzschild">Karl Schwarzschild</a> in 1916, although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by <a href="David%20Finkelstein">David Finkelstein</a> in 1958. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>s sparked interest in <a href="gravitational%20collapse">gravitationally collapsed</a> compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality.

Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, <a href="supermassive%20black%20hole">supermassive black hole</a>s of millions of <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>es () may form. There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most <a href="galaxy">galaxies</a>.

Despite its invisible interior, the presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other <a href="matter">matter</a> and with <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> such as visible light. Matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external <a href="accretion%20disk">accretion disk</a> heated by friction, forming some of the <a href="Quasar">brightest objects in the universe</a>. If there are other stars orbiting a black hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location. Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in <a href="binary%20star">binary systems</a>, and established that the radio source known as <a href="Sagittarius%20A%2A">Sagittarius A*</a>, at the core of our own <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>es.

On 11 February 2016, the <a href="LIGO">LIGO</a> collaboration <a href="first%20observation%20of%20gravitational%20waves">announced the first observation</a> of <a href="gravitational%20waves">gravitational waves</a>; because these waves were generated from a black hole merger it was the first ever direct detection of a binary black hole merger. On 15 June 2016, a second detection of a gravitational wave event from colliding black holes was announced.

The idea of a body so massive that even light could not escape was briefly proposed by astronomical pioneer and English clergyman <a href="John%20Michell">John Michell</a> in a letter published in November 1784. Michell's simplistic calculations assumed that such a body might have the same density as the Sun, and concluded that such a body would form when a star's diameter exceeds the Sun's by a factor of 500, and the surface <a href="escape%20velocity">escape velocity</a> exceeds the usual speed of light. Michell correctly noted that such supermassive but non-radiating bodies might be detectable through their gravitational effects on nearby visible bodies. Scholars of the time were initially excited by the proposal that giant but invisible stars might be hiding in plain view, but enthusiasm dampened when the wavelike nature of light became apparent in the early nineteenth century. If light were a wave rather than a "<a href="corpuscle">corpuscle</a>", it became unclear what, if any, influence gravity would have on escaping light waves. Modern relativity factually dispels Michell's notion of a light ray shooting directly from the surface of a supermassive star, being slowed down by the star's gravity, stopping, and then free-falling back to the star's surface.

In 1915, <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> developed his theory of <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>, having earlier shown that gravity does influence light's motion. Only a few months later, <a href="Karl%20Schwarzschild">Karl Schwarzschild</a> found a <a href="Schwarzschild%20metric">solution</a> to the <a href="Einstein%20field%20equations">Einstein field equations</a>, which describes the <a href="gravitational%20field">gravitational field</a> of a <a href="point%20mass">point mass</a> and a spherical mass. A few months after Schwarzschild, Johannes Droste, a student of <a href="Hendrik%20Lorentz">Hendrik Lorentz</a>, independently gave the same solution for the point mass and wrote more extensively about its properties. This solution had a peculiar behaviour at what is now called the <a href="Schwarzschild%20radius">Schwarzschild radius</a>, where it became <a href="mathematical%20singularity">singular</a>, meaning that some of the terms in the Einstein equations became infinite. The nature of this surface was not quite understood at the time. In 1924, <a href="Arthur%20Eddington">Arthur Eddington</a> showed that the singularity disappeared after a change of coordinates (see <a href="Eddington%E2%80%93Finkelstein%20coordinates">Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates</a>), although it took until 1933 for <a href="Georges%20Lema%C3%AEtre">Georges Lemaître</a> to realize that this meant the singularity at the Schwarzschild radius was a non-physical <a href="coordinate%20singularity">coordinate singularity</a>. Arthur Eddington did however comment on the possibility of a star with mass compressed to the Schwarzschild radius in a 1926 book, noting that Einstein's theory allows us to rule out overly large densities for visible stars like Betelgeuse because "a star of 250 million km radius could not possibly have so high a density as the sun. Firstly, the force of gravitation would be so great that light would be unable to escape from it, the rays falling back to the star like a stone to the earth. Secondly, the red shift of the spectral lines would be so great that the spectrum would be shifted out of existence. Thirdly, the mass would produce so much curvature of the space-time metric that space would close up around the star, leaving us outside (i.e., nowhere)."

In 1931, <a href="Subrahmanyan%20Chandrasekhar">Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar</a> calculated, using special relativity, that a non-rotating body of <a href="electron-degenerate%20matter">electron-degenerate matter</a> above a certain limiting mass (now called the <a href="Chandrasekhar%20limit">Chandrasekhar limit</a> at ) has no stable solutions. His arguments were opposed by many of his contemporaries like Eddington and <a href="Lev%20Landau">Lev Landau</a>, who argued that some yet unknown mechanism would stop the collapse. They were partly correct: a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> slightly more massive than the Chandrasekhar limit will collapse into a <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>, which is itself stable because of the <a href="Pauli%20exclusion%20principle">Pauli exclusion principle</a>. But in 1939, <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a> and others predicted that neutron stars above approximately (the <a href="Tolman%E2%80%93Oppenheimer%E2%80%93Volkoff%20limit">Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit</a>) would collapse into black holes for the reasons presented by Chandrasekhar, and concluded that no law of physics was likely to intervene and stop at least some stars from collapsing to black holes.

Oppenheimer and his co-authors interpreted the singularity at the boundary of the Schwarzschild radius as indicating that this was the boundary of a bubble in which time stopped. This is a valid point of view for external observers, but not for infalling observers. Because of this property, the collapsed stars were called "frozen stars", because an outside observer would see the surface of the star frozen in time at the instant where its collapse takes it inside the Schwarzschild radius.

In 1958, <a href="David%20Finkelstein">David Finkelstein</a> identified the Schwarzschild surface as an <a href="event%20horizon">event horizon</a>, "a perfect unidirectional membrane: causal influences can cross it in only one direction". This did not strictly contradict Oppenheimer's results, but extended them to include the point of view of infalling observers. <a href="Eddington%E2%80%93Finkelstein%20coordinates">Finkelstein's solution</a> extended the Schwarzschild solution for the future of observers falling into a black hole. A <a href="Kruskal%E2%80%93Szekeres%20coordinates">complete extension</a> had already been found by <a href="Martin%20Kruskal">Martin Kruskal</a>, who was urged to publish it.

These results came at the beginning of the <a href="golden%20age%20of%20general%20relativity">golden age of general relativity</a>, which was marked by general relativity and black holes becoming mainstream subjects of research. This process was helped by the discovery of <a href="pulsar">pulsar</a>s in 1967, which, by 1969, were shown to be rapidly rotating <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>s. Until that time, neutron stars, like black holes, were regarded as just theoretical curiosities; but the discovery of pulsars showed their physical relevance and spurred a further interest in all types of compact objects that might be formed by gravitational collapse.

In this period more general black hole solutions were found. In 1963, <a href="Roy%20Kerr">Roy Kerr</a> found <a href="Kerr%20metric">the exact solution</a> for a <a href="rotating%20black%20hole">rotating black hole</a>. Two years later, <a href="Ezra%20T.%20Newman">Ezra Newman</a> found the <a href="axisymmetric">axisymmetric</a> solution for a black hole that is both rotating and <a href="electric%20charge">electrically charged</a>. Through the work of <a href="Werner%20Israel">Werner Israel</a>, <a href="Brandon%20Carter">Brandon Carter</a>, and David Robinson the <a href="no-hair%20theorem">no-hair theorem</a> emerged, stating that a stationary black hole solution is completely described by the three parameters of the <a href="Kerr%E2%80%93Newman%20metric">Kerr–Newman metric</a>: <a href="mass">mass</a>, <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a>, and <a href="electric%20charge">electric charge</a>.

At first, it was suspected that the strange features of the black hole solutions were pathological artifacts from the symmetry conditions imposed, and that the singularities would not appear in generic situations. This view was held in particular by <a href="Vladimir%20A.%20Belinsky">Vladimir Belinsky</a>, <a href="Isaak%20Markovich%20Khalatnikov">Isaak Khalatnikov</a>, and <a href="Evgeny%20Lifshitz">Evgeny Lifshitz</a>, who tried to prove that no singularities appear in generic solutions. However, in the late 1960s <a href="Roger%20Penrose">Roger Penrose</a> and <a href="Stephen%20Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> used global techniques to prove that singularities appear generically.

Work by <a href="James%20M.%20Bardeen">James Bardeen</a>, <a href="Jacob%20Bekenstein">Jacob Bekenstein</a>, Carter, and Hawking in the early 1970s led to the formulation of <a href="black%20hole%20thermodynamics">black hole thermodynamics</a>. These laws describe the behaviour of a black hole in close analogy to the <a href="laws%20of%20thermodynamics">laws of thermodynamics</a> by relating mass to energy, area to <a href="entropy">entropy</a>, and <a href="surface%20gravity">surface gravity</a> to <a href="temperature">temperature</a>. The analogy was completed when Hawking, in 1974, showed that <a href="quantum%20field%20theory">quantum field theory</a> predicts that black holes should radiate like a <a href="black%20body">black body</a> with a temperature proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole.

The first use of the term "black hole" in print was by science journalist Ann Ewing in her article ""'Black Holes' in Space"",
dated 18 January 1964, which was a report on a meeting of the <a href="American%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Science">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> held in Cleveland, Ohio.

In December 1967, a student reportedly suggested the phrase "black hole" at a lecture by <a href="John%20Archibald%20Wheeler">John Wheeler</a>; Wheeler adopted the term for its brevity and "advertising value", and it quickly caught on, leading some to credit Wheeler with coining the phrase.

The <a href="no-hair%20theorem">no-hair theorem</a> states that, once it achieves a stable condition after formation, a black hole has only three independent physical properties: <a href="mass">mass</a>, <a href="electric%20charge">charge</a>, and <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a>. Any two black holes that share the same values for these properties, or parameters, are indistinguishable according to <a href="classical%20mechanics">classical</a> (i.e. non-<a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum</a>) mechanics.

These properties are special because they are visible from outside a black hole. For example, a charged black hole repels other like charges just like any other charged object. Similarly, the total mass inside a sphere containing a black hole can be found by using the gravitational analog of <a href="Gauss%27s%20law">Gauss's law</a>, the <a href="ADM%20mass">ADM mass</a>, far away from the black hole. Likewise, the angular momentum can be measured from far away using <a href="frame%20dragging">frame dragging</a> by the <a href="gravitomagnetism">gravitomagnetic field</a>.

When an object falls into a black hole, any <a href="physical%20information">information</a> about the shape of the object or distribution of charge on it is evenly distributed along the horizon of the black hole, and is lost to outside observers. The behavior of the horizon in this situation is a <a href="dissipative%20system">dissipative system</a> that is closely analogous to that of a conductive stretchy membrane with friction and <a href="electrical%20resistance">electrical resistance</a>—the <a href="membrane%20paradigm">membrane paradigm</a>. This is different from other <a href="field%20theory%20%28physics%29">field theories</a> such as electromagnetism, which do not have any friction or resistivity at the microscopic level, because they are <a href="T-symmetry">time-reversible</a>. Because a black hole eventually achieves a stable state with only three parameters, there is no way to avoid losing information about the initial conditions: the gravitational and electric fields of a black hole give very little information about what went in. The information that is lost includes every quantity that cannot be measured far away from the black hole horizon, including <a href="Conservation%20law%20%28physics%29">approximately conserved</a> <a href="quantum%20number">quantum number</a>s such as the total <a href="baryon%20number">baryon number</a> and <a href="lepton%20number">lepton number</a>. This behavior is so puzzling that it has been called the <a href="black%20hole%20information%20loss%20paradox">black hole information loss paradox</a>.

The simplest static black holes have mass but neither electric charge nor angular momentum. These black holes are often referred to as <a href="Schwarzschild%20metric">Schwarzschild black hole</a>s after Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this <a href="Solutions%20of%20the%20Einstein%20field%20equations">solution</a> in 1916. According to <a href="Birkhoff%27s%20theorem%20%28relativity%29">Birkhoff's theorem</a>, it is the only <a href="Vacuum%20solution%20%28general%20relativity%29">vacuum solution</a> that is <a href="Spherically%20symmetric%20spacetime">spherically symmetric</a>. This means that there is no observable difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and that of any other spherical object of the same mass. The popular notion of a black hole "sucking in everything" in its surroundings is therefore only correct near a black hole's horizon; far away, the external gravitational field is identical to that of any other body of the same mass.

Solutions describing more general black holes also exist. Non-rotating <a href="charged%20black%20hole">charged black hole</a>s are described by the <a href="Reissner%E2%80%93Nordstr%C3%B6m%20metric">Reissner–Nordström metric</a>, while the <a href="Kerr%20metric">Kerr metric</a> describes a non-charged <a href="rotating%20black%20hole">rotating black hole</a>. The most general <a href="stationary%20spacetime">stationary</a> black hole solution known is the <a href="Kerr%E2%80%93Newman%20metric">Kerr–Newman metric</a>, which describes a black hole with both charge and angular momentum.

While the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, the charge and angular momentum are constrained by the mass. In <a href="Planck%20units">Planck units</a>, the total electric charge "Q" and the total angular momentum "J" are expected to satisfy

for a black hole of mass "M". Black holes satisfying this inequality are called <a href="extremal%20black%20hole">extremal</a>. Solutions of Einstein's equations that violate this inequality exist, but they do not possess an event horizon. These solutions have so-called <a href="naked%20singularity">naked singularities</a> that can be observed from the outside, and hence are deemed "unphysical". The <a href="cosmic%20censorship%20hypothesis">cosmic censorship hypothesis</a> rules out the formation of such singularities, when they are created through the gravitational collapse of <a href="energy%20conditions">realistic matter</a>. This is supported by numerical simulations.

Due to the relatively large strength of the <a href="electromagnetism">electromagnetic force</a>, black holes forming from the collapse of stars are expected to retain the nearly neutral charge of the star. Rotation, however, is expected to be a universal feature of compact objects. The black-hole candidate binary X-ray source <a href="GRS%201915%2B105">GRS 1915+105</a> appears to have an angular momentum near the maximum allowed value.
Black holes are commonly classified according to their mass, independent of angular momentum "J" or electric charge "Q". The size of a black hole, as determined by the radius of the event horizon, or <a href="Schwarzschild%20radius">Schwarzschild radius</a>, is roughly proportional to the mass "M" through
where "r" is the Schwarzschild radius and "M" is the <a href="solar%20mass">mass of the Sun</a>. This relation is exact only for black holes with zero charge and angular momentum; for more general black holes it can differ up to a factor of 2.

The defining feature of a black hole is the appearance of an event horizon—a boundary in <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a> through which matter and light can only pass inward towards the mass of the black hole. Nothing, not even light, can escape from inside the event horizon. The event horizon is referred to as such because if an event occurs within the boundary, information from that event cannot reach an outside observer, making it impossible to determine if such an event occurred.

As predicted by general relativity, the presence of a mass deforms spacetime in such a way that the paths taken by particles bend towards the mass. At the event horizon of a black hole, this deformation becomes so strong that there are no paths that lead away from the black hole.

To a distant observer, clocks near a black hole appear to tick more slowly than those further away from the black hole. Due to this effect, known as <a href="gravitational%20time%20dilation">gravitational time dilation</a>, an object falling into a black hole appears to slow as it approaches the event horizon, taking an infinite time to reach it. At the same time, all processes on this object slow down, from the view point of a fixed outside observer, causing any light emitted by the object to appear redder and dimmer, an effect known as <a href="gravitational%20redshift">gravitational redshift</a>. Eventually, the falling object becomes so dim that it can no longer be seen.

On the other hand, indestructible observers falling into a black hole do not notice any of these effects as they cross the event horizon. According to their own clocks, which appear to them to tick normally, they cross the event horizon after a finite time without noting any singular behaviour; it is impossible to determine the location of the event horizon from local observations.

The shape of the event horizon of a black hole is always approximately spherical. For non-rotating (static) black holes the geometry of the event horizon is precisely spherical, while for rotating black holes the sphere is oblate.

At the center of a black hole, as described by general relativity, lies a <a href="gravitational%20singularity">gravitational singularity</a>, a region where the spacetime curvature becomes infinite. For a non-rotating black hole, this region takes the shape of a single point and for a <a href="rotating%20black%20hole">rotating black hole</a>, it is smeared out to form a <a href="ring%20singularity">ring singularity</a> that lies in the plane of rotation. In both cases, the singular region has zero volume. It can also be shown that the singular region contains all the mass of the black hole solution. The singular region can thus be thought of as having infinite <a href="mass%20density">density</a>.

Observers falling into a Schwarzschild black hole ("i.e.", non-rotating and not charged) cannot avoid being carried into the singularity, once they cross the event horizon. They can prolong the experience by accelerating away to slow their descent, but only up to a limit; after attaining a certain ideal velocity, it is best to <a href="free%20fall">free fall</a> the rest of the way. When they reach the singularity, they are crushed to infinite density and their mass is added to the total of the black hole. Before that happens, they will have been torn apart by the growing <a href="tidal%20force">tidal force</a>s in a process sometimes referred to as <a href="spaghettification">spaghettification</a> or the "noodle effect".

In the case of a charged (Reissner–Nordström) or rotating (Kerr) black hole, it is possible to avoid the singularity. Extending these solutions as far as possible reveals the hypothetical possibility of exiting the black hole into a different spacetime with the black hole acting as a <a href="wormhole">wormhole</a>. The possibility of traveling to another universe is, however, only theoretical since any perturbation would destroy this possibility. It also appears to be possible to follow <a href="closed%20timelike%20curve">closed timelike curve</a>s (returning to one's own past) around the Kerr singularity, which lead to problems with <a href="causality%20%28physics%29">causality</a> like the <a href="grandfather%20paradox">grandfather paradox</a>. It is expected that none of these peculiar effects would survive in a proper quantum treatment of rotating and charged black holes.

The appearance of singularities in general relativity is commonly perceived as signaling the breakdown of the theory. This breakdown, however, is expected; it occurs in a situation where <a href="quantum%20effects">quantum effects</a> should describe these actions, due to the extremely high density and therefore particle interactions. To date, it has not been possible to combine quantum and gravitational effects into a single theory, although there exist attempts to formulate such a theory of <a href="quantum%20gravity">quantum gravity</a>. It is generally expected that such a theory will not feature any singularities.

The photon sphere is a spherical boundary of zero thickness in which <a href="photon">photon</a>s that move on <a href="tangent">tangent</a>s to that sphere would be trapped in a circular orbit about the black hole. For non-rotating black holes, the photon sphere has a radius 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius. Their orbits would be <a href="instability">dynamically unstable</a>, hence any small perturbation, such as a particle of infalling matter, would cause an instability that would grow over time, either setting the photon on an outward trajectory causing it to escape the black hole, or on an inward spiral where it would eventually cross the event horizon.

While light can still escape from the photon sphere, any light that crosses the photon sphere on an inbound trajectory will be captured by the black hole. Hence any light that reaches an outside observer from the photon sphere must have been emitted by objects between the photon sphere and the event horizon.

Other <a href="compact%20object">compact object</a>s, such as <a href="neutron%20stars">neutron stars</a>, can also have photon spheres. This follows from the fact that the gravitational field "external" to a spherically-symmetric object is governed by the <a href="Schwarzschild%20metric">Schwarzschild metric</a>, which depends only on the object's mass rather than the radius of the object, hence any object whose radius shrinks to smaller than 1.5 times the Schwarzschild radius will have a photon sphere.

Rotating black holes are surrounded by a region of spacetime in which it is impossible to stand still, called the ergosphere. This is the result of a process known as <a href="frame-dragging">frame-dragging</a>; general relativity predicts that any rotating mass will tend to slightly "drag" along the spacetime immediately surrounding it. Any object near the rotating mass will tend to start moving in the direction of rotation. For a rotating black hole, this effect is so strong near the event horizon that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light in the opposite direction to just stand still.

The ergosphere of a black hole is a volume whose inner boundary is the black hole's <a href="oblate%20spheroid">oblate spheroid</a> event horizon and a pumpkin-shaped outer boundary, which coincides with the event horizon at the poles but noticeably wider around the equator. The outer boundary is sometimes called the "ergosurface".

Objects and radiation can escape normally from the ergosphere. Through the <a href="Penrose%20process">Penrose process</a>, objects can emerge from the ergosphere with more energy than they entered. This energy is taken from the rotational energy of the black hole causing the latter to slow.

In <a href="Newton%27s%20law%20of%20universal%20gravitation">Newtonian gravity</a>, <a href="test%20particle">test particle</a>s can stably orbit at arbitrary distances from a central object. In <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>, however, there exists an innermost stable circular orbit (often called the ISCO), inside of which, any infinitesimal perturbations to a circular orbit will lead to inspiral into the black hole. The location of the ISCO depends on the spin of the black hole, in the case of a Schwarzschild black hole (spin zero) is:

and decreases with increasing spin.

Considering the exotic nature of black holes, it may be natural to question if such bizarre objects could exist in nature or to suggest that they are merely pathological solutions to Einstein's equations. Einstein himself wrongly thought that black holes would not form, because he held that the angular momentum of collapsing particles would stabilize their motion at some radius. This led the general relativity community to dismiss all results to the contrary for many years. However, a minority of relativists continued to contend that black holes were physical objects, and by the end of the 1960s, they had persuaded the majority of researchers in the field that there is no obstacle to the formation of an event horizon.

Penrose proved that once an event horizon forms, general relativity without quantum mechanics requires that a singularity will form within. Shortly afterwards, Hawking showed that many cosmological solutions that describe the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a> have singularities without <a href="Scalar%20field">scalar fields</a> or other <a href="exotic%20matter">exotic matter</a> (see "<a href="Penrose%E2%80%93Hawking%20singularity%20theorems">Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems</a>"). The <a href="Kerr%20solution">Kerr solution</a>, the <a href="no-hair%20theorem">no-hair theorem</a>, and the laws of <a href="black%20hole%20thermodynamics">black hole thermodynamics</a> showed that the physical properties of black holes were simple and comprehensible, making them respectable subjects for research. The primary formation process for black holes is expected to be the <a href="gravitational%20collapse">gravitational collapse</a> of heavy objects such as stars, but there are also more exotic processes that can lead to the production of black holes.

Gravitational collapse occurs when an object's internal <a href="pressure">pressure</a> is insufficient to resist the object's own gravity. For stars this usually occurs either because a star has too little "fuel" left to maintain its temperature through <a href="stellar%20nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a>, or because a star that would have been stable receives extra matter in a way that does not raise its core temperature. In either case the star's temperature is no longer high enough to prevent it from collapsing under its own weight.
The collapse may be stopped by the <a href="degeneracy%20pressure">degeneracy pressure</a> of the star's constituents, allowing the condensation of matter into an exotic <a href="Degenerate%20matter">denser state</a>. The result is one of the various types of <a href="compact%20star">compact star</a>. The type of compact star formed depends on the mass of the remnant of the original star left after the outer layers have been blown away. Such explosions and pulsations lead to <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a>. This mass can be substantially less than the original star. Remnants exceeding are produced by stars that were over before the collapse.

If the mass of the remnant exceeds about (the <a href="Tolman%E2%80%93Oppenheimer%E2%80%93Volkoff%20limit">Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit</a>), either because the original star was very heavy or because the remnant collected additional mass through accretion of matter, even the degeneracy pressure of <a href="neutrons">neutrons</a> is insufficient to stop the collapse. No known mechanism (except possibly quark degeneracy pressure, see <a href="quark%20star">quark star</a>) is powerful enough to stop the implosion and the object will inevitably collapse to form a black hole.

The gravitational collapse of heavy stars is assumed to be responsible for the formation of <a href="stellar%20mass%20black%20hole">stellar mass black hole</a>s. <a href="Star%20formation">Star formation</a> in the early universe may have resulted in very massive stars, which upon their collapse would have produced black holes of up to . These black holes could be the seeds of the supermassive black holes found in the centers of most galaxies. It has further been suggested that supermassive black holes with typical masses of ~ could have formed from the direct collapse of gas clouds in the young universe. Some candidates for such objects have been found in observations of the young universe.

While most of the energy released during gravitational collapse is emitted very quickly, an outside observer does not actually see the end of this process. Even though the collapse takes a finite amount of time from the <a href="frame%20of%20reference">reference frame</a> of infalling matter, a distant observer would see the infalling material slow and halt just above the event horizon, due to <a href="gravitational%20time%20dilation">gravitational time dilation</a>. Light from the collapsing material takes longer and longer to reach the observer, with the light emitted just before the event horizon forms delayed an infinite amount of time. Thus the external observer never sees the formation of the event horizon; instead, the collapsing material seems to become dimmer and increasingly red-shifted, eventually fading away.

Gravitational collapse requires great density. In the current epoch of the universe these high densities are only found in stars, but in the early universe shortly after the <a href="big%20bang">big bang</a> densities were much greater, possibly allowing for the creation of black holes. The high density alone is not enough to allow the formation of black holes since a uniform mass distribution will not allow the mass to bunch up. In order for <a href="primordial%20black%20holes">primordial black holes</a> to form in such a dense medium, there must be initial density perturbations that can then grow under their own gravity. Different models for the early universe vary widely in their predictions of the size of these perturbations. Various models predict the creation of black holes, ranging from a <a href="Planck%20mass">Planck mass</a> to hundreds of thousands of solar masses. Primordial black holes could thus account for the creation of any type of black hole.

Despite the early universe being extremely <a href="density">dense</a>—far denser than is usually required to form a black hole—it did not re-collapse into a black hole during the big bang. This is because currently-known calculations and density limits for <a href="gravitational%20collapse">gravitational collapse</a> are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as <a href="star">star</a>s, and do not necessarily apply in the same way to rapidly expanding space such as the Big Bang.

Gravitational collapse is not the only process that could create black holes. In principle, black holes could be formed in <a href="high-energy%20physics">high-energy</a> collisions that achieve sufficient density. As of 2002, no such events have been detected, either directly or indirectly as a deficiency of the mass balance in <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a> experiments. This suggests that there must be a lower limit for the mass of black holes. Theoretically, this boundary is expected to lie around the <a href="Planck%20mass">Planck mass</a> ("m" = ≈ ≈ ), where quantum effects are expected to invalidate the predictions of general relativity. This would put the creation of black holes firmly out of reach of any high-energy process occurring on or near the Earth. However, certain developments in quantum gravity suggest that the Planck mass could be much lower: some <a href="braneworld">braneworld</a> scenarios for example put the boundary as low as . This would make it conceivable for <a href="micro%20black%20hole">micro black hole</a>s to be created in the high-energy collisions that occur when <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a>s hit the Earth's atmosphere, or possibly in the <a href="Large%20Hadron%20Collider">Large Hadron Collider</a> at <a href="CERN">CERN</a>. These theories are very speculative, and the creation of black holes in these processes is deemed unlikely by many specialists. Even if micro black holes could be formed, it is expected that they would <a href="black%20hole%20evaporation">evaporate</a> in about 10 seconds, posing no threat to the Earth.

Once a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing additional matter. Any black hole will continually absorb gas and <a href="interstellar%20dust">interstellar dust</a> from its surroundings and omnipresent <a href="cosmic%20background%20radiation">cosmic background radiation</a>. This is the primary process through which supermassive black holes seem to have grown. A similar process has been suggested for the formation of <a href="intermediate-mass%20black%20hole">intermediate-mass black hole</a>s found in <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a>s.

Another possibility for black hole growth, is for a black hole to merge with other objects such as stars or even other black holes. Although not necessary for growth, this is thought to have been important, especially for the early development of supermassive black holes, which could have formed from the coagulation of many smaller objects. The process has also been proposed as the origin of some <a href="intermediate-mass%20black%20hole">intermediate-mass black hole</a>s.

In 1974, Hawking predicted that black holes are not entirely black but emit small amounts of thermal radiation; this effect has become known as <a href="Hawking%20radiation">Hawking radiation</a>. By applying <a href="quantum%20field%20theory">quantum field theory</a> to a static black hole background, he determined that a black hole should emit particles that display a perfect <a href="black%20body%20spectrum">black body spectrum</a>. Since Hawking's publication, many others have verified the result through various approaches. If Hawking's theory of black hole radiation is correct, then black holes are expected to shrink and evaporate over time as they lose mass by the emission of photons and other particles. The temperature of this thermal spectrum (<a href="Hawking%20temperature">Hawking temperature</a>) is proportional to the <a href="surface%20gravity">surface gravity</a> of the black hole, which, for a Schwarzschild black hole, is inversely proportional to the mass. Hence, large black holes emit less radiation than small black holes.

A stellar black hole of has a Hawking temperature of about 100 <a href="nanokelvin">nanokelvin</a>s. This is far less than the 2.7 K temperature of the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background">cosmic microwave background</a> radiation. Stellar-mass or larger black holes receive more mass from the cosmic microwave background than they emit through Hawking radiation and thus will grow instead of shrink. To have a Hawking temperature larger than 2.7 K (and be able to evaporate), a black hole would need a mass less than the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>. Such a black hole would have a diameter of less than a tenth of a millimeter.

If a black hole is very small, the radiation effects are expected to become very strong. Even a black hole that is heavy compared to a human would evaporate in an instant. A black hole with the mass of a car would have a diameter of about 10 m and take a nanosecond to evaporate, during which time it would briefly have a luminosity of more than 200 times that of the Sun. Lower-mass black holes are expected to evaporate even faster; for example, a black hole of mass 1 TeV/"c" would take less than 10 seconds to evaporate completely. For such a small black hole, <a href="quantum%20gravity">quantum gravitation</a> effects are expected to play an important role and could hypothetically make such a small black hole stable, although current developments in quantum gravity do not indicate so.

The Hawking radiation for an astrophysical black hole is predicted to be very weak and would thus be exceedingly difficult to detect from Earth. A possible exception, however, is the burst of gamma rays emitted in the last stage of the evaporation of primordial black holes. Searches for such flashes have proven unsuccessful and provide stringent limits on the possibility of existence of low mass primordial black holes. NASA's <a href="Fermi%20Gamma-ray%20Space%20Telescope">Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope</a> launched in 2008 will continue the search for these flashes.

By their very nature, black holes do not directly emit any electromagnetic radiation other than the hypothetical <a href="Hawking%20radiation">Hawking radiation</a>, so astrophysicists searching for black holes must generally rely on indirect observations. For example, a black hole's existence can sometimes be inferred by observing its gravitational interactions with its surroundings.

The <a href="Event%20Horizon%20Telescope">Event Horizon Telescope</a> (EHT), however, run by MIT's <a href="Haystack%20Observatory">Haystack Observatory</a>, is an attempt to directly observe the immediate environment of the event horizon of <a href="Sagittarius%20A%2A">Sagittarius A*</a>, the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, and to produce a silhouetted image of it. The first such image may appear as early as 2018. In 2015, the EHT managed to detect magnetic fields just outside the event horizon of Sagittarius A*, and even discern some of their properties. The existence of magnetic fields had been predicted by theoretical studies of black holes.

On 14 September 2015 the <a href="LIGO">LIGO</a> gravitational wave observatory made the first-ever successful <a href="first%20observation%20of%20gravitational%20waves">observation of gravitational waves</a>. The signal was consistent with theoretical predictions for the gravitational waves produced by the merger of two black holes: one with about 36 <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>es, and the other around 29 solar masses. This observation provides the most concrete evidence for the existence of black holes to date. For instance, the gravitational wave signal suggests that the separation of the two objects prior to the merger was just 350 km (or roughly 4 times the Schwarzschild radius corresponding to the inferred masses). The objects must therefore have been extremely compact, leaving black holes as the most plausible interpretation.

More importantly, the signal observed by LIGO also included the start of the post-merger <a href="ringdown">ringdown</a>, the signal produced as the newly formed compact object settles down to a stationary state. Arguably, the ringdown is the most direct way of observing a black hole. From the LIGO signal it is possible to extract the frequency and damping time of the dominant mode of the ringdown. From these it is possible to infer the mass and angular momentum of the final object, which match independent predictions from numerical simulations of the merger. The frequency and decay time of the dominant mode are determined by the geometry of the photon sphere. Hence, observation of this mode confirms the presence of a photon sphere, however it cannot exclude possible exotic alternatives to black holes that are compact enough to have a photon sphere.

The observation also provides the first observational evidence for the existence of stellar-mass black hole binaries. Furthermore, it is the first observational evidence of stellar-mass black holes weighing 25 solar masses or more.

The <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a>s of stars near the center of our own <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> provide strong observational evidence that these stars are orbiting a supermassive black hole. Since 1995, astronomers have tracked the motions of 90 stars orbiting an invisible object coincident with the radio source Sagittarius A*. By fitting their motions to <a href="Keplerian%20orbit">Keplerian orbit</a>s, the astronomers were able to infer, in 1998, that a 2.6 million object must be contained in a volume with a radius of 0.02 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s to cause the motions of those stars. Since then, one of the stars—called <a href="S2%20%28star%29">S2</a>—has completed a full orbit. From the orbital data, astronomers were able to refine the calculations of the mass to 4.3 million and a radius of less than 0.002 light years for the object causing the orbital motion of those stars. The upper limit on the object's size is still too large to test whether it is smaller than its Schwarzschild radius; nevertheless, these observations strongly suggest that the central object is a supermassive black hole as there are no other plausible scenarios for confining so much invisible mass into such a small volume. Additionally, there is some observational evidence that this object might possess an event horizon, a feature unique to black holes.

Due to <a href="conservation%20of%20angular%20momentum">conservation of angular momentum</a>, gas falling into the <a href="gravitational%20well">gravitational well</a> created by a massive object will typically form a disc-like structure around the object. Artists' impressions such as the accompanying representation of a black hole with corona commonly depict the black hole as if it were a flat-space material body hiding the part of the disc just behind it, but detailed mathematical modelling shows that the image of the disc would actually be distorted by the bending of light that originated behind the black hole in such a way that the upper side of the disc would be entirely visible, while there would be a partially visible secondary image of the underside of the disk.
Within such a disc, friction would cause angular momentum to be transported outward, allowing matter to fall further inward, thus releasing potential energy and increasing the temperature of the gas.

As such, many of the universe's more energetic phenomena have been attributed to the accretion of matter on black holes. In particular, <a href="active%20galactic%20nucleus">active galactic nuclei</a> and <a href="quasar">quasar</a>s are believed to be the accretion discs of supermassive black holes. Similarly, X-ray binaries are generally accepted to be <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> systems in which one of the two stars is a compact object accreting matter from its companion. It has also been suggested that some <a href="ultraluminous%20X-ray%20source">ultraluminous X-ray source</a>s may be the accretion disks of <a href="intermediate-mass%20black%20hole">intermediate-mass black hole</a>s.

In November 2011 the first direct observation of a quasar accretion disk around a supermassive black hole was reported.

<a href="X-ray%20binaries">X-ray binaries</a> are <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> systems that emit a majority of their radiation in the <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> part of the spectrum. These X-ray emissions are generally thought to result when one of the stars (compact object) accretes matter from another (regular) star. The presence of an ordinary star in such a system provides a unique opportunity for studying the central object and to determine if it might be a black hole.

If such a system emits signals that can be directly traced back to the compact object, it cannot be a black hole. The absence of such a signal does, however, not exclude the possibility that the compact object is a neutron star. By studying the companion star it is often possible to obtain the orbital parameters of the system and to obtain an estimate for the mass of the compact object. If this is much larger than the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (that is, the maximum mass a neutron star can have before it collapses) then the object cannot be a neutron star and is generally expected to be a black hole.

The first strong candidate for a black hole, <a href="Cygnus%20X-1">Cygnus X-1</a>, was discovered in this way by <a href="Charles%20Thomas%20Bolton">Charles Thomas Bolton</a>, Louise Webster and Paul Murdin in 1972. Some doubt, however, remained due to the uncertainties that result from the companion star being much heavier than the candidate black hole. Currently, better candidates for black holes are found in a class of X-ray binaries called soft X-ray transients. In this class of system, the companion star is of relatively low mass allowing for more accurate estimates of the black hole mass. Moreover, these systems are actively emit X-rays for only several months once every 10–50 years. During the period of low X-ray emission (called quiescence), the accretion disc is extremely faint allowing detailed observation of the companion star during this period. One of the best such candidates is <a href="V404%20Cyg">V404 Cyg</a>.

The faintness of the accretion disc of an X-ray binary during quiescence is suspected to be caused by the flow of mass entering a mode called an <a href="advection-dominated%20accretion%20flow">advection-dominated accretion flow</a> (ADAF). In this mode, almost all the energy generated by friction in the disc is swept along with the flow instead of radiated away. If this model is correct, then it forms strong qualitative evidence for the presence of an event horizon, since if the object at the center of the disc had a solid surface, it would emit large amounts of radiation as the highly energetic gas hits the surface, an effect that is observed for neutron stars in a similar state.

The X-ray emissions from accretion disks sometimes flicker at certain frequencies. These signals are called <a href="quasi-periodic%20oscillations">quasi-periodic oscillations</a> and are thought to be caused by material moving along the inner edge of the accretion disk (the innermost stable circular orbit). As such their frequency is linked to the mass of the compact object. They can thus be used as an alternative way to determine the mass of candidate black holes.

Astronomers use the term "<a href="Active%20galactic%20nucleus">active galaxy</a>" to describe galaxies with unusual characteristics, such as unusual <a href="spectral%20line">spectral line</a> emission and very strong radio emission. Theoretical and observational studies have shown that the activity in these active galactic nuclei (AGN) may be explained by the presence of <a href="supermassive%20black%20hole">supermassive black hole</a>s, which can be millions of times more massive than stellar ones. The models of these AGN consist of a central black hole that may be millions or billions of times more massive than the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>; a disk of <a href="interstellar%20gas">gas</a> and <a href="interstellar%20dust">dust</a> called an accretion disk; and two <a href="relativistic%20jet">jets</a> perpendicular to the accretion disk.
Although supermassive black holes are expected to be found in most AGN, only some galaxies' nuclei have been more carefully studied in attempts to both identify and measure the actual masses of the central supermassive black hole candidates. Some of the most notable galaxies with supermassive black hole candidates include the <a href="Andromeda%20Galaxy">Andromeda Galaxy</a>, <a href="Messier%2032">M32</a>, <a href="Messier%2087">M87</a>, <a href="NGC%203115">NGC 3115</a>, <a href="NGC%203377">NGC 3377</a>, <a href="NGC%204258">NGC 4258</a>, <a href="NGC%204889">NGC 4889</a>, <a href="NGC%201277">NGC 1277</a>, <a href="OJ%20287">OJ 287</a>, <a href="APM%2008279%2B5255">APM 08279+5255</a> and the <a href="Sombrero%20Galaxy">Sombrero Galaxy</a>.

It is now widely accepted that the center of nearly every galaxy, not just active ones, contains a supermassive black hole. The close observational correlation between the mass of this hole and the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy's <a href="bulge%20%28astronomy%29">bulge</a>, known as the <a href="M-sigma%20relation">M-sigma relation</a>, strongly suggests a connection between the formation of the black hole and the galaxy itself.
Another way that the black hole nature of an object may be tested in the future is through observation of effects caused by a strong gravitational field in their vicinity. One such effect is <a href="gravitational%20lensing">gravitational lensing</a>: The deformation of spacetime around a massive object causes light rays to be deflected much as light passing through an optic <a href="Lens%20%28optics%29">lens</a>. Observations have been made of weak gravitational lensing, in which light rays are deflected by only a few <a href="arcseconds">arcseconds</a>. However, it has never been directly observed for a black hole. One possibility for observing gravitational lensing by a black hole would be to observe stars in orbit around the black hole. There are several candidates for such an observation in orbit around <a href="Sagittarius%20A%2A">Sagittarius A*</a>.

The evidence for stellar black holes strongly relies on the existence of an upper limit for the mass of a neutron star. The size of this limit heavily depends on the assumptions made about the properties of dense matter. New exotic <a href="Phase%20%28matter%29">phases of matter</a> could push up this bound. A phase of free <a href="quark">quark</a>s at high density might allow the existence of dense <a href="quark%20star">quark star</a>s, and some <a href="supersymmetry">supersymmetric</a> models predict the existence of <a href="Q%20star">Q star</a>s. Some extensions of the <a href="standard%20model">standard model</a> posit the existence of <a href="preon">preon</a>s as fundamental building blocks of quarks and <a href="lepton">lepton</a>s, which could hypothetically form <a href="preon%20star">preon star</a>s. These hypothetical models could potentially explain a number of observations of stellar black hole candidates. However, it can be shown from arguments in general relativity that any such object will have a maximum mass.

Since the average density of a black hole inside its Schwarzschild radius is inversely proportional to the square of its mass, supermassive black holes are much less dense than stellar black holes (the average density of a black hole is comparable to that of water). Consequently, the physics of matter forming a supermassive black hole is much better understood and the possible alternative explanations for supermassive black hole observations are much more mundane. For example, a supermassive black hole could be modelled by a large cluster of very dark objects. However, such alternatives are typically not stable enough to explain the supermassive black hole candidates.

The evidence for the existence of stellar and supermassive black holes implies that in order for black holes to not form, general relativity must fail as a theory of gravity, perhaps due to the onset of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanical</a> corrections. A much anticipated feature of a theory of quantum gravity is that it will not feature singularities or event horizons and thus black holes would not be real artifacts. In 2002, much attention has been drawn by the <a href="Fuzzball%20%28string%20theory%29">fuzzball</a> model in <a href="string%20theory">string theory</a>. Based on calculations for specific situations in string theory, the proposal suggests that generically the individual states of a black hole solution do not have an event horizon or singularity, but that for a classical/semi-classical observer the statistical average of such states appears just as an ordinary black hole as deduced from general relativity.

In 1971, Hawking showed under general conditions that the total area of the event horizons of any collection of classical black holes can never decrease, even if they collide and merge. This result, now known as the <a href="second%20law%20of%20black%20hole%20mechanics">second law of black hole mechanics</a>, is remarkably similar to the <a href="second%20law%20of%20thermodynamics">second law of thermodynamics</a>, which states that the total <a href="entropy">entropy</a> of a system can never decrease. As with classical objects at <a href="absolute%20zero">absolute zero</a> temperature, it was assumed that black holes had zero entropy. If this were the case, the second law of thermodynamics would be violated by entropy-laden matter entering a black hole, resulting in a decrease of the total entropy of the universe. Therefore, Bekenstein proposed that a black hole should have an entropy, and that it should be proportional to its horizon area.

The link with the laws of thermodynamics was further strengthened by Hawking's discovery that <a href="quantum%20field%20theory">quantum field theory</a> predicts that a black hole radiates <a href="blackbody%20radiation">blackbody radiation</a> at a constant temperature. This seemingly causes a violation of the second law of black hole mechanics, since the radiation will carry away energy from the black hole causing it to shrink. The radiation, however also carries away entropy, and it can be proven under general assumptions that the sum of the entropy of the matter surrounding a black hole and one quarter of the area of the horizon as measured in <a href="Planck%20units">Planck units</a> is in fact always increasing. This allows the formulation of the <a href="first%20law%20of%20black%20hole%20mechanics">first law of black hole mechanics</a> as an analogue of the <a href="first%20law%20of%20thermodynamics">first law of thermodynamics</a>, with the mass acting as energy, the surface gravity as temperature and the area as entropy.

One puzzling feature is that the entropy of a black hole scales with its area rather than with its volume, since entropy is normally an <a href="extensive%20quantity">extensive quantity</a> that scales linearly with the volume of the system. This odd property led <a href="Gerard%20%27t%20Hooft">Gerard 't Hooft</a> and <a href="Leonard%20Susskind">Leonard Susskind</a> to propose the <a href="holographic%20principle">holographic principle</a>, which suggests that anything that happens in a volume of spacetime can be described by data on the boundary of that volume.

Although general relativity can be used to perform a semi-classical calculation of black hole entropy, this situation is theoretically unsatisfying. In <a href="statistical%20mechanics">statistical mechanics</a>, entropy is understood as counting the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have the same macroscopic qualities (such as <a href="mass">mass</a>, <a href="Charge%20%28physics%29">charge</a>, <a href="pressure">pressure</a>, etc.). Without a satisfactory theory of <a href="quantum%20gravity">quantum gravity</a>, one cannot perform such a computation for black holes. Some progress has been made in various approaches to quantum gravity. In 1995, <a href="Andrew%20Strominger">Andrew Strominger</a> and <a href="Cumrun%20Vafa">Cumrun Vafa</a> showed that counting the microstates of a specific <a href="supersymmetry">supersymmetric</a> black hole in <a href="string%20theory">string theory</a> reproduced the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy. Since then, similar results have been reported for different black holes both in string theory and in other approaches to quantum gravity like <a href="loop%20quantum%20gravity">loop quantum gravity</a>.

Because a black hole has only a few internal parameters, most of the information about the matter that went into forming the black hole is lost. Regardless of the type of matter which goes into a black hole, it appears that only information concerning the total mass, charge, and angular momentum are conserved. As long as black holes were thought to persist forever this information loss is not that problematic, as the information can be thought of as existing inside the black hole, inaccessible from the outside. However, black holes slowly evaporate by emitting <a href="Hawking%20radiation">Hawking radiation</a>. This radiation does not appear to carry any additional information about the matter that formed the black hole, meaning that this information appears to be gone forever.

The question whether information is truly lost in black holes (the <a href="black%20hole%20information%20paradox">black hole information paradox</a>) has divided the theoretical physics community (see <a href="Thorne%E2%80%93Hawking%E2%80%93Preskill%20bet">Thorne–Hawking–Preskill bet</a>). In quantum mechanics, loss of information corresponds to the violation of vital property called <a href="unitarity%20%28physics%29">unitarity</a>, which has to do with the conservation of probability. It has been argued that loss of unitarity would also imply violation of conservation of energy. Over recent years evidence has been building that indeed information and unitarity are preserved in a full quantum gravitational treatment of the problem.

According to <a href="quantum%20field%20theory%20in%20curved%20spacetime">quantum field theory in curved spacetime</a>, a <a href="Black%20body%20radiation">single emission</a> of <a href="Hawking%20radiation">Hawking radiation</a> involves two mutually <a href="quantum%20entanglement">entangled</a> particles. The outgoing particle escapes and is emitted as a quantum of Hawking radiation; the infalling particle is swallowed by the black hole. Assume a black hole formed a finite time in the past and will fully evaporate away in some finite time in the future. Then, it will only emit a finite amount of information encoded within its Hawking radiation. Assume that at time formula_4, more than half of the information had already been emitted. According to widely accepted research by physicists like <a href="Don%20Page%20%28physicist%29">Don Page</a> and <a href="Leonard%20Susskind">Leonard Susskind</a>, an outgoing particle emitted at time formula_4 must be entangled with all the Hawking radiation the black hole has previously emitted. This creates a <a href="paradox">paradox</a>: a principle called "monogamy of entanglement" requires that, like any quantum system, the outgoing particle cannot be fully entangled with two independent systems at the same time; yet here the outgoing particle appears to be entangled with both the infalling particle and, independently, with past Hawking radiation.

In order to resolve the paradox, physicists may eventually be forced to give up one of three time-tested theories: Einstein's <a href="equivalence%20principle">equivalence principle</a>, <a href="Unitarity%20%28physics%29">unitarity</a>, or existing <a href="quantum%20field%20theory">quantum field theory</a>. One possible solution, which violates the equivalence principle, is that a "firewall" destroys incoming particles at the event horizon.<ref name="sciam/Confound"> <a href="http%3A//www.simonsfoundation.org/quanta/20121221-alice-and-bob-meet-the-wall-of-fire/">Originally published</a> in Quanta, December 21, 2012.</ref> A 2016 analysis of LIGO data shows tentative signs of echoes caused by a fuzzy event horizon; such echoes may be possible in firewall or <a href="fuzzball%20%28string%20theory%29">fuzzball</a> theories but should not occur in classical general relativity. Over the next two years, additional LIGO data should establish whether the echoes were just random noise, or whether they are instead evidence of a violation of classical general relativity.

<doc id="4651" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4651" title="Beta decay">
Beta decay

In <a href="nuclear%20physics">nuclear physics</a>, beta decay ("β"-decay) is a type of <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive decay</a> in which a <a href="beta%20particle">beta ray</a> (fast energetic <a href="electron">electron</a> or <a href="positron">positron</a>) and a <a href="neutrino">neutrino</a> are emitted from an <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a>. For example, beta decay of a <a href="neutron">neutron</a> transforms it into a <a href="proton">proton</a> by the emission of an electron, or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron (<a href="positron%20emission">positron emission</a>), thus changing the <a href="nuclide">nuclide</a> type. Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay, but are created in the decay process. By this process, unstable atoms obtain a more stable <a href="proton%E2%80%93neutron%20ratio">ratio of protons to neutrons</a>. The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its <a href="nuclear%20binding%20energy">nuclear binding energy</a>. The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear <a href="valley%20of%20stability">valley of stability</a>. For either electron or positron emission to be energetically possible, the energy release (<a href="%23Energy%20release">see below</a>) or Q value must be positive.

Beta decay is a consequence of the <a href="Weak%20interaction">weak force</a>, which is characterized by relatively lengthy decay times. Nucleons are composed of up or down <a href="quark">quark</a>s, and the weak force allows a quark to change type by the exchange of a <a href="W%20and%20Z%20bosons">W boson</a> and the creation of an electron/antineutrino or positron/neutrino pair. For example, a neutron, composed of two down quarks and an up quark, decays to a proton composed of a down quark and two up quarks. Decay times for many nuclides that are subject to beta decay can be thousands of years.

<a href="Electron%20capture">Electron capture</a> is sometimes included as a type of beta decay, because the basic nuclear process, mediated by the <a href="weak%20force">weak force</a>, is the same. In electron capture, an inner atomic electron is captured by a proton in the nucleus, transforming it into a neutron, and an electron neutrino is released.

The two types of beta decay are known as "beta minus" and "beta plus". In beta minus (β) decay, a neutron is converted to a proton and the process creates an <a href="electron">electron</a> and an <a href="electron%20antineutrino">electron antineutrino</a>; while in beta plus (β) decay, a proton is converted to a neutron and the process creates a <a href="positron">positron</a> and an <a href="electron%20neutrino">electron neutrino</a>. β decay is also known as <a href="positron%20emission">positron emission</a>.

Beta decay conserves a quantum number known as the <a href="lepton%20number">lepton number</a>, or the number of electrons and their associated neutrinos (other leptons are the <a href="muon">muon</a> and <a href="Tau%20%28particle%29">tau</a> particles). These particles have lepton number +1, while their antiparticles have lepton number −1. Since a proton or neutron has lepton number zero, β decay (a positron, or antielectron) must be accompanied with an electron neutrino, while β decay (an electron) must be accompanied by an electron antineutrino.

An example of electron emission (β decay) is the decay of <a href="carbon-14">carbon-14</a> into <a href="nitrogen-14">nitrogen-14</a> with a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of about 5,730 years:
In this form of decay, the original element becomes a new chemical element in a process known as <a href="nuclear%20transmutation">nuclear transmutation</a>. This new element has an unchanged <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a> , but an <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> that is increased by one. As in all nuclear decays, the decaying element (in this case ) is known as the "parent nuclide" while the resulting element (in this case ) is known as the "daughter nuclide".

An example of positron emission is the decay of <a href="magnesium-23">magnesium-23</a> into <a href="sodium-23">sodium-23</a> with a half-life of about 11.3 s:
β decay also results in nuclear transmutation, with the resulting element having an atomic number that is decreased by one.
The beta spectrum, or distribution of energy values for the beta particles, is continuous. The total energy of the decay process is divided between the electron, the antineutrino, and the recoiling nuclide. In the figure to the right, an example of an electron with 0.40 MeV energy from the beta decay of Bi is shown. In this example, the total decay energy is 1.16 MeV, so the antineutrino has the remaining energy: 1.16-0.40=0.76 MeV. An electron at the far right of the curve would have the maximum possible kinetic energy, leaving the energy of the neutrino to be only its small rest mass.

Radioactivity was discovered in 1896 by <a href="Henri%20Becquerel">Henri Becquerel</a> in <a href="uranium">uranium</a>, and subsequently observed by <a href="Marie%20Curie">Marie</a> and <a href="Pierre%20Curie">Pierre Curie</a> in <a href="thorium">thorium</a> and in the new elements <a href="polonium">polonium</a> and <a href="radium">radium</a>. In 1899, <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> separated radioactive emissions into two types: alpha and beta (now beta minus), based on penetration of objects and ability to cause ionization. Alpha rays could be stopped by thin sheets of paper or aluminium, whereas beta rays could penetrate several millimetres of aluminium. In 1900, <a href="Paul%20Villard">Paul Villard</a> identified a still more penetrating type of radiation, which Rutherford identified as a fundamentally new type in 1903 and termed <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s. Alpha, beta, and gamma are the first three letters of the <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek alphabet</a>.

In 1900, Becquerel measured the <a href="mass-to-charge%20ratio">mass-to-charge ratio</a> () for beta particles by the method of <a href="J.J.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BThomson">J.J. Thomson</a> used to study cathode rays and identify the electron. He found that for a beta particle is the same as for Thomson's electron, and therefore suggested that the beta particle is in fact an electron.

In 1901, Rutherford and <a href="Frederick%20Soddy">Frederick Soddy</a> showed that alpha and beta radioactivity involves the <a href="Nuclear%20transmutation">transmutation</a> of atoms into atoms of other chemical elements. In 1913, after the products of more radioactive decays were known, Soddy and <a href="Kazimierz%20Fajans">Kazimierz Fajans</a> independently proposed their <a href="Radioactive%20displacement%20law%20of%20Fajans%20and%20Soddy">radioactive displacement law</a>, which states that beta (i.e., ) emission from one element produces another element one place to the right in the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>, while alpha emission produces an element two places to the left.

The study of beta decay provided the first physical evidence for the existence of the <a href="neutrino">neutrino</a>. In both alpha and gamma decay, the resulting particle has a narrow energy <a href="Frequency%20distribution">distribution</a>, since the particle carries the energy from the difference between the initial and final nuclear states. However, the kinetic energy distribution, or spectrum, of beta particles measured by <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a> and <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> in 1911 and by <a href="Jean%20Danysz">Jean Danysz</a> in 1913 showed multiple lines on a diffuse background. These measurements offered the first hint that beta particles have a continuous spectrum. In 1914, <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a> used a magnetic <a href="spectrometer">spectrometer</a> with one of <a href="Hans%20Geiger">Hans Geiger's</a> new <a href="Geiger%20counter">counters</a> to make more accurate measurements which showed that the spectrum was continuous. The distribution of beta particle energies was in apparent contradiction to the <a href="law%20of%20conservation%20of%20energy">law of conservation of energy</a>. If beta decay were simply electron emission as assumed at the time, then the energy of the emitted electron should have a particular, well-defined value. For beta decay, however, the observed broad distribution of energies suggested that energy is lost in the beta decay process. This spectrum was puzzling for many years.

A second problem is related to the <a href="conservation%20of%20angular%20momentum">conservation of angular momentum</a>. Molecular band spectra showed that the <a href="nuclear%20spin">nuclear spin</a> of <a href="nitrogen-14">nitrogen-14</a> is 1 (i.e. equal to the <a href="reduced%20Planck%20constant">reduced Planck constant</a>) and more generally that the spin is integral for nuclei of even <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a> and half-integral for nuclei of odd mass number. This was later explained by the <a href="Discovery%20of%20the%20neutron%23Proton-neutron%20model%20of%20the%20nucleus">proton-neutron model of the nucleus</a>. Beta decay leaves the mass number unchanged, so the change of nuclear spin must be an integer. However, the electron spin is 1/2, hence angular momentum would not be conserved if beta decay were simply electron emission.

From 1920–1927, <a href="Charles%20Drummond%20Ellis">Charles Drummond Ellis</a> (along with Chadwick and colleagues) further established that the beta decay spectrum is continuous. In 1933, Ellis and <a href="Nevill%20Mott">Nevill Mott</a> obtained strong evidence that the beta spectrum has an effective upper bound in energy. <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> had suggested that the beta spectrum could be explained if <a href="conservation%20of%20energy">conservation of energy</a> was true only in a statistical sense, thus this <a href="Laws%20of%20science">principle</a> might be violated in any given decay. However, the upper bound in beta energies determined by Ellis and Mott ruled out that notion. Now, the problem of how to account for the variability of energy in known beta decay products, as well as for conservation of momentum and angular momentum in the process, became acute.

In a <a href="Electron%20neutrino%23Pauli%27s%20letter">famous letter</a> written in 1930, <a href="Wolfgang%20Pauli">Wolfgang Pauli</a> attempted to resolve the beta-particle energy conundrum by suggesting that, in addition to electrons and protons, atomic nuclei also contained an extremely light neutral particle, which he called the neutron. He suggested that this "neutron" was also emitted during beta decay (thus accounting for the known missing energy, momentum, and angular momentum), but it had simply not yet been observed. In 1931, <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> renamed Pauli's "neutron" to neutrino. In 1934, Fermi published his landmark <a href="Fermi%27s%20interaction">theory for beta decay</a>, where he applied the principles of quantum mechanics to matter particles, supposing that they can be created and annihilated, just as the light quanta in atomic transitions. Thus, according to Fermi, neutrinos are created in the beta-decay process, rather than contained in the nucleus; the same happens to electrons. The neutrino interaction with matter was so weak that detecting it proved a severe experimental challenge. Further indirect evidence of the existence of the neutrino was obtained by observing the recoil of nuclei that emitted such a particle after absorbing an electron. Neutrinos were finally detected directly in 1956 by <a href="Clyde%20Cowan">Clyde Cowan</a> and <a href="Frederick%20Reines">Frederick Reines</a> in the <a href="Cowan%E2%80%93Reines%20neutrino%20experiment">Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment</a>. The properties of neutrinos were (with a few minor modifications) as predicted by Pauli and Fermi.

In 1934, <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Joliot-Curie">Frédéric</a> and <a href="Ir%C3%A8ne%20Joliot-Curie">Irène Joliot-Curie</a> bombarded aluminium with alpha particles to effect the nuclear reaction  +  →  + , and observed that the product isotope emits a positron identical to those found in cosmic rays (discovered by <a href="Carl%20David%20Anderson">Carl David Anderson</a> in 1932). This was the first example of  decay (<a href="positron%20emission">positron emission</a>), which they termed artificial radioactivity since is a short-lived nuclide which does not exist in nature.

The theory of <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a> was first discussed by <a href="Gian-Carlo%20Wick">Gian-Carlo Wick</a> in a 1934 paper, and then developed by <a href="Hideki%20Yukawa">Hideki Yukawa</a> and others. K-electron capture was first observed in 1937 by <a href="Luis%20Walter%20Alvarez">Luis Alvarez</a>, in the nuclide V. Alvarez went on to study electron capture in Ga and other nuclides.

In 1956, <a href="Tsung-Dao%20Lee">Tsung-Dao Lee</a> and <a href="Chen%20Ning%20Yang">Chen Ning Yang</a> noticed that there was no evidence that <a href="parity%20%28physics%29">parity</a> was conserved in weak interactions, and so they postulated that this symmetry may not be preserved by the weak force. They sketched the design for an experiment for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory. Later that year, <a href="Chien-Shiung%20Wu">Chien-Shiung Wu</a> and coworkers conducted the <a href="Wu%20experiment">Wu experiment</a> showing an asymmetrical beta decay of <a href="cobalt-60">cobalt-60</a> at cold temperatures that proved that parity is not conserved in beta decay. This surprising result overturned long-held assumptions about parity and the weak force. In recognition of their theoretical work, Lee and Yang were awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20for%20Physics">Nobel Prize for Physics</a> in 1957.

In  decay, the <a href="weak%20interaction">weak interaction</a> converts an <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a> into a nucleus with <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> increased by one, while emitting an electron () and an electron antineutrino ().  decay generally occurs in neutron-rich nuclei. The generic equation is:
where and are the <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a> and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> of the decaying nucleus, and X and X' are the initial and final elements, respectively.

Another example is when the <a href="free%20neutron">free neutron</a> () decays by  decay into a proton ():

At the <a href="fundamental%20particle">fundamental</a> level (as depicted in the <a href="Feynman%20diagram">Feynman diagram</a> on the right), this is caused by the conversion of the negatively charged (− <a href="elementary%20charge">e</a>) <a href="down%20quark">down quark</a> to the positively charged (+ e) <a href="up%20quark">up quark</a> by emission of a <a href="W%20boson">boson</a>; the boson subsequently decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino:

In  decay, or "positron emission", the weak interaction converts an atomic nucleus into a nucleus with atomic number decreased by one, while emitting a positron () and an <a href="electron%20neutrino">electron neutrino</a> ().  decay generally occurs in proton-rich nuclei. The generic equation is:
This may be considered as the decay of a proton inside the nucleus to a neutron

However,  decay cannot occur in an isolated proton because it requires energy due to the <a href="mass">mass</a> of the neutron being greater than the mass of the proton.  decay can only happen inside nuclei when the daughter nucleus has a greater <a href="nuclear%20binding%20energy">binding energy</a> (and therefore a lower total energy) than the mother nucleus. The difference between these energies goes into the reaction of converting a proton into a neutron, a positron and a neutrino and into the kinetic energy of these particles. This process is opposite to negative beta decay, in that the weak interaction converts a proton into a neutron by converting an up quark into a down quark resulting in the emission of a or the absorption of a .

In all cases where  decay (positron emission) of a nucleus is allowed energetically, so too is <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a> allowed. This is a process during which a nucleus captures one of its atomic electrons, resulting in the emission of a neutrino:

An example of electron capture is one of the decay modes of <a href="krypton-81">krypton-81</a> into <a href="bromine-81">bromine-81</a>:

All emitted neutrinos are of the same energy. In proton-rich nuclei where the energy difference between the initial and final states is less than ,  decay is not energetically possible, and electron capture is the sole decay mode.

If the captured electron comes from the innermost shell of the atom, the <a href="Electron%20shell">K-shell</a>, which has the highest probability to interact with the nucleus, the process is called K-capture. If it comes from the L-shell, the process is called L-capture, etc.

Electron capture is a competing (simultaneous) decay process for all nuclei that can undergo β decay. The converse, however, is not true: electron capture is the "only" type of decay that is allowed in proton-rich nuclides that do not have sufficient energy to emit a positron and neutrino.

If the proton and neutron are part of an <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a>, the above described decay processes <a href="Nuclear%20transmutation">transmute</a> one chemical element into another. For example:

Beta decay does not change the number () of <a href="nucleon">nucleon</a>s in the nucleus, but changes only its <a href="electric%20charge">charge</a> . Thus the set of all <a href="nuclide">nuclide</a>s with the same  can be introduced; these <a href="isobar%20%28nuclide%29">"isobaric" nuclides</a> may turn into each other via beta decay. For a given there is one that is most stable. It is said to be beta stable, because it presents a local minima of the <a href="mass%20excess">mass excess</a>: if such a nucleus has numbers, the neighbour nuclei and have higher mass excess and can beta decay into , but not vice versa. For all odd mass numbers , there is only one known beta-stable isobar. For even , there are up to three different beta-stable isobars experimentally known; for example, , , and are all beta-stable. There are about 355 known <a href="beta-decay%20stable%20isobars">beta-decay stable nuclides</a>.

Usually, unstable nuclides are clearly either "neutron rich" or "proton rich", with the former undergoing beta decay and the latter undergoing electron capture (or more rarely, due to the higher energy requirements, positron decay). However, in a few cases of odd-proton, odd-neutron radionuclides, it may be energetically favorable for the radionuclide to decay to an even-proton, even-neutron isobar either by undergoing beta-positive or beta-negative decay. An often-cited example is the single isotope (29 protons, 35 neutrons), which illustrates three types of beta decay in competition. Copper-64 has a half-life of about 12.7 hours. This isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron, so either the proton or the neutron can decay. This particular nuclide (though not all nuclides in this situation) is almost equally likely to decay through proton decay by <a href="positron%20emission">positron emission</a> (18%) or <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a> (43%) to , as it is through neutron decay by electron emission (39%) to .

Most naturally occurring nuclides on earth are beta stable. Those that are not have <a href="half-life">half-lives</a> ranging from under a second to periods of time significantly greater than the <a href="age%20of%20the%20universe">age of the universe</a>. One common example of a long-lived isotope is the odd-proton odd-neutron nuclide , which undergoes all three types of beta decay (, and electron capture) with a half-life of .

where

Beta decay just changes <a href="neutron">neutron</a> to <a href="proton">proton</a> or, in the case of positive beta decay (<a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a>) <a href="proton">proton</a> to <a href="neutron">neutron</a> so the number of individual <a href="quarks">quarks</a> don't change. It is only the baryon flavor that changes, here labelled as the <a href="isospin">isospin</a>.

Up and down <a href="quarks">quarks</a> have total isospin formula_4 and isospin projections

All other quarks have "I" = 0.

In general

so all leptons have assigned a value of +1, antileptons −1, and non-leptonic particles 0. 

For allowed decays, the net orbital angular momentum is zero, hence only spin quantum numbers are considered.

The electron and antineutrino are <a href="fermions">fermions</a>, spin-1/2 objects, therefore they may couple to total formula_9 (parallel) or formula_10 (anti-parallel).

For forbidden decays, orbital angular momentum must also be taken into consideration.

The <a href="Q%20value%20%28nuclear%20science%29">value</a> is defined as the total energy released in a given nuclear decay. In beta decay, is therefore also the sum of the kinetic energies of the emitted beta particle, neutrino, and recoiling nucleus. (Because of the large mass of the nucleus compared to that of the beta particle and neutrino, the kinetic energy of the recoiling nucleus can generally be neglected.) Beta particles can therefore be emitted with any <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a> ranging from 0 to . A typical is around 1 <a href="MeV">MeV</a>, but can range from a few <a href="keV">keV</a> to a few tens of MeV.

Since the <a href="Mass%E2%80%93energy%20equivalence">rest mass</a> of the electron is 511 keV, the most energetic beta particles are <a href="Ultrarelativistic%20limit">ultrarelativistic</a>, with speeds very close to the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a>.

Consider the generic equation for beta decay
The value for this decay is
where formula_12 is the mass of the nucleus of the atom, formula_13 is the mass of the electron, and formula_14 is the mass of the electron antineutrino. In other words, the total energy released is the mass energy of the initial nucleus, minus the mass energy of the final nucleus, electron, and antineutrino. The mass of the nucleus is related to the standard <a href="atomic%20mass">atomic mass</a> by
That is, the total atomic mass is the mass of the nucleus, plus the mass of the electrons, minus the sum of all "electron" binding energies for the atom. This equation is rearranged to find formula_12, and formula_17 is found similarly. Substituting these nuclear masses into the Q-value equation, while neglecting the nearly-zero antineutrino mass and the difference in electron binding energies, which is very small for high- atoms, we have
This energy is carried away as kinetic energy by the electron and neutrino.

Because the reaction will proceed only when the -value is positive, β decay can occur when the mass of atom is greater than the mass of atom .

The equations for β decay are similar, with the generic equation
giving
However, in this equation, the electron masses do not cancel, and we are left with

Because the reaction will proceed only when the -value is positive, β decay can occur when the mass of atom exceeds that of by at least twice the mass of the electron.

The analogous calculation for electron capture must take into account the binding energy of the electrons. This is because the atom will be left in an excited state after capturing the electron, and the binding energy of the captured innermost electron is significant. Using the generic equation for electron capture
we have
which simplifies to
where is the binding energy of the captured electron.

Because the binding energy of the electron is much less than the mass of the electron, nuclei that can undergo β decay can always also undergo electron capture, but the reverse is not true.

Beta decay can be considered as a <a href="Perturbation%20theory%20%28quantum%20mechanics%29">perturbation</a> as described in quantum mechanics, and thus <a href="Fermi%27s%20Golden%20Rule">Fermi's Golden Rule</a> can be applied. This leads to an expression for the kinetic energy spectrum of emitted betas as follows:

where is the kinetic energy, is a shape function that depends on the forbiddenness of the decay (it is constant for allowed decays), is the Fermi Function (see below) with "Z" the charge of the final-state nucleus, is the total energy, is the momentum, and is the <a href="Q%20value%20%28nuclear%20science%29">Q value</a> of the decay. The kinetic energy of the emitted neutrino is given approximately by minus the kinetic energy of the beta.

As an example, the beta decay spectrum of Bi (originally called RaE) is shown to the right.

The Fermi function that appears in the beta spectrum formula accounts for the Coulomb attraction / repulsion between the emitted beta and the final state nucleus. Approximating the associated wavefunctions to be spherically symmetric, the Fermi function can be analytically calculated to be:

where (α is the <a href="fine-structure%20constant">fine-structure constant</a>), (+ for electrons, − for positrons), ( is the radius of the final state nucleus), and Γ is the <a href="Gamma%20function">Gamma function</a>.

For non-relativistic betas (), this expression can be approximated by:

Other approximations can be found in the literature.

A Kurie plot (also known as a Fermi–Kurie plot) is a graph used in studying beta decay developed by <a href="Franz%20N.%20D.%20Kurie">Franz N. D. Kurie</a>, in which the square root of the number of beta particles whose momenta (or energy) lie within a certain narrow range, divided by the Fermi function, is plotted against beta-particle energy. It is a straight line for allowed transitions and some forbidden transitions, in accord with the Fermi beta-decay theory. The energy-axis (x-axis) intercept of a Kurie plot corresponds to the maximum energy imparted to the electron/positron (the decay's -value). With a Kurie plot one can find the limit on the effective mass of a neutrino.

After the discovery of parity non-conservation (see <a href="Beta%20decay%23Non-conservation%20of%20parity">History</a>), it was found that, in beta decay, electrons are emitted mostly with negative <a href="Chirality%20%28physics%29">helicity</a>, i.e., they move, naively speaking, like left-handed screws driven into a material (they have negative longitudinal <a href="Spin%20polarization">polarization</a>). Conversely, positrons have mostly positive helicity, i.e., they move like right-handed screws. Neutrinos (emitted in positron decay) have positive helicity, while antineutrinos (emitted in electron decay) have negative helicity.

The higher the energy of the particles, the higher their polarization.

Beta decays can be classified according to the angular momentum (<a href="Angular%20momentum%20operator">-value</a>) and total spin (<a href="Spin%20%28physics%29">-value</a>) of the emitted radiation. Since total angular momentum must be conserved, including orbital and spin angular momentum, beta decay occurs by a variety of quantum state transitions to various nuclear angular momentum or spin states, known as "Fermi" or "Gamow-Teller" transitions. When beta decay particles carry no angular momentum (L=0), the decay is referred to as "allowed", otherwise it is "forbidden".

Other decay modes, which are rare, are known as bound state decay and double beta decay.

A Fermi transition is a beta decay in which the spins of the emitted electron (positron) and anti-neutrino (neutrino) couple to total spin formula_10, leading to an angular momentum change formula_27 between the initial and final states of the nucleus (assuming an allowed transition). In the non-relativistic limit, the nuclear part of the operator for a Fermi transition is given by

with formula_29 the weak vector coupling constant, formula_30 the <a href="isospin">isospin</a> <a href="Ladder%20operator">raising and lowering operators</a>, and formula_31 running over all protons and neutrons in the nucleus.

A Gamow-Teller transition is a beta decay in which the spins of the emitted electron (positron) and anti-neutrino (neutrino) couple to total spin formula_9, leading to an angular momentum change formula_33 between the initial and final states of the nucleus (assuming an allowed transition).
In this case, the nuclear part of the operator is given by

with formula_35 the weak axial-vector coupling constant, and formula_36 the <a href="Pauli%20matrices">spin Pauli matrices</a>, which can produce a spin-flip in the decaying nucleon.

When , the decay is referred to as <a href="forbidden%20transition">"forbidden"</a>. Nuclear <a href="selection%20rule">selection rule</a>s require high L-values to be accompanied by changes in <a href="nuclear%20spin">nuclear spin</a> () and <a href="Parity%20%28physics%29">parity</a> (π). The selection rules for the th forbidden transitions are:

where or corresponds to no parity change or parity change, respectively. The special case of a transition between isobaric analogue states, where the structure of the final state is very similar to the structure of the initial state, is referred to as "superallowed" for beta decay, and proceeds very quickly. The following table lists the Δ and Δπ values for the first few values of :

A very small minority of free neutron decays (about four per million) are so-called "two-body decays", in which the proton, electron and antineutrino are produced, but the electron fails to gain the 13.6 eV energy necessary to escape the proton, and therefore simply remains bound to it, as a neutral <a href="hydrogen%20atom">hydrogen atom</a>. In this type of beta decay, in essence all of the neutron <a href="decay%20energy">decay energy</a> is carried off by the antineutrino.

For fully ionized atoms (bare nuclei), it is possible in likewise manner for electrons to fail to escape the atom, and to be emitted from the nucleus into low-lying atomic bound states (orbitals). This cannot occur for neutral atoms with low-lying bound states which are already filled by electrons.

The phenomenon in fully ionized atoms was first observed for Dy in 1992 by Jung et al. of the Darmstadt Heavy-Ion Research group. Although neutral Dy is a stable isotope, the fully ionized Dy undergoes β decay into the K and L shells with a half-life of 47 days.

Another possibility is that a fully ionized atom undergoes greatly accelerated β decay, as observed for Re by Bosch et al., also at Darmstadt. Neutral Re does undergo β decay with a half-life of 42 × 10 years, but for fully ionized Re this is shortened by a factor of 10 to only 32.9 years. For comparison the variation of decay rates of other nuclear processes due to chemical environment is <a href="radioactive%20decay%23Changing%20decay%20rates">less than 1%</a>.

Some nuclei can undergo double beta decay (ββ decay) where the charge of the nucleus changes by two units. Double beta decay is difficult to study, as the process has an extremely long half-life. In nuclei for which both β decay and ββ decay are possible, the rarer ββ decay process is effectively impossible to observe. However, in nuclei where β decay is forbidden but ββ decay is allowed, the process can be seen and a half-life measured. Thus, ββ decay is usually studied only for beta stable nuclei. Like single beta decay, double beta decay does not change ; thus, at least one of the nuclides with some given has to be stable with regard to both single and double beta decay.

"Ordinary" double beta decay results in the emission of two electrons and two antineutrinos. If neutrinos are <a href="Majorana%20particle">Majorana particle</a>s (i.e., they are their own antiparticles), then a decay known as <a href="neutrinoless%20double%20beta%20decay">neutrinoless double beta decay</a> will occur. Most neutrino physicists believe that neutrinoless double beta decay has never been observed.

Blitzkrieg

Blitzkrieg (<a href="German%20language">German</a>, "lightning war") is a method of warfare whereby an attacking force, spearheaded by a <a href="force%20concentration">dense concentration</a> of <a href="armoured%20warfare">armoured</a> and <a href="motorized%20infantry">motorised</a> or <a href="mechanised%20infantry">mechanised infantry</a> formations with <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a>, breaks through the opponent's line of defence by <a href="Offensive%20%28military%29">short, fast, powerful attacks</a> and then dislocates the defenders, using speed and surprise to encircle them. Through the employment of <a href="combined%20arms">combined arms</a> in <a href="manoeuvre%20warfare">manoeuvre warfare</a>, blitzkrieg attempts to unbalance the enemy by making it difficult for it to respond to the continuously changing front, then defeat it in a decisive (<a href="battle%20of%20annihilation">battle of annihilation</a>).

During the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>, aircraft and tank technologies matured and were combined with systematic application of the traditional German tactic of (<a href="maneuver%20warfare">maneuver warfare</a>), deep penetrations and the bypassing of enemy strong points to <a href="Encirclement">encircle and destroy</a> enemy forces in a (cauldron battle). During the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland%20%281939%29">Invasion of Poland</a>, Western journalists adopted the term "blitzkrieg" to describe this form of armoured warfare. The term had appeared in 1935, in a German military periodical (German Defense), in connection to quick or lightning warfare. German manoeuvre operations were successful in the campaigns of 1939–1941 and by 1940 the term "blitzkrieg" was extensively used in Western media. Blitzkrieg operations capitalized on surprise penetrations (e.g., the penetration of the <a href="Ardennes">Ardennes</a> forest region), general enemy unreadiness and their inability to match the pace of the German attack. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">Battle of France</a>, the French made attempts to re-form defensive lines along rivers but were frustrated when German forces arrived first and pressed on.

Despite being common in German and English-language journalism during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the word was never used by the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> as an official military term, except for propaganda. Some senior officers, including <a href="Kurt%20Student">Kurt Student</a>, <a href="Franz%20Halder">Franz Halder</a> and <a href="Johann%20Adolf%20von%20Kielmansegg">Johann Adolf von Kielmansegg</a>, even disputed the idea that it was a military concept. Kielmansegg asserted that what many regarded as blitzkrieg was nothing more than "ad hoc solutions that simply popped out of the prevailing situation". Student described it as ideas that "naturally emerged from the existing circumstances" as a response to operational challenges. The Wehrmacht never officially adopted it as a concept or doctrine. In 2005, the historian <a href="Karl-Heinz%20Frieser">Karl-Heinz Frieser</a> summarized blitzkrieg as the result of German commanders using the latest technology in the most beneficial way according to traditional military principles and employing "the right units in the right place at the right time". Modern historians now understand blitzkrieg as the combination of the traditional German military principles, methods and doctrines of the 19th century, with the military technology of the interwar period. Modern historians use the term casually as a generic description for the style of manoeuvre warfare practised by Germany during the early part of World War II, rather than as an explanation. According to Frieser, in the context of the thinking of <a href="Heinz%20Guderian">Heinz Guderian</a> on mobile combined arms formations, blitzkrieg can be used as a synonym for modern manoeuvre warfare on the operational level.

The traditional meaning of blitzkrieg is that of German <a href="Military%20tactics">tactical</a> and <a href="Military%20operation">operational</a> methodology in the first half of the Second World War, that is often hailed as a new method of warfare. The word, meaning "lightning war", in its strategic sense describes a series of quick and decisive short battles to deliver a knockout blow to an enemy state before it could fully mobilize. Tactically, blitzkrieg is a coordinated military effort by tanks, motorized infantry, artillery and aircraft, to create an overwhelming local superiority in combat power, to defeat the opponent and break through its defences. "Blitzkrieg" as used by Germany had considerable psychological, or "terror" elements, such as the "Jericho Trompete", a noise-making siren on the <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087">Junkers Ju 87</a> dive-bomber, to affect the morale of enemy forces. The devices were largely removed when the enemy became used to the noise after the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">Battle of France</a> in 1940 and instead bombs sometimes had whistles attached. It is also common for historians and writers to include psychological warfare by using <a href="Fifth%20columnists">Fifth columnists</a> to spread rumours and lies among the civilian population in the theatre of operations.

The origin of the term "blitzkrieg" is obscure. It was never used in the title of a military doctrine or handbook of the German army or air force, and no "coherent doctrine" or "unifying concept of blitzkrieg" existed. The term seems rarely to have been used in the German military press before 1939 and recent research at the German "<a href="Military%20History%20Research%20Office%20%28Germany%29">Militärgeschichtliches Forschungsamt</a>" at <a href="Potsdam">Potsdam</a> found it in only two military articles from the 1930s. Both used the term to mean a swift strategic knock-out, rather than a radical new military doctrine or approach to war. The first article (1935) deals primarily with supplies of food and <a href="materiel">materiel</a> in wartime. The term "blitzkrieg" is used with reference to German efforts to win a quick victory in the First World War but is not associated with the use of armoured, mechanised or air forces. It argued that Germany must develop self-sufficiency in food, because it might again prove impossible to deal a swift knock-out to its enemies, leading to a long war. In the second article (1938), launching a swift strategic knock-out is described as an attractive idea for Germany but difficult to achieve on land under modern conditions (especially against systems of <a href="fortification">fortification</a> like the <a href="Maginot%20Line">Maginot Line</a>), unless an exceptionally high degree of surprise could be achieved. The author vaguely suggests that a massive strategic air attack might hold out better prospects but the topic is not explored in detail. A third relatively early use of the term in German occurs in "Die Deutsche Kriegsstärke" (German War Strength) by Fritz Sternberg, a Jewish, <a href="Marxist">Marxist</a>, political economist and refugee from the Third Reich, published in 1938 in Paris and in London as "Germany and a Lightning War". Sternberg wrote that Germany was not prepared economically for a long war but might win a quick war (""Blitzkrieg"") . He did not go into detail about tactics or suggest that the German armed forces had evolved a radically new operational method. His book offers scant clues as to how German lightning victories might be won.

In English and other languages, the term had been used since the 1920s. The British press used it to describe the German successes in Poland in September 1939, called by Harris "a piece of journalistic sensationalism – a buzz-word with which to label the spectacular early successes of the Germans in the Second World War". It was later applied to the bombing of Britain, particularly London, hence "<a href="The%20Blitz">The Blitz</a>" . The German popular press followed suit nine months later, after the fall of France in 1940; hence although the word had been used in German, it was first popularized by British journalism. <a href="Heinz%20Guderian">Heinz Guderian</a> referred to it as a word coined by the Allies: "as a result of the successes of our rapid campaigns our enemies ... coined the word "Blitzkrieg"". After the German failure in the Soviet Union in 1941, use of the term began to be frowned upon in the Third Reich, and Hitler then denied ever using the term, saying in a speech in November 1941, "I have never used the word "Blitzkrieg", because it is a very silly word". In early January 1942, Hitler dismissed it as "Italian phraseology".

In 1914, German strategic thinking derived from the writings of <a href="Carl%20von%20Clausewitz">Carl von Clausewitz</a> (June 1, 1780 – November 16, 1831), <a href="Helmuth%20von%20Moltke%20the%20Elder">Helmuth von Moltke the Elder</a> (26 October 1800 – 24 April 1891) and <a href="Alfred%20von%20Schlieffen">Alfred von Schlieffen</a> (28 February 1833 – 4 January 1913), who advocated manoeuvre, mass and envelopment to create the conditions for a decisive battle . During the war, generals such as <a href="Oskar%20von%20Hutier">Oskar von Hutier</a> developed tactics to restore manoeuvre on the battlefield. Specialist <a href="light%20infantry">light infantry</a> ("<a href="Stormtrooper">Sturmtruppen</a>" storm troops) were to exploit soft spots, to make gaps for larger infantry units to advance with heavier weapons and exploit the success, leaving isolated strong points to troops following up. Hutier tactics were combined with short hurricane artillery bombardments using massed artillery, devised by Colonel <a href="Georg%20Bruchm%C3%BCller">Georg Bruchmüller</a>. Attacks were to rely on speed and surprise rather than on weight of numbers. Hutier-Bruchmüller tactics met with great success in <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Operation Michael</a>, the spring offensive of 1918 and restored temporarily the war of movement, once the Allied trench system had been overrun. The German armies pushed on towards Amiens and then Paris, coming within before supply difficulties and Allied reinforcements halted the advance.

On the Eastern Front, the war did not bog down into <a href="trench%20warfare">trench warfare</a>; German and Russian armies fought a war of manoeuvre over thousands of miles, which gave the German leadership unique experience which the trench-bound western Allies did not experience. Studies of operations in the east led to the conclusion that small and coordinated forces possessed more combat power than large, uncoordinated forces. After the war, the "Reichswehr" modified Hutier tactics. The commander in chief, <a href="Hans%20von%20Seeckt">Hans von Seeckt</a>, argued that there had been an excessive focus on encirclement and emphasized speed instead. Seeckt inspired a revision of "<a href="Bewegungskrieg">Bewegungskrieg</a>" (maneuver warfare) thinking and its associated "<a href="Auftragstaktik">Auftragstaktik</a>", in which the commander gave his intent and subordinates the discretion to achieve it, within limits determined by the training of an elite officer-corps, which made their decisions predictable to other commanders. Delegation increased the tempo of operations, which had great influence on the success of German armies in the early war period. Seeckt rejected the idea of numerical superiority and developed the German army into a small, mobile force and encouraged technical advances, of which one of the results was enhancing the radio use, which allowed better coordination between motorized infantry, tanks and planes and thus provided the necessary conditions for the subsequent Blitzkrieg. He thus transformed it into an army of commanders, who could cover at least the next level of command.
German operational theories were revised after the First World War. The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> limited the <a href="Reichswehr">Reichswehr</a> to a maximum of 100,000 men, making impossible the deployment of mass armies. The <a href="German%20General%20Staff">German General Staff</a> was abolished by the treaty but continued covertly as the "<a href="Truppenamt">Truppenamt</a>" (Troop Office), disguised as an administrative body. Committees of veteran staff officers were formed within the "Truppenamt" to evaluate 57 issues of the war. By the time of the Second World War, their reports had led to doctrinal and training publications, including H. Dv. 487, "Führung und Gefecht der verbundenen Waffen" (Command and Battle of the Combined Arms), known as das Fug (1921–23) and "<a href="Truppenf%C3%BChrung">Truppenführung</a>" (1933–34), containing standard procedures for combined-arms warfare. The "Reichswehr" was influenced by its analysis of pre-war German military thought, in particular infiltration tactics, which at the end of the war had seen some breakthroughs on the Western Front and the manoeuvre warfare which dominated the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Eastern Front</a>.

The British army took lessons from the successful infantry and artillery offensives on the Western Front in late 1918. To obtain the best co-operation between all arms, emphasis was placed on detailed planning, rigid control and adherence to orders. Mechanization of the army was considered a means to avoid mass casualties and indecisive nature of offensives, as part of a combined-arms theory of war. The four editions of "Field Service Regulations" published after 1918 held that only combined-arms operations could create enough fire power to enable mobility on a battlefield. This theory of war also emphasized consolidation, recommending caution against overconfidence and ruthless exploitation.

In the <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Sinai and Palestine Campaign</a>, operations involved some aspects of what would later be called "blitzkrieg". Key elements in the "blitzkrieg warfare" at the decisive <a href="Battle%20of%20Megiddo%20%281918%29">Battle of Megiddo</a> included concentration, surprise and speed; success depended on attacking only in terrain favoring the movement of large formations around the battlefield and tactical improvements in the British artillery and infantry attack. General <a href="Edmund%20Allenby">Edmund Allenby</a> used infantry to attack the strong <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> front line in co-operation with supporting artillery, augmented by the guns of two destroyers. Through constant pressure by infantry and cavalry, two Ottoman armies in the Judean Hills were kept off-balance and virtually encircled during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sharon%20%281918%29">Battles of Sharon</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Nablus%20%281918%29">Nablus</a> (Battle of Megiddo).

The British methods induced "strategic paralysis" among the Ottomans and led to their rapid and complete collapse. In an advance of , captures were estimated at "at least prisoners and 260 guns." Liddell Hart considered that important aspects of the operation were the extent to which Ottoman commanders were denied intelligence on the British preparations for the attack through British air superiority and air attacks on their headquarters and telephone exchanges, which paralyzed attempts to react to the rapidly deteriorating situation.

French doctrine in the interwar years was defence-oriented. Colonel <a href="Charles%20de%20Gaulle">Charles de Gaulle</a> was an advocate of concentration of armour and aeroplanes. His opinions were expressed in his book "Vers l'Armée de Métier" (Towards the Professional Army 1933). Like von Seeckt, he concluded that France could no longer maintain the huge armies of conscripts and reservists with which World War I had been fought, and he sought to use tanks, mechanised forces and aircraft to allow a smaller number of highly trained soldiers to have greater impact in battle. His views little endeared him to the French high command but are claimed by some to have influenced <a href="Heinz%20Guderian">Heinz Guderian</a>.

In 1916, General <a href="Alexei%20Brusilov">Alexei Brusilov</a> had used surprise and infiltration tactics during the <a href="Brusilov%20Offensive">Brusilov Offensive</a>. Later, Marshal <a href="Mikhail%20Tukhachevsky">Mikhail Tukhachevsky</a>, Georgii Isserson and other members of the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> developed a concept of <a href="deep%20battle">deep battle</a> from the experience of the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Soviet%20War">Polish–Soviet War</a>. These concepts would guide Red Army doctrine throughout World War II. Realising the limitations of infantry and cavalry, Tukhachevsky was an advocate of mechanised formations and the large-scale industrialisation required. Robert Watt (2008) wrote that blitzkrieg holds little in common with Soviet deep battle. In 2002, H. P. Willmott had noted that deep battle contained two important differences: it was a doctrine of total war, not limited operations, and decisive battle was rejected in favour of several large, simultaneous offensives.

The "Reichswehr" and the Red Army began a secret collaboration in the Soviet Union to evade the Treaty of Versailles occupational agent, the <a href="Military%20Inter-Allied%20Commission%20of%20Control">Inter-Allied Commission</a>. In 1926, <a href="military%20exercise">War games</a> and tests were begun at <a href="Kazan">Kazan</a> and <a href="Lipetsk">Lipetsk</a>. The centres were used to field test aircraft and armoured vehicles up to the battalion level and housed aerial and armoured warfare schools, through which officers were rotated.

After becoming head of government in 1933, <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> ignored the Versailles Treaty provisions. A command for armored forces was created within the German Wehrmacht: the "<a href="Panzerwaffe">Panzerwaffe</a>", as it came to be known later. The Luftwaffe (the German air force) was established, and development began on ground-attack aircraft and doctrines. Hitler was a strong supporter of this new strategy. He read Guderian's book "<a href="Achtung%20%E2%80%93%20Panzer%21">Achtung – Panzer!</a>" and upon observing armoured field exercises at <a href="Kummersdorf">Kummersdorf</a> he remarked, "That is what I want – and that is what I will have."

Guderian summarised combined-arms tactics as the way to get the mobile and motorised armoured divisions to work together and support each other to achieve decisive success. In his book, "<a href="Panzer%20Leader%20%28book%29">Panzer Leader</a>", he wrote:

Guderian believed that developments in technology were required to support the theory; especially, equipping armoured divisions—tanks
foremost–with wireless communications. Guderian insisted in 1933 to the high command that every tank in the German armoured force must be equipped with a radio. At the start of the war, only the German army was thus prepared with all tanks "radio equipped". This proved critical in early tank battles where German tank commanders exploited the organizational advantage over the Allies that radio communication gave them. Later all Allied armies would copy this innovation. During the Polish campaign, the performance of armoured troops, under the influence of Guderian's ideas, won over a number of skeptics who had initially expressed doubt about armoured warfare, such as von Rundstedt and Rommel.

According to David A.Grossman, by the <a href="Battles%20of%20the%20Isonzo">12th Battle of Isonzo</a>, while conducting a light infantry operation, Rommel had perfected his maneuver 
warfare principles, which were the very same ones that were applied during the Blitzkrieg against France in 1940 (and repeated by the Allied grounded offensive against Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War)
During the Battle of France, Hitler caused a confusion when he suddenly changed his ideas and ordered that everything should be completed in a few weeks (his original plan would have taken years to be completed), encouraging Rommel and Guderian to disobey their direct superiors' orders by forging ahead and, on the way, invented the idea of Blitzkrieg. It was Rommel who created the first archetype of Blitzkrieg, leading his division far ahead of flanking divisions. MacGregor and Williamson remark that Rommel's version of Blitzkrieg displayed a significantly better understanding of combined-arms warfare than that of Guderian. General Hoth submitted an official report which declared that Rommel had "explored new paths in the command of Panzer divisions."

The Germans referred to a "Schwerpunkt" (focal point) and to a "Schwerpunktprinzip" (concentration principle) in the planning of operations, known as "Schwerpunktbildung". The "Schwerpunkt" was the centre of gravity, point of main effort, where a decisive result was to be achieved. Military force was concentrated at the "Schwerpunkt", regardless of the sacrifices it made necessary elsewhere. By local success at the "Schwerpunkt", a small force could achieve a breakthrough and gain advantages by fighting in the enemy rear. Guderian summarised this as "Klotzen, nicht kleckern!" ("Kick, don't spatter them!").

To break through, armoured forces would attack an opposing defensive line frontally, supported by motorised infantry, artillery fire and aerial bombardment, to create a breach. Tanks and other motorised units could break out of the fortified zone without the encumbrance of slow-moving infantry moving on foot. Air forces tried to gain air superiority by attacking opposing aircraft on the ground, bombing airfields and communications and seeking tactically advantageous positions from which to destroy them in the air. "Schwerpunktbildung" enabled the attacker to win numerical superiority at the point of main effort, which in turn gave the attacker tactical and <a href="Operational%20level%20of%20war">operational</a> superiority, even though the attacker may be numerically and <a href="Strategy">strategically</a> inferior in general.

Having achieved a breakthrough of the enemy's line, units comprising the "Schwerpunkt" were not supposed to become decisively engaged with enemy front line units to the right and left of the breakthrough area. Units pouring through the hole were to drive upon set objectives behind the enemy front line. In World War II, German Panzer forces used motorised mobility, to paralyse the opponent's ability to react. Fast-moving mobile forces seized the initiative, exploited weaknesses and acted before opposing forces could respond. Central to this was the <a href="decision%20cycle">decision cycle</a> (tempo). Decision-making required time to gather information, make a decision, give orders to subordinates to implement the decision. Through superior mobility and faster decision-making cycles, mobile forces could act quicker than the forces opposing them. <a href="Mission-type%20tactics">Directive control</a> was a fast and flexible method of command. Rather than receiving an explicit order, a commander would be told of his <a href="Commander%27s%20intent">superior's intent</a> and the role which his unit was to fill in this concept. The method of execution was then a matter for the discretion of the subordinate commander. Staff burden was reduced at the top and spread among tiers of command with knowledge about their situation. Delegation and the encouragement of initiative aided implementation, important decisions could be taken quickly and communicated verbally or with brief written orders. Germans soldiers also used <a href="Methamphetamine%23History%2C%20society%2C%20and%20culture">Pervitin</a>, a form of Amphetamine, which was given to drivers, to keep them awake.

The last part of an offensive operation was the destruction of un-subdued <a href="pocket%20%28military%29">pockets</a> of resistance, which had been <a href="envelop">envelop</a>ed earlier and by-passed by the fast-moving armoured and motorised spearheads. The "Kesselschlacht", (cauldron battle), was a <a href="concentric">concentric</a> attack on such pockets. It was here that most losses were inflicted upon the enemy, primarily through the mass capture of prisoners and weapons. During <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a>, huge encirclements in 1941 produced nearly 3.5 million Soviet prisoners, along with masses of equipment.

<a href="Close%20air%20support">Close air support</a> was provided in the form of the <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a> and <a href="medium%20bomber">medium bomber</a>. They would support the focal point of attack from the air. German successes are closely related to the extent to which the German "Luftwaffe" was able to control the air war in early campaigns in Europe and the Soviet Union. However, the "Luftwaffe" was a broadly based force with no constricting central doctrine, other than its resources should be used generally to support national strategy. It was flexible and it was able to carry out both operational-tactical, and strategic bombing. Flexibility was the "Luftwaffe's" strength in 1939–1941. Paradoxically, from that period onward it became its weakness. While Allied Air Forces were tied to the support of the Army, the "Luftwaffe" deployed its resources in a more general, operational way. It switched from <a href="air%20superiority">air superiority</a> missions, to medium-range interdiction, to strategic strikes, to close support duties depending on the need of the ground forces. In fact, far from it being a specialist panzer spearhead arm, fewer than 15 percent of the Luftwaffe was intended for close support of the army in 1939.

The concepts associated with the term "blitzkrieg"—deep penetrations by armour, large encirclements, and combined arms attacks—were largely dependent upon terrain and weather conditions. Where the ability for rapid movement across "tank country" was not possible, armoured penetrations were often avoided or resulted in failure. Terrain would ideally be flat, firm, unobstructed by natural barriers or fortifications, and interspersed with roads and railways. If it were instead hilly, wooded, marshy, or urban, armour would be vulnerable to infantry in close-quarters combat and unable to break out at full speed. Additionally, units could be halted by mud (<a href="thaw%20%28weather%29">thawing</a> along the Eastern Front regularly slowed both sides) or extreme snow. Armour, motorised and aerial support was also naturally dependent on weather.
It should however be noted that the disadvantages of such terrain could be nullified if surprise was achieved over the enemy by an attack through such terrain. During the Battle of France, the German blitzkrieg-style attack on France went through the Ardennes. There is little doubt that the hilly, heavily wooded Ardennes could have been relatively easily defended by the Allies, even against the bulk of the German armoured units. However, precisely because the French thought the Ardennes unsuitable for massive troop movement, particularly for tanks, they were left with only light defences which were quickly overrun by the "Wehrmacht". The Germans quickly advanced through the forest, knocking down the trees the French thought would impede this tactic.

The influence of air forces over forces on the ground changed significantly over the course of the Second World War. Early German successes were conducted when Allied aircraft could not make a significant impact on the battlefield. In May 1940, there was near parity in numbers of aircraft between the Luftwaffe and the Allies, but the Luftwaffe had been developed to support Germany's ground forces, had liaison officers with the mobile formations, and operated a higher number of sorties per aircraft. In addition, German air parity or superiority allowed the unencumbered movement of ground forces, their unhindered assembly into concentrated attack formations, aerial reconnaissance, aerial resupply of fast moving formations and close air support at the point of attack. The Allied air forces had no close air support aircraft, training or doctrine. The Allies flew 434 French and 160 British sorties a day but methods of attacking ground targets had yet to be developed; therefore Allied aircraft caused negligible damage. Against these 600 sorties the Luftwaffe on average flew 1,500 sorties a day. On May 13, "Fliegerkorps" VIII flew 1,000 sorties in support of the crossing of the Meuse. The following day the Allies made repeated attempts to destroy the German pontoon bridges, but German fighter aircraft, ground fire and Luftwaffe flak batteries with the panzer forces destroyed 56 percent of the attacking Allied aircraft while the bridges remained intact.

Allied air superiority became a significant hindrance to German operations during the later years of the war. By June 1944 the Western Allies had complete control of the air over the battlefield and their fighter-bomber aircraft were very effective at attacking ground forces. On D-Day the Allies flew 14,500 sorties over the battlefield area alone, not including sorties flown over north-western Europe. Against this on 6 June the Luftwaffe flew some 300 sorties. Though German fighter presence over Normandy increased over the next days and weeks, it never approached the numbers the Allies commanded. Fighter-bomber attacks on German formations made movement during daylight almost impossible. Subsequently, shortages soon developed in food, fuel and ammunition, severely hampering the German defenders. German vehicle crews and even flak units experienced great difficulty moving during daylight. Indeed, the final German offensive operation in the west, <a href="Operation%20Wacht%20am%20Rhein">Operation Wacht am Rhein</a>, was planned to take place during poor weather to minimize interference by Allied aircraft. Under these conditions it was difficult for German commanders to employ the "armoured idea", if at all.

Blitzkrieg is vulnerable to an enemy that is robust enough to weather the shock of the attack and that does not panic at the idea of enemy formations in its rear area. This is especially true if the attacking formation lacks the reserve to keep funnelling forces into the spearhead, or lacks the mobility to provide infantry, artillery and supplies into the attack. If the defender can hold the shoulders of the breach they will have the opportunity to counter-attack into the flank of the attacker, potentially cutting off the van as happened to <a href="Joachim%20Peiper%23The%20Battle%20of%20the%20Bulge">Kampfgruppe Peiper</a> in the Ardennes.

During the Battle of France in 1940, the <a href="4th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28France%29">4th Armoured Division</a> (Major-General Charles de Gaulle) and elements of the 1st Army Tank Brigade <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29">(British Expeditionary Force)</a> made probing attacks on the German flank, pushing into the rear of the advancing armoured columns at times. This may have been a reason for Hitler to call a halt to the German advance. Those attacks combined with <a href="Maxime%20Weygand">Maxime Weygand</a>'s <a href="Hedgehog%20tactic">Hedgehog tactic</a> would become the major basis for responding to blitzkrieg attacks in the future: <a href="Defence%20in%20depth">deployment in depth</a>, permitting enemy or "shoulders" of a penetration was essential to channelling the enemy attack, and artillery, properly employed at the shoulders, could take a heavy toll of attackers. While Allied forces in 1940 lacked the experience to successfully develop these strategies, resulting in France's capitulation with heavy losses, they characterised later Allied operations. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kursk">Battle of Kursk</a> the Red Army employed a combination of defence in great depth, extensive minefields, and tenacious defence of breakthrough shoulders. In this way they depleted German combat power even as German forces advanced. The reverse can be seen in the Russian summer offensive of 1944, <a href="Operation%20Bagration">Operation Bagration</a>, which resulted in the destruction of Army Group Center. German attempts to weather the storm and fight out of encirclements failed due to the Russian ability to continue to feed armoured units into the attack, maintaining the mobility and strength of the offensive, arriving in force deep in the rear areas, faster than the Germans could regroup.

Although effective in quick campaigns against Poland and France, mobile operations could not be sustained by Germany in later years. Strategies based on manoeuvre have the inherent danger of the attacking force overextending its <a href="supply%20line">supply line</a>s, and can be defeated by a determined foe who is willing and able to sacrifice territory for time in which to regroup and rearm, as the Soviets did on the Eastern Front (as opposed to, for example, the Dutch who had no territory to sacrifice). Tank and vehicle production was a constant problem for Germany; indeed, late in the war many panzer "divisions" had no more than a few dozen tanks. As the end of the war approached, Germany also experienced critical shortages in <a href="fuel">fuel</a> and <a href="ammunition">ammunition</a> stocks as a result of Anglo-American <a href="strategic%20bombing">strategic bombing</a> and blockade. Although production of "Luftwaffe" fighter aircraft continued, they would be unable to fly for lack of fuel. What fuel there was went to panzer divisions, and even then they were not able to operate normally. Of those <a href="Tiger%20I">Tiger</a> tanks lost against the United States Army, nearly half of them were abandoned for lack of fuel.

German volunteers first used armour in live field conditions during the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> of 1936. Armour commitment consisted of Panzer Battalion 88, a force built around three companies of <a href="Panzer%20I">Panzer I</a> tanks that functioned as a training cadre for Nationalists. The Luftwaffe deployed squadrons of <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a>, dive bombers and <a href="Military%20transport%20aircraft">transport aircraft</a> as the "<a href="Condor%20Legion">Condor Legion</a>". Guderian said that the tank deployment was "on too small a scale to allow accurate assessments to be made." The true test of his "armoured idea" would have to wait for the Second World War. However, the "Luftwaffe" also provided volunteers to Spain to test both tactics and aircraft in combat, including the first combat use of the "Stuka".

During the war, the "Condor Legion" undertook the <a href="bombing%20of%20Guernica">bombing of Guernica</a> which had a tremendous psychological effect on the populations of Europe. The results were exaggerated, and the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Western Allies</a> concluded that the "city-busting" techniques were now a part of the German way in war. The targets of the German aircraft were actually the rail lines and bridges. But lacking the ability to hit them with accuracy (only three or four <a href="Ju%2087">Ju 87</a>s saw action in Spain), a method of <a href="carpet%20bombing">carpet bombing</a> was chosen resulting in heavy civilian casualties.

Despite the term "blitzkrieg" being coined by journalists during the Invasion of Poland of 1939, historians Matthew Cooper and J. P. Harris have written that German operations during it were consistent with traditional methods. The Wehrmacht strategy was more in line with "<a href="Vernichtungsgedanke">Vernichtungsgedanke</a>n" a focus on envelopment to create pockets in broad-front annihilation. Panzer forces were dispersed among the three German concentrations with little emphasis on independent use, being used to create or destroy close pockets of <a href="Polish%20Army">Polish forces</a> and seize operational-depth terrain in support of the largely un-motorized infantry which followed.

While early German tanks, Stuka dive-bombers and concentrated forces were used in the Polish campaign, the majority of the battle was conventional infantry and artillery warfare and most Luftwaffe action was independent of the ground campaign. Matthew Cooper wrote that

John Ellis wrote that "...there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper's assertion that the panzer divisions were not given the kind of "strategic" mission that was to characterize authentic armoured blitzkrieg, and were almost always closely subordinated to the various mass infantry armies." <a href="Steven%20Zaloga">Steven Zaloga</a> wrote, "Whilst Western accounts of the September campaign have stressed the shock value of the panzer and Stuka attacks, they have tended to underestimate the punishing effect of German artillery on Polish units. Mobile and available in significant quantity, artillery shattered as many units as any other branch of the Wehrmacht."

The German invasion of France, with subsidiary attacks on Belgium and the Netherlands, consisted of two phases, Operation Yellow ("<a href="Fall%20Gelb">Fall Gelb</a>") and Operation Red ("<a href="Fall%20Rot">Fall Rot</a>"). Yellow opened with a feint conducted against the Netherlands and Belgium by two armoured corps and <a href="paratrooper">paratrooper</a>s. Most of the German armoured forces were placed in Panzer Group von Kleist, which attacked through the <a href="Ardennes">Ardennes</a>, a lightly defended sector that the French planned to reinforce if need be, before the Germans could bring up heavy and siege artillery. There was no time for such a reinforcement to be sent, for the Germans did not wait for siege artillery but reached the Meuse and achieved a breakthrough at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sedan%20%281940%29">Battle of Sedan</a> in three days.

The group raced to the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>, reaching the coast at Abbeville and cut off the BEF, the <a href="Belgian%20Army">Belgian Army</a> and some of the best-equipped divisions of the <a href="French%20Army">French Army</a> in northern France. Armoured and motorised units under Guderian, Rommel and others, advanced far beyond the marching and horse-drawn infantry divisions and far in excess of that with which Hitler and the German high command expected or wished. When the Allies counter-attacked at <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281940%29">Arras</a> using the heavily armoured British <a href="Matilda%20I%20%28tank%29">Matilda I</a> and <a href="Matilda%20II">Matilda II</a> tanks, a brief panic was created in the German High Command. The armoured and motorised forces were halted by Hitler outside the port of <a href="Dunkirk">Dunkirk</a>, which was being used to evacuate the Allied forces. <a href="Hermann%20G%C3%B6ring">Hermann Göring</a> promised that the Luftwaffe would complete the destruction of the encircled armies but aerial operations failed to prevent the evacuation of the majority of the Allied troops. In <a href="Operation%20Dynamo">Operation Dynamo</a> some French and British troops escaped.

Case Yellow surprised everyone, overcoming the Allies' 4,000 armoured vehicles, many of which were better than German equivalents in armour and gun-power. The French and British frequently used their tanks in the dispersed role of infantry support rather than concentrating force at the point of attack, to create overwhelming firepower.
The French armies were much reduced in strength and the confidence of their commanders shaken. With much of their own armour and heavy equipment lost in Northern France, they lacked the means to fight a mobile war. The Germans followed their initial success with Operation Red, a triple-pronged offensive. The XV Panzer Corps attacked towards <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a>, <a href="XIV%20Panzer%20Corps">XIV Panzer Corps</a> attacked east of Paris, towards <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a> and the XIX Panzer Corps encircled the Maginot Line. The French were hard pressed to organise any sort of counter-attack and were continually ordered to form new defensive lines and found that German forces had already by-passed them and moved on. An armoured counter-attack organised by Colonel de Gaulle could not be sustained and he had to retreat.

Prior to the German offensive in May, Winston Churchill had said "Thank God for the French Army". That same French army collapsed after barely two months of fighting. This was in shocking contrast to the four years of trench warfare they had engaged in during the First World War. The French president of the Ministerial Council, Reynaud, attributed the collapse in a speech on 21 May 1940:

The Germans had not used paratroop attacks in France and only made one big drop in the Netherlands, to capture three bridges; some small glider-landings were conducted in Belgium to tank bottle-necks on routes of advance before the arrival of the main force (the most renowned being the landing on <a href="Fort%20Eben-Emael">Fort Eben-Emael</a> in Belgium).

Use of armoured forces was crucial for both sides on the Eastern Front. Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, involved a number of breakthroughs and encirclements by motorised forces. Its goal according to <a href="List%20of%20Adolf%20Hitler%27s%20directives">Führer Directive 21</a> (18 December 1940) was "to destroy the Russian forces deployed in the West and to prevent their escape into the wide-open spaces of Russia." The Red Army was to be destroyed west of the <a href="Daugava%20%28river%29">Dvina</a> and <a href="Dnieper">Dnieper</a> rivers, which were about east of the Soviet border, to be followed by a mopping-up operation. The surprise attack resulted in the near annihilation of the <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Forces">Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily</a> (VVS, Soviet Air Force) by simultaneous attacks on airfields, allowing the Luftwaffe to achieve total air supremacy over all the battlefields within the first week. On the ground, four German panzer groups outflanked and encircled disorganised Red Army units, while the marching infantry completed the encirclements and defeated the trapped forces. In late July, after <a href="2nd%20Panzer%20Group">2nd Panzer Group</a> (commanded by Guderian) captured the watersheds of the Dvina and Dnieper rivers near Smolensk, the panzers had to defend the encirclement, because the marching infantry divisions were still hundreds of kilometres to the west.

The Germans conquered large areas of the Soviet Union but their failure to destroy the Red Army before the winter of 1941 was a strategic failure that made German tactical superiority and territorial gains irrelevant. The Red Army had survived enormous losses and regrouped with new formations far to the rear of the front line. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moscow">Battle of Moscow</a>, the Red Army defeated the German <a href="Army%20Group%20Centre">Army Group Center</a> and for the first time in the war seized the strategic initiative.

In the summer of 1942, Germany launched another offensive in the southern <a href="USSR">USSR</a> against <a href="Stalingrad">Stalingrad</a> and the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>, the Soviets again lost tremendous amounts of territory, only to counter-attack once more during winter. German gains were ultimately limited by <a href="Hitler">Hitler</a> diverting forces from the attack on Stalingrad and driving towards the Caucasus oilfields simultaneously. The "Wehrmacht" became overstretched, although winning operationally, it could not inflict a decisive defeat as the durability of the Soviet Union's manpower, resources, industrial base and aid from the Western Allies began to take effect.

In July 1943 the "Wehrmacht" conducted Operation (Citadel) against a salient at <a href="Kursk">Kursk</a> that was heavily defended by Soviet troops. Soviet defensive tactics were by now hugely improved, particularly in the use of artillery and air support. By April 1943, the <a href="Stavka">Stavka</a> had learned of German intentions through intelligence supplied by front line reconnaissance and <a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> intercepts. In the following months, the Red Army constructed deep defensive belts along the paths of the planned German attack. The Soviets made a concerted effort to disguise their knowledge of German plans and the extent of their own defensive preparations, and the German commanders still hoped to achieve operational surprise when the attack commenced.

The Germans did not achieve surprise and were not able to outflank or break through into enemy rear areas during the operation. Several historians assert that Operation Citadel was planned and intended to be a blitzkrieg operation. Many of the German participants who wrote about the operation after the war, including Manstein, make no mention of blitzkrieg in their accounts. In 2000, Niklas Zetterling and Anders Frankson characterised only the southern pincer of the German offensive as a "classical blitzkrieg attack". Pier Battistelli wrote that the operational planning marked a change in German offensive thinking away from blitzkrieg and that more priority was given to brute force and fire power than to speed and manoeuvre.

In 1995, <a href="David%20Glantz">David Glantz</a> stated that for the first time, blitzkrieg was defeated in summer and the opposing Soviet forces were able to mount a successful counter-offensive. The Battle of Kursk ended with two Soviet counter-offensives and the revival of <a href="Soviet%20deep%20battle">deep operations</a>. In the summer of 1944, the Red Army destroyed Army Group Centre in <a href="Operation%20Bagration">Operation Bagration</a>, using combined-arms tactics for armour, infantry and air power in a coordinated strategic assault, known as deep operations, which led to an advance of in six weeks.

Allied armies began using combined arms formations and deep penetration strategies that Germany had used in the opening years of the war. Many Allied operations in the Western Desert and on the Eastern Front, relied on firepower to establish breakthroughs by fast-moving armoured units. These artillery-based tactics were also decisive in Western Front operations after <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Operation Overlord</a> and the British Commonwealth and American armies developed flexible and powerful systems for using artillery support. What the Soviets lacked in flexibility, they made up for in number of rocket launchers, guns and mortars. The Germans never achieved the kind of fire concentrations their enemies were capable of by 1944.

After the Allied landings at <a href="Normandy%20Landings">Normandy</a>, the Germans began a counter-offensive to overwhelm the landing force with armoured attacks but these failed for lack of co-ordination and Allied superiority in anti-tank defence and in the air. The most notable attempt to use deep penetration operations in Normandy was <a href="Operation%20Luttich">Operation Luttich</a> at Mortain, which only hastened the <a href="Falaise%20Pocket">Falaise Pocket</a> and the destruction of German forces in Normandy. The Mortain counter-attack was defeated by the US 12th Army Group with little effect on its own offensive operations.

The last German offensive on the Western front, the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bulge">Battle of the Bulge</a> (Operation "Wacht am Rhein"), was an offensive launched towards the port of <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> in December 1944. Launched in poor weather against a thinly held Allied sector, it achieved surprise and initial success as Allied air power was grounded by cloud cover. Determined defence by US troops in places throughout the Ardennes, the lack of good roads and German supply shortages caused delays. Allied forces deployed to the flanks of the German penetration and as soon as the skies cleared, Allied aircraft returned to the battlefield. Allied counter-attacks soon forced back the Germans, who abandoned much equipment for lack of fuel.

The origins of blitzkrieg are in some doubt: if it existed, who contributed to it, whether it was part of German war strategy from 1933–1939. There has been a great deal of debate about whether it existed as a coherent military strategy. Many historians now think that blitzkrieg was not a military theory and the campaigns conducted by the Germans from 1939 to <a href="circa">circa</a> 1942 (with the exception of Operation Barbarossa) were improvised, rather than being based on a particular military strategy. Blitzkrieg had been called a <a href="Revolution%20in%20Military%20Affairs">Revolution in Military Affairs</a> (RMA) but many writers and historians have concluded that the Germans did not invent a new form of warfare but applied new technologies to traditional ideas of "Bewegungskrieg" (manoeuvre warfare) to achieve decisive victory.

In 1965, <a href="Captain%20%28land%29">Captain</a> Robert O'Neill, Professor of the History of War at the <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> produced an example of the popular view. In "Doctrine and Training in the German Army 1919–1939", O'Neill wrote

Other historians wrote that blitzkrieg was an operational doctrine of the German armed forces and a strategic concept on which the leadership of the "<a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>" based its strategic and economic planning. Military planners and bureaucrats in the war economy appear rarely, if ever, to have employed the term "blitzkrieg" in official documents. That the German army had a "blitzkrieg doctrine" was rejected in the late 1970s by Matthew Cooper. The concept of a blitzkrieg "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" was challenged by <a href="Richard%20Overy">Richard Overy</a> in the late 1970s and by Williamson Murray in the mid-1980s. That the "Third Reich" went to war on the basis of "blitzkrieg economics" was criticised by Richard Overy in the 1980s and George Raudzens described the contradictory senses in which historians have used the word. The notion of a German blitzkrieg concept or doctrine survives in popular history and many historians still support the thesis.

Frieser wrote that after the failure of the <a href="Schlieffen%20Plan">Schlieffen Plan</a> in 1914, the German army concluded that decisive battles were no longer possible in the changed conditions of the twentieth century. Frieser wrote that the <a href="Oberkommando%20der%20Wehrmacht">Oberkommando der Wehrmacht</a> (OKW), which was created in 1938 had intended to avoid the decisive battle concepts of its predecessors and planned for a long war of exhaustion ("ermattungskrieg"). It was only after the improvised plan for the Battle of France in 1940 was unexpectedly successful, that the German General Staff came to believe that "vernichtungskrieg" was still feasible. German thinking reverted to the possibility of a quick and decisive war for the <a href="Balkans%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Balkan Campaign</a> and Operation Barbarossa.

Most academic historians regard the notion of blitzkrieg as military doctrine to be a myth. <a href="Shimon%20Naveh">Shimon Naveh</a> wrote "The striking feature of the blitzkrieg concept is the complete absence of a coherent theory which should have served as the general cognitive basis for the actual conduct of operations". Naveh described it as an "ad hoc solution" to operational dangers, thrown together at the last moment. Overy disagreed with the idea that Hitler and the Nazi regime ever intended a blitzkrieg war, because the once popular belief that the Nazi state organised their economy to carry out its grand strategy in short campaigns was false. Hitler had intended for a rapid unlimited war to occur much later than 1939, but the "Third Reich's" aggressive <a href="foreign%20policy">foreign policy</a> forced the Nazi state into war before it was ready. Hitler and the "<a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>'s" planning in the 1930s did not reflect a blitzkrieg method but the opposite. John Harris wrote that the Wehrmacht never used the word, and it did not appear in German army or air force field manuals; the word was coined in September 1939, by a "Times" newspaper reporter. Harris also found no evidence that German military thinking developed a blitzkrieg mentality. <a href="Karl-Heinz%20Frieser">Karl-Heinz Frieser</a> and <a href="Adam%20Tooze">Adam Tooze</a> reached similar conclusions to Overy and Naveh, that the notions of blitzkrieg-economy and strategy were myths. Frieser wrote that surviving German economists and General Staff officers denied that Germany went to war with a blitzkrieg strategy. <a href="Robert%20M.%20Citino">Robert M. Citino</a> argues:

In the 1960s, Alan Milward developed a theory of blitzkrieg economics, that Germany could not fight a long war and chose to avoid comprehensive rearmament and armed in breadth, to win quick victories. Milward described an economy positioned between a full war economy and a peacetime economy. The purpose of the blitzkrieg economy was to allow the German people to enjoy high living standards in the event of hostilities and avoid the economic hardships of the First World War.

Overy wrote that blitzkrieg as a "coherent military and economic concept has proven a difficult strategy to defend in light of the evidence". Milward's theory was contrary to Hitler's and German planners' intentions. The Germans, aware of the errors of the First World War, rejected the concept of organising its economy to fight only a short war. Therefore, focus was given to the development of armament in depth for a long war, instead of armament in breadth for a short war. Hitler claimed that relying on surprise alone was "criminal" and that "we have to prepare for a long war along with surprise attack". During the winter of 1939–40, Hitler demobilised many troops from the army to return as skilled workers to factories because the war would be decided by production, not a quick "Panzer operation".

In the 1930s, Hitler had ordered rearmament programs that cannot be considered limited. In November 1937 Hitler had indicated that most of the armament projects would be completed by 1943–45. The rearmament of the "<a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a>" was to have been completed in 1949 and the "Luftwaffe" rearmament program was to have matured in 1942, with a force capable of strategic bombing with <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a>s. The construction and training of motorised forces and a full mobilisation of the rail networks would not begin until 1943 and 1944 respectively. Hitler needed to avoid war until these projects were complete but his misjudgements in 1939 forced Germany into war before rearmament was complete.

After the war, <a href="Albert%20Speer">Albert Speer</a> claimed that the German economy achieved greater armaments output, not because of diversions of capacity from civilian to military industry but through streamlining of the economy. Richard Overy pointed out some 23 percent of German output was military by 1939. Between 1937 and 1939, 70 percent of investment capital went into the rubber, synthetic fuel, aircraft and shipbuilding industries. Hermann Göring had consistently stated that the task of the <a href="Four%20Year%20Plan">Four Year Plan</a> was to rearm Germany for total war. Hitler's correspondence with his economists also reveals that his intent was to wage war in 1943–1945, when the resources of central Europe had been absorbed into the "Third Reich".

Living standards were not high in the late 1930s. Consumption of consumer goods had fallen from 71 percent in 1928 to 59 percent in 1938. The demands of the war economy reduced the amount of spending in non-military sectors to satisfy the demand for the armed forces. On 9 September, Göring as Head of the "Reich Defence Council", called for complete "employment" of living and fighting power of the national economy for the duration of the war. Overy presents this as evidence that a "blitzkrieg economy" did not exist.

Adam Tooze wrote that the German economy was being prepared for a long war. The expenditure for this war was extensive and put the economy under severe strain. The German leadership were concerned less with how to balance the civilian economy and the needs of civilian consumption but to figure out how to best prepare the economy for total war. Once war had begun, Hitler urged his economic experts to abandon caution and expend all available resources on the war effort but the expansion plans only gradually gained momentum in 1941. Tooze wrote that the huge armament plans in the pre-war period did not indicate any clear-sighted blitzkrieg economy or strategy.

Frieser wrote that the () was not ready for blitzkrieg at the start of the war. A blitzkrieg method called for a young, highly skilled mechanised army. In 1939–40, 45 percent of the army was 40 years old and 50 percent of the soldiers had only a few weeks' training. The German army, contrary to the blitzkrieg legend, was not fully motorised and had only 120,000 vehicles, compared to the 300,000 of the French Army. The British also had an "enviable" contingent of motorised forces. Thus, "the image of the German 'Blitzkrieg' army is a figment of propaganda imagination". During the First World War the German army used 1.4 million horses for transport and in the Second World War used 2.7 million horses; only ten percent of the army was motorised in 1940.

Half of the German divisions available in 1940 were combat ready but less well-equipped than the British and French or the Imperial German Army of 1914. In the spring of 1940, the German army was semi-modern, in which a small number of well-equipped and "elite" divisions were offset by many second and third rate divisions". In 2003, John Mosier wrote that while the French soldiers in 1940 were better trained than German soldiers, as were the Americans later and that the German army was the least mechanised of the major armies, its leadership cadres were larger and better and that the high standard of leadership was the main reason for the successes of the German army in World War II, as it had been in World War I.

<a href="James%20Corum">James Corum</a> wrote that it was a myth that the "Luftwaffe" had a doctrine of <a href="terror%20bombing">terror bombing</a>, in which civilians were attacked to break the will or aid the collapse of an enemy, by the "Luftwaffe" in "Blitzkrieg" operations. After the bombing of Guernica in 1937 and the <a href="Rotterdam%20Blitz">Rotterdam Blitz</a> in 1940, it was commonly assumed that terror bombing was a part of "Luftwaffe" doctrine. During the interwar period the "Luftwaffe" leadership rejected the concept of terror bombing in favour of battlefield support and <a href="interdiction">interdiction</a> operations.

Corum continues: <a href="General">General</a> <a href="Walther%20Wever%20%28general%29">Walther Wever</a> compiled a doctrine known as "The Conduct of the Aerial War". This document, which the "Luftwaffe" adopted, rejected <a href="Giulio%20Douhet">Giulio Douhet</a>'s theory of terror bombing. Terror bombing was deemed to be "counter-productive", increasing rather than destroying the enemy's will to resist. Such bombing campaigns were regarded as diversion from the "Luftwaffe's" main operations; destruction of the enemy armed forces. The bombings of Guernica, Rotterdam and <a href="Bombing%20of%20Warsaw%20in%20World%20War%20II">Warsaw</a> were tactical missions in support of military operations and were not intended as strategic terror attacks.

J. P. Harris wrote that most Luftwaffe leaders from Goering through the general staff believed (as did their counterparts in Britain and the United States) that strategic bombing was the chief mission of the air force and that given such a role, the Luftwaffe would win the next war and that

The Luftwaffe did end up with an air force consisting mainly of relatively short-range aircraft, but this does not prove that the German air force was solely interested in ’tactical’ bombing. It happened because the German aircraft industry lacked the experience to build a long-range bomber fleet quickly, and because Hitler was insistent on the very rapid creation of a numerically large force. It is also significant that Germany's position in the centre of Europe to a large extent obviated the need to make a clear distinction between bombers suitable only for ’tactical’ and those necessary for strategic purposes in the early stages of a likely future war.

British theorists <a href="John%20Frederick%20Charles%20Fuller">John Frederick Charles Fuller</a> and Captain <a href="Basil%20Henry%20Liddell%20Hart">Basil Henry Liddell Hart</a> have often been associated with the development of blitzkrieg, though this is a matter of controversy. In recent years historians have uncovered that Liddell Hart distorted and falsified facts to make it appear as if his ideas were adopted. After the war Liddell Hart imposed his own perceptions, after the event, claiming that the mobile tank warfare practised by the "Wehrmacht" was a result of his influence. By manipulation and contrivance, Liddell Hart distorted the actual circumstances of the blitzkrieg formation, and he obscured its origins. Through his indoctrinated idealisation of an ostentatious concept, he reinforced the myth of blitzkrieg. By imposing, retrospectively, his own perceptions of mobile warfare upon the shallow concept of blitzkrieg, he "created a theoretical imbroglio that has taken 40 years to unravel." Blitzkrieg was not an official doctrine and historians in recent times have come to the conclusion that it did not exist as such.

The early 1950s literature transformed blitzkrieg into a historical military doctrine, which carried the signature of Liddell Hart and Guderian. The main evidence of Liddell Hart's deceit and "tendentious" report of history can be found in his letters to <a href="Erich%20von%20Manstein">Erich von Manstein</a>, Heinz Guderian and the relatives and associates of <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a>. Liddell Hart, in letters to Guderian, "imposed his own fabricated version of blitzkrieg on the latter and compelled him to proclaim it as original formula". <a href="Kenneth%20Macksey">Kenneth Macksey</a> found Liddell Hart's original letters to Guderian in the General's papers, requesting that Guderian give him credit for "impressing him" with his ideas of armoured warfare. When Liddell Hart was questioned about this in 1968 and the discrepancy between the English and German editions of Guderian's memoirs, "he gave a conveniently unhelpful though strictly truthful reply. ('There is nothing about the matter in my file of correspondence with Guderian himself except...that I thanked him...for what he said in that additional paragraph'.)".

During World War I, Fuller had been a staff officer attached to the <a href="Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">new tank corps</a>. He developed <a href="Plan%201919">Plan 1919</a> for massive, independent tank operations, which he claimed were subsequently studied by the German military. It is variously argued that Fuller's wartime plans and post-war writings were an inspiration or that his readership was low and German experiences during the war received more attention. The German view of themselves as the losers of the war, may be linked to the senior and experienced officers' undertaking a thorough review, studying and rewriting of all their Army doctrine and training manuals.

Fuller and Liddell Hart were "outsiders": Liddell Hart was unable to serve as a soldier after 1916 after being gassed on the Somme and Fuller's abrasive personality resulted in his premature retirement in 1933. Their views had limited impact in the British army; the War Office permitted the formation of an <a href="Experimental%20Mechanized%20Force">Experimental Mechanized Force</a> on 1 May 1927, composed of tanks, <a href="Truck">lorried</a> infantry, <a href="Birch%20gun">self-propelled artillery</a> and motorised engineers but the force was disbanded in 1928 on the grounds that it had served its purpose. A new experimental brigade was intended for the next year and became a permanent formation in 1933, during the cuts of the financial years.

It has been argued that blitzkrieg was not new; the Germans did not invent something called blitzkrieg in the 1920s and 1930s. Rather the German concept of wars of movement and concentrated force were seen in wars of <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> and the <a href="Unification%20of%20Germany">German wars of unification</a>. The first European general to introduce rapid movement, concentrated power and integrated military effort was Swedish King <a href="Gustavus%20Adolphus">Gustavus Adolphus</a> during the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>. The appearance of the aircraft and tank in the First World War, called an RMA, offered the German military a chance to get back to the traditional war of movement as practised by <a href="Moltke%20the%20Elder">Moltke the Elder</a>. The so-called "blitzkrieg campaigns" of 1939 – circa 1942, were well within that operational context.

At the outbreak of war, the German army had no radically new theory of war. The operational thinking of the German army had not changed significantly since the First World War or since the late 19th century. J. P. Harris and <a href="Robert%20M.%20Citino">Robert M. Citino</a> point out that the Germans had always had a marked preference for short, decisive campaigns – but were unable to achieve short-order victories in First World War conditions. The transformation from the stalemate of the First World War into tremendous initial operational and strategic success in the Second, was partly the employment of a relatively small number of mechanised divisions, most importantly the Panzer divisions, and the support of an exceptionally powerful <a href="air%20force">air force</a>.

Heinz Guderian is widely regarded as being highly influential in developing the military methods of warfare used by Germany's tank men at the start of the Second World War. This style of warfare brought manoeuvre back to the fore, and placed an emphasis on the offensive. This style, along with the shockingly rapid collapse in the armies that opposed it, came to be branded as blitzkrieg warfare.

Following Germany's military reforms of the 1920s, Heinz Guderian emerged as a strong proponent of mechanised forces. Within the Inspectorate of Transport Troops, Guderian and colleagues performed theoretical and field exercise work. Guderian met with opposition from some in the General Staff, who were distrustful of the new weapons and who continued to view the infantry as the primary weapon of the army. Among them, Guderian claimed, was Chief of the General Staff <a href="Ludwig%20Beck">Ludwig Beck</a> (1935–38), whom he alleged was sceptical that armoured forces could be decisive. This claim has been disputed by later historians. James Corum wrote:

By Guderian's account he single-handedly created the German tactical and operational methodology. Between 1922 and 1928 Guderian wrote a number of articles concerning military movement. As the ideas of making use of the combustible engine in a protected encasement to bring mobility back to warfare developed in the German army, Guderian was a leading proponent of the formations that would be used for this purpose. He was later asked to write an explanatory book, which was titled "Achtung Panzer!" (1937). In it he explained the theories of the tank men and defended them.

Guderian argued that the tank would be the decisive weapon of the next war. "If the tanks succeed, then victory follows", he wrote. In an article addressed to critics of tank warfare, he wrote "until our critics can produce some new and better method of making a successful land attack other than self-massacre, we shall continue to maintain our beliefs that tanks—properly employed, needless to say—are today the best means available for land attack." Addressing the faster rate at which defenders could reinforce an area than attackers could penetrate it during the First World War, Guderian wrote that "since reserve forces will now be motorized, the building up of new defensive fronts is easier than it used to be; the chances of an offensive based on the timetable of artillery and infantry co-operation are, as a result, even slighter today than they were in the last war." He continued, "We believe that by attacking with tanks we can achieve a higher rate of movement than has been hitherto obtainable, and—what is perhaps even more important—that we can keep moving once a breakthrough has been made." Guderian additionally required that tactical radios be widely used to facilitate co-ordination and command by having one installed in all tanks.

Guderian's leadership was supported, fostered and institutionalised by his supporters in the Reichswehr General Staff system, which worked the Army to greater and greater levels of capability through massive and systematic Movement Warfare war games in the 1930s. Guderian's book incorporated the work of theorists such as Ludwig Ritter von Eimannsberger, whose book, "The Tank War" ("Der Kampfwagenkrieg") (1934) gained a wide audience in the German army. Another German theorist, Ernst Volckheim, wrote a huge amount on tank and combined arms tactics and was influential to German thinking on the use of armoured formations but his work was not acknowledged in Guderian's writings.

Its characters include "<a href="Dennis%20the%20Menace%20%28UK%29">Dennis the Menace</a>", "<a href="Minnie%20the%20Minx">Minnie the Minx</a>", "<a href="The%20Bash%20Street%20Kids">The Bash Street Kids</a>", "<a href="The%20Numskulls">The Numskulls</a>", "<a href="Roger%20the%20Dodger">Roger the Dodger</a>", "<a href="Billy%20Whizz">Billy Whizz</a>" and "<a href="Ball%20Boy%20%28Beano%29">Ball Boy</a>". Earlier characters who have been phased out include "<a href="Ivy%20the%20Terrible">Ivy the Terrible</a>", "<a href="Calamity%20James">Calamity James</a>", "<a href="The%20Three%20Bears%20%28comic%20strip%29">The Three Bears</a>" and "<a href="Pansy%20Potter">Pansy Potter</a>". Some old characters, like "<a href="Biffo%20the%20Bear">Biffo the Bear</a>", "<a href="Lord%20Snooty">Lord Snooty</a>", "<a href="Baby%20Face%20Finlayson">Baby Face Finlayson</a>" and "<a href="Little%20Plum">Little Plum</a>", have more recently made a return as "funsize" quarter-page strips.

The style of "Beano" humour has shifted noticeably over the years, though the longstanding tradition of anarchic humour has remained. For decades strips have appeared to glorify immoral behaviour, e.g. pranking ("Dennis the Menace"), dishonesty ("Roger the Dodger") and even robbery ("Baby Face Finlayson" and "The Three Bears"). Although the readers' sympathies are assumed to be with the miscreants, the latter are very often shown punished for their actions. Recent years have seen a rise in humour involving gross bodily functions, especially flatulence (which would have been taboo in children's comics prior to the 1990s), while depictions of corporal punishment have declined. For example, the literal slipper (Dennis the Menace's father's instrument of chastisement) has become the name of the local chief of police (Sergeant Slipper).

In 1921, D. C. Thomson had first entered the field of boys' story papers with "<a href="Adventure%20%28D.C.%20Thomson%29">Adventure</a>". The success of this paper led to five further publications, "<a href="The%20Rover%20%28comics%29">The Rover</a>" and "<a href="The%20Wizard%20%28comic%29">The Wizard</a>" in 1922, "<a href="The%20Vanguard%20%28comic%29">The Vanguard</a>" in 1924, "<a href="Skipper%20%28comic%29">The Skipper</a>" in 1930 and "<a href="Hotspur%20%28comic%29">The Hotspur</a>" in 1933. Although "The Vanguard" folded in 1926, the others were a great triumph and became known as "The Big Five"; they ended Amalgamated Press's near-monopoly of the British comic industry.

Another success was the "Fun Section" of D. C. Thomson's Scottish weekly newspaper "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Post">The Sunday Post</a>", which included the two strips "<a href="Oor%20Wullie">Oor Wullie</a>" and "<a href="The%20Broons">The Broons</a>" by lead artist <a href="Dudley%20Watkins">Dudley Watkins</a>, as well as other funnies and various puzzles and adventure stories. This gave <a href="R.%20D.%20Low">R. D. Low</a>, the head of children's publications at D. C. Thomson at the time, the idea to create another Big Five, this time of comics intended for both boys and girls and consisting mainly of 'funnies' and more lighthearted adventure and text stories. The first of these publications, "The Dandy", commenced in 1937 and was followed by "The Beano" on 26 July 1938. ("The Beano" comic takes its name from the <a href="English%20language">English</a> word "beano" which can be loosely interpreted as "a good time".) A third paper, "<a href="The%20Magic%20Comic">The Magic Comic</a>", aimed at a slightly younger audience, followed in July 1939, but ceased publication in early 1941, due to paper rationing. Wartime shortages also prevented the New Big Five project from being completed.

The first edition of "The Beano" was dated 30 July 1938. A facsimile of the first issue's cover was printed on the back of issue No. 2,000. There are only 12 known copies of the first issue in existence, and only five known copies of the second issue (not including facsimiles). A copy of the first issue sold for £12,100 on 16 March 2004, which was at the time thought to be the highest price ever paid for a British comic at an <a href="auction">auction</a>. (The current highest price is £20,350, which was paid for the first issue of "The Dandy" on 7 September 2004.)

During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, "The Beano" and "<a href="The%20Dandy">The Dandy</a>" were published on alternating weeks because of paper and ink <a href="rationing">rationing</a>. D. C. Thomson's other publications also suffered, with the "<a href="Oor%20Wullie">Oor Wullie</a>" and "<a href="The%20Broons">The Broons</a>" annuals falling victim to paper and ink shortages. Paper and ink supplies were fully restored shortly after the end of hostilities and weekly publication of "The Beano" and "The Dandy" resumed in 1949.

The 3,000th issue of "The Beano" was published in January 2000. "The Beano" is now the longest-running weekly comic, since "The Dandy" became a fortnightly comic in 2007.

"The Beano"'s weekly circulation in April 1950 was 1,974,072; it currently sells slightly over 31,000 copies per week.

"The Beano" is so popular that it had its own section of the <a href="Chessington%20World%20of%20Adventures">Chessington World of Adventures</a> theme park, "Beanoland". This opened in 2000 and survived for a <a href="decade">decade</a> before sponsorship was eventually lost. Most of the major Beanoland attractions remain in operation today but have been rethemed as "Wild Asia".

On 19 March 2012 <a href="Royal%20Mail">Royal Mail</a> launched a special stamp collection to celebrate Britain's rich comic book history. The collection featured "The Beano", "<a href="The%20Dandy">The Dandy</a>", "<a href="Eagle%20%28comic%29">Eagle</a>", "<a href="The%20Topper%20%28comics%29">The Topper</a>", "<a href="Roy%20of%20the%20Rovers%20%28comic%29">Roy of the Rovers</a>", "<a href="Bunty">Bunty</a>", "<a href="Buster%20%28comics%29">Buster</a>", "<a href="Valiant%20%28comics%29">Valiant</a>", "<a href="Twinkle%20%28comics%29">Twinkle</a>" and "<a href="2000%20AD%20%28comics%29">2000 AD</a>".

The original editor was George Moonie from 1938–59; followed by Harold Cramond from 1959-84.

Euan Kerr was editor from 1984 until he handed over the reins to Alan Digby in early 2006. Digby had been "Beano" Chief Sub Editor when Kerr first became editor, and later edited "<a href="The%20Beezer">The Beezer</a>". Kerr has returned to edit "BeanoMAX" as of issue 2 (see below). Following the retirement of Kerr, Digby took over as Editor-in-Chief of both titles. Digby retired in 2011, leaving Michael Stirling as the new editor.

The latest editor of "The Beano" is Craig Graham, who joined "The Beano" once "The Dandy" announced its closure. Upon his arrival as editor he has made many changes to "The Beano", and has already revamped the publication twice, despite only becoming editor in August 2012.


The "Beano"'s first major revamp was in the 50th birthday issue of 1988, when the page number was increased, the comic had a wider paper style, and more colour was used throughout. Another occurred in issue 2,674, dated 16 October 1993, when the whole comic was now printed in full colour, along with some new strips such as "<a href="The%20Numskulls">The Numskulls</a>", which had been moved from "<a href="The%20Beezer">The Beezer</a>".

No major revamps happened from then until 1998, when Dennis' baby sister Bea was born. The logo was rounded and embossed (but later flattened in February 1999), and there were 8 extra pages. Computers were starting to be used for articles and speech bubbles, rather than the usual hand drawn ones.

Since April 2007, "The Beano" has had five revamps to help it keep up to date. The first occurred on 7 April 2007. The logo was raised using a heavy black drop shadow, and the body of the lettering and its yellow trim were separated by a subtle 3D groove effect. The website address was looped inside the "O". This logo had been used in the Beano Club for one issue in 2006. Two new comic strips were introduced, these being "<a href="The%20Riot%20Squad%20%28Beano%29">The Riot Squad</a>" and "<a href="Fred%27s%20Bed">Fred's Bed</a>", reprints from "<a href="Hoot%20%28comic%29">Hoot</a>" and "<a href="The%20Beezer">The Beezer</a>" and "<a href="The%20Topper%20%28comics%29">Topper</a>" respectively. There was a record number of uncredited <a href="reprint">reprint</a>s, with the likes of "<a href="Ivy%20the%20Terrible">Ivy the Terrible</a>", "<a href="Calamity%20James">Calamity James</a>", "<a href="Les%20Pretend">Les Pretend</a>" also being reprinted. In certain areas of the UK, such as <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, the price was increased to 99p, while elsewhere it remained as 85p.

The second happened on 27 October 2007. The logo was still grooved, but was now back to the rounded style which it had from 1999 to 2006. It was quite similar to the original rounded logo from 1998, which was flattened the following year.<br>
The number of reprint pages was cut from 4 to 2, but more started to appear after about a month. Two new strips were also added, "<a href="Johnny%20Bean%20from%20Happy%20Bunny%20Green">Johnny Bean from Happy Bunny Green</a>" and "<a href="London%20B412">London B412</a>". The price increased to 99p across the whole UK.

The third was the least major revamp. The background was changed from one colour behind the logo and another behind the Dennis strip to one single colour or a pattern, such as red and black stripes. New fonts were being used on the front cover, and the "Pocket money price" logo had been changed to a large "WOW! 99p" which was usually placed in the top corners. No new strips were added this time, but the amount of reprints went up to 5, sometimes lowering back to 4 per week, and an extra "<a href="Dennis%20the%20Menace%20%28UK%29">Dennis</a>" strip was added on the inside back two pages.

The fourth revamp, which happened with the issue dated 18 October 2008 is the most major revamp to date. There was a return of "<a href="Billy%20the%20Cat%20and%20Katie">Billy the Cat</a>" inside, as well as a new "<a href="Super%20School">Super School</a>" strip by <a href="Lew%20Stringer">Lew Stringer</a>. The price rose to £1.25 per issue. Different characters appear on the 'O' each week in a cleaner and tidier embossed logo. New headline fonts were introduced (CCZoinks), the balloon font was also changed to Cloudsplitter by <a href="Blambot">Blambot</a>. But the main change was the paper style, which had finally changed from <a href="newsprint">newsprint</a> to a <a href="glossy%20paper">glossy paper</a>, much in the style of the inside pages of the then companion papers "<a href="Dandy%20Xtreme">Dandy Xtreme</a>" and "<a href="BeanoMAX">BeanoMAX</a>". The only difference between these paper styles is the front cover, which was thicker on the "Dandy Xtreme" and "BeanoMAX", but the same as the pages throughout in the weekly "Beano".

As of late 2010, "The Beano" is printed by BGP and the comic is now in an A4 format. A mild revision of style accompanies this with balloon font changed to CCTimeSaleLower, an upper and lower case font and a much larger Beano logo on the cover. The font CCZoinks appears to have less prominence with CreativeBlockBold taking centre stage. The Beano Club was closed down in 2010 and its pages changed to Beano VIP with more online presence. The paper is still glossy, but the paper stock gives it a matte feel. At the start of 2011, the Beano VIP pages were dropped from the comic, but the online features remain.

In the issue dated 12 October 2011, there was another revamp. The comic was expanded to 36 pages, and the paper stock was made smoother. The "<a href="Number%2013%20%28comics%29">Number 13</a>" and "The Germs" strips returned as reprints. A reader's page was also reintroduced, this time titled the Menace Gallery. After two appearances, this was renamed "The Treehouse".

In the issue dated 28 January 2012, "The Beano"'s cover changed. The logo was now more like the logo from 1972-1998, but with "The" inside the B much like later versions of the logo. The special "O"s that had appeared sometimes in the last year were also kept. The first panel of the Dennis & Gnasher strip also appeared on the cover, like from 1972-2008, but the "This Week In Beanotown" feature still appeared across the bottom.

In late 2012, Craig Graham took over as Beano editor and revamped the comic. As a result, two mini-strip pages titled 'Funsize Funnies' were introduced and featured "<a href="Simply%20Smiffy">Simply Smiffy</a>", "<a href="Rasher">Rasher</a>", "<a href="Little%20Plum">Little Plum</a>", "<a href="Les%20Pretend">Les Pretend</a>", "<a href="Pup%20Parade">Pup Parade</a>", "<a href="Baby%20Face%20Finlayson">Baby Face Finlayson</a>" as well as two new strips "<a href="Gnash%20Gnews">Gnash Gnews</a>" and Winston and also introduced artists such as <a href="Wilbur%20Dawbarn">Wilbur Dawbarn</a> (who took over Billy Whizz from <a href="Nick%20Brennan">Nick Brennan</a>), <a href="Lew%20Stringer">Lew Stringer</a> (not seen in the Beano since Super School), <a href="Alexander%20Matthews">Alexander Matthews</a>, <a href="Paul%20Palmer%20%28comics%29">Paul Palmer</a> and <a href="Nigel%20Auchterlounie">Nigel Auchterlounie</a>. Auchterlounie soon took over writing "Dennis the Menace and Gnasher" also which had returned to its pre-2009 style with new characters from the 2009 TV series. In January 2013, "<a href="Biffo%20the%20Bear">Biffo the Bear</a>", "<a href="Pansy%20Potter">Pansy Potter</a>", "<a href="Lord%20Snooty">Lord Snooty</a>" and "<a href="Gnipper">Gnipper</a>" were added to the Funsize Funnies, introducing Graham Howie to the Beano and being the return of Wayne Thompson. Later that year, two new comic strips were added called "<a href="Big%20Time%20Charlie">Big Time Charlie</a>" and "<a href="Tricky%20Dicky%20%28comics%29">Tricky Dicky</a>" (relaunch of the classic Topper star) and "<a href="Stunt%20Gran">Stunt Gran</a>", "<a href="BamBeanos">BamBeanos</a>", "<a href="BSK%20CCTV">BSK CCTV</a>" joined the Funsize Funnies replacing Gnash Gnews, Pup Parade and Pansy Potter. Puzzle pages frequently appeared in the comic now, with Jamie Smart and Lew Stringer originally drawing the puzzles, and later on other artists such as Steve Beckett and Barrie Appleby.

As a celebration, in partnership with the <a href="CLIC%20Sargent">CLIC Sargent</a> charity, 2 August 2008 was Gnashional Menace Day, where children were sponsored to behave like Dennis. The anniversary was also celebrated with a 40-page issue (instead of 32 pages; the 60th birthday issue also had extra pages, 48 instead of 24) guest edited by "<a href="Wallace%20and%20Gromit">Wallace and Gromit</a>" creator <a href="Nick%20Park">Nick Park</a>, price £1.50 (not 99p) and an issue of <a href="Classics%20from%20the%20Comics">Classics from the Comics</a> devoted to the Beano. There is also a special 64-page book available, "The Beano Special Collectors Edition: 70 Years of Fun", giving a brief history of the comic. In the Beano's home city of <a href="Dundee">Dundee</a>, a special exhibition was held at the <a href="University%20of%20Dundee">University of Dundee</a> featuring original artwork and other memorabilia loaned from D.C. Thomson - it ran until 20 September 2008. In London the Cartoon Museum showed the exhibition "Beano and Dandy Birthday Bash!" from 30 July to 2 November 2008, featuring original artwork from all eight decades of both "The Beano" and "The Dandy", including work by <a href="Dudley%20D.%20Watkins">Dudley D. Watkins</a>, <a href="David%20Law">David Law</a>, <a href="Leo%20Baxendale">Leo Baxendale</a> and <a href="Ken%20Reid%20%28comics%29">Ken Reid</a> as well as <a href="David%20Sutherland%20%28comics%20artist%29">David Sutherland</a> and many contemporary artists. There were events for children throughout August.
There was also a special coffee table book called "", published by Waverly Books.

In the 75th Anniversary Special, "The Beano" had yet another revamp introducing celebrities as regular characters. As a result, all of the Funsize Funnies as well as the two new recently added comic strips "<a href="Tricky%20Dicky%20%28comics%29">Tricky Dicky</a>" and "<a href="Big%20Time%20Charlie">Big Time Charlie</a>" plus the reprinted "Calamity James" were all dropped. "Bananaman" came out of Geering reprints after being in them for over a year with Wayne Thompson reprising the role of artist after drawing him previously in "The Dandy" from 2010-12. "Roger the Dodger" was taken over by Jamie Smart and "Ball Boy" was taken over by Alexander Matthews and completely relaunched. Nigel Auchterlounie also took over as scriptwriter of "The Bash Street Kids" and "Bananaman", as well as now both writing and drawing "The Numskulls" which itself had had a huge relaunch with one-off celebrities replacing the role of Edd starting with Ant and Dec.

12-year-old artist Zoom Rockman also joined "The Beano" in this issue, drawing "Skanky Pigeon" which appeared monthly. In the issue after the 75th Anniversary Special, fourteen new comic strips joined "The Beano" with twelve of these becoming the new Funsize Funnies stories, all of which are parodies of either a celebrity or television show: "High School Moozical", "Neigh-Bours", "Celebrity Believe It or Not", "I Pity the School", "Murs Attacks", "Ashley's Banjo", "Coronation Bleat", "Jose's Back", "Simon's Bowel", "Guess Who?", "Watch-Hog" and "Danny Diddly O'Donoghue" as well as two new one-page stories to replace "Tricky Dicky" and "Big Time Charlie": "El Poco Loco" and "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turkeys".

Stu Munro also took over as both puzzle page artist (as he did in "The Dandy") and "The Dandy's Madvertisements" were brought back with Stu Munro once again drawing them. Since the 75th Anniversary Special revamp, "The Beano" has now gained <a href="Andy%20Fanton">Andy Fanton</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Waller">Stephen Waller</a>, <a href="Dean%20Rankine">Dean Rankine</a>, <a href="Garry%20Davies">Garry Davies</a> and <a href="Rick%20Eades">Rick Eades</a> all from "The Dandy" and the only original Beano artists that remain in the comic are <a href="David%20Sutherland%20%28comics%20artist%29">David Sutherland</a>, <a href="Laura%20Howell">Laura Howell</a> and <a href="Nigel%20Parkinson">Nigel Parkinson</a> since <a href="Barrie%20Appleby">Barrie Appleby</a>, <a href="Barry%20Glennard">Barry Glennard</a>, <a href="Hunt%20Emerson">Hunt Emerson</a> and <a href="Dave%20Eastbury">Dave Eastbury</a> all appear to have gone.

A number of strips in the comic have run for a very long time. The top five longest running Beano comic strips are, in descending order, "Dennis the Menace", "Minnie the Minx", "Bash Street Kids", "Roger the Dodger", and then the last holder of the title before "Dennis", "Lord Snooty".
"Dennis the Menace"'s famous red and black jersey had formed the colours of a few of the "Beano" characters' clothes ("Minnie the Minx" has the same, although the placement of the stripes is a bit different; "Ball Boy"&apos;s was a vertical red and black; "Roger the Dodger" has a chessboard design top, and Danny (from the "Bash Street Kids") has a similar cap), but they have changed for "Minnie" and "Ball Boy" ("Minnie" at one point had a red and yellow top and "Ball Boy"&apos;s strip is now black and blue).

There are frequent <a href="fictional%20crossover">fictional crossover</a>s between "Beano" characters, with most of the characters living in the <a href="fictional">fictional</a> "<a href="Beanotown">Beanotown</a>". Many of the comic strips in "The Dandy" are drawn by the same artists, and crossovers between the two comics also occur occasionally. Quite often, one comic will make a tongue-in-cheek jibe at the other (e.g., a character meeting an elderly lady, and stating that she's "older than the jokes in "The Dandy""). In the strips, it is expressed that the two towns are rivals with each other and before "The Dandy" did a drastic format change they had an embassy in "Beanotown" which many of the town's citizens attempted to overrun, but failed (the embassy had no existence in "The Beano"). This rivalry inspired the spin-off computer game "<a href="Beanotown%20Racing">Beanotown Racing</a>", in which various characters from both comics could be raced around points in "Beanotown", including the Embassy. The game was given a large amount of advance publicity in the comics, with story lines often revolving how the characters each acquired his/her vehicle.

Occasionally there are longer than usual strips for example a strip of sixteen pages rather than the usual two pages. These longer strips include "<a href="The%20Bash%20Street%20Kids">The Bash Street Kids</a>" Adventures written and drawn by <a href="Kev%20F%20Sutherland">Kev F Sutherland</a> which since 2004 have featured parodies of famous comic strip images, including "<a href="Amazing%20Fantasy">Amazing Fantasy</a>"'s first "<a href="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a>" cover, <a href="Action%20Comics">Action Comics</a>' first "<a href="Superman">Superman</a>" cover, and most recently the cover of "<a href="X-Men">X-Men</a>" No. 100.

During the 1980s, "The Beano" ran a 'Readers' Request' feature where readers could request for a particular comic strip to feature in the Beano. This led to the return of dropped characters, including "<a href="Little%20Plum">Little Plum</a>", "<a href="Baby%20Face%20Finlayson">Baby Face Finlayson</a>" and "<a href="The%20McTickles">The McTickles</a>", but also led to the introduction of new strips such as "<a href="Little%20Monkey">Little Monkey</a>".

Reader polls started to appear in the 1990s, allowing the readers to rate the strips in the comic. These polls have been quite influential, as they indicate which strips the readers like best, and strips that have performed poorly in these polls were usually dropped.

On a number of occasions, the Beano has allowed its readers to vote for which new strips they want to appear in the comic. This usually consists of three new comic strips being run for a number of weeks and the readers can vote on which strips they prefer and the one that receives the most votes stays in the Beano. Readers have been able to cast their votes via telephone, or more recently via the Beano website.

The first such vote occurred in 1995 with "<a href="Vic%20Volcano">Vic Volcano</a>" emerging as the winner. In the 1997 competition, two new strips were added permanently, with "<a href="Tim%20Traveller">Tim Traveller</a>" winning and "<a href="Crazy%20for%20Daisy">Crazy for Daisy</a>" the runner-up. By the early 2000s, these competitions were named Comic Idol (in reference to "<a href="Pop%20Idol">Pop Idol</a>"). In the 2004 competition, the margin between winner "<a href="Joe%20Jitsu">Joe Jitsu</a>" and runner-up "<a href="Colin%20the%20Vet">Colin the Vet</a>" was 1%, so both strips were added to the comic.

The most recent incarnation in 2010 featured three new strips, "<a href="Meebo%20and%20Zuky">Meebo and Zuky</a>", "<a href="Home%20Invasion">Home Invasion</a>", and "<a href="Uh%20oh%20Si%20Co%21">Uh oh Si Co!</a>". "Meebo and Zuky" won, with "Home Invasion" finishing as runner-up, though only "Meebo and Zuky" were added to the comic. In 2011, the Dandy did a similar competition where readers voted for their favourite out of four strips, entitled "Strictly Come Laughing" (a reference to "<a href="Strictly%20Come%20Dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a>").

Since 1982 the comic, along with "The Dandy", has also run "Comic Library" titles. Released monthly, these titles are a feature length (usually about 64-page) adventure, featuring a character from the comic itself. They are available in A5 size only. In 1998, these were replaced by the "<a href="Fun%20Size%20Comics">Fun Size Beano</a>". Fun Size Comics were discontinued in late 2010.

The comic also ran A4-sized "<a href="Beano%20Specials">Beano Specials</a>" in 1987 with full coloured pages, which later were replaced by "<a href="Beano%20Superstars">Beano Superstars</a>" which ran for 121 issues from 1992-2002. These were similar to the Comic Library series. Some of the last issues were printed versions of episodes from the 1996-1998 <a href="Dennis%20the%20Menace%20and%20Gnasher%20%281996%20TV%20series%29">"Dennis and Gnasher" animated TV series</a>. A "Beano Poster Comic" series was also printed in the early 1990s.

The Beano Specials returned in 2003, and were now published seasonally. The issues were numbered, and the first one was a Dennis and Friends special, the last a Christmas reprint special. These were replaced by BeanoMAX in early 2007.

On 15 February 2007, the first issue of a monthly comic entitled BeanoMAX was published. The sister comic features many of the same characters, however the stories in BeanoMAX are written in a longer format meant for 10- to 13-year-olds. The first issue was a <a href="Comic%20Relief%20%28charity%29">Comic Relief</a> special featuring assorted <a href="celebrity">celebrity</a> guests.

"Plug" was a comic based on the eponymous character from "<a href="The%20Bash%20Street%20Kids">The Bash Street Kids</a>" that began with issue dated 24 September 1977, and is notable for being the first comic to make use of <a href="rotogravure">rotogravure</a> printing. The magazine similar in style to I.P.C's "Krazy" which had started the previous year. It contained uncharacteristically outlandish material for D C. Thomson, as well as later including celebrity appearances in the comic.

The comic revealed Plug's full name to be Percival Proudfoot Plugsley and also gave him a pet monkey by the name of Chumkee. Plug's strip was mostly drawn by <a href="Vic%20Neill">Vic Neill</a> but other artists, including <a href="Dave%20Gudgeon">Dave Gudgeon</a> drew some later strips. Other strips included "Antchester United", "Violent Elizabeth", "Eebagoom", "Hugh's Zoo" and "D'ye Ken John Squeal and his Hopeless Hounds".

The venture was unsuccessful, in part because the comic cost 9p, with the "Beano" at the time only costing 4p and most of its rivals priced similarly. It merged with "<a href="The%20Beezer">The Beezer</a>" on 24 February 1979.

The brand new "Dennis and Gnasher" was launched separately from "The Beano" in September 2009.

"Dennis and Gnasher" got their own TV series on <a href="CBBC">CBBC</a> from 7 September 2009 to accompany the comic's new look. This was their second, having also had one in 1996, which ran for two series on CBBC, "<a href="The%20Children%27s%20Channel">The Children's Channel</a>", and "<a href="Fox%20Kids">Fox Kids</a>". It also marked the debut of this Dennis in the US, as "The Beano" is not distributed in the US and the title is taken by the "<a href="Dennis%20the%20Menace%20%28U.S.%20comics%29">newspaper comic strip</a>"- the series aired from 10 October 2010 to 10 December 2013 on what was then known as "The Hub" (now renamed "<a href="Discovery%20Family">Discovery Family</a>").

On 8 June 2016, it was announced via a press release that the Beano would now form a studio under their name. The studio would be use to bring their characters to life via other forms of media, such as television, film and live performances, to allow their properties to be distributed around the world for all audiences. Soon after the announcement of the studio's formation, news was released about a new television series based upon the companies famous "Dennis the Menace" property, which unlike its previous versions, would be done in CGI rather than the classic 2D style drawing. The studio would also revamp the website, "beano.com".

Bees are flying <a href="insect">insect</a>s closely related to <a href="wasp">wasp</a>s and <a href="ant">ant</a>s, known for their role in <a href="pollination">pollination</a> and, in the case of the best-known bee species, the <a href="Apis%20mellifera">European honey bee</a>, for producing <a href="honey">honey</a> and <a href="beeswax">beeswax</a>. Bees are a <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a> lineage within the superfamily <a href="Apoidea">Apoidea</a> and are presently considered a <a href="clade">clade</a>, called Anthophila. There are nearly 20,000 known species of bees in seven recognized <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">biological families</a>. They are found on every continent except <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, in every habitat on the planet that contains insect-pollinated <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a>s.

Some species including <a href="honey%20bee">honey bee</a>s, <a href="Bombus">bumble bees</a>, and <a href="stingless%20bee">stingless bee</a>s live <a href="eusociality">socially</a> in colonies. Bees are adapted for feeding on <a href="nectar%20%28plant%29">nectar</a> and <a href="pollen">pollen</a>, the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for <a href="protein">protein</a> and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for <a href="larva">larva</a>e. Bee <a href="pollination">pollination</a> is important both ecologically and <a href="List%20of%20crop%20plants%20pollinated%20by%20bees">commercially</a>; the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees.

Bees range in size from tiny <a href="stingless%20bee">stingless bee</a> species whose workers are less than long, to "<a href="Megachile%20pluto">Megachile pluto</a>", the largest species of <a href="leafcutter%20bee">leafcutter bee</a>, whose females can attain a length of . The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the <a href="Halictidae">Halictidae</a>, or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies. Vertebrate predators of bees include birds such as <a href="bee-eater">bee-eater</a>s; insect predators include <a href="beewolf">beewolves</a> and <a href="dragonfly">dragonflies</a>.

Human <a href="beekeeping">beekeeping</a> or apiculture has been practised for millennia, since at least the times of <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a>. Apart from honey and pollination, honey bees produce <a href="beeswax">beeswax</a>, <a href="royal%20jelly">royal jelly</a> and <a href="propolis">propolis</a>. Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature, from ancient times to the present day, though primarily focused in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, where beekeeping is far more common.

The ancestors of bees were <a href="wasp">wasp</a>s in the family <a href="Crabronidae">Crabronidae</a>, which were <a href="Predation">predators</a> of other insects. The switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the consumption of prey insects which were flower visitors and were partially covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae. This same <a href="evolution">evolution</a>ary scenario may have occurred within the <a href="vespoidea">vespoid</a> wasps, where the <a href="pollen%20wasp">pollen wasp</a>s evolved from predatory ancestors. Until recently, the oldest non-compression bee fossil had been found in New Jersey <a href="amber">amber</a>, "Cretotrigona prisca" of <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous age</a>, a <a href="Apinae">corbiculate bee</a>. A bee fossil from the <a href="early%20Cretaceous">early Cretaceous</a> (~100 mya), "<a href="Melittosphex%20burmensis">Melittosphex burmensis</a>", is considered ""an extinct lineage of pollen-collecting Apoidea <a href="Cladistics">sister</a> to the modern bees"". Derived features of its morphology (<a href="Synapomorphy">apomorphies</a>) place it clearly within the bees, but it retains two unmodified ancestral traits (<a href="Symplesiomorphy">plesiomorphies</a>) of the legs (two mid-tibial spurs, and a slender hind basitarsus), showing its transitional status. By the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> (~45 mya) there was already considerable diversity among eusocial bee lineages.

The highly <a href="eusocial">eusocial</a> <a href="Apinae">corbiculate Apidae</a> appeared roughly 87 Mya, and the <a href="Allodapini">Allodapini</a> (within the Apidae) around 53 Mya.
The <a href="Colletidae">Colletidae</a> appear as fossils only from the late <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> (~25 Mya) to early <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>.
The <a href="Melittidae">Melittidae</a> are known from "<a href="Palaeomacropis%20eocenicus">Palaeomacropis eocenicus</a>" in the <a href="Early%20Eocene">Early Eocene</a>.
The <a href="Megachilidae">Megachilidae</a> are known from trace fossils (characteristic leaf cuttings) from the <a href="Middle%20Eocene">Middle Eocene</a>.
The <a href="Andrenidae">Andrenidae</a> are known from the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, around 34 Mya, of the Florissant shale.
The <a href="Halictidae">Halictidae</a> first appear in the Early Eocene with species found in <a href="amber">amber</a>. The <a href="Stenotritidae">Stenotritidae</a> are known from fossil brood cells of <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> age.

The earliest animal-pollinated flowers were shallow, cup-shaped blooms <a href="pollination">pollinated</a> by insects such as <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s, so the syndrome of insect pollination was well established before the first appearance of bees. The novelty is that bees are <a href="specialization%20in%20bees">specialized</a> as pollination agents, with behavioral and physical modifications that specifically enhance pollination, and are the most efficient pollinating insects. In a process of <a href="coevolution">coevolution</a>, flowers developed floral rewards such as <a href="nectar">nectar</a> and longer tubes, and bees developed longer tongues to extract the nectar. Bees also developed structures known as <a href="scopa%20%28biology%29">scopal hairs</a> and <a href="pollen%20baskets">pollen baskets</a> to collect and carry pollen. The location and type differ among and between groups of bees. Most bees have <a href="scopa%20%28biology%29">scopal hairs</a> located on their hind legs or on the underside of their abdomens, some bees in the family Apidae possess <a href="pollen%20baskets">pollen baskets</a> on their hind legs while very few species lack these entirely and instead collect pollen in their crops. This drove the <a href="adaptive%20radiation">adaptive radiation</a> of the <a href="Flowering%20plant">angiosperms</a>, and, in turn, the bees themselves. Bees have not only coevolved with flowers but it is believed that some bees have coevolved with mites. Some bees provide tufts of hairs called acarinaria that appear to provide lodgings for mites; in return, it is believed that the mites eat fungi that attack pollen, so the relationship in this case may be <a href="mutualism%20%28biology%29">mutualistc</a>.

This cladogram is based on Debevic "et al", 2012, which used molecular phylogeny to demonstrate that the bees (<a href="Anthophila">Anthophila</a>) arose from deep within the Crabronidae, which is therefore <a href="paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a>. The placement of the <a href="Heterogynaidae">Heterogynaidae</a> is uncertain. The small subfamily <a href="Mellininae">Mellininae</a> was not included in their analysis.

This cladogram of the bee families is based on Hedtke et al., 2013, which places the former families Dasypodaidae and Meganomiidae as subfamilies inside the Melittidae.
English names, where available, are given in parentheses.

It is usually easy to recognise that a particular insect is a bee. They differ from closely related groups such as wasps by having branched or plume-like <a href="seta">seta</a>e (bristles), combs on the forelimbs for cleaning their antennae, small anatomical differences in the limb structure and the venation of the hind wings, and in females, by having the seventh dorsal abdominal plate divided into two half-plates.

Behaviourally, one of the most obvious characteristics of bees is that they collect pollen to provide provisions for their young, and have the necessary adaptations to do this. However, certain wasp species such as <a href="pollen%20wasp">pollen wasp</a>s have similar behaviours, and a few species of bee <a href="Scavenger">scavenge</a> from carcases to feed their offspring. The world's largest species of bee is thought to be the Indonesian resin bee "<a href="Megachile%20pluto">Megachile pluto</a>", whose females can attain a length of . The smallest species may be dwarf stingless bees in the tribe <a href="Meliponini">Meliponini</a> whose workers are less than in length.
A bee has a pair of large <a href="compound%20eyes">compound eyes</a> which cover much of the surface of the head. Between and above these are three small simple eyes (<a href="ocelli">ocelli</a>) which provide information for the bee on light intensity. The <a href="Antenna%20%28biology%29">antennae</a> usually have thirteen segments in males and twelve in females and are <a href="Insect%20morphology%23Antennae">geniculate</a>, having an elbow joint part way along. They house large numbers of sense organs that can detect touch (mechanoreceptors), smell and taste, and small, hairlike mechanoreceptors that can detect air movement so as to "hear" sounds. The <a href="insect%20mouthparts">mouthparts</a> are adapted for both chewing and sucking by having both a pair of <a href="Mandible%20%28insect%20mouthpart%29">mandibles</a> and a long <a href="proboscis">proboscis</a> for sucking up nectar.

The thorax has three segments, each with a pair of robust legs, and a pair of membranous wings on the hind two segments. The front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for cleaning the antennae, and in many species the hind legs bear pollen baskets, flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen. The wings are synchronised in flight and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing. The abdomen has nine segments, the hindermost three being modified into the sting.

According to <a href="inclusive%20fitness">inclusive fitness</a> theory, organisms can gain fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output, but also that of close relatives. In evolutionary terms, individuals should help relatives when "Cost < Relatedness * Benefit". The requirements for eusociality are more easily fulfilled by <a href="haplodiploid">haplodiploid</a> species such as bees because of their unusual relatedness structure.
In haplodiploid species, females develop from fertilized eggs and males from unfertilized eggs. Because a male is <a href="haploid">haploid</a> (has only one copy of each gene), his daughters (which are <a href="diploid">diploid</a>, with two copies of each gene) share 100% of his genes and 50% of their mother's. Therefore, they share 75% of their genes with each other. This mechanism of sex determination gives rise to what <a href="W.%20D.%20Hamilton">W. D. Hamilton</a> termed "supersisters", more closely related to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring. Workers often do not reproduce, but they can pass on more of their genes by helping to raise their sisters (as queens) than they would by having their own offspring (each of which would only have 50% of their genes), assuming they would produce similar numbers. This unusual situation has been proposed as an explanation of the multiple independent evolutions of eusociality (arising at least nine separate times) within the Hymenoptera.
However, some eusocial species such as <a href="termites">termites</a> are not haplodiploid. Conversely, all bees are haplodiploid but not all are eusocial, and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males, creating half-sisters that share only 25% of their genes. Haplodiploidy is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality. But, monogamy (queens mating singly) is the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated, so it is likely that haplodiploidy contributed to the evolution of eusociality in bees.

Bees may be solitary or may live in various types of communities. Sociality, of several different types, appears to have evolved independently many times within the bees. The most advanced of these are species with <a href="Eusociality">eusocial</a> colonies; these are characterised by having cooperative brood care and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive adults, plus overlapping generations. This division of labour creates specialized groups within eusocial societies which are called <a href="Eusociality%23In%20insects">castes</a>. In some species, groups of cohabiting females may be sisters, and if there is a <a href="division%20of%20labour">division of labour</a> within the group, they are considered <a href="semisocial">semisocial</a>. The group is called eusocial if, in addition, the group consists of a mother (the <a href="Queen%20bee">queen</a>) and her daughters (<a href="Worker%20bee">workers</a>). When the castes are purely behavioural alternatives, with no morphological differentiation other than size, the system is considered primitively eusocial, as in many <a href="paper%20wasp">paper wasp</a>s; when the castes are morphologically discrete, the system is considered highly eusocial.

The true honey bees (genus "<a href="Apis%20%28genus%29">Apis</a>", of which there are seven currently-recognized species) are highly eusocial, and are among the best known of all insects. Their colonies are established by <a href="Swarming%20%28honey%20bee%29">swarms</a>, consisting of a queen and several hundred workers. There are 29 subspecies of one of these species, "<a href="Apis%20mellifera">Apis mellifera</a>", native to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. <a href="Africanized%20bee">Africanized bee</a>s are a hybrid strain of "A. mellifera" that escaped from experiments involving crossing European and African subspecies; they are extremely defensive.

<a href="Stingless%20bee">Stingless bee</a>s are also highly <a href="eusocial">eusocial</a>. They practise <a href="mass%20provisioning">mass provisioning</a>, with complex nest architecture and perennial colonies also established via swarming.

Many <a href="bumblebee">bumblebee</a>s are eusocial, similar to the eusocial <a href="Vespidae">Vespidae</a> such as <a href="hornet">hornet</a>s in that the queen initiates a nest on her own rather than by swarming. Bumblebee colonies typically have from 50 to 200 bees at peak population, which occurs in mid to late summer. Nest architecture is simple, limited by the size of the pre-existing nest cavity, and colonies rarely last more than a year. In 2011, the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> set up the Bumblebee Specialist Group to review the threat status of all bumblebee species worldwide using the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> criteria.

There are many more species of primitively eusocial than highly eusocial bees, but they have been studied less often. Most are in the family <a href="Halictidae">Halictidae</a>, or "sweat bees". Colonies are typically small, with a dozen or fewer workers, on average. Queens and workers differ only in size, if at all. Most species have a single season colony cycle, even in the tropics, and only mated females hibernate. A few species have long active seasons and attain colony sizes in the hundreds, such as "<a href="Halictus%20hesperus">Halictus hesperus</a>". Some species are eusocial in parts of their range and solitary in others, or have a mix of eusocial and solitary nests in the same population. The <a href="orchid%20bee">orchid bee</a>s (Apidae) include some primitively eusocial species with similar biology. Some <a href="Allodapini">allodapine</a> bees (Apidae) form primitively eusocial colonies, with <a href="progressive%20provisioning">progressive provisioning</a>: a larva's food is supplied gradually as it develops, as is the case in honey bees and some bumblebees.

Most other bees, including familiar insects such as <a href="carpenter%20bee">carpenter bee</a>s, <a href="leafcutter%20bees">leafcutter bees</a> and <a href="mason%20bees">mason bees</a> are solitary in the sense that every female is fertile, and typically inhabits a nest she constructs herself. There is no division of labor so these nests lack queens and "worker" bees for these species. Solitary bees typically produce neither honey nor <a href="beeswax">beeswax</a>.

Solitary bees are important pollinators; they gather pollen to provision their nests with food for their brood. Often it is mixed with nectar to form a paste-like consistency. Some solitary bees have advanced types of pollen-carrying structures on their bodies. A very few species of solitary bees are being cultured for commercial pollination. Most of these species belong to a distinct set of <a href="genus">genera</a> which are commonly known by their nesting behavior or preferences, namely: carpenter bees, <a href="Halictidae">sweat bees</a>, mason bees, <a href="Colletes%20inaequalis">polyester bees</a>, <a href="squash%20bee">squash bee</a>s, <a href="Ceratina">dwarf carpenter bees</a>, leafcutter bees, <a href="alkali%20bee">alkali bee</a>s and <a href="Anthophorini">digger bees</a>.

Most solitary bees nest in the ground in a variety of soil textures and conditions while others create nests in hollow <a href="Phragmites">reeds</a> or twigs, holes in <a href="wood">wood</a>. The female typically creates a compartment (a "cell") with an egg and some provisions for the resulting larva, then seals it off. A nest may consist of numerous cells. When the nest is in wood, usually the last (those closer to the entrance) contain eggs that will become males. The adult does not provide care for the brood once the egg is laid, and usually dies after making one or more nests. The males typically emerge first and are ready for mating when the females emerge. Solitary bees are either stingless or very unlikely to sting (only in self-defense, if ever).

While solitary females each make individual nests, some species. such as the European mason bee "<a href="Hoplitis%20anthocopoides">Hoplitis anthocopoides</a>", and the <a href="Amegilla%20dawsoni">Dawson's Burrowing bee</a>, "Amegilla dawsoni," are gregarious, preferring to make nests near others of the same species, and giving the appearance of being social. Large groups of solitary bee nests are called "aggregations", to distinguish them from <a href="colony%20%28biology%29">colonies</a>. In some species, multiple females share a common nest, but each makes and provisions her own cells independently. This type of group is called "communal" and is not uncommon. The primary advantage appears to be that a nest entrance is easier to defend from predators and parasites when there are multiple females using that same entrance on a regular basis.

The life cycle of a bee, be it a solitary or social species, involves the laying of an egg, the development through several moults of a legless <a href="larva">larva</a>, a <a href="pupa">pupa</a>tion stage during which the insect undergoes <a href="Holometabolism">complete metamorphosis</a>, followed by the emergence of a winged adult. Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. The sex of a bee is determined by whether or not the egg is fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males. Tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no <a href="diapause">diapause</a> stage.
The egg is generally oblong, slightly curved and tapering at one end. In the case of solitary bees, each one is laid in a cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it. This may be rolled into a pellet or placed in a pile and is known as mass provisioning. In social species of bee there is progressive provisioning with the larva being fed regularly while it grows. The nest varies from a hole in the ground or in wood, in solitary bees, to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey bees.

The larvae are generally whitish grubs, roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends. They have fifteen segments and <a href="spiracle">spiracle</a>s in each segment for breathing. They have no legs but are able to move within the confines of the cell, helped by tubercles on their sides. They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing their food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a viscous liquid which solidifies into the silk they use to produce their cocoons. The pupa can be seen through the semi-transparent cocoon and over the course of a few days, the insect undergoes metamorphosis into the form of the adult bee. When ready to emerge, it splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the <a href="exuvia">exuvia</a>e as a winged adult and breaks out of the cell.

In <a href="Antoine%20Magnan">Antoine Magnan</a>'s 1934 book "Le vol des insectes", he wrote that he and <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Sainte-Lagu%C3%AB">André Sainte-Laguë</a> had applied the equations of <a href="air%20resistance">air resistance</a> to <a href="insect">insect</a>s and found that their flight could not be explained by fixed-wing calculations, but that "One shouldn't be surprised that the results of the calculations don't square with reality". This has led to a common misconception that bees "violate aerodynamic theory", but in fact it merely confirms that bees do not engage in fixed-wing flight, and that their flight is explained by other mechanics, such as those used by <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a>s. In 1996 it was shown that vortices created by many insects' wings helped to provide lift. High-speed <a href="cinematography">cinematography</a> and robotic mock-up of a bee wing showed that lift was generated by "the unconventional combination of short, choppy wing strokes, a rapid rotation of the wing as it flops over and reverses direction, and a very fast wing-beat frequency". Wing-beat frequency normally increases as size decreases, but as the bee's wing beat covers such a small <a href="arc%20%28geometry%29">arc</a>, it flaps approximately 230 times per second, faster than a <a href="Drosophilidae">fruitfly</a> (200 times per second) which is 80 times smaller.

The ethologist <a href="Karl%20von%20Frisch">Karl von Frisch</a> studied <a href="animal%20navigation">navigation</a> in the honey bee. He showed that honey bees communicate by the <a href="waggle%20dance">waggle dance</a>, in which a worker indicates the location of a food source to other workers in the hive. He demonstrated that bees can recognize a desired compass direction in three different ways: by the sun, by the <a href="Polarization%20%28waves%29">polarization</a> pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth’s magnetic field. He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark <a href="beehive">beehive</a>. Bees navigate using spatial memory with a "rich, map-like organization".

Most bees are polylectic (generalist) meaning they collect pollen from a range of flowering plants, however, some are <a href="oligolege">oligolege</a>s (specialists), in that they only gather pollen from one or a few species or genera of closely related plants. Specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen, and male orchid bees, which gather aromatic compounds from <a href="orchid">orchid</a>s (one of the few cases where male bees are effective pollinators). Bees are able to sense the presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers, floral odors, and even electromagnetic fields. Once landed, a bee then uses nectar quality and pollen taste to determine whether to continue visiting similar flowers.

In rare cases, a <a href="plant">plant</a> species may only be effectively pollinated by a single bee species, and some plants are <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a> at least in part because their pollinator is also threatened. There is, however, a pronounced tendency for oligolectic bees to be associated with common, widespread plants which are visited by multiple pollinators. There are some forty oligoleges associated with the <a href="Larrea%20tridentata">creosote bush</a> in the arid parts of the United States southwest, for example.

Many bees are <a href="aposematic">aposematic</a>ally coloured, typically orange and black, warning of their ability to defend themselves with a powerful sting. As such they are models for <a href="Batesian%20mimicry">Batesian mimicry</a> by non-stinging insects such as <a href="bee-flies">bee-flies</a>, <a href="robber%20flies">robber flies</a> and <a href="hoverflies">hoverflies</a>, all of which gain a measure of protection by superficially looking and behaving like bees.

Bees are themselves <a href="M%C3%BCllerian%20mimicry">Müllerian mimics</a> of other aposematic insects with the same colour scheme, including <a href="wasp">wasp</a>s, <a href="Lycidae">lycid</a> and other beetles, and many butterflies and moths (<a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a>) which are themselves distasteful, often through acquiring bitter and poisonous chemicals from their plant food. All the Müllerian mimics, including bees, benefit from the reduced risk of predation that results from their easily recognised warning coloration.

Bees are also mimicked by plants such as the <a href="Ophrys%20apifera">bee orchid</a> which imitates both the appearance and the scent of a female bee; male bees attempt to mate (<a href="pseudocopulation">pseudocopulation</a>) with the furry lip of the flower, thus pollinating it.

<a href="Brood%20parasite">Brood parasite</a>s occur in several bee families including the <a href="apidae">apid</a> subfamily <a href="Nomadinae">Nomadinae</a>. Females of these bees lack pollen collecting structures (the <a href="scopa%20%28biology%29">scopa</a>) and do not construct their own nests. They typically enter the nests of pollen collecting species, and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by the host bee. When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes the host larva's pollen ball, and often the host egg also. The Arctic bee species, "<a href="Bombus%20hyperboreus">Bombus hyperboreus</a>," in particular are an aggressive species that attack and enslave other bees of the same subgenus. However, unlike many other bee brood parasites, they have pollen baskets and often collect pollen.

In the south of Africa, hives of African honeybees ("A. mellifera scutellata") are being destroyed by parasitic workers of the Cape honeybee, "A. m. capensis". These lay <a href="diploid">diploid</a> eggs ("<a href="thelytoky">thelytoky</a>"), escaping normal <a href="worker%20policing">worker policing</a>, leading to the colony's destruction; the parasites can then move to other hives.

The <a href="cuckoo%20bee">cuckoo bee</a>s in the "<a href="List%20of%20bumblebee%20species">Bombus</a>" subgenus "Psithyrus" are closely related to, and resemble, their hosts in looks and size. This common pattern gave rise to the ecological principle "<a href="Emery%27s%20rule">Emery's rule</a>". Others parasitize bees in different families, like "<a href="Townsendiella">Townsendiella</a>", a <a href="nomadinae">nomadine</a> <a href="apidae">apid</a>, two species of which are cleptoparasites of the <a href="Dasypodaidae">dasypodaid</a> genus "<a href="Hesperapis">Hesperapis</a>", while the other species in the same genus attacks <a href="halictidae">halictid</a> bees.

Four bee families (<a href="Andrenidae">Andrenidae</a>, <a href="Colletidae">Colletidae</a>, <a href="Halictidae">Halictidae</a>, and <a href="Apidae">Apidae</a>) contain some species that are <a href="crepuscular">crepuscular</a>. Most are tropical or subtropical, but there are some which live in arid regions at higher latitudes. These bees have greatly enlarged <a href="ocellus">ocelli</a>, which are extremely sensitive to light and dark, though incapable of forming images. Some have refracting superposition compound eyes: these combine the output of many elements of their compound eyes to provide enough light for each retinal photoreceptor. Their ability to fly by night enables them to avoid many predators, and to exploit flowers that produce nectar only or also at night.

Vertebrate predators of bees include <a href="bee-eater">bee-eater</a>s, <a href="shrikes">shrikes</a> and <a href="Old%20World%20flycatcher">flycatcher</a>s, which make short sallies to catch insects in flight. Swifts and swallows fly almost continually, catching insects as they go. The <a href="Pernis%20%28bird%29">honey buzzard</a> attacks bees' nests and eats the larvae. The <a href="greater%20honeyguide">greater honeyguide</a> interacts with humans by guiding them to the nests of wild bees. The humans break open the nests and take the honey and the bird feeds on the larvae and the wax. Among mammals, predators such as the <a href="badger">badger</a> dig up bumblebee nests and eat both the larvae and any stored food.
Specialist ambush predators of visitors to flowers include <a href="crab%20spiders">crab spiders</a>, which wait on flowering plants for pollinating insects; <a href="Hemiptera">predatory bugs</a>, and <a href="praying%20mantis">praying mantis</a>es, some of which (the <a href="flower%20mantis">flower mantis</a>es of the tropics) wait motionless, <a href="aggressive%20mimicry">aggressive mimics</a> camouflaged as flowers. <a href="Beewolf">Beewolves</a> are large wasps that habitually attack bees; the <a href="ethologist">ethologist</a> <a href="Niko%20Tinbergen">Niko Tinbergen</a> estimated that a single colony of the beewolf "<a href="Philanthus%20triangulum">Philanthus triangulum</a>" might kill several thousand honeybees in a day: all the prey he observed were honeybees. Other predatory insects that sometimes catch bees include <a href="robber%20flies">robber flies</a> and <a href="dragonfly">dragonflies</a>.

Honey bees are affected by parasites including <a href="acari">acari</a>ne and "<a href="Varroa">Varroa</a>" <a href="mite">mite</a>s. However, some bees are believed to have a mutualistic relationship with mites.

Three bee maidens with the power of <a href="divination">divination</a> and thus speaking truth are described in <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "Hymn to Hermes", and the food of the gods is "identified as honey"; the bee maidens were originally associated with <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>, and are probably not correctly identified with the <a href="Thriae">Thriae</a>. Honey, according to a Greek myth, was discovered by a nymph called Melissa ("Bee"); and honey was offered to the Greek gods from <a href="Helladic%20period">Mycenean times</a>. Bees were associated, too, with the <a href="Delphic%20oracle">Delphic oracle</a> and the prophetess was sometimes called a bee.

The image of a community of honey bees has been used from ancient to modern times, in <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and <a href="Plato">Plato</a>; in <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a> and <a href="Seneca%20the%20Younger">Seneca</a>; in <a href="Erasmus">Erasmus</a> and <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>; <a href="Tolstoy">Tolstoy</a>, and by political and social theorists such as <a href="Bernard%20Mandeville">Bernard Mandeville</a> and <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> as a model for human <a href="society">society</a>. In English folklore, bees would be told of important events in the household, in a custom known as "<a href="Telling%20the%20bees">Telling the bees</a>".

The oldest examples of bees in art are <a href="Cave%20painting">rock paintings</a> in <a href="Spain">Spain</a> which have been dated to 15,000 BC.

<a href="W.%20B.%20Yeats">W. B. Yeats</a>'s poem "<a href="The%20Lake%20Isle%20of%20Innisfree">The Lake Isle of Innisfree</a>" (1888) contains the couplet "Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee, / And live alone in the bee loud glade." At the time he was living in <a href="Bedford%20Park%2C%20London">Bedford Park</a> in the West of London.
<a href="Beatrix%20Potter">Beatrix Potter</a>'s illustrated book "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Mrs%20Tittlemouse">The Tale of Mrs Tittlemouse</a>" (1910) features Babbity Bumble and her brood "(pictured)".

<a href="Kit%20Williams">Kit Williams</a>' <a href="Treasure%20hunt%20%28game%29">treasure hunt</a> book "<a href="The%20Bee%20on%20the%20Comb">The Bee on the Comb</a>" (1984) uses bees and beekeeping as part of its story and puzzle.

<a href="Sue%20Monk%20Kidd">Sue Monk Kidd</a>'s "<a href="The%20Secret%20Life%20of%20Bees%20%28novel%29">The Secret Life of Bees</a>" (2004), and the <a href="The%20Secret%20Life%20of%20Bees%20%28film%29">2009 film</a> starring <a href="Dakota%20Fanning">Dakota Fanning</a>, tells the story of a girl who escapes her abusive home and finds her way to live with a family of beekeepers, the Boatwrights.

The humorous 2007 animated film "<a href="Bee%20Movie">Bee Movie</a>" used <a href="Jerry%20Seinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a>'s first script and was his first work for children; he starred as a bee named Barry B. Benson, alongside <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Zellweger">Renée Zellweger</a>. Critics found its premise awkward and its delivery tame.

<a href="Dave%20Goulson">Dave Goulson</a>'s "<a href="A%20Sting%20in%20the%20Tale">A Sting in the Tale</a>" (2014) describes his efforts to save bumblebees in Britain, as well as much about their biology.

The playwright Laline Paull's <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> "The Bees" (2015) tells the tale of a hive bee named Flora 717 from hatching onwards.

Humans have kept <a href="honey%20bee">honey bee</a> colonies, commonly in <a href="beehive">hives</a>, for millennia. <a href="Beekeeper">Beekeeper</a>s collect <a href="honey">honey</a>, <a href="beeswax">beeswax</a>, <a href="propolis">propolis</a>, <a href="pollen">pollen</a>, and <a href="royal%20jelly">royal jelly</a> from hives; bees are also kept to <a href="pollination">pollinate</a> crops and to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers.

Depictions of humans collecting honey from wild bees date to 15,000 years ago; efforts to domesticate them are shown in Egyptian art around 4,500 years ago. Simple hives and smoke were used; jars of honey were found in the tombs of <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>s such as <a href="Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a>. From the 18th century, European understanding of the colonies and biology of bees allowed the construction of the moveable comb hive so that honey could be harvested without destroying the colony. Among Classical Era authors, beekeeping with the use of smoke is described in the "<a href="History%20of%20Animals">History of Animals</a>" Book 9 (a book not written by <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> himself). The account mentions that bees die after stinging; that workers remove corpses from the hive, and guard it; castes including workers and non-working drones, but "kings" rather than queens; predators including toads and bee-eaters; and the <a href="waggle%20dance">waggle dance</a>, with the "irresistible suggestion" of άpοσειονται (aroseiontai, it waggles) and παρακολουθούσιν (parakolouthousin, they watch).

Beekeeping is described in detail by <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a> in his "<a href="Eclogues">Eclogues</a>"; it is also mentioned in his "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>", and in Pliny's "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Natural History</a>".

Bees play an important role in <a href="pollination">pollinating</a> <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a>s, and are the major type of <a href="pollinator">pollinator</a> in many <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s that contain flowering plants. It is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on <a href="pollination">pollination</a> by insects, birds and bats, most of which is accomplished by bees, whether wild or domesticated.

<a href="pollination%20management">Contract pollination</a> has overtaken the role of honey production for <a href="beekeeper">beekeeper</a>s in many countries. From 1972 to 2006, <a href="feral">feral</a> honey bees declined dramatically in the US, and they are now almost absent. The number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly, through <a href="urbanization">urbanization</a>, systematic pesticide use, <a href="Acarapis%20woodi">tracheal</a> and "<a href="Varroa">Varroa</a>" mites, and the closure of beekeeping businesses. In 2006 and 2007 the rate of attrition increased, and was described as <a href="colony%20collapse%20disorder">colony collapse disorder</a>. In 2010 invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus "<a href="Nosema%20ceranae">Nosema ceranae</a>" were shown to be in every killed colony, and deadly in combination. Winter losses increased to about 1/3. "Varroa" mites were thought to be responsible for about half the losses.

Apart from colony collapse disorder, losses outside the US have been attributed to causes including pesticide seed dressings, such as <a href="Clothianidin">Clothianidin</a>, <a href="Imidacloprid">Imidacloprid</a> and <a href="Thiamethoxam">Thiamethoxam</a>. From 2013 the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> restricted some pesticides to stop bee populations from declining further. In 2014 the <a href="Intergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> report warned that bees faced increased risk of extinction because of <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a>.

However farmers have focused on alternative solutions in order to mitigate these problems. By raising native plants, they provide food for native bee pollinators like "<a href="Lasioglossum%20vierecki">L. vierecki</a>" and "<a href="Lasioglossum%20leucozonium">L. leucozonium</a>", leading to less reliance on honey bee populations.

Honey is a natural product produced by bees and stored for their own use, but its sweetness has always appealed to humans. Before domestication of bees was even attempted, humans were raiding their nests for their honey. Smoke was often used to subdue the bees and such activities are depicted in <a href="Cave%20painting">rock paintings</a> in Spain which have been dated to 15,000 BC. Indigenous people in many countries eat insects, including consuming the larvae and pupae of bees, mostly stingless bees. They also gather "bee brood" (the larvae, pupae and surrounding cells) for consumption. In the <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>n dish "<a href="botok">botok tawon</a>" from Central and East <a href="Java">Java</a>, bee larvae are eaten as a companion to <a href="rice">rice</a>, after being mixed with shredded <a href="coconut">coconut</a>, wrapped in <a href="banana">banana</a> leaves, and steamed.

Honey bees are used commercially to produce <a href="honey">honey</a>. They also produce some substances used as dietary supplements with possible health benefits, <a href="pollen">pollen</a>, <a href="propolis">propolis</a>, and <a href="royal%20jelly">royal jelly</a>, though all of these can also cause <a href="allergy">allergic reactions</a>.

The painful stings of bees are mostly associated with the poison gland and the <a href="Dufour%27s%20gland">Dufour's gland</a> which are abdominal exocrine glands containing various chemicals. In "<a href="Lasioglossum%20leucozonium">Lasioglossum leucozonium</a>", the Dufour's Gland mostly contains octadecanolide as well as some eicosanolide. There is also evidence of n-triscosane, n-<a href="heptacosane">heptacosane</a>, and 22-docosanolide. However, the secretions of these glands could also be used for nest construction.

Basques

The Basques ( or ; ; ; ) are an indigenous ethnic group characterised by the <a href="Basque%20language">Basque language</a>, a common culture and shared <a href="ancestry">ancestry</a> to the ancient <a href="Vascones">Vascones</a> and <a href="Aquitanians">Aquitanians</a>. Basques are indigenous to and primarily inhabit an area traditionally known as the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29">Basque Country</a> (), a region that is located around the western end of the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> on the coast of the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a> and straddles parts of north-central <a href="Spain">Spain</a> and south-western <a href="France">France</a>.

The English word "Basque" may be pronounced or and derives from the French "Basque" (), which is derived from <a href="Gascon%20language">Gascon</a> "Basco" (pronounced ), cognate with Spanish "Vasco "(pronounced ). These, in turn, come from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "Vasco" (pronounced ), plural "<a href="Vascones">Vascones</a>" (see History section below). The Latin <a href="labial-velar%20approximant">labial-velar approximant</a> /w/ generally <a href="betacism">evolved into</a> the <a href="bilabial">bilabial</a>s /b/ and /β̞/ in Gascon and Spanish, probably under the influence of Basque and <a href="Aquitanian%20language">Aquitanian</a>, a language related to old Basque and spoken in <a href="Gascony">Gascony</a> in <a href="Classical%20antiquity">Antiquity</a> (similarly the Latin /w/ evolved into /v/ in <a href="French%20language">French</a>, <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a> and other languages).

Several coins from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC found in the Basque Country bear the inscription "barscunes". The place where they were minted is not certain, but is thought to be somewhere near <a href="Pamplona">Pamplona</a>, in the heartland of the area that historians believe was inhabited by the "Vascones". Some scholars have suggested a Celtic etymology based on "bhar-s-", meaning "summit", "point" or "leaves", according to which "barscunes" may have meant "the mountain people", "the tall ones" or "the proud ones", while others have posited a relationship to a <a href="proto-Indo-European%20language">proto-Indo-European</a> root "*bar-" meaning "border", "frontier", "march".

In Basque, the people call themselve the "euskaldunak", singular "euskaldun", formed from "euskal-" (i.e. "Basque (language)") and "-dun" (i.e. "one who has"); "euskaldun" literally means a Basque speaker. Not all Basques are Basque-speakers. Therefore, the <a href="neologism">neologism</a> "euskotar", plural "euskotarrak", was coined in the 19th century to mean a culturally Basque person, whether Basque-speaking or not.

Alfonso Irigoyen posits that the word "euskara" is derived from an ancient Basque verb "enautsi" "to say" (cf. modern Basque "esan") and the suffix "-(k)ara" ("way (of doing something)"). Thus "euskara" would literally mean "way of saying", "way of speaking". One item of evidence in favour of this hypothesis is found in the Spanish book "Compendio Historial", written in 1571 by the Basque writer <a href="Esteban%20de%20Garibay">Esteban de Garibay</a>. He records the name of the Basque language as "enusquera". It may, however, be a writing mistake.

In the 19th century, the Basque nationalist activist <a href="Sabino%20Arana">Sabino Arana</a> posited an original root "euzko" which, he thought, came from "eguzkiko" ("of the sun", related to the assumption of an original <a href="Solar%20deity">solar religion</a>). On the basis of this putative root, Arana proposed the name <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29">Euzkadi</a> for an independent Basque nation, composed of seven Basque historical territories. Arana's neologism "Euzkadi" (in the regularized spelling Euskadi) is still widely used in both Basque and Spanish, since it is now the official name of the <a href="Autonomous%20Community">Autonomous Community</a> of the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque Country</a>.

Since the Basque language is unrelated to Indo-European, it has long been thought to represent the people or culture that occupied Europe before the spread of Indo-European languages there. A comprehensive analysis of Basque genetic patterns has shown that Basque genetic uniqueness predates the <a href="Neolithic%20Revolution">arrival of agriculture</a> in the Iberian Peninsula, about 7,000 years ago.

It is thought that Basques are a remnant of the early inhabitants of Western Europe, specifically those of the <a href="Franco-Cantabrian%20region">Franco-Cantabrian region</a>. Basque tribes were already mentioned in Roman times by Strabo and Pliny, including the <a href="Vascones">Vascones</a>, <a href="Novempopulania">the Aquitani</a>, and others. There is enough evidence to support the hypothesis that at that time and later they spoke old varieties of the Basque language (see: <a href="Aquitanian%20language">Aquitanian language</a>).

In the Early Middle Ages the territory between the <a href="Ebro">Ebro</a> and <a href="Garonne">Garonne</a> rivers was known as <a href="Duchy%20of%20Vasconia">Vasconia</a>, a vaguely defined cultural area and political entity struggling to fend off pressure from the Iberian <a href="Visigoths">Visigothic</a> kingdom and Muslim rule to the south, as well as the <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> push from the north. By the turn of the first millennium, the territory of <a href="Gascony">Vasconia</a> had fragmented into different feudal regions, such as <a href="Soule">Soule</a> and <a href="Labourd">Labourd</a>, while south of the Pyrenees the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Castile</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Pamplona">Pamplona</a> and the Pyrenean counties of <a href="County%20of%20Aragon">Aragon</a>, <a href="Sobrarbe">Sobrarbe</a>, <a href="Ribagorza">Ribagorza</a> (later <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Aragon">Kingdom of Aragon</a>), and <a href="County%20of%20Pallars">Pallars</a> emerged as the main regional entities with Basque population in the 9th and 10th centuries.

The Kingdom of Pamplona, a central Basque realm, later known as <a href="Navarre">Navarre</a>, underwent a process of feudalization and was subjected to the influence of its much larger Aragonese, Castilian and French neighbours. Castile deprived Navarre of its coastline by conquering <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">key western territories</a> (1199–1201), leaving the kingdom landlocked. The Basques were ravaged by the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Bands">War of the Bands</a>, bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. Weakened by the Navarrese civil war, the <a href="Spanish%20conquest%20of%20Iberian%20Navarre">bulk of the realm eventually fell</a> before the onslaught of the Spanish armies (1512–1524). However, <a href="Lower%20Navarre">the Navarrese territory north of the Pyrenees</a> remained beyond the reach of an increasingly powerful Spain. <a href="Lower%20Navarre">Lower Navarre</a> became a province of France in 1620.

Nevertheless, the Basques enjoyed a great deal of self-government <a href="End%20of%20Basque%20home%20rule%20in%20France">until the French Revolution (1790)</a> and the <a href="Carlist%20Wars">Carlist Wars</a> (1839/1876), when the Basques supported heir apparent <a href="Infante%20Carlos%20of%20Spain%2C%20Count%20of%20Molina">Carlos V</a> and his descendants. On either side of the Pyrenees, the Basques <a href="End%20of%20Basque%20home%20rule%20in%20Spain">lost their native institutions and laws</a> held during the "<a href="Ancien%20r%C3%A9gime">Ancien régime</a>".

Since then, despite the current limited self-governing status of the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque Autonomous Community</a> and Navarre as settled by the Spanish Constitution, many Basques have attempted higher degrees of self-empowerment (see <a href="Basque%20nationalism">Basque nationalism</a>), sometimes by acts of violence. <a href="Labourd">Labourd</a>, <a href="Lower%20Navarre">Lower Navarre</a>, and <a href="Soule">Soule</a> were integrated into the <a href="Departments%20of%20France">French department system</a> (starting 1790), with Basque efforts to establish a region-specific political-administrative entity failing to take off to date.

The Basque region is divided into at least three administrative units, namely the <a href="Basque%20Autonomous%20Community">Basque Autonomous Community</a> and <a href="Navarre">Navarre</a> in Spain, and the <a href="Arrondissements%20of%20France">arrondissement</a> of <a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a> and the <a href="cantons%20of%20France">cantons</a> of <a href="Maul%C3%A9on-Licharre">Mauléon-Licharre</a> and <a href="Tardets-Sorholus">Tardets-Sorholus</a> in the "<a href="d%C3%A9partement">département</a>" of <a href="Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es%20Atlantiques">Pyrénées Atlantiques</a>, France.

The autonomous community (a concept established in the <a href="Spanish%20Constitution%20of%201978">Spanish Constitution of 1978</a>) known as "Euskal Autonomia Erkidegoa" or EAE in Basque and as "Comunidad Autónoma Vasca" or CAV in Spanish (in English: "Basque Autonomous Community" or BAC), is made up of the three Spanish provinces of <a href="%C3%81lava">Álava</a>, <a href="Biscay">Biscay</a> and <a href="Gipuzkoa">Gipuzkoa</a>. The corresponding Basque names of these territories are "Araba", "Bizkaia" and "Gipuzkoa", and their Spanish names are "Álava", "Vizcaya" and "Guipúzcoa".

The BAC only includes three of the seven provinces of the currently called historical territories. It is sometimes referred to simply as "the Basque Country" (or "Euskadi") by writers and public agencies only considering those three western provinces, but also on occasions merely as a convenient abbreviation when this does not lead to confusion in the context. Others reject this usage as inaccurate and are careful to specify the BAC (or an equivalent expression such as "the three provinces", up to 1978 referred to as "Provincias Vascongadas" in Spanish) when referring to this entity or region. Likewise, terms such as "the Basque Government" for "the government of the BAC" are commonly though not universally employed. In particular in common usage the French term "Pays Basque" ("Basque Country"), in the absence of further qualification, refers either to the whole <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29">Basque Country</a> ("Euskal Herria" in Basque), or not infrequently to the <a href="Northern%20Basque%20Country">northern (or "French") Basque Country</a> specifically.

Under Spain's present constitution, Navarre ("Nafarroa" in present-day Basque, "Navarra" historically in Spanish) constitutes a separate entity, called in present-day Basque "Nafarroako Foru Erkidegoa", in Spanish "Comunidad Foral de Navarra" (the autonomous community of Navarre). The government of this autonomous community is the Government of Navarre. Note that in historical contexts Navarre may refer to a wider area, and that the present-day northern Basque province of <a href="Lower%20Navarre">Lower Navarre</a> may also be referred to as (part of) "Nafarroa", while the term "High Navarre" ("Nafarroa Garaia" in Basque, "Alta Navarra" in Spanish) is also encountered as a way of referring to the territory of the present-day autonomous community.

There are three other historic provinces parts of the Basque Country: <a href="Labourd">Labourd</a>, <a href="Lower%20Navarre">Lower Navarre</a> and <a href="Soule">Soule</a> ("Lapurdi, Nafarroa Beherea" and "Zuberoa" in Basque; "Labourd, Basse-Navarre" and "Soule" in French), devoid of official status within France's present-day political and administrative territorial organization, and only minor political support to the Basque nationalists. A large number of regional and local nationalist and non-nationalist representatives have waged a campaign for years advocating for the creation of a separate Basque <a href="d%C3%A9partement">département</a>, while these demands have gone unheard by the French administration.

There are 2,123,000 people living in the Basque Autonomous Community (279,000 in Alava, 1,160,000 in Biscay and 684,000 in Gipuzkoa). The most important cities in this region, which serve as the provinces' administrative centers, are <a href="Bilbao">Bilbao</a> (in Biscay), <a href="San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n">San Sebastián</a> (in Gipuzkoa) and <a href="Vitoria-Gasteiz">Vitoria-Gasteiz</a> (in Álava). The official languages are Basque and Spanish. Knowledge of Spanish is compulsory under the Spanish constitution (article no. 3), and knowledge and usage of Basque is a right under the Statute of Autonomy (article no. 6), so only knowledge of Spanish is virtually universal. Knowledge of Basque, after declining for many years during <a href="Spain%20under%20Franco">Franco's dictatorship</a> owing to official persecution, is again on the rise due to favourable official language policies and popular support. Currently about 33 percent of the population in the Basque Autonomous Community speaks Basque.

Navarre has a population of 601,000; its administrative capital and main city, also regarded by many nationalist Basques as the Basques' historical capital, is Pamplona ("Iruñea" in modern Basque). Only Spanish is an official language of Navarre, and the Basque language is only co-official in the province's northern region, where most Basque-speaking Navarrese are concentrated.

About a quarter of a million people live in the <a href="French%20Basque%20Country">French Basque Country</a>. Nowadays Basque-speakers refer to this region as "Iparralde" (Basque for North), and to the Spanish provinces as "Hegoalde" (South). Much of this population lives in or near the Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz (BAB) urban belt on the coast (in Basque these are "Baiona", "Angelu" and "Miarritze"). The Basque language, which was traditionally spoken by most of the region's population outside the BAB urban zone, is today rapidly losing ground to French. The French Basque Country's lack of self-government within the French state is coupled with the absence of official status for the Basque language in the region. Attempts to introduce bilingualism in local administration have so far met direct refusal from French officials.

Large numbers of Basques have left the Basque Country to settle in the rest of Spain, France or other parts of the world in different historical periods, often for economic or political reasons. Historically the Basques abroad were often employed in shepherding and ranching and by maritime fisheries and merchants. Millions of Basque descendants (see <a href="Basque%20American">Basque American</a> and <a href="Basque%20Canadian">Basque Canadian</a>) live in North America (the United States; Canada, mainly in the provinces of <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a> and <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>), Latin America (in all 23 countries), South Africa, and Australia.

<a href="Miguel%20de%20Unamuno">Miguel de Unamuno</a> said: "There are at least two things that clearly can be attributed to Basques: the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Society of Jesus</a> and the <a href="Republic%20of%20Chile">Republic of Chile</a>." Chilean historian Luis Thayer Ojeda estimated that 45 percent of immigrants to Chile in the 17th and 18th centuries were Basque. Over 2.5 million <a href="Basque%20Chilean">Basque descendants</a> live in <a href="Chile">Chile</a>; the Basque have been a major influence in the country's <a href="cultural">cultural</a> and <a href="economic">economic</a> development.

Basque place names are to be found, such as New Biscay, now <a href="Durango">Durango</a> (Mexico), <a href="Biscayne%20Bay">Biscayne Bay</a>, <a href="Sacatepequez%2C%20Antigua%20Guatemala">Sacatepequez, Antigua Guatemala</a> and <a href="Jalapa%2C%20Jalapa">Jalapa, Jalapa</a> (Guatemala), Aguerreberry or Aguereberry Point in the United States, and the "<a href="Nuevo%20Santander">Nuevo Santander</a>" region of Mexico. <a href="Nueva%20Vizcaya%2C%20New%20Spain">Nueva Vizcaya</a> was the first province in the north of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (Mexico) to be explored and settled by the Spanish. It consisted mostly of the area which is today the states of Chihuahua and Durango.

In Mexico most Basques are concentrated in the cities of <a href="Monterrey">Monterrey</a>, <a href="Saltillo">Saltillo</a>, <a href="Reynosa">Reynosa</a>, <a href="Camargo%2C%20Chihuahua">Camargo</a>, and the states of <a href="Jalisco">Jalisco</a>, <a href="Durango">Durango</a>, <a href="Nuevo%20Le%C3%B3n">Nuevo León</a>, <a href="Tamaulipas">Tamaulipas</a>, and <a href="Coahuila">Coahuila</a>. The Basques were important in the mining industry; many were ranchers and vaqueros (<a href="cowboy">cowboy</a>s), and the rest opened small shops in major cities such as <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>, <a href="Guadalajara%2C%20Mexico">Guadalajara</a> and <a href="Puebla">Puebla</a>. In <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, most Basques have been concentrated in <a href="Sacatepequez%20Department">Sacatepequez Department</a>, <a href="Antigua%20Guatemala">Antigua Guatemala</a>, <a href="Jalapa%20Department">Jalapa</a> for six generations now, while some have migrated to <a href="Guatemala%20City">Guatemala City</a>.

In Colombia, Basques settled mainly in <a href="Antioquia">Antioquia</a> and the <a href="Colombian%20coffee%20growing%20axis">Coffee Axis</a>. It is estimated that nearly 2,500,000 persons from all Antioquia (40% of this <a href="Departments%20of%20Colombia">department</a>) have Basque ancestry, as well, in the 19th century about 10% of Colombia's total population were Basque descendants. Antioquia has one of the biggest concentrations of Basques descendants around the world. In 1955, Joaquín Ospina said: "Is there something more similar to the Basque people than the ""antioqueños"". Also, writer Arturo Escobar Uribe said in his book ""Mitos de Antioquia"" (Myths of Antioquia) (1950): "Antioquia, which in its clean ascendance predominates the peninsular farmer of the Basque provinces, inherited the virtues of its ancestors... Despite the predominance of the white race, its extension in the mountains... has projected over Colombia's map the prototype of its race; in <a href="Medell%C3%ADn">Medellín</a> with the industrial <a href="Paisa%20region">paisa</a>, entrepreneur, strong and steady... in its towns, the adventurer, arrogant, world-explorer... Its myths, which are an evidence of their deep credulity and an indubitable proof of their Iberian ancestor, are the sequel of the conqueror's blood which runs through their veins...". <a href="Bambuco">Bambuco</a>, a Colombian folk music, has Basque roots.

The largest of several important Basque communities in the United States is in the area around <a href="Boise%2C%20Idaho">Boise, Idaho</a>, home to the Basque Museum and Cultural Center, host to an annual Basque festival, as well as a festival for the Basque diaspora every five years. <a href="Reno%2C%20Nevada">Reno, Nevada</a>, where the Center for Basque Studies and the Basque Studies Library are located at the <a href="University%20of%20Nevada%2C%20Reno">University of Nevada</a>, is another significant nucleus of Basque population. <a href="Elko%2C%20Nevada">Elko, Nevada</a> sponsors an annual Basque festival that celebrates the dance, cuisine and cultures of the Basque peoples of Spanish, French and Mexican nationalities who have arrived in <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> since the late 19th century.

<a href="Texas">Texas</a> has a large percentage of Hispanics descended from Basques who participated in the conquest of <a href="New%20Spain">New Spain</a>. Many of the original <a href="Tejano">Tejano</a>s had Basque blood, including those who fought in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Alamo">Battle of the Alamo</a> alongside many of the other Texans. Along the Mexican/Texan border, many Basque surnames can be found. The largest concentration of Basques who settled on Mexico's north-eastern "frontera", including the states of <a href="Chihuahua%20%28state%29">Chihuahua</a>, <a href="Durango">Durango</a>, <a href="Coahuila">Coahuila</a>, <a href="Nuevo%20Le%C3%B3n">Nuevo León</a>, and <a href="Tamaulipas">Tamaulipas</a>, also settled along Texas' <a href="Rio%20Grande%20River">Rio Grande River</a> from <a href="South%20Texas">South Texas</a> to <a href="West%20Texas">West Texas</a>. Many of the historic "hidalgos", or noble families from this area, had gained their titles and land grants from Spain and Mexico; they still value their land. Some of North America's largest ranches, which were founded under these colonial land grants, can be found in this region.

<a href="California">California</a> has a major concentration of Basques, most notably in the <a href="San%20Joaquin%20Valley">San Joaquin Valley</a> between <a href="Stockton%2C%20California">Stockton</a>, <a href="Fresno%2C%20California">Fresno</a> and <a href="Bakersfield%2C%20California">Bakersfield</a>. The city of Bakersfield has a large Basque community and the city has several Basque restaurants, including Noriega's which won the 2011 James Beard Foundation America's Classic Award. There is a history of Basque culture in <a href="Chino%2C%20California">Chino, California</a>. In Chino, two annual Basque festivals celebrate the dance, cuisine, and culture of the peoples. The surrounding area of <a href="San%20Bernardino%20County%2C%20California">San Bernardino County</a> has many Basque descendants as residents. They are mostly descendants of settlers from Spain and Mexico. These Basques in California are grouped in the group known as "<a href="Californio">Californio</a>s".

Basques of European Spanish-French and Latin American nationalities also settled throughout the western U.S. in states like <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>, <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, and <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>.

The identifying language of the Basques is called Basque or "Euskara", spoken today by 25%-30% of the region's population. An idea of the central place of the cultural terms in Basque nationalist politicians is given by the fact that, in Basque, Basques identify themselves by the term "euskaldun" and their country as "Euskal Herria", literally "Basque speaker" and "Country of the Basque Language" respectively. The language has been made a political issue by official Spanish and French policies restricting its use either historically or currently; however, this has not stopped the teaching, speaking, writing, and cultivating of this increasingly vibrant minority language. This sense of Basque identity tied to the local language does not exist in isolation. It is juxtaposed with an equally strong sense of national identity tied with the use of the Spanish and <a href="French%20language">French language</a>s among other Basques. As with many European states, a regional identity, be it linguistically derived or otherwise, is not mutually exclusive with the broader national one. For example, Basque <a href="France%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">rugby union</a> player for France, <a href="Imanol%20Harinordoquy">Imanol Harinordoquy</a>, has said about his national identity:I am French and Basque. There is no conflict, I am proud of both. . . . I have friends who are involved in the political side of things but that is not for me. My only interest is the culture, the Euskera language, the people, our history and ways.

As a result of state language promotion, school policies, the effects of mass media and migration, today virtually all Basques (except for some children below school age) speak the official language of their state (Spanish or French). There are extremely few Basque monolingual speakers: essentially all Basque speakers are bilingual on both sides of the border. Spanish or French is typically the first language of citizens from other regions (who often feel no need to learn Basque), and Spanish or French is also the first language of many Basques, all of which maintains the dominance of the state tongues of both France and Spain. Recent Basque Government policies aim to change this pattern, as they are viewed as potential threats against mainstream usage of the minority tongue.

The Basque language is classified as a <a href="genetic%20%28linguistics%29">genetic</a> <a href="language%20isolate">language isolate</a>. Thus, Basque contrasts with other European languages, most of which belong to the broad <a href="Indo-European%20language%20family">Indo-European language family</a>. Another peculiarity of Basque is that it has been spoken continuously "<a href="in%20situ">in situ</a>", in and around its present territorial location, for longer than other modern European languages, which have all been introduced in historical or prehistorical times through population migrations or other processes of cultural transmission.

However, popular stereotypes characterizing Basque as "the oldest language in Europe" and "unique among the world's languages" may be misunderstood and lead to erroneous assumptions. Over the centuries, Basque has remained in continuous contact with neighboring western European languages with which it has come to share numerous lexical properties and typological features; it is therefore misleading to exaggerate the "outlandish" character of Basque. Basque is also a modern language, and is established as a written and printed one used in present-day forms of publication and communication, as well as a language spoken and used in a very wide range of social and cultural contexts, styles, and registers.

Basques have a close attachment to their home ("etxe(a)" 'house, home'), especially when this consists of the traditional self-sufficient, family-run farm or "<a href="baserri">baserri</a>(a)". Home in this context is synonymous with family roots. Some <a href="Basque%20surnames">Basque surnames</a> were adapted from old "baserri" or <a href="habitation%20names">habitation names</a>. They typically related to a geographical orientation or other locally meaningful identifying features. Such surnames provide even those Basque whose families may have left the land generations ago with an important link to their rural family origins: "Bengoetxea" "the house of further down", "Goikoetxea" "the house above", "Landaburu" "top of the field", "Errekondo" "next to the stream", "Elizalde" "by the church", "Mendizabal" "wide hill", "Usetxe" "house of birds" "Ibarretxe" "house in the valley", "Etxeberria" "the new house", and so on.

In contrast to surrounding regions, ancient Basque inheritance patterns, recognised in the "<a href="fueros">fueros</a>," favour survival of the unity of inherited land holdings. In a kind of primogeniture, these usually are inherited by either eldest male or female. As in other cultures, the fate of other family members depended on the assets of a family. The wealthy Basque families tended to provide for all children in some way while the less affluent had only one asset to provide to one child. However, this heir often provided for the rest of the family. Unlike England with the strict primogeniture where the eldest son inherited everything and did not provide for others. Even though they were provided for in some way siblings had to make their livings by other means. Before the advent of industrialisation, this system resulted in the emigration of many rural Basques to Spain, France or the Americas. Harsh by modern standards, this custom resulted in a great many enterprising figures of Basque origin who went into the world to earn their way, from Spanish <a href="conquistador">conquistador</a>s such as <a href="Lope%20de%20Aguirre">Lope de Aguirre</a> and Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, to explorers, missionaries and saints of the Catholic Church, such as <a href="Francis%20Xavier">Francis Xavier</a>.

A widespread belief that Basque society was originally <a href="matriarchal">matriarchal</a> is at odds with the current, clearly <a href="patrilineal">patrilineal</a> kinship system and inheritance structures. Some scholars and commentators have attempted to reconcile these points by assuming that patrilineal kinship represents an innovation. In any case, the social position of women in both traditional and modern Basque society is somewhat better than in neighbouring cultures, and women have a substantial influence in decisions about the domestic economy. In the past, some women participated in collective magical ceremonies. They were key participants in a rich folklore, today largely forgotten.

<a href="Basque%20cuisine">Basque cuisine</a> is at the heart of Basque culture, influenced by the neighboring communities and the excellent produce from the sea and the land. A 20th-century feature of Basque culture is the phenomenon of <a href="gastronomical%20society">gastronomical societies</a> (called "<a href="txoko">txoko</a>" in Basque), food clubs where men gather to cook and enjoy their own food. Until recently, women were allowed entry only one day in the year. Cider houses (<a href="Sagardotegi">Sagardotegi</a>ak) are popular restaurants in Gipuzkoa open for a few months while the cider is in season.

At the end of the 20th century, despite <a href="ETA%20%28separatist%20group%29">ETA</a> violence (ended in 2010) and the crisis of heavy industries, the Basque economic condition recovered remarkably. They emerged from the <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Franco</a> regime with a revitalized language and culture. The Basque language expanded geographically led by large increases in the major urban centers of Pamplona, Bilbao, and Bayonne, where only a few decades ago the Basque language had all but disappeared. Nowadays, the number of Basque speakers is maintaining its level or increasing slightly.

Traditionally Basques have been mostly <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a>s. In the 19th century and well into the 20th, Basques as a group remained notably devout and churchgoing. In recent years church attendance has fallen off, as in most of Western Europe. The region has been a source of missionaries like <a href="Francis%20Xavier">Francis Xavier</a> and <a href="Michel%20Garico%C3%AFts">Michel Garicoïts</a>. <a href="Ignatius%20Loyola">Ignatius Loyola</a>, founder of the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Society of Jesus</a>, was a Basque. <a href="California">California</a> <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> <a href="Ferm%C3%ADn%20Lasu%C3%A9n">Fermín Lasuén</a> was born in <a href="Vitoria-Gasteiz">Vitoria</a>. Lasuén was the successor to Franciscan Padre <a href="Jun%C3%ADpero%20Serra">Junípero Serra</a> and founded 9 of the 21 extant <a href="California%20Missions">California Missions</a> along the coast.

A sprout of <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a> in the continental Basque Country produced the first translation of the new Testament into Basque by <a href="Joanes%20Leizarraga">Joanes Leizarraga</a>. After <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20France">Henry III of Navarre</a> converted to Catholicism to become king of France, Protestantism almost disappeared.

<a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a> held a Jewish community composed mainly of <a href="Sephardi%20Jews">Sephardi Jews</a> fleeing from the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Spanish</a> and <a href="Portuguese%20Inquisition">Portuguese Inquisition</a>s. There were also important Jewish and <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> communities in <a href="Navarre">Navarre</a> before the Castilian invasion of 1512-21.

Nowadays, according to one single opinion poll, only slightly more than 50% of Basques profess some kind of belief in <a href="God">God</a>, while the rest are either <a href="agnostic">agnostic</a> or <a href="atheist">atheist</a>. The number of religious skeptics increases noticeably for the younger generations, while the older ones are more religious.
<a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> is, by far, the largest religion in <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque Country</a>. In 2012, the proportion of Basques that identify themselves as Roman Catholic was 58.6%, while it is one of the most secularized communities of Spain: 24.6% were non-religious and 12.3% of Basques were <a href="atheist">atheist</a>.

Christianisation of the Basque Country has been the topic of some discussion. There are broadly speaking two views. According to one, Christianity arrived in the Basque Country during the 4th and 5th centuries but according to the other, it did not take place until the 12th and 13th centuries. The main issue lies in the different interpretations of what is considered Christianisation. Early traces of Christianity can be found in the major urban areas from the 4th century onwards, a bishopric from 589 in Pamplona and three hermit cave concentrations (two in Álava, one in Navarre) were in use from the 6th century onwards. In this sense, Christianity arrived "early".

Pre-Christian belief seems to have focused on a goddess called <a href="Mari%20%28goddess%29">Mari</a>. A number of place-names contain her name and would suggest these places were related to worship of her such as "<a href="Anbotoko%20Mari">Anbotoko Mari</a>" who appears to have been related to the weather. According to one tradition, she travelled every seven years between a cave on Mount <a href="Anboto">Anboto</a> and one on another mountain (the stories vary); the weather would be wet when she was in Anboto, dry when she was in <a href="Alo%C3%B1a">Aloña</a>, or <a href="Supelegor">Supelegor</a>, or <a href="Gorbea">Gorbea</a>. One of her names, "Mari Urraca" possibly ties her to an historical Navarrese princess of the 11th and 12th century, with other legends giving her a brother or cousin who was a Roman Catholic priest. So far the discussions about whether the name Mari is original and just happened to coincide closely with the Christian name María or if Mari is an early Basque attempt to give a Christian veneer to pagan worship have remained speculative. At any rate, Mari (Andramari) is one of the oldest worshipped Christian icons in Basque territories.

Mari's consort is <a href="Sugaar">Sugaar</a>. This <a href="chthonic">chthonic</a> couple seem to bear the superior ethical power and also the power of creation and destruction. It's said that when they gathered in the high caves of the sacred peaks, they engendered the storms. These meetings typically happened on Friday nights, the day of historical <a href="Akelarre%20%28witchcraft%29">akelarre</a> or <a href="coven">coven</a>. Mari was said to reside in Mount <a href="Anboto">Anboto</a>; periodically she crossed the skies as a bright light to reach her other home at mount <a href="Txindoki">Txindoki</a>.

Legends also speak of many and abundant genies, like "<a href="jentilak">jentilak</a>" (equivalent to <a href="giant%20%28mythology%29">giant</a>s), "lamiak" (equivalent to <a href="nymph">nymph</a>s), "<a href="mairu">mairu</a>ak" (builders of the cromlechs or stone circles, literally <a href="Moors">Moors</a>), "iratxoak" (<a href="imp">imp</a>s), "<a href="sorginak">sorginak</a>" (<a href="witch">witch</a>es, priestess of Mari), and so on. <a href="Basajaun">Basajaun</a> is a Basque version of the <a href="Woodwose">Woodwose</a>. This character is probably an anthropomorphism of the bear. There is a <a href="trickster">trickster</a> named "<a href="San%20Martin%20Txiki">San Martin Txiki</a>" ("St Martin the Lesser").

It has been shown that some of these stories have entered Basque culture in recent centuries or as part of Roman "<a href="superstition">superstition</a>". It is unclear whether <a href="neolithic">neolithic</a> stone structures called <a href="dolmen">dolmen</a>s have a religious significance or were built to house animals or resting shepherds. Some of the dolmens and <a href="Stone%20circles">cromlechs</a> are burial sites serving as well as border markers.

The "jentilak" ('<a href="Giant%20%28mythology%29">Giants</a>'), on the other hand, are a legendary people which explains the disappearance of a people of <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a> culture that used to live in the high lands and with no knowledge of the iron. Many legends about them tell that they were bigger and taller, with a great force, but were displaced by the "ferrons", or workers of ironworks foundries, until their total fade-out. They were pagans, but one of them, <a href="Olentzero">Olentzero</a>, accepted Christianity and became a sort of Basque <a href="Santa%20Claus">Santa Claus</a>. They gave name to several toponyms, as "<a href="Jentilbaratza">Jentilbaratza</a>".
Historically, Basque society can be described as being somewhat at odds with Roman and later European societal norms.

<a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>'s account of the north of Spain in his "<a href="Geographica">Geographica</a>" (written between approximately 20 BC and 20 AD) makes a mention of "a sort of woman-rule—not at all a mark of civilization" (Hadington 1992), a first mention of the—for the period—unusual position of women. "Women could inherit and control property as well as officiate in churches. Combined with the issue of lingering pagan beliefs, this enraged the leaders of the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a>, perhaps leading to <a href="Logro%C3%B1o%20trials">one of the largest witch hunts</a> in the Basque town of <a href="Logro%C3%B1o">Logroño</a> in 1610".

This preference for female dominance existed well into the 20th century:
...<a href="matrilineal">matrilineal</a> inheritance laws, and agricultural work performed by women continued in Basque country until the early twentieth century. For more than a century, scholars have widely discussed the high status of Basque women in law codes, as well as their positions as judges, inheritors, and arbitrators through ante-Roman, medieval, and modern times. The system of laws governing succession in the French Basque region reflected total equality between the sexes. Up until the eve of the French Revolution, the Basque woman was truly ‘the mistress of the house', hereditary guardian, and head of the lineage.

Although the <a href="kingdom%20of%20Navarre">kingdom of Navarre</a> did adopt feudalism, most Basques also possessed unusual social institutions different from those of the rest of feudal Europe. Some aspects of this include the <a href="elizate">elizate</a> tradition where local house-owners met in front of the church to elect a representative to send to the "juntas" and "<a href="Juntas%20Generales">Juntas Generales</a>" (such as the "Juntas Generales de Vizcaya" or "Guipúzcoa") which administered much larger areas. Another example was the fact that in the medieval period most land was owned by the farmers, not the Church or a king.

The great family of ball games has its unique offspring among Basque ball games, known generically as <a href="pilota">pilota</a> (Spanish: "pelota"). Some variants have been exported to the United States and <a href="Macau">Macau</a> under the name of <a href="Jai%20Alai">Jai Alai</a>.

There are several sports derived by Basques from everyday chores. Heavy workers were challenged and bets placed upon them. Examples are:

The <a href="encierro">encierro</a> (bull run) in <a href="Pamplona">Pamplona</a>'s <a href="festival">fiesta</a>s "<a href="San%20Ferm%C3%ADn">Sanfermines</a>" started as a transport of bulls to the ring. These encierros, as well as other bull and <a href="Cattle">bullock</a> related activities are not exclusive to Pamplona but are traditional in many towns and villages of the Basque country.

There are several clubs within the Basque Country, such as <a href="Real%20Sociedad">Real Sociedad</a>, <a href="Deportivo%20Alav%C3%A9s">Deportivo Alavés</a>, <a href="SD%20Eibar">SD Eibar</a>, <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao">Athletic Club</a> and <a href="CA%20Osasuna">CA Osasuna</a> (the only club in <a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a> that has a Basque name — "osasuna" means "health"). In the 2016-2017 season these five clubs played together in La Liga, the first instance where five Basque clubs have reached that level at the same time. Athletic's <a href="Athletic%20Bilbao%20signing%20policy">recruitment policy</a> has meant the club refuses to sign any non-Basque players. Real Sociedad also previously employed such a policy.

<a href="Rugby%20union">Rugby union</a> is a popular sport among French Basques, with major clubs <a href="Biarritz%20Olympique">Biarritz Olympique</a> and <a href="Aviron%20Bayonnais">Aviron Bayonnais</a> traditional powerhouses in the premier division of French Rugby (the <a href="Top%2014">Top 14</a>). Biarritz regularly play <a href="Heineken%20Cup">Heineken Cup</a> matches, especially knockout matches, at <a href="Estadio%20Anoeta">Estadio Anoeta</a> in <a href="San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n">San Sebastian</a>. Games between the Basque clubs and Catalan club <a href="USA%20Perpignan">USA Perpignan</a> are always hard fought.

Cycling is popular and the <a href="Euskaltel-Euskadi">Euskaltel-Euskadi</a> professional cycling team, partly sponsored by the Basque Government participated in the UCI World Tour division until 2014. Known for their orange tops and hill-climbing ability, their fans were famous for lining the famous Pyrenean climbs in the Tour de France, in support of their compatriots.

Each April the week-long <a href="Tour%20of%20the%20Basque%20Country">Tour of the Basque Country</a> showcases the beautiful rolling Basque countryside.

While there is no independent Basque state, Spain's <a href="autonomous%20communities%20of%20Spain">autonomous community</a> of the Basque Country, made up of the provinces of Álava (Araba), Biscay (Bizkaia) and Gipuzkoa, is primarily a historical consequence and an answer to the wide autonomy claim of its population.

Navarre has a separate statute of autonomy, a contentious arrangement designed during Spanish transition to democracy (the "Amejoramiento", an 'upgrade' of its previous status during dictatorship). It refers back to the kingdom status of Navarre (up to 1841) and their traditional institutional and legal framework (<a href="Fuero%23Basque%20and%20Pyrenean%20fueros">charter</a>s). Basque, the original and main language of Navarre up to the late 18th century, has kept family transmission especially in the northern part of Navarre and central areas to a lesser extent, designated as Basque speaking or mixed area in Navarrese law. Questions of political, linguistic and cultural allegiance and identity are highly complex in Navarre. Politically some Basque nationalists would like to integrate with the Basque Autonomous Community.

The <a href="French%20Basque%20Country">French Basque Country</a> today does not exist as a formal political entity and is officially simply part of the French <a href="department%20%28country%20subdivision%29">department</a> of <a href="Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es%20Atlantiques">Pyrénées Atlantiques</a>, centered in <a href="B%C3%A9arn">Béarn</a>. In recent years the number of mayors of the region supporting the creation of a separate Basque department has grown to 63.87%. So far, their attempts have been unsuccessful.

Both the Spanish and French governments have, at times, suppressed Basque <a href="natural%20language">linguistic</a> and cultural identity. The <a href="French%20Republics%20%28disambiguation%29">French Republics</a>, the epitome of the <a href="nation-state">nation-state</a>, have a long history of attempting the complete cultural absorption of cultural minority groups. Spain has, at most points in its history, granted some degree of linguistic, cultural, and even political autonomy to its Basques, but under the <a href="Spain%20under%20Franco">regime of Francisco Franco</a>, the Spanish government reversed the advances of Basque nationalism, as it had fought in the opposite side of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>: cultural activity in Basque was limited to folkloric issues and the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>.

Today, the <a href="Southern%20Basque%20Country">Southern Basque Country</a> within Spain enjoys an extensive cultural and political autonomy. The majority of schools under the jurisdiction of the <a href="Basque%20education%20system">Basque education system</a> use Basque as the primary medium of teaching. However, the situation is more delicate in the <a href="French%20Basque%20Country">Northern Basque Country</a> within France, where Basque is not officially recognized, and where lack of autonomy and monolingual public schooling in French exert great pressure on the Basque language.

In Navarre, Basque has been declared an endangered language, since the anti-Basque and conservative government of <a href="Navarrese%20People%27s%20Union">Navarrese People's Union</a> opposes the symbols of Basque culture, highlighting a Spanish identity for Navarre.

Basque is also spoken by immigrants in the major cities of Spain and France, in <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, in many parts of <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>, and in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, especially in Nevada, Idaho, and California.

Since its articulation by Sabino Arana in the late 19th century, the more radical currents of <a href="Basque%20nationalism">Basque nationalism</a> have demanded the right of <a href="self-determination">self-determination</a> and even <a href="independence">independence</a>. Within the Basque country, this element of Basque politics is often in balance with the conception of the Basque Country as just another part of the Spanish state, a view more commonly espoused on the right of the political spectrum. In contrast, the desire for greater autonomy or independence is particularly common among <a href="left-wing%20politics">leftist</a> Basque nationalists. The right of self-determination was asserted by the <a href="Basque%20Parliament">Basque Parliament</a> in 2002 and 2006.
Since self-determination is not recognized in the <a href="Spanish%20Constitution%20of%201978">Spanish Constitution of 1978</a>, a wide majority of Basques abstained (55%) and some even voted against it (23.5%) in the ratification referendum of December 6 of that year. However, it was approved by clear <a href="majority">majority</a> overall in Spanish (87%). The autonomous regime for the Basque Country was approved in a 1979 referendum but the autonomy of Navarre ("Amejoramiento del Fuero": "improvement of the charter") was never subject to a referendum but only approved by the Navarrese Cortes (parliament).

As with their language, the Basques are clearly a distinct cultural group in their region. They regard themselves as culturally and especially linguistically distinct from their surrounding neighbours. Some Basques, especially in Spain, are strongly nationalist, identifying far more firmly as Basques than as citizens of any existing state. Others do not, feeling as much Basque as Spanish. Many Basques regard the designation as a "cultural minority" as incomplete, favouring instead the definition as a nation, the commonly accepted designation for the Basque people up to the rise of the nation-states and the definition imposed by the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Basque%20people%23Revolution%20and%20war">1812 Spanish Constitution</a>.

In modern times, as a European people living in a highly industrialized area, cultural differences from the rest of Europe are inevitably blurred, although a conscious cultural identity as a people or nation remains very strong, as does an identification with their homeland, even among many Basques who have emigrated to other parts of Spain or France, or to other parts of the world.

The strongest distinction between the Basques and their traditional neighbours is linguistic. Surrounded by <a href="Romance%20languages">Romance-language</a> speakers, the Basques traditionally spoke (and many still speak) a language that was not only non-Romance but non-Indo-European. The prevailing belief amongst Basques, and forming part of their national identity, is that their language has continuity with the people who were in this region since not only pre-Roman and pre-Celtic times, but since the Stone Age.

In 1920, <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a> referred to the <a href="Mediterranean%20race">Mediterranean race</a> as the "Iberian race". He regarded it as a fourth subrace of the Caucasian race, along with the "Aryan", "Semitic", and "Hamitic" subraces. He stated that the main <a href="ethnic%20group">ethnic group</a> that most purely represented the racial stock of the Iberian race was the Basques, and that the Basques were the descendants of the <a href="Cro-Magnons">Cro-Magnons</a>. In 1994, in his book "The History and Geography of Human Genes", <a href="population%20geneticist">population geneticist</a> <a href="L.%20Luca%20Cavalli-Sforza">L. Luca Cavalli-Sforza</a> stated that "there is support from many sides" for the hypothesis that the Basques are the descendants of the original Cro-Magnons.

Even before the development of modern <a href="genetics">genetics</a> based on <a href="DNA%20sequencing">DNA sequencing</a>, Basques were already noted for distinctive genetic patterns, such as possessing the highest global apportion of the <a href="Rh%20blood%20group%20system">Rh-</a> blood type (35% phenotypically, 60% genetically). Additionally, the Basque population has virtually no <a href="ABO%20blood%20group%20system">B blood type</a>, nor the related AB type. They have a high rate of O blood group but this is probably due to isolation.

Although they are genetically distinctive in some ways, the Basques are still very typically European in terms of their <a href="Y-DNA">Y-DNA</a> and <a href="mtDNA">mtDNA</a> sequences, and in terms of some other genetic <a href="Locus%20%28genetics%29">loci</a>. These same sequences are widespread throughout the western half of Europe, especially along the western fringe of the continent.

The distinctiveness noted by studies of 'classical' genetic markers (such as blood groups) and the apparently "pre-Indo-European" nature of the Basque language has resulted in a popular and long-held view that Basques are "living fossils" of the earliest <a href="Anatomically%20modern%20humans">modern humans</a> who colonized Europe. However, studies of the <a href="Y-chromosome">Y-chromosome</a> found that on their direct male lineages, the vast majority of modern Basques have a common ancestry with other Western Europeans, namely a marked predominance of <a href="Haplogroup%20R1b%20%28Y-DNA%29">Haplogroup R1b</a>.

Initially Haplogroup R1b was theorised to be that a Palaeolithic marker, introduced when Europe was repopulated after the <a href="Last%20Glacial%20Maximum">Last Glacial Maximum</a>, about 25,000 years ago. As such, Basque populations were used as proxy representatives for the "Palaeolithic component" in admixture studies that tried to quantify the extent of Neolithic diffusions. Such studies concluded that the main components in the European genomes appear to derive from ancestors whose features were similar to those of modern Basques and people of the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a> (or Western Asia), with average values greater than 35% for both these parental populations, regardless of whether molecular information is taken into account or not. The smallest degree of both Basque and Near Eastern admixture is found in Finland, whereas the highest values are, respectively, 70% "Basque" in Spain and roughly 60% "<a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>ern" in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>. This theory encountered inconsistencies even prior to most recent chronological re-evaluations. That R1b should be a Palaeolithic marker was an "ad hoc" assumption suggested by Semino "et al." (2000) and propagated by subsequent scholars without further analysis. Higher resolution <a href="STR%20analysis">STR analysis</a> of R1b lineages from other western European populations (e.g. Italy or Britain) show that their populations appear to derive from the Basque ones.

More recent studies instead propose that R1b spread through Europe from southwest Asia in the Neolithic period or later, between 4,000 and 8,000 years ago.

<a href="Autosome">Autosomal genetic</a> studies have confirmed that Basques share:

Several ancient DNA samples have been recovered and amplified from Palaeolithic sites in the Basque region. The collection of mtDNA haplogroups sampled there differed significantly compared to their modern frequencies. The authors concluded that there is "discontinuity" between ancient and modern Basques.

Thus, while Basques harbour some very archaic lineages (such as mtDNA Hg U8a), they are not of "undiluted Palaeolithic ancestry", nor are they ancestral to large parts of western Europe. Rather, their genetic distinctiveness is a result of centuries of low population size, genetic drift and endogamy.

In 2015, a new scientific study of Basque DNA was published which seems to indicate that Basques are descendants of Neolithic farmers who mixed with local hunters before becoming genetically isolated from the rest of Europe for millennia. Mattias Jakobsson from Uppsala University in Sweden analysed genetic material from eight Stone Age human skeletons found in El Portalón Cavern in <a href="Atapuerca%20Mountains">Atapuerca</a>, northern Spain. These individuals lived between 3,500 and 5,500 years ago, after the transition to farming in southwest Europe. The results show that these early Iberian farmers are the closest ancestors to present-day Basques.

The official findings were published in "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences" of the United States. "Our results show that the Basques trace their ancestry to early farming groups from Iberia, which contradicts previous views of them being a remnant population that trace their ancestry to Mesolithic hunter-gatherer groups," says Prof. Jakobsson.

It has also been suggested that the high incidence of R1b among Basques can be attributed to an invasion by <a href="Proto-Indo-Europeans">Indo-European</a> warriors who intermarried with local women, who then raised the resulting children in their culture, not that of their fathers.

Among the most notable Basque people are <a href="Juan%20Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Elcano">Juan Sebastián Elcano</a> (led the first successful expedition to circumnavigate the globe after <a href="Ferdinand%20Magellan">Ferdinand Magellan</a> died mid-journey); <a href="Sancho%20III%20of%20Navarre">Sancho III of Navarre</a>; and <a href="Ignatius%20of%20Loyola">Ignatius of Loyola</a> and <a href="Francis%20Xavier">Francis Xavier</a>, founders of the <a href="Society%20of%20Jesus">Society of Jesus</a>. <a href="Diego%20de%20Gardoqui">Don Diego María de Gardoqui y Arriquibar</a> (1735–1798) was Spain's first Ambassador to the United States. <a href="Miguel%20de%20Unamuno">Miguel de Unamuno</a> was a noted novelist and philosopher of the late 19th and the 20th century.

Bookkeeping

Bookkeeping is the recording of financial transactions, and is part of the process of <a href="accounting">accounting</a> in <a href="business">business</a>. Transactions include purchases, sales, receipts, and payments by an individual person or an organization/corporation. There are several standard methods of bookkeeping, such as the <a href="single-entry%20bookkeeping%20system">single-entry bookkeeping system</a> and the <a href="double-entry%20bookkeeping%20system">double-entry bookkeeping system</a>, but, while they may be thought of as "real" bookkeeping, any process that involves the recording of financial transactions is a bookkeeping process.

Bookkeeping is usually performed by a bookkeeper. A bookkeeper (or book-keeper) is a person who records the day-to-day financial transactions of a business. He or she is usually responsible for writing the "daybooks", which contain records of purchases, sales, receipts, and payments. The bookkeeper is responsible for ensuring that all transactions whether it is cash transaction or credit transaction are recorded in the correct daybook, supplier's ledger, customer ledger, and <a href="general%20ledger">general ledger</a>; an accountant can then create reports from the information concerning the financial transactions recorded by the bookkeeper.

The bookkeeper brings the books to the <a href="trial%20balance">trial balance</a> stage: an accountant may prepare the <a href="income%20statement">income statement</a> and <a href="balance%20sheet">balance sheet</a> using the trial balance and ledgers prepared by the bookkeeper.

The origin of book-keeping is lost in obscurity, but recent researches would appear to show that some method of keeping accounts has existed from the remotest times. Babylonian records have been found dating back as far as 2600 B.C., written with a stylus on small slabs of clay. 
The term "waste book" was used in colonial America referring to bookkeeping. The purpose was to document daily transactions including receipts and expenditures. This was recorded in chronological order, and the purpose was for temporary use only. The daily transactions would then be recorded in a daybook or account ledger in order to balance the accounts. The name "waste book" comes from the fact that once the waste book's data were transferred to the actual journal, the waste book could be discarded.

The bookkeeping process primarily records the "financial effects" of transactions. The difference between a manual and any electronic accounting system results from the former's <a href="latency%20%28engineering%29">latency (engineering)</a> between the recording of a financial transaction and its posting in the relevant account. This delay—absent in electronic accounting systems due to nearly instantaneous posting into relevant accounts—is a basic characteristic of manual systems, thus giving rise to primary books of accounts such as Cash Book, Bank Book, Purchase Book, and Sales Book for recording the immediate effect of a financial transaction.

In the normal course of business, a document is produced each time a transaction occurs. Sales and purchases usually have <a href="invoice">invoice</a>s or <a href="receipt">receipt</a>s. Deposit slips are produced when lodgements (deposits) are made to a <a href="bank%20account">bank account</a>. Checks (spelled "cheques" in the UK and several other countries) are written to pay money out of the account. Bookkeeping first involves recording the details of all of these "source documents" into multi-column "journals" (also known as "books of first entry" or "daybooks"). For example, all credit sales are recorded in the sales journal; all cash payments are recorded in the cash payments journal. Each column in a journal normally corresponds to an account. In the <a href="single-entry%20accounting%20system">single entry system</a>, each transaction is recorded only once. Most individuals who balance their check-book each month are using such a system, and most personal-finance software follows this approach.

After a certain period, typically a month, each column in each <a href="Journal%20entry">journal</a> is totalled to give a summary for that period. Using the rules of double-entry, these journal summaries are then transferred to their respective accounts in the <a href="ledger">ledger</a>, or "account book". For example, the entries in the Sales Journal are taken and a debit entry is made in each customer's account (showing that the customer now owes us money), and a credit entry might be made in the account for "Sale of class 2 widgets" (showing that this activity has generated revenue for us). This process of transferring summaries or individual transactions to the ledger is called "posting". Once the posting process is complete, accounts kept using the "T" format undergo "balancing", which is simply a process to arrive at the balance of the account.

As a partial check that the posting process was done correctly, a working document called an "unadjusted trial balance" is created. In its simplest form, this is a three-column list. Column One contains the names of those accounts in the <a href="ledger">ledger</a> which have a non-zero balance. If an account has a "debit" balance, the balance amount is copied into Column Two (the "debit column"); if an account has a "credit" balance, the amount is copied into Column Three (the "credit column"). The debit column is then totalled, and then the credit column is totalled. The two totals must agree—which is not by chance—because under the double-entry rules, whenever there is a posting, the debits of the posting equal the credits of the posting. If the two totals do not agree, an error has been made, either in the journals or during the posting process. The error must be located and rectified, and the totals of the debit column and the credit column recalculated to check for agreement before any further processing can take place.

Once the accounts balance, the accountant makes a number of adjustments and changes the balance amounts of some of the accounts. These adjustments must still obey the double-entry rule: for example, the "<a href="inventory">inventory</a>" account and asset account might be changed to bring them into line with the actual numbers counted during a stocktake. At the same time, the "expense" account associated with usage of inventory is adjusted by an equal and opposite amount. Other adjustments such as posting <a href="depreciation">depreciation</a> and prepayments are also done at this time. This results in a listing called the "adjusted trial balance". It is the accounts in this list, and their corresponding debit or credit balances, that are used to prepare the financial statements.

Finally <a href="financial%20statement">financial statement</a>s are drawn from the trial balance, which may include:

Two common bookkeeping systems used by businesses and other organizations are the <a href="single-entry%20bookkeeping%20system">single-entry bookkeeping system</a> and the <a href="double-entry%20bookkeeping%20system">double-entry bookkeeping system</a>. Single-entry bookkeeping uses only income and expense <a href="Account%20%28accountancy%29">account</a>s, recorded primarily in a revenue and expense journal. Single-entry bookkeeping is adequate for many small businesses. In the double-entry accounting system, at least two accounting entries are required to record each financial transaction. These entries may occur in asset, liability, equity, expense, or revenue accounts.

The primary bookkeeping record in single-entry bookkeeping is the "cash book", which is similar to a checking account (UK: cheque account, current account) register, but allocates the income and expenses to various income and expense accounts. Separate account records are maintained for petty cash, accounts payable and receivable, and other relevant transactions such as <a href="inventory">inventory</a> and travel expenses. These days, single-entry bookkeeping can be done with <a href="DIY">DIY</a> bookkeeping software to speed up manual calculations.

A "double-entry bookkeeping system" is a set of rules for recording financial information in a <a href="financial%20accounting">financial accounting</a> system in which every transaction or event changes at least two different nominal <a href="ledger">ledger</a> accounts.

A "daybook" is a descriptive and chronological (diary-like) record of day-to-day <a href="financial%20transactions">financial transactions</a> also called a "book of original entry". The daybook's details must be entered formally into journals to enable posting to ledgers. Daybooks include:


A "<a href="petty%20cash">petty cash</a>" book is a record of small-value purchases before they are later transferred to the ledger and final accounts; it is maintained by a petty or junior cashier. This type of cash book usually uses the <a href="imprest%20system">imprest system</a>: a certain amount of money is provided to the petty cashier by the senior cashier. This money is to cater for minor expenditures (hospitality, minor stationery, casual postage, and so on) and is reimbursed periodically on satisfactory explanation of how it was spent.

"<a href="Journal%20entry">Journals</a>" are recorded in the general journal daybook. A journal is a formal and chronological record of <a href="financial%20transactions">financial transactions</a> before their values are accounted for in the general ledger as <a href="debits%20and%20credits">debits and credits</a>. A company can maintain one journal for all transactions, or keep several journals based on similar activity (e.g., sales, cash receipts, revenue, etc.), making transactions easier to summarize and reference later. For every <a href="debits%20and%20credits">debit</a> journal entry recorded, there must be an equivalent <a href="debits%20and%20credits">credit</a> journal entry to maintain a balanced accounting equation.

A "<a href="ledger">ledger</a>" is a record of <a href="Account%20%28accountancy%29">accounts</a>.The ledger is a permanent summary of all amounts entered in supporting Journals which list individual transactions by date. These accounts are recorded separately, showing their beginning/ending <a href="Balance%20%28accounting%29">balance</a>. A journal lists <a href="financial%20transactions">financial transactions</a> in chronological order, without showing their balance but showing how much is going to be charged in each account. A ledger takes each financial transaction from the journal and records it into the corresponding account for every transaction listed. The ledger also sums up the total of every account, which is transferred into the <a href="balance%20sheet">balance sheet</a> and the <a href="income%20statement">income statement</a>. There are three different kinds of ledgers that deal with book-keeping:


A <a href="chart%20of%20accounts">chart of accounts</a> is a list of the <a href="Account%20%28accountancy%29">accounts</a> codes that can be identified with numeric, alphabetical, or alphanumeric codes allowing the account to be located in the general ledger. The equity section of the chart of accounts is based on the fact that the legal structure of the entity is of a particular legal type. Possibilities include "sole trader", "partnership", "trust", and "company".

Computerized bookkeeping removes many of the paper "books" that are used to record the financial transactions of an entity—instead, relational databases take their place, but they still typically enforce the <a href="double-entry%20bookkeeping%20system">double-entry bookkeeping system</a> and methodology.

Bézier curve

A Bézier curve (pronounced ) is a <a href="parametric%20equation">parametric curve</a> frequently used in <a href="computer%20graphics">computer graphics</a> and related fields. Generalizations of Bézier curves to higher <a href="dimension">dimension</a>s are called <a href="B%C3%A9zier%20surface">Bézier surface</a>s, of which the <a href="B%C3%A9zier%20triangle">Bézier triangle</a> is a special case.

In <a href="vector%20graphics">vector graphics</a>, Bézier curves are used to model smooth curves that can be scaled indefinitely. "Paths", as they are commonly referred to in image manipulation programs, are combinations of linked Bézier curves. Paths are not bound by the limits of <a href="raster%20graphics">rasterized</a> images and are intuitive to modify.

Bézier curves are also used in the time domain, particularly in <a href="animation">animation</a>, <a href="user%20interface">user interface</a> design and smoothing cursor trajectory in eye gaze controlled interfaces. For example, a Bézier curve can be used to specify the velocity over time of an object such as an icon moving from A to B, rather than simply moving at a fixed number of pixels per step. When animators or <a href="Graphical%20user%20interface">interface</a> designers talk about the "physics" or "feel" of an operation, they may be referring to the particular Bézier curve used to control the velocity over time of the move in question.

This also applies to robotics where the motion of a welding arm, for example, should be smooth to avoid unnecessary wear.

The mathematical basis for Bézier curves—the <a href="Bernstein%20polynomial">Bernstein polynomial</a>—had been known since 1912, but the polynomials were not applied to graphics until some 50 years later,
when they were widely publicised by the <a href="France">French</a> engineer <a href="Pierre%20B%C3%A9zier">Pierre Bézier</a>, who used them to design <a href="automobile">automobile</a> bodies at <a href="Renault">Renault</a>. The study of these curves was however first developed in 1959 by mathematician <a href="Paul%20de%20Casteljau">Paul de Casteljau</a> using <a href="de%20Casteljau%27s%20algorithm">de Casteljau's algorithm</a>, a <a href="numerical%20stability">numerically stable</a> method to evaluate Bézier curves at <a href="Citro%C3%ABn">Citroën</a>, another French automaker.

Bézier curves are widely used in computer graphics to model smooth curves. As the curve is completely contained in the <a href="convex%20hull">convex hull</a> of its <a href="Control%20point%20%28mathematics%29">control points</a>, the points can be graphically displayed and used to manipulate the curve intuitively. <a href="Affine%20transformation">Affine transformation</a>s such as <a href="translation%20%28geometry%29">translation</a> and <a href="rotation">rotation</a> can be applied on the curve by applying the respective transform on the control points of the curve.

<a href="Quadratic%20function">Quadratic</a> and <a href="Cubic%20function">cubic</a> Bézier curves are most common. Higher degree curves are more <a href="computationally%20expensive">computationally expensive</a> to evaluate. When more complex shapes are needed, low order Bézier curves are patched together, producing a <a href="composite%20B%C3%A9zier%20curve">composite Bézier curve</a>. A composite Bézier curve is commonly referred to as a "path" in <a href="vector%20graphics">vector graphics</a> languages (like <a href="PostScript">PostScript</a>), vector graphics standards (like <a href="SVG">SVG</a>) and vector graphics programs (like <a href="Adobe%20Illustrator">Adobe Illustrator</a>, <a href="CorelDraw">CorelDraw</a> and <a href="Inkscape">Inkscape</a>). To guarantee <a href="smoothness">smoothness</a> ("C" continuity), the control point at which two curves meet must be on the line between the two control points on either side.

The simplest method for scan converting (<a href="Rasterisation">rasterizing</a>) a Bézier curve is to evaluate it at many closely spaced points and scan convert the approximating sequence of line segments. However, this does not guarantee that the rasterized output looks sufficiently smooth, because the points may be spaced too far apart. Conversely it may generate too many points in areas where the curve is close to linear. A common adaptive method is recursive subdivision, in which a curve's control points are checked to see if the curve approximates a straight line to within a small tolerance. If not, the curve is subdivided parametrically into two segments, 0 ≤ "t" ≤ 0.5 and 0.5 ≤ "t" ≤ 1, and the same procedure is applied recursively to each half. There are also forward differencing methods, but great care must be taken to analyse error propagation.

Analytical methods where a Bézier is intersected with each scan line involve finding roots of cubic polynomials (for cubic Béziers) and dealing with multiple roots, so they are not often used in practice.

In animation applications, such as <a href="Adobe%20Flash">Adobe Flash</a> and <a href="Synfig">Synfig</a>, Bézier curves are used to outline, for example, movement. Users outline the wanted path in Bézier curves, and the application creates the needed frames for the object to move along the path.

For 3D animation Bézier curves are often used to define 3D paths as well as 2D curves for keyframe interpolation.. Bézier curves are now very frequently used to control the animation easing in <a href="CSS">CSS</a> and <a href="JavaScript">JavaScript</a>.

<a href="TrueType">TrueType</a> fonts use composite Bézier curves composed of quadratic Bézier curves. Modern imaging systems like <a href="PostScript">PostScript</a>, <a href="Asymptote%20%28vector%20graphics%20language%29">Asymptote</a>, <a href="Metafont">Metafont</a>, and <a href="SVG">SVG</a> use composite Béziers composed of cubic Bézier curves for drawing curved shapes. <a href="OpenType">OpenType</a> fonts can use either kind, depending on the flavor of the font.

The internal rendering of all Bézier curves in font or vector graphics renderers will split them recursively up to the point where the curve is flat enough to be drawn as a series of linear or circular segments. The exact splitting algorithm is implementation dependent, only the flatness criteria must be respected to reach the necessary precision and to avoid non-monotonic local changes of curvature. The "smooth curve" feature of charts in <a href="Microsoft%20Excel">Microsoft Excel</a> also uses this algorithm.

Because arcs of circles and ellipses cannot be exactly represented by Bézier curves, they are first approximated by Bézier curves, which are in turn approximated by arcs of circles. This is inefficient as there exists also approximations of all Bézier curves using arcs of circles or ellipses, which can be rendered incrementally with arbitrary precision. Another approach, used by modern hardware graphics adapters with accelerated geometry, can convert exactly all Bézier and conic curves (or surfaces) into <a href="Non-uniform%20rational%20B-spline">NURBS</a>, that can be rendered incrementally without first splitting the curve recursively to reach the necessary flatness condition. This approach also allows preserving the curve definition under all linear or perspective 2D and 3D transforms and projections.

Font engines, like <a href="FreeType">FreeType</a>, draw the font's curves (and lines) on a pixellated surface using a process known as <a href="font%20rasterization">font rasterization</a>.

A Bézier curve is defined by a set of "control points" P through P, where "n" is called its order ("n" = 1 for linear, 2 for quadratic, etc.). The first and last control points are always the end points of the curve; however, the intermediate control points (if any) generally do not lie on the curve. The sums in the following sections are to be understood as <a href="Affine_space%23Affine_combinations_and_barycenter">affine combinations</a>, the coefficients sum to 1.

Given distinct points P and P, a linear Bézier curve is simply a <a href="straight%20line">straight line</a> between those two points. The curve is given by

and is equivalent to <a href="linear%20interpolation">linear interpolation</a>.

A quadratic Bézier curve is the path traced by the function B("t"), given points P, P, and P,

which can be interpreted as the linear interpolant of corresponding points on the linear Bézier curves from P to P and from P to P respectively. Rearranging the preceding equation yields:

The derivative of the Bézier curve with respect to "t" is

from which it can be concluded that the tangents to the curve at P and P intersect at P. As "t" increases from 0 to 1, the curve departs from P in the direction of P, then bends to arrive at P from the direction of P.

The second derivative of the Bézier curve with respect to "t" is

Four points P, P, P and P in the plane or in higher-dimensional space define a cubic Bézier curve.
The curve starts at P going toward P and arrives at P coming from the direction of P. Usually, it will not pass through P or P; these points are only there to provide directional information. The distance between P and P determines "how far" and "how fast" the curve moves towards P before turning towards P.

Writing B("t") for the quadratic Bézier curve defined by points P, P, and P, the cubic Bézier curve can be defined as an affine combination of two quadratic Bézier curves:

The explicit form of the curve is:

For some choices of P and P the curve may intersect itself, or contain a cusp.

Any series of any 4 distinct points can be converted to a cubic Bézier curve that goes through all 4 points in order.
Given the starting and ending point of some cubic Bézier curve, and the points along the curve corresponding to "t" = 1/3 and "t" = 2/3, the control points for the original Bézier curve can be recovered.

The derivative of the cubic Bézier curve with respect to "t" is

The second derivative of the Bézier curve with respect to "t" is

Bézier curves can be defined for any degree "n."

A recursive definition for the Bézier curve of degree "n" expresses it as a point-to-point <a href="linear%20combination">linear combination</a> (<a href="linear%20interpolation">linear interpolation</a>) of a pair of corresponding points in two Bézier curves of degree "n" − 1.

Let formula_10 denote the Bézier curve determined by any selection of points P, P, ..., P. Then to start,

This recursion is elucidated in the animations below.

The formula can be expressed explicitly as follows:

where formula_14 are the <a href="binomial%20coefficient">binomial coefficient</a>s.

For example, for "n" = 5:

Some terminology is associated with these parametric curves. We have

where the polynomials

are known as <a href="Bernstein%20polynomial">Bernstein basis polynomials</a> of degree "n".

Note that "t" = 1, (1 − "t") = 1, and that the <a href="binomial%20coefficient">binomial coefficient</a>, formula_14, also expressed as formula_19 or formula_20, is:

The points P are called "control points" for the Bézier curve. The <a href="polygon">polygon</a> formed by connecting the Bézier points with <a href="line%20%28mathematics%29">lines</a>, starting with P and finishing with P, is called the "Bézier polygon" (or "control polygon"). The <a href="convex%20hull">convex hull</a> of the Bézier polygon contains the Bézier curve.

Sometimes it is desirable to express the Bézier curve as a <a href="polynomial">polynomial</a> instead of a sum of less straightforward <a href="Bernstein%20polynomial">Bernstein polynomial</a>s. Application of the <a href="binomial%20theorem">binomial theorem</a> to the definition of the curve followed by some rearrangement will yield:

where

This could be practical if formula_24 can be computed prior to many evaluations of formula_25; however one should use caution as high order curves may lack <a href="numeric%20stability">numeric stability</a> (<a href="de%20Casteljau%27s%20algorithm">de Casteljau's algorithm</a> should be used if this occurs). Note that the <a href="empty%20product">empty product</a> is 1.


A quadratic Bézier curve is also a segment of a <a href="parabola">parabola</a>. As a parabola is a <a href="conic%20section">conic section</a>, some sources refer to quadratic Béziers as "conic arcs". With reference to the figure on the right, the important features of the parabola can be derived as follows:


The derivative for a curve of order "n" is

The "t" in the function for a linear Bézier curve can be thought of as describing how far B("t") is from P to P. For example, when "t=0.25", B("t") is one quarter of the way from point P to P. As "t" varies from 0 to 1, B("t") describes a straight line from P to P.

For quadratic Bézier curves one can construct intermediate points Q and Q such that as "t" varies from 0 to 1:

For higher-order curves one needs correspondingly more intermediate points. For cubic curves one can construct intermediate points Q, Q, and Q that describe linear Bézier curves, and points R & R that describe quadratic Bézier curves:

For fourth-order curves one can construct intermediate points Q, Q, Q & Q that describe linear Bézier curves, points R, R & R that describe quadratic Bézier curves, and points S & S that describe cubic Bézier curves:

For fifth-order curves, one can construct similar intermediate points.

These representations rest on the process used in <a href="De%20Casteljau%27s%20algorithm">De Casteljau's algorithm</a> to calculate Bézier curves.

The curve at a fixed offset from a given Bézier curve, called an <a href="parallel%20curve">offset or parallel curve</a> in mathematics (lying "parallel" to the original curve, like the offset between rails in a <a href="railroad%20track">railroad track</a>), cannot be exactly formed by a Bézier curve (except in some trivial cases). In general, the two-sided offset curve of a cubic Bézier is a 10th-order <a href="algebraic%20curve">algebraic curve</a> and more generally for a Bézier of degree "n" the two-sided offset curve is an algebraic curve of degree 4"n"-2. However, there are <a href="heuristic">heuristic</a> methods that usually give an adequate approximation for practical purposes.

In the field of <a href="vector%20graphics">vector graphics</a>, painting two symmetrically distanced offset curves is called "stroking" (the Bézier curve or in general a path of several Bézier segments). The conversion from offset curves to filled Bézier contours is of practical importance in converting <a href="font">font</a>s defined in <a href="METAFONT">METAFONT</a>, which allows stroking of Bézier curves, to the more widely used <a href="PostScript%20fonts">PostScript type 1 font</a>s, which only allow (for efficiency purposes) the mathematically simpler operation of filling a contour defined by (non-self-intersecting) Bézier curves.

A Bézier curve of degree "n" can be converted into a Bézier curve of degree "n" + 1 "with the same shape". This is useful if software supports Bézier curves only of specific degree. For example, systems that can only work with cubic Bézier curves can implicitly work with quadratic curves by using their equivalent cubic representation.

To do degree elevation, we use the equality formula_30 Each component formula_31 is multiplied by (1 − "t") and "t", thus increasing a degree by one, without changing the value. Here is the example of increasing degree from 2 to 3.

For arbitrary "n" we use equalities

Therefore:

introducing arbitrary formula_35 and formula_36.

Therefore, new control points are 

The concept of Degree Elevation can be repeated on a control polygon R to get a sequence of control polygons R,R,R, and so on. After "r" degree elevations, the polygon R has the vertices P,P,P...,P given by 

It can also be shown that for the underlying Bézier curve "B",

The rational Bézier curve adds adjustable weights to provide closer approximations to arbitrary shapes. The numerator is a weighted Bernstein-form Bézier curve and the denominator is a weighted sum of <a href="Bernstein%20polynomial">Bernstein polynomial</a>s. Rational Bézier curves can, among other uses, be used to represent segments of <a href="conic%20section">conic section</a>s exactly, including circular arcs.

Given "n" + 1 control points P, the rational Bézier curve can be described by:

Banach algebra

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, especially <a href="functional%20analysis">functional analysis</a>, a Banach algebra, named after <a href="Stefan%20Banach">Stefan Banach</a>, is an <a href="associative%20algebra">associative algebra</a> "A" over the <a href="real%20number">real</a> or <a href="complex%20number">complex</a> numbers (or over a <a href="nonarchimedean%20field">non-Archimedean</a> complete <a href="normed%20field">normed field</a>) that at the same time is also a <a href="Banach%20space">Banach space</a>, i.e. a <a href="normed%20space">normed space</a> and <a href="complete%20metric%20space">complete</a> in the metric induced by the norm. The norm is required to satisfy

This ensures that the multiplication operation is <a href="continuous%20function%20%28topology%29">continuous</a>.

A Banach algebra is called "unital" if it has an <a href="identity%20element">identity element</a> for the multiplication whose norm is 1, and "commutative" if its multiplication is <a href="commutative">commutative</a>.
Any Banach algebra formula_2 (whether it has an <a href="identity%20element">identity element</a> or not) can be embedded isometrically into a unital Banach algebra formula_3 so as to form a closed ideal of formula_3. Often one assumes "a priori" that the algebra under consideration is unital: for one can develop much of the theory by considering formula_3 and then applying the outcome in the original algebra. However, this is not the case all the time. For example, one cannot define all the trigonometric functions in a Banach algebra without identity.

The theory of real Banach algebras can be very different from the theory of complex Banach algebras. For example, the <a href="Spectrum%20%28functional%20analysis%29">spectrum</a> of an element of a nontrivial complex Banach algebra can never be empty, whereas in a real Banach algebra it could be empty for some elements.

Banach algebras can also be defined over fields of <a href="p-adic%20number">p-adic number</a>s. This is part of <a href="p-adic%20analysis">p-adic analysis</a>.

The prototypical example of a Banach algebra is formula_6, the space of (complex-valued) continuous functions on a locally compact (Hausdorff) space that vanish at infinity. formula_6 is unital if and only if "X" is compact. The complex conjugation being an involution, formula_6 is in fact a <a href="C%2A-algebra">C*-algebra</a>. More generally, every C*-algebra is a Banach algebra.


The algebra of the <a href="quaternion">quaternion</a>s formula_9 is not a complex Banach algebra (for any norm on formula_9), for if formula_11 is a complex Banach algebra that is also a <a href="division%20algebra">division algebra</a>, then formula_12 (<a href="Gelfand%26amp%3Bndash%3BMazur%20theorem">Gelfand–Mazur theorem</a>), since if formula_13 is a point in the non-empty <a href="Spectrum%20%28functional%20analysis%29">spectrum</a> formula_14 of formula_15, formula_16 is not invertible, hence formula_17 since formula_11 is a division algebra, whence formula_19 (which also proves the Gelfand–Mazur theorem).

Several <a href="list%20of%20functions">elementary functions</a> which are defined via <a href="power%20series">power series</a> may be defined in any unital Banach algebra; examples include the <a href="exponential%20function">exponential function</a> and the <a href="trigonometric%20functions">trigonometric functions</a>, and more generally any <a href="entire%20function">entire function</a>. (In particular, the exponential map can be used to define <a href="abstract%20index%20group">abstract index group</a>s.) The formula for the <a href="geometric%20series">geometric series</a> remains valid in general unital Banach algebras. The <a href="binomial%20theorem">binomial theorem</a> also holds for two commuting elements of a Banach algebra.

The set of <a href="invertible%20element">invertible element</a>s in any unital Banach algebra is an <a href="open%20set">open set</a>, and the inversion operation on this set is continuous, (and hence homeomorphism) so that it forms a <a href="topological%20group">topological group</a> under multiplication.

If a Banach algebra has unit 1, then 1 cannot be a <a href="commutator%20%28ring%20theory%29">commutator</a>; i.e., formula_20  for any "x", "y" ∈ "A". This is because "xy" and "yx" have the same <a href="spectrum%20%28functional%20analysis%29">spectrum</a> except possibly "0".

The various algebras of functions given in the examples above have very different properties from standard examples of algebras such as the reals. For example:


Unital Banach algebras over the complex field provide a general setting to develop spectral theory. The "spectrum" of an element "x" ∈ "A", denoted by formula_21, consists of all those complex <a href="scalar%20%28mathematics%29">scalar</a>s "λ" such that "x" − "λ"1 is not invertible in "A". The spectrum of any element "x" is a closed subset of the closed disc in C with radius ||"x"|| and center 0, and thus is <a href="Compact%20space">compact</a>. Moreover, the spectrum formula_21 of an element "x" is <a href="non-empty">non-empty</a> and satisfies the <a href="spectral%20radius">spectral radius</a> formula:

Given "x" ∈ "A", the <a href="holomorphic%20functional%20calculus">holomorphic functional calculus</a> allows to define "ƒ"("x") ∈ "A" for any function "ƒ" <a href="holomorphic%20function">holomorphic</a> in a neighborhood of formula_24 Furthermore, the spectral mapping theorem holds:

When the Banach algebra "A" is the algebra L("X") of bounded linear operators on a complex Banach space "X"  (e.g., the algebra of square matrices), the notion of the spectrum in "A" coincides with the usual one in the operator theory. For "ƒ" ∈ "C"("X") (with a compact Hausdorff space "X"), one sees that:

The norm of a normal element "x" of a C*-algebra coincides with its spectral radius. This generalizes an analogous fact for normal operators.

Let "A"  be a complex unital Banach algebra in which every non-zero element "x" is invertible (a division algebra). For every "a" ∈ "A", there is "λ" ∈ C such that
"a" − "λ1 is not invertible (because the spectrum of "a" is not empty) hence "a" = "λ1 : this algebra "A" is naturally isomorphic to C (the complex case of the Gelfand–Mazur theorem).

Let "A"  be a unital "commutative" Banach algebra over C. Since "A" is then a commutative ring with unit, every non-invertible element of "A" belongs to some <a href="maximal%20ideal">maximal ideal</a> of "A". Since a maximal ideal formula_27 in "A" is closed, formula_28 is a Banach algebra that is a field, and it follows from the Gelfand–Mazur theorem that there is a bijection between the set of all maximal ideals of "A" and the set Δ("A") of all nonzero homomorphisms from "A"  to C. The set Δ("A") is called the "<a href="structure%20space">structure space</a>" or "character space" of "A", and its members "characters."

A character χ is a linear functional on "A" which is at the same time multiplicative, χ("ab") = χ("a") χ("b"), and satisfies "χ"(1) = 1. Every character is automatically continuous from "A"  to C, since the kernel of a character is a maximal ideal, which is closed. Moreover, the norm ("i.e.", operator norm) of a character is one. Equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence on "A" ("i.e.", the topology induced by the weak-* topology of "A"), the character space, Δ("A"), is a Hausdorff compact space.

For any "x" ∈ "A",

where formula_30 is the <a href="Gelfand%20representation">Gelfand representation</a> of "x" defined as follows: formula_30 is the continuous function from Δ("A") to C given by formula_32  The spectrum of formula_33 in the formula above, is the spectrum as element of the algebra "C"(Δ("A")) of complex continuous functions on the compact space Δ("A"). Explicitly,

As an algebra, a unital commutative Banach algebra is <a href="semisimple%20algebra">semisimple</a> (i.e., its <a href="Jacobson%20radical">Jacobson radical</a> is zero) if and only if its Gelfand representation has trivial kernel. An important example of such an algebra is a commutative C*-algebra. In fact, when "A" is a commutative unital C*-algebra, the Gelfand representation is then an isometric *-isomorphism between "A" and "C"(Δ("A")) .
