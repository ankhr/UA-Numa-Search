Bing Crosby

Harry Lillis "Bing" Crosby Jr. (; May 3, 1903 – October 14, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Crosby's trademark warm <a href="bass-baritone">bass-baritone</a> voice made him the best-selling recording artist of the 20th century, having sold over one billion records, tapes, compact discs and digital downloads around the world.

The first multimedia star, from 1931 to 1954 Crosby was a leader in record sales, radio ratings, and motion picture grosses. His early career coincided with technical recording innovations such as the microphone. This allowed him to develop a laid-back, intimate singing style that influenced many of the popular male singers who followed him, including <a href="Perry%20Como">Perry Como</a>, <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>, <a href="Dick%20Haymes">Dick Haymes</a>, and <a href="Dean%20Martin">Dean Martin</a>. "<a href="Yank%2C%20the%20Army%20Weekly">Yank</a>" magazine said that he was the person who had done the most for American soldiers' morale during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. In 1948, American polls declared him the "most admired man alive", ahead of <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> and <a href="Pope%20Pius%20XII">Pope Pius XII</a>. Also in 1948, "Music Digest" estimated that his recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music.

Crosby won an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a> for his role as Father Chuck O'Malley in the 1944 motion picture "<a href="Going%20My%20Way">Going My Way</a>" and was nominated for his reprise of the role in "<a href="The%20Bells%20of%20St.%20Mary%27s">The Bells of St. Mary's</a>" opposite <a href="Ingrid%20Bergman">Ingrid Bergman</a> the next year, becoming the first of six actors to be nominated twice for playing the same character. In 1963, Crosby received the first <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Global Achievement Award</a>. He is one of 33 people to have three stars on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>, in the categories of motion pictures, radio, and audio recording.

Crosby influenced the development of the postwar <a href="recording%20industry">recording industry</a>. He became the first performer to pre-record his radio shows and master his commercial recordings onto <a href="magnetic%20tape">magnetic tape</a>. Through the medium of recording, he constructed his radio programs with the same directorial tools and craftsmanship (editing, retaking, rehearsal, <a href="time%20shifting">time shifting</a>) used in motion picture production, a practice that became an industry standard. In addition to his work with early tape recording, he helped to finance the development of <a href="videotape">videotape</a>, bought television stations, bred racehorses, and co-owned the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> baseball team.

Crosby was born on May 3, 1903 in <a href="Tacoma%2C%20Washington">Tacoma, Washington</a>, in a house his father built at 1112 North J Street. In 1906, his family moved to <a href="Spokane%2C%20Washington">Spokane</a>, and in 1913, his father built a house at 508 E. Sharp Avenue. The house sits on the campus of <a href="Gonzaga%20University">Gonzaga University</a>, his alma mater.

He was the fourth of seven children: brothers <a href="Larry%20Crosby">Larry</a> (1895–1975), Everett (1896–1966), Ted (1900–1973), and <a href="Bob%20Crosby">Bob</a> (1913–1993); and two sisters, Catherine (1904–1974) and Mary Rose (1906–1990). His parents were Harry Lowe Crosby Sr. (1870–1950), a bookkeeper, and Catherine Helen "Kate" (née Harrigan; 1873–1964). His mother was a second generation Irish-American. His father was of English descent; an ancestor, Simon Crosby, emigrated to America in the 17th century, and one of his descendants married a descendant of "<a href="Mayflower">Mayflower</a>" passenger <a href="William%20Brewster%20%28pilgrim%29">William Brewster</a> (c. 1567 – April 10, 1644).

In 1910, seven-year-old Harry Crosby Jr. was forever renamed. The Sunday edition of the "<a href="Spokesman-Review">Spokesman-Review</a>" published a feature called "The Bingville Bugle." Written by humorist Newton Newkirk, "The Bingville Bugle" was a parody of a hillbilly newsletter, filled with gossip, minstrel quips, creative spelling, and mock ads. A neighbor, 15-year-old Valentine Hobart, shared his enthusiasm for "The Bugle," and noting his laugh, took a liking to him and called him "Bingo from Bingville." Eventually, the last vowel was dropped and the nickname stuck.

In 1917, Crosby took a summer job as property boy at Spokane's "Auditorium," where he witnessed some of the finest acts of the day, including <a href="Al%20Jolson">Al Jolson</a>, who held him spellbound with ad libbing and parodies of <a href="Hawaiian%20music">Hawaiian songs</a>. He later described Jolson's delivery as "electric."

Crosby graduated from Gonzaga High School (today's <a href="Gonzaga%20Preparatory%20School">Gonzaga Prep</a>) in 1920 and enrolled at Gonzaga University. He attended Gonzaga for three years but did not earn a degree. As a freshman, he played on the university's baseball team. The university granted him an honorary doctorate in 1937.

In 1923, Crosby was invited to join a new band composed of high school students a few years younger than himself. Al Rinker, Miles Rinker, James Heaton, Claire Pritchard and Robert Pritchard, along with drummer Crosby, formed the Musicaladers, who performed at dances both for high school students and club-goers. The group performed on Spokane radio station <a href="The%20Davenport%20Hotel%20%28Spokane%2C%20Washington%29">KHQ</a>, but disbanded after two years. Crosby and Al Rinker then obtained work at the Clemmer Theatre in Spokane (now known as the <a href="Bing%20Crosby%20Theater">Bing Crosby Theater</a>). Crosby was initially a member of a vocal trio called 'The Three Harmony Aces' with Al Rinker accompanying on piano from the pit, to entertain between the films. Bing and Al continued at the Clemmer Theatre for several months often with three other men – Wee Georgie Crittenden, Frank McBride and Lloyd Grinnell – and they were billed as 'The Clemmer Trio' or 'The Clemmer Entertainers' depending who performed.

In October 1925, Crosby and his partner <a href="Al%20Rinker">Al Rinker</a>, brother of singer <a href="Mildred%20Bailey">Mildred Bailey</a>, decided to seek fame in California. They traveled to Los Angeles where they met up with Mildred Bailey. She introduced them to her show business contacts, and the Fanchon and Marco Time Agency hired them for thirteen weeks for a revue called The Syncopation Idea, starting at the Boulevard Theater in Los Angeles and then on the Loew's circuit. They each earned $75 a week. Bing and Al Rinker began as a minor part of The Syncopation Idea and it was there that they started to develop as entertainers. They had a lively and individual style and were particularly popular with college students. After The Syncopation Idea closed, Bing and Al worked in the Will Morrissey Music Hall Revue. They further honed their skills with Morrissey, and blossomed when they subsequently had the chance to present their own independent act, and were quickly spotted by the <a href="Paul%20Whiteman">Paul Whiteman</a> organization. At that time, it was felt that Whiteman needed something different and entertaining to break up his musical selections, and Crosby and Rinker filled this requirement. After less than a year in full-time show business, they had become part of one of the biggest names in the entertainment world. Hired for $150 a week in 1926, they debuted with Whiteman on December 6 at the <a href="Tivoli%20Theatre%20%28Chicago%29">Tivoli Theatre</a> in Chicago. Their first recording, in October 1926, was "I've Got the Girl", with Don Clark's Orchestra, but the Columbia-issued record did them no vocal favors, as it was inadvertently recorded at a speed slower than it should have been, which increased the singers' pitch when played at 78 rpm. Throughout his career, Crosby often credited Mildred Bailey for getting him his first important job in the entertainment business.

Initial successes with Whiteman were followed by disaster when they reached New York and for a while Whiteman must have thought of letting them go. Possibly Bing might have been retained as Whiteman was already using him as a solo performer on record, but the prospects for Rinker must have been bleak. However, the addition of pianist and aspiring songwriter <a href="Harry%20Barris">Harry Barris</a> made all the difference to the act and "<a href="The%20Rhythm%20Boys">The Rhythm Boys</a>" were born. The additional voice meant that the boys could be heard more easily in the large New York theaters and they quickly became a real success. A year touring with Whiteman performing and recording with musicians <a href="Bix%20Beiderbecke">Bix Beiderbecke</a>, <a href="Jack%20Teagarden">Jack Teagarden</a>, <a href="Tommy%20Dorsey">Tommy Dorsey</a>, <a href="Jimmy%20Dorsey">Jimmy Dorsey</a>, <a href="Eddie%20Lang">Eddie Lang</a> and <a href="Hoagy%20Carmichael">Hoagy Carmichael</a>, provided valuable experience and then they were sent out on tour alone. Much has been written about the escapades of the three men during this period and clearly they were living life to the full. Despite all of this, Bing was continuing to develop and when the Rhythm Boys rejoined the Whiteman troupe in 1929, he had matured considerably as a performer. He was constantly in demand as a solo artist on record and radio.

Crosby soon became the star attraction of <a href="the%20Rhythm%20Boys">the Rhythm Boys</a>, and in 1928 he had his first number one hit with the Whiteman orchestra, a jazz-influenced rendition of "<a href="Ol%27%20Man%20River">Ol' Man River</a>". In 1929, <a href="the%20Rhythm%20Boys">the Rhythm Boys</a> appeared in the film <a href="The%20King%20of%20Jazz">The King of Jazz</a> with Whiteman but Bing's growing dissatisfaction with Whiteman led to <a href="the%20Rhythm%20Boys">the Rhythm Boys</a> leaving his organization. They joined the <a href="Gus%20Arnheim">Gus Arnheim</a> Orchestra performing nightly in The <a href="Ambassador%20Hotel%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">Coconut Grove</a> of the Ambassador Hotel. Singing with the Arnheim Orchestra, Bing's solos began to steal the show, while the Rhythm Boys act gradually became redundant. Harry Barris wrote several of Crosby's subsequent hits including "At Your Command", "<a href="I%20Surrender%20Dear">I Surrender Dear</a>", and "<a href="Wrap%20Your%20Troubles%20In%20Dreams%20%28song%29">Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams</a>". In the early months of 1931, a solo recording contract came Bing's way, <a href="Mack%20Sennett">Mack Sennett</a> signed him to make film shorts and a break with the Rhythm Boys became almost inevitable. Bing had married Dixie Lee in September 1930 and after a threatened divorce in March 1931, he started to apply himself seriously to his career. His gramophone records in 1931 broke new ground as his powerful and emotional singing started to change the face of popular music forever.

Their low salaries at the Cocoanut Grove of the Ambassador Hotel had led the Rhythm Boys to walk out, causing union problems for Bing. Bing's brother, Everett, interested <a href="Bill%20Paley">Bill Paley</a> of CBS in his brother and Paley beckoned Bing to come to New York. A settlement was reached with the Ambassador Hotel and Bing made his first solo national radio broadcast in September 1931 and then went on to star at the New York Paramount Theatre.

On September 2, 1931, Crosby made his <a href="15%20Minutes%20with%20Bing%20Crosby">solo radio debut</a>. Before the end of the year, he signed with both <a href="Brunswick%20Records">Brunswick Records</a> and <a href="CBS%20Radio">CBS Radio</a>. Doing a weekly 15-minute radio broadcast, Crosby quickly became a huge hit. His songs "<a href="Out%20of%20Nowhere%20%28Johnny%20Green%20song%29">Out of Nowhere</a>", "Just One More Chance", "<a href="At%20Your%20Command">At Your Command</a>" and "<a href="I%20Found%20a%20Million%20Dollar%20Baby%20%28in%20a%20Five%20and%20Ten%20Cent%20Store%29">I Found a Million Dollar Baby (in a Five and Ten Cent Store)</a>" were all among the best selling songs of 1931.

As the 1930s unfolded, Crosby became the leading singer in America. Ten of the top 50 songs for 1931 featured Crosby, either solo or with others. A so-called "Battle of the Baritones" with singing star <a href="Russ%20Columbo">Russ Columbo</a> proved short-lived, replaced with the slogan "Bing Was King". Crosby played the lead in a series of sound-era <a href="I%20Surrender%20Dear%20%281931%20film%29">musical comedy short films</a> for <a href="Mack%20Sennett">Mack Sennett</a>, signed with Paramount and starred in his first full-length feature, 1932's "<a href="The%20Big%20Broadcast">The Big Broadcast</a>", the first of 55 films in which he received top billing. He would appear in 79 pictures, and signed a long-term deal with <a href="Jack%20Kapp">Jack Kapp</a>'s new record company <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca</a> in late 1934.

His first commercial sponsor on radio was <a href="15%20Minutes%20with%20Bing%20Crosby%23Bing%20Crosby%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Cremo%20Singer">Cremo Cigars</a> and increasingly his fame spread nationwide. After a long run in New York, Bing went back to Hollywood to film <a href="The%20Big%20Broadcast">The Big Broadcast</a> and his personal appearances, his records, and his radio work substantially increased his impact. The success of his first full-length film brought him a contract with Paramount and he began a regular pattern of making three films a year. On radio, he fronted his own show for <a href="Bing%20Crosby%20Entertains">Woodbury Soap</a> for two seasons and gradually his live appearances dwindled. His records produced hit after hit at a time when record sales generally were in decline because of the Depression. Critically acclaimed audio engineer <a href="Steve%20Hoffman%20%28audio%20engineer%29">Steve Hoffman</a> once stated: "By the way, Bing actually saved the record business in 1934 when he agreed to support Decca founder Jack Kapp's crazy idea of lowering the price of singles from a dollar to 35 cents and getting a royalty for records sold instead of a flat fee. Bing's name and his artistry saved the recording industry. All the other artists signed to Decca after Bing did. Without him, Jack Kapp wouldn't have had a chance in hell of making Decca work and the Great Depression would have wiped out phonograph records for good." His social life was hectic, his first son <a href="Gary%20Crosby%20%28actor%29">Gary</a> was born in 1933 with twin boys following in 1934. By 1936, he'd replaced his former boss, <a href="Paul%20Whiteman">Paul Whiteman</a>, as host of the prestigious NBC radio program "<a href="Kraft%20Music%20Hall">Kraft Music Hall</a>", the weekly radio program where he remained for the next ten years. "<a href="Where%20the%20Blue%20of%20the%20Night%20%28Meets%20the%20Gold%20of%20the%20Day%29">Where the Blue of the Night (Meets the Gold of the Day)</a>", which showcased one of his then-trademark <a href="whistling">whistling</a> interludes, became his theme song and signature tune.

Also in 1936, Crosby exercised an option from Paramount to make a film out-of-house. Quickly signed to a one-picture agreement with Columbia, Crosby dreamt of having his icon and friend <a href="Louis%20Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a>, an African-American, who largely influenced his singing style, in a screen adaptation of "The Peacock Feather" called <a href="Pennies%20from%20Heaven%20%281936%20film%29">Pennies from Heaven</a>. Crosby talked to <a href="Harry%20Cohn">Harry Cohn</a> about the matter, but he disagreed saying: "... no reason to entail the expense of flying him in and having no desire to negotiate with Armstrong's crude, mob-linked but devoted manager, <a href="Joe%20Glaser">Joe Glaser</a>." Bing threatened to walk out on the film and refused to discuss it with Cohn. Armstrong's musical scenes, along with some comical dialogue as well, heightened his career. Bing also had it that Armstrong made high billing alongside his white co-stars, one of the first times ever for a black performer in a wide-audience film. He starred as himself in many more films to come and had a large appreciation for Bing's unracist views, often thanking him in his later years.

Crosby's much-imitated style helped take popular singing beyond the kind of "<a href="belt%20%28music%29">belting</a>" associated with boisterous performers like <a href="Al%20Jolson">Al Jolson</a> and <a href="Billy%20Murray%20%28singer%29">Billy Murray</a>, who had been obliged to reach the back seats in New York theaters without the aid of the microphone. As <a href="Henry%20Pleasants%20%28music%20critic%29">Henry Pleasants</a> noted in "The Great American Popular Singers", something new had entered American music, a style that might be called "singing in American" with conversational ease. This new sound led to the popular epithet "<a href="crooner">crooner</a>".

During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, Crosby made numerous live appearances before American troops fighting in the <a href="European%20Theater%20of%20Operations">European Theater</a>. He also learned how to pronounce German from written scripts and would read propaganda broadcasts intended for the German forces. The nickname "Der Bingle" was common among Crosby's German listeners and came to be used by his English-speaking fans. In a poll of U.S. troops at the close of World War II, Crosby topped the list as the person who had done the most for G.I. morale, ahead of President <a href="Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a>, General <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>, and <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a>.

The June 18, 1945, issue of "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine stated: "America's number one star, Bing Crosby, has won more fans, made more money than any entertainer in history. Today he is a kind of national institution." They also state: "In all, 60,000,000 Crosby disks have been marketed since he made his first record in 1931. His biggest best seller is White Christmas, 2,000,000 impressions of which have been sold in the U.S. and 250,000 in Great Britain." They go on to say: "Nine out of ten singers and bandleaders listen to Crosby's broadcasts each Thursday night and follow his lead. The day after he sings a song over the air – any song – some 50,000 copies of it are sold throughout the U.S. Time and again Crosby has taken some new or unknown ballad, has given it what is known in trade circles as the "big goose" and made it a hit single-handed and overnight." and "Precisely what the future holds for Crosby neither his family nor his friends can conjecture. He has achieved greater popularity, made more money, attracted vaster audiences than any other entertainer in history. And his star is still in the ascendant. His contract with Decca runs until 1955. His contract with Paramount runs until 1954. Records which he made ten years ago are selling better than ever before. The nation's appetite for Crosby's voice and personality appears insatiable. To soldiers overseas and to foreigners he has become a kind of symbol of America, of the amiable, humorous citizen of a free land. Crosby, however, seldom bothers to contemplate his future. For one thing, he enjoys hearing himself sing, and if ever a day should dawn when the public wearies of him, he will complacently go right on singing – to himself."

The biggest hit song of Crosby's career was his recording of <a href="Irving%20Berlin">Irving Berlin</a>'s "<a href="White%20Christmas%20%28song%29">White Christmas</a>", which he introduced on a Christmas Day radio broadcast in 1941. (A copy of the recording from the radio program is owned by the estate of Bing Crosby and was loaned to "<a href="CBS%20Sunday%20Morning">CBS Sunday Morning</a>" for their December 25, 2011, program.) The song then appeared in his 1942 movie "<a href="Holiday%20Inn%20%28film%29">Holiday Inn</a>". His record hit the charts on October 3, 1942, and rose to No. 1 on October 31, where it stayed for 11 weeks. A holiday perennial, the song was repeatedly re-released by Decca, charting another 16 times. It topped the charts again in 1945 and for a third time in January 1947. The song remains the bestselling single of all time. According to "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a>", his recording of "White Christmas" has sold over 100 million copies around the world, with at least 50 million sales as singles. His recording was so popular that he was obliged to re-record it in 1947 using the same musicians and backup singers; the original 1942 master had become damaged due to its frequent use in pressing additional singles. Though the two versions are similar, the 1947 recording is most familiar today. After his death in 1977, the song was re-released and reached the No. 5 position in the UK Singles Chart in December 1977. Crosby was dismissive of his role in the song's success, saying "a jackdaw with a cleft palate could have sung it successfully."

Crosby starred with <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a> and <a href="Dorothy%20Lamour">Dorothy Lamour</a> in seven "<a href="Road%20to">Road to</a>" musical comedies between 1940 and 1962, cementing Crosby and Hope as an on-and-off duo, despite never officially declaring themselves a "team" in the sense that <a href="Laurel%20and%20Hardy">Laurel and Hardy</a> or <a href="Martin%20and%20Lewis">Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis</a> were teams. The series consists of "<a href="Road%20to%20Singapore">Road to Singapore</a>" (1940), "<a href="Road%20to%20Zanzibar">Road to Zanzibar</a>" (1941), "<a href="Road%20to%20Morocco">Road to Morocco</a>" (1942), "<a href="Road%20to%20Utopia">Road to Utopia</a>" (1946), "<a href="Road%20to%20Rio">Road to Rio</a>" (1947), "<a href="Road%20to%20Bali">Road to Bali</a>" (1952), and "<a href="The%20Road%20to%20Hong%20Kong">The Road to Hong Kong</a>" (1962). When they appeared solo, Crosby and Hope frequently made note of the other in a comically insulting fashion. They performed together many times on stage, radio, film, and television.
In the 1949 Disney animated film "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Ichabod%20and%20Mr.%20Toad">The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad</a>", Crosby provided the narration and song vocals for "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" segment, and again in the October 1977 animated Disney film "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Ichabod%20and%20Mr.%20Toad">The Many Adventures of Ichabod</a> <a href="The%20Many%20Adventures%20of%20Winnie%20the%20Pooh">and Winnie the Pooh</a>".

In 1960, he starred in "<a href="High%20Time%20%28film%29">High Time</a>", a collegiate comedy with <a href="Fabian%20Forte">Fabian Forte</a> and <a href="Tuesday%20Weld">Tuesday Weld</a> that predicted the emerging gap between him and the new young generation of musicians and actors who had begun their careers after WWII. The following year, Crosby and Hope reunited for one more "Road" movie, "<a href="The%20Road%20to%20Hong%20Kong">The Road to Hong Kong</a>", which teamed them up with the much younger <a href="Joan%20Collins">Joan Collins</a> and <a href="Peter%20Sellers">Peter Sellers</a>. Collins was used in place of their longtime partner Dorothy Lamour, whom Crosby felt was getting too old for the role, though Hope refused to do the movie without her, and she instead made a cameo appearance. Shortly before his death in 1977, he had planned another "Road" film in which he, Hope, and Lamour search for the Fountain of Youth.

He won an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a> for "<a href="Going%20My%20Way">Going My Way</a>" in 1944 and was nominated for the 1945 sequel, "<a href="The%20Bells%20of%20St.%20Mary%27s">The Bells of St. Mary's</a>". He received critical acclaim for his performance as an alcoholic entertainer in "<a href="The%20Country%20Girl%20%281954%20film%29">The Country Girl</a>" and received his third Academy Award nomination.

"The Fireside Theater" (1950) was his first television production. The series of 26-minute shows was filmed at <a href="Hal%20Roach%23Hal%20Roach%20Studios">Hal Roach Studios</a> rather than performed live on the air. The "telefilms" were syndicated to individual television stations. He was a frequent guest on the musical variety shows of the 1950s and 1960s. He was associated with ABC's "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Palace">The Hollywood Palace</a>". He was the show's first and most frequent guest host and appeared annually on its Christmas edition with his wife Kathryn and his younger children. In the early 1970s, he made two late appearances on the "<a href="Flip%20Wilson%20Show">Flip Wilson Show</a>", singing duets with the comedian. His last TV appearance was a Christmas special filmed in London in September 1977 and aired weeks after his death. It was on this special that he recorded a duet of "<a href="The%20Little%20Drummer%20Boy">The Little Drummer Boy</a>" and "Peace on Earth" with rock star <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>. Their duet was released in 1982 as a single 45-rpm record and reached No. 3 in the UK singles charts. It has since become a staple of holiday radio and the final popular hit of Crosby's career. At the end of the 20th century, "TV Guide" listed the Crosby-Bowie duet as one of the 25 most memorable musical moments of 20th-century television.

Bing Crosby Productions, affiliated with <a href="Desilu%20Studios">Desilu Studios</a> and later <a href="CBS%20Television%20Studios">CBS Television Studios</a>, produced a number of television series, including Crosby's own unsuccessful ABC sitcom "<a href="The%20Bing%20Crosby%20Show">The Bing Crosby Show</a>" in the 1964–1965 season (with co-stars <a href="Beverly%20Garland">Beverly Garland</a> and <a href="Frank%20McHugh">Frank McHugh</a>). The company produced two ABC medical dramas, "<a href="Ben%20Casey">Ben Casey</a>" (1961–1966) and "<a href="Breaking%20Point%20%281963%20TV%20series%29">Breaking Point</a>" (1963–1964), the popular "<a href="Hogan%27s%20Heroes">Hogan's Heroes</a>" (1965–1971) military comedy on CBS, as well as the lesser-known show "<a href="Slattery%27s%20People">Slattery's People</a>" (1964–1965).

Crosby was one of the first singers to exploit the intimacy of the microphone, rather than using the deep, loud "vaudeville style" associated with <a href="Al%20Jolson">Al Jolson</a> and others. He was, by his own definition, a "phraser" or a singer who placed equal emphasis on both the lyrics and the music. Crosby's love and appreciation of jazz music helped bring the genre to a wider mainstream audience. Within the framework of the novelty-singing style of <a href="the%20Rhythm%20Boys">the Rhythm Boys</a>, Crosby bent notes and added off-tune phrasing, an approach that was firmly rooted in jazz. He had already been introduced to <a href="Louis%20Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a> and <a href="Bessie%20Smith">Bessie Smith</a> prior to his first appearance on record. Crosby and Armstrong would remain professionally friendly for decades, notably in the 1956 film "<a href="High%20Society%20%281956%20film%29">High Society</a>", where they sang the duet "Now You Has Jazz".

During the early portion of his solo career (about 1931–1934), Crosby's emotional, often pleading style of <a href="crooning">crooning</a> was widely popular. But <a href="Jack%20Kapp">Jack Kapp</a> (manager of <a href="Brunswick%20Records">Brunswick</a> and later <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca</a>) talked Crosby into dropping many of his jazzier mannerisms, in favor of a straight-ahead clear vocal style. Crosby credited Kapp for choosing hit songs, working with many other artists, and most importantly, diversifying his repertoire into various styles and genres. This approach's wide appeal helped Crosby become highly successful, charting number-one hits in the genres of <a href="Christmas%20music">Christmas music</a>, <a href="Hawaiian%20music">Hawaiian music</a> and <a href="Country%20music">Country music</a>, as well as top-thirty hits in <a href="Irish%20music">Irish music</a>, <a href="French%20popular%20music">French music</a>, <a href="Rhythm%20and%20blues">Rhythm and blues</a>, as well as <a href="Ballad">Ballad</a> songs.
Crosby also elaborated on a further idea of <a href="Al%20Jolson">Al Jolson</a>'s: phrasing, or the art of making a song's <a href="lyrics">lyric</a> ring true. His success in doing so was influential. "I used to tell <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Sinatra</a> over and over," said <a href="Tommy%20Dorsey">Tommy Dorsey</a>, "there's only one singer you ought to listen to and his name is Crosby. All that matters to him is the words, and that's the only thing that ought to for you, too."

Vocal critic <a href="Henry%20Pleasants%20%28music%20critic%29">Henry Pleasants</a> wrote:
[While] the octave B flat to B flat in Bing's voice at that time [1930s] is, to my ears, one of the loveliest I have heard in forty-five years of listening to baritones, both classical and popular, it dropped conspicuously in later years. From the mid-1950s, Bing was more comfortable in a bass range while maintaining a baritone quality, with the best octave being G to G, or even F to F. In a recording he made of '<a href="Dardanella">Dardanella</a>' with <a href="Louis%20Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a> in 1960, he attacks lightly and easily on a low E flat. This is lower than most opera basses care to venture, and they tend to sound as if they were in the cellar when they get there.

Crosby's was among the most popular and successful musical acts of the 20th century. Although "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine operated under different methodologies for the bulk of Crosby's career, his chart numbers remain astonishing: 396 chart singles, including 41 No. 1 hits. If the multiple times "White Christmas" charted are counted, that would bring that number up to 43 – more than <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a> and <a href="Elvis">Elvis</a> combined. Crosby had separate charting singles in every calendar year between 1931 and 1954; the annual re-release of "White Christmas" extended that streak to 1957. He had 24 separate popular singles in 1939 alone. It is widely believed that Crosby is the best selling recording artist ever, with plus or minus 1 billion units sold. Statistician <a href="Joel%20Whitburn">Joel Whitburn</a> at "Billboard" determined that Crosby was America's most successful recording act of the 1930s and again in the 1940s.

For 15 years (1934, 1937, 1940, 1943–1954), Crosby was among the top 10 in box-office drawing power, and for five of those years (1944–1948) he topped the world. He sang four <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Award</a>-winning songs – "Sweet Leilani" (1937), "White Christmas" (1942), "<a href="Swinging%20on%20a%20Star">Swinging on a Star</a>" (1944), "In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening" (1951) – and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in "<a href="Going%20My%20Way">Going My Way</a>" (1944).

A survey in 2000 found that with 1,077,900,000 movie tickets sold, Crosby was the third most popular actor of all time, behind <a href="Clark%20Gable">Clark Gable</a> (1,168,300,000) and <a href="John%20Wayne">John Wayne</a> (1,114,000,000). The "International Motion Picture Almanac" lists him in a tie for second on the "All Time Number One Stars List" with <a href="Clint%20Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>, <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a>, and <a href="Burt%20Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a>. His most popular film, "<a href="White%20Christmas%20%28film%29">White Christmas</a>", grossed $30 million in 1954 ($ million in current value). 

He received 23 gold and platinum records, according to the book "Million Selling Records". The Recording Industry Association of America did not institute its gold record certification program until 1958, by which point Crosby's record sales were barely a blip. Before that, gold records were awarded by an artist's own record company. Universal Music, current owner of Crosby's Decca catalog, has never requested RIAA certification for any of his hit singles.

Crosby charted 23 "Billboard" hits from 47 recorded songs with the <a href="Andrews%20Sisters">Andrews Sisters</a>, whose Decca record sales were second only to Crosby's throughout the 1940s. Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne were his most frequent collaborators on disc from 1939 to 1952—a partnership that produced four million-selling singles: "<a href="Pistol%20Packin%27%20Mama">Pistol Packin' Mama</a>", "<a href="Jingle%20Bells">Jingle Bells</a>", "<a href="Don%27t%20Fence%20Me%20In%20%28song%29">Don't Fence Me In</a>", and "South America, Take it Away". They made one film appearance together in "<a href="Road%20to%20Rio">Road to Rio</a>" singing "You Don't Have to Know the Language", and sang together countless times on radio shows throughout the 1940s and 1950s. They appeared as guests on each other's shows quite often, as well as on many shows for the <a href="Armed%20Forces%20Radio%20Service">Armed Forces Radio Service</a> during and after World War II. The quartet's Top-10 "Billboard" hits from 1943 to 1945 including "The Vict'ry Polka", "There'll Be a Hot Time in the Town of Berlin (When the Yanks Go Marching In)", and "Is You Is or Is You Ain't (Ma' Baby?)" were major morale-boosters for the American public during the war years.

In 1962, Crosby was given the <a href="Grammy%20Lifetime%20Achievement%20Award">Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award</a>. He has been inducted into the halls of fame for both radio and popular music. In 2007 Crosby was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame, and in 2008 into the Western Music Hall of Fame.

During the <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20Radio">Golden Age of Radio</a>, performers had to create their shows live, sometimes even redoing the program a second time for the west coast time zone. Crosby's radio career took a significant turn in 1945, when he clashed with NBC over his insistence that he be allowed to pre-record his radio shows. (The live production of radio shows was also reinforced by the musicians' union and <a href="ASCAP">ASCAP</a>, which wanted to ensure continued work for their members.) In "On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio", historian John Dunning wrote about German engineers having developed a tape recorder with a near-professional <a href="broadcast%20quality">broadcast quality</a> standard:
[Crosby saw] an enormous advantage in prerecording his radio shows. The scheduling could now be done at the star's convenience. He could do four shows a week, if he chose, and then take a month off. But the networks and sponsors were adamantly opposed. The public wouldn't stand for 'canned' radio, the networks argued. There was something magic for listeners in the fact that what they were hearing was being performed and heard everywhere, at that precise instant. Some of the best moments in comedy came when a line was blown and the star had to rely on wit to rescue a bad situation. <a href="Fred%20Allen">Fred Allen</a>, <a href="Jack%20Benny">Jack Benny</a>, <a href="Phil%20Harris">Phil Harris</a>, and also Crosby were masters at this, and the networks weren't about to give it up easily.

Crosby's insistence eventually factored into the further development of <a href="magnetic%20tape%20sound%20recording">magnetic tape sound recording</a> and the radio industry's widespread adoption of it. He used his clout, both professional and financial, to innovate new methods of reproducing audio of his performances. But NBC (and competitor CBS) were also insistent, refusing to air prerecorded radio programs. Crosby walked away from the network and stayed off the air for seven months, creating a legal battle with <a href="Kraft%20Foods">Kraft</a>, his sponsor, that was settled out of court. Crosby returned to the air for the last 13 weeks of the 1945–1946 season.

The <a href="Mutual%20Broadcasting%20System">Mutual</a> network, on the other hand, had pre-recorded some of its programs as early as the 1938 run of "<a href="The%20Shadow">The Shadow</a>" with <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a>. And the new <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> network, which had been formed out of the sale of the old <a href="NBC%20Blue%20Network">NBC Blue Network</a> in 1943 following a federal <a href="anti-trust">anti-trust</a> action, was willing to join Mutual in breaking the tradition. ABC offered Crosby $30,000 per week to produce a recorded show every Wednesday that would be sponsored by <a href="Philco">Philco</a>. He would also get an additional $40,000 from 400 independent stations for the rights to broadcast the 30-minute show, which was sent to them every Monday on three 16-inch lacquer/<a href="aluminum%20disc">aluminum disc</a>s that played ten minutes per side at 33⅓ rpm.

Crosby wanted to change to recorded production for several reasons. The legend that has been most often told is that it would give him more time for his golf game. And he did record his first Philco program in August 1947 so he could enter the <a href="Jasper%20National%20Park">Jasper National Park</a> Invitational Golf Tournament in September, just when the new radio season was to start. But golf was not the most important reason.

Though Crosby did want more time to tend to his other business and leisure activities, he also sought better quality through recording, including being able to eliminate mistakes and control the timing of his show performances. Because his own Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the latest and best sound equipment and arrange the <a href="microphones">microphones</a> his way; the logistics of microphone placement had long been a hotly debated issue in every recording studio since the beginning of the electrical era. No longer would he have to wear the hated toupee on his head previously required by <a href="CBS">CBS</a> and <a href="NBC">NBC</a> for his live audience shows (he preferred a hat). He could also record short promotions for his latest investment, the world's first frozen orange juice, sold under the brand name <a href="Minute%20Maid">Minute Maid</a>. This investment allowed Crosby to make more money by finding a loophole whereby the IRS couldn't tax him at a 77% rate.

The transcription method posed problems, however. The acetate surface coating of the aluminum discs was little better than the wax that Edison had used at the turn of the 20th century, with the same limited dynamic range and frequency response.

However, Murdo MacKenzie of Bing Crosby Enterprises had seen a demonstration of the German <a href="Magnetophon">Magnetophon</a> in June 1947—the same device that <a href="Jack%20Mullin">Jack Mullin</a> had brought back from Radio Frankfurt, along with 50 reels of tape, at the end of the war. It was one of the magnetic tape recorders that BASF and AEG had built in Germany starting in 1935. The 6.5mm ferric-oxide-coated tape could record 20 minutes per reel of high-quality sound. <a href="Alexander%20M.%20Poniatoff">Alexander M. Poniatoff</a> ordered his <a href="Ampex">Ampex company</a>, which he'd founded in 1944, to manufacture an improved version of the Magnetophone.

Crosby hired Mullin to start recording his "Philco Radio Time" show on his German-made machine in August 1947, using the same 50 reels of I.G. Farben magnetic tape that Mullin had found at a radio station at <a href="Bad%20Nauheim">Bad Nauheim</a> near <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> while working for the U.S. Army Signal Corps. The crucial advantage was editing. As Crosby wrote in his autobiography:
By using tape, I could do a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit it down to the twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or situations that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.

Mullin's 1976 memoir of these early days of experimental recording agrees with Crosby's account:
In the evening, Crosby did the whole show before an audience. If he muffed a song then, the audience loved it—thought it was very funny—but we would have to take out the show version and put in one of the rehearsal takes. Sometimes, if Crosby was having fun with a song and not really working at it, we had to make it up out of two or three parts. This <a href="Ad%20libitum">ad lib</a> way of working is commonplace in the recording studios today, but it was all new to us.

Crosby invested US$50,000 in <a href="Ampex">Ampex</a> with an eye towards producing more machines. In 1948, the second season of Philco shows was taped with the new Ampex Model 200 tape recorder using the new Scotch 111 tape from the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (<a href="3M">3M</a>) company. Mullin explained how one new broadcasting technique was invented on the Crosby show with these machines:
One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, was on the show, and he threw in a few of his folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script. Today they wouldn't seem very off-color, but things were different on radio then. They got enormous laughs, which just went on and on. We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.
Crosby had launched the tape recorder revolution in America. In his 1950 film "<a href="Mr.%20Music">Mr. Music</a>", Crosby is seen singing into one of the new Ampex tape recorders that reproduced his voice better than anything else. Also quick to adopt tape recording was his friend <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a>. He gave one of the first Ampex Model 300 recorders to his friend, musician <a href="Les%20Paul">Les Paul</a>, which led directly to Paul's invention of <a href="multitrack%20recording">multitrack recording</a>. His organization, the Crosby Research Foundation, also held various tape recording patents and developed equipment and recording techniques such as the <a href="laugh%20track">laugh track</a> that are still in use today.

Along with <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>, Crosby was also one of the principal backers behind the famous <a href="United%20Western%20Recorders">United Western Recorders</a> recording studio complex in Los Angeles.

Mullin continued to work for Crosby to develop a <a href="videotape%20recorder">videotape recorder</a> (VTR). Television production was mostly <a href="live%20television">live television</a> in its early years, but Crosby wanted the same ability to record that he had achieved in radio. 1950's "The Fireside Theater", sponsored by <a href="Procter%20%26amp%3B%20Gamble">Procter & Gamble</a>, was his first television production. Mullin had not yet succeeded with <a href="videotape">videotape</a>, so Crosby filmed the series of 26-minute shows at the Hal Roach Studios, and the "telefilms" were <a href="broadcast%20syndication">syndicated</a> to individual television stations.

Crosby continued to finance the development of videotape. Bing Crosby Enterprises (BCE) gave the world's first demonstration of videotape recording in Los Angeles on November 11, 1951. Developed by <a href="Jack%20Mullin">John T. Mullin</a> and Wayne R. Johnson since 1950, the device aired what were described as "blurred and indistinct" images, using a modified <a href="Ampex">Ampex</a> 200 tape recorder and standard quarter-inch (6.3 mm) audio tape moving at 360 inches (9.1 m) per second.

A Crosby-led group purchased station <a href="KCOP-TV">KCOP-TV</a>, in <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles, California</a>, in 1954. <a href="NAFI%20Corporation">NAFI Corporation</a> and Crosby together purchased the television station <a href="KPTV">KPTV</a>, in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, for $4 million on September 1, 1959. In 1960, NAFI purchased KCOP from Crosby's group. In the early 1950s, Crosby helped establish the <a href="CBS">CBS television</a> affiliate in his hometown of <a href="Spokane%2C%20Washington">Spokane, Washington</a>. He partnered with <a href="Ed%20Craney">Ed Craney</a>, who owned the <a href="CBS%20radio">CBS radio</a> affiliate, <a href="KXLY%20%28AM%29">KXLY (AM)</a>, and built a television studio just west of Crosby's alma mater, <a href="Gonzaga%20University">Gonzaga University</a>. Once it begin broadcasting, the station was sold within the year to Northern Pacific Radio and Television Corp.

Crosby was a fan of <a href="Thoroughbred%20horse%20race">thoroughbred horse racing</a> and bought his first racehorse in 1935. In 1937, he became a founding partner of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club and a member of its Board of Directors. Operating from the <a href="Del%20Mar%20Racetrack">Del Mar Racetrack</a> at <a href="Del%20Mar%2C%20California">Del Mar, California</a>, the group included millionaire businessman <a href="Charles%20S.%20Howard">Charles S. Howard</a>, who owned a successful racing stable that included <a href="Seabiscuit">Seabiscuit</a>. Charles' son, <a href="Lindsay%20C.%20Howard">Lindsay C. Howard</a> became one of Crosby's closest friends; Crosby named his son <a href="Lindsay%20Crosby">Lindsay</a> after him, and would purchase his 40-room <a href="Hillsborough%2C%20California">Hillsborough, California</a> estate from Lindsay in 1965.

Crosby and Lindsay Howard formed <a href="Binglin%20Stable">Binglin Stable</a> to race and breed thoroughbred horses at a ranch in <a href="Moorpark%2C%20California">Moorpark</a> in <a href="Ventura%20County%2C%20California">Ventura County, California</a>. They also established the Binglin stock farm in Argentina, where they raced horses at Hipódromo de Palermo in <a href="Palermo%2C%20Buenos%20Aires">Palermo, Buenos Aires</a>. A number of Argentine-bred horses were purchased and shipped to race in the United States. On August 12, 1938, the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club hosted a $25,000 winner-take-all <a href="match%20race">match race</a> won by Charles S. Howard's <a href="Seabiscuit">Seabiscuit</a> over Binglin's horse Ligaroti. In 1943, Binglin's horse Don Bingo won the <a href="Suburban%20Handicap">Suburban Handicap</a> at <a href="Belmont%20Park">Belmont Park</a> in <a href="Elmont%2C%20New%20York">Elmont, New York</a>.

The Binglin Stable partnership came to an end in 1953 as a result of a liquidation of assets by Crosby, who needed to raise enough funds to pay the hefty federal and state inheritance taxes on his deceased wife's estate. The <a href="Bing%20Crosby%20Breeders%27%20Cup%20Handicap">Bing Crosby Breeders' Cup Handicap</a> at <a href="Del%20Mar%20Racetrack">Del Mar Racetrack</a> is named in his honor.

Crosby was also a co-owner of the British colt <a href="Meadow%20Court">Meadow Court</a>, with jockey <a href="Johnny%20Longden">Johnny Longden</a>'s friend <a href="Max%20Bell">Max Bell</a>. Meadow Court won the 1965 <a href="King%20George%20VI%20and%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20Stakes">King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes</a>, and the <a href="Irish%20Derby">Irish Derby</a>. In the Irish Derby's winner's circle at the <a href="Curragh">Curragh</a>, Crosby sang "When Irish Eyes Are Smiling".

Though Crosby's stables had some success, he often joked about his horse racing failures as part of his radio appearances. "Crosby's horse finally came in" became a running gag.

Crosby had an interest in sports. In the 1930s, his friend and former college classmate, <a href="Gonzaga%20Bulldogs%20football">Gonzaga</a> head coach <a href="Mike%20Pecarovich">Mike Pecarovich</a> appointed Crosby as an assistant football coach. From 1946 until the end of his life, he was part-owner of baseball's <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>. Although he was passionate about his team, he was too nervous to watch the deciding Game 7 of the <a href="1960%20World%20Series">1960 World Series</a>, choosing to go to Paris with Kathryn and listen to the game on the radio. Crosby had the <a href="NBC">NBC</a> telecast of the game recorded on <a href="kinescope">kinescope</a>. The game was one of the most famous in baseball history, capped off by <a href="Bill%20Mazeroski">Bill Mazeroski</a>'s <a href="walk-off%20home%20run">walk-off home run</a>. He apparently viewed the complete film just once, and then stored it in his wine cellar, where it remained undisturbed until it was discovered in December 2009. The restored broadcast was shown on <a href="MLB%20Network">MLB Network</a> in December 2010.

Crosby was also an avid golfer, and in 1978, he and Bob Hope were voted the <a href="Bob%20Jones%20Award">Bob Jones Award</a>, the highest honor given by the <a href="United%20States%20Golf%20Association">United States Golf Association</a> in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship. He is a member of the <a href="World%20Golf%20Hall%20of%20Fame">World Golf Hall of Fame</a>. In 1937, Crosby hosted the first 'Crosby Clambake' as it was popularly known, at Rancho Santa Fe Golf Club in <a href="Rancho%20Santa%20Fe%2C%20California">Rancho Santa Fe, California</a>, the event's location prior to World War II. Sam Snead won the first tournament, in which the first place check was for $500. After the war, the event resumed play in 1947 on golf courses in Pebble Beach, where it has been played ever since. Now the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, it has been a leading event in the world of professional golf.

Crosby first took up golf at 12 as a caddy, dropped it, and started again in 1930 with some fellow cast members in Hollywood during the filming of "<a href="The%20King%20of%20Jazz">The King of Jazz</a>". Crosby was accomplished at the sport, with a two handicap. He competed in both the <a href="The%20Amateur%20Championship">British</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Amateur%20Championship%20%28golf%29">U.S. Amateur</a> championships, was a five-time club champion at Lakeside Golf Club in Hollywood, and once made a hole-in-one on the 16th at <a href="Cypress%20Point%20Club">Cypress Point</a>.

Crosby was a keen fisherman especially in his younger days but it was a pastime that he enjoyed throughout his life. In the summer of 1966 he spent a week as the guest of Lord Egremont, staying in <a href="Cockermouth">Cockermouth</a> and fishing on the <a href="River%20Derwent%2C%20Cumbria">River Derwent</a>. His trip was filmed for "<a href="The%20American%20Sportsman">The American Sportsman</a>" on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>, although all did not go well at first as the <a href="salmon">salmon</a> were not running. He did make up for it at the end of the week by catching a number of <a href="sea%20trout">sea trout</a>.

Crosby was married twice. His first wife was actress/nightclub singer <a href="Dixie%20Lee">Dixie Lee</a>, to whom he was married from 1930 until her death from <a href="ovarian%20cancer">ovarian cancer</a> in 1952; they had four sons: <a href="Gary%20Crosby%20%28actor%29">Gary</a>, twins <a href="Dennis%20Crosby">Dennis</a> and <a href="Phillip%20Crosby">Phillip</a>, and <a href="Lindsay%20Crosby">Lindsay</a>. The 1947 <a href="Susan%20Hayward">Susan Hayward</a> film, "", is indirectly based on Lee's life. Bing and Dixie along with their children lived at 10500 Camarillo Street in North Hollywood for over five years. After her death, Crosby had relationships with model/Goldwyn Girl <a href="Pat%20Sheehan%20%28model%29">Pat Sheehan</a> (who married his son Dennis in 1958) and actresses <a href="Inger%20Stevens">Inger Stevens</a> and <a href="Grace%20Kelly">Grace Kelly</a> before marrying the actress <a href="Kathryn%20Crosby">Kathryn Grant</a>, who converted to Catholicism, in 1957. They had three children: <a href="Harry%20Crosby%20%28businessman%29">Harry Lillis III</a> (who played Bill in "<a href="Friday%20the%2013th%20%281980%20film%29">Friday the 13th</a>"), <a href="Mary%20Crosby">Mary</a> (best known for portraying <a href="Kristin%20Shepard">Kristin Shepard</a>, who shot <a href="J.%20R.%20Ewing">J. R. Ewing</a> on TV's "<a href="Dallas%20%281978%20TV%20series%29">Dallas</a>"), and <a href="Nathaniel%20Crosby">Nathaniel</a> (the 1981 <a href="U.S.%20Amateur">U.S. Amateur</a> champion in golf).

Crosby was a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">registered Republican</a>, and actively campaigned for <a href="Wendell%20Willkie">Wendell Willkie</a> in 1940 against <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">President Roosevelt</a>, arguing that no man should serve more than two terms in the White House. After Willkie lost, Crosby decreed that he would never again make any open political contributions. He was a seventh cousin of both President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> and his Vice President, <a href="Charles%20G.%20Dawes">Charles G. Dawes</a>.

Crosby reportedly had an alcohol problem in his youth, and may have been dismissed from Paul Whiteman's orchestra because of it, but he later got a handle on his drinking. According to Giddins, Crosby told his son Gary to stay away from alcohol, adding, "It killed your mother."

After Crosby's death, his eldest son, Gary, wrote a highly critical memoir, "Going My Own Way", depicting his father as cruel, cold, remote, and both physically and psychologically abusive. 
Gary Crosby wrote:

We had to keep a close watch on our actions ... When one of us left a sneaker or pair of underpants lying around, he had to tie the offending object on a string and wear it around his neck until he went off to bed that night. Dad called it "the Crosby <a href="lavalier">lavalier</a>". At the time the humor of the name escaped me ...

"Satchel Ass" or "Bucket Butt" or "My Fat-assed Kid". That's how he introduced me to his cronies when he dragged me along to the studio or racetrack ... By the time I was ten or eleven he had stepped up his campaign by adding lickings to the regimen. Each Tuesday afternoon he weighed me in, and if the scale read more than it should have, he ordered me into his office and had me drop my trousers ... I dropped my pants, pulled down my undershorts and bent over. Then he went at it with the belt dotted with metal studs he kept reserved for the occasion. Quite dispassionately, without the least display of emotion or loss of self-control, he whacked away until he drew the first drop of blood, and then he stopped. It normally took between twelve and fifteen strokes. As they came down I counted them off one by one and hoped I would bleed early ...

When I saw "Going My Way" I was as moved as they were by the character he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming down hard on the kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All the way back to the house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.

Younger son Phillip vociferously disputed his brother Gary's claims about their father. Around the time Gary made his claim, Phillip stated to the press that "Gary is a whining ... crybaby, walking around with a 2-by-4 and just daring people to nudge it off." However, Phillip did not deny that Crosby believed in corporal punishment. In an interview with <a href="People%20%28American%20magazine%29">"People"</a>, Phillip stated that "we never got an extra whack or a cuff we didn't deserve." During a later interview conducted in 1999 by the <a href="Globe%20%28tabloid%29">Globe</a>, Phillip said:

My dad was not the monster my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond memories of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote "Going My Own Way" out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name was the only way he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was the only way he could get his ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.

However, Dennis and Lindsay Crosby confirmed that their father was physically abusive. Lindsay added, "I'm glad [Gary] did it. I hope it clears up a lot of the old lies and rumors." Unlike Gary, however, Lindsay said that he preferred to remember "all the good things I did with my dad and forget the times that were rough." Dennis asserted that the book was "Gary's business" and a result of his "anger," but would not deny the book's claims. Bing's younger brother, singer and jazz bandleader <a href="Bob%20Crosby">Bob Crosby</a>, recalled at the time of Gary's revelations that Bing was a "disciplinarian," as their mother and father had been. He added, "We were brought up that way." In an interview for the same article, Gary clarified that Bing was abusive as a means of administering punishment: "He was not out to be vicious, to beat children for his kicks."

However, the Bing Crosby website asserts that late in his life, Gary claimed that he made up large portions of the book in an attempt to blame his irresponsible life decisions on his father. The website says:
However, several years after Bing died, <a href="Doubleday%20%28publisher%29">Doubleday</a> approached Gary to write an autobiography. To guarantee success, he was asked to wildly exaggerate Bing's self-acknowledged paternal strictness. "Going My Own Way", published in 1983 and co-authored by Ross Firestone, was Gary's controversial attempt to transfer his professional and personal shortcomings onto his father; and to achieve the long desired leading role – playing Bing, no less – should his book be adapted to the screen. This wasn't to be, as the book created considerable turmoil within the Crosby family. Subsequently, Gary recanted large portions of his unfortunate memoir. To further the rehabilitation Gary decided in 1995 to record an album overdubbing his father's classic recordings. This came too late. With one side complete, a persistent cough interfered with the endeavor. A doctor's visit confirmed that he had advanced lung cancer. Gary died on August 24, 1995.

It was revealed that Crosby's will had established a <a href="blind%20trust">blind trust</a>, with none of the sons receiving an inheritance until they reached the age of 65.

Lindsay Crosby died in 1989 and Dennis Crosby died in 1991, both by suicide from self-inflicted gunshot wounds, at ages 51 and 56, respectively. Gary Crosby died in 1995 at the age of 62 of lung cancer and 69-year-old Phillip Crosby died in 2004 of a heart attack.

Widow <a href="Kathryn%20Crosby">Kathryn Crosby</a> dabbled in local theater productions intermittently, and appeared in television tributes to her late husband.

<a href="Nathaniel%20Crosby">Nathaniel Crosby</a>, Crosby's youngest son from his second marriage, was a high-level golfer who won the <a href="United%20States%20Amateur%20Championship%20%28golf%29">U.S. Amateur</a> at age 19 in 1981, at the time the youngest-ever winner of that event. <a href="Harry%20Crosby%20%28businessman%29">Harry Crosby</a> is an investment banker who occasionally makes singing appearances.

<a href="Denise%20Crosby">Denise Crosby</a>, Dennis Crosby's daughter, is also an actress and is known for her role as <a href="Tasha%20Yar">Tasha Yar</a> on "", and for the recurring role of the Romulan <a href="Sela%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Sela</a> (daughter of Tasha Yar) after her withdrawal from the series as a regular cast member. She also appeared in the film adaptation of <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a>'s novel "<a href="Pet%20Sematary">Pet Sematary</a>". In 2006, Crosby's niece, Carolyn Schneider, published the laudatory book "Me and Uncle Bing".

There have been disputes between Crosby's two families beginning in the late 1990s. When <a href="Dixie%20Lee">Dixie</a> died in 1952, her will provided that her share of the community property be distributed in trust to her sons. After Crosby's death in 1977, he left the residue of his estate to a marital trust for the benefit of his widow, Kathryn, and HLC Properties, Ltd., was formed for the purpose of managing his interests, including his right of publicity. In 1996, Dixie's trust sued HLC and Kathryn for declaratory relief as to the trust's entitlement to interest, dividends, royalties, and other income derived from the community property of Crosby and Dixie. In 1999, the parties settled for approximately $1.5 million. Relying on a retroactive amendment to the <a href="California%20Civil%20Code">California Civil Code</a>, Dixie's trust brought suit again, in 2010, alleging that Crosby's right of publicity was community property, and that Dixie's trust was entitled to a share of the revenue it produced. The trial court granted Dixie's trust's claim. The California Court of Appeal reversed, however, holding that the 1999 settlement barred the claim. In light of the court's ruling, it was unnecessary for the court to decide whether a right of publicity can be characterized as <a href="community%20property">community property</a> under California law.

Following his recovery from a life-threatening fungal infection of his right lung in January 1974, Crosby emerged from semi-retirement to start a new spate of albums and concerts. In March 1977, after videotaping a concert at the Ambassador Theater in Pasadena for CBS to commemorate his 50th anniversary in show business, and with <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a> looking on, Crosby fell off the stage into an <a href="orchestra%20pit">orchestra pit</a>, rupturing a disc in his back requiring a month in the hospital. His first performance after the accident was his last American concert, on August 16, 1977 (the day singer <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a> died); when the power went out during his performance, he continued singing without amplification.

In September, Crosby, his family and singer <a href="Rosemary%20Clooney">Rosemary Clooney</a> began a concert tour of Britain that included two weeks at the <a href="London%20Palladium">London Palladium</a>. While in the UK, Crosby recorded his final album, "<a href="Seasons%20%28Bing%20Crosby%20album%29">Seasons</a>", and his final TV Christmas special with guest <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a> on September 11 (which aired a little over a month after Crosby's death). His last concert was in the <a href="Brighton%20Centre">Brighton Centre</a> on October 10, four days before his death, with British entertainer Dame <a href="Gracie%20Fields">Gracie Fields</a> in attendance. The following day he made his final appearance in a recording studio and sang eight songs at the BBC Maida Vale studios for a radio program, which also included an interview with Alan Dell. Accompanied by the Gordon Rose Orchestra, Crosby's last recorded performance was of the song "<a href="Once%20in%20a%20While%20%281937%20song%29">Once in a While</a>". Later that afternoon, he met with Chris Harding to take photographs for the "Seasons" album jacket.
On October 13, 1977, Crosby flew alone to <a href="Spain">Spain</a> to play golf and hunt partridge. On October 14, 1977, at the <a href="Golf%20La%20Moraleja">La Moraleja Golf</a> Course near Madrid, Crosby played 18 holes of golf. His partner was <a href="World%20Cup%20%28men%27s%20golf%29">World Cup</a> champion <a href="Manuel%20Pi%C3%B1ero">Manuel Piñero</a>; their opponents were club president Cesar de Zulueta and Valentin Barrios. According to Barrios, Crosby was in good spirits throughout the day, and was photographed several times during the round. At the ninth hole, construction workers building a house nearby recognized him, and when asked for a song, Crosby sang "Strangers in the Night". Crosby, who had a 13 handicap, lost to his partner by one stroke. As Crosby and his party headed back to the clubhouse, Crosby said, "That was a great game of golf, fellas." However, others say his final words were, "Let's go get a Coke." At about 6:30 pm, Crosby collapsed about 20 yards from the clubhouse entrance and died instantly from a massive heart attack. At the clubhouse and later in the ambulance, house physician Dr. Laiseca tried to revive him, but was unsuccessful. At Reina Victoria Hospital he was administered the <a href="last%20rites">last rites</a> of the Catholic Church and was pronounced dead. On October 18, following a private <a href="Requiem">funeral Mass</a> at St. Paul's Catholic Church in Westwood, Crosby was buried at <a href="Holy%20Cross%20Cemetery%2C%20Culver%20City">Holy Cross Cemetery</a> in Culver City, California. A plaque was placed at the golf course in his memory.

He is a member of the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Broadcasters%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame</a> in the radio division.

The family launched an official website on October 14, 2007, the 30th anniversary of Crosby's death.

In his autobiography "Don't Shoot, It's Only Me!" (1990), <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a> wrote, "Dear old Bing. As we called him, the "Economy-sized Sinatra". And what a voice. God I miss that voice. I can't even turn on the radio around Christmas time without crying anymore."

Calypso musician <a href="Roaring%20Lion">Roaring Lion</a> wrote a tribute song in 1939 titled "Bing Crosby", in which he wrote: "Bing has a way of singing with his very heart and soul / Which captivates the world / His millions of listeners never fail to rejoice / At his golden voice ..."

Bing Crosby Stadium in <a href="Front%20Royal%2C%20Virginia">Front Royal, Virginia</a> was named after Crosby in honor of his fundraising efforts and direct cash contributions for its construction in the 1948 to 1950 timeframe.

Crosby wrote or co-wrote lyrics to 22 songs. His composition "<a href="At%20Your%20Command">At Your Command</a>" was no. 1 for three weeks on the U.S. pop singles chart beginning on August 8, 1931. "<a href="I%20Don%27t%20Stand%20a%20Ghost%20of%20a%20Chance%20With%20You">I Don't Stand a Ghost of a Chance With You</a>" was his most successful composition, recorded by <a href="Duke%20Ellington">Duke Ellington</a>, <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>, <a href="Thelonious%20Monk">Thelonious Monk</a>, <a href="Billie%20Holiday">Billie Holiday</a>, and <a href="Mildred%20Bailey">Mildred Bailey</a>, among others. Songs co-written by Crosby include:


Four performances by Bing Crosby have been inducted into the <a href="Grammy%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Grammy Hall of Fame</a>, which is a special Grammy award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least 25 years old and that have "qualitative or historical significance".

Basel Convention

The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal, usually known as the Basel Convention, is an international <a href="treaty">treaty</a> that was designed to reduce the movements of <a href="hazardous%20waste">hazardous waste</a> between nations, and specifically to prevent transfer of hazardous waste from <a href="developed%20countries">developed</a> to <a href="Less%20Developed%20Countries">less developed countries</a> (LDCs). It does not, however, address the movement of radioactive waste. The Convention is also intended to minimize the amount and <a href="toxicity">toxicity</a> of wastes generated, to ensure their environmentally sound management as closely as possible to the source of generation, and to assist LDCs in environmentally sound management of the hazardous and other wastes they generate.

The Convention was opened for signature on 22 March 1989, and entered into force on 5 May 1992. As of November 2016, 184 states and the European Union are parties to the Convention. <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a> and the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> have signed the Convention but not <a href="ratification">ratified</a> it.

With the tightening of environmental laws (for example, <a href="Resource%20Conservation%20and%20Recovery%20Act">RCRA</a>) in developed nations in the 1970s, disposal costs for hazardous waste rose dramatically. At the same time, globalization of shipping made transboundary movement of waste more accessible, and many LDCs were desperate for foreign currency. Consequently, the trade in hazardous waste, particularly to LDCs, grew rapidly.

One of the incidents which led to the creation of the Basel Convention was the <a href="Khian%20Sea%20waste%20disposal%20incident">"Khian Sea" waste disposal incident</a>, in which a ship carrying incinerator ash from the city of Philadelphia in the United States dumped half of its load on a beach in Haiti before being forced away. It sailed for many months, changing its name several times. Unable to unload the cargo in any port, the crew was believed to have dumped much of it at sea.

Another is the 1988 Koko case in which five ships transported 8,000 barrels of hazardous waste from Italy to the small town of Koko in Nigeria in exchange for $100 monthly rent which was paid to a Nigerian for the use of his farmland.

These practices have been deemed "Toxic Colonialism" by many developing countries.

At its most recent meeting, 27 November to 1 December 2006, the Conference of the parties of the Basel Agreement focused on issues of <a href="electronic%20waste">electronic waste</a> and the dismantling of ships.

According to Maureen Walsh, only around 4% of hazardous wastes that come from <a href="Organisation%20for%20Economic%20Co-operation%20and%20Development">OECD</a> countries are actually shipped across international borders. These wastes include, among others, chemical waste, radioactive waste, <a href="municipal%20solid%20waste">municipal solid waste</a>, <a href="asbestos">asbestos</a>, incinerator ash, and old tires. Of internationally shipped waste that comes from developed countries, more than half is shipped for recovery and the remainder for final disposal.

Increased trade in recyclable materials has led to an increase in a market for used products such as computers. This market is valued in billions of dollars. At issue is the distinction when used computers stop being a "commodity" and become a "waste".

As of November 2016, there are 186 parties to the treaty, which includes 183 <a href="UN%20member%20states">UN member states</a>, the <a href="Cook%20Islands">Cook Islands</a>, the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, and the <a href="State%20of%20Palestine">State of Palestine</a>. The 10 UN member states that are not party to the treaty are <a href="East%20Timor">East Timor</a>, <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>, <a href="Grenada">Grenada</a>, <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a>, <a href="San%20Marino">San Marino</a>, <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, <a href="South%20Sudan">South Sudan</a>, <a href="Tuvalu">Tuvalu</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, and <a href="Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a>.

A waste falls under the scope of the Convention if it is within the category of wastes listed in Annex I of the Convention and it exhibits one of the hazardous characteristics contained in Annex III. 
In other words, it must both be listed and possess a characteristic such as being explosive, flammable, toxic, or corrosive. The other way that a waste may fall under the scope of the Convention is if it is defined as or considered to be a hazardous waste under the laws of either the exporting country, the importing country, or any of the countries of transit.

The definition of the term disposal is made in Article 2 al 4 and just refers to annex IV, which gives a list of operations which are understood as disposal or recovery. The examples of disposal are broad and include also recovery, recycling.

Alternatively, to fall under the scope of the Convention, it is sufficient for waste to be included in Annex II, which lists other wastes, such as household wastes and residue that comes from incinerating household waste.

Radioactive waste that is covered under other international control systems and wastes from the normal operation of ships are not covered.

Annex IX attempts to define "commodities" which are not considered wastes and which would be excluded.

In addition to conditions on the import and export of the above wastes, there are stringent requirements for notice, consent and tracking for movement of wastes across national boundaries. It is of note that the Convention places a general prohibition on the exportation or importation of wastes between Parties and non-Parties. The exception to this rule is where the waste is subject to another treaty that does not take away from the Basel Convention. The United States is a notable non-Party to the Convention and has a number of such agreements for allowing the shipping of hazardous wastes to Basel Party countries.

The OECD Council also has its own control system that governs the trans-boundary movement of hazardous materials between OECD member countries. This allows, among other things, the OECD countries to continue trading in wastes with countries like the United States that have not ratified the Basel Convention.

Parties to the Convention must honor import bans of other Parties.

Article 4 of the Basel Convention calls for an overall reduction of waste generation. By encouraging countries to keep wastes within their boundaries and as close as possible to its source of generation, the internal pressures should provide incentives for waste reduction and pollution prevention. Parties are generally prohibited from exporting covered wastes to, or import covered waste from, non-parties to the convention.

The Convention states that illegal hazardous waste traffic is criminal but contains no enforcement provisions.

According to Article 12, Parties are directed to adopt a protocol that establishes liability rules and procedures that are appropriate for damage that comes from the movement of hazardous waste across borders.

Current consensus is that as space is not classed as a "country" under the specific definition, export of e-waste to non terrestrial locations would not be covered. This has been suggested (somewhat laughably) as a way to deal with the "Fridge Mountain" and related deposits of waste in the UK and elsewhere in the event of a way to cheaply access space such as an orbital tether being built.

After the initial adoption of the Convention, some least developed countries and environmental organizations argued that it did not go far enough. Many nations and NGOs argued for a total ban on shipment of all hazardous waste to LDCs. In particular, the original Convention did not prohibit waste exports to any location except <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> but merely required a notification and consent system known as "prior informed consent" or PIC. Further, many waste traders sought to exploit the good name of recycling and begin to justify all exports as moving to recycling destinations. Many believed a full ban was needed including exports for recycling. These concerns led to several regional waste trade bans, including the <a href="Bamako%20Convention">Bamako Convention</a>.

Lobbying at 1995 Basel conference by LDCs, <a href="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a> and several European countries such as Denmark, led to the adoption of an amendment to the convention in 1995 termed the <a href="Basel%20Ban%20Amendment">Basel Ban Amendment</a> to the Basel Convention. The amendment has been accepted by 86 countries and the European Union, but has not entered into force (as that requires ratification by 3/4 of the member states to the Convention). The Amendment prohibits the export of hazardous waste from a list of developed (mostly <a href="OECD">OECD</a>) countries to developing countries. The Basel Ban applies to export for any reason, including <a href="recycling">recycling</a>. An area of special concern for advocates of the Amendment was the sale of ships for salvage, <a href="shipbreaking">shipbreaking</a>. The Ban Amendment was strenuously opposed by a number of industry groups as well as nations including Australia and Canada. The number of ratification for the entry-into force of the Ban Amendment is under debate: Amendments to the convention enter into force after ratification of "three-fourths of the Parties who accepted them" [Art. 17.5]; so far, the Parties of the Basel Convention could not yet agree whether this would be three fourth of the Parties that were Party to the Basel Convention when the Ban was adopted, or three fourth of the current Parties of the Convention[see Report of COP 9 of the Basel Convention]. The status of the amendment ratifications can be found on the Basel Secretariat's <a href="http%3A//www.basel.int/ratif/ban-alpha.htm">web page</a>. The <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> fully implemented the Basel Ban in its <a href="Waste%20Shipment%20Regulation">Waste Shipment Regulation</a> (<a href="EWSR">EWSR</a>), making it legally binding in all EU member states. Norway and Switzerland have similarly fully implemented the Basel Ban in their legislation.

In the light of the blockage concerning the entry into force of the Ban amendment, Switzerland and Indonesia have launched a “Country-led Initiative” (CLI) to discuss in an informal manner a way forward to ensure that the trans boundary movements of hazardous wastes, especially to developing countries and countries with economies in the transition, do not lead to an unsound management of hazardous wastes. This discussion aims at identifying and finding solutions to the reasons why hazardous wastes are still brought to countries that are not able to treat them in a safe manner. It is hoped that the CLI will contribute to the realization of the objectives of the Ban Amendment. The Basel Convention's website informs about the progress of this initiative <a href="http%3A//www.basel.int/"></a>

Bar Kokhba is a <a href="double%20album">double album</a> by <a href="John%20Zorn">John Zorn</a>, recorded between 1994 and 1996. It features music from Zorn's "<a href="Masada%20%28band%29">Masada</a>" project, rearranged for small ensembles. It also features the original soundtrack from "The Art of Remembrance – Simon Wiesenthal", a film by Hannah Heer and Werner Schmiedel (1994–95).

The <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> review by Marc Gilman awarded the album 4½ stars noting that "While some compositions retain their original structure and sound, some are expanded and probed by Zorn's arrangements, and resemble avant-garde classical music more than jazz. But this is the beauty of the album; the ensembles provide a forum for Zorn to expand his compositions. The album consistently impresses."

BASIC

BASIC (an <a href="acronym">acronym</a> for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) is a family of <a href="General-purpose%20programming%20language">general-purpose</a>, <a href="high-level%20programming%20language">high-level programming language</a>s whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use. In 1964, <a href="John%20G.%20Kemeny">John G. Kemeny</a> and <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Kurtz">Thomas E. Kurtz</a> designed the original BASIC language at <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth College</a> in <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers. At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something only <a href="scientist">scientist</a>s and <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a>s tended to learn.

Versions of BASIC became widespread on <a href="microcomputer">microcomputer</a>s in the mid-1970s and 1980s. <a href="Microcomputer">Microcomputer</a>s usually shipped with BASIC, often in the machine's <a href="firmware">firmware</a>. Having an easy-to-learn language on these early <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s allowed <a href="small%20business">small business</a> owners, professionals, <a href="hobbyist">hobbyist</a>s, and <a href="consultant">consultant</a>s to develop <a href="custom%20software">custom software</a> on computers they could afford. In the 2010s, BASIC was popular in many <a href="dialect%20%28computing%29">computing dialect</a>s and in new languages influenced by BASIC, such as <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s <a href="Visual%20Basic">Visual Basic</a>.

Before the mid-1960s, the only computers were huge <a href="mainframe%20computer">mainframe computer</a>s. Users submitted jobs (calculations or other requests) on <a href="punched%20card">punched card</a>s or similar media to specialist <a href="computer%20operator">computer operator</a>s. The computer stored these, then used a <a href="batch%20processing">batch processing</a> system to run this queue of jobs one after another, allowing very high levels of utilization of these expensive machines. As the performance of computing hardware rose through the 1960s, <a href="multi-processing">multi-processing</a> was developed. This allowed a mix of batch jobs to be run together, but the real revolution was the development of <a href="time-sharing">time-sharing</a>. <a href="Time-sharing">Time-sharing</a> allowed multiple remote interactive users to share use of the computer, interacting with the computer from <a href="computer%20terminal">computer terminal</a>s with keyboards and <a href="teletype%20printer">teletype printer</a>s, and later <a href="Computer%20monitor">display screens</a>, in much the same way as desktop computers or <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s would be used later.

The original BASIC language was released on May 1, 1964 by <a href="John%20G.%20Kemeny">John G. Kemeny</a> and <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Kurtz">Thomas E. Kurtz</a> and implemented under their direction by a team of <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth College</a> students. The <a href="acronym">acronym</a> "BASIC" comes from the name of an unpublished paper by Thomas Kurtz. BASIC was designed to allow students to write mainframe computer programs for the <a href="Dartmouth%20Time-Sharing%20System">Dartmouth Time-Sharing System</a>. It was intended specifically for less technical users who did not have or want the mathematical background previously expected. Being able to use a computer to support teaching and research was quite novel at the time.

The language was based on <a href="FORTRAN%20II">FORTRAN II</a>, with some influences from <a href="ALGOL%2060">ALGOL 60</a> and with additions to make it suitable for timesharing. Initially, BASIC concentrated on supporting straightforward mathematical work, with <a href="matrix%20%28math%29">matrix</a> arithmetic support from its initial implementation as a batch language, and <a href="character%20string">character string</a> functionality being added by 1965.
Wanting use of the language to become widespread, its designers made the compiler available free of charge. (In the 1960s, software became a chargeable commodity; until then, it was provided without charge as a service with the very expensive computers, usually available only to lease.) They also made it available to high schools in the <a href="Hanover%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Hanover, New Hampshire</a> area and put considerable effort into promoting the language. In the following years, as other dialects of BASIC appeared, Kemeny and Kurtz's original BASIC dialect became known as "<a href="Dartmouth%20BASIC">Dartmouth BASIC</a>

Knowledge of the relatively simple BASIC became widespread for a computer language, and it was implemented by a number of manufacturers, becoming fairly popular on newer <a href="minicomputer">minicomputer</a>s such as the <a href="Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation">DEC</a> <a href="Programmed%20Data%20Processor">PDP</a> series, where <a href="BASIC-PLUS">BASIC-PLUS</a> was an extended dialect for use on the <a href="RSTS/E">RSTS/E</a> time-sharing operating system. The BASIC language was available for the <a href="Data%20General%20Nova">Data General Nova</a>, and also central to the <a href="HP%20Time-Shared%20BASIC">HP Time-Shared BASIC</a> system in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where the language was implemented as an <a href="interpreter%20%28computing%29">interpreter</a>. A version was a core part of the <a href="Pick%20operating%20system">Pick operating system</a> from 1973 onward, where a compiler renders it into <a href="bytecode">bytecode</a>, able to be interpreted by a virtual machine.

During this period a number of simple <a href="computer%20game">computer game</a>s were written in BASIC, most notably Mike Mayfield's "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28text%20game%29">Star Trek</a>". A number of these were collected by DEC employee <a href="David%20H.%20Ahl">David H. Ahl</a> and published in a newsletter he compiled. He later collected a number of these into book form, "101 BASIC Computer Games", published in 1973. During the same period, Ahl was involved in the creation of a small computer for education use, an early <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>. When management refused to support the concept, Ahl left DEC in 1974 to found the seminal computer magazine, "<a href="Creative%20Computing">Creative Computing</a>". The book remained popular, and was re-published on several occasions.

The introduction of the first <a href="microcomputer">microcomputer</a>s in the mid-1970s was the start of explosive growth for BASIC. It had the advantage that it was fairly well known to the young designers and computer hobbyists who took an interest in microcomputers. Despite <a href="Edsger%20W.%20Dijkstra">Dijkstra</a>'s famous judgement in 1975, "It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration", BASIC was one of the few languages that was both high-level enough to be usable by those without training and small enough to fit into the microcomputers of the day, making it the de facto standard programming language on early microcomputers.

One of the first BASICs to appear was <a href="Tiny%20BASIC">Tiny BASIC</a>, a simple BASIC variant designed by <a href="Dennis%20Allison">Dennis Allison</a> at the urging of <a href="Bob%20Albrecht">Bob Albrecht</a> of the <a href="Homebrew%20Computer%20Club">Homebrew Computer Club</a>. He had seen BASIC on <a href="minicomputer">minicomputer</a>s and felt it would be the perfect match for new machines like the <a href="Altair%208800">MITS Altair 8800</a>. How to design and implement a stripped-down version of an <a href="interpreter%20%28computer%20software%29">interpreter</a> for the BASIC language was covered in articles by Allison in the first three quarterly issues of the "<a href="People%27s%20Computer%20Company">People's Computer Company</a>" newsletter published in 1975 and implementations with source code published in . Versions were written by <a href="Li-Chen%20Wang">Li-Chen Wang</a> and Tom Pittman. In 1975 MITS released <a href="Altair%20BASIC">Altair BASIC</a>, developed by <a href="Bill%20Gates">Bill Gates</a> and <a href="Paul%20Allen">Paul Allen</a> as the company Micro-Soft, which eventually grew into corporate giant <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>. The first Altair version was co-written by Gates, Allen, and <a href="Monte%20Davidoff">Monte Davidoff</a>.

Almost universally, <a href="home%20computer">home computer</a>s of the 1980s had a <a href="read-only%20memory">ROM</a>-resident BASIC interpreter, which the machines <a href="boot">boot</a>ed directly into. When the <a href="Apple%20II">Apple II</a>, <a href="PET%202001">PET 2001</a>, and <a href="TRS-80">TRS-80</a> were all released in 1977, all three had BASIC as their primary programming language and operating environment. Upon boot, a BASIC interpreter in <a href="immediate%20mode">immediate mode</a> was presented, not the <a href="command%20line%20interface">command line interface</a> used on systems running <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> or <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>. <a href="Commodore%20Business%20Machines">Commodore Business Machines</a> included a version of Microsoft BASIC. The Apple II and TRS-80 each had two versions of BASIC, a smaller introductory version introduced with the initial releases of the machines and a more advanced version developed as interest in the platforms increased. As new companies entered the field, additional versions were added that subtly changed the BASIC family. The <a href="Atari%208-bit%20family">Atari 8-bit family</a> had its own <a href="Atari%20BASIC">Atari BASIC</a> that was modified in order to fit on an 8 kB ROM cartridge. The <a href="BBC">BBC</a> published <a href="BBC%20BASIC">BBC BASIC</a>, developed by <a href="Acorn%20Computers%20Ltd">Acorn Computers Ltd</a>, incorporating many extra <a href="structured%20programming">structured programming</a> keywords and advanced floating-point operation features.

As the popularity of BASIC grew in this period, computer magazines published complete source code in BASIC for video games, utilities, and other programs. Given BASIC's straightforward nature, it was a simple matter to <a href="Type-in%20program">type in the code</a> from the magazine and execute the program. Different magazines were published featuring programs for specific computers, though some BASIC programs were considered universal and could be used in machines running any variant of BASIC (sometimes with minor adaptations). Many books of type-in programs were also available, and in particular, Ahl published versions of the original 101 BASIC games converted into the Microsoft dialect and published it from "Creative Computing" as "<a href="BASIC%20Computer%20Games">BASIC Computer Games</a>". This book, and its sequels, provided hundreds of ready-to-go programs that could be easily converted to practically any BASIC-running platform. The book reached the stores in 1978, just as the <a href="home%20computer">home computer</a> market was starting off, and it became the first million-selling computer book. Later packages, such as <a href="Learn%20to%20Program%20BASIC">Learn to Program BASIC</a> would also have gaming as an introductory focus. On the business-focused <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> computers which soon became widespread in small business environments, <a href="Microsoft%20BASIC">Microsoft BASIC</a> (<a href="MBASIC">MBASIC</a>) was one of the leading applications.

When IBM was designing the <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a> they followed the paradigm of existing home computers in wanting to have a built-in BASIC. They sourced this from Microsoft – <a href="IBM%20Cassette%20BASIC">IBM Cassette BASIC</a> – but Microsoft also produced several other versions of BASIC for <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>/<a href="PC%20DOS">PC DOS</a> including <a href="IBM%20Disk%20BASIC">IBM Disk BASIC</a> (BASIC D), <a href="IBM%20BASICA">IBM BASICA</a> (BASIC A), <a href="Microsoft%20GW-BASIC%20interpreter">GW-BASIC</a> (a BASICA-compatible version that did not need IBM's ROM) and <a href="QBasic">QBasic</a>, all typically bundled with the machine. In addition they produced the Microsoft BASIC Compiler aimed at professional programmers. Turbo <a href="Pascal%20%28programming%20language%29">Pascal</a>-publisher <a href="Borland">Borland</a> published <a href="Turbo%20Basic">Turbo Basic</a> 1.0 in 1985 (successor versions are still being marketed by the original author under the name <a href="PowerBASIC">PowerBASIC</a>). Microsoft wrote the windowed <a href="AmigaBASIC">AmigaBASIC</a> that was supplied with version 1.1 of the pre-emptive multitasking GUI Amiga computers (late 1985 / early 1986), although the product unusually did not bear any Microsoft marks. These languages introduced many extensions to the original home-computer BASIC, such as improved <a href="string%20manipulation">string manipulation</a> and graphics support, access to the <a href="file%20system">file system</a> and additional <a href="data%20type">data type</a>s. More important were the facilities for <a href="structured%20programming">structured programming</a>, including additional <a href="control%20structures">control structures</a> and proper <a href="subroutine">subroutine</a>s supporting <a href="local%20variable">local variable</a>s. However, by the latter half of the 1980s, users were increasingly using pre-made applications written by others, rather than learning programming themselves, while professional programmers now had a wide range of more advanced languages available on small computers. <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a> and later <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a> became the languages of choice for professional <a href="Shrink%20wrap%20contract">"shrink wrap"</a> application development.

In 1991 Microsoft introduced <a href="Visual%20Basic">Visual Basic</a>, an evolutionary development of QuickBasic. It included constructs from that language such as block-structured control statements, parameterized subroutines, and optional <a href="Type_system%23STATIC">static typing</a>, as well as <a href="object%20oriented%20language">object-oriented</a> constructs from other languages such as "With" and "For Each". The language retained some compatibility with its predecessors, such as the Dim keyword for declarations, "Gosub"/Return statements, and optional line numbers which could be used to locate errors. An important driver for the development of Visual Basic was as the new <a href="macro%20language">macro language</a> for <a href="Microsoft%20Excel">Microsoft Excel</a>, a <a href="spreadsheet">spreadsheet</a> program. To the surprise of many at Microsoft who still initially marketed it as a language for hobbyists, the language came into widespread use for small custom business applications shortly after the release of VB version 3.0, which is widely considered the first relatively stable version. While many advanced programmers still scoffed at its use, VB met the needs of <a href="small%20business">small business</a>es efficiently wherever ease of development was more of a concern than processing speed.

By that time, computers running Windows 3.1 had become fast enough that many business-related processes could be completed "in the blink of an eye" even using a "slow" language, as long as large amounts of data were not involved. Many small business owners found they could create their own small, yet useful applications in a few evenings to meet their own specialized needs. Eventually, during the lengthy lifetime of VB3, knowledge of Visual Basic had become a marketable job skill. Microsoft also produced <a href="VBScript">VBScript</a> in 1996 and <a href="Visual%20Basic%20.NET">Visual Basic .NET</a> in 2001. The latter has essentially the same power as <a href="C%20Sharp%20%28programming%20language%29">C#</a> and <a href="Java%20%28programming%20language%29">Java</a> but with syntax that reflects the original Basic language.
Many other BASIC dialects have also sprung up since 1990, including the <a href="open%20source">open source</a> <a href="QB64">QB64</a> and <a href="FreeBASIC">FreeBASIC</a>, inspired by QBasic, and the Visual Basic-styled <a href="RapidQ">RapidQ</a>, <a href="Basic%20For%20Qt">Basic For Qt</a> and <a href="Gambas">Gambas</a>. Modern commercial incarnations include <a href="PureBasic">PureBasic</a>, <a href="PowerBASIC">PowerBASIC</a>, <a href="Xojo">Xojo</a>, <a href="Monkey%20X">Monkey X</a> and <a href="True%20BASIC">True BASIC</a> (the direct successor to Dartmouth BASIC from a company controlled by Kurtz). Several web-based simple BASIC interpreters also now exist, including <a href="http%3A//www.quitebasic.com/">Quite BASIC</a> and Microsoft's <a href="Microsoft%20Small%20Basic">Small Basic</a> (educational software). Versions of BASIC have been showing up for use on <a href="smartphone">smartphone</a>s and tablets. Apple <a href="App%20Store">App Store</a> contains such implementations of BASIC programming language as <a href="smart%20BASIC">smart BASIC</a>, <a href="Basic%21">Basic!</a>, <a href="HotPaw%20Basic">HotPaw Basic</a>, <a href="BASIC-II">BASIC-II</a>, <a href="techBASIC">techBASIC</a> and others. Android devices feature such implementations of BASIC as <a href="RFO%20BASIC">RFO BASIC</a> and <a href="Mintoris%20Basic">Mintoris Basic</a>. Applications for some mobile computers with proprietary OS (<a href="CipherLab">CipherLab</a>) can be built with programming environment based on BASIC. An application for the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> and <a href="Nintendo%20DSi">Nintendo DSi</a> called "<a href="Petit%20Computer">Petit Computer</a>" allows for programming in a slightly modified version of BASIC with DS button support. A 3DS sequel was released in Japan in November 2014.

Variants of BASIC are available on graphing and otherwise <a href="programmable%20calculator">programmable calculator</a>s made by <a href="Texas%20Instruments">Texas Instruments</a>, HP, Casio, and others.

<a href="QBasic">QBasic</a>, a version of Microsoft <a href="QuickBASIC">QuickBASIC</a> without the linker to make EXE files, is present in the <a href="Windows%20NT">Windows NT</a> and DOS-<a href="Windows%2095">Windows 95</a> streams of operating systems and can be obtained for more recent releases like <a href="Windows%207">Windows 7</a> which do not have them. Prior to DOS 5, the Basic interpreter was <a href="GW-BASIC">GW-Basic</a>. QuickBasic is part of a series of three languages issued by Microsoft for the home and office power user and small scale professional development; QuickC and QuickPascal are the other two. For <a href="Windows%2095">Windows 95</a> and 98, which do not have QBasic installed by default, they can be copied from the installation disc, which will have a set of directories for old and optional software; other missing commands like Exe2Bin and others are in these same directories.

The various Microsoft, Lotus, and Corel office suites and related products are programmable with Visual Basic in one form or another, including <a href="LotusScript">LotusScript</a>, which is very similar to VBA 6. The Host Explorer terminal emulator uses WWB as a macro language; or more recently the programme and the suite in which it is contained is programmable in an in-house Basic variant known as Hummingbird Basic. The VBScript variant is used for programming web content, Outlook 97, Internet Explorer, and the Windows Script Host. WSH also has a <a href="Visual%20Basic%20for%20Applications">Visual Basic for Applications</a> (VBA) engine installed as the third of the default engines along with VBScript, JScript, and the numerous proprietary or open source engines which can be installed like <a href="PerlScript">PerlScript</a>, a couple of Rexx-based engines, Python, Ruby, Tcl, Delphi, XLNT, PHP, and others; meaning that the two versions of Basic can be used along with the other mentioned languages, as well as LotusScript, in a WSF file, through the component object model, and other WSH and VBA constructions. VBScript is one of the languages that can be accessed by the 4Dos, 4NT, and Take Command enhanced shells. SaxBasic and WWB are also very similar to the Visual Basic line of Basic implementations. The pre-Office 97 macro language for Microsoft Word is known as <a href="WordBASIC">WordBASIC</a>. Excel 4 and 5 use Visual Basic itself as a macro language. <a href="Chipmunk%20Basic">Chipmunk Basic</a>, an old school interpreter similar to BASICs of the 1970s, is available for <a href="GNU/Linux">GNU/Linux</a>, <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> and <a href="macOS">macOS</a>.

The ubiquity of BASIC interpreters on personal computers was such that textbooks once included simple "Try It In BASIC" exercises that encouraged students to experiment with mathematical and computational concepts on classroom or home computers. Popular computer magazines of the day typically included <a href="type-in%20program">type-in program</a>s.

Futurist and sci-fi writer <a href="David%20Brin">David Brin</a> mourned the loss of ubiquitous BASIC in a 2006 "Salon" article as have others who first used computers during this era. In turn, the article prompted Microsoft to develop and release <a href="Microsoft%20Small%20Basic">Small Basic</a>. Dartmouth held a 50th anniversary celebration for BASIC on 1 May 2014, as did other organisations; at least one organisation of VBA programmers organised a 35th anniversary observance in 1999.

Dartmouth College celebrated the 50th anniversary of the BASIC language with a day of events on April 30, 2014. A short documentary film was produced for the event.






Minimal versions of BASIC had only integer variables and one- or two-letter variable names, which minimized requirements of limited and expensive memory (RAM). More powerful versions had floating-point arithmetic, and variables could be labelled with names six or more characters long. There were some problems and restrictions in early implementations; for example, Applesoft allowed variable names to be several characters long, but only the first two were significant, thus it was possible to inadvertently write a program with variables "LOSS" and "LOAN", which would be treated as being the same; assigning a value to "LOAN" would silently overwrite the value intended as "LOSS". Keywords could not be used in variables in many early BASICs; "SCORE" would be interpreted as "SC" OR "E", where OR was a keyword. <a href="String%20%28computer%20science%29">String</a> variables are usually distinguished in many microcomputer dialects by having $ suffixed to their name, and values are often identified as strings by being delimited by "double quotation marks". Arrays in BASIC could contain integers, floating point or string variables.

Some dialects of BASIC supported <a href="matrix%20%28mathematics%29">matrices and matrix operations</a>, useful for the solution of sets of simultaneous linear algebraic equations. These dialects would directly support matrix operations such as assignment, addition, multiplication (of compatible matrix types), and evaluation of a determinant. Many microcomputer BASICs did not support this data type; matrix operations were still possible, but had to be programmed explicitly on array elements.

The original Dartmouth Basic was unusual in having a matrix keyword, MAT. Although dropped by most later microprocessor derivatives it is used in this example from the 1968 manual which averages the numbers that are input:
5 LET S = 0
10 MAT INPUT V 
20 LET N = NUM 
30 IF N = 0 THEN 99 
40 FOR I = 1 TO N 
45 LET S = S + V(I) 
50 NEXT I 
60 PRINT S/N 
70 GO TO 5 
99 END
New BASIC programmers on a home computer might start with a simple program, perhaps using the language's PRINT statement to display a message on the screen; a well-known and often-replicated example is <a href="The%20C%20Programming%20Language">Kernighan and Ritchie</a>'s <a href="Hello%20world%20program">Hello world program</a>:
10 PRINT "Hello, World!"
20 END
An <a href="infinite%20loop">infinite loop</a> could be used to fill the display with the message.

Most first-generation BASIC versions such as <a href="MSX%20BASIC">MSX BASIC</a> and <a href="GW-BASIC">GW-BASIC</a> supported simple data types, loop cycles, and arrays. The following example is written for GW-BASIC, but will work in most versions of BASIC with minimal changes:
10 INPUT "What is your name: "; U$
20 PRINT "Hello "; U$
30 INPUT "How many stars do you want: "; N
40 S$ = ""
50 FOR I = 1 TO N
60 S$ = S$ + "*"
70 NEXT I
80 PRINT S$
90 INPUT "Do you want more stars? "; A$
100 IF LEN(A$) = 0 THEN GOTO 90
110 A$ = LEFT$(A$, 1)
120 IF A$ = "Y" OR A$ = "y" THEN GOTO 30
130 PRINT "Goodbye "; U$
140 END

The resulting dialog might resemble:

Second-generation BASICs (for example, <a href="HP%20BASIC%20for%20OpenVMS">VAX Basic</a>, <a href="SuperBASIC">SuperBASIC</a>, <a href="True%20BASIC">True BASIC</a>, <a href="QuickBASIC">QuickBASIC</a>, <a href="BBC%20BASIC">BBC BASIC</a>, <a href="Pick%20operating%20system">Pick BASIC</a> and <a href="PowerBASIC">PowerBASIC</a>) introduced a number of features into the language, primarily related to structured and procedure-oriented programming. Usually, <a href="line%20number">line number</a>ing is omitted from the language and replaced with <a href="label%20%28computer%20science%29">labels</a> (for <a href="GOTO">GOTO</a>) and <a href="subroutine">procedures</a> to encourage easier and more flexible design. In addition keywords and structures to support repetition, selection and procedures with local variables were introduced.

The following example is in QuickBASIC:
DECLARE SUB PrintSomeStars (StarCount!)
REM QuickBASIC example
INPUT "What is your name: ", UserName$
PRINT "Hello "; UserName$
DO
LOOP WHILE UCASE$(Answer$) = "Y"
PRINT "Goodbye "; UserName$
END

SUB PrintSomeStars (StarCount)
END SUB
Third-generation BASIC dialects such as <a href="Visual%20Basic">Visual Basic</a>, <a href="Xojo">Xojo</a>, <a href="StarOffice%20Basic">StarOffice Basic</a> and <a href="BlitzMax">BlitzMax</a> introduced features to support object-oriented and <a href="event-driven%20programming">event-driven programming</a> paradigm. Most built-in procedures and functions are now represented as "methods" of standard objects rather than "operators". Also, the <a href="Operating%20System">Operating System</a> became more and more available to the BASIC language.

The following example is in <a href="Visual%20Basic%20.NET">Visual Basic .NET</a>:

List of Byzantine emperors

This is a list of the Byzantine emperors from the foundation of <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in 330 AD, which marks the conventional start of the Eastern Roman (or <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a>) Empire, to <a href="Fall%20of%20Constantinople">its fall</a> to the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> in 1453 AD. Only the emperors who were recognized as legitimate rulers and exercised sovereign authority are included, to the exclusion of junior co-emperors ("symbasileis") who never attained the status of sole or senior ruler, as well as of the <a href="List%20of%20Byzantine%20usurpers">various usurpers or rebels</a> who claimed the imperial title.

Traditionally, the line of Byzantine emperors is held to begin with the <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman Emperor</a> <a href="Constantine%20the%20Great">Constantine the Great</a>, the first Christian emperor, who rebuilt the city of <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a> as an imperial capital, Constantinople, and who was regarded by the later Byzantine emperors as the model ruler. It was under Constantine that the major characteristics of what is considered the Byzantine state emerged: a Roman polity centered at Constantinople and culturally dominated by the <a href="Greek%20East">Greek East</a>, with Christianity as the <a href="state%20religion">state religion</a>.

Emperors listed below up to <a href="Theodosius%20I">Theodosius I</a> in 395 were sole or joint rulers of the entire Roman Empire. The Byzantine Empire was the direct legal continuation of the eastern half of the Roman Empire following the division of the Roman Empire in 395. All Byzantine emperors considered themselves to be the rightful Roman emperor in direct succession from <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>; the term "Byzantine" was coined by Western <a href="historiography">historiography</a> only in the 16th century. The use of the title "Roman Emperor" was not contested until after the <a href="Pope">Papal</a> coronation of the <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> as <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> (25 December 800 AD), done partly in response to the Byzantine coronation of <a href="Irene%20of%20Athens">Empress Irene</a>, whose claim, as a woman, was not recognized by <a href="Pope%20Leo%20III">Pope Leo III</a>.

The <a href="Style%20%28manner%20of%20address%29">title</a> of all Emperors preceding <a href="Heraclius">Heraclius</a> was officially ""<a href="Augustus%20%28honorific%29">Augustus</a>"," although other titles such as "<a href="Dominus%20%28title%29">Dominus</a>" were also used. Their names were preceded by "<a href="Imperator">Imperator</a> <a href="Caesar%20%28title%29">Caesar</a>" and followed by "Augustus". Following Heraclius, the title commonly became the Greek "<a href="Basileus">Basileus</a>" (Gr. Βασιλεύς), which had formerly meant <a href="Monarch">sovereign</a> but was then used in place of "Augustus". Following the establishment of the rival <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> in Western Europe, the title ""<a href="Autokrator">Autokrator</a>"" (Gr. Αὐτοκράτωρ) was increasingly used. In later centuries, the Emperor could be referred to by Western Christians as the "Emperor of the Greeks." Towards the end of the Empire, the standard imperial formula of the Byzantine ruler was "[Emperor's name] in Christ, Emperor and Autocrat of the Romans" (cf. <a href="Names%20of%20the%20Greeks%23Romans%20%28%E1%BF%AC%CF%89%CE%BC%CE%B1%E1%BF%96%CE%BF%CE%B9%29">Ῥωμαῖοι</a> and <a href="R%C3%BBm">Rûm</a>).

In the medieval period, <a href="dynasty">dynasties</a> were common, but the principle of <a href="hereditary%20succession">hereditary succession</a> was never formalized in the Empire, and hereditary succession was a custom rather than an inviolable principle.

<doc id="4024" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4024" title="Butterfly effect">
Butterfly effect

The butterfly effect is a concept that states "small causes can have larger effects".

This concept was initially used in theories about weather prediction but later the term became a popular metaphor in science writing.

In <a href="chaos%20theory">chaos theory</a>, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on <a href="initial%20condition">initial condition</a>s in which a small change in one state of a deterministic <a href="nonlinear%20system">nonlinear system</a> can result in large differences in a later state. 

The term itself was coined by <a href="Edward%20Lorenz">Edward Lorenz</a> for the effect which had been known long before, and is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (exact time of formation, exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as the flapping of the wings of a distant <a href="butterfly">butterfly</a> several weeks earlier. Lorenz discovered the effect when he observed that runs of his <a href="Numerical%20weather%20prediction">weather model</a> with initial condition data that was rounded in a seemingly inconsequential manner would fail to reproduce the results of runs with the unrounded initial condition data. A very small change in initial conditions had created a significantly different outcome. 

The idea that small causes may have large effects in general and in weather specifically was used from <a href="Henri%20Poincar%C3%A9">Henri Poincaré</a> to <a href="Norbert%20Wiener">Norbert Wiener</a>. <a href="Edward%20Norton%20Lorenz">Edward Lorenz</a>'s work placed the concept of "instability" of the earth's <a href="atmosphere">atmosphere</a> onto a quantitative base and linked the concept of instability to the properties of large classes of dynamic systems which are undergoing <a href="nonlinear%20dynamics">nonlinear dynamics</a> and <a href="Chaos%20theory">deterministic chaos</a>.

The butterfly effect can also be demonstrated by very simple systems. For example, the <a href="randomness">randomness</a> of the outcomes of throwing <a href="dice">dice</a> depends on this characteristic to amplify small differences in initial conditions—the precise direction, thrust, and orientation of the throw—into significantly different dice paths and outcomes, which makes it virtually impossible to throw a dice exactly the same way twice.

In "<a href="The%20Vocation%20of%20Man">The Vocation of Man</a>" (1800), <a href="Johann%20Gottlieb%20Fichte">Fichte</a> says that "you could not remove a single grain of sand from its place without thereby ... changing something throughout all parts of the immeasurable whole".

<a href="Chaos%20theory">Chaos theory</a> and the sensitive dependence on initial conditions were described in the literature in a particular case of the <a href="three-body%20problem">three-body problem</a> by <a href="Henri%20Poincar%C3%A9">Henri Poincaré</a> in 1890. He later proposed that such phenomena could be common, for example, in meteorology.

In 1898, <a href="Jacques%20Hadamard">Jacques Hadamard</a> noted general divergence of trajectories in spaces of negative curvature. <a href="Pierre%20Duhem">Pierre Duhem</a> discussed the possible general significance of this in 1908.

The idea that one <a href="butterfly">butterfly</a> could eventually have a far-reaching <a href="ripple%20effect">ripple effect</a> on subsequent historic events made its earliest known appearance in "<a href="A%20Sound%20of%20Thunder">A Sound of Thunder</a>", a 1952 short story by <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> about time travel.

In 1961, Lorenz was running a numerical computer model to redo a weather prediction from the middle of the previous run as a shortcut. He entered the initial condition 0.506 from the printout instead of entering the full precision 0.506127 value. The result was a completely different weather scenario.

Lorenz wrote:
In 1963 Lorenz published a theoretical study of this effect in a highly cited, seminal paper called "Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow" (the calculations were performed on a <a href="Royal%20McBee">Royal McBee</a> <a href="LGP-30">LGP-30</a> computer). Elsewhere he stated: Following suggestions from colleagues, in later speeches and papers Lorenz used the more poetic <a href="butterfly">butterfly</a>. According to Lorenz, when he failed to provide a title for a talk he was to present at the 139th meeting of the <a href="American%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Science">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> in 1972, Philip Merilees concocted "Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?" as a title. Although a butterfly flapping its wings has remained constant in the expression of this concept, the location of the butterfly, the consequences, and the location of the consequences have varied widely.

The phrase refers to the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">atmosphere</a> that may ultimately alter the path of a <a href="tornado">tornado</a> or delay, accelerate or even prevent the occurrence of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power or directly create the tornado, but the term is intended to imply that the flap of the butterfly's wings can "cause" the tornado: in the sense that the flap of the wings is a part of the initial conditions; one set of conditions leads to a tornado while the other set of conditions doesn't. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which cascades to large-scale alterations of events (compare: <a href="domino%20effect">domino effect</a>). Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different—but it's also equally possible that the set of conditions without the butterfly flapping its wings is the set that leads to a tornado.

The butterfly effect presents an obvious challenge to prediction, since initial conditions for a system such as the weather can never be known to complete accuracy. This problem motivated the development of <a href="ensemble%20forecasting">ensemble forecasting</a>, in which a number of forecasts are made from perturbed initial conditions.

Some scientists have since argued that the weather system is not as sensitive to initial conditions as previously believed. <a href="David%20Orrell">David Orrell</a> argues that the major contributor to weather forecast error is model error, with sensitivity to initial conditions playing a relatively small role. <a href="Stephen%20Wolfram">Stephen Wolfram</a> also notes that the Lorenz equations are highly simplified and do not contain terms that represent viscous effects; he believes that these terms would tend to damp out small perturbations.

<a href="Poincar%C3%A9%20recurrence%20theorem">Recurrence</a>, the approximate return of a system towards its initial conditions, together with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, are the two main ingredients for chaotic motion. They have the practical consequence of making <a href="complex%20system">complex system</a>s, such as the <a href="weather">weather</a>, difficult to predict past a certain time range (approximately a week in the case of weather) since it is impossible to measure the starting atmospheric conditions completely accurately.

A <a href="dynamical%20system">dynamical system</a> displays sensitive dependence on initial conditions if points arbitrarily close together separate over time at an exponential rate. The definition is not topological, but essentially metrical.

If "M" is the <a href="State%20space%20%28dynamical%20system%29">state space</a> for the map formula_1, then formula_1 displays sensitive dependence to initial conditions if for any x in "M" and any δ > 0, there are y in "M", with distance "d"(. , .) such that formula_3 and such that

for some positive parameter "a". The definition does not require that all points from a neighborhood separate from the base point "x", but it requires one positive <a href="Lyapunov%20exponent">Lyapunov exponent</a>.

The simplest mathematical framework exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions is provided by a particular parametrization of the <a href="logistic%20map">logistic map</a>:

which, unlike most chaotic maps, has a <a href="closed-form%20solution">closed-form solution</a>:

where the <a href="initial%20condition">initial condition</a> parameter formula_7 is given by formula_8. For rational formula_7, after a finite number of <a href="iterated%20function">iterations</a> formula_10 maps into a <a href="periodic%20point">periodic sequence</a>. But almost all formula_7 are irrational, and, for irrational formula_7, formula_10 never repeats itself – it is non-periodic. This solution equation clearly demonstrates the two key features of chaos – stretching and folding: the factor 2 shows the exponential growth of stretching, which results in sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect), while the squared sine function keeps formula_10 folded within the range [0, 1].

The butterfly effect is most familiar in terms of <a href="weather">weather</a>; it can easily be demonstrated in standard weather prediction models, for example. The climate scientists James Annan and William Connolley explain that chaos is important in the development of weather prediction methods; models are sensitive to initial conditions. They add the caveat: "Of course the existence of an unknown butterfly flapping its wings has no direct bearing on weather forecasts, since it will take far too long for such a small perturbation to grow to a significant size, and we have many more immediate uncertainties to worry about. So the direct impact of this phenomenon on weather prediction is often somewhat overstated."

The potential for sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect) has been studied in a number of cases in <a href="Semiclassical%20physics">semiclassical</a> and <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum physics</a> including atoms in strong fields and the anisotropic <a href="Kepler%20problem">Kepler problem</a>. Some authors have argued that extreme (exponential) dependence on initial conditions is not expected in pure quantum treatments; however, the sensitive dependence on initial conditions demonstrated in classical motion is included in the semiclassical treatments developed by <a href="Martin%20Gutzwiller">Martin Gutzwiller</a> and Delos and co-workers.

Other authors suggest that the butterfly effect can be observed in quantum systems. Karkuszewski et al. consider the time evolution of quantum systems which have slightly different <a href="Hamiltonian%20%28quantum%20mechanics%29">Hamiltonians</a>. They investigate the level of sensitivity of quantum systems to small changes in their given Hamiltonians. Poulin et al. presented a quantum algorithm to measure fidelity decay, which "measures the rate at which identical initial states diverge when subjected to slightly different dynamics". They consider fidelity decay to be "the closest quantum analog to the (purely classical) butterfly effect". Whereas the classical butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the position and/or velocity of an object in a given <a href="Hamiltonian%20system">Hamiltonian system</a>, the quantum butterfly effect considers the effect of a small change in the Hamiltonian system with a given initial position and velocity. This quantum butterfly effect has been demonstrated experimentally. Quantum and semiclassical treatments of system sensitivity to initial conditions are known as <a href="quantum%20chaos">quantum chaos</a>.

The journalist Peter Dizikes, writing in "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" in 2008, notes that popular culture likes the idea of the butterfly effect, but gets it wrong. Whereas Lorenz suggested correctly with his butterfly metaphor that predictability "is inherently limited", popular culture supposes that each event can be explained by finding the small reasons that caused it. Dizikes explains: "It speaks to our larger expectation that the world should be comprehensible – that everything happens for a reason, and that we can pinpoint all those reasons, however small they may be. But nature itself defies this expectation."

Borland

Borland Software Corporation is a <a href="Computer%20software">software</a> company that facilitates <a href="software%20deployment">software deployment</a> projects. Borland was first headquartered in <a href="Scotts%20Valley%2C%20California">Scotts Valley, California</a>, then in <a href="Cupertino%2C%20California">Cupertino, California</a>, and now in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>. It is now a <a href="Micro%20Focus%20International">Micro Focus International</a> subsidiary. It was founded in 1983 by Niels Jensen, Ole Henriksen, Mogens Glad and <a href="Philippe%20Kahn">Philippe Kahn</a>.

Three Danish citizens, Niels Jensen, Ole Henriksen, and Mogens Glad, founded Borland Ltd. in August 1981 to develop products like Word Index for the <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> operating system using an <a href="off-the-shelf%20company">off-the-shelf company</a>. However, response to the company's products at the CP/M-82 show in San Francisco showed that a U.S. company would be needed to reach the American market. They met <a href="Philippe%20Kahn">Philippe Kahn</a>, who had just moved to Silicon Valley, and who had been a key developer of the <a href="Micral">Micral</a>. The three Danes had embarked, at first successfully, on marketing software first from Denmark, and later from Ireland, before running into some challenges at the time when they met Philippe Kahn. Kahn was chairman, president, and CEO of Borland Inc. from its inception in 1983 until 1995. Main shareholders at the incorporation of Borland were Niels Jensen (250,000 shares), Ole Henriksen (160,000), Mogens Glad (100,000), and Kahn (80,000).

Borland developed a series of well-regarded software development tools. Its first product was <a href="Turbo%20Pascal">Turbo Pascal</a> in 1983, developed by <a href="Anders%20Hejlsberg">Anders Hejlsberg</a> (who later developed .NET and C# for Microsoft) and before Borland acquired the product sold in Scandinavia under the name of Compas Pascal. 1984 saw the launch of <a href="Borland%20Sidekick">Borland Sidekick</a>, a time organization, notebook, and calculator utility that was an early and popular <a href="terminate%20and%20stay%20resident%20program">terminate and stay resident program</a> (TSR) for <a href="DOS">DOS</a> operating systems.

By the mid-1980s the company had become so successful that it had the largest exhibit at the 1985 <a href="West%20Coast%20Computer%20Faire">West Coast Computer Faire</a> other than IBM or AT&T. <a href="Bruce%20Webster">Bruce Webster</a> reported that "the legend of Turbo Pascal has by now reached mythic proportions, as evidenced by the number of firms that, in marketing meetings, make plans to become 'the next Borland'". After Turbo Pascal and Sidekick the company successfully launched other applications such as SuperKey and Lightning, all developed in Denmark. While the Danes remained majority shareholders, board members included Kahn, <a href="Tim%20Berry%20%28entrepreneur%29">Tim Berry</a>, John Nash, and David Heller. With the assistance of John Nash and David Heller, both British members of the Borland Board, the company was taken public on London's Unlisted Securities Market (USM) in 1986. <a href="Schroders">Schroders</a> was the lead investment banker. According to the London IPO filings, the management team was Philippe Kahn as President, Spencer Ozawa as VP of Operations, Marie Bourget as CFO, and Spencer Leyton as VP of sales and business development, while all software development was continuing to take place in Denmark and later London as the Danish co-founders moved there. A first US IPO followed in 1989 after Ben Rosen joined the Borland board with <a href="Goldman%20Sachs">Goldman Sachs</a> as the lead banker and a second offering in 1991 with Lazard as the lead banker. All offerings were very successful and over-subscribed.

In 1985 Borland acquired Analytica and its <a href="Borland%20Reflex">Reflex</a> database product. The engineering team of Analytica, managed by <a href="Brad%20Silverberg">Brad Silverberg</a> and including Reflex co-founder <a href="Adam%20Bosworth">Adam Bosworth</a>, became the core of Borland's engineering team in the USA. Brad Silverberg was VP of engineering until he left in early 1990 to head up the Personal Systems division at <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>. Adam Bosworth initiated and headed up the <a href="Quattro%20Pro">Quattro</a> project until moving to Microsoft later in 1990 to take over the project which eventually became <a href="Microsoft%20Access">Access</a>.

In 1987 Borland purchased Wizard Systems and incorporated portions of the Wizard C technology into <a href="Turbo%20C">Turbo C</a>. Bob Jervis, the author of Wizard C became a Borland employee. Turbo C was released on May 18, 1987, and an estimated 100,000 copies were shipped in the first month of its release. This apparently drove a wedge between Borland and Niels Jensen and the other members of his team who had been working on a brand new series of compilers at their London development centre. An agreement was reached and they spun off a company called Jensen & Partners International(JPI), later <a href="TopSpeed">TopSpeed</a>. JPI first launched a MS-DOS compiler named JPI Modula-2, that later became TopSpeed Modula-2, and followed up with TopSpeed C, TopSpeed C++ and TopSpeed Pascal compilers for both the MS-DOS and OS/2 operating systems. The TopSpeed compiler technology exists today as the underlying technology of the <a href="Clarion%20%28programming%20language%29">Clarion</a> 4GL programming language, a Windows development tool.

In September 1987 Borland purchased Ansa-Software, including their <a href="Borland%20Paradox">Paradox</a> (version 2.0) <a href="database">database</a> management tool. Richard Schwartz, a cofounder of Ansa, became Borland's CTO and Ben Rosen joined the Borland board.

The <a href="Quattro%20Pro">Quattro Pro</a> spreadsheet was launched in 1989 with, at the time, a notable improvement and charting capabilities. Lotus Development, under the leadership of <a href="Jim%20Manzi">Jim Manzi</a> sued Borland for copyright infringement (see <a href="Look%20and%20feel">Look and feel</a>). The litigation, "<a href="Lotus%20Dev.%20Corp.%20v.%20Borland%20Int%27l%2C%20Inc.">Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc.</a>", brought forward Borland's open standards position as opposed to Lotus' closed approach. Borland, under Kahn's leadership took a position of principle and announced that they would defend against Lotus' legal position and "fight for programmer's rights". After a decision in favor of Borland by the <a href="First%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals">First Circuit Court of Appeals</a>, the case went to the United States Supreme Court. Because Justice <a href="John%20Paul%20Stevens">John Paul Stevens</a> had recused himself, only eight Justices heard the case, and it ended in a 4–4 tie. As a result, the First Circuit decision remained standing, but the Supreme Court result, being a tie, did not bind any other court and set no national precedent.

Additionally, Borland was known for its practical and creative approach towards <a href="Copyright%20infringement%20of%20software">software piracy</a> and <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual property</a> (IP), introducing its "Borland no-nonsense license agreement". This allowed the developer/user to utilize its products "just like a book"; he or she was allowed to make multiple copies of a program, as long as only one copy was in use at any point in time.

In September 1991 Borland purchased <a href="Ashton-Tate">Ashton-Tate</a>, bringing the <a href="dBase">dBase</a> and <a href="InterBase">InterBase</a> databases to the house, in an all-stock transaction. Competition with Microsoft was fierce. <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> launched the competing database <a href="Microsoft%20Access">Microsoft Access</a> and bought the dBase clone <a href="FoxPro">FoxPro</a> in 1992, undercutting Borland's prices. During the early 1990s Borland's implementation of <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a> and <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a> outsold Microsoft's. Borland survived as a company, but no longer had the dominance in software tools that it once had. It has gone through a radical transition in products, financing, and staff, now a very different company from the one which challenged Microsoft and Lotus in the early 1990s.

The internal problems that arose with the Ashton-Tate merger were a large part of the fall. Ashton-Tate's product portfolio proved to be weak, with no provision for evolution into the GUI environment of Windows. Almost all product lines were discontinued. The consolidation of duplicate support and development offices was costly and disruptive. Worst of all, the highest revenue earner of the combined company was dBASE with no Windows version ready. Borland had an internal project to clone dBASE which was intended to run on Windows and was part of the strategy of the acquisition, but by late 1992 this was abandoned due to technical flaws and the company had to constitute a replacement team (the <a href="ObjectVision">ObjectVision</a> team, redeployed) headed by <a href="Bill%20Turpin">Bill Turpin</a> to redo the job. Borland lacked the financial strength to project its marketing and move internal resources off other products to shore up the dBASE/W effort. Layoffs occurred in 1993 to keep the company afloat, the third instance of this in five years. By the time dBASE for Windows eventually shipped, the developer community had moved on to other products such as Clipper or FoxBase and dBASE never regained significant share of Ashton-Tate's former market. This happened against the backdrop of the rise in Microsoft's combined Office product marketing.

A change in market conditions also contributed to Borland's fall from prominence. In the 1980s, companies had few people who understood the growing personal computer phenomenon, and so most technical people were given free rein to purchase whatever software they thought they needed. Borland had done an excellent job marketing to those with a highly technical bent. By the mid-1990s, however, companies were beginning to ask what the return was on the investment they had made in this loosely controlled PC software buying spree. Company executives were starting to ask questions that were hard for technically minded staff to answer, and so corporate standards began to be created. This required new kinds of marketing and support materials from software vendors, but Borland remained focused on the technical side of its products.

During 1993 Borland explored ties with <a href="WordPerfect">WordPerfect</a> as a possible way to form a suite of programs to rival Microsoft's nascent integration strategy. WordPerfect itself was struggling with a late and troubled transition to Windows. The eventual joint company effort, named Borland Office for Windows (a combination of the WordPerfect word processor, Quattro Pro spreadsheet and Paradox database) was introduced at the 1993 Comdex computer show. Borland Office never made significant in-roads against Microsoft Office. WordPerfect was then bought by <a href="Novell">Novell</a>. In October 1994, Borland sold Quattro Pro and rights to sell up to million copies of Paradox to Novell for $140 million in cash, repositioning the company on its core software development tools and the Interbase database engine and shifting toward client-server scenarios in corporate applications. This later proved a good foundation for the shift to web development tools.

<a href="Philippe%20Kahn">Philippe Kahn</a> and the Borland board disagreed on how to focus the company, and Kahn resigned as chairman, CEO and president, after 12 years, in January 1995.
Kahn remained on the board until November 7, 1996. Borland named <a href="Gary%20Wetsel">Gary Wetsel</a> as CEO, but he resigned in July 1996. <a href="William%20F.%20Miller">William F. Miller</a> was interim CEO until September of that year, when <a href="Whitney%20G.%20Lynn">Whitney G. Lynn</a> became interim president and CEO (along with other executive changes), and then continued to have a succession of CEOs including <a href="Dale%20Fuller">Dale Fuller</a> and <a href="Tod%20Nielsen">Tod Nielsen</a>.

The <a href="Borland%20Delphi">Delphi 1</a> <a href="rapid%20application%20development">rapid application development</a> (RAD) environment was launched in 1995, under the leadership of <a href="Anders%20Hejlsberg">Anders Hejlsberg</a>.

In 1996 Borland acquired Open Environment Corporation, a Cambridge-based company founded by <a href="John%20J.%20Donovan">John J. Donovan</a>.

On November 25, 1996, <a href="Del%20Yocam">Del Yocam</a> was hired as Borland CEO and chairman.

In 1997, Borland sold <a href="Paradox%20%28database%29">Paradox</a> to <a href="Corel">Corel</a>, but retained all development rights for the core <a href="BDE%20%28Borland%29">BDE</a>. In November 1997, Borland acquired <a href="Visigenic">Visigenic</a>, a middleware company that was focused on implementations of <a href="CORBA">CORBA</a>.

On April 29, 1998, Borland refocused its efforts on targeting enterprise applications development. Borland hired marketing firm <a href="Lexicon%20Branding">Lexicon Branding</a> to come up with a new name for the company. Yocam explained that the new name, Inprise, was meant to evoke "integrating the enterprise". The idea was to integrate Borland's tools, <a href="Borland%20Delphi">Delphi</a>, <a href="C%2B%2B%20Builder">C++ Builder</a>, and <a href="JBuilder">JBuilder</a> with enterprise environment software, including Visigenic's implementations of CORBA, <a href="Visibroker">Visibroker</a> for C++ and Java, and the new product, <a href="Borland%20Enterprise%20Server">Application Server</a>.

For a number of years (both before and during the Inprise name) Borland suffered from serious financial losses and poor public image. When the name was changed to Inprise, many thought Borland had gone out of business.
In March 1999, dBase was sold to KSoft, Inc. which was soon renamed to dBASE Inc. (In 2004 dBASE Inc. was renamed to DataBased Intelligence, Inc.).

In 1999, Dale L. Fuller replaced Yocam. At this time Fuller's title was "interim president and CEO." The "interim" was dropped in December 2000. <a href="Keith%20Gottfried">Keith Gottfried</a> served in senior executive positions with the company from 2000 to 2004.

A proposed merger between Inprise and Corel was announced in February 2000, aimed at producing <a href="Linux">Linux</a>-based products. The scheme was abandoned when Corel's shares fell and it became clear that there was really no strategic fit.

<a href="InterBase">InterBase</a> 6.0 was made available as <a href="open-source%20software">open-source software</a> in July 2000.

In January 2001, the Inprise name was abandoned and the company became "Borland" once more.

Under the Borland name and a new management team headed by president and CEO Dale L. Fuller, a now-smaller and profitable Borland refocused on Delphi, and created a version of Delphi and C++ Builder for Linux, both under the name <a href="Kylix%20programming%20tool">Kylix</a>. This brought Borland's expertise in <a href="Integrated%20Development%20Environment">Integrated Development Environment</a>s to the Linux platform for the first time. Kylix was launched in 2001.

Plans to spin off the <a href="InterBase">InterBase</a> division as a separate company were abandoned after Borland and the people who were to run the new company could not agree on terms for the separation. Borland stopped open-source releases of InterBase and has developed and sold new versions at a fast pace.

Delphi 6 became the first Integrated Development Environment to support web services. All of the company's development platforms now support web services.

<a href="CSharpBuilder">C#Builder</a> was released in 2003 as a native <a href="C%20Sharp%20%28programming%20language%29">C#</a> development tool, competing with <a href="Visual%20Studio%20.NET">Visual Studio .NET</a>. As of the 2005 release, C#Builder, Delphi for Win32, and Delphi for .NET have been combined into a single IDE called "Borland Developer Studio" (though the combined IDE is still popularly known as "Delphi"). In late 2002 Borland purchased design tool vendor TogetherSoft and tool publisher <a href="Starbase%20Corporation">Starbase</a>, makers of the <a href="StarTeam">StarTeam</a> configuration management tool and the <a href="CaliberRM">CaliberRM</a> requirements management tool (eventually, CaliberRM was renamed as "Caliber"). The latest releases of <a href="JBuilder">JBuilder</a> and Delphi integrate these tools to give developers a broader set of tools for development.

Former CEO Dale Fuller quit in July 2005, but remained on the board of directors. Former COO Scott Arnold took the title of interim president and chief executive officer until November 8, 2005, when it was announced that <a href="Tod%20Nielsen">Tod Nielsen</a> would take over as CEO effective November 9, 2005. Nielsen remained with the company until January 2009, when he accepted the position of <a href="chief%20operating%20officer">chief operating officer</a> at <a href="VMware">VMware</a>; CFO Erik Prusch then took over as acting president and CEO.

In October 2005, Borland acquired Legadero, in order to add its IT management and governance suite, called Tempo, to the Borland product line.

On February 8, 2006, Borland announced the divestiture of their IDE division, including <a href="Borland%20Delphi">Delphi</a>, <a href="JBuilder">JBuilder</a>, and <a href="InterBase">InterBase</a>. At the same time they announced the planned acquisition of Segue Software, a maker of software test and quality tools, in order to concentrate on application life-cycle management (ALM). 
On March 20, 2006, Borland announced its acquisition of Gauntlet Systems, a provider of technology that screens software under development for quality and security.
On November 14, 2006, Borland announced its decision to separate the developer tools group into a wholly owned subsidiary. The newly formed operation, <a href="CodeGear">CodeGear</a>, was responsible for four IDE product lines.

In early 2007 Borland announced new branding for its focus around open application life-cycle management.
In April 2007, Borland announced that it would relocate its headquarters and development facilities to <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>. It also has development centers at <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="Santa%20Ana%2C%20California">Santa Ana, California</a>, and <a href="Linz">Linz</a>, Austria.

On May 7, 2008, Borland announced the sale of CodeGear division to <a href="Embarcadero%20Technologies">Embarcadero Technologies</a> for an expected $23 million price and $7 million in CodeGear accounts receivables retained by Borland.

On May 6, 2009, the company announced it was to be acquired by <a href="Micro%20Focus">Micro Focus</a> for $75 million. The transaction was approved by Borland shareholders on July 22, 2009, with Micro Focus acquiring the company for $1.50/share. Following Micro Focus shareholder approval and the required corporate filings, the transaction was completed in late July 2009. It was estimated to have 750 employees at the time.

The products acquired from Segue Software include Silk Central, Silk Performer, and Silk Test. The Silk line was first announced in 1997.

Buckminster Fuller

Richard Buckminster "Bucky" Fuller (; July 12, 1895 – July 1, 1983) was an American <a href="architect">architect</a>, <a href="systems%20theorist">systems theorist</a>, author, designer, and inventor.

Fuller published more than 30 books, coining or popularizing terms such as "<a href="Spaceship%20Earth">Spaceship Earth</a>", <a href="ephemeralization">ephemeralization</a>, and <a href="Synergetics%20%28Fuller%29">synergetic</a>. He also developed numerous inventions, mainly architectural designs, and popularized the widely known <a href="geodesic%20dome">geodesic dome</a>. Carbon molecules known as <a href="fullerene">fullerene</a>s were later named by scientists for their structural and mathematical resemblance to geodesic spheres.

Fuller was the second World President of <a href="Mensa%20International">Mensa</a> from 1974 to 1983.

Fuller was born on July 12, 1895, in <a href="Milton%2C%20Massachusetts">Milton, Massachusetts</a>, the son of Richard Buckminster Fuller and Caroline Wolcott Andrews, and grand-nephew of the <a href="Transcendentalism">American Transcendentalist</a> <a href="Margaret%20Fuller">Margaret Fuller</a>. He spent much of his youth on <a href="Bear%20Island%20%28Maine%29">Bear Island</a>, in <a href="Penobscot%20Bay">Penobscot Bay</a> off the coast of Maine. He attended <a href="Friedrich%20Fr%C3%B6bel">Froebel</a>ian Kindergarten. He had trouble with <a href="geometry">geometry</a>, being unable to understand the abstraction that a chalk dot on the blackboard represented a mathematical <a href="Point%20%28geometry%29">point</a>, or that an imperfectly drawn line with an arrow on the end was meant to stretch off to <a href="infinity">infinity</a>. He often made items from materials he found in the woods, and sometimes made his own tools. He experimented with designing a new apparatus for human propulsion of small boats. By age 12, he had invented a 'push pull' system for propelling a rowboat by use of an inverted umbrella connected to the transom with a simple oar lock which allowed the user to face forward to point the boat toward its destination. Later in life, Fuller took exception to the term "invention".

Years later, he decided that this sort of experience had provided him with not only an interest in design, but also a habit of being familiar with and knowledgeable about the materials that his later projects would require. Fuller earned a <a href="machinist">machinist</a>'s certification, and knew how to use the <a href="press%20brake">press brake</a>, stretch press, and other tools and equipment used in the <a href="sheet%20metal">sheet metal</a> trade.

Fuller attended <a href="Milton%20Academy">Milton Academy</a> in Massachusetts, and after that began studying at <a href="Harvard%20College">Harvard College</a>, where he was affiliated with <a href="Adams%20House%20%28Harvard%20University%29">Adams House</a>. He was expelled from Harvard twice: first for spending all his money partying with a <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> troupe, and then, after having been readmitted, for his "irresponsibility and lack of interest." By his own appraisal, he was a non-conforming misfit in the fraternity environment.

Between his sessions at Harvard, Fuller worked in Canada as a mechanic in a textile <a href="factory">mill</a>, and later as a laborer in the <a href="meat-packing">meat-packing</a> industry. He also served in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> in World War I, as a shipboard radio operator, as an editor of a publication, and as a <a href="crash%20rescue%20boat">crash rescue boat</a> commander. After discharge, he worked again in the meat packing industry, acquiring management experience. In 1917, he married Anne Hewlett. During the early 1920s, he and his father-in-law developed the <a href="Stockade%20Building%20System">Stockade Building System</a> for producing light-weight, weatherproof, and fireproof housing—although the company would ultimately fail in 1927.

Buckminster Fuller recalled 1927 as a pivotal year of his life. His daughter Alexandra had died in 1922 of complications from <a href="polio">polio</a> and <a href="spinal%20meningitis">spinal meningitis</a> just before her fourth birthday. Fuller dwelled on her death, suspecting that it was connected with the Fullers' damp and drafty living conditions. This provided motivation for Fuller's involvement in Stockade Building Systems, a business which aimed to provide affordable, efficient housing.

In 1927, at age 32, Fuller lost his job as president of Stockade. The Fuller family had no savings, and the birth of their daughter Allegra in 1927 added to the financial challenges. Fuller drank heavily and reflected upon the solution to his family's struggles on long walks around Chicago. During the autumn of 1927, Fuller contemplated suicide, so that his family could benefit from a life insurance payment.

Fuller said that he had experienced a profound incident which would provide direction and purpose for his life. He felt as though he was suspended several feet above the ground enclosed in a white sphere of light. A voice spoke directly to Fuller, and declared:

Fuller stated that this experience led to a profound re-examination of his life. He ultimately chose to embark on "an experiment, to find what a single individual [could] contribute to changing the world and benefiting all humanity."

Speaking to audiences later in life, Fuller would regularly recount the story of his Lake Michigan experience, and its transformative impact on his life. Historians have been unable to identify direct evidence for this experience within the 1927 papers of Fuller's <a href="Chronofile">Chronofile</a> archives, housed at <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a>. Stanford historian Barry Katz suggests that the suicide story may be a myth which Fuller constructed later in life, to summarize this formative period of his career.

In 1927 Fuller resolved to think independently which included a commitment to "the search for the principles governing the universe and help advance the evolution of humanity in accordance with them... finding ways of "doing more with less" to the end that all people everywhere can have more and more." By 1928, Fuller was living in <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a> and spending much of his time at the popular café <a href="Romany%20Marie">Romany Marie</a>'s, where he had spent an evening in conversation with Marie and <a href="Eugene%20O%27Neill">Eugene O'Neill</a> several years earlier. Fuller accepted a job decorating the interior of the café in exchange for meals, giving informal lectures several times a week, and models of the <a href="Dymaxion%20house">Dymaxion house</a> were exhibited at the café. <a href="Isamu%20Noguchi">Isamu Noguchi</a> arrived during 1929—<a href="Constantin%20Br%C3%A2ncu%C8%99i">Constantin Brâncuși</a>, an old friend of Marie's, had directed him there—and Noguchi and Fuller were soon collaborating on several projects, including the modeling of the <a href="Dymaxion%20car">Dymaxion car</a> based on recent work by <a href="Aurel%20Persu">Aurel Persu</a>. It was the beginning of their lifelong friendship.

Fuller taught at <a href="Black%20Mountain%20College">Black Mountain College</a> in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> during the summers of 1948 and 1949, serving as its Summer Institute director in 1949. There, with the support of a group of professors and students, he began reinventing a project that would make him famous: the <a href="geodesic%20dome">geodesic dome</a>. Although the geodesic dome had been created some 30 years earlier by Dr. <a href="Walther%20Bauersfeld">Walther Bauersfeld</a>, Fuller was awarded United States patents, even though he neglected to cite Bauersfeld's prior art in his patent applications. He is credited for popularizing this type of structure.

One of his early models was first constructed in 1945 at <a href="Bennington%20College">Bennington College</a> in Vermont, where he lectured often. In 1949, he erected his first geodesic dome building that could sustain its own weight with no practical limits. It was in diameter and constructed of aluminium aircraft tubing and a vinyl-plastic skin, in the form of an <a href="icosahedron">icosahedron</a>. To prove his design, Fuller suspended from the structure's framework several students who had helped him build it. The U.S. government recognized the importance of his work, and employed his firm Geodesics, Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina to make small domes for the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marines</a>. Within a few years, there were thousands such domes around the world.

Fuller's first "continuous tension – discontinuous compression" geodesic dome (full sphere in this case) was constructed at the University of Oregon Architecture School in 1959 with the help of students. These continuous tension – discontinuous compression structures featured single force compression members (no flexure or bending moments) that did not touch each other and were 'suspended' by the tensional members.

For half of a century, Fuller developed many ideas, designs and inventions, particularly regarding practical, inexpensive shelter and transportation. He documented his life, philosophy and ideas scrupulously by a daily <a href="diary">diary</a> (later called the "<a href="Dymaxion%20Chronofile">Dymaxion Chronofile</a>"), and by twenty-eight publications. Fuller financed some of his experiments with inherited funds, sometimes augmented by funds invested by his collaborators, one example being the <a href="Dymaxion%20car">Dymaxion car</a> project.

International recognition began with the success of huge <a href="geodesic%20dome">geodesic dome</a>s during the 1950s. Fuller lectured at <a href="NC%20State%20University">NC State University</a> in Raleigh in 1949, where he met James Fitzgibbon, who would become a close friend and colleague. Fitzgibbon was director of Geodesics, Inc. and Synergetics, Inc. the first licensees to design geodesic domes. Thomas C. Howard was lead designer, architect and engineer for both companies.

Fuller began working with architect <a href="Shoji%20Sadao">Shoji Sadao</a> in 1954, and in 1964 they co-founded the architectural firm Fuller & Sadao Inc., whose first project was to design the large <a href="geodesic%20dome">geodesic dome</a> for the <a href="Montreal%20Biosphere">U.S. Pavilion</a> at <a href="Expo%2067">Expo 67</a> in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>. This building is now the "<a href="Montreal%20Biosph%C3%A8re">Montreal Biosphère</a>".

From 1959 to 1970, Fuller taught at <a href="Southern%20Illinois%20University%20Carbondale">Southern Illinois University Carbondale</a> (SIU). Beginning as an assistant professor, he gained full professorship in 1968, in the School of Art and Design. Working as a designer, scientist, developer, and writer, he lectured for many years around the world. He collaborated at SIU with the designer <a href="John%20McHale%20%28artist%29">John McHale</a>. In 1965, Fuller inaugurated the World Design Science Decade (1965 to 1975) at the meeting of the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Architects">International Union of Architects</a> in Paris, which was, in his own words, devoted to "applying the principles of science to solving the problems of humanity." Later in his SIU tenure, Fuller was also a visiting professor at <a href="Southern%20Illinois%20University%20Edwardsville">SIU Edwardsville</a>, where he designed the dome for the campus Religious Center.

Fuller believed human societies would soon rely mainly on renewable sources of energy, such as solar- and wind-derived electricity. He hoped for an age of "omni-successful education and sustenance of all humanity." Fuller referred to himself as "the property of universe" and during one radio interview he gave later in life, declared himself and his work "the property of all humanity". For his lifetime of work, the <a href="American%20Humanist%20Association">American Humanist Association</a> named him the 1969 Humanist of the Year.

In 1976, Fuller was a key participant at <a href="UN%20Habitat%20I">UN Habitat I</a>, the first UN forum on human settlements.

Fuller was awarded 28 United States patents and many honorary doctorates. In 1960, he was awarded the <a href="Frank%20P.%20Brown%20Medal">Frank P. Brown Medal</a> from <a href="The%20Franklin%20Institute">The Franklin Institute</a>. Fuller was elected as an honorary member of <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a> in 1967, on the occasion of the 50th year reunion of his Harvard class of 1917 (from which he was expelled in his first year). He was elected a Fellow of the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a> in 1968. In 1968 he was elected into the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Design">National Academy of Design</a> as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1970. In 1970 he received the <a href="AIA%20Gold%20Medal">Gold Medal</a> award from the <a href="American%20Institute%20of%20Architects">American Institute of Architects</a>. In 1976, he received the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Literary%20Award">St. Louis Literary Award</a> from the <a href="Saint%20Louis%20University">Saint Louis University</a> Library Associates. He also received numerous other awards, including the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> presented to him on February 23, 1983, by President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>.
Fuller's last filmed interview took place on April 3, 1983, in which he presented his analysis of <a href="Simon%20Rodia">Simon Rodia</a>'s <a href="Watts%20Towers">Watts Towers</a> as a unique embodiment of the structural principles found in nature. Portions of this interview appear in "<a href="I%20Build%20the%20Tower">I Build the Tower</a>," a documentary film on Rodia's architectural masterpiece.

Fuller died on July 1, 1983, 11 days before his 88th birthday. During the period leading up to his death, his wife had been lying comatose in a Los Angeles hospital, dying of cancer. It was while visiting her there that he exclaimed, at a certain point: "She is squeezing my hand!" He then stood up, suffered a heart attack, and died an hour later, at age 87. His wife of 66 years died 36 hours later. They are buried in <a href="Mount%20Auburn%20Cemetery">Mount Auburn Cemetery</a> in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Buckminster Fuller was a Unitarian like his grandfather, <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> minister <a href="Arthur%20Buckminster%20Fuller">Arthur Buckminster Fuller</a>, He was an early <a href="environmental%20activist">environmental activist</a>. He was aware of the Earth's finite resources, and promoted a principle that he termed "<a href="ephemeralization">ephemeralization</a>", which according to futurist and Fuller disciple <a href="Stewart%20Brand">Stewart Brand</a>, he coined to mean "doing more with less". Resources and waste from cruder products could be recycled into making more valuable products, increasing the efficiency of the entire process. Fuller also introduced <a href="Synergetics%20%28Fuller%29">synergetics</a>, a term which he used broadly as a metaphor for communicating experiences using geometric concepts, and more specifically the empirical study of systems in transformation, with an emphasis on total system behavior unpredicted by the behavior of any isolated components. Fuller coined this term long before the term <a href="synergy">synergy</a> became popular.

Fuller was a pioneer in thinking globally, and he explored principles of <a href="Energy%20conversion%20efficiency">energy</a> and <a href="material%20efficiency">material efficiency</a> in the fields of architecture, engineering and design. He cited François de Chardenèdes' opinion that petroleum, from the standpoint of its replacement cost out of our current energy "budget" (essentially, the net incoming <a href="solar%20energy">solar flux</a>), had cost nature "over a million dollars" per U.S. gallon (US$300,000 per litre) to produce. From this point of view, its use as a transportation fuel by people commuting to work represents a huge net loss compared to their earnings. An encapsulation quotation of his views might be, "There is no energy crisis, only a crisis of ignorance."

Fuller was concerned about <a href="sustainability">sustainability</a> and human survival under the existing socio-economic system, yet remained optimistic about humanity's future. Defining wealth in terms of knowledge, as the "technological ability to protect, nurture, support, and accommodate all growth needs of life," his analysis of the condition of "Spaceship Earth" caused him to conclude that at a certain time during the 1970s, humanity had attained an unprecedented state. He was convinced that the accumulation of relevant knowledge, combined with the quantities of major recyclable resources that had already been extracted from the earth, had attained a critical level, such that competition for necessities had become unnecessary. Cooperation had become the optimum survival strategy. He declared: "selfishness is unnecessary and hence-forth unrationalizable... War is obsolete." He criticized previous utopian schemes as too exclusive, and thought this was a major source of their failure. To work, he thought that a utopia needed to include everyone.

Fuller was influenced by <a href="Alfred%20Korzybski">Alfred Korzybski</a>'s idea of <a href="general%20semantics">general semantics</a>. In the 1950s, Fuller attended seminars and workshops organized by the <a href="Institute%20of%20General%20Semantics">Institute of General Semantics</a>, and he delivered the annual <a href="Alfred%20Korzybski%20Memorial%20Lecture">Alfred Korzybski Memorial Lecture</a> in 1955. Korzybski is mentioned in the Introduction of his book "<a href="Synergetics%20%28Fuller%29">Synergetics</a>". The two shared a remarkable amount of similarity in their formulations of general semantics.

In his 1970 book "I Seem To Be a Verb", he wrote: "I live on Earth at present, and I don't know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing—a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process—an integral function of the universe."

Fuller wrote that the natural <a href="analytic%20geometry">analytic geometry</a> of the universe was based on arrays of tetrahedra. He developed this in several ways, from the close-packing of spheres and the number of compressive or tensile members required to stabilize an object in space. One confirming result was that the strongest possible homogeneous <a href="truss">truss</a> is cyclically tetrahedral.

He had become a <a href="guru">guru</a> of the design, architecture, and 'alternative' communities, such as <a href="Drop%20City">Drop City</a>, the community of experimental artists to whom he awarded the 1966 "Dymaxion Award" for "poetically economic" domed living structures.

Fuller was most famous for his <a href="thin-shell%20structure">lattice shell structures</a> – <a href="geodesic%20dome">geodesic dome</a>s, which have been used as parts of military radar stations, civic buildings, environmental protest camps and exhibition attractions. An examination of the geodesic design by <a href="Walther%20Bauersfeld">Walther Bauersfeld</a> for the <a href="Planetarium%20Jena">Zeiss-Planetarium</a>, built some 20 years prior to Fuller's work, reveals that Fuller's Geodesic Dome patent (U.S. 2,682,235; awarded in 1954), follows the same design as Bauersfeld's.

Their construction is based on extending some basic principles to build simple "<a href="tensegrity">tensegrity</a>" structures (tetrahedron, <a href="octahedron">octahedron</a>, and the closest packing of spheres), making them lightweight and stable. The geodesic dome was a result of Fuller's exploration of nature's constructing principles to find design solutions. The Fuller Dome is referenced in the <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a>-winning novel "<a href="Stand%20on%20Zanzibar">Stand on Zanzibar</a>" by <a href="John%20Brunner%20%28novelist%29">John Brunner</a>, in which a geodesic dome is said to cover the entire island of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, and it floats on air due to the hot-air balloon effect of the large air-mass under the dome (and perhaps its construction of lightweight materials).

The <a href="Dymaxion%20car">Dymaxion car</a> was a vehicle designed by Fuller, featured prominently at Chicago's 1933-1934 <a href="Century%20of%20Progress">Century of Progress</a> World's Fair. During the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, Fuller formed the "Dymaxion Corporation" and built three prototypes with noted naval architect <a href="Starling%20Burgess">Starling Burgess</a> and a team of 27 workmen — using donated money as well as a family inheritance.

Fuller associated the word "Dymaxion" with much of his work, a <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of the words dynamic", maximum", and "tension" to sum up the goal of his study, "maximum gain of advantage from minimal energy input."

The Dymaxion was not an automobile "per se", but rather the 'ground-taxying mode' of a vehicle that might one day be designed to fly, land and drive — an "Omni-Medium Transport" for air, land and water. Fuller focused on the landing and taxiing qualities, and noted severe limitations in its handling. The team made constant improvements and refinements to the platform, and Fuller noted the Dymaxion "was an invention that could not be made available to the general public without considerable improvements."

The bodywork was aerodynamically designed for increased fuel efficiency and speed as well as light weight, and its <a href="Automobile%20platform">platform</a> featured a lightweight cromoly-steel hinged chassis, rear-mounted V8 engine, front-drive and three-wheels. The vehicle was steered via the third wheel at the rear, capable of 90° <a href="steering">steering lock</a>. Thus able to steer in a tight circle, the Dymaxion often caused a sensation, bringing nearby traffic to a halt.

Shortly after launch, a prototype crashed after being hit by another car, killing the Dymaxion's driver. The other car was driven by a local politician and was illegally removed from the accident scene, leaving reporters who arrived subsequently to blame the Dymaxion's unconventional design — though investigations exonerated the prototype. Fuller would himself later crash another prototype with his young daughter aboard.

Despite courting the interest of important figures from the auto industry, Fuller used his family inheritance to finish the second and third prototypes — eventually selling all three, dissolving "Dymaxion Corporation" and maintaining the Dymaxion was never intended as a commercial venture. One of the three original prototypes survives.

Fuller's energy-efficient and inexpensive <a href="Dymaxion%20house">Dymaxion house</a> garnered much interest, but only two prototypes were ever produced. Here the term "Dymaxion" is used in effect to signify a "radically strong and light tensegrity structure". One of Fuller's Dymaxion Houses is on display as a permanent exhibit at the <a href="Henry%20Ford%20Museum">Henry Ford Museum</a> in <a href="Dearborn%2C%20Michigan">Dearborn, Michigan</a>. Designed and developed during the mid-1940s, this prototype is a round structure (not a dome), shaped something like the flattened "bell" of certain jellyfish. It has several innovative features, including revolving dresser drawers, and a fine-mist shower that reduces water consumption. According to Fuller biographer Steve Crooks, the house was designed to be delivered in two cylindrical packages, with interior color panels available at local dealers. A circular structure at the top of the house was designed to rotate around a central mast to use natural winds for cooling and air circulation.

Conceived nearly two decades earlier, and developed in <a href="Wichita%2C%20Kansas">Wichita, Kansas</a>, the house was designed to be lightweight, adapted to windy climates, cheap to produce and easy to assemble. Because of its light weight and portability, the Dymaxion House was intended to be the ideal housing for individuals and families who wanted the option of easy mobility. The design included a "Go-Ahead-With-Life Room" stocked with maps, charts, and helpful tools for travel "through time and space." It was to be produced using factories, workers, and technologies that had produced World War II aircraft. It looked ultramodern at the time, built of metal, and sheathed in polished aluminum. The basic model enclosed of floor area. Due to publicity, there were many orders during the early Post-War years, but the company that Fuller and others had formed to produce the houses failed due to management problems.

In 1967, Fuller developed a concept for an offshore floating city named <a href="Triton%20City">Triton City</a> and published a report on the design the following year. Models of the city aroused the interest of President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> who, after leaving office, had them placed in the <a href="Lyndon%20Baines%20Johnson%20Library%20and%20Museum">Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum</a>.

In 1969, Fuller began the Otisco Project, named after its location in <a href="Otisco%2C%20New%20York">Otisco, New York</a>. The project developed and demonstrated concrete spray with mesh-covered wireforms for producing large-scale, load-bearing spanning structures built on-site, without the use of pouring molds, other adjacent surfaces or hoisting. The initial method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts were set. Tubes cut to length and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a duodeca-rhombicahedron (22-sided hemisphere) geodesic structure with spans ranging to . The form was then draped with layers of ¼-inch wire mesh attached by twist ties. Concrete was sprayed onto the structure, building up a solid layer which, when cured, would support additional concrete to be added by a variety of traditional means. Fuller referred to these buildings as monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes. However, the tubular frame form proved problematic for setting windows and doors. It was replaced by an iron <a href="rebar">rebar</a> set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward and welded in place to create the dome's wireform structure and performed satisfactorily. Domes up to three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong. Other shapes such as cones, pyramids and arches proved equally adaptable.

The project was enabled by a grant underwritten by <a href="Syracuse%20University">Syracuse University</a> and sponsored by <a href="US%20Steel">US Steel</a> (rebar), the Johnson Wire Corp, (mesh) and Portland Cement Company (concrete). The ability to build large complex load bearing concrete spanning structures in free space would open many possibilities in architecture, and is considered as one of Fuller's greatest contributions.

Fuller, along with co-cartographer <a href="Shoji%20Sadao">Shoji Sadao</a>, also designed an alternative projection map, called the <a href="Dymaxion%20map">Dymaxion map</a>. This was designed to show Earth's continents with minimum distortion when projected or printed on a flat surface.

In the 1960s, Fuller developed the <a href="World%20Game">World Game</a>, a collaborative simulation game played on a 70-by-35-foot Dymaxion map, in which players attempt to solve world problems. The object of the simulation game is, in Fuller's words, to “make the world work, for 100% of humanity, in the shortest possible time, through spontaneous cooperation, without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone.”

Buckminster Fuller wore thick-lensed <a href="spectacles">spectacles</a> to correct his extreme <a href="hyperopia">hyperopia</a>, a condition that went undiagnosed for the first five years of his life. Fuller's hearing was damaged during his Naval service in World War I and deteriorated during the 1960s. After experimenting with bullhorns as hearing aids during the mid-1960s, Fuller adopted electronic hearing aids from the 1970s onward

In public appearances, Fuller always wore dark-colored suits, appearing like "an alert little clergyman". Previously, he had experimented with unconventional clothing immediately after his 1927 epiphany, but found that breaking social fashion customs made others devalue or dismiss his ideas. Fuller learned the importance of physical appearance as part of one's credibility, and decided to become "the invisible man" by dressing in clothes that would not draw attention to himself. With self-deprecating humor, Fuller described this black-suited appearance as resembling a "second-rate bank clerk".

Following his global prominence from the 1960s onward, Fuller became a frequent flier, often crossing time zones to lecture. In the 1960s and 1970s, he wore three watches simultaneously; one for the time zone of his office in <a href="Carbondale%2C%20Illinois">Carbondale</a>, one for the time zone of the location he would next visit, and one for the time zone he was currently in. In the 1970s, Fuller was only in 'homely' locations (his personal home in Carbondale, Illinois; his holiday retreat in Bear Island, Maine; his daughter's home in <a href="Pacific%20Palisades%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Pacific Palisades</a>, California) roughly 65 nights per year—the other 300 nights were spent in hotel beds in the locations he visited on his lecturing and consulting circuits.

In the 1920s, Fuller experimented with <a href="polyphasic%20sleep">polyphasic sleep</a>, which he called "Dymaxion sleep". Inspired by the sleep habits of animals such as dogs and cats, Fuller worked until he was tired, and then slept short naps. This generally resulted in Fuller sleeping 30-minute naps every 6 hours. This allowed him "twenty-two thinking hours a day", which aided his work productivity. Fuller reportedly kept this Dymaxion sleep habit for two years, before quitting the routine because it conflicted with his business associates' sleep habits. Despite no longer personally partaking in the habit, in 1943 Fuller suggested Dymaxion sleep as a strategy that the United States could adopt to win World War II.

Despite only practicing true polyphasic sleep for a period during the 1920s, Fuller was known for his stamina throughout his life. He was described as "tireless" by <a href="Barry%20Farrell">Barry Farrell</a> in <a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">"Life"</a> magazine, who noted that Fuller stayed up all night replying to mail during Farrell's 1970 trip to Bear Island. In his seventies, Fuller generally slept for 5–8 hours per night.

Fuller documented his life copiously from 1915 to 1983, approximately of papers in a collection called the Dymaxion Chronofile. He also kept copies of all incoming and outgoing correspondence. The enormous Fuller Collection is currently housed at <a href="Stanford">Stanford</a> University.
If somebody kept a very accurate record of a human being, going through the era from the <a href="Gay%2090s">Gay 90s</a>, from a very different kind of world through the turn of the century—as far into the twentieth century as you might live. I decided to make myself a good case history of such a human being and it meant that I could not be judge of what was valid to put in or not. I must put everything in, so I started a very rigorous record.

In his youth, Fuller experimented with several ways of presenting himself: R. B. Fuller, Buckminster Fuller, but as an adult finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller, and signed his letters as such. However, he preferred to be addressed as simply "Bucky".

Buckminster Fuller spoke and wrote in a unique style and said it was important to describe the world as accurately as possible. Fuller often created long run-on sentences and used unusual compound words (omniwell-informed, intertransformative, omni-interaccommodative, omniself-regenerative) as well as terms he himself invented.

Fuller used the word "Universe" without the <a href="definite%20article">definite</a> or <a href="indefinite%20article">indefinite article</a>s ("the" or "a") and always capitalized the word. Fuller wrote that "by Universe I mean: the aggregate of all humanity's consciously apprehended and communicated (to self or others) Experiences."

The words "down" and "up", according to Fuller, are awkward in that they refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience. The words "in" and "out" should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object's relation to a gravitational center, the Earth. "I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going "outstairs" and "instairs."' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it. But if they try saying in and out for a few days in fun, they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they begin to feel real 'reality.'"

"World-around" is a term coined by Fuller to replace "worldwide". The general belief in a <a href="flat%20Earth">flat Earth</a> died out in <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a>, so using "wide" is an anachronism when referring to the surface of the Earth—a spheroidal surface has area and encloses a volume but has no width. Fuller held that unthinking use of obsolete scientific ideas detracts from and misleads intuition. Other neologisms collectively invented by the Fuller family, according to Allegra Fuller Snyder, are the terms "sunsight" and "sunclipse", replacing "sunrise" and "sunset" to overturn the geocentric bias of most pre-<a href="Nicolaus%20Copernicus">copernican</a> <a href="celestial%20mechanics">celestial mechanics</a>.

Fuller also invented the word "livingry," as opposed to weaponry (or "killingry"), to mean that which is in support of all human, plant, and Earth life. "The architectural profession—civil, naval, aeronautical, and astronautical—has always been the place where the most competent thinking is conducted regarding livingry, as opposed to weaponry."

As well as contributing significantly to the development of tensegrity technology, Fuller invented the term "<a href="tensegrity">tensegrity</a>" from "tensional integrity". "Tensegrity describes a structural-relationship principle in which structural shape is guaranteed by the finitely closed, comprehensively continuous, tensional behaviors of the system and not by the discontinuous and exclusively local compressional member behaviors. Tensegrity provides the ability to yield increasingly without ultimately breaking or coming asunder."

"<a href="Dymaxion">Dymaxion</a>" is a portmanteau of "dynamic maximum tension". It was invented about 1929 by two <a href="Advertising%20agency">admen</a> at Marshall Field's department store in Chicago to describe Fuller's concept house, which was shown as part of a house of the future store display. They created the term utilizing three words that Fuller used repeatedly to describe his design – dynamic, maximum, and tension.

Fuller also helped to popularize the concept of <a href="Spaceship%20Earth">Spaceship Earth</a>: "The most important fact about Spaceship Earth: an instruction manual didn't come with it."

His concepts and buildings include:

Bill Watterson

William Boyd "Bill" Watterson II (born July 5, 1958) is an American cartoonist and the author of the <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a> "<a href="Calvin%20and%20Hobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a>", which was <a href="Print%20syndication">syndicated</a> from 1985 to 1995. Watterson stopped drawing "Calvin and Hobbes" at the end of 1995 with a short statement to newspaper editors and his readers that he felt he had achieved all he could in the medium. Watterson is known for his negative views on licensing and comic syndication, his efforts to expand and elevate the newspaper comic as an art-form, and his move back into <a href="Private%20sphere">private life</a> after he stopped drawing "Calvin and Hobbes". Watterson was born in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> and grew up in <a href="Chagrin%20Falls">Chagrin Falls</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, whose suburban <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern United States</a> setting was part of the inspiration for "Calvin and Hobbes".

Bill Watterson was born in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, United States, where his father James G. Watterson (1932-2016) worked as a <a href="patent%20attorney">patent attorney</a>. The family relocated to <a href="Chagrin%20Falls">Chagrin Falls</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> in 1965 when Watterson was six years old, because his mother Kathryn wanted to be closer to her family and felt that the small town was a good place to raise her two children Bill and Thomas. Thomas is now a musician who lives in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>.

Watterson drew his first cartoon at age eight, and spent much time in childhood <a href="social%20isolation">alone</a>, drawing and cartooning. This continued through his school years, during which time he discovered comic strips such as "<a href="Pogo%20%28comics%29">Pogo</a>", "<a href="Krazy%20Kat">Krazy Kat</a>", and <a href="Charles%20M.%20Schulz">Charles Schulz</a>' "<a href="Peanuts">Peanuts</a>" which subsequently inspired and influenced his desire to become a professional cartoonist. On one occasion when he was in fourth grade, he wrote a letter to Charles Schulz, who responded — to Watterson's surprise — making a big impression on him at the time. His parents encouraged him in his artistic pursuits. Later, they recalled him as a "conservative child" — imaginative, but "not in a fantasy way", and certainly nothing like the character of Calvin that he later created. Watterson found avenues for his cartooning talents throughout primary and secondary school, creating high school-themed super hero comics with his friends and contributing cartoons and art to the school newspaper and yearbook.

From 1976 to 1980, Watterson attended <a href="Kenyon%20College">Kenyon College</a> and graduated with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in <a href="political%20science">political science</a>. He had already decided upon a career in cartooning, but he felt that his studies would help him move into editorial cartooning. While at college, he continued to develop his art skills; during his <a href="sophomore">sophomore</a> year, he painted <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>'s "<a href="Creation%20of%20Adam">Creation of Adam</a>" on the ceiling of his dorm room. He also contributed cartoons to the college newspaper, some of which included the original "Spaceman Spiff" cartoons.

Later, when Watterson was creating names for the characters in his comic strip, he decided upon Calvin (after the Protestant reformer <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>) and Hobbes (after the social philosopher <a href="Thomas%20Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a>), allegedly as a "tip of the hat" to the <a href="political%20science">political science</a> department at Kenyon. In "The Complete Calvin and Hobbes", Watterson stated that Calvin is named for "a 16th-century theologian who believed in <a href="predestination">predestination</a>," and Hobbes for "a 17th-century philosopher with a dim view of human nature."

Watterson wrote a brief, tongue-in-cheek autobiography in the late 1980s.

Watterson was inspired by the work of "<a href="Cincinnati%20Enquirer">Cincinnati Enquirer</a>" <a href="political%20cartoonist">political cartoonist</a> <a href="Jim%20Borgman">Jim Borgman</a>, a 1976 graduate of Kenyon College, who currently draws "<a href="Zits%20%28comic%20strip%29">Zits</a>", and decided to try to follow the same career path as Borgman, who in turn offered support and encouragement to the aspiring artist. Watterson graduated in 1980 and was hired on a trial basis at the "<a href="Cincinnati%20Post">Cincinnati Post</a>", a competing paper of the "Enquirer". Watterson quickly discovered that the job was full of unexpected challenges which prevented him from performing his duties to the standards set for him. Not the least of these challenges was his unfamiliarity with the Cincinnati political scene, as he had never resided in or near the city, having grown up in the <a href="Cleveland%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland</a> area and attending college in central Ohio. The "Post" abruptly fired Watterson before his contract was up.

He then joined a small advertising agency and worked there for four years as a designer, creating grocery advertisements while also working on his own projects, including development of his own cartoon strip and contributions to "Target: The Political Cartoon Quarterly".

As a freelance artist, Watterson has drawn other works for various merchandise, including album art for his brother's band, calendars, clothing graphics, educational books, magazine covers, posters, and post cards.

Watterson has said that he works for personal fulfillment. As he told the graduating class of 1990 at Kenyon College, "It's surprising how hard we'll work when the work is done just for ourselves." "Calvin and Hobbes" was first published on November 18, 1985. In "Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book", he wrote that his influences included <a href="Charles%20M.%20Schulz">Charles Schulz</a>'s "<a href="Peanuts">Peanuts</a>", <a href="Walt%20Kelly">Walt Kelly</a>'s "<a href="Pogo%20%28comics%29">Pogo</a>", and <a href="George%20Herriman">George Herriman</a>'s "<a href="Krazy%20Kat">Krazy Kat</a>". Watterson wrote the introduction to the first volume of "The Komplete Kolor Krazy Kat". Watterson's style also reflects the influence of <a href="Winsor%20McCay">Winsor McCay</a>'s "<a href="Little%20Nemo">Little Nemo in Slumberland</a>".

Like many artists, Watterson incorporated elements of his life, interests, beliefs, and values into his work—for example, his hobby as a cyclist, memories of his own father's speeches about "building character", and his views on merchandising and corporations. Watterson's cat Sprite very much inspired the personality and physical features of <a href="Hobbes%20%28Calvin%20and%20Hobbes%29">Hobbes</a>.

Watterson spent much of his career trying to change the climate of newspaper comics. He believed that the artistic value of comics was being undermined, and that the space which they occupied in newspapers continually decreased, subject to arbitrary whims of shortsighted publishers. Furthermore, he opined that art should not be judged by the medium for which it is created (i.e., there is no <a href="High%20culture">"high" art</a> or <a href="Low%20culture">"low" art</a>—just art).

For years, Watterson battled against pressure from publishers to merchandise his work, something that he felt would cheapen his comic. He refused to merchandise his creations on the grounds that displaying "Calvin and Hobbes" images on commercially sold mugs, stickers, and T-shirts would devalue the characters and their personalities. Watterson said that Universal kept putting pressure on him and said that he had signed his contract without fully perusing it because, as a new artist, he was happy to find a syndicate willing to give him a chance (two syndicates had denied Watterson). He added that the contract was so one-sided that, if Universal really wanted to, they could license his characters against his will, and could even fire him but continue "Calvin and Hobbes" with a new artist. Watterson's position eventually won out and he was able to renegotiate his contract so that he would receive all rights to his work, but later added that the licensing fight exhausted him and contributed to the need for a nine-month sabbatical in 1991.

Despite Watterson's efforts, many unofficial knockoffs have been found, including items that depict Calvin and Hobbes consuming alcohol or Calvin urinating on a logo. Watterson has said, "Only thieves and vandals have made money on "Calvin and Hobbes" merchandise."
This topic is explored by Nevin Martell, in his book, "Looking for Calvin and Hobbes: The Unconventional Story of Bill Watterson and His Revolutionary Comic Strip".

Watterson was critical of the prevailing format for the <a href="Sunday%20strip">Sunday comic strip</a> that was in place when he began drawing (and still is, to varying degrees). The typical layout consists of three rows with eight total squares, which take up half a page if published with its normal size. Some newspapers are restricted with space for their Sunday features and reduce the size of the strip. One of the more common ways is to cut out the top two panels, which Watterson believed forced him to waste the space on throwaway jokes that did not always fit the strip. While he was set to return from his first sabbatical, Watterson discussed with his syndicate a new format for "Calvin and Hobbes" that would enable him to use his space more efficiently and would almost require the papers to publish it as a half-page. Universal agreed that they would sell the strip as the half-page and nothing else, which garnered anger from papers and criticism for Watterson from both editors and some of his fellow cartoonists (whom he described as "unnecessarily hot tempered"). Eventually, Universal compromised and agreed to offer papers a choice between the full half-page or a reduced-sized version to alleviate concerns about the size issue. Watterson conceded that this caused him to lose space in many papers, but he said that, in the end, it was a benefit because he felt that he was giving the papers' readers a better strip for their money and editors were free not to run "Calvin and Hobbes" at their own risk. He added that he was not going to apologize for drawing a popular feature.

Watterson announced the end of "Calvin and Hobbes" on November 9, 1995, with the following letter to newspaper editors:

The last strip of "Calvin and Hobbes" was published on December 31, 1995.

Since the conclusion of "Calvin and Hobbes", Watterson has taken up painting, at one point drawing landscapes of the woods with his father. He has kept away from the public eye and has given no indication of resuming the strip, creating new works based on the strip's characters, or embarking on new commercial projects, though he has published several "Calvin and Hobbes" anthologies. He does not sign autographs or license his characters, staying true to his stated principles. In previous years Watterson was known to sneak autographed copies of his books onto the shelves of the Fireside Bookshop, a family-owned bookstore in his hometown of <a href="Chagrin%20Falls">Chagrin Falls</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>. He ended this practice after discovering that some of the autographed books were being sold online for high prices.

Watterson rarely gives interviews or makes public appearances. His lengthiest interviews include the cover story in "The Comics Journal" No. 127 in February 1989, an interview that appeared in a 1987 issue of "<a href="Honk%20%28magazine%29">Honk Magazine</a>", and one in a 2015 Watterson exhibition catalogue.

Watterson has been both complimentary and critical of modern cartoonists and comic strips. He has praised strips such as "<a href="Doonesbury">Doonesbury</a>", "<a href="FoxTrot">FoxTrot</a>", "<a href="For%20Better%20or%20For%20Worse">For Better or For Worse</a>", "<a href="The%20Far%20Side">The Far Side</a>", "<a href="Bloom%20County">Bloom County</a>", "<a href="Cathy">Cathy</a>", "<a href="Cul%20de%20Sac%20%28comic%20strip%29">Cul de Sac</a>", and "<a href="Pearls%20Before%20Swine%20%28comics%29">Pearls Before Swine</a>". He has also been critical of aging strips that suffer from recycled jokes and bland story lines, and of heavily licensed strips such as "<a href="Garfield">Garfield</a>".

On December 21, 1999, a short piece was published in the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", written by Watterson to mark the forthcoming retirement of iconic "<a href="Peanuts">Peanuts</a>" creator Charles Schulz.

In the years that followed the end of "Calvin and Hobbes", many attempts were made to locate Watterson in his hometown of Chagrin Falls. Both "<a href="The%20Plain%20Dealer">The Plain Dealer</a>" and the "<a href="Cleveland%20Scene">Cleveland Scene</a>" sent reporters in 1998 and 2003, respectively, but were unable to locate him.

In 2004, Watterson and his wife Melissa bought a home in the Cleveland suburb of <a href="Cleveland%20Heights%2C%20Ohio">Cleveland Heights, Ohio</a>. In 2005, they completed the move from their home in Chagrin Falls to their new residence.

In 2005, <a href="Gene%20Weingarten">Gene Weingarten</a> of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" sent Watterson the first edition of the "<a href="Barnaby%20%28comic%20strip%29">Barnaby</a>" book as an incentive, hoping to land an interview. Weingarten passed the book to Watterson's parents, along with a message, and declared that he would wait in his hotel for as long as it took Watterson to contact him. Watterson's editor Lee Salem called the next day to tell Weingarten that the cartoonist would not be coming.

In October 2005, Watterson answered 15 questions submitted by readers. In October 2007, he wrote a review of "Schulz and Peanuts" in "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>", a biography of Charles Schulz. In 2008, he provided a foreword for the first book collection of <a href="Richard%20Thompson%20%28cartoonist%29">Richard Thompson</a>'s "<a href="Cul%20de%20Sac%20%28comic%20strip%29">Cul de Sac</a>" comic strip.

In early 2010, Watterson was interviewed by "<a href="The%20Plain%20Dealer">The Plain Dealer</a>" on the 15th anniversary of the end of "Calvin and Hobbes". Explaining his decision to discontinue the strip, he said,

In April 2011, a representative for <a href="Andrews%20McMeel">Andrews McMeel</a> received a package from a "William Watterson in Cleveland Heights, Ohio" which contained a 6" x 8" oil-on-board painting of "<a href="Cul%20de%20Sac%20%28comic%20strip%29">Cul de Sac</a>" character Petey Otterloop, done by Watterson for the "Team Cul de Sac" fundraising project for <a href="Parkinson%27s%20Disease">Parkinson's Disease</a>. His syndicate has since become <a href="Universal%20Uclick">Universal Uclick</a>, and they said that the painting was the first new artwork from Watterson that the syndicate has seen since "Calvin and Hobbes" ended in 1995.

In October 2013, the magazine "<a href="Mental%20Floss">Mental Floss</a>" published an interview with Watterson, only the second since the strip ended. Watterson again confirmed that he would not be revisiting "Calvin and Hobbes", and that he was satisfied with his decision. He also gave his opinion on the changes in the comic book industry and where it would be headed in the future:

In 2013 the documentary "<a href="Dear%20Mr.%20Watterson">Dear Mr. Watterson</a>", exploring the cultural impact of "Calvin and Hobbes", was released.

On February 26, 2014, Watterson published his first cartoon since the end of "Calvin and Hobbes": a poster for the documentary "<a href="Stripped%20%28film%29">Stripped</a>".

In June 2014, three strips of "<a href="Pearls%20Before%20Swine%20%28comics%29">Pearls Before Swine</a>" (published June 4, June 5, and June 6, 2014) featured guest illustrations by Watterson after cartoonist <a href="Stephan%20Pastis">Stephan Pastis</a> communicated with him via e-mail. Pastis likened this unexpected collaboration to getting "a glimpse of Bigfoot". "I thought maybe Stephan and I could do this goofy collaboration and then use the result to raise some money for Parkinson's research in honor of <a href="Richard%20Thompson%20%28cartoonist%29">Richard Thompson</a>. It seemed like a perfect convergence", Watterson told the "Washington Post". The day that Stephan Pastis returned to his own strip, he paid tribute to Watterson by alluding to the final <a href="Calvin%20and%20Hobbes">Calvin and Hobbes</a> strip from December 31, 1995.

On November 5, 2014, a poster was unveiled, drawn by Watterson for the 2015 <a href="Angoul%C3%AAme%20International%20Comics%20Festival">Angoulême International Comics Festival</a> where he was awarded the Grand Prix in 2014.

On April 1, 2016 for <a href="April%20Fools%20Day">April Fools Day</a>, <a href="Berkeley%20Breathed">Berkeley Breathed</a> posted on Facebook that Watterson had signed "the franchise over to my 'administration'". He then posted a comic with Calvin, Hobbes, and Opus all featured. The comic is signed by Watterson, though it remains to be seen how involved he actually was. Breathed posted another "Calvin County" strip featuring Calvin and Hobbes, also "signed" by Watterson on April 1, 2017, along with a fake "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" story ostensibly detailing the "merger" of the two strips.

In 2001, <a href="Billy%20Ireland%20Cartoon%20Library%20%26amp%3B%20Museum">Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum</a> at <a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State University</a> mounted an exhibition of Watterson's <a href="Sunday%20strip">Sunday strip</a>s. He chose thirty-six of his favorites, displaying them with both the original drawing and the colored finished product, with most pieces featuring personal annotations. Watterson also wrote an accompanying essay that served as the foreword for the exhibit, called "Calvin and Hobbes: Sunday Pages 1985–1995". which opened on September 10, 2001. It was taken down in January 2002. The accompanying published catalog had the same title.

From March 22 to August 3, 2014, Watterson exhibited again at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum at Ohio State University. In conjunction with this exhibition, Watterson also participated in an interview with the school. An exhibition catalog named "Exploring Calvin and Hobbes" was released with the exhibit. The book contained a lengthy interview with Bill Watterson, conducted by Jenny Robb, the curator of the museum.

Watterson was awarded the <a href="National%20Cartoonists%20Society">National Cartoonists Society</a>'s Reuben Award in both 1986 and 1988. Watterson's second Reuben win made him the youngest cartoonist to be so honored, and only the sixth person to win twice, following <a href="Milton%20Caniff">Milton Caniff</a>, <a href="Charles%20Schulz">Charles Schulz</a>, <a href="Dik%20Browne">Dik Browne</a>, <a href="Chester%20Gould">Chester Gould</a>, and <a href="Jeff%20MacNelly">Jeff MacNelly</a>. (<a href="Gary%20Larson">Gary Larson</a> is the only cartoonist to win a second Reuben since Watterson.) In 2014, Watterson was awarded the Grand Prix at the <a href="Angoul%C3%AAme%20International%20Comics%20Festival">Angoulême International Comics Festival</a> for his body of work, becoming just the fourth non-European cartoonist to be so honored in the first 41 years of the event.

Black is the darkest <a href="color">color</a>, the result of the absence or complete <a href="Absorption%20%28electromagnetic%20radiation%29">absorption</a> of <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible</a> <a href="light">light</a>. It is an achromatic color, literally a color without <a href="hue">hue</a>, like <a href="white">white</a> (its <a href="complementary%20colors">opposite</a>) and <a href="gray">gray</a>. It is often used <a href="symbol">symbol</a>ically or <a href="figurative%20language">figuratively</a> to represent darkness, while <a href="white">white</a> represents light.

Black <a href="ink">ink</a> is the most common color used for printing books, newspapers and documents, because it has the highest contrast with white paper and is the easiest to read. For the same reason, black text on a white screen is the most common format used on computer screens.
In <a href="color%20printing">color printing</a> it is <a href="CMYK%20color%20model">used along with</a> the <a href="subtractive%20color">subtractive</a> <a href="primary%20color">primaries</a> <a href="cyan">cyan</a>, <a href="yellow">yellow</a>, and <a href="magenta">magenta</a>, in order to help produce the darkest shades.

Black and white have often been used to describe opposites; particularly truth and ignorance, good and evil, the "Dark Ages" versus <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>. Since the Middle Ages black has been the symbolic color of solemnity and authority, and for this reason is still commonly worn by judges and magistrates. 

Black was one of the first colors used by artists in <a href="neolithic">neolithic</a> cave paintings. In the 14th century, it began to be worn by royalty, the clergy, judges and government officials in much of Europe. It became the color worn by English romantic poets, businessmen and statesmen in the 19th century, and a high fashion color in the 20th century.

In the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, it became the color of mourning, and over the centuries it was frequently associated with death, evil, witches and magic. According to surveys in Europe and North America, it is the color most commonly associated with mourning, the end, secrets, magic, force, violence, evil, and elegance.
The word "black" comes from <a href="Old%20English%20language">Old English</a> "blæc" ("black, dark", "also", "ink"), from <a href="Proto-Germanic">Proto-Germanic</a> *"blakkaz" ("burned"), from <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> *"bhleg-" ("to burn, gleam, shine, flash"), from base *"bhel-" ("to shine"), related to <a href="Old%20Saxon%20language">Old Saxon</a> "blak" ("ink"), <a href="Old%20High%20German">Old High German</a> "blach" ("black"), <a href="Old%20Norse%20language">Old Norse</a> "blakkr" ("dark"), <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> "blaken" ("to burn"), and <a href="Swedish%20language">Swedish</a> "bläck" ("ink"). More distant cognates include <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "flagrare" ("to blaze, glow, burn"), and <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "phlegein" ("to burn, scorch").

The Ancient Greeks sometimes used the same word to name different colors, if they had the same intensity. "Kuanos"' could mean both dark blue and black.

The Ancient Romans had two words for black: "ater" was a flat, dull black, while "niger" was a brilliant, saturated black. "Ater" has vanished from the vocabulary, but "niger" was the source of the country name "Nigeria" the English word "Negro" and the word for "black" in most modern <a href="Romance%20languages">Romance languages</a> (<a href="French%20language">French</a>: "noir"; <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish and Portuguese</a>: "negro"; <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>: "nero" ).

<a href="Old%20High%20German">Old High German</a> also had two words for black: "swartz" for dull black and "blach" for a luminous black. These are parallelled in <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> by the terms "swart" for dull black and "blaek" for luminous black. "Swart" still survives as the word "swarthy", while "blaek" became the modern English "black".

In heraldry, the word used for the black color is <a href="sable%20%28heraldry%29">sable</a>, named for the black fur of the <a href="sable">sable</a>, an animal.

Black was one of the first colors used in art. The <a href="Lascaux%20Cave">Lascaux Cave</a> in France contains drawings of bulls and other animals drawn by <a href="paleolithic">paleolithic</a> artists between 18,000 and 17,000 years ago. They began by using charcoal, and then made more vivid black pigments by burning bones or grinding a powder of <a href="manganese%20oxide">manganese oxide</a>.

For the ancient Egyptians, black had positive associations; being the color of fertility and the rich black soil flooded by the Nile. It was the color of <a href="Anubis">Anubis</a>, the god of the underworld, who took the form of a black <a href="jackal">jackal</a>, and offered protection against evil to the dead.

For the ancient Greeks, black was also the color of the underworld, separated from the world of the living by the river <a href="Acheron">Acheron</a>, whose water was black. Those who had committed the worst sins were sent to <a href="Tartarus">Tartarus</a>, the deepest and darkest level. In the center was the palace of <a href="Hades">Hades</a>, the king of the underworld, where he was seated upon a black <a href="ebony">ebony</a> throne.

Black was one of the most important colors used by ancient Greek artists. In the 6th century BC, they began making <a href="black-figure%20pottery">black-figure pottery</a> and later <a href="red%20figure%20pottery">red figure pottery</a>, using a highly original technique. In black-figure pottery, the artist would paint figures with a glossy clay <a href="slip%20%28ceramics%29">slip</a> on a red clay pot. When the pot was fired, the figures painted with the slip would turn black, against a red background. Later they reversed the process, painting the spaces between the figures with slip. This created magnificent red figures against a glossy black background.

In the social hierarchy of <a href="ancient%20Rome">ancient Rome</a>, purple was the color reserved for the Emperor; red was the color worn by soldiers (red cloaks for the officers, red tunics for the soldiers); white the color worn by the priests, and black was worn by craftsmen and artisans. The black they wore was not deep and rich; the vegetable dyes used to make black were not solid or lasting, so the blacks often turned out faded gray or brown.

In <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, the word for black, "ater" and to darken, "atere", were associated with cruelty, brutality and evil. They were the root of the English words "atrocious" and "atrocity".

Black was also the Roman color of death and mourning. In the 2nd century BC Roman magistrates began to wear a dark toga, called a "toga pulla", to funeral ceremonies. Later, under the Empire, the family of the deceased also wore dark colors for a long period; then, after a banquet to mark the end of mourning, exchanged the black for a white toga. In Roman poetry, death was called the "hora nigra", the black hour.

The German and Scandinavian peoples worshipped their own goddess of the night, <a href="N%C3%B3tt">Nótt</a>, who crossed the sky in a chariot drawn by a black horse. They also feared <a href="Hel%20%28being%29">Hel</a>, the goddess of the kingdom of the dead, whose skin was black on one side and red on the other. They also held sacred the <a href="raven">raven</a>. They believed that <a href="Odin">Odin</a>, the king of the Nordic pantheon, had two black ravens, Huginn and Muninn, who served as his agents, traveling the world for him, watching and listening.
In the early Middle Ages, black was commonly associated with darkness and evil. In Medieval paintings, the devil was usually depicted as having human form, but with wings and black skin or hair.

In fashion, black did not have the prestige of red, the color of the nobility. It was worn by <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> monks as a sign of humility and penitence. In the 12th century a famous theological dispute broke out between the <a href="Cistercian">Cistercian</a> monks, who wore white, and the Benedictines, who wore black. A Benedictine abbot, Pierre the Venerable, accused the Cistercians of excessive pride in wearing white instead of black. Saint <a href="Bernard%20of%20Clairvaux">Bernard of Clairvaux</a>, the founder of the Cistercians responded that black was the color of the devil, hell, "of death and sin," while white represented "purity, innocence and all the virtues".

Black symbolized both power and secrecy in the medieval world. The emblem of the Holy Roman Empire of Germany was a black eagle. The <a href="black%20knight">black knight</a> in the poetry of the Middle Ages was an enigmatic figure, hiding his identity, usually wrapped in secrecy.

Black <a href="ink">ink</a>, invented in Ancient China and India, was traditionally used in the Middle Ages for writing, for the simple reason that black was the darkest color and therefore provided the greatest contrast with white paper or parchment, making it the easiest color to read. It became even more important in the 15th century, with the invention of <a href="printing">printing</a>. A new kind of ink, printer's ink, was created out of <a href="soot">soot</a>, <a href="turpentine">turpentine</a> and <a href="walnut%20oil">walnut oil</a>. The new ink made it possible to spread ideas to a mass audience through printed books, and to popularize art through black and white engravings and prints. Because of its contrast and clarity, black ink on white paper continued to be the standard for printing books, newspapers and documents; and for the same reason black text on a white background is the most common format used on computer screens.

In the early Middle Ages, princes, nobles and the wealthy usually wore bright colors, particularly scarlet cloaks from Italy. Black was rarely part of the wardrobe of a noble family. The one exception was the fur of the <a href="sable">sable</a>. This glossy black fur, from an animal of the <a href="marten">marten</a> family, was the finest and most expensive fur in Europe. It was imported from Russia and Poland and used to trim the robes and gowns of royalty.

In the 14th century, the status of black began to change. First, high-quality black dyes began to arrive on the market, allowing garments of a deep, rich black. Magistrates and government officials began to wear black robes, as a sign of the importance and seriousness of their positions. A third reason was the passage of <a href="sumptuary%20laws">sumptuary laws</a> in some parts of Europe which prohibited the wearing of costly clothes and certain colors by anyone except members of the nobility. The famous bright scarlet cloaks from <a href="Venice">Venice</a> and the peacock blue fabrics from <a href="Florence">Florence</a> were restricted to the nobility. The wealthy bankers and merchants of northern Italy responded by changing to black robes and gowns, made with the most expensive fabrics.

The change to the more austere but elegant black was quickly picked up by the kings and nobility. It began in northern Italy, where the Duke of Milan and the Count of Savoy and the rulers of Mantua, Ferrara, Rimini and Urbino began to dress in black. It then spread to France, led by <a href="Louis%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orleans">Louis I, Duke of Orleans</a>, younger brother of King <a href="Charles%20VI%20of%20France">Charles VI of France</a>. It moved to England at the end of the reign of King <a href="Richard%20II">Richard II</a> (1377–1399), where all the court began to wear black. In 1419–20, black became the color of the powerful Duke of Burgundy, <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Philip the Good</a>. It moved to Spain, where it became the color of the Spanish Habsburgs, of <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a> and of his son, <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II of Spain</a> (1527–1598). European rulers saw it as the color of power, dignity, humility and temperance. By the end of the 16th century, it was the color worn by almost all the monarchs of Europe and their courts.

While black was the color worn by the Catholic rulers of Europe, it was also the emblematic color of the Protestant Reformation in Europe and the Puritans in England and America. <a href="Jean%20Calvin">Jean Calvin</a>, <a href="Melanchton">Melanchton</a> and other Protestant theologians denounced the richly colored and decorated interiors of Roman Catholic churches. They saw the color red, worn by the Pope and his Cardinals, as the color of luxury, sin, and human folly. In some northern European cities, mobs attacked churches and cathedrals, smashed the stained glass windows and defaced the statues and decoration. In Protestant doctrine, clothing was required to be sober, simple and discreet. Bright colors were banished and replaced by blacks, browns and grays; women and children were recommended to wear white.

In the Protestant Netherlands, <a href="Rembrandt%20Van%20Rijn">Rembrandt Van Rijn</a> used this sober new palette of blacks and browns to create portraits whose faces emerged from the shadows expressing the deepest human emotions. The Catholic painters of the Counter-Reformation, like <a href="Rubens">Rubens</a>, went in the opposite direction; they filled their paintings with bright and rich colors. The new <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> churches of the <a href="Counter-Reformation">Counter-Reformation</a> were usually shining white inside and filled with statues, frescoes, marble, gold and colorful paintings, to appeal to the public. But European Catholics of all classes, like Protestants, eventually adopted a sober wardrobe that was mostly black, brown and gray.
In the second part of the 17th century, Europe and America experienced an epidemic of fear of <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>. People widely believed that the devil appeared at midnight in a ceremony called a <a href="black%20mass">black mass</a> or black sabbath, usually in the form of a black animal, often a goat, a dog, a wolf, a bear, a deer or a rooster, accompanied by their <a href="familiar%20spirits">familiar spirits</a>, black cats, serpents and other black creatures. This was the origin of the widespread superstition about black cats and other black animals. In Medieval <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>, in a ceremony called "Kattenstoet," black cats were thrown from the belfry of the Cloth Hall of <a href="Ypres">Ypres</a> to ward off witchcraft.

Witch trials were common in both Europe and America during this period. During the notorious <a href="Salem%20witch%20trials">Salem witch trials</a> in New England in 1692–93, one of those on trial was accused of being able turn into a "black thing with a blue cap," and others of having familiars in the form of a black dog, a black cat and a black bird. Nineteen women and men were hanged as witches.
In the 18th century, during the European <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>, black receded as a fashion color. Paris became the fashion capital, and pastels, blues, greens, yellow and white became the colors of the nobility and upper classes. But after the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, black again became the dominant color.

Black was the color of the <a href="industrial%20revolution">industrial revolution</a>, largely fueled by <a href="coal">coal</a>, and later by oil. Thanks to coal <a href="smoke">smoke</a>, the buildings of the large cities of Europe and America gradually turned <a href="black%20carbon">black</a>. By 1846 the industrial area of the West Midlands of England was "commonly called 'the <a href="Black%20Country">Black Country</a>'”. <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> and other writers described the dark streets and smoky skies of London, and they were vividly illustrated in the engravings of French artist <a href="Gustave%20Dor%C3%A9">Gustave Doré</a>.

A different kind of black was an important part of the <a href="romantic%20movement">romantic movement</a> in literature. Black was the color of <a href="Melancholia">melancholy</a>, the dominant theme of romanticism. The novels of the period were filled with castles, ruins, dungeons, storms, and meetings at midnight. The leading poets of the movement were usually portrayed dressed in black, usually with a white shirt and open collar, and a scarf carelessly over their shoulder, <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a> and Lord Byron helped create the enduring stereotype of the romantic poet.

The invention of new, inexpensive synthetic black dyes and the industrialization of the textile industry meant that good-quality black clothes were available for the first time to the general population. In the 19th century gradually black became the most popular color of business dress of the upper and middle classes in England, the Continent, and America.

Black dominated literature and fashion in the 19th century, and played a large role in painting. <a href="James%20McNeil%20Whistler">James McNeil Whistler</a> made the color the subject of his most famous painting, "Arrangement in grey and black number one" (1871), better known as "<a href="Whistler%27s%20Mother">Whistler's Mother</a>".

Some 19th-century French painters had a low opinion of black: "Reject black," <a href="Paul%20Gauguin">Paul Gauguin</a> said, "and that mix of black and white they call gray. Nothing is black, nothing is gray." But <a href="%C3%89douard%20Manet">Édouard Manet</a> used blacks for their strength and dramatic effect. Manet's portrait of painter <a href="Berthe%20Morisot">Berthe Morisot</a> was a study in black which perfectly captured her spirit of independence. The black gave the painting power and immediacy; he even changed her eyes, which were green, to black to strengthen the effect. <a href="Henri%20Matisse">Henri Matisse</a> quoted the French impressionist <a href="Pissarro">Pissarro</a> telling him, "Manet is stronger than us all – he made light with black."

<a href="Pierre-Auguste%20Renoir">Pierre-Auguste Renoir</a> used luminous blacks, especially in his portraits. When someone told him that black was not a color, Renoir replied: "What makes you think that? Black is the queen of colors. I always detested Prussian blue. I tried to replace black with a mixture of red and blue, I tried using cobalt blue or ultramarine, but I always came back to ivory black."

<a href="Vincent%20van%20Gogh">Vincent van Gogh</a> used black lines to outline many of the objects in his paintings, such as the bed in the famous painting of his bedroom. making them stand apart. His painting of black crows over a cornfield, painted shortly before he died, was particularly agitated and haunting.

In the late 19th century, black also became the color of <a href="anarchism">anarchism</a>. (See the section <a href="Black%23Political%20movements">political movements</a>.)

In the 20th century, black was the color of Italian and German <a href="fascism">fascism</a>. (See the section <a href="Black%23Political%20movements">political movements</a>.)

In art, black regained some of the territory that it had lost during the 19th century. The Russian painter <a href="Kasimir%20Malevich">Kasimir Malevich</a>, a member of the <a href="Suprematist">Suprematist</a> movement, created the <a href="Black%20Square%20%28painting%29">Black Square</a> in 1915, is widely considered the first purely abstract painting. He wrote, "The painted work is no longer simply the imitation of reality, but is this very reality ... It is not a demonstration of ability, but the materialization of an idea."

Black was also appreciated by <a href="Henri%20Matisse">Henri Matisse</a>. "When I didn't know what color to put down, I put down black," he said in 1945. "Black is a force: I used black as ballast to simplify the construction ... Since the impressionists it seems to have made continuous progress, taking a more and more important part in color orchestration, comparable to that of the double bass as a solo instrument."

In the 1950s, black came to be a symbol of individuality and intellectual and social rebellion, the color of those who didn't accept established norms and values. In Paris, it was worn by Left-Bank intellectuals and performers such as <a href="Juliette%20Greco">Juliette Greco</a>, and by some members of the <a href="Beat%20Movement">Beat Movement</a> in New York and San Francisco. Black leather jackets were worn by motorcycle gangs such as the <a href="Hells%20Angels">Hells Angels</a> and street gangs on the fringes of society in the United States. Black as a color of rebellion was celebrated in such films as <a href="The%20Wild%20One">The Wild One</a>, with <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a>. By the end of the 20th century, black was the emblematic color of the <a href="punk%20subculture">punk subculture</a> <a href="punk%20fashion">punk fashion</a>, and the <a href="goth%20subculture">goth subculture</a>. Goth fashion, which emerged in England in the 1980s, was inspired by <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> mourning dress.

In men's fashion, black gradually ceded its dominance to navy blue, particularly in business suits. Black evening dress and formal dress in general were worn less and less. In 1960, <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> was the last American President to be inaugurated wearing formal dress; President <a href="Lyndon%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> and all his successors were inaugurated wearing business suits.

Women's fashion was revolutionized and simplified in 1926 by the French designer <a href="Coco%20Chanel">Coco Chanel</a>, who published a drawing of a simple black dress in "Vogue" magazine. She famously said, "A woman needs just three things; a black dress, a black sweater, and, on her arm, a man she loves." Other designers contributed to the trend of the <a href="little%20black%20dress">little black dress</a>. The Italian designer <a href="Gianni%20Versace">Gianni Versace</a> said, "Black is the quintessence of simplicity and elegance," and French designer <a href="Yves%20Saint%20Laurent%20%28designer%29">Yves Saint Laurent</a> said, "black is the liaison which connects art and fashion. One of the most famous black dresses of the century was designed by <a href="Hubert%20de%20Givenchy">Hubert de Givenchy</a> and was worn by <a href="Audrey%20Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a> in the 1961 film "<a href="Breakfast%20at%20Tiffany%27s%20%28film%29">Breakfast at Tiffany's</a>".

The American <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> in the 1950s was a struggle for the political equality of <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a>. It developed into the <a href="Black%20Power">Black Power</a> movement in the late 1960s and 1970s, and popularized the slogan "<a href="Black%20is%20Beautiful">Black is Beautiful</a>".

In the 1990s, the <a href="Black%20Standard">Black Standard</a> became the banner of several <a href="Islamic%20extremist">Islamic extremist</a>, <a href="jihadist">jihadist</a> groups. (See the section <a href="Black%23Political%20movements">political movements</a>.)

In the <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible spectrum</a>, black is the absorption of all colors.

Black can be defined as the visual impression experienced when no <a href="visible%20light">visible light</a> reaches the eye. <a href="Pigment">Pigment</a>s or <a href="dye">dye</a>s that absorb light rather than reflect it back to the eye "look black". A black pigment can, however, result from a "combination" of several pigments that collectively absorb all colors. If appropriate proportions of three primary pigments are mixed, the result reflects so little light as to be called "black".

This provides two superficially opposite but actually complementary descriptions of black. Black is the absorption of all colors of light, or an exhaustive combination of multiple colors of pigment. See also <a href="primary%20colors">primary colors</a>.

In <a href="physics">physics</a>, a <a href="black%20body">black body</a> is a perfect absorber of light, but, by a thermodynamic rule, it is also the best emitter. Thus, the best radiative cooling, out of sunlight, is by using black paint, though it is important that it be black (a nearly perfect absorber) in the <a href="infrared">infrared</a> as well.

In elementary science, far <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light is called "<a href="black%20light">black light</a>" because, while itself unseen, it causes many minerals and other substances to <a href="Phosphorescence">fluoresce</a>.

On January 16, 2008, researchers from <a href="Troy%2C%20New%20York">Troy, New York</a>'s <a href="Rensselaer%20Polytechnic%20Institute">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a> announced the creation of the then darkest material on the planet. The material, which reflected only 0.045 percent of light, was created from <a href="carbon%20nanotube">carbon nanotube</a>s stood on end. This is 1/30 of the light reflected by the current standard for blackness, and one third the light reflected by the previous record holder for darkest substance. As of February 2016, the current darkest material known is claimed to be <a href="Vantablack">Vantablack</a>.

A material is said to be black if most incoming light is <a href="Absorption%20%28electromagnetic%20radiation%29">absorbed</a> equally in the material. Light (<a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> in the <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible spectrum</a>) <a href="Interaction%23Physics">interacts</a> with the <a href="atom">atom</a>s and <a href="molecule">molecule</a>s, which causes the energy of the light to be converted into other forms of energy, usually heat. This means that black surfaces can act as thermal collectors, absorbing light and generating heat (see <a href="Solar%20thermal%20collector">Solar thermal collector</a>).

Absorption of light is contrasted by <a href="Transmittance">transmission</a>, <a href="Reflection%20%28physics%29">reflection</a> and <a href="Diffuse%20reflection">diffusion</a>, where the light is only redirected, causing objects to appear transparent, reflective or white respectively.

The earliest pigments used by Neolithic man were <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a>, <a href="red%20ocher">red ocher</a> and <a href="yellow%20ocher">yellow ocher</a>. The black lines of cave art were drawn with the tips of burnt torches made of a wood with <a href="resin">resin</a>.

Different charcoal pigments were made by burning different woods and animal products, each of which produced a different tone. The charcoal would be ground and then mixed with animal fat to make the pigment.

The 15th-century painter Cennino Cennini described how this pigment was made during the Renaissance in his famous handbook for artists: "...there is a black which is made from the tendrils of vines. And these tendrils need to be burned. And when they have been burned, throw some water onto them and put them out and then mull them in the same way as the other black. And this is a lean and black pigment and is one of the perfect pigments that we use."

Cennini also noted that "There is <a href="peach%20black">another black</a> which is made from burnt almond shells or peaches and this is a perfect, fine black." Similar fine blacks were made by burning the pits of the <a href="peach">peach</a>, <a href="cherry">cherry</a> or <a href="apricot">apricot</a>. The powdered charcoal was then mixed with <a href="gum%20arabic">gum arabic</a> or the yellow of an egg to make a paint.

Different civilizations burned different plants to produce their charcoal pigments. The <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a> of Alaska used wood charcoal mixed with the blood of <a href="Pinniped">seals</a> to paint masks and wooden objects. The Polynesians burned <a href="coconut">coconut</a>s to produce their pigment.

Good-quality black <a href="dyes">dyes</a> were not known until the middle of the 14th century. The most common early dyes were made from bark, roots or fruits of different trees; usually the <a href="walnut">walnut</a>, <a href="chestnut">chestnut</a>, or certain <a href="oak">oak</a> trees. The blacks produced were often more gray, brown or bluish. The cloth had to be dyed several times to darken the color. One solution used by dyers was add to the dye some iron filings, rich in iron oxide, which gave a deeper black. Another was to first dye the fabric dark blue, and then to dye it black.

A much richer and deeper black dye was eventually found made from the <a href="Oak%20apple">Oak apple</a> or gall-nut. The gall-nut is a small round tumor which grows on oak and other varieties of trees. They range in size from 2–5 cm, and are caused by chemicals injected by the <a href="larva">larva</a> of certain kinds of <a href="gall%20wasp">gall wasp</a> in the family Cynipidae. The dye was very expensive; a great quantity of gall-nuts were needed for a very small amount of dye. The gall-nuts which made the best dye came from <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, eastern Europe, the near east and North Africa. Beginning in about the 14th century, dye from gall-nuts was used for clothes of the kings and princes of Europe.

Another important source of natural black dyes from the 17th century onwards was the <a href="logwood%20tree">logwood tree</a>, or <a href="Haematoxylum%20campechianum">Haematoxylum campechianum</a>, which also produced reddish and bluish dyes. It is a species of <a href="Flowering%20plant">flowering</a> <a href="tree">tree</a> in the <a href="legume">legume</a> family, <a href="Fabaceae">Fabaceae</a>, that is native to southern <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and northern <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>. The modern nation of <a href="Belize">Belize</a> grew from 17th century <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">English</a> logwood logging camps.

Since the mid-19th century, synthetic black dyes have largely replaced natural dyes. One of the important synthetic blacks is <a href="Nigrosin">Nigrosin</a>, a mixture of synthetic black dyes (CI 50415, Solvent black 5) made by heating a mixture of <a href="nitrobenzene">nitrobenzene</a>, <a href="aniline">aniline</a> and aniline hydrochloride in the presence of a <a href="copper">copper</a> or <a href="iron">iron</a> <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a>. Its main industrial uses are as a colorant for lacquers and varnishes and in marker-pen inks.

The first known inks were made by the Chinese, and date back to the 23rd century B.C. They used natural plant dyes and minerals such as <a href="graphite">graphite</a> ground with water and applied with an <a href="ink%20brush">ink brush</a>. Early Chinese inks similar to the modern <a href="inkstick">inkstick</a> have been found dating to about 256 BC at the end of the <a href="Warring%20States%20period">Warring States period</a>. They were produced from <a href="soot">soot</a>, usually produced by burning pine wood, mixed with <a href="animal%20glue">animal glue</a>. To make ink from an inkstick, the stick is continuously ground against an <a href="inkstone">inkstone</a> with a small quantity of water to produce a dark liquid which is then applied with an <a href="ink%20brush">ink brush</a>. Artists and calligraphists could vary the thickness of the resulting ink by reducing or increasing the intensity and time of ink grinding. These inks produced the delicate shading and subtle or dramatic effects of <a href="Chinese%20brush%20painting">Chinese brush painting</a>.

<a href="India%20ink">India ink</a> (or Indian ink in <a href="British%20English">British English</a>) is a black <a href="ink">ink</a> once widely used for writing and printing and now more commonly used for <a href="drawing">drawing</a>, especially when inking <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a>s and <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a>s. The technique of making it probably came from China. India ink has been in use in <a href="India">India</a> since at least the 4th century BC, where it was called "masi". In India, the black color of the ink came from <a href="bone%20char">bone char</a>, <a href="tar">tar</a>, <a href="pitch%20%28resin%29">pitch</a> and other substances.

The Ancient Romans had a black writing ink they called "<a href="atramentum">atramentum</a> librarium". Its name came from the Latin word "atrare", which meant to make something black. (This was the same root as the English word "atrocious".) It was usually made, like India ink, from <a href="soot">soot</a>, although one variety, called "atramentum elephantinum", was made by burning the ivory of elephants.

Gall-nuts were also used for making fine black writing ink. <a href="Iron%20gall%20ink">Iron gall ink</a> (also known as iron gall nut ink or oak gall ink) was a purple-black or brown-black <a href="ink">ink</a> made from <a href="iron">iron</a> salts and <a href="tannic%20acid">tannic acid</a>s from gall nut. It was the standard writing and drawing <a href="ink">ink</a> in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, from about the 12th century to the 19th century, and remained in use well into the 20th century.


The fact that <a href="outer%20space">outer space</a> is black is sometimes called <a href="Olbers%27%20paradox">Olbers' paradox</a>. In theory, because the universe is full of stars, and is believed to be infinitely large, it would be expected that the light of an infinite number of stars would be enough to brilliantly light the whole universe all the time. However, the background color of outer space is black. This contradiction was first noted in 1823 by German astronomer <a href="Heinrich%20Wilhelm%20Matthias%20Olbers">Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers</a>, who posed the question of why the night sky was black.

The current accepted answer is that, although the universe is infinitely large, it is not infinitely old. It is thought to be about 13.8 billion years old, so we can only see objects as far away as the distance light can travel in 13.8 billion years. Light from stars farther away has not reached Earth, and cannot contribute to making the sky bright. Furthermore, as the universe is expanding, many stars are moving away from Earth. As they move, the wavelength of their light becomes longer, through the <a href="Doppler%20effect">Doppler effect</a>, and shifts toward red, or even becomes invisible. As a result of these two phenomena, there is not enough starlight to make space anything but black.

The daytime sky on Earth is blue because light from the Sun strikes molecules in Earth's atmosphere scattering light in all directions. Blue light is scattered more than other colors, and reaches the eye in greater quantities, making the daytime sky appear blue. This is known as <a href="Rayleigh%20scattering">Rayleigh scattering</a>.

The nighttime sky on Earth is black because the part of Earth experiencing night is facing away from the Sun, the light of the Sun is blocked by Earth itself, and there is no other bright nighttime source of light in the vicinity. Thus, there is not enough light to undergo Rayleigh scattering and make the sky blue. On the Moon, on the other hand, because there is no atmosphere to scatter the light, the sky is black both day and night. This phenomenon also holds true for other locations without an atmosphere.

In China, the color black is associated with water, one of the five fundamental elements believed to compose all things; and with winter, cold, and the direction north, usually symbolized by a black tortoise. It is also associated with disorder, including the positive disorder which leads to change and new life. When the first Emperor of China <a href="Qin%20Shi%20Huang">Qin Shi Huang</a> seized power from the <a href="Zhou%20Dynasty">Zhou Dynasty</a>, he changed the Imperial color from red to black, saying that black extinguished red. Only when the <a href="Han%20Dynasty">Han Dynasty</a> appeared in 206 BC was red restored as the imperial color.

The Chinese and Japanese character for black ("kuro" in Japanese), can, depending upon the context, also mean dark or evil.

In Japan, black is associated with mystery, the night, the unknown, the supernatural, the invisible and death. Combined with white, it can symbolize intuition.

In Japan in the 10th and 11th century, it was believed that wearing black could bring misfortune. It was worn at court by those who wanted to set themselves apart from the established powers or who had renounced material possessions.

In Japan black can also symbolize experience, as opposed to white, which symbolizes naiveté. The black belt in martial arts symbolizes experience, while a white belt is worn by novices. Japanese men traditionally wear a black kimono with some white decoration on their wedding day.

In Indonesia black is associated with depth, the subterranean world, demons, disaster, and the left hand. When black is combined with white, however, it symbolizes harmony and equilibrium.

Anarchism is a political philosophy, most popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which holds that governments and capitalism are harmful and undesirable. The <a href="Anarchist%20symbolism">symbols of anarchism</a> was usually either a black flag or a black letter A. More recently it is usually represented with a bisected red and black flag, to emphasise the movement's socialist roots in the <a href="International%20Workingmen%27s%20Association">First International</a>. Anarchism was most popular in Spain, France, Italy, Ukraine and Argentina. There were also small but influential movements in the United States and Russia. In the latter, the movement initially allied itself with the Bolsheviks.

The Black Army was a collection of anarchist military units which fought in the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a>, sometimes on the side of the Bolshevik <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a>, and sometimes for the opposing <a href="White%20Army">White Army</a>. It was officially known as the <a href="Revolutionary%20Insurrectionary%20Army%20of%20Ukraine">Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine</a>, and it was under the command of the famous anarchist <a href="Nestor%20Makhno">Nestor Makhno</a>.

Fascism. The <a href="Blackshirts">Blackshirts</a> () were <a href="Italian%20Fascism">Fascist</a> <a href="paramilitary">paramilitary</a> groups in <a href="History%20of%20Italy%20as%20a%20monarchy%20and%20in%20the%20World%20Wars">Italy</a> during the period immediately following <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and until the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The Blackshirts were officially known as the Voluntary Militia for National Security ("Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale", or MVSN).

Inspired by the black uniforms of the <a href="Arditi">Arditi</a>, Italy's elite storm troops of World War I, the Fascist Blackshirts were organized by <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> as the military tool of his political movement. They used violence and intimidation against Mussolini's opponents. The emblem of the Italian fascists was a black flag with <a href="fasces">fasces</a>, an axe in a bundle of sticks, an ancient Roman symbol of authority. Mussolini came to power in 1922 through his <a href="March%20on%20Rome">March on Rome</a> with the blackshirts.

Black was also adopted by <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and the <a href="Nazis">Nazis</a> in Germany. Red, white and black were the colors of the flag of the German Empire from 1870 to 1918. In "<a href="Mein%20Kampf">Mein Kampf</a>", Hitler explained that they were "revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past." Hitler also wrote that "the new flag ... should prove effective as a large poster" because "in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement." The black <a href="swastika">swastika</a> was meant to symbolize the <a href="Aryan">Aryan</a> race, which, according to the Nazis, "was always anti-Semitic and will always be anti-Semitic." Several designs by a number of different authors were considered, but the one adopted in the end was Hitler's personal design. Black became the color of the uniform of the <a href="SS">SS</a>, the "Schutzstaffel" or "defense corps", the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, and was worn by SS officers from 1932 until the end of World War II.

The Nazis used a <a href="black%20triangle%20%28badge%29">black triangle</a> to symbolize anti-social elements. The symbol originates from <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camp">Nazi concentration camp</a>s, where every prisoner had to wear one of the <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camp%20badges">Nazi concentration camp badges</a> on their jacket, the color of which categorized them according to "their kind." Many Black Triangle prisoners were either mentally disabled or mentally ill. The homeless were also included, as were alcoholics, the <a href="Romani%20people">Romani people</a>, the habitually "work-shy," prostitutes, draft dodgers and pacifists. More recently the black triangle has been adopted as a symbol in <a href="lesbian%20culture">lesbian culture</a> and by disabled activists.

Black shirts were also worn by the <a href="British%20Union%20of%20Fascists">British Union of Fascists</a> before World War II, and members of fascist movements in the Netherlands.

Patriotic Resistance. The <a href="L%C3%BCtzow%20Free%20Corps">Lützow Free Corps</a>, composed of volunteer German students and academics fighting against <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> in 1813, could not afford to make special uniforms and therefore adopted black, as the only color that could be used to dye their civilian clothing without the original color showing. In 1815 the students began to carry a red, black and gold flag, which they believed (incorrectly) had been the colors of the Holy Roman Empire (the imperial flag had actually been gold and black). In 1848, this banner became the flag of the <a href="German%20confederation">German confederation</a>. In 1866, <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> unified Germany under its rule, and imposed the red, white and black of its own flag, which remained the colors of the German flag until the end of the Second World War. In 1949 the Federal Republic of Germany returned to the original flag and colors of the students and professors of 1815, which is the flag of Germany today.

Islamism. The <a href="Black%20Standard">Black Standard</a> (, also known as "<a href="%3Awikt%3A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9">banner</a> of the <a href="%3Awikt%3A%D8%B9%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%23Arabic">eagle</a>" or simply as "the banner") is the historical flag flown by <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> in <a href="hadith">Islamic tradition</a>, an <a href="eschatology">eschatological</a> symbol in <a href="Shi%27a%20Islam">Shi'a Islam</a> (heralding the advent of the <a href="Mahdi">Mahdi</a>), and a symbol used in <a href="Islamism">Islamism</a> and <a href="Jihadism">Jihadism</a>.

Black has been a traditional color of cavalry and armoured or mechanized troops. German armoured troops (<a href="Panzerwaffe">Panzerwaffe</a>) traditionally wore black uniforms, and even in others, a <a href="black%20beret">black beret</a> is common. In Finland, black is the symbolic color for both armoured troops and combat engineers, and military units of these specialities have black flags and unit insignia.

The <a href="black%20beret">black beret</a> and the color black is also a symbol of special forces in many countries. Soviet and Russian <a href="OMON">OMON</a> special police and <a href="Naval%20Infantry%20%28Russia%29">Russian naval infantry</a> wear a black beret. A black beret is also worn by military police in the Canadian, Czech, Croatian, Portuguese, Spanish and Serbian armies.

The silver-on-black skull and crossbones symbol or <a href="Totenkopf">Totenkopf</a> and a black uniform were used by <a href="Hussar">Hussar</a>s and <a href="Black%20Brunswickers">Black Brunswickers</a>, the German <a href="Panzerwaffe">Panzerwaffe</a> and the Nazi <a href="Schutzstaffel">Schutzstaffel</a>, and U.S. <a href="400th%20Missile%20Squadron">400th Missile Squadron</a> (crossed missiles), and continues in use with the Estonian <a href="Kuperjanov%20Battalion">Kuperjanov Battalion</a>.


In Christianity, the <a href="Devil%20in%20Christianity">devil</a> is often called the "prince of darkness." The term was used in <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a>'s poem "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>", published in 1667, referring to <a href="Satan">Satan</a>, who is viewed as the embodiment of evil. It is an English translation of the Latin phrase "princeps tenebrarum", which occurs in the "<a href="Acts%20of%20Pilate">Acts of Pilate</a>", written in the fourth century, in the 11th-century <a href="hymn">hymn</a> "Rhythmus de die mortis" by <a href="Pietro%20Damiani">Pietro Damiani</a>, and in a sermon by <a href="Bernard%20of%20Clairvaux">Bernard of Clairvaux</a> from the 12th century. The phrase also occurs in "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>" by <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> (c. 1606), Act III, Scene IV, l. 14:
'The prince of darkness is a gentleman."

Priests and pastors of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> and <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> churches commonly wear black, as do <a href="monks">monks</a> of the <a href="Benedictine%20Order">Benedictine Order</a>, who consider it the color of humility and penitence.

















In Europe and America, black is the color most commonly associated with <a href="mourning">mourning</a> and bereavement. It is the color traditionally worn at funerals and memorial services. In some traditional societies, for example in Greece and Italy, some widows wear black for the rest of their lives. In contrast, across much of Africa and parts of Asia like Vietnam, white is a color of mourning and is worn during funerals.

In Victorian England, the colors and fabrics of mourning were specified in an unofficial <a href="mourning%20dress">dress code</a>: "non-reflective black paramatta and crape for the first year of deepest mourning, followed by nine months of dullish black silk, heavily trimmed with crape, and then three months when crape was discarded. Paramatta was a fabric of combined silk and wool or cotton; crape was a harsh black silk fabric with a crimped appearance produced by heat. Widows were allowed to change into the colors of half-mourning, such as gray and lavender, black and white, for the final six months."

A "black day" (or week or month) usually refers to tragic date. The <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> marked "<a href="fasti">fasti</a>" days with white stones and "nefasti" days with black. The term is often used to remember massacres. Black months include the <a href="Black%20September%20in%20Jordan">Black September in Jordan</a>, when large numbers of Palestinians were killed, and <a href="Black%20July">Black July</a> in <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, the killing of members of the <a href="Tamil%20people">Tamil</a> population by the <a href="Sinhala%20people">Sinhalese</a> government.

In the financial world, the term often refers to a dramatic drop in the stock market. For example, the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash%20of%201929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a>, the <a href="stock%20market%20crash">stock market crash</a> on October 29, 1929, which marked the start of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, is nicknamed Black Tuesday, and was preceded by Black Thursday, a downturn on October 24 the previous week.
In western popular culture, black has long been associated with <a href="evil">evil</a> and <a href="darkness">darkness</a>. It is the traditional color of <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a> and <a href="black%20magic">black magic</a>.

In the <a href="Book%20of%20Revelation">Book of Revelation</a>, the last book in the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> of the Bible, the <a href="Four%20Horsemen%20of%20the%20Apocalypse">Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</a> are supposed to announce the <a href="Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a> before the <a href="Last%20Judgment">Last Judgment</a>. The horseman representing famine rides a black horse.

The <a href="vampire">vampire</a> of literature and films, such as <a href="Count%20Dracula">Count Dracula</a> of the <a href="Bram%20Stoker">Bram Stoker</a> novel, dressed in black, and could only move at night. The <a href="Wicked%20Witch%20of%20the%20West">Wicked Witch of the West</a> in the 1939 film "<a href="The%20Wizard%20of%20Oz%20%281939%20film%29">The Wizard of Oz</a>" became the archetype of witches for generations of children. Whereas witches and sorcerers inspired real fear in the 17th century, in the 21st century children and adults dressed as witches for Halloween parties and parades.

Black is frequently used as a color of power, law and authority. In many countries judges and magistrates wear black robes. That custom began in Europe in the 13th and 14th centuries. Jurists, magistrates and certain other court officials in France began to wear long black robes during the reign of <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20France">Philip IV of France</a> (1285–1314), and in England from the time of <a href="Edward%20I">Edward I</a> (1271–1307). The custom spread to the cities of Italy at about the same time, between 1300 and 1320. The robes of judges resembled those worn by the clergy, and represented the law and authority of the King, while those of the clergy represented the law of God and authority of the church.

Until the 20th century most police uniforms were black, until they were largely replaced by a less menacing blue in France, the U.S. and other countries. In the United States, police cars are frequently <a href="black%20and%20white%20%28police%20vehicle%29">Black and white</a>. The <a href="riot%20control">riot control</a> units of the <a href="Basque%20Autonomous%20Police">Basque Autonomous Police</a> in Spain are known as "<a href="beltzak">beltzak</a>" ("blacks") after their uniform.

Black today is the most common color for limousines and the official cars of government officials.

Black evening dress is still worn at many solemn occasions or ceremonies, from graduations to formal balls. Graduation gowns are copied from the gowns worn by university professors in the Middle Ages, which in turn were copied from the robes worn by judges and priests, who often taught at the early universities. The <a href="mortarboard">mortarboard</a> hat worn by graduates is adapted from a square cap called a <a href="biretta">biretta</a> worn by Medieval professors and clerics

In the 19th and 20th centuries, many machines and devices, large and small, were painted black, to stress their functionality. These included telephones, sewing machines, steamships, railroad locomotives, and automobiles. The <a href="Ford%20Model%20T">Ford Model T</a>, the first mass-produced car, was available only in black from 1914 to 1926. Of means of transportation, only airplanes were rarely ever painted black.


Black is also commonly used as a racial description in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, since ethnicity was first measured in the 2001 census. The 2011 British census asked residents to describe themselves, and categories offered included Black, African, Caribbean, or Black British. Other possible categories were African British, African Scottish, Caribbean British and Caribbean Scottish. Of the total UK population in 2001, 1.0 percent identified themselves as Black Caribbean, 0.8 percent as Black African, and 0.2 percent as Black (others).

In <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, census respondents can identify themselves as Black. In the 2006 census, 2.5 percent of the population identified themselves as black.

In <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, the term black is not used in the census. In the 2006 census, 2.3 percent of Australians identified themselves as <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Aboriginal</a> and/or <a href="Torres%20Strait">Torres Strait</a> Islanders.

In <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) asks people to identify themselves as "branco" (white), "pardo" (brown), "preto" (black), or "amarelo" (yellow). In 2008 6.8 percent of the population identified themselves as "preto".

Black is commonly associated with <a href="secrecy">secrecy</a>.

Black is the color most commonly associated with elegance in Europe and the United States, followed by silver, gold, and white.

Black first became a fashionable color for men in Europe in the 17th century, in the courts of Italy and Spain. (See history above). In the 19th century, it was the fashion for men both in business and for evening wear, in the form of a black coat whose tails came down the knees. In the evening it was the custom of the men to leave the women after dinner to go to a special smoking room to enjoy cigars or cigarettes. This meant that their tailcoats eventually smelled of tobacco. According to the legend, in 1865 <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>, then the Prince of Wales, had his tailor make a special short <a href="smoking%20jacket">smoking jacket</a>. The smoking jacket then evolved into the dinner jacket. Again according to legend, the first Americans to wear the jacket were members of the Tuxedo Club in New York State. Thereafter the jacket became known as a <a href="tuxedo">tuxedo</a> in the U.S. The term "smoking" is still used today in Russia and other countries.
The tuxedo was always black until the 1930s, when the <a href="Duke%20of%20Windsor">Duke of Windsor</a> began to wear a tuxedo that was a very dark midnight blue. He did so because a black tuxedo looked greenish in artificial light, while a dark blue tuxedo looked blacker than black itself.

For women's fashion, the defining moment was the invention of the simple black dress by <a href="Coco%20Chanel">Coco Chanel</a> in 1926. (See history.) Thereafter, a long black gown was used for formal occasions, while the simple black dress could be used for everything else. The designer <a href="Karl%20Lagerfeld">Karl Lagerfeld</a>, explaining why black was so popular, said: "Black is the color that goes with everything. If you're wearing black, you're on sure ground." Skirts have gone up and down and fashions have changed, but the black dress has not lost its position as the essential element of a woman's wardrobe. The fashion designer <a href="Christian%20Dior">Christian Dior</a> said, "elegance is a combination of distinction, naturalness, care and simplicity," and black exemplified elegance.

The expression "X is the new black" is a reference to the latest trend or fad that is considered a wardrobe basic for the duration of the trend, on the basis that black is always fashionable. The phrase has taken on a life of its own and has become a <a href="clich%C3%A9">cliché</a>.

Many performers of both popular and <a href="European%20classical%20music">European classical music</a>, including French singers <a href="Edith%20Piaf">Edith Piaf</a> and <a href="Juliette%20Greco">Juliette Greco</a>, and violinist <a href="Joshua%20Bell">Joshua Bell</a> have traditionally worn black on stage during performances. A black costume was usually chosen as part of their image or stage persona, or because it did not distract from the music, or sometimes for a political reason. Country-western singer <a href="Johnny%20Cash">Johnny Cash</a> always wore black on stage. In 1971, Cash wrote the song "<a href="Man%20in%20Black%20%28song%29">Man in Black</a>" to explain why he dressed in that color: "We're doing mighty fine I do suppose / In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes / But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back / Up front there ought to be a man in black."

Bletchley Park

Bletchley Park was the central site for British <a href="World%20War%20II%20cryptography">codebreakers during World War II</a>. It housed the <a href="Government%20Code%20and%20Cypher%20School">Government Code and Cypher School</a> (GC&CS), which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the <a href="Axis%20Powers">Axis Powers</a>most importantly the German <a href="Enigma%20%28machine%29">Enigma</a> and <a href="Lorenz%20cipher">Lorenz</a> ciphers. According to the official historian of British Intelligence, the "<a href="Ultra">Ultra</a>" intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and that without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain.

Located in <a href="Milton%20Keynes">Milton Keynes</a>, <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>, Bletchley Park is open to the public, and receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.

Bletchley Park is opposite <a href="Bletchley%20railway%20station">Bletchley railway station</a>. It is close to junctions 13 and 14 of the <a href="M1%20motorway">M1</a>. Located northwest of <a href="London">London</a>, the site appears in the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a> as part of the <a href="Water%20Eaton%2C%20Milton%20Keynes">Manor of Eaton</a>. <a href="Browne%20Willis">Browne Willis</a> built a mansion there in 1711, but after Thomas Harrison purchased the property in 1793 this was pulled down. It was first known as Bletchley Park after its purchase by <a href="Samuel%20Lipscomb%20Seckham">Samuel Lipscomb Seckham</a> in 1877. The estate of was bought in 1883 by Sir <a href="Herbert%20Samuel%20Leon">Herbert Samuel Leon</a>, who expanded the then-existing farmhouse into what architect <a href="Landis%20Gores">Landis Gores</a> called a "maudlin and monstrous pile" combining <a href="Victorian%20Gothic">Victorian Gothic</a>, <a href="Tudor%20Revival%20architecture">Tudor</a>, and <a href="Dutch%20Baroque%20architecture">Dutch Baroque</a> styles.

In 1938, the mansion and much of the site was bought by a builder planning a housing estate, but in May 1938 Admiral Sir <a href="Hugh%20Sinclair">Hugh Sinclair</a>, head of the <a href="Secret%20Intelligence%20Service">Secret Intelligence Service</a> (SIS or <a href="MI6">MI6</a>), bought the mansion and of land for £6,000, using his own money after the Government said they did not have the budget to do so, for use by GC&CS and SIS in the event of war.

A key advantage seen by Sinclair and his colleagues (inspecting the site under the cover of "Captain Ridley's shooting party") was Bletchley's geographical centrality. It was almost immediately adjacent to <a href="Bletchley%20railway%20station">Bletchley railway station</a>, where the "<a href="Varsity%20Line">Varsity Line</a>" between <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> and <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>whose universities were expected to supply many of the code-breakersmet the main <a href="West%20Coast%20Main%20Line">West Coast railway line</a> connecting London, <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> and <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. <a href="Watling%20Street">Watling Street</a>, the main road linking London to the north-west (now the <a href="A5%20road%20%28Great%20Britain%29">A5</a>) was close by, and high-volume communication links were available at the telegraph and telephone repeater station in nearby <a href="Fenny%20Stratford">Fenny Stratford</a>.

Bletchley Park was known as "B.P." to those who worked there.
"Station X" (X = Roman numeral ten), "London Signals Intelligence Centre", and "<a href="Government%20Communications%20Headquarters">Government Communications Headquarters</a>" were all cover names used during the war.
The formal posting of the many "Wrens"members of the <a href="Women%27s%20Royal%20Naval%20Service">Women's Royal Naval Service</a>working there, was to <a href="RAF%20Eastcote">HMS Pembroke V</a>. Royal Air Force names of Bletchley Park and its outstations included <a href="RAF%20Eastcote">RAF Eastcote</a>, RAF Lime Grove and RAF Church Green. The postal address that staff had to use was "Room 47, Foreign Office".

Commander <a href="Alastair%20Denniston">Alastair Denniston</a> was operational head of GC&CS from 1919 to 1942, beginning with its formation from the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>'s <a href="Room%2040">Room 40</a> (NID25) and the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a>'s <a href="MI1">MI1</a>b.

These people had a variety of backgroundslinguists and chess champions were common, and in Knox's case <a href="papyrology">papyrology</a>. The British War Office recruited top solvers of <a href="cryptic%20crossword">cryptic crossword</a> puzzles, as these individuals had strong <a href="lateral%20thinking">lateral thinking</a> skills.

On <a href="British%20and%20French%20declaration%20of%20war%20on%20Germany">the day Britain declared war on Germany</a>, Denniston wrote to the <a href="Foreign%20Office">Foreign Office</a> about recruiting "men of the professor type". Personal networking drove early recruitments, particularly of men from the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Trustworthy women were similarly recruited for administrative and clerical jobs. In one 1941 recruiting stratagem, "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" was asked to organise a crossword competition, after which promising contestants were discreetly approached about "a particular type of work as a contribution to the war effort".

Denniston recognised, however, that the enemy's use of electromechanical cipher machines meant that formally trained mathematicians would also be needed; Oxford's <a href="Peter%20Twinn">Peter Twinn</a> joined GC&CS in February 1939; Cambridge's <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a> and <a href="Gordon%20Welchman">Gordon Welchman</a> began training in 1938 and reported to Bletchley the day after war was declared, along with <a href="John%20R.F.%20Jeffreys">John Jeffreys</a>. Later-recruited cryptanalysts included the mathematicians <a href="Derek%20Taunt">Derek Taunt</a>, <a href="I.J.%20Good">Jack Good</a>, <a href="W.%20T.%20Tutte">Bill Tutte</a>, and <a href="Max%20Newman">Max Newman</a>; historian <a href="Harry%20Hinsley">Harry Hinsley</a>, and chess champions <a href="Conel%20Hugh%20O%27Donel%20Alexander">Hugh Alexander</a> and <a href="Stuart%20Milner-Barry">Stuart Milner-Barry</a>. <a href="Joan%20Clarke">Joan Clarke</a> (eventually deputy head of <a href="Hut%208">Hut 8</a>) was one of the few women employed at Bletchley as a full-fledged cryptanalyst. 

This eclectic staff of "<a href="Boffin">Boffin</a>s and <a href="Deb%20%28society%29">Debs</a>" (scientists and debutantes, young women of high society) caused GC&CS to be whimsically dubbed the "Golf, Cheese and Chess Society". During a September 1941 morale-boosting visit, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> reportedly remarked to Denniston: "I told you to leave no stone unturned to get staff, but I had no idea you had taken me so literally." Six weeks later, having failed to get sufficient typing and unskilled staff to achieve the productivity that was possible, Turing, Welchman, Alexander and Milner-Barry wrote directly to Churchill. His response was "Action this day make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done."

After initial training at the Inter-Service Special Intelligence School set up by <a href="John%20Tiltman">John Tiltman</a> (initially at an RAF depot in Buckingham and later in <a href="Bedford">Bedford</a>where it was known locally as "the Spy School") staff worked a six-day week, rotating through three shifts: 4p.m. to midnight, midnight to 8a.m. (the most disliked shift), and 8a.m. to 4p.m., each with a half-hour meal break. At the end of the third week, a worker went off at 8a.m. and came back at 4p.m., thus putting in sixteen hours on that last day. The irregular hours affected workers' health and social life, as well as the routines of the nearby homes at which most staff lodged. The work was tedious and demanded intense concentration; staff got one week's leave four times a year, but some "girls" collapsed and required extended rest. A small number of men (e.g. <a href="General%20Post%20Office">Post Office</a> experts in Morse code or German) worked part-time.

In January 1945, at the peak of codebreaking efforts, some 10,000 personnel were working at Bletchley and its outstations. About three-quarters of these were women. Many of the women came from middle-class backgrounds and held degrees in the areas of mathematics, physics and engineering; they were given entry into <a href="Science%2C%20technology%2C%20engineering%2C%20and%20mathematics">STEM</a> programs due to the lack of men, who had been sent to war. They performed complex calculations and coding and hence were integral to the computing processes. For example, <a href="Eleanor%20Ireland">Eleanor Ireland</a> worked on the <a href="Colossus%20computer">Colossus computer</a>s.

The female staff in Dilwyn Knox's section were sometimes termed "Dilly's Fillies". "Dilly's girls" included Jean Perrin, Clare Harding, Rachel Ronald, and Elisabeth Granger. <a href="Jane%20Hughes">Jane Hughes</a> processed information leading to the <a href="Last%20battle%20of%20the%20battleship%20Bismarck">last battle of the "Bismarck"</a>. <a href="Mavis%20Lever">Mavis Lever</a> (who married mathematician and fellow code-breaker <a href="Keith%20Batey">Keith Batey</a>) made the first break into the Italian naval traffic. She and <a href="Margaret%20Rock">Margaret Rock</a> solved a German code, the <a href="Abwehr">Abwehr break</a>. Their work achieved official recognition only in 2009. 

Many of the women had backgrounds in languages, particularly French and German. <a href="Rozanne%20Colchester">Rozanne Colchester</a> was a translator who worked at Bletchley from April 1942 until January 1945, mainly for the Italian air forces Section. Like most of the 'Bletchleyettes', she came from the higher middle class, her father, Air Vice-Marshal Sir Charles Medhurst, being an air attaché in Rome. Before joining Bletchley, Colchester was moving in high circles: “she had met Hitler and been flirted with by Mussolini at an embassy party”, writes Sarah Rainey. She joined the Park because she found it thrilling to fight for her country. 

<a href="Cicely%20Mayhew">Cicely Mayhew</a> was recruited straight from university, having graduated from <a href="Lady%20Margaret%20Hall%2C%20Oxford">Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford</a> in 1944 with a First in French and German, after only two years. She worked in Hut 8, translating decoded German Navy signals.

Ruth Briggs, a German scholar, worked within the Naval Section and was known as one of the best cryptographers; she married <a href="Oliver%20Churchill">Oliver Churchill</a> of the SOE.

Properly used, the German Enigma and <a href="Lorenz%20cipher">Lorenz cipher</a>s should have been virtually unbreakable, but flaws in German cryptographic procedures, and poor discipline among the personnel carrying them out, created vulnerabilities that made Bletchley's attacks just barely feasible. These vulnerabilities, however, could have been remedied by relatively simple improvements in enemy procedures, and such changes would certainly have been implemented had Germany any hint of Bletchley's success. Thus the intelligence Bletchley produced was considered wartime Britain's "<a href="Ultra">Ultra</a> secret"higher even than the normally highest classification and security was paramount.

All staff signed the <a href="Official%20Secrets%20Act%201939">Official Secrets Act (1939)</a> and a 1942 security warning emphasised the importance of discretion even within Bletchley itself: "Do not talk at meals. Do not talk in the transport. Do not talk travelling. Do not talk in the billet. Do not talk by your own fireside. Be careful even in your Hut..."

Nevertheless, there were security leaks. <a href="Jock%20Colville">Jock Colville</a>, the Assistant Private Secretary to <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, recorded in his diary on 31 July 1941, that the newspaper proprietor <a href="Lord%20Camrose">Lord Camrose</a> had discovered Ultra and that security leaks "increase in number and seriousness". Without doubt, the most serious of these was that Bletchley Park had been infiltrated by <a href="John%20Cairncross">John Cairncross</a>, the notorious Soviet mole and member of the <a href="Cambridge%20Spy%20Ring">Cambridge Spy Ring</a>, who leaked Ultra material to Moscow.

The first personnel of the <a href="Government%20Code%20and%20Cypher%20School">Government Code and Cypher School</a> (GC&CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939. The Naval, Military, and Air Sections were on the ground floor of the mansion, together with a telephone exchange, teleprinter room, kitchen, and dining room; the top floor was allocated to <a href="MI6">MI6</a>. Construction of the wooden huts began in late 1939, and Elmers School, a neighbouring boarding school, was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections.

After the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> joined World war ||, a number of American <a href="cryptographer">cryptographer</a>s were posted to <a href="Hut%203">Hut 3</a>, and from May 1943 onwards there was close co-operation between British and American intelligence.
(See <a href="1943%20BRUSA%20Agreement">1943 BRUSA Agreement</a>.) In contrast, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> was never officially told of Bletchley Park and its activities a reflection of Churchill's distrust of the Soviets even during the US-UK-USSR alliance imposed by the Nazi threat.

The only direct enemy damage to the site was done 2021 November 1940 by three bombs probably intended for <a href="Bletchley%20railway%20station">Bletchley railway station</a>; Hut4, shifted two feet off its foundation, was winched back into place as
work inside continued. 

Non-naval Enigma messages were deciphered in <a href="Hut%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B6">Hut 6</a>, followed by translation, indexing and cross-referencing, in <a href="Hut%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B3">Hut 3</a>. Only then was it sent out to the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), the intelligence chiefs in the relevant ministries, and later on to high-level commanders in the field.

Naval Enigma deciphering was in <a href="Hut%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B8">Hut 8</a>, with translation in <a href="Hut%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B4">Hut 4</a>.
Verbatim translations were sent only to the <a href="Naval%20Intelligence%20Division">Naval Intelligence Division</a> (NID) of the Admiralty's Operational Intelligence Centre (OIC), supplemented by information from indexes as to the meaning of technical terms and cross-references from a knowledge store of German naval technology.

Hut 4 also decoded a manual system known as the dockyard cipher, which sometimes carried messages that were also sent on an Enigma network. Feeding these back to Hut8 provided excellent "cribs" for <a href="Known-plaintext%20attack">Known-plaintext attack</a>s on the daily naval Enigma key.

Initially, a <a href="radio">wireless</a> room was established at Bletchley Park.
It was set up in the mansion's water tower under the code name "Station X", a term now sometimes applied to the codebreaking efforts at Bletchley as a whole. The "X" is the <a href="Roman%20numeral">Roman numeral</a> "ten", this being the Secret Intelligence Service's tenth such station. Due to the long radio aerials stretching from the wireless room, the radio station was moved from Bletchley Park to nearby <a href="Whaddon%2C%20Buckinghamshire%23Whaddon%20Hall">Whaddon Hall</a> to avoid drawing attention to the site.

Subsequently, other listening stationsthe <a href="Y-stations">Y-stations</a>, such as the ones at <a href="Chicksands">Chicksands</a> in Bedfordshire, <a href="Beaumanor%20Hall">Beaumanor Hall</a>, Leicestershire (where the headquarters of the War Office "Y" Group was located) and <a href="Beeston%20Hill%20Y%20Station">Beeston Hill Y Station</a> in Norfolkgathered raw signals for processing at Bletchley. Coded messages were taken down by hand and sent to Bletchley on paper by motorcycle <a href="despatch%20rider">despatch rider</a>s or (later) by teleprinter.

The wartime needs required the building of additional accommodation.

Often a hut's number became so strongly associated with the work performed inside that even when the work was moved to another building it was still referred to by the original "Hut" designation.


In addition to the wooden huts, there were a number of brick-built "blocks".

Most German messages decrypted at Bletchley were produced by one or another version of the <a href="Enigma%20machine">Enigma</a> cipher machine, but an important minority were produced by the even more complicated twelve-rotor <a href="Lorenz%20cipher">Lorenz SZ42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine</a>.

Five weeks before the outbreak of war, Warsaw's <a href="Biuro%20Szyfr%C3%B3w">Cipher Bureau</a> revealed <a href="Cryptanalysis%20of%20the%20Enigma">its achievements</a> in breaking Enigma to astonished French and British personnel. The British used the Poles' information and techniques, and the <a href="Polish%20Enigma%20doubles">Enigma clone</a> sent to them in August 1939, which greatly increased their (previously very limited) success in decrypting Enigma messages.

The <a href="bombe">bombe</a> was an electromechanical device whose function was to discover some of the daily settings of the Enigma machines on the various German military <a href="Telecommunications%20network">networks</a>. Its pioneering design was developed by <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a> (with an important contribution from Gordon Welchman) and the machine was engineered by <a href="Harold%20Keen">Harold 'Doc' Keen</a> of the <a href="British%20Tabulating%20Machine%20Company">British Tabulating Machine Company</a>. Each machine was about high and wide, deep and weighed about a ton.

At its peak, GC&CS was reading approximately 4,000 messages per day. As a hedge against enemy attack most bombes were dispersed to installations at <a href="Adstock">Adstock</a> and <a href="Wavendon">Wavendon</a> (both later supplanted by installations at <a href="Stanmore">Stanmore</a> and <a href="Eastcote">Eastcote</a>), and <a href="Gayhurst">Gayhurst</a>.

<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> messages were the first to be read in quantity. The German navy had much tighter procedures, and the capture of code books was needed before they could be broken. When, in February 1942, the German navy introduced the four-rotor Enigma for communications with its Atlantic U-boats, this traffic became unreadable for a period of ten months. Britain produced modified bombes, but it was the success of the <a href="US%20Navy%20Bombe">US Navy bombe</a> that was the main source of reading messages from this version of Enigma for the rest of the war. Messages were sent to and fro across the Atlantic by enciphered teleprinter links.

The <a href="Cryptanalysis%20of%20the%20Lorenz%20cipher">Lorenz messages</a> were codenamed "Tunny" at Bletchley Park. They were only sent in quantity from mid-1942. The Tunny networks were used for high-level messages between German High Command and field commanders. With the help of German operator errors, the cryptanalysts in the <a href="Testery">Testery</a> (named after <a href="Ralph%20Tester">Ralph Tester</a>, its head) worked out the logical structure of the machine despite not knowing its physical form. They devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, which culminated in <a href="Colossus%20computer">Colossus</a>, the world's first programmable digital electronic computer. This was designed and built by <a href="Tommy%20Flowers">Tommy Flowers</a> and his team at the <a href="Post%20Office%20Research%20Station">Post Office Research Station</a> at <a href="Dollis%20Hill">Dollis Hill</a>. The prototype first worked in December 1943, was delivered to Bletchley Park in January and first worked operationally on 5 February 1944. Enhancements were developed for the Mark 2 Colossus, the first of which was working at Bletchley Park on the morning of 1 June in time for <a href="Normandy%20landings">D-day</a>. Flowers then produced one Colossus a month for the rest of the war, making a total of ten with an eleventh part-built. The machines were operated mainly by Wrens in a section named the <a href="Newmanry">Newmanry</a> after its head <a href="Max%20Newman">Max Newman</a>.

Bletchley's work was essential to defeating the <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a>, and to the British naval victories in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Matapan">Battle of Cape Matapan</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20North%20Cape">Battle of North Cape</a>. In 1941, Ultra exerted a powerful effect on the <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North African desert campaign</a> against German forces under General <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a>. General Sir <a href="Claude%20Auchinleck">Claude Auchinleck</a> wrote that were it not for Ultra, "Rommel would have certainly got through to Cairo". While not changing the events, "<a href="Ultra%20%28cryptography%29">Ultra</a>" decrypts featured prominently in the story of <a href="Operation%20Salaam">Operation SALAM</a>, <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Alm%C3%A1sy">László Almásy</a>'s mission across <a href="Western%20Desert%20%28Egypt%29">the desert</a> behind Allied lines in 1942. Prior to the <a href="Normandy%20landings">Normandy landings</a> on D-Day in June 1944, the Allies knew the locations of all but two of Germany's fifty-eight Western-front divisions.

Italian signals had been of interest since Italy's attack on Abyssinia in 1935.
During the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> the <a href="Royal%20Italian%20Navy">Italian Navy</a> used the K model of the commercial Enigma without a plugboard; this was solved by Knox in 1937.
When Italy entered the war in 1940 an improved version of the machine was used, though little traffic was sent by it and there were "wholesale changes" in Italian codes and cyphers.

Knox was given a new section for work on Enigma variations, which he staffed with women ("Dilly's girls"), who included <a href="Margaret%20Rock">Margaret Rock</a>, Jean Perrin, Clare Harding, Rachel Ronald, Elisabeth Granger; and <a href="Mavis%20Batey">Mavis Lever</a>.
Mavis Lever solved the signals revealing the Italian Navy's operational plans before the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Matapan">Battle of Cape Matapan</a> in 1941, leading to a British victory.

Although most Bletchley staff did not know the results of their work, Admiral <a href="Andrew%20Cunningham%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cunningham%20of%20Hyndhope">Cunningham</a> visited Bletchley in person a few weeks later to congratulate them.

On entering World War II in June 1940, the <a href="Italy">Italians</a> were using book codes for most of their military messages. The exception was the <a href="Italian%20Navy">Italian Navy</a>, which after the Battle of Cape Matapan started using the <a href="C-38%20%28cipher%20machine%29">C-38</a> version of the <a href="Boris%20Hagelin">Boris Hagelin</a> <a href="Rotor%20machine">rotor-based</a> <a href="cipher%20machine">cipher machine</a>, particularly to route their navy and merchant marine convoys to the conflict in North Africa.
As a consequence, <a href="James%20Ramsay%20Montagu%20Butler">JRM Butler</a> recruited his former student <a href="Bernard%20Willson">Bernard Willson</a> to join a team with two others in Hut4. In June 1941, Willson became the first of the team to decode the Hagelin system, thus enabling military commanders to direct the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> and <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> to sink enemy ships carrying supplies from Europe to Rommel's <a href="Afrika%20Korps">Afrika Korps</a>. This led to increased shipping losses and, from reading the intercepted traffic, the team learnt that between May and September 1941 the stock of fuel for the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> in North Africa reduced by 90 percent.
After an intensive language course, in March 1944 Willson switched to Japanese language-based codes.

A Middle East Intelligence Centre (MEIC) was set up in Cairo in 1939. When Italy entered the war in June 1940, delays in forwarding intercepts to Bletchley via congested radio links resulted in cryptanalysts being sent to Cairo. A Combined Bureau Middle East (CBME) was set up in November, though the Middle East authorities made "increasingly bitter complaints" that <a href="GC%26amp%3BCS">GC&CS</a> was giving too little priority to work on Italian cyphers. However, the principle of concentrating high-grade cryptanalysis at Bletchley was maintained. <a href="John%20Chadwick">John Chadwick</a> started cryptanalysis work in 1942 on Italian signals at the naval base 'HMS Nile' in Alexandria. Later, he was with GC&CS; in the Heliopolis Museum, Cairo and then in the Villa Laurens, Alexandria.

Soviet signals had been studied since the 1920s. In 193940, <a href="John%20Tiltman">John Tiltman</a> (who had worked on Russian Army traffic from 1930) set up two Russian sections at Wavendon (a country house near Bletchley) and at <a href="Sarafand%20al-Amar">Sarafand</a> in Palestine. Two Russian high-grade army and navy systems were broken early in 1940. Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland, where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment. In June 1941, when the Soviet Union became an ally, Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against it. In December 1941, the Russian section was closed down, but in late summer 1943 or late 1944, a small GC&CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane, then in Sloane Square.

An outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the <a href="Far%20East%20Combined%20Bureau">Far East Combined Bureau</a> (FECB). The FECB naval staff moved in 1940 to Singapore, then <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylon</a>, then <a href="Kilindini%20Harbour">Kilindini</a>, <a href="Mombasa">Mombasa</a>, Kenya. They succeeded in deciphering Japanese codes with a mixture of skill and good fortune. The Army and Air Force staff went from Singapore to the <a href="Wireless%20Experimental%20Centre">Wireless Experimental Centre</a> at <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a>, India.

In early 1942, a six-month crash course in Japanese, for 20 undergraduates from Oxford and Cambridge, was started by the Inter-Services Special Intelligence School in Bedford, in a building across from the main Post Office. This course was repeated every six months until war's end. Most of those completing these courses worked on decoding Japanese naval messages in <a href="Hut%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B7">Hut 7</a>, under <a href="John%20Tiltman">John Tiltman</a>.

By mid-1945, well over 100 personnel were involved with this operation, which co-operated closely with the FECB and the US Signal intelligence Service at <a href="Arlington%20Hall">Arlington Hall</a>, Virginia. In 1999, Michael Smith wrote that: "Only now are the British codebreakers (like <a href="John%20Tiltman">John Tiltman</a>, <a href="Hugh%20Foss">Hugh Foss</a>, and <a href="Eric%20Nave">Eric Nave</a>) beginning to receive the recognition they deserve for breaking Japanese codes and cyphers".

After the War, the secrecy imposed on Bletchley staff remained in force, so that most relatives never knew more than that a child, spouse, or parent had done some kind of secret war work. Churchill referred to the Bletchley staff as "the geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled". That said, occasional mentions of the work performed at Bletchley Park slipped the censor's net and appeared in print.

With the publication of <a href="F.%20W.%20Winterbotham">F.W. Winterbotham's</a> "The Ultra Secret" (1974) public discussion of Bletchley's work finally became possible (though even today some former staff still consider themselves bound to silence) and in July 2009 the British government announced that Bletchley personnel would be recognised with a commemorative badge.

After the war, the site passed through a succession of hands and saw a number of uses, including as a teacher-training college and local <a href="General%20Post%20Office">GPO</a> headquarters. By 1991, the site was nearly empty and the buildings were at risk of demolition for redevelopment.

In February 1992, the <a href="Milton%20Keynes%20Borough%20Council">Milton Keynes Borough Council</a> declared most of the Park a conservation area, and the Bletchley Park Trust was formed to maintain the site as a museum. The site opened to visitors in 1993, and was formally inaugurated by HRH The Duke of Kent as Chief Patron in July 1994. In 1999 the land owners, the <a href="Office%20of%20Government%20Commerce">Property Advisors to the Civil Estate</a> and <a href="BT%20Group">BT</a>, granted a lease the Trust giving the Trust control over most of the site.

June 2014 saw the completion of an £8 million restoration project, which was marked by a visit from <a href="Catherine%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Cambridge">Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge</a>. The Duchess' paternal grandmother, Valerie, and Valerie's twin sister, Mary (née Glassborow), both worked at Bletchley Park during the war. The twin sisters worked as Foreign Office Civilians in <a href="Hut%206">Hut 6</a>, where they managed the interception of enemy and neutral diplomatic signals for decryption. Valerie married Catherine's grandfather, Captain <a href="Family%20of%20Catherine%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Cambridge">Peter Middleton</a>.


In October 2005, American billionaire <a href="Sidney%20Frank">Sidney Frank</a> donated £500,000 to Bletchley Park Trust to fund a new Science Centre dedicated to <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a>. In July 2008, a letter to <a href="The%20Times">The Times</a> from more than a hundred academics condemned the neglect of the site. In September 2008, <a href="Pretty%20Good%20Privacy">PGP</a>, <a href="IBM">IBM</a>, and other technology firms announced a fund-raising campaign to repair the facility. On 6 November 2008 it was announced that <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> would donate £300,000 to help maintain the buildings at Bletchley Park, and that they were in discussions regarding the donation of a further £600,000.

In October 2011, the Bletchley Park Trust received a £4.6m <a href="Heritage%20Lottery%20Fund">Heritage Lottery Fund</a> grant to be used "to complete the restoration of the site, and to tell its story to the highest modern standards" on the condition that £1.7m of 'match funding' is raised by the Bletchley Park Trust. Just weeks later, Google contributed £550k and by June 2012 the trust had successfully raised £2.4m to unlock the grants to restore Huts 3 and 6, as well as develop its exhibition centre in Block C.

Additional income is raised by renting Block H to the National Museum of Computing, and some office space in various parts of the park to private firms.

The National Museum of Computing is housed in Block H, which is rented from the Bletchley Park Trust. Its Colossus and Tunny galleries tell an important part of allied breaking of German codes during World War II. There is a working reconstruction of a <a href="Colossus%20computer">Colossus computer</a> that was used on the high-level <a href="Lorenz%20cipher">Lorenz cipher</a>, codenamed "Tunny" by the British. 

The museum, which opened in 2007, is an independent voluntary organisation that is governed by its own board of trustees. Its aim is "To collect and restore computer systems particularly those developed in Britain and to enable people to explore that collection for inspiration, learning and enjoyment." Through its many exhibits, the museum displays the story of computing through the mainframes of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of personal computing in the 1980s. It has a policy of having as many of the exhibits as possible in full working order.

The Colossus and Tunny galleries are open daily. The rest of the museum is open to the public every Thursday, Saturday and Sunday afternoons and most bank holidays, and by appointment for groups only, at other times. There are guided tours on Tuesday afternoons. There is a modest admission charge to the museum to help cover overheads.

The museum is working with four other organisations, in a group called Qufaro, to create the new college for students between 16 and 19 years of age.

Bede

Bede ( ; ; 672/3 – 26 May 735), also known as Saint Bede, Venerable Bede, and Bede the Venerable (), was an English <a href="monk">monk</a> at the monastery of St. Peter and its companion monastery of St. Paul in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Northumbria">Kingdom of Northumbria</a> of the <a href="Angles">Angles</a> (contemporarily <a href="Monkwearmouth%E2%80%93Jarrow%20Abbey">Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey</a> in <a href="Tyne%20and%20Wear">Tyne and Wear</a>, <a href="England">England</a>). He is well known as an author and scholar, and his most famous work, "<a href="Ecclesiastical%20History%20of%20the%20English%20People">Ecclesiastical History of the English People</a>" gained him the title "The Father of <a href="History%20of%20England">English History</a>".

In 1899, <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a> declared him a <a href="Doctor%20of%20the%20Church">Doctor of the Church</a>; he is the only native of <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> to achieve this designation; <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm of Canterbury</a>, also a Doctor of the Church, was originally from <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. Bede was moreover a skilled linguist and translator, and his work made the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> writings of the early <a href="Church%20Fathers">Church Fathers</a> much more accessible to his fellow <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a>, which contributed significantly to English <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>. Bede's monastery had access to an impressive library which included works by <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>, <a href="Orosius">Orosius</a>, and many others.

Almost everything that is known of Bede's life is contained in the last chapter of his "Ecclesiastical History of the English People", a history of the church in England. It was completed in about 731, and Bede implies that he was then in his fifty-ninth year, which would give a birth date in 672 or 673. A minor source of information is the letter by his disciple Cuthbert (not to be confused with the saint, <a href="Cuthbert">Cuthbert</a>, who is mentioned in Bede's work) which relates Bede's death. Bede, in the "Historia", gives his birthplace as "on the lands of this monastery". He is referring to the twinned monasteries of <a href="Monkwearmouth-Jarrow%20Abbey">Monkwearmouth and Jarrow</a>, in modern-day <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a>, claimed as his birthplace; there is also a tradition that he was born at <a href="Monkton%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Monkton</a>, two miles from the monastery at Jarrow. Bede says nothing of his origins, but his connections with men of noble ancestry suggest that his own family was well-to-do. Bede's first abbot was <a href="Benedict%20Biscop">Benedict Biscop</a>, and the names "Biscop" and "Beda" both appear in a king list of the kings of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Lindsey">Lindsey</a> from around 800, further suggesting that Bede came from a noble family.

<a href="Beda%20%28name%29">Bede's name</a> reflects West Saxon "Bīeda" (Northumbrian "Bǣda", Anglian "Bēda"). It is an Anglo-Saxon short name formed on the root of "bēodan" "to bid, command". 
The name also occurs in the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>", s.a. 501, as "Bieda", one of the sons of the Saxon founder of <a href="History%20of%20Portsmouth%23Pre-Norman">Portsmouth</a>. The "Liber Vitae" of <a href="Durham%20Cathedral">Durham Cathedral</a> names two priests with this name, one of whom is presumably Bede himself. Some manuscripts of the "Life of Cuthbert", one of Bede's works, mention that Cuthbert's own priest was named Bede; it is possible that this priest is the other name listed in the "Liber Vitae".

At the age of seven, Bede was sent to the monastery of Monkwearmouth by his family to be educated by Benedict Biscop and later by <a href="Ceolfrith">Ceolfrith</a>. Bede does not say whether it was already intended at that point that he would be a monk. It was fairly common in Ireland at this time for young boys, particularly those of noble birth, to be fostered out; the practice was also likely to have been common among the Germanic peoples in England. Monkwearmouth's sister monastery at Jarrow was founded by Ceolfrith in 682, and Bede probably transferred to Jarrow with Ceolfrith that year. The dedication stone for the church has survived to the present day; it is dated 23 April 685, and as Bede would have been required to assist with menial tasks in his day-to-day life it is possible that he helped in building the original church. In 686, plague broke out at Jarrow. The "Life of Ceolfrith", written in about 710, records that only two surviving monks were capable of singing the full offices; one was Ceolfrith and the other a young boy, who according to the anonymous writer had been taught by Ceolfrith. The two managed to do the entire service of the liturgy until others could be trained. The young boy was almost certainly Bede, who would have been about 14.

When Bede was about 17 years old, <a href="Adomn%C3%A1n">Adomnán</a>, the abbot of <a href="Iona%20Abbey">Iona Abbey</a>, visited Monkwearmouth and Jarrow. Bede would probably have met the abbot during this visit, and it may be that Adomnan sparked Bede's interest in the <a href="Easter%20controversy">Easter dating controversy</a>. In about 692, in Bede's nineteenth year, Bede was ordained a <a href="deacon">deacon</a> by his diocesan bishop, <a href="John%20of%20Beverley">John</a>, who was <a href="bishop%20of%20Hexham">bishop of Hexham</a>. The canonical age for the ordination of a deacon was 25; Bede's early ordination may mean that his abilities were considered exceptional, but it is also possible that the minimum age requirement was often disregarded. There might have been minor orders ranking below a deacon; but there is no record of whether Bede held any of these offices. In Bede's thirtieth year (about 702), he became a priest, with the ordination again performed by Bishop John.

In about 701 Bede wrote his first works, the "De Arte Metrica" and "De Schematibus et Tropis"; both were intended for use in the classroom. He continued to write for the rest of his life, eventually completing over 60 books, most of which have survived. Not all his output can be easily dated, and Bede may have worked on some texts over a period of many years. His last-surviving work is a letter to <a href="Ecgbert%20of%20York">Ecgbert of York</a>, a former student, written in 734. A 6th-century Greek and Latin manuscript of "<a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>" that is believed to have been used by Bede survives and is now in the <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a> at <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>; it is known as the <a href="Codex%20Laudianus">Codex Laudianus</a>. Bede may also have worked on one of the Latin bibles that were copied at Jarrow, one of which is now held by the <a href="Laurentian%20Library">Laurentian Library</a> in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>. Bede was a teacher as well as a writer; he enjoyed music, and was said to be accomplished as a singer and as a reciter of poetry in the vernacular. It is possible that he suffered a speech impediment, but this depends on a phrase in the introduction to his verse life of Saint Cuthbert. Translations of this phrase differ, and it is uncertain whether Bede intended to say that he was cured of a speech problem, or merely that he was inspired by the saint's works.
In 708, some monks at <a href="Hexham%20Abbey">Hexham</a> accused Bede of having committed heresy in his work "De Temporibus". The standard theological view of world history at the time was known as the <a href="Six%20Ages%20of%20the%20World">Six Ages of the World</a>; in his book, Bede calculated the age of the world for himself, rather than accepting the authority of <a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore of Seville</a>, and came to the conclusion that Christ had been born 3,952 years after the creation of the world, rather than the figure of over 5,000 years that was commonly accepted by theologians. The accusation occurred in front of the bishop of Hexham, <a href="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a>, who was present at a feast when some drunken monks made the accusation. Wilfrid did not respond to the accusation, but a monk present relayed the episode to Bede, who replied within a few days to the monk, writing a letter setting forth his defence and asking that the letter also be read to Wilfrid. Bede had another brush with Wilfrid, for the historian himself says that he met Wilfrid, sometime between 706 and 709, and discussed <a href="%C3%86thelthryth">Æthelthryth</a>, the abbess of Ely. Wilfrid had been present at the exhumation of her body in 695, and Bede questioned the bishop about the exact circumstances of the body and asked for more details of her life, as Wilfrid had been her advisor.

In 733, Bede travelled to York to visit Ecgbert, who was then <a href="archbishop%20of%20York">bishop of York</a>. The See of York was elevated to an archbishopric in 735, and it is likely that Bede and Ecgbert discussed the proposal for the elevation during his visit. Bede hoped to visit Ecgbert again in 734, but was too ill to make the journey. Bede also travelled to the monastery of <a href="Lindisfarne">Lindisfarne</a>, and at some point visited the otherwise-unknown monastery of a monk named , a visit that is mentioned in a letter to that monk. Because of his widespread correspondence with others throughout the British Isles, and due to the fact that many of the letters imply that Bede had met his correspondents, it is likely that Bede travelled to some other places, although nothing further about timing or locations can be guessed. It seems certain that he did not visit Rome, however, as he would have mentioned it in the autobiographical chapter of his "Historia Ecclesiastica". <a href="Nothhelm">Nothhelm</a>, a correspondent of Bede's who assisted him by finding documents for him in Rome, is known to have visited Bede, though the date cannot be determined beyond the fact that it was after Nothhelm's visit to Rome.

Except for a few visits to other monasteries, his life was spent in a round of prayer, observance of the monastic discipline and study of the Sacred Scriptures. He was considered the most learned man of his time, and wrote excellent biblical and historical books.
Bede died on the <a href="Feast%20of%20the%20Ascension">Feast of the Ascension</a>, Thursday, 26 May 735, on the floor of his cell, singing "Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit" and was buried at Jarrow. Cuthbert, a disciple of Bede's, wrote a letter to a Cuthwin (of whom nothing else is known), describing Bede's last days and his death. According to Cuthbert, Bede fell ill, "with frequent attacks of breathlessness but almost without pain", before Easter. On the Tuesday, two days before Bede died, his breathing became worse and his feet swelled. He continued to dictate to a scribe, however, and despite spending the night awake in prayer he dictated again the following day. At three o'clock, according to Cuthbert, he asked for a box of his to be brought, and distributed among the priests of the monastery "a few treasures" of his: "some pepper, and napkins, and some incense". That night he dictated a final sentence to the scribe, a boy named Wilberht, and died soon afterwards. The account of Cuthbert does not make entirely clear whether Bede died before midnight or after. However, by the reckoning of Bede's time, passage from the old day to the new occurred at sunset, not midnight, and Cuthbert is clear that he died after sunset. Thus, while his box was brought at three o'clock Wednesday afternoon the 25th, by the time of the final dictation it might be considered already Thursday in that ecclesiastical sense, although the 25th in the ordinary sense."

Cuthbert's letter also relates a five-line poem in the vernacular that Bede composed on his deathbed, known as "<a href="Bede%27s%20Death%20Song">Bede's Death Song</a>". It is the most-widely copied Old English poem, and appears in 45 manuscripts, but its attribution to Bede is not certain—not all manuscripts name Bede as the author, and the ones that do are of later origin than those that do not. Bede's remains may have been transferred to Durham Cathedral in the 11th century; his tomb there was looted in 1541, but the contents were probably re-interred in the Galilee chapel at the cathedral.

One further oddity in his writings is that in one of his works, the "Commentary on the Seven Catholic Epistles", he writes in a manner that gives the impression he was married. The section in question is the only one in that work that is written in first-person view. Bede says: "Prayers are hindered by the conjugal duty because as often as I perform what is due to my wife I am not able to pray." Another passage, in the "Commentary on Luke", also mentions a wife in the first person: "Formerly I possessed a wife in the lustful passion of desire and now I possess her in honourable sanctification and true love of Christ." The historian Benedicta Ward argues that these passages are Bede employing a rhetorical device.

Bede wrote scientific, historical and theological works, reflecting the range of his writings from music and <a href="meter%20%28music%29">metrics</a> to exegetical <a href="Scripture">Scripture</a> commentaries. He knew <a href="Church%20father">patristic</a> literature, as well as <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>, <a href="Lucretius">Lucretius</a>, <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>, <a href="Horace">Horace</a> and other <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical</a> writers. He knew some Greek.

Bede's scriptural commentaries employed the <a href="allegory">allegorical</a> method of interpretation and his history includes accounts of miracles, which to modern historians has seemed at odds with his critical approach to the materials in his history. Modern studies have shown the important role such concepts played in the world-view of Early Medieval scholars.

He dedicated his work on the Apocalypse and the "De Temporum Ratione" to the successor of Ceolfrid as abbot, Hwaetbert.

Although Bede is mainly studied as a historian now, in his time his works on grammar, chronology, and biblical studies were as important as his historical and hagiographical works. The non-historical works contributed greatly to the <a href="Carolingian%20renaissance">Carolingian renaissance</a>. He has been credited with writing a <a href="Paenitentiale%20Bedae">penitential</a>, though his authorship of this work is still very much disputed .

Bede's best-known work is the "<a href="Historia%20ecclesiastica%20gentis%20Anglorum">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</a>", or "An Ecclesiastical History of the English People", completed in about 731. Bede was aided in writing this book by <a href="Albinus%20%28abbot%29">Albinus</a>, abbot of <a href="St%20Augustine%27s%20Abbey">St Augustine's Abbey</a>, <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>. The first of the five books begins with some geographical background, and then sketches the history of England, beginning with <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Caesar's</a> invasion in 55 BC. A brief account of Christianity in Roman Britain, including the martyrdom of <a href="Saint%20Alban">St Alban</a>, is followed by the story of <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">Augustine</a>'s mission to England in 597, which brought Christianity to the Anglo-Saxons. The second book begins with the death of <a href="Gregory%20the%20Great">Gregory the Great</a> in 604, and follows the further progress of Christianity in Kent and the first attempts to evangelise Northumbria. These ended in disaster when <a href="Penda%20of%20Mercia">Penda</a>, the pagan king of Mercia, killed the newly Christian <a href="Edwin%20of%20Northumbria">Edwin of Northumbria</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hatfield%20Chase">Battle of Hatfield Chase</a> in about 632. The setback was temporary, and the third book recounts the growth of Christianity in Northumbria under kings <a href="Oswald%20of%20Northumbria">Oswald of Northumbria</a> and <a href="Oswy%20of%20Northumbria">Oswy</a>. The climax of the third book is the account of the <a href="Council%20of%20Whitby">Council of Whitby</a>, traditionally seen as a major turning point in English history. The fourth book begins with the consecration of <a href="Theodore%20of%20Canterbury">Theodore</a> as <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, and recounts <a href="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a>'s efforts to bring Christianity to the <a href="kingdom%20of%20Sussex">kingdom of Sussex</a>. The fifth book brings the story up to Bede's day, and includes an account of missionary work in Frisia, and of the conflict with the <a href="Celtic%20Christianity">British church</a> over the correct dating of Easter. Bede wrote a preface for the work, in which he dedicates it to <a href="Ceolwulf%20of%20Northumbria">Ceolwulf</a>, king of Northumbria. The preface mentions that Ceolwulf received an earlier draft of the book; presumably Ceolwulf knew enough Latin to understand it, and he may even have been able to read it. The preface makes it clear that Ceolwulf had requested the earlier copy, and Bede had asked for Ceolwulf's approval; this correspondence with the king indicates that Bede's monastery had excellent connections among the Northumbrian nobility.

The monastery at Wearmouth-Jarrow had an excellent library. Both Benedict Biscop and Ceolfrith had acquired books from the Continent, and in Bede's day the monastery was a renowned centre of learning. It has been estimated that there were about 200 books in the monastic library.

For the period prior to Augustine's arrival in 597, Bede drew on earlier writers, including <a href="Solinus">Solinus</a>. He had access to two works of <a href="Eusebius%20of%20Caesarea">Eusebius</a>: the "<a href="Church%20History%20%28Eusebius%29">Historia Ecclesiastica</a>", and also the "<a href="Chronicon%20%28Eusebius%29">Chronicon</a>", though he had neither in the original Greek; instead he had a Latin translation of the "Historia", by Rufinus, and Saint Jerome's translation of the "Chronicon". He also knew <a href="Paulus%20Orosius">Orosius</a>'s "Adversus Paganus", and <a href="Gregory%20of%20Tours">Gregory of Tours</a>' "Historia Francorum", both Christian histories, as well as the work of <a href="Eutropius%20%28historian%29">Eutropius</a>, a pagan historian. He used <a href="Constantius%20of%20Lyon">Constantius</a>'s "Life of Germanus" as a source for <a href="Germanus%20of%20Auxerre">Germanus</a>'s visits to Britain. Bede's account of the invasion of the Anglo-Saxons is drawn largely from <a href="Gildas">Gildas</a>'s "<a href="De%20Excidio%20et%20Conquestu%20Britanniae">De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae</a>". Bede would also have been familiar with more recent accounts such as <a href="Eddius%20Stephanus">Eddius Stephanus</a>'s "<a href="Life%20of%20Wilfrid">Life of Wilfrid</a>", and anonymous "Lives" of Gregory the Great and Cuthbert. He also drew on <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a>'s "Antiquities", and the works of <a href="Cassiodorus">Cassiodorus</a>, and there was a copy of the "<a href="Liber%20Pontificalis">Liber Pontificalis</a>" in Bede's monastery. Bede quotes from several classical authors, including <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a>, <a href="Plautus">Plautus</a>, and <a href="Terence">Terence</a>, but he may have had access to their work via a Latin grammar rather than directly. However, it is clear he was familiar with the works of <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a> and with <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>'s "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Natural History</a>", and his monastery also owned copies of the works of <a href="Dionysius%20Exiguus">Dionysius Exiguus</a>. He probably drew his account of St. Alban from a life of that saint which has not survived. He acknowledges two other lives of saints directly; one is a life of <a href="Saint%20Fursey">Fursa</a>, and the other of St. <a href="%C3%86thelburh%20of%20Barking">Æthelburh</a>; the latter no longer survives. He also had access to a life of Ceolfrith. Some of Bede's material came from oral traditions, including a description of the physical appearance of <a href="Paulinus%20of%20York">Paulinus of York</a>, who had died nearly 90 years before Bede's "Historia Ecclesiastica" was written.

Bede also had correspondents who supplied him with material. Albinus, the abbot of the monastery in Canterbury, provided much information about the church in Kent, and with the assistance of <a href="Nothelm">Nothhelm</a>, at that time a priest in London, obtained copies of <a href="Gregory%20the%20Great">Gregory the Great</a>'s correspondence from Rome relating to Augustine's mission. Almost all of Bede's information regarding Augustine is taken from these letters. Bede acknowledged his correspondents in the preface to the "Historia Ecclesiastica"; he was in contact with <a href="Daniel%20of%20Winchester">Daniel</a>, the Bishop of Winchester, for information about the history of the church in Wessex, and also wrote to the monastery at <a href="Lastingham">Lastingham</a> for information about <a href="Cedd">Cedd</a> and <a href="Chad%20of%20Mercia">Chad</a>. Bede also mentions an Abbot Esi as a source for the affairs of the East Anglian church, and Bishop <a href="Kinebertus">Cynibert</a> for information about Lindsey.

The historian <a href="Walter%20Goffart">Walter Goffart</a> argues that Bede based the structure of the "Historia" on three works, using them as the framework around which the three main sections of the work were structured. For the early part of the work, up until the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels that Bede used <a href="Gildas">Gildas</a>'s "De excidio". The second section, detailing the <a href="Gregorian%20mission">Gregorian mission</a> of <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">Augustine of Canterbury</a> was framed on the anonymous "Life of Gregory the Great" written at Whitby. The last section, detailing events after the Gregorian mission, Goffart feels were modelled on <a href="Eddius">Stephen of Ripon</a>'s "Life of Wilfrid". Most of Bede's informants for information after Augustine's mission came from the eastern part of Britain, leaving significant gaps in the knowledge of the western areas, which were those areas likely to have a native Briton presence.

Bede's stylistic models included some of the same authors from whom he drew the material for the earlier parts of his history. His introduction imitates the work of Orosius, and his title is an echo of Eusebius's "<a href="Church%20History%20%28Eusebius%29">Historia Ecclesiastica</a>". Bede also followed Eusebius in taking the "<a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a>" as the model for the overall work: where Eusebius used the "Acts" as the theme for his description of the development of the church, Bede made it the model for his history of the Anglo-Saxon church. Bede quoted his sources at length in his narrative, as Eusebius had done. Bede also appears to have taken quotes directly from his correspondents at times. For example, he almost always uses the terms "Australes" and "Occidentales" for the South and West Saxons respectively, but in a passage in the first book he uses "Meridiani" and "Occidui" instead, as perhaps his informant had done. At the end of the work, Bede added a brief autobiographical note; this was an idea taken from <a href="Gregory%20of%20Tours">Gregory of Tours</a>' earlier "History of the Franks".

Bede's work as a <a href="hagiography">hagiographer</a>, and his detailed attention to dating, were both useful preparations for the task of writing the "Historia Ecclesiastica". His interest in <a href="computus">computus</a>, the science of calculating the date of Easter, was also useful in the account he gives of the controversy between the British and Anglo-Saxon church over the correct method of obtaining the Easter date.

Bede is described by <a href="Michael%20Lapidge">Michael Lapidge</a> as "without question the most accomplished Latinist produced in these islands in the Anglo-Saxon period". His Latin has been praised for its clarity, but his style in the "Historia Ecclesiastica" is not simple. He knew rhetoric, and often used figures of speech and rhetorical forms which cannot easily be reproduced in translation, depending as they often do on the connotations of the Latin words. However, unlike contemporaries such as <a href="Aldhelm">Aldhelm</a>, whose Latin is full of difficulties, Bede's own text is easy to read. In the words of Charles Plummer, one of the best-known editors of the "Historia Ecclesiastica", Bede's Latin is "clear and limpid ... it is very seldom that we have to pause to think of the meaning of a sentence ... Alcuin rightly praises Bede for his unpretending style."

Bede's primary intention in writing the "Historia Ecclesiastica" was to show the growth of the united church throughout England. The native Britons, whose Christian church survived the departure of the Romans, earn Bede's ire for refusing to help convert the Saxons; by the end of the "Historia" the English, and their Church, are dominant over the Britons. This goal, of showing the movement towards unity, explains Bede's animosity towards the British method of calculating Easter: much of the "Historia" is devoted to a history of the dispute, including the final resolution at the <a href="Synod%20of%20Whitby">Synod of Whitby</a> in 664. Bede is also concerned to show the unity of the English, despite the disparate kingdoms that still existed when he was writing. He also wants to instruct the reader by spiritual example, and to entertain, and to the latter end he adds stories about many of the places and people about which he wrote.

N.J. Higham argues that Bede designed his work to promote his reform agenda to Ceolwulf, the Northumbrian king. Bede painted a highly optimistic picture of the current situation in the Church, as opposed to the more pessimistic picture found in his private letters.

Bede's extensive use of miracles can prove difficult for readers who consider him a more or less reliable historian, but do not accept the possibility of miracles.
Yet both reflect an inseparable integrity and regard for accuracy and truth, expressed in terms both of historical events and of a tradition of Christian faith that continues to the present day. Bede, like Gregory the Great whom Bede quotes on the subject in the "Historia", felt that faith brought about by miracles was a stepping stone to a higher, truer faith, and that as a result miracles had their place in a work designed to instruct.

Bede is somewhat reticent about the career of <a href="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a>, a contemporary and one of the most prominent clerics of his day. This may be because Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.

Bede's account of the early migrations of the Angles and Saxons to England omits any mention of a movement of those peoples across the channel from Britain to Brittany described by <a href="Procopius">Procopius</a>, who was writing in the sixth century. <a href="Frank%20Stenton">Frank Stenton</a> describes this omission as "a scholar's dislike of the indefinite"; traditional material that could not be dated or used for Bede's didactic purposes had no interest for him.

Bede was a Northumbrian, and this tinged his work with a local bias. The sources to which he had access gave him less information about the west of England than for other areas. He says relatively little about the achievements of Mercia and Wessex, omitting, for example, any mention of <a href="Boniface">Boniface</a>, a West Saxon missionary to the continent of some renown and of whom Bede had almost certainly heard, though Bede does discuss Northumbrian missionaries to the continent. He also is parsimonious in his praise for <a href="Aldhelm">Aldhelm</a>, a West Saxon who had done much to convert the native Britons to the Roman form of Christianity. He lists seven kings of the Anglo-Saxons whom he regards as having held "imperium", or overlordship; only one king of Wessex, <a href="Ceawlin">Ceawlin</a>, is listed, and none from Mercia, though elsewhere he acknowledges the secular power several of the Mercians held. Historian <a href="Robin%20Fleming">Robin Fleming</a> states that he was so hostile to Mercia because Northumbria had been diminished by Mercian power that he consulted no Mercian informants and included no stories about its saints.

Bede relates the story of Augustine's mission from Rome, and tells how the British clergy refused to assist Augustine in the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. This, combined with Gildas's negative assessment of the British church at the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasions, led Bede to a very critical view of the native church. However, Bede ignores the fact that at the time of Augustine's mission, the history between the two was one of warfare and conquest, which, in the words of <a href="Barbara%20Yorke">Barbara Yorke</a>, would have naturally "curbed any missionary impulses towards the Anglo-Saxons from the British clergy."

At the time Bede wrote the "Historia Ecclesiastica", there were two common ways of referring to dates. One was to use <a href="indiction">indiction</a>s, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach was to use regnal years—the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date would have to be given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the "<a href="Anno%20Domini">Anno Domini</a>" method invented by <a href="Dionysius%20Exiguus">Dionysius Exiguus</a>. Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his promulgation of it in "De Temporum Ratione", his work on chronology, is the main reason why it is now so widely used. <a href="Beda%20Venerabilis%27%20Easter%20cycle">Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle</a>, contained in "De Temporum Ratione", was developed from Dionysius Exiguus’ famous Easter table.

The "Historia Ecclesiastica" was copied often in the Middle Ages, and about 160 manuscripts containing it survive. About half of those are located on the European continent, rather than on the British Isles. Most of the 8th- and 9th-century texts of Bede's "Historia" come from the northern parts of the <a href="Carolingian">Carolingian</a> Empire. This total does not include manuscripts with only a part of the work, of which another 100 or so survive. It was printed for the first time between 1474 and 1482, probably at <a href="Strasbourg%2C%20France">Strasbourg, France</a>. Modern historians have studied the "Historia" extensively, and a number of editions have been produced. For many years, early Anglo-Saxon history was essentially a retelling of the "Historia", but recent scholarship has focused as much on what Bede did not write as what he did. The belief that the "Historia" was the culmination of Bede's works, the aim of all his scholarship, a belief common among historians in the past, is no longer accepted by most scholars.

Modern historians and editors of Bede have been lavish in their praise of his achievement in the "Historia Ecclesiastica". Stenton regarded it as one of the "small class of books which transcend all but the most fundamental conditions of time and place", and regarded its quality as dependent on Bede's "astonishing power of co-ordinating the fragments of information which came to him through tradition, the relation of friends, or documentary evidence ... In an age where little was attempted beyond the registration of fact, he had reached the conception of history." <a href="Patrick%20Wormald">Patrick Wormald</a> described him as "the first and greatest of England's historians".

The "Historia Ecclesiastica" has given Bede a high reputation, but his concerns were different from those of a modern writer of history. His focus on the history of the organisation of the English church, and on heresies and the efforts made to root them out, led him to exclude the secular history of kings and kingdoms except where a moral lesson could be drawn or where they illuminated events in the church. Besides the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>", the medieval writers <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>, <a href="Henry%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a>, and <a href="Geoffrey%20of%20Monmouth">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a> used his works as sources and inspirations. Early modern writers, such as <a href="Polydore%20Vergil">Polydore Vergil</a> and <a href="Matthew%20Parker">Matthew Parker</a>, the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, also utilised the "Historia", and his works were used by both Protestant and Catholic sides in the Wars of Religion.

Some historians have questioned the reliability of some of Bede's accounts. One historian, Charlotte Behr, thinks that the "Historia's" account of the arrival of the Germanic invaders in Kent should not be considered to relate what actually happened, but rather relates myths that were current in Kent during Bede's time.

It is likely that Bede's work, because it was so widely copied, discouraged others from writing histories and may even have led to the disappearance of manuscripts containing older historical works.

As Chapter 66 of his "On the Reckoning of Time", in 725 Bede wrote the "Greater Chronicle" ("chronica maiora"), which sometimes circulated as a separate work. For recent events the "Chronicle", like his "Ecclesiastical History", relied upon Gildas, upon a version of the <a href="Liber%20pontificalis">Liber pontificalis</a> current at least to the papacy of <a href="Pope%20Sergius%20I">Pope Sergius I</a> (687–701), and other sources. For earlier events he drew on <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>'s "Chronikoi Kanones." The dating of events in the "Chronicle" is inconsistent with his other works, using the era of creation, the <a href="anno%20mundi">anno mundi</a>.

His other historical works included lives of the abbots of <a href="Jarrow%23Wearmouth-Jarrow%20Priory">Wearmouth and Jarrow</a>, as well as verse and prose lives of <a href="Cuthbert%20of%20Lindisfarne">Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne</a>, an adaptation of <a href="Paulinus%20of%20Nola">Paulinus of Nola</a>'s "Life of St Felix", and a translation of the Greek "Passion of <a href="Saint%20Anastasius">St Anastasius</a>". He also created a listing of saints, the "Martyrology".

In his own time, Bede was as well known for his biblical commentaries and exegetical, as well as other theological works. The majority of his writings were of this type, and covered the Old Testament and the New Testament. Most survived the Middle Ages, but a few were lost. It was for his theological writings that he earned the title of "Doctor Anglorum", and why he was made a saint.

Bede synthesised and transmitted the learning from his predecessors, as well as made careful, judicious innovation in knowledge (such as recalculating the age of the earth—for which he was censured before surviving the heresy accusations and eventually having his views championed by Archbishop Ussher in the sixteenth century—see below) that had theological implications. In order to do this, he learned Greek, and attempted to learn Hebrew. He spent time reading and rereading both the Old and the New Testaments. He mentions that he studied from a text of <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a>'s <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a>, which itself was from the Hebrew text. He also studied both the Latin and the Greek Fathers of the Church. In the monastic library at Jarrow were a number of books by theologians, including works by <a href="Basil%20of%20Caesarea">Basil</a>, <a href="John%20Cassian">Cassian</a>, <a href="John%20Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a>, <a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore of Seville</a>, <a href="Origen">Origen</a>, <a href="Gregory%20of%20Nazianzus">Gregory of Nazianzus</a>, <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a>, <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a>, <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Pope Gregory I</a>, <a href="Ambrose%20of%20Milan">Ambrose of Milan</a>, <a href="Cassiodorus">Cassiodorus</a>, and <a href="Cyprian">Cyprian</a>. He used these, in conjunction with the Biblical texts themselves, to write his commentaries and other theological works. He had a Latin translation by <a href="Evagrius%20of%20Antioch">Evagrius</a> of <a href="Athanasius">Athanasius</a>'s "Life of Antony", and a copy of <a href="Sulpicius%20Severus">Sulpicius Severus</a>' "Life of St. Martin". He also used lesser known writers, such as <a href="Fulgentius%20of%20Ruspe">Fulgentius</a>, <a href="Julian%20of%20Eclanum">Julian of Eclanum</a>, <a href="Tyconius">Tyconius</a>, and <a href="Prosper%20of%20Aquitaine">Prosper of Aquitaine</a>. Bede was the first to refer to Jerome, Augustine, Pope Gregory and Ambrose as the four Latin <a href="Fathers%20of%20the%20Church">Fathers of the Church</a>. It is clear from Bede's own comments that he felt his calling was to explain to his students and readers the theology and thoughts of the Church Fathers.

Bede also wrote homilies, works written to explain theology used in worship services. Bede wrote homilies not only on the major Christian seasons such as <a href="Advent">Advent</a>, <a href="Lent">Lent</a>, or Easter, but on other subjects such as anniversaries of significant events.

Both types of Bede's theological works circulated widely in the Middle Ages. A number of his biblical commentaries were incorporated into the "<a href="Glossa%20Ordinaria">Glossa Ordinaria</a>", an 11th-century collection of biblical commentaries. Some of Bede's homilies were collected by <a href="Paul%20the%20Deacon">Paul the Deacon</a>, and they were used in that form in the <a href="Liturgy%20of%20the%20Hours">Monastic Office</a>. <a href="Saint%20Boniface">Saint Boniface</a> used Bede's homilies in his missionary efforts on the continent.

Bede sometimes included in his theological books an acknowledgement of the predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave the details of his sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all to be found in the Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Encyclopedia</a>", for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have quoted from it in his "De temporum ratione".

The works dealing with the Old Testament included "Commentary on Samuel", "Commentary on Genesis", "Commentaries on Ezra and Nehemiah", "On the Temple", "On the Tabernacle", "Commentaries on Tobit", "Commentaries on Proverbs", "Commentaries on the Song of Songs", "Commentaries on the Canticle of Habakkuk", The works on Ezra, the Tabernacle and the Temple were especially influenced by Gregory the Great's writings.

Bede's works included "Commentary on Revelation", "Commentary on the Catholic Epistles", "Commentary on Acts", "Reconsideration on the Books of Acts", "On the Gospel of Mark", "On the Gospel of Luke", and "Homilies on the Gospels". At the time of his death he was working on a translation of the Gospel of St. John into English. He did this for the last 40 days of his life. When the last passage had been translated he said: "All is finished."

"De temporibus", or "On Time", written in about 703, provides an introduction to the principles of Easter <a href="Computus%23History">computus</a>. This was based on parts of <a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore of Seville</a>'s "<a href="Etymologiae">Etymologies</a>", and Bede also included a chronology of the world which was derived from Eusebius, with some revisions based on Jerome's translation of the bible. In about 723, Bede wrote a longer work on the same subject, "On the Reckoning of Time", which was influential throughout the Middle Ages. He also wrote several shorter letters and essays discussing specific aspects of computus.

"On the Reckoning of Time" ("<a href="The%20Reckoning%20of%20Time">De temporum ratione</a>") included an introduction to the traditional ancient and medieval view of the <a href="cosmos">cosmos</a>, including an explanation of how the <a href="spherical%20earth">spherical earth</a> influenced the changing <a href="length%20of%20day">length of day</a>light, of how the <a href="season">season</a>al motion of the Sun and Moon influenced the changing appearance of the <a href="New%20Moon">New Moon</a> at evening twilight, and a quantitative relation between the changes of the <a href="tides">tides</a> at a given place and the daily motion of the moon. Since the focus of his book was the <a href="computus">computus</a>, Bede gave instructions for <a href="Easter%20controversy%23Third%20phase">computing the date of Easter</a> and the related time of the <a href="Paschal%20Full%20Moon">Easter Full Moon</a>, for calculating the motion of the Sun and Moon through the <a href="zodiac">zodiac</a>, and for many other calculations related to the calendar. He gives some information about the months of the Anglo-Saxon calendar in chapter XV. Any codex of <a href="Beda%20Venerabilis%27%20Easter%20cycle">Bede's Easter cycle</a> is normally found together with a codex of his "De Temporum Ratione".

For calendric purposes, Bede made a new calculation of the <a href="Dating%20Creation">age of the world</a> since the <a href="Genesis%20creation%20narrative">creation</a>, which he dated as 3952 BC. Due to his innovations in computing the age of the world, he was accused of heresy at the table of Bishop <a href="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a>, his chronology being contrary to accepted calculations. Once informed of the accusations of these "lewd rustics," Bede refuted them in his Letter to Plegwin.

In addition to these works on astronomical timekeeping, he also wrote "De natura rerum", or "On the Nature of Things", modelled in part after the work of the same title by <a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore of Seville</a>. His works were so influential that late in the 9th century <a href="Notker%20the%20Stammerer">Notker the Stammerer</a>, a monk of the <a href="Abbey%20of%20St.%20Gall">Monastery of St. Gall</a> in Switzerland, wrote that "God, the orderer of natures, who raised the Sun from the East on the fourth day of Creation, in the sixth day of the world has made Bede rise from the West as a new Sun to illuminate the whole Earth".

Bede wrote some works designed to help teach grammar in the abbey school. One of these was his "De arte metrica", a discussion of the composition of Latin verse, drawing on previous grammarians work. It was based on Donatus' "De pedibus" and <a href="Maurus%20Servius%20Honoratus">Servius</a>' "De finalibus", and used examples from Christian poets as well as Virgil. It became a standard text for the teaching of Latin verse during the next few centuries. Bede dedicated this work to Cuthbert, apparently a student, for he is named "beloved son" in the dedication, and Bede says "I have laboured to educate you in divine letters and ecclesiastical statutes" Another textbook of Bede's is the "De orthographia", a work on <a href="orthography">orthography</a>, designed to help a medieval reader of Latin with unfamiliar abbreviations and words from classical Latin works. Although it could serve as a textbook, it appears to have been mainly intended as a reference work. The exact date of composition for both of these works is unknown.

Another educational work is "De schematibus et tropis sacrae scripturae", which discusses the Bible's use of rhetoric. Bede was familiar with pagan authors such as Virgil, but it was not considered appropriate to teach biblical grammar from such texts, and in "De schematibus ..." Bede argues for the superiority of Christian texts in understanding Christian literature. Similarly, his text on poetic metre uses only Christian poetry for examples.

According to his disciple Cuthbert, Bede was also "doctus in nostris carminibus" ("learned in our songs"). Cuthbert's letter on Bede's death, the "Epistola Cuthberti de obitu Bedae", moreover, commonly is understood to indicate that Bede also composed a five line vernacular poem known to modern scholars as "Bede's Death Song"
As Opland notes, however, it is not entirely clear that Cuthbert is attributing this text to Bede: most manuscripts of the letter do not use a <a href="finite%20verb">finite verb</a> to describe Bede's presentation of the song, and the theme was relatively common in Old English and Anglo-Latin literature. The fact that Cuthbert's description places the performance of the Old English poem in the context of a series of quoted passages from Sacred Scripture, indeed, might be taken as evidence simply that Bede also cited analogous vernacular texts. On the other hand, the inclusion of the Old English text of the poem in Cuthbert's Latin letter, the observation that Bede "was learned in our song," and the fact that Bede composed a Latin poem on the same subject all point to the possibility of his having written it. By citing the poem directly, Cuthbert seems to imply that its particular wording was somehow important, either since it was a vernacular poem endorsed by a scholar who evidently frowned upon secular entertainment or because it is a direct quotation of Bede's last original composition.

There is no evidence for cult being paid to Bede in England in the 8th century. One reason for this may be that he died on the feast day of <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">Augustine of Canterbury</a>. Later, when he was <a href="veneration">venerated</a> in England, he was either commemorated after Augustine on 26 May, or his feast was moved to 27 May. However, he was venerated outside England, mainly through the efforts of <a href="Saint%20Boniface">Boniface</a> and <a href="Alcuin">Alcuin</a>, both of whom promoted the cult on the Continent. Boniface wrote repeatedly back to England during his missionary efforts, requesting copies of Bede's theological works. Alcuin, who was taught at the school set up in York by Bede's pupil <a href="Ecgbert%20%28bishop%29">Egbert</a>, praised Bede as an example for monks to follow and was instrumental in disseminating Bede's works to all of Alcuin's friends. Bede's cult became prominent in England during the 10th-century revival of monasticism, and by the 14th century had spread to many of the cathedrals of England. <a href="Wulfstan%20%28Bishop%20of%20Worcester%29">Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester</a> (c. 1008–1095) was a particular devotee of Bede's, dedicating a church to him in 1062, which was Wulfstan's first undertaking after his consecration as bishop.

His body was '<a href="translation%20%28relic%29">translated</a>' (the ecclesiastical term for relocation of relics) from Jarrow to Durham Cathedral around 1020, where it was placed in the same tomb with Saint <a href="Cuthbert%20of%20Lindisfarne">Cuthbert of Lindisfarne</a>. Later Bede's remains were moved to a shrine in the Galilee Chapel at <a href="Durham%20Cathedral">Durham Cathedral</a> in 1370. The shrine was destroyed during the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a>, but the bones were reburied in the chapel. In 1831 the bones were dug up and then reburied in a new tomb, which is still there. Other <a href="relic">relic</a>s were claimed by <a href="York%20Minster">York</a>, <a href="Glastonbury%20Abbey">Glastonbury</a> and <a href="Fulda">Fulda</a>.

His scholarship and importance to Catholicism were recognised in 1899 when he was declared a <a href="Doctor%20of%20the%20Church">Doctor of the Church</a>. He is the only Englishman named a Doctor of the Church. He is also the only Englishman in <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante</a>'s "<a href="Paradiso%20%28Dante%29">Paradise</a>" ("<a href="Paradiso%20%28Dante%29">Paradiso</a>" X.130), mentioned among theologians and doctors of the church in the same canto as <a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore of Seville</a> and the Scot <a href="Richard%20of%20St.%20Victor">Richard of St. Victor</a>.

His feast day was included in the <a href="General%20Roman%20Calendar">General Roman Calendar</a> in 1899, for celebration on 27 May rather than on his date of death, 26 May, which was then the feast day of <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20VII">Pope Saint Gregory VII</a>. He is venerated in both the Anglican and Roman Catholic Church, with a feast day of 25 May, and in the Eastern Orthodox Church, with a feast day on 27 May.

Bede became known as "<a href="Venerable">Venerable</a> Bede" (Lat.: Beda Venerabilis) by the 9th century because of his holiness, but this was not linked to consideration for <a href="Canonization">sainthood</a> by the Roman Catholic Church. According to a legend the epithet was miraculously supplied by angels, thus completing his unfinished epitaph. It is first utilised in connection with Bede in the 9th century, where Bede was grouped with others who were called "venerable" at two ecclesiastical councils held at Aachen in 816 and 836. <a href="Paul%20the%20Deacon">Paul the Deacon</a> then referred to him as venerable consistently. By the 11th and 12th century, it had become commonplace. However, there are no descriptions of Bede by that term right after his death.

Bede's reputation as a historian, based mostly on the "Historia Ecclesiastica", remains strong; historian <a href="Walter%20Goffart">Walter Goffart</a> says of Bede that he "holds a privileged and unrivalled place among first historians of Christian Europe". His life and work have been celebrated with the annual Jarrow Lecture, held at St. Paul's Church, Jarrow, since 1958. The English Heritage Organization created Jarrow Hall (previously known as Bede's World), a museum that celebrates the history of Bede and other parts of English heritage.

Bubble tea

Bubble tea (also known as pearl milk tea, bubble milk tea, boba juice, boba tea, or simply boba) (, with <a href="tapioca%20balls">tapioca balls</a> it is ) is a <a href="Taiwan">Taiwanese</a> <a href="tea">tea</a>-based drink invented in <a href="Tainan">Tainan</a> and <a href="Taichung">Taichung</a> in the 1980s. Most bubble tea recipes contain a tea base mixed/shaken with fruit or milk, to which chewy <a href="tapioca%20balls">tapioca balls</a> (known as bubbles, pearls, or boba) and <a href="Fruit%20preserves%23Jelly">fruit jelly</a> are often added. Ice-blended versions are usually mixed with fruit or syrup, resulting in a slushy consistency. There are many varieties of the drink with a wide range of ingredients. The two most popular varieties are bubble milk tea with tapioca and bubble milk green tea with tapioca.

Bubble teas are typically of two distinct types: fruit-flavored teas and <a href="milk%20tea">milk tea</a>s. Some shops offer hybrid fruit milk teas. Most milk teas include powdered dairy or <a href="non-dairy%20creamer">non-dairy creamer</a>s, but some shops offer fresh milk as an alternative. Other varieties are 100% crushed-fruit smoothies with tapioca pearls and signature ice cream shakes made from local sources. Many American bubble tea vendors sell milk smoothies, which are similar to bubble tea but do not contain any tea ingredients. Some small cafés offer sweetener substitutes such as <a href="honey">honey</a>, <a href="agave">agave</a>, <a href="stevia">stevia</a>, and <a href="aspartame">aspartame</a> upon request.

The oldest known bubble tea consisted of a mixture of hot <a href="Taiwanese%20cuisine">Taiwanese</a> <a href="black%20tea">black tea</a>, small <a href="tapioca">tapioca pearls</a> (粉圓), <a href="condensed%20milk">condensed milk</a>, and syrup (糖漿) or honey. Many variations followed; the most common are served cold rather than hot. The most prevalent varieties of tea have changed frequently.

First to gain popularity was bubble green tea, which uses <a href="Jasmine%20tea">jasmine-infused green tea</a> (茉香綠茶) rather than black tea. Larger tapioca pearls (波霸/黑珍珠) were adapted and quickly replaced the small pearls. Peach or plum flavoring soon became popular, followed by additional fruit flavors. Such fruit flavors gained popularity to the extent that, in some variations, the tea was removed entirely in favor of real fruit. These variants sometimes contain colored pearls (or jelly cubes as in the related drink <a href="taho">taho</a>), for which the color may be chosen to match the fruit juice used. Flavors may be added in the form of powder, fruit juice, pulp, or syrup to hot black or green tea, which is then shaken in a <a href="cocktail%20shaker">cocktail shaker</a> or mixed with ice in a <a href="blender%20%28device%29">blender</a>. Cooked tapioca pearls and other mix-ins (such as vanilla extract, honey, syrup, and sugar) are added as a final step.

Today, one can find shops entirely devoted to bubble tea, similar to the <a href="juice%20bar">juice bar</a>s of the early 1990s. Some cafés use plastic dome-shaped lids, while other bubble tea bars serve drinks using a machine to seal the top of the cup with plastic cellophane (often printed with designs). The latter method allows the tea to be shaken in the serving cup and makes it spill-free until one is ready to drink it. The cellophane is then pierced with an oversize straw large enough to allow the pearls to pass through. Today, in Taiwan, it is most common for people to refer to the drink as pearl milk tea (zhēn zhū nǎi chá, or zhēn nǎi for short). Pearl milk tea may be used by English speakers and overseas Chinese and Taiwanese speakers, but it is usually called bubble tea or boba tea by English speakers, with the former seemingly more common in locations with less Chinese influence.

Each of the ingredients of bubble tea can have many variations depending on the tea store. Typically, different types of black tea, <a href="green%20tea">green tea</a>, white tea, or even coffee form the basis of this beverage. The most common black tea varieties are <a href="oolong">oolong</a> and Earl Grey, while jasmine green tea is a mainstay at almost all tea stores. Another variation called <a href="Yuanyang%20%28drink%29">yuanyang</a> (鴛鴦, named after the <a href="Mandarin%20duck">Mandarin duck</a>) originated in Hong Kong and consists of half black tea and half coffee. Some people add milk to the drink. Decaffeinated versions of teas are sometimes available when the tea house freshly brews the tea base.

The milk in bubble tea is optional, though many tea stores use it. Some cafés use a non-dairy creamer <a href="milk%20substitute">milk substitute</a> instead of milk because many East Asians are <a href="lactose%20intolerant">lactose intolerant</a> and because it is cheaper and easier to store and use than perishable milk. In Western countries, soy milk options are widely available for those who avoid dairy products. This adds a distinct flavor and consistency to the drink.

Flavorings can be added to bubble tea. Some widely available fruit flavors include <a href="Garden%20strawberry">strawberry</a>, <a href="apple">green apple</a>, <a href="passion%20fruit">passion fruit</a>, <a href="mango">mango</a>, <a href="lemon">lemon</a>, <a href="watermelon">watermelon</a>, <a href="grape">grape</a>, <a href="lychee">lychee</a>, <a href="peach">peach</a>, <a href="pineapple">pineapple</a>, <a href="cantaloupe">cantaloupe</a>, <a href="honeydew%20%28melon%29">honeydew</a>, <a href="banana">banana</a>, <a href="avocado">avocado</a>, <a href="coconut">coconut</a>, <a href="kiwifruit">kiwifruit</a>, and <a href="jackfruit">jackfruit</a>. Other popular non-fruit flavors include <a href="taro">taro</a>, <a href="pudding">pudding</a>, <a href="chocolate">chocolate</a>, <a href="coffee">coffee</a>, <a href="cafe%20mocha">mocha</a>, <a href="barley">barley</a>, <a href="sesame">sesame</a>, <a href="almond">almond</a>, <a href="ginger">ginger</a>, <a href="lavender">lavender</a>, <a href="rose">rose</a>, <a href="caramel">caramel</a>, <a href="viola%20%28plant%29">violet</a>, and <a href="Thai%20tea">Thai tea</a>. Some of the sour fruit flavors are available in bubble tea without milk as the acidity tends to curdle the milk.

Other varieties of the bubble tea drink can include blended drinks. Many stores in the US provide a list of choices. Some may include coffee-blended drinks or even smoothies.

Although bubble tea originated in Taiwan, bubble tea 'mash ups' are becoming popular, where inspiration for flavours comes from other cuisines. For example, using hibiscus flowers from Mexico; saffron, cardamom, and condensed milk for Indian bubble tea; and rosewater for Persian flavoured bubble tea.

<a href="Tapioca">Tapioca</a> balls (boba) are the prevailing chewy tidbits in bubble tea, but a wide range of other options can be used to add similar texture to the drink. Green pearls have a small hint of green tea flavor and are chewier than the traditional tapioca balls. Jelly is used in small cubes, stars, or rectangular strips, with flavors such as <a href="nata%20de%20coco">coconut jelly</a>, <a href="konjac">konjac</a>, <a href="lychee">lychee</a>, <a href="grass%20jelly">grass jelly</a>, <a href="mango">mango</a>, and <a href="green%20tea">green tea</a> available at some shops. Rainbow, a fruit mix of konjac, has a pliant, almost crispy consistency. <a href="Azuki%20bean">Azuki bean</a> or <a href="mung%20bean">mung bean</a> paste, typical toppings for Taiwanese shaved ice desserts, give the drinks an added subtle flavor as well as texture. <a href="Aloe">Aloe</a>, egg pudding (<a href="custard">custard</a>), <a href="sago">sago</a>, and <a href="taro">taro</a> balls can be found in most tea houses.

<a href="Popping%20Boba">Popping Boba</a> are popular too, when they add this to bubble tea. The many flavors include mango, lychee, strawberry, green apple, passion fruit, pomegranate, orange, cantaloupe, blueberry, coffee, chocolate, yogurt, kiwi, peach, banana, lime, cherry, pineapple, red guava.

Due to its popularity, single-serving packets of black tea (with powdered milk and sugar included) are available as "instant boba milk tea" in some places.

Bubble tea cafés will frequently serve drinks without coffee or tea in them. The base for these drinks is flavoring blended with ice, often called snow bubble. All mix-ins that can be added to the bubble tea can be added to these <a href="slushie">slushie</a>-like drinks. One drawback is that the coldness of the iced drink may cause the tapioca balls to harden, making them difficult to suck up through a straw and chew. To prevent this from happening, these slushies must be consumed more quickly than bubble tea.

Occasionally, "<a href="nata%20de%20coco">nata de coco</a>" is used in mass-produced bubble tea drinks as an alternative to tapioca starch. "Nata de coco" is high in dietary fiber and low in <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a> and <a href="fat">fat</a>. The "nata de coco" is sliced into thin strips to make it easier to pass through a straw.

The most accredited story for the origin of bubble tea comes from the Hanlin teahouse in <a href="Tainan">Tainan</a>, <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. In 1986, in the Ya Mu Liao market, teahouse owner Tu Tsong-he got the inspiration when he saw white tapioca balls. He then made tea using the traditional white tapioca balls, which have the appearance of pearls, supposedly resulting in the so-called "pearl tea". Shortly after, Hanlin changed the white tapioca balls to the black version that is seen today. At many locations, one can purchase both black tapioca balls and white tapioca balls; two kinds of bubble tea. 

An alternative origin is the Chun Shui Tang Teahouse in <a href="Taichung">Taichung</a>, Taiwan. Its founder, Liu Han-Chieh, observed how the Japanese served cold coffee (while on a visit in the 1980s) and applied this method to tea. The new style of serving tea propelled his business, and multiple chains were established. This expansion would be the stepping stone for the rapid expansion of bubble tea. The creator of bubble tea is Lin Hsiu Hui, the teahouse's product development manager, who poured a sweetened pudding with tapioca balls into the iced tea drink during a meeting in 1988. The beverage was well received at the meeting, leading to its inclusion on the menu. It ultimately became the franchise's top-selling product.

The drink became popular in most parts of <a href="East%20Asia">East</a> and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> during the 1990s. The drink is well received by global consumers from Canada and USA, specifically around areas with high Asian demographics.


In May 2011, <a href="2011%20Taiwan%20food%20scandal">a food scandal</a> broke out in Taiwan where <a href="Bis%282-ethylhexyl%29%20phthalate">DEHP</a> (a chemical plasticizer and potential carcinogen used to make plastic) was found as a stabilizer in drinks and juice syrups. Some of these products may have been exported and used in bubble tea shops around the world. DEHP can affect hormone balances.

In June 2011, the Health Minister of Malaysia, <a href="Liow%20Tiong%20Lai">Liow Tiong Lai</a>, instructed companies selling "Strawberry Syrup", a material used in some bubble teas, to stop selling them after chemical tests showed they were tainted with DEHP.

In August 2012, scientists from the <a href="RWTH%20Aachen%20University">Technical University of Aachen (RWTH)</a> in Germany analyzed bubble tea samples in a research project to look for allergenic substances. The result indicated that the products contain styrene, acetophenone and brominated substances. The report was published by German newspaper "<a href="Rheinische%20Post">Rheinische Post</a>" and caused Taiwan's representative office in Germany to issue a statement, saying food items in Taiwan are monitored. Taiwan's Food and Drug Administration confirmed in September that, in a second round of tests conducted by German authorities, Taiwanese bubble tea was found to be free of cancer-causing chemicals. The products were also found to contain no excessive levels of heavy-metal contaminants or other health-threatening agents.

In May 2013 the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration issued an alert on the detection of <a href="maleic%20acid">maleic acid</a>, an unapproved food additive, in some food products, including tapioca pearls. The Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore conducted its own tests and found additional brands of tapioca pearls and some other starch-based products sold in Singapore were similarly affected.

Battle of Blenheim

The Battle of Blenheim (German:"Zweite Schlacht bei Höchstädt"; French "Bataille de Höchstädt"), fought on 13 August 1704, was a major battle of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>. The overwhelming Allied victory ensured the safety of <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> from the Franco-Bavarian army, thus preventing the collapse of the <a href="Grand%20Alliance%20%28League%20of%20Augsburg%29">Grand Alliance</a>.

<a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV of France</a> sought to knock <a href="Leopold%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Leopold</a> out of the war by seizing Vienna, the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg</a> capital, and gain a favourable peace settlement. The dangers to Vienna were considerable: the <a href="Maximilian%20II%20Emanuel%2C%20Elector%20of%20Bavaria">Elector of Bavaria</a> and <a href="Ferdinand%20de%20Marsin">Marshal Marsin</a>'s forces in <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> threatened from the west, and <a href="Louis%20Joseph%20de%20Bourbon%2C%20duc%20de%20Vend%C3%B4me">Marshal Vendôme</a>'s large army in northern Italy posed a serious danger with a potential offensive through the <a href="Brenner%20Pass">Brenner Pass</a>. Vienna was also under pressure from <a href="Francis%20II%20R%C3%A1k%C3%B3czi">Rákóczi</a>'s <a href="R%C3%A1k%C3%B3czi%27s%20War%20for%20Independence">Hungarian revolt</a> from its eastern approaches. Realising the danger, the <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">Duke of Marlborough</a> resolved to alleviate the peril to Vienna by marching his forces south from <a href="Bedburg">Bedburg</a> and help maintain Emperor Leopold within the Grand Alliance.

A combination of deception and skilled administration – designed to conceal his true destination from friend and foe alike – enabled Marlborough to march unhindered from the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a> to the <a href="River%20Danube">River Danube</a> in five weeks. <a href="Battle%20of%20Schellenberg">After securing Donauwörth on the Danube</a>, Marlborough sought to engage the Elector's and Marsin's army before <a href="Camille%20d%27Hostun%2C%20duc%20de%20Tallard">Marshal Tallard</a> could bring reinforcements through the <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a>. However, with the Franco-Bavarian commanders reluctant to fight until their numbers were deemed sufficient, the Duke enacted a policy of <a href="Looting">plundering</a> in Bavaria designed to force the issue. The tactic proved unsuccessful, but when Tallard arrived to bolster the Elector's army, and <a href="Prince%20Eugene%20of%20Savoy">Prince Eugene</a> arrived with reinforcements for the Allies, the two armies finally met on the banks of the Danube in and around the small village of <a href="Blindheim">Blindheim</a>, from which the English "Blenheim" is derived.

The battle has gone down in history as one of the turning points of the War of the Spanish Succession. Bavaria was knocked out of the war, and Louis' hopes for a quick victory came to an end. France suffered over 38,000 casualties including the commander-in-chief, Marshal Tallard, who was taken captive to England. Before the 1704 campaign ended, the Allies had taken <a href="Landau">Landau</a>, and the towns of <a href="Trier">Trier</a> and <a href="Traben-Trarbach">Trarbach</a> on the <a href="Moselle%20%28river%29">Moselle</a> in preparation for the following year's campaign into France itself.

By 1704, the War of the Spanish Succession was in its fourth year. The previous year had been one of success for France and her allies, most particularly on the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>, where <a href="Claude-Louis-Hector%20de%20Villars">Marshal Villars</a> and the Elector of Bavaria had created a direct threat to Vienna, the Habsburg capital. Vienna had been saved by dissension between the two commanders, leading to the brilliant Villars being replaced by the less dynamic Marshal Marsin. Nevertheless, by 1704, the threat was still real: <a href="Francis%20II%20R%C3%A1k%C3%B3czi">Rákóczi</a>'s Hungarian revolt was already threatening the Empire's eastern approaches, and Marshal Vendôme's forces threatened an invasion from northern Italy. In the courts of <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Versailles</a> and <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, Vienna's fall was confidently anticipated, an event which would almost certainly have led to the collapse of the <a href="Grand%20Alliance%20%28League%20of%20Augsburg%29">Grand Alliance</a>.

To isolate the Danube from any Allied intervention, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Neufville%2C%20duc%20de%20Villeroi">Marshal Villeroi</a>'s 46,000 troops were expected to pin the 70,000 Dutch and English troops around <a href="Maastricht">Maastricht</a> in the Low Countries, while General <a href="Robert%20Jean%20Antoine%20de%20Franquetot%20de%20Coigny">de Coigny</a> protected <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a> against surprise with a further corps. The only forces immediately available for Vienna's defence were <a href="Louis%20William%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Baden-Baden">Prince Louis of Baden's</a> force of 36,000 stationed in the <a href="Lines%20of%20Stollhofen">Lines of Stollhofen</a> to watch Marshal Tallard at Strasbourg; there was also a weak force of 10,000 men under <a href="Hermann%20Otto%20II%20of%20Limburg%20Stirum">Field Marshal Count Limburg Styrum</a> observing <a href="Ulm">Ulm</a>.

Both the Imperial Austrian Ambassador in London, <a href="John%20Wenceslau%20Wratislaw%20von%20Mitrowitz">Count Wratislaw</a>, and the Duke of Marlborough realised the implications of the situation on the Danube. The Dutch, however, who clung to their troops for their country's protection, were against any adventurous military operation as far south as the Danube and would never willingly permit any major weakening of the forces in the <a href="Spanish%20Netherlands">Spanish Netherlands</a>. Marlborough, realising the only way to ignore Dutch wishes was by the use of secrecy and guile, set out to deceive his Dutch allies by pretending to simply move his troops to the <a href="Moselle%20%28river%29">Moselle</a> – a plan approved of by <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> – but once there, he would slip the Dutch leash and link up with Austrian forces in southern Germany. "My intentions", wrote the Duke from The Hague on 29 April to his governmental confidant, <a href="Sidney%20Godolphin%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Godolphin">Sidney Godolphin</a>, "are to march with the English to <a href="Koblenz">Coblenz</a> and declare that I intend to campaign on the Moselle. But when I come there, to write to the Dutch States that I think it absolutely necessary for the saving of the Empire to march with the troops under my command and to join with those that are in Germany ... in order to make measures with Prince Lewis of Baden for the speedy reduction of the Elector of Bavaria."

Marlborough's march started on 19 May from Bedburg, north-west of Cologne. The army (assembled by the Duke's brother, General <a href="Charles%20Churchill%20%28British%20Army%20general%29">Charles Churchill</a>) consisted of 66 <a href="Squadron%20%28cavalry%29">squadrons</a>, 31 <a href="battalions">battalions</a> and 38 guns and mortars totalling 21,000 men (16,000 of whom were <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">English</a> troops). This force was to be augmented "en route" such that by the time Marlborough reached the Danube, it would number 40,000 (47 battalions, 88 squadrons). Whilst Marlborough led his army, <a href="Henry%20de%20Nassau%2C%20Lord%20Overkirk">General Overkirk</a> would maintain a defensive position in the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a> in case Villeroi mounted an attack. The Duke had assured the Dutch that if the French were to launch an offensive he would return in good time, but Marlborough calculated that as he marched south, the French commander would be drawn after him. In this assumption Marlborough proved correct: Villeroi shadowed the Duke with 30,000 men in 60 squadrons and 42 battalions.

The military dangers in such an enterprise were numerous: Marlborough's lines of communication along the Rhine would be hopelessly exposed to French interference, for Louis' generals controlled the left bank of the river and its central reaches. Such a long march would almost certainly involve a high wastage of men and horses through exhaustion and disease. However, Marlborough was convinced of the urgency – "I am very sensible that I take a great deal upon me", he had earlier written to Godolphin, "but should I act otherwise, the Empire would be undone ..."
Whilst Allied preparations had progressed, the French were striving to maintain and re-supply Marshal Marsin. Marsin had been operating with the Elector of Bavaria against the Imperial commander, Prince Louis of Baden, and was somewhat isolated from France: his only lines of communication lay through the rocky passes of the Black Forest. However, on 14 May, with considerable skill Marshal Tallard managed to bring 10,000 reinforcements and vast supplies and munitions through the difficult terrain, whilst outmanoeuvring Baron Thüngen, the Imperial general who sought to block his path. Tallard then returned with his own force to the Rhine, once again side-stepping Thüngen's efforts to intercept him. The whole operation was an outstanding military achievement.

On 26 May, Marlborough reached Coblenz, where the Moselle meets the Rhine. If he intended an attack along the Moselle the Duke must now turn west, but, instead, the following day the army crossed to the right bank of the Rhine, (pausing to add 5,000 waiting <a href="Hanoverians">Hanoverians</a> and <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>ns). "There will be no campaign on the Moselle", wrote Villeroi who had taken up a defensive position on the river, "the English have all gone up into Germany." A second possible objective now occurred to the French – an Allied incursion into Alsace and an attack on the city of <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>. Marlborough skillfully encouraged this apprehension by constructing bridges across the Rhine at <a href="Philippsburg">Philippsburg</a>, a ruse that not only encouraged Villeroi to come to Tallard's aid in the defence of Alsace, but one that ensured the French plan to march on Vienna remained paralysed by uncertainty.

With Villeroi shadowing Marlborough's every move, Marlborough's gamble that the French would not move against the weakened Dutch position in the Netherlands paid off. In any case, Marlborough had promised to return to the Netherlands if a French attack developed there, transferring his troops down the Rhine on barges at a rate of a day. Encouraged by this promise (whatever it was worth) the <a href="States%20General%20of%20the%20Netherlands">States General</a> agreed to release the Danish contingent of seven battalions and 22 squadrons as a reinforcement. Marlborough reached <a href="Ladenburg">Ladenburg</a>, in the plain of the Neckar and the Rhine, and there halted for three days to rest his cavalry and allow the guns and infantry to close up. On 6 June he arrived at <a href="Wiesloch">Wiesloch</a>, south of <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a>. The following day, the Allied army swung away from the Rhine towards the hills of the <a href="Swabian%20Jura">Swabian Jura</a> and the Danube beyond. At last Marlborough's destination was established without doubt.

On 10 June, the Duke met for the first time the President of the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Council">Imperial War Council</a>, Prince Eugene – accompanied by Count Wratislaw – at the village of <a href="Mundelsheim">Mundelsheim</a>, halfway between the Danube and the Rhine. By 13 June, the Imperial Field Commander, Prince Louis of Baden, had joined them in <a href="Weinstadt">Großheppach</a>. The three generals commanded a force of nearly 110,000 men. At conference it was decided that Eugene would return with 28,000 men to the Lines of Stollhofen on the Rhine to keep an eye on Villeroi and Tallard and prevent them going to the aid of the Franco-Bavarian army on the Danube. Meanwhile, Marlborough's and Baden's forces would combine, totalling 80,000 men, for the march on the Danube to seek out the Elector and Marsin before they could be reinforced.

Knowing Marlborough's destination, Tallard and Villeroi met at <a href="Landau">Landau</a> in the Palatinate on 13 June to rapidly construct a plan to save Bavaria but the rigidity of the French command system was such that any variations from the original plan had to be sanctioned by <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Versailles</a>. The <a href="Jean-Philippe-Eug%C3%A8ne%20de%20M%C3%A9rode-Westerloo">Count of Mérode-Westerloo</a>, commander of the <a href="Flemish%20people">Flemish</a> troops in Tallard's army wrote – "One thing is certain: we delayed our march from Alsace for far too long and quite inexplicably." Approval from <a href="King%20Louis%20XIV">Louis</a> arrived on 27 June: Tallard was to reinforce Marsin and the Elector on the Danube via the Black Forest, with 40 battalions and 50 squadrons; Villeroi was to pin down the Allies defending the Lines of Stollhofen, or, if the Allies should move all their forces to the Danube, he was to join with Marshal Tallard; and General de Coignies with 8,000 men, would protect Alsace. On 1 July Tallard's army of 35,000 re-crossed the Rhine at <a href="Kehl">Kehl</a> and began its march.

On 22 June, Marlborough's forces linked up with Baden's Imperial forces at Launsheim. A distance of had been covered in five weeks. Thanks to a carefully planned time-table, the effects of wear and tear had been kept to a minimum. Captain Parker described the march discipline – "As we marched through the country of our Allies, commissars were appointed to furnish us with all manner of necessaries for man and horse ... the soldiers had nothing to do but pitch their tents, boil kettles and lie down to rest." In response to Marlborough's manoeuvres, the Elector and Marsin, conscious of their numerical disadvantage with only 40,000 men, moved their forces to the entrenched camp at <a href="Dillingen%20an%20der%20Donau">Dillingen</a> on the north bank of the Danube. Marlborough could not attack Dillingen because of a lack of siege guns – he was unable to bring any from the Low Countries, and Baden had failed to supply any despite assurances to the contrary.
The Allies, nevertheless, needed a base for provisions and a good river crossing. On 2 July, therefore, Marlborough at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Schellenberg">Battle of Schellenberg</a> stormed the fortress of Schellenberg on the heights above the town of <a href="Donauw%C3%B6rth">Donauwörth</a>. <a href="Jean%20Baptist%2C%20Comte%20d%27Arco">Count Jean d'Arco</a> had been sent with 12,000 men from the Franco-Bavarian camp to hold the town and grassy hill but after a ferocious and bloody battle, inflicting enormous casualties on both sides, Schellenberg finally succumbed, forcing Donauwörth to surrender shortly afterwards. The Elector, knowing his position at Dillingen was now not tenable, took up a position behind the strong fortifications of <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a>.

Tallard's march presented a dilemma for Eugene. If the Allies were not to be outnumbered on the Danube, Eugene realised he must either try to cut Tallard off before he could get there or he must hasten to reinforce Marlborough. if he withdrew from the Rhine to the Danube, Villeroi might also make a move south to link up with the Elector and Marsin. Eugene compromised: leaving 12,000 troops behind guarding the Lines of Stollhofen, he marched off with the rest of his army to forestall Tallard.

Lacking in numbers, Eugene could not seriously disrupt Tallard's march but the French Marshal's progress was proving pitifully slow. Tallard's force had suffered considerably more than Marlborough's troops on their march – many of his cavalry horses were suffering from <a href="glanders">glanders</a> and the mountain passes were proving tough for the 2,000 wagons of provisions. Local German peasants, angry at French plundering, compounded Tallard's problems, leading Mérode-Westerloo to bemoan – "the enraged peasantry killed several thousand of our men before the army was clear of the Black Forest." Tallard had insisted on besieging the little town of <a href="Villingen">Villingen</a> for six days (16–22 July) but abandoned the enterprise on discovering the approach of Eugene.

The Elector in Augsburg was informed on 14 July that Tallard was on his way through the Black Forest. This good news bolstered the Elector's policy of inaction, further encouraging him to wait for the reinforcements. But this reticence to fight induced Marlborough to undertake a controversial policy of spoliation in Bavaria, burning buildings and crops throughout the rich lands south of the Danube. This had two aims: firstly to put pressure on the Elector to fight or come to terms before Tallard arrived with reinforcements; and secondly, to ruin Bavaria as a base from which the French and Bavarian armies could attack Vienna, or pursue the Duke into <a href="Franconia">Franconia</a> if, at some stage, he had to withdraw northwards. But this destruction, coupled with a protracted siege of <a href="Rain%20%28Lech%29">Rain</a> (9–16 July), caused Prince Eugene to lament "... since the Donauwörth action I cannot admire their performances", and later to conclude "If he has to go home without having achieved his objective, he will certainly be ruined." Nevertheless, strategically the Duke had been able to place his numerically stronger forces between the Franco-Bavarian army and Vienna.

Marshal Tallard, with 34,000 men, reached Ulm, joining with the Elector and Marsin in Augsburg on 5 August (although Tallard was not impressed to find that the Elector had dispersed his army in response to Marlborough's campaign of ravaging the region). Also on 5 August, Eugene reached <a href="H%C3%B6chst%C3%A4dt%20an%20der%20Donau">Höchstädt</a>, riding that same night to meet with Marlborough at <a href="Schrobenhausen">Schrobenhausen</a>. Marlborough knew it was necessary that another crossing point over the Danube would be required in case Donauwörth fell to the enemy. On 7 August, therefore, the first of Baden's 15,000 Imperial troops (the remainder following two days later) left Marlborough's main force to besiege the heavily defended city of <a href="Ingolstadt">Ingolstadt</a>, farther down the Danube.

With Eugene's forces at Höchstädt on the north bank of the Danube, and Marlborough's at Rain on the south bank, Tallard and the Elector debated their next move. Tallard preferred to bide his time, replenish supplies and allow Marlborough's Danube campaign to flounder in the colder weeks of Autumn; the Elector and Marsin, however, newly reinforced, were keen to push ahead. The French and Bavarian commanders eventually agreed on a plan and decided to attack Eugene's smaller force. On 9 August, the Franco-Bavarian forces began to cross to the north bank of the Danube.

On 10 August, Eugene sent an urgent dispatch reporting that he was falling back to Donauwörth – "The enemy have marched. It is almost certain that the whole army is crossing the Danube at <a href="Lauingen">Lauingen</a> ... The plain of Dillingen is crowded with troops ... Everything, milord, consists in speed and that you put yourself forthwith in movement to join me tomorrow, without which I fear it will be too late." By a series of brilliant marches Marlborough concentrated his forces on Donauwörth and, by noon 11 August, the link-up was complete.

During 11 August, Tallard pushed forward from the river crossings at Dillingen; by 12 August, the Franco-Bavarian forces were encamped behind the small river Nebel near the village of Blenheim on the plain of Höchstädt. That same day Marlborough and Eugene carried out their own reconnaissance of the French position from the church spire at <a href="Tapfheim">Tapfheim</a>, and moved their combined forces to Münster – from the French camp. A French reconnaissance under the Marquis de Silly went forward to probe the enemy, but were driven off by Allied troops who had deployed to cover the pioneers of the advancing army, labouring to bridge the numerous streams in the area and improve the passage leading westwards to Höchstädt. Marlborough quickly moved forward two brigades under the command of General Wilkes and Brigadier Rowe to secure the narrow strip of land between the Danube and the wooded Fuchsberg hill, at the <a href="Schwenningen%2C%20Bavaria">Schwenningen</a> defile.

Tallard's army numbered 56,000 men and 90 guns; the army of the <a href="Grand%20Alliance%20%28League%20of%20Augsburg%29">Grand Alliance</a>, 52,000 men and 66 guns. Some Allied officers who were acquainted with the superior numbers of the enemy, and aware of their strong defensive position, ventured to remonstrate with Marlborough about the hazards of attacking; but the Duke was resolute – "I know the danger, yet a battle is absolutely necessary, and I rely on the bravery and discipline of the troops, which will make amends for our disadvantages". Marlborough and Eugene decided to risk everything, and agreed to attack on the following day.

The battlefield stretched for nearly . The extreme right flank of the Franco-Bavarian army was covered by the Danube; to the extreme left flank lay the undulating pine-covered hills of the Swabian Jura. A small stream, the Nebel, (the ground either side of which was soft and marshy and only fordable intermittently), fronted the French line. The French right rested on the village of Blenheim near where the Nebel flows into the Danube; the village itself was surrounded by hedges, fences, enclosed gardens, and meadows. Between Blenheim and the next village of <a href="H%C3%B6chst%C3%A4dt%20an%20der%20Donau">Oberglauheim</a> the fields of wheat had been cut to stubble and were now ideal to deploy troops. From Oberglauheim to the next hamlet of Lutzingen the terrain of ditches, thickets and brambles was potentially difficult ground for the attackers.

At 02:00 on 13 August, 40 squadrons were sent forward towards the enemy, followed at 03:00, in eight columns, by the main Allied force pushing over the Kessel. At about 06:00 they reached Schwenningen, from Blenheim. The English and German troops who had held Schwenningen through the night joined the march, making a ninth column on the left of the army. Marlborough and Eugene made their final plans. The Allied commanders agreed that Marlborough would command 36,000 troops and attack Tallard's force of 33,000 on the left (including capturing the village of Blenheim), whilst Eugene, commanding 16,000 men would attack the Elector and Marsin's combined forces of 23,000 troops on the right wing; if this attack was pressed hard the Elector and Marsin would have no troops to send to aid Tallard on their right. <a href="John%20Cutts%2C%201st%20Baron%20Cutts">Lieutenant-General John Cutts</a> would attack Blenheim in concert with Eugene's attack. With the French flanks busy, Marlborough could cross the Nebel and deliver the fatal blow to the French at their centre. However, Marlborough would have to wait until Eugene was in position before the general engagement could begin.

The last thing Tallard expected that morning was to be attacked by the Allies – deceived by intelligence gathered from prisoners taken by de Silly the previous day, and assured in their strong natural position, Tallard and his colleagues were convinced that Marlborough and Eugene were about to retreat north-eastwards towards <a href="N%C3%B6rdlingen">Nördlingen</a>. Tallard wrote a report to this effect to King Louis that morning, but hardly had he sent the messenger when the Allied army began to appear opposite his camp. "I could see the enemy advancing ever closer in nine great columns", wrote Mérode-Westerloo, " ... filling the whole plain from the Danube to the woods on the horizon." Signal guns were fired to bring in the foraging parties and <a href="picket%20%28military%29">picquets</a> as the French and Bavarian troops tried to draw into battle-order to face the unexpected threat.

At about 08:00 the French artillery on their right wing opened fire, answered by <a href="Holcroft%20Blood">Colonel Blood</a>'s <a href="Artillery%20battery">batteries</a>. The guns were heard by Baden in his camp before Ingolstadt, "The Prince and the Duke are engaged today to the westward", he wrote to the Emperor. "Heaven bless them." An hour later Tallard, the Elector, and Marsin climbed Blenheim's church tower to finalise their plans. It was settled that the Elector and Marsin would hold the front from the hills to Oberglauheim, whilst Tallard would defend the ground between Oberglauheim and the Danube. The French commanders were, however, divided as to how to utilise the Nebel: Tallard's tactic – opposed by Marsin and the Elector who felt it better to close their infantry right up to the stream itself – was to lure the allies across before unleashing their cavalry upon them, causing panic and confusion; whilst the enemy was struggling in the marshes, they would be caught in crossfire from Blenheim and Oberglauheim. The plan was sound if all its parts were implemented, but it allowed Marlborough to cross the Nebel without serious interference and fight the battle he had in mind.

The Franco-Bavarian commanders deployed their forces. In the village of Lutzingen, Count Maffei positioned five Bavarian battalions with a great battery of 16 guns at the village's edge. In the woods to the left of Lutzingen, seven French battalions under the Marquis de Rozel moved into place. Between Lutzingen and Oberglauheim the Elector placed 27 squadrons of cavalry – Count d'Arco commanded 14 Bavarian squadrons and Count Wolframsdorf had 13 more in support nearby. To their right stood Marsin's 40 French squadrons and 12 battalions. The village of Oberglauheim was packed with 14 battalions commanded by the Marquis de Blainville (including the effective Irish Brigade known as the '<a href="Flight%20of%20the%20Wild%20Geese">Wild Geese</a>'). Six batteries of guns were ranged alongside the village. On the right of these French and Bavarian positions, between Oberglauheim and Blenheim, Tallard deployed 64 French and Walloon squadrons (16 drawn from Marsin) supported by nine French battalions standing near the Höchstädt road. In the cornfield next to Blenheim stood three battalions from the Regiment de Roi. Nine battalions occupied the village itself, commanded by the Marquis de Clérambault. Four battalions stood to the rear and a further 11 were in reserve. These battalions were supported by Hautefeuille's 12 squadrons of dismounted dragoons. By 11:00 Tallard, the Elector, and Marsin were in place. Many of the Allied generals were hesitant to attack such a relatively strong position. The <a href="George%20Douglas-Hamilton%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Orkney">Earl of Orkney</a> later confessed that, "had I been asked to give my opinion, I had been against it."

Prince Eugene was expected to be in position by 11:00, but due to the difficult terrain and enemy fire, progress was slow. Lord Cutts' column – who by 10:00 had expelled the enemy from two water mills upon the Nebel – had already deployed by the river against Blenheim, enduring over the next three hours severe fire from a heavy six-gun battery posted near the village. The rest of Marlborough's army, waiting in their ranks on the forward slope, were also forced to bear the cannonade from the French artillery, suffering 2,000 casualties before the attack could even start. Meanwhile, engineers repaired a stone bridge across the Nebel, and constructed five additional bridges or causeways across the marsh between Blenheim and Oberglauheim. Marlborough's anxiety was finally allayed when, just past noon, <a href="William%20Cadogan%2C%201st%20Earl%20Cadogan">Colonel Cadogan</a> reported that Eugene's <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussian</a> and <a href="Denmark">Danish</a> infantry were in place – the order for the general advance was given. At 13:00, Cutts was ordered to attack the village of Blenheim whilst Prince Eugene was requested to assault Lutzingen on the Allied right flank.

Cutts ordered Brigadier-General Archibald Rowe's brigade to attack. The English infantry rose from the edge of the Nebel, and silently marched towards Blenheim, a distance of some . John Ferguson's Scottish brigade supported Rowe's left, and moved in perfect order towards the barricades between the village and the river, defended by Hautefeuille's dragoons. As the range closed to within , the French fired a deadly volley. Rowe had ordered that there should be no firing from his men until he struck his sword upon the <a href="palisade">palisade</a>s, but as he stepped forward to give the signal, he fell mortally wounded. The survivors of the leading companies closed up the gaps in their torn ranks and rushed forward. Small parties penetrated the defences, but repeated French volleys forced the English back towards the Nebel, sustaining heavy casualties. As the attack faltered, eight squadrons of elite Gens d'Armes, commanded by the veteran Swiss officer, Beat-Jacques von Zurlauben, fell upon the English troops, cutting at the exposed flank of <a href="Royal%20Scots%20Fusiliers">Rowe's own regiment</a>. However, Wilkes' <a href="Hesse">Hessian</a> brigade, lying nearby in the marshy grass at the water's edge, stood firm and repulsed the Gens d'Armes with steady fire, enabling the English and Hessians to re-order and launch another attack.

Although the Allies were again repulsed, these persistent attacks on Blenheim eventually bore fruit, panicking Clérambault into making the worst French error of the day. Without consulting Tallard, Clérambault ordered his reserve battalions into the village, upsetting the balance of the French position and nullifying the French numerical superiority. "The men were so crowded in upon one another", wrote Mérode-Westerloo, "that they couldn't even fire – let alone receive or carry out any orders." Marlborough, spotting this error, now countermanded Cutts' intention to launch a third attack, and ordered him simply to contain the enemy within Blenheim; no more than 5,000 Allied soldiers were able to pen in twice the number of French infantry and dragoons.

On the Allied right, Eugene's Prussian and Danish forces were desperately fighting the numerically superior forces of the Elector and Marsin. The <a href="Leopold%20I%2C%20Prince%20of%20Anhalt-Dessau">Prince of Anhalt-Dessau</a> led forward four brigades across the Nebel to assault the well-fortified position of Lutzingen. Here, the Nebel was less of an obstacle, but the great battery positioned on the edge of the village enjoyed a good field of fire across the open ground stretching to the hamlet of Schwennenbach. As soon as the infantry crossed the stream, they were struck by Maffei's infantry, and salvoes from the Bavarian guns positioned both in front of the village and in <a href="Enfilade%20and%20defilade">enfilade</a> on the wood-line to the right. Despite heavy casualties the Prussians attempted to storm the great battery, whilst the Danes, under Count Scholten, attempted to drive the French infantry out of the copses beyond the village.

With the infantry heavily engaged, Eugene's cavalry picked its way across the Nebel. After an initial success, his first line of cavalry, under the Imperial General of Horse, <a href="Maximilian%20Wilhelm%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Prince Maximilian of Hanover</a>, were pressed by the second line of Marsin's cavalry, and were forced back across the Nebel in confusion. Nevertheless, the exhausted French were unable to follow up their advantage, and the two cavalry forces tried to regroup and reorder their ranks. However, without cavalry support, and threatened with envelopment, the Prussian and Danish infantry were in turn forced to pull back across the Nebel. Panic gripped some of Eugene's troops as they crossed the stream. Ten infantry colours were lost to the Bavarians, and hundreds of prisoners taken; it was only through the leadership of Eugene and the Prussian Prince that the imperial infantry were prevented from abandoning the field.

After rallying his troops near Schwennenbach – well beyond their starting point – Eugene prepared to launch a second attack, led by the second-line squadrons under the <a href="Eberhard%20Ludwig%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Duke of Württemberg-Teck</a>. Yet again they were caught in the murderous cross-fire from the artillery in Lutzingen and Oberglauheim, and were once again thrown back in disarray. The French and Bavarians, however, were almost as disordered as their opponents, and they too were in need of inspiration from their commander, the Elector, who was seen – " ... riding up and down, and inspiring his men with fresh courage." Anhalt-Dessau's Danish and Prussian infantry attacked a second time but could not sustain the advance without proper support. Once again they fell back across the stream.

Whilst these events around Blenheim and Lutzingen were taking place, Marlborough was preparing to cross the Nebel. The centre, commanded by the Duke's brother, General Charles Churchill, consisted of 18 battalions of infantry arranged in two lines: seven battalions in the front line to secure a foothold across the Nebel, and 11 battalions in the rear providing cover from the Allied side of the stream. Between the infantry were placed two lines, 72 squadrons of cavalry. The first line of foot was to pass the stream first and march as far to the other side as could be conveniently done. This line would then form and cover the passage of the horse, leaving gaps in the line of infantry large enough for the cavalry to pass through and take their position in front.

Marlborough ordered the formation forward. Once again Zurlauben's Gens d'Armes charged, looking to rout <a href="Henry%20Lumley">Lumley</a>'s English cavalry who linked Cutts' column facing Blenheim with Churchill's infantry. As these elite French cavalry attacked, they were faced by five English squadrons under Colonel Francis Palmes. To the consternation of the French, the Gens d'Armes were pushed back in terrible confusion, pursued well beyond the Maulweyer stream that flows through Blenheim. "What? Is it possible?" exclaimed the Elector, "the gentlemen of France fleeing?" Palmes, however, attempted to follow up his success but was repulsed in some confusion by other French cavalry, and musketry fire from the edge of Blenheim.

Nevertheless, Tallard was alarmed by the repulse of the elite Gens d'Armes and urgently rode across the field to ask Marsin for reinforcements; but on the basis of being hard pressed by Eugene – whose second attack was in full flood – Marsin refused. As Tallard consulted with Marsin, more of his infantry was being taken into Blenheim by Clérambault. Fatally, Tallard, aware of the situation, did nothing to rectify this grave mistake, leaving him with just the nine battalions of infantry near the Höchstädt road
to oppose the massed enemy ranks in the centre. Zurlauben tried several more times to disrupt the Allies forming on Tallard's side of the stream; his front-line cavalry darting forward down the gentle slope towards the Nebel. But the attacks lacked co-ordination, and the Allied infantry's steady volleys disconcerted the French horsemen. During these skirmishes Zurlauben fell mortally wounded, and died two days later. The time was just after 15:00.

The Danish cavalry, under the <a href="Carl%20Rudolf%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg-Neuenstadt">Duke of Württemberg-Neuenstadt</a> (not to be confused with the Duke of Württemberg who fought with Eugene), had made slow work of crossing the Nebel near Oberglau; harassed by Marsin's infantry near the village, the Danes were driven back across the stream. Count Horn's Dutch infantry managed to push the French back from the water's edge, but it was apparent that before Marlborough could launch his main effort against Tallard, Oberglauheim would have to be secured.

Count Horn directed the <a href="Anton%20G%C3%BCnther%2C%20Prince%20of%20Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck">Prince of Holstein-Beck</a> to take the village, but his two Dutch brigades were cut down by the French and Irish troops, capturing and badly wounding the Prince during the action. The battle was now in the balance. If Holstein-Beck's Dutch column were destroyed, the Allied army would be split in two: Eugene's wing would be isolated from Marlborough's, passing the initiative to the Franco-Bavarian forces now engaged across the whole plain. Seeing the opportunity, Marsin ordered his cavalry to change from facing Eugene, and turn towards their right and the open flank of Churchill's infantry drawn up in front of Unterglau. Marlborough (who had crossed the Nebel on a makeshift bridge to take personal control), ordered Hulsen's Hanoverian battalions to support the Dutch infantry. A Dutch cavalry brigade under Averock was also called forward but soon came under pressure from Marsin's more numerous squadrons.

Marlborough now requested Eugene to release Count Hendrick Fugger and his Imperial Cuirassier brigade to help repel the French cavalry thrust. Despite his own desperate struggle, the Imperial Prince at once complied, demonstrating the high degree of confidence and mutual co-operation between the two generals. Although the Nebel stream lay between Fugger's and Marsin's squadrons, the French were forced to change front to meet this new threat, thus forestalling the chance for Marsin to strike at Marlborough's infantry. Fugger's <a href="cuirassiers">cuirassiers</a> charged and, striking at a favourable angle, threw back Marsin's squadrons in disorder. With support from Colonel Blood's batteries, the Hessian, Hanoverian and Dutch infantry – now commanded by Count Berensdorf – succeeded in pushing the French and Irish infantry back into Oberglauheim so that they could not again threaten Churchill's flank as he moved against Tallard. The French commander in the village, the Marquis de Blainville, numbered amongst the heavy casualties.

By 16:00, with the Franco-Bavarian troops besieged in Blenheim and Oberglau, the Allied centre of 81 squadrons (nine squadrons had been transferred from Cutts' column), supported by 18 battalions was firmly planted amidst the French line of 64 squadrons and nine battalions of raw recruits. There was now a pause in the battle: Marlborough wanted to concert the attack upon the whole front, and Eugene, after his second repulse, needed time to reorganize.

Just after 17:00 all was ready along the Allied front. Marlborough's two lines of cavalry had now moved to the front of the Duke's line of battle, with the two supporting lines of infantry behind them. <a href="Jean-Philippe-Eug%C3%A8ne%20de%20M%C3%A9rode-Westerloo">Mérode-Westerloo</a> attempted to extricate some French infantry crowded in Blenheim, but Clérambault ordered the troops back into the village. The French cavalry exerted themselves once more against the first line – Lumley's English and Scots on the Allied left, and Hompesch's Dutch and German squadrons on the Allied right. Tallard's squadrons, lacking infantry support, were tired and ragged but managed to push the Allied first line back to their infantry support. With the battle still not won, Marlborough had to rebuke one of his cavalry officers who was attempting to leave the field – "Sir, you are under a mistake, the enemy lies that way ..." Now, at the Duke's command, the second Allied line under Cuno Josua von Bülow and Bothmer was ordered forward, and, driving through the centre, the Allies finally put Tallard's tired horse to rout, not without cost. The Prussian Life Dragoons' Colonel, Ludwig <a href="von%20Blumenthal">von Blumenthal</a>, and his 2nd in command, Lt. Col. <a href="von%20Hacke">von Hacke</a>, fell next to each other. But the charge succeeded and with their cavalry in headlong flight, the remaining nine French infantry battalions fought with desperate valour, trying to form square. But it was futile. The French battalions were overwhelmed by Colonel Blood's close-range artillery and platoon fire. Mérode-Westerloo later wrote – "[They] died to a man where they stood, stationed right out in the open plain – supported by nobody."

The majority of Tallard's retreating troops headed for Höchstädt but most did not make the safety of the town, plunging instead into the Danube where upwards of 3,000 French horsemen drowned; others were cut down by the pursuing cavalry. The Marquis de Gruignan attempted a counter-attack, but he was easily brushed aside by the triumphant Allies. After a final rally behind his camp's tents, shouting entreaties to stand and fight, Marshal Tallard was caught up in the rout and pushed towards Sonderheim. Surrounded by a squadron of <a href="Hesse">Hessian</a> troops, Tallard surrendered to Lieutenant-Colonel de Boinenburg, the <a href="Frederick%20I%20of%20Sweden">Prince of Hesse-Kassel</a>'s "<a href="aide-de-camp">aide-de-camp</a>", and was sent under escort to Marlborough. The Duke welcomed the French commander – "I am very sorry that such a cruel misfortune should have fallen upon a soldier for whom I have the highest regard." With salutes and courtesies, the Marshal was escorted to Marlborough's coach.

Meanwhile, the Allies had once again attacked the Bavarian stronghold at Lutzingen.
Eugene, however, became exasperated with the performance of his Imperial cavalry whose third attack had failed: he had already shot two of his troopers to prevent a general flight. Then, declaring in disgust that he wished to "fight among brave men and not among cowards", Eugene went into the attack with the Prussian and Danish infantry, as did the Dessauer, waving a regimental colour to inspire his troops. This time the Prussians were able to storm the great Bavarian battery, and overwhelm the guns' crews. Beyond the village, Scholten's Danes defeated the French infantry in a desperate hand-to-hand bayonet struggle. When they saw that the centre had broken, the Elector and Marsin decided the battle was lost and, like the remnants of Tallard's army, fled the battlefield (albeit in better order than Tallard's men). Attempts to organise an Allied force to prevent Marsin's withdrawal failed owing to the exhaustion of the cavalry, and the growing confusion in the field.
Marlborough now had to turn his attention from the fleeing enemy to direct Churchill to detach more infantry to storm Blenheim. Orkney's infantry, Hamilton's English brigade and St Paul's Hanoverians moved across the trampled wheat to the cottages. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting gradually forced the French towards the village centre, in and around the walled churchyard which had been prepared for defence. Hay and Ross's dismounted dragoons were also sent, but suffered under a counter-charge delivered by the regiments of Artois and Provence under command of Colonel de la Silvière. Colonel Belville's Hanoverians were fed into the battle to steady the resolve of the dragoons, and once more went to the attack. The Allied progress was slow and hard, and like the defenders, they suffered many casualties.

Many of the cottages were now burning, obscuring the field of fire and driving the defenders out of their positions. Hearing the din of battle in Blenheim, Tallard sent a message to Marlborough offering to order the garrison to withdraw from the field.
"Inform Monsieur Tallard", replied the Duke, "that, in the position in which he is now, he has no command." Nevertheless, as dusk came the Allied commander was anxious for a quick conclusion. The French infantry fought tenaciously to hold on to their position in Blenheim, but their commander was nowhere to be found. Clérambault's insistence on confining his huge force in the village was to seal his fate that day. Realising his tactical mistake had contributed to Tallard's defeat in the centre, Clérambault deserted Blenheim and the 27 battalions defending the village, and reportedly drowned in the Danube while attempting to make his escape.

By now Blenheim was under assault from every side by three British generals: Cutts, Churchill, and Orkney. The French had repulsed every attack with heavy slaughter, but many had seen what had happened on the plain and what its consequences to them would be; their army was routed and they were cut off. Orkney, attacking from the rear, now tried a different tactic – "... it came into my head to beat parley", he later wrote, "which they accepted of and immediately their Brigadier de Nouville capitulated with me to be prisoner at discretion and lay down their arms." Threatened by Allied guns, other units followed their example. However, it was not until 21:00 that the Marquis de Blanzac, who had taken charge in Clérambault's absence, reluctantly accepted the inevitability of defeat, and some 10,000 of France's best infantry had laid down their arms.

During these events Marlborough was still in the saddle conducting the pursuit of the broken enemy. Pausing for a moment he scribbled on the back of an old tavern bill a note addressed to his wife, <a href="Sarah%20Churchill%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Marlborough">Sarah</a>: "I have no time to say more but to beg you will give my duty to the Queen, and let her know her army has had a glorious victory."

French losses were immense, with over 27,000 killed, wounded and captured. Moreover, the myth of French invincibility had been destroyed and Louis's hopes of an early and victorious peace had been wrenched from his grasp. Mérode-Westerloo summarised the case against Tallard's army: "The French lost this battle for a wide variety of reasons. For one thing they had too good an opinion of their own ability ... Another point was their faulty field dispositions, and in addition there was rampant indiscipline and inexperience displayed ... It took all these faults to lose so celebrated a battle." It was a hard-fought contest, leading Prince Eugene to observe – "I have not a squadron or battalion which did not charge four times at least." Although the war dragged on for years, the Battle of Blenheim was probably its most decisive victory; Marlborough and Eugene, working indivisibly together, had saved the Habsburg Empire and thereby preserved the Grand Alliance from collapse. <a href="Munich">Munich</a>, Augsburg, Ingolstadt, Ulm and all remaining territory of Bavaria soon fell to the Allies. By the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Ilbersheim">Treaty of Ilbersheim</a>, signed 7 November 1704, Bavaria was placed under Austrian military rule, allowing the Habsburgs to utilise its resources for the rest of the conflict.

The remnants of the <a href="Maximilian%20II%20Emanuel%2C%20elector%20of%20Bavaria">Elector of Bavaria's</a> and Marshal Marsin's wing limped back to Strasbourg, losing another 7,000 men through desertion. Despite being offered the chance to remain as ruler of Bavaria (under strict terms of an alliance with Austria), the Elector left his country and family in order to continue the war against the Allies from the Spanish Netherlands where he still held the post of governor-general. Their commander-in-chief that day, Marshal Tallard – who, unlike his subordinates, had not been ransomed or exchanged – was taken to England and imprisoned in <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> until his release in 1711.

The 1704 campaign lasted considerably longer than usual as the Allies sought to wring out maximum advantage. Realising that France was too powerful to be forced to make peace by a single victory, however, Eugene, Marlborough and Baden met to plan their next moves. For the following year the Duke proposed a campaign along the valley of the River Moselle to carry the war deep into France. This required the capture of the major fortress of Landau which guarded the Rhine, and the towns of Trier and Trarbach on the Moselle itself. Trier was taken on 27 October and Landau fell on 23 November to the Margrave of Baden and Prince Eugene; with the fall of Trarbach on 20 December, the campaign season for 1704 came to an end.

Marlborough returned to England on 14 December (<a href="Old%20Style%20and%20New%20Style%20dates">O.S</a>) to the acclamation of <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a> and the country. In the first days of January the 110 cavalry standards and the 128 infantry colours that were taken during the battle were borne in procession to <a href="Westminster%20Hall">Westminster Hall</a>. In February 1705, Queen Anne, who had made Marlborough a Duke in 1702, granted him the <a href="Woodstock%2C%20Oxfordshire">Park of Woodstock</a> and promised a sum of £240,000 to build <a href="Blenheim%20Palace">a suitable house</a> as a gift from a grateful crown in recognition of his victory – a victory which British historian Sir <a href="Edward%20Shepherd%20Creasy">Edward Shepherd Creasy</a> considered one of the pivotal battles in history, writing – "Had it not been for Blenheim, all Europe might at this day suffer under the effect of French conquests resembling those of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander</a> in extent and those of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Romans</a> in durability."

Battle of Ramillies

The Battle of Ramillies (), fought on 23 May 1706, was a battle of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>. For the <a href="Grand%20Alliance%20%28League%20of%20Augsburg%29">Grand Alliance</a> – Austria, England, and the Dutch Republic – the battle had followed an indecisive campaign against the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbon</a> armies of King <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV of France</a> in 1705. Although the Allies had <a href="Siege%20of%20Barcelona%20%281705%29">captured Barcelona</a> that year, they had been forced to abandon their campaign on the <a href="Moselle%20River">Moselle</a>, had stalled in the <a href="Spanish%20Netherlands">Spanish Netherlands</a> and suffered defeat in northern Italy. Yet despite his opponents' setbacks Louis XIV was desirous of peace – but he wanted it on reasonable terms. For this end and in order to maintain their momentum, the French and their allies took the offensive in 1706.

The campaign began well for Louis XIV's generals: in Italy Marshal <a href="Louis%20Joseph%2C%20Duke%20of%20Vend%C3%B4me">Vendôme</a> had defeated the Austrians at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Calcinato">Battle of Calcinato</a> in April, while in <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a> Marshal <a href="Claude%20Louis%20Hector%20de%20Villars">Villars</a> had forced the <a href="Louis%20William%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Baden-Baden">Margrave of Baden</a> back across the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a>. Encouraged by these early gains Louis XIV urged Marshal <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Neufville%2C%20duc%20de%20Villeroi">Villeroi</a> to go over to the offensive in the Spanish Netherlands and, with victory, gain a 'fair' peace. Accordingly, the French Marshal set off from <a href="Leuven">Leuven</a> ("Louvain") at the head of 60,000 men and marched towards <a href="Tienen">Tienen</a> ("Tirlemont"), as if to threaten <a href="Zoutleeuw">Zoutleeuw</a> ("Léau"). Also determined to fight a major engagement, the <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">Duke of Marlborough</a>, commander-in-chief of Anglo-Dutch forces, assembled his army – some 62,000 men – near <a href="Maastricht">Maastricht</a>, and marched past Zoutleeuw. With both sides seeking battle, they soon encountered each other on the dry ground between the <a href="Mehaigne">Mehaigne</a> and Petite Gheete rivers, close to the small village of <a href="Ramillies%2C%20Belgium">Ramillies</a>.

In less than four hours Marlborough's <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">English</a>, and <a href="Denmark-Norway">Danish</a> forces overwhelmed Villeroi's and <a href="Maximilian%20II%20Emanuel%2C%20Elector%20of%20Bavaria">Max Emanuel</a>'s Franco-Spanish-Bavarian army. The Duke's subtle moves and changes in emphasis during the battle – something his opponents failed to realise until it was too late – caught the French in a tactical vice. With their foe broken and routed, the Allies were able to fully exploit their victory. Town after town fell, including <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> and <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>; by the end of the campaign Villeroi's army had been driven from most of the Spanish Netherlands. With Prince <a href="Prince%20Eugene%20of%20Savoy">Eugene</a>'s subsequent success at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Turin">Battle of Turin</a> in northern Italy, the Allies had imposed the greatest loss of territory and resources that Louis XIV would suffer during the war. Thus, the year 1706 proved, for the Allies, to be an "<a href="annus%20mirabilis">annus mirabilis</a>".

After their disastrous defeat at <a href="Battle%20of%20Blenheim">Blenheim</a> in 1704, the next year brought the French some respite. The <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">Duke of Marlborough</a> had intended the 1705 campaign – an invasion of France through the <a href="Moselle%20River">Moselle</a> valley – to complete the work of Blenheim and persuade King <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV</a> to make peace but the plan had been thwarted by friend and foe alike. The reluctance of his Dutch allies to see their frontiers denuded of troops for another gamble in Germany had denied Marlborough the initiative but of far greater importance was the <a href="Louis%20William%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Baden-Baden">Margrave of Baden</a>’s pronouncement that he could not join the Duke in strength for the coming offensive. This was in part due to the sudden switching of troops from the Rhine to reinforce <a href="Prince%20Eugene%20of%20Savoy">Prince Eugene</a> in Italy and part due to the deterioration of Baden’s health brought on by the re-opening of a severe foot wound he had received at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Schellenberg">storming of the Schellenberg</a> the previous year. Marlborough had to cope with the death of <a href="Leopold%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Leopold I</a> in May and the accession of <a href="Joseph%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Joseph I</a>, which unavoidably complicated matters for the Grand Alliance.

The resilience of the French King and the efforts of his generals, also added to Marlborough’s problems. Marshal <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Neufville%2C%20duc%20de%20Villeroi">Villeroi</a>, exerting considerable pressure on the Dutch commander, Count <a href="Henry%20de%20Nassau%2C%20Lord%20Overkirk">Overkirk</a>, along the <a href="Meuse%20River">Meuse</a>, took <a href="Huy">Huy</a> on 10 June before pressing on towards <a href="Li%C3%A8ge%20%28city%29">Liège</a>. With Marshal Villars sitting strong on the <a href="Moselle">Moselle</a>, the Allied commander – whose supplies had by now become very short – was forced to call off his campaign on 16 June. "What a disgrace for Marlborough," exulted Villeroi, "to have made false movements without any result!" With Marlborough’s departure north, the French transferred troops from the Moselle valley to reinforce Villeroi in Flanders, while Villars marched off to the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a>.

The Anglo-Dutch forces gained minor compensation for the failed Moselle campaign with the success at <a href="Battle%20of%20Elixheim">Elixheim</a> and the crossing of the <a href="Lines%20of%20Brabant">Lines of Brabant</a> in the Spanish Netherlands (Huy was also retaken on 11 July) but a chance to bring the French to a decisive engagement eluded Marlborough. The year 1705 proved almost entirely barren for the Duke, whose military disappointments were only partly compensated by efforts on the diplomatic front where, at the courts of <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>, <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> and <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a>, Marlborough sought to bolster support for the Grand Alliance and extract promises of prompt assistance for the following year's campaign.

On 11 January 1706, Marlborough finally reached <a href="London">London</a> at the end of his diplomatic tour but he had already been planning his strategy for the coming season. The first option (although it is debatable to what extent the Duke was committed to such an enterprise) was a plan to transfer his forces from the Spanish Netherlands to northern Italy; once there, he intended linking up with Prince Eugene in order to defeat the French and safeguard <a href="Duchy%20of%20Savoy">Savoy</a> from being overrun. Savoy would then serve as a gateway into France by way of the mountain passes or an invasion with naval support along the Mediterranean coast via <a href="Nice">Nice</a> and <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a>, in connexion with redoubled Allied efforts in Spain. It seems that the Duke’s favoured scheme was to return to the Moselle valley (where Marshal <a href="Ferdinand%20de%20Marsin">Marsin</a> had recently taken command of French forces) and once more attempt an advance into the heart of France. But these decisions soon became academic. Shortly after Marlborough landed in the Dutch Republic on 14 April, news arrived of big Allied setbacks in the wider war.

Determined to show the Grand Alliance that France was still resolute, Louis XIV prepared to launch a double surprise in <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a> and northern Italy. On the latter front Marshal <a href="Louis%20Joseph%20de%20Bourbon%2C%20duc%20de%20Vend%C3%B4me">Vendôme</a> defeated the Imperial army at <a href="Battle%20of%20Calcinato">Calcinato</a> on 19 April, pushing the Imperialists back in confusion (French forces were now in a position to prepare for the long-anticipated siege of <a href="Turin">Turin</a>). In Alsace, Marshal Villars took Baden by surprise and captured <a href="Haguenau">Haguenau</a>, driving him back across the Rhine in some disorder, thus creating a threat on <a href="Landau">Landau</a>. With these reverses, the Dutch refused to contemplate Marlborough's ambitious march to Italy or any plan that denuded their borders of the Duke and their army. In the interest of coalition harmony, Marlborough prepared to campaign in the Low Countries.

The Duke left <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> on 9 May. "God knows I go with a heavy heart," he wrote six days later to his friend and political ally in England, Lord <a href="Sidney%20Godolphin%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Godolphin">Godolphin</a>, "for I have no hope of doing anything considerable, unless the French do what I am very confident they will not … " – in other words, court battle. On 17 May the Duke concentrated his Dutch and English troops at <a href="Tongeren">Tongeren</a>, near <a href="Maastricht">Maastricht</a>. The Hanoverians, Hessians and Danes, despite earlier undertakings, found, or invented, pressing reasons for withholding their support. Marlborough wrote an appeal to the <a href="Carl%20Rudolf%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg-Neuenstadt">Duke of Württemberg</a>, the commander of the Danish contingent – "I send you this express to request your Highness to bring forward by a double march your cavalry so as to join us at the earliest moment …" Additionally, the King "in" Prussia, <a href="Frederick%20I%20of%20Prussia">Frederick I</a>, had kept his troops in quarters behind the Rhine while his personal disputes with Vienna and the <a href="States%20General%20of%20the%20Netherlands">States General</a> at The Hague remained unresolved. Nevertheless, the Duke could think of no circumstances why the French would leave their strong positions and attack his army, even if Villeroi was first reinforced by substantial transfers from Marsin’s command. But in this he had miscalculated. Although Louis XIV wanted peace he wanted it on reasonable terms; for that, he needed victory in the field and to convince the Allies that his resources were by no means exhausted.

Following the successes in Italy and along the Rhine, Louis XIV was now hopeful of similar results in Flanders. Far from standing on the defensive therefore – and unbeknown to Marlborough – Louis XIV was persistently goading his marshal into action. "[Villeroi] began to imagine," wrote <a href="Louis%20de%20Rouvroy%2C%20duc%20de%20Saint-Simon">St Simon</a>, "that the King doubted his courage, and resolved to stake all at once in an effort to vindicate himself." Accordingly, on 18 May, Villeroi set off from <a href="Leuven">Leuven</a> at the head of 70 <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s, 132 <a href="Squadron%20%28cavalry%29">squadron</a>s and 62 <a href="cannon">cannon</a> – comprising an overall force of some 60,000 troops – and crossed the river <a href="Dijle">Dyle</a> to seek battle with the enemy. Spurred on by his growing confidence in his ability to out-general his opponent, and by <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Versailles</a>’ determination to avenge Blenheim, Villeroi and his generals anticipated success.

Neither opponent expected the clash at the exact moment or place where it occurred. The French moved first to <a href="Tienen">Tienen</a>, (as if to threaten <a href="Zoutleeuw">Zoutleeuw</a>, abandoned by the French in October 1705), before turning southwards, heading for <a href="Jodoigne">Jodoigne</a> – this line of march took Villeroi’s army towards the narrow aperture of dry ground between the <a href="Mehaigne">Mehaigne</a> and Petite Gheete rivers close to the small villages of Ramillies and Taviers; but neither commander quite appreciated how far his opponent had travelled. Villeroi still believed (on 22 May) the Allies were a full day’s march away when in fact they had camped near Corswaren waiting for the Danish squadrons to catch up; for his part, Marlborough deemed Villeroi still at Jodoigne when in reality he was now approaching the plateau of Mont St. André with the intention of pitching camp near Ramillies (see map at right). However, the Prussian infantry was not there. Marlborough wrote to <a href="Thomas%20Wentworth%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Strafford%20%281672%E2%80%931739%29">Lord Raby</a>, the English resident at Berlin: "If it should please God to give us victory over the enemy, the Allies will be little obliged to the King [Frederick] for the success."

The following day, at 01:00, Marlborough dispatched <a href="William%20Cadogan%2C%201st%20Earl%20Cadogan">Cadogan</a>, his Quartermaster-General, with an advanced guard to reconnoitre the same dry ground that Villeroi’s army was now heading toward, country that was well known to the Duke from previous campaigns. Two hours later the Duke followed with the main body: 74 battalions, 123 squadrons, 90 pieces of artillery and 20 mortars, totalling 62,000 troops. At about 08:00, after Cadogan had just passed Merdorp, his force made brief contact with a party of French <a href="hussar">hussar</a>s gathering forage on the edge of the plateau of Jandrenouille. After a brief exchange of shots the French retired and Cadogan's dragoons pressed forward. With a short lift in the mist, Cadogan soon discovered the smartly ordered lines of Villeroi’s advance guard some off; a galloper hastened back to warn Marlborough. Two hours later the Duke, accompanied by the Dutch field commander Field Marshal <a href="Henry%20de%20Nassau%2C%20Lord%20Overkirk">Overkirk</a>, General Daniel Dopff, and the Allied staff, rode up to Cadogan where on the horizon to the westward he could discern the massed ranks of the French army deploying for battle along the front. Marlborough later told Bishop Burnet that, ‘the French army looked the best of any he had ever seen’.

The battlefield of Ramillies is very similar to that of Blenheim, for here too there is an immense area of arable land unimpeded by woods or hedges. Villeroi’s right rested on the villages of Franquenée and Taviers, with the river Mehaigne protecting his flank. A large open plain, about wide, lay between Taviers and Ramillies, but unlike Blenheim, there was no stream to hinder the cavalry. His centre was secured by Ramillies itself, lying on a slight eminence which gave distant views to the north and east. The French left flank was protected by broken country, and by a stream, the Petite Gheete, which runs deep between steep and slippery slopes. On the French side of the stream the ground rises to Offus, the village which, together with Autre-Eglise farther north, anchored Villeroi’s left flank. To the west of the Petite Gheete rises the plateau of Mont St. André; a second plain, the plateau of Jandrenouille – upon which the Anglo-Dutch army amassed – rises to the east.

At 11:00, the Duke ordered the army to take standard battle formation. On the far right, towards Foulz, the British battalions and squadrons took up their posts in a double line near the Jeuche stream. The centre was formed by the mass of Dutch, German, Protestant Swiss and Scottish infantry – perhaps 30,000 men – facing Offus and Ramillies. Also facing Ramillies Marlborough placed a powerful battery of thirty 24-pounders, dragged into position by a team of oxen; further batteries were positioned overlooking the Petite Gheete. On their left, on the broad plain between Taviers and Ramillies – and where Marlborough thought the decisive encounter must take place – Overkirk drew the 69 squadrons of the Dutch and Danish horse, supported by 19 battalions of Dutch infantry and two artillery pieces.

Meanwhile, Villeroi deployed his forces. In Taviers on his right, he placed two battalions of the Greder Suisse Régiment, with a smaller force forward in Franquenée; the whole position was protected by the boggy ground of the Mehaigne river, thus preventing an Allied flanking movement. In the open country between Taviers and Ramillies, he placed 82 squadrons under General de Guiscard supported by several interleaved brigades of French, Swiss and Bavarian infantry. Along the Ramillies–Offus–Autre Eglise ridge-line, Villeroi positioned Walloon and Bavarian infantry, supported by the <a href="Maximilian%20II%20Emanuel%2C%20Elector%20of%20Bavaria">Elector of Bavaria's</a> 50 squadrons of Bavarian and Walloon cavalry placed behind on the plateau of Mont St. André. Ramillies, Offus and Autre-Eglise were all packed with troops and put in a state of defence, with alleys barricaded and walls loop-holed for <a href="muskets">muskets</a>. Villeroi also positioned powerful batteries near Ramillies. These guns (some of which were of the three barrelled kind first seen at Elixheim the previous year) enjoyed good arcs of fire, able to fully cover the approaches of the plateau of Jandrenouille over which the Allied infantry would have to pass.

Marlborough, however, noticed several important weaknesses in the French dispositions. Tactically, it was imperative for Villeroi to occupy Taviers on his right and Autre-Eglise on his left, but by adopting this posture he had been forced to over-extend his forces. Moreover, this disposition – concave in relation to the Allied army – gave Marlborough the opportunity to form a more compact line, drawn up in a shorter front between the ‘horns’ of the French crescent; when the Allied blow came it would be more concentrated and carry more weight. Additionally, the Duke’s disposition facilitated the transfer of troops across his front far more easily than his foe, a tactical advantage that would grow in importance as the events of the afternoon unfolded. Although Villeroi had the option of enveloping the flanks of the Allied army as they deployed on the plateau of Jandrenouille – threatening to encircle their army – the Duke correctly gauged that the characteristically cautious French commander was intent on a defensive battle along the ridge-line.

At 13:00 the batteries went into action; a little later two Allied columns set out from the extremities of their line and attacked the flanks of the Franco-Bavarian army. To the south the <a href="Dutch%20Blue%20Guards">Dutch Guards</a>, under the command of Colonel Wertmüller, came forward with their two field guns to seize the hamlet of Franquenée. The small Swiss garrison in the village, shaken by the sudden onslaught and unsupported by the battalions to their rear, were soon compelled back towards the village of Taviers. Taviers was of particular importance to the Franco-Bavarian position: it protected the otherwise unsupported flank of General de Guiscard’s cavalry on the open plain, while at the same time, it allowed the French infantry to pose a threat to the flanks of the Dutch and Danish squadrons as they came forward into position. But hardly had the retreating Swiss rejoined their comrades in that village when the Dutch Guards renewed their attack. The fighting amongst the alleys and cottages soon deteriorated into a fierce bayonet and clubbing "mêlée", but the superiority in Dutch firepower soon told. The accomplished French officer, Colonel de la Colonie, standing on the plain nearby remembered – "this village was the opening of the engagement, and the fighting there was almost as murderous as the rest of the battle put together." By about 15:00 the Swiss had been pushed out of the village into the marshes beyond.

Villeroi’s right flank fell into chaos and was now open and vulnerable. Alerted to the situation de Guiscard ordered an immediate attack with 14 squadrons of French dragoons currently stationed in the rear. Two other battalions of the Greder Suisse Régiment were also sent, but the attack was poorly co-ordinated and consequently went in piecemeal. The Anglo-Dutch commanders now sent dismounted Dutch dragoons into Taviers, which, together with the Guards and their field guns, poured concentrated musketry- and canister-fire into the advancing French troops. Colonel d’Aubigni, leading his regiment, fell mortally wounded.

As the French ranks wavered, the leading squadrons of Württemberg’s Danish horse – now unhampered by enemy fire from either village – were also sent into the attack and fell upon the exposed flank of the Franco-Swiss infantry and dragoons. De la Colonie, with his Grenadiers Rouge regiment, together with the Cologne Guards who were brigaded with them, was now ordered forward from his post south of Ramillies to support the faltering counter-attack on the village. But on his arrival, all was chaos – "Scarcely had my troops got over when the dragoons and Swiss who had preceded us, came tumbling down upon my battalions in full flight … My own fellows turned about and fled along with them." De La Colonie managed to rally some of his grenadiers, together with the remnants of the French dragoons and Greder Suisse battalions, but it was an entirely peripheral operation, offering only fragile support for Villeroi’s right flank.

While the attack on Taviers went in the <a href="George%20Hamilton%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Orkney">Earl of Orkney</a> launched his first line of English across the Petite Gheete in a determined attack against the barricaded villages of Offus and Autre-Eglise on the Allied right. Villeroi, posting himself near Offus, watched anxiously the redcoats' advance, mindful of the counsel he had received on 6 May from Louis XIV – "Have particular care to that part of the line which will endure the first shock of the English troops." Heeding this advice the French commander began to transfer battalions from his centre to reinforce the left, drawing more foot from the already weakened right to replace them.

As the English battalions descended the gentle slope of the Petite Gheete valley, struggling through the boggy stream, they were met by Major General de la Guiche’s disciplined Walloon infantry sent forward from around Offus. After concentrated volleys, exacting heavy casualties on the redcoats, the Walloons reformed back to the ridgeline in good order. The English took some time to reform their ranks on the dry ground beyond the stream and press on up the slope towards the cottages and barricades on the ridge. The vigour of the English assault, however, was such that they threatened to break through the line of the villages and out onto the open plateau of Mont St André beyond. This was potentially dangerous for the Allied infantry who would then be at the mercy of the Elector’s Bavarian and Walloon squadrons patiently waiting on the plateau for the order to move.

Although <a href="Henry%20Lumley">Henry Lumley</a>’s English cavalry had managed to cross the marshy ground around the Petite Gheete, it was soon evident to Marlborough that sufficient cavalry support would not be practicable and that the battle could not be won on the Allied right. The Duke, therefore, called off the attack against Offus and Autre-Eglise. To make sure that Orkney obeyed his order to withdraw, Marlborough sent his Quartermaster-General in person with the command. Despite Orkney’s protestations, Cadogan insisted on compliance and, reluctantly, Orkney gave the word for his troops to fall back to their original positions on the edge of the plateau of Jandrenouille. It is still not clear how far Orkney’s advance was planned only as a feint; according to historian David Chandler it is probably more accurate to surmise that Marlborough launched Orkney in a serious probe with a view to sounding out the possibilities of the sector. Nevertheless, the attack had served its purpose. Villeroi had given his personal attention to that wing and strengthened it with large bodies of horse and foot that ought to have been taking part in the decisive struggle south of Ramillies.

Meanwhile, the Dutch assault on Ramillies was gaining pace. Marlborough’s younger brother, General of Infantry, <a href="Charles%20Churchill%20%28British%20Army%20general%29">Charles Churchill</a>, ordered four brigades of foot to attack the village. The assault consisted of 12 battalions of Dutch infantry commanded by Major Generals Schultz and Spaar; two brigades of Saxons under <a href="Johann%20Matthias%20von%20der%20Schulenburg">Count Schulenburg</a>; a Scottish brigade in Dutch service led by the <a href="John%20Campbell%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Argyll">2nd Duke of Argyle</a>; and a small brigade of Protestant Swiss. The 20 French and Bavarian battalions in Ramillies, supported by the Irish dragoons who had left Ireland in the <a href="Flight%20of%20the%20Wild%20Geese">Flight of the Wild Geese</a> to join <a href="Clare%27s%20Dragoons">Clare's Dragoons</a> and a small brigade of Cologne and Bavarian Guards under the <a href="Alessandro%2C%20Marquis%20de%20Maffei">Marquis de Maffei</a>, put up a determined defence, initially driving back the attackers with severe losses as commemorated in the song "Clare's Dragoons":
<poem>
When on Ramillies' bloody field
The baffled French were forced to yield,
The victor Saxon backward reeled
Before the charge of Clare's Dragoons.

"Viva là, the new brigade!"
"Viva là the old one too!"
"Viva là, the Rose shall fade"
"The Shamrock shine forever new!"
</poem>
Seeing that Schultz and Spaar were faltering, Marlborough now ordered Orkney’s second-line British and Danish battalions (who had not been used in the assault on Offus and Autre-Eglise) to move south towards Ramillies. Shielded as they were from observation by a slight fold in the land, their commander, Brigadier-General Van Pallandt, ordered the regimental colours to be left in place on the edge of the plateau to convince their opponents they were still in their initial position. Therefore, unbeknown to the French who remained oblivious to the Allies’ real strength and intentions on the opposite side of the Petite Gheete, Marlborough was throwing his full weight against Ramillies and the open plain to the south. Villeroi meanwhile, was still moving more reserves of infantry in the opposite direction towards his left flank; crucially, it would be some time before the French commander noticed the subtle change in emphasis of the Allied dispositions.

At around 15:30, Overkirk advanced his massed squadrons on the open plain in support of the infantry attack on Ramillies. Overkirk's squadrons – 48 Dutch, supported on their left by 21 Danish – steadily advanced towards the enemy (taking care not to prematurely tire the horses), before breaking into a trot to gain the impetus for their charge. The <a href="Antoine%20de%20Pas%20de%20Feuqui%C3%A8res">Marquis de Feuquières</a> writing after the battle described the scene – "They advanced in four lines … As they approached they advanced their second and fourth lines into the intervals of their first and third lines; so that when they made their advance upon us, they formed only one front, without any intermediate spaces."

The initial clash favoured the Dutch and Danish squadrons. The disparity of numbers – exacerbated by Villeroi stripping their ranks of infantry to reinforce his left flank – enabled Overkirk's cavalry to throw the first line of French horse back in some disorder towards their second-line squadrons. This line also came under severe pressure and, in turn, was forced back to their third-line of cavalry and the few battalions still remaining on the plain. But these French horsemen were amongst the best in Louis XIV’s army – the "<a href="Maison%20militaire%20du%20roi%20de%20France">Maison du Roi</a>", supported by four elite squadrons of Bavarian Cuirassiers. Ably led by de Guiscard, the French cavalry rallied, thrusting back the Allied squadrons in successful local counterattacks. On Overkirk’s right flank, close to Ramillies, ten of his squadrons suddenly broke ranks and were scattered, riding headlong to the rear to recover their order, leaving the left flank of the Allied assault on Ramillies dangerously exposed. Notwithstanding the lack of infantry support, de Guiscard threw his cavalry forward in an attempt to split the Allied army in two.

A crisis threatened the centre, but from his vantage point Marlborough was at once aware of the situation. The Allied commander now summoned the cavalry on the right wing to reinforce his centre, leaving only the English squadrons in support of Orkney. Thanks to a combination of battle-smoke and favourable terrain, his redeployment went unnoticed by Villeroi who made no attempt to transfer any of his own 50 unused squadrons. While he waited for the fresh reinforcements to arrive, Marlborough flung himself into the "mêlée", rallying some of the Dutch cavalry who were in confusion. But his personal involvement nearly led to his undoing. A number of French horsemen, recognising the Duke, came surging towards his party. Marlborough’s horse tumbled and the Duke was thrown – "Milord Marlborough was rid over," wrote Orkney some time later. It was a critical moment of the battle. "Major-General Murray," recalled one eye witness, " … seeing him fall, marched up in all haste with two Swiss battalions to save him and stop the enemy who were hewing all down in their way." Fortunately Marlborough’s newly appointed aide-de-camp, <a href="Richard%20Molesworth%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Molesworth">Richard Molesworth</a>, galloped to the rescue, mounted the Duke on his horse and made good their escape, before Murray’s disciplined ranks threw back the pursuing French troopers.

After a brief pause, Marlborough’s equerry, Colonel Bringfield (or Bingfield), led up another of the Duke’s spare horses; but while assisting him onto his mount, the unfortunate Bringfield was hit by an errant cannonball that sheared off his head. One account has it that the cannonball flew between the Captain-General’s legs before hitting the unfortunate colonel, whose torso fell at Marlborough’s feet – a moment subsequently depicted in a lurid set of contemporary playing cards. Nevertheless, the danger passed, enabling the Duke to attend to the positioning of the cavalry reinforcements feeding down from his right flank – a change of which Villeroi remained blissfully unaware.

The time was about 16:30, and the two armies were in close contact across the whole front, from the skirmishing in the marshes in the south, through the vast cavalry battle on the open plain; to the fierce struggle for Ramillies at the centre, and to the north, where, around the cottages of Offus and Autre-Eglise, Orkney and de la Guiche faced each other across the Petite Gheete ready to renew hostilities.

The arrival of the transferring squadrons now began to tip the balance in favour of the Allies. Tired, and suffering a growing list of casualties, the numerical inferiority of Guiscard’s squadrons battling on the plain at last began to tell. After earlier failing to hold or retake Franquenée and Taviers, Guiscard’s right flank had become dangerously exposed and a fatal gap had opened on the right of their line. Taking advantage of this breach, Württemberg’s Danish cavalry now swept forward, wheeling to penetrate the flank of the Maison du Roi whose attention was almost entirely fixed on holding back the Dutch. Sweeping forwards, virtually without resistance, the 21 Danish squadrons reformed behind the French around the area of the Tomb of Ottomond, facing north across the plateau of Mont St André towards the exposed flank of Villeroi’s army.

The final Allied reinforcements for the cavalry contest to the south were at last in position; Marlborough’s superiority on the left could no longer be denied, and his fast-moving plan took hold of the battlefield. Now, far too late, Villeroi tried to redeploy his 50 unused squadrons, but a desperate attempt to form line facing south, stretching from Offus to Mont St André, floundered amongst the baggage and tents of the French camp carelessly left there after the initial deployment. The Allied commander ordered his cavalry forward against the now heavily outnumbered French and Bavarian horsemen. De Guiscard’s right flank, without proper infantry support, could no longer resist the onslaught and, turning their horses northwards, they broke and fled in complete disorder. Even the squadrons currently being scrambled together by Villeroi behind Ramillies could not withstand the onslaught. "We had not got forty yards on our retreat," remembered Captain Peter Drake, an Irishmen serving with the French – "when the words "sauve qui peut" went through the great part, if not the whole army, and put all to confusion"

In Ramillies the Allied infantry, now reinforced by the English troops brought down from the north, at last broke through. The Régiment de Picardie stood their ground but were caught between Colonel Borthwick’s Scots-Dutch regiment and the English reinforcements. Borthwick was killed, as was <a href="Charles%20O%27Brien%2C%205th%20Viscount%20Clare">Charles O’Brien</a>, the Irish Viscount Clare in French service, fighting at the head of his regiment. The Marquis de Maffei attempted one last stand with his Bavarian and Cologne Guards, but it proved in vain. Noticing a rush of horsemen fast approaching from the south, he later recalled – " … I went towards the nearest of these squadrons to instruct their officer, but instead of being listened to [I] was immediately surrounded and called upon to ask for quarter."

The roads leading north and west were choked with fugitives. Orkney now sent his English troops back across the Petite Gheete stream to once again storm Offus where de la Guiche’s infantry had begun to drift away in the confusion. To the right of the infantry Lord John Hay’s <a href="Royal%20Scots%20Greys">‘Scots Greys’</a> also picked their way across the stream and charged the Régiment du Roi within Autre-Eglise. "Our dragoons," wrote John Deane, "pushing into the village … made terrible slaughter of the enemy." The Bavarian Horse Grenadiers and the Electoral Guards withdrew and formed a shield about Villeroi and the Elector but were scattered by Lumley’s cavalry. Stuck in the mass of fugitives fleeing the battlefield, the French and Bavarian commanders narrowly escaped capture by General Cornelius Wood who, unaware of their identity, had to content himself with the seizure of two Bavarian Lieutenant-Generals. Far to the south, the remnants of de la Colonie’s brigade headed in the opposite direction towards the French held fortress of <a href="Namur%20%28city%29">Namur</a>."

The retreat became a rout. Individual Allied commanders drove their troops forward in pursuit, allowing their beaten enemy no chance to recover. Soon the Allied infantry could no longer keep up, but their cavalry were off the leash, heading through the gathering night for the crossings on the Dyle river. At last, however, Marlborough called a halt to the pursuit shortly after midnight near Meldert, from the field. "It was indeed a truly shocking sight to see the miserable remains of this mighty army," wrote Captain Drake, "… reduced to a handful."

What was left of Villeroi’s army was now broken in spirit; the imbalance of the casualty figures amply demonstrates the extent of the disaster for Louis XIV’s army: ("<a href="%23Casualties">see below</a>"). In addition, hundreds of French soldiers were fugitives, many of whom would never remuster to the <a href="Colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons">colours</a>. Villeroi also lost 52 artillery pieces and his entire engineer <a href="Pontoon%20bridge">pontoon</a> train. In the words of Marshal Villars, the French defeat at Ramillies was – "The most shameful, humiliating and disastrous of routs."

Town after town now succumbed to the Allies. <a href="Leuven">Leuven</a> fell on 25 May 1706; three days later, the Allies entered <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, the capital of the Spanish Netherlands. Marlborough realised the great opportunity created by the early victory of Ramillies: "We now have the whole summer before us," wrote the Duke from Brussels to <a href="Robert%20Harley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Oxford%20and%20Earl%20Mortimer">Robert Harley</a>, "and with the blessing of God I shall make the best use of it." <a href="Mechelen">Malines</a>, <a href="Lier%2C%20Belgium">Lierre</a>, <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a>, <a href="Aalst%2C%20Belgium">Alost</a>, <a href="Damme">Damme</a>, <a href="Oudenaarde">Oudenaarde</a>, <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a>, and on 6 June <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, all subsequently fell to Marlborough’s victorious army and, like Brussels, proclaimed the Austrian candidate for the Spanish throne, the <a href="Charles%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Archduke Charles</a>, as their sovereign. Villeroi was helpless to arrest the process of collapse. When Louis XIV learnt of the disaster he recalled Marshal Vendôme from northern Italy to take command in Flanders; but it would be weeks before the command changed hands.

As news spread of the Allies’ triumph, the Prussians, Hessians and Hanoverian contingents, long delayed by their respective rulers, eagerly joined the pursuit of the broken French and Bavarian forces. "This," wrote Marlborough wearily, "I take to be owing to our late success." Meanwhile, Overkirk took the port of <a href="Ostend">Ostend</a> on 4 July thus opening a direct route to the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> for communication and supply, but the Allies were making scant progress against <a href="Dendermonde">Dendermonde</a> whose governor, the <a href="Marquis%20de%20Val%C3%A9e">Marquis de Valée</a>, was stubbornly resisting. Only later when Cadogan and Churchill went to take charge did the town’s defences begin to fail.

Vendôme formally took over command in Flanders on 4 August; Villeroi would never again receive a major command – "I cannot foresee a happy day in my life save only that of my death." Louis XIV was more forgiving to his old friend – "At our age, Marshal, we must no longer expect good fortune." In the mean time, Marlborough invested the elaborate fortress of <a href="Menen">Menin</a> which, after a costly siege, capitulated on 22 August. Dendermonde finally succumbed on 6 September followed by <a href="Ath">Ath</a> – the last conquest of 1706 – on 2 October. By the time Marlborough had closed down the Ramillies campaign he had denied the French most of the Spanish Netherlands west of the <a href="Meuse%20River">Meuse</a> and north of the <a href="Sambre">Sambre</a> – it was an unsurpassed operational triumph for the English Duke but once again it was not decisive as these gains did not defeat France.

The immediate question for the Allies now was how to deal with the Spanish Netherlands, a subject which the Austrians and the Dutch were diametrically opposed. Emperor Joseph I, acting on behalf of his younger brother King ’Charles III’, absent in Spain, claimed that reconquered Brabant and Flanders should be put under immediate possession of a governor named by himself. The Dutch, however, who had supplied the major share of the troops and money to secure the victory (the Austrians had produced nothing of either) claimed the government of the region till the war was over, and that after the peace they should continue to garrison Barrier Fortresses stronger than those which had fallen so easily to Louis XIV’s forces in 1701. Marlborough mediated between the two parties but favoured the Dutch position. To sway the Duke’s opinion, the Emperor offered Marlborough the governorship of the Spanish Netherlands. It was a tempting offer, but in the name of Allied unity, it was one he refused. In the end England and the Dutch Republic took control of the newly won territory for the duration of the war; after which it was to be handed over to the direct rule of ‘Charles III’, subject to the reservation of a Dutch Barrier, the extent and nature of which had yet to be settled.

Meanwhile, on the Upper Rhine, Villars had been forced onto the defensive as battalion after battalion had been sent north to bolster collapsing French forces in Flanders; there was now no possibility of his undertaking the re-capture of Landau. Further good news for the Allies arrived from northern Italy where, on 7 September, Prince Eugene had routed a French army before the <a href="Piedmont">Piedmont</a>ese capital, <a href="Battle%20of%20Turin">Turin</a>, driving the Franco-Spanish forces from northern Italy. Only from Spain did Louis XIV receive any good news where <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%20Lu%C3%ADs%20de%20Sousa%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Minas">Das Minas</a> and <a href="Henri%20de%20Massue%2C%20Earl%20of%20Galway">Galway</a> had been forced to retreat from <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> towards <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a>, allowing <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Spain">Philip V</a> to re-enter his capital on 4 October. All in all though, the situation had changed considerably and Louis XIV began to look for ways to end what was fast becoming a ruinous war for France. For <a href="Queen%20Anne%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a> also, the Ramillies campaign had one overriding significance – "Now we have God be thanked so hopeful a prospect of peace." Instead of continuing the momentum of victory, however, cracks in Allied unity would enable Louis XIV to reverse some of the major setbacks suffered at Turin and Ramillies.

The total number of French casualties cannot be calculated precisely, so complete was the collapse of the Franco-Bavarian army that day. <a href="David%20G.%20Chandler">David G. Chandler</a>’s "Marlborough as Military Commander" and "A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe" are consistent with regards to French casualty figures i.e., 12,000 dead and wounded plus some 7,000 taken prisoner. James Falkner, in "Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles," also notes 12,000 dead and wounded and states ‘up to 10,000’ taken prisoner. In "The Collins Encyclopaedia of Military History", Dupuy puts Villeroi’s dead and wounded at 8,000, with a further 7,000 captured. John Millner’s memoirs – "Compendious Journal" (1733) – is more specific, recording 12,087 of Villeroi’s army were killed or wounded, with another 9,729 taken prisoner. In "Marlborough", however, <a href="Correlli%20Barnett">Correlli Barnett</a> puts the total casualty figure as high as 30,000 – 15,000 dead and wounded with an additional 15,000 taken captive. Trevelyan estimates Villeroi’s casualties at 13,000, but adds, ‘his losses by desertion may have doubled that number’. La Colonie omits a casualty figure in his "Chronicles of an old Campaigner"; but Saint-Simon in his "Memoirs" states 4,000 killed, adding 'many others were wounded and many important persons were taken prisoner'. <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>, however, in "Histoire du siècle du Louis XIV" records, 'the French lost there twenty thousand men'.

Born in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, Kernighan attended the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a> between 1960 and 1964, earning his <a href="Bachelor%27s%20degree">Bachelor's degree</a> in <a href="engineering%20physics">engineering physics</a>. He received his PhD in <a href="electrical%20engineering">electrical engineering</a> from <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> in 1969 for research supervised by Peter Weiner.

Kernighan has held a professorship in the department of computer science at Princeton since 2000. Each fall he teaches a course called "Computers in Our World", which introduces the fundamentals of computing to non-majors. Kernighan's name became widely known through co-authorship of the first book on the <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C programming language</a> with <a href="Dennis%20Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a>. Kernighan affirmed that he had no part in the design of the C language ("it's entirely Dennis Ritchie's work"). He authored many <a href="Unix">Unix</a> programs, including <a href="troff">ditroff</a>.

In collaboration with Shen Lin he devised well-known <a href="heuristic">heuristic</a>s for two <a href="NP-complete">NP-complete</a> optimization problems: <a href="graph%20partition">graph partition</a>ing and the <a href="travelling%20salesman%20problem">travelling salesman problem</a>.

BCPL

BCPL ("Basic Combined Programming Language"; or 'Before C Programming Language' (common humorous <a href="backronym">backronym</a>) ) is a <a href="procedural%20programming">procedural</a>, <a href="imperative%20programming">imperative</a>, and <a href="structured%20programming">structured</a> <a href="computer">computer</a> <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a>. Originally intended for writing <a href="compiler">compiler</a>s for other languages, BCPL is no longer in common use. However, its influence is still felt because a stripped down and syntactically changed version of BCPL, called <a href="B%20%28programming%20language%29">B</a>, was the language on which the <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C programming language</a> was based. BCPL introduced several features of modern programming languages, including <a href="brace%20programming%20language">curley braces notation</a> for code blocks; compilation via <a href="virtual%20machine">virtual machine</a> <a href="byte%20code">byte code</a>; and the world's first '<a href="hello%20world">hello world</a>' demonstrator program. 

BCPL was designed so that small and simple compilers could be written for it; reputedly some compilers could be run in 16 <a href="kilobyte">kilobyte</a>s. Further, the original compiler, itself written in BCPL, was easily portable. BCPL was thus a popular choice for <a href="bootstrapping%20%28compilers%29">bootstrapping</a> a system. A major reason for the compiler's portability lay in its structure. It was split into two parts: the front end parsed the source and generated <a href="O-code%20machine">O-code</a> for a <a href="virtual%20machine">virtual machine</a>, and the back end took the O-code and translated it into the code for the target machine. Only 1/5 of the compiler's code needed to be rewritten to support a new machine, a task that usually took between 2 and 5 <a href="man-month">man-month</a>s. This approach became common practice later, e.g., <a href="Pascal%20%28programming%20language%29">Pascal</a> or <a href="Java%20%28programming%20language%29">Java</a>, but the original BCPL compiler was the first to define a virtual machine for this purpose.

The language is unusual in having only one <a href="data%20type">data type</a>: a <a href="Word%20%28data%20type%29">word</a>, a fixed number of bits, usually chosen to align with the architecture's machine word and of adequate capacity to represent any valid storage address. For many machines of the time, this data type was a 16-bit word. This choice later proved to be a significant problem when BCPL was used on machines in which the smallest addressable item was not a word but a <a href="byte">byte</a>, or on machines with larger word sizes such as 32-bit or 64-bit.

The interpretation of any value was determined by the operators used to process the values. (For example, + added two values together treating them as <a href="integer">integer</a>s; ! indirected through a value, effectively treating it as a pointer.) In order for this to work, the implementation provided no <a href="type%20checking">type checking</a>. The <a href="Hungarian%20notation">Hungarian notation</a> was developed to help programmers avoid inadvertent type errors.

The mismatch between BCPL's <a href="Word%20%28data%20type%29">word orientation</a> and <a href="byte%20orientation">byte-oriented</a> hardware was addressed in several ways. One was providing standard library routines for packing and unpacking words into byte strings. Later, two language features were added: the bit-field selection operator and the infix byte indirection operator (denoted by the '%' character).

BCPL handles bindings spanning separate <a href="compilation%20unit">compilation unit</a>s in a unique way. There are no user-declarable global variables; instead there is a global vector, which is similar to "blank common" in <a href="Fortran">Fortran</a>. All data shared between different compilation units comprises scalars and pointers to vectors stored in a pre-arranged place in the global vector. Thus the header files (files included during compilation using the "GET" directive) become the primary means of synchronizing global data between compilation units, containing "GLOBAL" directives that present lists of symbolic names, each paired with a number that associates the name with the corresponding numerically addressed word in the global vector. As well as variables, the global vector also contains bindings for external procedures. This makes dynamic loading of compilation units very simple to achieve. Instead of relying on the link loader of the underlying implementation, effectively BCPL gives the programmer control of the linking process.

The global vector also made it very simple to replace or augment standard library routines. A program could save the pointer from the global vector to the original routine and replace it with a pointer to an alternative version. The alternative might call the original as part of its processing. This could be used as a quick "ad hoc" debugging aid.

BCPL was the first <a href="brace%20programming%20language">brace programming language</a>, and the braces survived the syntactical changes and have become a common means of denoting program source code statements. In practice, on limited keyboards of the day, source programs often used the sequences codice_1 and codice_2 in place of the symbols codice_3 and codice_4.
The single-line codice_5 <a href="comment%20%28computer%20programming%29">comment</a>s of BCPL, which were not adopted by <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a>, reappeared in <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a> and later in <a href="C99">C99</a>.

The book "BCPL: The language and its compiler" describes the philosophy of BCPL as follows:

Print factorials:
Count solutions to the <a href="Eight%20queens%20puzzle">N queens problem</a>:
BCPL was designed by <a href="Martin%20Richards%20%28computer%20scientist%29">Martin Richards</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> in 1966. BCPL was a response to difficulties with its predecessor, Cambridge Programming Language, later renamed <a href="Combined%20Programming%20Language">Combined Programming Language</a> (CPL), which was designed during the early 1960s. Richards created BCPL by "removing those features of the full language which make compilation difficult". The first compiler implementation, for the <a href="IBM%207094">IBM 7094</a> under <a href="Compatible%20Time-Sharing%20System">Compatible Time-Sharing System</a> (CTSS), was written while Richards was visiting <a href="Project%20MAC">Project MAC</a> at the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) in the spring of 1967. The language was first described in a paper presented to the 1969 Spring Joint Computer Conference.

BCPL has been rumored to have originally stood for "Bootstrap Cambridge Programming Language", but CPL was never created since development stopped at BCPL, and the acronym was later reinterpreted for the BCPL book.

BCPL is the language in which the original <a href="hello%20world%20program">hello world program</a> was written. The first <a href="MUD">MUD</a> was also written in BCPL (<a href="MUD1">MUD1</a>).

Several <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>s were written partially or wholly in BCPL (for example, <a href="TRIPOS">TRIPOS</a> and the earliest versions of <a href="AmigaDOS">AmigaDOS</a>). BCPL was also the initial language used in the seminal <a href="Xerox%20PARC">Xerox PARC</a> <a href="Alto%20%28computer%29">Alto</a> project, the first modern <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>; among other projects, the <a href="Bravo%20%28software%29">Bravo</a> <a href="Word%20processor">document preparation system</a> was written in BCPL.

An early compiler, bootstrapped in 1969, by starting with a paper tape of the <a href="O-code">O-code</a> of Martin Richards's <a href="Titan%20%28computer%29">Atlas 2</a> compiler, targeted the <a href="ICT%201900%20series">ICT 1900 series</a>. The two machines had different word-lengths (48 vs 24 bits), different character encodings, and different packed string representations—and the successful bootstrapping increased confidence in the practicality of the method.

By late 1970, implementations existed for the <a href="GE-600%20series">Honeywell 635 and Honeywell 645</a>, the <a href="IBM%20360">IBM 360</a>, the <a href="PDP-10">PDP-10</a>, the <a href="TX-2">TX-2</a>, the <a href="CDC%206400">CDC 6400</a>, the <a href="UNIVAC%201108">UNIVAC 1108</a>, the <a href="PDP-9">PDP-9</a>, the <a href="KDF%209">KDF 9</a> and the <a href="Titan%20%28computer%29">Atlas 2</a>. In 1974 a dialect of BCPL was implemented at <a href="BBN%20Technologies">BBN</a> without using the intermediate <a href="O-code">O-code</a>. The initial implementation was a <a href="cross-compiler">cross-compiler</a> hosted on BBN's <a href="TOPS-20%23TENEX">Tenex</a> <a href="PDP-10">PDP-10</a>s, and directly targeted the <a href="PDP-11">PDP-11</a>s used in BBN's implementation of the second generation <a href="Interface%20Message%20Processor">IMPs</a> used in the <a href="Arpanet">Arpanet</a>.

There was also a version produced for the <a href="BBC%20Micro">BBC Micro</a> in the mid-1980s, by Richards Computer Products, a company started by John Richards, the brother of Dr. Martin Richards. The <a href="BBC%20Domesday%20Project">BBC Domesday Project</a> made use of the language. Versions of BCPL for the <a href="Amstrad%20CPC">Amstrad CPC</a> and <a href="Amstrad%20PCW">Amstrad PCW</a> computers were also released in 1986 by UK software house Arnor Ltd. MacBCPL was released for the Apple Macintosh in 1985 by Topexpress Ltd, of Kensington, England.

Both the design and philosophy of BCPL strongly influenced <a href="B%20%28programming%20language%29">B</a>, which in turn influenced <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a>. Programmers at the time debated whether an eventual successor to C would be called "D" (the next letter in the alphabet) or "P" (the next letter in the parent language name). As it happened, the actual name turned out to be "C++" (a pun on the C language increment operator).

In 1979, implementations of BCPL existed for at least 25 architectures; the language gradually fell out of favour as C became popular on non-Unix systems.

Martin Richards maintains a modern Linux version of BCPL on his website, last updated in 2011. He continues to program in it, including for his research on musical <a href="automated%20score%20following">automated score following</a>.

Battleship

A battleship is a large <a href="armour">armored</a> <a href="warship">warship</a> with a main <a href="artillery%20battery">battery</a> consisting of large <a href="caliber">caliber</a> guns. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries the battleship was the most powerful type of warship, and a <a href="Naval%20fleet">fleet</a> of battleships was considered vital for any nation that desired to maintain <a href="command%20of%20the%20sea">command of the sea</a>.

The word "battleship" was coined around 1794 and is a contraction of the phrase "<a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">line-of-battle ship</a>", the dominant wooden warship during the <a href="Age%20of%20Sail">Age of Sail</a>. The term came into formal use in the late 1880s to describe a type of <a href="ironclad%20warship">ironclad warship</a>, now referred to by historians as <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>s. In 1906, the commissioning of heralded a revolution in battleship design. Subsequent battleship designs, influenced by HMS "Dreadnought", were referred to as "<a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>s".

Battleships were a symbol of naval dominance and national might, and for decades the battleship was a major factor in both diplomacy and <a href="military%20strategy">military strategy</a>. A global <a href="arms%20race">arms race</a> in battleship construction began in Europe in the 1890s and culminated at the decisive <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Battle of Tsushima</a> in 1905; the outcome of which significantly influenced the design of HMS "Dreadnought". The launch of "Dreadnought" in 1906 commenced a new naval arms race. Three major <a href="fleet%20action">fleet action</a>s between steel battleships took place: the decisive battles of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Yellow%20Sea">Yellow Sea (1904)</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Tsushima (1905)</a> during the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a>, and the inconclusive <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> (1916) during the First World War. Jutland was the largest naval battle and the only full-scale clash of battleships in the war, and it was the last major battle fought primarily by battleships in world history.

The <a href="Treaty%20for%20the%20Limitation%20of%20Naval%20Armament">Naval Treaties</a> of the 1920s and 1930s limited the number of battleships, though technical innovation in battleship design continued. Both the Allied and Axis powers built battleships during World War II, though the increasing importance of the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> meant that the battleship played a less important role than had been expected.

The value of the battleship has been questioned, even during their heyday. There were few of the decisive fleet battles that battleship proponents expected, and used to justify the vast resources spent on building battlefleets. Even in spite of their huge firepower and protection, battleships were increasingly vulnerable to much smaller, cheaper weapons: initially the <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> and the <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>, and later aircraft and the <a href="guided%20missile">guided missile</a>. The growing range of naval engagements led to the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> replacing the battleship as the leading <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a> during World War II, with the last battleship to be launched being in 1944. Battleships were retained by the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> into the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> for <a href="fire%20support">fire support</a> purposes before being stricken from the U.S. <a href="Naval%20Vessel%20Register">Naval Vessel Register</a> in the 2000s.

A ship of the line was a large, unarmored wooden sailing ship which mounted a <a href="artillery%20battery">battery</a> of up to 120 <a href="smoothbore">smoothbore</a> <a href="gun">gun</a>s and <a href="carronade">carronade</a>s. The ship of the line developed gradually over centuries and, apart from growing in size, it changed little between the adoption of <a href="line%20of%20battle">line of battle</a> tactics in the early 17th century and the end of the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s. From 1794, the alternative term 'line of battle ship' was contracted (informally at first) to 'battle ship' or 'battleship'.

The sheer number of guns fired <a href="broadside">broadside</a> meant a sail battleship could wreck any wooden enemy, holing her <a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a>, knocking down <a href="mast%20%28sailing%29">mast</a>s, wrecking her <a href="rigging">rigging</a>, and killing her crew. However, the effective range of the guns was as little as a few hundred yards, so the battle tactics of sailing ships depended in part on the wind.

The first major change to the ship of the line concept was the introduction of <a href="steam%20power">steam power</a> as an auxiliary <a href="marine%20propulsion">propulsion system</a>. Steam power was gradually introduced to the navy in the first half of the 19th century, initially for small craft and later for <a href="frigate">frigate</a>s. The <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> introduced steam to the line of battle with the 90-gun in 1850—the first true steam battleship. "Napoléon" was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line, but her steam engines could give her a speed of , regardless of the wind condition. This was a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement. The introduction of steam accelerated the growth in size of battleships. France and the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a> were the only countries to develop <a href="List%20of%20steam%20powered%20ships%20of%20the%20line">fleets of wooden steam screw battleships</a> although several other navies operated small numbers of screw battleships, including <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a> (9), <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Turkey</a> (3), <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> (2), <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Naples">Naples</a> (1), <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> (1) and <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austria</a> (1).

The adoption of steam power was only one of a number of technological advances which revolutionized warship design in the 19th century. The ship of the line was overtaken by the <a href="ironclad%20warship">ironclad</a>: powered by steam, protected by metal armor, and armed with guns firing <a href="high-explosive">high-explosive</a> <a href="shell%20%28projectile%29">shells</a>.

Guns that fired explosive or <a href="incendiary%20ammunition">incendiary shells</a> were a major threat to wooden ships, and these weapons quickly became widespread after the introduction of 8 inch shell guns as part of the standard armament of French and American line-of-battle ships in 1841. In the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>, six line-of-battle ships and two frigates of the Russian <a href="Black%20Sea%20Fleet">Black Sea Fleet</a> destroyed seven Turkish frigates and three corvettes with explosive shells at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sinop">Battle of Sinop</a> in 1853. Later in the war, French ironclad floating batteries used similar weapons against the defenses at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kinburn%20%281855%29">Battle of Kinburn</a>.

Nevertheless, wooden-hulled ships stood up comparatively well to shells, as shown in the 1866 <a href="Battle%20of%20Lissa%20%281866%29">Battle of Lissa</a>, where the modern Austrian steam two-decker ranged across a confused battlefield, rammed an <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy%20%281861%E2%80%931946%29">Italian</a> ironclad and took 80 hits from Italian ironclads, many of which were shells, but including at least one 300 pound shot at point blank range. Despite losing her <a href="bowsprit">bowsprit</a> and her foremast, and being set on fire, she was ready for action again the very next day.

The development of high-explosive shells made the use of iron <a href="armour">armor</a> plate on warships necessary. In 1859 <a href="France">France</a> launched , the first ocean-going ironclad warship. She had the profile of a ship of the line, cut to one deck due to weight considerations. Although made of wood and reliant on sail for most journeys, "Gloire" was fitted with a propeller, and her wooden hull was protected by a layer of thick iron armor. "Gloire" prompted further innovation from the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, anxious to prevent France from gaining a technological lead.

The superior armored frigate followed "Gloire" by only 14 months, and both nations embarked on a program of building new ironclads and converting existing screw ships of the line to armored frigates. Within two years, Italy, Austria, <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spain</a> and Russia had all ordered ironclad warships, and by the time of the famous clash of the and the at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hampton%20Roads">Battle of Hampton Roads</a> at least eight navies possessed ironclad ships.
Navies experimented with the positioning of guns, in <a href="Gun%20turret">turrets</a> (like the USS "Monitor"), <a href="central%20battery%20ship">central-batteries</a> or <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s, or with the <a href="naval%20ram">ram</a> as the principal weapon. As steam technology developed, masts were gradually removed from battleship designs. By the mid-1870s <a href="steel">steel</a> was used as a construction material alongside iron and wood. The French Navy's , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876, was a central battery and barbette warship which became the first battleship in the world to use steel as the principal building material.

The term "battleship" was officially adopted by the Royal Navy in the re-classification of 1892. By the 1890s, there was an increasing similarity between battleship designs, and the type that later became known as the 'pre-dreadnought battleship' emerged. These were heavily armored ships, mounting a mixed battery of guns in turrets, and without sails. The typical first-class battleship of the pre-dreadnought era displaced 15,000 to 17,000 <a href="ton">ton</a>s, had a speed of , and an armament of four guns in two turrets fore and aft with a mixed-caliber secondary battery amidships around the superstructure. An early design with superficial similarity to the pre-dreadnought is the British of 1871.

The slow-firing main guns were the principal weapons for battleship-to-battleship combat. The intermediate and secondary batteries had two roles. Against major ships, it was thought a 'hail of fire' from quick-firing secondary weapons could distract enemy gun crews by inflicting damage to the superstructure, and they would be more effective against smaller ships such as <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s. Smaller guns (12-pounders and smaller) were reserved for protecting the battleship against the threat of torpedo attack from <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s and <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s.

The beginning of the pre-dreadnought era coincided with Britain reasserting her naval dominance. For many years previously, Britain had taken naval supremacy for granted. Expensive naval projects were criticised by political leaders of all inclinations. However, in 1888 a war scare with France and the build-up of the Russian navy gave added impetus to naval construction, and the British Naval Defence Act of 1889 laid down a new fleet including eight new battleships. The principle that Britain's navy should be more powerful than the two next most powerful fleets combined was established. This policy was designed to deter France and Russia from building more battleships, but both nations nevertheless expanded their fleets with more and better pre-dreadnoughts in the 1890s.
In the last years of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th, the escalation in the building of battleships became an <a href="arms%20race">arms race</a> between Britain and <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a>. The German naval laws of 1890 and 1898 authorised a fleet of 38 battleships, a vital threat to the balance of naval power. Britain answered with further shipbuilding, but by the end of the pre-dreadnought era, British supremacy at sea had markedly weakened. In 1883, the United Kingdom had 38 battleships, twice as many as France and almost as many as the rest of the world put together. By 1897, Britain's lead was far smaller due to competition from France, Germany, and Russia, as well as the development of pre-dreadnought fleets in Italy, the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japan</a>. Turkey, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="Chile">Chile</a> and <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> all had second-rate fleets led by <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s, <a href="coastal%20defence%20ship">coastal defence ship</a>s or <a href="monitor%20%28warship%29">monitors</a>.

Pre-dreadnoughts continued the technical innovations of the ironclad. Turrets, armor plate, and <a href="steam%20engine">steam engine</a>s were all improved over the years, and <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> tubes were introduced. A small number of designs, including the American and es, experimented with all or part of the 8-inch intermediate battery superimposed over the 12-inch primary. Results were poor: recoil factors and blast effects resulted in the 8-inch battery being completely unusable, and the inability to train the primary and intermediate armaments on different targets led to significant tactical limitations. Even though such innovative designs saved weight (a key reason for their inception), they proved too cumbersome in practice.

In 1906, the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> launched the revolutionary . Created as a result of pressure from Admiral <a href="John%20Fisher%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fisher">Sir John ("Jackie") Fisher</a>, HMS "Dreadnought" made existing battleships obsolete. Combining an "all-big-gun" armament of ten 12-inch (305 mm) guns with unprecedented speed (from steam turbine engines) and protection, she prompted navies worldwide to re-evaluate their battleship building programs. While the Japanese had laid down an all-big-gun battleship, , in 1904 and the concept of an all-big-gun ship had been in circulation for several years, it had yet to be validated in combat. "Dreadnought" sparked a new <a href="arms%20race">arms race</a>, principally between Britain and Germany but reflected worldwide, as the new class of warships became a crucial element of national power.

Technical development continued rapidly through the dreadnought era, with steep changes in armament, armor and propulsion. Ten years after "Dreadnought"s commissioning, much more powerful ships, the super-dreadnoughts, were being built.

In the first years of the 20th century, several navies worldwide experimented with the idea of a new type of battleship with a uniform armament of very heavy guns.

Admiral <a href="Vittorio%20Cuniberti">Vittorio Cuniberti</a>, the Italian Navy's chief naval architect, articulated the concept of an all-big-gun battleship in 1903. When the "<a href="Regia%20Marina">Regia Marina</a>" did not pursue his ideas, Cuniberti wrote an article in <a href="Jane%27s%20Fighting%20Ships">"Janes"</a> proposing an "ideal" future British battleship, a large armored warship of 17,000 tons, armed solely with a single calibre main battery (twelve 12-inch {305 mm} guns), carrying <a href="belt%20armor">belt armor</a>, and capable of 24 <a href="knot%20%28unit%29">knots</a> (44 km/h).

The <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> provided operational experience to validate the 'all-big-gun' concept. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Yellow%20Sea">Yellow Sea</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Tsushima</a>, pre-dreadnoughts exchanged volleys at ranges of 7,600–12,000 yd (7 to 11 km), beyond the range of the secondary batteries. It is often held that these engagements demonstrated the importance of the gun over its smaller counterparts, though some historians take the view that secondary batteries were just as important as the larger weapons.

In Japan, the two battleships of the 1903-4 Programme were the first to be laid down as all-big-gun designs, with eight 12-inch guns. However, the design had armor which was considered too thin, demanding a substantial redesign. The financial pressures of the Russo-Japanese War and the short supply of 12-inch guns which had to be imported from Britain meant these ships were completed with a mixed 10- and 12-inch armament. The 1903-4 design also retained traditional <a href="Compound%20engine">triple-expansion steam engine</a>s.
As early as 1904, Jackie Fisher had been convinced of the need for fast, powerful ships with an all-big-gun armament. If Tsushima influenced his thinking, it was to persuade him of the need to standardise on guns. Fisher's concerns were <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s and <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s equipped with torpedoes, then threatening to outrange battleship guns, making speed imperative for <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s. Fisher's preferred option was his brainchild, the <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>: lightly armored but heavily armed with eight 12-inch guns and propelled to by <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s.

It was to prove this revolutionary technology that "Dreadnought" was designed in January 1905, laid down in October 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten 12-inch guns, had an 11-inch armor belt, and was the first large ship powered by turbines. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three on the centerline (one forward, two aft) and two on the <a href="Gun%20turret">wings</a>, giving her at her launch twice the <a href="broadside">broadside</a> of any other warship. She retained a number of 12-pound (3-inch, 76 mm) <a href="British%20ordnance%20terms%23QF">quick-firing</a> guns for use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armor was heavy enough for her to go head-to-head with any other ship in a gun battle, and conceivably win.
"Dreadnought" was to have been followed by three s, their construction delayed to allow lessons from "Dreadnought" to be used in their design. While Fisher may have intended "Dreadnought" to be the last Royal Navy battleship, the design was so successful he found little support for his plan to switch to a battlecruiser navy. Although there were some problems with the ship (the wing turrets had limited arcs of fire and strained the hull when firing a full broadside, and the top of the thickest armor belt lay below the waterline at full load), the Royal Navy promptly commissioned another six ships to a similar design in the and es.

An American design, , authorized in 1905 and laid down in December 1906, was another of the first dreadnoughts, but she and her sister, , were not launched until 1908. Both used triple-expansion engines and had a superior layout of the main battery, dispensing with "Dreadnought"s wing turrets. They thus retained the same broadside, despite having two fewer guns.

In 1897, before the revolution in design brought about by HMS "Dreadnought", the Royal Navy had 62 battleships in commission or building, a lead of 26 over France and 50 over Germany. In 1906, the Royal Navy owned the field with "Dreadnought". The new class of ship prompted an arms race with major strategic consequences. Major naval powers raced to build their own dreadnoughts. Possession of modern battleships was not only seen as vital to naval power, but also, as with nuclear weapons after WWII, represented a nation's standing in the world. <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, Italy, Austria, and the United States all began dreadnought programmes; while Ottoman Turkey, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.

The battleship, particularly the dreadnought, was the dominant naval weapon of the World War I era. There were few serious challenges at that time. The most significant naval battles of World War I, such as Jutland (May 31, 1916 – June 1, 1916), were fought by battleships and their battlecruiser cousins.
By virtue of geography, the Royal Navy was able to use her imposing battleship and battlecruiser fleet to impose a strict and successful naval blockade of Germany and kept <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">Germany's smaller battleship fleet</a> bottled up in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>: only narrow channels led to the Atlantic Ocean and these were guarded by British forces. Both sides were aware that, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, a full fleet engagement would be likely to result in a British victory. The German strategy was therefore to try to provoke an engagement on their terms: either to induce a part of the Grand Fleet to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coastline, where friendly minefields, torpedo-boats and submarines could be used to even the odds. Germany's submarines were able to break out and raid commerce, but even though they sank many merchant ships, they could not successfully blockade Great Britain – in contrast to Britain's successful battleship blockade of Germany, which was a major cause of Germany's economic collapse in 1918. The Royal Navy on the other hand, successfully adopted convoy tactics to combat Germany's submarine blockade and eventually defeated it.
The first two years of war saw the Royal Navy's battleships and battlecruisers regularly "sweep" the North Sea making sure that no German ships could get in or out. Only a few German surface ships that were already at sea, such as the famous light cruiser , were able to raid commerce. Even some of those that did manage to get out were hunted down by battlecruisers, as in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Falklands">Battle of the Falklands</a>, December 7, 1914. The results of sweeping actions in the North Sea were battles such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20%281914%29">Heligoland Bight</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Dogger Bank</a> and German raids on the English coast, all of which were attempts by the Germans to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet in an attempt to defeat the Royal Navy in detail. On May 31, 1916, a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on German terms resulted in a clash of the battlefleets in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>. The German fleet withdrew to port after two short encounters with the British fleet. Less than two months later, the Germans once again attempted to draw portions of the Grand Fleet into battle. The resulting <a href="Action%20of%2019%20August%201916">Action of 19 August 1916</a> proved inconclusive. This reinforced German determination not to engage in a fleet to fleet battle.
In the other naval theatres there were no decisive pitched battles. In the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, engagement between <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian</a> and <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Turkish</a> battleships was restricted to skirmishes. In the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, action was largely limited to the raiding of convoys, and the laying of defensive minefields; the only significant clash of battleship squadrons there was the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moon%20Sound">Battle of Moon Sound</a> at which one Russian pre-dreadnought was lost. The <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a> was in a sense the mirror of the North Sea: the <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austro-Hungarian</a> dreadnought fleet remained bottled up by the British and French blockade. And in the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a>, the most important use of battleships was in support of the amphibious assault on <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli</a>.

In September 1914, the threat posed to surface ships by German U-boats was confirmed by successful attacks on British cruisers, including the sinking of three British <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s by the German submarine in less than an hour. The British Super-dreadnought HMS "Audacious" soon followed suit as she struck a mine laid by a German U-boat in October 1914 and sank. The threat that German U-boats posed to British dreadnoughts was enough to cause the Royal Navy to change their strategy and tactics in the North Sea to reduce the risk of U-boat attack. Further near-misses from submarine attacks on battleships and casualties amongst cruisers led to growing concern in the Royal Navy about the vulnerability of battleships.

As the war wore on however, it turned out that whilst submarines did prove to be an incredibly dangerous threat to older pre-dreadnought battleships, as shown by examples such as the sinking of the , which was caught in the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> by a British submarine and the and were torpedoed by "U-21" as well as , , etc., the threat posed to dreadnought battleships proved to have been largely a false alarm. HMS "Audacious" turned out to have been the only dreadnought sunk by a submarine in World War I. While battleships were never intended for anti-submarine warfare, there was one instance of a submarine being sunk by a dreadnought battleship. HMS "Dreadnought" rammed and sank the German U-29 on March 18, 1915 off Moray Firth.
Whilst the escape of the German fleet from the superior British firepower at Jutland was effected by the German cruisers and destroyers successfully turning away the British battleships, the German attempt to rely on U-boat attacks on the British fleet failed.

Torpedo boats did have some successes against battleships in World War I, as demonstrated by the sinking of the British pre-dreadnought by during the Dardanelles Campaign and the destruction of the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Navy">Austro-Hungarian</a> dreadnought by <a href="Regia%20Marina">Italian</a> <a href="motor%20torpedo%20boats">motor torpedo boats</a> in June 1918. In large fleet actions, however, destroyers and torpedo boats were usually unable to get close enough to the battleships to damage them. The only battleship sunk in a fleet action by either torpedo boats or destroyers was the obsolescent German pre-dreadnought . She was sunk by destroyers during the night phase of the Battle of Jutland.

The German High Seas Fleet, for their part, were determined not to engage the British without the assistance of submarines; and since the submarines were needed more for raiding commercial traffic, the fleet stayed in port for much of the war.

For many years, <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Germany</a> simply had no battleships. The <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany%20%28Compi%C3%A8gne%29">Armistice with Germany</a> required that most of the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> by their German crews on June 21, 1919 just before the signature of the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a>s.
The inter-war period saw the battleship subjected to strict international limitations to prevent a costly arms race breaking out.
While the victors were not limited by the Treaty of Versailles, many of the major naval powers were crippled after the war. Faced with the prospect of a naval arms race against the United Kingdom and Japan, which would in turn have led to a possible Pacific war, the United States was keen to conclude the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> of 1922. This treaty limited the number and size of battleships that each major nation could possess, and required Britain to accept parity with the U.S. and to abandon the British alliance with Japan. The Washington treaty was followed by a series of other naval treaties, including the <a href="Geneva%20Naval%20Conference">First Geneva Naval Conference</a> (1927), the <a href="London%20Naval%20Treaty">First London Naval Treaty</a> (1930), the <a href="Second%20Geneva%20Naval%20Conference">Second Geneva Naval Conference</a> (1932), and finally the <a href="Second%20London%20Naval%20Treaty">Second London Naval Treaty</a> (1936), which all set limits on major warships. These treaties became effectively obsolete on September 1, 1939 at the beginning of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, but the ship classifications that had been agreed upon still apply. The treaty limitations meant that fewer new battleships were launched in 1919–39 than in 1905–14. The treaties also inhibited development by putting maximum limits on the weights of ships. Designs like the projected British , the first American , and the Japanese —all of which continued the trend to larger ships with bigger guns and thicker armor—never got off the drawing board. Those designs which were commissioned during this period were referred to as <a href="treaty%20battleship">treaty battleship</a>s.

As early as 1914, the British Admiral <a href="Percy%20Scott">Percy Scott</a> predicted that battleships would soon be made irrelevant by <a href="military%20aviation">aircraft</a>. By the end of World War I, aircraft had successfully adopted the <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> as a weapon. In 1921 the Italian general and air theorist <a href="Giulio%20Douhet">Giulio Douhet</a> completed a hugely influential treatise on strategic bombing titled "The Command of the Air", which foresaw the dominance of air power over naval units.

In the 1920s, General <a href="Billy%20Mitchell">Billy Mitchell</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Corps">United States Army Air Corps</a>, believing that air forces had rendered navies around the world obsolete, testified in front of Congress that "1,000 bombardment airplanes can be built and operated for about the price of one battleship" and that a squadron of these bombers could sink a battleship, making for more efficient use of government funds. This infuriated the U.S. Navy, but Mitchell was nevertheless allowed to conduct a careful series of bombing tests alongside Navy and <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marine</a> bombers. In 1921, he bombed and sank numerous ships, including the "unsinkable" German World War I battleship and the American pre-dreadnought .

Although Mitchell had required "war-time conditions", the ships sunk were obsolete, stationary, defenseless and had no damage control. The sinking of "Ostfriesland" was accomplished by violating an agreement that would have allowed Navy engineers to examine the effects of various munitions: Mitchell's airmen disregarded the rules, and sank the ship within minutes in a coordinated attack. The stunt made headlines, and Mitchell declared, "No surface vessels can exist wherever air forces acting from land bases are able to attack them." While far from conclusive, Mitchell's test was significant because it put proponents of the battleship against naval aviation on the back foot. Rear Admiral <a href="William%20A.%20Moffett">William A. Moffett</a> used public relations against Mitchell to make headway toward expansion of the U.S. Navy's nascent aircraft carrier program.

The <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>, and <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> extensively upgraded and modernized their World War I–era battleships during the 1930s. Among the new features were an increased tower height and stability for the optical rangefinder equipment (for gunnery control), more armor (especially around turrets) to protect against plunging fire and aerial bombing, and additional anti-aircraft weapons. Some British ships received a large block superstructure nicknamed the "Queen Anne's castle", such as in the and , which would be used in the new conning towers of the <a href="fast%20battleship">fast battleship</a>s. External bulges were added to improve both buoyancy to counteract weight increase and provide underwater protection against mines and torpedoes. The Japanese rebuilt all of their battleships, plus their battlecruisers, with distinctive "<a href="pagoda">pagoda</a>" structures, though the received a more modern bridge tower that would influence the new . Bulges were fitted, including steel tube arrays to improve both underwater and vertical protection along the waterline. The U.S. experimented with <a href="Lattice%20mast">cage masts</a> and later <a href="tripod%20mast">tripod mast</a>s, though after the Japanese <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> some of the most severely damaged ships (such as and ) were rebuilt with tower masts, for an appearance similar to their contemporaries. Radar, which was effective beyond visual range and effective in complete darkness or adverse weather, was introduced to supplement optical fire control.

Even when war threatened again in the late 1930s, battleship construction did not regain the level of importance it had held in the years before World War I. The "building holiday" imposed by the naval treaties meant the capacity of dockyards worldwide had shrunk, and the strategic position had changed.

In <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a>, the ambitious <a href="Plan%20Z">Plan Z</a> for naval rearmament was abandoned in favor of a strategy of submarine warfare supplemented by the use of battlecruisers and <a href="commerce%20raiding">commerce raiding</a> (in particular by s). In Britain, the most pressing need was for air defenses and convoy escorts to safeguard the civilian population from bombing or starvation, and re-armament construction plans consisted of five ships of the . It was in the Mediterranean that navies remained most committed to battleship warfare. France intended to build six battleships of the and es, and the Italians four ships. Neither navy built significant aircraft carriers. The U.S. preferred to spend limited funds on aircraft carriers until the . Japan, also prioritising aircraft carriers, nevertheless began work on three mammoth "Yamato"s (although the third, , was later completed as a carrier) and a planned fourth was cancelled.

At the outbreak of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Spanish</a> navy consisted of only two small dreadnought battleships, and . "España" (originally named "Alfonso XIII"), by then in reserve at the northwestern naval base of <a href="Ferrol%2C%20Spain">El Ferrol</a>, fell into <a href="Spain%20under%20Franco">Nationalist</a> hands in July 1936. The crew aboard "Jaime I" remained loyal to the Republic, killed their officers, who apparently supported Franco's attempted coup, and joined the Republican Navy. Thus each side had one battleship; however, the Republican Navy generally lacked experienced officers. The Spanish battleships mainly restricted themselves to mutual blockades, convoy escort duties, and shore bombardment, rarely in direct fighting against other surface units. In April 1937, "España" ran into a mine laid by friendly forces, and sank with little loss of life. In May 1937, "Jaime I" was damaged by Nationalist air attacks and a grounding incident. The ship was forced to go back to port to be repaired. There she was again hit by several aerial bombs. It was then decided to tow the battleship to a more secure port, but during the transport she suffered an internal explosion that caused 300 deaths and her total loss. Several Italian and German capital ships participated in the non-intervention blockade. On May 29, 1937, two Republican aircraft managed to bomb the German pocket battleship outside <a href="Ibiza">Ibiza</a>, causing severe damage and loss of life. retaliated two days later by bombarding <a href="Almer%C3%ADa">Almería</a>, causing much destruction, and the resulting <a href="Deutschland%20incident%20%281937%29">"Deutschland" incident</a> meant the end of German and Italian support for non-intervention.

The —an obsolete <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a>—fired the first shots of World War II with the bombardment of the Polish garrison at <a href="Westerplatte">Westerplatte</a>; and the final surrender of the Japanese Empire took place aboard a United States Navy battleship, . Between those two events, it had become clear that aircraft carriers were the new principal ships of the fleet and that battleships now performed a secondary role.

Battleships played a part in major engagements in Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean theaters; in the Atlantic, the Germans used their battleships as independent commerce raiders. However, clashes between battleships were of little strategic importance. The <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a> was fought between destroyers and submarines, and most of the decisive fleet clashes of the Pacific war were determined by <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s.

In the first year of the war, armored warships defied predictions that aircraft would dominate naval warfare. and surprised and sank the aircraft carrier off western <a href="Norway">Norway</a> in June 1940. This engagement marked the last time a fleet carrier was sunk by surface gunnery. In the <a href="attack%20on%20Mers-el-K%C3%A9bir">attack on Mers-el-Kébir</a>, British battleships opened fire on the French battleships in the harbor near Oran in Algeria with their heavy guns, and later pursued fleeing French ships with planes from aircraft carriers.

The subsequent years of the war saw many demonstrations of the maturity of the aircraft carrier as a strategic naval weapon and its potential against battleships. The British air attack on the Italian naval base at <a href="Battle%20of%20Taranto">Taranto</a> sank one Italian battleship and damaged two more. The same <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Swordfish</a> torpedo bombers played a crucial role in sinking the German commerce-raider .
On December 7, 1941, the Japanese launched a surprise <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>. Within a short time five of eight U.S. battleships were sunk or sinking, with the rest damaged. The American aircraft carriers were out to sea, however, and evaded detection. They took up the fight, and eventually turned the tide of the war in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>. The <a href="Sinking%20of%20Prince%20of%20Wales%20and%20Repulse">sinking</a> of the British battleship and her escort, the battlecruiser , demonstrated the vulnerability of a battleship to air attack while at sea without sufficient air cover, settling the argument begun by Mitchell in 1921. Both warships were under way and en route to attack the Japanese amphibious force that had invaded <a href="Battle%20of%20Malaya">Malaya</a> when they were caught by Japanese land-based <a href="bomber">bomber</a>s and <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s on December 10, 1941.

At many of the early crucial battles of the Pacific, for instance <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Coral%20Sea">Coral Sea</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Midway">Midway</a>, battleships were either absent or overshadowed as carriers launched wave after wave of planes into the attack at a range of hundreds of miles. In later battles in the Pacific, battleships primarily performed shore bombardment in support of amphibious landings and provided anti-aircraft defense as escort for the carriers. Even the largest battleships ever constructed, Japan's , which carried a main battery of nine 18-inch (46 cm) guns and were designed as a principal strategic weapon, were never given a chance to show their potential in the decisive battleship action that figured in <a href="Kantai%20Kessen">Japanese pre-war planning</a>.

The last battleship confrontation in history was the <a href="Battle%20of%20Surigao%20Strait">Battle of Surigao Strait</a>, on October 25, 1944, in which a numerically and technically superior American battleship group destroyed a lesser Japanese battleship group by gunfire after it had already been devastated by destroyer torpedo attacks. All but one of the American battleships in this confrontation had previously been sunk during the attack on <a href="Naval%20Station%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> and subsequently raised and repaired. When fired the last <a href="salvo">salvo</a> of this battle, the last salvo fired by a battleship against another heavy ship, she was "firing a funeral salute to a finished era of naval warfare." In April 1945, during the battle for <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>, the world's most powerful battleship, the "Yamato", was sent out on <a href="Operation%20Ten-Go">a suicide mission</a> against a massive U.S. force and sunk by overwhelming pressure from carrier aircraft with nearly all hands lost.

After World War II, several navies retained their existing battleships, but they were no longer strategically dominant military assets. Indeed, it soon became apparent that they were no longer worth the considerable cost of construction and maintenance and only one new battleship was commissioned after the war, . During the war it had been demonstrated that battleship-on-battleship engagements like <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Leyte Gulf</a> or the sinking of were the exception and not the rule, and with the growing role of aircraft engagement ranges were becoming longer and longer, making heavy gun armament irrelevant. The armor of a battleship was equally irrelevant in the face of a <a href="nuclear%20warfare">nuclear attack</a> as tactical missiles with a range of or more could be mounted on the Soviet and s. By the end of the 1950s, smaller vessel classes such as destroyers, which formerly offered no noteworthy opposition to battleships, now were capable of eliminating battleships from outside the range of the ship's heavy guns.

The remaining battleships met a variety of ends. and were sunk during the testing of nuclear weapons in <a href="Operation%20Crossroads">Operation Crossroads</a> in 1946. Both battleships proved resistant to nuclear air burst but vulnerable to underwater nuclear explosions. The was taken by the Soviets as reparations and renamed "Novorossiysk"; she was sunk by a leftover German mine in the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> on October 29, 1955. The two ships were scrapped in 1956. The French was scrapped in 1954, in 1968, and in 1970.

The United Kingdom's four surviving ships were scrapped in 1957, and followed in 1960. All other surviving British battleships had been sold or broken up by 1949. The Soviet Union's was scrapped in 1953, in 1957 and (back under her original name, , since 1942) in 1956-7. Brazil's was scrapped in Genoa in 1953, and her sister ship sank during a storm in the Atlantic "en route" to the breakers in Italy in 1951.

Argentina kept its two ships until 1956 and Chile kept (formerly ) until 1959. The <a href="Turkey">Turkish</a> battlecruiser (formerly , launched in 1911) was scrapped in 1976 after an offer to sell her back to Germany was refused. Sweden had several small coastal-defense battleships, one of which, , survived until 1970. The Soviets scrapped four large incomplete cruisers in the late 1950s, whilst plans to build a number of new s were abandoned following the death of <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> in 1953. The three old German battleships , , and all met similar ends. "Hessen" was taken over by the Soviet Union and renamed "Tsel". She was scrapped in 1960. "Schleswig-Holstein" was renamed "Borodino", and was used as a target ship until 1960. "Schlesien", too, was used as a target ship. She was broken up between 1952 and 1957.
The s gained a new lease of life in the U.S. Navy as fire support ships. <a href="Radar">Radar</a> and computer-controlled gunfire could be aimed with pinpoint accuracy to target. The U.S. recommissioned all four "Iowa"-class battleships for the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> and the for the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. These were primarily used for shore bombardment, "New Jersey" firing nearly 6,000 rounds of 16 inch shells and over 14,000 rounds of 5 inch projectiles during her tour on the gunline, seven times more rounds against shore targets in Vietnam than she had fired in the Second World War.

As part of <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Navy Secretary</a> <a href="John%20F.%20Lehman">John F. Lehman</a>'s effort to build a <a href="600-ship%20Navy">600-ship Navy</a> in the 1980s, and in response to the commissioning of "<a href="Soviet%20battlecruiser%20Kirov">Kirov</a>" by the Soviet Union, the United States recommissioned all four "Iowa"-class battleships. On several occasions, battleships were support ships in <a href="carrier%20battle%20group">carrier battle group</a>s, or led their own <a href="battleship%20battle%20group">battleship battle group</a>. These were modernized to carry <a href="Tomahawk%20missile">Tomahawk missile</a>s, with "New Jersey" seeing action bombarding <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a> in 1983 and 1984, while and fired their 16-inch (406 mm) guns at land targets and launched missiles during <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Storm">Operation Desert Storm</a> in 1991. "Wisconsin" served as the <a href="BGM-109%20Tomahawk">TLAM</a> strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of "Desert Storm", firing a total of 24 TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. The primary threat to the battleships were Iraqi shore based surface-to-surface missiles; "Missouri" was targeted by two <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>i <a href="Silkworm%20missile">Silkworm missile</a>s, with one missing and another being intercepted by the British destroyer .

All four "Iowa" ships were decommissioned in the early 1990s, making them the last battleships to see active service. and were maintained to a standard where they could be rapidly returned to service as fire support vessels, pending the development of a superior fire support vessel. These last two battleships were finally stricken from the U.S. <a href="Naval%20Vessel%20Register">Naval Vessel Register</a> in 2006. The Military Balance and Russian states the U.S. Navy listed one battleship in the reserve (Naval Inactive Fleet/Reserve 2nd Turn) in 2010. The Military Balance states the U.S. Navy listed no battleships in the reserve in 2014. The U.S. Marine Corps believes that the current naval surface fire support gun and missile programs will not be able to provide adequate fire support for an <a href="amphibious%20warfare">amphibious assault</a> or onshore operations.

With the decommissioning of the last "Iowa"-class ships, no battleships remain in service or in reserve with any navy worldwide. A number are preserved as <a href="museum%20ship">museum ship</a>s, either afloat or in drydock. The U.S. has eight battleships on display: , , , , , , , and . "Missouri" and "New Jersey" are museums at <a href="Naval%20Station%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> and <a href="Camden%2C%20New%20Jersey">Camden, New Jersey</a>, respectively. "Iowa" is on display as an educational attraction at the Los Angeles Waterfront in <a href="San%20Pedro%2C%20California">San Pedro, California</a>. "Wisconsin" now serves as a museum ship in <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>. "Massachusetts", which has the distinction of never having lost a man during service, is on display at the <a href="Battleship%20Cove">Battleship Cove</a> naval museum in <a href="Fall%20River%2C%20Massachusetts">Fall River, Massachusetts</a>. "Texas", the first battleship turned into a museum, is on display at the <a href="San%20Jacinto%20Battleground%20State%20Historic%20Site">San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site</a>, near <a href="Houston">Houston</a>. "North Carolina" is on display in <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington, North Carolina</a>. "Alabama" is on display in <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>. The wreck of the , sunk during the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, is designated a historical landmark and national gravesite.

The only other 20th-century battleship on display is the Japanese pre-dreadnought . A replica of the <a href="Chinese%20ironclad%20Dingyuan">Chinese ironclad Dingyuan</a> was built by the Weihai Port Bureau in 2003 and is on display in <a href="Weihai">Weihai</a>, <a href="China">China</a>.

Battleships were the embodiment of <a href="sea%20power">sea power</a>. For <a href="Alfred%20Thayer%20Mahan">Alfred Thayer Mahan</a> and his followers, a strong navy was vital to the success of a nation, and control of the seas was vital for the projection of force on land and overseas. Mahan's theory, proposed in "<a href="The%20Influence%20of%20Sea%20Power%20upon%20History">The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660–1783</a>" of 1890, dictated the role of the battleship was to sweep the enemy from the seas. While the work of escorting, <a href="blockade">blockading</a>, and raiding might be done by <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s or smaller vessels, the presence of the battleship was a potential threat to any convoy escorted by any vessels other than capital ships. This concept of "potential threat" can be further generalized to the mere existence (as opposed to presence) of a powerful fleet tying the opposing fleet down. This concept came to be known as a "<a href="fleet%20in%20being">fleet in being</a>" – an idle yet mighty fleet forcing others to spend time, resource and effort to actively guard against it.

Mahan went on to say victory could only be achieved by engagements between battleships, which came to be known as the "decisive battle" doctrine in some navies, while targeting merchant ships (<a href="commerce%20raiding">commerce raiding</a> or "guerre de course", as posited by the "<a href="Jeune%20%C3%89cole">Jeune École</a>") could never succeed.

Mahan was highly influential in naval and political circles throughout the age of the battleship, calling for a large fleet of the most powerful battleships possible. Mahan's work developed in the late 1880s, and by the end of the 1890s it had a massive international influence, in the end adopted by many major navies (notably the British, American, German, and Japanese). The strength of Mahanian opinion was important in the development of the battleships arms races, and equally important in the agreement of the Powers to limit battleship numbers in the interwar era.

The "fleet in being" suggested battleships could simply by their existence tie down superior enemy resources. This in turn was believed to be able to tip the balance of a conflict even without a battle. This suggested even for inferior naval powers a battleship fleet could have important strategic effect.

While the role of battleships in both World Wars reflected Mahanian doctrine, the details of battleship deployment were more complex. Unlike <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a>, the battleships of the late 19th and early 20th centuries had significant vulnerability to torpedoes and mines —because efficient mines & torpedoes didn't exist before that— which could be used by relatively small and inexpensive craft. The "Jeune École" doctrine of the 1870s and 1880s recommended placing <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s alongside battleships; these would hide behind the larger ships until gun-smoke obscured visibility enough for them to dart out and fire their torpedoes. While this tactic was vitiated by the development of smokeless propellant, the threat from more capable torpedo craft (later including submarines) remained. By the 1890s, the Royal Navy had developed the first <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, which were initially designed to intercept and drive off any attacking torpedo boats. During the First World War and subsequently, battleships were rarely deployed without a protective screen of destroyers.

Battleship doctrine emphasised the concentration of the battlegroup. In order for this concentrated force to be able to bring its power to bear on a reluctant opponent (or to avoid an encounter with a stronger enemy fleet), battlefleets needed some means of locating enemy ships beyond horizon range. This was provided by scouting forces; at various stages <a href="battlecruisers">battlecruisers</a>, <a href="cruisers">cruisers</a>, destroyers, <a href="airship">airship</a>s, submarines and aircraft were all used. (With the development of radio, <a href="direction%20finding">direction finding</a> and <a href="traffic%20analysis">traffic analysis</a> would come into play, as well, so even shore stations, broadly speaking, joined the battlegroup.) So for most of their history, battleships operated surrounded by squadrons of destroyers and cruisers. The North Sea campaign of the First World War illustrates how, despite this support, the threat of mine and torpedo attack, and the failure to integrate or appreciate the capabilities of new techniques, seriously inhibited the operations of the Royal Navy Grand Fleet, the greatest battleship fleet of its time.

The presence of battleships had a great psychological and diplomatic impact. Similar to possessing <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s today, the ownership of battleships served to enhance a nation's force projection.

Even during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, the psychological impact of a battleship was significant. In 1946, USS "Missouri" was dispatched to deliver the remains of the ambassador from Turkey, and her presence in Turkish and <a href="Greece">Greek</a> waters staved off a possible Soviet thrust into the <a href="Balkans">Balkan</a> region. In September 1983, when <a href="Druze">Druze</a> militia in <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>'s Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS "New Jersey" stopped the firing. Gunfire from "New Jersey" later killed militia leaders.

Battleships were the largest and most complex, and hence the most expensive warships of their time; as a result, the value of investment in battleships has always been contested. As the French politician Etienne Lamy wrote in 1879, "The construction of battleships is so costly, their effectiveness so uncertain and of such short duration, that the enterprise of creating an armored fleet seems to leave fruitless the perseverance of a people". The "<a href="Jeune%20%C3%89cole">Jeune École</a>" school of thought of the 1870s and 1880s sought alternatives to the crippling expense and debatable utility of a conventional battlefleet. It proposed what would nowadays be termed a <a href="sea%20denial">sea denial</a> strategy, based on fast, long-ranged cruisers for commerce raiding and torpedo boat flotillas to attack enemy ships attempting to blockade French ports. The ideas of the "Jeune École" were ahead of their time; it was not until the 20th century that efficient mines, torpedoes, submarines, and aircraft were available that allowed similar ideas to be effectively implemented. The determination of powers such as <a href="German%20Empire">Germany</a> to build battlefleets with which to confront much stronger rivals has been criticised by historians, who emphasise the futility of investment in a battlefleet that has no chance of matching its opponent in an actual battle.

Bifröst

In <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>, Bifröst ( or sometimes Bilröst or Bivrost) is a burning <a href="rainbow">rainbow</a> bridge that reaches between <a href="Midgard">Midgard</a> (Earth) and <a href="Asgard">Asgard</a>, the realm of the <a href="%C3%86sir">gods</a>. The bridge is attested as "Bilröst" in the "<a href="Poetic%20Edda">Poetic Edda</a>"; compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and as "Bifröst" in the "<a href="Prose%20Edda">Prose Edda</a>"; written in the 13th century by <a href="Snorri%20Sturluson">Snorri Sturluson</a>, and in the poetry of <a href="skald">skald</a>s. Both the "Poetic Edda" and the "Prose Edda" alternately refer to the bridge as Ásbrú (<a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> "<a href="%C3%86sir">Æsir</a>'s bridge").

According to the "Prose Edda", the bridge ends in heaven at <a href="Himinbj%C3%B6rg">Himinbjörg</a>, the residence of the god <a href="Heimdallr">Heimdallr</a>, who guards it from the <a href="J%C3%B6tunn">jötnar</a>. The bridge's destruction during <a href="Ragnar%C3%B6k">Ragnarök</a> by the forces of <a href="M%C3%BAspellsheimr">Muspell</a> is foretold. Scholars have proposed that the bridge may have originally represented the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> and have noted parallels between the bridge and another bridge in Norse mythology, <a href="Gjallarbr%C3%BA">Gjallarbrú</a>.

Scholar <a href="Andy%20Orchard">Andy Orchard</a> posits that "Bifröst" may mean "shimmering path." He notes that the first element of "Bilröst"—"bil" (meaning "a moment")—"suggests the fleeting nature of the rainbow," which he connects to the first element of "Bifröst"—the <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> verb "bifa" (meaning "to shimmer" or "to shake")—noting that the element evokes notions of the "lustrous sheen" of the bridge. Austrian Germanist <a href="Rudolf%20Simek">Rudolf Simek</a> says that "Bifröst" either means "the swaying road to heaven" (also citing "bifa") or, if "Bilröst" is the original form of the two (which Simek says is likely), "the fleetingly glimpsed rainbow" (possibly connected to "<a href="Hjuki%20and%20Bil">bil</a>", perhaps meaning "moment, weak point").

Two poems in the "Poetic Edda" and two books in the "Prose Edda" provide information about the bridge:

In the "Poetic Edda", the bridge is mentioned in the poems "<a href="Gr%C3%ADmnism%C3%A1l">Grímnismál</a>" and "<a href="F%C3%A1fnism%C3%A1l">Fáfnismál</a>", where it is referred to as "Bilröst". In one of two stanzas in the poem "<a href="Gr%C3%ADmnism%C3%A1l">Grímnismál</a>" that mentions the bridge, <a href="List%20of%20names%20of%20Odin">Grímnir</a> (the god <a href="Odin">Odin</a> in disguise) provides the young <a href="Agnarr%20Geirr%C3%B6%C3%B0sson">Agnarr</a> with cosmological knowledge, including that Bilröst is the best of bridges. Later in "Grímnismál", Grímnir notes that Asbrú "burns all with flames" and that, every day, the god <a href="Thor">Thor</a> wades through the waters of <a href="K%C3%B6rmt%20and%20%C3%96rmt">Körmt and Örmt</a> and the two <a href="Kerlaugar">Kerlaugar</a>:

In "Fáfnismál", the dying <a href="wyrm%20%28dragon%29">wyrm</a> <a href="Fafnir">Fafnir</a> tells the hero <a href="Sigurd">Sigurd</a> that, during the events of Ragnarok, bearing spears, gods will meet at <a href="%C3%93sk%C3%B3pnir">Óskópnir</a>. From there, the gods will cross Bilröst, which will break apart as they cross over it, causing their horses to dredge through an immense river.

The bridge is mentioned in the "Prose Edda" books "<a href="Gylfaginning">Gylfaginning</a>" and "<a href="Sk%C3%A1ldskaparm%C3%A1l">Skáldskaparmál</a>", where it is referred to as "Bifröst". In chapter 13 of "Gylfaginning", <a href="Gylfi">Gangleri</a> (King <a href="Gylfi">Gylfi</a> in disguise) asks the enthroned figure of <a href="High%2C%20Just-As-High%2C%20and%20Third">High</a> what way exists between heaven and earth. Laughing, High replies that the question isn't an intelligent one, and goes on to explain that the gods built a bridge from heaven and earth. He incredulously asks Gangleri if he has not heard the story before. High says that Gangleri must have seen it, and notes that Gangleri may call it a <a href="rainbow">rainbow</a>. High says that the bridge consists of three colors, has great strength, "and is built with art and skill to a greater extent than other constructions."

High notes that, although the bridge is strong, it will break when "<a href="Muspelheim">Muspell</a>'s lads" attempt to cross it, and their horses will have to make do with swimming over "great rivers." Gangleri says that it doesn't seem that the gods "built the bridge in good faith if it is liable to break, considering that they can do as they please." High responds that the gods do not deserve blame for the breaking of the bridge, for "there is nothing in this world that will be secure when Muspell's sons attack."

In chapter 15 of "Gylfaginning", <a href="High%2C%20Just-As-High%2C%20and%20Third">Just-As-High</a> says that Bifröst is also called "Asbrú", and that every day the gods ride <a href="Horses%20of%20the%20%C3%86sir">their horses</a> across it (with the exception of Thor, who instead wades through the boiling waters of the rivers <a href="K%C3%B6rmt%20and%20%C3%96rmt">Körmt and Örmt</a>) to reach <a href="Ur%C3%B0arbrunnr">Urðarbrunnr</a>, a holy well where the gods have their court. As a reference, Just-As-High quotes the second of the two stanzas in "Grímnismál" that mention the bridge (see above). Gangleri asks if fire burns over Bifröst. High says that the red in the bridge is burning fire, and, without it, the frost jotnar and mountain jotnar would "go up into heaven" if anyone who wanted could cross Bifröst. High adds that, in heaven, "there are many beautiful places" and that "everywhere there has divine protection around it."

In chapter 17, High tells Gangleri that the location of <a href="Himinbj%C3%B6rg">Himinbjörg</a> "stands at the edge of heaven where Bifrost reaches heaven." While describing the god <a href="Heimdallr">Heimdallr</a> in chapter 27, High says that Heimdallr lives in Himinbjörg by Bifröst, and guards the bridge from mountain jotnar while sitting at the edge of heaven. In chapter 34, High quotes the first of the two "Grímnismál" stanzas that mention the bridge. In chapter 51, High foretells the events of <a href="Ragnar%C3%B6k">Ragnarök</a>. High says that, during Ragnarök, the sky will split open, and from the split will ride forth the "sons of <a href="Muspelheim">Muspell</a>". When the "sons of Muspell" ride over Bifröst it will break, "as was said above."

In the "Prose Edda" book "<a href="Sk%C3%A1ldskaparm%C3%A1l">Skáldskaparmál</a>", the bridge receives a single mention. In chapter 16, a work by the 10th century <a href="skald">skald</a> <a href="%C3%9Alfr%20Uggason">Úlfr Uggason</a> is provided, where Bifröst is referred to as "the powers' way."

In his translation of the "Prose Edda", <a href="Henry%20Adams%20Bellows%20%28businessman%29">Henry Adams Bellows</a> comments that the "Grímnismál" stanza mentioning Thor and the bridge stanza may mean that "Thor has to go on foot in the last days of the destruction, when the bridge is burning. Another interpretation, however, is that when Thor leaves the heavens (i.e., when a thunder-storm is over) the rainbow-bridge becomes hot in the sun."

<a href="John%20Lindow">John Lindow</a> points to a parallel between Bifröst, which he notes is "a bridge between earth and heaven, or earth and the world of the gods", and the bridge <a href="Gjallarbr%C3%BA">Gjallarbrú</a>, "a bridge between earth and the underworld, or earth and the world of the dead." Several scholars have proposed that Bifröst may represent the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>.

<doc id="4057" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4057" title="Battlecruiser">
Battlecruiser

The battlecruiser, or battle cruiser, was a type of <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a> of the first half of the 20th century. They were similar in size, cost, and armament to <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s, but they generally carried less armour in order to obtain faster speeds. The first battlecruisers were designed in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in the first decade of the century, as a development of the <a href="armoured%20cruiser">armoured cruiser</a>, at the same time as the <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a> succeeded the <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>. The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament, and chase down any ship with lesser armament; they were intended to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships. However, as more and more battlecruisers were built, they were increasingly used alongside the better-protected battleships.

Battlecruisers served in the navies of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">UK</a>, <a href="German%20Imperial%20Navy">Germany</a>, the <a href="Ottoman%20Navy">Ottoman Empire</a>, <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Australia</a> and <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Japan</a> during World War I, most notably at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">Battle of the Falkland Islands</a> and in the several raids and skirmishes in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> which culminated in a pitched fleet battle, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>. British battlecruisers in particular suffered heavy losses at Jutland, where their light armour made them very vulnerable to large-caliber shells. By the end of the war, capital ship design had developed with battleships becoming faster and battlecruisers becoming more heavily armoured, blurring the distinction between a battlecruiser and a <a href="fast%20battleship">fast battleship</a>. The <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>, which limited capital ship construction from 1922 onwards, treated battleships and battlecruisers identically, and the new generation of battlecruisers planned was scrapped under the terms of the treaty.

Improvements in armor design and propulsion created the 1930s "fast battleship" with the speed of a battlecruiser and armor of a battleship, making the battlecruiser in the traditional sense effectively an obsolete concept. Thus from the 1930s on, only the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> continued to use "battlecruiser" as a classification for the World War I–era capital ships that remained in the fleet; while Japan's battlecruisers remained in service, they had been significantly reconstructed and were re-rated as full-fledged fast battleships.

Battlecruisers were put into action again during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and only one survived to the end. There was also renewed interest in large "cruiser-killer" type warships, but few were ever begun, as construction of battleships and battlecruisers were curtailed in favor of more-needed convoy escorts, aircraft carriers, and cargo ships. In the post–<a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> era, the Soviet of large guided missile cruisers have also been termed "battlecruisers".

The battlecruiser was developed by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> in the first years of the 20th century as an evolution of the <a href="armoured%20cruiser">armoured cruiser</a>.

The first armoured cruisers had been built in the 1870s, as an attempt to give armour protection to ships fulfilling the typical <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> roles of patrol, trade protection and power projection. However, the results were rarely satisfactory, as the weight of armour required for any meaningful protection usually meant that the ship became almost as slow as a battleship. As a result, navies preferred to build <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a>s with an armoured deck protecting their engines, or simply no armour at all.

In the 1890s, technology began to change this balance. New <a href="Krupp%20armour">Krupp steel</a> armour meant that it was now possible to give a cruiser side armour which would protect it against the <a href="Quick%20firing%20guns">quick-firing guns</a> of enemy battleships and cruisers alike. In 1896–97 France and Russia, who were regarded as likely allies in the event of war, started to build large, fast armoured cruisers taking advantage of this. In the event of a war between Britain and France or Russia, or both, these cruisers threatened to cause serious difficulties for the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>'s worldwide trade.

Britain, which had concluded in 1892 that it needed twice as many cruisers as any potential enemy to adequately protect its empire's sea lanes, responded to the perceived threat by laying down its own large armoured cruisers. Between 1899 and 1905, it completed or laid down seven <a href="ship%20class">classes</a> of this type, a total of 35 ships. This building program, in turn, prompted the French and Russians to increase their own construction. The <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a> began to build large armoured cruisers for use on their overseas stations, laying down eight between 1897 and 1906.

The cost of this cruiser arms race was significant. In the period 1889–96, the Royal Navy spent £7.3 million on new large cruisers. From 1897–1904, it spent £26.9 million. Many armoured cruisers of the new kind were just as large and expensive as the equivalent battleship.

The increasing size and power of the armoured cruiser led to suggestions in British naval circles that cruisers should displace battleships entirely. The battleship's main advantage was its 12-inch heavy guns, and heavier armour designed to protect from shells of similar size. However, for a few years after 1900 it seemed that those advantages were of little practical value. The <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> now had a range of 2,000 yards, and it seemed unlikely that a battleship would engage within torpedo range. However, at ranges of more than 2,000 yards it became increasingly unlikely that the heavy guns of a battleship would score any hits, as the heavy guns relied on primitive aiming techniques. The secondary batteries of 6-inch quick-firing guns, firing more plentiful shells, were more likely to hit the enemy. As naval expert <a href="Fred%20T.%20Jane">Fred T. Jane</a> wrote in June 1902,Is there anything outside of 2,000 yards that the big gun in its hundreds of tons of medieval castle can effect, that its weight in 6-inch guns without the castle could not effect equally well? And inside 2,000, what, in these days of gyros, is there that the torpedo cannot effect with far more certainty?

In 1904, Admiral <a href="John%20Fisher%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fisher">John "Jacky" Fisher</a> became <a href="First%20Sea%20Lord">First Sea Lord</a>, the senior officer of the Royal Navy. He had for some time thought about the development of a new fast armoured ship. He was very fond of the "second-class battleship" , a faster, more lightly armoured battleship. As early as 1901, there is confusion in Fisher's writing about whether he saw the battleship or the cruiser as the model for future developments. This did not stop him from commissioning designs from <a href="naval%20architect">naval architect</a> W. H. Gard for an armoured cruiser with the heaviest possible armament for use with the fleet. The design Gard submitted was for a ship between , capable of , armed with four 9.2-inch and twelve guns in twin <a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s and protected with six inches of armour along her <a href="belt%20armour">belt</a> and 9.2-inch turrets, on her 7.5-inch turrets, 10 inches on her <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> and up to on her decks. However, mainstream British naval thinking between 1902 and 1904 was clearly in favour of heavily armoured battleships, rather than the fast ships that Fisher favoured.

The Battle of Tsushima proved conclusively the effectiveness of heavy guns over intermediate ones and the need for a uniform main caliber on a ship for fire control. Even before this, the Royal Navy had begun to consider a shift away from the mixed-calibre armament of the 1890s <a href="pre-dreadnought">pre-dreadnought</a> to an "all-big-gun" design, and preliminary designs circulated for battleships with all 12-inch or all 10-inch guns and armoured cruisers with all 9.2-inch guns. In late 1904, not long after the Royal Navy had decided to use 12-inch guns for its next generation of battleships because of their superior performance at long range, Fisher began to argue that big-gun cruisers could replace battleships altogether. The continuing improvement of the torpedo meant that <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s and <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s would be able to destroy battleships; this in Fisher's view heralded the end of the battleship or at least compromised the validity of heavy armour protection. Nevertheless, armoured cruisers would remain vital for commerce protection.

Fisher's views were very controversial within the Royal Navy, and even given his position as First Sea Lord, he was not in a position to insist on his own approach. Thus he assembled a "Committee on Designs", consisting of a mixture of civilian and naval experts, to determine the approach to both battleship and armoured cruiser construction in the future. While the stated purpose of the Committee was to investigate and report on future requirements of ships, Fisher and his associates had already made key decisions. The terms of reference for the Committee were for a battleship capable of with 12-inch guns and no intermediate calibres, capable of docking in existing <a href="drydock">drydock</a>s; and a cruiser capable of , also with 12-inch guns and no intermediate armament, armoured like , the most recent armoured cruiser, and also capable of using existing docks.

Under the Selborne plan of 1902, the Royal Navy intended to start three new battleships and four armoured cruisers each year. However, in late 1904 it became clear that the 1905–06 programme would have to be considerably smaller, because of lower than expected tax revenue and the need to buy out two Chilean battleships under construction in British yards, lest they be purchased by the Russians for use against the Japanese, Britain's ally. These economies meant that the 1905–06 programme consisted only of one battleship, but three armoured cruisers. The battleship became the revolutionary battleship , and the cruisers became the three ships of the . Fisher later claimed, however, that he had argued during the Committee for the cancellation of the remaining battleship.

The construction of the new class were begun in 1906 and completed in 1908, delayed perhaps to allow their designers to learn from any problems with "Dreadnought". The ships fulfilled the design requirement quite closely. On a displacement similar to "Dreadnought", the "Invincible"s were longer to accommodate additional <a href="boiler%20%28steam%20generator%29">boiler</a>s and more powerful <a href="steam%20turbine">turbines</a> to propel them at . Moreover, the new ships could maintain this speed for days, whereas pre-dreadnought battleships could not generally do so for more than an hour. Armed with eight <a href="BL%2012%20inch%20Mk%20X%20naval%20gun">12-inch Mk X guns</a>, compared to ten on "Dreadnought", they had of armour protecting the hull and the gun turrets. ("Dreadnought"s armour, by comparison, was at its thickest.) The class had a very marked increase in speed, displacement and firepower compared to the most recent armoured cruisers but no more armour.

While the "Invincible"s were to fill the same role as the armoured cruisers they succeeded, they were expected to do so more effectively. Specifically their roles were:
Confusion about how to refer to these new battleship-size armoured cruisers set in almost immediately. Even in late 1905, before work was begun on the "Invincible"s, a Royal Navy memorandum refers to "large armoured ships" meaning both battleships and large cruisers. In October 1906, the Admiralty began to classify all post-Dreadnought battleships and armoured cruisers as "<a href="capital%20ships">capital ships</a>", while Fisher used the term "dreadnought" to refer either to his new battleships or the battleships and armoured cruisers together. At the same time, the "Invincible" class themselves were referred to as "cruiser-battleships", "dreadnought cruisers"; the term "battlecruiser" was first used by Fisher in 1908. Finally, on 24 November 1911, Admiralty Weekly Order No. 351 laid down that "All cruisers of the “Invincible” and later types are for the future to be described and classified as “battle cruisers” to distinguish them from the armoured cruisers of earlier date."

Along with questions over the new ships' nomenclature came uncertainty about their actual role due to their lack of protection. If they were primarily to act as scouts for the battle fleet and hunter-killers of enemy cruisers and commerce raiders, then the seven inches of belt armour with which they had been equipped would be adequate. If, on the other hand, they were expected to reinforce a battle line of dreadnoughts with their own heavy guns, they were too thin-skinned to be safe from an enemy's heavy guns. The "Invincible"s were essentially extremely large, heavily armed, fast armoured cruisers. However, the viability of the armoured cruiser was already in doubt. A cruiser that could have worked with the Fleet might have been a more viable option for taking over that role.

Because of the "Invincible"s size and armament, naval authorities considered them capital ships almost from their inception—an assumption that might have been inevitable. Complicating matters further was that many naval authorities, including Lord Fisher, had made overoptimistic assessments from the Battle of Tsushima in 1905 about the armoured cruiser's ability to survive in a battle line against enemy capital ships due to their superior speed. These assumptions had been made without taking into account the Russian <a href="Baltic%20Fleet">Baltic Fleet</a>'s inefficiency and tactical ineptitude. By the time the term "battlecruiser" had been given to the "Invincible"s, the idea of their parity with battleships had been fixed in many people's minds.

Not everyone was so convinced. "Brasseys Naval Annual", for instance, stated that with vessels as large and expensive as the "Invincible"s, an admiral "will be certain to put them in the line of battle where their comparatively light protection will be a disadvantage and their high speed of no value." Those in favor of the battlecruiser countered with two points—first, since all capital ships were vulnerable to new weapons such as the <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>, armour had lost some of its validity; and second, because of its greater speed, the battlecruiser could control the range at which it engaged an enemy.

Between the launching of the "Invincible"s to just after the outbreak of the First World War, the battlecruiser played a junior role in the developing dreadnought arms race, as it was never wholeheartedly adopted as the key weapon in British imperial defence, as Fisher had presumably desired. The biggest factor for this lack of acceptance was the marked change in Britain's strategic circumstances between their conception and the commissioning of the first ships. The prospective enemy for Britain had shifted from a Franco-Russian alliance with many armoured cruisers to a resurgent and increasingly belligerent Germany. Diplomatically, Britain had entered the <a href="Entente%20cordiale">Entente cordiale</a> in 1904 and the <a href="Anglo-Russian%20Entente">Anglo-Russian Entente</a>. Neither France nor Russia posed a particular naval threat; the Russian navy had largely been sunk or captured in the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1904–5, while the French were in no hurry to adopt the new <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>-type design. Britain also boasted very cordial relations with two of the significant new naval powers, Japan (bolstered by the <a href="Anglo-Japanese%20Alliance">Anglo-Japanese Alliance</a>, signed in 1902 and renewed in 1905), and the USA. These changed strategic circumstances, and the great success of the "Dreadnought", ensured that she rather than the "Invincible" became the new model capital ship. Nevertheless, battlecruiser construction played a part in the renewed naval arms-race sparked by the "Dreadnought".
For their first few years of service, the "Invincible"s entirely fulfilled Fisher's vision of being able to sink any ship fast enough to catch them, and run from any ship capable of sinking them. An "Invincible" would also, in many circumstances, be able to take on an enemy <a href="pre-dreadnought%20battleship">pre-dreadnought battleship</a>. Naval circles concurred that the armoured cruiser in its current form had come to the logical end of its development and the "Invincible"s were so far ahead of any enemy armoured cruiser in firepower and speed that it proved difficult to justify building more or bigger cruisers. This lead was extended by the surprise both "Dreadnought" and "Invincible" produced by having been built in secret; this prompted most other navies to delay their building programmes and radically revise their designs. This was particularly true for cruisers, because the details of the "Invincible" class were kept secret for longer; this meant that the last German armoured cruiser, , was armed with only guns, and was no match for the new battlecruisers.

The Royal Navy's early superiority in capital ships led to the rejection of a 1905–06 design that would, essentially, have fused the battlecruiser and battleship concepts into what would eventually become the fast battleship. The 'X4' design combined the full armour and armament of "Dreadnought" with the 25 knot speed of "Invincible". The additional cost could not be justified given the existing British lead and the new Liberal government's need for economy; the slower and cheaper , a relatively close copy of "Dreadnought", was adopted instead. The X4 concept would eventually be fulfilled in the and later by other navies.

The next British battlecruisers were the three , slightly improved "Invincible"s built to fundamentally the same specification, partly due to political pressure to limit costs and partly due to the secrecy surrounding German battlecruiser construction, particularly about the heavy armour of . This class came to be widely seen as a mistake and the next generation of British battlecruisers were markedly more powerful. By 1909–10 a sense of national crisis about rivalry with Germany outweighed cost-cutting, and a naval panic resulted in the approval of a total of eight capital ships in 1909–10. Fisher pressed for all eight to be battlecruisers, but was unable to have his way; he had to settle for six battleships and two battlecruisers of the . The "Lion"s carried eight <a href="BL%2013.5%20inch%20Mk%20V%20naval%20gun">13.5-inch guns</a>, the now-standard caliber of the British "super-dreadnought" battleships. Speed increased to and armour protection, while not as good as in German designs, was better than in previous British battlecruisers, with armour belt and <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s. The two "Lion"s were followed by the very similar .
By 1911 Germany had built battlecruisers of her own, and the superiority of the British ships could no longer be assured. Moreover, the German Navy did not share Fisher's view of the battlecruiser. In contrast to the British focus on increasing speed and firepower, Germany progressively improved the armour and staying power of their ships to better the British battlecruisers. "Von der Tann", begun in 1908 and completed in 1910, carried eight 11.1-inch guns, but with 11.1-inch (283 mm) armour she was far better protected than the "Invincible"s. The two s were quite similar but carried ten 11.1-inch guns of an improved design. , designed in 1909 and finished in 1913, was a modified "Moltke"; speed increased by one knot to , while her armour had a maximum thickness of 12 inches, equivalent to the s of a few years earlier. "Seydlitz" was Germany's last battlecruiser completed before World War I.

The next step in battlecruiser design came from Japan. The <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> had been planning the ships from 1909, and was determined that, since the Japanese economy could support relatively few ships, each would be more powerful than its likely competitors. Initially the class was planned with the "Invincible"s as the benchmark. On learning of the British plans for "Lion", and the likelihood that new <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> battleships would be armed with guns, the Japanese decided to radically revise their plans and go one better. A new plan was drawn up, carrying eight 14-inch guns, and capable of , thus marginally having the edge over the "Lion"s in speed and firepower. The heavy guns were also better-positioned, being <a href="superfire">superfiring</a> both fore and aft with no turret amidships. The armour scheme was also marginally improved over the "Lion"s, with nine inches of armour on the turrets and on the barbettes. The first ship in the class was built in Britain, and a further three constructed in Japan. The Japanese also re-classified their powerful armoured cruisers of the "Tsukuba" and "Ibuki" classes, carrying four 12-inch guns, as battlecruisers; nonetheless, their armament was weaker and they were slower than any battlecruiser.
The next British battlecruiser, , was intended initially as the fourth ship in the "Lion" class, but was substantially redesigned. She retained the eight 13.5-inch guns of her predecessors, but they were positioned like those of "Kongō" for better fields of fire. She was faster (making on <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s), and carried a heavier secondary armament. "Tiger" was also more heavily armoured on the whole; while the maximum thickness of armour was the same at nine inches, the height of the main armour belt was increased. Not all the desired improvements for this ship were approved, however. Her designer, <a href="Sir%20Eustace%20Tennyson%20d%27Eyncourt%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt</a>, had wanted small-bore <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s and geared turbines to give her a speed of , but he received no support from the authorities and the engine makers refused his request.

1912 saw work begin on three more German battlecruisers of the , the first German battlecruisers to mount 12-inch guns. These ships, like "Tiger" and the "Kongō"s, had their guns arranged in superfiring turrets for greater efficiency. Their armour and speed was similar to the previous "Seydlitz" class. In 1913, the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> also began the construction of the four-ship , which were designed for service in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>. These ships were designed to carry twelve 14-inch guns, with armour up to 12 inches thick, and a speed of . The heavy armour and relatively slow speed of these ships made them more similar to German designs than to British ships; construction of the "Borodino"s was halted by the First World War and all were scrapped after the end of the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a>.

For most of the combatants, capital ship construction was very limited during the war. Germany finished the "Derfflinger" class and began work on the . The "Mackensen"s were a development of the "Derfflinger" class, with 13.8-inch guns and a broadly similar armour scheme, designed for .

In Britain, Jackie Fisher returned to the office of First Sea Lord in October 1914. His enthusiasm for big, fast ships was unabated, and he set designers to producing a design for a battlecruiser with 15-inch guns. Because Fisher expected the next German battlecruiser to steam at 28 knots, he required the new British design to be capable of 32 knots. He planned to reorder two s, which had been approved but not yet laid down, to a new design. Fisher finally received approval for this project on 28 December 1914 and they became the . With six <a href="BL%2015%20inch%20Mk%20I%20naval%20gun">15-inch guns</a> but only 6-inch armour they were a further step forward from "Tiger" in firepower and speed, but returned to the level of protection of the first British battlecruisers.

At the same time, Fisher resorted to subterfuge to obtain another three fast, lightly armoured ships that could use several spare gun turrets left over from battleship construction. These ships were essentially light battlecruisers, and Fisher occasionally referred to them as such, but officially they were classified as "large light cruisers". This unusual designation was required because construction of new capital ships had been placed on hold, while there were no limits on <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> construction. They became and her sisters and , and there was a bizarre imbalance between their main guns of 15 inches (or in "Furious") and their armour, which at thickness was on the scale of a light cruiser. The design was generally regarded as a failure (nicknamed in the Fleet "Outrageous", "Uproarious" and "Spurious"), though the later conversion of the ships to <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s was very successful. Fisher also speculated about a new mammoth, but lightly built battlecruiser, that would carry guns, which he termed ; this never got beyond the concept stage.

It is often held that the "Renown" and "Courageous" classes were designed for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a reduced <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a>, which might be important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough <a href="Freeboard%20%28nautical%29">freeboard</a> under operational conditions. Roberts argues that the focus on the Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous <a href="Dardanelles%20Campaign">Dardanelles Campaign</a>.

The final British battlecruiser design of the war was the , which was born from a requirement for an improved version of the "Queen Elizabeth" battleship. The project began at the end of 1915, after Fisher's final departure from the Admiralty. While initially envisaged as a battleship, senior sea officers felt that Britain had enough battleships, but that new battlecruisers might be required to combat German ships being built (the British overestimated German progress on the "Mackensen" class as well as their likely capabilities). A battlecruiser design with eight 15-inch guns, 8 inches of armour and capable of 32 knots was decided on. The experience of battlecruisers at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> meant that the design was radically revised and transformed again into a fast battleship with armour up to 12 inches thick, but still capable of . The first ship in the class, , was built according to this design to counter the possible completion of any of the Mackensen-class ship. The plans for her three sisters, on which little work had been done, were revised once more later in 1916 and in 1917 to improve protection.

The Admiral class would have been the only British ships capable of taking on the German "Mackensen" class; nevertheless, German shipbuilding was drastically slowed by the war, and while two "Mackensen"s were launched, none were ever completed. The Germans also worked briefly on a further three ships, of the , which were modified versions of the "Mackensen"s with 15-inch guns. Work on the three additional Admirals was suspended in March 1917 to enable more escorts and merchant ships to be built to deal with the new threat from U-boats to trade. They were finally cancelled in February 1919.

The first combat involving battlecruisers during World War I was the <a href="Battle%20of%20Heligoland%20Bight%20%281914%29">Battle of Heligoland Bight</a> in August 1914. A force of British light cruisers and destroyers entered the <a href="Heligoland%20Bight">Heligoland Bight</a> (the part of the North Sea closest to <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>) to attack German destroyer patrols. When they met opposition from light cruisers, <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty</a> took his squadron of five battlecruisers into the Bight and turned the tide of the battle, ultimately sinking three German light cruisers and killing their commander, <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Leberecht%20Maass">Leberecht Maass</a>.

The German battlecruiser perhaps made the most impact early in the war. Stationed in the Mediterranean, she and the escorting light cruiser <a href="Pursuit%20of%20Goeben%20and%20Breslau">evaded British and French ships on the outbreak of war</a>, and steamed to Constantinople (<a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>) with two British battlecruisers in hot pursuit. The two German ships were handed over to the <a href="Ottoman%20Navy">Ottoman Navy</a>, and this was instrumental in bringing the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> into the war as one of the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a>. "Goeben" herself, renamed "Yavuz Sultan Selim", fought engagements against the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a> in the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> and against the British in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>.

The original battlecruiser concept proved successful in December 1914 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">Battle of the Falkland Islands</a>. The British battlecruisers and did precisely the job for which they were intended when they chased down and annihilated the <a href="German%20East%20Asia%20Squadron">German East Asia Squadron</a>, centered on the armoured cruisers and , along with three light cruisers, commanded by Admiral <a href="Maximilian%20von%20Spee">Maximilian Graf Von Spee</a>, in the South Atlantic Ocean. Prior to the battle, the Australian battlecruiser had unsuccessfully searched for the German ships in the Pacific.
During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a> in 1915, the aftermost barbette of the German flagship "Seydlitz" was struck by a British 13.5-inch shell from "HMS Lion". The shell did not penetrate the barbette, but it dislodged a piece of the barbette armour that allowed the flame from the shell's detonation to enter the barbette. The propellant charges being hoisted upwards were ignited, and the fireball flashed up into the turret and down into the <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazine</a>, setting fire to charges removed from their brass cartridge cases. The gun crew tried to escape into the next turret, which allowed the flash to spread into that turret as well, killing the crews of both turrets. "Seydlitz" was saved from near-certain destruction only by emergency flooding of her after magazines, which had been effected by <a href="Wilhelm%20Heidkamp">Wilhelm Heidkamp</a>. This near-disaster was due to the way that ammunition handling was arranged and was common to both German and British battleships and battlecruisers, but the lighter protection on the latter made them more vulnerable to the turret or barbette being penetrated. The Germans learned from investigating the damaged "Seydlitz" and instituted measures to ensure that ammunition handling minimised any possible exposure to flash.

Apart from the <a href="cordite">cordite</a> handling, the battle was mostly inconclusive, though both the British flagship "Lion" and "Seydlitz" were severely damaged. "Lion" lost speed, causing her to fall behind the rest of the battleline, and Beatty was unable to effectively command his ships for the remainder of the engagement. A British signalling error allowed the German battlecruisers to withdraw, as most of Beatty's squadron mistakenly concentrated on the crippled armoured cruiser "Blücher", sinking her with great loss of life. The British blamed their failure to win a decisive victory on their poor gunnery and attempted to increase their rate of fire by stockpiling unprotected cordite charges in their ammunition hoists and barbettes.
At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a> on 31 May 1916, both British and German battlecruisers were employed as fleet units. The British battlecruisers became engaged with both their German counterparts, the battlecruisers, and then German battleships before the arrival of the battleships of the <a href="British%20Grand%20Fleet">British Grand Fleet</a>. The result was a disaster for the Royal Navy's battlecruiser squadrons: "Invincible", "Queen Mary", and exploded with the loss of all but a handful of their crews. The exact reason why the ships' magazines detonated is not known, but the plethora of exposed cordite charges stored in their turrets, ammunition hoists and working chambers in the quest to increase their rate of fire undoubtedly contributed to their loss. Beatty's flagship "Lion" herself was almost lost in a similar manner, save for the heroic actions of <a href="Major">Major</a> <a href="Francis%20John%20William%20Harvey">Francis Harvey</a>.

The better-armoured German battlecruisers fared better, in part due to the poor performance of British fuzes (the British shells tended to explode or break up on impact with the German armour). —the only German battlecruiser lost at Jutland—had only 128 killed, for instance, despite receiving more than thirty hits. The other German battlecruisers, , "Von der Tann", "Seydlitz", and , were all heavily damaged and required extensive repairs after the battle, "Seydlitz" barely making it home, for they had been the focus of British fire for much of the battle.

In the years immediately after World War I, Britain, Japan and the US all began design work on a new generation of ever more powerful battleships and battlecruisers. The new burst of shipbuilding that each nation's navy desired was politically controversial and potentially economically crippling. This nascent arms race was prevented by the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> of 1922, where the major naval powers agreed to limits on capital ship numbers. The German navy was not represented at the talks; under the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, Germany was not allowed any modern capital ships at all.

Through the 1920s and 1930s only Britain and Japan retained battlecruisers, often modified and rebuilt from their original designs. The line between the battlecruiser and the modern fast battleship became blurred; indeed, the Japanese "Kongō"s were formally redesignated as battleships.

"Hood", launched in 1918, was the last World War I battlecruiser to be completed. Owing to lessons from Jutland, the ship was modified during construction; the thickness of her belt armour was increased by an average of 50 percent and extended substantially, she was given heavier deck armour, and the protection of her magazines was improved to guard against the ignition of ammunition. This was hoped to be capable of resisting her own weapons—the classic measure of a "balanced" battleship. "Hood" was the largest ship in the Royal Navy when completed; thanks to her great displacement, in theory she combined the firepower and armour of a battleship with the speed of a battlecruiser, causing some to refer to her as a fast battleship. However her protection was markedly less than that of the British battleships built immediately after World War I, the .
The navies of Japan and the United States, not being affected immediately by the war, had time to develop new heavy guns for their latest designs and to refine their battlecruiser designs in light of combat experience in Europe. The Imperial Japanese Navy began four s. These vessels would have been of unprecedented size and power, as fast and well armoured as "Hood" whilst carrying a main battery of ten 16-inch guns, the most powerful armament ever proposed for a battlecruiser. They were, for all intents and purposes, fast battleships—the only differences between them and the s which were to precede them were less side armour and a increase in speed. The United States Navy, which had worked on its battlecruiser designs since 1913 and watched the latest developments in this class with great care, responded with the . If completed as planned, they would have been exceptionally fast and well armed with eight 16-inch guns, but carried armour little better than the "Invincible"s—this after an increase in protection following Jutland. The final stage in the post-war battlecruiser race came with the British response to the "Amagi" and "Lexington" types: four <a href="G3%20battlecruiser">G3 battlecruiser</a>s. Royal Navy documents of the period often described any battleship with a speed of over about as a battlecruiser, regardless of the amount of protective armour, although the G3 was considered by most to be a well-balanced fast battleship.

The Washington Naval Treaty meant that none of these designs came to fruition. Ships that had been started were either broken up on the <a href="slipway">slipway</a> or converted to aircraft carriers. In Japan, "Amagi" and were selected for conversion. "Amagi" was damaged beyond repair by the <a href="1923%20Great%20Kant%C5%8D%20earthquake">1923 Great Kantō earthquake</a> and was broken up for <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a>; the hull of one of the proposed "Tosa"-class battleships, , was converted in her stead. The United States Navy also converted two battlecruiser hulls into aircraft carriers in the wake of the Washington Treaty: and , although this was only considered marginally preferable to scrapping the hulls outright (the remaining four: "Constellation", "Ranger", "Constitution" and "United States" were scrapped). In Britain, Fisher's "large light cruisers," were converted to carriers. "Furious" had already been partially converted during the war and "Glorious" and "Courageous" were similarly converted.

In total, nine battlecruisers survived the Washington Naval Treaty, although HMS "Tiger" later became a victim of the <a href="London%20Naval%20Conference">London Naval Conference</a> of 1930 and was scrapped. Because their high speed made them valuable surface units in spite of their weaknesses, most of these ships were significantly updated before World War II. and were modernized significantly in the 1920s and 1930s. Between 1934 and 1936, "Repulse" was partially modernized and had her <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> modified, an aircraft <a href="hangar">hangar</a>, <a href="aircraft%20catapult">catapult</a> and new gunnery equipment added and her anti-aircraft armament increased. "Renown" underwent a more thorough reconstruction between 1937 and 1939. Her deck armour was increased, new turbines and boilers were fitted, an aircraft hangar and catapult added and she was completely rearmed aside from the main guns which had their elevation increased to +30 degrees. The bridge structure was also removed and a large bridge similar to that used in the battleships installed in its place. While conversions of this kind generally added weight to the vessel, "Renown"s tonnage actually decreased due to a substantially lighter power plant. Similar thorough rebuildings planned for "Repulse" and "Hood" were cancelled due to the advent of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

Unable to build new ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy also chose to improve its existing battlecruisers of the "Kongō" class (initially the , , and —the only later as it had been disarmed under the terms of the Washington treaty) in two substantial reconstructions (one for "Hiei"). During the first of these, elevation of their main guns was increased to +40 degrees, <a href="anti-torpedo%20bulges">anti-torpedo bulges</a> and of horizontal armour added, and a "pagoda" mast with additional command positions built up. This reduced the ships' speed to . The second reconstruction focused on speed as they had been selected as fast escorts for aircraft carrier task forces. Completely new main engines, a reduced number of boilers and an increase in hull length by allowed them to reach up to 30 knots once again. They were reclassified as "fast battleships," although their armour and guns still fell short compared to surviving World War I–era battleships in the American or the British navies, with dire consequences during the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>, when "Hiei" and "Kirishima" were easily crippled by US gunfire during actions off Guadalcanal, forcing their scuttling shortly afterwards. Perhaps most tellingly, "Hiei" was crippled by medium-caliber gunfire from heavy and light cruisers in a close-range night engagement.

There were two exceptions: Turkey's "Yavuz Sultan Selim" and the Royal Navy's "Hood". The Turkish Navy made only minor improvements to the ship in the interwar period, which primarily focused on repairing wartime damage and the installation of new fire control systems and anti-aircraft batteries. "Hood" was in constant service with the fleet and could not be withdrawn for an extended reconstruction. She received minor improvements over the course of the 1930s, including modern fire control systems, increased numbers of anti-aircraft guns, and in March 1941, radar.

In the late 1930s navies began to build capital ships again, and during this period a number of large commerce raiders and small, fast battleships were built that are sometimes referred to as battlecruisers. Germany and Russia designed new battlecruisers during this period, though only the latter laid down two of the 35,000-ton . They were still on the slipways when the Germans invaded in 1941 and construction was suspended. Both ships were scrapped after the war.

The Germans planned three battlecruisers of the as part of the expansion of the <a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a> (<a href="Plan%20Z">Plan Z</a>). With six 15-inch guns, high speed, excellent range, but very thin armour, they were intended as commerce raiders. Only one was ordered shortly before World War II; no work was ever done on it. No names were assigned, and they were known by their contract names: 'O', 'P', and 'Q'. The new class was not universally welcomed in the Kriegsmarine. Their abnormally-light protection gained it the derogatory nickname "Ohne Panzer Quatsch" (without armour nonsense) within certain circles of the Navy.

The Royal Navy deployed some of its battlecruisers during the <a href="Norwegian%20Campaign">Norwegian Campaign</a> in April 1940. The and the were engaged during the <a href="Action%20off%20Lofoten">Action off Lofoten</a> by "Renown" in very bad weather and disengaged after "Gneisenau" was damaged. One of "Renown"s 15-inch shells passed through "Gneisenau"s <a href="List%20of%20British%20ordnance%20terms%23DCT">director-control tower</a> without exploding, severing electrical and communication cables as it went and destroyed the <a href="rangefinders">rangefinders</a> for the forward 150 mm (5.9 in) turrets. Main-battery fire control had to be shifted aft due to the loss of electrical power. Another shell from "Renown" knocked out "Gneisenau"s aft turret. The British ship was struck twice by German shells that failed to inflict any significant damage. She was the only pre-war battlecruiser to survive the war.

In the early years of the war various German ships had a measure of success hunting merchant ships in the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a>. Allied battlecruisers such as "Renown", "Repulse", and the fast battleships "Dunkerque" and were employed on operations to hunt down the commerce-raiding German ships, but they never got close to their targets. The one stand-up fight occurred when the battleship and the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> <a href="sortie">sortie</a>d into the North Atlantic to attack British shipping and were intercepted by "Hood" and the battleship in May 1941 in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Denmark%20Strait">Battle of the Denmark Strait</a>. The elderly British battlecruiser was no match for the modern German battleship: within minutes, the "Bismarck"s 15-inch shells caused a magazine explosion in "Hood" reminiscent of the Battle of Jutland. Only three men survived.

The first battlecruiser to see action in the Pacific War was "Repulse" when <a href="Sinking%20of%20Prince%20of%20Wales%20and%20Repulse">she was sunk</a> by Japanese <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s north of <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> on 10 December 1941 whilst in company with "Prince of Wales". She was lightly damaged by a single bomb and near-missed by two others in the first Japanese attack. Her speed and agility enabled her to avoid the other attacks by level bombers and dodge 33 torpedoes. The last group of torpedo bombers attacked from multiple directions and "Repulse" was struck by five torpedoes. She quickly <a href="capsized">capsized</a> with the loss of 27 officers and 486 crewmen; 42 officers and 754 enlisted men were rescued by the escorting destroyers. The loss of "Repulse" and "Prince of Wales" conclusively proved the vulnerability of capital ships to aircraft without air cover of their own.

The Japanese "Kongō"-class battlecruisers were extensively used as carrier escorts for most of their wartime career due to their high speed. Their World War I–era armament was weaker and their upgraded armour was still thin compared to contemporary battleships. On 13 November 1942, during the <a href="First%20Naval%20Battle%20of%20Guadalcanal">First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a>, "Hiei" stumbled across American cruisers and destroyers at <a href="point-blank%20range">point-blank range</a>. The ship was badly damaged in the encounter and had to be towed by her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> "Kirishima". Both were spotted by American aircraft the following morning and "Kirishima" was forced to cast off her tow because of repeated aerial attacks. "Hiei"s captain ordered her crew to abandon ship after further damage and <a href="scuttled">scuttled</a> "Hiei" in the early evening of 14 November. On the night of 14/15 November during the <a href="Second%20Naval%20Battle%20of%20Guadalcanal">Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a>, "Kirishima" returned to <a href="Ironbottom%20Sound">Ironbottom Sound</a>, but encountered the American battleships and . While failing to detect "Washington", "Kirishima" engaged "South Dakota" with some effect. "Washington" opened fire a few minutes later at short range and badly damaged "Kirishima", knocking out her aft turrets, jamming her rudder, and hitting the ship below the waterline. The flooding proved to be uncontrollable and "Kirishima" capsized three and a half hours later.

Returning to Japan after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leyte%20Gulf">Battle of Leyte Gulf</a>, "Kongō" was torpedoed and sunk by the American submarine on 21 November 1944. "Haruna" was moored at <a href="Kure%2C%20Hiroshima">Kure</a>, Japan when the <a href="Bombing%20of%20Kure%20%28July%201945%29">naval base was attacked</a> by American carrier aircraft on 24 and 28 July. The ship was only lightly damaged by a single bomb hit on 24 July, but was hit a dozen more times on 28 July and sank at her <a href="pier">pier</a>. She was refloated after the war and scrapped in early 1946.

A late renaissance in popularity of ships between battleships and cruisers in size occurred on the eve of World War II. Described by some as battlecruisers, but never classified as capital ships, they were variously described as "super cruisers", "large cruisers" or even "unrestricted cruisers". The Dutch, American, and Japanese navies all planned these new classes specifically to counter the heavy cruisers, or their counterparts, being built by their naval rivals.

The first such battlecruisers were the Dutch <a href="Design%201047%20battlecruiser">Design 1047</a>, designed to protect their colonies in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">East Indies</a> in the face of Japanese aggression. Never officially assigned names, these ships were designed with German and Italian assistance. While they broadly resembled the German "Scharnhorst" class and had the same main battery, they would have been more lightly armoured and only protected against eight-inch gunfire. Although the design was mostly completed, work on the vessels never commenced as the Germans overran the Netherlands in May 1940. The first ship would have been laid down in June of that year.

The only class of these late battlecruisers actually built were the United States Navy's "large cruisers". Two of them were completed, and ; a third, , was cancelled while under construction and three others, to be named "Philippines", "Puerto Rico" and "Samoa", were cancelled before they were laid down. They were classified as "large cruisers" instead of battlecruisers, and their status as non-capital ships evidenced by their being named for territories or protectorates. (Battleships, in contrast, were named after states and cruisers after cities.) With a main armament of nine 12-inch guns in three triple turrets and a displacement of , the "Alaska"s were twice the size of s and had guns some 50% larger in diameter. They lacked the thick armoured belt and intricate torpedo defence system of true capital ships. However, unlike most battlecruisers, they were considered a balanced design according to cruiser standards as their protection could withstand fire from their own caliber of gun, albeit only in a very narrow range band. They were designed to hunt down Japanese heavy cruisers, though by the time they entered service most Japanese cruisers had been sunk by American aircraft or submarines. Like the contemporary fast battleships, their speed ultimately made them more useful as carrier escorts and bombardment ships than as the surface combatants they were developed to be.

The Japanese started designing the B64 class, which was similar to the "Alaska" but with guns. News of the "Alaska"s led them to upgrade the design, creating <a href="Design%20B-65%20cruiser">Design B-65</a>. Armed with 356 mm guns, the B65s would have been the best armed of the new breed of battlecruisers, but they still would have had only sufficient protection to keep out eight-inch shells. Much like the Dutch, the Japanese got as far as completing the design for the B65s, but never laid them down. By the time the designs were ready the Japanese Navy recognized that they had little use for the vessels and that their priority for construction should lie with aircraft carriers. Like the "Alaska"s, the Japanese did not call these ships battlecruisers, referring to them instead as super-heavy cruisers.

In spite of the fact that most navies abandoned the battleship and battlecruiser concepts after World War II, <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>'s fondness for big-gun-armed warships caused the Soviet Union to plan a large cruiser class in the late 1940s. In the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> they were termed "heavy cruisers" ("tjazholyj krejser"). The fruits of this program were the <a href="Stalingrad-class%20battlecruiser">Project 82 ("Stalingrad")</a> cruisers, of standard load, nine 305 mm guns and a speed of . Three ships were laid down in 1951–52, but they were cancelled in April 1953 after Stalin's death. Only the central armoured hull section of the first ship, "Stalingrad", was launched in 1954 and then used as a target.

The Soviet is sometimes referred to as a battlecruiser. This description arises from their over displacement, which is roughly equal to that of a First World War battleship and more than twice the displacement of contemporary cruisers; upon entry into service, "Kirov" was the largest <a href="Surface%20combatant">surface ship</a> (aside from aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships) to be built since World War II. The "Kirov" class lacks the armour that distinguishes battlecruisers from ordinary cruisers and they are classified as heavy nuclear-powered missile cruisers ("tyazholyy atomnyy raketny kreyser") by Russia, with their primary surface armament consisting of twenty <a href="P-700%20Granit">P-700 Granit</a> surface to surface missiles. Four members of the class were completed during the 1980s and 1990s, but due to budget constraints only the is operational with the <a href="Russian%20Navy">Russian Navy</a>, though plans were announced in 2010 to return the other three ships to service. As of 2012 one ship was being refitted, but the other two ships are reportedly beyond economical repair.

Bob Hawke

Robert James Lee Hawke (born 9 December 1929) is an Australian <a href="Politics%20of%20Australia">politician</a> who was the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a> and the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Leader of the Labor Party</a> from <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201983">1983</a> to <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20leadership%20spill%2C%20December%201991">1991</a>.

Hawke was born in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> but moved to <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> as a child. He attended the <a href="University%20of%20Western%20Australia">University of Western Australia</a> and then went on to <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> as a <a href="Rhodes%20Scholar">Rhodes Scholar</a>. In 1956, Hawke joined the <a href="Australian%20Council%20of%20Trade%20Unions">Australian Council of Trade Unions</a> (ACTU) as a research officer. Having risen to become responsible for wage arbitration, he was elected <a href="Australian%20Council%20of%20Trade%20Unions">President of the ACTU</a> in 1969, where he achieved an unprecedented level of popularity. After a decade as ACTU President, Hawke announced his intention to enter politics, and was immediately elected to the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">House of Representatives</a> as the Labor MP for <a href="Division%20of%20Wills">Wills</a>.

Three years later, he led Labor to a landslide election victory at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201983">1983 election</a> and was sworn in as Prime Minister. He led Labor to victory at three more elections in <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201984">1984</a>, <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201987">1987</a> and <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201990">1990</a>, thus making him the most electorally successful Labor Party Leader in history. The <a href="Hawke%20Government">Hawke Government</a> created <a href="Medicare%20%28Australia%29">Medicare</a> and <a href="Landcare%20Australia">Landcare</a>, brokered the <a href="Prices%20and%20Incomes%20Accord">Prices and Incomes Accord</a>, formed <a href="Asia-Pacific%20Economic%20Cooperation">APEC</a>, floated the Australian dollar, deregulated the financial sector, introduced the <a href="Family%20allowance%23Australia">Family Assistance Scheme</a>, announced "<a href="Advance%20Australia%20Fair">Advance Australia Fair</a>" as the official national anthem and initiated <a href="Superannuation%20in%20Australia">superannuation pension schemes</a> for all workers.

Hawke was eventually replaced by <a href="Paul%20Keating">Paul Keating</a> at the end of <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party%20leadership%20spill%2C%20December%201991">1991</a>, who would go on to deliver the Labor government a record fifth consecutive victory and a record thirteen years in government at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201993">1993 election</a>. He remains to date Labor's longest-serving Prime Minister, Australia's <a href="List%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Australia%20by%20time%20in%20office">third-longest-serving Prime Minister</a>, and at the age of , Hawke is currently the longest living former Australian Prime Minister. To date, he is the only Australian Prime Minister to be born in South Australia, as well as being the only one raised and educated in Western Australia.

Hawke was born in <a href="Bordertown%2C%20South%20Australia">Bordertown, South Australia</a>, the second child of <a href="Clem%20Hawke">Arthur Hawke</a> (1898-1989) (known as Clem), a <a href="Congregational%20church">Congregationalist</a> minister, and his wife Edith (known as Ellie), a schoolteacher. 
His uncle, <a href="Albert%20Hawke">Albert</a>, was the Labor <a href="Premier%20of%20Western%20Australia">Premier of Western Australia</a> between 1953–59, and was also a close friend of Prime Minister <a href="John%20Curtin">John Curtin</a>, who was in many ways Bob Hawke's <a href="role%20model">role model</a>.

Hawke's elder brother Neil, who was seven years his senior, died at the age of seventeen after contracting <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a>, for which there was no cure at the time. Ellie Hawke subsequently developed an almost messianic belief in her son's destiny, and this contributed to Hawke's supreme self-confidence throughout his career. At the age of fifteen, he presciently boasted to friends that he would one day become the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a>.

At the age of seventeen, the same age that his brother Neil had died, Hawke had a serious accident while riding his <a href="Phelon%20%26amp%3B%20Moore%23Panther%20motorcycles">Panther motorcycle</a> that left him in a critical condition for several days. This near-death experience acted as his catharsis, driving him to make the most of his talents and not let his abilities go to waste. He joined the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor Party</a> in 1947 at the age of eighteen, and successfully applied for a <a href="Rhodes%20Scholarship">Rhodes Scholarship</a> at the end of 1952.

Hawke was educated at <a href="Perth%20Modern%20School">Perth Modern School</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Western%20Australia">University of Western Australia</a>, graduating in 1952 with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> and <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">Bachelor of Laws</a>. He was also president of the university's guild during the same year. The following year, Hawke won a <a href="Rhodes%20Scholarship">Rhodes Scholarship</a> to attend <a href="University%20College%2C%20Oxford">University College, Oxford</a>, where he undertook a Bachelor of Arts in <a href="Philosophy%2C%20Politics%20and%20Economics">Philosophy, Politics and Economics</a> (PPE). He soon found he was covering much the same ground as he did in his education at the University of Western Australia, and transferred to a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Letters">Bachelor of Letters</a>, writing his thesis on wage-fixing in Australia which was successfully presented in January 1956.

His academic achievements were complemented by setting a new <a href="world%20record">world record</a> for beer drinking; he downed – equivalent to a <a href="yard%20of%20ale">yard of ale</a> – from a <a href="sconce%20pot">sconce pot</a> in 11 seconds as part of a college penalty. In his memoirs, Hawke suggested that this single feat may have contributed to his political success more than any other, by endearing him to an electorate with a strong beer culture.

In 1956, Hawke accepted a scholarship to undertake doctoral studies in the area of arbitration law in the law department at the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a> in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>. Soon after his arrival at ANU, Hawke became the students' representative on the University Council. A year later, Hawke was recommended to the <a href="Australian%20Council%20of%20Trade%20Unions">President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions</a> (ACTU) to become a research officer, replacing Harold Souter who had become ACTU Secretary. The recommendation was made by Hawke's mentor at ANU, H.P. Brown, who for a number of years had assisted the ACTU in national wage cases. Hawke decided to abandon his doctoral studies and accept the offer, moving to <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> with his wife <a href="Hazel%20Hawke">Hazel</a>.

Not long after Hawke began work at the ACTU, he became responsible for the presentation of its annual case for higher wages to the national wages tribunal, the <a href="Australian%20Industrial%20Relations%20Commission">Conciliation and Arbitration Commission</a>. He was first appointed as an ACTU advocate in 1959. The 1958 case, under previous advocate R.L. Eggleston, had yielded only a five-shilling increase. The 1959 case found for a fifteen-shilling increase, and was regarded as a personal triumph for Hawke. He went on to attain such success and prominence in his role as an ACTU advocate that, in 1969, he was encouraged to run for the position of ACTU President, despite the fact that he had never held elected office in a trade union.

He was elected ACTU President in 1969 on a modernising platform by the narrow margin of 399 to 350, with the support of the left of the union movement, including some associated with the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Australia">Communist Party</a>. He later credited <a href="Ray%20Gietzelt">Ray Gietzelt</a>, General Secretary of the <a href="Federated%20Miscellaneous%20Workers%27%20Union%20of%20Australia">FMWU</a>, as the single most significant union figure in helping him achieve this outcome.

Hawke declared publicly that "socialist is not a word I would use to describe myself", and his approach to government was <a href="pragmatism">pragmatic</a>. He concerned himself with making improvements to workers' lives from within the traditional institutions of government, rather than by using any ideological theory. He opposed the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, but was a strong supporter of the US-Australian alliance, and also an emotional supporter of <a href="Israel">Israel</a>. It was his commitment to the cause of Jewish <a href="Refuseniks">Refuseniks</a> which purportedly led to a planned assassination attempt on Hawke by the <a href="Popular%20Front%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Palestine">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine</a>, and its Australian operative <a href="Munif%20Mohammed%20Abou%20Rish">Munif Mohammed Abou Rish</a>.

In 1971, Hawke along with other members of the ACTU requested that South Africa send a non-racially biased team for the <a href="1971%20South%20Africa%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20Australia">Rugby Union tour</a>, with the intention of unions agreeing not to serve the team in Australia. Prior to arrival, the Western Australian branch of the <a href="Transport%20Workers%20Union%20of%20Australia">Transport Workers Union</a>, and the Barmaids' and Barmens' Union, announced that they would serve the team, which allowed the <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Springboks</a> to land in Perth. The tour commenced on 26 June and riots occurred as anti-apartheid protesters disrupted games. Hawke and his family started to receive malicious mail and phone calls from people who thought that sport and politics should not mix. Hawke remained committed to the ban on apartheid teams and later that year, the South African cricket team was successfully denied and no apartheid team was to ever come to Australia again. It was this ongoing dedication to racial equality in South Africa that would later earn Hawke the respect and friendship of <a href="Nelson%20Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a>.

In industrial matters, Hawke continued to demonstrate a preference for, and considerable skill at, negotiation, and was generally liked and respected by employers as well as the unions he advocated for. As early as 1972, speculation began that he would seek to enter <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">Parliament</a> and eventually run to become the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Leader of the Labor Party</a>. But while his professional career continued successfully, his heavy drinking and his notorious womanising placed considerable strains on his family life.

In 1973, Hawke was elected as the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Federal President of the Labor Party</a>. Two years later, when the <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Whitlam Government</a> was controversially <a href="1975%20Australian%20constitutional%20crisis">dismissed by the Governor-General</a>, Hawke showed an initial keenness to enter Parliament at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201975">ensuing election</a>. <a href="Harry%20Jenkins%2C%20Sr.">Harry Jenkins</a>, the MP for <a href="Division%20of%20Scullin">Scullin</a>, came under pressure to step down to allow Hawke to stand in his place, but he strongly resisted this push. Hawke eventually decided not to attempt to enter Parliament at that time, a decision he soon regretted. After Labor was defeated at the election, Whitlam initially offered the leadership to Hawke, although it was not within Whitlam's power to decide who would succeed him. Despite not taking on the offer, Hawke remained influential, playing a key role in averting national strike action.

The strain of this period, serving as both ACTU President and Labor Party President, took its toll on Hawke and in 1979 he suffered a physical collapse. This shock led Hawke to publicly announce his alcoholism in a television interview, and that he would make a concerted – and ultimately successful – effort to overcome it. He was helped through this period by the relationship that he had established with writer <a href="Blanche%20d%27Alpuget">Blanche d'Alpuget</a>, who, in 1982, published a biography of Hawke. His popularity with the public was, if anything, enhanced by this period of rehabilitation, and opinion polling suggested that he was a far more popular public figure than either Labor Leader <a href="Bill%20Hayden">Bill Hayden</a> or <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal</a> Prime Minister <a href="Malcolm%20Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a>.

Hawke's first attempt to enter Parliament came during the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201963">1963 federal election</a>. He stood in the seat of <a href="Division%20of%20Corio">Corio</a> in <a href="Geelong">Geelong</a> and managed to achieve a 3.1% swing against the national trend, although he fell short of ousting longtime Liberal incumbent <a href="Hubert%20Opperman">Hubert Opperman</a>.

Hawke passed up several opportunities to enter Parliament throughout the 1970s, something he later wrote that he "regretted". He eventually stood for election to the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201980">1980 election</a> for the safe <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> seat of <a href="Division%20of%20Wills">Wills</a>, winning it comfortably. Immediately upon his election to Parliament, Hawke was appointed to the <a href="Shadow%20Cabinet">Shadow Cabinet</a> by Labor Leader <a href="Bill%20Hayden">Bill Hayden</a> as Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations. Following his entry to Parliament, opinion polls continually indicated that, in contrast to Hayden, Hawke was regarded as "a certain election winner". After losing the 1980 election, Hayden's leadership had become insecure. In order to quell speculation over his position, Hayden eventually called a leadership ballot for 16 July 1982, believing that if he won he would be able to lead Labor into the next election. Hawke duly challenged Hayden, but Hayden was able to defeat him and remain in position, although his five-vote victory over the former ACTU President was not large enough to dispel doubts that he could lead the Labor Party to victory at an election.

Despite being defeated, Hawke continued to agitate behind the scenes for a change in leadership, with opinion polls continuing to show that Hawke was a far more popular figure than both Hayden and Prime Minister <a href="Malcolm%20Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a>. Hayden's leadership position was thrown into further doubt after Labor performed poorly at a by-election in December 1982 for the Victorian seat of <a href="Division%20of%20Flinders">Flinders</a>, following the resignation of the former Liberal Minister <a href="Phillip%20Lynch">Sir Phillip Lynch</a>. Labor needed a swing of 5.5% to win the seat, and had been predicted by the media to win, but could only achieve a swing of 3%. This convinced many Labor MPs that only Hawke would be able to lead Labor to victory at the upcoming election. Labor Party power-brokers, such as <a href="Graham%20Richardson">Graham Richardson</a> and <a href="Barrie%20Unsworth">Barrie Unsworth</a>, now openly switched their allegiance from Hayden to Hawke. More significantly, Hayden's staunch friend and political ally, Labor's <a href="Australian%20Senate">Senate Leader</a> <a href="John%20Button">John Button</a>, had become convinced that Hawke's chances of victory at an election were greater than Hayden's. Having initially believed that he could carry on, Button's defection proved to be the final straw in convincing Hayden that he would have to resign as Labor Leader.

Less than two months after the disastrous result at the Flinders by-election, Hayden announced his resignation as Leader of the Labor Party to the caucus on 3 February 1983. Hawke was subsequently named as leader—and hence became <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28Australia%29">Leader of the Opposition</a>—pending a party-room ballot at which he was elected unopposed. By a remarkable coincidence, on the same day that Hawke became Leader, Fraser called a <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201983">snap election</a> for 5 March 1983, hoping to capitalise on Labor's feuding before it could replace Hayden with Hawke. Fraser initially believed that he had caught Labor out, thinking that they would be forced to fight the election with Hayden as Leader. However, he was surprised to find out upon his return from seeing the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General</a> that Hayden had already resigned that morning, just hours before the writs were issued. In the election held a month later, Hawke led Labor to a landslide election victory, achieving a 24-seat swing—still the worst defeat that a sitting non-Labor Government has ever suffered—and ending seven years of Liberal Party rule.

After Labor's landslide victory, Hawke was sworn in as the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">23rd Prime Minister of Australia</a> by the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General</a> on 11 March 1983. The inaugural days of the <a href="Hawke%20Government">Hawke Government</a> were distinctly different from those of the <a href="Whitlam%20Government">Whitlam Government</a>. Rather than immediately initiating extensive reform programmes as Whitlam had, Hawke announced that <a href="Malcolm%20Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a>'s pre-election concealment of the budget deficit meant that many of Labor's election commitments would have to be deferred. As part of his internal reforms package, Hawke divided the Government into two tiers, with only the most senior ministers sitting in the <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Australia">Cabinet</a>. The Labor caucus was still given the authority to determine who would make up the Ministry, but gave Hawke unprecedented powers for a Labor Prime Minister to select which individual ministers would comprise the 13-strong Cabinet.

Hawke said that he did this in order to avoid what he viewed as the unwieldy nature of the Whitlam Cabinet, which had 27 members. Caucus under Hawke also exhibited a much more formalised system of parliamentary <a href="political%20faction">factions</a>, which significantly altered the dynamics of caucus operations.
Unlike his predecessor, Hawke's authority within the Labor Party was absolute. This enabled him to persuade his MPs to support a substantial set of policy changes. Individual accounts from ministers indicate that while Hawke was not usually the driving force behind individual reforms, he took on the role of achieving consensus and providing political guidance on what was electorally feasible and how best to sell it to the public, tasks at which he proved highly successful. Hawke took on a very public role as Prime Minister, proving to be incredibly popular with the Australian electorate; to this date he still holds the highest ever AC Nielsen approval rating.

According to political commentator <a href="Paul%20Kelly%20%28journalist%29">Paul Kelly</a>, "the most influential economic decisions of the 1980s were the floating of the Australian dollar and the deregulation of the financial system". Although the <a href="Malcolm%20Fraser">Fraser Government</a> had played a part in the process of financial deregulation by commissioning the 1981 Campbell Report, opposition from Fraser himself had stalled the deregulation process. When the Hawke Government implemented a comprehensive program of financial deregulation and reform, it "transformed economics and politics in Australia". The Australian economy became significantly more integrated with the global economy as a result, which completely transformed its relationship with Asia, Europe and the United States. Both Hawke and Keating would claim the credit for being the driving force behind the success of the Australian Dollar float.

Among other reforms, the Hawke Government dismantled the tariff system, privatised state sector industries, ended the subsidisation of loss-making industries, and sold off the state-owned <a href="Commonwealth%20Bank">Commonwealth Bank of Australia</a>, <a href="Qantas">Qantas</a> and <a href="CSL%20Limited">CSL Limited</a>. The tax system was reformed, with the introduction of a fringe benefits tax and a capital gains tax, reforms strongly opposed by the Liberal Party at the time, but not ones that they reversed when they eventually returned to office. Partially offsetting these imposts upon the business community – the "main loser" from the 1985 Tax Summit according to Paul Kelly – was the introduction of full <a href="dividend%20imputation">dividend imputation</a>, a reform insisted upon by Keating. Funding for schools was also considerably increased, while financial assistance was provided for students to enable them to stay at school longer. Considerable progress was also made in directing assistance "to the most disadvantaged recipients over the whole range of welfare benefits."

The political partnership between Hawke and his <a href="Treasurer%20of%20Australia">Treasurer</a>, Paul Keating, proved essential to Labor's success in government. The two men proved a study in contrasts: Hawke was a Rhodes Scholar; Keating left high school early. Hawke's enthusiasms were cigars, horse racing and all forms of sport; Keating preferred <a href="classical%20architecture">classical architecture</a>, <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Mahler</a> symphonies and collecting <a href="British%20Regency">British Regency</a> and <a href="First%20French%20Empire">French Empire</a> antiques. Hawke was consensus-driven; Keating revelled in aggressive debate. Hawke was a lapsed Protestant; Keating was a practising Catholic. These differences, however, seemed only to increase the effectiveness of their partnership, as they oversaw sweeping economic and social changes throughout Australia.

In spite of the criticisms levelled against the Hawke Government, it succeeded in enacting a wide range of social reforms during its time in office. Deflecting arguments that the Hawke Government had failed as a reform government, <a href="Neville%20Wran">Neville Wran</a>, <a href="John%20Dawkins">John Dawkins</a>, <a href="Bill%20Hayden">Bill Hayden</a> and <a href="Paul%20Keating">Paul Keating</a> made a number of speeches throughout the 1980s arguing that the Hawke Government had been a recognisably reformist government, drawing attention to Hawke's achievements as Prime Minister during his first five years in office. As well as the reintroduction of <a href="Medibank">Medibank</a>, under the new name <a href="Medicare%20%28Australia%29">Medicare</a>, these included the doubling of the number of childcare places, the introduction of occupational superannuation, a boost in school retention rates, a focus on young people's job skills, a doubling of subsidised homecare services, the elimination of poverty traps in the welfare system, a 50% increase in public housing funds, an increase in the real value of the old-age pension, the development of a new youth support program, the reintroduction of six-monthly indexation of single-person unemployment benefits, and significant improvements in social security provisions. As pointed out by John Dawkins, the proportion of total government outlays allocated to families, the sick, single parents, widows, the handicapped, and veterans was significantly higher under the Hawke Government than under the Whitlam Government.

Another notable success for which Hawke's response is given considerable credit was <a href="HIV/AIDS%20in%20Australia">Australia's public health campaign</a> regarding HIV/AIDS. In the later years of the Hawke Government, Aboriginal affairs also saw considerable attention, with an investigation of the idea of a treaty between Aborigines and the Government, although this idea would be overtaken by events, notably the <a href="Mabo%20v%20Queensland%20%28No%202%29%20%281992%29">Mabo court decision</a>.

The Hawke Government also made some notable environmental decisions. In its first months in office, it halted the construction of the <a href="Franklin%20Dam">Franklin Dam</a> in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>, responding to a groundswell of protest about the issue. In 1990, with an election looming, tough political operator <a href="Graham%20Richardson">Graham Richardson</a> was appointed Environment Minister, and was given the task of attracting second-preference votes from the <a href="Australian%20Democrats">Australian Democrats</a> and other environmental parties. Richardson claimed this as a major factor in the government's narrow re-election at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201990">1990 election</a>. Richardson felt that the importance of his contribution to Labor's victory would automatically entitle him to the ministerial portfolio of his choice, which was Transport and Communications. He was shocked, however, at what he perceived as Hawke's ingratitude in allocating him Social Security instead. He later vowed in a telephone conversation with Peter Barron, a former Hawke staffer, to do "whatever it takes" to "get" Hawke. He immediately transferred his allegiance to <a href="Paul%20Keating">Paul Keating</a>, who after seven years as <a href="Treasurer%20of%20Australia">Treasurer</a> was openly coveting the leadership.

Hawke benefited greatly from the disarray into which the Liberal Party fell after the resignation of Malcolm Fraser. The Liberals were divided between supporters of the dour, socially conservative <a href="John%20Howard">John Howard</a> and the more liberal, urbane <a href="Andrew%20Peacock">Andrew Peacock</a>. The arch-conservative <a href="Premier%20of%20Queensland">Premier of Queensland</a>, <a href="Joh%20Bjelke-Petersen">Joh Bjelke-Petersen</a>, added to the Liberals' problems with his "<a href="Joh%20for%20Canberra">Joh for Canberra</a>" campaign, which proved highly damaging. Exploiting these divisions, Hawke led the Labor Party to landslide election victories in a snap <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201984">1984 election</a> and the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201987">1987 election</a>.

Hawke's tenure as Prime Minister saw considerable friction develop between himself and the grassroots of the Labor Party, who were unhappy at what they viewed as Hawke's iconoclasm and willingness to cooperate with business interests. All Labor Prime Ministers have at times engendered the hostility of the organisational wing of the Party, but none more so than Hawke, who regularly expressed his willingness to cull Labor's "sacred cows". The <a href="Socialist%20Left%20%28Australia%29">Socialist Left</a> faction, as well as prominent Labor figure <a href="Barry%20Jones%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Barry Jones</a>, offered severe criticism of a number of government decisions. He also received criticism for his "confrontationalist style" in siding with the airlines in the <a href="1989%20Australian%20pilots%27%20strike">1989 Australian pilots' strike</a>.

The <a href="late%201980s%20recession">late 1980s recession</a> and accompanying high interest rates had seen the government in considerable polling trouble, with many doubting if Hawke could win in 1990. Although Keating was the main architect of the government's economic policies, he took advantage of Hawke's declining popularity to plan a leadership challenge. In 1988, in the wake of poorer opinion polls, Keating put pressure on Hawke to step down immediately. Hawke responded by agreeing a secret deal with Keating, the so-called "<a href="Kirribilli%20agreement">Kirribilli agreement</a>", that he would stand down in Keating's favour shortly after the 1990 election, which he convinced Keating he could win. Hawke duly won the 1990 election, albeit by a very tight margin, and subsequently appointed Keating as <a href="Deputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Deputy Prime Minister</a> to replace the retiring <a href="Lionel%20Bowen">Lionel Bowen</a>, and to prepare Keating to assume the leadership.

Not long after becoming Deputy Prime Minister, frustrated at the lack of any indication from Hawke as to when he might step down, Keating made a provocative speech to the <a href="Canberra%20Press%20Gallery">Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery</a>. Hawke considered the speech extremely disloyal, and subsequently indicated to Keating that he would renege on the Kirribilli Agreement as a result. After this disagreement, tensions between the two men reached an all-time high, and after a turbulent year, Keating finally resigned as Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer in June 1991, to challenge Hawke for the leadership. Hawke comfortably defeated Keating, and in a press conference after the result Keating declared that with regards the leadership, he had fired his "one shot". Hawke appointed <a href="John%20Kerin">John Kerin</a> to replace Keating as Treasurer, but Kerin quickly proved to be unfit for the job.

Despite his convincing victory over Keating, Hawke was seen after the result as a "wounded" leader; he had now lost his long-term political partner, his rating in opinion polls began to decrease, and after nearly nine years as prime minister, many were openly speculating that he was "tired", and that it was time for somebody new.

Hawke's leadership was finally irrevocably damaged towards the end of 1991, as new <a href="Australian%20Liberal%20Party">Liberal Leader</a> <a href="John%20Hewson">John Hewson</a> released '<a href="Fightback%21%20%28policy%29">Fightback!</a>', a detailed proposal for sweeping economic change, including the introduction of a <a href="Goods%20and%20Services%20Tax%20%28Australia%29">goods and services tax</a> and deep cuts to government spending and personal income tax. The package appeared to take Hawke by complete surprise, and his response to it was judged to be extremely ineffective. Many within the Labor Party appeared to lose faith in him over this, and Keating duly challenged for the leadership a second time on 19 December 1991, this time narrowly defeating Hawke by 56 votes to 51.

In a speech to the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> the following day, Hawke declared that his nine years as Prime Minister had left Australia a better country than he found, and he was given a standing ovation by those present. He subsequently tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to the Governor-General. Hawke briefly returned to the backbenches before resigning from Parliament on 20 February 1992, sparking a <a href="Wills%20by-election%2C%201992">by-election</a> which was won by the independent candidate <a href="Phil%20Cleary">Phil Cleary</a> from a record field of 22 candidates.

Hawke wrote that he had very few regrets over his time in office; although his bitterness towards Keating surfaced in his earlier memoirs, by 2008, Hawke claimed that he and Keating had long since buried their differences, and that they regularly dined together and considered each other friends. However, in 2010, the publication of the book "Hawke: The Prime Minister," by Hawke's second wife, <a href="Blanche%20d%27Alpuget">Blanche d'Alpuget</a>, reignited conflict between the two. In an open letter to Hawke published in Australian newspapers, Keating bitterly accused Hawke and D'alpuget of spreading falsehoods about his role in Hawke's premiership. He declared that "in hindsight, it is obvious yours and Blanche's expressions of friendship towards me over the last few years have been completely insincere."

After leaving Parliament, Hawke entered the business world, taking on a number of directorships and consultancy positions which enabled him to achieve considerable financial success. He deliberately had little involvement with the Labor Party during Keating's tenure as Prime Minister, not wanting to overshadow his successor, although he did occasionally criticise some of Keating's policies publicly.

After Keating's defeat and the election of the <a href="John%20Howard">Howard Government</a> at the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201996">1996 election</a>, he began to be more involved with Labor, regularly appearing at a number of Labor election launches and campaigns, often alongside Keating. In 2002, Hawke was named an honorary member of South Australia's <a href="Economic%20Development%20Board%20%28South%20Australia%29">Economic Development Board</a> during <a href="Rann%20Government">Rann's Labor government.</a>

In the run up to the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202007">2007 election</a>, Hawke made a considerable personal effort to support <a href="Kevin%20Rudd">Kevin Rudd</a>, making speeches at a large number of campaign office openings across Australia. As well as campaigning against <a href="WorkChoices">WorkChoices</a>, Hawke also attacked <a href="John%20Howard">John Howard</a>'s record as Treasurer, stating "it was the judgement of every economist and international financial institution that it was the restructuring reforms undertaken by my government, with the full cooperation of the trade union movement, which created the strength of the Australian economy today".

Similarly, in the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202010">2010</a> and <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202013">2013 campaigns</a>, Hawke lent considerable support to <a href="Julia%20Gillard">Julia Gillard</a> and Kevin Rudd respectively. Hawke also maintained an involvement in Labor politics at a state level; in 2011, Hawke publicly supported <a href="Premier%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales Premier</a> <a href="Kristina%20Keneally">Kristina Keneally</a>, who was facing almost certain defeat, in her campaign against Liberal <a href="Barry%20O%27Farrell">Barry O'Farrell</a>, describing her campaign as "gutsy".

In February 2008, Hawke joined former Prime Ministers <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a>, <a href="Malcolm%20Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a> and <a href="Paul%20Keating">Paul Keating</a> in <a href="Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra">Parliament House</a> to witness Prime Minister Kevin Rudd deliver the long anticipated apology to the <a href="Stolen%20Generations">Stolen Generations</a>.

In 2009, Hawke helped establish the Centre for Muslim and Non-Muslim Understanding at the <a href="University%20of%20South%20Australia">University of South Australia</a>. Interfaith dialogue was an important issue for Hawke, who told the "<a href="Adelaide%20Review">Adelaide Review</a>" that he is "convinced that one of the great potential dangers confronting the world is the lack of understanding in regard to the Muslim world. Fanatics have misrepresented what Islam is. They give a false impression of the essential nature of Islam."

In 2016, after taking part in Andrew Denton's Better Off Dead podcast, Hawke added his voice to calls for voluntary euthanasia to be legalised. Hawke labelled as 'absurd' the lack of political will to fix the problem. He revealed that he had such an arrangement with his wife Blanche should such a devastating medical situation occur.

Hawke married <a href="Hazel%20Hawke">Hazel Masterson</a> in 1956 at Perth Trinity Church. They had three children; Susan (born 1957), Stephen (born 1959) and Roslyn (born 1960). Their fourth child, Robert Jr, died in his early infancy in 1963. Hawke was named Victorian Father of the Year in 1971. The couple divorced in 1995. Hawke subsequently married the writer <a href="Blanche%20d%27Alpuget">Blanche d'Alpuget</a>, and the two currently live together in <a href="Northbridge%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Northbridge</a>, a suburb of the <a href="North%20Shore%20%28Sydney%29">North Shore</a> of Sydney.

On the subject of his religion, Hawke previously wrote, while attending the 1952 World Christian Youth Conference in India, that "there were all these poverty stricken kids at the gate of this palatial place where we were feeding our face and I just had this struck by this enormous sense of irrelevance of religion to the needs of people". He subsequently abandoned his Christian beliefs. By the time he entered politics he was a self-described agnostic. Hawke told <a href="Andrew%20Denton">Andrew Denton</a> in 2008 that his father's Christian faith had continued to influence his outlook, saying "My father said if you believe in the fatherhood of God you must necessarily believe in the brotherhood of man, it follows necessarily, and even though I left the church and was not religious, that truth remained with me."

Baldr

Baldr (also Balder, Baldur) is a <a href="%C3%86sir">god</a> in <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>, and a son of the god <a href="Odin">Odin</a> and the goddess <a href="Frigg">Frigg</a>. He has <a href="Sons%20of%20Odin">numerous brothers</a>, such as <a href="Thor">Thor</a> and <a href="V%C3%A1li">Váli</a>.

In the 12th century, Danish accounts by <a href="Saxo%20Grammaticus">Saxo Grammaticus</a> and other Danish Latin chroniclers recorded a <a href="Euhemerus">euhemerized</a> account of his story. Compiled in <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> in the 13th century, but based on much older <a href="Old%20Norse%20poetry">Old Norse poetry</a>, the <a href="Poetic%20Edda">Poetic Edda</a> and the <a href="Prose%20Edda">Prose Edda</a> contain numerous references to the death of Baldr as both a great tragedy to the <a href="%C3%86sir">Æsir</a> and a harbinger of <a href="Ragnar%C3%B6k">Ragnarök</a>.

According to "<a href="Gylfaginning">Gylfaginning</a>", a book of <a href="Snorri%20Sturluson">Snorri Sturluson</a>'s Prose Edda, Baldr's wife is <a href="Nanna%20%28Norse%20deity%29">Nanna</a> and their son is <a href="Forseti">Forseti</a>. In "Gylfaginning", Snorri relates that Baldr had the greatest ship ever built, named <a href="Hringhorni">Hringhorni</a>, and that there is no place more beautiful than his hall, <a href="Breidablik">Breidablik</a>.

<a href="Jacob%20Grimm">Jacob Grimm</a> in his "<a href="Deutsche%20Mythologie">Teutonic Mythology</a>" (ch. 11) identifies Old Norse "Baldr" with the Old High German "Baldere" (2nd <a href="Merseburg%20Incantations">Merseburg Charm</a>, Thuringia), "Palter" (theonym, Bavaria), "Paltar" (personal name) and with Old English "bealdor, baldor" "lord, prince, king" (used always with a genitive plural, as in "gumena baldor" "lord of men", "wigena baldor" "lord of warriors", et cetera). Old Norse shows this usage of the word as an honorific in a few cases, as in "baldur î brynju" (<a href="Saemundar%20Edda">Sæm.</a> 272b) and "herbaldr" (Sæm. 218b), both epithets of heroes in general.

Grimm traces the etymology of the name to *"balþaz", whence Gothic "balþs", Old English "bald", Old High German "pald", all meaning "bold, brave".

But the interpretation of Baldr as "the brave god" may be secondary. Baltic (cf. Lithuanian "<a href="%3Awikt%3Abaltas">baltas</a>", Latvian "<a href="%3Awikt%3Abalts">balts</a>") has a word meaning "the white, the good", and Grimm speculates that the name may originate as a Baltic loan into <a href="Proto-Germanic">Proto-Germanic</a>.
In continental Saxon and Anglo-Saxon tradition, the son of <a href="Odin">Woden</a> is called not "Bealdor" but "Baldag" (Saxon) and "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20royal%20genealogies%23Wessex%20and%20Bernicia">Bældæg, Beldeg</a>" (Anglo-Saxon), which shows association with "day", possibly with <a href="Dagr">Day</a> personified as a deity. This, as Grimm points out, would agree with the meaning "shining one, white one, a god" derived from the meaning of Baltic "baltas", further adducing Slavic "<a href="Belobog">Belobog</a>" and German "<a href="Berhta">Berhta</a>".

Grimm's etymology is endorsed by modern research. According to Rudolf Simek, the original name for Baldr must be understood as 'shining day'.

One of the two <a href="Merseburg%20Incantations">Merseburg Incantations</a> names "Baldere", but also mentions a figure named "Phol", considered to be a byname for Baldr (as in Scandinavian "Falr", "Fjalarr"; (in Saxo) "Balderus" : "Fjallerus").

In the Poetic Edda the tale of Baldr's death is referred to rather than recounted at length. Among the visions which the <a href="V%C3%B6lva">Völva</a> sees and describes in the prophecy known as the "<a href="V%C3%B6lusp%C3%A1">Völuspá</a>" is one of the fatal <a href="mistletoe">mistletoe</a>, the birth of <a href="V%C3%A1li%20%28son%20of%20Odin%29">Váli</a> and the weeping of <a href="Frigg">Frigg</a> (stanzas 31–33). Yet looking far into the future the Völva sees a brighter vision of a new world, when both Höðr and Baldr will come back (stanza 62). The Eddic poem "<a href="Baldr%27s%20Dreams">Baldr's Dreams</a>" mentions that Baldr has bad dreams which the gods then discuss. <a href="Odin">Odin</a> rides to Hel and awakens a seeress, who tells him Höðr will kill Baldr but Vali will avenge him (stanzas 9, 11).

In "Gylfaginning", Baldur is described as follows:

Apart from this description Baldr is known primarily for the story of his death. His death is seen as the first in the chain of events which will ultimately lead to the destruction of the gods at <a href="Ragnar%C3%B6k">Ragnarök</a>. Baldr will be reborn in the new world, according to "<a href="V%C3%B6lusp%C3%A1">Völuspá</a>".

He had a dream of his own death and his mother had the same dreams. Since dreams were usually prophetic, this depressed him, so his mother <a href="Frigg">Frigg</a> made every object on earth <a href="vow">vow</a> never to hurt Baldr. All objects made this vow except <a href="mistletoe">mistletoe</a>—a detail which has traditionally been explained with the idea that it was too unimportant and nonthreatening to bother asking it to make the vow, but which Merrill Kaplan has instead argued echoes the fact that young people were not eligible to swear legal oaths, which could make them a threat later in life.

When <a href="Loki">Loki</a>, the mischief-maker, heard of this, he made a magical spear from this plant (in some later versions, an arrow). He hurried to the place where the gods were indulging in their new pastime of hurling objects at Baldr, which would bounce off without harming him. Loki gave the spear to Baldr's brother, the blind god <a href="H%C3%B6%C3%B0r">Höðr</a>, who then inadvertently killed his brother with it (other versions suggest that Loki guided the arrow himself). For this act, Odin and the giantess <a href="Rindr">Rindr</a> gave birth to <a href="V%C3%A1li%20%28son%20of%20Odin%29">Váli</a> who grew to adulthood within a day and slew Höðr.

Baldr was ceremonially burnt upon his ship, <a href="Hringhorni">Hringhorni</a>, the largest of all ships. As he was carried to the ship, Odin whispered in his ear. This was to be a key riddle asked by Odin (in disguise) of the giant <a href="Vafthrudnir">Vafthrudnir</a> (and which was, of course, unanswerable) in the poem "<a href="Vafthrudnismal">Vafthrudnismal</a>". The riddle also appears in the riddles of <a href="Gestumblindi">Gestumblindi</a> in "<a href="Hervarar%20saga">Hervarar saga</a>".

The dwarf <a href="Litr">Litr</a> was kicked by <a href="Thor">Thor</a> into the funeral fire and burnt alive. Nanna, Baldr's wife, also threw herself on the funeral fire to await Ragnarök when she would be reunited with her husband (alternatively, she died of grief). Baldr's horse with all its trappings was also burned on the pyre. The ship was set to sea by <a href="Hyrrokin">Hyrrokin</a>, a <a href="giantess">giantess</a>, who came riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the earth shook.

Upon Frigg's entreaties, delivered through the messenger <a href="Herm%C3%B3%C3%B0r">Hermod</a>, <a href="Hel%20%28goddess%29">Hel</a> promised to release Baldr from the underworld if all objects alive and dead would weep for him. All did, except a <a href="giantess">giantess</a>, <a href="%C3%9E%C3%B6kk">Þökk</a> often presumed to be the god <a href="Loki">Loki</a> in disguise, who refused to mourn the slain god. Thus Baldr had to remain in the underworld, not to emerge until after Ragnarök, when he and his brother Höðr would be reconciled and rule the new earth together with Thor's sons.

Writing at about the end of the 12th century, the <a href="Denmark">Danish</a> historian <a href="Saxo%20Grammaticus">Saxo Grammaticus</a> tells the story of Baldr (recorded as "Balderus") in a form which professes to be historical. According to him, Balderus and Høtherus were rival suitors for the hand of Nanna, daughter of Gewar, King of <a href="Norway">Norway</a>. Balderus was a demigod and common <a href="steel">steel</a> could not wound his sacred body. The two rivals encountered each other in a terrific battle. Though Odin and Thor and the other gods fought for Balderus, he was defeated and fled away, and Høtherus married the princess.

Nevertheless Balderus took heart of grace and again met Høtherus in a stricken field. But he fared even worse than before. Høtherus dealt him a deadly wound with a <a href="magic%20sword">magic sword</a>, named <a href="Mistilteinn">Mistletoe</a>, which he had received from Miming, the satyr of the woods; after lingering three days in pain Balderus died of his injury and was buried with royal honours in a barrow.

There are also two lesser known Danish Latin chronicles, the "<a href="Chronicon%20Lethrense">Chronicon Lethrense</a>" and the "<a href="Annales%20Lundenses">Annales Lundenses</a>" of which the latter is included in the former. These two sources provide a second euhemerized account of Höðr's slaying of Baldr.

It relates that Hother was the king of the <a href="Saxons">Saxons</a> and son of <a href="Hothbrodd">Hothbrod</a> and the daughter of <a href="Hadding">Hadding</a>. Hother first slew Othen's (i.e. Odin) son Balder in battle and then chased Othen and Thor. Finally, Othen's son Both killed Hother. Hother, Balder, Othen and Thor were incorrectly considered to be gods.

A Latin votive inscription from Utrecht, from the 3rd or 4th century C.E., has been theorized as containing the dative form "Baldruo", pointing to a Latin nominative singular *"Baldruus", which some have identified with the Norse/Germanic god, although both the reading and this interpretation have been questioned.

As referenced in "Gylfaginning", in <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> and <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, the <a href="Matricaria%20perforata">scentless mayweed</a> ("Matricaria perforata") and the similar <a href="sea%20mayweed">sea mayweed</a> ("Matricaria maritima") are both called "baldursbrá" "Balder's brow" and regionally in northern England ("baldeyebrow"). In <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> only the former is found. In Germany <a href="lily-of-the-valley">lily-of-the-valley</a> is known as "weisser Baldrian"; variations using or influenced by reflexes of "Phol" include "Faltrian" (upper Austria), Villum"fallum" (Salzburg), and "Fildron" or "Faldron" (Tyrol).

There are a few old place names in Scandinavia that contain the name "Baldr". The most certain and notable one is the (former) parish name <a href="Balleshol">Balleshol</a> in Hedmark county, Norway: "a Balldrshole" 1356 (where the last element is "hóll" m "mound; small hill"). Others may be (in <a href="North%20Germanic%20languages">Norse</a> forms) "Baldrsberg" in Vestfold county, "Baldrsheimr" in Hordaland county "Baldrsnes" in Sør-Trøndelag county—and (very uncertain) the <a href="Balsfjorden">Balsfjorden</a> fjord and <a href="Balsfjord">Balsfjord</a> municipality in Troms county.

In <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, there is also a Baldersgade, or "Balder's Street." A street in downtown <a href="Reykjav%C3%ADk">Reykjavík</a> is called Baldursgata (Baldur's Street).

In <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, the name "Balder" is also used in dialect for a village called <a href="Berlaar">Berlaar</a> and in another village (<a href="Tielen">Tielen</a>), the "Balderij" is a street and a swampy area next to it.

In <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> there are <a href="Baldersby">Baldersby</a> and Pule Hill (from Phol).

In <a href="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a> there is a village called <a href="Balderton">Balderton</a>, originally a vineyard. This is also mentioned also in the <a href="Doomsday%20book">Doomsday book</a>.

<a href="Baldur%2C%20Manitoba">Baldur, Manitoba</a> is a village in southern Manitoba, Canada. About 1890, Sigurdur Christopherson could not find a suitable flower in the district to name the town after, so he suggested the name of a beautiful Nordic God, namely Baldur, son of Odin.

Earlier reflexes of Phol, especially in Baldr's role as opener of wells, appear as Pholesbrunnen (Thuringia), Phulsborn (village, near <a href="Saale">Saale</a> river), Falsbrunn (Steigerwald, Franconia), and the village <a href="Pfalsau">Pfalsau</a> (OHG "pholesauwa", "pholesouwa"). Also, there are two Baldersbrunno (Eifel mountains; Rhine Palatinate) and a Baldur's Brönd on the road between Copenhagen and Roeskilde (<a href="Saxo%20Grammaticus">Saxo Grammaticus</a>).

<doc id="4063" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4063" title="Brísingamen">
Brísingamen

In <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>, Brísingamen (or Brísinga men) is the <a href="torc">torc</a> or <a href="necklace">necklace</a> of the goddess <a href="Freyja">Freyja</a>. The name is an <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> compound "brísinga-men" whose second element is "men" "(ornamental) neck-ring (of precious metal), torc". The etymology of the first element is uncertain. It has been derived from Old Norse "brísingr", a poetic term for "fire" or "amber" mentioned in the anonymous versified word-lists ("þulur") appended to many manuscripts of the <a href="Prose%20Edda">Prose Edda</a>, making Brísingamen "gleaming torc", "sunny torc", or the like. However, "Brísingr" can also be an <a href="ethnonym">ethnonym</a>, in which case "Brísinga men" is "torque of the Brísings"; the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> parallel in "Beowulf" supports this derivation, though who the Brísings (Old Norse "Brísingar") may have been remains unknown.

Brísingamen is referred to in the Anglo-Saxon epic "<a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>" as "Brosinga mene". The brief mention in "Beowulf" is as follows (trans. by Howell Chickering, 1977):

This seems to confuse two different stories as the "Beowulf" poet is clearly referring to the <a href="legends%20about%20Theoderic%20the%20Great">legends about Theoderic the Great</a>. The "<a href="Legends%20about%20Theoderic%20the%20Great%23The%20Thidrekssaga">Þiðrekssaga</a>" tells that the warrior <a href="H%C3%A1ma">Heime</a> ("Háma" in Old English) takes sides against <a href="Ermanaric">Ermanaric</a> ("Eormanric"), king of the <a href="Goths">Goths</a>, and has to flee his kingdom after robbing him; later in life, Hama enters a monastery and gives them all his stolen treasure. However, this saga makes no mention of the great necklace. Possibly the "Beowulf" poet was confused, or invented the addition of the necklace to give him an excuse to drag in a mention of Eormanric. In any case, the necklace given to Beowulf in the story is not the Brísingamen itself; it is only being compared to it.

In the poem "<a href="%C3%9Erymskvi%C3%B0a">Þrymskviða</a>" of the "<a href="Poetic%20Edda">Poetic Edda</a>", <a href="%C3%9Erymr">Þrymr</a>, the king of the <a href="J%C3%B6tunn">jǫtnar</a>, steals <a href="Thor">Thor</a>'s hammer, <a href="Mj%C3%B6lnir">Mjölnir</a>. Freyja lends <a href="Loki">Loki</a> her falcon cloak to search for it; but upon returning, Loki tells Freyja that Þrymr has hidden the hammer and demanded to marry her in return. Freyja is so wrathful that all the <a href="%C3%86sir">Æsir</a>’s halls beneath her are shaken and the necklace Brísingamen breaks off from her neck. Later Thor borrows Brísingamen when he dresses up as Freyja to go to the wedding at <a href="J%C3%B6tunheimr">Jǫtunheimr</a>.

This myth is also recorded in an 18th-century Swedish folksong called "Hammar-Hemtningen" (the taking of the hammer), where Freyja is called Miss Frojenborg, "den väna solen" (the fair sun).

"<a href="H%C3%BAsdr%C3%A1pa">Húsdrápa</a>", a <a href="skald">skald</a>ic poem partially preserved in the "<a href="Prose%20Edda">Prose Edda</a>", relates the story of the theft of Brísingamen by <a href="Loki">Loki</a>. One day when Freyja wakes up and finds Brísingamen missing, she enlists the help of <a href="Heimdallr">Heimdallr</a> to help her search for it. Eventually they find the thief, who turns out to be <a href="Loki">Loki</a> who has transformed himself into a seal. Heimdallr turns into a seal as well and fights Loki. After a lengthy battle at <a href="Singasteinn">Singasteinn</a>, Heimdallr wins and returns Brísingamen to Freyja.

<a href="Snorri%20Sturluson">Snorri Sturluson</a> quoted this old poem in "<a href="Sk%C3%A1ldskaparm%C3%A1l">Skáldskaparmál</a>", saying that because of this legend Heimdall is called "Seeker of Freyja's Necklace" ("Skáldskaparmál", section 8) and Loki is called "Thief of Brísingamen" ("Skáldskaparmál", section 16). A similar story appears in the later "Sörla þáttr", where Heimdallr does not appear.

<a href="S%C3%B6rla%20%C3%BE%C3%A1ttr">Sörla þáttr</a> is a short story in the later and extended version of the "<a href="Flateyjarb%C3%B3k">Saga of Olaf Tryggvason</a>" in the manuscript of the "<a href="Flateyjarb%C3%B3k">Flateyjarbók</a>", which was written and compiled by two <a href="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="priest">priest</a>s, Jon Thordson and Magnus Thorhalson, in the late 14th century. In the end of the story, the arrival of <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> dissolves the old curse that traditionally was to endure until <a href="Ragnar%C3%B6k">Ragnarök</a>.
The battle of Högni and Heðinn is recorded in several medieval sources, including the skaldic poem "<a href="Ragnarsdr%C3%A1pa">Ragnarsdrápa</a>", "Skáldskaparmál" (section 49), and "<a href="Gesta%20Danorum">Gesta Danorum</a>": king Högni's daughter, Hildr, is kidnapped by king Heðinn. When Högni comes to fight Heðinn on an island, Hildr comes to offer her father a necklace on behalf of Heðinn for peace; but the two kings still battle, and <a href="Hildr">Hildr</a> resurrects the fallen to make them fight until Ragnarök. None of these earlier sources mentions Freyja or king Olaf Tryggvason, the historical figure who <a href="Christianize">Christianize</a>d Norway and Iceland in the 10th Century.

A pagan <a href="v%C3%B6lva">völva</a> was buried with considerable splendour in Hagebyhöga in <a href="%C3%96sterg%C3%B6tland">Östergötland</a>. In addition to being buried with her <a href="wand">wand</a>, she had received great riches which included horses, a wagon and an Arabian bronze pitcher. There was also a silver pendant, which represents a woman with a broad necklace around her neck. This kind of necklace was only worn by the most prominent women during the Iron Age and some have interpreted it as <a href="Freyja">Freyja</a>'s necklace Brísingamen. The pendant may represent Freyja herself.

<a href="Alan%20Garner">Alan Garner</a> wrote a children's <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> novel called "<a href="The%20Weirdstone%20of%20Brisingamen">The Weirdstone of Brisingamen</a>" about an enchanted teardrop bracelet.

<a href="Diana%20L.%20Paxson">Diana Paxson's</a> novel "Brisingamen" features Freyja and her bracelet.

<a href="Black%20Phoenix%20Alchemy%20Lab">Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab</a> has a perfumed oil scent named Brisingamen.

Freyja's necklace Brisingamen features prominently in <a href="Betsy%20Tobin">Betsy Tobin</a>'s novel "Iceland", where the necklace is seen to have significant protective powers.

<a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s "<a href="The%20Silmarillion">The Silmarillion</a>" includes a treasure called the <a href="List%20of%20Middle-earth%20objects%23Nauglam%C3%ADr">Nauglamír</a>, which was made by the dwarves of <a href="Eriador">Eriador</a> for the elvish king <a href="Finrod%20Felagund">Finrod Felagund</a>. However, the necklace was brought out a dragon's hoard by <a href="T%C3%BArin%20Turambar">Túrin Turambar</a> and given to King <a href="Thingol">Thingol</a> of <a href="Doriath">Doriath</a>. This king asks a group of dwarves to set a <a href="Silmaril">Silmaril</a> into the necklace for his wife <a href="Melian">Melian</a> to wear. The dwarves fall under the spell of the Silmaril and they claim the Nauglamir as their own – with the Silmaril attached. They kill Thingol and make off with the necklace. It is eventually recovered and is an heirloom of Thingol's descendants, eventually leading <a href="E%C3%A4rendil">Eärendil</a> to <a href="Valinor">Valinor</a> and resulting in the return of the <a href="Vala%20%28Middle-earth%29">Valar</a> into the affairs of <a href="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>. This is clearly intended to be the equivalent in his mythology to the Brísingamen.

In <a href="Christopher%20Paolini">Christopher Paolini</a>'s "<a href="Inheritance%20Cycle">Inheritance Cycle</a>", the word "brisingr" means fire. This is probably a distillation of the word "brisinga".

<a href="Ursula%20Le%20Guin">Ursula Le Guin</a>'s short story "<a href="Semley%27s%20Necklace">Semley's Necklace</a>", the first part of her novel "<a href="Rocannon%27s%20World">Rocannon's World</a>", is a retelling of the Brisingamen story on an alien planet. 

Brisingamen is represented as a card in the <a href="Yu-Gi-Oh%21%20Trading%20Card%20Game">Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game</a>, "Nordic Relic Brisingamen".

Brisingamen was part of MMORPG <a href="Ragnarok%20Online">Ragnarok Online</a> lore, which is ranked as "God item". The game is heavily based from Norse mythology.

In the Firefly Online Game, one of the planets of the <a href="Himinbj%C3%B6rg">Himinbjörg</a> system (which features planets named after figures from Germanic mythology) is named Brisingamen. It is third from the star, and has moons named Freya, Beowulf, and <a href="Alberich">Alberich</a>.

<doc id="4064" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4064" title="Borsuk–Ulam theorem">
Borsuk–Ulam theorem

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, the Borsuk–Ulam theorem (BUT), states that every <a href="continuous%20function">continuous function</a> from an <a href="n-sphere">"n"-sphere</a> into <a href="Euclidean%20space">Euclidean "n"-space</a> maps some pair of <a href="antipodal%20point">antipodal point</a>s to the same point. Here, two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they are in exactly opposite directions from the sphere's center.

Formally: if formula_1 is continuous then there exists an formula_2 such that: formula_3.

The case formula_4 can be illustrated by saying that there always exist a pair of opposite points on the earth's equator with the same temperature. The same is true for any circle. This assumes the temperature varies continuously.

The case formula_5 is often illustrated by saying that at any moment, there is always a pair of antipodal points on the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s surface with equal temperatures and equal barometric pressures.

BUT has several equivalent statements in terms of <a href="odd%20function">odd function</a>s. Recall that formula_6 is the <a href="n-sphere">"n"-sphere</a> and formula_7 is the <a href="n-ball">"n"-ball</a>:

According to , the first historical mention of the statement of BUT appears in . The first proof was given by , where the formulation of the problem was attributed to <a href="Stanislaw%20Ulam">Stanislaw Ulam</a>. Since then, many alternative proofs have been found by various authors, as collected by .

The following statements are equivalent to BUT.

A function formula_16 is called "odd" (aka "antipodal" or "antipode-preserving") if for every formula_17: formula_18.

BUT is equivalent to the following statement: A continuous odd function from an "n"-sphere into Euclidean "n"-space has a zero. PROOF: 

Define a "retraction" as a function formula_25.

BUT is equivalent to the following claim: there is no continuous odd retraction.

PROOF: If BUT is correct, then every continuous odd function from formula_6 must include 0 in its range. However, formula_27 so there cannot be a continuous odd function whose range is formula_12.

Conversely, if BUT is incorrect, then there is a continuous odd function formula_29 with no zeroes. Then we can construct another odd function formula_25 by:

since formula_16 has no zeroes, formula_33 is well-defined and continuous. Thus we have a continuous odd retraction.

The 1-dimensional case can easily be proved using the <a href="intermediate%20value%20theorem">intermediate value theorem</a> (IVT).

Let formula_16 be an odd real-valued continuous function on a circle. Pick an arbitrary formula_17. If formula_10 then we are done. Otherwise, w.l.o.g. formula_37. But formula_38. Hence, by the IVT there is a point formula_39 between formula_17 and formula_41 on which formula_42.

Assume that formula_25 is an odd continuous function with formula_44 (the case formula_45 is treated above, the case formula_46 can be handled using basic <a href="Covering%20space">covering theory</a>). By passing to orbits under the antipodal action, we then get an induced function formula_47, which induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups. By the <a href="Hurewicz%20theorem">Hurewicz theorem</a>, the induced map on cohomology with formula_48 coefficients, formula_49, sends formula_50 to formula_51. But then we get that formula_52 is sent to formula_53, a contradiction.

One can also show the stronger statement that any odd map formula_54 has odd degree and then deduce BUT from this result.

BUT can be proved from <a href="Tucker%27s%20lemma">Tucker's lemma</a>.

Let formula_8 be a continuous odd function. Because "g" is continuous on a compact domain, it is <a href="uniformly%20continuous">uniformly continuous</a>. Therefore, for every formula_56, there is a formula_57 such that, for every two points of formula_58 which are within formula_59 of each other, their images under "g" are within formula_60 of each other.

Define a triangulation of formula_58 with edges of length at most formula_59. Label each vertex formula_63 of the triangulation with a label formula_64 in the following way:
Because "g" is odd, the labeling is also odd: formula_67. Hence, by Tucker's lemma, there are two adjacent vertices formula_68 with opposite labels. Assume w.l.o.g. that the labels are formula_69. By definition of "l", this means that in both formula_70 and formula_71, coordinate #1 is the largest coordinate; in formula_70 this coordinate is positive while in formula_71 it is negative. By the construction of the triangulation, the distance between formula_70 and formula_71 is at most formula_60; this means that both formula_77 and formula_78 are bounded by formula_60.

The above is true for every formula_60; hence there must be a point "u" in which formula_81.


Above we showed how to prove BUT from Tucker's lemma. The converse is also true: it is possible to prove Tucker's lemma from BUT. Therefore, these two theorems are equivalent.
1. In the original BUT, the domain of the function "f" is the unit "n"-sphere (the boundary of the unit "n"-ball). In general, it is true also when the domain of "f" is the boundary of any open bounded symmetric subset of "R" containing the origin (Here, symmetric means that if "x" is in the subset then -"x" is also in the subset).

2. Consider the function "A" which maps a point to its antipodal point: "A(x)=-x". Note that "A(A(x))=x". The original BUT claims that there is a point "x" in which "f(A(x))=f(x)". In general, this is true also for every function "A" for which "A(A(x))=x". However, in general this is not true for other functions "A".

<doc id="4067" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4067" title="Bragi">
Bragi

Bragi is the <a href="skald">skald</a>ic god of <a href="poetry">poetry</a> in <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>.

"Bragi" is generally associated with "bragr", the Norse word for <a href="poetry">poetry</a>. The name of the god may have been derived from "bragr", or the term "bragr" may have been formed to describe 'what Bragi does'. A connection between the name Bragi and Old English "brego" 'chieftain' has been suggested but is generally now discounted. A connection between Bragi and the "bragarfull" 'promise cup' is sometimes suggested, as "bragafull", an alternate form of the word, might be translated as 'Bragi's cup'. See <a href="Bragarfull">Bragarfull</a>.

<a href="Snorri%20Sturluson">Snorri Sturluson</a> writes in the "<a href="Gylfaginning">Gylfaginning</a>" after describing <a href="Odin">Odin</a>, <a href="Thor">Thor</a>, and <a href="Baldr">Baldr</a>:
In "<a href="Sk%C3%A1ldskaparm%C3%A1l">Skáldskaparmál</a>" Snorri writes:
That Bragi is Odin's son is clearly mentioned only here and in some versions of a list of the sons of Odin (see <a href="Sons%20of%20Odin">Sons of Odin</a>). But "wish-son" in stanza 16 of the "<a href="Lokasenna">Lokasenna</a>" could mean "Odin's son" and is translated by Hollander as "Odin's kin". Bragi's mother is possibly the giantess <a href="Gunnlod">Gunnlod</a>. If Bragi's mother is <a href="Frigg">Frigg</a>, then Frigg is somewhat dismissive of Bragi in the "Lokasenna" in stanza 27 when Frigg complains that if she had a son in <a href="%C3%86gir">Ægir</a>'s hall as brave as <a href="Baldr">Baldr</a> then <a href="Loki">Loki</a> would have to fight for his life.

In that poem Bragi at first forbids Loki to enter the hall but is overruled by Odin. Loki then gives a greeting to all gods and goddesses who are in the hall save to Bragi. Bragi generously offers his sword, horse, and an arm ring as peace gift but Loki only responds by accusing Bragi of cowardice, of being the most afraid to fight of any of the <a href="%C3%86sir">Æsir</a> and <a href="Elves">Elves</a> within the hall. Bragi responds that if they were outside the hall, he would have Loki's head, but Loki only repeats the accusation. When Bragi's wife Iðunn attempts to calm Bragi, Loki accuses her of embracing her brother's slayer, a reference to matters that have not survived. It may be that Bragi had slain Iðunn's brother.

A passage in the "Poetic Edda" poem "<a href="Sigrdr%C3%ADfum%C3%A1l">Sigrdrífumál</a>" describes runes being graven on the sun, on the ear of one of the sun-horses and on the hoofs of the other, on <a href="Sleipnir">Sleipnir</a>'s teeth, on bear's paw, on eagle's beak, on wolf's claw, and on several other things including on Bragi's tongue. Then the runes are shaved off and the shavings are mixed with mead and sent abroad so that Æsir have some, Elves have some, <a href="Vanir">Vanir</a> have some, and Men have some, these being beech runes and birth runes, ale runes, and magic runes. The meaning of this is obscure.

The first part of Snorri Sturluson's "<a href="Sk%C3%A1ldskaparm%C3%A1l">Skáldskaparmál</a>" is a dialogue between <a href="%C3%86gir">Ægir</a> and Bragi about the nature of poetry, particularly skaldic poetry. Bragi tells the origin of the mead of poetry from the blood of <a href="Kvasir">Kvasir</a> and how Odin obtained this mead. He then goes on to discuss various poetic metaphors known as "<a href="kenning">kenning</a>s".

Snorri Sturluson clearly distinguishes the god Bragi from the mortal skald Bragi Boddason, whom he often mentions separately. The appearance of Bragi in the "Lokasenna" indicates that if these two Bragis were originally the same, they have become separated for that author also, or that chronology has become very muddled and Bragi Boddason has been relocated to mythological time. Compare the appearance of the <a href="Wales">Welsh</a> <a href="Taliesin">Taliesin</a> in the second branch of the <a href="Mabinogion">Mabinogi</a>. Legendary chronology sometimes does become muddled. Whether Bragi the god originally arose as a deified version of Bragi Boddason was much debated in the 19th century, especially by the scholars <a href="Eugen%20Mogk">Eugen Mogk</a> and <a href="Sophus%20Bugge">Sophus Bugge</a>. The debate remains undecided.

In the poem "<a href="Eir%C3%ADksm%C3%A1l">Eiríksmál</a>" Odin, in <a href="Valhalla">Valhalla</a>, hears the coming of the dead <a href="Norway">Norwegian</a> king <a href="Eric%20Bloodaxe">Eric Bloodaxe</a> and his host, and bids the heroes <a href="Sigmund">Sigmund</a> and <a href="Sinfj%C3%B6tli">Sinfjötli</a> rise to greet him. Bragi is then mentioned, questioning how Odin knows that it is Eric and why Odin has let such a king die. In the poem "<a href="H%C3%A1konarm%C3%A1l">Hákonarmál</a>", Hákon the Good is taken to Valhalla by the <a href="valkyrie">valkyrie</a> <a href="G%C3%B6ndul">Göndul</a> and Odin sends <a href="Herm%C3%B3%C3%B0r">Hermóðr</a> and Bragi to greet him. In these poems Bragi could be either a god or a dead hero in Valhalla. Attempting to decide is further confused because "Hermóðr" also seems to be sometimes the name of a god and sometimes the name of a hero. That Bragi was also the first to speak to Loki in the "Lokasenna" as Loki attempted to enter the hall might be a parallel. It might have been useful and customary that a man of great eloquence and versed in poetry should greet those entering a hall.

In the "Prose Edda" Snorri Sturluson quotes many stanzas attributed to Bragi Boddason the old ("Bragi Boddason inn gamli"), a Norwegian court poet who served several Swedish kings, <a href="Ragnar%20Lodbrok">Ragnar Lodbrok</a>, <a href="%C3%96sten%20Beli">Östen Beli</a> and <a href="Bj%C3%B6rn%20at%20Hauge">Björn at Hauge</a> who reigned in the first half of the 9th century. This Bragi was reckoned as the first skaldic poet, and was certainly the earliest skaldic poet then remembered by name whose verse survived in memory.

Snorri especially quotes passages from Bragi's "<a href="Ragnarsdr%C3%A1pa">Ragnarsdrápa</a>", a poem supposedly composed in honor of the famous legendary Viking <a href="Ragnar%20Lodbrok">Ragnar Lodbrók</a> ('Hairy-breeches') describing the images on a decorated shield which Ragnar had given to Bragi. The images included Thor's fishing for <a href="J%C3%B6rmungandr">Jörmungandr</a>, <a href="Gefjun">Gefjun</a>'s ploughing of <a href="Zealand%20%28Denmark%29">Zealand</a> from the soil of Sweden, the attack of <a href="Hamdir%20and%20Sorli">Hamdir and Sorli</a> against King <a href="Ermanaric">Jörmunrekk</a>, and the never-ending battle between <a href="Hedin%20and%20H%C3%B6gni">Hedin and Högni</a>.

Bragi son of Hálfdan the Old is mentioned only in the "Skjáldskaparmál". This Bragi is the sixth of the second of two groups of nine sons fathered by King Hálfdan the Old on Alvig the Wise, daughter of King Eymund of <a href="Novgorod">Hólmgard</a>. This second group of sons are all eponymous ancestors of legendary families of the north. Snorri says:

Bragi, from whom the Bragnings are sprung (that is the race of Hálfdan the Generous).

Of the Bragnings as a race and of Hálfdan the Generous nothing else is known. However, "Bragning" is often, like some others of these dynastic names, used in poetry as a general word for 'king' or 'ruler'.

In the eddic poem "<a href="Helgakvi%C3%B0a%20Hundingsbana%20II">Helgakviða Hundingsbana II</a>", Bragi Högnason, his brother Dag, and his sister Sigrún were children of <a href="H%C3%B6gne">Högne</a>, the king of <a href="East%20G%C3%B6taland">East Götaland</a>. The poem relates how <a href="Sigmund">Sigmund</a>'s son <a href="Helgi%20Hundingsbane">Helgi Hundingsbane</a> agreed to take Sigrún daughter of Högni as his wife against her unwilling betrothal to Hodbrodd son of <a href="Granmar">Granmar</a> the king of <a href="S%C3%B6dermanland">Södermanland</a>. In the subsequent battle of Frekastein (probably one of the 300 <a href="hill%20fort">hill fort</a>s of Södermanland, as "stein" meant "hill fort") against Högni and Grammar, all the chieftains on Granmar's side are slain, including Bragi, except for Bragi's brother Dag.

Blaise Pascal

Blaise Pascal (; ; 19 June 1623 – 19 August 1662) was a French <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a>, <a href="physicist">physicist</a>, inventor, writer and <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Catholic</a> theologian. He was a <a href="child%20prodigy">child prodigy</a> who was educated by his father, a tax collector in <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>. Pascal's earliest work was in the natural and applied sciences where he made important contributions to the study of <a href="fluid">fluid</a>s, and clarified the concepts of <a href="pressure">pressure</a> and <a href="vacuum">vacuum</a> by generalising the work of <a href="Evangelista%20Torricelli">Evangelista Torricelli</a>. Pascal also wrote in defence of the <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a>.

In 1642, while still a teenager, he started some pioneering work on calculating machines. After three years of effort and 50 prototypes, he built 20 finished machines (called <a href="Pascal%27s%20calculator">Pascal's calculator</a>s and later Pascalines) over the following 10 years, establishing him as one of the first two inventors of the <a href="mechanical%20calculator">mechanical calculator</a>.

Pascal was an important mathematician, helping create two major new areas of research: he wrote a significant treatise on the subject of <a href="projective%20geometry">projective geometry</a> at the age of 16, and later corresponded with <a href="Pierre%20de%20Fermat">Pierre de Fermat</a> on <a href="probability%20theory">probability theory</a>, strongly influencing the development of modern economics and <a href="social%20sciences">social science</a>. Following <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> and Torricelli, in 1647, he rebutted <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s followers who insisted that <a href="Horror%20vacui%20%28physics%29">nature abhors a vacuum</a>. Pascal's results caused many disputes before being accepted.

In 1646, he and his sister Jacqueline identified with the religious movement within <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> known by its detractors as <a href="Jansenism">Jansenism</a>. His father died in 1651. Following a religious experience in late 1654, he began writing influential works on philosophy and theology. His two most famous works date from this period: the "<a href="Lettres%20provinciales">Lettres provinciales</a>" and the "<a href="Pens%C3%A9es">Pensées</a>", the former set in the conflict between Jansenists and <a href="Jesuits">Jesuits</a>. In that year, he also wrote an important treatise on the arithmetical triangle. Between 1658 and 1659 he wrote on the <a href="cycloid">cycloid</a> and its use in calculating the volume of solids.

Pascal had poor health, especially after the age of 18, and he died just two months after his 39th birthday.

Pascal was born in <a href="Clermont-Ferrand">Clermont-Ferrand</a>, which is in France's <a href="Auvergne%20%28region%29">Auvergne region</a>. He lost his mother, Antoinette Begon, at the age of three. His father, <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Pascal">Étienne Pascal</a> (1588–1651), who also had an interest in science and mathematics, was a local judge and member of the "<a href="Nobles%20of%20the%20Robe">Noblesse de Robe</a>". Pascal had two sisters, the younger <a href="Jacqueline%20Pascal">Jacqueline</a> and the elder Gilberte.

In 1631, five years after the death of his wife, Étienne Pascal moved with his children to Paris. The newly arrived family soon hired Louise Delfault, a maid who eventually became an instrumental member of the family. Étienne, who never remarried, decided that he alone would educate his children, for they all showed extraordinary intellectual ability, particularly his son Blaise. The young Pascal showed an amazing aptitude for mathematics and science.

Particularly of interest to Pascal was a work of <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Desargues">Desargues</a> on <a href="conic%20section">conic section</a>s. Following Desargues' thinking, the 16-year-old Pascal produced, as a means of proof, a short treatise on what was called the "Mystic Hexagram", "Essai pour les coniques" ("Essay on Conics") and sent it—his first serious work of mathematics—to <a href="Marin%20Mersenne">Père Mersenne</a> in Paris; it is known still today as <a href="Pascal%27s%20theorem">Pascal's theorem</a>. It states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a circle (or conic) then the three intersection points of opposite sides lie on a line (called the Pascal line).

Pascal's work was so precocious that Descartes was convinced that Pascal's father had written it. When assured by Mersenne that it was, indeed, the product of the son and not the father, Descartes dismissed it with a sniff: "I do not find it strange that he has offered demonstrations about conics more appropriate than those of the ancients," adding, "but other matters related to this subject can be proposed that would scarcely occur to a 16-year-old child."

In France at that time offices and positions could be—and were—bought and sold. In 1631 Étienne sold his position as second president of the "<a href="Cour%20des%20Aides">Cour des Aides</a>" for 65,665 <a href="livres">livres</a>. The money was invested in a <a href="government%20bond">government bond</a> which provided, if not a lavish, then certainly a comfortable income which allowed the Pascal family to move to, and enjoy, Paris. But in 1638 Richelieu, desperate for money to carry on the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>, defaulted on the government's bonds. Suddenly Étienne Pascal's worth had dropped from nearly 66,000 livres to less than 7,300.

Like so many others, Étienne was eventually forced to flee Paris because of his opposition to the fiscal policies of <a href="Cardinal%20Richelieu">Cardinal Richelieu</a>, leaving his three children in the care of his neighbour Madame Sainctot, a great beauty with an infamous past who kept one of the most glittering and intellectual salons in all France. It was only when Jacqueline performed well in a children's play with Richelieu in attendance that Étienne was pardoned. In time, Étienne was back in good graces with the cardinal and in 1639 had been appointed the king's commissioner of taxes in the city of <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>—a city whose tax records, thanks to uprisings, were in utter chaos.

In 1642, in an effort to ease his father's endless, exhausting calculations, and recalculations, of taxes owed and paid (into which work the young Pascal had been recruited), Pascal, not yet 19, constructed a mechanical calculator capable of addition and subtraction, called "<a href="Pascal%27s%20calculator">Pascal's calculator</a>" or the "Pascaline". Of the eight Pascalines known to have survived, four are held by the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20des%20Arts%20et%20M%C3%A9tiers">Musée des Arts et Métiers</a> in Paris and one more by the <a href="Zwinger%20museum">Zwinger museum</a> in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>, Germany, exhibit two of his original mechanical calculators. Though these machines are pioneering forerunners to a further 400 years of development of mechanical methods of calculation, and in a sense to the later field of <a href="computer%20engineering">computer engineering</a>, the calculator failed to be a great commercial success. Partly because it was still quite cumbersome to use in practice, but probably primarily because it was extraordinarily expensive, the Pascaline became little more than a toy, and a <a href="status%20symbol">status symbol</a>, for the very rich both in France and elsewhere in Europe. Pascal continued to make improvements to his design through the next decade, and he refers to some 50 machines that were built to his design.

Pascal continued to influence mathematics throughout his life. His "Traité du triangle arithmétique" ("Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle") of 1653 described a convenient tabular presentation for <a href="binomial%20coefficient">binomial coefficient</a>s, now called <a href="Pascal%27s%20triangle">Pascal's triangle</a>. The triangle can also be represented:
He defines the numbers in the triangle by <a href="recursion">recursion</a>: Call the number in the ("m" + 1)th row and ("n" + 1)th column "t". Then "t" = "t" + "t", for "m" = 0, 1, 2, ... and "n" = 0, 1, 2, ... The boundary conditions are "t" = 0, "t" = 0 for "m" = 1, 2, 3, ... and "n" = 1, 2, 3, ... The generator "t" = 1. Pascal concludes with the proof,

In 1654 he proved <a href="Faulhaber%27s%20formula">"Pascal's identity"</a> relating the sums of the "p"-th powers of the first "n" positive integers for "p" = 0, 1, 2, …, "k".

In 1654, prompted by his friend the <a href="Chevalier%20de%20M%C3%A9r%C3%A9">Chevalier de Méré</a>, he corresponded with <a href="Pierre%20de%20Fermat">Pierre de Fermat</a> on the subject of gambling problems, and from that collaboration was born the mathematical theory of <a href="probability">probabilities</a>. The specific problem was that of two players who want to finish a game early and, given the current circumstances of the game, want to <a href="division%20of%20the%20stakes">divide the stakes fairly</a>, based on the chance each has of winning the game from that point. From this discussion, the notion of <a href="expected%20value">expected value</a> was introduced. Pascal later (in the "Pensées") used a probabilistic argument, <a href="Pascal%27s%20Wager">Pascal's Wager</a>, to justify belief in God and a virtuous life. The work done by Fermat and Pascal into the calculus of probabilities laid important groundwork for <a href="Gottfried%20Wilhelm%20Leibniz">Leibniz</a>' formulation of the <a href="calculus">calculus</a>.

After a religious experience in 1654, Pascal mostly gave up work in mathematics.

Pascal's major contribution to the <a href="philosophy%20of%20mathematics">philosophy of mathematics</a> came with his "De l'Esprit géométrique" ("Of the Geometrical Spirit"), originally written as a preface to a geometry textbook for one of the famous ""<a href="Petites%20%C3%A9coles%20de%20Port-Royal">Petites-Ecoles de Port-Royal</a>" ("Little Schools of Port-Royal")". The work was unpublished until over a century after his death. Here, Pascal looked into the issue of discovering truths, arguing that the ideal of such a method would be to found all propositions on already established truths. At the same time, however, he claimed this was impossible because such established truths would require other truths to back them up—first principles, therefore, cannot be reached. Based on this, Pascal argued that the procedure used in geometry was as perfect as possible, with certain principles assumed and other propositions developed from them. Nevertheless, there was no way to know the assumed principles to be true.

Pascal also used "De l'Esprit géométrique" to develop a theory of <a href="definition">definition</a>. He distinguished between definitions which are conventional labels defined by the writer and definitions which are within the language and understood by everyone because they naturally designate their referent. The second type would be characteristic of the philosophy of <a href="essentialism">essentialism</a>. Pascal claimed that only definitions of the first type were important to science and mathematics, arguing that those fields should adopt the philosophy of <a href="Formalism%20%28philosophy%29">formalism</a> as formulated by Descartes.

In "De l'Art de persuader" ("On the Art of Persuasion"), Pascal looked deeper into geometry's <a href="axiomatic%20method">axiomatic method</a>, specifically the question of how people come to be convinced of the <a href="axioms">axioms</a> upon which later conclusions are based. Pascal agreed with <a href="Montaigne">Montaigne</a> that achieving certainty in these axioms and conclusions through human methods is impossible. He asserted that these principles can be grasped only through intuition, and that this fact underscored the necessity for submission to God in searching out truths.

Pascal's work in the fields of the study of <a href="hydrodynamics">hydrodynamics</a> and <a href="hydrostatics">hydrostatics</a> centered on the principles of <a href="hydraulic%20fluid">hydraulic fluid</a>s. His inventions include the <a href="hydraulic%20press">hydraulic press</a> (using hydraulic pressure to multiply force) and the <a href="syringe">syringe</a>. He proved that hydrostatic pressure depends not on the weight of the fluid but on the elevation difference. He demonstrated this principle by attaching a thin tube to a barrel full of water and filling the tube with water up to the level of the third floor of a building. This caused the barrel to leak, in what became known as <a href="Pascal%27s%20barrel">Pascal's barrel</a> experiment.

By 1647, Pascal had learned of <a href="Evangelista%20Torricelli">Evangelista Torricelli</a>'s experimentation with <a href="barometer">barometer</a>s. Having replicated an experiment that involved placing a tube filled with mercury upside down in a bowl of mercury, Pascal questioned what force kept some mercury in the tube and what filled the space above the mercury in the tube. At the time, most scientists contended that, rather than a <a href="vacuum">vacuum</a>, some invisible matter was present. This was based on the Aristotelian notion that creation was a thing of substance, whether visible or invisible; and that this substance was forever in motion. Furthermore, "Everything that is in motion must be moved by something," <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> declared. Therefore, to the Aristotelian trained scientists of Pascal's time, a vacuum was an impossibility. How so? As proof it was pointed out:

Following more experimentation in this vein, in 1647 Pascal produced "Experiences nouvelles touchant le vide" ("New experiments with the vacuum"), which detailed basic rules describing to what degree various liquids could be supported by air pressure. It also provided reasons why it was indeed a vacuum above the column of liquid in a barometer tube. This work was followed by "Récit de la grande expérience de l’équilibre des liqueurs" ("Account of the great experiment on equilibrium in liquids") published in 1648.

On 19 September 1648, after many months of Pascal's friendly but insistent prodding, <a href="Florin%20P%C3%A9rier">Florin Périer</a>, husband of Pascal's elder sister Gilberte, was finally able to carry out the fact-finding mission vital to Pascal's theory. The account, written by Périer, reads:

Pascal replicated the experiment in Paris by carrying a barometer up to the top of the bell tower at the church of <a href="Saint-Jacques%20Tower">Saint-Jacques-de-la-Boucherie</a>, a height of about 50 metres. The mercury dropped two lines.

In the face of criticism that some invisible matter must exist in Pascal's empty space, Pascal, in his reply to <a href="Estienne%20Noel">Estienne Noel</a>, gave one of the 17th century's major statements on the scientific method, which is a striking anticipation of the idea popularised by <a href="Karl%20Popper">Karl Popper</a> that scientific theories are characterised by their <a href="falsifiability">falsifiability</a>: "In order to show that a hypothesis is evident, it does not suffice that all the phenomena follow from it; instead, if it leads to something contrary to a single one of the phenomena, that suffices to establish its falsity." His insistence on the existence of the vacuum also led to conflict with other prominent scientists, including Descartes.

Pascal introduced a primitive form of <a href="roulette">roulette</a> and the roulette wheel in his search for a <a href="perpetual%20motion">perpetual motion</a> machine.

In the winter of 1646, Pascal's 58-year-old father broke his hip when he slipped and fell on an icy street of Rouen; given the man's age and the state of medicine in the 17th century, a <a href="Hip%20fracture">broken hip</a> could be a very serious condition, perhaps even fatal. Rouen was home to two of the finest doctors in France: Monsieur Doctor Deslandes and Monsieur Doctor de La Bouteillerie. The elder Pascal "would not let anyone other than these men attend him...It was a good choice, for the old man survived and was able to walk again..." But treatment and rehabilitation took three months, during which time La Bouteillerie and Deslandes had become household guests.

Both men were followers of <a href="Jean%20Guillebert">Jean Guillebert</a>, proponent of a splinter group from Catholic teaching known as <a href="Jansenism">Jansenism</a>. This still fairly small sect was making surprising inroads into the French Catholic community at that time. It espoused rigorous <a href="Augustinism">Augustinism</a>. Blaise spoke with the doctors frequently, and upon his successful treatment of Étienne, borrowed from them works by Jansenist authors. In this period, Pascal experienced a sort of "first conversion" and began to write on theological subjects in the course of the following year.

Pascal fell away from this initial religious engagement and experienced a few years of what some biographers have called his "worldly period" (1648–54). His father died in 1651 and left his inheritance to Pascal and Jacqueline, for whom Pascal acted as her conservator. Jacqueline announced that she would soon become a <a href="postulant">postulant</a> in the Jansenist convent of <a href="Port-Royal-des-Champs">Port-Royal</a>. Pascal was deeply affected and very sad, not because of her choice, but because of his chronic poor health; he too needed her.

By the end of October in 1651, a truce had been reached between brother and sister. In return for a healthy annual stipend, Jacqueline signed over her part of the inheritance to her brother. Gilberte had already been given her inheritance in the form of a dowry. In early January, Jacqueline left for Port-Royal. On that day, according to Gilberte concerning her brother, "He retired very sadly to his rooms without seeing Jacqueline, who was waiting in the little parlor..."
In early June 1653, after what must have seemed like endless badgering from Jacqueline,
Pascal formally signed over the whole of his sister's inheritance to Port-Royal, which, to him, "had begun to smell like a cult." With two thirds of his father's estate now gone, the 29-year-old Pascal was now consigned to genteel poverty.

For a while, Pascal pursued the life of a bachelor. During visits to his sister at Port-Royal in 1654, he displayed contempt for affairs of the world but was not drawn to God.

On 23 November 1654, between 10:30 and 12:30 at night, Pascal had an intense <a href="Vision%20%28religion%29">religious vision</a> and immediately recorded the experience in a brief note to himself which began: "Fire. God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, not of the philosophers and the scholars..." and concluded by quoting Psalm 119:16: "I will not forget thy word. Amen." He seems to have carefully sewn this document into his coat and always transferred it when he changed clothes; a servant discovered it only by chance after his death. This piece is now known as the "Memorial". The story of the carriage accident as having led to the experience described in the "Memorial" is disputed by some scholars.
His belief and religious commitment revitalized, Pascal visited the older of two convents at <a href="Port-Royal-des-Champs">Port-Royal</a> for a two-week retreat in January 1655. For the next four years, he regularly travelled between Port-Royal and Paris. It was at this point immediately after his conversion when he began writing his first major literary work on religion, the "Provincial Letters".

Beginning in 1656–57, Pascal published his memorable attack on <a href="casuistry">casuistry</a>, a popular <a href="Ethics">ethical</a> method used by <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> thinkers in the early modern period (especially the <a href="Jesuits">Jesuits</a>, and in particular <a href="Antonio%20Escobar%20y%20Mendoza">Antonio Escobar</a>). Pascal denounced casuistry as the mere use of complex reasoning to justify moral laxity and all sorts of <a href="sin">sin</a>s. The 18-letter series was published between 1656 and 1657 under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte and incensed <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV</a>. The king ordered that the book be shredded and burnt in 1660. In 1661, in the midsts of the <a href="formulary%20controversy">formulary controversy</a>, the Jansenist school at Port-Royal was condemned and closed down; those involved with the school had to sign a 1656 <a href="papal%20bull">papal bull</a> condemning the teachings of Jansen as heretical. The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied <a href="Alexander%20VII">Alexander VII</a> himself. Even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal's arguments.

Aside from their religious influence, the "Provincial Letters" were popular as a literary work. Pascal's use of humor, mockery, and vicious satire in his arguments made the letters ripe for public consumption, and influenced the prose of later French writers like <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> and <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>.

Charles Perrault wrote of the "Letters": "Everything is there—purity of language, nobility of thought, solidity in reasoning, finesse in raillery, and throughout an "agrément" not to be found anywhere else."

Pascal's most influential theological work, referred to posthumously as the "Pensées" ("Thoughts"), was not completed before his death. It was to have been a sustained and coherent examination and defense of the <a href="Christian%20faith">Christian faith</a>, with the original title "Apologie de la religion Chrétienne" ("Defense of the Christian Religion"). The first version of the numerous scraps of paper found after his death appeared in print as a book in 1669 titled "Pensées de M. Pascal sur la religion, et sur quelques autres sujets" ("Thoughts of M. Pascal on religion, and on some other subjects") and soon thereafter became a classic. One of the "Apologie"s main strategies was to use the contradictory philosophies of <a href="skepticism">skepticism</a> and <a href="stoicism">stoicism</a>, personalized by <a href="Michel%20de%20Montaigne">Montaigne</a> on one hand, and <a href="Epictetus">Epictetus</a> on the other, in order to bring the unbeliever to such despair and confusion that he would embrace God.

Pascal's "Pensées" is widely considered to be a masterpiece, and a landmark in "French prose". When commenting on one particular section (Thought #72), <a href="Charles%20Augustin%20Sainte-Beuve">Sainte-Beuve</a> praised it as the finest pages in the <a href="French%20language">French language</a>.

<a href="Will%20Durant">Will Durant</a> hailed the Pensées as "the most eloquent book in French prose". In the "Pensées", Pascal surveys several philosophical paradoxes: infinity and nothing, faith and reason, soul and matter, death and life, meaning and vanity – seemingly arriving at no definitive conclusions besides humility, ignorance, and grace. Rolling these into one he develops, known as the <a href="Pascal%27s%20Wager">Pascal's Wager</a>.

<a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a> described him during this phase of his life as "a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic among men of the world." Pascal's ascetic lifestyle derived from a belief that it was natural and necessary for a person to suffer. In 1659, Pascal fell seriously ill. During his last years, he frequently tried to reject the ministrations of his doctors, saying, "Sickness is the natural state of Christians."

Louis XIV suppressed the Jansenist movement at Port-Royal in 1661. In response, Pascal wrote one of his final works, "Écrit sur la signature du formulaire" ("Writ on the Signing of the Form"), exhorting the Jansenists not to give in. Later that year, his sister Jacqueline died, which convinced Pascal to cease his <a href="polemics">polemics</a> on <a href="Jansenism">Jansenism</a>. Pascal's last major achievement, returning to his mechanical genius, was inaugurating perhaps the first bus line, moving passengers within Paris in a carriage with many seats.

In 1662, Pascal's illness became more violent, and his emotional condition had severely worsened since his sister's death. Aware that his health was fading quickly, he sought a move to the hospital for incurable diseases, but his doctors declared that he was too unstable to be carried. In Paris on 18 August 1662, Pascal went into convulsions and received <a href="extreme%20unction">extreme unction</a>. He died the next morning, his last words being "May God never abandon me," and was buried in the cemetery of <a href="Saint-%C3%89tienne-du-Mont">Saint-Étienne-du-Mont</a>.

An <a href="autopsy">autopsy</a> performed after his death revealed grave problems with his stomach and other organs of his abdomen, along with <a href="brain%20damage">damage to his brain</a>. Despite the autopsy, the cause of his poor health was never precisely determined, though speculation focuses on <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, <a href="stomach%20cancer">stomach cancer</a>, or a combination of the two. The headaches which afflicted Pascal are generally attributed to his brain <a href="lesion">lesion</a>.

In honour of his scientific contributions, the name "Pascal" has been given to the <a href="pascal%20%28unit%29">SI unit of pressure</a>, to a <a href="Pascal%20%28programming%20language%29">programming language</a>, and <a href="Pascal%27s%20law">Pascal's law</a> (an important principle of hydrostatics), and as mentioned above, Pascal's triangle and Pascal's wager still bear his name.

Pascal's development of probability theory was his most influential contribution to mathematics. Originally applied to gambling, today it is extremely important in economics, especially in <a href="actuarial%20science">actuarial science</a>. John Ross writes, "Probability theory and the discoveries following it changed the way we regard uncertainty, risk, decision-making, and an individual's and society's ability to influence the course of future events." However, it should be noted that Pascal and Fermat, though doing important early work in probability theory, did not develop the field very far. <a href="Christiaan%20Huygens">Christiaan Huygens</a>, learning of the subject from the correspondence of Pascal and Fermat, wrote the first book on the subject. Later figures who continued the development of the theory include <a href="Abraham%20de%20Moivre">Abraham de Moivre</a> and <a href="Pierre-Simon%20Laplace">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a>.

In literature, Pascal is regarded as one of the most important authors of the French Classical Period and is read today as one of the greatest masters of French prose. His use of satire and wit influenced later <a href="polemic">polemic</a>ists. The content of his literary work is best remembered for its strong opposition to the <a href="rationalism">rationalism</a> of <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a> and simultaneous assertion that the main countervailing philosophy, <a href="empiricism">empiricism</a>, was also insufficient for determining major truths.

In France, prestigious annual awards, <a href="Blaise%20Pascal%20Chair">Blaise Pascal Chair</a>s are given to outstanding international scientists to conduct their research in the <a href="%C3%8Ele-de-France%20%28region%29">Ile de France</a> region. One of the Universities of <a href="Clermont-Ferrand">Clermont-Ferrand</a>, France – <a href="Universit%C3%A9%20Blaise%20Pascal">Université Blaise Pascal</a> – is named after him. The <a href="University%20of%20Waterloo">University of Waterloo</a>, Ontario, Canada, holds an annual math contest named in his honour.

Pascalian theology has grown out of his perspective that we are, according to Wood, "born into a duplicitous world that shapes us into duplicitous subjects and so we find it easy to reject God continually and deceive ourselves about our own sinfulness".

Brittonic languages

The Brittonic, Brythonic or British Celtic languages (, , ) form one of the two branches of the <a href="Insular%20Celtic%20languages">Insular Celtic</a> language family; the other is <a href="Goidelic%20languages">Goidelic</a>. The name "Brythonic" was derived by <a href="Wales">Welsh</a> <a href="Celtic%20studies">Celticist</a> <a href="John%20Rhys">John Rhys</a> from the <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a> word "Brython", meaning an indigenous <a href="Britons%20%28Celtic%20people%29">Briton</a> as opposed to an <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> or <a href="Gaels">Gael</a>. The name "Brittonic" derives ultimately from the name "Prettanike", recorded by Greek authors for the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>. Some authors reserve the term "Brittonic" for the modified later Brittonic languages after about AD 600.

The Brittonic languages derive from the <a href="Common%20Brittonic">Common Brittonic</a> language, spoken throughout <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> south of the <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a> during the <a href="British%20Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> and <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman period</a>. In addition, North of the Forth, the <a href="Pictish%20language">Pictish language</a> is considered to be related; it is possible it was a Brittonic language, but it may have been a sister language. In the 5th and 6th centuries emigrating Britons also took Brittonic speech to the continent, most significantly in <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> and <a href="Britonia">Britonia</a>. During the next few centuries the language began to split into several dialects, eventually evolving into <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a>, <a href="Cornish%20language">Cornish</a>, <a href="Breton%20language">Breton</a>, and <a href="Cumbric%20language">Cumbric</a>. Welsh and Breton continue to be spoken as native languages, while a revival in Cornish has led to an increase in speakers of that language. Cumbric is extinct, having been replaced by <a href="Goidelic%20languages">Goidelic</a> and <a href="English%20language">English</a> speech. The <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> and <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> may also have originally spoken a Brittonic language, later replaced with a Goidelic one. Due to emigration, there are also communities of Brittonic language speakers in <a href="England">England</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, and <a href="Y%20Wladfa">Y Wladfa</a> (the Welsh settlement in <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a>).

The names "Brittonic" and "Brythonic" are scholarly conventions referring to the <a href="Celtic%20languages">Celtic languages</a> of Britain and to the ancestral language they originated from, designated <a href="Common%20Brittonic">Common Brittonic</a>, in contrast to the <a href="Goidelic%20languages">Goidelic languages</a> originating in Ireland. Both were created in the 19th century to avoid the ambiguity of earlier terms such as "British" and "Cymric". "Brythonic" was coined in 1879 by the Celticist <a href="John%20Rhys">John Rhys</a> from the Welsh word "". "Brittonic", derived from "<a href="Britons%20%28Celtic%20people%29">Briton</a>" and also earlier spelled "Britonic" and "Britonnic", emerged later in the 19th century. It became more prominent through the 20th century, and was used in <a href="Kenneth%20H.%20Jackson">Kenneth H. Jackson</a>'s highly influential 1953 work on the topic, "Language and History in Early Britain". Jackson noted that by that time "Brythonic" had become a dated term, and that "of late there has been an increasing tendency to use Brittonic instead." Today, "Brittonic" often replaces "Brythonic" in the literature. <a href="Rudolf%20Thurneysen">Rudolf Thurneysen</a> used "Britannic" in his influential "A Grammar of Old Irish", though this never became popular among subsequent scholars.

Comparable historical terms include the <a href="Medieval%20Latin">Medieval Latin</a> ' and ' and the <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a> "". Some writers use "British" for the language and its descendants, though due to the risk of confusion, others avoid it or use it only in a restricted sense. Jackson, and later <a href="John%20T.%20Koch">John T. Koch</a>, use "British" only for the early phase of the Common Brittonic language.

Prior to Jackson's work, "Brittonic" (and "Brythonic") were often used for all the <a href="P-Celtic%20and%20Q-Celtic%20languages">P-Celtic languages</a>, including not just the varieties in Britain but those <a href="Continental%20Celtic%20languages">Continental Celtic languages</a> that similarly experienced the evolution of the <a href="Proto-Celtic%20language">Proto-Celtic language</a> element to . However, subsequent writers have tended to follow Jackson's scheme, rendering this use obsolete.

Knowledge of the Brittonic languages comes from a variety of sources. For the early languages information is obtained from coins, inscriptions and comments by classical writers as well as place names and personal names recorded by them. For later languages there is information from medieval writers and modern native speakers, together with place names. The names recorded in the Roman period are given in Rivet and Smith.

The Brittonic branch is also referred to as P-Celtic because <a href="linguistic%20reconstruction">linguistic reconstruction</a> of the Brittonic reflex of the Proto-Indo-European phoneme *"kʷ" is "p" as opposed to Goidelic "c". Such nomenclature usually implies an acceptance of the P-Celtic and Q-Celtic hypothesis rather than the Insular Celtic hypothesis because the term includes certain Continental Celtic languages as well. (For a discussion, see <a href="Celtic%20languages">Celtic languages</a>.)

Other major characteristics include:
Initial "s-":
Lenition:
Voiceless spirants:
Nasal assimilation:

The family tree of the Brittonic languages is as follows:


Brittonic languages in use today are <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a>, <a href="Cornish%20language">Cornish</a> and <a href="Breton%20language">Breton</a>. Welsh and Breton have been spoken continuously since they formed. For all practical purposes Cornish died out during the 18th or 19th centuries, but a revival movement has more recently created small numbers of new speakers. Also notable are the extinct language <a href="Cumbric%20language">Cumbric</a>, and possibly the extinct <a href="Pictish%20language">Pictish</a> although this may be best considered to be a sister of the Brittonic languages. The late <a href="Kenneth%20H.%20Jackson">Kenneth H. Jackson</a> argued during the 1950s, from some of the few remaining examples of stone inscriptions, that the Picts may have also used a non-<a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a> language, but some modern scholars of Pictish do not agree.

The modern Brittonic languages are generally considered to all derive from a common ancestral language termed "Brittonic", "British", "Common Brittonic", "Old Brittonic" or "Proto-Brittonic", which is thought to have developed from Proto-Celtic or early Insular Celtic by the 6th century BC.

Brittonic languages were probably spoken prior to the Roman invasion at least in the majority of <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> south of the rivers <a href="River%20Forth">Forth</a> and <a href="River%20Clyde">Clyde</a>, though the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> later had a Goidelic language, <a href="Manx%20language">Manx</a>. Northern Scotland mainly spoke <a href="Common%20Brittonic%23Pritenic">Pritennic</a>, which became the <a href="Pictish%20language">Pictish language</a>, which may have been a Brittonic language like that of its neighbors. The theory has been advanced (notably by <a href="O%27Rahilly%27s%20historical%20model">T. F. O'Rahilly</a>) that part of <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> spoke a Brittonic language, usually termed "Ivernic", before it was displaced by <a href="Primitive%20Irish">Primitive Irish</a>, although the authors Dillon and Chadwick reject this theory as being implausible.

During the period of the Roman occupation of what are now <a href="England">England</a> and <a href="Wales">Wales</a> (AD 43 to c. 410), Common Brittonic borrowed a large stock of <a href="Latin">Latin</a> words, both for concepts unfamiliar in the pre-urban society of Celtic Britain such as urbanisation and new tactics of warfare as well as for rather more mundane words which displaced native terms (most notably, the word for "fish" in all the Brittonic languages derives from the Latin "piscis" rather than the native *"ēskos" - which may survive, however, in the Welsh name of the <a href="River%20Usk">River Usk</a>, ). Approximately 800 of these Latin loan-words have survived in the three modern Brittonic languages.

It is probable that at the start of the Post-Roman period "Common Brittonic" was differentiated into at least two major dialect groups – Southwestern and Western (in addition we may posit additional dialects, such as Eastern Brittonic, spoken in what is now the <a href="East%20of%20England">East of England</a>, which have left little or no evidence). Between the end of the Roman occupation and the mid 6th century the two dialects began to diverge into recognisably separate languages, the Western into Cumbric and Welsh and the Southwestern into Cornish and its closely related sister language Breton, which was carried to continental <a href="Armorica">Armorica</a>. Jackson showed that a few of the dialect distinctions between West and Southwest Brittonic go back a long way. New divergencies began around AD 500 but other changes which were shared occurred in the 6th century. Other common changes occurred in the 7th century onward and are possibly due to inherent tendencies. Thus the concept of a common Brittonic language ends by AD 600. Substantial numbers of Britons certainly remained in the expanding area controlled by <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a>, but over the fifth and sixth centuries they mostly adopted the <a href="English%20language">English language</a>.

The Brittonic languages spoken in what is now <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> and what is now <a href="England">England</a> began to be displaced in the 5th century through the settlement of Irish-speaking <a href="Gaels">Gaels</a> and <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic peoples</a>. The <a href="Celtic%20language-death%20in%20England">displacement of the languages of Brittonic descent</a> was probably complete in all of Britain except <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> and <a href="Wales">Wales</a> and the English counties bordering these areas such as <a href="Devon">Devon</a> by the 11th century. Western Herefordshire continued to speak Welsh until the late nineteenth century, and isolated pockets of Shropshire speak Welsh today.

The regular <a href="consonant">consonant</a>al <a href="sound%20change">sound change</a>s from Proto-Celtic to Welsh, Cornish and Breton are summarised in the following table. Where the graphemes have a different value from the corresponding IPA symbols, the IPA equivalent is indicated between slashes. V represents a vowel; C represents a consonant.

The principal legacy left behind in those territories from which the Brittonic languages were displaced is that of <a href="toponymy">toponyms</a> (place names) and <a href="hydronym">hydronym</a>s (river names). There are many Brittonic place names in lowland Scotland and in the parts of England where it is agreed that substantial Brittonic speakers remained (Brittonic names, apart from those of the former Romano-British towns, are scarce over most of England). Names derived (sometimes indirectly) from Brittonic include <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="Penicuik">Penicuik</a>, <a href="Perth%2C%20Scotland">Perth</a>, <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, <a href="York">York</a>, <a href="Dorchester%2C%20Dorset">Dorchester</a>, <a href="Dover">Dover</a> and <a href="Colchester">Colchester</a>. Brittonic elements found in England include "bre-" and "bal-" for hills, while some such as combe or <a href="cwm%20%28landform%29">coomb(e)</a> for a small deep valley and <a href="tor%20%28rock%20formation%29">tor</a> for a hill are examples of Brittonic words that were borrowed into English. Others reflect the presence of Britons such as <a href="Dumbarton">Dumbarton</a> – from the <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a> "Dùn Breatainn" meaning "Fort of the Britons", or Walton meaning a "tun" or settlement where the "<a href="walhaz">Wealh</a>" "Britons" still lived.

The number of Celtic river names in England generally increases from east to west, a map showing these being given by Jackson. These names include ones such as Avon, Chew, Frome, Axe, Brue and Exe, but also river names containing the elements "der-/dar-/dur-" and "-went" e.g. "Derwent, Darwen, Deer, Adur, Dour, Darent, Went". In fact these names exhibit multiple different Celtic roots. One is *dubri- "water" [Bret. "dour", C. "dowr", W. "dŵr"], also found in the place-name "Dover" (attested in the Roman period as "Dubrīs"); this is the original source of rivers named "Dour". Another is *deru̯o- "oak" or "true" [Bret. "derv", C. "derow", W. "derw"), coupled with two agent suffixes, *-ent- and *-iū; this is the origin of "Derwent", " Darent" and "Darwen" (attested in the Roman period as "Deru̯entiō"). The final root to be examined is "went". In Roman Britain there were three tribal capitals named "U̯entā" (modern Winchester, Caerwent and Caistor St Edmunds), whose meaning was 'place, town'.

Some, including <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a> have argued that Celtic has acted as a substrate to English for both the lexicon and syntax. It is generally accepted that linguistic effects on English were lexically rather poor aside from toponyms, consisting of a few domestic words, which may include hubbub, dad, <a href="peat">peat</a>, <a href="bucket">bucket</a>, crock, crumpet (cf. Br. "krampouz"), noggin, gob (cf. Gaelic "gob"), nook; and the dialectal term for a <a href="badger">badger</a>, i.e. "brock" (cf. Welsh "broch", C. "brogh" and Gaelic "broc"). Another legacy may be the sheep-counting system <a href="Yan%20tan%20tethera">Yan Tan Tethera</a> in the west, in the traditionally Celtic areas of England such as <a href="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>. Several Cornish mining words are still in use in English language mining terminology, such as <a href="costean">costean</a>, <a href="gunnies">gunnies</a>, and <a href="vug">vug</a>.

Those who argue against the theory of a Brittonic substratum and heavy influence point out that many toponyms have no semantic continuation from the Brittonic language. A notable example is "Avon" which comes from the Celtic term for river "abona" or the Welsh term for river "afon" but was used by the English as a personal name. Likewise the <a href="River%20Ouse%2C%20Yorkshire">River Ouse, Yorkshire</a> contains the word "usa" which merely means water and the name of the river Trent simply comes from the Welsh word for a trepasser ("an over-flowing river")
It has been argued that the use of <a href="periphrastic">periphrastic</a> constructions (using <a href="auxiliary%20verb">auxiliary verb</a>s like "do" and "be" in the continuous/progressive) in the English <a href="verb">verb</a>, which is more widespread than in the other <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic languages</a>, is traceable to Brittonic influence. Some however find this very unlikely and claim a native English development rather than Celtic influence, though Roberts postulates Northern Germanic influence, despite such constructions not existing in Norse. Literary Welsh has the simple present "Caraf" = "I love" and the present stative (al. continuous/progressive) "Yr wyf yn caru" = "I am loving", where the Brittonic syntax is partly mirrored in English (Note that "I am loving" comes from older "I am a-loving", from still older "ich am on luvende" "I am in the process of loving"). In the Germanic sister languages of English there is only one form, for example "ich liebe" in German, though in "colloquial" German, a progressive aspect form has evolved which is formally similar to those found in Celtic languages, and somewhat less similar to the Modern English form, e.g. "I am working" is "ich bin am Arbeiten", literally: "I am on the working". The same structure is also found in modern Dutch ("ik ben aan het werk"), alongside other structures (e.g. "ik zit te werken", lit. "I work sitting"). These parallel developments suggest that the English progressive is not necessarily due to Celtic influence; moreover, the native English development of the structure can be traced over the over 1000 years of English literature.

Some researchers (Filppula "et al.", 2001) argue that English syntax reflects more extensive Brittonic influences. For instance, in English <a href="tag%20question">tag question</a>s, the form of the tag depends on the verb form in the main statement ("aren't I?", "isn't he?", "won't we?" etc.). The German "nicht wahr?" and the French "n'est-ce pas?", by contrast, are fixed forms which can be used with almost any main statement. It has been claimed that the English system has been borrowed from Brittonic, since Welsh tag questions vary in almost exactly the same way.

Far more notable, but less well known, are Brittonic influences on <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a>, though Scottish and Irish Gaelic, with their wider range of preposition-based periphastic constructions, suggest that such constructions descend from their common Celtic heritage. Scottish Gaelic contains a number of apparently P-Celtic loanwords, but as there is a far greater overlap in terms of Celtic vocabulary, than with English, it is not always possible to disentangle P- and Q-Celtic words. However some common words such as "monadh" = Welsh "mynydd" Cumbric "*monidh" are particularly evident.

Often the Brittonic influence on Scots Gaelic is indicated by considering <a href="Irish%20language">Irish language</a> usage, which is not likely to have been influenced so much by Brittonic. In particular, the word "srath" (<a href="Anglicisation">Anglicise</a>d as "Strath") is a native Goidelic word, but its usage appears to have been modified by the Brittonic cognate "ystrad" whose meaning is slightly different. The effect on Irish has been the loan from British of many Latin-derived words. This has been associated with the Christianisation of Ireland from Britain.

Bronski Beat

Bronski Beat were a popular British <a href="synthpop">synthpop</a> <a href="Trio%20%28music%29">trio</a> who achieved success in the mid-1980s, particularly with the 1984 chart hit "<a href="Smalltown%20Boy">Smalltown Boy</a>". All members of the group were <a href="Coming%20out">openly gay</a> and their songs reflected this, often containing political commentary on <a href="gay">gay</a>-related issues. The initial line-up, which recorded the majority of the band's hits, consisted of <a href="Jimmy%20Somerville">Jimmy Somerville</a> (vocals), Steve Bronski (keyboards, percussion) and Larry Steinbachek (keyboards, percussion). Somerville left Bronski Beat in 1985, and went on to have success as lead singer of <a href="The%20Communards">The Communards</a> and as a solo artist. He was replaced by new vocalist John Foster, with whom the band continued to have hits in the UK and Europe through 1986. Foster left Bronski Beat after their second album, and the band used a series of vocalists before dissolving in 1996.

Steve Bronski, the only original member, now leads a revived touring version of the band, and is recording new material for release in 2017 alongside '90s member Ian Donaldson.

Bronski Beat formed in 1983 when Somerville, Bronski (both from Glasgow), and Steinbachek (from Southend) shared a three-bedroom flat at Lancaster House in <a href="Brixton">Brixton</a>. Steinbachek had heard Somerville singing during the making of "" and suggested they make some music. They first performed publicly at an arts festival "September in the Pink". The trio were unhappy with the inoffensive nature of contemporary gay performers and sought to be more outspoken and political.

Bronski Beat signed a <a href="recording%20contract">recording contract</a> with <a href="London%20Records">London Records</a> in 1984 after doing only nine live <a href="concert">gigs</a>. The band's debut single, "<a href="Smalltown%20Boy">Smalltown Boy</a>" (about a gay teenager leaving his family and fleeing his hometown) was a hit, peaking at No 3 in the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>, and topping charts in Belgium and the Netherlands. The single was accompanied by a promotional <a href="music%20video">video</a> directed by <a href="Bernard%20Rose%20%28director%29">Bernard Rose</a>, showing Somerville trying to befriend an attractive diver at a swimming pool, then being attacked by the diver's homophobic associates, being returned to his family by the police and having to leave home. (The police officer was played by Colin Bell, then the marketing manager of <a href="London%20Records">London Records</a>). "Smalltown Boy" reached #48 in the U.S. <a href="record%20chart">chart</a> and peaked at #7 in Australia. 

The follow-up single, "<a href="Why%3F%20%28Bronski%20Beat%20song%29">Why?</a>", adopted a Hi-NRG sound and was more lyrically focused on anti-gay <a href="prejudice">prejudice</a>. It also achieved <a href="Top%2040">Top 10</a> status in the UK, reaching #6, and was another Top 10 hit for the band in Australia, Switzerland, Germany, France and the Netherlands.

At the end of 1984, the trio released an album titled "<a href="The%20Age%20of%20Consent">The Age of Consent</a>". The inner sleeve listed the varying <a href="age%20of%20consent">ages of consent</a> for consensual gay sex in different nations around the world. At the time, the age of consent for sexual acts between men in the UK was 21 compared with 16 for heterosexual acts, with several other countries having more liberal laws on gay sex. The album peaked at #4 in the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>, #36 in the U.S., and #12 in Australia.

Around the same time, the band headlined "Pits and Perverts", a concert at the <a href="Electric%20Ballroom">Electric Ballroom</a> in London to raise funds for the <a href="Lesbians%20and%20Gays%20Support%20the%20Miners">Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners</a> campaign. This event is featured in the film "<a href="Pride%20%282014%20film%29">Pride</a>".

The third single, released before Christmas 1984, was a revival of "<a href="It%20Ain%27t%20Necessarily%20So">It Ain't Necessarily So</a>", the <a href="George%20Gershwin">George</a> and <a href="Ira%20Gershwin">Ira Gershwin</a> classic (from "<a href="Porgy%20and%20Bess">Porgy and Bess</a>"). The song questions the authenticity of biblical tales. It also reached the UK Top 20.

In 1985, the trio joined up with <a href="Marc%20Almond">Marc Almond</a> to record a version of <a href="Donna%20Summer">Donna Summer</a>'s "<a href="I%20Feel%20Love">I Feel Love</a>". The full version was actually a <a href="Medley%20%28music%29">medley</a> that also incorporated snippets of Summer's "<a href="Love%20to%20Love%20You%20Baby%20%28song%29">Love to Love You Baby</a>" and <a href="John%20Leyton">John Leyton</a>'s "<a href="Johnny%20Remember%20Me">Johnny Remember Me</a>". It was a big success, reaching #3 in the UK and equalling the chart achievement of "Smalltown Boy". Although the original had been one of Marc Almond’s all-time favourite songs, he had never read the lyrics and thus incorrectly sang "What’ll it be, what’ll it be, you and me" instead of "Falling free, falling free, falling free" on the finished record.

The band and their producer Mike Thorne had gone back into the studio in early 1985 to record a new single, "Run From Love", and PolyGram (London Records' parent company at that time) had pressed a number of promo singles and 12" versions of the song and sent them to radio and record stores in the UK. However, the single was shelved as tensions in the band, both personal and political, resulted in Somerville leaving Bronski Beat in the summer of that year.

"Run From Love" was subsequently released in a <a href="remix">remix</a> form on the Bronski Beat album "<a href="Hundreds%20%26amp%3B%20Thousands%20%28album%29">Hundreds & Thousands</a>", a collection of mostly remixes (LP) and <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">B-sides</a> (as bonus tracks on the CD version) as well as the hit "I Feel Love". Somerville went on to form <a href="Communards%20%28band%29">The Communards</a> with <a href="Richard%20Coles">Richard Coles</a> while the remaining members of Bronski Beat searched for a new vocalist.

Bronski Beat recruited John Foster as Somerville's replacement (Foster is credited as "Jon Jon"). A single, "<a href="Hit%20That%20Perfect%20Beat">Hit That Perfect Beat</a>", was released in November 1985, reaching #3 in the UK. It repeated this success on the Australian chart and was also featured in the film "<a href="Letter%20to%20Brezhnev">Letter to Brezhnev</a>". A second single, "C'mon C'mon", also charted in the UK Top 20 and an album, "<a href="Truthdare%20Doubledare">Truthdare Doubledare</a>", released in May 1986, peaked at #18. The film "<a href="Parting%20Glances">Parting Glances</a>" (1986) included Bronski Beat songs "Love and Money", "Smalltown Boy" and "Why?". During this period, the band teamed up with producer Mark Cunningham on the first-ever <a href="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="Children%20In%20Need">Children In Need</a> single, a cover of David Bowie's "<a href="Heroes%20%28David%20Bowie%20song%29">Heroes</a>", released in 1986 under the name of The County Line.

Foster left the band in 1987. Following Foster's departure, Bronski Beat began work on their next album, "Out and About". The tracks were recorded at Berry Street studios in London with engineer Brian Pugsley. Some of the song titles were "The Final Spin" and "Peace And Love". The latter track featured <a href="Strawberry%20Switchblade">Strawberry Switchblade</a> vocalist <a href="Rose%20McDowall">Rose McDowall</a> and appeared on several internet sites in 2006. One of the other songs from the project called "European Boy" was recorded in 1987 by disco group Splash. The lead singer of Splash was former <a href="Tight%20Fit">Tight Fit</a> singer Steve Grant. Steinbachek and Bronski toured extensively with the new material and got great reviews, however the project was abandoned as the group were dropped by London Records. Also in 1987, Bronski Beat and Somerville performed at a reunion concert for "International AIDS Day", supported by <a href="New%20Order%20%28band%29">New Order</a>, at the <a href="Brixton%20Academy">Brixton Academy</a>, London.

In 1989, Jonathan Hellyer became lead singer, and the band extensively toured the U.S. and Europe with back-up vocalist Annie Conway. They achieved one minor hit with the song "Cha Cha Heels", a one-off collaboration sung by American actress and singer <a href="Eartha%20Kitt">Eartha Kitt</a>, which peaked at #32 in the UK. The song was originally written for movie and recording star <a href="Divine%20%28actor%29">Divine</a>, who was unable to record the song before his death in 1988. 1990–91 saw Bronski Beat release three further singles on the Zomba record label, "I'm Gonna Run Away", "One More Chance" and "What More Can I Say". The singles were produced by <a href="Mike%20Thorne">Mike Thorne</a>.

Foster and Bronski Beat teamed up again in 1994, and released a <a href="techno">techno</a> "Tell Me Why '94" and an <a href="acoustic%20music">acoustic</a> "Smalltown Boy '94" on the German <a href="record%20label">record label</a>, <a href="ZYX%20Music">ZYX Music</a>. The album "Rainbow Nation" was released the following year with Hellyer returning as lead vocalist, as Foster had dropped out of the project and Ian Donaldson was brought onboard to do keyboards and programming. After a few years of touring the world Bronski Beat then dissolved, with Steve Bronski going on to become a producer for other artists and Ian Donaldson becoming a successful DJ (Sordid Soundz). Larry Steinbachek became the musical director for <a href="Michael%20Laub">Michael Laub</a>'s theatre company, 'Remote Control Productions'.

In 2007, Bronski remixed the song "Stranger to None" by the UK <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band, <a href="All%20Living%20Fear">All Living Fear</a>. Four different mixes were done, with one appearing on their retrospective album, "Fifteen Years After". Bronski also remixed the track "Flowers in the Morning" by Northern Irish <a href="electronic%20music">electronic</a> band Electrobronze in 2007, changing the style of the song from <a href="Classical%20music">classical</a> to <a href="Hi-NRG">Hi-NRG</a> disco.

In 2016, Steve Bronski teamed up once again with Ian Donaldson to bring Bronski Beat back and enlisted a new singer, Stephen Granville. They are currently reworking the old songs as well as new material, to be released in 2017.

On 12 January 2017, Larry Steinbachek's sister Louise Jones told BBC News he had died the previous month after a short battle with cancer, with his family and friends at his bedside.

The original member set of Bronski Beat was <a href="Jimmy%20Somerville">Jimmy Somerville</a> (vocals), Steve Bronski and Larry Steinbachek (keyboards). Following Somerville leaving to form pop group <a href="The%20Communards">The Communards</a> with Richard Coles, he was replaced by John Foster and later by Jonathan Hellyer. The band set-up has seen a number of changes.

Binary prefix

A binary prefix is a <a href="unit%20prefix">unit prefix</a> for multiples of <a href="Units%20of%20measurement">unit</a>s in data processing, data transmission, and digital information, notably the <a href="bit">bit</a> and the <a href="byte">byte</a>, to indicate multiplication by a <a href="Exponentiation">power</a> of 2.

The computer industry has historically used the units "kilobyte", "megabyte", and "gigabyte", and the corresponding symbols KB, MB, and GB, in at least two slightly different measurement systems. In citations of main memory (<a href="Random%20access%20memory">RAM</a>) capacity, "gigabyte" customarily means bytes. As this is a power of 1024, and 1024 is a <a href="power%20of%20two">power of two</a> (2), this usage is referred to as a binary measurement.

In most other contexts, the industry uses the multipliers "kilo", "mega", "giga", etc., in a manner consistent with their meaning in the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Units</a> (SI), namely as powers of 1000. For example, a 500 gigabyte hard disk holds bytes, and a 1 Gbit/s (gigabit-per-second) <a href="Ethernet">Ethernet</a> connection transfers data at bit/s. In contrast with the "binary prefix" usage, this use is described as a "decimal prefix", as 1000 is a <a href="Powers%20of%2010">power of 10</a> (10).

The use of the same unit prefixes with two different meanings has caused confusion. Starting around 1998, the <a href="International%20Electrotechnical%20Commission">International Electrotechnical Commission</a> (IEC) and several other standards and trade organizations addressed the ambiguity by publishing standards and recommendations for a set of binary prefixes that refer exclusively to powers of 1024. Accordingly, the US <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) requires that <a href="SI%20prefix">SI prefix</a>es only be used in the decimal sense: <a href="kilobyte">kilobyte</a> and <a href="megabyte">megabyte</a> denote one thousand bytes and one million bytes respectively (consistent with SI), while new terms such as <a href="kibibyte">kibibyte</a>, <a href="mebibyte">mebibyte</a> and <a href="gibibyte">gibibyte</a>, having the symbols KiB, MiB, and GiB, denote 1024 bytes, bytes, and bytes, respectively. In 2008, the IEC prefixes were incorporated into the <a href="ISO/IEC%2080000%23Information%20science%20and%20technology">ISO/IEC 80000</a> standard.

Early computers used one of two addressing methods to access the system memory; binary (base 2) or decimal (base 10).
For example, the <a href="IBM%20701">IBM 701</a> (1952) used binary and could address 2048 <a href="Word%20%28data%20type%29">words</a> of 36 <a href="bit">bit</a>s each, while the <a href="IBM%20702">IBM 702</a> (1953) used decimal and could address ten thousand 7-bit words.

By the mid-1960s, binary addressing had become the standard architecture in most computer designs, and main memory sizes were most commonly powers of two. This is the most natural configuration for memory, as all combinations of their address lines map to a valid address, allowing easy aggregation into a larger block of memory with contiguous addresses.

Early computer system documentation would specify the memory size with an exact number such as 4096, 8192, or 16384 words of storage. These are all <a href="Power%20of%20two">powers of two</a>, and furthermore are small multiples of 2, or 1024. As storage capacities increased, several different methods were developed to abbreviate these quantities.

The method most commonly used today uses prefixes such as kilo, mega, giga, and corresponding symbols K, M, and G, which the computer industry originally adopted from the <a href="metric%20system">metric system</a>. The prefixes "kilo-" and "mega-", meaning 1000 and respectively, were commonly used in the electronics industry before World War II. 
Along with "giga-" or G-, meaning , they are now known as <a href="SI%20prefixes">SI prefixes</a> after the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Units</a> (SI), introduced in 1960 to formalize aspects of the metric system. 

The International System of Units does not define units for digital information but notes that the SI prefixes may be applied outside the contexts where base units or derived units would be used. But as computer main memory in a 
binary-addressed system is manufactured in sizes that were easily expressed as multiples of 1024, "kilobyte", when applied to computer memory, came to be used to mean 1024 bytes instead of 1000. This usage is not consistent with the SI. Compliance with the SI requires that the prefixes take their 1000-based meaning, and that they are not to be used as placeholders for other numbers, like 1024.

The use of K in the binary sense as in a "32K core" meaning words, i.e., words, can be found as early as 1959.
<a href="Gene%20Amdahl">Gene Amdahl</a>'s seminal 1964 article on <a href="IBM%20System/360">IBM System/360</a> used "1K" to mean 1024.
This style was used by other computer vendors, the <a href="CDC%207600">CDC 7600</a> "System Description" (1968) made extensive use of K as 1024.
Thus the first binary prefix was born.

Another style was to truncate the last three digits and append K, essentially using K as a decimal prefix similar to <a href="SI%20prefixes">SI</a>, but always truncating to the next lower whole number instead of rounding to the nearest. The exact values words, words and words would then be described as "32K", "65K" and "131K".
This style was used from about 1965 to 1975.

These two styles (K = 1024 and truncation) were used loosely around the same time, sometimes by the same company. In discussions of binary-addressed memories, the exact size was evident from context. (For memory sizes of "41K" and below, there is no difference between the two styles.) The <a href="HP%202100">HP 21MX</a> real-time computer (1974) denoted (which is 192×1024) as "196K" and as "1M",
while the <a href="HP%203000">HP 3000</a> business computer (1973) could have "64K", "96K", or "128K" bytes of memory.

The "truncation" method gradually waned. Capitalization of the letter K became the "de facto" standard for binary notation, although this could not be extended to higher powers, and use of the lowercase k did persist. Nevertheless, the practice of using the SI-inspired "kilo" to indicate 1024 was later extended to "megabyte" meaning 1024 () bytes, and later "gigabyte" for 1024 () bytes. For example, a "512 megabyte" RAM module is 512×1024 bytes (512 × , or ), rather than .

The symbols Kbit, Kbyte, Mbit and Mbyte started to be used as "binary units"—"bit" or "byte" with a multiplier that is a power of 1024—in the early 1970s.
For a time, memory capacities were often expressed in K, even when M could have been used: The IBM System/370 Model 158 brochure (1972) had the following: "Real storage capacity is available in 512K increments ranging from 512K to 2,048K bytes."

Megabyte was used to describe the 22-bit addressing of DEC <a href="PDP-11">PDP-11</a>/70 (1975)
and gigabyte the 30-bit addressing DEC <a href="VAX-11/780">VAX-11/780</a> (1977).

In 1998, the <a href="International%20Electrotechnical%20Commission">International Electrotechnical Commission</a> IEC introduced the binary prefixes kibi, mebi, gibi ... to mean 1024, 1024, 1024 etc., so that 1048576 bytes could be referred to unambiguously as 1 <a href="mebibyte">mebibyte</a>. The IEC prefixes were defined for use alongside the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Quantities">International System of Quantities</a> (ISQ) in <a href="ISO%2080000-1">2009</a>.

The disk drive industry followed a different pattern. Industry practice, more thoroughly documented at <a href="Timeline%20of%20binary%20prefixes">Timeline of binary prefixes</a> and continuing today, is generally to specify hard drives using prefixes and symbols with decimal meaning as described by SI. Unlike computer main memory, there is nothing in a disk drive that causes, or even influences, the capacity to be an integer multiple of a power of 1024. For example, the first commercially sold disk drive, the <a href="IBM%20350">IBM 350</a>, had 50 (not 32 or 64) physical disk "platters" containing a total of 50,000 sectors of 100 characters each, for a total quoted capacity of "5 million characters." It was introduced in September 1956. 

In the 1960s most disk drives used IBM's variable block length format (called <a href="Count%20Key%20Data">Count Key Data</a> or "CKD").
Any block size could be specified up to the maximum track length. Since the block headers occupied space, the usable capacity of the drive was dependent on the block size. Blocks ("records" in IBM's terminology) of 88, 96, 880 and 960 were often used because they related to the fixed block size of 80- and 96-character punch cards. The drive capacity was usually stated under conditions of full track record blocking. For example, the 100-megabyte 3336 disk pack only achieved that capacity with a full track block size of 13,030 bytes.

<a href="Floppy_disk%233.C2.BD-inch_floppy_disk">Floppy disks</a> for the IBM PC and compatibles quickly <a href="List_of_floppy_disk_formats%23Known_disk_logical_formats">standardized on 512-byte sectors</a>, so two sectors were easily referred to as "1K". The 3.5-inch "360 KB" and "720 KB" had 720 (single-sided) and 1440 sectors (double-sided) respectively. When the High Density "1.44 MB" floppies came along, with 2880 of these 512-byte sectors, that terminology represented a hybrid binary-decimal definition of "1 MB" = 2 x 10 =1 024 000 bytes.

In contrast, <a href="hard%20disk">hard disk</a> drive manufacturers used "megabytes" or "MB", meaning 10 bytes, to characterize their products as early as 1974. By 1977, in its first edition, Disk/Trend, a leading hard disk drive industry marketing consultancy segmented the industry according to MBs (decimal sense) of capacity.

One of the earliest hard disk drives in personal computing history,
the Seagate <a href="ST-412">ST-412</a>, was specified as "Formatted: 10.0 Megabytes". More precisely, the drive contains 4 heads or active surfaces (tracks per cylinder), 306 cylinders, and when formatted with a sector size of 256 bytes and 32 sectors/track results in a capacity of . This drive was one of several types installed into the <a href="IBM%20PC/XT">IBM PC/XT</a> and extensively advertised and reported as a "10 MB" (formatted) hard disk drive.
The factor of 306 cylinders (rather than 256 or 512, both of which are powers of two) in the calculation causes the capacity to be not conveniently close to a power of 1024; operating systems and programs using the customary binary prefixes show this as "9.5625 MB". Many later drives in the personal computer market used 17 sectors per track; still later, <a href="zone%20bit%20recording">zone bit recording</a> was introduced, causing the number of sectors per track to vary from the outer track to the inner. Nor are drives required to have a number of active surfaces that is a power of, or even divisible by, two; drives with e.g. three active surfaces are not uncommon. All of these factors reduce the utility of the customary binary prefixes for expressing drive capacity. 

Today, the hard drive industry continues to use decimal prefixes for drive capacity (as well as for transfer rate). For example, a "300 GB" hard drive offers slightly more than 300×10, or , bytes, not (which would be about ). Operating systems such as <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> that display hard drive sizes using the customary binary prefix "GB" (as it is used for RAM) would display this as "279.4 GB" (meaning bytes, or ). On the other hand, <a href="Mac%20OS%20X">Mac OS X</a> has since version 10.6 shown hard drive size using decimal prefixes (thus matching the drive makers' packaging). (Previous versions of Mac OS used binary prefixes.)

However, other usages still occur. For example, in one document, Seagate specifies data transfer rates of some of its hard drives in "both" IEC and decimal units. 
"Advanced Format" drives using 4096-byte sectors are described as having "4K sectors."

Computer <a href="Clock%20signal">clock</a> frequencies are always quoted using SI prefixes in their decimal sense. For example, the internal clock frequency of the original <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a> was 4.77 MHz, that is .
Similarly, digital information transfer rates are quoted using decimal prefixes:

By the mid-1970s it was common to see K meaning 1024 and the occasional M meaning for words or bytes of main memory (RAM) while K and M were commonly used with their decimal meaning for disk storage. In the 1980s, as capacities of both types of devices increased, the SI prefix G, with SI meaning, was commonly applied to disk storage, while M in its binary meaning, became common for computer memory. In the 1990s, the prefix G, in its binary meaning, became commonly used for computer memory capacity. The first terabyte (SI prefix, bytes) hard disk drive was introduced in 2007.

The dual usage of the kilo (K), mega (M), and giga (G) prefixes as both powers of 1000 and powers of 1024 has been recorded in standards and dictionaries. For example, the 1986 ANSI/IEEE Std 1084-1986
defined dual uses for kilo and mega.

Many dictionaries have noted the practice of using traditional prefixes to indicate binary multiples.
Oxford online dictionary defines, for example, megabyte as: "Computing: a unit of information equal to one million or (strictly) bytes."

The units Kbyte, Mbyte, and Gbyte are found in the trade press and in IEEE journals. Gigabyte was formally defined in IEEE Std 610.10-1994 as either or 2 bytes.
Kilobyte, Kbyte, and KB are equivalent units and all are defined in the obsolete standard, IEEE 100-2000.

The hardware industry measures system memory (RAM) using the binary meaning while magnetic disk storage uses the SI definition. However, many exceptions exist. Labeling of <a href="diskette">diskette</a>s uses the megabyte to denote 1024×1000 bytes. In the optical disks market, <a href="Compact%20Disk">Compact Disk</a>s use "MB" to mean 1024 bytes while <a href="DVD">DVD</a>s use "GB" to mean 1000 bytes.

Computer storage has become cheaper per unit and thereby larger, by many orders of magnitude since "K" was first used to mean 1024. 
Because both the SI and "binary" meanings of kilo, mega, etc., are based on <a href="Exponentiation">powers</a> of 1000 or 1024 rather than simple multiples, the difference between 1M "binary" and 1M "decimal" is proportionally larger than that between 1K "binary" and 1k "decimal," and so on up the scale.
The relative difference between the values in the binary and decimal interpretations increases, when using the SI prefixes as the base, from 2.4% for kilo to nearly 21% for the yotta prefix.

In the early days of computers (roughly, prior to the advent of personal computers) there was little or no <a href="consumer%20confusion">consumer confusion</a> because of the technical sophistication of the buyers and their familiarity with the products. In addition, it was common for computer manufacturers to specify their products with capacities in full precision.

In the personal computing era, one source of consumer confusion is the difference in the way many operating systems display hard drive sizes, compared to the way hard drive manufacturers describe them. <a href="%23Disk%20drives">Hard drives</a> are specified and sold using "GB" and "TB" in their decimal meaning: one billion and one trillion bytes. Many operating systems and other software, however, display hard drive and file sizes using "MB", "GB" or other SI-looking prefixes in their binary sense, just as they do for displays of RAM capacity. For example, many such systems display a hard drive marketed as "160 GB" as "149.05 GB". The earliest known presentation of hard disk drive capacity by an operating system using "KB" or "MB" in a binary sense is 1984; earlier operating systems generally presented the hard disk drive capacity as an exact number of bytes, with no prefix of any sort, for example, in the output of the MS-DOS or PC DOS <a href="CHKDSK">CHKDSK</a> command.

The different interpretations of disk size prefixes has led to three significant class action lawsuits against digital storage manufacturers.
One case involved flash memory and the other two involved hard disk drives.
Two of these were settled with the manufacturers admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to clarify the storage capacity of their products on the consumer packaging.
Flash memory and hard disk manufacturers now have disclaimers on their packaging and web sites clarifying the formatted capacity of the devices
or defining MB as 1 million bytes and 1 GB as 1 billion bytes.

On 20 February 2004, <a href="Willem%20Vroegh%20v.%20Eastman%20Kodak%20Company">Willem Vroegh filed a lawsuit</a> against Lexar Media, Dane–Elec Memory, <a href="Fujifilm">Fuji Photo Film USA</a>, <a href="Eastman%20Kodak">Eastman Kodak</a> Company, Kingston Technology Company, Inc., <a href="Memorex">Memorex</a> Products, Inc.; <a href="PNY%20Technologies">PNY Technologies</a> Inc., <a href="SanDisk">SanDisk Corporation</a>, <a href="Verbatim%20Corporation">Verbatim Corporation</a>, and <a href="Viking%20Interworks">Viking Interworks</a> alleging that their descriptions of the capacity of their <a href="flash%20memory">flash memory</a> cards were false and misleading.

Vroegh claimed that a 256 MB Flash Memory Device had only 244 MB of accessible memory. "Plaintiffs allege that Defendants marketed the memory capacity of their products by assuming that one megabyte equals one million bytes and one gigabyte equals one billion bytes."
The plaintiffs wanted the defendants to use the traditional values of 1024 for megabyte and 1024 for gigabyte.
The plaintiffs acknowledged that the IEC and IEEE standards define a MB as one million bytes but stated that the industry has largely ignored the IEC standards.

The manufacturers agreed to clarify the flash memory card capacity on the packaging and web sites. The consumers could apply for "a discount of ten percent off a future online purchase from Defendants' Online Stores Flash Memory Device".

On 7 July 2005, an action entitled "Orin Safier v. <a href="Western%20Digital">Western Digital</a> Corporation, et al." was filed in the Superior Court for the City and County of San Francisco, Case No. CGC-05-442812.
The case was subsequently moved to the Northern District of California, Case No. 05-03353 BZ.

Although Western Digital maintained that their usage of units is consistent with "the indisputably correct industry standard for measuring and describing storage capacity", and that they "cannot be expected to reform the software industry", they agreed to settle in March 2006 with 14 June 2006 as the Final Approval hearing date.

Western Digital offered to compensate customers with a free download of backup and recovery software valued at US$30. They also paid $500,000 in fees and expenses to San Francisco lawyers Adam Gutride and Seth Safier, who filed the suit.
The settlement called for Western Digital to add a disclaimer to their later packaging and advertising.

A lawsuit (Cho v. Seagate Technology (US) Holdings, Inc., San Francisco Superior Court, Case No. CGC-06-453195) was filed against <a href="Seagate%20Technology">Seagate Technology</a>, alleging that Seagate overrepresented the amount of usable storage by 7% on hard drives sold between March 22, 2001 and September 26, 2007. The case was settled without Seagate admitting wrongdoing, but agreeing to supply those purchasers with free backup software or a 5% refund on the cost of the drives.

While early computer scientists typically used k to mean 1000, some recognized the convenience that would result from working with multiples of 1024 and the confusion that resulted from using the same prefixes for two different meanings.

Several proposals for unique binary prefixes were made in 1968. Donald Morrison proposed to use the Greek letter kappa (<a href="%CE%BA">κ</a>) to denote 1024, κ to denote 1024, and so on.
<a href="Wallace%20Givens">Wallace Givens</a> responded with a proposal to use bK as an abbreviation for 1024 and bK2 or bK for 1024, though he noted that neither the Greek letter nor lowercase letter b would be easy to reproduce on computer printers of the day.
<a href="Bruce%20Alan%20Martin">Bruce Alan Martin</a> of <a href="Brookhaven%20National%20Laboratory">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a> further proposed that the prefixes be abandoned altogether, and the letter <a href="binary%20scientific%20notation">B</a> be used for base-2 exponents, similar to <a href="E%20notation">E</a> in <a href="decimal%20scientific%20notation">decimal scientific notation</a>, to create shorthands like 3B20 for 3×2, a convention still used on some calculators to present binary floating point-numbers today.

None of these gained much acceptance, and capitalization of the letter K became the "de facto" standard for indicating a factor of 1024 instead of 1000, although this could not be extended to higher powers.

As the discrepancy between the two systems increased in the higher-order powers, more proposals for unique prefixes were made.
In 1996, <a href="Markus%20Kuhn%20%28computer%20scientist%29">Markus Kuhn</a> proposed a system with "di" prefixes, like the "dikilobyte" (K₂B or K2B). <a href="Donald%20Knuth">Donald Knuth</a>, who uses decimal notation like 1 MB = 1000 kB, expressed "astonishment" that the IEC proposal was adopted, calling them "funny-sounding" and opining that proponents were assuming "that standards are automatically adopted just because they are there." Knuth proposed that the powers of 1024 be designated as "large kilobytes" and "large megabytes" (abbreviated KKB and MMB, as "doubling the letter connotes both binary-ness and large-ness"). <a href="Metric%20prefix%23Double%20prefixes">Double prefixes</a> were already abolished from SI, however, having a multiplicative meaning ("MMB" would be equivalent to "TB"), and this proposed usage never gained any traction.

The set of binary prefixes that were eventually adopted, now referred to as the "IEC prefixes", were first proposed by the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry</a>'s (IUPAC) Interdivisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (IDCNS) in 1995. At that time, it was proposed that the terms kilobyte and megabyte be used only for 10 bytes and 10 bytes, respectively. The new prefixes "kibi" (kilobinary), "mebi" (megabinary), "gibi" (gigabinary) and "tebi" (terabinary) were also proposed at the time, and the proposed symbols for the prefixes were kb, Mb, Gb and Tb respectively, rather than Ki, Mi, Gi and Ti. The proposal was not accepted at the time.

The <a href="Institute%20of%20Electrical%20and%20Electronic%20Engineers">Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers</a> (IEEE) began to collaborate with the <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a> (ISO) and <a href="International%20Electrotechnical%20Commission">International Electrotechnical Commission</a> (IEC) to find acceptable names for binary prefixes. IEC proposed "kibi", "mebi", "gibi" and "tebi", with the symbols Ki, Mi, Gi and Ti respectively, in 1996.

The names for the new prefixes are derived from the original SI prefixes combined with the term "binary", but contracted, by taking the first two letters of the SI prefix and "bi" from binary. The first letter of each such prefix is therefore identical to the corresponding SI prefixes, except for "K", which is used interchangeably with "k", whereas in SI, only the lower-case k represents 1000.

The IEEE decided that their standards would use the prefixes "kilo", etc. with their metric definitions, but allowed the binary definitions to be used in an interim period as long as such usage was explicitly pointed out on a case-by-case basis.

In January 1999, the IEC published the first international standard (<a href="IEC%2060027-2">IEC 60027-2</a> Amendment 2) with the new prefixes, extended up to "pebi" (Pi) and "exbi" (Ei).

The IEC 60027-2 Amendment 2 also states that the IEC position is the same as that of BIPM (the body that regulates the SI system); the SI prefixes retain their definitions in powers of 1000 and are never used to mean a power of 1024.

In usage, products and concepts typically described using powers of 1024 would continue to be, but with the new IEC prefixes. For example, a memory module of bytes () would be referred to as 512 MiB or 512 mebibytes instead of 512 MB or 512 megabytes. Conversely, since hard drives have historically been marketed using the SI convention that "giga" means , a "500 GB" hard drive would still be labeled as such. According to these recommendations, operating systems and other software would also use binary and SI prefixes in the same way, so the purchaser of a "500 GB" hard drive would find the operating system reporting either "500 GB" or "466 GiB", while bytes of RAM would be displayed as "512 MiB".

The second edition of the standard, published in 2000, defined them only up to "exbi", but in 2005, the third edition added prefixes "zebi" and "yobi", thus matching all SI prefixes with binary counterparts.

The harmonized <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization">ISO</a>/<a href="International%20Electrotechnical%20Commission">IEC</a> <a href="IEC%2080000-13">IEC 80000-13:2008</a> standard cancels and replaces subclauses 3.8 and 3.9 of IEC 60027-2:2005 (those defining prefixes for binary multiples). The only significant change is the addition of explicit definitions for some quantities. In 2009, the prefixes kibi-, mebi-, etc. were defined by <a href="ISO%2080000-1">ISO 80000-1</a> in their own right, independently of the kibibyte, mebibyte, and so on.

The BIPM standard JCGM 200:2012 "International vocabulary of metrology – Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM), 3rd edition" lists the IEC binary prefixes and states "SI prefixes refer strictly to powers of 10, and should not be used for powers of 2. For example, 1 kilobit should not be used to represent bits (2 bits), which is 1 kibibit." 

The IEC standard binary prefixes are now supported by other standardization bodies and technical organizations.

The United States <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) supports the ISO/IEC standards for
"Prefixes for binary multiples" and has a <a href="http%3A//physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html">web site</a> documenting them, describing and justifying their use. NIST suggests that in English, the first syllable of the name of the binary-multiple prefix should be pronounced in the same way as the first syllable of the name of the corresponding SI prefix, and that the second syllable should be pronounced as "bee". NIST has stated the SI prefixes "refer strictly to powers of 10" and that the binary definitions "should not be used" for them.

The microelectronics industry standards body <a href="JEDEC">JEDEC</a> describes the IEC prefixes in its online dictionary. The JEDEC standards for semiconductor memory use the customary prefix symbols K, M, G and T in the binary sense.

On 19 March 2005, the IEEE standard <a href="IEEE%201541-2002">IEEE 1541-2002</a> ("Prefixes for Binary Multiples") was elevated to a full-use standard by the IEEE Standards Association after a two-year trial period. However, , the IEEE Publications division does not require the use of IEC prefixes in its major magazines such as "Spectrum" or "Computer". 

The <a href="International%20Bureau%20of%20Weights%20and%20Measures">International Bureau of Weights and Measures</a> (BIPM), which maintains the <a href="International%20System%20of%20Units">International System of Units</a> (SI), expressly prohibits the use of SI prefixes to denote binary multiples, and recommends the use of the IEC prefixes as an alternative since units of information are not included in SI.

The <a href="Society%20of%20Automobile%20Engineers">Society of Automotive Engineers</a> (SAE) prohibits the use of SI prefixes with anything but a power-of-1000 meaning, but does not recommend or otherwise cite the IEC binary prefixes.

The European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (<a href="CENELEC">CENELEC</a>) adopted the IEC-recommended binary prefixes via the harmonization document HD 60027-2:2003-03.
The European Union (EU) has required the use of the IEC binary prefixes since 2007.

Most computer hardware uses <a href="SI%20prefixes">SI prefixes</a> to state capacity and define other performance parameters such as data rate. <a href="Main%20memory">Main</a> and <a href="cache%20memory">cache</a> memories are notable exceptions.

Capacities of <a href="main%20memory">main memory</a> and <a href="cache%20memory">cache memory</a> are usually expressed with customary binary prefixes
On the other hand, <a href="flash%20memory">flash memory</a>, like that found in solid state drives, mostly uses <a href="SI%20prefixes">SI prefixes</a> to state capacity.

Some operating systems and other software continue to use the customary binary prefixes in displays of memory, disk storage capacity, and file size, but SI prefixes in other areas such as network communication speeds and processor speeds.

In the following subsections, unless otherwise noted, examples are first given using the common prefixes used in each case, and then followed by interpretation using other notation where appropriate.

Prior to the release of <a href="Classic%20Mac%20OS">Macintosh System Software</a> (1984), file sizes were typically reported by the operating system without any prefixes. Today, most operating systems report file sizes with prefixes.


, most software does not distinguish symbols for binary and decimal prefixes.
The <a href="International%20Electrotechnical%20Commission">IEC</a> binary naming convention has been adopted by a few, but this is not used universally.

One of the stated goals of the introduction of the IEC prefixes was "to preserve the SI prefixes as unambiguous decimal multipliers." Programs such as <a href="fdisk">fdisk</a>/<a href="cfdisk">cfdisk</a>, <a href="parted">parted</a>, and <a href="apt-get">apt-get</a> use SI prefixes with their decimal meaning.

Example of the use of IEC binary prefixes in the <a href="Linux">Linux</a> operating system displaying traffic volume on a network interface in kibibytes (KiB) and mebibytes (MiB), as obtained with the <a href="ifconfig">ifconfig</a> utility:
Software that uses standard SI prefixes for powers of 1000, but "not" IEC binary prefixes for powers of 1024, includes:


Software that supports decimal prefixes for powers of 1000 "and" binary prefixes for powers of 1024 (but does not follow SI or IEC nomenclature for this) includes:


Software that uses IEC binary prefixes for powers of 1024 "and" uses standard SI prefixes for powers of 1000 includes:



Hardware types that use powers-of-1024 multipliers, such as memory, continue to be marketed with customary binary prefixes.

Measurements of most types of electronic <a href="computer%20memory">memory</a> such as <a href="Random%20Access%20Memory">RAM</a> and <a href="Read-only%20memory">ROM</a> are given using customary binary prefixes (kilo, mega, and giga). This includes some <a href="flash%20memory">flash memory</a>, like <a href="EEPROM">EEPROM</a>s. For example, a "512-megabyte" memory module is 512×2 bytes (512 × , or ).

JEDEC Solid State Technology Association, the semiconductor engineering standardization body of the Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA), continues to include the customary binary definitions of kilo, mega and giga in their "Terms, Definitions, and Letter Symbols" document,
and uses those definitions in later memory standards

Many computer programming tasks reference memory in terms of <a href="Power%20of%20two">powers of two</a> because of the inherent binary design of current hardware addressing systems. For example, a 16-bit processor register can reference at most 65,536 items (bytes, words, or other objects); this is conveniently expressed as "64K" items. An operating system might map memory as 4096-byte <a href="Page%20%28computing%29">pages</a>, in which case exactly 8192 pages could be allocated within bytes of memory: "8K" (8192) pages of "4 kilobytes" (4096 bytes) each within "32 megabytes" (32 MiB) of memory.

All <a href="hard%20disk">hard disk</a> drive manufacturers state capacity using <a href="SI%20prefixes">SI prefixes</a>.

<a href="USB%20flash%20drive">USB flash drive</a>s, flash-based memory cards like <a href="CompactFlash">CompactFlash</a> or <a href="Secure%20Digital">Secure Digital</a>, and flash-based <a href="Solid-state%20drive">SSDs</a> use <a href="SI%20prefixes">SI prefixes</a>;
for example, a "256 MB" flash card provides at least 256 million bytes (), not 256×1024×1024 ().
The flash memory chips inside these devices contain considerably more than the quoted capacities, but much like a traditional hard drive, some space is reserved for internal functions of the flash drive. These include <a href="wear%20leveling">wear leveling</a>, error correction, sparing, and metadata needed by the device's internal firmware.

<a href="Floppy%20disk">Floppy disk</a>s have existed in numerous physical and logical <a href="List%20of%20floppy%20disk%20formats">formats</a>, and have been sized inconsistently. In part, this is because the end user capacity of a particular disk is a function of the controller hardware, so that the same disk could be formatted to a variety of capacities. In many cases, the media are marketed without any indication of the end user capacity, as for example, DSDD, meaning double-sided double-density.

The last widely adopted diskette was the 3½-inch high density. This has a formatted capacity of bytes or 1440 KB (1440 × 1024, using "KB" in the customary binary sense). These are marketed as "HD", or "1.44 MB" or both. This usage creates a third definition of "megabyte" as 1000×1024 bytes.

Most operating systems display the capacity using "MB" in the customary binary sense, resulting in a display of "1.4 MB" (). Some users have noticed the missing 0.04 MB and both Apple and Microsoft have support bulletins referring to them as 1.4 MB.

The earlier "1200 KB" (1200×1024 bytes) 5¼-inch diskette sold with the <a href="PC%20AT">IBM PC AT</a> was marketed as "1.2 MB" (). The largest 8-inch diskette formats could contain more than a megabyte, and the capacities of those devices were often irregularly specified in megabytes, also without controversy.

Older and smaller diskette formats were usually identified as an accurate number of (binary) KB, for example the <a href="Disk%20II">Apple Disk II</a> described as "140KB" had a 140×1024-byte capacity, and the original "360KB" double sided, double density disk drive used on the IBM PC had a 360×1024-byte capacity.

In many cases diskette hardware was marketed based on unformatted capacity, and the overhead required to format sectors on the media would reduce the nominal capacity as well (and this overhead typically varied based on the size of the formatted sectors), leading to more irregularities.

The capacities of most <a href="optical%20disc">optical disc</a> storage media like <a href="DVD">DVD</a>, <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a>, <a href="HD%20DVD">HD DVD</a> and <a href="Magneto-optical%20drive">magneto-optical (MO)</a> are given using SI decimal prefixes.
A "4.7 GB" DVD has a nominal capacity of about 4.38 <a href="GiB">GiB</a>. However, <a href="compact%20disc">CD</a> capacities are always given using customary binary prefixes. Thus a "700-MB" (or "80-minute") CD has a nominal capacity of about 700 <a href="MiB">MiB</a> (approx 730 MB).

Tape drive and media manufacturers use SI decimal prefixes to identify capacity.

Certain units are always used with SI decimal prefixes even in computing contexts.
Two examples are <a href="hertz">hertz</a> (Hz), which is used to measure the <a href="clock%20rate">clock rate</a>s of electronic components, and bit/s, used to measure <a href="bit%20rate">data transmission speed</a>.

<a href="Computer%20bus">Bus</a> clock speeds and therefore bandwidths are both quoted using SI decimal prefixes.


IEC prefixes are used by <a href="Toshiba">Toshiba</a>, <a href="IBM">IBM</a>, <a href="Hewlett-Packard">HP</a> to advertise or describe some of their products. According to one HP brochure, <a href="http%3A//h20566.www2.hp.com/portal/site/hpsc/template.BINARYPORTLET/public/kb/docDisplay/resource.process/%3Fspf_p.tpst%3DkbDocDisplay_ws_BI%26amp%3Bspf_p.rid_kbDocDisplay%3DdocDisplayResURL%26amp%3Bjavax.portlet.begCacheTok%3Dcom.vignette.cachetoken%26amp%3Bspf_p.rst_kbDocDisplay%3Dwsrp-resourceState%253DdocId%25253Demr_na-c02022732-1%25257CdocLocale%25253D%26amp%3Bjavax.portlet.endCacheTok%3Dcom.vignette.cachetoken"></a> "[t]o reduce confusion, vendors are pursuing one of two remedies: they are changing SI prefixes to the new binary prefixes, or they are recalculating the numbers as powers of ten." The <a href="IBM%20Data%20Center">IBM Data Center</a> also uses IEC prefixes to reduce confusion. The IBM Style Guide reads "To help avoid inaccuracy (especially with the larger prefixes) and potential ambiguity, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 2000 adopted a set of prefixes specifically for binary multipliers (See IEC 60027-2). Their use is now supported by the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and incorporated into ISO 80000. They are also required by EU law and in certain contexts in the US.

However, most documentation and products in the industry continue to use SI prefixes when referring to binary multipliers. In product documentation, follow the same standard that is used in the product itself (for example, in the interface or firmware). Whether you choose to use IEC prefixes for powers of 2 and SI prefixes for powers of 10, or use SI prefixes for a dual purpose ... be consistent in your usage and explain to the user your adopted system."

National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum

The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is an American history <a href="museum">museum</a> and <a href="hall%20of%20fame">hall of fame</a>, located in <a href="Cooperstown%2C%20New%20York">Cooperstown, New York</a>, and operated by private interests. It serves as the central point for the study of the <a href="history%20of%20baseball%20in%20the%20United%20States">history of baseball in the United States</a> and beyond, displays baseball-related artifacts and exhibits, and honors those who have excelled in <a href="baseball%20positions">playing</a>, <a href="manager%20%28baseball%29">managing</a>, and serving the sport. The Hall's motto is "Preserving History, Honoring Excellence, Connecting Generations."

The word Cooperstown is often used as shorthand (or a <a href="Metonymy">metonym</a>) for the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

The Hall of Fame was established in 1939 by <a href="Stephen%20Carlton%20Clark">Stephen Carlton Clark</a>, the owner of a local hotel. Clark had sought to bring tourists to a city hurt by the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, which reduced the local tourist trade, and <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a>, which devastated the local <a href="hops">hops</a> industry. A new building was constructed, and the Hall of Fame was dedicated on June 12, 1939. (Clark's granddaughter, Jane Forbes Clark, is the current chairman of the Board of Directors.)

The <a href="Doubleday%20myth">erroneous claim</a> that <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> hero <a href="Abner%20Doubleday">Abner Doubleday</a> <a href="Origins%20of%20baseball">invented baseball</a> in Cooperstown was instrumental in the early marketing of the Hall.

An expanded library and research facility opened in 1994. <a href="Dale%20Petroskey">Dale Petroskey</a> became the organization's president in 1999.

In 2002, the Hall launched "Baseball As America", a traveling exhibit that toured ten American museums over six years. The Hall of Fame has since also sponsored educational programming on the Internet to bring the Hall of Fame to schoolchildren who might not visit. The Hall and Museum completed a series of renovations in spring 2005. The Hall of Fame also presents an annual exhibit at FanFest at the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">Major League Baseball All-Star Game</a>.

<a href="Jeff%20Idelson">Jeff Idelson</a> replaced Petroskey as president on April 16, 2008. He had been acting as president since March 25, 2008, when Petroskey was forced to resign for having "failed to exercise proper fiduciary responsibility" and making "judgments that were not in the best interest of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum."

In 2012, Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed a law ordering the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> to produce and sell commemorative, non-circulating coins to benefit the private, non-profit Hall. The bill, , was introduced in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> by Rep. <a href="Richard%20L.%20Hanna">Richard Hanna</a>, a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> from New York, and passed the House on October 26, 2011. The coins, which depict baseball gloves and balls, are the first concave designs produced by the Mint. The mintage included 50,000 gold coins, 400,000 silver coins, and 750,000 clad (Nickel-Copper) coins. The Mint released them on March 27, 2014, and the gold and silver editions quickly sold out. The Hall receives money from surcharges included in the sale price: a total of $9.5 million if all the coins are sold.

Among baseball fans, "Hall of Fame" means not only the museum and facility in Cooperstown, New York, but the pantheon of players, <a href="manager%20%28baseball%29">managers</a>, <a href="umpire%20%28baseball%29">umpires</a>, executives, and pioneers who have been enshrined in the Hall. The first five men elected were <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a>, <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, <a href="Honus%20Wagner">Honus Wagner</a>, <a href="Christy%20Mathewson">Christy Mathewson</a> and <a href="Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a>, chosen in 1936; roughly 20 more were selected before the entire group was inducted at the Hall's 1939 opening. , 317 people had been elected to the Hall of Fame, including 220 former <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> players, 35 <a href="Negro%20league%20baseball">Negro league baseball</a> players and executives, 22 managers, 10 umpires, and 30 pioneers, executives, and organizers. 114 members of the Hall of Fame have been inducted posthumously, including four who died after their selection was announced. Of the 35 Negro league members, 29 were inducted posthumously, including all 24 selected since the 1990s. The Hall of Fame includes one female member, <a href="Effa%20Manley">Effa Manley</a>.

The newest inductees, enshrined on July 30, , are players <a href="Jeff%20Bagwell">Jeff Bagwell</a>, <a href="Tim%20Raines">Tim Raines</a>, and <a href="Iv%C3%A1n%20Rodr%C3%ADguez">Iván Rodríguez</a>, plus executives <a href="John%20Schuerholz">John Schuerholz</a> and <a href="Bud%20Selig">Bud Selig</a>. In addition to honoring Hall of Fame inductees, the National Baseball Hall of Fame has presented 41 men with the <a href="Ford%20C.%20Frick%20Award">Ford C. Frick Award</a> for excellence in broadcasting, 67 men and one woman with the <a href="J.%20G.%20Taylor%20Spink%20Award">J. G. Taylor Spink Award</a> for excellence in baseball writing, and three men and one woman with the <a href="Buck%20O%27Neil%20Lifetime%20Achievement%20Award">Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award</a> for contributions to baseball. While Frick and Spink Award honorees are not members of the Hall of Fame, they are recognized in an exhibit in the Hall of Fame's library. O'Neil Award honorees are also not Hall of Fame members, but are listed alongside a permanent statue of the award's namesake and first recipient, <a href="Buck%20O%27Neil">Buck O'Neil</a>, that stands at the Hall.

Players are currently inducted into the Hall of Fame through election by either the <a href="Baseball%20Writers%27%20Association%20of%20America">Baseball Writers' Association of America</a> (or BBWAA), or the <a href="Veterans%20Committee">Veterans Committee</a>, which now consists of four subcommittees, each of which considers and votes for candidates from a separate era of baseball. Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more who also have been actively covering MLB at any time in the 10 years preceding the election (the latter requirement was added for the 2016 election). From a final ballot typically including 25–40 candidates, each writer may vote for up to 10 players; until the late 1950s, voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates. Any player named on 75% or more of all ballots cast is elected. A player who is named on fewer than 5% of ballots is dropped from future elections. In some instances, the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots, but in the mid-1990s, dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, even by the Veterans Committee. A 2001 change in the election procedures restored the eligibility of these dropped players; while their names will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, they may be considered by the Veterans Committee. Players receiving 5% or more of the votes but fewer than 75% are reconsidered annually until a maximum of ten years of eligibility (lowered from fifteen years for the 2015 election).

Under special circumstances, certain players may be deemed eligible for induction even though they have not met all requirements. <a href="Addie%20Joss">Addie Joss</a> was elected in 1978, despite only playing nine seasons before he died of meningitis. Additionally, if an otherwise eligible player dies before his fifth year of retirement, then that player may be placed on the ballot at the first election at least six months after his death. <a href="Roberto%20Clemente">Roberto Clemente</a>'s induction in 1973 set the precedent when the writers chose to put him up for consideration after his death on New Year's Eve, 1972.

The five-year waiting period was established in 1954 after an evolutionary process. In 1936 all players were eligible, including active ones. From the 1937 election until the 1945 election, there was no waiting period, so any retired player was eligible, but writers were discouraged from voting for current major leaguers. Since there was no formal rule preventing a writer from casting a ballot for an active player, the scribes did not always comply with the informal guideline; <a href="Joe%20DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a> received a vote in 1945, for example. From the 1946 election until the 1954 election, an official one-year waiting period was in effect. (DiMaggio, for example, retired after the 1951 season and was first eligible in the 1953 election.) The modern rule establishing a wait of five years was passed in 1954, although an exception was made for Joe DiMaggio because of his high level of previous support, thus permitting him to be elected within four years of his retirement.

Contrary to popular belief, no formal exception was made for <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a> (other than to hold a special one-man election for him): there was no waiting period at that time, and Gehrig met all other qualifications, so he would have been eligible for the next regular election after he retired during the 1939 season. However, the BBWAA decided to hold a special election at the 1939 Winter Meetings in Cincinnati, specifically to elect Gehrig (most likely because it was known that he was <a href="Amyotrophic%20lateral%20sclerosis">terminally ill</a>, making it uncertain that he would live long enough to see another election). Nobody else was on that ballot, and the numerical results have never been made public. Since no elections were held in 1940 or 1941, the special election permitted Gehrig to enter the Hall while still alive.

If a player fails to be elected by the BBWAA within 10 years of his retirement from active play, he may be selected by the Veterans Committee. Following changes to the election process for that body made in 2010 and 2016, it is now responsible for electing all otherwise eligible candidates who are not eligible for the BBWAA ballot—both long-retired players and non-playing personnel (managers, umpires, and executives). From 2011 through 2016, each candidate could be considered once every three years; now, the frequency depends on the era in which an individual made his greatest contributions. A more complete discussion of the new process is available <a href="%23Changes%20to%20Veterans%20Committee%20process">below</a>.

From 2008 to 2010, following changes made by the Hall in July 2007, the main Veterans Committee, then made up of living Hall of Famers, voted only on players whose careers began in 1943 or later. These changes also established three separate committees to select other figures:

Players of the <a href="Negro%20League%20baseball">Negro Leagues</a> have also been considered at various times, beginning in 1971. In 2005 the Hall completed a study on African American players between the late 19th century and the integration of the major leagues in 1947, and conducted a special election for such players in February 2006; seventeen figures from the Negro Leagues were chosen in that election, in addition to the eighteen previously selected. Following the 2010 changes, Negro Leagues figures were primarily considered for induction alongside other figures from the 1871–1946 era, called the "Pre-Integration Era" by the Hall; since 2016, Negro Leagues figures are primarily considered alongside other figures from what the Hall calls the "Early Baseball" era (1871–1949).

Predictably, the selection process catalyzes endless debate among baseball fans over the merits of various candidates. Even players elected years ago remain the subjects of discussions as to whether they deserved election. For example, <a href="Bill%20James">Bill James</a>' book "<a href="Whatever%20Happened%20to%20the%20Hall%20of%20Fame%3F">Whatever Happened to the Hall of Fame?</a>" goes into detail about who he believes does and does not belong in the Hall of Fame.

The actions and composition of the Veterans Committee have been at times controversial, with occasional selections of contemporaries and teammates of the committee members over seemingly more worthy candidates.

In 2001, the Veterans Committee was reformed to comprise the living Hall of Fame members and other honorees. The revamped Committee held three election, in <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%202003">2003</a> and <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%202007">2007</a>, for both players and non-players, and in <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%202005">2005</a> for players only. No individual was elected in that time, sparking criticism among some observers who expressed doubt whether the new Veterans Committee would ever elect a player. The Committee members, most of whom were Hall members, were accused of being reluctant to elect new candidates in the hope of heightening the value of their own selection. After no one was selected for the third consecutive election in 2007, Hall of Famer <a href="Mike%20Schmidt">Mike Schmidt</a> noted, "The same thing happens every year. The current members want to preserve the prestige as much as possible, and are unwilling to open the doors." In 2007, the committee and its selection processes were again reorganized; the main committee then included all living members of the Hall, and voted on a reduced number of candidates from among players whose careers began in 1943 or later. Separate committees, including sportswriters and broadcasters, would select umpires, managers and executives, as well as players from earlier eras.

In the first election to be held under the 2007 revisions, two managers and three executives were elected in December 2007 as part of the <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%202008">2008 election process</a>. The next Veterans Committee elections for players were held in December 2008 as part of the <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%202009">2009 election process</a>; the main committee did not select a player, while the panel for pre–World War II players elected <a href="Joe%20Gordon">Joe Gordon</a> in its first and ultimately only vote. The main committee voted as part of the election process for inductions in odd-numbered years, while the pre-World War II panel would vote every five years, and the panel for umpires, managers, and executives voted as part of the election process for inductions in even-numbered years.

Further changes to the Veterans Committee process were announced by the Hall on July 26, 2010, effective with the <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%202011">2011 election</a>.

All individuals eligible for induction but not eligible for BBWAA consideration were considered on a single ballot, grouped by the following eras in which they made their greatest contributions:

The Hall used the BBWAA's Historical Overview Committee to formulate the ballots for each era, consisting of 12 individuals for the Expansion Era and 10 for the other eras. The Hall's board of directors selected a committee of 16 voters for each era, made up of Hall of Famers, executives, baseball historians, and media members. Each committee met and voted at the Baseball Winter Meetings once every three years. The Expansion Era committee held its first vote in 2010 for 2011 induction, with longtime <a href="general%20manager%20%28baseball%29">general manager</a> <a href="Pat%20Gillick">Pat Gillick</a> becoming the first individual elected under the new procedure. The <a href="Golden%20Era%20Veterans%20Committee">Golden Era committee</a> voted in 2011 for the induction class of 2012, with <a href="Ron%20Santo">Ron Santo</a> becoming the first player elected under the new procedure. The Pre-Integration Era committee voted in 2012 for the induction class of 2013, electing three figures. Subsequent elections rotated among the three committees in that order through the <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%202011">2016 election</a>.

In July 2016, however, the Hall of Fame announced a restructuring of the timeframes to be considered, with a much greater emphasis on modern eras. Four new committees were established:

All committees' ballots now include 10 candidates. While there was previously a one-year waiting period after elimination from annual BBWAA consideration, there is now no waiting period. At least one committee convenes each December as part of the election process for the following calendar year's induction ceremony. The Early Baseball committee convenes only in years ending in 0 (2020, 2030). The Golden Days committee convenes only in years ending in 0 and 5 (2020, 2025). The remaining two committees convene twice every 5 years. More specifically, the Today's Game and Modern Baseball committees alternate their meetings in that order, skipping years in which either the Early Baseball or Golden Days committee meets. This means that in the next two 5-year cycles, the Today's Game committee (having met in 2016) will meet in 2018, 2021, and 2023, while the Modern Baseball committee will meet in 2017, 2019, 2022 and 2024. Additionally, the Hall of Fame has modified the criteria under which active executives can be considered for induction. All active executives age 70 or older may now have their careers reviewed as part of the Era Committee balloting process, regardless of the position they hold in an organization, and regardless of whether their body of work has been completed. Previously, active executives 65 years or older were eligible for consideration.

While the text on a player's or manager's plaque lists all teams for which the inductee was a member in that specific role, inductees are usually depicted wearing the cap of a specific team, though in a few cases, like umpires, they wear caps without logos. (Executives are not depicted wearing caps.) Additionally, as of 2015, inductee biographies on the Hall's website for all players and managers, and executives who were associated with specific teams, list a "primary team", which does not necessarily match the cap logo. The Hall selects the logo "based on where that player makes his most indelible mark."

Although the Hall always made the final decision on which logo was shown, until 2001 the Hall deferred to the wishes of players or managers whose careers were linked with multiple teams. Some examples of inductees associated with multiple teams are the following:

In all of the above cases, the "primary team" is the team for which the inductee spent the largest portion of his career except for Ryan, whose primary team is listed as the Angels despite playing one fewer season for that team than for the Astros.

In 2001, the Hall of Fame decided to change the policy on cap logo selection, as a result of rumors that some teams were offering compensation, such as number retirement, money, or organizational jobs, in exchange for the cap designation. (For example, though <a href="Wade%20Boggs">Wade Boggs</a> denied the claims, some media reports had said that his contract with the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Devil%20Rays">Tampa Bay Devil Rays</a> required him to request depiction in the Hall of Fame as a Devil Ray.) The Hall decided that it would no longer defer to the inductee, though the player's wishes would be considered, when deciding on the logo to appear on the plaque. Newly elected members affected by the change include the following:

According to the Hall of Fame, approximately 300,000 visitors enter the museum each year, and the running total has surpassed 14 million. These visitors see only a fraction of its 40,000 artifacts, 3 million library items (such as newspaper clippings and photos) and 140,000 baseball cards.

The Hall has seen a noticeable decrease in attendance in recent years. A 2013 story on "<a href="ESPN.com">ESPN.com</a>" about the village of Cooperstown and its relation to the game partially linked the reduced attendance with Cooperstown Dreams Park, a youth baseball complex about away in the town of <a href="Hartwick%2C%20New%20York">Hartwick</a>. The 22 fields at Dreams Park currently draw 17,000 players each summer for a week of intensive play; while the complex includes housing for the players, their parents and grandparents must stay elsewhere. According to the story,Prior to Dreams Park, a room might be filled for a week by several sets of tourists. Now, that room will be taken by just one family for the week, and that family may only go into Cooperstown and the Hall of Fame once. While there are other contributing factors (the <a href="Great%20Recession">recession</a> and high gas prices among them), the Hall's attendance has tumbled since Dreams Park opened. The Hall drew 383,000 visitors in 1999. It drew 262,000 last year.




A controversy erupted in 1982, when it emerged that some historic items given to the Hall had been sold on the collectibles market. The items had been lent to the <a href="Baseball%20Commissioner">Baseball Commissioner</a>'s office, gotten mixed up with other property owned by the Commissioner's office and employees of the office, and moved to the garage of <a href="Joe%20Reichler">Joe Reichler</a>, an assistant to Commissioner <a href="Bowie%20Kuhn">Bowie Kuhn</a>, who sold the items to resolve his personal financial difficulties. Under pressure from the New York Attorney General, the Commissioner's Office made reparations, but the negative publicity damaged the Hall of Fame's reputation, and made it more difficult for it to solicit donations.

Following the banning of <a href="Pete%20Rose">Pete Rose</a> from MLB, the selection rules for the Baseball Hall of Fame were modified to prevent the induction of anyone on Baseball's permanent suspension list, such as Rose or <a href="Shoeless%20Joe%20Jackson">Shoeless Joe Jackson</a>. Many others have been barred from participation in MLB, but none have Hall of Fame qualifications on the level of Jackson or Rose.

Jackson and Rose were both banned from MLB for life for actions related to gambling on their own teams—Jackson was determined to have cooperated with those who conspired to lose the <a href="1919%20World%20Series">1919 World Series</a> intentionally, and Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent spot on the ineligible list in return for MLB's promise to make no official finding in relation to alleged betting on the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> when he was their manager in the 1980s. (Baseball's Rule 21, prominently posted in every clubhouse locker room, mandates permanent banishment from the MLB for having a gambling interest of any sort on a game in which a player or manager is directly involved.) Rose later admitted that he bet on the Reds in his <a href="My%20Prison%20Without%20Bars">2004 autobiography</a>. Baseball fans are deeply split on the issue of whether these two should remain banned or have their punishment revoked. Writer <a href="Bill%20James">Bill James</a>, though he advocates Rose eventually making it into the Hall of Fame, compared the people who want to put Jackson in the Hall of Fame to "those women who show up at murder trials wanting to marry the cute murderer".

<doc id="4079" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4079" title="BPP (complexity)">
BPP (complexity)

In <a href="computational%20complexity%20theory">computational complexity theory</a>, BPP, which stands for bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time is the class of <a href="decision%20problem">decision problem</a>s solvable by a <a href="probabilistic%20Turing%20machine">probabilistic Turing machine</a> in <a href="polynomial%20time">polynomial time</a> with an error <a href="probability">probability</a> bounded away from 1/2 for all instances.
BPP is one of the largest "practical" classes of problems, meaning most problems of interest in BPP have efficient <a href="probabilistic%20algorithm">probabilistic algorithm</a>s that can be run quickly on real modern machines. BPP also contains P, the class of problems solvable in polynomial time with a deterministic machine, since a deterministic machine is a special case of a probabilistic machine.

Informally, a problem is in BPP if there is an algorithm for it that has the following properties:

A language "L" is in BPP if and only if there exists a probabilistic Turing machine "M", such that
Unlike the complexity class <a href="ZPP%20%28complexity%29">ZPP</a>, the machine "M" is required to run for polynomial time on all inputs, regardless of the outcome of the random coin flips.

Alternatively, BPP can be defined using only deterministic Turing machines. A language "L" is in BPP if and only if there exists a polynomial "p" and deterministic Turing machine "M", such that
In this definition, the string "y" corresponds to the output of the random coin flips that the probabilistic Turing machine would have made. For some applications this definition is preferable since it does not mention probabilistic Turing machines.

In practice, an error probability of might not be acceptable, however, the choice of in the definition is arbitrary. It can be any <a href="mathematical%20constant">constant</a> between 0 and (exclusive) and the set BPP will be unchanged. It does not even have to be constant: the same class of problems is defined by allowing error as high as − "n" on the one hand, or requiring error as small as 2 on the other hand, where "c" is any positive constant, and "n" is the length of input. The idea is that there is a probability of error, but if the algorithm is run many times, the chance that the majority of the runs are wrong <a href="exponential%20decay">drops off exponentially</a> as a consequence of the <a href="Chernoff%20bound">Chernoff bound</a>. This makes it possible to create a highly accurate algorithm by merely running the algorithm several times and taking a "majority vote" of the answers. For example, if one defined the class with the restriction that the algorithm can be wrong with probability at most , this would result in the same class of problems.

Besides the problems in P, which are obviously in BPP, many problems were known to be in BPP but not known to be in P. The number of such problems is decreasing, and it is conjectured that P = BPP.

For a long time, one of the most famous problems that was known to be in BPP but not known to be in P was the problem of <a href="primality%20test">determining</a> whether a given number is <a href="prime%20number">prime</a>. However, in the 2002 paper "<a href="AKS%20primality%20test">PRIMES is in P</a>", <a href="Manindra%20Agrawal">Manindra Agrawal</a> and his students <a href="Neeraj%20Kayal">Neeraj Kayal</a> and <a href="Nitin%20Saxena">Nitin Saxena</a> found a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for this problem, thus showing that it is in P.

An important example of a problem in BPP (in fact in <a href="RP%20%28complexity%29">co-RP</a>) still not known to be in P is <a href="polynomial%20identity%20testing">polynomial identity testing</a>, the problem of determining whether a polynomial is identically equal to the zero polynomial, when you have access to the value of the polynomial for any given input, but not to the coefficients. In other words, is there an assignment of values to the variables such that when a nonzero polynomial is evaluated on these values, the result is nonzero? It suffices to choose each variable's value uniformly at random from a finite subset of at least "d" values to achieve bounded error probability, where "d" is the total degree of the polynomial.

If the access to randomness is removed from the definition of BPP, we get the complexity class P. In the definition of the class, if we replace the ordinary <a href="Turing%20machine">Turing machine</a> with a <a href="quantum%20computer">quantum computer</a>, we get the class <a href="BQP">BQP</a>.

Adding <a href="postselection">postselection</a> to BPP, or allowing computation paths to have different lengths, gives the class BPP. BPP is known to contain NP, and it is contained in its quantum counterpart <a href="PostBQP">PostBQP</a>.

A <a href="Monte%20Carlo%20algorithm">Monte Carlo algorithm</a> is a <a href="randomized%20algorithm">randomized algorithm</a> which is likely to be correct. Problems in the class BPP have Monte Carlo algorithms with polynomial bounded running time. This is compared to a <a href="Las%20Vegas%20algorithm">Las Vegas algorithm</a> which is a randomized algorithm which either outputs the correct answer, or outputs "fail" with low probability. Las Vegas algorithms with polynomial bound running times are used to define the class <a href="ZPP%20%28complexity%29">ZPP</a>. Alternatively, ZPP contains probabilistic algorithms that are always correct and have expected polynomial running time. This is weaker than saying it is a polynomial time algorithm, since it may run for super-polynomial time, but with very low probability.

It is known that BPP is closed under <a href="Complement%20%28complexity%29">complement</a>; that is, BPP = co-BPP. BPP is <a href="low%20%28complexity%29">low</a> for itself, meaning that a BPP machine with the power to solve BPP problems instantly (a BPP <a href="oracle%20machine">oracle machine</a>) is not any more powerful than the machine without this extra power. In symbols, BPP = BPP.

The relationship between BPP and <a href="NP%20%28complexity%29">NP</a> is unknown: it is not known whether BPP is a <a href="subset">subset</a> of <a href="NP%20%28complexity%29">NP</a>, NP is a subset of BPP or neither. If NP is contained in BPP, which is considered unlikely since it would imply practical solutions for <a href="NP-complete">NP-complete</a> problems, then NP = RP and <a href="PH%20%28complexity%29">PH</a> ⊆ BPP.

It is known that <a href="RP%20%28complexity%29">RP</a> is a subset of BPP, and BPP is a subset of <a href="PP%20%28complexity%29">PP</a>. It is not known whether those two are strict subsets, since we don't even know if P is a strict subset of PSPACE. BPP is contained in the second level of the <a href="polynomial%20hierarchy">polynomial hierarchy</a> and therefore it is contained in PH. More precisely, the <a href="Sipser%E2%80%93Lautemann%20theorem">Sipser–Lautemann theorem</a> states that formula_1. As a result, P = NP leads to P = BPP since PH collapses to P in this case. Thus either P = BPP or P ≠ NP or both.

<a href="Adleman%27s%20theorem">Adleman's theorem</a> states that membership in any language in BPP can be determined by a family of polynomial-size <a href="Boolean%20circuit">Boolean circuit</a>s, which means BPP is contained in <a href="P/poly">P/poly</a>. Indeed, as a consequence of the proof of this fact, every BPP algorithm operating on inputs of bounded length can be derandomized into a deterministic algorithm using a fixed string of random bits. Finding this string may be expensive, however.
Some weak separation results for Monte Carlo time classes were proven by , see also 

The class BPP is closed under complementation, union and intersection.

Relative to oracles, we know that there exist oracles A and B, such that P = BPP and P ≠ BPP. Moreover, relative to a <a href="random%20oracle">random oracle</a> with probability 1, P = BPP and BPP is strictly contained in NP and co-NP.

There is even an oracle in which BPP=EXP (and hence P<NP<BPP=EXP=NEXP), which can be iteratively constructed as follows. For a fixed <a href="E%20%28complexity%29">E</a> (relativized) complete problem, the oracle will give correct answers with high probability if queried with the problem instance followed by a random string of length "kn" ("n" is instance length; "k" is an appropriate small constant). Start with "n"=1. For every instance of the problem of length "n" fix oracle answers (see lemma below) to fix the instance output. Next, provide the instance outputs for queries consisting of the instance followed by "kn"-length string, and then treat output for queries of length ≤("k"+1)"n" as fixed, and proceed with instances of length "n"+1.

Lemma: Given a problem (specifically, an oracle machine code and time constraint) in relativized E, for every partially constructed oracle and input of length "n", the output can be fixed by specifying 2 oracle answers.
Proof: The machine is simulated, and the oracle answers (that are not already fixed) are fixed step-by-step. There is at most one oracle query per deterministic computation step. For the relativized NP oracle, if possible fix the output to be yes by choosing a computation path and fixing the answers of the base oracle; otherwise no fixing is necessary, and either way there is at most 1 answer of the base oracle per step. Since there are 2 steps, the lemma follows.

The lemma ensures that (for a large enough "k"), it is possible to do the construction while leaving enough strings for the relativized E answers. Also, we can ensure that for the relativized E, linear time suffices, even for function problems (if given a function oracle and linear output size) and with exponentially small (with linear exponent) error probability. Also, this construction is effective in that given an arbitrary oracle A we can arrange the oracle B to have P≤P and EXP=EXP=BPP. Also, for a <a href="ZPP%20%28complexity%29">ZPP</a>=EXP oracle (and hence ZPP=BPP=EXP<NEXP), one would fix the answers in the relativized E computation to a special nonanswer, thus ensuring that no fake answers are given.

The existence of certain strong <a href="pseudorandom%20number%20generators">pseudorandom number generators</a> is <a href="conjecture">conjecture</a>d by most experts of the field. This conjecture implies that randomness does not give additional computational power to polynomial time computation, that is, P = RP = BPP. Note that ordinary generators are not sufficient to show this result; any probabilistic algorithm implemented using a typical random number generator will always produce incorrect results on certain inputs irrespective of the seed (though these inputs might be rare).

<a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20Babai">László Babai</a>, <a href="Lance%20Fortnow">Lance Fortnow</a>, <a href="Noam%20Nisan">Noam Nisan</a>, and <a href="Avi%20Wigderson">Avi Wigderson</a> showed that unless <a href="EXPTIME">EXPTIME</a> collapses to <a href="MA%20%28complexity%29">MA</a>, BPP is contained in 
The class i.o.-SUBEXP, which stands for infinitely often SUBEXP, contains problems which have <a href="sub-exponential%20time">sub-exponential time</a> algorithms for infinitely many input sizes. They also showed that P = BPP if the exponential-time hierarchy, which is defined in terms of the <a href="polynomial%20hierarchy">polynomial hierarchy</a> and E as E, collapses to E; however, note that the exponential-time hierarchy is usually conjectured "not" to collapse.

<a href="Russell%20Impagliazzo">Russell Impagliazzo</a> and Avi Wigderson showed that if any problem in <a href="E%20%28complexity%29">E</a>, where 
has circuit complexity 2 then P = BPP.

BQP

In <a href="computational%20complexity%20theory">computational complexity theory</a>, BQP (bounded-error quantum polynomial time) is the class of <a href="decision%20problems">decision problems</a> solvable by a <a href="quantum%20computer">quantum computer</a> in <a href="polynomial%20time">polynomial time</a>, with an error probability of at most 1/3 for all instances. It is the quantum analogue of the complexity class <a href="BPP%20%28complexity%29">BPP</a>.

A decision problem is a member of BQP if there exists an <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a> for a quantum computer (a <a href="quantum%20algorithm">quantum algorithm</a>) that solves the decision problem with "high" probability and is guaranteed to run in polynomial time. A run of the algorithm will correctly solve the decision problem with a probability of at least 2/3.

Similarly to other "bounded error" probabilistic classes the choice of 1/3 in the definition is arbitrary. We can run the algorithm a constant number of times and take a majority vote to achieve any desired probability of correctness less than 1, using the <a href="Chernoff%20bound">Chernoff bound</a>. Detailed analysis shows that the complexity class is unchanged by allowing error as high as 1/2 − "n" on the one hand, or requiring error as small as 2 on the other hand, where "c" is any positive constant, and "n" is the length of input.

BQP can also be viewed as the languages associated with certain bounded-error uniform families of <a href="quantum%20circuit">quantum circuit</a>s. A language "L" is in BQP if and only if there exists a <a href="Circuit%20complexity%23Polynomial-time%20uniform">polynomial-time uniform</a> family of quantum circuits formula_1, such that

The number of <a href="qubit">qubit</a>s in the computer is allowed to be a <a href="polynomial%20function">polynomial function</a> of the instance size. For example, algorithms are known for factoring an "n"-bit integer using just over 2"n" qubits (<a href="Shor%27s%20algorithm">Shor's algorithm</a>).

Usually, computation on a quantum computer ends with a <a href="Measurement%20in%20quantum%20mechanics">measurement</a>. This leads to a <a href="Wavefunction%20collapse">collapse</a> of quantum state to one of the <a href="Quantum%20state">basis states</a>. It can be said that the quantum state is measured to be in the correct state with high probability.

Quantum computers have gained widespread interest because some problems of practical interest are known to be in BQP, but suspected to be outside P. Some prominent examples are:

This class is defined for a quantum computer and its natural corresponding class for an ordinary computer (or a <a href="Turing%20machine">Turing machine</a> plus a source of randomness) is . Just like and , is <a href="low%20%28complexity%29">low</a> for itself, which means = . Informally, this is true because polynomial time algorithms are closed under composition. If a polynomial time algorithm calls as a subroutine polynomially many polynomial time algorithms, the resulting algorithm is still polynomial time.

In fact, is <a href="low%20%28complexity%29">low</a> for , meaning that a machine achieves no benefit from being able to solve problems instantly, an indication of the possible difference in power between these similar classes.

As the problem of has not yet been solved, the proof of inequality between and classes mentioned above is supposed to be difficult. The relation between and is not known.

Adding <a href="postselection">postselection</a> to results in the complexity class which is equal to .

Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human

Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human (1995) is a <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> novel by <a href="K.%20W.%20Jeter">K. W. Jeter</a>, and a continuation of both the film "<a href="Blade%20Runner">Blade Runner</a>", and the novel upon which it was based, <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>'s "<a href="Do%20Androids%20Dream%20of%20Electric%20Sheep%3F">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a>"

Beginning several months after the events in "Blade Runner", Deckard has retired to an isolated shack outside the city, taking the replicant Rachael with him in a Tyrell transport container, which slows down the replicant aging process. He is approached by a woman who explains she is Sarah Tyrell, niece of Eldon Tyrell, heiress to the entire Tyrell Corporation and the human template ("templant") for the Rachael replicant. She asks Deckard to hunt down the "missing" sixth replicant. At the same time, the human template for Roy Batty hires Dave Holden, the blade runner attacked by Leon, to help him hunt down the man he believes is the sixth replicant - Deckard.

Deckard and Holden's investigations lead them to re-visit Sebastian, Bryant, and John Isidore (from the book "Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?"), learning more about the nature of the blade runners and the replicants.

When Deckard, Batty, and Holden finally clash, Batty's inhuman fighting prowess leads Holden to believe he has been duped all along and that Batty is the sixth replicant; he shoots him. Deckard returns to Sarah with his suspicion: there is "no" sixth replicant. Sarah, speaking via a remote camera, confesses that she created and maintained the rumor herself, to deliberately discredit and eventually destroy the Tyrell Corporation, after her uncle Eldon created Rachael based on her and then abandoned the real Sarah. Sarah brings Rachael back to the Corporation building to meet with Deckard, and he escapes with her.

However, Holden - recovering from his injuries during the fight - later finds the truth: Rachael has been killed by Tyrell agents, and the "Rachael" who escaped with Deckard was actually Sarah. She has completed her revenge by both destroying Tyrell, and taking back Rachael's place.


The book's plot draws from other material related to "Blade Runner" in a number of ways:

However, it also contradicts material in some ways:

In 1996, <a href="Stuart%20Hazeldine">Stuart Hazeldine</a> had written a sequel based on "The Edge of Human", titled "Blade Runner Down"; however, the project was shelved due to problems concerning the rights to the novel.

Michael Giltz of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" gave the book a "C-", feeling that "only hardcore fans will be satisfied by this tale" and saying that Jeter's "habit of echoing dialogue and scenes from the film is annoying and begs comparisons he would do well to avoid." Tal Cohen of "Tal Cohen's Bookshelf" called "The Edge of Human" "a good book", praising Jeter's "further, and deeper, investigation of the questions Philip K. Dick originally asked", but criticized the book for its "needless grandioseness" and for "rel[ying] on "Blade Runner" too heavily, [as] the number of new characters introduced is extremely small..."

Ian Kaplan of "BearCave.com" gave the book three stars out of five, saying that while he was "not entirely satisfied" and felt that the "story tends to be shallow", "Jeter does deal with the moral dilemma of the Blade Runners who hunt down beings that are virtually human in every way." J. Patton of "The Bent Cover" praised Jeter for "[not] try[ing] to emulate Philip K. Dick", adding, "This book also has all the grittiness and dark edges that the movie showed off so well, along with a very fast pace that will keep you reading into the wee hours of the night."

Brainfuck

Brainfuck is an <a href="esoteric%20programming%20language">esoteric programming language</a> created in 1993 by Urban Müller, and notable for its extreme minimalism. 

The language consists of only eight simple commands and an <a href="instruction%20pointer">instruction pointer</a>. While it is fully <a href="Turing-complete">Turing-complete</a>, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse <a href="programmers">programmers</a>. Brainfuck simply requires one to break commands into microscopic steps. 

The language's name is a reference to the slang term "<a href="%3Awikt%3Abrainfuck">brainfuck</a>", which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding.
In 1992, Urban Müller, a Swiss physics student, took over a small online archive for <a href="Amiga">Amiga</a> software. The archive grew more popular, and was soon mirrored around the world. Today, it is the world's largest Amiga archive, known as <a href="Aminet">Aminet</a>. 

Müller designed Brainfuck with the goal of implementing it with the smallest possible <a href="compiler">compiler</a>, inspired by the 1024-byte compiler for the <a href="Esoteric_programming_language%23FALSE">FALSE programming language</a>. Müller's original compiler was implemented in machine language and compiled to a binary with a size of 296 bytes. He uploaded the first Brainfuck compiler to Aminet in 1993. The program came with a "Readme" file, which briefly described the language, and challenged the reader "Who can program anything useful with it? <a href="Emoticon">:)</a>". Müller also included an interpreter and some quite elaborate examples. A second version of the compiler used only 240 bytes.

As Aminet grew, the compiler became popular among the Amiga community, and in time it was implemented for other platforms. Several brainfuck compilers have been made smaller than 200 bytes, and one is only 100 bytes.

The language consists of eight <a href="command%20%28computing%29">command</a>s, listed below. A brainfuck program is a sequence of these commands, possibly interspersed with other characters (which are ignored). The commands are executed sequentially, with some exceptions: an <a href="Program%20Counter">instruction pointer</a> begins at the first command, and each command it points to is executed, after which it normally moves forward to the next command. The program terminates when the instruction pointer moves past the last command.

The brainfuck language uses a simple machine model consisting of the program and instruction pointer, as well as an array of at least 30,000 <a href="byte">byte</a> cells initialized to zero; a movable <a href="pointer%20%28computer%20programming%29">data pointer</a> (initialized to point to the leftmost byte of the array); and two streams of bytes for input and output (most often connected to a keyboard and a monitor respectively, and using the <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> character encoding).

The eight language commands each consist of a single character:

codice_2 and codice_1 match as parentheses usually do: each codice_2 matches exactly one codice_1 and vice versa, the codice_2 comes first, and there can be no unmatched codice_2 or codice_1 between the two.

Brainfuck programs can be translated into <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a> using the following substitutions, assuming codice_10 is of type codice_11 and has been initialized to point to an array of zeroed bytes:
As the name suggests, brainfuck programs tend to be difficult to comprehend. This is partly because any mildly complex task requires a long sequence of commands; partly it is because the program's text gives no direct indications of the program's <a href="state%20%28computer%20science%29">state</a>. These, as well as brainfuck's inefficiency and its limited input/output capabilities, are some of the reasons it is not used for serious programming. Nonetheless, like any <a href="Turing%20completeness">Turing-complete</a> language, brainfuck is theoretically capable of computing any computable function or simulating any other computational model, if given access to an unlimited amount of memory. A variety of brainfuck programs have been written. Although brainfuck programs, especially complicated ones, are difficult to write, it is quite trivial to write an interpreter for brainfuck in a more typical language such as C due to its simplicity. There even exists a brainfuck interpreter written in the brainfuck language itself.

Brainfuck is an example of a so-called <a href="Turing%20tarpit">Turing tarpit</a>: It can be used to write "any" program, but it is not practical to do so, because Brainfuck provides so little abstraction that the programs get very long or complicated.

Except for its two I/O commands, brainfuck is a minor variation of the formal programming language <a href="P%E2%80%B2%E2%80%B2">P′′</a> created by <a href="Corrado%20B%C3%B6hm">Corrado Böhm</a> in 1964. In fact, using six symbols equivalent to the respective brainfuck commands codice_12, codice_13, codice_14, codice_15, codice_2, codice_1, Böhm provided an explicit program for each of the basic functions that together serve to compute any <a href="computable%20function">computable function</a>. So the first "brainfuck" programs appear in Böhm's 1964 paper – and they were programs sufficient to prove Turing-completeness.

As a first, simple example, the following code snippet will add the current cell's value to the next cell: Each time the loop is executed, the current cell is decremented, the data pointer moves to the right, that next cell is incremented, and the data pointer moves left again. This sequence is repeated until the starting cell is 0.

This can be incorporated into a simple addition program as follows:

The following program prints <a href="Hello%20world%20program">"Hello World!"</a> and a newline to the screen:

For "readability", this code has been spread across many lines and blanks and comments have been added. Brainfuck ignores all characters except the eight commands codice_18 so no special syntax for comments is needed (as long as the comments do not contain the command characters). The code could just as well have been written as:
This program enciphers its input with the <a href="ROT13">ROT13</a> cipher. To do this, it must map characters A-M (<a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> 65-77) to N-Z (78-90), and vice versa. Also it must map a-m (97-109) to n-z (110-122) and vice versa. It must map all other characters to themselves; it reads characters one at a time and outputs their enciphered equivalents until it reads an EOF (here assumed to be represented as either -1 or "no change"), at which point the program terminates.

The basic approach used is as follows. Calling the input character "x", divide "x"-1 by 32, keeping quotient and remainder. Unless the quotient is 2 or 3, just output "x", having kept a copy of it during the division. If the quotient is 2 or 3, divide the remainder (("x"-1) modulo 32) by 13; if the quotient here is 0, output "x"+13; if 1, output "x"-13; if 2, output "x".

Regarding the division algorithm, when dividing "y" by "z" to get a quotient "q" and remainder "r", there is an outer loop which sets "q" and "r" first to the quotient and remainder of 1/"z", then to those of 2/"z", and so on; after it has executed "y" times, this outer loop terminates, leaving "q" and "r" set to the quotient and remainder of "y"/"z". (The dividend "y" is used as a diminishing counter that controls how many times this loop is executed.) Within the loop, there is code to increment "r" and decrement "y", which is usually sufficient; however, every "z"th time through the outer loop, it is necessary to zero "r" and increment "q". This is done with a diminishing counter set to the divisor "z"; each time through the outer loop, this counter is decremented, and when it reaches zero, it is refilled by moving the value from "r" back into it.

Partly because Urban Müller did not write a thorough language specification, the many subsequent brainfuck interpreters and compilers have come to use slightly different dialects of brainfuck.

In the classic distribution, the cells are of 8-bit size (cells are bytes), and this is still the most common size. However, to read non-textual data, a brainfuck program may need to distinguish an <a href="end-of-file">end-of-file</a> condition from any possible byte value; thus 16-bit cells have also been used. Some implementations have used 32-bit cells, 64-bit cells, or <a href="bignum">bignum</a> cells with practically unlimited range, but programs that use this extra range are likely to be slow, since storing the value "n" into a cell requires <a href="Big%20O%20notation%23Related%20asymptotic%20notations">Ω</a>("n") time as a cell's value may only be changed by incrementing and decrementing.

In all these variants, the codice_19 and codice_20 commands still read and write data in bytes. In most of them, the cells wrap around, i.e. incrementing a cell which holds its maximal value (with the codice_12 command) will bring it to its minimal value and vice versa. The exceptions are implementations which are distant from the underlying hardware, implementations that use bignums, and implementations that try to enforce portability.

Fortunately, it is usually easy to write brainfuck programs that do not ever cause integer wraparound or overflow, and therefore don't depend on cell size. Generally this means avoiding increment of +255 (unsigned 8-bit wraparound), or avoiding overstepping the boundaries of [-128, +127] (signed 8-bit wraparound) (since there are no comparison operators, a program cannot distinguish between a signed and unsigned <a href="two%27s%20complement">two's complement</a> fixed-bit-size cell and negativeness of numbers is a matter of interpretation). For more details on integer wraparound, see the <a href="Integer%20overflow">Integer overflow</a> article.

In the classic distribution, the array has 30,000 cells, and the pointer begins at the leftmost cell. Even more cells are needed to store things like the millionth <a href="Fibonacci%20number">Fibonacci number</a>, and the easiest way to make the language Turing-complete is to make the array unlimited on the right.

A few implementations extend the array to the left as well; this is an uncommon feature, and therefore portable brainfuck programs do not depend on it.

When the pointer moves outside the bounds of the array, some implementations will give an error message, some will try to extend the array dynamically, some will not notice and will produce <a href="undefined%20behavior">undefined behavior</a>, and a few will move the pointer to the opposite end of the array. Some tradeoffs are involved: expanding the array dynamically to the right is the most user-friendly approach and is good for memory-hungry programs, but it carries a speed penalty. If a fixed-size array is used it is helpful to make it very large, or better yet let the user set the size. Giving an error message for bounds violations is very useful for debugging but even that carries a speed penalty unless it can be handled by the operating system's memory protections.

Different operating systems (and sometimes different programming environments) use subtly different versions of ASCII. The most important difference is in the code used for the end of a line of text. MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows use a <a href="Newline%23Representations">CRLF</a>, i.e. a 13 followed by a 10, in most contexts. UNIX and its descendants (including GNU/Linux and Mac OS X) and Amigas use just 10, and older Macs use just 13. It would be unfortunate if brainfuck programs had to be rewritten for different operating systems. Fortunately, a unified standard is easy to find. Urban Müller's compiler and his example programs use 10, on both input and output; so do a large majority of existing brainfuck programs; and 10 is also more convenient to use than CRLF. Thus, brainfuck implementations should make sure that brainfuck programs that assume newline=10 will run properly; many do so, but some do not.

This assumption is also consistent with most of the world's sample code for <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a> and other languages, in that they use '\n', or 10, for their newlines. On systems that use CRLF line endings, the C standard library transparently remaps "\n" to "\r\n" on output and "\r\n" to "\n" on input for streams not opened in binary mode.

The behavior of the "codice_19" command when an <a href="end-of-file">end-of-file</a> condition has been encountered varies. Some implementations set the cell at the pointer to 0, some set it to the C constant EOF (in practice this is usually -1), some leave the cell's value unchanged. There is no real consensus; arguments for the three behaviors are as follows.

Setting the cell to 0 avoids the use of negative numbers, and makes it marginally more concise to write a loop that reads characters until EOF occurs. This is a language extension devised by Panu Kalliokoski.

Setting the cell to -1 allows EOF to be distinguished from any byte value (if the cells are larger than bytes), which is necessary for reading non-textual data; also, it is the behavior of the C translation of "codice_19" given in Müller's readme file. However, it is not obvious that those C translations are to be taken as normative.

Leaving the cell's value unchanged is the behavior of Urban Müller's brainfuck compiler. This behavior can easily coexist with either of the others; for instance, a program that assumes EOF=0 can set the cell to 0 before each "codice_19" command, and will then work correctly on implementations that do either EOF=0 or EOF="no change". It is so easy to accommodate the "no change" behavior that any brainfuck programmer interested in portability should do so.

Many people have created brainfuck equivalents (languages with commands that directly map to brainfuck) or brainfuck derivatives (languages that extend its behavior or map it into new semantic territory).

Some examples:
However, there are also unnamed minor variants (or dialects), possibly formed as a result of inattention, of which some of the more common are:

Bartolomeo Ammannati

Bartolomeo Ammannati (18 June 151113 April 1592) was an Italian <a href="architect">architect</a> and <a href="Sculpture">sculptor</a>, born at <a href="Settignano">Settignano</a>, near <a href="Florence">Florence</a>. He studied under <a href="Baccio%20Bandinelli">Baccio Bandinelli</a> and <a href="Jacopo%20Sansovino">Jacopo Sansovino</a> (assisting on the design of the Library of St. Mark's, the "<a href="Biblioteca%20Marciana">Biblioteca Marciana</a>", Venice) and closely imitated the style of <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>.

He was more distinguished in architecture than in sculpture. He worked in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> in collaboration with <a href="Giacomo%20Barozzi%20da%20Vignola">Vignola</a> and <a href="Giorgio%20Vasari">Vasari</a>), including designs for the <a href="Villa%20Giulia">Villa Giulia</a>, but also for works and at <a href="Lucca">Lucca</a>. He labored during 1558–1570, in the refurbishment and enlargement of <a href="Pitti%20Palace">Pitti Palace</a>, creating the courtyard consisting of three wings with rusticated facades, and one lower portico leading to the amphitheatre in the Boboli Gardens. His design mirrored the appearance of the main external façade of Pitti. He was also named "Consul" of <a href="Accademia%20delle%20Arti%20del%20Disegno">Accademia delle Arti del Disegno</a> of Florence, which had been founded by the Duke Cosimo I in 1563.
In 1569, Ammanati was commissioned to build the <a href="Ponte%20Santa%20Trinita">Ponte Santa Trinita</a>, a bridge over the Arno River. The three arches are elliptic, and though very light and elegant, has survived, when floods had damaged other Arno bridges at different times. Santa Trinita was destroyed in 1944, during World War II, and rebuilt in 1957.

Ammannati designed what is considered a prototypic <a href="mannerist">mannerist</a> sculptural ensemble in the "<a href="Fountain%20of%20Neptune%2C%20Florence">Fountain of Neptune</a>" ("Fontana del Nettuno"), prominently located in the <a href="Piazza%20della%20Signoria">Piazza della Signoria</a> in the center of Florence. The assignment was originally given to the aged <a href="Bartolommeo%20Bandinelli">Bartolommeo Bandinelli</a>; however when Bandinelli died, Ammannati's design, bested the submissions of <a href="Benvenuto%20Cellini">Benvenuto Cellini</a> and <a href="Vincenzo%20Danti">Vincenzo Danti</a>, to gain the commission. From 1563 and 1565, Ammannati and his assistants, among them <a href="Giambologna">Giambologna</a>, sculpted the block of marble that had been chosen by Bandinelli. He took Grand Duke <a href="Cosimo%20I">Cosimo I</a> as model for Neptune's face. The statue was meant to highlight Cosimo's goal of establishing a Florentine Naval force. When the work on the ungainly sea god was finished, and sited at the other corner of the Palazzo Vecchio of Michelangelo David statue, the then 87-year-old sculptor, is said to have scoffed at Ammannati that he had ruined a beautiful piece of marble, with the ditty: "Ammannati, Ammanato, che bel marmo hai rovinato!" Ammannati continued work on this fountain for a decade, adding around the perimeter a cornucopia of demigod figures: bronze reclining river gods, laughing <a href="satyr">satyr</a>s and marble sea horses emerging from the water. 

In 1550 Ammannati married <a href="Laura%20Battiferri">Laura Battiferri</a>, an elegant poet and an accomplished woman. Later in his life he had a religious crisis, influenced by <a href="Counter-Reformation">Counter-Reformation</a> piety, which resulted in condemning his own works depicting <a href="nudity">nudity</a>, and he left all his possessions to the <a href="Jesuits">Jesuits</a>.

He died in Florence in 1592.

Bordeaux

Bordeaux (; <a href="Gascon%20language">Gascon</a> <a href="Occitan%20language">Occitan</a>: "") is a port city on the <a href="Garonne">Garonne</a> River in the <a href="Gironde">Gironde</a> <a href="Departments%20of%20France">department</a> in southwestern <a href="France">France</a>.

The municipality (<a href="Communes%20of%20France">commune</a>) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 243,626 (2012). Together with its <a href="suburb">suburb</a>s and <a href="satellite%20town">satellite town</a>s, Bordeaux is the centre of the <a href="Urban%20Community%20of%20Bordeaux">Bordeaux Métropole</a>. With 749,595 inhabitants () and 1,178,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse and Lille. It is the capital of the <a href="Nouvelle-Aquitaine">Nouvelle-Aquitaine</a> region, as well as the <a href="Prefectures%20in%20France">prefecture</a> of the <a href="Gironde">Gironde</a> department. Its inhabitants are called ""Bordelais"" (for men) or ""Bordelaises"" (women). The term "Bordelais" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.

Bordeaux is the world's major wine industry capital. It is home to the world's main wine fair, <a href="Vinexpo">Vinexpo</a>, and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5 billion euros each year. <a href="Bordeaux%20wine">Bordeaux wine</a> has been produced in the region since the 8th century. The historic part of the city is on the <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">UNESCO World Heritage List</a> as "an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble" of the 18th century. After Paris, Bordeaux has the highest number of preserved historical buildings of any city in France.

In historical times, around 300 BC it was the settlement of a <a href="List%20of%20Celtic%20tribes">Celtic tribe</a>, the <a href="Bituriges%20Vivisci">Bituriges Vivisci</a>, who named the town Burdigala, probably of <a href="Aquitanian%20language">Aquitanian</a> origin. The name Bourde is still the name of a river south of the city.

In 107 BC, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Burdigala">Battle of Burdigala</a> was fought by the Romans who were defending the <a href="Allobroges">Allobroges</a>, a <a href="Gauls">Gallic tribe</a> allied to Rome, and the <a href="Tigurini">Tigurini</a> led by <a href="Divico">Divico</a>. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the <a href="Roman%20consul">consul</a> <a href="Lucius%20Cassius%20Longinus%20%28consul%20107%20BC%29">Lucius Cassius Longinus</a>, was killed in the action.

The city fell under <a href="ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> rule around 60 BC, its importance lying in the commerce of <a href="tin">tin</a> and <a href="lead">lead</a> towards Rome. Later it became capital of <a href="Gallia%20Aquitania">Roman Aquitaine</a>, flourishing especially during the <a href="Severan%20dynasty">Severan dynasty</a> (3rd century). In 276 it was sacked by the <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a>. Further ravage was brought by the same Vandals in 409, the <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> in 414 and the <a href="Franks">Franks</a> in 498, beginning a period of obscurity for the city.
In the late 6th century, the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the <a href="Merovingian%20dynasty">Merovingian</a> <a href="Francia">kingdom of the Franks</a>, but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish <a href="Duchy%20of%20Vasconia">Duchy of Vasconia</a>. Around 585, a certain Gallactorius is cited as count of <a href="County%20of%20Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> and fighting the Basques.

The city was plundered by the troops of <a href="Abdul%20Rahman%20Al%20Ghafiqi">Abd er Rahman</a> in 732 after storming the fortified city and overwhelming the Aquitanian garrison. <a href="Odo%20the%20Great">Duke Eudes</a> mustered a force ready to engage the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyads</a> outside Bordeaux, eventually taking on them in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20River%20Garonne">Battle of the River Garonne</a> somewhere near the river Dordogne, described as taking a heavy death toll. After Duke Eudes's defeat, the Aquitanian duke could still save part of its troops and keep his grip on Aquitaine after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tours">Battle of Poitiers</a>.

In 735, the Aquitanian <a href="Hunald">duke Hunald</a> led a rebellion after his father Eudes's death, at which Charles responded by sending an expedition that captured and plundered Bordeaux again, but it was not retained for long. The following year, the Frankish commander descended again over Aquitaine, but clashed in battle with the Aquitanians and left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745, Aquitaine faced yet another expedition by Charles' sons Pepin and Carloman against Hunald, the Aquitanian "princeps" (or duke) strong in Bordeaux. Hunald was defeated, and his son <a href="Waiofar">Waifer</a> replaced him, who in turn confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).

During the last stage of the <a href="Pepin%20the%20Short%23Expansion%20of%20the%20Frankish%20realm">war against Aquitaine</a> (760–768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to King <a href="Pepin%20the%20Short">Pepin the Short</a>'s troops. Next to Bordeaux, Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac ("Frontiacus", "Franciacus") on a hill across the border with the Basques ("Wascones"), where Basque commanders came over to vow loyalty to him (769).

In 778, <a href="Seguin%20I%20of%20Gascony">Seguin (or Sihimin)</a> was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke <a href="Lupo%20II%20of%20Gascony">Lupo</a>, and possibly leading to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Roncevaux%20Pass">Battle of Roncevaux Pass</a> that very year. In 814, Seguin was made Duke of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Vasconia">Vasconia</a>, but he was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress or sympathise with a Basque rebellion. Under the <a href="Carolingian%20dynasty">Carolingians</a>, sometimes the <a href="Count%20of%20Bordeaux">Counts of Bordeaux</a> held the title concomitantly with that of <a href="Duke%20of%20Gascony">Duke of Vasconia</a>. They were meant to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the <a href="Garonne">Garonne</a> from the <a href="Viking">Viking</a>s when the latter appeared c. 844 in the region of Bordeaux. In Autumn 845, count <a href="Seguin%20II%20of%20Gascony">Seguin II</a> marched on the Vikings assaulting Bordeaux and Saintes, but was captured and put to death. No bishops were mentioned during the whole 8th century and part of the 9th in Bordeaux.

From the 12th to the 15th century, Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine">Eléonore</a> of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Aquitaine">Aquitaine</a> with the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in <a href="Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a>, who became, within months of their wedding, King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a>. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the <a href="Bordeaux%20Cathedral">cathedral of St. André</a> was built. It was also the capital of an independent state under <a href="Edward%2C%20the%20Black%20Prince">Edward, the Black Prince</a> (1362–1372), but in the end, after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Castillon">Battle of Castillon</a> (1453), it was annexed by France which extended its territory. The "Château Trompette" (Trumpet Castle) and the "Fort du Hâ", built by <a href="Charles%20VII%20of%20France">Charles VII of France</a>, were the symbols of the new domination, which however deprived the city of its wealth by halting the wine commerce with England.

In 1462, Bordeaux obtained a parliament, but regained importance only in the 16th century when it became the centre of the distribution of sugar and slaves from the <a href="Caribbean">West Indies</a> along with the traditional wine.

Bordeaux adhered to the <a href="Fronde">Fronde</a>, being effectively annexed to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20France">Kingdom of France</a> only in 1653, when the army of <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV</a> entered the city.

The 18th century was the golden age of Bordeaux. Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a> found the town so beautiful he once said: "Take <a href="Versailles%2C%20Yvelines">Versailles</a>, add <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, and you have Bordeaux". <a href="Baron%20Haussmann">Baron Haussmann</a>, a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor <a href="Napoleon%20III%20of%20France">Napoleon III</a> to transform a then still quasi-medieval <a href="Paris">Paris</a> into a "modern" capital that would make France proud.

In 1814, towards the end of the <a href="Peninsula%20war">Peninsula war</a>, the <a href="Duke%20of%20Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a> sent <a href="William%20Beresford%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Beresford">William Beresford</a> with two divisions, who seized Bordeaux without much resistance on 12 March. Bordeaux was largely anti-<a href="Bonapartism">Bonapartist</a> and had a majority that supported the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbons</a>, so the British troops were treated as liberators.

In 1870, at the beginning of the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20war">Franco-Prussian war</a> against <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a>, the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris. This happened again during the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> and again very briefly during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, when it became clear that Paris would soon fall into German hands. However, on the last of these occasions the French capital was soon moved again to <a href="Vichy">Vichy</a>. In May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, <a href="Aristides%20de%20Sousa%20Mendes">Aristides de Sousa Mendes</a>, who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.

From 1940 to 1943, the <a href="Regia%20Marina">Italian Royal Navy</a> ("<a href="Regia%20Marina">Regia Marina</a> Italiana") established <a href="BETASOM">BETASOM</a>, a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a> from this base, which was also a major base for German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s as headquarters of <a href="12th%20U-boat%20Flotilla">12th U-boat Flotilla</a>. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.

Bordeaux is located close to the European <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the river <a href="Garonne">Garonne</a>, and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. In Bordeaux, the <a href="Garonne">Garonne</a> River is accessible to <a href="ocean%20liner">ocean liner</a>s. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.

Bordeaux's climate is usually classified as an <a href="oceanic%20climate">oceanic climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> "Cfb"); however, the summers tend to be warmer and the winters milder than most areas of similar classification. Substantial summer rainfall prevents its climate from being classified as <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean</a>.

Winters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches . The average seasonal winter temperature is , but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter are commonplace, occurring several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is . The <a href="2003%20European%20heat%20wave">summer of 2003</a> set a record with an average temperature of .

The vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.

Bordeaux now has about of <a href="vineyard">vineyard</a>s, 57 <a href="appellations">appellations</a>, 10,000 wine-producing châteaux and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles, Bordeaux produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five "premier cru" (<a href="First%20Growth">first growth</a>) red wines (four from Médoc and one, Château Haut-Brion, from Graves), established by the <a href="Bordeaux%20Wine%20Official%20Classification%20of%201855">Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855</a>:
The first growths are:


Both red and <a href="Wine">white wines</a> are made in Bordeaux. Red Bordeaux is called <a href="claret">claret</a> in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from <a href="Cabernet%20Sauvignon">Cabernet Sauvignon</a>, <a href="Merlot">Merlot</a>, <a href="Cabernet%20Franc">Cabernet Franc</a>, <a href="Petit%20verdot">Petit verdot</a>, <a href="Malbec">Malbec</a>, and, less commonly in recent years, <a href="Carm%C3%A9n%C3%A8re">Carménère</a>.

White Bordeaux is made from <a href="Sauvignon%20blanc">Sauvignon blanc</a>, <a href="S%C3%A9millon">Sémillon</a>, and <a href="Muscadelle">Muscadelle</a>. <a href="Graves%23Sauternes%20AOC%20and%20Barsac%20AOC">Sauternes</a> is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, <a href="dessert%20wine">dessert wine</a>s such as <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20d%27Yquem">Château d'Yquem</a>.

Because of a wine glut (<a href="wine%20lake">wine lake</a>) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and <a href="vine%20pull%20schemes">vine pull schemes</a>, the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.

At the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to <a href="S%C3%A9gol%C3%A8ne%20Royal">Ségolène Royal</a> of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to <a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy">Nicolas Sarkozy</a>, president of the UMP. Then came <a href="Francois%20Bayrou">Francois Bayrou</a> with 22.01%, followed by <a href="Jean-Marie%20Le%20Pen">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a> who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then Ségolène Royal with 25.87%, followed by François Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave Ségolène Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected <a href="President%20of%20the%20Republic">President of the Republic</a> with 53.06% against 46.94% for Ségolène Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round. This is an earthquake in Bordeaux, a city deeply rooted right traditions.

In the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of <a href="Gironde">Gironde</a> switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP <a href="Chantal%20Bourragu%C3%A9">Chantal Bourragué</a> was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate <a href="Beatrice%20Desaigues">Beatrice Desaigues</a>. In the second round, it was <a href="Chantal%20Bourragu%C3%A9">Chantal Bourragué</a> who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea <a href="Alain%20Jupp%C3%A9">Alain Juppé</a> confronted the General Counsel PS Michèle Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Juppé was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for <a href="Mich%C3%A8le%20Delaunay">Michèle Delaunay</a>. In the second round, it was finally Michèle Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Juppé, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency "Mayor" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, Noël Mamère was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, Noël Mamère was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.

In 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Juppé and the <a href="President%20of%20the%20Regional%20Council%20of%20Aquitaine">President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine</a> Socialist <a href="Alain%20Rousset">Alain Rousset</a>. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of Ségolène Royal and <a href="Mich%C3%A8le%20Delaunay">Michèle Delaunay</a> in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Juppé who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.

In the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology José Bové came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district "Southwest", here are the results:

UMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front Gérard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.

Europe’s longest-span <a href="vertical-lift%20bridge">vertical-lift bridge</a>, the <a href="Pont%20Jacques%20Chaban-Delmas">Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas</a>, was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is and can be lifted vertically up to to let tall ships pass underneath. The €160 million bridge was inaugurated by President <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Hollande">François Hollande</a> and Mayor <a href="Alain%20Jupp%C3%A9">Alain Juppé</a> on 16 March 2013.

Bordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is "<a href="Sainte-Catherine%20Street%20%28Bordeaux%29">Rue Sainte-Catherine</a>". This pedestrian-only shopping street has of shops, restaurants and cafés; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. "Rue Sainte-Catherine" starts at "Place de la Victoire" and ends at "Place de la Comédie" by the "Grand Théâtre". The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards "Place de la Comédie" and the nearby "Cours de l'Intendance" is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.

Bordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, "<a href="Arc%20en%20r%C3%AAve">Arc en rêve</a>". Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres and is the home of the <a href="Grand%20Th%C3%A9%C3%A2tre%20de%20Bordeaux">Opéra national de Bordeaux</a>. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.

Bordeaux is an important road and <a href="Interchange%20%28road%29">motorway junction</a>. The city is connected to Paris by the <a href="A10%20autoroute%20%28France%29">A10</a> motorway, with Lyon by the <a href="A89%20autoroute">A89</a>, with Toulouse by the <a href="A62%20autoroute">A62</a>, and with Spain by the <a href="A63%20autoroute">A63</a>. There is a <a href="Beltway">ring road</a> called the "Rocade" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.

Bordeaux has five road bridges that cross the <a href="Garonne">Garonne</a>, the <a href="Pont%20de%20pierre%20%28Bordeaux%29">Pont de pierre</a> built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the <a href="Pont%20Saint%20Jean">Pont Saint Jean</a>, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the <a href="Pont%20d%27Aquitaine">Pont d'Aquitaine</a>, a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the <a href="Pont%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mitterrand">Pont François Mitterrand</a>, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the <a href="Pont%20Jacques-Chaban-Delmas">Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas</a>, was constructed in 2009–2012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a <a href="vertical-lift%20bridge">vertical-lift bridge</a> with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.
Another bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.

Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. <a href="Bike%20lane">Cycle lanes</a> and <a href="bus%20lane">bus lane</a>s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid <a href="Bicycle%20sharing%20system">Bicycle sharing system</a> with automated stations has been established in 2010.

The main <a href="railway%20station">railway station</a>, <a href="Gare%20de%20Bordeaux%20Saint-Jean">Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean</a>, near the center of the city, has 4 million passengers a year. It is served by the French national (<a href="SNCF">SNCF</a>) railway's high speed train, the <a href="TGV">TGV</a>, that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as <a href="Lille">Lille</a>, Brussels, <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, Geneva and London. The <a href="TGV">TGV</a> also serves <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a> and <a href="Irun">Irun</a> from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to <a href="Nantes">Nantes</a>, Nice, <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> and <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a>. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains (<a href="Transport%20express%20r%C3%A9gional">TER</a>) operated by the <a href="SNCF">SNCF</a> to <a href="Arcachon">Arcachon</a>, <a href="Limoges">Limoges</a>, <a href="Agen">Agen</a>, <a href="P%C3%A9rigueux">Périgueux</a>, <a href="Pau%2C%20Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es-Atlantiques">Pau</a>, Le Médoc, Angoulême and <a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a>.

Historically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by <a href="Gustave%20Eiffel">Gustave Eiffel</a>, to bring trains across the river direct into <a href="Gare%20de%20Bordeaux%20Saint-Jean">Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean</a>. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.

The two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has 4 tracks and allows trains to pass at . During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.

Since July 2017, the <a href="LGV%20Sud%20Europe%20Atlantique">LGV Sud Europe Atlantique</a> is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.

Bordeaux is served by an <a href="international%20airport">international airport</a>, <a href="Bordeaux%20%E2%80%93%20M%C3%A9rignac%20Airport">Aéroport de Bordeaux Mérignac</a>, located from the city center in the suburban city of <a href="M%C3%A9rignac%2C%20Gironde">Mérignac</a>.

There had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the <a href="Tramway%20de%20Bordeaux">Tramway de Bordeaux</a> system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology <a href="Ground-level%20power%20supply">(APS)</a>, a new cable-free technology developed by French company <a href="Alstom">Alstom</a> and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with <a href="Limited-access%20road">limited access</a> for cars.

, also known as Bust-a-Move in North America, is a 1994 <a href="Tile-matching%20video%20game">tile-matching</a> <a href="Arcade%20game">arcade</a> <a href="puzzle%20video%20game">puzzle video game</a> for one or two players created by <a href="Taito%20Corporation">Taito Corporation</a>. It is based on Taito's popular 1986 arcade game "<a href="Bubble%20Bobble">Bubble Bobble</a>", featuring characters and themes from that game. Its characteristically <a href="Kawaii">cute</a> <a href="Anime">Japanese animation</a> and music, along with its play mechanics and level designs, made it successful as an arcade title and spawned several sequels and ports to home gaming systems.

The characters and theme of the game are based on the 1986 arcade game "<a href="Bubble%20Bobble">Bubble Bobble</a>". An arrangement of the original "Bubble Bobble" background music is played in the game's end credits.

Two different versions of the original game were released. "Puzzle Bobble" was originally released in Japan only in June 1994 by Taito Corporation, running on Taito's <a href="Taito%20B%20System">B System</a> hardware (with the preliminary title "Bubble Buster"). Then, 6 months later in December, the international Neo Geo version of "Puzzle Bobble" was released. It was almost identical aside from being in <a href="Stereophonic%20sound">stereo</a> and having some different sound effects and translated text.

When set to the US region, the Neo Geo version displays the alternative title "Bust a Move" and features <a href="Winners%20Don%27t%20Use%20Drugs">anti-drugs</a> and <a href="Recycle%20It%2C%20Don%27t%20Trash%20It%21">anti-littering</a> messages in the title sequence. The Bust-a-Move title was used for all subsequent games in the series in the United States and Canada, as well as for some (non-Taito published) console releases in Europe.

At the start of each round, the rectangular playing arena contains a prearranged pattern of colored "bubbles". (These are actually referred to in the translation as "balls"; however, they were clearly intended to be bubbles, since they pop, and are taken from "Bubble Bobble".) At the bottom of the screen, the player controls a device called a "pointer", which aims and fires bubbles up the screen. The color of bubbles fired is randomly generated and chosen from the colors of bubbles still left on the screen.

The fired bubbles travel in straight lines (possibly bouncing off the side walls of the arena), stopping when they touch other bubbles or reach the top of the arena. If a bubble touches identically-colored bubbles, forming a group of three or more, those bubbles—as well as any bubbles hanging from them—are removed from the field of play, and points are awarded.

After every few shots, the "ceiling" of the playing arena drops downwards slightly, along with all the bubbles stuck to it. The number of shots between each drop of the ceiling is influenced by the number of bubble colors remaining. The closer the bubbles get to the bottom of the screen, the faster the music plays and if they cross the line at the bottom then the game is over.

The objective of the game is to clear all the bubbles from the arena without any bubble crossing the bottom line. Bubbles will fire automatically if the player remains idle. After clearing the arena, the next round begins with a new pattern of bubbles to clear. The game consists of 32 levels.

As with many popular arcade games, experienced players (who can complete the game relatively easily) become much more interested in the secondary challenge of obtaining a high score (which involves a lot more skill and strategy). "Puzzle Bobble" caters to this interest very well, featuring an exponential scoring system which allows extremely high scores to be achieved.

"Popped" bubbles (that is, bubbles of the same color which disappear) are worth 10 points each. However, "dropped" bubbles (that is, bubbles that were hanging from popped bubbles), are worth far more: one dropped bubble scores 20 points; two score 40; three score 80. This figure continues doubling for each bubble dropped, up to 17 or more bubbles which scores 1,310,720 points. It is possible to achieve this maximum on most rounds (sometimes twice or more), resulting in a potential total score of 30 million and beyond.

Bonus points are also awarded for completing a round quickly. The maximum 50,000-point bonus is awarded for clearing a round in 5 seconds or less; this bonus then drops down to zero over the next minute, after which no bonus is awarded.

There are no rounds in the two player game. Both players have an arena each (both visible on screen) and an identical arrangement of colored bubbles in each arena. When a player removes a large group (four bubbles or more) some of those removed are transferred to the opponent's arena, usually delaying their efforts to remove all the bubbles from their individual arena. In some versions, the two player game can also be played by one player against a computer opponent.

Reviewing the Super NES version, Mike Weigand of "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" called it "a thoroughly enjoyable and incredibly addicting puzzle game". He considered the two player mode the highlight, but also said that the one player mode provides a solid challenge. "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" gave it a generally negative review, saying it "starts out fun but ultimately lacks intricacy and longevity." They elaborated that in one player mode all the levels feel the same, and that two player matches are over too quickly to build up any excitement. They also criticized the lack of any 3D effects in the graphics.

A reviewer for "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>", while questioning the continued viability of the action puzzle genre, admitted that the game is "very simple and "very" addictive". He remarked that though the 3DO version makes no significant additions, none are called for by a game with such simple enjoyment. "GamePro"s brief review of the 3DO version commented, "The move-and-shoot controls are very responsive and the simple visuals and music are well done. This is one puzzler that isn't a bust."

The simplicity of the concept has led to many clones, both commercial and otherwise. 1996's "<a href="Snood%20%28video%20game%29">Snood</a>" replaced the bubbles with small creatures and has been successful in its own right. Mobile clones include "Bubble Witch Saga" and "<a href="Bubble%20Shooter">Bubble Shooter</a>". "<a href="Frozen%20Bubble">Frozen Bubble</a>" is a <a href="free%20software">free software</a> clone.

Bone

A bone is a <a href="Stiffness">rigid</a> <a href="organ%20%28anatomy%29">organ</a> that constitutes part of the <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> <a href="skeleton">skeleton</a>. Bones support and protect the various organs of the body, produce <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red</a> and <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>s, store <a href="mineral">mineral</a>s, provide structure and support for the body, and enable <a href="animal%20locomotion">mobility</a>. Bones come in a variety of shapes and sizes and have a complex internal and external structure. They are lightweight yet strong and hard, and serve multiple <a href="Function%20%28biology%29">functions</a>.

<a href="Bone%20tissue">Bone tissue</a> is a <a href="hard%20tissue">hard tissue</a>, a type of dense <a href="connective%20tissue">connective tissue</a>. It has a <a href="honeycomb">honeycomb-like</a> <a href="matrix%20%28biology%29">matrix</a> internally, which helps to give the bone rigidity. Bone tissue is made up of different types of <a href="bone%20cell">bone cell</a>s. <a href="Osteoblast">Osteoblast</a>s and <a href="osteocyte">osteocyte</a>s are involved in the formation and <a href="mineralization%20%28biology%29">mineralization</a> of bone; <a href="osteoclast">osteoclast</a>s are involved in the <a href="bone%20resorption">resorption</a> of bone tissue. Modified (flattened) osteoblasts become the lining cells that form a protective layer on the bone surface. The mineralised matrix of bone tissue has an organic component of mainly <a href="collagen">collagen</a> called "ossein" and an inorganic component of <a href="bone%20mineral">bone mineral</a> made up of various salts. Bone tissue is a <a href="mineralized%20tissues">mineralized tissue</a> of two types, <a href="cortical%20bone">cortical</a> and <a href="cancellous%20bone">cancellous bone</a>. Other types of tissue found in bones include <a href="bone%20marrow">bone marrow</a>, <a href="endosteum">endosteum</a>, <a href="periosteum">periosteum</a>, <a href="nerve">nerve</a>s, <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a>s and <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a>.

In the <a href="human%20body">human body</a> at birth, there are over 270 bones, but many of these fuse together during development, leaving a total of 206 separate bones in the adult, not counting numerous small <a href="sesamoid%20bone">sesamoid bone</a>s. The largest bone in the body is the <a href="femur">femur</a> or thigh-bone, and the smallest is the <a href="stapes">stapes</a> in the <a href="middle%20ear">middle ear</a>.

The <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word for bone is "os", hence the many terms that use it as a prefix – such as osseous and <a href="osteopathy">osteopathy</a>.

Bone is not uniformly solid, but includes a tough <a href="matrix%20%28biology%29">matrix</a>. This matrix makes up about 30% of the bone and the other 70% is of salts that give strength to it. The matrix is made up of between 90 and 95% <a href="collagen">collagen</a> fibers, and the remainder is <a href="ground%20substance">ground substance</a>. The primary tissue of bone, <a href="bone%20tissue">bone tissue</a> (osseous tissue), is relatively <a href="Rockwell%20scale">hard</a> and lightweight. Its matrix is mostly made up of a composite material incorporating the inorganic mineral <a href="calcium%20phosphate">calcium phosphate</a> in the chemical arrangement termed calcium <a href="hydroxylapatite">hydroxylapatite</a> (this is the <a href="bone%20mineral">bone mineral</a> that gives bones their rigidity) and <a href="collagen">collagen</a>, an elastic protein which improves fracture resistance. The collagen of bone is known as ossein. Bone is formed by the hardening of this matrix around entrapped cells. When these cells become entrapped from osteoblasts they become osteocytes.

The hard outer layer of bones is composed of <a href="cortical%20bone">cortical bone</a> also called compact bone. Cortical referring to the outer (cortex) layer. The hard outer layer gives bone its smooth, white, and solid appearance, and accounts for 80% of the total bone mass of an adult human <a href="skeleton">skeleton</a>. Cortical bone consists of multiple microscopic columns, each called an <a href="osteon">osteon</a>. Each column is multiple layers of <a href="osteoblast">osteoblast</a>s and <a href="osteocyte">osteocyte</a>s around a central canal called the <a href="haversian%20canal">haversian canal</a>. <a href="Volkmann%27s%20canal">Volkmann's canal</a>s at right angles connect the osteons together. The columns are metabolically active, and as bone is reabsorbed and created the nature and location of the cells within the osteon will change. Cortical bone is covered by a <a href="periosteum">periosteum</a> on its outer surface, and an <a href="endosteum">endosteum</a> on its inner surface. The endosteum is the boundary between the cortical bone and the cancellous bone. 

<a href="Cancellous%20bone">Cancellous bone</a> also known as trabecular or spongy bone tissue is the internal tissue of the skeletal bone and is an open cell <a href="Porosity">porous</a> network. Thin formations of <a href="osteoblast">osteoblast</a>s covered in endosteum create an irregular network of spaces, known as trabeculae. Within these spaces are <a href="bone%20marrow">bone marrow</a> and <a href="hematopoietic%20stem%20cell">hematopoietic stem cell</a>s that give rise to <a href="platelet">platelet</a>s, <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s and <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>s. Trabecular marrow is composed of a network of rod- and plate-like elements that make the overall organ lighter and allow room for blood vessels and marrow. Trabecular bone accounts for the remaining 20% of total bone mass but has nearly ten times the surface area of compact bone.

<a href="Bone%20marrow">Bone marrow</a>, also known as <a href="myeloid%20tissue">myeloid tissue</a> in red bone marrow, can be found in almost any bone that holds <a href="cancellous%20tissue">cancellous tissue</a>. In <a href="neonates">newborns</a>, all such bones are filled exclusively with red marrow or <a href="hematopoietic">hematopoietic</a> marrow, but as the child ages the hematopoietic fraction decreases in quantity and the fatty/ yellow fraction called <a href="Marrow%20Adipose%20Tissue">marrow adipose tissue (MAT)</a> increases in quantity. In adults, red marrow is mostly found in the bone marrow of the femur, the ribs, the vertebrae and <a href="pelvic%20bones">pelvic bones</a>.

Bone is a metabolically active tissue composed of several types of cells. These cells include <a href="osteoblast">osteoblast</a>s, which are involved in the creation and <a href="mineralized%20tissue">mineralization</a> of bone tissue, <a href="osteocytes">osteocytes</a>, and <a href="osteoclast">osteoclast</a>s, which are involved in the reabsorption of bone tissue. Osteoblasts and osteocytes are derived from <a href="osteoprogenitor">osteoprogenitor</a> cells, but <a href="osteoclast">osteoclast</a>s are derived from the same cells that differentiate to form <a href="macrophage">macrophage</a>s and <a href="monocyte">monocyte</a>s. Within the marrow of the bone there are also <a href="hematopoietic%20stem%20cell">hematopoietic stem cell</a>s. These cells give rise to other cells, including <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>s, <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s, and <a href="platelet">platelet</a>s.

Bones consist of living cells embedded in a mineralized organic matrix. This matrix consists of organic components, mainly <a href="Collagen%23Types%20of%20collagen">Type I collagen</a> – "organic" referring to materials produced as a result of the human body – and inorganic components, primarily <a href="hydroxyapatite">hydroxyapatite</a> and other salts of <a href="calcium">calcium</a> and <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a>. Above 30% of the acellular part of bone consists of the organic components, and 70% of salts. The <a href="collagen">collagen</a> fibers give bone its <a href="ultimate%20tensile%20strength">tensile strength</a>, and the interspersed crystals of <a href="hydroxyapatite">hydroxyapatite</a> give bone its <a href="compressive%20strength">compressive strength</a>. These effects are <a href="synergy">synergistic</a>.

The inorganic composition of bone (<a href="bone%20mineral">bone mineral</a>) is primarily formed from salts of <a href="calcium">calcium</a> and <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a>, the major salt being <a href="hydroxyapatite">hydroxyapatite</a> (Ca(PO)(OH)). The exact composition of the matrix may change over time and with nutrition, with the ratio of <a href="calcium">calcium</a> to <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> varying between 1.3 and 2.0 (per weight), and trace minerals such as <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, <a href="sodium">sodium</a>, <a href="potassium">potassium</a> and <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a> also being found.
Type I collagen composes 90–95% of the organic matrix, with remainder of the matrix being a homogenous liquid called <a href="ground%20substance">ground substance</a> consisting of <a href="proteoglycan">proteoglycan</a>s such as <a href="hyaluronic%20acid">hyaluronic acid</a> and <a href="chondroitin%20sulfate">chondroitin sulfate</a> , as well as non-collagenous proteins such as <a href="osteocalcin">osteocalcin</a>, <a href="osteopontin">osteopontin</a> or <a href="bone%20sialoprotein">bone sialoprotein</a> . Collagen consists of strands of repeating units, which give bone tensile strength, and are arranged in an overlapping fashion that prevents shear stress. The function of ground substance is not fully known. Two types of bone can be identified microscopically according to the arrangement of collagen: woven and lamellar.
Woven bone is produced when osteoblasts produce osteoid rapidly, which occurs initially in all <a href="fetus">fetal</a> bones, but is later replaced by more resilient lamellar bone. In adults woven bone is created after <a href="Bone%20fracture">fractures</a> or in <a href="Paget%27s%20disease%20of%20bone">Paget's disease</a>. Woven bone is weaker, with a smaller number of randomly oriented collagen fibers, but forms quickly; it is for this appearance of the fibrous matrix that the bone is termed "woven". It is soon replaced by lamellar bone, which is highly organized in <a href="concentric">concentric</a> sheets with a much lower proportion of osteocytes to surrounding tissue. Lamellar bone, which makes its first appearance in humans in the <a href="fetus">fetus</a> during the third trimester, is stronger and filled with many collagen fibers parallel to other fibers in the same layer (these parallel columns are called osteons). In <a href="cross%20section%20%28geometry%29">cross-section</a>, the fibers run in opposite directions in alternating layers, much like in <a href="plywood">plywood</a>, assisting in the bone's ability to resist <a href="torsion%20%28mechanics%29">torsion</a> forces. After a fracture, woven bone forms initially and is gradually replaced by lamellar bone during a process known as "bony substitution." Compared to woven bone, lamellar bone formation takes place more slowly. The orderly deposition of collagen fibers restricts the formation of osteoid to about 1 to 2 <a href="Micrometre">µm</a> per day. Lamellar bone also requires a relatively flat surface to lay the collagen fibers in parallel or concentric layers.
The extracellular matrix of bone is laid down by <a href="osteoblast">osteoblast</a>s, which secrete both collagen and ground substance. These synthesise collagen within the cell, and then secrete collagen fibrils. The collagen fibres rapidly <a href="polymer">polymer</a>ise to form collagen strands. At this stage they are not yet mineralised, and are called "osteoid". Around the strands calcium and phosphate <a href="Precipitation%20%28chemistry%29">precipitate</a> on the surface of these strands, within a days to weeks becoming crystals of hydroxyapatite.

In order to mineralise the bone, the osteoblasts secrete <a href="vesicle%20%28biology%29">vesicles</a> containing <a href="alkaline%20phosphatase">alkaline phosphatase</a>. This cleaves the phosphate groups and acts as the foci for calcium and phosphate deposition. The vesicles then rupture and act as a centre for crystals to grow on. More particularly, bone mineral is formed from globular and plate structures.

There are five types of bones in the human body: long, short, flat, irregular, and sesamoid.

In the study of <a href="anatomy">anatomy</a>, anatomists use a number of <a href="Anatomical%20terminology">anatomical terms</a> to describe the appearance, shape and function of bones. Other anatomical terms are also used to describe <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location">the location of bones</a>. Like other anatomical terms, many of these derive from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>. Some anatomists still use Latin to refer to bones. The term "osseous", and the prefix "osteo-", referring to things related to bone, are still used commonly today.

Some examples of terms used to describe bones include the term "foramen" to describe a hole through which something passes, and a "canal" or "meatus" to describe a tunnel-like structure. A protrusion from a bone can be called a number of terms, including a "condyle", "crest", "spine", "eminence", "tubercle" or "tuberosity", depending on the protrusion's shape and location. In general, <a href="long%20bone">long bone</a>s are said to have a "head", "neck", and "body".

When two bones join together, they are said to "articulate". If the two bones have a fibrous connection and are relatively immobile, then the joint is called a "suture".

The formation of bone is called <a href="ossification">ossification</a>. During the <a href="prenatal%20development">fetal stage of development</a> this occurs by two processes: <a href="intramembranous%20ossification">intramembranous ossification</a> and <a href="endochondral%20ossification">endochondral ossification</a>. Intramembranous ossification involves the formation of bone from <a href="connective%20tissue">connective tissue</a> whereas endochondral ossification involves the formation of bone from <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a>.

Intramembranous ossification mainly occurs during formation of the flat bones of the <a href="skull">skull</a> but also the mandible, maxilla, and clavicles; the bone is formed from connective tissue such as <a href="mesenchyme">mesenchyme</a> tissue rather than from cartilage. The process includes: the development of the <a href="ossification%20center">ossification center</a>, <a href="calcification">calcification</a>, trabeculae formation and the development of the periosteum.

Endochondral ossification occurs in long bones and most other bones in the body; it involves the development of bone from cartilage. This process includes the development of a cartilage model, its growth and development, development of the <a href="ossification%20center">primary and secondary ossification centers</a>, and the formation of articular cartilage and the <a href="epiphyseal%20plate">epiphyseal plate</a>s.

Endochondral ossification begins with points in the cartilage called "primary ossification centers." They mostly appear during fetal development, though a few short bones begin their primary ossification after <a href="birth">birth</a>. They are responsible for the formation of the diaphyses of long bones, short bones and certain parts of irregular bones. Secondary ossification occurs after birth, and forms the <a href="Epiphysis">epiphyses</a> of long bones and the extremities of irregular and flat bones. The diaphysis and both epiphyses of a long bone are separated by a growing zone of cartilage (the <a href="epiphyseal%20plate">epiphyseal plate</a>). At skeletal maturity (18 to 25 years of age), all of the cartilage is replaced by bone, fusing the diaphysis and both epiphyses together (epiphyseal closure). In the upper limbs, only the diaphyses of the long bones and scapula are ossified. The epiphyses, carpal bones, coracoid process, medial border of the scapula, and acromion are still cartilaginous.

The following steps are followed in the conversion of cartilage to bone:

Bones have a variety of functions:

Bones serve a variety of mechanical functions. Together the bones in the body form the <a href="skeleton">skeleton</a>. They provide a frame to keep the body supported, and an attachment point for <a href="skeletal%20muscle">skeletal muscle</a>s, <a href="tendon">tendon</a>s, <a href="ligament">ligament</a>s and <a href="joint">joint</a>s, which function together to generate and transfer forces so that individual body parts or the whole body can be manipulated in three-dimensional space (the interaction between bone and muscle is studied in <a href="biomechanics">biomechanics</a>).

Bones protect internal organs, such as the <a href="skull">skull</a> protecting the <a href="brain">brain</a> or the <a href="ribs">ribs</a> protecting the <a href="heart">heart</a> and <a href="lungs">lungs</a>. Because of the way that bone is formed, bone has a high <a href="compressive%20strength">compressive strength</a> of about 170 <a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">MPa</a> (1800 <a href="kgf">kgf</a>/cm²), poor <a href="tensile%20strength">tensile strength</a> of 104–121 <a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">MPa</a>, and a very low <a href="shear%20stress">shear stress</a> strength (51.6 <a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">MPa</a>). This means that bone resists pushing(compressional) stress well, resist pulling(tensional) stress less well, but only poorly resists shear stress (such as due to torsional loads). While bone is essentially <a href="Brittleness">brittle</a>, bone does have a significant degree of <a href="elasticity%20%28physics%29">elasticity</a>, contributed chiefly by <a href="collagen">collagen</a>. The macroscopic <a href="yield%20%28engineering%29">yield</a> strength of <a href="cancellous%20bone">cancellous bone</a> has been investigated using high resolution computer models.

Mechanically, bones also have a special role in <a href="Hearing%20%28sense%29">hearing</a>. The <a href="ossicle">ossicle</a>s are three small bones in the <a href="middle%20ear">middle ear</a> which are involved in sound transduction.

The cancellous part of bones contain <a href="bone%20marrow">bone marrow</a>. Bone marrow produces blood cells in a process called <a href="hematopoiesis">hematopoiesis</a>. Blood cells that are created in bone marrow include <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s, <a href="platelet">platelet</a>s and <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>s. Progenitor cells such as the <a href="hematopoietic%20stem%20cell">hematopoietic stem cell</a> divide in a process called <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a> to produce precursor cells. These include precursors which eventually give rise to <a href="white%20blood%20cells">white blood cells</a>, and <a href="erythroblast">erythroblast</a>s which give rise to red blood cells. Unlike red and white blood cells, created by mitosis, platelets are shed from very large cells called <a href="megakaryocyte">megakaryocyte</a>s. This process of progressive differentiation occurs within the bone marrow. After the cells are matured, they enter the <a href="circulatory%20system">circulation</a>. Every day, over 2.5 billion red blood cells and platelets, and 50–100 billion <a href="granulocyte">granulocyte</a>s are produced in this way.

As well as creating cells, bone marrow is also one of the major sites where defective or aged red blood cells are destroyed.


Bone is constantly being created and replaced in a process known as <a href="Bone%20remodeling">remodeling</a>. This ongoing turnover of bone is a process of resorption followed by replacement of bone with little change in shape. This is accomplished through osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Cells are stimulated by a variety of <a href="paracrine">signals</a>, and together referred to as a remodeling unit. Approximately 10% of the skeletal mass of an adult is remodelled each year. The purpose of remodeling is to regulate <a href="calcium%20homeostasis">calcium homeostasis</a>, repair <a href="Microdamage%20in%20bone">microdamaged bones</a> from everyday stress, and to shape the skeleton during growth.. Repeated stress, such as weight-bearing <a href="exercise">exercise</a> or bone healing, results in the bone thickening at the points of maximum stress (<a href="Wolff%27s%20law">Wolff's law</a>). It has been hypothesized that this is a result of bone's <a href="piezoelectricity">piezoelectric</a> properties, which cause bone to generate small electrical potentials under stress.

The action of osteoblasts and osteoclasts are controlled by a number of chemical <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s that either promote or inhibit the activity of the bone remodeling cells, controlling the rate at which bone is made, destroyed, or changed in shape. The cells also use <a href="paracrine%20signalling">paracrine signalling</a> to control the activity of each other. For example, the rate at which osteoclasts resorb bone is inhibited by <a href="calcitonin">calcitonin</a> and <a href="osteoprotegerin">osteoprotegerin</a>. Calcitonin is produced by <a href="parafollicular%20cell">parafollicular cell</a>s in the <a href="thyroid%20gland">thyroid gland</a>, and can bind to receptors on osteoclasts to directly inhibit osteoclast activity. Osteoprotegerin is secreted by osteoblasts and is able to bind RANK-L, inhibiting osteoclast stimulation.

Osteoblasts can also be stimulated to increase bone mass through increased secretion of <a href="osteoid">osteoid</a> and by <a href="Enzyme%20inhibitor">inhibiting</a> the ability of osteoclasts to break down <a href="osseous%20tissue">osseous tissue</a>. Increased secretion of osteoid is stimulated by the secretion of <a href="growth%20hormone">growth hormone</a> by the <a href="pituitary">pituitary</a>, <a href="thyroid%20hormone">thyroid hormone</a> and the sex hormones (<a href="estrogen">estrogen</a>s and <a href="androgen">androgen</a>s). These hormones also promote increased secretion of osteoprotegerin. Osteoblasts can also be induced to secrete a number of <a href="cytokine">cytokine</a>s that promote reabsorbtion of bone by stimulating osteoclast activity and differentiation from progenitor cells. <a href="Vitamin%20D">Vitamin D</a>, <a href="parathyroid%20hormone">parathyroid hormone</a> and stimulation from osteocytes induce osteoblasts to increase secretion of RANK-<a href="ligand">ligand</a> and <a href="interleukin%206">interleukin 6</a>, which cytokines then stimulate increased reabsorption of bone by osteoclasts. These same compounds also increase secretion of <a href="macrophage%20colony-stimulating%20factor">macrophage colony-stimulating factor</a> by osteoblasts, which promotes the differentiation of progenitor cells into osteoclasts, and decrease secretion of osteoprotegerin.

Bone volume is determined by the rates of bone formation and bone resorption. Recent research has suggested that certain growth factors may work to locally alter bone formation by increasing osteoblast activity. Numerous bone-derived growth factors have been isolated and classified via bone cultures. These factors include insulin-like growth factors I and II, transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and bone morphogenetic proteins. Evidence suggests that bone cells produce growth factors for extracellular storage in the bone matrix. The release of these growth factors from the bone matrix could cause the proliferation of osteoblast precursors. Essentially, bone growth factors may act as potential determinants of local bone formation. Research has suggested that cancellous bone volume in postemenopausal osteoporosis may be determined by the relationship between the total bone forming surface and the percent of surface resorption.

A number of diseases can affect bone, including arthritis, fractures, infections, osteoporosis and tumours. Conditions relating to bone can be managed by a variety of doctors, including <a href="Rheumatology">rheumatologists</a> for joints, and <a href="orthopedic">orthopedic</a> surgeons, who may conduct surgery to fix broken bones. Other doctors, such as <a href="rehabilitation%20medicine">rehabilitation specialists</a> may be involved in recovery, <a href="radiology">radiologists</a> in interpreting the findings on imaging, and <a href="pathologist">pathologist</a>s in investigating the cause of the disease, and <a href="family%20doctor">family doctor</a>s may play a role in preventing complications of bone disease such as osteoporosis.

When a doctor sees a patient, a history and exam will be taken. Bones are then often imaged, called <a href="radiography">radiography</a>. This might include <a href="ultrasound">ultrasound</a> <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>, <a href="CT%20scan">CT scan</a>, <a href="MRI%20scan">MRI scan</a> and other imaging such as a <a href="Bone%20scan">Bone scan</a>, which may be used to investigate cancer. Other tests such as a blood test for autoimmune markers may be taken, or a <a href="synovial%20fluid">synovial fluid</a> aspirate may be taken.

In normal bone, <a href="Bone%20fracture">fractures</a> occur when there is significant force applied, or repetitive trauma over a long time. Fractures can also occur when a bone is weakened, such as with osteoporosis, or when there is a structural problem, such as when the bone remodels excessively (such as <a href="Paget%27s%20disease%20of%20bone">Paget's disease</a>) or is the site of the growth of cancer. Common fractures include <a href="wrist%20fracture">wrist fracture</a>s and <a href="hip%20fracture">hip fracture</a>s, associated with <a href="osteoporosis">osteoporosis</a>, <a href="vertebral%20fracture">vertebral fracture</a>s associated with high-energy trauma and cancer, and fractures of long-bones. Not all fractures are painful. When serious, depending on the fractures type and location, complications may include <a href="flail%20chest">flail chest</a>, <a href="compartment%20syndrome">compartment syndrome</a>s or <a href="fat%20embolism">fat embolism</a>.
<a href="Compound%20fracture">Compound fracture</a>s involve the bone's penetration through the skin. Some complex fractures can be treated by the use of <a href="bone%20grafting">bone grafting</a> procedures that replace missing bone portions.

Fractures and their underlying causes can be investigated by <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s, <a href="CT%20scans">CT scans</a> and <a href="MRI">MRI</a>s. Fractures are described by their location and shape, and several classification systems exist, depending on the location of the fracture. A common long bone fracture in children is a <a href="Salter%E2%80%93Harris%20fracture">Salter–Harris fracture</a>. When fractures are managed, pain relief is often given, and the fractured area is often immobilised. This is to promote <a href="bone%20healing">bone healing</a>. In addition, surgical measures such as <a href="internal%20fixation">internal fixation</a> may be used. Because of the immobilisation, people with fractures are often advised to undergo <a href="Physical%20medicine%20and%20rehabilitation">rehabilitation</a>.

There are several types of tumour that can affect bone; examples of benign <a href="bone%20tumour">bone tumour</a>s include <a href="osteoma">osteoma</a>, <a href="osteoid%20osteoma">osteoid osteoma</a>, <a href="osteochondroma">osteochondroma</a>, <a href="osteoblastoma">osteoblastoma</a>, <a href="enchondroma">enchondroma</a>, <a href="giant%20cell%20tumor%20of%20bone">giant cell tumor of bone</a>, and <a href="aneurysmal%20bone%20cyst">aneurysmal bone cyst</a>.

<a href="Cancer">Cancer</a> can arise in bone tissue, and bones are also a common site for other cancers to spread (<a href="metastasise">metastasise</a>) to. Cancers that arise in bone are called "primary" cancers, although such cancers are rare. Metastases within bone are "secondary" cancers, with the most common being <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a>, <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a>, <a href="prostate%20cancer">prostate cancer</a>, <a href="thyroid%20cancer">thyroid cancer</a>, and <a href="kidney%20cancer">kidney cancer</a>. Secondary cancers that affect bone can either destroy bone (called a "<a href="lytic%20cycle">lytic</a>" cancer) or create bone (a "<a href="sclerosis%20%28medicine%29">sclerotic</a>" cancer). Cancers of the bone marrow inside the bone can also affect bone tissue, examples including <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a> and <a href="multiple%20myeloma">multiple myeloma</a>. Bone may also be affected by cancers in other parts of the body. Cancers in other parts of the body may release <a href="parathyroid%20hormone">parathyroid hormone</a> or <a href="parathyroid%20hormone-related%20peptide">parathyroid hormone-related peptide</a>. This increases bone reabsorption, and can lead to bone fractures.

Bone tissue that is destroyed or altered as a result of cancers is distorted, weakened, and more prone to fracture. This may lead to compression of the <a href="spinal%20cord">spinal cord</a>, destruction of the marrow resulting in <a href="bruising">bruising</a>, <a href="bleeding">bleeding</a> and <a href="immunosuppression">immunosuppression</a>, and is one cause of bone pain. If the cancer is metastatic, then there might be other symptoms depending on the site of the original cancer. Some bone cancers can also be felt.

Cancers of the bone are managed according to their type, their <a href="cancer%20staging">stage</a>, prognosis, and what symptoms they cause. Many primary cancers of bone are treated with <a href="radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a>. Cancers of bone marrow may be treated with <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>, and other forms of targeted therapy such as <a href="immunotherapy">immunotherapy</a> may be used. <a href="Palliative%20care">Palliative care</a>, which focuses on maximising a person's <a href="quality%20of%20life">quality of life</a>, may play a role in management, particularly if the likelihood of <a href="5-year%20survival">survival within five years</a> is poor.


Osteoporosis is a disease of bone where there is reduced <a href="bone%20mineral%20density">bone mineral density</a>, increasing the likelihood of <a href="bone%20fracture">fractures</a>. Osteoporosis is defined in women by the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> as a bone mineral density of 2.5 <a href="standard%20deviation">standard deviation</a>s below peak bone mass, relative to the age and sex-matched average. This density is measured using <a href="dual%20energy%20X-ray%20absorptiometry">dual energy X-ray absorptiometry</a> (DEXA), with the term "established osteoporosis" including the presence of a <a href="fragility%20fracture">fragility fracture</a>. Osteoporosis is most common in women after <a href="menopause">menopause</a>, when it is called "postmenopausal osteoporosis", but may develop in men and premenopausal women in the presence of particular hormonal disorders and other <a href="Chronic%20%28medicine%29">chronic</a> diseases or as a result of <a href="tobacco%20smoking">smoking</a> and <a href="medications">medications</a>, specifically <a href="glucocorticoid">glucocorticoid</a>s. Osteoporosis usually has no symptoms until a fracture occurs. For this reason, DEXA scans are often done in people with one or more risk factors, who have developed osteoporosis and be at risk of fracture.

Osteoporosis treatment includes advice to stop smoking, decrease alcohol consumption, exercise regularly, and have a healthy diet. <a href="Calcium">Calcium</a> supplements may also be advised, as may <a href="Vitamin%20D">Vitamin D</a>. When medication is used, it may include <a href="bisphosphonate">bisphosphonate</a>s, <a href="Strontium%20ranelate">Strontium ranelate</a>, and <a href="hormone%20replacement%20therapy">hormone replacement therapy</a>.

<a href="Osteopathic%20medicine">Osteopathic medicine</a> is a school of medical thought originally developed based on the idea of the link between the musculoskeletal system and overall health, but now very similar to mainstream medicine. , over 77,000 physicians <a href="Osteopathic%20medicine%20in%20the%20United%20States">in the United States</a> are trained in Osteopathic medicine colleges.

The study of bones and teeth is referred to as <a href="osteology">osteology</a>. It is frequently used in <a href="anthropology">anthropology</a>, <a href="archeology">archeology</a> and <a href="forensics">forensic science</a> for a variety of tasks.

Bretwalda

Bretwalda (also brytenwalda and bretenanwealda, sometimes capitalized) is an <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> word. The first record comes from the late 9th-century "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>". It is given to some of the rulers of <a href="History%20of%20Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon kingdoms</a> from the 5th century onwards who had achieved overlordship of some or all of the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. It is unclear whether the word dates back to the 5th century and was used by the kings themselves or whether it is a later, 9th-century, invention. The term "bretwalda" also appears in a 10th-century charter of <a href="Athelstan%20of%20England">Æthelstan</a>. The literal meaning of the word is disputed and may translate to either 'wide-ruler' or 'Britain-ruler'.

The rulers of <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a> were generally the most powerful of the Anglo-Saxon kings from the mid 7th century to the early 9th century but are not accorded the title of "bretwalda" by the "Chronicle", which had an anti-Mercian bias. The "<a href="Annals%20of%20Wales">Annals of Wales</a>" continued to recognise the <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Northumbria">kings of Northumbria</a> as "Kings of the Saxons" until the death of <a href="Osred%20I%20of%20Northumbria">Osred I of Northumbria</a> in 716.





The first syllable of the term "bretwalda" may be related to <a href="Britons%20%28historical%29">"Briton"</a> or "Britain". The second element is taken to mean 'ruler' or '<a href="sovereign">sovereign</a>', though is more literally 'wielder'. Thus, this interpretation would mean 'sovereign of Britain' or 'wielder of Britain'. The word may be a <a href="Compound%20%28linguistics%29">compound</a> containing the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> adjective "brytten" (from the verb "breotan" meaning 'to break' or 'to disperse'), an element also found in the terms "bryten rice" ('kingdom'), "bryten-grund" ('the wide expanse of the earth') and "bryten cyning" ('king whose authority was widely extended'). Though the origin is ambiguous, the draughtsman of the charter issued by <a href="%C3%86thelstan">Æthelstan</a> used the term in a way that can only mean 'wide-ruler'.

The latter etymology was first suggested by <a href="John%20Mitchell%20Kemble">John Mitchell Kemble</a> who alluded that "of six manuscripts in which this passage occurs, one only reads "Bretwalda": of the remaining five, four have "Bryten-walda" or "-wealda", and one "Breten-anweald", which is precisely synonymous with Brytenwealda"; that Æthelstan was called "brytenwealda ealles ðyses ealondes", which Kemble translates as 'ruler of all these islands'; and that "bryten-" is a common prefix to words meaning 'wide or general dispersion' and that the similarity to the word "bretwealh" ('Briton') is "merely accidental".

The first recorded use of the term "Bretwalda" comes from a <a href="Wessex">West Saxon</a> chronicle of the late 9th century that applied the term to <a href="Egbert%20of%20Wessex">Ecgberht</a>, who ruled Wessex from 802 to 839. The chronicler also wrote down the names of seven kings that <a href="Bede">Bede</a> listed in his "<a href="Historia%20ecclesiastica%20gentis%20Anglorum">Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum</a>" in 731. All subsequent manuscripts of the "Chronicle" use the term "Brytenwalda", which may have represented the original term or derived from a common error.

There is no evidence that the term was a title that had any practical use, with implications of formal rights, powers and office, or even that it had any existence before the 9th-century. Bede wrote in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and never used the term and his list of kings holding "imperium" should be treated with caution, not least in that he overlooks kings such as <a href="Penda%20of%20Mercia">Penda of Mercia</a>, who clearly held some kind of dominance during his reign. Similarly, in his list of bretwaldas, the West Saxon chronicler ignored such <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Mercia">Mercian kings</a> as <a href="Offa%20of%20Mercia">Offa</a>.

The use of the term "Bretwalda" was the attempt by a West Saxon chronicler to make some claim of <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Wessex">West Saxon kings</a> to the whole of Great Britain. The concept of the overlordship of the whole of Britain was at least recognised in the period, whatever was meant by the term. Quite possibly it was a survival of a Roman concept of "Britain": it is significant that, while the hyperbolic inscriptions on coins and titles in <a href="charters">charters</a> often included the title "rex Britanniae", when England was unified the title used was "rex Angulsaxonum", ('king of the Anglo-Saxons'.)

For some time, the existence of the word "bretwalda" in the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", which was based in part on the list given by <a href="Bede">Bede</a> in his "Historia Ecclesiastica", led historians to think that there was perhaps a "title" held by Anglo-Saxon overlords. This was particularly attractive as it would lay the foundations for the establishment of an English monarchy. The 20th-century historian <a href="Frank%20Stenton">Frank Stenton</a> said of the Anglo-Saxon chronicler that "his inaccuracy is more than compensated by his preservation of the English title applied to these outstanding kings". He argued that the term "bretwalda" "falls into line with the other evidence which points to the Germanic origin of the earliest English institutions".

Over the later 20th century, this assumption was increasingly challenged. <a href="Patrick%20Wormald">Patrick Wormald</a> interpreted it as "less an objectively realized office than a subjectively perceived status" and emphasised the partiality of its usage in favour of <a href="Southumbrian">Southumbrian</a> rulers. In 1991, Steven Fanning argued that "it is unlikely that the term ever existed as a title or was in common usage in Anglo-Saxon England". The fact that Bede never mentioned a special title for the kings in his list implies that he was unaware of one. In 1995, <a href="Simon%20Keynes">Simon Keynes</a> observed that "if Bede's concept of the Southumbrian overlord, and the chronicler's concept of the 'Bretwalda', are to be regarded as artificial constructs, which have no validity outside the context of the literary works in which they appear, we are released from the assumptions about political development which they seem to involve... we might ask whether kings in the eighth and ninth centuries were quite so obsessed with the establishment of a pan-Southumbrian state".

Modern interpretations view the concept of "bretwalda" overlordship as complex and an important indicator of how a 9th-century chronicler interpreted history and attempted to insert the increasingly powerful Saxon kings into that history.

A complex array of dominance and subservience existed during the Anglo-Saxon period. A king who used <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Charters">charters</a> to grant land in another kingdom indicated such a relationship. If a king held sway over a large kingdom, such as when the Mercians dominated the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20East%20Anglia">East Anglians</a>, the relationship would have been more equal than in the case of the Mercian dominance of the <a href="Hwicce">Hwicce</a>, which was a comparatively small kingdom. Mercia was arguably the most powerful Anglo-Saxon kingdom for much of the late 7th though 8th centuries, though Mercian kings are missing from the two main "lists". For Bede, Mercia was a traditional enemy of his native Northumbria and he regarded powerful kings such as the pagan Penda as standing in the way of the Christian conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. Bede omits them from his list, even though it is evident that Penda held a considerable degree of power. Similarly powerful Mercia kings such as Offa are missed out of the West Saxon "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", which sought to demonstrate the legitimacy of their kings to rule over other Anglo-Saxon peoples.

<doc id="4101" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4101" title="Brouwer fixed-point theorem">
Brouwer fixed-point theorem

Brouwer's fixed-point theorem is a <a href="fixed-point%20theorem">fixed-point theorem</a> in <a href="topology">topology</a>, named after <a href="Luitzen%20Egbertus%20Jan%20Brouwer">Luitzen Brouwer</a>. It states that for any <a href="continuous%20function">continuous function</a> formula_1 mapping a <a href="compactness">compact</a> <a href="convex%20set">convex set</a> to itself there is a point formula_2 such that formula_3. The simplest forms of Brouwer's theorem are for continuous functions formula_1 from a closed interval formula_5 in the real numbers to itself or from a closed <a href="Disk%20%28mathematics%29">disk</a> formula_6 to itself. A more general form than the latter is for continuous functions from a convex compact subset formula_7 of <a href="Euclidean%20space">Euclidean space</a> to itself.

Among hundreds of fixed-point theorems, Brouwer's is particularly well known, due in part to its use across numerous fields of mathematics.
In its original field, this result is one of the key theorems characterizing the topology of Euclidean spaces, along with the <a href="Jordan%20curve%20theorem">Jordan curve theorem</a>, the <a href="hairy%20ball%20theorem">hairy ball theorem</a> and the <a href="Borsuk%E2%80%93Ulam%20theorem">Borsuk–Ulam theorem</a>.
This gives it a place among the fundamental theorems of topology. The theorem is also used for proving deep results about <a href="differential%20equation">differential equation</a>s and is covered in most introductory courses on <a href="differential%20geometry">differential geometry</a>.
It appears in unlikely fields such as <a href="game%20theory">game theory</a>. In economics, Brouwer's fixed-point theorem and its extension, the <a href="Kakutani%20fixed-point%20theorem">Kakutani fixed-point theorem</a>, play a central role in the <a href="Arrow%E2%80%93Debreu%20model">proof of existence</a> of <a href="general%20equilibrium">general equilibrium</a> in market economies as developed in the 1950s by economics Nobel prize winners <a href="Kenneth%20Arrow">Kenneth Arrow</a> and <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Debreu">Gérard Debreu</a>.

The theorem was first studied in view of work on differential equations by the French mathematicians around <a href="Henri%20Poincar%C3%A9">Poincaré</a> and <a href="Charles%20%C3%89mile%20Picard">Picard</a>.
Proving results such as the <a href="Poincar%C3%A9%E2%80%93Bendixson%20theorem">Poincaré–Bendixson theorem</a> requires the use of topological methods.
This work at the end of the 19th century opened into several successive versions of the theorem. The general case was first proved in 1910 by <a href="Jacques%20Hadamard">Jacques Hadamard</a> and by <a href="Luitzen%20Egbertus%20Jan%20Brouwer">Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer</a>.

The theorem has several formulations, depending on the context in which it is used and its degree of generalization.
The simplest is sometimes given as follows:

This can be generalized to an arbitrary finite dimension:

A slightly more general version is as follows:

An even more general form is better known under a different name:

The theorem holds only for sets that are "compact" (thus, in particular, bounded and closed) and "convex". The following examples show why these requirements are important.

Consider the function
which is a continuous function from formula_9 to itself. As it shifts every point to the right, it cannot have a fixed point. Note that formula_9 is convex and closed, but not bounded.

Consider the function
which is a continuous function from the open interval (−1,1) to itself. In this interval, it shifts every point to the right, so it cannot have a fixed point. Note that (−1,1) is convex and bounded, but not closed. The function "f" "does" have a fixed point for the closed interval [−1,1], namely "f"(1) = 1.

Note that convexity is not strictly necessary for BFPT. Because the properties involved (continuity, being a fixed point) are invariant under <a href="homeomorphism">homeomorphism</a>s, BFPT is equivalent to forms in which the domain is required to be a closed unit ball formula_12. For the same reason it holds for every set that is homeomorphic to a closed ball (and therefore also <a href="closed%20set">closed</a>, bounded, <a href="connected%20space">connected</a>, <a href="simply%20connected">without holes</a>, etc.).

The following example shows that BFPT doesn't work for domains with holes. Consider the following function, defined in polar coordinates:
which is a continuous function from the unit circle to itself. It rotates every point on the unit circle 45 degrees counterclockwise, so it cannot have a fixed point. Note that the unit circle is closed and bounded, but it has a hole (and so it is not convex). The function "f" "does" have a fixed point for the unit disc, since it takes the origin to itself.

A formal generalization of BFPT for "hole-free" domains can be derived from the <a href="Lefschetz%20fixed-point%20theorem">Lefschetz fixed-point theorem</a>.

The continuous function in this theorem is not required to be <a href="bijective">bijective</a> or even <a href="surjective">surjective</a>.

The theorem has several "real world" illustrations. Here are some examples.

1. Take two sheets of graph paper of equal size with coordinate systems on them, lay one flat on the table and crumple up (without ripping or tearing) the other one and place it, in any fashion, on top of the first so that the crumpled paper does not reach outside the flat one. There will then be at least one point of the crumpled sheet that lies directly above its corresponding point (i.e. the point with the same coordinates) of the flat sheet. This is a consequence of the "n" = 2 case of Brouwer's theorem applied to the continuous map that assigns to the coordinates of every point of the crumpled sheet the coordinates of the point of the flat sheet immediately beneath it.

2. Take an ordinary map of a country, and suppose that that map is laid out on a table inside that country. There will always be a "You are Here" point on the map which represents that same point in the country.

3. In three dimensions a consequence of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem is that, no matter how much you stir a cocktail in a glass (or think about milk shake), when the liquid has come to rest, some point in the liquid will end up in exactly the same place in the glass as before you took any action, assuming that the final position of each point is a continuous function of its original position, that the liquid after stirring is contained within the space originally taken up by it, and that the glass (and stirred surface shape) maintain a convex volume. Ordering a cocktail <a href="shaken%2C%20not%20stirred">shaken, not stirred</a> defeats the convexity condition ("shaking" being defined as a dynamic series of non-convex inertial containment states in the vacant headspace under a lid). In that case, the theorem would not apply, and thus all points of the liquid disposition are potentially displaced from the original state.

The theorem is supposed to have originated from Brouwer's observation of a cup of coffee.
If one stirs to dissolve a lump of sugar, it appears there is always a point without motion.
He drew the conclusion that at any moment, there is a point on the surface that is not moving.
The fixed point is not necessarily the point that seems to be motionless, since the centre of the turbulence moves a little bit.
The result is not intuitive, since the original fixed point may become mobile when another fixed point appears.

Brouwer is said to have added: "I can formulate this splendid result different, I take a horizontal sheet, and another identical one which I crumple, flatten and place on the other. Then a point of the crumpled sheet is in the same place as on the other sheet."
Brouwer "flattens" his sheet as with a flat iron, without removing the folds and wrinkles. This example is better than the coffee cup one as it shows that uniqueness of the fixed point may fail. This distinguishes Brouwer's result from other fixed-point theorems, such as Banach's, that guarantee uniqueness.

In one dimension, the result is intuitive and easy to prove. The continuous function "f" is defined on a closed interval ["a", "b"] and takes values in the same interval. Saying that this function has a fixed point amounts to saying that its graph (dark green in the figure on the right) intersects that of the function defined on the same interval ["a", "b"] which maps "x" to "x" (light green).

Intuitively, any continuous line from the left edge of the square to the right edge must necessarily intersect the green diagonal. To prove this, consider the function "g" which maps "x" to "f"("x") - "x". It is ≥ 0 on "a" and ≤ 0 on "b". By the <a href="intermediate%20value%20theorem">intermediate value theorem</a>, "g" has a <a href="Root%20of%20a%20function">zero</a> in ["a", "b"]; this zero is a fixed point.

Brouwer is said to have expressed this as follows: "Instead of examining a surface, we will prove the theorem about a piece of string. Let us begin with the string in an unfolded state, then refold it. Let us flatten the refolded string. Again a point of the string has not changed its position with respect to its original position on the unfolded string."

The Brouwer fixed point theorem was one of the early achievements of <a href="algebraic%20topology">algebraic topology</a>, and is the basis of more general <a href="fixed%20point%20theorem">fixed point theorem</a>s which are important in <a href="functional%20analysis">functional analysis</a>. The case "n" = 3 first was proved by <a href="Piers%20Bohl">Piers Bohl</a> in 1904 (published in "<a href="Journal%20f%C3%BCr%20die%20reine%20und%20angewandte%20Mathematik">Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik</a>"). It was later proved by <a href="Luitzen%20Egbertus%20Jan%20Brouwer">L. E. J. Brouwer</a> in 1909. <a href="Jacques%20Hadamard">Jacques Hadamard</a> proved the general case in 1910, and Brouwer found a different proof in the same year. Since these early proofs were all <a href="Constructive%20proof">non-constructive</a> <a href="indirect%20proof">indirect proof</a>s, they ran contrary to Brouwer's <a href="intuitionist">intuitionist</a> ideals. Methods to construct (approximations to) fixed points guaranteed by Brouwer's theorem are now known.

To understand the prehistory of Brouwer's fixed point theorem one needs to pass through <a href="differential%20equation">differential equation</a>s. At the end of the 19th century, the old problem of the <a href="stability%20of%20the%20solar%20system">stability of the solar system</a> returned into the focus of the mathematical community.
Its solution required new methods. As noted by <a href="Henri%20Poincar%C3%A9">Henri Poincaré</a>, who worked on the <a href="three-body%20problem">three-body problem</a>, there is no hope to find an exact solution: "Nothing is more proper to give us an idea of the hardness of the three-body problem, and generally of all problems of Dynamics where there is no uniform integral and the Bohlin series diverge."
He also noted that the search for an approximate solution is no more efficient: "the more we seek to obtain precise approximations, the more the result will diverge towards an increasing imprecision".

He studied a question analogous to that of the surface movement in a cup of coffee. What can we say, in general, about the trajectories on a surface animated by a constant <a href="flow%20%28mathematics%29">flow</a>? Poincaré discovered that the answer can be found in what we now call the <a href="topology">topological</a> properties in the area containing the trajectory. If this area is <a href="compact%20space">compact</a>, i.e. both <a href="closed%20set">closed</a> and <a href="bounded%20set">bounded</a>, then the trajectory either becomes stationary, or it approaches a <a href="limit%20cycle">limit cycle</a>. Poincaré went further; if the area is of the same kind as a disk, as is the case for the cup of coffee, there must necessarily be a fixed point. This fixed point is invariant under all functions which associate to each point of the original surface its position after a short time interval "t". If the area is a circular band, or if it is not closed, then this is not necessarily the case.

To understand differential equations better, a new branch of mathematics was born. Poincaré called it "analysis situs". The French <a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Universalis">Encyclopædia Universalis</a> defines it as the branch which "treats the properties of an object that are invariant if it is deformed in any continuous way, without tearing". In 1886, Poincaré proved a result that is equivalent to Brouwer's fixed-point theorem, although the connection with the subject of this article was not yet apparent. A little later, he developed one of the fundamental tools for better understanding the analysis situs, now known as the <a href="fundamental%20group">fundamental group</a> or sometimes the Poincaré group. This method can be used for a very compact proof of the theorem under discussion.

Poincaré's method was analogous to that of <a href="%C3%89mile%20Picard">Émile Picard</a>, a contemporary mathematician who generalized the <a href="Cauchy%E2%80%93Lipschitz%20theorem">Cauchy–Lipschitz theorem</a>. Picard's approach is based on a result that would later be formalised by <a href="Banach%20fixed-point%20theorem">another fixed-point theorem</a>, named after <a href="Stefan%20Banach">Banach</a>. Instead of the topological properties of the domain, this theorem uses the fact that the function in question is a <a href="contraction%20mapping">contraction</a>.

At the dawn of the 20th century, the interest in analysis situs did not stay unnoticed. However, the necessity of a theorem equivalent to the one discussed in this article was not yet evident. Piers Bohl, a Latvian mathematician, applied topological methods to the study of differential equations. In 1904 he proved the three-dimensional case of our theorem, but his publication was not noticed.

It was Brouwer, finally, who gave the theorem its first patent of nobility. His goals were different from those of Poincaré. This mathematician was inspired by the foundations of mathematics, especially <a href="mathematical%20logic">mathematical logic</a> and <a href="topology">topology</a>. His initial interest lay in an attempt to solve <a href="Hilbert%27s%20fifth%20problem">Hilbert's fifth problem</a>. In 1909, during a voyage to Paris, he met <a href="Henri%20Poincar%C3%A9">Henri Poincaré</a>, <a href="Jacques%20Hadamard">Jacques Hadamard</a>, and <a href="%C3%89mile%20Borel">Émile Borel</a>. The ensuing discussions convinced Brouwer of the importance of a better understanding of Euclidean spaces, and were the origin of a fruitful exchange of letters with Hadamard. For the next four years, he concentrated on the proof of certain great theorems on this question. In 1912 he proved the <a href="hairy%20ball%20theorem">hairy ball theorem</a> for the two-dimensional sphere, as well as the fact that every continuous map from the two-dimensional ball to itself has a fixed point. These two results in themselves were not really new. As Hadamard observed, Poincaré had shown a theorem equivalent to the hairy ball theorem. The revolutionary aspect of Brouwer's approach was his systematic use of recently developed tools such as <a href="homotopy">homotopy</a>, the underlying concept of the Poincaré group. In the following year, Hadamard generalised the theorem under discussion to an arbitrary finite dimension, but he employed different methods. <a href="Hans%20Freudenthal">Hans Freudenthal</a> comments on the respective roles as follows: "Compared to Brouwer's revolutionary methods, those of Hadamard were very traditional, but Hadamard's participation in the birth of Brouwer's ideas resembles that of a midwife more than that of a mere spectator."

Brouwer's approach yielded its fruits, and in 1910 he also found a proof that was valid for any finite dimension, as well as other key theorems such as the invariance of dimension. In the context of this work, Brouwer also generalized the <a href="Jordan%20curve%20theorem">Jordan curve theorem</a> to arbitrary dimension and established the properties connected with the <a href="degree%20of%20a%20continuous%20mapping">degree of a continuous mapping</a>. This branch of mathematics, originally envisioned by Poincaré and developed by Brouwer, changed its name. In the 1930s, analysis situs became <a href="algebraic%20topology">algebraic topology</a>.

The theorem proved its worth in more than one way. During the 20th century numerous fixed-point theorems were developed, and even a branch of mathematics called <a href="fixed-point%20theory">fixed-point theory</a>.
Brouwer's theorem is probably the most important. It is also among the foundational theorems on the topology of <a href="topological%20manifold">topological manifold</a>s and is often used to prove other important results such as the <a href="Jordan%20curve%20theorem">Jordan curve theorem</a>.

Besides the fixed-point theorems for more or less <a href="contraction%20mapping">contracting</a> functions, there are many that have emerged directly or indirectly from the result under discussion. A continuous map from a closed ball of Euclidean space to its boundary cannot be the identity on the boundary. Similarly, the <a href="Borsuk%E2%80%93Ulam%20theorem">Borsuk–Ulam theorem</a> says that a continuous map from the "n"-dimensional sphere to R has a pair of antipodal points that are mapped to the same point. In the finite-dimensional case, the <a href="Lefschetz%20fixed-point%20theorem">Lefschetz fixed-point theorem</a> provided from 1926 a method for counting fixed points. In 1930, Brouwer's fixed-point theorem was generalized to <a href="Banach%20space">Banach space</a>s. This generalization is known as <a href="Fixed-point%20theorems%20in%20infinite-dimensional%20spaces">Schauder's fixed-point theorem</a>, a result generalized further by S. Kakutani to <a href="multivalued%20function">multivalued function</a>s. One also meets the theorem and its variants outside topology. It can be used to prove the <a href="Hartman-Grobman%20theorem">Hartman-Grobman theorem</a>, which describes the qualitative behaviour of certain differential equations near certain equilibria. Similarly, Brouwer's theorem is used for the proof of the <a href="Central%20Limit%20Theorem">Central Limit Theorem</a>. The theorem can also be found in existence proofs for the solutions of certain <a href="partial%20differential%20equation">partial differential equation</a>s.

Other areas are also touched. In <a href="game%20theory">game theory</a>, <a href="John%20Forbes%20Nash">John Nash</a> used the theorem to prove that in the game of <a href="Hex%20%28board%20game%29">Hex</a> there is a winning strategy for white. In economics, P. Bich explains that certain generalizations of the theorem show that its use is helpful for certain classical problems in game theory and generally for equilibria (<a href="Hotelling%27s%20law">Hotelling's law</a>), financial equilibria and incomplete markets.

Brouwer's celebrity is not exclusively due to his topological work. The proofs of his great topological theorems are <a href="constructive%20proof">not constructive</a>, and Brouwer's dissatisfaction with this is partly what led him to articulate the idea of <a href="constructivism%20%28mathematics%29">constructivity</a>. He became the originator and zealous defender of a way of formalising mathematics that is known as <a href="intuitionistic%20logic">intuitionism</a>, which at the time made a stand against <a href="set%20theory">set theory</a>. The fixed-point theorem is, as he originally stated it, "false" in intuitionism, and Brouwer disavowed it, proposing instead alternative versions to be constructively proven.

Brouwer's original 1911 proof relied on the notion of the <a href="degree%20of%20a%20continuous%20mapping">degree of a continuous mapping</a>. Modern accounts of the proof can also be found in the literature.

Let formula_14 denote the closed unit ball in formula_15 centered at the origin. Suppose for simplicitly that formula_16 is continuously differentiable. A <a href="regular%20value">regular value</a> of formula_1 is a point formula_18 such that the <a href="Jacobian%20matrix%20and%20determinant">Jacobian</a> of formula_1 is non-singular at every point of the preimage of formula_20. In particular, by the <a href="inverse%20function%20theorem">inverse function theorem</a>, every point of the preimage of formula_1 lies in formula_22 (the interior of formula_23). The degree of formula_1 at a regular value formula_18 is defined as the sum of the signs of the <a href="Jacobian%20determinant">Jacobian determinant</a> of formula_1 over the preimages of formula_20 under formula_1:

The degree is, roughly speaking, the number of "sheets" of the preimage "f" lying over a small open set around "p", with sheets counted oppositely if they are oppositely oriented. This is thus a generalization of <a href="winding%20number">winding number</a> to higher dimensions.

The degree satisfies the property of "homotopy invariance": let formula_1 and formula_31 be two continuously differentiable functions, and formula_32 for formula_33. Suppose that the point formula_20 is a regular value of formula_35 for all "t". Then formula_36.

If there is no fixed point of the boundary of formula_23, then the function 
is a homotopy from formula_39 to the identity function. The identity function has degree one at every point. In particular, the identity function has degree one at the origin, so formula_31 also has degree one at the origin. As a consequence, the preimage formula_41 is not empty. The elements of formula_41 are precisely the fixed points of the original function "f".

This requires some work to make fully general. The definition of degree must be extended to singular values of "f", and then to continuous functions. The more modern advent of <a href="homology%20theory">homology theory</a> simplifies the construction of the degree, and so has become a standard proof in the literature.

The proof uses the observation that the <a href="boundary%20%28topology%29">boundary</a> of "D" is "S", the ("n" − 1)-<a href="sphere">sphere</a>.
The argument proceeds by contradiction, supposing that a continuous function "f" : "D" → "D" has "no" fixed point, and then attempting to derive an inconsistency, which proves that the function must in fact have a fixed point. For each "x" in "D", there is only one straight line that passes through "f"("x") and "x", because it must be the case that "f"("x") and "x" are distinct by hypothesis (recall that "f" having no fixed points means that "f"("x") ≠ "x"). Following this line from "f"("x") through "x" leads to a point on "S", denoted by "F"("x"). This defines a continuous function "F" : "D" → "S", which is a special type of continuous function known as a <a href="retract">retract</a>ion: every point of the <a href="codomain">codomain</a> (in this case "S") is a fixed point of the function.

Intuitively it seems unlikely that there could be a retraction of "D" onto "S", and in the case "n" = 1 it is obviously impossible because "S" (i.e., the endpoints of the closed interval "D") is not even connected. The case "n" = 2 is less obvious, but can be proven by using basic arguments involving the <a href="fundamental%20group">fundamental group</a>s of the respective spaces: the retraction would induce an injective <a href="group%20homomorphism">group homomorphism</a> from the fundamental group of "S" to that of "D", but the first group is isomorphic to Z while the latter group is trivial, so this is impossible. The case "n" = 2 can also be proven by contradiction based on a theorem about non-vanishing <a href="vector%20field">vector field</a>s.

For "n" > 2, however, proving the impossibility of the retraction is more difficult. One way is to make use of <a href="Homology%20%28mathematics%29">homology groups</a>: the homology "H"("D") is trivial, while "H"("S") is infinite <a href="cyclic%20group">cyclic</a>. This shows that the retraction is impossible, because again the retraction would induce an injective group homomorphism from the latter to the former group.

To prove that a map has fixed points, one can assume that it is smooth, because if a map has no fixed points then convolving it with a smooth function of sufficiently small support and integral equal to one produces a smooth function with no fixed points. As in the proof using homology, one is reduced to proving that there is no smooth retraction "f" from the ball "B" onto its boundary "∂B". If ω is a volume form on the boundary then by <a href="Stokes%20Theorem">Stokes Theorem</a>,
giving a contradiction.

More generally, this shows that there is no smooth retraction from any non-empty smooth orientable compact manifold onto its boundary. The proof using Stokes's theorem is closely related to the proof using homology (or rather cohomology), because the form ω generates the de Rham cohomology group "H"("∂B") used in the cohomology proof.

The BFPT can be proved based on <a href="Sperner%27s%20lemma">Sperner's lemma</a>. We now give an outline of the proof for the special case in which "f" is a function from the unit "n"-<a href="simplex">simplex</a> to itself, i.e.: 
Where:

For every point formula_46, also formula_47. Hence the sum of their coordinates is equal:

Hence, by the pigeonhole principle, for every formula_46 there must be an index formula_50 such that the formula_51-th coordinate of formula_52 is weakly larger than the formula_51-th coordinate of its image under "f":

Moreover, if formula_52 lies on a "k"-dimensional sub-face of formula_56, then by the same argument, the index formula_51 can be selected from among the ("k"+1) coordinates which are not zero on this sub-face.

We now use this fact to construct a Sperner coloring. For every triangulation of formula_56, the color of every vertex formula_52 is an index formula_51 such that formula_54.

By construction, this is a Sperner coloring. Hence, by Sperner's lemma, there is an "n"-dimensional simplex whose vertices are colored with the entire set of ("n"+1) available colors.

Because "f" is continuous, this simplex can be made arbitrarily small by choosing an arbitrarily fine triangulation. Hence, there must be a point formula_52 which satisfies the labeling condition in all coordinates, i.e.:

Because the sum of the coordinates of formula_52 and formula_65 must be equal, all these inequalities must actually be equalities. But this means that:

I.e, formula_52 is a fixed point of formula_1.

The proof can be extended to every object which is homeomorphic to formula_56.

There is also a quick proof, by <a href="Morris%20Hirsch">Morris Hirsch</a>, based on the impossibility of a differentiable retraction. The <a href="indirect%20proof">indirect proof</a> starts by noting that the map "f" can be approximated by a smooth map retaining the property of not fixing a point; this can be done by using the <a href="Weierstrass%20approximation%20theorem">Weierstrass approximation theorem</a>, for example. One then defines a retraction as above which must now be differentiable. Such a retraction must have a non-singular value, by <a href="Sard%27s%20theorem">Sard's theorem</a>, which is also non-singular for the restriction to the boundary (which is just the identity). Thus the inverse image would be a 1-manifold with boundary. The boundary would have to contain at least two end points, both of which would have to lie on the boundary of the original ball—which is impossible in a retraction.

Kellogg, Li, and Yorke turned Hirsch's proof into a constructive proof by observing that the retract is in fact defined everywhere except at the fixed points. For almost any point, q, on the boundary, (assuming it is not a fixed point) the one manifold with boundary mentioned above does exist and the only possibility is that it leads from q to a fixed point. It is an easy numerical task to follow such a path from q to the fixed point so the method is essentially constructive. Chow, Mallet-Paret, and Yorke gave a conceptually similar path-following version of the homotopy proof which extends to a wide variety of related problems.

A variation of the preceding proof does not employ the Sard's theorem, and goes as follows. If "r" : "B"→∂"B"   is a smooth retraction, one considers the smooth deformation "g(x) := t r(x) + (1-t)x," and the smooth function
Differentiating under the sign of integral it is not difficult to check that "φ′(t)=0" for all "t", so "φ" is a constant function, which is a contradiction because "φ(0)" is the "n"-dimensional volume of the ball, while "φ(1)" is zero. The geometric idea is that "φ(t)" is the oriented area of "g(B)" (that is, the Lebesgue measure of the image of the ball via "g", taking into account multiplicity and orientation), and should remain constant (as it is very clear in the one-dimensional case). On the other hand, as the parameter "t" passes form "0" to "1" the map "g" transforms continuously from the identity map of the ball, to the retraction "r", which is a contradiction since the oriented area of the identity coincides with the volume of the ball, while the oriented area of "r" is necessarily "0", as its image is the boundary of the ball, a set of null measure.

A quite different proof given by <a href="David%20Gale">David Gale</a> is based on the game of <a href="Hex%20%28board%20game%29">Hex</a>. The basic theorem about Hex is that no game can end in a draw. This is equivalent to the Brouwer fixed-point theorem for dimension 2. By considering "n"-dimensional versions of Hex, one can prove in general that Brouwer's theorem is equivalent to the <a href="determinacy">determinacy</a> theorem for Hex.

The Lefschetz fixed-point theorem says that if a continuous map "f" from a finite simplicial complex "B" to itself has only isolated fixed points, then the number of fixed points counted with multiplicities (which may be negative) is equal to the Lefschetz number
and in particular if the Lefschetz number is nonzero then "f" must have a fixed point. If "B" is a ball (or more generally is contractible) then the Lefschetz number is one because the only non-zero homology group is :formula_72 and "f" acts as the identity on this group, so "f" has a fixed point.

In <a href="reverse%20mathematics">reverse mathematics</a>, Brouwer's theorem can be proved in the system <a href="Weak%20K%C3%B6nig%27s%20lemma">WKL</a>, and conversely over the base system <a href="reverse%20mathematics">RCA</a> Brouwer's theorem for a square implies the <a href="weak%20K%C3%B6nig%27s%20lemma">weak König's lemma</a>, so this gives a precise description of the strength of Brouwer's theorem.

The Brouwer fixed-point theorem forms the starting point of a number of more general <a href="fixed-point%20theorem">fixed-point theorem</a>s.

The straightforward generalization to infinite dimensions, i.e. using the unit ball of an arbitrary <a href="Hilbert%20space">Hilbert space</a> instead of Euclidean space, is not true. The main problem here is that the unit balls of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces are not <a href="compact%20space">compact</a>. For example, in the Hilbert space <a href="Lp%20space">ℓ</a> of square-summable real (or complex) sequences, consider the map "f" : ℓ → ℓ which sends a sequence ("x") from the closed unit ball of ℓ to the sequence ("y") defined by
It is not difficult to check that this map is continuous, has its image in the unit sphere of ℓ, but does not have a fixed point.

The generalizations of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem to infinite dimensional spaces therefore all include a compactness assumption of some sort, and in addition also often an assumption of <a href="Convex%20set">convexity</a>. See <a href="fixed-point%20theorems%20in%20infinite-dimensional%20spaces">fixed-point theorems in infinite-dimensional spaces</a> for a discussion of these theorems.

There is also finite-dimensional generalization to a larger class of spaces: If formula_74 is a product of finitely many chainable continua, then every continuous function formula_75 has a fixed point, where a chainable continuum is a (usually but in this case not necessarily <a href="Metric%20space">metric</a>) <a href="Compact%20space">compact</a> <a href="Hausdorff%20space">Hausdorff space</a> of which every <a href="open%20cover">open cover</a> has a finite open refinement formula_76, such that formula_77 if and only if formula_78. Examples of chainable continua include compact connected linearly ordered spaces and in particular closed intervals of real numbers.

The <a href="Kakutani%20fixed%20point%20theorem">Kakutani fixed point theorem</a> generalizes the Brouwer fixed-point theorem in a different direction: it stays in R, but considers upper <a href="hemi-continuous">hemi-continuous</a> <a href="correspondence%20%28mathematics%29">correspondences</a> (functions that assign to each point of the set a subset of the set). It also requires compactness and convexity of the set.

The <a href="Lefschetz%20fixed-point%20theorem">Lefschetz fixed-point theorem</a> applies to (almost) arbitrary compact topological spaces, and gives a condition in terms of <a href="singular%20homology">singular homology</a> that guarantees the existence of fixed points; this condition is trivially satisfied for any map in the case of "D".

Benzoic acid

Benzoic acid , CHO (or CHCOOH), is a colorless crystalline solid and a simple <a href="aromaticity">aromatic</a> <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a>. The name is derived from <a href="benzoin%20%28resin%29">gum benzoin</a>, which was for a long time its only known source. Benzoic acid occurs naturally in many plants and it serves as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of many <a href="secondary%20metabolite">secondary metabolite</a>s. <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">Salts</a> of benzoic acid are used as food preservatives and benzoic acid is an important precursor for the industrial synthesis of many other organic substances. The salts and <a href="ester">ester</a>s of benzoic acid are known as benzoates .

Benzoic acid was discovered in the sixteenth century. The <a href="dry%20distillation">dry distillation</a> of gum benzoin was first described by <a href="Nostradamus">Nostradamus</a> (1556), and then by <a href="Alexius%20Pedemontanus">Alexius Pedemontanus</a> (1560) and <a href="Blaise%20de%20Vigen%C3%A8re">Blaise de Vigenère</a> (1596).

Pioneer work in 1830 through a variety of experiences based on <a href="amygdalin">amygdalin</a>, obtained from <a href="bitter%20almonds">bitter almonds</a> (the fruit of "<a href="Prunus%20dulcis">Prunus dulcis</a>") oil by <a href="Pierre%20Robiquet">Pierre Robiquet</a> and Antoine Boutron-Charlard, two French chemists, had produced <a href="benzaldehyde">benzaldehyde</a> but they failed in working out a proper interpretation of the structure of amygdalin that would account for it, and thus missed the identification of the <a href="benzoyl">benzoyl</a> radical CHO.
This last step was achieved some few months later (1832) by <a href="Justus%20von%20Liebig">Justus von Liebig</a> and <a href="Friedrich%20W%C3%B6hler">Friedrich Wöhler</a>, who determined the composition of benzoic acid. These latter also investigated how <a href="hippuric%20acid">hippuric acid</a> is related to benzoic acid.

In 1875 Salkowski discovered the <a href="Antifungal%20medication">antifungal</a> abilities of benzoic acid, which was used for a long time in the preservation of benzoate-containing <a href="Cloudberry">cloudberry fruits</a>.

It is also one of the chemical compounds found in <a href="castoreum">castoreum</a>. This compound is gathered from the <a href="castor%20sac">castor sac</a>s of the <a href="North%20American%20beaver">North American beaver</a>.

Benzoic acid is produced commercially by <a href="partial%20oxidation">partial oxidation</a> of <a href="toluene">toluene</a> with <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>. The process is catalyzed by <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a> or <a href="manganese">manganese</a> <a href="naphthenate">naphthenate</a>s. The process uses cheap raw materials, and proceeds in high yield.

Benzoic acid is cheap and readily available, so the laboratory synthesis of benzoic acid is mainly practiced for its pedagogical value. It is a common undergraduate preparation.

Benzoic acid can be purified by recrystallization from water because of its high solubility in hot water and poor solubility in cold water. The avoidance of organic solvents for the recrystallization makes this experiment particularly safe. This process usually gives a yield of around 65% The solubility of benzoic acid in over 40 solvents with references to original sources can be found as part of the <a href="Open%20Notebook%20Science%20Challenge">Open Notebook Science Challenge</a>.

Like other <a href="nitrile">nitrile</a>s and <a href="amide">amide</a>s, <a href="benzonitrile">benzonitrile</a> and <a href="benzamide">benzamide</a> can be hydrolyzed to benzoic acid or its conjugate base in acid or basic conditions.

The base-induced <a href="disproportionation">disproportionation</a> of <a href="benzaldehyde">benzaldehyde</a>, the <a href="Cannizzaro%20reaction">Cannizzaro reaction</a>, affords equal amounts of benzoate and <a href="benzyl%20alcohol">benzyl alcohol</a>; the latter can be removed by <a href="distillation">distillation</a>.

<a href="Bromobenzene">Bromobenzene</a> can be converted to benzoic acid by "carboxylation" of the intermediate <a href="phenylmagnesium%20bromide">phenylmagnesium bromide</a>. This synthesis offers a convenient exercise for students to carry out a <a href="Grignard%20reaction">Grignard reaction</a>, an important class of <a href="carbon%E2%80%93carbon%20bond">carbon–carbon bond</a> forming reaction in organic chemistry.

<a href="Benzyl%20alcohol">Benzyl alcohol</a> is refluxed with potassium permanganate or other oxidizing reagents in water. The mixture is hot filtered to remove manganese dioxide and then allowed to cool to afford benzoic acid.

Benzoic acid can be prepared by oxidation of <a href="benzyl%20chloride">benzyl chloride</a> in the presence of alkaline KMnO:

The first industrial process involved the reaction of <a href="benzotrichloride">benzotrichloride</a> (trichloromethyl benzene) with <a href="calcium%20hydroxide">calcium hydroxide</a> in water, using <a href="iron">iron</a> or iron salts as <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a>. The resulting <a href="calcium%20benzoate">calcium benzoate</a> is converted to benzoic acid with <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a>. The product contains significant amounts of chlorinated benzoic acid derivatives. For this reason, benzoic acid for human consumption was obtained by dry distillation of gum benzoin. Food-grade benzoic acid is now produced synthetically.

Benzoic acid is mainly consumed in the production of <a href="phenol">phenol</a> by oxidative <a href="decarboxylation">decarboxylation</a> at 300−400 °C:
The temperature required can be lowered to 200 °C by the addition of catalytic amounts of copper(II) salts. The phenol can be converted to <a href="cyclohexanol">cyclohexanol</a>, which is a starting material for <a href="nylon">nylon</a> synthesis.

Benzoate <a href="plasticizer">plasticizer</a>s, such as the glycol-, diethyleneglycol-, and triethyleneglycol esters, are obtained by <a href="transesterification">transesterification</a> of <a href="methyl%20benzoate">methyl benzoate</a> with the corresponding <a href="diol">diol</a>. Alternatively these species arise by treatment of benzoylchloride with the diol. These plasticizers are used similarly to those derived from <a href="terephthalic%20acid">terephthalic acid</a> ester.

Benzoic acid and its salts are used as a food <a href="preservative">preservative</a>s, represented by the <a href="E-numbers">E-numbers</a> <a href="E210">E210</a>, <a href="sodium%20benzoate">E211</a>, <a href="potassium%20benzoate">E212</a>, and <a href="calcium%20benzoate">E213</a>. Benzoic acid inhibits the growth of <a href="mold">mold</a>, <a href="yeast">yeast</a> and some <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>. It is either added directly or created from reactions with its <a href="sodium">sodium</a>, <a href="potassium">potassium</a>, or <a href="calcium">calcium</a> salt. The mechanism starts with the absorption of benzoic acid into the cell. If the intracellular <a href="pH">pH</a> changes to 5 or lower, the <a href="Fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29">anaerobic fermentation</a> of <a href="glucose">glucose</a> through <a href="phosphofructokinase">phosphofructokinase</a> is decreased by 95%. The efficacy of benzoic acid and benzoate is thus dependent on the pH of the food. Acidic food and beverage like <a href="fruit%20juice">fruit juice</a> (<a href="citric%20acid">citric acid</a>), sparkling drinks (<a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>), <a href="soft%20drinks">soft drinks</a> (<a href="phosphoric%20acid">phosphoric acid</a>), <a href="Pickling">pickles</a> (<a href="vinegar">vinegar</a>) or other acidified food are preserved with benzoic acid and benzoates.

Typical levels of use for benzoic acid as a preservative in food are between 0.05–0.1%. Foods in which benzoic acid may be used and maximum levels for its application are controlled by international food law.

Concern has been expressed that benzoic acid and its salts may react with <a href="ascorbic%20acid">ascorbic acid</a> (vitamin C) in some soft drinks, forming small quantities of <a href="benzene">benzene</a>.
Benzoic acid is a constituent of <a href="Whitfield%27s%20ointment">Whitfield's ointment</a> which is used for the treatment of fungal skin diseases such as <a href="tinea">tinea</a>, <a href="ringworm">ringworm</a>, and <a href="athlete%27s%20foot">athlete's foot</a>. As the principal component of <a href="benzoin%20%28resin%29">gum benzoin</a>, benzoic acid is also a major ingredient in both <a href="tincture%20of%20benzoin">tincture of benzoin</a> and Friar's balsam. Such products have a long history of use as topical <a href="antiseptic">antiseptic</a>s and inhalant <a href="decongestant">decongestant</a>s.

Benzoic acid was used as an <a href="expectorant">expectorant</a>, <a href="analgesic">analgesic</a>, and <a href="antiseptic">antiseptic</a> in the early 20th century.

Benzoic acid is a precursor to <a href="benzoyl%20chloride">benzoyl chloride</a>, CHC(O)Cl by treatment with <a href="thionyl%20chloride">thionyl chloride</a>, <a href="phosgene">phosgene</a> or one of the <a href="phosphorus%20chlorides">chlorides of phosphorus</a>. Benzoyl chloride is an important starting material for several benzoic acid derivates like <a href="benzyl%20benzoate">benzyl benzoate</a>, which is used in <a href="Flavouring">artificial flavours</a> and <a href="insect%20repellent">insect repellent</a>s.

In teaching laboratories, benzoic acid is a common standard for calibrating a <a href="bomb%20calorimeter">bomb calorimeter</a>.

Benzoic acid is relatively nontoxic. It is excreted as <a href="hippuric%20acid">hippuric acid</a>. Benzoic acid is metabolized by <a href="butyrate-CoA%20ligase">butyrate-CoA ligase</a> into an intermediate product, <a href="benzoyl-CoA">benzoyl-CoA</a>, which is then metabolized by <a href="glycine%20N-acyltransferase">glycine "N"-acyltransferase</a> into hippuric acid.

Benzoic acid occurs naturally as do its esters in many plant and animal species. Appreciable amounts have been found in most berries (around 0.05%). Ripe fruits of several "<a href="Vaccinium">Vaccinium</a>" species (e.g., <a href="cranberry">cranberry</a>, "V. vitis macrocarpon"; <a href="bilberry">bilberry</a>, "V. myrtillus") contain as much as 0.03–0.13% free benzoic acid. Benzoic acid is also formed in <a href="apple">apple</a>s after infection with the fungus "<a href="Nectria%20galligena">Nectria galligena</a>". Among animals, benzoic acid has been identified primarily in omnivorous or phytophageous species, e.g., in viscera and muscles of the <a href="rock%20ptarmigan">rock ptarmigan</a> ("Lagopus muta") as well as in gland secretions of male <a href="muskox">muskox</a>en ("Ovibos moschatus") or Asian bull elephants ("<a href="Elephas%20maximus">Elephas maximus</a>").

<a href="Benzoin%20%28resin%29">Gum benzoin</a> contains up to 20% of benzoic acid and 40% benzoic acid esters.

"<a href="Cryptanaerobacter%20phenolicus">Cryptanaerobacter phenolicus</a>" is a bacterium species that produces benzoate from <a href="phenol">phenol</a> via <a href="4-hydroxybenzoate">4-hydroxybenzoate</a>

Benzoic acid is present as part of <a href="hippuric%20acid">hippuric acid</a> ("N"-benzoylglycine) in <a href="urine">urine</a> of <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s, especially <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>s (Gr. "hippos" = horse; "ouron" = urine). Humans produce about 0.44 g/L <a href="hippuric%20acid">hippuric acid</a> in their urine, and if the person is exposed to <a href="toluene">toluene</a> or benzoic acid, it can rise above that level.

For humans, the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>'s <a href="International%20Programme%20on%20Chemical%20Safety">International Programme on Chemical Safety</a> (IPCS) suggests a provisional tolerable intake would be 5 mg/kg body weight per day. <a href="Cat">Cat</a>s have a significantly lower tolerance against benzoic acid and its <a href="Salt%20%28chemistry%29">salts</a> than <a href="rat">rat</a>s and <a href="mouse">mice</a>. Lethal dose for cats can be as low as 300 mg/kg body weight. The oral for rats is 3040 mg/kg, for mice it is 1940–2263 mg/kg.

In <a href="Taipei">Taipei</a>, Taiwan, a city health survey in 2010 found that 30% of dried and pickled food products had benzoic acid.

Reactions of benzoic acid can occur at either the <a href="aromaticity">aromatic ring</a> or at the <a href="carboxyl%20group">carboxyl group</a>:

<a href="Electrophilic%20aromatic%20substitution">Electrophilic aromatic substitution</a> reaction will take place mainly in 3-position due to the <a href="deactivating%20group">electron-withdrawing</a> <a href="carboxylic%20group">carboxylic group</a>; i.e. benzoic acid is <a href="electrophilic%20aromatic%20substitution%23Meta%20directors">"meta" directing</a>.

The second substitution reaction (on the right) is slower because the first nitro group is deactivating. Conversely, if an activating group (electron-donating) was introduced (e.g., alkyl), a second substitution reaction would occur more readily than the first and the disubstituted product might accumulate to a significant extent.

All the reactions mentioned for <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a>s are also possible for benzoic acid.

Boltzmann distribution

In <a href="statistical%20mechanics">statistical mechanics</a> and <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, a Boltzmann distribution (also called Gibbs distribution) is a <a href="probability%20distribution">probability distribution</a>, <a href="probability%20measure">probability measure</a>, or <a href="frequency%20distribution">frequency distribution</a> of particles in a system over various possible <a href="microstate%20%28statistical%20mechanics%29">state</a>s. The distribution is expressed in the form

formula_1

where formula_2 is state energy (which varies from state to state), and formula_3 (a constant of the distribution) is the product of <a href="Boltzmann%27s%20constant">Boltzmann's constant</a> and <a href="thermodynamic%20temperature">thermodynamic temperature</a>.

In statistical mechanics, the Boltzmann distribution is a probability distribution that gives the probability that a system will be in a certain state as a function of that state’s energy and the temperature of the system. It is given as

formula_4

where "p" is the probability of state i, "ε" the energy of state i, "k" the Boltzmann constant, "T" the temperature of the system and "M" is the number of states accessible to the system. The sum is over all states accessible to the system of interest. The term system here has a very wide meaning; it can range from a single atom to a macroscopic system such as a natural gas storage tank. Because of this the Boltzmann distribution can be used to solve a very wide variety of problems. The distribution shows that states with lower energy will always have a higher probability of being occupied than the states with higher energy.

The "ratio" of a Boltzmann distribution computed for two states is known as the Boltzmann factor and characteristically only depends on the states' energy difference.

formula_5

The Boltzmann distribution is named after <a href="Ludwig%20Boltzmann">Ludwig Boltzmann</a> who first formulated it in 1868 during his studies of the <a href="statistical%20mechanics">statistical mechanics</a> of gases in thermal equilibrium. Boltzmann's statistical work is borne out in his paper “On the Relationship between the Second Fundamental Theorem of the Mechanical Theory of Heat and Probability Calculations Regarding the Conditions for Thermal Equilibrium." 
The distribution was later investigated extensively, in its modern generic form, by <a href="Josiah%20Willard%20Gibbs">Josiah Willard Gibbs</a> in 1902.

The Boltzmann distribution should not be confused with the <a href="Maxwell-Boltzmann%20distribution">Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution</a>. The former gives the probability that a system will be in a certain state as a function of that state's energy. Whereas, the latter is used to describe particle speeds in idealized gases.

The Boltzmann distribution is a probability distribution that gives the probability of a certain state as a function of that state’s energy and temperature of the <a href="system">system</a> to which the distribution is applied. It is given as

formula_4

where "p" is the probability of state i, "ε" the energy of state i, "k" the Boltzmann constant, "T" the temperature of the system and "M" is the number of all states accessible to the system. The sum is over all states accessible to the system of interest. The right hand side denominator of the equation above is also known as the <a href="canonical%20partition%20function">canonical partition function</a>, commonly denoted by Q (or by some authors by Z).

formula_7

Therefore, the Boltzmann distribution can also be written as

formula_8

This is the distribution that maximizes the <a href="entropy">entropy</a> 

formula_9 

subject the constraint that 
formula_10
equals a particular mean energy value (which can be proven using <a href="Lagrange%20multipliers">Lagrange multipliers</a>).
The partition function can be calculated if we know the energies of the levels accessible to the system of interest. For atoms the partition function values can be found in the NIST Atomic Spectra Database.

The distribution shows that states with lower energy will always have a higher probability of being occupied than the states with higher energy. It can also give us the quantitative relationship between the probabilities of the two states being occupied. The ratio of probabilities for states i and j is given as

formula_11

where "p" is the probability of state i, "p" the probability of state j, and "ε" and "ε" are the energies of states i and j, respectively.

The Boltzmann distribution is often used to describe the distribution of particles, such as atoms or molecules, over energy states accessible to them. If we have a system consisting of many particles, the probability of a particle being in state i is practically the probability that, if we pick a random particle from that system and check what state it is in, we will find it is in state i. This probability is equal to the number of particles in state i divided by the total number of particles in the system, that is the fraction of particles that occupy state i.

formula_12

where "N" is the number of particles in state i and "N" is the total number of particles in the system. We may use the Boltzmann distribution to find this probability that is, as we have seen, equal to the fraction of particles that are in state i. So the equation that gives the fraction of particles in state i as a function of the energy of that state is 

formula_13

This equation is of great importance to <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopy</a>. In spectroscopy we observe a <a href="spectral%20line">spectral line</a> if atoms or molecules that we are interested in going from one state to another. In order for this to be possible, there must be some particles in the first state to undergo the transition. We may find that this condition is fulfilled by finding the fraction of particles in the first state. If it is negligible, the transition is very likely not be observed at the temperature for which the calculation was done. In general, a larger fraction of molecules in the first state means a higher number of transitions to the second state. This gives a stronger spectral line. However, there are other factors that influence the intensity of a spectral line, such as whether it is caused by an allowed or a <a href="forbidden%20transition">forbidden transition</a>.

The Boltzmann distribution appears in <a href="statistical%20mechanics">statistical mechanics</a> when considering isolated (or nearly-isolated) systems of fixed composition that are in <a href="thermal%20equilibrium">thermal equilibrium</a> (equilibrium with respect to energy exchange). The most general case is the probability distribution for the canonical ensemble, but also some special cases (derivable from the canonical ensemble) also show the Boltzmann distribution in different aspects:


Although these cases have strong similarities, it is helpful to distinguish them as they generalize in different ways when the crucial assumptions are changed:

In more general mathematical settings, the Boltzmann distribution is also known as the <a href="Gibbs%20measure">Gibbs measure</a>. In <a href="statistics">statistics</a> and <a href="machine%20learning">machine learning</a> it is called a <a href="log-linear%20model">log-linear model</a>. In <a href="deep%20learning">deep learning</a> the Boltzmann distribution is used in the sampling distribution of <a href="Stochastic%20neural%20network">stochastic neural networks</a> such as the <a href="Boltzmann%20machine">Boltzmann machine</a>.

The Boltzmann distribution can be introduced to allocate permits in emissions trading. The new allocation method using the Boltzmann distribution can describe the most probable, natural, and unbiased distribution of emissions permits among multiple countries. Simple and versatile, this new method holds potential for many economic and environmental applications.

<doc id="4109" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4109" title="Leg theory">
Leg theory

Leg theory is a <a href="bowling%20%28cricket%29">bowling</a> tactic in the <a href="sport">sport</a> of <a href="cricket">cricket</a>. The term "leg theory" is somewhat archaic and seldom used any longer, but the basic tactic remains a play in modern cricket.

Simply put, leg theory involves concentrating the bowling attack at or near the <a href="line%20and%20length">line</a> of <a href="stump%20%28cricket%29">leg stump</a>. This may or may not be accompanied by a concentration of <a href="fielding%20positions%20in%20cricket">fielders</a> on the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a>. The line of attack aims to cramp the <a href="batsman">batsman</a>, making him play the <a href="cricket%20ball">ball</a> with the <a href="cricket%20bat">bat</a> close to the body. This makes it difficult to hit the ball freely and score runs, especially on the <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Off%20and%20leg%20side%20fields">off side</a>. Since a leg theory attack means the batsman is more likely to hit the ball on the leg side, additional fielders on that side of the field can be effective in preventing runs and taking catches.

Stifling the batsman in this manner can lead to impatience and frustration, resulting in rash play by the batsman which in turn can lead to a quick dismissal.

Leg theory can be a moderately successful tactic when used with both <a href="fast%20bowling">fast bowling</a> and <a href="spin%20bowling">spin bowling</a>, particularly <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a> to right-handed batsmen or <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a> to left-handed batsmen. However, because it relies on lack of concentration or discipline by the batsman, it can be risky against patient and skilled players, especially batsmen who are strong on the leg side. The English opening bowlers <a href="Sydney%20Barnes">Sydney Barnes</a> and <a href="Frank%20Foster%20%28cricketer%29">Frank Foster</a> used leg theory with some success in Australia in 1911-12. In England, at around the same time <a href="Fred%20Root">Fred Root</a> was one of the main proponents of the same tactic.

Concentrating attack on the leg stump is considered by many cricket fans and commentators to lead to boring play, as it stifles run scoring and encourages batsmen to play conservatively.

In 1930, <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> captain <a href="Douglas%20Jardine">Douglas Jardine</a>, together with <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>'s captain <a href="Arthur%20Carr%20%28cricketer%29">Arthur Carr</a> and his bowlers <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Harold Larwood</a> and <a href="Bill%20Voce">Bill Voce</a>, developed a variant of leg theory in which the bowlers bowled fast, short-pitched balls that would rise into the batsman's body, together with a heavily stacked ring of close fielders on the leg side. The idea was that when the batsman defended against the ball, he would be likely to deflect the ball into the air for a catch.

Jardine called this modified form of the tactic "fast leg theory". On the 1932-33 English tour of <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, Larwood and Voce bowled fast leg theory at the Australian batsmen. It turned out to be extremely dangerous, and most Australian players sustained injuries from being hit by the ball. <a href="Wicket-keeper">Wicket-keeper</a> <a href="Bert%20Oldfield">Bert Oldfield</a>'s skull was fractured by a ball hitting his head (although the ball had first glanced off the bat and Larwood had an orthodox field), almost precipitating a riot by the Australian crowd.

The Australian press dubbed the tactic "<a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a>", and claimed it was a deliberate attempt by the English team to intimidate and injure the Australian players. Reports of the controversy reaching England at the time described the bowling as "fast leg theory", which sounded to many people to be a harmless and well-established tactic. This led to a serious misunderstanding amongst the English public and the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> - the administrators of English cricket - of the dangers posed by Bodyline. The English press and cricket authorities declared the Australian protests to be a case of sore losing and "squealing".

It was only with the return of the English team and the subsequent use of Bodyline against English players in England by the touring <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indian cricket team</a> in 1933 that demonstrated to the country the dangers it posed. The MCC subsequently revised the <a href="Laws%20of%20Cricket">Laws of Cricket</a> to prevent the use of "fast leg theory" tactics in future, also limiting the traditional tactic.

Bioleaching

Bioleaching is the extraction of <a href="metal">metal</a>s from their <a href="ore">ore</a>s through the use of <a href="living%20organism">living organism</a>s. This is much cleaner than the traditional <a href="heap%20leaching">heap leaching</a> using <a href="cyanide">cyanide</a>. Bioleaching is one of several applications within <a href="biohydrometallurgy">biohydrometallurgy</a> and several methods are used to recover <a href="copper">copper</a>, <a href="zinc">zinc</a>, <a href="lead">lead</a>, <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>, <a href="antimony">antimony</a>, <a href="nickel">nickel</a>, <a href="molybdenum">molybdenum</a>, <a href="gold">gold</a>, <a href="silver">silver</a>, and <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a>.

Bioleaching can involve numerous ferrous iron and sulfur oxidizing bacteria, including "<a href="Acidithiobacillus">Acidithiobacillus</a> ferrooxidans" (formerly known as "Thiobacillus ferrooxidans") and "Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans " (formerly known as "Thiobacillus thiooxidans"). As a general principle, Fe ions are used to oxidize the ore. This step is entirely independent of microbes. The role of the bacteria is the further oxidation of the ore, but also the regeneration of the chemical oxidant Fe from Fe. For example, bacteria <a href="catalyst">catalyse</a> the breakdown of the mineral <a href="pyrite">pyrite</a> (FeS) by oxidising the <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> and metal (in this case ferrous iron, (Fe)) using <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>. This yields <a href="Solubility">soluble</a> <a href="product%20%28chemistry%29">products</a> that can be further purified and refined to yield the desired metal.

<a href="Pyrite">Pyrite</a> leaching (FeS):
In the first step, disulfide is spontaneously oxidized to <a href="thiosulfate">thiosulfate</a> by ferric ion (Fe), which in turn is reduced to give ferrous ion (Fe):

The ferrous ion is then oxidized by bacteria using oxygen:

Thiosulfate is also oxidized by bacteria to give sulfate:

The ferric ion produced in reaction (2) oxidized more sulfide as in reaction (1), closing the cycle and given the net reaction:

The net products of the reaction are soluble <a href="ferrous%20sulfate">ferrous sulfate</a> and <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a>.

The microbial oxidation process occurs at the <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a> of the bacteria. The <a href="electron">electron</a>s pass into the <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cell</a>s and are used in <a href="biochemical">biochemical</a> processes to produce energy for the bacteria while reducing oxygen to <a href="water">water</a>. The critical reaction is the oxidation of sulfide by ferric iron. The main role of the bacterial step is the regeneration of this reactant.

The process for copper is very similar, but the efficiency and kinetics depend on the copper mineralogy. The most efficient minerals are supergene minerals such as <a href="chalcocite">chalcocite</a>, CuS and <a href="covellite">covellite</a>, CuS. The main copper mineral <a href="chalcopyrite">chalcopyrite</a> (CuFeS) is not leached very efficiently, which is why the dominant copper-producing technology remains flotation, followed by smelting and refining. The leaching of CuFeS follows the two stages of being dissolved and then further oxidised, with Cu ions being left in solution.

<a href="Chalcopyrite">Chalcopyrite</a> leaching:
net reaction:

In general, <a href="sulfide">sulfide</a>s are first oxidized to elemental sulfur, whereas <a href="disulfide">disulfide</a>s are oxidized to give <a href="thiosulfate">thiosulfate</a>, and the processes above can be applied to other sulfidic ores. Bioleaching of non-sulfidic ores such as <a href="pitchblende">pitchblende</a> also uses ferric iron as an oxidant (e.g., UO + 2 Fe ==> UO + 2 Fe). In this case, the sole purpose of the bacterial step is the regeneration of Fe. Sulfidic <a href="iron%20ore">iron ore</a>s can be added to speed up the process and provide a source of iron. Bioleaching of non-sulfidic ores by layering of waste sulfides and elemental sulfur, colonized by "Acidithiobacillus" spp., has been accomplished, which provides a strategy for accelerated leaching of materials that do not contain sulfide minerals.

The dissolved copper (Cu) ions are removed from the solution by <a href="ligand">ligand</a> exchange solvent extraction, which leaves other ions in the solution. The copper is removed by bonding to a ligand, which is a large molecule consisting of a number of smaller <a href="functional%20group">groups</a>, each possessing a <a href="lone%20electron%20pair">lone electron pair</a>. The ligand-copper complex is extracted from the solution using an <a href="organic%20compound">organic</a> solvent such as <a href="kerosene">kerosene</a>:

The ligand donates electrons to the copper, producing a <a href="complex%20%28chemistry%29">complex</a> - a central metal <a href="atom">atom</a> (copper) bonded to the ligand. Because this complex has no <a href="electric%20charge">charge</a>, it is no longer attracted to <a href="polar%20molecule">polar</a> water molecules and dissolves in the kerosene, which is then easily separated from the solution. Because the initial <a href="chemical%20reaction">reaction</a> is <a href="reversible%20reaction">reversible</a>, it is determined by pH. Adding concentrated acid reverses the equation, and the copper ions go back into an aqueous solution.

Then the copper is passed through an electro-winning process to increase its purity: An <a href="electric%20current">electric current</a> is passed through the resulting solution of copper ions. Because copper ions have a 2+ charge, they are attracted to the negative <a href="cathode">cathode</a>s and collect there.

The copper can also be concentrated and separated by <a href="single%20displacement%20reaction">displacing</a> the copper with Fe from scrap iron:

The electrons lost by the iron are taken up by the copper. Copper is the oxidising agent (it accepts electrons), and iron is the reducing agent (it loses electrons).

Traces of precious metals such as gold may be left in the original solution. Treating the mixture with <a href="sodium%20cyanide">sodium cyanide</a> in the presence of free oxygen dissolves the gold. The gold is removed from the solution by <a href="adsorption">adsorbing</a> (taking it up on the surface) to <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a>.

Several species of <a href="Fungus">fungi</a> can be used for bioleaching. Fungi can be grown on many different substrates, such as <a href="e-waste">electronic scrap</a>, <a href="catalytic%20converter">catalytic converter</a>s, and <a href="fly%20ash">fly ash</a> from municipal waste <a href="incineration">incineration</a>. Experiments have shown that two fungal <a href="strain%20%28biology%29">strains</a> ("Aspergillus niger, Penicillium simplicissimum") were able to mobilize Cu and Sn by 65%, and Al, Ni, Pb, and Zn by more than 95%. "Aspergillus niger" can produce some organic acids such as <a href="citric%20acid">citric acid</a>. This form of leaching does not rely on microbial oxidation of metal but rather uses microbial metabolism as source of acids that directly dissolve the metal.

Extractions involve many expensive steps such as <a href="Roasting%20%28metallurgy%29">roasting</a> and <a href="smelting">smelting</a>, which require sufficient concentrations of <a href="chemical%20element">elements</a> in ores and are environmentally unfriendly. Low concentrations are not a problem for bacteria because they simply ignore the waste that surrounds the metals, attaining extraction yields of over 90% in some cases. These <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a>s actually gain <a href="energy">energy</a> by breaking down minerals into their constituent elements. The company simply collects the <a href="ion">ion</a>s out of the <a href="solution">solution</a> after the bacteria have finished. There is a limited amount of ores.



At the current time, it is more economical to smelt copper ore rather than to use bioleaching, since the concentration of copper in its ore is in general quite high. The profit obtained from the speed and yield of smelting justifies its cost. Nonetheless, at the largest copper mine of the world, <a href="Escondida">Escondida</a> in <a href="Chile">Chile</a> the process seems to be favorable.

However, the concentration of gold in its ore is in general very low. In this case, the lower cost of bacterial leaching outweighs the time it takes to extract the metal.
Economically it is also very expensive and many companies once started can not keep up with the demand and end up in debt. Projects like Finnish <a href="Talvivaara">Talvivaara</a> proved to be environmentally and economically disastrous.

Bouldering

Bouldering is a form of <a href="rock%20climbing">rock climbing</a> that is performed on large <a href="boulder">boulder</a>s, small rock formations or artificial <a href="climbing%20wall">rock walls</a>, without the use of ropes or <a href="Climbing%20harness">harnesses</a>. While it can be done without any equipment whatsoever, most climbers use <a href="climbing%20shoe">climbing shoe</a>s to help secure footholds, <a href="Magnesium%20carbonate">chalk</a> to keep their hands dry and provide a firmer grip, and <a href="bouldering%20mat">bouldering mat</a>s to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike <a href="free%20solo%20climbing">free solo climbing</a>, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the path that a climber takes in order to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20 ft.) tall. <a href="Indoor%20climbing">Artificial climbing walls</a> allow boulderers to train indoors in areas without natural boulders. <a href="Competition%20climbing">Bouldering competitions</a>, which employ a variety of formats, take place in both indoor and outdoor settings.

The sport originated as a method of training for roped climbs and <a href="mountaineering">mountaineering</a>. Bouldering enabled climbers to practice specific moves at a safe distance from the ground. Additionally, the sport served to build stamina and increase finger strength. Throughout the 1900s, bouldering evolved into a separate discipline. Individual problems are assigned ratings based on their difficulty. There have been many different <a href="Grade%20%28bouldering%29">rating systems</a> used throughout the history of the sport, but modern problems usually use either the V-scale or the <a href="Fontainebleau%20rock%20climbing">Fontainebleau</a> scale.

The growing popularity of the sport has caused several environmental concerns, including soil <a href="erosion">erosion</a> and trampled vegetation as climbers hike off-trail to reach bouldering sites. This has caused some landowners to restrict access or prohibit bouldering altogether.

Bouldering is a form of <a href="rock%20climbing">rock climbing</a> which takes place on large <a href="boulder">boulder</a>s and other small rock formations, usually measuring less than from ground to top, but in some cases can measure up to 30+ ft. Unlike <a href="top%20rope%20climbing">top rope climbing</a> and <a href="lead%20climbing">lead climbing</a>, no ropes are used to protect or aid the climber. Bouldering routes or "problems" require the climber to reach the top of a boulder, usually from a specified start position. Some boulder problems, known as "traverses," require the climber to climb horizontally from one position to another.

The characteristics of boulder problems depend largely on the type of rock being climbed. <a href="Granite">Granite</a>, for example, often features long <a href="Crack%20climbing">cracks</a> and <a href="slab%20climbing">slab</a>s. <a href="Sandstone">Sandstone</a> rocks are known for their steep overhangs and frequent horizontal breaks. Other common bouldering rocks include <a href="limestone">limestone</a> and <a href="volcanic%20rock">volcanic rock</a>.

There are many prominent bouldering areas throughout the United States, including <a href="Hueco%20Tanks">Hueco Tanks</a> in Texas, <a href="Mount%20Evans">Mount Evans</a> in Colorado, and <a href="The%20Buttermilks">The Buttermilks</a> in <a href="Bishop%2C%20California">Bishop, California</a>. <a href="Squamish%2C%20British%20Columbia">Squamish, British Columbia</a> is one of the most popular bouldering areas in Canada. Europe also hosts a number of bouldering sites, such as <a href="Fontainebleau">Fontainebleau</a> in France, <a href="Albarrac%C3%ADn">Albarracín</a> in Spain, and various mountains throughout <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>.

Artificial climbing walls are used to simulate boulder problems in an indoor environment, usually at <a href="climbing%20gym">climbing gym</a>s. These walls are constructed with wooden panels, <a href="polymer">polymer</a> cement panels, <a href="concrete">concrete</a> shells, or precast molds of actual rock walls. Holds, usually made of <a href="plastic">plastic</a>, are then bolted onto the wall to create problems. The walls often feature steep overhanging surfaces, forcing the climber to employ highly technical movements while supporting much of their weight with their upper body strength.

Climbing gyms often feature multiple problems within the same section of wall. In the US the most common method Routesetters use to designate the intended route for a particular problem is by placing colored tape next to each hold—for example, holds with red tape would indicate one bouldering problem, while green tape would be used to set off a different problem in the same area. Across much of the rest of the world problems and grades are usually designated by using a set color of plastic hold to indicate a particular problem. For example, green may be v0-v1, blue may be v2-v3 and so on. Setting via color has certain advantages, the most notable of which are that it makes it more obvious where the holds for a problem are, and that there is no chance of tape being accidentally kicked off of footholds. Smaller, resource-poor climbing gyms may prefer taped problems because large, expensive holds can be used in multiple routes simply by marking them with more than one color of tape.

Bouldering competitions occur in both indoor and outdoor settings. The <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20Sport%20Climbing">International Federation of Sport Climbing</a> (IFSC) employs an indoor format that breaks the competition into three rounds: qualifications, semi-finals, and finals. The rounds feature different sets of four or five boulder problems, and each competitor has a fixed amount of time to attempt each problem. At the end of each round, competitors are ranked by the number of completed problems, with ties settled by the total number of attempts taken to solve the problems.

There are several other formats used for bouldering competitions. Some competitions only permit climbers a fixed number of attempts at each problem with a timed rest period in between each attempt, unlike the IFSC format, in which competitors can use their allotted time however they choose. In an open-format competition, all climbers compete simultaneously, and are given a fixed amount of time to complete as many problems as possible. More points are awarded for more difficult problems, while points are deducted for multiple attempts on the same problem.

In 2012, the IFSC submitted a proposal to the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> (IOC) to include <a href="lead%20climbing">lead climbing</a> in the <a href="2020%20Summer%20Olympics">2020 Summer Olympics</a>. The proposal was later revised to an "overall" competition, which would feature bouldering, lead climbing, and <a href="speed%20climbing">speed climbing</a>. In May 2013, the IOC announced that climbing would not be added to the 2020 Olympic program.

In 2016, the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> (IOC) officially approved climbing as an Olympic sport "in order to appeal to younger audiences." The Olympics will feature the earlier proposed overall competition. Medalists will be competing in all three categories for a best overall score.

Rock climbing first known as a sport in the mid-1800s. Early records describe climbers engaging in what is now referred to as bouldering, not as a separate discipline, but as a form of training for larger ascents. In the early 20th century, the <a href="Fontainebleau">Fontainebleau</a> area of <a href="France">France</a> established itself as a prominent climbing area, where some of the first dedicated "bleausards" (or "boulderers") emerged. The specialized rock climbing shoe was invented by one such athlete, <a href="Pierre%20Allain">Pierre Allain</a>.

In the 1960s, the sport was pushed forward by American mathematician <a href="John%20Gill%20%28climber%29">John Gill</a>, who contributed several important innovations. Gill's previous athletic pursuit was <a href="gymnastics">gymnastics</a>, a sport which had an established scale of difficulty for particular movements and body positions. He applied this idea to bouldering, which shifted the focus from reaching a summit to navigating a specific sequence of holds. Gill developed a closed-ended rating system: B1 problems were as difficult as the most challenging roped routes of the time, B2 problems were more difficult, and B3 problems were those that had only been completed once.

Gill introduced <a href="magnesium%20carbonate">chalk</a> as a method of keeping the climber's hands dry. He also promoted a dynamic climbing style and emphasized the importance of <a href="strength%20training">strength training</a> to complement technical skill. These practices had not been popular among climbers, but as Gill's ability level and influence grew, his ideas became the norm.

Two important training tools emerged in the 1980s: <a href="Bouldering%20mat">Bouldering mat</a>s and artificial climbing walls. The former, also referred to as "crash pads", prevented injuries from falling, and enabled boulderers to climb in areas that would have been too dangerous to attempt otherwise. Indoor climbing walls helped spread the sport to areas without outdoor climbing, and allowed serious climbers to train year-round regardless of weather conditions.

As the sport grew in popularity, new bouldering areas were developed throughout Europe and the United States, and more athletes began participating in bouldering competitions. The visibility of the sport greatly increased in the early 2000s, as <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> videos and climbing <a href="blog">blog</a>s helped boulderers around the world to quickly learn techniques, find hard problems, and announce newly completed projects.

Unlike other climbing sports, bouldering can be performed safely and effectively with very little equipment, an aspect which makes the discipline highly appealing to many climbers. Bouldering pioneer <a href="John%20Sherman%20%28climber%29">John Sherman</a> asserted that "The only gear really needed to go bouldering is boulders". Others suggest the use of climbing shoes and a chalkbag as the bare minimum, while more experienced boulderers typically bring multiple pairs of shoes, chalk, brushes, crash pads, and a skincare kit.

Of the aforementioned equipment, climbing shoes have the most direct impact on performance. Besides protecting the climber's feet from rough surfaces, climbing shoes are designed to help the climber secure and maintain footholds. Climbing shoes typically fit much tighter than other athletic footwear, and often curl the toes downwards to enable precise footwork. They are manufactured in a variety of different styles in order to perform well in different situations: High-top shoes, for example, provide better protection for the ankle, while low-top shoes provide greater flexibility and freedom of movement. Stiffer shoes excel at securing small edges, whereas softer shoes provide greater sensitivity. The front of the shoe, called the "toe box", can be asymmetric, which performs well on overhanging rocks, or symmetric, which is better suited for vertical problems and <a href="slab%20climbing">slabs</a>.  

Most boulderers use <a href="magnesium%20carbonate">gymnastics chalk</a> on their hands to absorb <a href="sweat">sweat</a>. It is stored in a small chalkbag which can be tied around the waist, allowing the climber to reapply chalk during the climb. <a href="Brush">Brush</a>es are used to remove excess chalk and other debris from boulders in between climbs; they are often attached to the end of a stick, pipe, or other straight object in order to reach higher holds. Crash pads, also referred to as <a href="bouldering%20mat">bouldering mat</a>s, are foam cushions placed on the ground to protect climbers from falls.

Boulder problems are generally shorter than from ground to top. This makes the sport significantly safer than <a href="free%20solo%20climbing">free solo climbing</a>, which is also performed without ropes, but with no upper limit on the height of the climb. However, minor injuries are common in bouldering, particularly <a href="sprained%20ankle">sprained ankle</a>s and <a href="sprained%20wrist">wrists</a>. Two factors contribute to the frequency of injuries in bouldering: first, boulder problems typically feature more difficult moves than other climbing disciplines, making falls more common. Second, without ropes to arrest the climber's descent, every fall will cause the climber to hit the ground.

To prevent injuries, boulderers position <a href="bouldering%20mat">crash pads</a> near the boulder to provide a softer landing, as well as one or more <a href="Spotting%20%28climbing%29">spotters</a> to help redirect the climber towards the pads. Upon landing, boulderers employ falling techniques similar to those used in <a href="gymnastics">gymnastics</a>: spreading the impact across the entire body to avoid <a href="bone%20fracture">bone fracture</a>s, and positioning limbs to allow joints to move freely throughout the impact.

As with other forms of climbing, bouldering technique is largely centered on proper footwork. <a href="Leg%20muscles">Leg muscles</a> are significantly stronger than <a href="arm">arm muscles</a>; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.

Bouldering movements are described as either "static" or "dynamic". Static movements are those that are performed slowly, with the climber's position controlled by maintaining contact on the boulder with the other three limbs. Dynamic movements use the climber's <a href="momentum">momentum</a> to reach holds that would be difficult or impossible to secure statically, with an increased risk of falling if the movement is not performed accurately.

Bouldering problems are assigned numerical difficulty ratings by routesetters and climbers. The two most widely used rating systems are the V-scale and the Fontainebleau system.

The V-scale, which originated in the United States, is an open-ended rating system with higher numbers indicating a higher <a href="degree%20of%20difficulty">degree of difficulty</a>. The V1 rating indicates that a problem can be completed by a novice climber in good physical condition after several attempts. The scale begins at V0, and as of 2013, the highest V rating that has been assigned to a bouldering problem is V17. Some climbing gyms also use a VB grade to indicate beginner problems.

The Fontainebleau scale follows a similar system, with each numerical grade divided into three ratings with the letters "a", "b", and "c". For example, Fontainebleau 7A roughly corresponds with V6, while Fontainebleau 7C+ is equivalent to V10. In both systems, grades are further differentiated by appending "+" to indicate a small increase in difficulty. Despite this level of specificity, ratings of individual problems are often controversial, as ability level is not the only factor that affects how difficult a problem will be for a particular climber. Height, arm length, <a href="flexibility">flexibility</a>, and other body characteristics can also be relevant.

Bouldering can damage vegetation that grows on rocks, such as <a href="moss">moss</a>es and <a href="lichen">lichen</a>s. This can occur as a result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. <a href="Soil%20erosion">Soil erosion</a> can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer. Other environmental concerns include <a href="littering">littering</a>, improperly disposed <a href="feces">feces</a>, and <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a>. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, as was the case in Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in <a href="Rocklands%2C%20South%20Africa">Rocklands, South Africa</a>.

Boiling point

The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the <a href="vapor%20pressure">vapor pressure</a> of the <a href="liquid">liquid</a> equals the <a href="pressure">pressure</a> surrounding the liquid and the liquid changes into a vapor.

The boiling point of a liquid varies depending upon the surrounding environmental pressure. A liquid in a partial <a href="vacuum">vacuum</a> has a lower boiling point than when that liquid is at <a href="atmospheric%20pressure">atmospheric pressure</a>. A liquid at high pressure has a higher boiling point than when that liquid is at atmospheric pressure. For a given pressure, different liquids <a href="boiling">boil</a> at different temperatures. For example, water boils at at sea level, but at at altitude.

The normal boiling point (also called the atmospheric boiling point or the atmospheric pressure boiling point) of a liquid is the special case in which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the defined atmospheric pressure at sea level, 1 <a href="Atmosphere%20%28unit%29">atmosphere</a>. At that temperature, the vapor pressure of the liquid becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and allow bubbles of vapor to form inside the bulk of the liquid. The standard boiling point has been defined by <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">IUPAC</a> since 1982 as the temperature at which boiling occurs under a pressure of 1 <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">bar</a>.

The <a href="heat%20of%20vaporization">heat of vaporization</a> is the energy required to transform a given quantity (a mol, kg, pound, etc.) of a substance from a liquid into a gas at a given pressure (often atmospheric pressure).

Liquids may change to a vapor at temperatures below their boiling points through the process of <a href="evaporation">evaporation</a>. Evaporation is a surface phenomenon in which molecules located near the liquid's edge, not contained by enough liquid pressure on that side, escape into the surroundings as <a href="vapor">vapor</a>. On the other hand, <a href="boiling">boiling</a> is a process in which molecules anywhere in the liquid escape, resulting in the formation of vapor bubbles within the liquid.

A "saturated liquid" contains as much thermal energy as it can without boiling (or conversely a "saturated vapor" contains as little thermal energy as it can without <a href="Condensation">condensing</a>).

Saturation temperature means "boiling point". The saturation temperature is the temperature for a corresponding saturation pressure at which a liquid boils into its <a href="Gas">vapor phase</a>. The liquid can be said to be saturated with <a href="thermal%20energy">thermal energy</a>. Any addition of thermal energy results in a <a href="phase%20transition">phase transition</a>.

If the pressure in a system remains constant (<a href="Isobaric%20process">isobaric</a>), a vapor at saturation temperature will begin to condense into its liquid phase as thermal energy (<a href="heat">heat</a>) is removed. Similarly, a liquid at saturation temperature and pressure will boil into its vapor phase as additional thermal energy is applied.

The boiling point corresponds to the temperature at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the surrounding environmental pressure. Thus, the boiling point is dependent on the pressure. Boiling points may be published with respect to the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">NIST, USA</a> <a href="Standard%20conditions%20for%20temperature%20and%20pressure">standard pressure</a> of 101.325 <a href="kilopascal">kPa</a> (or 1 <a href="atmospheric%20pressure">atm</a>), or the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">IUPAC</a> standard pressure of 100.000 kPa. At higher elevations, where the atmospheric pressure is much lower, the boiling point is also lower. The boiling point increases with increased pressure up to the <a href="critical%20point%20%28thermodynamics%29">critical point</a>, where the gas and liquid properties become identical. The boiling point cannot be increased beyond the critical point. Likewise, the boiling point decreases with decreasing pressure until the <a href="triple%20point">triple point</a> is reached. The boiling point cannot be reduced below the triple point.

If the heat of vaporization and the vapor pressure of a liquid at a certain temperature are known, the boiling point can be calculated by using the <a href="Clausius%E2%80%93Clapeyron%20equation">Clausius–Clapeyron equation</a>, thus:

where:

Saturation pressure is the pressure for a corresponding saturation temperature at which a liquid boils into its vapor phase. Saturation pressure and saturation temperature have a direct relationship: as saturation pressure is increased, so is saturation temperature.

If the temperature in a <a href="system">system</a> remains constant (an "<a href="isothermal">isothermal</a>" system), vapor at saturation pressure and temperature will begin to <a href="condensation">condense</a> into its liquid phase as the system pressure is increased. Similarly, a liquid at saturation pressure and temperature will tend to <a href="Flash%20evaporation">flash</a> into its vapor phase as system pressure is decreased.

There are two conventions regarding the "standard boiling point of water": The "normal boiling point" is at a pressure of 1 atm (i.e., 101.325 kPa). The IUPAC recommended "standard boiling point of water" at a standard pressure of 100 kPa (1 bar) is . For comparison, on top of <a href="Mount%20Everest">Mount Everest</a>, at elevation, the pressure is about and the boiling point of water is .
The Celsius temperature scale was defined until 1954 by two points: 0 °C being defined by the water freezing point and 100 °C being defined by the water boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure.

The higher the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature, the lower the normal boiling point (i.e., the boiling point at atmospheric pressure) of the liquid.

The vapor pressure chart to the right has graphs of the vapor pressures versus temperatures for a variety of liquids. As can be seen in the chart, the liquids with the highest vapor pressures have the lowest normal boiling points.

For example, at any given temperature, <a href="methyl%20chloride">methyl chloride</a> has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart. It also has the lowest normal boiling point (−24.2 °C), which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride (the blue line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere (<a href="Atmosphere%20%28unit%29">atm</a>) of absolute vapor pressure.

The <a href="Critical%20point%20%28thermodynamics%29">critical point</a> of a liquid is the highest temperature (and pressure) it will actually boil at.

See also <a href="Vapour%20pressure%20of%20water">Vapour pressure of water</a>.

The element with the lowest boiling point is <a href="helium">helium</a>. Both the boiling points of <a href="rhenium">rhenium</a> and <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a> exceed 5000 <a href="kelvin">K</a> at <a href="standard%20pressure">standard pressure</a>; because it is difficult to measure extreme temperatures precisely without bias, both have been cited in the literature as having the higher boiling point.

As can be seen from the above plot of the logarithm of the vapor pressure vs. the temperature for any given pure <a href="chemical%20compound">chemical compound</a>, its normal boiling point can serve as an indication of that compound's overall <a href="Volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatility</a>. A given pure compound has only one normal boiling point, if any, and a compound's normal boiling point and <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a> can serve as characteristic <a href="Physical%20property">physical properties</a> for that compound, listed in reference books. The higher a compound's normal boiling point, the less volatile that compound is overall, and conversely, the lower a compound's normal boiling point, the more volatile that compound is overall. Some compounds decompose at higher temperatures before reaching their normal boiling point, or sometimes even their melting point. For a stable compound, the boiling point ranges from its <a href="triple%20point">triple point</a> to its <a href="Critical%20point%20%28thermodynamics%29">critical point</a>, depending on the external pressure. Beyond its triple point, a compound's normal boiling point, if any, is higher than its melting point. Beyond the critical point, a compound's liquid and vapor phases merge into one phase, which may be called a superheated gas. At any given temperature, if a compound's normal boiling point is lower, then that compound will generally exist as a gas at atmospheric external pressure. If the compound's normal boiling point is higher, then that compound can exist as a liquid or solid at that given temperature at atmospheric external pressure, and will so exist in equilibrium with its vapor (if volatile) if its vapors are contained. If a compound's vapors are not contained, then some volatile compounds can eventually evaporate away in spite of their higher boiling points.
In general, compounds with <a href="ionic%20bond">ionic bond</a>s have high normal boiling points, if they do not decompose before reaching such high temperatures. Many <a href="metal">metal</a>s have high boiling points, but not all. Very generally—with other factors being equal—in compounds with covalently bonded <a href="molecule">molecule</a>s, as the size of the molecule (or <a href="molecular%20mass">molecular mass</a>) increases, the normal boiling point increases. When the molecular size becomes that of a <a href="macromolecule">macromolecule</a>, <a href="polymer">polymer</a>, or otherwise very large, the compound often decomposes at high temperature before the boiling point is reached. Another factor that affects the normal boiling point of a compound is the <a href="Polarity%20%28chemistry%29">polarity</a> of its molecules. As the polarity of a compound's molecules increases, its normal boiling point increases, other factors being equal. Closely related is the ability of a molecule to form <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s (in the liquid state), which makes it harder for molecules to leave the liquid state and thus increases the normal boiling point of the compound. Simple <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a>s dimerize by forming hydrogen bonds between molecules. A minor factor affecting boiling points is the shape of a molecule. Making the shape of a molecule more compact tends to lower the normal boiling point slightly compared to an equivalent molecule with more surface area.

Most volatile compounds (anywhere near ambient temperatures) go through an intermediate liquid phase while warming up from a solid phase to eventually transform to a vapor phase. By comparison to boiling, a <a href="Sublimation%20%28phase%20transition%29">sublimation</a> is a physical transformation in which a solid turns directly into vapor, which happens in a few select cases such as with <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> at atmospheric pressure. For such compounds, a <a href="sublimation%20point">sublimation point</a> is a temperature at which a solid turning directly into vapor has a vapor pressure equal to the external pressure.

In the preceding section, boiling points of pure compounds were covered. Vapor pressures and boiling points of substances can be affected by the presence of dissolved impurities (<a href="Solution">solutes</a>) or other miscible compounds, the degree of effect depending on the concentration of the impurities or other compounds. The presence of non-volatile impurities such as <a href="Salt%20%28chemistry%29">salts</a> or compounds of a <a href="Volatility%20%28chemistry%29">volatility</a> far lower than the main component compound decreases its <a href="mole%20fraction">mole fraction</a> and the <a href="Solution%20%28chemistry%29">solution's</a> volatility, and thus raises the normal boiling point in proportion to the <a href="concentration">concentration</a> of the solutes. This effect is called <a href="boiling%20point%20elevation">boiling point elevation</a>. As a common example, <a href="Saline%20water">salt water</a> boils at a higher temperature than pure water.

In other mixtures of miscible compounds (components), there may be two or more components of varying volatility, each having its own pure component boiling point at any given pressure. The presence of other volatile components in a mixture affects the vapor pressures and thus boiling points and <a href="dew%20point">dew point</a>s of all the components in the mixture. The dew point is a temperature at which a vapor <a href="Condensation">condenses</a> into a liquid. Furthermore, at any given temperature, the composition of the vapor is different from the composition of the liquid in most such cases. In order to illustrate these effects between the volatile components in a mixture, a boiling point diagram is commonly used. <a href="Distillation">Distillation</a> is a process of boiling and [usually] condensation which takes advantage of these differences in composition between liquid and vapor phases.
