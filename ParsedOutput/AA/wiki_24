Armageddon

According to the <a href="Book%20of%20Revelation">Book of Revelation</a> in the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>, Armageddon (, from "Harmagedōn", <a href="Late%20Latin">Late Latin</a>: , from Hebrew: הר מגידו Har Megiddo) is the prophesied location of a gathering of armies for a battle during the <a href="end%20time">end time</a>s, variously interpreted as either a literal or a symbolic location. The term is also used in a generic sense to refer to any <a href="eschatology">end of the world</a> scenario.

"Mount" <a href="Tel%20Megiddo">Tel Megiddo</a> is not actually a <a href="mountain">mountain</a>, but a <a href="Tell%20%28archaeology%29">tell</a> (a hill created by many generations of people living and rebuilding on the same spot) on which ancient forts were built to guard the <a href="Via%20Maris">Via Maris</a>, an ancient <a href="trade%20route">trade route</a> linking <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> with the northern empires of <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> and <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. Megiddo was the location of various ancient battles, including <a href="Battle%20of%20Megiddo%20%2815th%20century%20BC%29">one in the 15th century BC</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Megiddo%20%28609%20BC%29">one in 609 BC</a>. Modern <a href="Megiddo%2C%20Israel">Megiddo</a> is a town approximately west-southwest of the southern tip of the <a href="Sea%20of%20Galilee">Sea of Galilee</a> in the <a href="Kishon%20River">Kishon River</a> area in Israel.

The word "Armageddon" appears only once in the <a href="Novum%20Testamentum%20Graece">Greek New Testament</a>, in . The word is translated to Greek from <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> "har məgiddô" (), "har" (<a href="Strong%27s%20Concordance">Strong</a> H2022) meaning "a mountain or range of hills (sometimes used figuratively): - hill (country), mount (-ain), X promotion." This is a shortened form of "Harar" (<a href="Strong%27s%20Concordance">Strong</a> H2042) "to loom up; a mountain; -hill, mount". "Megiddo" (<a href="Strong%27s%20Concordance">Strong</a> מְגִדּוֹן H4023) /meg-id-do'/ "Megiddon or Megiddo, a place of crowds.") The name refers to a fortification made by <a href="Ahab">King Ahab</a> (869-50 BC) that dominated the <a href="Jezreel%20Valley">Plain of Jezreel</a>.

Megiddo is mentioned twelve times in the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>, ten times in reference to the ancient city of <a href="Tel%20Megiddo">Megiddo</a>, and twice with reference to "the plain of Megiddo", most probably simply meaning "the plain next to the city".
None of these Old Testament passages describes the city of Megiddo as being associated with any particular prophetic beliefs. The one <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> reference to the city of Armageddon found in in fact also makes no specific mention of any armies being predicted to one day gather in this city, but instead seems to predict only that "they (will gather) the kings together to ... Armageddon". 
The text does however seem to imply, based on the text from the earlier passage of Revelation 16:14, that the purpose of this gathering of kings in the "place called Armageddon" is "for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty".  Because of the seemingly highly symbolic and even cryptic language of this one New Testament passage, some Christian scholars conclude that Mount Armageddon must be an idealized location. <a href="Rousas%20John%20Rushdoony">Rushdoony</a> says, "There are no mountains of Megiddo, only the Plains of Megiddo. This is a deliberate destruction of the vision of any literal reference to the place." 
Other scholars, including <a href="C.%20C.%20Torrey">C. C. Torrey</a>, <a href="Meredith%20G.%20Kline">Kline</a> and <a href="James%20B.%20Jordan">Jordan</a> argue that the word is derived from the <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> "moed" (), meaning "assembly".  Thus, "Armageddon" would mean "Mountain of Assembly," which Jordan says is "a reference to the assembly at Mount Sinai, and to its replacement, Mount Zion."

The traditional viewpoint interprets this Bible prophecy to be symbolic of the progression of the world toward the "great day of God, the Almighty" in which the great looming mountain of God's just and holy wrath is poured out against unrepentant sinners, led by Satan, in a literal end-of-the-world final confrontation. Armageddon is the symbolic name given to this event based on scripture references regarding divine obliteration of God's enemies. The hermeneutical method supports this position by referencing Judges 4 and 5 where God miraculously destroys the enemy of His elect, Israel, at Megiddo, also called the <a href="Valley%20of%20Josaphat">Valley of Josaphat</a>.

Christian scholar <a href="William%20Hendriksen">William Hendriksen</a> says:
The <a href="Dispensationalism">Dispensational</a> viewpoint interprets biblical prophecy literally and expects that the fulfillment of prophecy will also be literal, depending upon the context of scripture.  In his discussion of Armageddon, <a href="J.%20Dwight%20Pentecost">J. Dwight Pentecost</a> has devoted an entire chapter to the subject, titled "The Campaign of Armageddon", in which he discusses Armageddon as a campaign and not a specific <a href="battle">battle</a>, which will be fought in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. Pentecost writes:
Pentecost then discusses the location of this campaign, and mentions the "hill of Megiddo" and other geographic locations such as "the <a href="Valley%20of%20Josaphat">valley of Jehoshaphat</a>" and "the valley of the passengers", "Lord coming from <a href="Edom">Edom</a> or Idumea, south of <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, when He returns from <a href="Last%20judgment">the judgment</a>"; and Jerusalem itself.

Pentecost further describes the area involved:
Pentecost then outlines the biblical time period for this campaign to occur and with further arguments concludes that it must take place with the <a href="Prophecy%20of%20Seventy%20Weeks">70th week of Daniel</a>. The invasion of Israel by the Northern Confederacy "will bring the Beast and his armies to the defense of Israel as her protector". He then uses <a href="Book%20of%20Daniel">Daniel</a> to further clarify his thinking: (Dan. 11:40b-45).

Again, events are listed by Pentecost in his book:

After the destruction of the Beast at the <a href="Second%20Coming">Second Coming</a> of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20God">promised Kingdom</a> is set up, in which Jesus and the <a href="Saints">Saints</a> will rule for a <a href="Millennialism">thousand years</a>. Satan is then loosed "for a season" and goes out to deceive the nations, specifically, Gog and Magog. The army mentioned attacks the Saints in the <a href="New%20Jerusalem">New Jerusalem</a>, they are defeated by a judgment of fire coming down from Heaven, and then comes the <a href="Great%20White%20Throne">Great White Throne</a> judgment, which includes all of those through the ages and these are cast into the <a href="Lake%20of%20Fire">Lake of Fire</a>, which event is also known as the "second death" and Gehenna, not to be confused with Hell, which is Satan's domain. Pentecost describes this as follows:

<a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> believe that Armageddon is the means by which <a href="God">God</a> will fulfill his purpose for the Earth to be populated with happy healthy humans free of <a href="sin">sin</a> and death. They teach that the <a href="Heavenly%20host">armies of heaven</a> will eradicate all who oppose the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20God%20%28Christian%20denominational%20variations%29%23Jehovah.27s%20Witnesses">Kingdom of God</a>, wiping out all wicked humans on Earth, leaving only righteous mankind.

They believe that the gathering of all the nations of the earth refers to the uniting of the world's political powers, as a gradual process beginning in 1914 and seen later in manifestations such as the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> and the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> following the First and Second World Wars. These political powers are said to be influenced by <a href="Satan">Satan</a> and his demons in opposition to God's kingdom. <a href="Babylon%20the%20Great">Babylon the Great</a> is interpreted as the world empire of false religion, and that it will be destroyed by the beast just prior to Armageddon. Witnesses believe that after all other religions have been destroyed, the governments will turn to persecute them, and that God will then intervene, precipitating Armageddon.
Jehovah's Witnesses teach that the armies of heaven, led by Jesus, will then destroy all forms of human government and then Jesus, along with a selected <a href="144%2C000%23Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">144,000</a> humans, will rule Earth for 1,000 years. They believe that Satan and his demons will be bound for that period, unable to influence mankind. After the 1,000 years are ended, and the second resurrection has taken place, <a href="Satan">Satan</a> is released and allowed to tempt the perfect human race one last time. Those who follow Satan are destroyed, along with him, leaving the earth, and humankind at peace with God forever, free of sin and death.

The religion's current teaching on Armageddon originated in 1925 with former <a href="Watch%20Tower%20Bible%20and%20Tract%20Society%20of%20Pennsylvania">Watch Tower Society</a> president <a href="Joseph%20Franklin%20Rutherford">J. F. Rutherford</a>, who based his interpretations on the books of Exodus, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Psalms as well as additional material from the books of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles. The doctrine marked a further break from the teachings of Watch Tower Society founder <a href="Charles%20Taze%20Russell">Charles Taze Russell</a>, who for decades had taught that the final war would be an anarchistic struggle for domination on earth. Tony Wills, author of a historical study of Jehovah's Witnesses, claimed that Rutherford seemed to relish his descriptions of how completely the wicked would be destroyed at Armageddon, dwelling at great length on prophecies of destruction. He stated that towards the close of his ministry Rutherford allocated about half the space available in "The Watchtower" magazines to discussion of Armageddon.

The teachings of the <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a> state that the terms "Armageddon", "Day of the Lord" and "The Second Coming of Christ" all describe the same event. Seventh-day Adventists further teach that the current religious movements taking place in the world are setting the stage for Armageddon, and they are concerned by an anticipated unity between <a href="spiritualism">spiritualism</a>, American <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a> and <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholicism</a>. A further significant difference in <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist%20theology">Seventh-day Adventist theology</a> is the teaching that the events of Armageddon will leave the earth desolate for the duration of the <a href="premillennialism">millennium</a>. They teach that the righteous will be taken to heaven while the rest of humanity will be destroyed, leaving Satan with no one to tempt and effectively "bound." The final re-creation of a "new heaven and a new earth." then follows the millennium.

For <a href="Christadelphians">Christadelphians</a>, Armageddon marks the "great climax of history when the nations would be gathered together 'into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon', and the judgment on them would herald the setting up of the Kingdom of God." 

In <a href="Ahmadiyya">Ahmadiyya</a>, Armageddon is viewed as a spiritual battle or struggle in the present age between the forces of good, i.e. righteousness, purity and virtue, and the forces of evil. The final struggle between the two comes as satanic influence is let loose with the emergence of <a href="Gog%20and%20Magog%23In%20Ahmadiyya">Gog and Magog</a>. <a href="Satan">Satan</a> gathers all his powers, and uses all his methods to mislead people, introducing an age where iniquity, promiscuity, atheism, and materialism abound.

Ahmadiyya believe that <a href="God">God</a> appointed <a href="Mirza%20Ghulam%20Ahmad">Promised Messiah</a> and <a href="Mahdi">Mahdi</a> for the spiritual reformation and moral direction of mankind. This age continues for approximately one thousand years as per Judeo-Christian and Islamic prophecies of the <a href="Apocalypse">Apocalypse</a>; it is characterised by the assembling of mankind under one faith, Islam in Ahmadiyya belief.

From <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Bahá'í</a> literature a number of interpretations of the expectations surrounding the Battle of Armageddon may be inferred, three of them being associated with events surrounding the World Wars.

The first interpretation deals with a series of tablets written by <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27u%27ll%C3%A1h">Bahá'u'lláh</a>, founder of the Bahá'í Faith, to be sent to various kings and rulers. The second, and best-known one, relates to events near the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> involving <a href="Edmund%20Allenby%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Allenby">General Allenby</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Megiddo%20%281918%29">Battle of Megiddo (1918)</a> wherein World Powers are said to have drawn soldiers from many parts of the world to engage in battle at Megiddo. In winning this battle Allenby also prevented the <a href="Turkish%20people">Turks</a> from killing <a href="%27Abdu%27l-Baha">'Abdu'l-Baha</a>, then head of the <a href="Baha%27i%20Faith">Baha'i Faith</a>, whom they had intended to <a href="crucify">crucify</a>. A third interpretation reviews the overall progress of the World Wars, and the situation in the world before and after.

The idea that a final Battle of Armageddon will be fought at <a href="Tel%20Megiddo">Tel Megiddo</a> has had a wide influence, especially in the US. According to Donald E. Wagner, Professor of Religion and Director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at <a href="North%20Park%20University">North Park University</a>, <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> was an adherent of "Armageddon theology," and "seemed to blend his political analysis with his Armageddon theology quite naturally."

An <a href="Militia%20organizations%20in%20the%20United%20States">American militia group</a> called <a href="Hutaree">Hutaree</a>, based on the idea that it will soon defend itself from the Antichrist's armies, received wide attention in 2010, when several members were indicted for plotting to kill a police officer and plant roadside bombs along the funeral procession. The charges were dismissed.

Athlon

Athlon is the brand name applied to a series of <a href="x86">x86-compatible</a> <a href="microprocessor">microprocessor</a>s designed and manufactured by <a href="Advanced%20Micro%20Devices">Advanced Micro Devices</a> (AMD). The original Athlon (now called "Athlon Classic") was the first seventh-generation x86 processor. The original Athlon was the first desktop processor to reach speeds of one gigahertz (GHz). AMD has continued using the "Athlon" name with the <a href="Athlon%2064">Athlon 64</a>, an eighth-generation processor featuring <a href="x86-64">x86-64</a> (later renamed AMD64) architecture, and the <a href="Athlon%20II">Athlon II</a>. AMD also uses the "Athlon" name for some of its series of <a href="Accelerated%20Processing%20Unit">APUs</a> targeting the <a href="Socket%20AM1">Socket AM1</a> desktop <a href="System%20on%20a%20chip">SoC</a> architecture.

The Athlon made its debut on June 23, 1999. Athlon comes from the Ancient Greek ("athlon") meaning ″(sport) contest″, or "prize of a contest", or "place of a contest; arena".

AMD founder (and then-CEO) <a href="Jerry%20Sanders%20%28businessman%29">Jerry Sanders</a> aggressively pursued strategic partnerships and engineering talent in the late 1990s, desiring to leverage the success AMD had gained in the PC market with the preceding <a href="AMD%20K6">AMD K6</a> line of processors. One major partnership announced in 1998 paired AMD with semiconductor giant <a href="Motorola">Motorola</a> to co-develop <a href="Copper-based%20chips">copper-based semiconductor technology</a>, and resulted with the K7 project being the first commercial processor to utilize copper <a href="Semiconductor%20device%20fabrication">fabrication technology</a>. In the announcement, Sanders referred to the partnership as creating a "virtual gorilla" that would enable AMD to compete with Intel on fabrication capacity while limiting AMD's financial outlay for new facilities.

The K7 design team was led by <a href="Dirk%20Meyer">Dirk Meyer</a>, who had worked as a lead engineer at <a href="Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation">DEC</a> on multiple <a href="DEC%20Alpha">Alpha</a> microprocessors during his employment at DEC. When DEC was sold to <a href="Compaq">Compaq</a> in 1998, the company discontinued Alpha processor development. Sanders approached many of the Alpha engineering staff as Compaq/DEC wound down their semiconductor business, and was able to bring in nearly all of the Alpha design team. The K7 engineering design team was thus now consisted of both the previously acquired <a href="NexGen">NexGen</a> K6 team (already including engineers such as <a href="Vinod%20Dham">Vinod Dham</a>) and the nearly complete Alpha design team.

In August 1999, AMD released the Athlon (K7) processor.

By working with Motorola, AMD was able to refine copper interconnect manufacturing to the production stage about one year before Intel. The revised process permitted <a href="180%20nm">180-nanometer</a> processor production. The accompanying die-shrink resulted in lower power consumption, permitting AMD to increase Athlon clock speeds to the 1 GHz range. Yields on the new process exceeded expectations, permitting AMD to deliver high speed chips in volume in March 2000.

The Athlon architecture also used the <a href="Alpha%2021264%23External%20interface">EV6</a> bus licensed from DEC as its main system bus. Intel required licensing to use the <a href="Gunning%20transceiver%20logic">GTL+</a> bus used by its <a href="Slot%201">Slot 1</a> Pentium II and later processors. By licensing the EV6 bus used by the Alpha line of processors from DEC, AMD was able to develop its own chipsets and motherboards, and avoid being dependent on licensing from its direct competitor.

Internally, the Athlon is a fully seventh generation x86 processor, the first of its kind. Like the AMD K5 and K6, the Athlon dynamically buffers internal micro-instructions at runtime resulting from parallel x86 instruction decoding. The CPU is an <a href="Out-of-order%20execution">out-of-order</a> design, again like previous post-5x86 AMD CPUs. The Athlon utilizes the <a href="Alpha%2021264">Alpha 21264</a>'s EV6 bus architecture with <a href="double%20data%20rate">double data rate</a> (DDR) technology. This means that at 100 MHz, the Athlon front side bus actually transfers at a rate similar to a 200 MHz single data rate bus (referred to as 200 <a href="Transfer%20%28computing%29">MT/s</a>), which was superior to the method used on Intel's <a href="Pentium%20III">Pentium III</a> (with SDR bus speeds of 100 MHz and 133 MHz).

AMD designed the CPU with more robust x86 instruction decoding capabilities than that of K6, to enhance its ability to keep more data in-flight at once. The Athlon's three decoders could potentially decode three x86 instructions to six microinstructions per clock, although this was somewhat unlikely in real-world use. The critical branch predictor unit, essential to keeping the pipeline busy, was enhanced compared to what was on board the K6. Deeper pipelining with more stages allowed higher clock speeds to be attained. Whereas the <a href="AMD%20K6-III">AMD K6-III</a>+ topped out at 570 MHz due to its short pipeline, even when built on the 180 nm process, the Athlon was capable of clocking much higher.

AMD ended its long-time handicap with <a href="floating%20point">floating point</a> <a href="x87">x87</a> performance by designing a super-<a href="Pipeline%20%28computing%29">pipelined</a>, out-of-order, triple-issue <a href="floating%20point%20unit">floating point unit</a>. Each of its three units was tailored to be able to calculate an optimal type of instructions with some redundancy. By having separate units, it was possible to operate on more than one floating point instruction at once. This FPU was a huge step forward for AMD. While the K6 FPU had looked anemic compared to the Intel <a href="P6%20%28microarchitecture%29">P6</a> FPU, with Athlon this was no longer the case.

The <a href="3DNow%21">3DNow!</a> <a href="floating%20point">floating point</a> <a href="SIMD">SIMD</a> technology, again present, received some revisions and a name change to "Enhanced 3DNow!". Additions included <a href="digital%20signal%20processing">DSP</a> instructions and an implementation of the <a href="extended%20MMX">extended MMX</a> subset of <a href="Streaming%20SIMD%20Extensions">Intel SSE</a>.

The Athlon's <a href="CPU%20cache">CPU cache</a> consisted of the typical two levels. Athlon was the first x86 processor with a 128 <a href="kilobyte">kB</a> split level 1 cache; a <a href="CPU%20cache">2-way associative</a> cache separated into 2×64 kB for data and instructions (a concept from <a href="Harvard%20architecture">Harvard architecture</a>). This cache was double the size of K6's already large 2×32 kB cache, and quadruple the size of <a href="Pentium%20II">Pentium II</a> and III's 2×16 kB L1 cache. The initial Athlon (Slot A, later called Athlon Classic) used 512 kB of level 2 cache separate from the CPU, on the processor cartridge board, running at 50% to 33% of core speed. This was done because the 250 nm manufacturing process was too large to allow for on-die cache while maintaining cost-effective die size. Later Athlon CPUs, afforded greater transistor budgets by smaller <a href="180%20nanometer">180 nm</a> and <a href="130%20nanometer">130 nm</a> process nodes, moved to on-die L2 cache at full CPU clock speed.

The AMD Athlon processor launched on June 23, 1999, with general availability by August '99. It launched at 500 MHz and was, on average, 10% faster than the Pentium III at the same clock for Business applications, and even faster (~20%) for gaming workloads.

The Athlon Classic is a cartridge-based processor, named <a href="Slot%20A">Slot A</a> and similar to Intel's cartridge <a href="Slot%201">Slot 1</a> used for Pentium II and Pentium III. It used the same, commonly available, physical 242 pin connector used by Intel Slot 1 processors but rotated by 180 degrees to connect the processor to the <a href="motherboard">motherboard</a>. The reversal served to make the slot keyed to prevent installation of the wrong CPU, as the Athlon and Intel processors used fundamentally different (and incompatible) signaling standards for their <a href="front-side%20bus">front-side bus</a>. The cartridge assembly allowed the use of higher speed cache memory modules than could be put on (or reasonably bundled with) motherboards at the time. Similar to the Pentium II and the Katmai-based Pentium III, the Athlon Classic contained 512 kB of L2 cache. This high-speed SRAM cache was run at a divisor of the processor clock and was accessed via its own 64-bit bus, known as a "<a href="back-side%20bus">back-side bus</a>" allowing the processor to both service system front side bus requests (the rest of the system) and cache accesses simultaneously versus the traditional approach of pushing "everything" through the <a href="front-side%20bus">front-side bus</a>.

One limitation (also afflicting the Intel Pentium III) is that <a href="Static%20Random%20Access%20Memory">SRAM</a> cache designs at the time were incapable of keeping up with the Athlon's clock scalability, due both to manufacturing limitations of the cache chips and the difficulty of routing electrical connections to the cache chips themselves. It became increasingly difficult to reliably run an external processor cache to match the processor speeds being released—and in fact it became impossible. Thus initially the <a href="Level%202%20cache">Level 2 cache</a> ran at half of the CPU clock speed up to 700 MHz (350 MHz cache). Faster Slot-A processors had to compromise further and run at 2/5 (up to 850 MHz, 340 MHz cache) or 1/3 (up to 1 GHz, 333 MHz cache). This later race to 1 GHz (1000 MHz) by AMD and Intel further exacerbated this bottleneck as ever higher speed processors demonstrated decreasing gains in overall performance—stagnant SRAM cache memory speeds choked further improvements in overall speed. This directly lead to the development of integrating L2 cache onto the processor itself and remove the dependence on external cache chips. AMD's integration of the cache onto the Athlon processor itself would later result in the <a href="Athlon%23Thunderbird%20.28T-Bird.29">Athlon Thunderbird</a>.

The Slot-A Athlons were the first multiplier-locked CPUs from AMD. This was partly done to hinder CPU remarking being done by questionable resellers around the globe. AMD's older CPUs could simply be set to run at whatever clock speed the user chose on the motherboard, making it trivial to relabel a CPU and sell it as a faster grade than it was originally intended. These relabeled CPUs were not always stable, being overclocked and not tested properly, and this was damaging to AMD's reputation. Although the Athlon was multiplier locked, crafty enthusiasts eventually discovered that a connector on the PCB of the cartridge could control the multiplier. Eventually a product called the "Goldfingers device" was created by inventors Ryan Petersen and Micheal Franz Schuete that could unlock the CPU, named after the gold connector pads on the processor board that it attached to.

In commercial terms, the Athlon "Classic" was an enormous success—not just because of its own merits, but also because Intel endured a series of major production, design, and quality control issues at this time. In particular, Intel's transition to the 180 nm production process, starting in late 1999 and running through to mid-2000, suffered delays. There was a shortage of Pentium III parts. In contrast, AMD enjoyed a remarkably smooth process transition and had ample supplies available, causing Athlon sales to become quite strong.

The Argon-based Athlon contained 22 million transistors and measured 184 mm. It was fabricated by AMD in a slightly modified version of their CS44E process, a 0.25 µm <a href="complementary%20metal%E2%80%93oxide%E2%80%93semiconductor">complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor</a> (CMOS) process with six levels of aluminium interconnect. "Pluto" and "Orion" Athlons were fabricated in a 0.18 µm process.


The second generation Athlon, the "Thunderbird", debuted on June 5, 2000. This version of the Athlon shipped in a more traditional <a href="Pin%20grid%20array">pin-grid array</a> (PGA) format that plugged into a socket ("<a href="Socket%20A">Socket A</a>") on the motherboard (it also shipped in the slot A package). It was sold at speeds ranging from 600 MHz to 1.4 GHz (Athlon Classics using the Slot A package could clock up to 1 GHz). The major difference, however, was cache design. Just as Intel had done when they replaced the old Katmai-based <a href="Pentium%20III">Pentium III</a> with the much faster Coppermine-based Pentium III, AMD replaced the 512 kB external reduced-speed cache of the Athlon Classic with 256 kB of on-chip, full-speed exclusive cache. As a general rule, more cache improves performance, but faster cache improves it further still.

AMD changed cache design significantly with the Thunderbird core. With the older Athlon CPUs, the CPU caching was of an inclusive design where data from the L1 is duplicated in the L2 cache. Thunderbird moved to an <a href="CPU%20cache%23Multi-level%20caches">exclusive design</a> where the L1 cache's contents are not duplicated in the L2. This increases total cache size of the processor and effectively makes caching behave as if there is a very large L1 cache with a slower region (the L2) and a very fast region (the L1). Because of Athlon's very large L1 cache and the exclusive design, which turns the L2 cache into basically a "<a href="CPU%20cache%23Victim%20cache">victim cache</a>", the need for high L2 performance and size was lessened. AMD kept the 64-bit L2 cache data bus from the older Athlons, as a result, and allowed it to have a relatively high latency. A simpler L2 cache reduced the possibility of the L2 cache causing clock scaling and yield issues. Still, instead of the <a href="CPU%20cache%23Associativity">2-way associative</a> scheme used in older Athlons, Thunderbird did move to a more efficient 16-way associative layout.

The Thunderbird was AMD's most successful product since the <a href="Am386">Am386DX-40</a> ten years earlier. Mainboard designs had improved considerably by this time, and the initial trickle of Athlon mainboard makers had swollen to include every major manufacturer. AMD's new <a href="Fab%20%28semiconductors%29">fab</a> in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> came online, allowing further production increases, and the process technology was improved by a switch to copper interconnects. In October 2000, the Athlon "C" was introduced, raising the mainboard <a href="front-side%20bus">front-side bus</a> speed from 100 MHz to 133 MHz (266 <a href="MT/s">MT/s</a>) and providing roughly 10% extra performance per clock over the "B" model Thunderbird.


AMD released the third-generation Athlon, code-named "<a href="Palomino%20%28disambiguation%29">Palomino</a>", on October 9, 2001 as the "Athlon XP". The "XP" suffix is interpreted to mean "extended performance" and also as an unofficial reference to Microsoft <a href="Windows%20XP">Windows XP</a>. The "Athlon XP" was marketed using a <a href="Performance%20Rating">PR</a> system, which compared its relative performance to an Athlon utilizing the earlier "Thunderbird" core. "Athlon XP" launched at speeds between 1.33 GHz (PR1500+) and 1.53 GHz (PR1800+), giving AMD the x86 performance lead with the 1800+ model. Less than a month later, it enhanced that lead with the release of the 1600 MHz 1900+, and subsequent 1.67 GHz Athlon XP 2000+ in January 2002.

Palomino was the first K7 core to include the full <a href="Streaming%20SIMD%20Extensions">SSE</a> instruction set from the Intel <a href="Pentium%20III">Pentium III</a>, as well as AMD's <a href="3DNow%21">3DNow! Professional</a>. It is roughly 10% faster than Thunderbird at the same clock speed, thanks in part to the new SIMD functionality and to several additional improvements. The core has enhancements to the K7's <a href="Translation%20lookaside%20buffer">TLB</a> architecture and added a hardware data <a href="Instruction%20prefetch">prefetch</a> mechanism to take better advantage of available memory bandwidth. Palomino was also the first socketed Athlon officially supporting dual processing, with chips certified for that purpose branded as the Athlon MP. According to articles posted on <a href="HardwareZone">HardwareZone</a>, it was possible to mod the Athlon XP to function as an MP by connecting some fuses on the <a href="OPGA">OPGA</a>, although results varied with the motherboard used.

Changes in core layout also resulted in Palomino being more frugal with its electrical demands, consuming approximately 20% less power than its predecessor, and thus reducing heat output comparatively as well. While the preceding Athlon "Thunderbird" was capable of clock speeds exceeding 1400 MHz, the power and thermal considerations required to reach those speeds would have made it increasingly impractical as a marketable product. Thus, Palomino's goals of lowered power consumption (and resultant heat produced) allowed AMD to increase performance within a reasonable power envelope. Palomino's design also allowed AMD to continue using the same 180 nm manufacturing process node and core voltages as Thunderbird.

Interestingly, the Palomino core actually debuted earlier in the mobile market—branded as Mobile Athlon 4 with the codename "Corvette". It distinctively used a <a href="Pin%20grid%20array">ceramic</a> <a href="interposer">interposer</a> much like the Thunderbird instead of the <a href="organic%20pin%20grid%20array">organic pin grid array</a> package used on all later Palomino processors.


The fourth-generation Athlon "Thoroughbred" was released on June 10, 2002 at 1.8 GHz (Athlon XP <a href="Performance%20Rating">PR</a>2200+). The "Thoroughbred" core marked AMD's first production 130 nm silicon, resulting in a significant reduction in die size compared to its 180 nm predecessor.

There came to be two <a href="Stepping%20level">steppings</a> (revisions) of this core commonly referred to as Tbred-A (<a href="cpuid">cpuid</a>:6 8 0) and Tbred-B (<a href="cpuid">cpuid</a>:6 8 1). The initial version (later known as A) was simply a direct <a href="die%20shrink">die shrink</a> of the Palomino, and demonstrated that AMD had successfully transitioned to a 130 nm process. While successful in reducing the production cost per processor, the unmodified Palomino design did not demonstrate the expected reduction in heat and clock scalability usually seen when a design is shrunk to a smaller process. As a result, AMD was not able to increase Thoroughbred-A clock speeds much above those of the Palomino it was to replace. Tbred-A was only sold in versions from 1333 MHz to 1800 MHz, and was only able to displace the more production-costly Palomino from AMD's lineup.

AMD thus reworked the Thoroughbred's design to better match the process node on which it was produced, in turn creating the Thoroughbred-B. A significant aspect of this redesign was the addition of another ninth "metal layer" to the already quite complex eight-layered Thoroughbred-A. For comparison, the competing Pentium 4 Northwood only utilized six, and its successor Prescott seven layers. While the addition of more layers itself does not improve performance, it gives more flexibility for chip designers routing electrical pathways within a chip, and importantly for the Thoroughbred core, more flexibility in working around electrical bottlenecks that prevented the processor from attaining higher clock speeds. The Tbred-B offered a startling improvement in headroom over the Tbred-A, which made it very popular for <a href="overclocking">overclocking</a>. The Tbred-A often struggled to reach clock speeds above 1.9 GHz, while the Tbred-B often could easily reach 2.3 GHz and above.

The Thoroughbred line received an increased front side bus clock during its lifetime, from 133 MHz (266 MT/s) to 166 MHz (333 MT/s) improving the processor's ability to access memory and I/O efficiency, and resulted in improved per-clock performance. AMD shifted their PR rating scheme accordingly, making lower clock speeds equate to higher PR ratings.

The Thoroughbred-B was the "direct" basis for its successor—the Tbred-B with an "additional" 256 kB of L2 cache (for 512 kB total) became the Barton core.


Fifth-generation Athlon "Barton"-core processors released in early 2003 with <a href="Performance%20Rating">PR</a> of 2500+, 2600+, 2800+, 3000+, and 3200+. While not operating at higher clock rates than "Thoroughbred"-core processors, they were marked with higher PR by featuring an increased 512 kB L2 cache; later models additionally supported an increased 200 MHz (400 MT/s) front side bus. The "Thorton" core was a later variant of the "Barton" with half of the L2 cache disabled, and thus was functionally identical to the "Thoroughbred-B" core. The name "Thorton" is a <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of "Thoroughbred" and "Barton".

By the time of Barton's release, the "Northwood"-based <a href="Pentium%204">Pentium 4</a> had become more than competitive with AMD's processors. Unfortunately for AMD, a simple increase in size of the L2 cache to 512 kB did not have nearly the same impact as it did for Intel's Pentium 4 line, as the Athlon architecture was not nearly as cache-constrained as the Pentium 4. The Athlon's exclusive-cache architecture and shorter pipeline made it less sensitive to L2 cache size, and the Barton only saw an increase of several percent gained in per-clock performance over the Thoroughbred-B it was derived from. While the increased performance was welcome, it was not sufficient to overtake the Pentium 4 line in overall performance. The PR also became somewhat inaccurate because some Barton models with lower clock rates were being given higher PR than higher-clocked Thoroughbred processors. Instances where a computational task did not benefit more from the additional cache to make up for the loss in raw clock speed created situations where a lower rated (but faster clocked) Thoroughbred would outperform a higher-rated (but lower clocked) Barton.

The Barton was also used to officially introduce a higher 400 MT/s bus clock for the Socket A platform, which was used to gain some Barton models more efficiency (and increased PR). However, it was clear by this time that Intel's quad-pumped bus was scaling well above AMD's double-pumped EV6 bus. The 800 MT/s bus used by many later Pentium 4 processors was well out of the Athlon XP's reach. In order to reach the same bandwidth levels, the Athlon XP's bus would have to be clocked at levels simply unreachable.

By this point, the four-year-old Athlon EV6 bus architecture had scaled to its limit. To maintain or exceed the performance of Intel's newer processors would require a significant redesign. The K7 derived Athlons were replaced in March 2003 by the <a href="AMD%20K8">Athlon 64</a> family, which featured an <a href="Memory%20controller">on-chip memory controller</a> and a completely new <a href="HyperTransport">HyperTransport</a> bus to replace EV6.

"Thorton (130 nm)"

A Mobile Athlon XPs ("Athlon XP-M") using a given core is physically identical to the equivalent desktop Athlon XPs counterpart, only differing by the configuration used to achieve a given performance level. Processors are usually binned and selected to become a mobile processor by their ability run a given processor speed while supplied with a lower (than desktop) voltage. This results in lower power consumption, longer battery life, and reduced heat over using a normal desktop part. Additionally Mobile XPs feature not being <a href="CPU%20multiplier">multiplier</a>-locked and generally higher-rated maximum operating temperatures, requirements intended for better operation within the tight thermal constraints within a notebook PC—but also making them attractive for <a href="overclocking">overclocking</a>.

The Athlon XP-M replaced the older Mobile Athlon 4 based on the "Palomino" core, with the Athlon XP-M using the newer "Thoroughbred" and "Barton" cores. The Athlon XP-M was also offered in a compact microPGA <a href="socket%20563">socket 563</a> version for space constrained applications as an alternative to the larger Socket A.

Like their mobile <a href="AMD%20K6-III">K6-2+/III+</a> predecessors, the CPUs were capable of dynamic clock adjustment for power optimization, and also was the reason for the unlocked multiplier. When the system is <a href="idle">idle</a>, the CPU clocks itself down via lower bus multiplier and selects a lower voltage. When a program demands more computational resources, the CPU quickly (there is some latency) returns to an intermediate or maximum speed with appropriate voltage to meet the demand. This technology was marketed as "<a href="PowerNow%21">PowerNow!</a>" and was similar to Intel's <a href="SpeedStep">SpeedStep</a> power saving technique. The feature was controlled by the CPU, motherboard <a href="BIOS">BIOS</a>, and <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>. AMD later renamed the technology to <a href="Cool%27n%27Quiet">Cool'n'Quiet</a> on their K8-based CPUs (<a href="Athlon%2064">Athlon 64</a>, etc.), and introduced it for use on desktop PCs as well.

Athlon XP-Ms were popular with desktop <a href="overclocking">overclockers</a>, as well as <a href="underclocking">underclockers</a>. The lower voltage requirement and higher heat rating selected CPUs that were essentially "<a href="Cherry%20picking%20%28fallacy%29">cherry picked</a>" from the manufacturing line. Being some of the best cores "off the line", these CPUs typically overclocked more reliably than their desktop-headed counterparts. Also, the fact that they were not locked to a single multiplier was a significant simplification in the overclocking process. Some "Barton" core Athlon XP-Ms have been successfully overclocked as high as 3.1 GHz.

The chips were also liked for their <a href="undervolting">undervolting</a> ability. Undervolting is a process of determining the lowest voltage at which a CPU can remain stable at a given clock speed. As Athlon XP-M CPUs were already rated running lower voltages than their desktop siblings, it was a better starting point for lowering voltage even further. A popular application was use in <a href="home%20theater%20PC">home theater PC</a> systems due to high performance and low heat output resultant from low Vcore settings.

Besides not being multiplier locked, XP-Ms curiously were not disabled from <a href="Symmetric%20multiprocessing">multi processor</a> operation. Thus they could be used in place of the more expensive Athlon MP in dual socket A motherboards. Since those boards generally lacked multiplier and voltage adjustment, and normally only supported 133 MHz FSB, adjustments would still be needed for full speed operation. One method of modification known as wire-modding involves connecting the appropriate CPU pins on the CPU socket with small lengths of wire to select the appropriate multiplier. A typical overclock of a mobile 2500+ CPU to 2.26 GHz with 17x multiplier would result in being faster than highest official 2800+ MP CPU running at 2.13 GHz.

Amu Darya

The Amu Darya, also called the Amu or Amo River, and historically known by its <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> name , is a major river in <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>. It is formed by the junction of the <a href="Vakhsh%20River">Vakhsh</a> and <a href="Panj%20River">Panj</a> rivers, in the <a href="Tigrovaya%20Balka%20Nature%20Reserve">Tigrovaya Balka Nature Reserve</a> on the border between <a href="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a> and <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, and flows from there north-westwards into the <a href="South%20Aral%20Sea">southern remnants</a> of the <a href="Aral%20Sea">Aral Sea</a>. In ancient times, the river was regarded as the boundary between <a href="Greater%20Iran">Greater Iran</a> and <a href="Turan">Turan</a>.

The Amu Darya (, ""; /; //; , "Amudaryo"; , "; , "Ôxos", اوكسوس"), also called the Amu River, is a major river in <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>.

In <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a>, the river was known as the "Ōxus" in <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> and <a href="wikt%3A%E1%BD%AE%CE%BE%CE%BF%CF%82">Ὦξος</a> "Ôxos" in <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>—a clear derivative of <a href="Vakhsh%20River">Vakhsh</a>, the name of the largest tributary of the river. In Vedic <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, the river is also referred to as Vakṣu (वक्षु). The <a href="Avestan">Avestan</a> texts too refer to the River as Yakhsha/Vakhsha (and Yakhsha Arta ("upper Yakhsha") referring to the <a href="Jaxartes">Jaxartes</a>/<a href="Syr%20Darya">Syr Darya</a> twin river to Amu Darya).

In <a href="Middle%20Persian">Middle Persian</a> sources of the <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanid period</a> the river is known as "Wehrōd" (lit. "good river").

The name "Amu" is said to have come from the medieval city of "Āmul", (later, Chahar Joy/Charjunow, and now known as <a href="T%C3%BCrkmenabat">Türkmenabat</a>), in modern <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, with "Darya" being the Persian word for "river".

Medieval <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> and <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> sources call the river "Jayhoun" (جيحون "Jayḥūn"; also "Jaihun", "Jayhoon", or "Dzhaykhun") which is derived from "<a href="Gihon">Gihon</a>", the biblical name for one of the four rivers of the <a href="Garden%20of%20Eden">Garden of Eden</a>.

Western travelers in the 19th century mention that one of the names by which the river was known in Afghanistan was Gozan, and that this name was used by Greek, Mongol, Chinese, Persian, Jewish, and Afghan historians. However, this name is no longer used.

The river's total length is and its drainage basin totals in area, providing a mean discharge of around of water per year. The river is navigable for over . All of the water comes from the high mountains in the south where annual <a href="precipitation">precipitation</a> can be over . Even before large-scale irrigation began, high summer evaporation meant that not all of this discharge reached the <a href="Aral%20Sea">Aral Sea</a> – though there is some evidence the large Pamir <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s provided enough melt water for the Aral to overflow during the 13th and 14th centuries.

Since the end of the 19th century there have been four different claimants as the true source of the Oxus:

A glacier turns into the <a href="Wakhan%20River">Wakhan River</a> and joins the Pamir River about downstream.
Bill Colegrave's expedition to Wakhan in 2007 found that both claimants 2 and 3 had the same source, the Chelab stream, which bifurcates on the watershed of the Little Pamir, half flowing into Lake Chamaktin and half into the parent stream of the Little Pamir/Sarhad River. Therefore, the Chelab stream may be properly considered the true source or parent stream of the Oxus.
The Panj River forms the border of <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>. It flows west to <a href="Ishkashim%2C%20Afghanistan">Ishkashim</a> where it turns north and then north-west through the <a href="Pamirs">Pamirs</a> passing the <a href="Tajikistan%E2%80%93Afghanistan%20bridge%20at%20Panji%20Poyon">Tajikistan–Afghanistan Friendship Bridge</a>. It subsequently forms the border of Afghanistan and Uzbekistan for about , passing <a href="Termez">Termez</a> and the <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93Uzbekistan%20Friendship%20Bridge">Afghanistan–Uzbekistan Friendship Bridge</a>. It delineates the border of Afghanistan and Turkmenistan for another before it flows into Turkmenistan at <a href="Atamurat">Atamurat</a>. As the "Amudarya", it flows across Turkmenistan south to north, passing <a href="T%C3%BCrkmenabat">Türkmenabat</a>, and forms the border of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan from <a href="Halkabat">Halkabat</a>. It is then split by the <a href="Tuyamuyun%20Hydro%20Complex">Tuyamuyun Hydro Complex</a> into many waterways that used to form the <a href="river%20delta">river delta</a> joining the Aral Sea, passing <a href="Urgench">Urgench</a>, <a href="Da%C5%9Foguz">Daşoguz</a>, and other cities, but it does not reach what is left of the sea any more and is lost in the desert.

Use of water from the Amu Darya for <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a> has been a major contributing factor to the shrinking of the Aral Sea since the late 1950s.

Historical records state that in different periods, the river flowed into the <a href="Aral%20Sea">Aral Sea</a> (from the south), into the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> (from the east), or both, similar to the <a href="Syr%20Darya">Syr Darya</a> (Jaxartes, in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>).

The of the Amu Darya <a href="drainage%20basin">drainage basin</a> include most of Tajikistan, the southwest corner of <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a>, the northeast corner of Afghanistan, a narrow portion of eastern Turkmenistan and the western half of Uzbekistan. Part of the Amu Darya basin <a href="drainage%20divide">divide</a> in Tajikistan forms that country's border with China (in the east) and Pakistan (to the south). About 61% of the drainage lies within Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, while 39% is in Afghanistan.

The abundant water flowing in the Amu Darya comes almost entirely from <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s in the <a href="Pamir%20Mountains">Pamir Mountains</a> and <a href="Tian%20Shan">Tian Shan</a>,
which, standing above the surrounding arid plain, collect atmospheric moisture which otherwise would probably escape somewhere else. Without its mountain water sources, the Amu Darya would not contain any water—would not exist—because it rarely rains in the lowlands through which most of the river flows. Of the total drainage area only about actively contribute water to the river.
This is because many of the river's major tributaries (especially the <a href="Zeravshan%20River">Zeravshan River</a>) have been diverted, and much of the river's drainage is arid. Throughout most of the steppe, the annual rainfall is about .

The ancient Greeks called the Amu Darya the "Oxus". In ancient times, the river was regarded as the boundary between <a href="Greater%20Iran">Greater Iran</a> and <a href="Turan">Tūrān</a>. The river's drainage lies in the area between the former empires of <a href="Genghis%20Khan">Genghis Khan</a> and <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, although they occurred at very different times. When the Mongols came to the area, they used the water of the Amu Darya to flood <a href="Konye-Urgench">Konye-Urgench</a>. One southern route of the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> ran along part of the Amu Darya northwestward from <a href="Termez">Termez</a> before going westwards to the <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a>.

It is believed that the Amu Darya's course across the Kara-Kum Desert has gone through several major shifts in the past few thousand years. Much of the time – most recently from the 13th century to the late 16th century – the Amu Darya emptied into both the Aral and the Caspian Seas, reaching the latter via a large <a href="distributary">distributary</a> called the <a href="Uzboy%20River">Uzboy River</a>. The Uzboy splits off from the main channel just south of the Amudarya Delta. Sometimes the flow through the two branches was more or less equal, but often most of the Amu Darya's flow split to the west and flowed into the Caspian.

People began to settle along the lower Amu Darya and the Uzboy in the 5th century, establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands, towns, and cities. In about 985 AD the massive Gurganj Dam at the bifurcation of the forks started to divert water to the Aral. <a href="Genghis%20Khan">Genghis Khan</a>'s troops destroyed the dam in 1221, and the Amu Darya shifted to distributing its flow more or less equally between the main stem and the Uzboy. But in the 18th century, the river again turned north, flowing into the Aral Sea, a path it has taken since. Less and less water flowed down the Uzboy. When Russian explorer, Bekovich—Cherkasski suveyed the region in 1720, Amu Darya did not flow into the Caspian Sea anymore.

The first Englishman to reach the Oxus, <a href="William%20Moorcroft%20%28explorer%29">William Moorcroft</a> visited about 1824. Another to reach the region in the <a href="Great%20Game">Great Game</a> period, a naval officer called <a href="John%20Wood%20%28explorer%29">John Wood</a>, came with an expedition to find the source of the river in 1839. He found modern-day Lake Zorkul, called it Lake Victoria, and proclaimed he had found the source. Then, the French explorer and geographer <a href="Thibaut%20Vin%C3%A9">Thibaut Viné</a> collected a lot of information about this area during five expeditions between 1856 and 1862.

The question of finding a route between the Oxus valley and India has been of concern historically. A direct route crosses extremely high mountain passes in the <a href="Hindu%20Kush">Hindu Kush</a> and isolated areas like <a href="Kafiristan">Kafiristan</a>. Some in Britain feared that the Empire of Russia, which at the time wielded great influence over the Oxus area, would overcome these obstacles and find a suitable route through which to invade <a href="British%20India">British India</a> – but this never came to pass. The area was taken over by Russia during the <a href="Russian%20conquest%20of%20Turkestan">Russian conquest of Turkestan</a>.

The <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> became the ruling power in the early 1920s and expelled <a href="Mohammed%20Alim%20Khan">Mohammed Alim Khan</a>. It later put down the <a href="Basmachi%20movement">Basmachi movement</a> and killed <a href="Ibrahim%20Bek">Ibrahim Bek</a>. A large refugee population of Central Asians, including Turkmen, Tajiks and Uzbeks, fled to northern Afghanistan. In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviets started using the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya to irrigate extensive <a href="cotton">cotton</a> fields in the Central Asian plain. Before this time, water from the rivers was already being used for agriculture, but not on this massive scale. The <a href="Qaraqum%20Canal">Qaraqum Canal</a>, Karshi Canal, and Bukhara Canal were among the larger of the irrigation diversions built. However, the <a href="Main%20Turkmen%20Canal">Main Turkmen Canal</a>, which would have diverted water along the dry Uzboy River bed into central Turkmenistan, was never built. The 1970s, in the course of the <a href="Soviet%20war%20in%20Afghanistan">Soviet war in Afghanistan</a>, Soviet forces used the valley to invade Afghanistan through <a href="Termez">Termez</a>. The Soviet Union fell in the 1990s and Central Asia split up into the many smaller countries that lie within or partially within the Amu Darya basin. 

During the Soviet era a resource-sharing system was instated in which <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a> and <a href="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a> shared water originating from the Amu Darya and <a href="Syr%20Darya">Syr Darya</a> rivers with <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, and <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a> in summer. In return, <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a> and <a href="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a> received Kazakh, Turkmen, and Uzbek coal, gas, and electricity in winter. After the fall of the Soviet Union this system disintegrated and the Central Asian nations have failed to reinstate it. Inadequate infrastructure, poor water-management, and outdated irrigation methods all exacerbate the issue.

The Amu-Darya's delta was suggested as a potential site. A feasibility study was initiated to investigate if the area is suitable and if such an initiative would receive support from relevant decision makers. A viable tiger population of about 100 animals would require at least of large tracts of contiguous habitat with rich prey populations. Such habitat is not available at this stage and cannot be provided in the short term. The proposed region is therefore unsuitable for the reintroduction, at least at this stage.

The Oxus river, and Arnold's poem, fire the imaginations of the children who adventure with ponies over the moors of the West Country in the 1930s children's book "<a href="The%20Far-Distant%20Oxus">The Far-Distant Oxus</a>". There were two sequels, "Escape to Persia" and "Oxus in Summer".

<a href="Robert%20Byron">Robert Byron</a>'s 1937 travelogue, "<a href="The%20Road%20to%20Oxiana">The Road to Oxiana</a>", describes its author's journey from the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> through <a href="Persia">Persia</a> to <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, with the Oxus as his stated goal.

<a href="George%20MacDonald%20Fraser">George MacDonald Fraser</a>'s "<a href="Flashman%20at%20the%20Charge">Flashman at the Charge</a>", (1973), places Flashman on the Amu Darya and the Arral Sea during the (fictitious) Russian advance on India during <a href="The%20Great%20Game">The Great Game</a> period.

The Islamic conquest of Afghanistan (642–870) began in the middle of the 7th century after the <a href="Islamic%20conquest%20of%20Persia">Islamic conquest of Persia</a> was completed, when <a href="Arab%20people">Arab</a> <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s defeated the <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanid Empire</a> at the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Walaja">Walaja</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20al-Q%C4%81disiyyah">al-Qādisiyyah</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Nihaw%C4%81nd">Nahavand</a>. The Muslim Arabs then began to move towards the lands east of <a href="Persia">Persia</a> and in 652 captured the city, <a href="Herat">Herat</a>, and established an Arab governor. By 661, the Caliphate was forced to put down a rebellion in Herat and in 702 Yazidb. al-Muhallab drove out Arab rebels again.

By 667, the <a href="Afghan%20%28name%29">Afghan</a> area was under invasion by the Arabs but in 683 <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a> and other parts of Afghanistan fought with resistance and completely routed the invading army which was led by the Governor of Seistan. The near-complete conversion of <a href="Afghans">Afghans</a> to <a href="Islam">Islam</a> was during the period of the <a href="Ghaznavids">Ghaznavids</a> in the 10th century with <a href="Kafiristan">Kafiristan</a> holding out until <a href="Emir">Emir</a> <a href="Abdur%20Rahman%20Khan">Abdur Rahman Khan</a> conquered and forcibly converted them in the 1890s. Ethnic Arabs who have settled in Afghanistan, came to form the first community of <a href="Afghan%20Arabs">Afghan Arabs</a>.

The invasion of Persia was completed five years after the death of the <a href="Islamic%20prophet">Islamic prophet</a> <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, and all of the Persian territories came under Arab control, though pockets of tribal resistance continued for centuries in the <a href="Afghan%20%28name%29">Afghan</a> territories. During the 7th century, <a href="Umayyad">Arab armies</a> made their way into the region of Afghanistan from <a href="Greater%20Khorasan">Khorasan</a> with the new religion of <a href="Islam">Islam</a>.

The area had been under the rule of the <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> and then <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> dynasty called the <a href="Kabul%20Shahi">Kabul Shahi</a>s since the 5th century. Muslims missionaries converted many people to Islam; however, the entire population did not convert, with repetitive revolts from the mountain tribes in the Afghan area taking place. The <a href="Hindu%20Shahi">Hindu Shahi</a> were defeated in the early part of the 10th century by <a href="Mahmud%20of%20Ghazna">Mahmud of Ghazna</a>, who ruled between 998 and 1030. He also expelled the Hindu Shahi from <a href="Gandhara">Gandhara</a>.

In 870, <a href="Ya%27qub%20bin%20Laith%20as-Saffar">Ya'qub bin Laith as-Saffar</a>, a local ruler from the <a href="Saffarid">Saffarid</a> dynasty of <a href="Zaranj">Zaranj</a>, <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, conquered most of present-day Afghanistan in the name of Islam. In many cases, the people he conquered had rebelled against their Islamic overlords and reverted to prior forms of worship.

From the 8th century to the 9th century, many inhabitants of what is present-day <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> were converted to <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni Islam</a>. It is surmised from the writings of <a href="Al%20Biruni">Al Biruni</a> that some <a href="Pashtuns">Pashtuns</a> living in <a href="Pakhtunkhwa">Pakhtunkhwa</a> (present-day western Pakistan) had not been completely converted. Al Biruni, writing in Tarikh al Hind, also alludes to the Pashtun tribes of Pakhtunkhwa as Hindus.

Various historical sources such as Martin Ewans, E.J. Brill and Farishta have recorded the introduction of Islam to Kabul and other parts of Afghanistan to the invasions of <a href="Mahmud%20of%20Ghazna">Mahmud of Ghazna</a>

<a href="Muhammad%20al-Idrisi">Al-Idirisi</a> (1100-1165/1166) testifies that until as late as the 12th century, a contract of investiture for every Hindu Shahi king was performed at Kabul and that here he was obliged to agree to certain ancient conditions which completed the contract.

During the end of the 9th century, the <a href="Samanid%20Dynasty">Samanids</a> extended its rule from <a href="Bukhara">Bukhara</a> to as far south as the <a href="Indus%20River">Indus River</a> and west into parts of Persia. Although Arab Muslim intellectual life was still centered in <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, <a href="Sunni%20Islam">Sunni Islam</a>, predominated in the Samanid areas at this time. This period of time was considered an era of great cultural, intellectual, and artistic flourishing under the patronage of the <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> Samanids. By the mid-10th century, the Samanid Dynasty had crumbled in the face of attacks from <a href="Turkish%20people">Turkish</a> tribes to the north and from the <a href="Ghaznavids">Ghaznavids</a>, a rising <a href="Turkic%20peoples">Turkic</a> dynasty in Afghanistan.

The region was ruled by <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> and <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> dynasty called the <a href="Kabul%20Shahi">Kabul Shahi</a>s since the 5th century. Mountain tribe revolts hindered the process of converting the tribes. In 870, <a href="Ya%27qub-i%20Laith%20Saffari">Ya'qub-i Laith Saffari</a>, a local <a href="Tajik%20people">Persian</a> ruler from the <a href="Saffarids">Saffarid dynasty</a> of <a href="Zaranj">Zaranj</a>, <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, conquered most of the cities of present-day Afghanistan in the name of Islam.

Durrani Empire

The Durrani Empire (), also called the Afghan Empire, was founded and built by <a href="Ahmad%20Shah%20Durrani">Ahmad Shah Durrani</a> with its capitals at <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a>, <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, and <a href="Peshawar">Peshawar</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. At its maximum extent, the empire covered the nearly-entire modern states of <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, as well as some parts of northeastern <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, eastern <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, northwestern <a href="India">India</a> including the <a href="Kashmir%20Valley">Kashmir</a> region. It is recognized as one of the most powerful Muslim empires.

After the death of <a href="Nader%20Shah">Nader Shah</a> in 1747, the region of Kandahar was claimed by Ahmad Shah Durrani. From there he began conquering <a href="Ghazni">Ghazni</a> followed by <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a>. In 1749 the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal</a> ruler had ceded sovereignty over what is now Pakistan and northwestern Punjab to the Afghans. Ahmad Shah then set out westward to take possession of <a href="Herat">Herat</a>, which was ruled by <a href="Shahrokh%20Shah">Shahrokh Shah</a>. He next sent an army to subdue the areas north of the <a href="Hindu%20Kush">Hindu Kush</a> and in short order all the different tribes began joining his cause. Ahmad Shah and his forces invaded India four times, taking control of the Kashmir and the <a href="Punjab">Punjab region</a>. Early in 1757, he sacked <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a>, but permitted the Mughal dynasty to remain in nominal control as long as the ruler acknowledged Ahmad Shah's suzerainty over the Punjab, Sindh, and Kashmir. Durrani's forces instigated the <a href="Va%E1%B8%8D%E1%B8%8D%C4%81%20Ghall%C5%ABgh%C4%81r%C4%81">Vaḍḍā Ghallūghārā</a> when they killed thousands of Sikhs in the <a href="Punjab">Punjab</a>.

After the death of Ahmad Shah in about 1772, his son <a href="Timur%20Shah%20Durrani">Timur Shah</a> became the next ruler of the <a href="Durrani%20dynasty">Durrani dynasty</a> who decided to make <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a> the new <a href="capital%20%28political%29">capital</a> of the empire, and used Peshawar as the winter capital. The Durrani Empire is considered the foundation of the modern <a href="Nation%20state">state</a> of Afghanistan, and <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. with Ahmad Shah Durrani being credited as "<a href="Father%20of%20the%20Nation">Father of the Nation</a>".

In 1709 <a href="Mir%20Wais%20Hotak">Mir Wais Hotak</a>, chief of the <a href="Ghilji">Ghilji</a> tribe of <a href="Kandahar%20Province">Kandahar Province</a>, gained independence from the <a href="Safavid%20dynasty">Safavid</a> Persians. From 1722 to 1725, his son <a href="Mahmud%20Hotak">Mahmud Hotak</a> briefly ruled large parts of <a href="Iran">Iran</a> and declared himself as "Shah of Persia". However, the <a href="Hotak%20dynasty">Hotak dynasty</a> came to a complete end in 1738 after being toppled and banished by the <a href="Afsharid%20dynasty">Afsharids</a> who were led by <a href="Nader%20Shah%20Afshar">Nader Shah Afshar</a> of <a href="Persia">Persia</a>.

The year 1747 marks the definitive appearance of an Afghan political entity independent of both the Persian and <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal</a> empires. In October 1747 a <a href="loya%20jirga">loya jirga</a> (grand council) concluded near the city of Kandahar with <a href="Ahmad%20Shah%20Durrani">Ahmad Shah Durrani</a> being selected as the new leader of the Afghans, thus the Durrani dynasty was founded. Despite being younger than the other contenders, Ahmad Shah had several overriding factors in his favor. He belonged to a respectable family of political background, especially since his father served as <a href="list%20of%20governors%20of%20Herat">Governor of Herat</a> who died in a battle defending the Afghans.

One of Ahmad Shah's first military action was the capture <a href="Ghazni">Ghazni</a> from the Ghiljis, and then wresting Kabul from the local ruler. In 1749, the Mughal ruler was induced to cede <a href="Sindh%20Province">Sindh</a>, the <a href="Punjab">Punjab region</a> and the important trans <a href="Indus%20River">Indus River</a> to Ahmad Shah in order to save his capital from Afghan attack. Having thus gained substantial territories to the east without a fight, Ahmad Shah turned westward to take possession of <a href="Herat%20Province">Herat</a>, which was ruled by Nader Shah Afshar's grandson, <a href="Shahrukh%20Afshar">Shahrukh Afshar</a>. Ahmad Shah next sent an army to subdue the areas north of the <a href="Hindu%20Kush">Hindu Kush</a> mountains. In short order, the powerful army brought under its control the <a href="Tajik%20people">Tajik</a>, <a href="Hazara%20people">Hazara</a>, <a href="Uzbeks">Uzbek</a>, <a href="Turkmen%20people">Turkmen</a>, and other tribes of northern Afghanistan. Ahmad Shah invaded the remnants of the Mughal Empire a third time, and then a fourth, consolidating control over the Kashmir and Punjab regions, with <a href="Lahore">Lahore</a> being governed by Afghans. He sacked Delhi in 1757 but permitted the Mughal dynasty to remain in nominal control of the city as long as the ruler acknowledged Ahmad Shah's suzerainty over Punjab, Sindh, and Kashmir. Leaving his second son <a href="Timur%20Shah%20Durrani">Timur Shah</a> to safeguard his interests, Ahmad Shah left India to return to Afghanistan.

Alarmed by the expansion of China's <a href="Qing%20Dynasty">Qing Dynasty</a> up to the eastern border of Kazakhstan, Ahmad Shah attempted to rally neighboring Muslim khanates and the Kazakhs to unite and attack China, ostensibly to liberate its western Muslim subjects. Ahmad Shah halted trade with Qing China and dispatched troops to <a href="Kokand">Kokand</a>. However, with his campaigns in India exhausting the state treasury, and with his troops stretched thin throughout Central Asia, Ahmad Shah lacked sufficient resources to do anything except to send envoys to <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a> for unsuccessful talks.

The Mughal power in northern India had been declining since the reign of <a href="Aurangzeb">Aurangzeb</a>, who died in 1707; In 1751-52, "Ahamdiya" treaty was signed between the <a href="Maratha%20Empire">Marathas</a> and <a href="Mughals">Mughals</a>, when <a href="Balaji%20Bajirao">Balaji Bajirao</a> was the <a href="Peshwa">Peshwa</a>. Through this treaty, the Marathas controlled virtually the whole of India from their capital at <a href="Pune">Pune</a> and the Mughal rule was restricted only to Delhi (the Mughals remained the nominal heads of Delhi). Marathas were now straining to expand their area of control towards the Northwest of India. Ahmad Shah sacked the Mughal capital and withdrew with the booty he coveted. To counter the Afghans, Peshwa Balaji Bajirao sent <a href="Raghunathrao">Raghunathrao</a>. He defeated the Rohillas and Afghan garrisons in Punjab and succeeded in ousting Timur Shah and his court from India and brought Lahore, Multan, Kashmir and other subahs on the Indian side of Attock under Maratha rule. Thus, upon his return to Kandahar in 1757, Ahmad was forced to return to India and face the formidable attacks of the Maratha Confederacy.

Ahmad Shah declared a <a href="jihad">jihad</a> (or <a href="Islam">Islam</a>ic holy war) against the <a href="Maratha%20Empire">Marathas</a>, and warriors from various Afghan tribes joined his army, including the <a href="Baloch%20people">Baloch people</a> under the command of <a href="Khan%20of%20Kalat">Khan of Kalat</a> Mir <a href="Nasir%20I%20of%20Kalat">Nasir I of Kalat</a>. Early skirmishes were followed by victory for the Afghans against the smaller Maratha garrisons in Northwest India and by 1759 Ahmad Shah and his army had reached Lahore and were poised to confront the Marathas. By 1760, the Maratha groups had coalesced into a big enough army under the command of Sadashivrao Bhau. Once again, <a href="Panipat">Panipat</a> was the scene of a confrontation between two warring contenders for control of northern India. The Third Battle of Panipat (14 January 1761), fought between largely Muslim and largely Hindu armies was waged along a twelve-kilometer front. Despite decisively defeating the Marathas, what might have been Ahmad Shah's peaceful control of his domains was disrupted by many challenges. As far as losses are concerned, Afghans too suffered heavily in the Third Battle of Panipat. This weakened his grasp over Punjab which fell to the rising <a href="Sikh">Sikh</a> <a href="misls">misls</a>. There were rebellions in the north in the region of <a href="Bukhara">Bukhara</a>.

The victory at Panipat was the high point of Ahmad Shah's—and Afghan—power. However, even prior to his death, the empire began to unravel. In 1762, Ahmad Shah crossed the passes from Afghanistan for the sixth time to subdue the <a href="Sikh%20Empire">Sikhs</a>. From this time and on, the domination and control of the Empire began to loosen. He assaulted Lahore and, after taking their holy city of <a href="Amritsar">Amritsar</a>, massacred thousands of <a href="Sikh">Sikh</a> inhabitants, destroying their revered <a href="Harmandir%20Sahib">Golden Temple</a>. Within two years, the Sikhs rebelled again and rebuilt their holy city of Amritsar. Ahmad Shah tried several more times to subjugate the Sikhs permanently, but failed. Ahmad Shah also faced other rebellions in the north, and eventually he and the Uzbek Emir of <a href="Emirate%20of%20Bukhara">Bukhara</a> agreed that the Amu Darya would mark the division of their lands. A decade after the <a href="third%20Battle%20of%20Panipat">third Battle of Panipat</a>, <a href="Marathas">Marathas</a> under the leadership of <a href="Mahadji%20Scindia">Mahadji Scindia</a> entered and recaptured <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a> in 1771, cutting off <a href="Rohillas">Rohillas</a> from the <a href="Durranis">Durranis</a> forever. Ahmad Shah retired to his home in the mountains east of Kandahar, where he died on April 14, 1773. He had succeeded to a remarkable degree in balancing tribal alliances and hostilities, and in directing tribal energies away from rebellion. He earned recognition as Ahmad Shah Baba, or "Father" of Afghanistan.

<a href="Ahmed%20Shah%20Abdali">Ahmad Shah</a>'s successors governed so ineptly during a period of profound unrest that within fifty years of his death, the Durrani empire "per se" was at an end, and Afghanistan was embroiled in civil war. Much of the territory conquered by Ahmad Shah fell to others in this half century. By 1818, the <a href="Sadozai%20%28Pastun%20tribe%29">Sadozai</a> rulers who succeeded Ahmad Shah controlled little more than Kabul and the surrounding territory within a 160-kilometer radius. They not only lost the outlying territories but also alienated other tribes and lineages among the Durrani Pashtuns.

Ahmad Shah was succeeded by his son, Timur Shah, who had been deputed to administer his father's conquests in Northern India, but had been driven out by the Marathas. Upon Ahmad Shah's death, the Durrani chieftains only reluctantly accepted Timur's accession. Most of his reign was spent fighting a civil war and resisting rebellion; Timur was even forced to move his capital from Kandahar to Kabul due to the insurgency. Timur Shah proved an ineffectual ruler, during whose reign the Durrani empire began to crumble. He is notable for having had 24 sons, several of whom became rulers of the Durrani territories. Timur died in 1793 and was then succeeded by his fifth son Zaman Shah

After the death of Timur Shah, three of his sons, the governors of Kandahar, Herat and Kabul, contended for the succession. <a href="Zaman%20Shah">Zaman Shah</a>, governor of Kabul, held the field by virtue of being in control of the capital, and became shah at the age of twenty-three. Many of his half-brothers were imprisoned on their arrival in the capital for the purpose, ironically, of electing a new shah. The quarrels among Timur's descendants that through Afghanistan into turmoil also provided the pretext for the interventions of outside forces.

The efforts of the Sadozai heirs of Timur to impose a true monarchy on the truculent Pashtun tribes, and their efforts to rule absolutely and without the advice of the other major Pashtun tribal leaders, were ultimately unsuccessful. The <a href="Sikhs">Sikhs</a> started rising to power in defense of the years of invasions of Punjab by the Afghanis. Zaman Shah was unsuccessful in subduing them. A young Sikh chief, <a href="Ranjit%20Singh">Ranjit Singh</a>, then succeeded in wresting power from Zaman's forces. Later when Zaman was blinded by his brother, it was Ranjit Singh who gave him asylum in Punjab.

Zaman's downfall was triggered by his attempts to consolidate power. Although it had been through the support of the Barakzai chief, Painda Khan Barakzai, that he had come to the throne, Zaman soon began to remove prominent Barakzai leaders from positions of power and replace them with men of his own lineage, the Sadozai. This upset the delicate balance of Durrani tribal politics that Ahmad Shah had established and may have prompted Painda Khan and other Durrani chiefs to plot against the shah. Painda Khan and the chiefs of the <a href="Nurzai">Nurzai</a> and the <a href="Alizai%20tribe">Alizai</a> Durrani clans were executed, as was the chief of the <a href="Qizilbash">Qizilbash</a> clan. Painda Khan's son fled to Iran and pledged the substantial support of his Barakzai followers to a rival claimant to the throne, Zaman's older brother, <a href="Mahmud%20Shah%20Durrani">Mahmud Shah</a>. The clans of the chiefs Zaman had executed joined forces with the rebels, and they took Kandahar without bloodshed.

Zeman Shah's overthrow in 1801 was not the end of civil strife in Afghanistan, but the beginning of even greater violence. Mahmud Shah's first reign lasted for only two years before he was replaced by <a href="Shuja%20Shah%20Durrani">Shuja Shah</a>.

Yet another of Timur Shah's sons, Shuja Shah (or Shah Shuja), ruled for only six years. On June 7, 1809, Shuja Shah signed a treaty with the <a href="British%20East%20India%20Company">British</a>, which included a clause stating that he would oppose the passage of foreign troops through his territories. This agreement, the first Afghan pact with a <a href="Europe">Europe</a>a power, stipulated joint action in case of <a href="France">Franco</a>-Persian aggression against Afghan or British dominions. Only a few weeks after signing the agreement, Shuja was deposed by his predecessor, Mahmud. Much later, he was reinstated by the British, ruling during 1839–1842. Two of his sons also ruled for a brief period in 1842.

Mahmud's second reign lasted nine years. Mahmud alienated the Barakzai, especially Fateh Khan, the son of Painda Khan, who was eventually seized and blinded. Revenge would later be sought and obtained by Fateh Khan's youngest brother, <a href="Dost%20Mohammad%20Khan">Dost Mohammad Khan</a>.

Ali Shah was another son of <a href="Timur%20Shah%20Durrani">Timur Shah</a>. He seized power for a brief period in 1818-19.

Ayub Shah was another son of Timur Shah, who deposed Sultan Ali Shah. He was himself later deposed, and presumably killed in 1823. The loss of Kashmir during his reign opened a new chapter in South Asian history.

Aimaq people

The Aimaq (), also transliterated as "Aimak" or "Aymaq", are a collection of <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>-speaking <a href="nomad">nomad</a>ic and semi-nomadic tribes. Aimaqs are found mostly throughout <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> in the Kyber and Balochistan region and in the West Central <a href="Highland%20%28geography%29">highland</a>s of <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, immediately to the north of <a href="Herat">Herat</a>, and also to a much lesser amount in the <a href="Khorasan%20Province">Khorasan Province</a> of <a href="Iran">Iran</a>. They speak a number of subdialects of the <a href="Aimaq%20dialect">Aimaq dialect</a> of <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>, however some southern groups of <a href="Taymani">Taymani</a> and Maleki Aymaqs have adopted <a href="Pashto%20language">Pashto</a>.

Aimaks were originally known as "chahar" ("four") Aymaqs: the Taimani (the main element in the population of <a href="Ghor">Ghor</a>), the <a href="Firozkohi">Firozkohi</a>, the <a href="Temuri">Temuri</a>, and the <a href="Jamshidi%20%28tribe%29">Jamshidi</a>. Other sources state that the <a href="Aimaq%20Hazara">Aimaq Hazara</a> are one of the "Chahar", with the Temuri instead being of the "lesser Aimaqs" or "Aimaq-e digar" ("other Aimaqs") along with the Tahiri, Zuri, Maleki, and Mishmast.

Aymāq is a Turkic and Mongolic word that means "tribe" or "grazing territory". <a href="Aimaq%20Hazara">Aimaq Hazara</a> and <a href="Taimuri">Taimuri</a> are most <a href="Mongoloid">Mongoloid</a> of the Aimaqs. The Temuri and Aimaq Hazaras live in <a href="yurt">yurt</a>s, whereas other Aimaqs live in traditional Afghan black tents.

Estimates of the Aimaq population vary between 250,000 and 500,000. They are largely <a href="Sunni%20Muslims">Sunni Muslims</a>, in contrast to the Hazara, who are mostly <a href="Shia%20Muslims">Shia Muslims</a>. The Temuri Aimaqs are of Mongolian origin, apparent in their physical appearance and their housing (Mongolian-style <a href="yurt">yurt</a>s). However, the Taimanis, Ferozkohis, and Jamshidis are of Iranian origin, and refer to themselves as Tajik; the majority of the Aimaqs in Afghanistan are of these latter three sub-groups.

Arcturus

Arcturus (), also designated Alpha Boötis (α Boötis, abbreviated Alpha Boo, α Boo), is the brightest <a href="star">star</a> in the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> of <a href="Bo%C3%B6tes">Boötes</a>, the <a href="list%20of%20brightest%20stars">fourth-brightest</a> in the night sky, and the brightest in the <a href="Northern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">northern celestial hemisphere</a>. Together with <a href="Spica">Spica</a> and <a href="Denebola">Denebola</a> (or <a href="Regulus">Regulus</a>, depending on the source), Arcturus is part of the <a href="Spring%20Triangle">Spring Triangle</a> <a href="Asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a> and, by extension, also of the <a href="Great%20Diamond">Great Diamond</a> along with the star <a href="Cor%20Caroli">Cor Caroli</a>.

Relatively close at 36.7 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s from the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, Arcturus is a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> of spectral type K0III—an ageing star around 7.1 billion years old that has used up its core hydrogen and moved off the main sequence. It is 1.08 ± 0.06 times as massive as the Sun, but has expanded to 25.4 ± 0.2 times its diameter and is around 170 times as luminous.

"α Boötis" (<a href="Latinisation%20of%20names">Latinised</a> to "Alpha Boötis") is the star's <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>.

The traditional name "Arcturus" derives from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> Ἀρκτοῦρος ("Arktouros") and means "Guardian of the Bear", ultimately from ἄρκτος ("arktos"), "bear" and οὖρος ("ouros"), "watcher, guardian". It has been known by this name since at least the time of <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a>. This is a reference to its being the brightest star in the constellation of Boötes (of which it forms the left foot), which is next to the constellations of <a href="Ursa%20Major">Ursa Major</a> and <a href="Ursa%20Minor">Ursa Minor</a>, the Greater and Lesser Bears.

In 2016, the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> organized a <a href="IAU%20Working%20Group%20on%20Star%20Names">Working Group on Star Names</a> (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included "Arcturus" for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

With an <a href="Apparent%20magnitude">apparent visual magnitude</a> of −0.05, Arcturus is the brightest star in the <a href="Northern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Northern celestial hemisphere</a> and the <a href="list%20of%20brightest%20stars">fourth-brightest star</a> in the <a href="night%20sky">night sky</a>, after <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a> (−1.46  apparent magnitude), <a href="Canopus%20%28star%29">Canopus</a> (−0.72) and <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a> (−0.27). However, Alpha Centauri is a <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a>, whose unresolved components to the naked eye are both fainter than Arcturus. This makes Arcturus the third-brightest individual star, just ahead of Alpha Centauri A, whose apparent magnitude is −0.01. The French mathematician and astronomer <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Morin%20%28mathematician%29">Jean-Baptiste Morin</a> observed Arcturus in the daytime with a telescope (a first for any star other than the Sun and <a href="supernova">supernova</a>e) in 1635, and Arcturus has been seen at or just before sunset with the naked eye.

Arcturus is visible from both <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s hemispheres as it is located 19° north of the <a href="celestial%20equator">celestial equator</a>. The star <a href="culmination">culminates</a> at midnight on 27 April, and at 9PM on June 10 being visible during the late northern spring or the southern autumn. From the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, an easy way to find Arcturus is to follow the arc of the handle of the <a href="Big%20Dipper">Big Dipper</a> (Plough). By continuing in this path, one can find <a href="Spica">Spica</a>, "Arc to Arcturus, then spike to <a href="Spica">Spica</a>".

Ptolemy described Arcturus as "subrufa" ("slightly red"): it has a B-V color index of +1.23, roughly midway between <a href="Pollux%20%28star%29">Pollux</a> (B-V +1.00) and <a href="Aldebaran">Aldebaran</a> (B-V +1.54).

<a href="Eta%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Eta Boötis</a>, or Muphrid, is only 3.3 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s distant from Arcturus, and would have a visual magnitude −2.5, whereas an observer on the former system would find Arcturus as bright as Venus as seen from Earth.

Based upon an annual <a href="parallax">parallax</a> shift of 88.83 <a href="Minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc%23Astronomy">milliarcseconds</a> as measured by the <a href="Hipparcos">Hipparcos</a> satellite, Arcturus is from the Sun (the margin of error is 0.54 milliarcseconds, translating to a margin of error of ±).

Arcturus is a <a href="stellar%20classification">type</a> K0 III <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> star. With an <a href="absolute%20magnitude">absolute magnitude</a> of −0.30 it is, together with <a href="Vega">Vega</a> and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>'s neighborhood. It is about 110 times brighter than the Sun in visible light wavelengths, but this underestimates its strength as much of the light it gives off is in the <a href="infrared">infrared</a>; total (<a href="Bolometric%20correction">bolometric</a>) power output is about 180 times that of the Sun. The lower output in visible light is due to a lower <a href="Luminous%20efficacy">efficacy</a> as the star has a lower <a href="effective%20temperature">surface temperature</a> than the Sun. With a near-infrared <a href="J%20band%20%28infrared%29">J band</a> <a href="Magnitude%20%28astronomy%29">magnitude</a> of −2.2, only <a href="Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a> (−2.9) and <a href="R%20Doradus">R Doradus</a> (−2.6) are brighter.

As the brightest K-type <a href="Giant%20star%23Red%20giants">giant</a> in the sky, it was the subject of an <a href="spectral%20atlas">atlas</a> of its <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible spectrum</a>, made from <a href="photographic%20plate">photographic</a> spectra taken with the <a href="Reflecting%20telescope%23Coud%C3%A9">coudé</a> <a href="spectrograph">spectrograph</a> of the <a href="Hooker%20telescope">Mt. Wilson 2.5m telescope</a> published in 1968, a key reference work for stellar spectroscopy. Subsequent spectral atlases

As a single star, the mass of Arcturus cannot be measured directly, but models suggest it is slightly larger than that of the Sun. Evolutionary matching to the observed physical parameters gives a mass of , while the oxygen isotope ratio for a <a href="Dredge-up">first Dredge-up</a> star gives a mass of .

Arcturus has been estimated to be around 6 billion to 8.5 billion years old, and is ascending the <a href="red%20giant%20branch">red giant branch</a> until it accumulates a large enough degenerate helium core to ignite the <a href="helium%20flash">helium flash</a>. It has likely exhausted the <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> from its <a href="Solar%20core">core</a> and is now in its active <a href="red%20giant">hydrogen shell burning</a> phase. It will continue to expand before entering <a href="horizontal%20branch">horizontal branch</a> stage of its life cycle.

As one of the brightest stars in the sky, Arcturus has been the subject of a number of studies in the emerging field of <a href="asteroseismology">asteroseismology</a>. Belmonte and colleagues carried out a radial velocity (Doppler shift of spectral lines) study of the star in April and May 1988, which showed variability with a frequency of the order of a few <a href="Hertz">microhertz</a>, the highest peak corresponding to 4.3 μHz (2.7 days) with an amplitude of 60 ms, with a <a href="frequency%20separation">frequency separation</a> of c. 5 μHz. They suggested that the most plausible explanation for the variability of Arcturus is stellar oscillations.

Asteroseismological measurements allow direct calculation of the mass and radius, giving values of and . This form of modelling is still relatively inaccurate, but a useful check on other models.

Astronomers term "metals" those elements with higher <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a>s than helium. Arcturus has an enrichment of <a href="alpha%20elements">alpha elements</a> relative to iron but only about a third of solar metallicity, Arcturus is possibly a <a href="Metallicity%23Population%20II%20stars">Population II star</a>.

Arcturus has a high <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a>, two <a href="Minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc%23Astronomy">arcseconds</a> a year, greater than any first magnitude star other than <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">α Centauri</a>. It is moving rapidly () relative to the Solar System, and is now almost at its closest point to the Sun. Closest approach will happen in about 4,000 years, when the star will be a few hundredths of a light-year closer to Earth than it is today. Arcturus is thought to be an <a href="old%20disk%20star">old disk star</a>, and appears to be moving with a group of 52 other such stars, known as the <a href="Arcturus%20stream">Arcturus stream</a>.

In antiquity, Arcturus was closer to the centre of the constellation.

"Hipparcos" also suggested that Arcturus is a <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a>, with the companion about twenty times dimmer than the primary and orbiting close enough to be at the very limits of humans' current ability to make it out. Recent results remain inconclusive, but do support the marginal "Hipparcos" detection of a binary companion.

In 1993, radial velocity measurements of <a href="Aldebaran">Aldebaran</a>, Arcturus and <a href="Pollux%20%28star%29">Pollux</a> showed that Arcturus exhibited a long-period radial velocity oscillation, which could be interpreted as a "substellar companion". This <a href="substellar%20object">substellar object</a> would be nearly 12 times the mass of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> and be located roughly at the same orbital distance from Arcturus as the Earth is from the Sun, at 1.1 <a href="Astronomical%20Unit">Astronomical Unit</a>s. However, all three stars surveyed showed similar oscillations yielding similar companion masses, and the authors concluded that the variation was likely to be intrinsic to the star rather than due to the gravitational effect of a companion. So far no substellar companion has been confirmed.

In <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>, Arcturus is one of two stars called "al-simāk" "the uplifted one" (the other is <a href="Spica">Spica</a>). Arcturus is specified as السماك الرامح "as-simāk ar-rāmiħ" "the uplifted one of the lancer". The term "Al Simak Al Ramih" has appeared in Al Achsasi Al Mouakket catalogue (translated into <a href="Latin">Latin</a> as "Al Simak Lanceator").

This has been variously <a href="Romanization">romanized</a> in the past, leading to obsolete variants such as "Aramec" and "Azimech". For example, the name "Alramih" is used in <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Geoffrey Chaucer</a>'s "<a href="Treatise%20on%20the%20Astrolabe">Treatise on the Astrolabe</a>" (1391). Another Arabic name is "Haris-el-sema", from "حارس السماء" "ħāris al-samā’" "the keeper of heaven". or " حارس الشمال" "ħāris al-shamāl’" "the keeper of north".

Arcturus was once again called by its classical name from the Renaissance onwards.

In <a href="Chinese%20astronomy">Chinese astronomy</a>, Arcturus is called "Da Jiao" (), because it is the brightest star in the <a href="Chinese%20constellation">Chinese constellation</a> called "<a href="Horn%20%28Chinese%20constellation%29">Jiao Xiu</a>" (). Later it become a part of another constellation "<a href="Neck%20%28Chinese%20constellation%29">Kang Xiu</a>" ().

In Indian <a href="Astrology">Astrology</a> or <a href="Jyoti%E1%B9%A3a">Vedic Astrology</a> or <a href="Sidereal%20astrology">Sidereal Astrology</a>, Arcturus is called "<a href="Swati%20the%20Star">Swati</a>" which is a word meaning "very beneficent" derived from the language <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>. It is the <a href="eponymous">eponymous</a> star of one of the <a href="nakshatra">nakshatra</a>s (lunar mansions) of <a href="Hindu%20astrology">Hindu astrology</a>.

In Indonesia, Arcturus is called "Bintang Biduk" (star of boat).

In <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, Arcturus is called "Mugi-boshi" (麦星), meaning "star of wheat".

The <a href="Wotjobaluk">Wotjobaluk</a> <a href="Koori">Koori</a> people of southeastern Australia knew Arcturus as "Marpean-kurrk", mother of "Djuit" (<a href="Antares">Antares</a>) and another star in Bootes, "Weet-kurrk" (<a href="Eta%20Bo%C3%B6tis">Muphrid</a>). Its appearance in the north signified the arrival of the larvae of the <a href="Formica">wood ant</a> (a food item) in spring. The beginning of summer was marked by the star's setting with the Sun in the west and the disappearance of the larvae. The people of <a href="Milingimbi%20Island">Milingimbi Island</a> in Arnhem Land saw Arcturus and Muphrid as man and woman, and took the appearance of Arcturus at sunrise as a sign to go and harvest "rakia" or <a href="Eleocharis">spikerush</a>. The Wailwun of northern New South Wales knew Arcturus as "Guembila" "red".

In <a href="Inuit%20astronomy">Inuit astronomy</a>, Arcturus is called the Old Man ("Uttuqalualuk" in <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a>) and The First Ones ("Sivulliik" in <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a>).

The <a href="Mi%27kmaq">Mi'kmaq</a> of eastern Canada saw Arcturus as "Kookoogwéss", the owl.

Arcturus had several names that described its significance to indigenous <a href="Polynesia">Polynesia</a>ns. In the <a href="Society%20Islands">Society Islands</a>, Arcturus, called "Ana-tahua-taata-metua-te-tupu-mavae" ("a pillar to stand by"), was one of the ten "pillars of the sky", bright stars that represented the ten heavens of the <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a>an afterlife. In <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, the pattern of Boötes was called "Hoku-iwa", meaning "stars of the frigate bird". This constellation marked the path for <a href="Hawaiiloa">Hawaiiloa</a> on his return to Hawaii from the South Pacific Ocean. The Hawaiians called Arcturus "Hoku-leʻa". It was equated to the <a href="Tuamotu">Tuamotu</a>an constellation "Te Kiva", meaning "<a href="frigate-bird">frigate-bird</a>", which could either represent the figure of Boötes or just Arcturus. However, Arcturus may instead be the Tuamotuan star called "Turu". The Hawaiian name for Arcturus as a single star was likely "Hoku-leʻa", which means "star of gladness", or "clear star". In the <a href="Marquesas%20Islands">Marquesas Islands</a>, Arcturus was probably called "Tau-tou" and was the star that ruled the month approximating January. The <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Maori</a> and <a href="Moriori%20people">Moriori</a> called it "Tautoru", a variant of the Marquesan name and a name shared with <a href="Orion%27s%20Belt">Orion's Belt</a>.

As one of the brightest stars in the sky, Arcturus has been significant to observers since antiquity.

Prehistoric <a href="Polynesian%20navigation">Polynesian navigators</a> knew Arcturus as "Hōkūleʻa", the "Star of Joy". Arcturus is the <a href="zenith">zenith</a> star of the <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a>. Using Hōkūleʻa and other stars, the Polynesians launched their double-hulled <a href="canoe">canoe</a>s from <a href="Tahiti">Tahiti</a> and the <a href="Marquesas%20Islands">Marquesas Islands</a>. Traveling east and north they eventually crossed the <a href="equator">equator</a> and reached the <a href="latitude">latitude</a> at which Arcturus would appear directly overhead in the summer <a href="night%20sky">night sky</a>. Knowing they had arrived at the exact latitude of the island chain, they sailed due west on the <a href="trade%20winds">trade winds</a> to landfall. If Hōkūleʻa could be kept directly overhead, they landed on the southeastern shores of the <a href="Hawaii%20%28island%29">Big Island</a> of <a href="Hawaii">Hawaiʻi</a>. For a return trip to Tahiti the navigators could use <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a>, the zenith star of that island. Since 1976, the <a href="Polynesian%20Voyaging%20Society">Polynesian Voyaging Society</a>'s "<a href="Hokulea">Hōkūle‘a</a>" has crossed the Pacific Ocean many times under navigators who have incorporated this <a href="wayfinding">wayfinding</a> technique in their non-instrument navigation.

In ancient <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, it was linked to the god <a href="Enlil">Enlil</a>, and also known as Shudun, "yoke", or SHU-PA of unknown derivation in the "Three Stars Each" <a href="Babylonian%20star%20catalogues">Babylonian star catalogues</a> and later <a href="MUL.APIN">MUL.APIN</a> around 1100 BC.

In <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Ancient Rome</a>, the star's celestial activity was supposed to portend tempestuous weather, and a personification of the star acts as narrator of the prologue to <a href="Plautus">Plautus</a>' comedy "<a href="Rudens%20%28play%29">Rudens</a>" (circa 211 BC).

In the Hebrew scriptures Arcturus is referred to in Job 38:32.

In the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, Arcturus was considered a <a href="Behenian%20fixed%20star">Behenian fixed star</a> and attributed to the stone <a href="Jasper">Jasper</a> and the <a href="Plantago">plantain</a> herb. <a href="Cornelius%20Agrippa">Cornelius Agrippa</a> listed its <a href="Kabbalah">kabbalistic</a> sign under the alternate name "Alchameth".

The <a href="Karandavyuha%20Sutra">Karandavyuha sutra</a>, compiled at the end of the 4th century or beginning of the 5th century C.E., names one of <a href="Avalokite%C5%9Bvara">Avalokiteshvara's</a> <a href="Samadhi">meditative absorptions</a> as "The face of Arcturus".

Arcturus achieved fame when its light was rumored to be the mechanism used to open the <a href="Century%20of%20Progress">1933 Chicago World's Fair</a>. The star was chosen as it was thought that light from Arcturus had started its journey at about the time of the <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">previous Chicago World's Fair</a> in 1893 (at 36.7 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s away, and the light actually started in 1896.

The star is featured in the 1977 documentary film "<a href="Powers%20of%20Ten%20%28film%29">Powers of Ten</a>", in which it is seen when a camera zooms from Earth to the whole of the known universe.

In the 2016 Sci-Fi film <a href="Passengers%20%282016%20film%29">Passengers</a>, the starship Avalon slingshots around a red giant called Arcturus about 31 years after leaving Earth.

Androphagi

Androphagi (<a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> : "Ἀνδροφάγοι" for "man-eaters") was an ancient nation of <a href="cannibalism">cannibals</a> north of <a href="Scythia">Scythia</a> (according to <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>), probably in the forests between the upper waters of the <a href="Dneiper%20River">Dnepr</a> and <a href="Don%20River%2C%20Russia">Don</a>. These people may have assisted the <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a> when King <a href="Darius%20the%20Great">Darius the Great</a> led a Persian invasion into what is now Southern Russia to punish the Scythians for their raids into the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a>.

<a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> first wrote of "andropophagi" in his "<a href="Histories%20%28Herodotus%29">Histories</a>", where he described them as one of several tribes near <a href="Scythia">Scythia</a>. An extra note indicates that the "andropophagi" are cannibals, as reflected in their name:

<a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> later wrote in his "<a href="Naturalis%20Historia">Naturalis Historia</a>" that the same cannibals near Scythia wore the <a href="scalp">scalp</a>s of men on their chest.

Historian Marija Gimbutas has hypothesized that "Androphagoi" is a Greek translation of *mard-xwaar "man-eater" in the old North Iranian language of the <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a>. From *mard-xwaar one can derive "Mordva" or "Mordvin", the Russian name of the Finno-Ugrian <a href="Erzya%20people">Erzya</a> and <a href="Moksha%20%28people%29">Moksha</a> peoples of east-central European Russia.

Albert Brooks

Albert Lawrence Brooks (born Albert Lawrence Einstein; July 22, 1947) is an American actor, filmmaker, author, and comedian. He received an <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> nomination for Best Supporting Actor for 1987's "<a href="Broadcast%20News%20%28film%29">Broadcast News</a>" and was widely praised for his performance in the 2011 film "<a href="Drive%20%282011%20film%29">Drive</a>". His voice acting credits include Marlin in "<a href="Finding%20Nemo">Finding Nemo</a>" (2003) and "<a href="Finding%20Dory">Finding Dory</a>" (2016), and recurring guest voices for "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>", including Russ Cargill in "<a href="The%20Simpsons%20Movie">The Simpsons Movie</a>" (2007). He has directed, written, and starred in several comedy films, such as "<a href="Modern%20Romance%20%28film%29">Modern Romance</a>" (1981), "<a href="Lost%20in%20America">Lost in America</a>" (1985), and "<a href="Defending%20Your%20Life">Defending Your Life</a>" (1991). He is also the author of "<a href="2030%20%28novel%29">2030: The Real Story of What Happens to America</a>" (2011).

Brooks was born in <a href="Beverly%20Hills">Beverly Hills</a>, California, the son of <a href="Thelma%20Leeds">Thelma Leeds</a> (née Goodman), a singer and actress, and <a href="Harry%20Einstein">Harry Parke</a>, a radio comedian who performed on <a href="Eddie%20Cantor">Eddie Cantor</a>'s radio program and was known as Parkyakarkus. His brothers are comedic actor <a href="Bob%20Einstein">Bob Einstein</a>, better known as a character he created named "<a href="Super%20Dave%20Osborne">Super Dave Osborne</a>", and for a recurring role in "<a href="Curb%20Your%20Enthusiasm">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>"; and Cliff Einstein, a partner and longtime chief creative officer at Los Angeles advertising agency Dailey & Associates. His half-brother was <a href="Charles%20Einstein">Charles Einstein</a> (1926–2007), a writer for such television programs as "<a href="Playhouse%2090">Playhouse 90</a>" and "<a href="Lou%20Grant%20%28TV%20series%29">Lou Grant</a>". Brooks is Jewish; his grandparents emigrated from <a href="Austria">Austria</a> and <a href="Russia">Russia</a>. He grew up among show business families in southern California, attending <a href="Beverly%20Hills%20High%20School">Beverly Hills High School</a> with <a href="Richard%20Dreyfuss">Richard Dreyfuss</a> and <a href="Rob%20Reiner">Rob Reiner</a>.

Brooks attended <a href="Carnegie%20Mellon%20University">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, but dropped out after one year to focus on his comedy career. By the age of 19, he had changed his professional name to Albert Brooks, joking that "the real <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> changed his name to sound more intelligent". He began a comedy career that quickly made him a regular on variety and talk shows during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Brooks led a new generation of self-reflective baby-boomer comics appearing on NBC's "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20Starring%20Johnny%20Carson">The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</a>". His onstage persona, that of an <a href="egotistical">egotistical</a>, <a href="narcissistic">narcissistic</a>, nervous comic, an ironic showbiz insider who punctured himself before an audience by disassembling his mastery of comedic stagecraft, influenced other '70s <a href="post-modern">post-modern</a> comedians, including <a href="Steve%20Martin">Steve Martin</a>, <a href="Martin%20Mull">Martin Mull</a>, and <a href="Andy%20Kaufman">Andy Kaufman</a>.

After two successful comedy albums, "Comedy Minus One" (1973) and the <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>–nominated "A Star Is Bought" (1975), Brooks left the stand-up circuit to try his hand as a filmmaker. He had already made his first short film, "The Famous Comedians School", a satiric short and an early example of the <a href="mockumentary">mockumentary</a> subgenre that appeared on the <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20Service">PBS</a> show <a href="The%20Great%20American%20Dream%20Machine">The Great American Dream Machine</a> in 1972.

In 1975, he directed six short films for the first season of <a href="NBC">NBC</a>'s "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>":


In 1976 he appeared in his first mainstream film role, in <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>'s landmark "<a href="Taxi%20Driver">Taxi Driver</a>"; Scorsese allowed Brooks to improvise much of his dialogue. The role reflected Brooks's decision to move to Los Angeles to enter the film business. In an interview, Brooks mentioned a conversation he'd had with "Taxi Driver" screenwriter <a href="Paul%20Schrader">Paul Schrader</a>, in which Schrader said that Brooks's character was the only one in the movie that he could not "understand" – a remark that Brooks found amusing, as the movie's antihero was a psychotic loner.

Brooks directed his first feature film, "<a href="Real%20Life%20%281979%20film%29">Real Life</a>", in 1979. The film, in which Brooks (playing a version of himself) obnoxiously films a typical suburban family in an effort to win both an <a href="Academy%20award">Oscar</a> and a Nobel Prize, was a sendup of <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20Service">PBS</a>'s "<a href="An%20American%20Family">An American Family</a>" documentary. It has also been viewed as foretelling the future emergence of reality television. Brooks also made a cameo appearance in the film "<a href="Private%20Benjamin%20%281980%20film%29">Private Benjamin</a>" (1980), starring <a href="Goldie%20Hawn">Goldie Hawn</a>. (He also got starring credits in the film, even though his character dies within roughly the first half-hour of the film.)

Through the 1980s and 1990s, Brooks co-wrote (with longtime collaborator <a href="Monica%20Johnson">Monica Johnson</a>), directed and starred in a series of well-received comedies, playing variants on his standard neurotic and self-obsessed character. These include <a href="1981%20in%20film">1981's</a> "<a href="Modern%20Romance%20%28film%29">Modern Romance</a>", where Brooks played a film editor desperate to win back his ex-girlfriend (<a href="Kathryn%20Harrold">Kathryn Harrold</a>). The film received a limited release and ultimately grossed under $3 million domestically, but was well received by critics, with one reviewer commenting that the film was "not Brooks at his best, but still amusing". His best-received film, "<a href="Lost%20in%20America">Lost in America</a>" (1985), featured Brooks and <a href="Julie%20Hagerty">Julie Hagerty</a> as a couple who leave their <a href="yuppie">yuppie</a> lifestyle and drop out of society to live in a motor home as they have always dreamed of doing, meeting disappointment.

Brooks's "<a href="Defending%20Your%20Life">Defending Your Life</a>" (1991) placed his lead character in the <a href="afterlife">afterlife</a>, put on trial to justify his human fears and determine his cosmic fate. Critics responded to the offbeat premise and the chemistry between Brooks and <a href="Meryl%20Streep">Meryl Streep</a>, as his post-death love interest. His later efforts did not find large audiences, but still retained Brooks's touch as a filmmaker. He garnered positive reviews for "<a href="Mother%20%281996%20film%29">Mother</a>" (1996), which starred Brooks as a middle-aged writer moving back home to resolve tensions between himself and his mother (<a href="Debbie%20Reynolds">Debbie Reynolds</a>). <a href="1999%20in%20film">1999's</a> "<a href="The%20Muse%20%281999%20film%29">The Muse</a>" featured Brooks as a Hollywood screenwriter who has "lost his edge" using the services of an authentic <a href="muse">muse</a> (<a href="Sharon%20Stone">Sharon Stone</a>) for inspiration. In an interview with Brooks with regards to "The Muse", Gavin Smith wrote, "Brooks's distinctive film making style is remarkably discreet and unemphatic; he has a light, deft touch, with a classical precision and economy, shooting and cutting his scenes in smooth, seamless successions of medium shots, with clean, high-key lighting."

Brooks has appeared as a guest voice on "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" five times during its run (always under the name "A. Brooks"), and is described as the best guest star in the show's history by <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, particularly for his role as supervillain <a href="Hank%20Scorpio">Hank Scorpio</a> in the episode "<a href="You%20Only%20Move%20Twice">You Only Move Twice</a>".

Brooks also acted in other writers' and directors' films during the 1980s and 1990s. He had a cameo in the opening scene of "", playing a driver whose passenger (<a href="Dan%20Aykroyd">Dan Aykroyd</a>) has a shocking secret. In <a href="James%20L.%20Brooks">James L.

Antares

Antares (), also designated Alpha Scorpii (α Scorpii, abbreviated Alpha Sco, α Sco), is on average <a href="list%20of%20brightest%20stars">the fifteenth-brightest star</a> in the night sky, and the brightest star in the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> of <a href="Scorpius">Scorpius</a>. Distinctly reddish when viewed with the naked eye, Antares is a <a href="slow%20irregular%20variable">slow irregular variable</a> star that ranges in brightness from <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> +0.6 to +1.6. Often referred to as "the heart of the scorpion", Antares is flanked by <a href="Sigma%20Scorpii">Sigma</a> and <a href="Tau%20Scorpii">Tau Scorpii</a> in the centre of the constellation.

Classified as a <a href="red%20supergiant">red supergiant</a> of <a href="stellar%20classification%23Spectral%20types">spectral type</a> <a href="Stellar%20classification%23Class%20M">M1.5Iab</a>, Antares is one of the <a href="list%20of%20largest%20stars">largest</a> known stars. It is the brightest, most massive, and most evolved stellar member of the nearest <a href="stellar%20association">OB association</a> (the <a href="Scorpius%E2%80%93Centaurus%20Association">Scorpius–Centaurus Association</a>). Antares is a member of the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius–Centaurus Association, which contains thousands of stars with mean age 11 million years at a distance of approximately . It is thought to be between 15 and 18 times as massive as the Sun, and have around 883 times its radius. Hence, if placed in the center of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>, its outer surface would lie between the orbits of <a href="Mars">Mars</a> and <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>.

"α Scorpii" (<a href="Latinisation%20of%20names">Latinised</a> to "Alpha Scorpii") is the star's <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>. It also has the <a href="Flamsteed%20designation">Flamsteed designation</a> 21 Scorpii, as well as catalogue designations such as HR 6134 in the <a href="Bright%20Star%20Catalogue">Bright Star Catalogue</a> and HD 148478 in the <a href="Henry%20Draper%20Catalogue">Henry Draper Catalogue</a>. As a prominent <a href="infrared">infrared</a> source, it appears in the <a href="Two%20Micron%20All-Sky%20Survey">Two Micron All-Sky Survey</a> catalogue as 2MASS J16292443-2625549 and the <a href="Two%20Micron%20All-Sky%20Survey">Two Micron All-Sky Survey</a> catalogue as IRAS 16262-2619. It is also catalogued as a double star <a href="Washington%20Double%20Star%20Catalog">WDS</a> J16294-2626 and <a href="Catalog%20of%20Components%20of%20Double%20and%20Multiple%20Stars">CCDM</a> J16294-2626.

The traditional name "Antares" derives from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20language">Ancient Greek</a> , meaning "equal to-<a href="Ares">Ares</a>" ("equal to-Mars"), due to the similarity of its <a href="red">red</a>dish hue to the appearance of the planet <a href="Mars">Mars</a>. The comparison of Antares with Mars may have originated with early <a href="Babylonian%20astronomy">Mesopotamian astronomers</a>. However, some scholars have speculated that the star may have been named after <a href="Antarah%20ibn%20Shaddad">Antar</a>, or Antarah ibn Shaddad, the <a href="Arabs">Arab</a> warrior-hero celebrated in the pre-Islamic poems <a href="Mu%27allaqat">Mu'allaqat</a>. In 2016, the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> organised a <a href="IAU%20Working%20Group%20on%20Star%20Names">Working Group on Star Names</a> (WGSN) to catalog and standardise proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included "Antares" for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

Antares is a variable star and is listed in the <a href="General%20Catalogue%20of%20Variable%20Stars">General Catalogue of Variable Stars</a> but as a Bayer-designated star it does not have a separate <a href="variable%20star%20designation">variable star designation</a>.

Antares is a <a href="supergiant%20star">supergiant star</a> with a <a href="stellar%20classification">stellar classification</a> of M1.5Iab. With a radius that is approximately 883 times that of the Sun, it is <a href="List%20of%20largest%20stars">one of largest stars</a>, if placed in the center of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>, its outer surface would lie between the orbits of <a href="Mars">Mars</a> and <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. Based upon <a href="parallax">parallax</a> measurements, Antares is approximately from the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>. Its visual <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> is about 10,000 times that of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, but because the star radiates a considerable part of its energy in the <a href="infrared">infrared</a> part of the <a href="spectrum">spectrum</a>, the <a href="Bolometer">bolometric</a> luminosity equals roughly 65,000 times that of the Sun. The mass of the star has been calculated to be in the range of 15 to 18 <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>es. A 2012 analysis by Pecaut and colleagues comparing the effective temperature and luminosity of Antares to theoretical evolutionary tracks for massive stars which include rotation an initial progenitor mass of approximately 17 <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>es and an age of 12 million years. Initial mass must also take into account the mass loss from powerful winds, and this would yield a less massive star not stated in this reference paper.

The size of Antares may be calculated using its parallax and angular diameter. The parallax angle is given in the adjacent box, and the angular diameter is known from lunar occultation measurements (41.3 ± 0.1 <a href="Minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc%23Symbols%20and%20abbreviations">milliarcseconds</a>). This implies a radius of 890 ± 150 <a href="solar%20radius">solar radii</a> at this distance. By analysing its radial velocity from its spectrum, Pugh and colleagues calculated a period of 5.93 ± 0.01 years and considered whether this change was orbital or pulsational. If the latter, then the radius of the star changes by 165 ± 22 solar radii (19% ± 4%). However, if this were the case, Antares' brightness would vary by a greater amount.

Antares is a type "LC" <a href="slow%20irregular%20variable">slow irregular variable</a> star, whose apparent magnitude slowly varies from +0.6 to +1.6.

Antares is visible in the sky all night around May 31 of each year, when the star is at <a href="opposition%20%28astronomy%20and%20astrology%29">opposition</a> to the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>. At this time, Antares rises at dusk and sets at dawn as seen at the equator. For approximately two to three weeks on either side of November 30, Antares is not visible in the night sky, because it is near <a href="Conjunction%20%28astronomy%20and%20astrology%29">conjunction</a> with the Sun; this period of invisibility is longer in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a> than in the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>, since the star's <a href="declination">declination</a> is significantly south of the celestial equator.

Antares is one of the four first magnitude stars that lies within 6.5° of the ecliptic (the others are <a href="Spica">Spica</a>, <a href="Regulus">Regulus</a> and <a href="Aldebaran">Aldebaran</a>) and therefore can be <a href="Occultation">occulted</a> by the Moon. It can also, rarely, be occulted by <a href="Venus">Venus</a>. The last occultation of Antares by Venus took place on September 17, 525 BC; the next one will take place on November 17, 2400. Other planets have not occulted Antares in the last millennium nor will they do so in the next millennium, as they pass as a result of their actual node position and inclination always northward of Antares. On 31 July 2009, Antares was occulted by the Moon. The event was visible in much of southern Asia and the Middle East. Every year around December 2 the Sun passes 5° north of Antares.

Antares has a magnitude 5.5 companion star, Antares B, that changed from an angular separation (from its primary, Antares A) of 3.3 <a href="Minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc%23Symbols%20and%20abbreviations">arcseconds</a> in 1854 to 2.86 arcseconds in 1990. It was first observed by Scottish astronomer <a href="James%20William%20Grant%20%28astronomer%29">James William Grant</a> <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society%20of%20Edinburgh">FRSE</a> while in <a href="India">India</a> on 23 July 1844. The last is equal to a <a href="projected%20separation">projected separation</a> of about 529 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s (au) at the estimated distance of Antares, giving a minimum value for the separation of the pair. Spectroscopic examination of the energy states in the outflow of matter from the companion star suggests that it is about 224 au beyond the primary. Antares B is a <a href="B-type%20main-sequence%20star">blue-white main-sequence star</a> of spectral type B2.5V; it also has numerous unusual spectral lines suggesting it has been polluted by matter ejected by Antares A.

The companion star is normally difficult to see in small telescopes due to glare from Antares A, but can sometimes be seen in apertures over . The companion is often described as green, but this is probably either a <a href="contrast%20effect">contrast effect</a>, or the result of the mixing of light from the two stars when they are seen together through a telescope and are too close to be completely resolved. Antares B can sometimes be observed with a small telescope for a few seconds during lunar <a href="occultation">occultation</a>s while Antares A is hidden by the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>. It was discovered by <a href="Johann%20Tobias%20B%C3%BCrg">Johann Tobias Bürg</a> during one such occultation on April 13, 1819, but until its existence was confirmed in 1846 it was thought by some to be merely the light of Antares viewed through the Moon's atmosphere (which at the time was theorised to exist). When observed by itself during such an occultation, the companion appears a profound blue or bluish-green color.

The orbit of the companion star is poorly known, as attempts to analyse the radial velocity of Antares need to be unravelled from the star's own pulsations. <a href="Orbital%20period">Orbital period</a>s are possible within a range of 1,200 to 2,562 years.

Antares, like the similarly-sized red giant <a href="Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a> in the constellation Orion, will almost certainly explode as a <a href="supernova">supernova</a>, probably within the next few hundred thousand years. For a few months, the Antares supernova could be as bright as the full moon and be visible in daytime.

In the <a href="Babylonian%20star%20catalogues">Babylonian star catalogues</a> dating from at least 1100 BCE, Antares was called GABA GIR.TAB, "the Breast of the Scorpion". In <a href="MUL.APIN">MUL.APIN</a>, which dates between 1100 and 700 BC, it is one of the stars of Ea in the southern sky and marks breast of the Scorpion goddess Ishhara. Later names that translate as "the Heart of Scorpion" include ' from the Arabic '. This had been directly translated from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> '. ' translated above Greek name into <a href="Latin">Latin</a>."

In ancient <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, Antares may have been known by the following names: Urbat, Bilu-sha-ziri ("the Lord of the Seed"), Kak-shisa ("the Creator of Prosperity"), Dar Lugal ("The King"), Masu Sar ("the Hero and the King"), and Kakkab Bir ("the Vermilion Star"). In ancient <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, Antares represented the scorpion goddess <a href="Serket">Serket</a> (and was the symbol of <a href="Isis">Isis</a> in the pyramidal ceremonies).

In <a href="Persia">Persia</a>, Antares was known as "Satevis", one of the four "<a href="royal%20stars">royal stars</a>". In <a href="India">India</a>, it with <a href="Sigma%20Scorpii">Sigma</a> and <a href="Tau%20Scorpii">Tau Scorpii</a> were <a href="Jyeshtha%20%28nakshatra%29">Jyeshthā</a> (the eldest or biggest), one of the "<a href="nakshatra">nakshatra</a>" (<a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> <a href="lunar%20mansion">lunar mansion</a>s). The ancient Chinese called Antares "()", because it was the second-brightest star of the mansion "<a href="Heart%20%28Chinese%20constellation%29">Xin</a>" (心). It was the national star of the <a href="Shang%20Dynasty">Shang Dynasty</a>, and it was sometimes referred to as () because of its reddish appearance.

The <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori people</a> of New Zealand call Antares "Rehua", and regard it as the chief of all the stars. Rehua is father of "<a href="Puanga">Puanga</a>/Puaka" (<a href="Rigel">Rigel</a>), an important star in the calculation of the Māori calendar. The Wotjobaluk <a href="Koori">Koori</a> people of Victoria, Australia, knew Antares as "Djuit", son of "Marpean-kurrk" (<a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a>); the stars on each side represented his wives. The Kulin Kooris saw Antares ("Balayang") as the brother of "Bunjil" (<a href="Altair">Altair</a>).

Aldebaran

Aldebaran, designated Alpha Tauri (α Tauri, abbreviated Alpha Tau, α Tau), is an orange <a href="giant%20star">giant star</a> located about 65 <a href="light%20year">light year</a>s from the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> in the <a href="zodiac">zodiac</a> <a href="constellation">constellation</a> of <a href="Taurus%20%28constellation%29">Taurus</a>. It is the brightest star in its constellation and usually the <a href="list%20of%20brightest%20stars">fourteenth-brightest star</a> in the nighttime sky, though it varies slowly in brightness between magnitude 0.75 and 0.95. It is likely that Aldebaran hosts a planet several times the size of Jupiter.

The planetary exploration probe <a href="Pioneer%2010">Pioneer 10</a> is currently heading in the general direction of the star and should make its closest approach in about two million years.

"Alpha Tauri" is the star's <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>. The name "Aldebaran" is <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> (' ') and means "the Follower", presumably because it rises near and soon after the <a href="Pleiades">Pleiades</a>. In 2016, the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> organized a <a href="IAU%20Working%20Group%20on%20Star%20Names">Working Group on Star Names</a> (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included "Aldebaran" for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

In <a href="Persia">Persia</a> it was known as Tascheter.

In <a href="Brazilian%20Portuguese">Brazilian Portuguese</a> it was known as "Aquele Que Segue" or "Olho do Touro"

The <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> called it ".

In the Middle Ages it was sometimes called Cor Tauri (the Heart of the Bull/Taurus).

<a href="John%20Gower">John Gower</a> refers to it as Aldeboran.

In <a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a> it is known as (", the Fifth Star of the Net).

In <a href="Hindu%20astronomy">Hindu astronomy</a> it is identified as the <a href="Rohini%20%28nakshatra%29">lunar mansion Rohini</a> ("the red one") and as one of the twenty-seven daughters of <a href="Daksha">Daksha</a> and the wife of the god <a href="Chandra">Chandra</a> (moon).

This easily seen and striking star in its suggestive asterism is a popular subject for ancient and modern myths.

On 11 March AD 509, a lunar <a href="occultation">occultation</a> of Aldebaran was observed in <a href="Athens%2C%20Greece">Athens, Greece</a>. English astronomer <a href="Edmund%20Halley">Edmund Halley</a> studied the timing of this event, and in 1718 concluded that Aldebaran must have changed position since that time, moving several minutes of arc further to the north. This, as well as observations of the changing positions of stars <a href="Sirius">Sirius</a> and <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a>, led to the discovery of <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a>. Based on present day observations, the position of Aldebaran has shifted 7′ in the last 2000 years; roughly a quarter the diameter of the full Moon. Note that 5,000 years ago the <a href="vernal%20equinox">vernal equinox</a> was close to Aldebaran.

English astronomer <a href="William%20Herschel">William Herschel</a> discovered a faint companion to Aldebaran in 1782; an 11th magnitude star at an <a href="angular%20separation">angular separation</a> of 117<a href="arc%20second">″</a>. This star was shown to be itself a close <a href="double%20star">double star</a> by <a href="Sherburne%20Wesley%20Burnham">S. W. Burnham</a> in 1888, and he discovered an additional 14th magnitude companion at an angular separation of 31″. Follow on measurements of proper motion showed that Herschel's companion was diverging from Aldebaran, and hence they were not physically connected. However, the companion discovered by Burnham had almost exactly the same proper motion as Aldebaran, suggesting that the two formed a wide <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> system.

Working at his private observatory in <a href="Tulse%20Hill">Tulse Hill</a>, England, in 1864 <a href="William%20Huggins">William Huggins</a> performed the first studies of the spectrum of Aldebaran, where he was able to identify the lines of nine elements, including iron, sodium, calcium, and magnesium. In 1886, <a href="Edward%20Charles%20Pickering">Edward C. Pickering</a> at the <a href="Harvard%20College%20Observatory">Harvard College Observatory</a> used a photographic plate to capture fifty <a href="absorption%20line">absorption line</a>s in the spectrum of Aldebaran. This became part of the <a href="Henry%20Draper%20Catalogue">Draper Catalogue</a>, published in 1890. By 1887, the photographic technique had improved to the point that it was possible to measure a star's <a href="radial%20velocity">radial velocity</a> from the amount of <a href="Doppler%20shift">Doppler shift</a> in the spectrum. By this means, the recession velocity of Aldebaran was estimated as (48 km/s), using measurements performed at <a href="Potsdam%20Observatory">Potsdam Observatory</a> by <a href="Hermann%20Carl%20Vogel">Hermann C. Vogel</a> and his assistant <a href="Julius%20Scheiner">Julius Scheiner</a>.

Aldebaran was observed using an interferometer attached to the <a href="Hooker%20Telescope">Hooker Telescope</a> at the <a href="Mount%20Wilson%20Observatory">Mount Wilson Observatory</a> in 1921 in order to measure its <a href="angular%20diameter">angular diameter</a>, but it was not resolved in these observations. 

Aldebaran is <a href="stellar%20classification">classified</a> as a <a href="K-type%20giant">type K5 III star</a>, which indicates it is an orange-hued giant star that has evolved off the <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> band of the <a href="Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell%20diagram">Hertzsprung–Russell diagram</a> after exhausting the <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> at its core. The collapse of the centre of the star into a degenerate helium core has ignited a shell of hydrogen outside the core and Aldebaran is now a red giant. This has caused it to expand to 44.2 times the diameter of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, equivalent to approximately 61 million kilometres (see <a href="10%20gigametres">10 gigametres</a> for similar sizes).

Measurements by the <a href="Hipparcos">Hipparcos</a> satellite and other sources put Aldebaran around away. Stellar models predict it only has about 50% more mass than the Sun, yet it shines with 425 times the Sun's luminosity due to the expanded radius. Aldebaran is a slightly <a href="variable%20star">variable star</a>, of the <a href="slow%20irregular%20variable">slow irregular variable</a> type "LB". It varies by about 0.2 in apparent magnitude from 0.75 to 0.95. With a near-<a href="infrared">infrared</a> <a href="J%20band%20%28infrared%29">J band</a> <a href="Magnitude%20%28astronomy%29">magnitude</a> of −2.1, only <a href="Betelgeuse">Betelgeuse</a> (−2.9), <a href="R%20Doradus">R Doradus</a> (−2.6), and <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a> (−2.2) are brighter.

The <a href="photosphere">photosphere</a> shows abundances of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen that suggest the giant has gone through its first <a href="dredge-up">dredge-up</a> stage—a normal step in the evolution of a star into a red giant during which material from deep within the star is brought up to the surface by <a href="Convection%20zone">convection</a>. With its slow rotation, Aldebaran lacks a <a href="Dynamo%20theory">dynamo</a> needed to generate a <a href="corona">corona</a> and hence is not a source of <a href="X-ray%20astronomy">hard X-ray emission</a>. However, small scale <a href="Stellar%20magnetic%20field">magnetic fields</a> may still be present in the lower atmosphere, resulting from convection turbulence near the surface. (The measured strength of the magnetic field on Aldebaran is 0.22 <a href="Gauss%20%28unit%29">G</a>.) Any resulting soft X-ray emissions from this region may be attenuated by the <a href="chromosphere">chromosphere</a>, although ultraviolet emission has been detected in the spectrum. The star is currently losing mass at a rate of with a velocity of . This <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a> may be generated by the weak magnetic fields in the lower atmosphere.

Beyond the chromosphere of Aldebaran is an extended molecular outer atmosphere (MOLsphere) where the temperature is cool enough for molecules of gas to form. This region lies between 1.2 and 2.8 times the radius of the star, with temperatures of 1,000−2,000 K. The spectrum reveals lines of <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a>, water, and <a href="titanium%20oxide">titanium oxide</a>. Past this radius, the modest outflow of the stellar wind itself declines in temperature to about 7,500 K at a distance of 1 <a href="Astronomical%20Unit">Astronomical Unit</a> (AU)−the distance of the Earth from the Sun. The wind continues to expand until it reaches the <a href="termination%20shock">termination shock</a> boundary with the hot, ionized <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a> that dominates the <a href="Local%20Bubble">Local Bubble</a>, forming a roughly spherical <a href="astrosphere">astrosphere</a> with a radius of around 1,000 AU, centered on Aldebaran.

Aldebaran is one of the easiest stars to find in the <a href="night%20sky">night sky</a>, partly due to its brightness and partly due to its spatial relation to one of the more noticeable <a href="asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterisms</a> in the sky. If one follows the three stars of <a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">Orion</a>'s belt from left to right (in the Northern Hemisphere) or right to left (in the Southern), the first bright star found by continuing that line is Aldebaran.

Since the star is located (by chance) in the line of sight between the Earth and the Hyades, it has the appearance of being the brightest member of the more scattered <a href="Hyades%20%28star%20cluster%29">Hyades</a> <a href="open%20star%20cluster">open star cluster</a> that makes up the bull's-head-shaped asterism; however, the star cluster is actually more than twice as far away, at about 150 light years.

Aldebaran is close enough to the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a> to be <a href="Occultation">occulted</a> by the <a href="Moon">Moon</a>. Such occultations occur when the Moon's <a href="ascending%20node">ascending node</a> is near the <a href="autumnal%20equinox">autumnal equinox</a>. A series of 49 occultations occur starting at 29 Jan 2015 and ending at 3 Sep 2018. Each event is visible from a different location on Earth, but always in the northern hemisphere or close to the equator. That means that people in e.g. Australia or South Africa can never observe an Aldebaran occultation. This is due to the fact that Aldebaran is slightly too far south of the ecliptic. A reasonably accurate estimate for the diameter of Aldebaran was obtained during the September 22, 1978 occultation. Aldebaran is in <a href="Conjunction%20%28astronomy%20and%20astrology%29">conjunction</a> with the Sun around June 1 of each year.

Occultations by planets are not possible at present, as each planet passes Aldebaran north. The closest conjunction of a planet with Aldebaran in the 21st century occurred on July 9, 2012, when Venus passed Aldebaran 56' northward. However, in the far future and far past occultations of Aldebaran by Mercury and Venus occurred as result of wandering nodes. The next occultation of Aldebaran by a planet, Venus, will occur on 5366 August 27.

Five faint stars are positioned so that they appear close to Aldebaran. These <a href="double%20stars">double stars</a> were given alphabetic secondary star designations more or less in the order of their discovery, with the letter A reserved for the primary star. Some of the characteristics of these components, including their position relative to Aldebaran, are listed in the table at right.

Some surveys have indicated that Alpha Tauri B may have about the same <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> and <a href="parallax">parallax</a> as Aldebaran and thus may be a <a href="binary%20star">physical binary</a> system. However these measurements are difficult to make because the dim B component appears so close to the bright primary star. The resulting margin of error is too large to positively establish (or exclude) a physical relationship between the two stars. So far neither the B component, nor anything else, has been unambiguously shown to be physically associated with Aldebaran.

Alpha Tauri CD is a <a href="binary%20star">binary system</a> with the C and D component stars gravitationally bound to and co-orbiting each other. These co-orbiting stars have been shown to be located far beyond Aldebaran and are members of the Hyades star cluster. As with the rest of the stars in the cluster they do not physically interact with Aldebaran in any way.

In 1993, radial velocity measurements of Aldebaran, <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a> and <a href="Pollux%20%28star%29">Pollux</a> showed that Aldebaran exhibited a long-period radial velocity oscillation, which could be interpreted as a "substellar companion". The measurements for Aldebaran implied a companion with a minimum mass 11.4 times that of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> in a 643-day orbit at a separation of in a mildly <a href="Eccentricity%20%28orbit%29">eccentric</a> orbit. However, all three stars surveyed showed similar oscillations yielding similar companion masses, and the authors concluded that the variation was likely to be intrinsic to the star rather than due to the gravitational effect of a companion. In 2015 a study showed stable longterm evidence for both a planetary companion and stellar activity.
If the sun were to be observed from this star, it would be a faint 6.4 magnitude star located between <a href="Ophiuchus%20%28constellation%29">Ophiuchus</a> and <a href="Scorpius%20%28constellation%29">Scorpius</a> on the diametrically opposite coordinates. This magnitude sits between <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a>'s 5.95 and <a href="2%20Pallas">Pallas</a>'s 6.49.

While some <a href="constellation">constellation</a>s made of bright, distant stars would be more or less similar the rest of the night sky would be unfamiliar to someone from <a href="Earth">Earth</a>. To highlight differences, <a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">Orion</a> would have its <a href="Orion%27s%20Belt">belt</a> reduced to two stars due to <a href="Mintaka">Mintaka</a> being on top of <a href="Alnilam">Alnilam</a>. Furthermore, <a href="Bellatrix">Bellatrix</a> would be closer to the said belt, giving the constellation an overall ribbon-like shape. 

Conversely, the <a href="Hyades%20%28star%20cluster%29">Hyades</a> and <a href="Pleiades">Pleiades</a> would be in similar regions of the sky due to their enormous distance even from this star (they are located 153 <a href="light%20year">ly</a> and 444 ly, respectively).

Altair

Altair (), also designated Alpha Aquilae (α Aquilae, abbreviated Alpha Aql, α Aql), is the brightest <a href="star">star</a> in the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> of <a href="Aquila%20%28constellation%29">Aquila</a> and the <a href="list%20of%20brightest%20stars">twelfth brightest star</a> in the night sky. It is currently in the <a href="G-cloud">G-cloud</a>—a nearby accumulation of gas and dust known as an <a href="interstellar%20cloud">interstellar cloud</a>. Altair is an <a href="A-type%20star">A-type</a> <a href="main%20sequence%20star">main sequence star</a> with an apparent <a href="visual%20magnitude">visual magnitude</a> of 0.77 and is one of the vertices of the <a href="Asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a> known as the <a href="Summer%20Triangle">Summer Triangle</a> (the other two vertices are marked by <a href="Deneb">Deneb</a> and <a href="Vega">Vega</a>). It is 16.7 <a href="light-years">light-years</a> (5.13 <a href="parsec">parsec</a>s) from the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> and is one of the <a href="List%20of%20nearest%20stars">closest stars</a> visible to the naked eye.

Altair rotates rapidly, with a velocity at the <a href="equator">equator</a> of approximately 286 km/s. This is a significant fraction of the star's estimated breakup speed of 400 km/s. A study with the <a href="Palomar%20Testbed%20Interferometer">Palomar Testbed Interferometer</a> revealed that Altair is not spherical, but is flattened at the poles due to its high rate of rotation. Other <a href="interferometric">interferometric</a> studies with multiple telescopes, operating in the <a href="infrared">infrared</a>, have imaged and confirmed this phenomenon.

"α Aquilae" (<a href="Latinisation%20of%20names">Latinised</a> to "Alpha Aquilae") is the star's <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>. The traditional name "Altair" has been used since medieval times. It is an abbreviation of the <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> phrase , "al-nesr al-ṭā’ir" (""). In 2016, the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> organized a <a href="IAU%20Working%20Group%20on%20Star%20Names">Working Group on Star Names</a> (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included "Altair" for this star. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

Along with <a href="Beta%20Aquilae">Beta Aquilae</a> and <a href="Gamma%20Aquilae">Gamma Aquilae</a>, Altair forms the well-known line of stars sometimes referred to as the "Family of Aquila" or "Shaft of Aquila".

Altair is a <a href="Type-A%20star">type-A</a> <a href="main%20sequence%20star">main sequence star</a> with approximately 1.8 times the <a href="mass">mass</a> of the Sun and 11 times its <a href="luminosity%20%28astronomy%29">luminosity</a>. Altair possesses an extremely rapid rate of rotation; it has a rotational period of approximately 9 hours. For comparison, the equator of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> requires a little more than 25 days for a complete rotation. This rapid rotation forces Altair to be <a href="oblate%20spheroid">oblate</a>; its equatorial diameter is over 20 percent greater than its polar diameter.

Satellite measurements made in 1999 with the <a href="Wide%20Field%20Infrared%20Explorer">Wide Field Infrared Explorer</a> showed that the brightness of Altair fluctuates slightly, varying by just a few thousandths of a magnitude with several different periods less than 2 hours. As a result, it was identified in 2005 as a <a href="Delta%20Scuti%20variable">Delta Scuti variable</a> star. Its <a href="light%20curve">light curve</a> can be approximated by adding together a number of <a href="sine%20wave">sine wave</a>s, with periods that range between 0.8 and 1.5 hours. It is a weak source of <a href="corona">corona</a>l <a href="X-ray%20astronomy">X-ray</a> emission, with the most active sources of emission being located near the star's equator. This activity may be due to <a href="Convection%20zone">convection</a> cells forming at the cooler equator.

The angular diameter of Altair was measured <a href="interferometrically">interferometrically</a> by <a href="R.%20Hanbury%20Brown">R. Hanbury Brown</a> and his co-workers at <a href="Narrabri%20Stellar%20Intensity%20Interferometer">Narrabri Observatory</a> in the 1960s. They found a diameter of 3<a href="milliarcseconds">milliarcseconds</a>. Although Hanbury Brown et al. realized that Altair would be rotationally flattened, they had insufficient data to experimentally observe its oblateness. Altair was later observed to be flattened by <a href="infrared">infrared</a> interferometric measurements made by the <a href="Palomar%20Testbed%20Interferometer">Palomar Testbed Interferometer</a> in 1999 and 2000. This work was published by <a href="Gerard%20van%20Belle">G. T. van Belle</a>, <a href="David%20Ciardi">David R. Ciardi</a> and their co-authors in 2001.

Theory predicts that, owing to Altair's rapid rotation, its <a href="surface%20gravity">surface gravity</a> and <a href="effective%20temperature">effective temperature</a> should be lower at the equator, making the equator less luminous than the poles. This phenomenon, known as <a href="gravity%20darkening">gravity darkening</a> or the <a href="von%20Zeipel%20effect">von Zeipel effect</a>, was confirmed for Altair by measurements made by the <a href="Navy%20Prototype%20Optical%20Interferometer">Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer</a> in 2001, and analyzed by Ohishi et al. (2004) and Peterson et al. (2006). Also, A. Domiciano de Souza et al. (2005) verified gravity darkening using the measurements made by the Palomar and Navy interferometers, together with new measurements made by the VINCI instrument at the <a href="VLTI">VLTI</a>.

Altair is one of the few <a href="List%20of%20directly%20imaged%20stars">stars for which a direct image</a> has been obtained. In 2006 and 2007, J. D. Monnier and his coworkers produced an image of Altair's surface from 2006 infrared observations made with the <a href="Michigan%20Infrared%20Combiner">MIRC</a> instrument on the <a href="CHARA%20array">CHARA array</a> interferometer; this was the first time the surface of any <a href="main-sequence%20star">main-sequence star</a>, apart from the Sun, had been imaged. The false-color image was published in 2007. The equatorial radius of the star was estimated to be 2.03 solar radii, and the polar radius 1.63 solar radii—a 25% increase of the stellar radius from pole to equator. The polar axis is inclined by about 60° to the line of sight from the Earth.

The term "Al Nesr Al Tair" appeared in <a href="Al%20Achsasi%20al%20Mouakket">Al Achsasi al Mouakket</a>'s catalogue, which was translated into <a href="Latin">Latin</a> as "Vultur Volans". This name was applied by the Arabs to the <a href="asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a> of α, <a href="Beta%20Aquilae">β</a>, and <a href="Gamma%20Aquilae">γ Aquilae</a> and probably goes back to the ancient Babylonians and Sumerians, who called α Aquilae the eagle star. The spelling "Atair" has also been used. Medieval <a href="astrolabe">astrolabe</a>s of England and Western Europe depicted Altair and Vega as birds.

The <a href="Koori">Koori</a> people of <a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia">Victoria</a> also knew Altair as "Bunjil", the <a href="wedge-tailed%20eagle">wedge-tailed eagle</a>, and β and γ Aquilae are his two wives the <a href="black%20swan">black swan</a>s. The people of the <a href="Murray%20River">Murray River</a> knew the star as "Totyerguil". The Murray River was formed when "Totyerguil" the hunter speared "Otjout", a giant <a href="Murray%20cod">Murray cod</a>, who, when wounded, churned a channel across southern Australia before entering the sky as the constellation <a href="Delphinus">Delphinus</a>.

In Chinese, the asterism consisting of α, <a href="Beta%20Aquilae">β</a>, and <a href="Gamma%20Aquilae">γ Aquilae</a> is known as "Hé Gǔ" (; lit. "river drum"). Altair is thus known as "Hé Gǔ èr" (; lit. "river drum two", meaning the "second star of the drum at the river"). However, Altair is better known by its other names: "Qiān Niú Xīng" () or "Niú Láng Xīng" (), translated as the "cowherd star". These names are an allusion to a love story, "<a href="The%20Cowherd%20and%20the%20Weaver%20Girl">The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl</a>", in which Niulang (represented by Altair) and his two children (represented by <a href="Beta%20Aquilae">β</a> and <a href="Gamma%20Aquilae">γ Aquilae</a>) are separated from respectively their wife and mother Zhinu (represented by Vega) by the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. They are only permitted to meet once a year, when magpies form a bridge to allow them to cross the Milky Way.

The people of <a href="Micronesia">Micronesia</a> called Altair "Mai-lapa", meaning "big/old breadfruit", while the <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori people</a> called this star "Poutu-te-rangi", meaning "pillar of heaven".

In Western <a href="astrology">astrology</a>, the star Altair was ill-omened, portending danger from <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s.

<a href="Japan%20Airlines">Japan Airlines</a>'s Starjet 777-200 JA8983 was named Altair.

<a href="Altair%20Airlines">Altair Airlines</a> was a regional airline that operated out of Philadelphia from 1966 to 1982.

The NASA Constellation Program announced "Altair" as the name of the <a href="Lunar%20Surface%20Access%20Module">Lunar Surface Access Module</a> (LSAM) on December 13, 2007. The Russian-made <a href="Beriev%20Be-200">Beriev Be-200 Altair</a> seaplane is also named after the star.

The <a href="Altair%208800">Altair 8800</a> was one of the first microcomputers intended for home use.

Altair is the name of three United States navy ships: , and <a href="SS%20Altair%20%28T-AKR-291%29">USNS Altair (T-AKR-291)</a>.

"Altair" is the name of a 1919 poem by <a href="Karle%20Wilson%20Baker">Karle Wilson Baker</a>. 
The bright primary star has the <a href="multiple%20star">multiple star</a> designation <a href="Washington%20Double%20Star%20Catalog">WDS</a> 19508+0852A and has three faint visual companion <a href="star">star</a>s, <a href="Washington%20Double%20Star%20Catalog">WDS</a> 19508+0852B, C, and D.

Australian Broadcasting Corporation

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) is <a href="Australia">Australia</a>'s national <a href="public%20broadcasting">public broadcaster</a>, owned and funded by the government. The ABC plays a leading role in the <a href="history%20of%20broadcasting%20in%20Australia">history of broadcasting in Australia</a>. With a total annual budget of A$1.22 billion, the corporation provides television, radio, online and mobile services throughout metropolitan and regional Australia, as well as overseas through <a href="Australia%20Plus">Australia Plus</a> and <a href="Radio%20Australia">Radio Australia</a>.

Founded in 1929 as the <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Company">Australian Broadcasting Company</a>, it was subsequently made a state-owned corporation on 1 July 1932 as the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The "Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983" changed the name of the organisation to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, effective 1 July 1983. Although funded and owned by the government, the ABC remains <a href="editorial%20independence">editorially independent</a> as ensured through the "Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983".

The ABC is sometimes informally referred to as "Aunty", originally in imitation of the <a href="BBC%23Attitudes%20toward%20the%20BBC%20in%20popular%20culture">British Broadcasting Corporation's nickname</a>.

The first public radio station in Australia opened in Sydney on 23 November 1923 under the call sign 2SB with other stations in Melbourne, <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, <a href="Perth">Perth</a> and <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a> following. A licensing scheme, administered by the <a href="Postmaster-General%27s%20Department">Postmaster-General's Department</a>, was soon established allowing certain stations government funding, albeit with restrictions placed on their advertising content.

Following a 1927 <a href="royal%20commission">royal commission</a> inquiry into radio licensing issues, the government established the National Broadcasting Service which subsequently took over a number of the larger funded stations. It also nationalised the <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Company">Australian Broadcasting Company</a> which had been created by entertainment interests to supply programs to various radio stations. On 1 July 1932, the Australian Broadcasting Commission was established, taking over the operations of the National Broadcasting Service and eventually establishing offices in each of Australia's capital cities.
Over the next four years the stations were reformed into a cohesive broadcasting organisation through regular program relays, coordinated by a centralised bureaucracy. The Australian broadcast radio spectrum was constituted of the ABC and the commercial sector.

News broadcasts were initially restricted, due to pressure from <a href="Keith%20Murdoch">Sir Keith Murdoch</a>, who controlled many Australian newspapers. However, journalists such as Frank Dixon and <a href="John%20Hinde">John Hinde</a> began to subvert the agreements in the late 1930s. in 1939, Warren Denning was appointed to Canberra as the first ABC political correspondent, after Murdoch had refused to allow his newspapers to cover a speech by <a href="Joseph%20Lyons">Joseph Lyons</a>.

In 1942 "The Australian Broadcasting Act" was passed, giving the ABC the power to decide when, and in what circumstances, political speeches should be broadcast. Directions from the Minister about whether or not to broadcast any matter now had to be made in writing, and any exercise of the power had to be mentioned in the Commission's Annual Report. It was used only once, in 1963. In the same year, "Kindergarten of the Air" began on ABC Radio in Perth, and was later broadcast nationally.

Cater argues that reform was urgently needed in 1945:

The ABC commenced television broadcasting in 1956, and followed the earlier radio practice of naming the station after the first letter of the base state. <a href="ABN-2">ABN-2</a> (New South Wales) Sydney was inaugurated by Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> on 5 November 1956, with the first broadcast presented by <a href="Michael%20Charlton">Michael Charlton</a>, and <a href="James%20Dibble">James Dibble</a> reading the first television news bulletin. <a href="ABV-2">ABV-2</a> (Melbourne, Victoria) followed two weeks later, on 18 November 1956. Stations in other capital cities followed: <a href="ABQ-2">ABQ-2</a> (Brisbane, Queensland) (1959), <a href="ABS-2">ABS-2</a> (Adelaide, South Australia) (1960), <a href="ABW-2">ABW-2</a> (Perth, Western Australia) (1960), and <a href="ABT-2">ABT-2</a> (Hobart, Tasmania) (1960). <a href="ABC-9">ABC-3</a> Canberra opened in 1961, and <a href="ABD-6">ABD-6</a> (Darwin, Northern Territories) started broadcasting in 1971, both named after the base city.

Although radio programs could be distributed nationally by <a href="landline">landline</a>, television relay facilities were not in place until the early 1960s. This meant that news bulletins had to be sent to each capital city by <a href="teleprinter">teleprinter</a>, to be prepared and presented separately in each city, with filmed materials copied manually and sent to each state. Other television programs at the time included the popular "<a href="Six%20O%27Clock%20Rock">Six O'Clock Rock</a>" hosted by <a href="Johnny%20O%27Keefe">Johnny O'Keefe</a>, "<a href="Mr.%20Squiggle">Mr. Squiggle</a>", as well as operas and plays.

In 1973 <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Rugby%20League">New South Wales Rugby League</a> boss <a href="Kevin%20Humphreys%20%28rugby%20league%29">Kevin Humphreys</a> negotiated rugby league's first television deal with the ABC.
In 1975, colour television was introduced into Australia, and within a decade the ABC had moved into satellite broadcasting, greatly enhancing its ability to distribute content nationally. In the same year, the ABC introduced a 24-hour-a-day AM rock station in Sydney, 2JJ (<a href="Double%20Jay%20%28radio%20network%29">Double Jay</a>), which was eventually expanded into the national <a href="Triple%20J">Triple J</a> FM network. A year later, a national classical music network was established on the <a href="frequency%20modulation">FM</a> band, broadcasting from Adelaide. It was initially known as ABC-FM (now called <a href="ABC%20Classic%20FM">ABC Classic FM</a>) – referring both to its 'fine music' programming and radio frequency.

ABC budget cuts began in 1976 and continued until 1985. In 1978 the ABC NSW Staff Association organised a strike against budget cuts and political interference. Sydney ABC was off air for four days. A packed free concert in support was held at the <a href="Regent%20Theatre%20%28Sydney%29">Regent Theatre</a> and compered by <a href="Bob%20Hudson%20%28singer%29">Bob Hudson</a>. It featured <a href="Fred%20Dagg">Fred Dagg</a> and <a href="Robyn%20Archer">Robyn Archer</a>. In 1991, Tom Molomby wrote:

The "Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983" changed the name of the organisation from the "Australian Broadcasting Commission" to the "Australian Broadcasting Corporation", effective 1 July 1983. At the same time, the newly formed Corporation underwent significant restructuring. The ABC was split into separate television and radio divisions, with an overhaul of management, finance, property and engineering. <a href="Geoffrey%20Whitehead%20%28communications%29">Geoffrey Whitehead</a> was the initial managing director; however, following his resignation in 1986, <a href="David%20Hill%20%28businessman%29">David Hill</a> (at the time chair of the ABC Board) took over his position.

Program production in <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">indigenous</a> affairs, comedy, social history and current affairs was significantly expanded, while the Corporation's output of drama was boosted. Local production trebled from 1986–91 with the assistance of co-production, co-financing, and pre-sales arrangements.

A new Concert Music Department was formed in 1985 to co-ordinate the corporation's six symphony orchestras, which in turn received a greater level of autonomy to better respond to local needs. Open-air free concerts and tours, educational activities, and joint ventures with other music groups were undertaken at the time to expand the orchestras' audience reach.

ABC Radio was restructured significantly again in 1985 – Radio One became the Metropolitan network, while Radio 2 became known as <a href="Radio%20National">Radio National</a> (callsigns, however, were not standardised until 1990). New programs such as "The World Today", "Australia All Over", and "The Coodabeen Champions" were introduced, while <a href="ABC%20Classic%20FM">ABC-FM</a> established an Australian Music Unit in 1989. <a href="Radio%20Australia">Radio Australia</a> began to focus on the Asia-Pacific region, with coverage targeted at the south west and central Pacific, south-east Asia, and north Asia. Radio Australia also carried more news coverage, with special broadcasts during the <a href="1987%20Fijian%20coups%20d%27%C3%A9tat">1987 Fijian coup</a>, <a href="Tiananmen%20Square%20massacre">Tiananmen Square massacre</a>, and the <a href="First%20Gulf%20War">First Gulf War</a>.
In 1991, the Corporation's Sydney radio and orchestral operations moved to a new building built by <a href="Leighton%20Holdings">Leighton Holdings</a> on a single site in the inner-city suburb of <a href="Ultimo%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Ultimo</a>. In Melbourne, the ABC Southbank Centre was completed in 1994, and now houses the radio division in Victoria as well as the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.

The ABC Multimedia Unit was established in July 1995, to manage the new ABC website (launched in August). Funding was allocated later that year specifically for online content, as opposed to reliance on funding for television and radio content. The first online election coverage was put together in 1996, and included news, electorate maps, candidate information and live results.

By the early 1990s, all major ABC broadcasting outlets moved to 24-hour-a-day operation, while regional radio coverage in Australia was extended with 80 new transmitters. Live television broadcasts of selected parliamentary sessions started in 1990. <a href="ABC%20NewsRadio">ABC NewsRadio</a>, a continuous news network broadcast on the <a href="Parliamentary%20and%20News%20Network">Parliamentary and News Network</a> when parliament is not sitting, was launched on 5 October 1994.

International television service <a href="Australia%20Television%20International">Australia Television International</a> was established in 1993, while at the same time Radio Australia increased its international reach. Reduced funding in 1997 for Radio Australia resulted in staff and programming cuts.

"Australia Television" was sold to the <a href="Seven%20Network">Seven Network</a> in 1998, however the service continued to show <a href="ABC%20News%20and%20Current%20Affairs">ABC news and current affairs programming</a> up until its closure in 2001. The ABC's television operation joined its radio and online divisions at the corporation's Ultimo headquarters in 2000.

In 2001, digital television commenced after four years of preparation. In readiness, the ABC had fully digitised its production, post-production and transmission facilities – heralded at the time as "the greatest advance in television technology since the introduction of colour". The first programmes to be produced in widescreen were drama series "<a href="Something%20in%20the%20Air%20%28TV%20series%29">Something in the Air</a>", "<a href="Grass%20Roots%20%28TV%20series%29">Grass Roots</a>" and "In the Mind of the Architect".

At the same time, the ABC's Multimedia division was renamed "ABC New Media", becoming an output division of the ABC alongside Television and Radio. Legislation allowed the ABC to provide 'multichannels' – additional, digital-only, television services managed by the New Media Division. Soon after the introduction of digital television in 2001, <a href="Fly%20TV">Fly TV</a> and the <a href="ABC%20Kids%20channel">ABC Kids channel</a> launched, showing a mix of programming aimed at teenagers and children.

In 2002, the ABC launched <a href="Australia%20Network">ABC Asia Pacific</a> – the replacement for the defunct Australia Television International operated previously by the Seven Network. Much like its predecessor, and companion radio network <a href="Radio%20Australia">Radio Australia</a>, the service provided a mix of programming targeted at audiences throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Funding cuts in 2003 led to the closure of Fly TV and the ABC Kids channel.

The ABC launched a digital radio service, <a href="ABC%20DiG">ABC DiG</a>, in November 2002, available though the internet and digital television, but not available through any other terrestrial broadcast until <a href="DAB%2B">DAB+</a> became available in 2009.
<a href="ABC2">ABC2</a>, a second attempt at a digital-only television channel, launched on 7 March 2005. Unlike its predecessors the new service was not dependent on government funding, instead running on a budget of A$3 million per year. Minister for Communications <a href="Helen%20Coonan">Helen Coonan</a> inaugurated the channel at <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">Parliament House</a> three days later. Genre restrictions limiting the types of programming the channel could carry were lifted in October 2006 – ABC2 was henceforth able to carry programming classified as comedy, drama, national news, sport and entertainment.

A high incidence of breast cancer in female staff working at the ABC's offices in Brisbane led to the closure of the site, based in <a href="Toowong%2C%20Queensland">Toowong</a>, on 21 December 2006. Sixteen women were diagnosed with the disease in a period spanning 1994 to 2007. A progress report released in March 2007 by an independent panel formed to investigate the occurrences found that the rate of occurrence for breast cancer rate at the offices was eleven times higher than elsewhere – after the closure of the site, the ABC's Brisbane-based television and radio operations were moved to alternate locations around the city, including <a href="TVQ-10">Ten Brisbane</a>'s studios at <a href="Mt%20Coot-tha">Mt Coot-tha</a>. The ABC's managing director, <a href="Mark%20Scott%20%28businessman%29">Mark Scott</a>, announced in August 2007 that new studios would be built on the site, following the final release of the Review and Scientific Investigation Panel's report. In January 2012 the ABC in Brisbane moved into purpose-built accommodation in <a href="South%20Bank%2C%20Queensland">South Bank</a>.

On 8 February 2008, ABC TV was rebranded as <a href="ABC%20%28Australian%20TV%20channel%29">ABC1</a>, complementing the existing <a href="ABC2">ABC2</a> digital-only channel which was launched on 7 March 2005. Branding was also added for a new kids' channel that had been announced throughout the Howard Government based on their winning the 2007 election but left to the 2009 Rudd Government Budget where <a href="ABC3">ABC3</a> was funded and announced in June. A new online video-on-demand service launched in July of the same year, titled <a href="ABC%20iview">ABC iview</a>, and the ABC launched <a href="digital%20radio%20in%20Australia">digital radio</a> broadcasts in the same month.

<a href="ABC%20News%2024">ABC News 24</a> launched on 22 July 2010, and brought with it both new programming content as well as a collaboration of existing news and current affair productions and resources. The ABC launched the 24-hour news channel to both complement its existing 24-hour <a href="ABC%20NewsRadio">ABC News Radio</a> service and compete with commercial offerings on cable TV. It became the ABC's fifth domestic TV channel and the fourth launched within the past 10 years.

On 20 July 2014, <a href="ABC%20%28Australian%20TV%20channel%29">ABC1</a> was renamed back to its original name of ABC.

In 2014 the ABC ran its first "Mental As" week focusing on improving awareness of mental health issues, as part of <a href="Mental%20Health%20Week%20%28Australia%29">Mental Health Week</a>.

In December 2015 it was announced that former Google executive <a href="Michelle%20Guthrie">Michelle Guthrie</a> would take over from managing director Mark Scott, who was to retire in April 2016.

Below is a diagram of the ABC's divisional structure.

The operations of the ABC are governed by a board of directors, consisting of a managing director, five to seven directors, and until 2006, a staff-elected director. The managing director is appointed by the board for a period of up to five years, but is eligible for renewal. The authority and guidelines for the appointment of directors is provided for in the "Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983".

Appointments to the <a href="ABC%20Board">ABC Board</a> made by successive governments have often resulted in criticism of the appointees' political affiliation, background, and relative merit. Past appointments have associated directly with political parties – five of fourteen appointed chairmen have been accused of political affiliation or friendship, include Richard Downing and <a href="Ken%20Myer">Ken Myer</a> (both of whom publicly endorsed the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a> at the 1972 election), as well as Sir Henry Bland. <a href="David%20Hill%20%28businessman%29">David Hill</a> was close to <a href="Neville%20Wran">Neville Wran</a>, while <a href="Donald%20McDonald%20%28ABC%20chairperson%29">Donald McDonald</a> was considered to be a close friend of <a href="John%20Howard">John Howard</a>.

From 2003 the <a href="Howard%20Government">Howard Government</a> made several controversial appointments to the ABC Board, including prominent ABC critic <a href="Janet%20Albrechtsen">Janet Albrechtsen</a>, <a href="Ron%20Brunton">Ron Brunton</a>, and <a href="Keith%20Windschuttle">Keith Windschuttle</a>.

During their <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202007">2007 federal election campaign</a>, Labor announced plans to introduce a new system, similar to that of the BBC, for appointing members to the board. Under the new system, candidates for the ABC Board would be considered by an independent panel established "at arm's length" from the Communications Minister. If the Minister chose someone not on the panel's shortlist, they would be required to justify this to parliament. The ABC chairman would be nominated by the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> and endorsed by the <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28Australia%29">Leader of the Opposition</a>.

The new merit-based appointment system was announced on 16 October, in advance of the new triennial funding period starting in 2009.

Current Board members are:
The ABC is funded mainly by the Australian government, in addition to some revenue received from <a href="ABC%20Commercial">its retail outlets</a>. In the 2006–07 <a href="Australian%20federal%20budget">federal budget</a>, the ABC received <a href="Australian%20dollar">A$</a>823 million of government funding, increased to $840 million in 2008–09. In the 2009–10 federal budget, the ABC received funding of $929.9 million.

Until 1948, the ABC was funded directly by radio licence fees; amendments were also made to the "Australian Broadcasting Act" that meant the ABC would receive its funding directly from the federal government. Licence fees remained until 1973 when they were abolished by the <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Whitlam</a> Labor government, on the basis that the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for government-owned radio and television broadcasters.

The term "where your 8 cents a day goes", coined in the late 1980s during funding negotiations, is often used in reference to the services provided by the ABC. It is estimated that the cost of the ABC per head of population per day was 7.1 cents a day, based on the Corporation's 2007–08 'base funding' of $543 million. Budget figures above show the ABC costs over 14 cents per day today.

The Australian Communications Minister, Senator <a href="Stephen%20Conroy">Stephen Conroy</a> indicated strong support from the Government for the ABC's funding submission for the 2009/10 budget, saying the organisation had been underfunded for many years.

Under the "Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983", the <a href="ABC%20Board">ABC Board</a> is bound to "maintain the independence and integrity of the Corporation" and to ensure that "the gathering and presentation by the Corporation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognized standards of objective journalism."

In relation to impartiality and diversity of perspectives, the current ABC editorial policy requires of the broadcaster that:

As a publicly funded broadcaster, the ABC is expected not to take editorial stances on political issues, and is required to present a range of views with impartiality. Over the decades, accusations of "bias" at the ABC have arisen at different times, and various inquiries undertaken.

Reviews of the ABC are regularly commissioned and sometimes not released. A 2004 <a href="Roy%20Morgan%20Research">Roy Morgan</a> media credibility survey found that media professionals regarded <a href="ABC%20Radio%20and%20Regional%20Content">ABC Radio</a> as the most accurate news source in the country. In mid 2013 the <a href="University%20of%20the%20Sunshine%20Coast">University of the Sunshine Coast</a> released a study of the professional views of journalists. Slightly over half of respondents expected to vote for either <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor</a> or <a href="Australian%20Greens">The Greens</a> whereas just under a third planned to vote <a href="Coalition%20%28Australia%29">Coalition</a>. In contrast over 40% of ABC journalists would vote for The Greens and almost a third Labor. 
Dr Rhonda Jolly's 2014 ABC Overview noted that "many commentators have argued consistently that there is a left wing bias which dominates ABC news and programming" and cited a 2005 piece by Paul Gray that the broadcaster was overly influenced by the "narrow middle-class values of the Australian secular Left" and said that "while the national broadcaster had at times offended governments of all persuasions, it had always adopted a 'from the Left' perspective." Jolly also noted however that supporters of the ABC "deny claims that the broadcaster is either intentionally or inadvertently biased" and that "Speaking from opposition, politicians have praised the ABC for its scrutiny of government." The paper noted that, in December 2013, ABC chairman James Spigelman called four independent audits a year in response to the frequent allegations of lack of impartiality in news and current affairs. In response to one set of criticisms, journalist <a href="Annabel%20Crabb">Annabel Crabb</a>, who has worked at the ABC, commented: "every single day I see that organisation give voices to Australians who otherwise wouldn't be heard, on topics that are too uncommercial or too remote or too hard to be covered by anyone else, broadcasting into areas from which others have long withdrawn resources."

The conservative <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal Party</a> governments in the 1960s and 1970s attempted to influence the ABC's political coverage by threatening to reduce funding for its news and current affairs division.

<a href="Bob%20Hawke">Bob Hawke</a> criticised some of the <a href="7.30%20Report">7.30 Report</a>'s coverage of the 1991 Gulf War to which he committed naval forces as being "loaded", "biased" and "disgraceful".

For much of the <a href="Howard%20Government">Howard Government</a> years, ABC TV's masthead political programs were anchored by Labor affiliated journalists Kerry O'Brien, <a href="Barrie%20Cassidy">Barrie Cassidy</a> and <a href="Maxine%20McKew">Maxine McKew</a>. "<a href="7.30%20Report">7.30 Report</a>" and "<a href="Insiders%20%28TV%20program%29">Insiders</a>" were hosted by former Labor staffers Kerry O'Brien and Barrie Cassidy respectively, while the 2007 election saw "Lateline" host McKew defeat Liberal Prime Minister <a href="John%20Howard">John Howard</a> as the Labor candidate for the seat of Bennelong. At that same election, Liberal front bencher <a href="Joe%20Hockey">Joe Hockey</a> was challenged unsuccessfully by ABC Sydney News weatherman turned Labor candidate <a href="Mike%20Bailey%20%28weatherman%29">Mike Bailey</a> in the Seat of North Sydney.

Of the 1996 prime ministerial Election debates between Opposition Leader <a href="John%20Howard">John Howard</a> and Labor Prime Minister <a href="Paul%20Keating">Paul Keating</a>, Howard later wrote: "I flatly refused to have Kerry O'Brien of the ABC [moderate the debates] because of the way he had handled the second Keating-<a href="John%20Hewson">Hewson</a> debate in 1993" in which O'Brien "went in to bat" for Keating. Howard went on to win that election. A decade later, the ABC Media Watch program reported that NSW Liberal Senator <a href="Concetta%20Fierravanti-Wells">Concetta Fierravanti-Wells</a> had written to her constituents to say that the ABC had "a collective loathing" of <a href="John%20Howard">John Howard</a>. At the end of the <a href="Howard%20Government">Howard Government</a>'s term in 2007, left-wing political commentator <a href="Robert%20Manne">Robert Manne</a> wrote in "The Monthly" that the Howard Government had viewed the broadcaster as being run by "left-wing ideologues" who had "supposedly pushed the agenda of the Left on issues like refugees, the republic, multiculturalism, reconciliation, radical feminism, extreme environmentalism, anti-Americanism, gay rights and so on."

Soon after coming to office in 1996, the Howard Government reduced the ABC's operating grants by 10%. Its appointment of <a href="Jonathan%20Shier">Jonathan Shier</a> to the position of managing director was controversial, for his program of budget cuts, restructuring and the loss of several high-profile personalities and shows. Shier left the position early, on 31 October 2001. "<a href="7.30%20Report">7.30 Report</a>" anchor Kerry O'Brien opposed Howard's budget cuts to the ABC, and describes the appointment of Shier as its Managing Director as a manifestation of the "conservative obsession with the ABC as a kind of biased, left-wing culture".

In Howard's last election, he was defeated in the Seat of Bennelong by Labor candidate Maxine McKew, who had hosted "Lateline" during the Howard era. Peter Mares reported for Radio National that "some wags described it as an 'internal promotion', while others said she'd simply moved from the 'media wing' to the 'political wing' of the ALP". Mares consulted ABC journalist turned NSW Liberal MLA <a href="Pru%20Goward">Pru Goward</a> who said: " I have no doubt there was left-wing bias, I certainly thought it when I was there", while McKew said there was no left wing bias, though "what I detected years ago in the ABC, much more of a collectivist philosophy".

ABC TV's masthead political programs continued to have strong Labor Party connections through the period. In October 2010, the ABC announced that former Labor staffer Kerry O'Brien would host "<a href="Four%20Corners%20%28Australian%20TV%20program%29">Four Corners</a>", beginning in 2011. Former Labor staffer <a href="Barrie%20Cassidy">Barrie Cassidy</a> continued to host the "Insiders" program. In December 2010, <a href="Chris%20Uhlmann">Chris Uhlmann</a>, husband of Labor MP <a href="Gai%20Brodtmann">Gai Brodtmann</a>, was appointed as co-host of the "<a href="7.30">7.30</a>" current affairs program. In 2012, Sydney ABC News anchor <a href="Juanita%20Phillips">Juanita Phillips</a> began a relationship with Labor's Minister for Climate Change, <a href="Greg%20Combet">Greg Combet</a>.

Conservative commentators such as <a href="Andrew%20Bolt">Andrew Bolt</a>, <a href="Tim%20Blair">Tim Blair</a> and <a href="Gerard%20Henderson">Gerard Henderson</a> accused the ABC of a left-wing bias.

Liberal Prime Minister <a href="Tony%20Abbott">Tony Abbott</a> perceived the ABC to be left wing and hostile to <a href="Abbott%20Government">his government</a>, while his successor <a href="Malcolm%20Turnbull">Malcolm Turnbull</a> enjoyed better relations with the National Broadcaster. When the ABC co-operated with "The Guardian" to publish <a href="Edward%20Snowden">stolen documents</a> purporting to reveal monitoring of Indonesian officials by Australian spy agencies under the <a href="Rudd%20Government%20%282013%29">Rudd Government</a>, Abbott told 2GB radio: "A lot of people feel at the moment that the ABC instinctively takes everyone's side but Australia's". Abbott reportedly called the "Q&A" program a "Lefty Lynch Mob". When it invited a man convicted of threatening Commonwealth officials to participate in questioning one of his ministers amid a heightened terrorism alert in June 2015, Abbott asked the makers of the program: "whose side are you on?". The ABC found that there had been an "error of judgement', but repeated the program later in the week, prompting Abbott to say that "heads should roll" over the affair. Abbott initiated a brief ministerial boycott of the "Q&A" program following the affair.

The broadcaster was critical of Abbott when he broke an election-eve promise not to make cuts to the ABC, and required 4.6% cuts over five years as part of his "Budget repair" program. In early 2015, an internal ABC review of its coverage of <a href="Joe%20Hockey">Joe Hockey</a>'s first Budget criticised the post-budget interviews by "7:30" and "Lateline", finding that the interviewers had given the impression of bias.

When Abbott lost the leadership to Turnbull in the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia%20leadership%20spill%2C%20September%202015">September 2015 Liberal leadership spill</a>, the hosts of the ABC's political programs spoke in favour of Abbott's demise. <a href="Kerry%20O%27Brien%20%28journalist%29">Kerry O'Brien</a> and <a href="Barrie%20Cassidy">Barrie Cassidy</a>, hosts respectively of the ABC's flagship weekly current affairs programs "Four Corners" and "Insiders", welcomed the replacement of Abbott by Turnbull, as did ABC radio commentators <a href="Fran%20Kelly">Fran Kelly</a> <a href="Paul%20Bongiorno">Paul Bongiorno</a> and <a href="Amanda%20Vanstone">Amanda Vanstone</a>. Fairfax and News Limited reported that <a href="Leigh%20Sales">Leigh Sales</a>, the host of "7.30" gave Turnbull an unusually warm first interview following his toppling of Abbott.

In a March 2016 interview with ABC Managing Director Mark Scott, "Media Watch" host Paul Barry examined the question of perceptions of left wing bias at the ABC. Scott noted that while perhaps the ABC was more concerned about gay marriage than about electricity prices, he did not accept the criticism of bias because "a lot of that criticism comes from right wing commentators and they wonder where are the strong right wing commentators on the ABC. We don’t do that kind of journalism. We don’t ask questions about our journalists’ voting pattern and where their ideology are. We look at the journalism that they put to air and we have strong editorial standards..." Following the interview, conservative ABC critic Andrew Bolt wrote "How can the man heading our biggest media organisation be so blind to the ABC's unlawful and dangerous Leftist bias?" while former "Media Watch" host Jonathan Holmes wrote for "The Age" that this interview indicated that ABC management had failed to recognise a clear problem of left wing bias among some capital city radio presenters.

Over the period, ABC TV and radio hosts advocated strongly in support of same-sex marriage, upon which the wider Australian community and political parties were divided. When the Turnbull Government announced plans for a postal plebiscite on the issue, advocacy for change continued, prompting a call for restraint from the ABC's editorial policy manager Mark Maley.

An interview by ABC presenter Joe O'Brien with Lyle Shelton was the subject of a complaint by the Australian Christian Lobby. Bringing up <a href="Ian%20Thorpe">Ian Thorpe</a>'s swimming achievements, O'Brien asked Shelton "what right do you have to participate in that joy, and take national pride in those achievements, if you now deny him the right to feel like an equal and experience the joy of marriage?" In rejecting any perceived bias, the ABC said "It was a 'devil's advocate' question and not inconsistent with standards".

A number of former journalists and presenters have moved from positions at the ABC to politics.

State Labor premiers and chief ministers <a href="Bob%20Carr">Bob Carr</a>,
<a href="Alan%20Carpenter">Alan Carpenter</a>,
and <a href="Clare%20Martin">Clare Martin</a> are all former ABC journalists.

Senior ABC political reporter <a href="Kerry%20O%27Brien%20%28journalist%29">Kerry O'Brien</a> was press secretary to Labor prime minister <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a> and Labor deputy leader <a href="Lionel%20Bowen">Lionel Bowen</a> and <a href="Barrie%20Cassidy">Barrie Cassidy</a> was press secretary to Labor prime minister <a href="Bob%20Hawke">Bob Hawke</a>. <a href="Susan%20Templeman">Susan Templeman</a>'s husband, Ron Fuller, is the former Chief of Staff for ABC TV News. Radio National's <a href="Phillip%20Adams">Phillip Adams</a> is a former member of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Australia">Communist Party of Australia</a> and the Labor Party, and Melbourne ABC radio's <a href="Jon%20Faine">Jon Faine</a> is a former member of the Labor Party.

On the Coalition side of politics, <a href="Pru%20Goward">Pru Goward</a> has served as a Minister in the NSW state Liberal Government, <a href="Rob%20Messenger">Rob Messenger</a>, <a href="Peter%20Collins%20%28New%20South%20Wales%20politician%29">Peter Collins</a>, <a href="Eoin%20Cameron">Eoin Cameron</a>, <a href="Scott%20Emerson">Scott Emerson</a> and <a href="Sarah%20Henderson">Sarah Henderson</a> all held, or hold, positions at the ABC. Radio National's "Counterpoint" program is hosted by former Liberal minister <a href="Amanda%20Vanstone">Amanda Vanstone</a>, who describes herself as "liberal" rather than "conservative".

Research undertaken by the broadcaster in 2007 indicated that out of a total of 19 former employees moving into party political positions, 10 have joined the Labor Party and nine the Liberal Party.

The ABC operates 54 local radio stations, in addition to four national networks and international service <a href="Radio%20Australia">Radio Australia</a>. In addition, <a href="ABC%20DiG">DiG Radio</a> launched on digital platforms in 2002, currently offering three separate stations.

<a href="ABC%20NewsRadio">ABC NewsRadio</a> is a rolling news service, previously known as the <a href="Parliamentary%20and%20News%20Network">Parliamentary and News Network</a>. The service was established to broadcast federal parliamentary sittings, to relieve the local ABC radio network from this intermittent task, and to provide a news service at other times. The network broadcasts news on a 24/7 format with updates on the quarter-hour. Much of its news content is produced by the ABC itself, however many programmes are relayed from the <a href="BBC%20World%20Service">BBC World Service</a>, <a href="National%20Public%20Radio">NPR</a>, <a href="Deutsche%20Welle">Deutsche Welle</a>, <a href="Radio%20Netherlands">Radio Netherlands</a> and <a href="CNN%20Radio">CNN Radio</a>.

<a href="ABC%20Classic%20FM">ABC Classic FM</a> was the ABC's first FM radio service. It was originally known simply as "ABC FM", and for a short time "ABC Fine Music". Its format borrowed heavily from community stations that eventually founded the Fine Music Network, as well as <a href="BBC%20Radio%203">BBC Radio 3</a>.

<a href="Triple%20J">Triple J</a> is the national youth radio network, and broadcasts contemporary alternative and independent music; it is targeted at people aged 18–35.

An experimental Multimedia Unit was established in 1995, charged with developing policy for the ABC's work in web publishing. This unit continued until 2000, when the New Media division was formed, bringing together the ABC's online output as a division similar to Television or Radio. The division had over a million pages of material published by late 2003.

In 2001 the New Media division became New Media and Digital Services, reflecting the broader remit to develop content for digital platforms such as <a href="digital%20television">digital television</a>. In addition to ABC Online, the division also had responsibility over the ABC's two digital television services, <a href="Fly%20TV">Fly TV</a> and the <a href="ABC%20Kids%20channel">ABC Kids channel</a>, until their closure in 2003. In March 2005 the division oversaw the launch of ABC2, a <a href="free-to-air">free-to-air</a> digital television channel, in effect a replacement for ABC Kids and Fly.

In conjunction with the ABC's radio division, New Media and Digital Services implemented the ABC's first <a href="podcast">podcast</a>s in December 2004. By mid-2006 the ABC had become an international leader in podcasting with over fifty podcast programmes delivering hundreds of thousands of downloads per week, including trial video podcasts of <a href="The%20Chaser%27s%20War%20on%20Everything">The Chaser's War on Everything</a> and <a href="Triple%20j%20tv">jtv</a>.

In February 2007, the New Media & Digital Services division was dissolved and divided up amongst other areas of the ABC. It was replaced by a new Innovation division, to manage ABC Online and investigate new technologies for the ABC.
In 2015 the Innovation division was replaced with the Digital Network division.

<a href="Australia%20Network">Australia Network</a>, formerly ABC Asia Pacific, is an international satellite television service operated by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, funded by advertising and grants from the <a href="Department%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20and%20Trade%20%28Australia%29">Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</a>. Aimed at the Asia-Pacific region, the service broadcasts a mixture of English language programming, including general entertainment, sport, and current affairs.

<a href="ABC%20Radio%20Australia">ABC Radio Australia</a> is an international shortwave, satellite and internet radio service with transmissions aimed at East Asia and the <a href="Pacific%20Islands">Pacific Islands</a>, although its signals are also audible in many other parts of the world. It features programmes in various languages spoken in these regions, including <a href="Putonghua">Mandarin</a>, <a href="Indonesian%20language">Indonesian</a>, <a href="Vietnamese%20language">Vietnamese</a>, <a href="Khmer%20language">Khmer</a> and <a href="Tok%20Pisin">Tok Pisin</a>.

Radio Australia bulletins are also carried on <a href="WRN%20Broadcast">WRN Broadcast</a>, available via satellite in Europe and North America.

ABC Commercial is the division of the ABC responsible for pursuing new sources of revenue for the Corporation. It is composed of ABC Retail, ABC Consumer Publishing and Content Sales, as well as ABC Resource Hire. ABC retail outlets were established in 1974. All profits from the sale of consumer product and production services return to the Corporation to reinvest in programme-making.

Up until the installation of disc recording equipment in 1935, all content broadcast on the ABC was produced live, including music. For this purpose, the ABC established broadcasting orchestras in each state, and in some centres also employed choruses and dance bands. This became known as the ABC Concert Music Division, which was controlled by the Federal Director of Music – the first of whom was <a href="William%20G.%20James">W. G. James</a>.

There are currently six state symphony orchestras:

The orchestras were corporatised in the 1990s, and were divested into independent companies on 1 January 2007.

The ABC logo is one of the most recognisable logos in Australia. In the early years of television, the ABC had been using <a href="Lissajous%20curve">Lissajous curve</a>s as fillers between programmes. In July 1963, the ABC conducted a staff competition to create a new logo for use on television, stationery, publications, microphone badges and ABC vehicles. In 1965, ABC graphics designer Bill Kennard, who had been experimenting with telerecording of the <a href="cathode%20ray%20oscilloscope">cathode ray oscilloscope</a> displays, submitted a design which was part of the waveform from an oscilloscope. The letters "ABC" were added to the design and it was adopted as the ABC's official logo. Kennard was presented with <a href="Australian%20pound">£</a>25 for his design.

Since its original introduction in 1965, it has been updated several times, including with the introduction of colour television in 1975. The line was thickened to feature colour in the logo. The 1975 logo is the longest-running logo, with a lifespan of 27 years. In 2001, with the introduction of digital television in Australia, ABC Television adopted a modified version of the logo, featuring a silver 3D look and losing the "over and under" design. However, despite the launch of this logo, the 1975 logo is still used by the corporation. In July 2002, to celebrate the ABC's 70th anniversary, the corporation adopted a new logo across all media. This new logo still used the silver 3D colour but reverted to its "over and under" design. In 2014, as part of ABC1's renaming back into "ABC TV", the 1975 logo was brought back to on-air presentation. Despite this, the 2002 silver logo remains in usage by the corporation.

Alexandria

Alexandria ( or ; <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a>: '; '; "") is the <a href="list%20of%20cities%20in%20Egypt">second largest city</a> and a major economic centre in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, extending about along the coast of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> in the <a href="north%20coast%20of%20Egypt">north central part</a> of the country. Its low elevation on the <a href="Nile%20delta">Nile delta</a> makes it highly vulnerable to rising sea levels. Alexandria is an important industrial center because of its <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> and <a href="Pipeline%20transport">oil pipeline</a>s from <a href="Suez">Suez</a>. Alexandria is also an important tourist destination.

Alexandria was founded around a small, <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>ian town "c." 331 BC by <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>. It became an important center of the <a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenistic civilization</a> and remained the capital of <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Hellenistic</a> and <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Roman and Byzantine Egypt</a> for almost 1000 years until the <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Egypt">Muslim conquest of Egypt</a> in AD 641, when a new capital was founded at <a href="Fustat">Fustat</a> (later absorbed into <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>). Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the <a href="Lighthouse%20of%20Alexandria">Lighthouse of Alexandria</a> ("Pharos"), one of the <a href="Seven%20Wonders%20of%20the%20Ancient%20World">Seven Wonders of the Ancient World</a>; its <a href="Great%20Library">Great Library</a> (the largest in the ancient world; now replaced by a <a href="Bibliotheca%20Alexandrina">modern one</a>); and the <a href="Catacombs%20of%20Kom%20El%20Shoqafa">Necropolis</a>, one of the <a href="Wonders%20of%20the%20Middle%20Ages">Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages</a>. Alexandria was the second most powerful city of the ancient world after <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. Ongoing <a href="maritime%20archaeology">maritime archaeology</a> in the harbor of Alexandria, which began in 1994, is revealing details of Alexandria both before the arrival of Alexander, when a city named <a href="Rhacotis">Rhacotis</a> existed there, and during the <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic dynasty</a>.

From the late 18th century, Alexandria became a major center of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centers in the world, both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a>, and the lucrative trade in <a href="Egyptian%20cotton">Egyptian cotton</a>.

Alexandria is believed to have been founded by <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> in April 331 BC as ("Alexandria"). Alexander's chief architect for the project was <a href="Dinocrates">Dinocrates</a>. Alexandria was intended to supersede <a href="Naucratis">Naucratis</a> as a <a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenistic</a> center in Egypt, and to be the link between Greece and the rich <a href="Nile">Nile</a> valley. However, more recent <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dating</a> of seashell fragments and lead contamination predate this claim by two millennia 

Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient world for some time. The city and its museum attracted many of the greatest scholars, including Greeks, Jews and Syrians. The city was later plundered and lost its significance.

Just east of Alexandria (where <a href="Abu%20Qir%20Bay">Abu Qir Bay</a> is now), there was in ancient times marshland and several islands. As early as the 7th century BC, there existed important port cities of <a href="Canopus%2C%20Egypt">Canopus</a> and <a href="Heracleion">Heracleion</a>. The latter was recently rediscovered under water.

An Egyptian city, <a href="Rhacotis">Rhakotis</a>, already existed on the shore also, and later gave its name to Alexandria in the <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian language</a> (Egyptian *Raˁ-Ḳāṭit, written "rˁ-ḳṭy.t", 'That which is built up'). It continued to exist as the Egyptian quarter of the city. A few months after the foundation, Alexander left Egypt and never returned to his city. After Alexander's departure, his <a href="viceroy">viceroy</a>, <a href="Cleomenes%20of%20Naucratis">Cleomenes</a>, continued the expansion. Following a struggle with the other successors of Alexander, his general <a href="Ptolemy%20I%20Soter">Ptolemy Lagides</a> succeeded in bringing Alexander's body to Alexandria, though it was eventually lost after being separated from its burial site there.

Although Cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing Alexandria's continuous development, the "<a href="Heptastadion">Heptastadion</a>" and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyre</a> and becoming the center of the new commerce between Europe and the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian</a> and Indian East, the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a>. In a century, Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and, for some centuries more, was second only to Rome. It became Egypt's main Greek city, with <a href="Greeks">Greek people</a> from diverse backgrounds.

Alexandria was not only a center of <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenism</a>, but was also home to the largest urban Jewish community in the world. The <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, a Greek version of the <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>, was produced there. The early Ptolemies kept it in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Hellenistic center of learning (<a href="Library%20of%20Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>), but were careful to maintain the distinction of its population's three largest ethnicities: Greek, Jewish, and <a href="Egyptians">Egyptian</a>.

In AD 115, large parts of Alexandria were destroyed during the <a href="Kitos%20War">Kitos War</a>, which gave <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a> and his architect, <a href="Decriannus">Decriannus</a>, an opportunity to rebuild it. In 215, the <a href="Roman%20Emperor">emperor</a> <a href="Caracalla">Caracalla</a> visited the city and, because of some insulting <a href="satire">satire</a>s that the inhabitants had directed at him, abruptly commanded his troops to <a href="Capital%20punishment">put to death</a> all youths capable of bearing arms. On 21 July 365, Alexandria was devastated by a <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a> (<a href="365%20Crete%20earthquake">365 Crete earthquake</a>), an event annually commemorated years later as a "day of horror."

The <a href="Islamic%20prophet">Islamic prophet</a>, Muhammad's first interaction with the people of Egypt occurred in 628, during the <a href="Expedition%20of%20Zaid%20ibn%20Haritha%20%28Hisma%29">Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha (Hisma)</a>. He sent Hatib bin Abi Baltaeh with a letter to the king of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> (in reality Emperor Heraclius) and Alexandria called <a href="Muqawqis">Muqawqis</a> In the letter Muhammad said: "I invite you to accept Islam, Allah the sublime, shall reward you doubly. But if you refuse to do so, you will bear the burden of the transgression of all the Copts". During this expedition one of Muhammad's envoys <a href="Dihyah%20Kalbi">Dihyah bin Khalifa Kalbi</a> was attacked, Muhammad sent <a href="Zayd%20ibn%20Haritha">Zayd ibn Haritha</a> to help him. Dihya approached the Banu Dubayb (a tribe which converted to Islam and had good relations with Muslims) for help. When the news reached Muhammad, he immediately dispatched <a href="Zayd%20ibn%20Haritha">Zayd ibn Haritha</a> with 500 men to battle. The Muslim army fought with Banu Judham, killed several of them (inflicting heavy casualties), including their chief, Al-Hunayd ibn Arid and his son, and captured 1000 camels, 5000 of their cattle and 100 women and boys. The new chief of the <a href="Banu%20Judham">Banu Judham</a> who had embraced Islam appealed to Muhammad to release his fellow tribesmen, and Muhammad released them.

In 619, Alexandria <a href="Sassanid%20conquest%20of%20Egypt">fell</a> to the <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanid Persians</a>. Although the <a href="List%20of%20Byzantine%20emperors">Byzantine Emperor</a> <a href="Heraclius">Heraclius</a> recovered it in 629, in 641 the Arabs under the general <a href="%27Amr%20ibn%20al-%27As">'Amr ibn al-'As</a> captured it during the <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20Egypt">Muslim conquest of Egypt</a>, after a siege that lasted 14 months.

After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ridaniya">Battle of Ridaniya</a> in 1517, the city was conquered by the <a href="Ottoman%20Turks">Ottoman Turks</a> and remained under <a href="Egypt%20Eyalet">Ottoman rule</a> until 1798. Alexandria lost much of its former importance to the Egyptian port city of <a href="Rosetta">Rosetta</a> during the 9th to 18th centuries, and only regained its former prominence with the construction of the <a href="Mahmoudiyah%20Canal">Mahmoudiyah Canal</a> in 1807.

Alexandria figured prominently in the military operations of <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s <a href="French%20Campaign%20in%20Egypt%20and%20Syria">expedition to Egypt</a> in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alexandria">Battle of Alexandria</a> on 21 March 1801, following which they besieged the city, which fell to them on 2 September 1801. <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20of%20Egypt">Muhammad Ali</a>, the Ottoman governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810, and by 1850, Alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory. Egypt turned to Europe in their effort to modernize the country. Greeks, followed by other Europeans and others, began moving to the city. In the early 20th century, the city became a home for novelists and poets.

In July 1882, the city came under <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Alexandria">bombardment</a> from British naval forces and was occupied.

In July 1954, the city was a target of an Israeli bombing campaign that later became known as the <a href="Lavon%20Affair">Lavon Affair</a>. On 26 October 1954, Alexandria's Mansheya Square was the site of a failed assassination attempt on <a href="Gamal%20Abdel%20Nasser">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a>.

Europeans began leaving Alexandria following the 1956 <a href="Suez%20Crisis">Suez Crisis</a> that led to an outburst of <a href="Arab%20nationalism">Arab nationalism</a>. The nationalization of property by Nasser, which reached its highest point in 1961, drove out nearly all the rest.

The most important battles and sieges of Alexandria include:

Greek Alexandria was divided into three regions:
Two main streets, lined with <a href="colonnade">colonnade</a>s and said to have been each about wide, intersected in the center of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his <a href="Mausoleum">Mausoleum</a>) rose. This point is very near the present <a href="mosque">mosque</a> of <a href="Nebi%20Daniel">Nebi Daniel</a>; and the line of the great East–West "Canopic" street, only slightly diverged from that of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharia Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.

Alexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a <a href="mole%20%28architecture%29">mole</a> and called the "Heptastadion" ("seven stadia"—a "<a href="stadium">stadium</a>" was a Greek <a href="unit%20of%20length">unit of length</a> measuring approximately ). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the "Moon Gate" rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern "Ras al-Tin" quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbor, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbor.

In <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>'s time, (latter half of the 1st century BC) the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbor.


The names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, <a href="Lighthouse%20of%20Alexandria">The Great Lighthouse</a>, one of the <a href="Wonders%20of%20the%20World">Seven Wonders of the World</a>, reputed to be high, was situated. The first <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> began the project, and the second Ptolemy (<a href="Ptolemy%20II%20Philadelphus">Ptolemy II Philadelphus</a>) completed it, at a total cost of 800 <a href="Talent%20%28measurement%29">talent</a>s. It took 12 years to complete and served as a <a href="prototype">prototype</a> for all later <a href="lighthouse">lighthouse</a>s in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the <a href="Great%20Pyramid%20of%20Giza">Great Pyramid of Giza</a>. A temple of <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a> also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.

In the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens, according to a census dated from 32 CE, in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children and slaves. Estimates of the total population range from 216,000 to 500,000 making it one of the largest cities ever built before the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> and the largest pre-industrial city that was not an imperial capital.

Alexandria is located in the country of Egypt, on the southern coast of the Mediterranean.

Alexandria has a borderline <a href="hot%20desert%20climate">hot desert climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a>: BWh), approaching a <a href="hot%20semi-arid%20climate">hot semi-arid climate</a> (BSh). As the rest of <a href="northern%20coast%20of%20Egypt">Egypt's northern coast</a>, the prevailing north wind, blowing across the Mediterranean, gives the city a less severe climate from the desert hinterland. <a href="Rafah%2C%20Egypt%23Climate">Rafah</a> and Alexandria are the wettest places in Egypt, the other wettest places are <a href="Rosetta%23Climate">Rosetta</a>, <a href="Baltim%23Climate">Baltim</a>, <a href="Kafr%20el-Dawwar%23Climate">Kafr el-Dawwar</a> and <a href="Mersa%20Matruh%23Climate">Mersa Matruh</a>. The city's climate is influenced by the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, moderating its temperatures, causing variable rainy winters and moderately hot summers that, at times, can be very humid; January and February are the coolest months, with daily maximum temperatures typically ranging from and minimum temperatures that could reach . Alexandria experiences <a href="Severe%20weather">violent storms</a>, rain and sometimes <a href="snow">snow</a>, <a href="Ice%20pellets">sleet</a> and <a href="hail">hail</a> during the cooler months; these events, combined with a poor drainage system, have been responsible for occasional flooding in the city. July and August are the hottest and driest months of the year, with an average daily maximum temperature of .
The average annual rainfall is around but has been as high as 

<a href="Port%20Said%23Climate">Port Said</a>, <a href="al-Qusayr%2C%20Egypt%23Climate">Kosseir</a>, <a href="Baltim%23Climate">Baltim</a>, <a href="Damietta%23Climate">Damietta</a> and Alexandria have the least temperature variation in Egypt.

The highest recorded temperature was on May 30, 1961, and the coldest recorded temperature was on January 31, 1994.

Due to the constant presence of war in Alexandria in ancient times, very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day. Much of the royal and civic quarters sank beneath the harbour due to <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a> <a href="subsidence">subsidence</a> in AD 365, and the rest has been built over in modern times.
"<a href="Pompey%27s%20Pillar%20%28column%29">Pompey's Pillar</a>", a <a href="Roman%20triumphal%20column">Roman triumphal column</a>, is one of the best-known <a href="ancient%20monument">ancient monument</a>s still standing in Alexandria today. It is located on Alexandria's ancient <a href="acropolis">acropolis</a>—a modest hill located adjacent to the city's Arab <a href="cemetery">cemetery</a>—and was originally part of a temple colonnade. Including its <a href="pedestal">pedestal</a>, it is 30 m (99 ft) high; the shaft is of polished red granite, in diameter at the base, tapering to at the top. The shaft is high, and made out of a single piece of granite. Its volume is and weight approximately 396 tons. Pompey's Pillar may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a>s. <a href="Ancient%20Rome">The Romans</a> had cranes but they were not strong enough to lift something this heavy. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several <a href="Obelisks%23Obelisk%20erecting%20experiments">obelisk erecting experiments</a> including a successful attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 25-ton obelisk. The structure was plundered and demolished in the 4th century when a bishop decreed that Paganism must be eradicated. "Pompey's Pillar" is a <a href="misnomer">misnomer</a>, as it has nothing to do with <a href="Pompey">Pompey</a>, having been erected in 293 for <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a>, possibly in memory of the rebellion of <a href="Domitius%20Domitianus">Domitius Domitianus</a>. Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum, where the mysteries of the god <a href="Serapis">Serapis</a> were enacted, and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library. In more recent years, many ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea, mostly pieces of old pottery.

Alexandria's <a href="catacombs">catacombs</a>, known as "<a href="Catacombs%20of%20Kom%20el%20Shoqafa">Kom El Shoqafa</a>", are a short distance southwest of the pillar, consist of a multi-level labyrinth, reached via a large <a href="Stairway">spiral staircase</a>, and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars, statues, and other <a href="syncretism">syncretic</a> Romano-Egyptian <a href="Religious%20symbolism">religious symbols</a>, burial niches, and <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagi</a>, as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased. The catacombs were long forgotten by the citizens until they were discovered by accident in 1900.

The most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in Alexandria is known as <a href="Kom%20El%20Deka">Kom El Deka</a>. It has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theater, and the remains of its <a href="Thermae">Roman-era baths</a>.

Persistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local <a href="Archaeology">Archaeological</a> Society, and by many individuals, notably Greeks proud of a city which is one of the glories of their national history. Excavations were performed in the city by Greeks seeking the tomb of Alexander the Great without success.
The past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; <a href="David%20George%20Hogarth">D. G. Hogarth</a> made tentative researches on behalf of the <a href="Egypt%20Exploration%20Society">Egypt Exploration Fund</a> and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898–1899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.
Since the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. <a href="Cleopatra%20VII">Cleopatra VII</a>'s royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tsunami, leading to gradual <a href="subsidence">subsidence</a> in the 4th century AD. This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist <a href="Franck%20Goddio">Franck Goddio</a> and his <a href="underwater%20archaeology">team</a>. It raised a noted head of <a href="Caesarion">Caesarion</a>. These are being opened up to tourists, to some controversy. The spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest, where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman <a href="stratum">strata</a>.

The most important results were those achieved by Dr. G. Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighborhood of “Pompey's Pillar”, where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense <a href="catacombs">catacombs</a> and "columbaria" have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.

The objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in <a href="Catacombs%20of%20Kom%20El%20Shoqafa">Kom El Shoqafa</a> (Roman) and Ras El Tin (painted).

The German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of <a href="Kom%20El%20Deka">Kom El Deka</a>, which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.

The making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered. The wealth underground is doubtlessly immense; but despite all efforts, there is not much for antiquarians to see in Alexandria outside the museum and the neighborhood of “Pompey's Pillar”.

The temple was built in the Ptolemy era and dedicated to Osiris, which finished the construction of Alexandria. It is located in Abusir, the western suburb of Alexandria in Borg el Arab city. Only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple. There is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there. Archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple. Remains of a Christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries.

Alexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions.

Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by <a href="Catholic">Catholic</a> missionaries include <a href="Coll%C3%A8ge%20de%20la%20M%C3%A8re%20de%20Dieu">Collège de la Mère de Dieu</a>, Collège Notre Dame de Sion, <a href="Coll%C3%A8ge%20Saint%20Marc%2C%20Alexandria">Collège Saint Marc</a>, Ecoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), École Girard, École Saint Gabriel, École Saint-Vincent de Paul, École Saint Joseph, École Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established Lycée el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently a public school run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Lycée Français d'Alexandrie (École Champollion). It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria. The Italian school is the <a href="Istituto%20%26quot%3BDon%20Bosco%26quot%3B">Istituto "Don Bosco"</a>.

From late 2011, Alexandria International Airport was to be closed to commercial operations for two years as it underwent expansion, with all airlines operating out of <a href="Borg%20El%20Arab%20Airport">Borg El Arab Airport</a> from then onwards, where a brand new terminal was completed in February 2010.
In 2017 the government officially announced that Alexandria International Airport will shut down for good due to operational reasons, after having initially announced that it was to open during mid-2017.


Alexandria's intracity <a href="commuter%20rail">commuter rail</a> system extends from Misr Station (Alexandria's primary intercity <a href="railway%20station">railway station</a>) to <a href="Abu%20Qir">Abu Qir</a>, parallel to the <a href="Alexandria%20Tram">tram line</a>. The commuter line's <a href="locomotive">locomotive</a>s operate on <a href="diesel%20locomotive">diesel</a>, as opposed to the <a href="railway%20electrification%20system%23Overhead%20systems">overhead-electric</a> tram.

Alexandria plays host to two intercity railway stations: the aforementioned <a href="Misr%20Station">Misr Station</a> (in the older Manshia district in the western part of the city) and <a href="Sidi%20Gaber%20railway%20station">Sidi Gaber railway station</a> (in the district of Sidi Gaber in the center of the eastern expansion in which most Alexandrines reside), both of which also serve the commuter rail line. Intercity passenger service is operated by <a href="Egyptian%20National%20Railways">Egyptian National Railways</a>.

An extensive tramway network was built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa. The network begins at the <a href="Mahatet%20El%20Raml">El Raml district</a> in the west and ends in the <a href="Victoria%20%28neighborhood%29">Victoria district</a> in the east. Most of the vehicles are blue in color. Some smaller yellow-colored vehicles have further routes beyond the two main endpoints. The tram routes have one of four numbers: 1, 2, 5, and 6. All four start at El Raml, but only two (1 and 2) reach Victoria. There are two converging and diverging points. The first starts at <a href="Bolkly">Bolkly</a> (Isis) and ends at <a href="San%20Stefano%20%28neighborhood%29">San Stefano</a>. The other begins at <a href="Sporting%20%28neighborhood%29">Sporting</a> and ends at Mostafa Kamel. Route 5 starts at San Stefano and takes the inner route to Bolkly. Route 6 starts at Sidi Gaber El Sheikh in the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 1 takes the inner route between San Stefano and Bolkly and the outer route between Sporting and Mustafa Kamel. Route 2 takes the route opposite to Route 1 in both these areas. The tram fares are 25 piastres (0.25 pounds) during most of the day, and 50 piastres (0.50 pounds) after 9pm. Some trams (that date back the 30s) charge a pound. The tram is considered the cheapest method of public transport.

Taxis in Alexandria sport a yellow-and-black <a href="livery">livery</a> and are widely available. While Egyptian law requires all cabs to carry <a href="taximeter">meters</a>, these generally do not work and fares must be negotiated with the driver on either departure or arrival.

The <a href="minibus">minibus</a> <a href="share%20taxi">share taxi</a> system, or "<a href="Share%20taxi%23Mashr%C5%AB%60">mashrū`</a>" operates along well-known traffic arteries. The routes can be identified by both their endpoints and the route between them:

The route is generally written in Arabic on the side of the vehicle, although some drivers change their route without changing the paint. Some drivers also drive only a segment of a route rather than the whole path; such drivers generally stop at a point known as a major hub of the transportation system (for example, Victoria) to allow riders to transfer to another car or to another mode of transport.

Fare is generally L.E. 2.00 to travel the whole route. Shorter trips may have a lower fare, depending on the driver and the length of the trip.

Alexandria has four ports; namely the Western Port, which is the main port of the country that handles about 60% of the country’s exports and imports, Dekhela Port west of the Western Port, the Eastern Port which is a yachting harbor, and Abu Qir Port at the northern east of the governorate. It is a commercial port for general cargo and phosphates.

The Royal Library of Alexandria, in Alexandria, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, was once the largest library in the world. It is generally thought to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC, during the reign of <a href="Ptolemy%20II%20Philadelphus">Ptolemy II of Egypt</a>. It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the library complex, the temple of the <a href="Muse">Muse</a>s—the <a href="Musaeum">Museion</a>, Greek "Μουσείον" (from which the <a href="Modern%20English">Modern English</a> word "<a href="Museum%23Etymology">museum</a>" is derived).

It has been reasonably established that the library, or parts of the collection, were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions (library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming). To this day the details of the destruction (or destructions) remain a lively source of controversy.

The <a href="Bibliotheca%20Alexandrina">Bibliotheca Alexandrina</a> was inaugurated in 2002, near the site of the old Library.


The main sport that interests Alexandrians is football, as is the case in the rest of Egypt and Africa. <a href="Alexandria%20Stadium">Alexandria Stadium</a> is a <a href="multi-purpose%20stadium">multi-purpose stadium</a> in Alexandria, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. It is currently used mostly for football matches, and was used for the <a href="2006%20Africa%20Cup%20of%20Nations">2006 African Cup of Nations</a>. The stadium is the oldest stadium in Egypt, being built in 1929. The stadium holds 20,000 people. Alexandria was one of three cities that participated in hosting the <a href="Africa%20Cup%20of%20Nations">African Cup of Nations</a> in January 2006, which <a href="Egypt%20national%20football%20team">Egypt</a> won. Sea sports such as <a href="surfing">surfing</a>, <a href="Personal%20water%20craft">jet-skiing</a> and <a href="water%20polo">water polo</a> are practiced on a lower scale. The Skateboarding culture in Egypt started in this city. The city is also home to the <a href="Alexandria%20Sporting%20Club">Alexandria Sporting Club</a>, which is especially known for its basketball team, which traditionally provides the <a href="Egypt%20national%20basketball%20team">country's national team</a> with key players. The city hosted the <a href="AfroBasket">AfroBasket</a>, the continent's most prestigious basketball tournament, on four occasions (1970, 1975, 1983, 2003).

Alexandria has four <a href="stadium">stadium</a>s:

Other less popular sports like tennis and <a href="squash%20%28sport%29">squash</a> are usually played in private <a href="Social%20club">social</a> and <a href="sports%20club">sports club</a>s, like:


Alexandria is a main summer resort and <a href="Tourism%20in%20Egypt">tourist attraction</a>, due to its public and private beaches and ancient history and <a href="Museum">Museum</a>s, especially the <a href="Bibliotheca%20Alexandrina">Bibliotheca Alexandrina</a>, based on reviving the ancient <a href="Library%20of%20Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>.

One of the main tourism attractions that start every year from the city is <a href="Cross%20Egypt%20Challenge">Cross Egypt Challenge</a>. Started in 2011, Cross Egypt Challenge is an international cross-country motorcycle and scooter rally conducted throughout the most difficult tracks and roads of Egypt. Alexandria is known as the yearly starting point of Cross Egypt Challenge and a huge celebration is conducted the night before the rally starts after all the international participants arrive to the city.

The area developed as an assemblage of traders and merchants in the agricultural lands bordering the mostly unsettled areas to the north and providing a link from the south to the <a href="Old%20San%20Antonio%20Road">El Camino Real</a> and then larger settlement of <a href="Natchitoches%2C%20Louisiana">Natchitoches</a>, the oldest permanent settlement in the <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a>.

<a href="Alexander%20Fulton%20%28Louisiana%29">Alexander Fulton</a>, a <a href="business">business</a>man from <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Washington County</a>, near <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>, received a land grant from Spain in 1785, and the first organized settlement was made at some point in the 1790s. In 1805, Fulton and business partner Thomas Harris Maddox laid out the town plan and named the town in Fulton's honor. The earliest deed that survives, for an Alexandria resident is from June 24, 1805 when a William Cochren who identifies himself as a "of the Town of Alexandria" sold a tract of land across the Red River to a William Murrey.[Louisiana State Land Office, Historical Records, Sales Documents, South Western District, Sales Letters, 39].

That same year Fulton was appointed <a href="coroner">coroner</a> in Rapides Parish by <a href="Louisiana%20Territory">territorial</a> <a href="governor%20of%20Louisiana">Governor</a> <a href="William%20C.C.%20Claiborne">William C.C. Claiborne</a>. Alexandria was incorporated as a town in 1819 and received a <a href="city%20charter">city charter</a> in 1832.

In the spring of 1863, Alexandria was occupied by <a href="Union%20Army">Union</a> forces under the command of <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="David%20Dixon%20Porter">David Dixon Porter</a> and General <a href="Nathaniel%20P.%20Banks">Nathaniel P. Banks</a>. Porter arrived with his gunboats on May 7. Later in the day Banks reached Alexandria with his <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a>, whose members had marched twenty-five miles to reach the city that day. According to the <a href="historian">historian</a> <a href="John%20D.%20Winters">John D. Winters</a> of Louisiana Tech University, Porter disliked Banks but nevertheless turned over Alexandria to him and then departed to rejoin <a href="General">General</a> <a href="U.S.%20Grant">U.S. Grant</a> at the ongoing <a href="siege%20of%20Vicksburg">siege of Vicksburg</a>, <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>. Banks posted guards and declared <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a>. Porter left behind the gunboat "<a href="USS%20Lafayette%20%281848%29">USS Lafayette</a>" in Alexandria and posted the "<a href="USS%20Pittsburgh%20%281861%29">USS Pittsburg</a>" on the <a href="Black%20River%20%28Louisiana%29">Black River</a> to the northeast.

In 1864, Admiral Porter, back in the area, and General Banks quarreled over possession of <a href="cotton">cotton</a> supplies. Porter seized three hundred bales of <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> cotton from various warehouses in Alexandria and stamped it "U.S.N. prize", referring to the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. Porter sent his sailors into the country to search for unginned cotton. After the crop was located, it was brought to Alexandria to be ginned and baled. The sailors also seized <a href="molasses">molasses</a> and <a href="wool">wool</a>. Winters writes that Porter "took all cotton wherever he found it, cotton belonging to the Confederate government, cotton belonging to the 'rebels,' and cotton belonging to 'loyal' citizens."

Winters continues: "Banks was furious with Porter when he learned that the admiral was scouring the interior for cotton. Since he had no authority to stop Porter's speculative activities, Banks could only try to beat him to the remaining cotton. Army wagons were sent out in large numbers to collect the cotton. Thousands of bales were brought in by the troops and stored for future shipment. Jealous of the abundant transportation facilities of the army, unprincipled navy men stole army wagons and teams at night, repainted the wagons, and branded the mules with navy initials, and dove deep in the country in search of cotton. . . . "

The federal army made itself as comfortable as possible during its long stay in Alexandria. Winters writes that "lumber and tools were foraged, and the men busied themselves by building wooden tent floors, benches, and furniture. . . . Alexandria [was enclosed] with a zigzag line of fortifications." While Banks remained in Alexandria in the spring of 1864, Porter was temporarily trapped north of the city because of the low level of the Red River, four feet instead of the needed seven feet to accommodate gunboats.

Confederate citizens as a whole were most fearful of the Union. According to Winters, "most [Confederates] had never before seen a Yankee soldier [and] expected the worse from the invader. . . . 'Some cried, some cursed, some whined; and some overcome with fear, hid themselves in the woods, leaving everything to the tender mercies of the army.' Negroes were responsible for much of the plunder and pillage. Negro camp followers and officers' servants roamed the plantations and small farms without hindrance, bringing in their booty to camps each afternoon. . . . "

On May 13, 1864, when the Union decided to abandon Alexandria, the city was set afire despite General Banks' order to the contrary. Winters reports that "burning and plundering" by two Union corps, who set fire to a store on Front Street. Then "a strong wind spread the flames rapidly from one building to the next." Banks later claimed that the fire "broke out in the attic of one of the buildings on the <a href="levee">levee</a> inhabited by either soldiers or refugees." Winters reports that "pandemonium reigned; frightened cows bellowed and charged through the flaming streets; squawking chickens with scorched wings tried to fly out of danger. Hundreds of women, children, and old people ran through the streets, trying to carry a few of their belongings to safety. When the heat became unbearable, they dropped their loads and fled to the levee. Thieves ran from house to house and even along the levee taking whatever they wanted from the shocked people. By noon the most congested parts of town were destroyed. An attempt to blow up a church in the path of the fire only succeeded in helping to spread the flames. . . . "

Alexandria faced the overwhelming task of rebuilding with a year of the war remaining. Prices became exorbitant; butter cost $10 a pound, bacon $5 a pound, flour $3 a pound, and a bushel of meal $10. Many of the helpless lived in the forest without food, shelter, or clothing, subsisting on <a href="blackberry">blackberries</a>. All clothing was homespun, and shoes were mostly made of cloth. While Admiral Porter expressed sympathy for the suffering Alexandria residents, he declared the "burning of Alexandria a fit termination of the unfortunate Red River expedition."

Alexandria is located at and has an elevation of .

Eisenhower</a>, stayed for extended periods. The Bentley, which was closed on December 12, 2004, was once one of only two four-star hotels in Louisiana. The hotel was set to reopen in August 2007, in time for the 100th anniversary of its construction, but was prevented by funding issues. The current owner, Michael Jenkins, purchased the Bentley for $3.4 million. His plan is to keep the older portion of the building to remain a hotel and turn the 7-storey tower portion into luxury condominiums, and also to reopen Bentley's restaurant and Mirror Room lounge. The hotel and all of its components were to have been opened by the summer of 2013, but the hotel remained unfinished as of November 2014.

Following the Civil War, all public records in Alexandria had been destroyed. On September 29, 1868, the city was granted a new charter with a government consisting of a Mayor, Treasurer, and Justice of the Peace. Nine aldermen represented the four wards of the city – two from each ward and one elected at-large.

In 1912, the <a href="Lawrason%20Act">Lawrason Act</a> established Alexandria municipal government in a strong mayor format, where the mayor was also the Commissioner of Public Health and Safety (Police, Fire, Sanitation). There were separate Commissioners of Streets and Parks and Finance and Utilities, elected citywide. The last to hold those positions, which ended in 1977, were Mayor <a href="John%20K.%20Snyder">John K. Snyder</a> (1922–1993), Malcolm P. Hebert, Sr. (1926–2006), and <a href="Arnold%20Jack%20Rosenthal">Arnold Jack Rosenthal</a> (1923–2010), respectively.

Alexandria has a mayoral-council system of government. The Mayor serves as the executive branch of the local government.

Alexandria Troas

Alexandria Troas ("Alexandria of the <a href="Troad">Troad</a>"; ; ) is the site of an <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greek</a> city situated on the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> near the northern tip of <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>'s western coast, a little south of <a href="Tenedos">Tenedos</a> (modern <a href="Bozcaada">Bozcaada</a>). It is located southeast of modern Dalyan, a village in the <a href="Ezine%2C%20%C3%87anakkale">Ezine</a> district of <a href="%C3%87anakkale%20Province">Çanakkale Province</a>. The site sprawls over an estimated ; among the few structures remaining today are a ruined <a href="Thermae">bath</a>, an <a href="Odeon%20%28building%29">odeon</a>, a <a href="Theatre%20of%20ancient%20Greece">theatre</a>, <a href="Gymnasium%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">gymnasium</a> complex and a recently uncovered <a href="Stadion%20%28running%20race%29">stadion</a>. The circuit of the old walls can still be traced.

According to <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>, this site was first called Sigeia; around 306 BC <a href="Antigonus%20I%20Monophthalmus">Antigonus</a> refounded the city as the much-expanded Antigonia Troas by settling the people of five other towns in Sigeia, including the once influential city of <a href="Neandreia">Neandreia</a>. It did not receive its name until its name was changed by <a href="Lysimachus">Lysimachus</a> to Alexandria Troas, in 301 BC, in memory of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander III</a> <a href="Macedon">of Macedon</a> (<a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny</a> merely states, in his view, that the name changed from Antigonia to Alexandria). However, Pliny's view is not correct, because the city continued being called Alexandria Troas, and so is also stated in the 4th-5th c. AD Tabula Peutingeriana. As the chief port of north-west Asia Minor, the place prospered greatly in Roman times, becoming a "free and autonomous city" as early as 188 BC, and the existing remains sufficiently attest its former importance. In its heyday the city may have had a population of about 100,000. <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> mentions that a <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> <a href="Colonia%20%28Roman%29">colony</a> was created at the location in the reign of <a href="Augustus">Augustus</a>, named Colonia Alexandria Augusta Troas (called simply Troas during this period). Augustus, <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a> and the rich grammarian <a href="Herodes%20Atticus">Herodes Atticus</a> contributed greatly to its embellishment; the aqueduct still preserved is due to the latter. <a href="Constantine%20I">Constantine</a> considered making Troas the capital of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>.

In Roman times, it was a significant port for travelling between <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> and Europe. <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul</a> <a href="Tarsus%20%28city%29">of Tarsus</a> sailed for Europe for the first time from Alexandria Troas and returned there from Europe (it was there that the episode of the raising of <a href="Eutychus">Eutychus</a> later occurred). <a href="Ignatius%20of%20Antioch">Ignatius of Antioch</a> also paused at this city before continuing to his martyrdom at Rome.

Several of its later <a href="bishop">bishop</a>s are known: Marinus in 325; Niconius in 344; Sylvanus at the beginning of the 5th century; Pionius in 451; Leo in 787; Peter, friend of the <a href="Patriarch%20Ignatius%20of%20Constantinople">Patriarch Ignatius</a>, and adversary to Michael, in the ninth century. In the 10th century Troas is given as a suffragan of <a href="Cyzicus">Cyzicus</a> and distinct from the famous <a href="Troy">Troy</a> (<a href="Heinrich%20Gelzer">Heinrich Gelzer</a>, "Ungedruckte ... Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum", 552; "<a href="Georgii%20Cyprii%20descriptio%20orbis%20romani">Georgii Cyprii descriptio orbis romani</a>", 64); it is not known when the city was destroyed and the diocese disappeared. The bishopric remains a <a href="titular%20see">titular see</a> of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> under the name Troas, vacant since 1971.

Troas is also a titular see of the <a href="Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox Church</a> under the <a href="Ecumenical%20Patriarchate">Ecumenical Patriarchate</a>. Bishop Savas (Zembillas) of Troas served as hierarch from 2002 to 2011, and then became <a href="Metropolitan%20Savas%20%28Zembillas%29%20of%20Pittsburgh">Metropolitan Savas (Zembillas) of Pittsburgh</a> in the <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Archdiocese%20of%20America">Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America</a>.

<a href="Karasids">Karasid</a> <a href="Oghuz%20Turks">Turkomans</a> settled in the area of the Troad in the 14th century. Their "<a href="Anatolian%20Turkish%20Beyliks">beylik</a>" was conquered by the Ottomans in 1336. The ruins of Alexandria Troas came to be known among the Turks as "Eski Stambul", the "Old City". The site's stones were much plundered for building material (for example <a href="Mehmed%20IV">Mehmed IV</a> took columns to adorn his <a href="Yeni%20Valide%20Mosque">Yeni Valide Mosque</a> in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>). As of the mid-18th century the site served as "a lurking place for bandetti".

By 1911, the site had been overgrown with <a href="List%20of%20Quercus%20species">vallonea oaks</a> and much plundered, but the circuit of the old walls could still be traced, and in several places they were fairly well preserved. 
They had a circumference of about ten kilometres, and were fortified with towers at regular intervals.
Remains of an ancient bath and gymnasium complex can be found within this area; this building is locally known as "Bal Saray" (Honey Palace) and was originally endowed by Herodes Atticus in the year 135. <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a> built an aqueduct which can still be traced. 
The harbour had two large basins, now almost choked with sand. 
It is the subject of an early twenty-first century study by German archaeologists digging and surveying at the site. 
Their excavation uncovered the remains of a large stadium dating to about 100 BC.

Arithmetic–geometric mean

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, the arithmetic–geometric mean (AGM) of two positive <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s and is defined as follows:

First, compute the <a href="arithmetic%20mean">arithmetic</a> and <a href="geometric%20mean">geometric mean</a>s of and , calling them and respectively (the latter is the principal <a href="square%20root">square root</a> of the product ):

Then, use iteration, with taking the place of and taking the place of . In this way, two <a href="sequence">sequence</a>s and are defined:

These two sequences <a href="limit%20of%20a%20sequence">converge</a> to the same number, which is the arithmetic–geometric mean of and ; it is denoted by , or sometimes by .

This can be used for algorithmic purposes as in the AGM method, which makes it possible to construct fast <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a>s for calculating <a href="exponential%20function">exponential</a> and <a href="trigonometric%20functions">trigonometric functions</a>, as well as some <a href="mathematical%20constant">mathematical constant</a>s, in particular, to quickly <a href="computing%20%CF%80">compute formula_3</a>.

To find the arithmetic–geometric mean of and , first calculate their arithmetic and geometric means, thus:

and then iterate as follows:

The first five iterations give the following values:

As can be seen, the number of digits in agreement (underlined) approximately doubles with each iteration. The arithmetic–geometric mean of 24 and 6 is the common limit of these two sequences, which is approximately 13.4581714817256154207668131569743992430538388544.

The first algorithm based on this sequence pair appeared in the works of <a href="Joseph-Louis%20Lagrange">Lagrange</a>. Its properties were further analyzed by <a href="Gauss">Gauss</a>.

The geometric mean of two positive numbers is never bigger than the arithmetic mean (see <a href="inequality%20of%20arithmetic%20and%20geometric%20means">inequality of arithmetic and geometric means</a>); as a consequence, is an increasing sequence, is a decreasing sequence, and . These are strict inequalities if .

If , then .

There is an integral-form expression for :

where is the <a href="elliptic%20integral">complete elliptic integral of the first kind</a>:

Indeed, since the arithmetic–geometric process converges so quickly, it provides an efficient way to compute elliptic integrals via this formula. In engineering, it is used for instance in <a href="elliptic%20filter">elliptic filter</a> design.

The reciprocal of the arithmetic–geometric mean of 1 and the <a href="square%20root%20of%202">square root of 2</a> is called <a href="Gauss%27s%20constant">Gauss's constant</a>, after <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>.

The <a href="geometric%E2%80%93harmonic%20mean">geometric–harmonic mean</a> can be calculated by an analogous method, using sequences of geometric and <a href="harmonic%20mean">harmonic</a> means. The arithmetic–harmonic mean can be similarly defined, but takes the same value as the <a href="geometric%20mean">geometric mean</a>.

The arithmetic–geometric mean can be used to compute – among others – <a href="Logarithm%23Arithmetic%E2%80%93geometric%20mean%20approximation">logarithms</a>, <a href="Elliptic%20integral">complete and incomplete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind</a>, and <a href="Jacobi%20elliptic%20functions">Jacobi elliptic functions</a>.

From the <a href="inequality%20of%20arithmetic%20and%20geometric%20means">inequality of arithmetic and geometric means</a> we can conclude that:

and thus

that is, the sequence is nondecreasing.

Furthermore, it is easy to see that it is also bounded above by the larger of and (which follows from the fact that both the arithmetic and geometric means of two numbers lie between them). Thus, by the <a href="monotone%20convergence%20theorem">monotone convergence theorem</a>, the sequence is convergent, so there exists a such that:

However, we can also see that:

and so:

<a href="Q.E.D.">Q.E.D.</a>

This proof is given by Gauss.
Let

Changing the variable of integration to formula_15, where

gives

Thus, we have

The last equality comes from observing that formula_19.

Finally, we obtain the desired result

<a href="Gauss">Gauss</a> noticed that the sequences

as

have the same limit:
the arithmetic–geometric mean, "agm".

It is possible to use this fact to construct <a href="fast%20algorithms">fast algorithms</a> for calculating <a href="elementary%20function">elementary</a> <a href="transcendental%20function">transcendental function</a>s and some classical constants, in particular, the constant <a href="pi"></a>.

For example, according to the Gauss–<a href="Eugene%20Salamin%20%28mathematician%29">Salamin</a> formula:

where

which can be computed without loss of precision using

Taking formula_27 , yields the "agm",
where is a complete <a href="elliptic%20integral">elliptic integral of the first kind</a>,
That is to say that this <a href="quarter%20period">quarter period</a> may be efficiently computed through the "agm",

Using this property of the AGM along with the ascending transformations of Landen, <a href="Richard%20P.%20Brent">Richard Brent</a> suggested the first AGM algorithms for the fast evaluation of elementary transcendental functions ("e", cos "x", sin "x"). Subsequently, many authors went on to study the use of the AGM algorithms.

Akira Toriyama

He earned the 1981 <a href="Shogakukan%20Manga%20Award">Shogakukan Manga Award</a> for best "<a href="sh%C5%8Dnen%20manga">shōnen</a>" or "<a href="sh%C5%8Djo%20manga">shōjo</a>" manga with "Dr. Slump", and it went on to sell over 35 million copies in Japan. It was adapted into a successful <a href="anime">anime</a> series, with a second anime created in 1997, 13 years after the manga ended. His next series, "Dragon Ball", would become one of the most popular and successful manga in the world. Having sold more than 240 million copies worldwide, it is the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20manga">second best-selling manga of all time</a> and is considered to be one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. Overseas, "Dragon Ball"s anime adaptations have been more successful than the manga and are credited with boosting anime's popularity in the Western world.

Akira Toriyama was born in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. He has recalled that when he was in elementary school all of his classmates drew, imitating anime and manga, as a result of not having many forms of entertainment. He believes that he began to advance above everyone else when he started drawing pictures of his friends, and after winning a prize at the local art studio for a picture of "<a href="One%20Hundred%20and%20One%20Dalmatians">One Hundred and One Dalmatians</a>", began to think "art was fun".

Before becoming a manga artist, he worked at an <a href="advertising%20agency">advertising agency</a> in Nagoya designing posters for three years. After quitting his previous job, Toriyama entered the manga industry by submitting a work to an amateur contest in a "<a href="Jump%20%28magazine%20line%29">Jump</a>" magazine in order to win the prize money. While it did not win, <a href="Kazuhiko%20Torishima">Kazuhiko Torishima</a>, who would later become his editor, contacted him and gave him encouragement. His debut came later in 1978 with the story "<a href="Wonder%20Island">Wonder Island</a>", which was published in "<a href="Weekly%20Sh%C5%8Dnen%20Jump">Weekly Shōnen Jump</a>". However, he did not rise to popularity until the comedy series "<a href="Dr.%20Slump">Dr. Slump</a>", which was serialized in "Weekly Shōnen Jump" from 1980 to 1984. It follows the adventures of a perverted professor and his small but super-strong robot <a href="Arale%20Norimaki">Arale</a>. He began the series at age 25 while living at home with his parents, but when the series ended in 1984 he was a "manga superstar". In 1981, "Dr. Slump" earned him the <a href="Shogakukan%20Manga%20Award">Shogakukan Manga Award</a> for best "<a href="sh%C5%8Dnen%20manga">shōnen</a>" or <a href="sh%C5%8Djo%20manga">"shōjo" manga</a> series of the year. A very successful anime adaptation aired on TV from 1981 to 1986, with a remake series airing from 1997 to 1999. By 2008, the manga had sold over 35 million copies in Japan.

In 1984, "Weekly Shōnen Jump" began serializing Toriyama's "<a href="Dragon%20Ball">Dragon Ball</a>", which became an instant hit. To date it has sold over 156 million copies in Japan alone, making it <a href="Shueisha">Shueisha</a>'s second best-selling manga of all time. It began as an adventure/gag manga but later turned into a martial arts fighting series, considered by many to be the "most influential "shōnen" manga". "Dragon Ball" was one of the main reasons for the magazine's circulation hitting a record high of 6.53 million copies (1995). The series' success encouraged Toriyama to continue working on it from 1984 to 1995. At the series' end, Toriyama said that he asked everyone involved to let him end the manga, so he could "take some new steps in life". During that 11-year period, he produced 519 chapters that were collected into 42 volumes. Moreover, the success of the manga led to five anime adaptations, <a href="List%20of%20Dragon%20Ball%20films">several animated movies</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Dragon%20Ball%20video%20games">numerous video games</a>, and mega-merchandising. The third anime adaptation, "<a href="Dragon%20Ball%20GT">Dragon Ball GT</a>", was not based on his manga; however, Toriyama was still involved in coming up with the name and designing the main cast. Although the fifth, "<a href="Dragon%20Ball%20Super">Dragon Ball Super</a>", is also not based on the manga, Toriyama is credited with its story and character designs. Aside from its popularity in Japan, "Dragon Ball" was successful internationally as well, including in Europe and North America, with a total of 240 million copies of the manga sold worldwide.

Toriyama's design sense led to a position designing characters for the popular "<a href="Dragon%20Quest">Dragon Quest</a>" series of <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a>s (formerly called "Dragon Warrior" in North America). He has also served as the character designer for the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Famicom</a> RPG "<a href="Chrono%20Trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>" and for the <a href="fighting%20game">fighting game</a>s "<a href="Tobal%20No.%201">Tobal No. 1</a>" and "<a href="Tobal%202">Tobal 2</a>" for the <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a>.

Toriyama's own studio is called Bird Studio, which is a play on his name; meaning "bird". Toriyama does nearly all of the work at Bird Studio himself, and even when he employed an assistant (until 1995, and only one at a time, which is itself rare for manga artists), the assistant did mostly backgrounds. The studio founded in 1983 has produced occasional one-shots, or stand-alone manga that are not serialized, and some other design work. Toriyama's manga after "Dragon Ball" tend to be short (100–200-page) stories, including "<a href="Cowa%21">Cowa!</a>", "<a href="Kajika">Kajika</a>", and "<a href="Sand%20Land">Sand Land</a>".

On December 6, 2002, Toriyama made his only promotional appearance in the United States at the launch of "Weekly Shōnen Jump"'s North American counterpart, "<a href="Shonen%20Jump%20%28magazine%29">Shonen Jump</a>", in New York City. Toriyama's "Dragon Ball" and "Sand Land" were published in the magazine in the first issue, which also included an in-depth interview with him.

On March 27, 2005, CQ Motors began selling an <a href="electric%20car">electric car</a> designed by Toriyama. The one-person QVOLT is part of the company's <a href="Choro-Q">Choro-Q</a> series of small electric cars, with only 9 being produced. It costs 1,990,000 yen (about $19,000 US), has a top speed of and is available in 5 colors. Designed to look like an American <a href="Street%20rod%20%28car%29">street rod</a>, the QVOLT has a top and a door that are both opened by pulling a cord. Toriyama stated that the car took over a year to design, "but due to my genius mini-model construction skills, I finally arrived at the end of what was a very emotional journey."

He worked on a 2006 <a href="One-shot%20%28comics%29">one-shot</a> called "<a href="Cross%20Epoch%20%28manga%29">Cross Epoch</a>", in cooperation with "<a href="One%20Piece">One Piece</a>" creator <a href="Eiichiro%20Oda">Eiichiro Oda</a>. The story is a short <a href="Intercompany%20crossover">crossover</a> that presents characters from both "Dragon Ball" and "One Piece". Toriyama was the character designer and artist for the 2006 <a href="Mistwalker">Mistwalker</a> <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> exclusive RPG "<a href="Blue%20Dragon%20%28video%20game%29">Blue Dragon</a>", working with <a href="Hironobu%20Sakaguchi">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a> and <a href="Nobuo%20Uematsu">Nobuo Uematsu</a>, both of whom he had previously worked with on "Chrono Trigger". He announced that his help with the making of the <a href="Blue%20Dragon%20%28anime%29">"Blue Dragon" anime</a> might very well be his final work in anime. In his own words, he said:
In 2008, he collaborated with <a href="Masakazu%20Katsura">Masakazu Katsura</a>, his good friend and creator of "<a href="I%26quot%3Bs">I"s</a>" and "<a href="Zetman">Zetman</a>", for the "<a href="Jump%20Square">Jump SQ</a>" one-shot "<a href="Sachie-chan%20Good%21%21">Sachie-chan Good!!</a>". It was published in North America in the free SJ Alpha Yearbook 2013, which was mailed out to annual subscribers of the digital manga magazine "<a href="Shonen%20Jump%20Alpha">Shonen Jump Alpha</a>" in December 2012. The two worked together again in 2009, for the three-chapter one-shot "<a href="Jiya">Jiya</a>" in "<a href="Weekly%20Young%20Jump">Weekly Young Jump</a>".

<a href="Avex%20Trax">Avex Trax</a> commissioned Toriyama to draw a portrait of pop singer <a href="Ayumi%20Hamasaki">Ayumi Hamasaki</a>; it was printed on the CD of her 2009 single "<a href="Rule/Sparkle">Rule/Sparkle</a>", which was used as the theme song to the American live-action "<a href="Dragonball%20Evolution">Dragonball Evolution</a>" film. Also in 2009, Toriyama drew a manga titled "Delicious Island's Mr. U" for Anjō's Rural Society Project, a nonprofit <a href="environmental%20organization">environmental organization</a> that teaches the importance of agriculture and nature to young children. They originally asked him to do the illustrations for a pamphlet, but Toriyama liked the project and decided to expand it into a story. It is included in a booklet about <a href="environmental%20awareness">environmental awareness</a> that is distributed by the <a href="Anj%C5%8D%2C%20Aichi">Anjō</a> city government.

He collaborated with "Shōnen Jump" to create a video to raise awareness and support for those affected by the <a href="2011%20T%C5%8Dhoku%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami</a> on March 11, 2011. "", the series' first theatrical film in 17 years, opened on March 30, 2013 and marks the first time Toriyama has been deeply involved in an animation, in this case as early as the screenwriting stages. A special "dual ticket" that can be used to see both "Battle of Gods" and "" was created with new art by both Toriyama and Eiichiro Oda, creator of "One Piece".

His one-shot "<a href="Kintoki%20%28manga%29">Kintoki</a>", originally published in 2010, was released in North America's online manga anthology "<a href="Weekly%20Shonen%20Jump%20%28American%20magazine%29">Weekly Shonen Jump</a>" on January 28, 2013. On March 27, the "Akira Toriyama: The World of "Dragon Ball"" exhibit opened at the <a href="Takashimaya">Takashimaya</a> department store in <a href="Nihonbashi">Nihonbashi</a>, garnering 72,000 visitors in its first nineteen days. The exhibit is separated into seven areas. The first provides a look at the series' history, the second shows the 400-plus characters from the series, the third displays Toriyama's manga <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a>s from memorable scenes, the fourth shows special color illustrations, the fifth displays rare "Dragon Ball"-related materials, the sixth includes design sketches and animation <a href="cel">cel</a>s from the anime, and the seventh screens "Dragon Ball"-related videos. It was there until April 15, when it moved to Osaka from April 17 to 23, and ended in Toriyama's native Nagoya from July 27 to September 1. To celebrate the 45th anniversary of "Weekly Shōnen Jump", Toriyama launched a new series in its July 13 issue titled "<a href="Jaco%20the%20Galactic%20Patrolman">Jaco the Galactic Patrolman</a>". Viz Media began serializing it in English in their digital "Weekly Shonen Jump" magazine, beginning just two days later.

The follow-up film to "Battle of Gods", "" released on April 18, 2015, features even more contributions from Toriyama. He currently contributes to the "Dragon Ball Super" anime and manga since June 2015.

Toriyama married his wife on May 2, 1982. She is a former manga artist from Nagoya under the pen name , and occasionally helped Toriyama and his assistant on "Dr. Slump" when they were short on time. They have two children; a son named born on March 23, 1987, and a daughter born in October 1990. Toriyama lives in his home studio in <a href="Kiyosu">Kiyosu</a>.

Toriyama has a love of cars and motorcycles, something he inherited from his father who used to race motorbikes and operated an auto repair business for a brief time. Although he does not understand the mechanics himself. The author is an animal lover, having kept many different species of birds, dogs, cats, fish, lizards and bugs as pets since childhood. Some were used as models for characters he created such as <a href="Karin%20%28Dragon%20Ball%29">Karin</a> and <a href="Beerus">Beerus</a>. Toriyama has had a lifelong passion for <a href="plastic%20model">plastic model</a>s, and has designed several for the Fine Molds brand. He also collected autographs of famous manga artists, having over 30 including <a href="Yudetamago">Yudetamago</a> and <a href="Hisashi%20Eguchi">Hisashi Eguchi</a>, a hobby he gave to <a href="Peasuke%20Soramame">Peasuke Soramame</a>.

Toriyama admires <a href="Osamu%20Tezuka">Osamu Tezuka</a>'s "<a href="Astro%20Boy">Astro Boy</a>" and was impressed by <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a>'s "<a href="One%20Hundred%20and%20One%20Dalmatians">One Hundred and One Dalmatians</a>", which he remembers for its high-quality animation. <a href="Jackie%20Chan">Jackie Chan</a>'s early movies also had a noticeable influence on his stories, particularly Chan's martial arts comedy film "<a href="Drunken%20Master">Drunken Master</a>". Toriyama stated he was influenced by animator <a href="Toyoo%20Ashida">Toyoo Ashida</a> and the anime television series adaptation of his own "Dragon Ball"; from which he learned that separating colors instead of blending them makes the art cleaner and coloring illustrations easier. It was Toriyama's sound effects in "Mysterious Rain Jack" that caught the eye of <a href="Kazuhiko%20Torishima">Kazuhiko Torishima</a>, who explained that usually they are written in "<a href="katakana">katakana</a>", but Toriyama used the <a href="Roman%20alphabet">Roman alphabet</a> which he found refreshing. In his opinion, Torishima stated that Toriyama excels in black and white, utilizing black areas, as a result of not having had the money to buy screentone when he started drawing manga.

"Dr. Slump" is mainly a comedy series, filled with <a href="pun">pun</a>s, <a href="Off-color%20humor">toilet humor</a> and sexual innuendos. But it also contained many science fiction elements; aliens, <a href="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> characters, <a href="time%20travel">time travel</a>, and parodies of works such as <a href="Godzilla">Godzilla</a>, "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" and "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>". Toriyama also included many real-life people in the series, such as his assistants, wife and colleagues (such as <a href="Masakazu%20Katsura">Masakazu Katsura</a>), but most notably his editor Kazuhiko Torishima as the series' main antagonist, <a href="Dr.%20Mashirito">Dr. Mashirito</a>.

When "Dragon Ball" began, it was loosely based on the classic Chinese novel "<a href="Journey%20to%20the%20West">Journey to the West</a>", with <a href="Goku">Goku</a> being <a href="Sun%20Wukong">Sun Wukong</a> and <a href="Bulma">Bulma</a> as <a href="Xuanzang%20%28fictional%20character%29">Xuanzang</a>. Toriyama continued to use his characteristic comedic style in the beginning, but over the course of time this slowly changed, with him turning the series into a "nearly-pure fighting manga" later on. He did not plan out in advance what would happen in the series, instead choosing to draw as he went. This, coupled with him simply forgetting things he had already drawn, caused him to find himself in situations that he had to write himself out of. In a rare 2013 interview, commenting on "Dragon Ball"'s global success, Toriyama admitted, "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened. While the manga was being serialized, the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy." Speaking of his manga in general, he said, "The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through. I dare say I don't care even if [my works] have left nothing behind, as long as they have entertained their readers."

Toriyama was commissioned to illustrate the characters and monsters for the first "<a href="Dragon%20Warrior">Dragon Quest</a>" video game (1986) in order to separate it from other role-playing games of the time. He has since worked on every title in <a href="Dragon%20Quest">the series</a>. For each game <a href="Yuji%20Horii">Yuji Horii</a> first sends rough sketches of the characters with their background information to Toriyama, who then re-draws them. Lastly, Horii approves the finished work. Toriyama explained in 1995 that for video games, because the <a href="Sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a> are so small, as long as they have a distinguishing feature so people can tell which character it is, he can make complex designs without concern of having to reproduce it like he usually would in manga. Besides the character and monster designs, Toriyama also does the games' packaging art and, for "", the boats and ships. The series' <a href="Slime%20%28Dragon%20Quest%29">Slime</a> character, which has become a sort of mascot for the franchise, is considered to be one of the most recognizable figures in gaming.

Manga critic <a href="Jason%20Thompson%20%28writer%29">Jason Thompson</a> declared Toriyama's art influential, saying that his "extremely personal and recognizable style" was a reason for "Dragon Ball"'s popularity. He points out that the popular "shōnen" manga of the late 1980s and early 1990s had "<a href="Masculinity">manly</a>" heroes, such as "<a href="City%20Hunter">City Hunter</a>" and "<a href="Fist%20of%20the%20North%20Star">Fist of the North Star</a>", whereas "Dragon Ball" starred the cartoonish and small Goku, thus starting a trend that Thompson says continues to this day. Toriyama himself said he went against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size, designing many of the series' most powerful characters with small statures. Thompson concluded his analysis by saying that only Akira Toriyama drew like this at the time and that "Dragon Ball" is "an action manga drawn by a gag manga artist." However, James S. Yadao, author of "The Rough Guide to Manga", points out that an art shift does occur in the series, as the characters gradually "lose the rounded, innocent look that [Toriyama] established in "Dr. Slump" and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity."

Thompson stated in 2011 that ""Dragon Ball" is by far the most influential shonen manga of the last 30 years, and today, almost every "Shōnen Jump" artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways." Many manga artists have named Toriyama and "Dragon Ball" as influences, including "<a href="One%20Piece">One Piece</a>" author <a href="Eiichiro%20Oda">Eiichiro Oda</a>, "<a href="Naruto">Naruto</a>" creator <a href="Masashi%20Kishimoto">Masashi Kishimoto</a>, "<a href="Fairy%20Tail">Fairy Tail</a>" and "<a href="Rave%20Master">Rave</a>" author <a href="Hiro%20Mashima">Hiro Mashima</a>, "<a href="Venus%20Versus%20Virus">Venus Versus Virus</a>" author <a href="Atsushi%20Suzumi">Atsushi Suzumi</a>, "<a href="Bleach%20%28manga%29">Bleach</a>" creator <a href="Tite%20Kubo">Tite Kubo</a>, "<a href="Black%20Cat%20%28manga%29">Black Cat</a>" author <a href="Kentaro%20Yabuki">Kentaro Yabuki</a>, and "<a href="Mr.%20Fullswing">Mr. Fullswing</a>" author Shinya Suzuki. <a href="Ian%20Jones-Quartey">Ian Jones-Quartey</a>, a producer of the American animated series "<a href="Steven%20Universe">Steven Universe</a>", is a fan of both "Dragon Ball" and "Dr. Slump", and uses Toriyama's vehicle designs as reference for his own. He also stated that "We're all big Toriyama fans on ["Steven Universe"], which kind of shows a bit." In 2008, <a href="Oricon">Oricon</a> conducted a poll of people's favorite manga artists, with Toriyama coming in second, only behind "<a href="Nana%20%28manga%29">Nana</a>" author <a href="Ai%20Yazawa">Ai Yazawa</a>. However, he was number one among male respondents and among those over 30 years of age. They held a poll on the Mangaka that Changed the History of Manga in 2010, "mangaka" being the Japanese word for a manga artist. Toriyama came in second, after only Osamu Tezuka, due to his works being highly influential and popular worldwide. Toriyama won the Special 40th Anniversary Festival Award at the 2013 <a href="Angoul%C3%AAme%20International%20Comics%20Festival">Angoulême International Comics Festival</a>, honoring his years in cartooning. He actually received the most votes for the festival's <a href="Grand%20Prix%20de%20la%20ville%20d%27Angoul%C3%AAme">Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoulême</a> award that year; however, the selection committee chose <a href="Bernard%20Willem%20Holtrop">Willem</a> as the recipient. Due to his video game design work, <a href="IGN">IGN</a> named Toriyama number 74 on their list of the Top 100 Game Creators of All Time.

Epsilon Ursae Majoris

Epsilon Ursae Majoris (ε Ursae Majoris, abbreviated Epsilon UMa, ε UMa), also named Alioth, is (despite being designated '<a href="epsilon">epsilon</a>') the brightest <a href="star">star</a> in the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> of <a href="Ursa%20Major">Ursa Major</a>, and at <a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a> 1.76 is the <a href="list%20of%20brightest%20stars">thirty-first-brightest star in the sky</a>.

It is the star in the tail of the bear closest to its body, and thus the star in the handle of the <a href="Big%20Dipper">Big Dipper</a> (Plough) closest to the bowl. It is also a member of the large and diffuse <a href="Ursa%20Major%20moving%20group">Ursa Major moving group</a>. Historically, the star was frequently used in <a href="celestial%20navigation">celestial navigation</a> in the maritime trade, because it is listed as one of the 57 <a href="navigational%20stars">navigational stars</a>.

According to "<a href="Hipparcos">Hipparcos</a>", Alioth is from the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>. Its <a href="spectral%20type">spectral type</a> is <a href="Ap%20and%20Bp%20stars">A1p</a>; the "p" stands for "<a href="Peculiar%20star">peculiar</a>", as the <a href="electromagnetic%20spectrum">spectrum</a> of its light is characteristic of an <a href="Alpha2%20Canum%20Venaticorum%20variable">Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variable</a>. Alioth, as a representative of this type, may harbor two interacting processes. First, the star's strong <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a> separating different elements in the star's <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> 'fuel'. In addition, a rotation axis at an angle to the magnetic axis may be spinning different bands of magnetically sorted elements into the line of sight between Alioth and the Earth. The intervening elements react differently at different frequencies of light as they whip in and out of view, causing Alioth to have very strange <a href="spectral%20line">spectral line</a>s that fluctuate over a period of 5.1 days. The "kB9" suffix to the spectral type indicates that the <a href="calcium">calcium</a> K line is present and representative of a B9 spectral type even though the rest of the spectrum indicates A1.

With Alioth, the rotational and magnetic axes are at almost 90 degrees to one another. Darker (denser) regions of <a href="chromium">chromium</a> form a band at right angles to the equator.

A recent study suggests Alioth's 5.1-day variation may be due to a substellar object of about 14.7 Jupiter masses in an eccentric orbit (e=0.5) with an average separation of 0.055 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s.

Alioth has a relatively weak magnetic field, 15 times weaker than α CVn, but it is still 100 times stronger than that of the Earth.

"ε Ursae Majoris" (<a href="Latinisation%20of%20names">Latinised</a> to "Epsilon Ursae Majoris") is the star's <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>. 

The traditional name "Alioth" comes from the <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> "alyat" (fat tail of a sheep). In 2016, the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> organized a <a href="IAU%20Working%20Group%20on%20Star%20Names">Working Group on Star Names</a> (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included "Alioth" for this star.

This star was known to the <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a>s as "<a href="Angiras%20%28sage%29">Añgiras</a>", one of the <a href="Saptarishi">Seven Rishis</a>.

In <a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a>, (), meaning "<a href="Purple%20Forbidden%20enclosure">Northern Dipper</a>", refers to an <a href="Asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a> consisting of Epsilon Ursae Majoris, <a href="Alpha%20Ursae%20Majoris">Alpha Ursae Majoris</a>, <a href="Beta%20Ursae%20Majoris">Beta Ursae Majoris</a>, <a href="Gamma%20Ursae%20Majoris">Gamma Ursae Majoris</a>, <a href="Delta%20Ursae%20Majoris">Delta Ursae Majoris</a>, <a href="Zeta%20Ursae%20Majoris">Zeta Ursae Majoris</a> and <a href="Eta%20Ursae%20Majoris">Eta Ursae Majoris</a>.

Amiga 500

The Amiga 500, also known as the A500, is the first low-end <a href="Commodore%20International">Commodore</a> <a href="Amiga">Amiga</a> <a href="16-bit">16</a>/<a href="32-bit">32-bit</a> <a href="multimedia">multimedia</a> home/<a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>. It was announced at the winter <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a> in January 1987at the same time as the high-end <a href="Amiga%202000">Amiga 2000</a>and competed directly against the <a href="Atari%20ST">Atari 520ST</a>. Before Amiga 500 was shipped, Commodore suggested that the list price of the Amiga 500 was without a monitor. At delivery in October 1987, Commodore announced that the Amiga 500 would carry a list price. In Europe, the Amiga 500 was released in May 1987. In the Netherlands, the A500 was available from April 1987 for a list price of 1499 <a href="Dutch%20guilder">HFL</a> (US$730 in 1987).

The Amiga 500 represents a return to Commodore's roots by being sold in the same mass retail outlets as the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a>to which it was a spiritual successoras opposed to the computer-store-only <a href="Amiga%201000">Amiga 1000</a>, as well as being another computer whose keyboard is included just above in the same case.

The original Amiga 500 proved to be Commodore’s best-selling Amiga model, enjoying particular success in Europe. Although popular with hobbyists, arguably its most widespread use was as a gaming machine, where its advanced graphics and sound were of significant benefit. Amiga 500 eventually sold 6 million units worldwide.

In October 1989, the Amiga 500 dropped its price from <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>499 to £399 and was bundled with the "Batman Pack" in the United Kingdom. This price drop helped Commodore to sell more than 1 million Amiga 500s in 1989.

In late 1991, an enhanced model known as the <a href="Amiga%20500%20Plus">Amiga 500 Plus</a> replaced the original 500 in some markets; it was bundled with the "Cartoon Classics" pack in the United Kingdom at £399, although many stores still advertised it as an 'A500'.

The Amiga 500 series was discontinued in June 1992 and replaced by the similarly specified and priced <a href="Amiga%20600">Amiga 600</a>, although this new machine had originally been intended as a much cheaper model, which would have been the A300. In late 1992, Commodore released the “next-generation” <a href="Amiga%201200">Amiga 1200</a>, a machine closer in concept to the original Amiga 500, but featuring significant technical improvements. Despite this, neither the A1200 nor the A600 replicated the commercial success of its predecessor, as by this time, the popular market was definitively shifting from the <a href="home%20computer">home computer</a> platforms of the past to commodity <a href="Wintel">Wintel</a> <a href="IBM%20PC%20compatible">PCs</a> and the new "low-cost" <a href="Macintosh%20Classic">Macintosh Classic</a>, <a href="Macintosh%20LC">LC</a> and <a href="IIsi">IIsi</a> models.

Codenamed "<a href="Rock%20Lobster">Rock Lobster</a>" during development and outwardly resembling the <a href="Commodore%20128">Commodore 128</a>, the Amiga 500 houses the keyboard and CPU in one shell, unlike the <a href="Amiga%201000">Amiga 1000</a>. It utilizes a Motorola 68000 microprocessor running at (NTSC) or (PAL). The CPU implements a 32-bit model, has 32-bit registers and 32-bit internal data bus, but it has a 16-bit main <a href="Arithmetic%20logic%20unit">ALU</a>, uses a 16-bit external data bus and 24-bit address bus, providing a maximum of 16 MB of <a href="address%20space">address space</a>.

The earliest Amiga 500 models use nearly the same <a href="Original%20Amiga%20chipset">Original Amiga chipset</a> as the Amiga 1000. So graphics can be displayed in multiple resolutions and color depths, even on the same screen. Resolutions vary from 320×200 (up to 32 colors) to 640×200 (up to 16 colors) for NTSC (704×484 overscan) and 320×256 to 640×256 for PAL (704×576 overscan.) The system uses <a href="planar%20%28computer%20graphics%29">planar</a> graphics, with up to five bitplanes (four in high resolution) allowing 2-, 4-, 8-, 16-, and 32-color screens, from a palette of 4096 colors. Two special graphics modes are also available: Extra HalfBrite, which uses a 6th bitplane as a mask to cut the brightness of any pixel in half (resulting in 32 arbitrary colors plus 32 more colors set at half the value of the first 32), and which allows all 4096 colors to be used on screen simultaneously. Later revisions of the chipset are <a href="PAL">PAL</a>/<a href="NTSC">NTSC</a> switchable in software.

The sound chip produces four hardware-mixed channels, two to the left and two to the right, of 8-bit PCM at a sampling frequency of up to . Each hardware channel has its own independent volume level and sampling rate, and can be designated to another channel where it can modulate both volume and frequency using its own output. With <a href="Direct%20memory%20access">DMA</a> disabled it's possible to output with a sampling frequency up to . There's a common trick to <a href="Original%20Chip%20Set%23Audio">output sound with 14-bit precision</a> that can be combined to output 14-bit sound.

The stock system comes with <a href="AmigaOS">AmigaOS</a> version 1.2 or 1.3 and of <a href="Amiga%20chip%20RAM">chip RAM</a> (150 ns access time), one built-in double-density <a href="floppy%20disk%20drive">standard floppy disk drive</a> that is completely programmable and can read <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a> disks, standard Amiga disks, and up to using custom-formatting drivers.

Despite the lack of <a href="Amiga%20Zorro%20II">Amiga 2000-compatible internal expansion slots</a>, there are many ports and expansion options. There are two <a href="D-subminiature">DE9M</a> <a href="Atari%20joystick%20port">Atari joystick port</a>s for <a href="joystick">joystick</a>s or <a href="mouse%20%28computing%29">mice</a>, stereo audio (<a href="RCA%20connector">RCA connector</a>s 1 V <a href="peak-to-peak">p-p</a>). There is a floppy drive port for daisy-chaining up to three extra floppy disk drives via an DB23F connector. The then-standard <a href="RS-232">RS-232</a> serial port (DB25M) and <a href="Centronics">Centronics</a> <a href="parallel%20port">parallel port</a> (DB25F) are also included. The power supply is (, ). 
The system displays video in analog <a href="component%20video">RGB</a> PAL or NTSC through a proprietary DB23M connector and in NTSC mode the line frequency is <a href="synchronization">HSync</a> for standard video modes, which is compatible with NTSC television and CVBS/RGB video, but out of range for most <a href="video%20graphics%20array">VGA</a>-compatible monitors, while a <a href="multisync%20monitor">multisync monitor</a> is required for some of the higher resolutions. This connection can also be <a href="genlock">genlock</a>ed to an external video signal. The system was bundled with an <a href="RF%20modulator">RF adapter</a> to provide output on <a href="television">television</a>s with a coaxial RF input, while monochrome <a href="composite%20video">composite video</a> is available via an <a href="RCA%20connector">RCA connector</a> (also coaxial). There is also a <a href="Zorro%20II">Zorro II</a> bus expansion on the left side (behind a plastic cover). Peripherals such as a hard disk drive can be added via the expansion slot and are configured automatically by the Amiga's <a href="AutoConfig">AutoConfig</a> standard, so that multiple devices do not conflict with each other. Up to of “fast RAM" can be added using the side expansion slot.

The Amiga 500 has a "trap-door" slot on the underside for an upgrade of of RAM. This extra RAM is classified as "fast" RAM, but is sometimes referred to as "slow" RAM: due to the design of the expansion bus, it is actually on the chipset bus. Such upgrades usually include a battery-backed <a href="real-time%20clock">real-time clock</a>. All versions of the A500 can have the additional RAM configured as chip RAM by a simple hardware modification, which involves fitting a later model (8372A) <a href="MOS%20Technology%20Agnus">Agnus</a> chip. Likewise, all versions of the A500 can be upgraded to chip RAM by fitting the chip and adding additional memory.

The Amiga 500 also sports an unusual feature for a budget machine, socketed chips, which allow easy replacement of defective chips. The CPU can be directly upgraded on the motherboard to a <a href="Motorola%2068010">68010</a>; or to a <a href="Motorola%2068020">68020</a>, <a href="Motorola%2068030">68030</a>, or <a href="Motorola%2068040">68040</a> via the side expansion slot; or by removing the CPU and plugging a CPU expansion card into the CPU socket (though this will require opening the computer and voiding any remaining warranty). In fact, all the custom chips can be upgraded to the <a href="Amiga%20Enhanced%20Chip%20Set">Amiga Enhanced Chip Set</a> (ECS) versions.

The case is made from <a href="Acrylonitrile%20butadiene%20styrene">ABS</a> plastics which may become brown with time. This may be reversed by using the public-domain chemical mix "<a href="Retr0bright">Retr0bright</a>", though without a clearcoat to block oxygen, the brown colouring will return.

Whenever the computer is powered on a self-diagnostic test is run that will show any failure with a specific colour where medium green means no chip RAM found or is damaged, red means bad <a href="Kickstart%20%28Amiga%29">kickstart</a>-<a href="Read-only%20memory">ROM</a>, yellow means the <a href="central%20processing%20unit">CPU</a> has crashed (no trap routine or trying to run bad code) or a bad <a href="Amiga%20Zorro%20II">Zorro</a> <a href="expansion%20card">expansion card</a>.
Stopping on means that the CIA might be defective. mean there is a ROM or <a href="MOS%20Technology%20CIA">CIA</a> problem, while
The keyboard <a href="light-emitting%20diode">LED</a> uses blink codes: one blink means the keyboard ROM has a checksum error, two blinks means RAM failure, three blinks means watchdog timer failure. Using <a href="Caps%20Lock">Caps Lock</a> key and getting a response means <a href="MOS%20Technology%20CIA">CIA</a> and the CPU works. There is no guarantee that every blinking state or color is accurate. Remember when the diagnostic codes are triggered it means the computer has some kind of fault and it can easily mis-interpret the fault and give false readings. For example, if the screen flashes green it can mean the Agnus is bad, the Agnus socket is bad, the logic connected to the Agnus is bad, the logic connected to the CPU is bad, the logic connected to the RAM is bad, a connection between CPU and/or logic and/or Agnus and/or Chip RAM is bad and/or some/all of the chip RAM is faulty etc. etc. Many of the issues with Amigas are caused by damage from corrosion or poor repair skills, especially the A500+ which has a Ni-Cad battery fitted and is always corroded if the battery has not been removed. Likewise a corroded battery on an A501 can cause faults on the A500 motherboard if the corrosion is very bad and has spread to the motherboard. The self-test chip RAM check is very brief and simplistic and all the other tests are minimalistic to minimize the start-up time (as documented in the Amiga Hardware Manual and many other official Commodore technical documents) so there is no guarantee that any of the diagnostic colours are 100% accurate.


Max 6 <a href="Color%20depth">bpp</a>. The Amiga could show multiple resolution modes at the same time, splitting the screen vertically. An additional mode called <a href="Hold-And-Modify">Hold-And-Modify</a> (HAM) makes it possible to utilize over a wide span. This works by letting each pixel position use the previous RGB value and modify one of the red, green or blue values to a new 4-bit value. This will cause some negligible colour artifacts however.



A popular expansion for the Amiga 500 was the Amiga 501 circuit board that can be installed underneath the computer behind a plastic cover. It contains RAM configured by default as "<a href="Amiga%20Chip%20RAM%23Fast%20RAM">Slow RAM</a>" or "trap-door RAM" and a battery-backed <a href="real-time%20clock">real-time clock</a> (RTC). However, the RAM is pseudo-fast RAM, only accessible by the processor, but still as slow as chip RAM. The motherboard can be modified to relocate the trap-door RAM to the chip memory pool, provided a compatible <a href="MOS%20Technology%20Agnus">Agnus</a> chip is fitted on the motherboard.

Amiga 1000

The Commodore Amiga 1000, also known as the A1000 and originally simply as the Amiga, is the first <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a> released by <a href="Commodore%20International">Commodore International</a> in the <a href="Amiga">Amiga</a> line. It combines the 16/32-bit <a href="Motorola%2068000">Motorola 68000</a> <a href="central%20processing%20unit">CPU</a> which was powerful by 1985 standards with one of the most advanced graphics and sound systems in its class, and runs a <a href="preemptive%20multitasking">preemptive multitasking</a> <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> that fits into of read-only memory and shipped with 256 KB of RAM. The <a href="Computer%20data%20storage%23Primary%20storage">primary memory</a> can be expanded internally with a manufacturer supplied 256 KB module for a total of 512 KB of RAM. Using the external slot the primary memory can be expanded up to 

The A1000 has a number of characteristics that distinguish it from later Amiga models: It is the only model to feature the short-lived Amiga check-mark logo on its case, the majority of the case is elevated slightly to give a storage area for the keyboard when not in use (a "keyboard garage"), and the inside of the case is engraved with the signatures of the Amiga designers (similar to the <a href="Macintosh%20128K">Macintosh</a>); including <a href="Jay%20Miner">Jay Miner</a> and the paw print of his dog Mitchy. The A1000's case was designed by <a href="Howard%20Stolz">Howard Stolz</a>. As Senior Industrial Designer at Commodore, Stolz was the mechanical lead and primary interface with <a href="Sanyo">Sanyo</a> in Japan, the contract manufacturer for the A1000 casing.

The Amiga 1000 was manufactured in two variations: One uses the <a href="NTSC">NTSC</a> television standard and the other uses the <a href="PAL">PAL</a> television standard. The NTSC variant was the initial model manufactured and sold in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. The later PAL model was manufactured in Germany and sold in countries using the PAL television standard. The first NTSC systems lacks the <a href="Amiga%20Halfbrite%20mode">EHB video mode</a> which is present in all later Amiga models.

Because <a href="AmigaOS">AmigaOS</a> was rather <a href="Software%20bug">buggy</a> at the time of the A1000's release, the OS was not placed in ROM then. Instead, the A1000 includes a <a href="daughterboard">daughterboard</a> with 256 <a href="kilobyte">KB</a> of RAM, dubbed the "writable control store" (WCS), into which the core of the operating system is loaded from floppy disk (this portion of the operating system is known as the "<a href="Kickstart%20%28Amiga%29">Kickstart</a>"). The WCS is write-protected after loading, and system resets do not require a reload of the WCS. In Europe, the WCS was often referred to as WOM (Write Once Memory), a play on the more conventional term "ROM" (<a href="read-only%20memory">read-only memory</a>).

The preproduction Amiga (which was codenamed "Velvet") released to developers in early 1985 contained of RAM with an option to expand it to Commodore later increased the system memory to due to objections by the Amiga development team. The names of the custom chips were different; Denise and Paula were called Daphne and Portia respectively. The casing of the preproduction Amiga was almost identical to the production version: the main difference being an embossed Commodore logo in the top left corner. It did not have the developer signatures or the carry handle.

The Amiga 1000 has a <a href="Motorola%2068000">Motorola 68000</a> CPU running at 7.15909 <a href="Hertz">MHz</a> (on <a href="NTSC">NTSC</a> systems) or 7.09379 MHz (<a href="PAL">PAL</a> systems), precisely double the video color <a href="carrier%20frequency">carrier frequency</a> for NTSC or 1.6 times the color carrier frequency for PAL. The system clock timings are derived from the video frequency, which simplifies <a href="glue%20logic">glue logic</a> and allows the Amiga 1000 to make do with a single <a href="crystal%20oscillator">crystal</a>. In keeping with its video game heritage, the chipset was designed to synchronize CPU memory access and chipset <a href="direct%20memory%20access">DMA</a> so the hardware runs in real time without wait-state delays.

Though most units were sold with an analog <a href="RGB%20color%20model">RGB</a> monitor, the A1000 also has a built-in <a href="composite%20video">composite video</a> output which allows the computer to be connected directly to some monitors other than their standard RGB monitor. The A1000 also has a "TV MOD" output, into which an RF Modulator can be plugged, allowing connection to a TV that was old enough not to even have a composite video input.

The original 68000 CPU can be directly replaced with a <a href="Motorola%2068010">Motorola 68010</a>, which can execute instructions slightly faster than the 68000 but also introduces a small degree of software incompatibility. Third-party CPU upgrades, which mostly fit in the CPU socket, use faster successors 68020/68881 or 68030/68882 microprocessors and integrated memory. Such upgrades often have the option to revert to 68000 mode for full compatibility. Some boards have a socket to seat the original 68000, whereas the 68030 cards typically come with an on-board 68000.

The original Amiga 1000 is the only model to have 256 <a href="kilobyte">KB</a> of <a href="Amiga%20Chip%20RAM">Amiga Chip RAM</a>, which can be expanded to 512 KB with the addition of a <a href="daughterboard">daughterboard</a> under a cover in the center front of the machine. RAM may also be upgraded via official and third-party upgrades, with a practical upper limit of about 9 <a href="Megabyte">MB</a> of "fast RAM" due to the 68000's 24-bit <a href="address%20bus">address bus</a>. This memory is accessible only by the CPU permitting faster code execution as DMA cycles are not shared with the chipset.

The Amiga 1000 features an 86-pin expansion port (electrically identical to the later <a href="Amiga%20500">Amiga 500</a> expansion port, though the A500's connector is inverted). This port is used by third-party expansions such as memory upgrades and <a href="SCSI">SCSI</a> adapters. These resources are handled by the Amiga <a href="Autoconfig">Autoconfig</a> standard. Other expansion options are available including a bus expander which provides two <a href="Amiga%20Zorro%20II">Zorro-II</a> slots.

Introduced on July 23, 1985 during a star-studded gala featuring <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> and <a href="Debbie%20Harry">Debbie Harry</a> held at the <a href="Vivian%20Beaumont%20Theater">Vivian Beaumont Theater</a> at <a href="Lincoln%20Center">Lincoln Center</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, machines began shipping in September with a base configuration of 256 KB of RAM at the retail price of . A analog <a href="Computer%20monitor">RGB monitor</a> was available for around , bringing the price of a complete Amiga system to 1,595 USD. Before the release of the <a href="Amiga%20500">Amiga 500</a> and <a href="Amiga%202000">Amiga 2000</a> models in 1987, the A1000 was simply called "Amiga".

In the US, the A1000 was marketed as "The Amiga from Commodore", with the Commodore logo omitted from the case. The Commodore branding was retained for the international versions. 

Additionally, the Amiga 1000 was sold exclusively in computer stores in the US rather than the various non computer-dedicated department and toy stores through which the <a href="Commodore%20VIC-20">VIC-20</a> and <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a> were retailed. These measures were an effort to avoid Commodore's "toy-store" computer image created during the <a href="Jack%20Tramiel">Tramiel</a> era. 

Along with the operating system, the machine came bundled with a version of <a href="AmigaBASIC">AmigaBASIC</a> developed by <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> and a <a href="speech%20synthesis">speech synthesis</a> library developed by <a href="Softvoice%2C%20Inc">Softvoice, Inc</a>.

Many A1000 owners remained attached to their machines long after newer models rendered the units technically obsolete, and it attracted numerous aftermarket upgrades. Many CPU upgrades that plugged into the Motorola 68000 socket functioned in the A1000. Additionally, a line of products called the "Rejuvenator" series allowed the use of newer chipsets in the A1000, and an <a href="Australia">Australia</a>n-designed replacement A1000 motherboard called "The Phoenix" utilized the same chipset as the A3000 and added an A2000-compatible video slot and on-board <a href="SCSI">SCSI</a> controller.

In 1994, as Commodore filed for bankruptcy, "<a href="Byte%20%28magazine%29">Byte</a>" magazine called the Amiga 1000 "the first <a href="multimedia%20computer">multimedia computer</a>... so far ahead of its time that almost nobody—including Commodore's marketing department—could fully articulate what it was all about".

In 2006, <a href="PC%20World%20%28magazine%29">PC World</a> rated the Amiga 1000 as the 7th greatest PC of all time. In 2007, it was rated by the same magazine as the 37th best tech product of all time.

Asymptote

In <a href="analytic%20geometry">analytic geometry</a>, an asymptote () of a <a href="curve">curve</a> is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as one or both of the "x" or "y" coordinates <a href="Limit%20of%20a%20function%23Limits%20at%20infinity">tends to infinity</a>. Some sources include the requirement that the curve may not cross the line infinitely often, but this is unusual for modern authors. In some contexts, such as <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a>, an asymptote is defined as a line which is <a href="tangent">tangent</a> to a curve at infinity.

The word asymptote is derived from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> ἀσύμπτωτος ("asumptōtos") which means "not falling together", from ἀ <a href="Privative%20alpha">priv.</a> + σύν "together" + πτωτ-ός "fallen". The term was introduced by <a href="Apollonius%20of%20Perga">Apollonius of Perga</a> in his work on <a href="conic%20sections">conic sections</a>, but in contrast to its modern meaning, he used it to mean any line that does not intersect the given curve.

There are three kinds of asymptotes: "horizontal", "vertical" and "oblique" asymptotes. For curves given by the graph of a function , horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as "x" tends to Vertical asymptotes are vertical lines near which the function grows without bound. An oblique asymptote has a slope that is non-zero but finite, such that the graph of the function approaches it as "x" tends to 

More generally, one curve is a "curvilinear asymptote" of another (as opposed to a "linear asymptote") if the distance between the two curves tends to zero as they tend to infinity, although the term "asymptote" by itself is usually reserved for linear asymptotes.

Asymptotes convey information about the behavior of curves "in the large", and determining the asymptotes of a function is an important step in sketching its graph. The study of asymptotes of functions, construed in a broad sense, forms a part of the subject of <a href="asymptotic%20analysis">asymptotic analysis</a>.

The idea that a curve may come arbitrarily close to a line without actually becoming the same may seem to counter everyday experience. The representations of a line and a curve as marks on a piece of paper or as pixels on a computer screen have a positive width. So if they were to be extended far enough they would seem to merge, at least as far as the eye could discern. But these are physical representations of the corresponding mathematical entities; the line and the curve are idealized concepts whose width is 0 (see <a href="Line%20%28geometry%29">Line</a>). Therefore, the understanding of the idea of an asymptote requires an effort of reason rather than experience.

Consider the graph of the function formula_1 shown to the right. The coordinates of the points on the curve are of the form formula_2 where x is a number other than 0. For example, the graph contains the points (1, 1), (2, 0.5), (5, 0.2), (10, 0.1), … As the values of formula_3 become larger and larger, say 100, 1000, 10,000 …, putting them far to the right of the illustration, the corresponding values of formula_4, .01, .001, .0001, …, become infinitesimal relative to the scale shown. But no matter how large formula_3 becomes, its reciprocal formula_6 is never 0, so the curve never actually touches the "x"-axis. Similarly, as the values of formula_3 become smaller and smaller, say .01, .001, .0001, …, making them infinitesimal relative to the scale shown, the corresponding values of formula_4, 100, 1000, 10,000 …, become larger and larger. So the curve extends farther and farther upward as it comes closer and closer to the "y"-axis. Thus, both the "x" and "y"-axes are asymptotes of the curve. These ideas are part of the basis of concept of a <a href="Limit%20of%20a%20function">limit</a> in mathematics, and this connection is explained more fully below.

The asymptotes most commonly encountered in the study of <a href="calculus">calculus</a> are of curves of the form . These can be computed using <a href="limit%20%28mathematics%29">limits</a> and classified into "horizontal", "vertical" and "oblique" asymptotes depending on their orientation. Horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as "x" tends to +∞ or −∞. As the name indicates they are parallel to the "x"-axis. Vertical asymptotes are vertical lines (perpendicular to the "x"-axis) near which the function grows without bound. Oblique asymptotes are diagonal lines such that the difference between the curve and the line approaches 0 as "x" tends to +∞ or −∞. More general types of asymptotes can be defined in this case. Only open curves that have some infinite branch can have an asymptote. No closed curve can have an asymptote.

The line "x" = "a" is a "vertical asymptote" of the graph of the function if at least one of the following statements is true:


where formula_11 is the limit as "x" approaches the value "a" from the left (from lesser values), and formula_12 is the limit as "x" approaches "a" from the right.

For example, if ƒ("x") = "x"/("x"–1), the numerator approaches 1 and the denominator approaches 0 as "x" approaches 1. So
and the curve has a vertical asymptote "x"=1. 

The function "ƒ"("x") may or may not be defined at "a", and its precise value at the point "x" = "a" does not affect the asymptote. For example, for the function

has a limit of +∞ as , "ƒ"("x") has the vertical asymptote , even though "ƒ"(0) = 5. The graph of this function does intersect the vertical asymptote once, at (0,5). It is impossible for the graph of a function to intersect a vertical asymptote (or <a href="vertical%20line%20test">a vertical line in general</a>) in more than one point. Moreover, if a function is <a href="continuous%20function">continuous</a> at each point where it is defined, it is impossible that its graph does intersect any vertical asymptote.

A common example of a vertical asymptote is the case of a rational function at a point x such that the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero.

"Horizontal asymptotes" are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as . The horizontal line "y" = "c" is a horizontal asymptote of the function "y" = "ƒ"("x") if
In the first case, "ƒ"("x") has "y" = "c" as asymptote when "x" tends to −∞, and in the second "ƒ"("x") has "y" = "c" as an asymptote as "x" tends to +∞

For example, the arctangent function satisfies

So the line is a horizontal tangent for the arctangent when "x" tends to −∞, and is a horizontal tangent for the arctangent when "x" tends to +∞.

Functions may lack horizontal asymptotes on either or both sides, or may have one horizontal asymptote that is the same in both directions. For example, the function has a horizontal asymptote at "y" = 0 when "x" tends both to −∞ and +∞ because, respectively,

When a linear asymptote is not parallel to the "x"- and "y"-axis, it is called an "oblique asymptote" or "slant asymptote". A function "f"("x") is asymptotic to the straight line ("m" ≠ 0) if

In the first case the line is an oblique asymptote of "ƒ"("x") when "x" tends to +∞, and in the second case the line is an oblique asymptote of "ƒ(x)" when "x" tends to −∞.

An example is ƒ("x") = "x" + 1/"x", which has the oblique asymptote "y" = "x" (that is "m" = 1, "n" = 0) as seen in the limits

The asymptotes of many elementary functions can be found without the explicit use of limits (although the derivations of such methods typically use limits).

The oblique asymptote, for the function "f"("x"), will be given by the equation "y"="mx"+"n". The value for "m" is computed first and is given by

where "a" is either formula_25 or formula_26 depending on the case being studied. It is good practice to treat the two cases separately. If this limit doesn't exist then there is no oblique asymptote in that direction.

Having "m" then the value for "n" can be computed by

where "a" should be the same value used before. If this limit fails to exist then there is no oblique asymptote in that direction, even should the limit defining "m" exist. Otherwise is the oblique asymptote of "ƒ"("x") as "x" tends to "a".

For example, the function has

so that is the asymptote of "ƒ"("x") when "x" tends to +∞.

The function has

So does not have an asymptote when "x" tends to +∞.

A <a href="rational%20function">rational function</a> has at most one horizontal asymptote or oblique (slant) asymptote, and possibly many vertical asymptotes.

The <a href="Degree%20of%20a%20polynomial">degree</a> of the numerator and degree of the denominator determine whether or not there are any horizontal or oblique asymptotes. The cases are tabulated below, where deg(numerator) is the degree of the numerator, and deg(denominator) is the degree of the denominator.

The vertical asymptotes occur only when the denominator is zero (If both the numerator and denominator are zero, the multiplicities of the zero are compared). For example, the following function has vertical asymptotes at "x" = 0, and "x" = 1, but not at "x" = 2.

When the numerator of a rational function has degree exactly one greater than the denominator, the function has an oblique (slant) asymptote. The asymptote is the polynomial term after <a href="Polynomial%20long%20division">dividing</a> the numerator and denominator. This phenomenon occurs because when dividing the fraction, there will be a linear term, and a remainder. For example, consider the function
shown to the right. As the value of "x" increases, "f" approaches the asymptote "y" = "x". This is because the other term, 1/("x"+1), approaches 0.

If the degree of the numerator is more than 1 larger than the degree of the denominator, and the denominator does not divide the numerator, there will be a nonzero remainder that goes to zero as "x" increases, but the quotient will not be linear, and the function does not have an oblique asymptote.

If a known function has an asymptote (such as "y"=0 for "f"(x)="e"), then the translations of it also have an asymptote.

If a known function has an asymptote, then the <a href="Homothetic%20transformation">scaling</a> of the function also have an asymptote.

For example, "f"("x")="e"+2 has horizontal asymptote "y"=0+2=2, and no vertical or oblique asymptotes.

Let be a <a href="parametric%20curve">parametric</a> plane curve, in coordinates "A"("t") = ("x"("t"),"y"("t")). Suppose that the curve tends to infinity, that is:
A line ℓ is an asymptote of "A" if the distance from the point "A"("t") to ℓ tends to zero as "t" → "b".

For example, the upper right branch of the curve "y" = 1/"x" can be defined parametrically as "x" = "t", "y" = 1/"t" (where "t" > 0). First, "x" → ∞ as "t" → ∞ and the distance from the curve to the "x"-axis is 1/"t" which approaches 0 as "t" → ∞. Therefore, the "x"-axis is an asymptote of the curve. Also, "y" → ∞ as "t" → 0 from the right, and the distance between the curve and the "y"-axis is "t" which approaches 0 as "t" → 0. So the "y"-axis is also an asymptote. A similar argument shows that the lower left branch of the curve also has the same two lines as asymptotes.

Although the definition here uses a parameterization of the curve, the notion of asymptote does not depend on the parameterization. In fact, if the equation of the line is formula_35 then the distance from the point "A"("t") = ("x"("t"),"y"("t")) to the line is given by
if γ("t") is a change of parameterization then the distance becomes
which tends to zero simultaneously as the previous expression.

An important case is when the curve is the <a href="Graph%20of%20a%20function">graph</a> of a <a href="real%20function">real function</a> (a function of one real variable and returning real values). The graph of the function "y" = "ƒ"("x") is the set of points of the plane with coordinates ("x","ƒ"("x")). For this, a parameterization is
This parameterization is to be considered over the open intervals ("a","b"), where "a" can be −∞ and "b" can be +∞.

An asymptote can be either vertical or non-vertical (oblique or horizontal). In the first case its equation is "x" = "c", for some real number "c". The non-vertical case has equation , where "m" and formula_39 are real numbers. All three types of asymptotes can be present at the same time in specific examples. Unlike asymptotes for curves that are graphs of functions, a general curve may have more than two non-vertical asymptotes, and may cross its vertical asymptotes more than once.

Let be a parametric plane curve, in coordinates "A"("t") = ("x"("t"),"y"("t")), and "B" be another (unparameterized) curve. Suppose, as before, that the curve "A" tends to infinity. The curve "B" is a curvilinear asymptote of "A" if the shortest distance from the point "A"("t") to a point on "B" tends to zero as "t" → "b". Sometimes "B" is simply referred to as an asymptote of "A", when there is no risk of confusion with linear asymptotes.

For example, the function
has a curvilinear asymptote , which is known as a "parabolic asymptote" because it is a <a href="parabola">parabola</a> rather than a straight line.

Asymptotes are used in procedures of <a href="curve%20sketching">curve sketching</a>. An asymptote serves as a guide line to show the behavior of the curve towards infinity. In order to get better approximations of the curve, curvilinear asymptotes have also been used although the term <a href="asymptotic%20curve">asymptotic curve</a> seems to be preferred.

The asymptotes of an <a href="algebraic%20curve">algebraic curve</a> in the <a href="affine%20space">affine plane</a> are the lines that are tangent to the <a href="algebraic%20curve%23Projective%20curves">projectivized curve</a> through a <a href="point%20at%20infinity">point at infinity</a>. For example, one may identify the <a href="unit%20hyperbola%23Asymptotes">asymptotes to the unit hyperbola</a> in this manner. Asymptotes are often considered only for real curves, although they also make sense when defined in this way for curves over an arbitrary <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">field</a>.

A plane curve of degree "n" intersects its asymptote at most at "n"−2 other points, by <a href="B%C3%A9zout%27s%20theorem">Bézout's theorem</a>, as the intersection at infinity is of multiplicity at least two. For a <a href="conic">conic</a>, there are a pair of lines that do not intersect the conic at any complex point: these are the two asymptotes of the conic.

A plane algebraic curve is defined by an equation of the form "P"("x","y") = 0 where "P" is a polynomial of degree "n"
where "P" is <a href="homogeneous%20polynomial">homogeneous</a> of degree "k". Vanishing of the linear factors of the highest degree term "P" defines the asymptotes of the curve: setting , if , then the line
is an asymptote if formula_43 and formula_44 are not both zero. If formula_45 and formula_46, there is no asymptote, but the curve has a branch that looks like a branch of parabola. Such a branch is called a , even when it does not have any parabola that is a curvilinear asymptote. If formula_47 the curve has a singular point at infinity which may have several asymptotes or parabolic branches.

Over the complex numbers, "P" splits into linear factors, each of which defines an asymptote (or several for multiple factors). 0ver the reals, "P" splits in factors that are linear or quadratic factors. Only the linear factors correspond to infinite (real) branches of the curve, but if a linear factor has multiplicity greater than one, the curve may have several asymptotes or parabolic branches. It may also occur that such a multiple linear factor corresponds to two complex conjugate branches, and does not corresponds to any infinite branch of the real curve. For example, the curve has no real points outside the square formula_48, but its highest order term gives the linear factor "x" with multiplicity 4, leading to the unique asymptote "x"=0.

The hyperbola
has the two asymptotes
The equation for the union of these two lines is
Similarly, the <a href="hyperboloid">hyperboloid</a>
is said to have the asymptotic cone

The distance between the hyperboloid and cone approaches 0 as the distance from the origin approaches infinity.
More generally, let us consider a surface that has an implicit equation
formula_54
where the formula_55 are <a href="homogeneous%20polynomial">homogeneous polynomial</a>s of degree formula_56 and formula_57. Then the equation formula_58 defines a <a href="cone">cone</a> which is centered at the origin. It is called an asymptotic cone, because the distance to the cone of a point of the surface tends to zero when the point on the surface tends to infinity.

He regards his teaching job as his most important work. Since 2004 he has operated <a href="Electoral-vote.com">Electoral-vote.com</a>, a <a href="website">website</a> dedicated to analysis of polling data in <a href="federal%20elections%20in%20the%20United%20States">federal elections in the United States</a>.

Tanenbaum, was born in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and grew up in suburban <a href="White%20Plains%2C%20New%20York">White Plains, New York</a>. He is <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a>. His paternal grandfather was born in <a href="Khorostkiv">Khorostkiv</a> in the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20empire">Austro-Hungarian empire</a>.

He received his <a href="bachelor%20of%20Science">bachelor of Science</a> degree in <a href="Physics">Physics</a> from <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">MIT</a> in 1965 and his Ph.D. degree in astrophysics from the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> in 1971. Tanenbaum also served as a lobbyist for the <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a>.

He moved to the Netherlands to live with his wife, who is Dutch, but he retains his <a href="Citizenship%20in%20the%20United%20States">United States citizenship</a>. He teaches courses about Computer Organization and Operating Systems and supervises the work of <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy%23PhD%20candidacy">Ph.D. candidate</a>s at the <a href="VU%20University%20Amsterdam">VU University Amsterdam</a>. On , he announced his retirement.

Tanenbaum is well recognized for his textbooks on computer science. They include:

His book, "Operating Systems: Design and Implementation" and <a href="MINIX">MINIX</a> were <a href="Linus%20Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>' inspiration for the <a href="Linux">Linux</a> kernel. In his autobiography "<a href="Just%20for%20Fun">Just for Fun</a>", Torvalds describes it as "the book that launched me to new heights".

His books have been translated into many languages including Arabic, Basque, Bulgarian, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Macedonian, Mexican Spanish, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, and Spanish. They have appeared in over 175 editions and are used at universities around the world.

Tanenbaum has had a number of <a href="Ph.D.">Ph.D.</a> students who themselves have gone on to become widely known computer science researchers.
These include:

In the early 1990s, the Dutch government began setting up a number of thematically oriented research schools that spanned multiple universities. These schools were intended to bring professors and Ph.D. students from different Dutch (and later, foreign) universities together to help them cooperate and enhance their research.

Tanenbaum was one of the cofounders and first Dean of the Advanced School for Computing and Imaging (ASCI). This school initially consisted of nearly 200 faculty members and Ph.D. students from the <a href="Vrije%20Universiteit">Vrije Universiteit</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Amsterdam">University of Amsterdam</a>, <a href="Delft%20University%20of%20Technology">Delft University of Technology</a>, and <a href="Leiden%20University">Leiden University</a>. They were especially working on problems in advanced computer systems such as parallel computing and image analysis and processing.

Tanenbaum remained dean for 12 years, until 2005, when he was awarded an Academy Professorship by the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>, at which time he became a full-time research professor. ASCI has since grown to include researchers from nearly a dozen universities in The Netherlands, Belgium, and France. ASCI offers Ph.D. level courses, has an annual conference, and runs various workshops every year.

The <a href="Amsterdam%20Compiler%20Kit">Amsterdam Compiler Kit</a> is a toolkit for producing portable compilers. It was started sometime before 1981 and Andrew Tanenbaum was the architect from the start until version 5.5.

In 1987, Tanenbaum wrote a clone of <a href="UNIX">UNIX</a>, called <a href="MINIX">MINIX</a> (MINi-unIX), for the <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a>. It was targeted at students and others who wanted to learn how an operating system worked. Consequently, he wrote a book that listed the source code in an appendix and described it in detail in the text. The source code itself was available on a set of floppy disks. Within three months, a <a href="Usenet">Usenet</a> newsgroup, comp.os.minix, had sprung up with over 40,000 subscribers discussing and improving the system. One of these subscribers was a Finnish student named <a href="Linus%20Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> who began adding new features to MINIX and tailoring it to his own needs. On October 5, 1991, Torvalds announced his own (<a href="POSIX">POSIX</a> like) kernel, called <a href="Linux">Linux</a>, which originally used the MINIX file system, but it is not based on MINIX code.

Although MINIX and Linux have diverged, MINIX continues to be developed, now as a production system as well as an educational one. The focus is on building a highly modular, reliable, and secure, operating system. The system is based on a <a href="microkernel">microkernel</a>, with only 5000 lines of code running in kernel mode. The rest of the operating system runs as a number of independent processes in user mode, including processes for the file system, process manager, and each device driver. The system continuously monitors each of these processes, and when a failure is detected is often capable of automatically replacing the failed process without a reboot, without disturbing running programs, and without the user even noticing. <a href="MINIX%203">MINIX 3</a>, as the current version is called, is available under the <a href="BSD%20license">BSD license</a> for free.

Tanenbaum has also been involved in numerous other research projects in the areas of operating systems, distributed systems, and ubiquitous computing, often as supervisor of Ph.D. students or a <a href="postdoctoral%20researcher">postdoctoral researcher</a>. These projects include:

In 2004, Tanenbaum created <a href="Electoral-vote.com">Electoral-vote.com</a>, a web site analyzing <a href="opinion%20polls">opinion polls</a> for the <a href="2004%20U.S.%20Presidential%20Election">2004 U.S. Presidential Election</a>, using them to project the outcome in the <a href="U.S.%20Electoral%20College">Electoral College</a>. He stated that he created the site as an American who "knows first hand what the world thinks of America and it is not a pretty picture at the moment. I want people to think of America as the land of freedom and democracy, not the land of arrogance and blind revenge. I want to be proud of America again." The site provided a color-coded map, updated each day with projections for each state's electoral votes. Through most of the campaign period Tanenbaum kept his identity secret, referring to himself as "the Votemaster" and acknowledging only that he personally preferred <a href="John%20Kerry">John Kerry</a>. A <a href="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> who supports the <a href="United%20States%20Democratic%20Party">Democrats</a>, he revealed his identity on November 1, 2004, the day before the election, also stating his reasons and qualifications for running the website.

Through the site he also covered the <a href="United%20States%20general%20elections%2C%202006">2006 midterm elections</a>, correctly predicting the winner of all 33 Senate races that year.

For the 2008 elections, he got every state right except for Indiana, which he said McCain would win by 2% (Obama won by 1%) and Missouri, which he said was too close to call (McCain won by 0.1%). He correctly predicted all the winners in the Senate except for Minnesota, where he predicted a 1% win by <a href="Norm%20Coleman">Norm Coleman</a> over <a href="Al%20Franken">Al Franken</a>. After 7 months of legal battling and recounts, Franken won by 312 votes (0.01%).

In 2010, he correctly projected 35 out of 37 Senate races in the Midterm elections on the website. The exceptions were <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a> and <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>.

The <a href="Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds%20debate">Tanenbaum–Torvalds debate</a> was a famous debate between Tanenbaum and Linus Torvalds regarding kernel design on <a href="Usenet">Usenet</a> in 1992.



Tanenbaum has been keynote speaker at numerous conferences, most recently

Ariane 5 has been refined since the first launch in successive versions, "G", "G+", "GS", "ECA", and most recently, "ES". ESA originally designed Ariane 5 to launch the <a href="Hermes%20%28shuttle%29">Hermes</a> spaceplane, and thus intended it to be <a href="Human-rating%20certification">human rated</a> from the beginning.

Two satellites can be mounted using a SYLDA carrier ("SYstème de Lancement Double Ariane"). Three main satellites are possible depending on size using SPELTRA ("Structure Porteuse Externe Lancement TRiple Ariane"). Up to eight secondary payloads, usually small experiment packages or <a href="miniaturized%20satellite">minisatellites</a>, can be carried with an ASAP ("Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads") platform.

On 28 June 2017, Ariane 5 performed its 80th consecutive successful mission since 2003.

Ariane 5’s <a href="Cryogenics">cryogenic</a> H173 main stage (H158 for Ariane 5 G, G+, and GS) is called the EPC ("Étage Principal Cryotechnique"—Cryotechnic Main Stage). It consists of a large tank 30.5 metres high with two compartments, one for <a href="liquid%20oxygen">liquid oxygen</a> and one for <a href="liquid%20hydrogen">liquid hydrogen</a>, and a <a href="Vulcain">Vulcain 2</a> engine at the base with a vacuum thrust of . The H173 EPC weighs about 189 tonnes, including 175 tonnes of propellant. After the main cryogenic stage runs out of fuel, it can re-enter the atmosphere for an ocean splashdown.

Attached to the sides are two P241 (P238 for Ariane 5 G and G+) <a href="solid%20rocket%20booster">solid rocket booster</a>s (SRBs or EAPs from the French "Étages d’Accélération à Poudre"), each weighing about 277 tonnes full and delivering a thrust of about . They are fueled by a mix of ammonium perchlorate (68%) and aluminum fuel (18%) and <a href="HTPB">HTPB</a> (14%). They each burn for 130 seconds before being dropped into the ocean. The SRBs are usually allowed to sink to the bottom of the ocean, but like the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Solid%20Rocket%20Booster">Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster</a>s they can be recovered with parachutes, and this has occasionally been done for post-flight analysis. (Unlike Space Shuttle SRBs Ariane 5 boosters are not reused.) The most recent attempt was for the first Ariane 5 ECA mission. One of the two boosters was successfully recovered and returned to the Guiana Space Center for analysis. Prior to that mission, the last such recovery and testing was done in 2003.

The French <a href="M51%20%28missile%29">M51</a> <a href="SLBM">SLBM</a> shares a substantial amount of technology with these boosters.

In February 2000 the suspected <a href="nose%20cone">nose cone</a> of an Ariane 5 booster washed ashore on the <a href="South%20Texas">South Texas</a> coast, and was recovered by <a href="Beachcombing">beachcombers</a> before the government could get to it.

The second stage is on top of the main stage and below the payload. The Ariane 5 G used the EPS ("Étage à Propergols Stockables"—Storable Propellant Stage), which is fueled by <a href="monomethylhydrazine">monomethylhydrazine</a> (MMH) and <a href="nitrogen%20tetroxide">nitrogen tetroxide</a>. It also has 10 tonnes of storable propellants. The EPS was improved for use on the Ariane 5 G+, GS, and ES. Ariane 5 ECA uses the ESC ("Étage Supérieur Cryotechnique"—Cryogenic Upper Stage), which is fueled by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.

The EPS upper stage is capable of multiple ignitions, first demonstrated during flight V26 which was launched on 5 October 2007. This was purely to test the engine, and occurred after the payloads had been deployed. The first operational use of restart capability as part of a mission came on 9 March 2008, when two burns were made to deploy the first <a href="Automated%20Transfer%20Vehicle">Automated Transfer Vehicle</a> into a circular parking orbit, followed by a third burn after ATV deployment to de-orbit the stage. This procedure was repeated for all subsequent ATV flights.

The payload and all upper stages are covered at launch by a fairing, which is jettisoned once sufficient altitude has been reached (typically above 100 km). The Fairing is also used for aerodynamic stability and protection from heating during supersonic flight and acoustic loads.

, the Ariane 5 commercial launch <a href="Price%23Confusion%20between%20prices%20and%20costs%20of%20production">price</a> for launching a "midsize satellite in the lower position" is approximately , competing for commercial launches in an increasingly <a href="Space%20launch%20market%20competition">competitive market</a>, mainly due to <a href="SpaceX">SpaceX</a>.

The heavier satellite launched in the upper position on a typical dual-satellite Ariane 5 launch is priced higher, on the order of .

Total launch price of an Ariane 5—which can transport up to two satellites to space, one in the "upper" and one in the "lower" positions—is around 150 million <a href="Euro">Euro</a> as of January 2015.

The Ariane 5 ME (Mid-life Evolution) was in development until 2015 and seen as a stopgap between / and the new Ariane 6. With first flight planned for 2018, it would have become ESA's principal launcher until the arrival of the new Ariane 6 version.

The Ariane 5 ME uses a new upper stage, with increased propellant volume, powered by the new <a href="Vinci%20%28rocket%20engine%29">Vinci engine</a>. Unlike the HM-7B engine, it can restart several times, allowing for complex orbital maneuvers such as insertion of two satellites into different orbits, direct insertion into geosynchronous orbit, planetary exploration missions, and guaranteed upper stage deorbiting or insertion into graveyard orbit.

The new launcher also includes a lengthened fairing up to 20m and a new dual launch system to accommodate larger satellites. Compared to an Ariane 5 ECA model, the payload to GTO increases by 15% to 11.5 tonnes and the cost-per-kilogram of each launch is projected to decline by 20%.

Originally known as the Ariane 5 ECB, was to have its first flight in 2006. However, the failure of the first ECA flight in 2002, combined with a deteriorating satellite industry, caused ESA to cancel development in 2003. Development of the Vinci engine continued, though at a lower pace. The ESA Council of Ministers agreed to fund development of the new upper stage in November 2008.
In 2009, <a href="EADS%20Astrium">EADS Astrium</a> was awarded a €200 million contract, and on April 10, 2012 received another €112 million contract to continue development of the Ariane 5 ME with total development effort expected to cost €1 billion.

On 21 November 2012, ESA agreed to continue with the Ariane 5 ME to meet the challenge of lower priced competitors. It was agreed the Vinci upper stage would also be used as the second stage of a new Ariane 6, and further commonality would be sought. Ariane 5 ME qualification flight is scheduled for mid-2018, followed by gradual introduction into service.

On 2 December 2014, ESA decided to stop funding the development of Ariane 5 ME and instead focus on Ariane 6 which should have a lower cost per launch and allow more flexibility in the payloads (using two or four P120C solid boosters depending on total payload mass).

Work on the Ariane 5 EAP motors have been continued in the <a href="Vega%20%28launcher%29">Vega</a> programme. The Vega 1st stage engine—the <a href="P80%20%28stage%29">P80</a> engine—is a shorter derivation of the EAP. The P80 booster casing is made of filament wound graphite epoxy, much lighter than the current stainless steel casing. A new composite steerable nozzle has been developed while new thermal insulation material and a narrower throat improve the expansion ratio and subsequently the overall performance. Additionally, the nozzle now has electromechanical actuators which have replaced the heavier hydraulic ones used for thrust vector control.

These developments will probably later make their way back into the Ariane programme. The incorporation of the ESC-B with the improvements to the solid motor casing and an uprated Vulcain engine would deliver to LEO. This would be developed for any lunar missions but the performance of such a design may not be possible if the higher <a href="Max%20Q">Max-Q</a> for the launch of this rocket poses a constraint on the mass delivered to orbit.

The design brief of the next generation rocket called for a lower-cost and smaller rocket capable of launching a single satellite of up to 6.5 tonnes to GTO. However, after several permutations the finalized design was nearly identical in performance to the Ariane 5, focusing instead on lowering fabrication costs and launch prices.

<a href="New%20product%20development">Development</a> is projected to cost €4 billion. Its first test launch is set for 2021. , Ariane 6 is projected to be launched for about €70 million per flight or about half of the Ariane 5 current price.

Ariane 5's first test flight (<a href="Ariane%205%20Flight%20501">Ariane 5 Flight 501</a>) on 4 June 1996 failed, with the rocket self-destructing 37 seconds after launch because of a malfunction in the control software. A data conversion from 64-<a href="bit">bit</a> <a href="floating%20point">floating point</a> value to 16-bit <a href="Signedness">signed</a> <a href="integer">integer</a> value to be stored in a variable representing horizontal bias caused a processor trap (operand error) because the floating point value was too large to be represented by a 16-bit signed integer. The software was originally written for the Ariane 4 where efficiency considerations (the computer running the software had an 80% maximum workload requirement) led to four variables being protected with a <a href="Exception%20handling">handler</a> while three others, including the horizontal bias variable, were left unprotected because it was thought that they were "physically limited or that there was a large margin of error". The software, written in <a href="Ada%20%28programming%20language%29">Ada</a>, was included in the Ariane 5 through the reuse of an entire Ariane 4 subsystem despite the fact that the particular software containing the bug, which was just a part of the subsystem, was not required by the Ariane 5 because it has a different preparation sequence than the Ariane 4.

The second test flight (L502, on 30 October 1997) was a partial failure. The Vulcain nozzle caused a roll problem, leading to premature shutdown of the core stage. The upper stage operated successfully, but it could not reach the intended orbit.

A subsequent test flight (L503, on 21 October 1998) proved successful and the first commercial launch (L504) occurred on 10 December 1999 with the launch of the <a href="XMM-Newton">XMM-Newton</a> X-ray observatory satellite.

Another partial failure occurred on 12 July 2001, with the delivery of two satellites into an incorrect orbit, at only half the height of the intended GTO. The ESA <a href="Artemis%20%28satellite%29">Artemis</a> <a href="telecommunications%20satellite">telecommunications satellite</a> was able to reach its intended orbit on 31 January 2003, through the use of its experimental <a href="ion%20propulsion">ion propulsion</a> system.

The next launch did not occur until 1 March 2002, when the <a href="Envisat">Envisat</a> <a href="environmental%20satellite">environmental satellite</a> successfully reached an orbit above the Earth in the 11th launch. At , it was the heaviest single payload until the launch of the <a href="Jules%20Verne%20ATV">first ATV</a> on 9 March 2008 (19,360 kg).

The first launch of the ECA variant on 11 December 2002 ended in failure when a main booster problem caused the rocket to veer off-course, forcing its self-destruction three minutes into the flight. Its payload of two communications satellites (Stentor and <a href="Hot%20Bird">Hot Bird</a> 7), valued at about EUR 630 million, was lost in the ocean. The fault was determined to have been caused by a leak in coolant pipes allowing the nozzle to overheat. After this failure, Arianespace SA delayed the expected January 2003 launch for the <a href="Rosetta%20space%20probe">Rosetta</a> mission to 26 February 2004, but this was again delayed to early March 2004 due to a minor fault in the foam that protects the cryogenic tanks on the Ariane 5. As of June 2017, the failure of the first ECA launch was the last failure of an Ariane 5; since then, all subsequent launches have been successful, with 80 consecutive successes that stretch back to 9 April 2003 with the launch of <a href="INSAT-3A">INSAT-3A</a> and <a href="Galaxy%2012">Galaxy 12</a> satellites.

On 27 September 2003 the last Ariane 5 G boosted three satellites (including the first European lunar probe, <a href="SMART-1">SMART-1</a>), in Flight 162. On 18 July 2004 an Ariane 5 G+ boosted what was at the time the heaviest telecommunication satellite ever, <a href="Anik%20%28satellite%29">Anik</a> F2, weighing almost .

The first successful launch of the Ariane 5 ECA took place on 12 February 2005. The payload consisted of the XTAR-EUR military communications satellite, a 'SLOSHSAT' small scientific satellite and a MaqSat B2 payload simulator. The launch had been originally scheduled for October 2004, but additional testing and the military requiring a launch at that time (of a <a href="Helios%202A">Helios 2A</a> observation satellite) delayed the attempt.

On 11 August 2005, the first Ariane 5 GS (featuring the Ariane 5 ECA's improved solid motors) boosted Thaïcom-4/iPStar-1, the heaviest telecommunications satellite to date at , into orbit.

On 16 November 2005, the third Ariane 5 ECA launch (the second successful ECA launch) took place. It carried a dual payload consisting of <a href="SPACEWAY-2">Spaceway-F2</a> for <a href="DirecTV">DirecTV</a> and Telkom-2 for PT Telekomunikasi of Indonesia. This was the rocket's heaviest dual payload to date, at more than .

On 27 May 2006, an Ariane 5 ECA rocket set a new commercial payload lifting record of 8.2 tonnes. The dual-payload consisted of the <a href="Thaicom%205">Thaicom 5</a> and <a href="Satmex%206">Satmex 6</a> satellites.

On 4 May 2007 the Ariane 5 ECA set another new commercial record, lifting into transfer orbit the <a href="Astra%201L">Astra 1L</a> and Galaxy 17 communication satellites with a combined weight of 8.6 tonnes, and a total payload weight of 9.4 tonnes. This record was again broken by another Ariane 5 ECA, launching the <a href="Skynet%205B">Skynet 5B</a> and <a href="Star%20One%20C1">Star One C1</a> satellites, on 11 November 2007. The total payload weight for this launch was .

On 9 March 2008, the first Ariane 5 ES-ATV was launched to deliver the first <a href="Automated%20Transfer%20Vehicle">ATV</a> called "<a href="Jules%20Verne%20ATV">Jules Verne</a>" to the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a>. The ATV was the heaviest payload ever launched by a European rocket, providing supplies to the space station with necessary propellant, water, air and dry cargo. This was the first operational Ariane mission which involved an engine restart in the upper stage. (The ES-ATV Aestus EPS upper stage was restartable while the ECA HM7-B engine was not.)

On 1 July 2009, an Ariane 5 ECA launched <a href="TerreStar-1">TerreStar-1</a>, the largest commercial telecommunication satellite ever built.

On 28 October 2010, an Ariane 5 ECA launched <a href="Eutelsat">Eutelsat</a>'s <a href="Eutelsat%20W3B">W3B</a> (part of its <a href="W%20Series">W Series</a> of satellites) and <a href="Broadcasting%20Satellite%20System%20Corporation">Broadcasting Satellite System Corporation</a> (B-SAT)'s <a href="BSAT-3b">BSAT-3b</a> satellites into orbit. However, the W3B satellite failed to operate shortly after the successful launch and was written off as a total loss due to an oxidizer leak in the satellite's main propulsion system. The BSAT-3b satellite, however, is operating normally.

On 22 April 2011, the Ariane 5 ECA flight VA-201 broke a commercial record, lifting Yahsat 1A and Intelsat New Dawn with a total payload weight of 10,064 kg to transfer orbit. This record was later broken again during the launch of Ariane 5 ECA flight VA-208 on 2 August 2012, lifting a total of 10,182 kg into the planned geosynchronous transfer orbit, which was broken again 6 months later on flight VA-212 with 10,317 kg sent towards geosynchronous transfer orbit. In June 2016 the GTO record was raised to 10,730 kg, on the first rocket in history that carried a satellite dedicated to financial institutions. The payload record was pushed a further 5 kg to on 24 August with the launch of <a href="Intelsat%2033e">Intelsat 33e</a> and <a href="Intelsat%2036">Intelsat 36</a>. On 1 June 2017, the payload record was broken again to carrying <a href="ViaSat">ViaSat 2</a> and <a href="Eutelsat">Eutelsat 172B</a>.

Ariane 5 rockets have accumulated 94 launches since 1996, 90 of which were successful, yielding a success rate. Between April 2003 and June 2017, Ariane 5 has flown 80 consecutive missions without failure.

 Ariane 5 had 20 missions on its launch manifest. Up to seven launches are planned for the year 2017: six with dual communications satellites due to geosynchronous orbit, and one with 4 <a href="Galileo%20%28satellite%20navigation%29">Galileo</a> satellites. A flight in March 2017 was postponed to May due to transportation to the launch site being restricted by a blockade erected by striking workers.

, Arianespace has launched more than 550 satellites in 254 launches over years (236 Ariane missions minus the first 8 flights handled by <a href="CNES">CNES</a>, 17 Soyuz-2 missions and 9 Vega missions). The first commercial flight managed by the new entity was <a href="Spacenet%20F1">Spacenet F1</a> launched on May 23, 1984. Arianespace uses the <a href="Guiana%20Space%20Center">Guiana Space Center</a> in <a href="French%20Guiana">French Guiana</a> as its main launch site. Through shareholding in <a href="Starsem">Starsem</a>, it can also offer commercial Soyuz launches from the <a href="Baikonur%20spaceport">Baikonur spaceport</a> in Kazakhstan. It has its headquarters in <a href="Courcouronnes">Courcouronnes</a>, <a href="Essonne">Essonne</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, near <a href="%C3%89vry%2C%20Essonne">Évry</a>.

On 21 October 2011 Arianespace <a href="Soyuz%20at%20the%20Guiana%20Space%20Centre%23Inaugural%20flight">launched the first Soyuz rocket</a> ever from outside former <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> territory. The payload was two <a href="Galileo%20%28satellite%20navigation%29">Galileo</a> navigation satellites.

Arianespace primary shareholders are its <a href="Supply%20%28economics%29">suppliers</a>, in various European nations. 
Arianespace currently has 18 shareholders:

Arianespace shareholding has been restructured with the creation of an Airbus Safran Launchers company that will develop and manufacture the <a href="Ariane%206">Ariane 6</a> launcher. Airbus and Safran shareholdings were pooled along with the purchase of the French governments CNES stake to form a partnership company holding just under 74% of Arianespace shares while the remaining 26% is spread across companies in ten countries including further Airbus subsidiaries.


In 2004, Arianespace held more than 50% of the world market for boosting satellites to <a href="geostationary%20transfer%20orbit">geostationary transfer orbit</a> (GTO).

However, the disruptive force represented by the new sector entrant <a href="SpaceX">SpaceX</a> forced Arianespace to cut back on its workforce and focus on cost-cutting to decrease costs to remain competitive against the new low-cost entrant in the launch sector. 

According to an Arianespace managing director, "It's quite clear there's a very significant challenge coming from <a href="SpaceX">SpaceX</a>," he said in 2015. "Therefore things have to change … and the whole European industry is being restructured, consolidated, rationalised and streamlined." 

In the midst of <a href="competition%20%28economics%29">pricing pressure</a> from U.S. company <a href="SpaceX">SpaceX</a>, Arianespace made a November 2013 announcement of pricing flexibility for the "lighter satellites" it carries to <a href="Geostationary%20transfer%20orbit">Geostationary</a> orbits aboard its Ariane 5. 

In early 2014, Arianespace was considering requesting additional subsidies from European governments to face the competition from SpaceX and unfavorable changes in the Euro-Dollar exchange rate. The company had halved subsidy support by €100m per year since 2002 but the fall in the value of the US Dollar meant Arianespace was losing €60m per year due to currency fluctuations on launch contracts. 

Reducing the cost allowed Arianespace to sign four additional contracts in September 2014 for lower slots on a <a href="Ariane%205%20SYLDA">Ariane 5 SYLDA</a> dispenser for the satellites that otherwise could be flown on a SpaceX launch vehicle. 

Arianespace signed 11 contracts in 2014 until September that year. with two additional being in a late stage of negotiations. Arianespace has a backlog of launches worth billion with 38 satellites to be launched on <a href="Ariane%205">Ariane 5</a>, 7 on <a href="Soyuz%20at%20the%20Guiana%20Space%20Centre">Soyuz</a> and 9 on <a href="Vega%20%28rocket%29">Vega</a>, claiming 60% of the global satellite launch market.

By November 2014, SpaceX had "already begun to take market share" from Arianespace, and <a href="Eutelsat">Eutelsat</a> CEO <a href="Michel%20de%20Rosen">Michel de Rosen</a> — a major customer of Arianespace — said that "Each year that passes will see SpaceX advance, gain market share and further reduce its costs through <a href="economies%20of%20scale">economies of scale</a>." 

Currently Arianespace operates 3 launch vehicles, including two versions of Ariane 5:

Additionally Arianespace offers optional back-up launch service on <a href="H-IIA">H-IIA</a> through <a href="Launch%20Services%20Alliance">Launch Services Alliance</a>.

Since the first launch in 1979, there have been several versions of the Ariane <a href="launch%20vehicle">launch vehicle</a>:

The new <a href="Ariane%206">Ariane 6</a> vehicle is in development. It would have a similar payload capacity to the Ariane 5 but have considerably lower costs. Tentatively, its first flight is planned for 2020.

Amiga 500 Plus

The <a href="Commodore%20International">Commodore</a> <a href="Amiga">Amiga</a> 500 Plus (often A500 Plus or simply A500+) is an enhanced version of the original <a href="Amiga%20500">Amiga 500</a> computer. It was notable for introducing new versions of <a href="Kickstart%20%28Amiga%29">Kickstart</a> and <a href="AmigaOS">Workbench</a>, and for some minor improvements in the custom chips, known as the <a href="Enhanced%20Chip%20Set">Enhanced Chip Set</a> (or ECS).

The A500+ was released in several markets (including many <a href="Europe">Europe</a>an countries), but was never sold officially in the <a href="United%20States">U.S.</a>

Although officially introduced in 1992, some Amiga 500 Plus units had already been sold (masquerading as Amiga 500 models, and with no prior announcement) during late 1991. It has been speculated that Commodore had already sold out the remaining stocks of Amiga 500s, before the run up to the profitable Christmas sales period. In order to make enough A500s before Christmas, Commodore used stocks of the new 8A revision motherboards destined for the A500+. Many users were unaware that they were purchasing anything other than a standard Amiga 500. Although the Amiga 500+ was an improvement to the Amiga 500, it was minor. It was discontinued and replaced by the <a href="Amiga%20600">Amiga 600</a> in summer 1992, making it the shortest lived Amiga model.

Commodore created the A500+ for a couple of reasons. The first was cost reduction; minor changes were made to the motherboard to make it cheaper to produce. It was also so that Commodore could introduce the new version of the <a href="AmigaOS">Amiga Operating system</a>, 2.04.

Due to the new Kickstart, quite a few popular games (such as <a href="Treasure%20Island%20Dizzy">Treasure Island Dizzy</a>, <a href="SWIV">SWIV</a>, and <a href="Lotus%20Esprit%20Turbo%20Challenge">Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge</a>) failed to work on the Amiga 500+, and some people took them back to dealers demanding an original Kickstart 1.3 Amiga 500. This problem was solved by third parties who produced Kickstart <a href="Read-only%20memory">ROM</a> <a href="switching%20boards">switching boards</a>, that could allow the Amiga 500+ to be downgraded to Kickstart 1.2 or 1.3. It also encouraged game developers to use better programming habits, which was important since Commodore already had plans for the introduction of the next-generation <a href="Amiga%201200">Amiga 1200</a> computer. A program, Relokick, was also released (and included with an issue of CU Amiga) which loaded a <a href="Kickstart%20%28Amiga%29">Kickstart</a> 1.3 ROM image into memory and booted the machine into Kickstart 1.3, allowing incompatible software to run. In some cases, updated compatible versions of games were later released, such as budget versions of Lotus 1 and SWIV.

<doc id="3116" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3116" title="Accumulator (computing)">
Accumulator (computing)

In a <a href="computer">computer</a>'s central processing unit (<a href="central%20processing%20unit">CPU</a>), an accumulator is a <a href="processor%20register">register</a> in which <a href="%3Awikt%3Aintermediate">intermediate</a> <a href="arithmetic%20logic%20unit">arithmetic and logic</a> results are stored. 

Without a <a href="Processor%20register">register</a> like an accumulator, it would be necessary to write the result of each calculation (addition, multiplication, <a href="Bitwise%20operation%23bit%20shifts">shift</a>, etc.) to <a href="primary%20storage">main memory</a>, perhaps only to be read right back again for use in the next <a href="operation%20%28computer%20science%29">operation</a>. Access to main memory is slower than access to a register like the accumulator because the technology used for the large main memory is slower (but cheaper) than that used for a register. Early electronic computer systems were often split into two groups, those with accumulators and those without.

Modern computer systems often have multiple general purpose registers that operate as accumulators, and the term is no longer as common as it once was. However, a number of special-purpose processors still use a single accumulator for their work, in order to simplify their design.

Mathematical operations often take place in a stepwise fashion, using the results from one operation as the input to the next. For instance, a manual calculation of a worker's weekly payroll might look something like:

A computer program carrying out the same task would follow the same basic sequence of operations, although the values being looked up would all be stored in computer memory. In early computers the number of hours would likely be held on a <a href="punch%20card">punch card</a> and the pay rate in some other form of memory, perhaps a <a href="magnetic%20drum">magnetic drum</a>. Once the multiplication is complete, the result needs to be placed somewhere. On a "drum machine" this would likely be back to the drum, an operation that takes considerable time. And then the very next operation has to read that value back in, which introduces another considerable delay.

Accumulators dramatically improve performance in systems like these by providing a scratchpad area where the results of one operation can be fed to the next one for little or no performance penalty. In the example above, the basic weekly pay would be calculated and placed in the accumulator, which could then immediately be used by the income tax calculation. This removes one save and one read operation from the sequence, operations that generally took tens to hundreds of times as long as the multiplication itself.

An accumulator machine, also called a <a href="Instruction_set_architecture%23Number_of_operands">1-operand machine</a>, or a CPU with "accumulator-based architecture", is a kind of CPU where, although it may have several registers, the CPU mostly stores the results of calculations in one special register, typically called "the accumulator". Almost all early computers were accumulator machines with only the high-performance "<a href="supercomputer">supercomputer</a>s" having multiple registers. Then as <a href="mainframe%20computer">mainframe</a> systems gave way to <a href="microcomputer">microcomputer</a>s, accumulator architectures were again popular with the <a href="MOS%206502">MOS 6502</a> being a notable example. Many 8-bit <a href="microcontroller">microcontroller</a>s that are still popular as of 2014, such as the <a href="PICmicro">PICmicro</a> and <a href="8051">8051</a>, are accumulator-based machines.

Modern CPUs are typically 2-operand or 3-operand machines. The additional operands specify which one of many <a href="general%20purpose%20register">general purpose register</a>s (also called "general purpose accumulators") are used as the source and destination for calculations. These CPUs are not considered "accumulator machines".

The characteristic which distinguishes one register as being the accumulator of a <a href="computer%20architecture">computer architecture</a> is that the accumulator (if the architecture were to have one) would be used as an "implicit" <a href="operand">operand</a> for arithmetic <a href="instruction%20%28computer%20science%29">instruction</a>s. For instance, a CPU might have an instruction like: codice_1 that adds the value read from memory location "memaddress" to the value in the accumulator, placing the result back in the accumulator. The accumulator is not identified in the instruction by a register number; it is <a href="addressing_mode%23Implicit">implicit</a> in the instruction and no other register can be specified in the instruction. Some architectures use a particular register as an accumulator in some instructions, but other instructions use register numbers for explicit operand specification.

Any system that uses a single "memory" to store the result of multiple operations can be considered an accumulator. <a href="J.%20Presper%20Eckert">J. Presper Eckert</a> refers to even the earliest <a href="adding%20machine">adding machine</a>s of <a href="Gottfried%20Leibniz">Gottfried Leibniz</a> and <a href="Blaise%20Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a> as accumulator-based systems.

Historical convention dedicates a register to "the accumulator", an "arithmetic organ" that literally accumulates its number during a sequence of arithmetic operations:

Just a few of the instructions are, for example (with some modern interpretation):

No convention exists regarding the names for operations from registers to accumulator and from accumulator to registers. Tradition (e.g. <a href="Donald%20Knuth">Donald Knuth</a>'s (1973) hypothetical <a href="MIX">MIX</a> computer), for example, uses two instructions called "load accumulator" from register/memory (e.g. "LDA r") and "store accumulator" to register/memory (e.g. "STA r"). Knuth's model has many other instructions as well.

The 1945 configuration of <a href="ENIAC">ENIAC</a> had 20 accumulators, which could operate in parallel. Each one could store an eight decimal digit number and add to it (or subtract from it) a number it received. Most of IBM's early binary "scientific" computers, beginning with the vacuum tube <a href="IBM%20701">IBM 701</a> in 1952, used a single 36-bit accumulator, along with a separate multiplier/quotient register to handle operations with longer results. The <a href="IBM%20650">IBM 650</a>, a decimal machine, had one 10 digit accumulator; the <a href="IBM%207070">IBM 7070</a>, a later, transistorized decimal machine had three accumulators.

The 12-bit <a href="PDP-8">PDP-8</a> was one of the first minicomputers to use accumulators, and inspired many later machines. The PDP-8 had but one accumulator. The <a href="HP%202100">HP 2100</a> and <a href="Data%20General%20Nova">Data General Nova</a> had 2 and 4 accumulators. The Nova was created when this follow-on to the PDP-8 was rejected in favor of what would become the <a href="PDP-11">PDP-11</a>. The Nova provided four accumulators, AC0-AC3, although AC2 and AC3 could also be used to provide offset addresses, tending towards more generality of usage for the registers. The <a href="PDP-11">PDP-11</a> introduced a more contemporary model of general registers, numbered R0-R7 or more, adopted by most later CISC and RISC machines.
Early 4-bit and 8-bit microprocessors such as the <a href="4004">4004</a>, <a href="8008">8008</a> and numerous others, typically had single accumulators. The <a href="8051">8051</a> microcontroller has two, a primary accumulator and a secondary accumulator, where the second is used by instructions only when multiplying (MUL AB) or dividing (DIV AB); the former splits the 16-bit result between the two 8-bit accumulators, whereas the latter stores the quotient on the primary accumulator A and the remainder in the secondary accumulator B. As a direct descendent of the 8008, the <a href="8080">8080</a>, and the <a href="Intel%208086">8086</a>, the modern ubiquitous <a href="Intel%20x86">Intel x86</a> processors still uses the primary accumulator EAX and the secondary accumulator EDX for multiplication and division of large numbers. For instance, MUL ECX will multiply the 32-bit registers ECX and EAX and split the 64-bit result between EAX and EDX. However, MUL and DIV are special cases, other arithmetic-logical instructions (ADD, SUB, CMP, AND, OR, XOR, TEST) may specify any of the eight registers EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, ESP, EBP, ESI, EDI as the accumulator (i.e. left operand and destination); this is also supported for multiply if the upper half of the result is not required. x86 is thus a fairly general register architecture, despite being based on an accumulator model. The 64-bit extension of x86, <a href="x86-64">x86-64</a>, has been further generalized to 16 instead of 8 general registers.

Abu Zubaydah

Abu Zubaydah ( ; , "Abū Zubaydah"; born March 12, 1971, as Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn) is a Saudi Arabian citizen currently held by the U.S. in the <a href="Guantanamo%20Bay%20detention%20camp">Guantanamo Bay detention camp</a> in Cuba. He is held under the authority of <a href="Authorization%20for%20Use%20of%20Military%20Force%20Against%20Terrorists">Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists</a> (AUMF).

Zubaydah was arrested in Pakistan in March 2002 and has been in United States custody ever since, including four-and-a-half years in the <a href="Black%20site">secret prison network</a> of the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA). He was transferred among prisons in various countries as part of a United States <a href="Rendition%20%28law%29">rendition</a> program. During his time in CIA custody, Zubaydah was extensively interrogated; he was <a href="waterboarding">water-boarded</a> 83 times and subjected to numerous other <a href="torture">torture</a> techniques including <a href="Nudity%23Imposed%20nudity">forced nudity</a>, <a href="sleep%20deprivation">sleep deprivation</a>, confinement in small dark boxes, deprivation of solid food, <a href="stress%20position">stress position</a>s, and physical assaults. While in CIA custody, Zubaydah lost his left eye. Videotapes of some of Zubaydah's interrogations are amongst those <a href="2005%20CIA%20interrogation%20tapes%20destruction">destroyed by the CIA in 2005</a>.

Zubaydah and ten other "high-value detainees" were transferred to Guantanamo in September 2006. He and other former CIA detainees are held in <a href="Camp%20seven%20%28Guantanamo%29%23Camp%20seven/Camp%20Platinum">Camp 7</a>, where conditions are the most isolating. At his <a href="Combatant%20Status%20Review%20Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunal</a> in 2007, Zubaydah said he was told that the CIA realized he was not significant.

On July 24, 2014, the <a href="European%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) ordered the Polish government to pay Zubaydah <a href="euro">€100,000</a> in damages. It also awarded him €30,000 to cover his costs. <a href="Poland">Poland</a> cooperated with the US, allowing the CIA to hold and torture Zubaydah on its territory in 2002–2003. Zubaydah said through his US lawyer that he would be donating the full €100,000 in damages to victims of torture. <a href="Joseph%20Margulies%20%28lawyer%29">Joseph Margulies</a> was a lawyer for Zubaydah.

According to his younger brother Hesham, they had eight siblings. Hesham remembers his older brother "as a happy-go-lucky guy, and something of a womanizer." Born in Saudi Arabia, Zubaydah moved to the <a href="West%20Bank">West Bank</a> as a teenager, where he joined in Palestinian demonstrations against the Israelis. Zubaydah is reported to have studied <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a> in <a href="Pune">Pune</a>, India prior to his travel to Afghanistan/Pakistan at the age of 20 in 1991. He joined the <a href="Afghan%20mujahideen">mujahideen</a> in the <a href="Civil%20war%20in%20Afghanistan%20%281989%E2%80%931992%29">Afghan civil war</a>, perhaps serving under <a href="Mohamad%20Kamal%20Elzahabi">Mohamad Kamal Elzahabi</a>. In 1992, Zubaydah was injured in a mortar shell blast, which left shrapnel in his head and caused severe memory loss, as well as the loss of the ability to speak for over one year.

Zubaydah eventually became involved in the jihad training site known as the <a href="Khalden%20training%20camp">Khalden training camp</a>, where he oversaw the flow of recruits and obtained passports and paperwork for men transferring out of Khalden. He may also have worked as an instructor there. Although originally described as an <a href="Afghan%20training%20camp">Al Qaeda training camp</a>, this alleged connection, which has been used as justification for holding Zubaydah and others as enemy combatants, has come under scrutiny from multiple sources,<ref name="9/11CommissionReport"><a href="http%3A//www.gpoaccess.gov/911/pdf/fullreport.pdf">"9/11 Commission Report: Final Report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States"</a> , July 22, 2006</ref> and the camp may have shuttered its doors in 2001 in response to an ideological division with Al Qaeda.

By 1999, the United States government was attempting to surveil Zubaydah. By March 2000, United States officials were reporting that Zubaydah was a "senior <a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden">Bin Laden</a> official," the "former head of <a href="Egyptian%20Islamic%20Jihad">Egypt-based Islamic Jihad</a>," a "trusted aide" to Bin Laden with "growing power," who had "played a key role in the <a href="East%20Africa%20embassy%20attacks">East Africa embassy attacks</a>." Zubaydah was convicted "<a href="Trial%20in%20absentia">in absentia</a>" in <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a> and sentenced to death by a Jordanian court for his role in <a href="2000%20millennium%20attack%20plots">plots to bomb U.S. and Israeli targets</a> there. A senior Middle East security official said Zubaydah had directed the Jordanian cell and was part of "Bin Laden's inner circle."

In August 2001, the classified <a href="FBI">FBI</a> report, "<a href="Bin%20Laden%20Determined%20To%20Strike%20in%20US">Bin Laden Determined To Strike in US</a>", said that the foiled millennium bomber, <a href="Ahmed%20Ressam">Ahmed Ressam</a>, had confessed that Zubaydah had encouraged him to blow up the Los Angeles airport and facilitated his mission. The report said that Zubaydah was also planning his own attack on the U.S. However, when Ressam was tried in December 2001, federal prosecutors did not try to connect him to Zubaydah or refer to any of this supposed evidence in its case. After the trial, Ressam recanted his confession, saying he had been coerced into giving it.

According to a psychological evaluation conducted upon his capture, Zubaydah allegedly served as Osama Bin Laden's senior lieutenant and counter-intelligence officer (i.e. third or fourth highest-ranking member of al Qaeda), managed a network of training camps, was involved in every major terrorist operation carried out by al Qaeda (including the planning of <a href="9/11">9/11</a>), and was engaged in planning future terrorist attacks against U.S. interests. These statements were widely echoed by members of the <a href="Presidency%20of%20George%20W.%20Bush">Bush administration</a> and other US officials. Zubaydah's perceived "value" as a detainee would later be used by <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">President Bush</a> to justify the use of "<a href="enhanced%20interrogation%20techniques">enhanced interrogation techniques</a>" and Zubaydah's detention in secret CIA prisons around the world. However, Zubaydah's connection to Al Qaeda is now often said to have been overstated, and in response to his <a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a> petition, the U.S. Government stated in 2009 that they did not contend that Zubaydah had any involvement with the 9/11 attacks or that he had even been a member of Al Qaeda.

On March 28, 2002, CIA and FBI agents, in conjunction with Pakistani intelligence services, raided several safe houses in Pakistan searching for Zubaydah. Zubaydah was apprehended from one of the targeted safe houses in <a href="Faisalabad">Faisalabad</a>, Pakistan. The Pakistani intelligence service had paid a small amount for a tip on his whereabouts. The United States paid far more to Pakistan for its assistance; a CIA source later said, "We paid $10 million for Zubaydah." The Pakistan ISI built a new headquarters on 35 acres outside Islamabad with the money and also bought a helicopter.

During the raid, Zubaydah was shot in the thigh, the testicle, and the stomach with rounds from an AK-47 assault rifle. Not recognised at first, he was piled into a <a href="pick-up%20truck">pick-up truck</a> along with other prisoners by the Pakistani forces, until a senior FBI agent identified him. He was taken by the FBI to a Pakistani hospital nearby and treated for his wounds. The attending doctor told <a href="John%20Kiriakou">John Kiriakou</a>, the co-leader of the CIA group which apprehended Zubaydah, that he had never before seen a patient survive such severe wounds. The FBI and CIA flew in a doctor from <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a> to ensure Zubaydah would survive during transit out of Pakistan.

His <a href="pocket%20litter">pocket litter</a> supposedly contained two <a href="ATM%20card">bank cards</a> which showed he had access to Saudi and Kuwaiti bank accounts; most al-Qaeda members used the preferred, untraceable <a href="hawala">hawala</a> banking. According to <a href="James%20Risen">James Risen</a>, "It is not clear whether an investigation of the cards simply fell through the cracks, or whether they were ignored because no one wanted to know the answers about connections between al Qaeda and important figures in the Middle East – particularly in Saudi Arabia." One of Risen's sources chalks up the failure to investigate the cards to incompetence rather than foul play: "The cards were sent back to Washington and were never fully exploited. I think nobody ever looked at them because of incompetence."

When Americans investigated the cards, they worked with "a Muslim financier with a questionable past, and with connections to the Afghan Taliban, al Qaeda, and Saudi intelligence." Risen wrote, "Saudi intelligence officials had seized all of the records related to the card from the Saudi financial institution in question; the records then disappeared. There was no longer any way to trace the money that had gone into the account."

A search of the safehouse turned up Zubaydah's personal 10,000-page diaries, in which he recorded his thoughts as a young boy, old man, and at his current age. What appears to be split personalities is how Zubaydah was piecing his memories together after his 1992 shrapnel head wound. As part of his therapy to regain his memories, he began recording the diary that detailed his life, emotions, and what people were telling him. He split information into categories, such as what he knew about himself and what people told him, and listed them under different names to distinguish one set from the other. This was later incorrectly interpreted by some analysts reviewing the diary as symptoms of split <a href="personality%20disorder">personality disorder</a>.

Zubaydah was turned over to the CIA. Reports later alleged that he was transferred to <a href="Black%20site">secret CIA-operated prisons</a>, known as <a href="black%20sites">black sites</a>, in Pakistan, Thailand, Afghanistan, Poland, Northern Africa, and <a href="Diego%20Garcia">Diego Garcia</a>. Historically, renditions of prisoners to countries which commit torture have been illegal. A memo written by <a href="John%20Yoo">John Yoo</a> and signed by <a href="Jay%20Bybee">Jay Bybee</a> of the Office of the Legal Counsel, DOJ, days before Zubaydah's capture, provided a legal opinion providing for CIA renditions of detainees to places such as Thailand. In March 2009, the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee launched a year-long study on how the CIA operated the secret prisons, or <a href="black%20sites">black sites</a>, around the world.

In the spring of 2002, immediately following the capture of Zubaydah, top Bush administration officials, Vice President <a href="Dick%20Cheney">Dick Cheney</a>, Secretary of State <a href="Colin%20Powell">Colin Powell</a>, <a href="CIA%20Director">CIA Director</a> <a href="George%20Tenet">George Tenet</a>, <a href="National%20Security%20Advisor%20%28United%20States%29">National Security Adviser</a> <a href="Condoleezza%20Rice">Condoleezza Rice</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="Donald%20Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a>, and <a href="US%20Attorney%20General">US Attorney General</a> <a href="John%20Ashcroft">John Ashcroft</a> discussed at length whether or not the CIA could legally use harsh techniques against him. Condoleezza Rice specifically mentioned the <a href="Survival%2C%20Evasion%2C%20Resistance%20and%20Escape">SERE</a> program during the meeting, saying, "I recall being told that U.S. military personnel were subjected to training to certain physical and psychological interrogation techniques..."

In addition, in 2002 and 2003, the administration briefed several Democratic Congressional leaders on the proposed "<a href="enhanced%20interrogation">enhanced interrogation</a> techniques." These congressional leaders included <a href="Nancy%20Pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a>, the future <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a>, and Representative <a href="Jane%20Harman">Jane Harman</a>. Congressional officials have stated that the attitude in the briefings ranged from "quiet acquiescence, if not downright support." The documents show that top U.S. Officials were intimately involved in the discussion and approval of the harsher interrogation techniques used on Zubaydah. Condoleezza Rice ultimately told the CIA the harsher interrogation tactics were acceptable, and Dick Cheney stated, "I signed off on it; so did others." During the discussions, US Attorney General <a href="John%20Ashcroft">John Ashcroft</a> is reported as saying, "Why are we talking about this in the White House? History will not judge this kindly."

Zubaydah was interrogated by two separate interrogation teams: the first from the FBI and one from the CIA. <a href="Ali%20Soufan">Ali Soufan</a>, one of the FBI interrogators, later testified in 2009 on these issues to the Senate Committee that was investigating detainee treatment. Soufan, who witnessed part of the CIA interrogation of Zubaydah, described his treatment under the CIA as <a href="torture">torture</a>. The International Committee of the Red Cross and others later reached the same conclusion. While in CIA custody, Zubaydah lost his left eye.

Because of the urgency felt about the interrogation of Zubaydah, the CIA had consulted with the president about how to proceed. The General Counsel of the CIA asked for a legal opinion from the <a href="Office%20of%20Legal%20Counsel">Office of Legal Counsel</a>, Department of Justice about what was permissible during interrogation.

In early July 2002 the Associate General Council <a href="Counterterrorism%20Center">CTC</a>/Legal Group started drafting a memo to the <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> requesting the approval of "aggressive" interrogation methods, which otherwise would be prohibited under the provisions of Section 2340-2340B, Title 18, <a href="United%20States%20Code">United States Code</a>, on Abu Zubaydah. This memo, drafted by Office of Legal Counsel, <a href="Jay%20Bybee">Jay Bybee</a> and his assistant <a href="John%20Yoo">John Yoo</a>, is also referred to as the first <a href="Torture%20Memo">Torture Memo</a>. Addressed to CIA acting General Counsel <a href="John%20A.%20Rizzo">John A. Rizzo</a> at his request, the purpose of the memo was to describe and authorize specific <a href="enhanced%20interrogation%20techniques">enhanced interrogation techniques</a> to be used on Zubaydah. On July 26, 2002 Deputy Assistant Attorney General <a href="John%20Yoo">John Yoo</a> informed the CIA that Attorney General <a href="John%20Ashcroft">John Ashcroft</a> had approved waterboarding of Abu Zubaydah.

Journalists including Jane Mayer, Joby Warrick and Peter Finn, and Alex Koppelman have reported the CIA was already using these harsh tactics before the memo authorizing their use was written, and that it was used to provide after-the-fact legal support for harsh interrogation techniques. A Department of Justice 2009 report regarding prisoner abuses reportedly stated the memos were prepared one month after Zubaydah had already been subjected to the specific techniques authorized in August 1, 2002, memo. <a href="John%20Kiriakou">John Kiriakou</a> stated in July 2009 that Zubaydah was waterboarded in the early summer of 2002, months before August 1, 2002, memo was written.

The memo described ten techniques which the interrogators wanted to use: "(1) attention grasp, (2) walling, (3) facial hold, (4) facial slap (insult slap), (5) cramped confinement, (6) wall standing, (7) stress positions, (8) sleep deprivation, (9) insects placed in a confinement box, and (10) the <a href="waterboarding">waterboard</a>." Many of the techniques were, until then, generally considered illegal. Many other techniques developed by the CIA were held to constitute inhumane and degrading treatment and torture under the United Nations Convention against Torture and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

As reported later, many of these interrogation techniques were previously considered illegal under U.S. and international law and treaties at the time of Zubaydah's capture. For instance, the United States had prosecuted Japanese military officials after World War II and American soldiers after the Vietnam War for waterboarding. Since 1930, the United States had defined sleep deprivation as an illegal form of torture. Many other techniques developed by the CIA constitute inhuman and degrading treatment and torture under the United Nations Convention against Torture, and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

The CIA subjected Zubaydah to various forms of increasingly harsh interrogation techniques, including temperature extremes, music played at debilitating volumes, and sexual humiliation. Zubaydah was also subjected to beatings, isolation, <a href="waterboarding">waterboarding</a>, long-time standing, continuous cramped confinement, and <a href="sleep%20deprivation">sleep deprivation</a>.

During Zubaydah's interrogation, President Bush learned he was on painkillers for his wounds and was proving resistant. He said to the CIA director <a href="George%20Tenet">George Tenet</a>, "Who authorized putting him on pain medication?" It was later reported that Zubaydah was denied painkillers during his interrogation.

Zubaydah was one of three or more high-value detainees to be waterboarded. The Bush administration in 2007 said that Zubaydah had been waterboarded once. <a href="John%20Kiriakou">John Kiriakou</a>, a CIA officer who had seen the cables regarding Zubaydah's interrogation, publicly said in 2009 that Zubaydah was waterboarded once for 35 seconds before he started talking.

Intelligence sources claimed as early as 2008 that Zubaydah had been waterboarded no less than ten times in the span of one week. Zubaydah was waterboarded 83 times within the month of August 2002, the month the CIA was authorized to use this <a href="enhanced%20interrogation%20techniques">enhanced interrogation techniques</a> for him. In January 2010, Kiriakou, in a memoir, said, "Now we know that Zubaydah was waterboarded eighty-three times in a single month, raising questions about how much useful information he actually supplied."

In August 2010 the Associated Press reported that the CIA, having concluded its agents had gotten most of the information from Zubaydah, in September 2003 transferred him and three other high-value detainees to Guantanamo. They were held at what was informally known as "<a href="Strawberry%20Fields%20%28Guantanamo%29">Strawberry Fields</a>," a secret camp within the complex built especially for former CIA detainees. Concerned that a pending Supreme Court decision, "<a href="Rasul%20v.%20Bush">Rasul v. Bush</a>" (2004), might go against the Bush administration and require providing the prisoners with counsel and having to reveal data about them, on March 27, 2004, the CIA took the four men back into custody and transported them out of Guantanamo to one of their secret sites. At the time, the moves were all kept secret.

In February 2007, the International Committee of the Red Cross concluded a report on the treatment of "14 high-value detainees," who had been held by the CIA and, after September 2006, by the military at Guantanamo. The ICRC described the twelve <a href="enhanced%20interrogation%20techniques">enhanced interrogation techniques</a> covered in the OLC memos to the CIA: <a href="waterboarding">suffocation by water</a> (which is described as "torture" by numerous US officials), prolonged stress standing position, beatings by use of a collar, beating and kicking, confinement in a box, prolonged nudity, sleep deprivation, exposure to cold temperature, prolonged shackling, threats of ill-treatment, forced shaving, and deprivation/restricted provision of solid food. Zubaydah was the only detainee of the 14 interviewed who had been subjected to all 12 of these interrogation techniques. He was also the only one of the 14 detainees to be put into close confinement.

The final memo mentioned Zubaydah several times. It claimed that due to the enhanced interrogation techniques, Zubaydah "provided significant information on two operatives, [including] José Padilla[,] who planned to build and detonate a '<a href="dirty%20bomb">dirty bomb</a>' in the Washington DC area." This claim is strongly disputed by Ali Soufan, the FBI interrogator who first interrogated Zubaydah following his capture, by traditional means. He said the most valuable information was gained before torture was used. Other intelligence officers have also disputed that claim. Soufan, when asked in 2009 by Senator <a href="Sheldon%20Whitehouse">Sheldon Whitehouse</a> during a Congressional hearing if the memo was incorrect, testified that it was. The memo noted that not all of the waterboarding sessions were necessary for Zubaydah, since the on-scene interrogation team determined he had stopped producing actionable intelligence. The memo reads:
This is not to say that the interrogation program has worked perfectly. According to the IG Report, the CIA, at least initially, could not always distinguish detainees who had information but were successfully resisting interrogation from those who did not actually have the information. See IG Report at 83–85. On at least one occasion, this may have resulted in what might be deemed in retrospect to have been the unnecessary use of enhanced techniques. On that occasion, although the on-scene interrogation team judged Zubaydah to be compliant, elements within CIA Headquarters still believed he was withholding information. See id at 84. At the direction of CIA Headquarters, interrogators therefore used the waterboard one more time on Zubaydah.
<a href="John%20E.%20McLaughlin">John McLaughlin</a>, former acting CIA director, stated in 2006, "I totally disagree with the view that the capture of Zubaydah was unimportant. Zubaydah was woven through all of the intelligence prior to 9/11 that signaled a major attack was coming, and his capture yielded a great deal of important information."

In his 2007 memoir, former <a href="Director%20of%20Central%20Intelligence">CIA Director</a> <a href="George%20Tenet">George Tenet</a> writes:
A published report in 2006 contended that Zubaydah was mentally unstable and that the administration had overstated his importance. Baloney. Zubaydah had been at the crossroads of many al-Qa'ida operations and was in position to – and did – share critical information with his interrogators. Apparently, the source of the rumor that Zubaydah was unbalanced was his personal diary, in which he adopted various personas. From that shaky perch, some junior Freudians leapt to the conclusion that Zubaydah had multiple personalities. In fact, Agency psychiatrists eventually determined that in his diary he was using a sophisticated literary device to express himself. And, boy, did he express himself.

Zubaydah's capture was touted as the biggest of the War on Terror until that of <a href="Khalid%20Sheikh%20Mohammed">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed</a>.<ref name="9/11MastermindNabbed"><a href="http%3A//www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/02/terror/main542459.shtml">"Alleged 9-11 Mastermind Nabbed"</a> CBS News, March 1, 2003</ref> The director of the FBI stated Zubaydah's capture would help deter future attacks.

In a speech in 2006, President Bush claimed that Zubaydah revealed useful intelligence when enhanced interrogation was used, including identification of two important suspects and information that allegedly helped foil a terrorist attack on American soil. These claims directly conflict with the reports of the F.B.I. agents who first interrogated Zubaydah. He gave them the names before torture was used, and the third piece of information came from other sources who had been receiving crucial pieces of information from him without the use of harsher techniques, as well as other government officials.

The Bush administration relied on some of Zubaydah's claims in justifying the invasion of Iraq. U.S. officials stated that the allegations that Iraq and al-Qaeda were linked in the training of people on chemical weapons came from Zubaydah. The officials noted there was no independent verification of his claims.

The U.S. Government included statements made by Zubaydah in regards to al Qaeda's ability to obtain a dirty bomb to show a link between Iraq and al Qaeda. According to a Senate Intelligence Committee report of 2004, Zubaydah said that "he had heard that an important al Qaeda associate, <a href="Abu%20Musab%20al%20Zarqawi">Abu Musab al Zarqawi</a>, and others had good relationships with Iraqi intelligence." But the year before in June 2003, Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed were reported as saying there was no link between <a href="Saddam%20Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> and <a href="al%20Qaeda">al Qaeda</a>.

In the Senate Armed Services Committee 2008 report on the abuses of detainees, the Bush administration was described as having applied pressure to interrogators to find a link between Iraq and Al-Qaeda prior to the Iraq War. Major Paul Burney, a psychiatrist with the United States Army, said to the committee, "while we were [at Guantanamo] a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between Al Qaeda and Iraq and we were not being successful." He said that higher-ups were "frustrated" and applied "more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results."

Colonel Lawrence B. Wilkerson, the former chief of staff for former Secretary of State <a href="Colin%20Powell">Colin Powell</a> said:
Likewise, what I have learned is that as the administration authorized harsh interrogation in April and May of 2002—well before the Justice Department had rendered any legal opinion—its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at pre-empting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al-Qa'ida.

So furious was this effort that on one particular detainee, even when the interrogation team had reported to Cheney's office that their detainee "was compliant" (meaning the team recommended no more torture), the VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods. The detainee had not revealed any al-Qa'ida-Baghdad contacts yet. This ceased only after Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, under waterboarding in Egypt, "revealed" such contacts. Of course, later we learned that al-Libi revealed these contacts only to get the torture to stop.

In 2004 media coverage of Abu Zubaydah began listing him as a "disappeared" prisoner, claiming he had no access to the International Red Cross. In February 2005, the CIA was reported as uncomfortable keeping Zubaydah in indefinite custody. Less than 18 months later, Zubaydah and the thirteen other high-value detainees who had been in secret CIA custody were transferred to the <a href="Guantanamo%20Bay%20detention%20camp">Guantanamo Bay detention camp</a>.

After his transfer, the CIA denied access to Zubaydah. In 2008, the Office of the <a href="Inspector%20General">Inspector General</a>, Department of Justice, complained that it had been prevented from seeing him, although it was conducting a study of the US treatment of its detainees.

Some people are concerned about Zubaydah's mental stability and how that has affected information he has given to interrogators. <a href="Ron%20Suskind">Ron Suskind</a> noted in his book, "<a href="The%20One%20Percent%20Doctrine">The One Percent Doctrine</a>: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11" (2006), that Zubaydah was mentally ill or disabled due to a severe head injury. He described Zubaydah as keeping a diary "in the voice of three people: Hani 1, Hani 2, and Hani 3"—a boy, a young man and a middle-aged alter ego. Zubaydah's diaries spanned ten years and recorded in numbing detail "what he ate, or wore, or trifling things [people] said." Dan Coleman, then the FBI's top al-Qaeda analyst, told a senior bureau official, "This guy is insane, certifiable, split personality." According to Suskind, this judgment was "echoed at the top of CIA and was briefed to the President and Vice President." Coleman stated Zubaydah was a "safehouse keeper" with mental problems, who "claimed to know more about al-Qaeda and its inner workings than he really did."

<a href="Joseph%20Margulies%20%28lawyer%29">Joseph Margulies</a>, Zubaydah's co-counsel, wrote in an OpEd in the "Los Angeles Times":
Partly as a result of injuries he suffered while he was fighting the communists in Afghanistan, partly as a result of how those injuries were exacerbated by the CIA and partly as a result of his extended isolation, Zubaydah's mental grasp is slipping away. Today, he suffers blinding headaches and has permanent brain damage. He has an excruciating sensitivity to sounds, hearing what others do not. The slightest noise drives him nearly insane. In the last two years alone, he has experienced about 200 seizures. Already, he cannot picture his mother's face or recall his father's name. Gradually, his past, like his future, eludes him.

President Bush referred to Zubaydah in a speech to Congress September 2006 requesting a bill to authorize <a href="military%20commissions">military commissions</a>, following the <a href="US%20Supreme%20Court">US Supreme Court</a> ruling in "<a href="Hamdan%20v.%20Rumsfeld">Hamdan v. Rumsfeld</a>" (2006) that held the tribunals as formulated by the executive branch were unconstitutional. Congress rapidly passed legislation that was signed by the president.

Less than one month after Zubaydah's capture, Justice Department officials said Zubaydah was "a near-ideal candidate for a tribunal trial." Several months later in 2002, US officials said there was "no rush" to try Zubaydah via military commission.

At his <a href="Combatant%20Status%20Review%20Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunal</a> in 2007, Zubaydah said he was told that the CIA realized he was not significant.
"They told me, 'Sorry, we discover that you are not Number 3, not a partner, not even a fighter,' "said Zubaydah, speaking in broken English, according to the new transcript of a <a href="Combatant%20Status%20Review%20Tribunal">Combatant Status Review Tribunal</a> held at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba."

Abu Zubaydah's lawyers filed a lawsuit in July 2008 challenging his detention at <a href="Guantanamo%20Bay%20detention%20camps">Guantanamo Bay detention camps</a> after the "<a href="Boumediene%20v.%20Bush">Boumediene v. Bush</a>" ruling. As of 2015, the judge overseeing the case, <a href="Richard%20W.%20Roberts">Richard W. Roberts</a>, has failed to rule on any motions related to the case, even the preliminary ones. This has led Zubaydah's lawyers to file motion asking Judge Roberts to recuse himself for <a href="nonfeasance">nonfeasance</a> in January 2015. On March 16, 2016, Roberts retired early from the federal bench, citing unspecified health issues.

The judge's failure to act for nearly eight years may be related to the revelation in the <a href="Senate%20Intelligence%20Committee%20report%20on%20CIA%20torture">Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture</a> that Zubaydah's CIA interrogators wanted him to "remain in isolation and incommunicado for the remainder of his life."

The U.S. Government has not officially charged Zubaydah with any crimes.

When he assumed office in January 2009 <a href="United%20States%20President">President</a> <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> made a number of promises about the future of Guantanamo.
He promised the use of torture would cease at the camp. He promised to institute a new review system. That new review system was composed of officials from six departments, where the <a href="Office%20for%20the%20Administrative%20Review%20of%20the%20Detention%20of%20Enemy%20Combatants">OARDEC</a> reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense. When it reported back, a year later, the <a href="Joint%20Review%20Task%20Force">Joint Review Task Force</a> classified some individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, even though there was no evidence to justify laying charges against them. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a <a href="Freedom%20of%20Information%20Act%20%28United%20States%29">Freedom of Information Act</a> request.
Zayn al-lbidin Muhammed Husayn was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge but too dangerous to release. Although Obama promised that those deemed too innocent to charge but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a <a href="Periodic%20Review%20Board">Periodic Review Board</a> less than a quarter of men have received a review.

On July 24, 2014, the <a href="European%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECHR) ruled that <a href="Poland">Poland</a> had violated the <a href="European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a> when it cooperated with US allowing the CIA to hold and torture Zubaydah and <a href="Abd%20al-Rahim%20al-Nashiri">Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri</a> on its territory in 2002–2003. The court ordered the Polish government to pay each of the men 100,000 <a href="euro">euro</a>s in damages. It also awarded Zubaydah 30,000 euros to cover his costs.

Arithmetic

Arithmetic (from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> <a href="wikt%3Aen%3A%E1%BC%80%CF%81%CE%B9%CE%B8%CE%BC%CF%8C%CF%82%23Ancient%20Greek">ἀριθμός</a> "arithmos", "<a href="number">number</a>") is a branch of <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> that consists of the study of <a href="number">number</a>s, especially the properties of the traditional <a href="operation%20%28mathematics%29">operations</a> between them—<a href="addition">addition</a>, <a href="subtraction">subtraction</a>, <a href="multiplication">multiplication</a> and <a href="division%20%28mathematics%29">division</a>. Arithmetic is an elementary part of <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level <a href="Areas%20of%20mathematics">divisions of modern mathematics</a>, along with <a href="algebra">algebra</a>, <a href="geometry">geometry</a>, and <a href="mathematical%20analysis">analysis</a>. The terms "arithmetic" and "higher arithmetic" were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for "number theory" and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory.

The prehistory of arithmetic is limited to a small number of artifacts which may indicate the conception of addition and subtraction, the best-known being the <a href="Ishango%20bone">Ishango bone</a> from <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">central Africa</a>, dating from somewhere between 20,000 and 18,000 BC, although its interpretation is disputed.

The earliest written records indicate the <a href="Egyptian%20mathematics">Egyptians</a> and <a href="Babylonian%20mathematics">Babylonians</a> used all the <a href="elementary%20arithmetic">elementary arithmetic</a> operations as early as 2000 BC. These artifacts do not always reveal the specific process used for solving problems, but the characteristics of the particular <a href="numeral%20system">numeral system</a> strongly influence the complexity of the methods. The hieroglyphic system for <a href="Egyptian%20numerals">Egyptian numerals</a>, like the later <a href="Roman%20numerals">Roman numerals</a>, descended from <a href="tally%20marks">tally marks</a> used for counting. In both cases, this origin resulted in values that used a <a href="decimal">decimal</a> base but did not include <a href="positional%20notation">positional notation</a>. Complex calculations with Roman numerals required the assistance of a <a href="counting%20board">counting board</a> or the <a href="Roman%20abacus">Roman abacus</a> to obtain the results.

Early number systems that included positional notation were not decimal, including the <a href="sexagesimal">sexagesimal</a> (base 60) system for <a href="Babylonian%20numerals">Babylonian numerals</a> and the <a href="vigesimal">vigesimal</a> (base 20) system that defined <a href="Maya%20numerals">Maya numerals</a>. Because of this place-value concept, the ability to reuse the same digits for different values contributed to simpler and more efficient methods of calculation.

The continuous historical development of modern arithmetic starts with the <a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenistic civilization</a> of ancient Greece, although it originated much later than the Babylonian and Egyptian examples. Prior to the works of <a href="Euclid">Euclid</a> around 300 BC, <a href="Greek%20mathematics">Greek studies in mathematics</a> overlapped with philosophical and mystical beliefs. For example, <a href="Nicomachus">Nicomachus</a> summarized the viewpoint of the earlier <a href="Pythagoreanism">Pythagorean</a> approach to numbers, and their relationships to each other, in his "<a href="Introduction%20to%20Arithmetic">Introduction to Arithmetic</a>".

<a href="Greek%20numerals">Greek numerals</a> were used by <a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a>, <a href="Diophantus">Diophantus</a> and others in a <a href="positional%20notation">positional notation</a> not very different from ours. Because the ancient Greeks lacked a symbol for zero (until the Hellenistic period), they used three separate sets of symbols. One set for the unit's place, one for the ten's place, and one for the hundred's. Then for the thousand's place they would reuse the symbols for the unit's place, and so on. Their addition algorithm was identical to ours, and their multiplication algorithm was only very slightly different. Their long division algorithm was the same, and the square root algorithm that was once taught in school was known to Archimedes, who may have invented it. He preferred it to <a href="Heron%27s%20method">Hero's method</a> of successive approximation because, once computed, a digit doesn't change, and the square roots of perfect squares, such as 7485696, terminate immediately as 2736. For numbers with a fractional part, such as 546.934, they used negative powers of 60 instead of negative powers of 10 for the fractional part 0.934. 

The ancient Chinese had advanced arithmetic studies dating from the Shang Dynasty and continuing through the Tang Dynasty, from basic numbers to advanced algebra. The ancient Chinese used a positional notation similar to that of the Greeks. Since they also lacked a symbol for zero, they had one set of symbols for the unit's place, and a second set for the ten's place. For the hundred's place they then reused the symbols for the unit's place, and so on. Their symbols were based on the ancient <a href="counting%20rods">counting rods</a>. It is a complicated question to determine exactly when the Chinese started calculating with positional representation, but it was definitely before 400 BC. The ancient Chinese were the first to meaningfully discover, understand, and apply negative numbers as explained in the "<a href="Nine%20Chapters%20on%20the%20Mathematical%20Art">Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art</a>" ("Jiuzhang Suanshu"), which was written by <a href="Liu%20Hui">Liu Hui</a>.

The gradual development of <a href="Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic%20numerals">Hindu–Arabic numerals</a> independently devised the place-value concept and positional notation, which combined the simpler methods for computations with a decimal base and the use of a digit representing <a href="0%20%28number%29">0</a>. This allowed the system to consistently represent both large and small integers. This approach eventually replaced all other systems. In the early the Indian mathematician <a href="Aryabhata">Aryabhata</a> incorporated an existing version of this system in his work, and experimented with different notations. In the 7th century, <a href="Brahmagupta">Brahmagupta</a> established the use of 0 as a separate number and determined the results for multiplication, division, addition and subtraction of zero and all other numbers, except for the result of <a href="division%20by%200">division by 0</a>. His contemporary, the <a href="Syriac%20Christianity">Syriac</a> bishop <a href="Severus%20Sebokht">Severus Sebokht</a> (650 AD) said, "Indians possess a method of calculation that no word can praise enough. Their rational system of mathematics, or of their method of calculation. I mean the system using nine symbols." The Arabs also learned this new method and called it "hesab".
Although the <a href="Codex%20Vigilanus">Codex Vigilanus</a> described an early form of Arabic numerals (omitting 0) by 976 AD, Leonardo of Pisa (<a href="Fibonacci">Fibonacci</a>) was primarily responsible for spreading their use throughout Europe after the publication of his book "<a href="Liber%20Abaci">Liber Abaci</a>" in 1202. He wrote, "The method of the Indians (Latin "Modus Indoram") surpasses any known method to compute. It's a marvelous method. They do their computations using nine figures and symbol <a href="zero">zero</a>".

In the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, arithmetic was one of the seven <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal arts</a> taught in universities.

The flourishing of <a href="algebra">algebra</a> in the <a href="medieval">medieval</a> <a href="Islamic">Islamic</a> world and in <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> <a href="Europe">Europe</a> was an outgrowth of the enormous simplification of <a href="computation">computation</a> through <a href="decimal">decimal</a> notation.

Various types of tools have been invented and widely used to assist in numeric calculations. Before Renaissance, they were various types of <a href="abaci">abaci</a>. More recent examples include <a href="slide%20rule">slide rule</a>s, <a href="nomogram">nomogram</a>s and <a href="mechanical%20calculator">mechanical calculator</a>s, such as <a href="Pascal%27s%20calculator">Pascal's calculator</a>. At present, they have been supplanted by electronic <a href="calculator">calculator</a>s and <a href="computer">computer</a>s.

The basic arithmetic operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, although this subject also includes more advanced operations, such as manipulations of <a href="percentage">percentage</a>s, <a href="square%20root">square root</a>s, <a href="exponentiation">exponentiation</a>, and <a href="logarithmic%20function">logarithmic function</a>s. Arithmetic is performed according to an <a href="order%20of%20operations">order of operations</a>. Any set of objects upon which all four arithmetic operations (except division by 0) can be performed, and where these four operations obey the usual laws, is called a <a href="field%20mathematics">field</a>.

Addition is the basic operation of arithmetic. In its simplest form, addition combines two numbers, the "addends" or "<a href="term%20%28mathematics%29">terms</a>", into a single number, the "sum" of the numbers (Such as or ).

Adding more than two numbers can be viewed as repeated addition; this procedure is known as <a href="summation">summation</a> and includes ways to add infinitely many numbers in an <a href="series%20%28mathematics%29">infinite series</a>; repeated addition of the number <a href="one">1</a> is the most basic form of <a href="counting">counting</a>.

Addition is <a href="commutative">commutative</a> and <a href="associative">associative</a> so the order the terms are added in does not matter. The <a href="identity%20element">identity element</a> of addition (the <a href="additive%20identity">additive identity</a>) is 0, that is, adding 0 to any number yields that same number. Also, the <a href="inverse%20element">inverse element</a> of addition (the <a href="additive%20inverse">additive inverse</a>) is the opposite of any number, that is, adding the opposite of any number to the number itself yields the additive identity, 0. For example, the opposite of 7 is −7, so .

Addition can be given geometrically as in the following example:

Subtraction is the inverse of addition. Subtraction finds the "difference" between two numbers, the "minuend" minus the "subtrahend". If the minuend is larger than the subtrahend, the difference is positive; if the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, the difference is negative; if they are equal, the difference is 0.

Subtraction is neither <a href="Commutative%20property">commutative</a> nor <a href="Associative%20property">associative</a>. For that reason, it is often helpful to look at subtraction as addition of the minuend and the opposite of the subtrahend, that is . When written as a sum, all the properties of addition hold.

There are several methods for calculating results, some of which are particularly advantageous to machine calculation. For example, digital computers employ the method of <a href="two%27s%20complement">two's complement</a>. Of great importance is the counting up method by which change is made. Suppose an amount "P" is given to pay the required amount "Q", with "P" greater than "Q". Rather than performing the subtraction and counting out that amount in change, money is counted out starting at "Q" and continuing until reaching "P". Although the amount counted out must equal the result of the subtraction , the subtraction was never really done and the value of might still be unknown to the change-maker.

Multiplication is the second basic operation of arithmetic. Multiplication also combines two numbers into a single number, the "product". The two original numbers are called the "multiplier" and the "multiplicand", sometimes both simply called "factors".

Multiplication may be viewed as a scaling operation. If the numbers are imagined as lying in a line, multiplication by a number, say "x", greater than 1 is the same as stretching everything away from 0 uniformly, in such a way that the number 1 itself is stretched to where "x" was. Similarly, multiplying by a number less than 1 can be imagined as squeezing towards 0. (Again, in such a way that 1 goes to the multiplicand.)

Multiplication is commutative and associative; further it is <a href="distributivity">distributive</a> over addition and subtraction. The <a href="multiplicative%20identity">multiplicative identity</a> is 1, that is, multiplying any number by 1 yields that same number. Also, the <a href="multiplicative%20inverse">multiplicative inverse</a> is the <a href="reciprocal%20%28mathematics%29">reciprocal</a> of any number (except 0; 0 is the only number without a multiplicative inverse), that is, multiplying the reciprocal of any number by the number itself yields the multiplicative identity.

The product of "a" and "b" is written as or . When "a" or "b" are expressions not written simply with digits, it is also written by simple juxtaposition: "ab". In computer programming languages and software packages in which one can only use characters normally found on a keyboard, it is often written with an asterisk: 

Division is essentially the inverse of multiplication. Division finds the "quotient" of two numbers, the "dividend" divided by the "divisor". Any dividend <a href="division%20by%200">divided by 0</a> is undefined. For distinct positive numbers, if the dividend is larger than the divisor, the quotient is greater than 1, otherwise it is less than 1 (a similar rule applies for negative numbers). The quotient multiplied by the divisor always yields the dividend.

Division is neither commutative nor associative. As it is helpful to look at subtraction as addition, it is helpful to look at division as multiplication of the dividend times the <a href="multiplicative%20inverse">reciprocal</a> of the divisor, that is When written as a product, it obeys all the properties of multiplication.

<a href="Decimal%20representation">Decimal representation</a> refers exclusively, in common use, to the written <a href="numeral%20system">numeral system</a> employing <a href="arabic%20numerals">arabic numerals</a> as the <a href="numerical%20digit">digits</a> for a <a href="radix">radix</a> <a href="decimal">10 ("decimal")</a> <a href="positional%20notation">positional notation</a>; however, any <a href="numeral%20system">numeral system</a> based on powers of 10, e.g., <a href="Greek%20Numerals">Greek</a>, <a href="Cyrillic%20numerals">Cyrillic</a>, <a href="Roman%20numerals">Roman</a>, or <a href="Chinese%20numerals">Chinese numerals</a> may conceptually be described as "decimal notation" or "decimal representation".

Modern methods for four fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) were first devised by <a href="Brahmagupta">Brahmagupta</a> of India. This was known during medieval Europe as "Modus Indoram" or Method of the Indians. Positional notation (also known as "place-value notation") refers to the representation or encoding of <a href="number">number</a>s using the same symbol for the different <a href="orders%20of%20magnitude">orders of magnitude</a> (e.g., the "ones place", "tens place", "hundreds place") and, with a <a href="radix%20point">radix point</a>, using those same symbols to represent <a href="arithmetic%20fraction">fractions</a> (e.g., the "tenths place", "hundredths place"). For example, 507.36 denotes 5 hundreds (10), plus 0 tens (10), plus 7 units (10), plus 3 tenths (10) plus 6 hundredths (10).

The concept of <a href="Zero">0</a> as a number comparable to the other basic digits is essential to this notation, as is the concept of 0's use as a placeholder, and as is the definition of multiplication and addition with 0. The use of 0 as a placeholder and, therefore, the use of a positional notation is first attested to in the <a href="Jainism">Jain</a> text from <a href="India">India</a> entitled the "<a href="Lokavibh%C3%A2ga">Lokavibhâga</a>", dated 458 AD and it was only in the early 13th century that these concepts, transmitted via the <a href="Mathematics%20in%20medieval%20Islam">scholarship of the Arabic world</a>, were introduced into <a href="Europe">Europe</a> by <a href="Fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> using the <a href="Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic%20numeral%20system">Hindu–Arabic numeral system</a>.

<a href="Algorism">Algorism</a> comprises all of the rules for performing arithmetic computations using this type of written numeral. For example, addition produces the sum of two arbitrary numbers. The result is calculated by the repeated addition of single digits from each number that occupies the same position, proceeding from right to left. An addition table with ten rows and ten columns displays all possible values for each sum. If an individual sum exceeds the value 9, the result is represented with two digits. The rightmost digit is the value for the current position, and the result for the subsequent addition of the digits to the left increases by the value of the second (leftmost) digit, which is always one. This adjustment is termed a "carry" of the value 1.

The process for multiplying two arbitrary numbers is similar to the process for addition. A multiplication table with ten rows and ten columns lists the results for each pair of digits. If an individual product of a pair of digits exceeds 9, the "carry" adjustment increases the result of any subsequent multiplication from digits to the left by a value equal to the second (leftmost) digit, which is any value from (). Additional steps define the final result.

Similar techniques exist for subtraction and division.

The creation of a correct process for multiplication relies on the relationship between values of adjacent digits. The value for any single digit in a numeral depends on its position. Also, each position to the left represents a value ten times larger than the position to the right. In mathematical terms, the <a href="exponentiation">exponent</a> for the <a href="radix">radix</a> (base) of 10 increases by 1 (to the left) or decreases by 1 (to the right). Therefore, the value for any arbitrary digit is multiplied by a value of the form 10 with <a href="integer">integer</a> "n". The list of values corresponding to all possible positions for a single digit is written 

Repeated multiplication of any value in this list by 10 produces another value in the list. In mathematical terminology, this characteristic is defined as <a href="closure%20%28mathematics%29">closure</a>, and the previous list is described as closed under multiplication. It is the basis for correctly finding the results of multiplication using the previous technique. This outcome is one example of the uses of <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>.

Compound unit arithmetic is the application of arithmetic operations to <a href="mixed%20radix">mixed radix</a> quantities such as feet and inches, gallons and pints, pounds shillings and pence, and so on. Prior to the use of decimal-based systems of money and units of measure, the use of compound unit arithmetic formed a significant part of commerce and industry.

The techniques used for compound unit arithmetic were developed over many centuries and are well-documented in many textbooks in many different languages. In addition to the basic arithmetic functions encountered in decimal arithmetic, compound unit arithmetic employs three more functions:

Knowledge of the relationship between the various units of measure, their multiples and their submultiples forms an essential part of compound unit arithmetic.

There are two basic approaches to compound unit arithmetic:

During the 19th and 20th centuries various aids were developed to aid the manipulation of compound units, particularly in commercial applications. The most common aids were mechanical tills which were adapted in countries such as the United Kingdom to accommodate pounds, shillings, pennies and farthings and "Ready Reckoners" – books aimed at traders that catalogued the results of various routine calculations such as the percentages or multiples of various sums of money. One typical booklet that ran to 150 pages tabulated multiples "from one to ten thousand at the various prices from one farthing to one pound".

The cumbersome nature of compound unit arithmetic has been recognized for many years – in 1586, the Flemish mathematician <a href="Simon%20Stevin">Simon Stevin</a> published a small pamphlet called "<a href="De%20Thiende">De Thiende</a>" ("the tenth") in which he declared that the universal introduction of decimal coinage, measures, and weights to be merely a question of time while in the modern era, many conversion programs, such as that embedded in the calculator supplied as a standard part of the Microsoft Windows 7 operating system display compound units in a reduced decimal format rather than using an expanded format (i.e. "2.5 ft" is displayed rather than ).

Until the 19th century, "number theory" was a synonym of "arithmetic". The addressed problems were directly related to the basic operations and concerned <a href="prime%20number">primality</a>, <a href="divisibility">divisibility</a>, and the <a href="Diophantine%20equation">solution of equations in integers</a>, such as <a href="Fermat%27s%20last%20theorem">Fermat's last theorem</a>. It appeared that most of these problems, although very elementary to state, are very difficult and may not be solved without very deep mathematics involving concepts and methods from many other branches of mathematics. This led to new branches of number theory such as <a href="analytic%20number%20theory">analytic number theory</a>, <a href="algebraic%20number%20theory">algebraic number theory</a>, <a href="Diophantine%20geometry">Diophantine geometry</a> and <a href="arithmetic%20algebraic%20geometry">arithmetic algebraic geometry</a>. <a href="Wiles%27%20proof%20of%20Fermat%27s%20Last%20Theorem">Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem</a> is a typical example of the necessity of sophisticated methods, which go far beyond the classical methods of arithmetic, for solving problems that can be stated in elementary arithmetic.

<a href="Primary%20education">Primary education</a> in mathematics often places a strong focus on algorithms for the arithmetic of <a href="natural%20number">natural number</a>s, <a href="integer">integer</a>s, <a href="arithmetic%20fraction">fractions</a>, and <a href="decimal">decimal</a>s (using the decimal place-value system). This study is sometimes known as algorism.

The difficulty and unmotivated appearance of these algorithms has long led educators to question this curriculum, advocating the early teaching of more central and intuitive mathematical ideas. One notable movement in this direction was the <a href="New%20Math">New Math</a> of the 1960s and 1970s, which attempted to teach arithmetic in the spirit of axiomatic development from set theory, an echo of the prevailing trend in higher mathematics.

Also, arithmetic was used by <a href="Ulama">Islamic Scholars</a> in order to teach application of the rulings related to <a href="Zakat">Zakat</a> and <a href="Islamic%20inheritance%20jurisprudence">Irth</a>. This was done in a book entitled "The Best of Arithmetic" by Abd-al-Fattah-al-Dumyati.

The book begins with the foundations of mathematics and proceeds to its application in the later chapters.

Andersonville, Georgia

Andersonville is a city in <a href="Sumter%20County%2C%20Georgia">Sumter County</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, United States. As of the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 census</a>, the city had a population of 255. It is located in the southwest part of the state, approximately southwest of <a href="Macon%2C%20Georgia">Macon</a> on the <a href="Central%20of%20Georgia">Central of Georgia</a> railroad. During the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, it was the site of a <a href="prisoner-of-war%20camp">prisoner-of-war camp</a>, which is now <a href="Andersonville%20National%20Historic%20Site">Andersonville National Historic Site</a>.

Andersonville is part of the <a href="Americus%2C%20Georgia">Americus</a> <a href="Americus%20micropolitan%20area">Micropolitan Statistical Area</a>.

The little hamlet of Anderson was named for John Anderson, a director of the South Western Railroad in 1853 when it was extended from Oglethorpe to Americus. It was known as Anderson Station until the US post office was established in November 1855. The government changed the name of the station from “Anderson” to “Andersonville” in order to avoid confusion with the post office in <a href="Anderson%2C%20South%20Carolina">Anderson, South Carolina</a>.

During the Civil War, the Confederate army established Camp Sumter at Andersonville to house incoming <a href="Union%20Army">Union</a> <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>. The overcrowded <a href="Andersonville%20National%20Historic%20Site">Andersonville Prison</a> was notorious for its bad conditions, and nearly 13,000 prisoners died there.

The town also served as a supply depot during the war period. It included a post office, a depot, a blacksmith shop and stable, a couple of general stores, two saloons, a school, a Methodist church, and about a dozen houses. (Ben Dykes, who owned the land on which the prison was built, was both depot agent and postmaster.)

Until the establishment of the prison, the area was entirely dependent on agriculture, supported by dark reddish brown sandy loams later mapped as Greenville and Red Bay soil series. After the close of the prison and end of the war, the town continued economically dependent on agriculture, primarily the cultivation of cotton as a commodity crop. The town changed very little over the years.

It was not until 1968, when the large-scale mining of <a href="kaolin">kaolin</a>, bauxitic kaolin, and <a href="bauxite">bauxite</a> was begun by Mulcoa, Mullite Company of America, that the town was dramatically altered. This operation exploited of scrub oak wilderness into a massive mining and refining operation. The company now ships more than 2000 tons of refined ore from Andersonville each week.

In 1974, long-time mayor Lewis Easterlin and a group of concerned citizens decided to promote tourism in the town; they stressed its history, redeveloping Main Street to look much as it did during the American Civil War. The city of Andersonville and the <a href="Andersonville%20National%20Historic%20Site">Andersonville National Historic Site</a>, location of the prison camp, welcomes tourists from all over the world.

As of the <a href="census">census</a> of 2000, there were 331 people, 124 households, and 86 families residing in the city. The <a href="population%20density">population density</a> was 254.1 people per square mile (98.3/km²). There were 142 housing units at an average density of 109.0 per square mile (42.2/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 65.26% <a href="Race%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">White</a> and 34.74% <a href="Race%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">African American</a>. <a href="Hispanic%20%28U.S.%20Census%29">Hispanic</a> or <a href="Race%20%28United%20States%20Census%29">Latino</a> of any race were 1.21% of the population.

There were 124 households out of which 34.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.0% were married couples living together, 17.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 30.6% were non-families. 26.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 10.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.67 and the average family size was 3.21.

In the city, the population was spread out with 27.8% under the age of 18, 9.4% from 18 to 24, 31.4% from 25 to 44, 19.3% from 45 to 64, and 12.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females there were 105.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.5 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $29,107, and the median income for a family was $30,972. Males had a median income of $26,591 versus $20,000 for females. The <a href="per%20capita%20income">per capita income</a> for the city was $15,168. About 19.8% of families and 23.0% of the population were below the <a href="poverty%20line">poverty line</a>, including 29.3% of those under age 18 and 13.5% of those age 65 or over.

Amakusa

Amakusa (天草), which means "Heaven's Grass," is a series of islands off the west coast of <a href="Kyushu">Kyushu</a>, the southernmost of the four main islands of <a href="Japan">Japan</a>.

The largest island of the Amakusa group is <a href="Shimoshima%20Island%2C%20Amakusa">Shimoshima</a>, which is 26.5 miles long and 13.5 miles in extreme width ().

It has no high mountains, but its surface is very hilly. Four of the peaks rise to a height of over . The population resorts to the <a href="terrace%20%28agriculture%29">terrace</a> system of <a href="tillage">cultivation</a> to cope with the lack of flat arable land.

Amakusa, along with the neighboring Shimabara Peninsula, became the site of the <a href="Shimabara%20rebellion">Shimabara rebellion</a> in the 17th century, led by Christians. Following the rebellion, <a href="Kakure%20Kirishitan">Kakure Kirishitan</a>, the Christians who had survived, continued to practice their faith in secret, despite massive persecution.

<a href="Amakusa%20pottery">Amakusa pottery</a> has been recognised by the government. The retail company <a href="Muji">Muji</a> brought out its own line of "<a href="Hakuji">Hakuji</a>" home ware, which is produced out of ground translucent Amakusa stones kneaded into clay, using traditional techniques.

Hidenoshin Koyama, who built <a href="Thomas%20Blake%20Glover">Thomas Blake Glover</a>'s House in <a href="Glover%20Garden">Glover Garden</a>, came from this island.

Algebraic closure

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, particularly <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>, an algebraic closure of a <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">field</a> "K" is an <a href="algebraic%20extension">algebraic extension</a> of "K" that is <a href="algebraically%20closed%20field">algebraically closed</a>. It is one of many <a href="closure%20%28mathematics%29">closures</a> in mathematics.

Using <a href="Zorn%27s%20lemma">Zorn's lemma</a> or the weaker <a href="ultrafilter%20lemma">ultrafilter lemma</a>, it can be shown that <a href="%23Existence%20of%20an%20algebraic%20closure%20and%20splitting%20fields">every field has an algebraic closure</a>, and that the algebraic closure of a field "K" is unique <a href="up%20to">up to</a> an <a href="isomorphism">isomorphism</a> that <a href="fixed%20point%20%28mathematics%29">fixes</a> every member of "K". Because of this essential uniqueness, we often speak of "the" algebraic closure of "K", rather than "an" algebraic closure of "K".

The algebraic closure of a field "K" can be thought of as the largest algebraic extension of "K".
To see this, note that if "L" is any algebraic extension of "K", then the algebraic closure of "L" is also an algebraic closure of "K", and so "L" is contained within the algebraic closure of "K".
The algebraic closure of "K" is also the smallest algebraically closed field containing "K",
because if "M" is any algebraically closed field containing "K", then the elements of "M" that are <a href="algebraic%20extension">algebraic over</a> "K" form an algebraic closure of "K".

The algebraic closure of a field "K" has the same <a href="cardinal%20number">cardinality</a> as "K" if "K" is infinite, and is <a href="countably%20infinite">countably infinite</a> if "K" is finite.


Let formula_1 be the set of all monic irreducible polynomials in "K"["x"].
For each formula_2, introduce new variables formula_3 where formula_4.
Let "R" be the polynomial ring over "K" generated by formula_5 for all formula_6 and all formula_7. Write

with formula_9.
Let "I" be the ideal in "R" generated by the formula_10. Since "I" is strictly smaller than "R",
Zorn's lemma implies that there exists a maximal ideal "M" in "R" that contains "I".
The field "K"="R"/"M" has the property that every polynomial formula_11 with coefficients in "K" splits as the product of formula_12 and hence has all roots in "K". In the same way, an extension "K" of "K" can be constructed, etc. The union of all these extensions is the algebraic closure of "K", because any polynomial with coefficients in this new field has its coefficients in some "K" with sufficiently large "n", and then its roots are in "K", and hence in the union itself. 

It can be shown along the same lines that for any subset "S" of "K"["x"], there exists a <a href="splitting%20field">splitting field</a> of "S" over "K".

An algebraic closure "K" of "K" contains a unique <a href="separable%20extension">separable extension</a> "K" of "K" containing all (algebraic) <a href="separable%20extension">separable extension</a>s of "K" within "K". This subextension is called a separable closure of "K". Since a separable extension of a separable extension is again separable, there are no finite separable extensions of "K", of degree > 1. Saying this another way, "K" is contained in a "separably-closed" algebraic extension field. It is unique (<a href="up%20to">up to</a> isomorphism).

The separable closure is the full algebraic closure if and only if "K" is a <a href="perfect%20field">perfect field</a>. For example, if "K" is a field of characteristic "p" and if "X" is transcendental over "K", formula_13 is a non-separable algebraic field extension.

In general, the <a href="absolute%20Galois%20group">absolute Galois group</a> of "K" is the Galois group of "K" over "K".

Advanced Power Management

Advanced power management (APM) is an <a href="Application%20programming%20interface">API</a> developed by <a href="Intel">Intel</a> and <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> and released in 1992 which enables an <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> running an IBM-compatible <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a> to work with the <a href="BIOS">BIOS</a> (part of the computer's <a href="firmware">firmware</a>) to achieve <a href="power%20management">power management</a>.

Revision 1.2 was the last version of the APM specification, released in 1996. <a href="Advanced%20Configuration%20and%20Power%20Interface">ACPI</a> is intended as the successor to APM. Microsoft dropped support for APM in <a href="Windows%20Vista">Windows Vista</a>. The <a href="Linux">Linux kernel</a> still mostly supports APM, with the last fully functional APM support shipping in 3.3.

APM uses a layered approach to manage devices. APM-aware applications (which include device drivers) talk to an OS-specific APM driver. This driver communicates to the APM-aware BIOS, which controls the hardware. There is the ability to opt out of APM control on a device-by-device basis, which can be used if a driver wants to communicate directly with a hardware device.

Communication occurs both ways; power management events are sent from the BIOS to the APM driver, and the APM driver sends information and requests to the BIOS via function calls. In this way the APM driver is an intermediary between the BIOS and the operating system.

Power management happens in two ways; through the above-mentioned function calls from the APM driver to the BIOS requesting power state changes, and automatically based on device activity.

There are 12 power events (such as standby, suspend and resume requests, and low battery notifications), plus <a href="Original%20equipment%20manufacturer">OEM</a>-defined events, that can be sent from the APM BIOS to the operating system. The APM driver regularly <a href="Polling%20%28computer%20science%29">polls</a> for event change notifications.

Power Management Events:
Power management functions:
There are 21 APM function calls defined that the APM driver can use to query power management statuses, or request power state transitions. Example function calls include letting the BIOS know about current CPU usage (the BIOS may respond to such a call by placing the CPU in a low-power state, or returning it to its full-power state), retrieving the current power state of a device, or requesting a power state change.

The APM specification defines system power states and device power states.

APM defines five power states for the computer system:

APM also defines power states that APM-aware hardware can implement. There is no requirement that an APM-aware device implement all states.

The four states are:

The CPU core (defined in APM as the CPU clock, <a href="CPU%20cache">cache</a>, <a href="Front%20side%20bus">system bus</a> and system timers) is treated specially in APM, as it is the last device to be powered down, and the first device to be powered back up. The CPU core is always controlled through the APM BIOS (there is no option to control it through a driver). Drivers can use APM function calls to notify the BIOS about CPU usage, but it is up to the BIOS to act on this information; a driver cannot directly tell the CPU to go into a power saving state.

Adolphe began to make his own instruments at an early age, entering two of his <a href="flute">flute</a>s and a <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a> into a competition at the age of 15. He subsequently studied performance on those two instruments as well as voice at the <a href="Royal%20Conservatory%20of%20Brussels">Royal Conservatory of Brussels</a>.

Sax faced many near-death experiences. Over the course of his childhood, he:


His mother once said that "he's a child condemned to misfortune; he won't live." His neighbors called him "little Sax, the ghost"..

After leaving the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, Sax began to experiment with new instrument designs, while his parents continued to make conventional instruments to bring in money. Adolphe's first important invention was an improvement of the <a href="bass%20clarinet">bass clarinet</a> design, which he patented at the age of 24. Sax relocated permanently to <a href="Paris">Paris</a> in 1841 and began working on a new set of instruments which he exhibited there in 1844. These were valved <a href="Bugle%20%28instrument%29">bugles</a>, and although he had not invented the instrument itself, his examples were much more successful than those of his rivals and became known as <a href="saxhorn">saxhorn</a>s. They came in seven different sizes, and paved the way for the creation of the <a href="flugelhorn">flugelhorn</a>. Today, saxhorns are sometimes used in <a href="concert%20band">concert band</a>s and <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a>s. The saxhorn also laid the groundwork for the modern <a href="euphonium">euphonium</a>.

Sax also developed the "<a href="saxotromba">saxotromba</a>" family, valved brass instruments with narrower bore than the saxhorns, in 1845, though they survived only briefly.

The use of saxhorns spread rapidly. The saxhorn valves were accepted as state-of-the-art in their time and remain largely unchanged today. The advances made by Adolphe Sax were soon followed by the <a href="Brass%20band%20%28British%20style%29">British brass band</a> movement which exclusively adopted the saxhorn family of instruments. The Jedforest Instrumental Band formed in 1854 and The Hawick Saxhorn Band formed in 1855, within the <a href="Scottish%20Borders">Scottish Borders</a>, a decade after saxhorn models became available.

The period around 1840 saw Sax inventing the "clarinette-bourdon", an early unsuccessful design of <a href="contrabass%20clarinet">contrabass clarinet</a>. Around this time he also developed the instrument for which he is best known: the <a href="saxophone">saxophone</a> which he patented on 28 June 1846. The saxophone was invented for use in both orchestras and military bands. By 1846 Sax had designed (on paper at least) a full range of saxophones (from <a href="Sopranino%20saxophone">sopranino</a> to <a href="Subcontrabass%20saxophone">subcontrabass</a>). Composer <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Hector Berlioz</a> wrote approvingly of the new instrument in 1842, but despite his support, saxophones never became standard orchestral instruments. However, their ability to play technical passages easily like <a href="woodwind%20instruments">woodwinds</a> and also project loudly like <a href="brass%20instruments">brass instruments</a> led them to be included in <a href="military%20bands">military bands</a> in France and elsewhere. The saxophone was Sax's signature accomplishment and created his reputation more than any other. This helped secure him a job teaching at the <a href="Paris%20Conservatory">Paris Conservatory</a> in 1857.

Sax continued to make instruments later in life and presided over the new saxophone program at the Paris Conservatory. Rival instrument makers both attacked the legitimacy of his patents and were sued by Sax for patent infringement. The legal back-and-forth continued for over 20 years. He was driven into bankruptcy twice: in 1856 and again in 1873.

Sax suffered from lip cancer between 1853 and 1858 but made a full recovery. In 1894 Sax died in complete poverty in Paris and was interred in section 5 (Avenue de Montebello) at the <a href="Montmartre%20Cemetery">Cimetière de Montmartre</a> in Paris.

Aspirated consonant

In <a href="phonetics">phonetics</a>, aspiration is the strong burst of <a href="breathing">breath</a> that accompanies either the release or, in the case of <a href="preaspiration">preaspiration</a>, the closure of some <a href="obstruent">obstruent</a>s. In English, aspirated consonants are <a href="allophone">allophone</a>s in <a href="complementary%20distribution%23In%20phonology">complementary distribution</a> with their unaspirated counterparts, but in some other languages, notably most <a href="Languages%20of%20India">Indian</a> and <a href="East%20Asian%20languages">East Asian languages</a>, the difference is <a href="Contrastive%20distribution%23Phonology">contrastive</a>, while in <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> and <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>, all stops are aspirated.

To feel or see the difference between aspirated and unaspirated sounds, one can put a hand or a lit candle in front of one's mouth, and say "spin" and then "pin" . One should either feel a puff of air or see a flicker of the candle flame with "pin" that one does not get with "spin".

In the <a href="International%20Phonetic%20Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a> (IPA), aspirated consonants are written using the symbols for <a href="voicelessness">voiceless consonants</a> followed by the <a href="Phonetic%20symbols%20in%20Unicode%23Spacing%20Modifier%20Letters%20%28U%2B02B0%E2%80%9302FF%29">aspiration modifier letter</a> , a <a href="subscript%20and%20superscript">superscript form</a> of the symbol for the <a href="voiceless%20glottal%20fricative">voiceless glottal fricative</a> . For instance, represents the voiceless <a href="bilabial%20stop">bilabial stop</a>, and represents the aspirated bilabial stop.

<a href="Voice%20%28phonetics%29">Voiced consonants</a> are seldom actually aspirated. Symbols for <a href="voice%20%28phonetics%29">voiced consonants</a> followed by , such as , typically represent consonants with <a href="murmured%20voice">murmured voice</a>d release (see <a href="%23Breathy-voiced%20release">below</a>). In the <a href="shiksha">grammatical tradition</a> of <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, aspirated consonants are called voiceless aspirated, and breathy-voiced consonants are called voiced aspirated.

There are no dedicated IPA symbols for degrees of aspiration and typically only two degrees are marked: unaspirated and aspirated . <a href="Obsolete%20and%20nonstandard%20symbols%20in%20the%20International%20Phonetic%20Alphabet">An old symbol</a> for light aspiration was , but this is now obsolete. The aspiration modifier letter may be doubled to indicate especially strong or long aspiration. Hence, the two degrees of aspiration in Korean stops are sometimes transcribed or and , but they are usually transcribed and , with the details of voice-onset time given numerically.

Preaspirated consonants are marked by placing the aspiration modifier letter before the consonant symbol: represents the preaspirated bilabial stop.

Unaspirated or <a href="tenuis%20consonant">tenuis consonant</a>s are occasionally marked with the modifier letter for unaspiration , a <a href="Unicode%20subscripts%20and%20superscripts">superscript</a> <a href="equals%20sign">equals sign</a>: . Usually, however, unaspirated consonants are left unmarked: .

<a href="Voicelessness">Voiceless consonants</a> are produced with the <a href="vocal%20folds">vocal folds</a> open (spread) and not vibrating, and voiced consonants are produced when the vocal folds are fractionally closed and vibrating (<a href="modal%20voice">modal voice</a>). Voiceless aspiration occurs when the vocal cords remain open after a consonant is released. An easy way to measure this is by noting the consonant's <a href="voice-onset%20time">voice-onset time</a>, as the voicing of a following vowel cannot begin until the vocal cords close.

Phonetically in some languages, such as <a href="Navajo%20phonology">Navajo</a>, aspiration of stops tends to be realised as voiceless velar airflow; aspiration of affricates is realised as an extended length of the frication.

Aspirated consonants are not always followed by vowels or other voiced sounds. For example, in <a href="Eastern%20Armenian">Eastern Armenian</a>, aspiration is contrastive even word-finally, and aspirated consonants occur in <a href="consonant%20cluster">consonant cluster</a>s. In <a href="Wahgi%20language">Wahgi</a>, consonants are aspirated only in final position.

The degree of aspiration varies: the voice-onset time of aspirated stops is longer or shorter depending on the language or the place of articulation.

Armenian and <a href="Cantonese">Cantonese</a> have aspiration that lasts about as long as English aspirated stops, in addition to unaspirated stops. Korean has lightly aspirated stops that fall between the Armenian and Cantonese unaspirated and aspirated stops as well as strongly aspirated stops whose aspiration lasts longer than that of Armenian or Cantonese. (See <a href="voice-onset%20time">voice-onset time</a>.)

Aspiration varies with <a href="place%20of%20articulation">place of articulation</a>. The Spanish voiceless stops have voice-onset times (VOTs) of about 5, 10, and 30 milliseconds, whereas English aspirated have VOTs of about 60, 70, and 80 ms. Voice-onset time in Korean has been measured at 20, 25, and 50 ms for and 90, 95, and 125 for .

When aspirated consonants are doubled or <a href="gemination">geminated</a>, the stop is held longer and then has an aspirated release. An aspirated affricate consists of a stop, fricative, and aspirated release. A doubled aspirated affricate has a longer hold in the stop portion and then has a release consisting of the fricative and aspiration.

<a href="Icelandic%20language">Icelandic</a> and <a href="Faroese%20language">Faroese</a> have consonants with <a href="preaspiration">preaspiration</a> , and some scholars interpret them as consonant clusters as well. In Icelandic, preaspirated stops contrast with double stops and single stops (see :

Preaspirated stops also occur in most <a href="Sami%20languages">Sami languages</a>. For example, in <a href="Northern%20Sami">Northern Sami</a>, the unvoiced stop and affricate phonemes , , , , are pronounced preaspirated (, , , ) in medial or final position.

Although most aspirated obstruents in the world's languages are stops and affricates, <a href="aspirated%20fricative">aspirated fricative</a>s such as , or have been documented in <a href="Korean%20language">Korean</a>, in a few <a href="Tibeto-Burman%20languages">Tibeto-Burman languages</a>, in some <a href="Oto-Manguean%20languages">Oto-Manguean languages</a>, and in the Siouan language <a href="Ofo%20language">Ofo</a>. Some languages, such as <a href="Choni%20language">Choni Tibetan</a>, have up to four contrastive aspirated fricatives , and .

True aspirated voiced consonants, as opposed to <a href="murmured">murmured</a> (breathy-voice) consonants such as the that are common in the languages of India, are extremely rare. They have been documented in <a href="Kelabit%20language">Kelabit</a> <a href="Taa%20language">Taa</a>, and the <a href="Kx%27a%20languages">Kx'a languages</a>. Reported aspirated voiced stops, affricates and clicks are .

Aspiration has varying significance in different languages. It is either allophonic or phonemic, and may be analyzed as an <a href="underlying%20representation">underlying</a> consonant cluster.

In some languages, such as English, aspiration is <a href="allophone">allophonic</a>. Stops are distinguished primarily by <a href="voice%20%28phonetics%29">voicing</a>, and voiceless stops are sometimes aspirated, while voiced stops are usually unaspirated.

<a href="English%20language">English</a> <a href="voiceless">voiceless</a> <a href="stop%20consonant">stop</a>s are aspirated for most native speakers when they are word-initial or begin a <a href="stressed%20syllable">stressed syllable</a>, as in "pill", "till", "kill".

They are unaspirated for almost all speakers when immediately following word-initial s, as in "spill", "still", "skill". After an "s" elsewhere in a word they are normally unaspirated as well, except sometimes in compound words. When the consonants in a cluster like "st" are analyzed as belonging to different morphemes (<a href="wikt%3Aheteromorphemic">heteromorphemic</a>) the stop is aspirated, but when they are analyzed as belonging to one morpheme the stop is unaspirated. For instance, "distend" has unaspirated since it is not analyzed as two morphemes, but "distaste" has an aspirated middle because it is analyzed as "dis-" + "taste" and the word "taste" has an aspirated initial "t".

Word-final voiceless stops are sometimes aspirated.

Voiceless stops in <a href="Pashto">Pashto</a> are slightly aspirated prevocalically in a stressed syllable.

In many languages, such as <a href="Armenian%20language">Armenian</a>, <a href="Korean%20language">Korean</a>, <a href="Thai%20language">Thai</a>, <a href="Indo-Aryan%20languages">Indo-Aryan languages</a>, <a href="Dravidian%20languages">Dravidian languages</a>, <a href="Icelandic%20language">Icelandic</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>, and the <a href="varieties%20of%20Chinese">varieties of Chinese</a>, tenuis and aspirated consonants are <a href="phoneme">phonemic</a>. Unaspirated consonants like and aspirated consonants like are separate phonemes, and words <a href="distinctive%20feature">are distinguished</a> by whether they have one or the other.

<a href="Alemannic%20German">Alemannic German dialects</a> have unaspirated as well as aspirated ; the latter series are usually viewed as <a href="consonant%20cluster">consonant cluster</a>s.

In <a href="Danish%20language">Danish</a> and most southern varieties of <a href="German%20language">German</a>, the <a href="Fortis%20and%20lenis">lenis</a> consonants transcribed for historical reasons as are distinguished from their <a href="Fortis%20and%20lenis">fortis</a> counterparts , mainly in their lack of aspiration.

<a href="French%20language">French</a>, Standard <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a>, <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a>, <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>, <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>, <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, Modern Greek, and <a href="Latvian%20language">Latvian</a> are languages that do not have phonemic aspirated consonants.

<a href="Standard%20Chinese">Standard Chinese</a> (Mandarin) has stops and affricates distinguished by aspiration: for instance, , . In <a href="pinyin">pinyin</a>, tenuis stops are written with letters that represent voiced consonants in English, and aspirated stops with letters that represent voiceless consonants. Thus "d" represents , and "t" represents .

<a href="Wu%20Chinese">Wu Chinese</a> and <a href="Southern%20Min">Southern Min</a> has a three-way distinction in stops and affricates: . In addition to aspirated and unaspirated consonants, there is a series of "muddy consonants", like . These are pronounced with <a href="slack%20voice">slack</a> or <a href="breathy%20voice">breathy voice</a>: that is, they are weakly voiced. Muddy consonants as <a href="Syllable%23Chinese">initial</a> cause a syllable to be pronounced with low pitch or <a href="four%20tones%20%28Middle%20Chinese%29">"light" (陽 "yáng") tone</a>.

Many <a href="Indo-Aryan%20languages">Indo-Aryan languages</a> have aspirated stops. <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, <a href="Hindustani%20language">Hindi</a>, <a href="Bengali%20language">Bengali</a>, <a href="Marathi%20language">Marathi</a>, and <a href="Gujarati%20language">Gujarati</a> have a four-way distinction in stops: voiceless, aspirated, voiced, and breathy-voiced or voiced aspirated, such as . <a href="Punjabi%20language">Punjabi</a> has lost breathy-voiced consonants, which resulted in a <a href="tone%20%28linguistics%29">tone system</a>, and therefore has a distinction between voiceless, aspirated, and voiced: .

Some of the <a href="Dravidian%20languages">Dravidian languages</a>, such as <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a>, <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a>, <a href="Malayalam">Malayalam</a>, and <a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada</a>, have a distinction between voiced and voiceless, aspirated and unaspirated only in <a href="Indo-Aryan%20loanwords%20in%20Tamil">loanwords from Indo-Aryan languages</a>. In native Dravidian words, there is no distinction between these categories and stops are <a href="underspecification">underspecified</a> for voicing and aspiration.

Most dialects of <a href="Armenian%20language">Armenian</a> have aspirated stops, and some have breathy-voiced stops.

<a href="Classical%20Armenian">Classical</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Armenian">Eastern Armenian</a> have a three-way distinction between voiceless, aspirated, and voiced, such as .

<a href="Western%20Armenian">Western Armenian</a> has a two-way distinction between aspirated and voiced: . Western Armenian aspirated corresponds to Eastern Armenian aspirated and voiced , and Western voiced corresponds to Eastern voiceless .

Some forms of <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> before the <a href="Koine%20Greek">Koine Greek</a> period are <a href="linguistic%20reconstruction">reconstructed</a> as having aspirated stops. The <a href="Attic%20Greek">Classical Attic dialect</a> of <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> had a three-way distinction in stops like Eastern Armenian: . These series were called , , ("psilá, daséa, mésa") "smooth, rough, intermediate", respectively, by Koine Greek grammarians.

There were aspirated stops at three places of articulation: labial, coronal, and velar . Earlier Greek, represented by <a href="Mycenaean%20Greek">Mycenaean Greek</a>, likely had a labialized velar aspirated stop , which later became labial, coronal, or velar depending on dialect and phonetic environment.

The other Ancient Greek dialects, <a href="Ionic%20Greek">Ionic</a>, <a href="Doric%20Greek">Doric</a>, <a href="Aeolic%20Greek">Aeolic</a>, and <a href="Arcadocypriot%20Greek">Arcadocypriot</a>, likely had the same three-way distinction at one point, but Doric seems to have had a fricative in place of in the Classical period, and the Ionic and Aeolic dialects sometimes lost aspiration (<a href="psilosis">psilosis</a>).

Later, during the Koine Greek period, the aspirated and voiced stops of Attic Greek <a href="Lenition%23Opening">lenited</a> to voiceless and voiced fricatives, yielding in <a href="Medieval%20Greek">Medieval</a> and <a href="Modern%20Greek">Modern Greek</a>.

The term "aspiration" sometimes refers to the sound change of <a href="debuccalization">debuccalization</a>, in which a consonant is <a href="lenition">lenited</a> (weakened) to become a <a href="glottal%20stop">glottal stop</a> or <a href="voiceless%20glottal%20fricative">fricative</a> .

So-called voiced aspirated consonants are nearly always pronounced instead with <a href="breathy%20voice">breathy voice</a>, a type of <a href="phonation">phonation</a> or vibration of the <a href="vocal%20folds">vocal folds</a>. The modifier letter after a voiced consonant actually represents a breathy-voiced or murmured dental stop, as with the "voiced aspirated" bilabial stop in the <a href="Indo-Aryan%20languages">Indo-Aryan languages</a>. This consonant is therefore more accurately transcribed as , with the diacritic for breathy voice, or with the modifier letter , a superscript form of the symbol for the <a href="voiced%20glottal%20fricative">voiced glottal fricative</a> .

Some linguists restrict the double-dot subscript to murmured <a href="sonorant">sonorant</a>s, such as <a href="vowel">vowel</a>s and <a href="nasal%20consonant">nasal</a>s, which are murmured throughout their duration, and use the superscript hook-aitch for the breathy-voiced release of obstruents.

Arteriovenous malformation

Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an abnormal connection between <a href="Artery">arteries</a> and <a href="vein">vein</a>s, bypassing the <a href="capillary%20system">capillary system</a>. This <a href="vascular%20anomaly">vascular anomaly</a> is widely known because of its occurrence in the <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a> (usually <a href="cerebral%20arteriovenous%20malformation">cerebral AVM</a>), but can appear in any location. Although many AVMs are asymptomatic, they can cause intense pain or bleeding or lead to other serious medical problems.

AVMs are usually <a href="congenital">congenital</a> and belong to the <a href="RASopathy">RASopathies</a>.
The genetic transmission patterns of AVM, if any, are unknown. AVM is not generally thought to be an inherited disorder, unless in the context of a specific hereditary <a href="syndrome">syndrome</a>.

Symptoms of AVM vary according to the location of the malformation. Roughly 88% of people with an AVM are asymptomatic; often the malformation is discovered as part of an <a href="autopsy">autopsy</a> or during treatment of an unrelated disorder (called in medicine an "incidental finding"); in rare cases, its expansion or a micro-bleed from an AVM in the brain can cause epilepsy, neurological deficit, or pain.

The most general symptoms of a cerebral AVM include <a href="headache">headache</a>s and <a href="epilepsy">epileptic seizures</a>, with more specific symptoms occurring that normally depend on the location of the malformation and the individual. Such possible symptoms include:


Cerebral AVMs may present themselves in a number of different ways:


In the lungs, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations have no symptoms in up to 29% of all cases.

Can occur due to autosomal dominant diseases, such as <a href="hereditary%20hemorrhagic%20telangiectasia">hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia</a>.

Arteries and veins are part of the <a href="Circulatory%20system">human cardiovascular system</a>. Arteries carry blood away from the heart to the lungs or the rest of the body, where the blood passes through capillaries, and veins return the blood to the heart. An AVM interferes with this process by forming a direct connection of the arteries and veins. AVMs can cause intense pain and lead to serious medical problems. Although AVMs are often associated with the brain and spinal cord, they can develop in any part of the body.

Normally, the arteries in the vascular system carry oxygen-rich blood, except in the case of the pulmonary artery. Structurally, arteries divide and sub-divide repeatedly, eventually forming a sponge-like <a href="capillary%20bed">capillary bed</a>. Blood moves through the <a href="Capillary">capillaries</a>, giving up oxygen and taking up waste products, including , from the surrounding cells. Capillaries in turn successively join together to form veins that carry blood away. The heart acts to pump blood through arteries and uptake the venous blood.

An AVM lacks the dampening effect of capillaries on the blood flow, which means that the AVM can get progressively larger over time as the amount of blood flowing through it increases, forcing the heart to work harder to keep up with the extra blood flow. It also causes the surrounding area to be deprived of the functions of the capillaries—removal of and delivery of nutrients to the cells. The resulting tangle of blood vessels, often called a "nidus" (Latin for "nest"), has no capillaries. It can be extremely fragile and prone to bleeding because of the abnormally direct connections between high-pressure arteries and low-pressure veins. The resultant sign, audible via stethoscope, is a rhythmic, whooshing sound caused by excessively rapid blood flow through the arteries and veins. It has been given the term "bruit", French for noise. On some occasions, a patient with a brain AVM may become aware of the noise, which can compromise hearing and interfere with sleep in addition to causing psychological distress.

AVMs are diagnosed primarily by the following methods:

AVMs can occur in various parts of the body:

AVMs may occur in isolation or as a part of another disease (for example, <a href="Von%20Hippel-Lindau%20disease">Von Hippel-Lindau disease</a> or <a href="hereditary%20hemorrhagic%20telangiectasia">hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia</a>).

AVMs have been shown to be associated with <a href="aortic%20stenosis">aortic stenosis</a>.

Bleeding from an AVM can be relatively mild or devastating. It can cause severe and less often fatal <a href="stroke">stroke</a>s. If a cerebral AVM is detected before a stroke occurs, usually the arteries feeding blood into the nidus can be closed off to avert the danger. However, interventional therapy may also be relatively risky. 
Treatment for brain AVMs can be symptomatic, and patients should be followed by a neurologist for any seizures, headaches, or focal neurologic deficits. AVM-specific treatment may also involve endovascular embolization, neurosurgery or radiosurgery.
Embolization, that is, cutting off the blood supply to the AVM with coils, particles, acrylates, or polymers introduced by a radiographically guided catheter, may be used in addition to neurosurgery or radiosurgery, but is rarely successful in isolation except in smaller AVMs. Gamma knife may also be used.

The estimated detection rate of AVM in the US general population is 1.4/100,000 per year. This is approximately one fifth to one seventh the incidence of intracranial aneurysms. An estimated 300,000 Americans have AVMs, of whom 12% (approximately 36,000) will exhibit symptoms of greatly varying severity.

Emmanuel, Luschka, and Virchow first described arteriovenous malformations in the mid-1800s. Olivecrona performed the first surgical excision of an intracranial AVM in 1932.



Despite many years of research, the central question of whether to treat AVMs has not been answered. All treatments, whether involving surgery, radiation, or drugs, have risks and side-effects. Therefore, it might be better in some cases to avoid treatment altogether and simply accept a small risk of coming to harm from the AVM itself. This question is currently being addressed in clinical trials.

Atlanta has topographic features that include rolling hills and <a href="Atlanta%20tree%20canopy">dense tree coverage</a>. <a href="Smart%20growth">Revitalization</a> of Atlanta's neighborhoods, initially spurred by the <a href="1996%20Summer%20Olympics">1996 Olympics</a> in Atlanta, has intensified in the 21st century, altering the city's demographics, politics, and culture.

Prior to the arrival of European settlers in north Georgia, <a href="Creek%20%28people%29">Creek Indians</a> inhabited the area. <a href="Standing%20Peachtree">Standing Peachtree</a>, a Creek village located where <a href="Peachtree%20Creek">Peachtree Creek</a> flows into the <a href="Chattahoochee%20River">Chattahoochee River</a>, was the closest Indian settlement to what is now Atlanta. As part of the systematic removal of Native Americans from northern Georgia from 1802 to 1825, the Creek ceded the area in 1821, and white settlers arrived the following year.

In 1836, the <a href="Georgia%20General%20Assembly">Georgia General Assembly</a> voted to build the <a href="Western%20and%20Atlantic%20Railroad">Western and Atlantic Railroad</a> in order to provide a link between the port of <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah</a> and the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwest</a>. The initial route was to run southward from <a href="Chattanooga%2C%20Tennessee">Chattanooga</a> to a terminus east of the Chattahoochee River, which would then be linked to Savannah. After engineers surveyed various possible locations for the terminus, the "zero milepost" was driven into the ground in what is now <a href="Five%20Points%20%28Atlanta%29">Five Points</a>. A year later, the area around the milepost had developed into a settlement, first known as "Terminus," and later as "Thrasherville" after a local merchant who built homes and a <a href="general%20store">general store</a> in the area. By 1842, the town had six buildings and 30 residents and was renamed "<a href="Marthasville%2C%20Georgia">Marthasville</a>" to honor the <a href="Wilson%20Lumpkin">Governor's</a> daughter. Later, <a href="J.%20Edgar%20Thomson">J. Edgar Thomson</a>, Chief Engineer of the <a href="Georgia%20Railroad">Georgia Railroad</a>, suggested the town be renamed "<a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantica</a>-<a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacifica</a>," which was shortened to "Atlanta". The residents approved, and the town was incorporated as Atlanta on December 29, 1847.

By 1860, Atlanta's population had grown to 9,554. During the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, the nexus of multiple railroads in Atlanta made the city a hub for the distribution of military supplies. In 1864, the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> moved southward following the capture of Chattanooga and began its <a href="Atlanta%20campaign">invasion of north Georgia</a>. The region surrounding Atlanta was the location of several major army <a href="battle">battle</a>s, culminating with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Atlanta">Battle of Atlanta</a> and a four-month-long siege of the city by the Union Army under the command of General <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">William Tecumseh Sherman</a>. On September 1, 1864, <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> General <a href="John%20Bell%20Hood">John Bell Hood</a> made the decision to retreat from Atlanta, and he ordered the destruction of all public buildings and possible assets that could be of use to the Union Army. On the next day, Mayor <a href="James%20Calhoun">James Calhoun</a> surrendered Atlanta to the Union Army, and on September 7, Sherman ordered the city's civilian population to evacuate. On November 11, 1864, Sherman prepared for the Union Army's <a href="Sherman%27s%20March%20to%20the%20Sea">March to the Sea</a> by ordering Atlanta to be burned to the ground, sparing only the city's churches and hospitals.

After the Civil War ended in 1865, Atlanta was gradually rebuilt. Due to the city's superior <a href="rail%20transportation">rail transportation</a> network, the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20historical%20capitals">state capital</a> was moved from <a href="Milledgeville%2C%20Georgia">Milledgeville</a> to Atlanta in 1868. In the 1880 Census, Atlanta surpassed Savannah as Georgia's largest city.
Beginning in the 1880s, <a href="Henry%20W.%20Grady">Henry W. Grady</a>, the editor of the "<a href="Atlanta%20Constitution">Atlanta Constitution</a>" newspaper, promoted Atlanta to potential investors as a city of the "<a href="New%20South">New South</a>" that would be based upon a modern economy and less reliant on agriculture. By 1885, the founding of the Georgia School of Technology (now <a href="History%20of%20Georgia%20Tech">Georgia Tech</a>) and the <a href="Atlanta%20University%20Center">city's black colleges</a> had established Atlanta as a center for higher education. In 1895, Atlanta hosted the <a href="Cotton%20States%20and%20International%20Exposition">Cotton States and International Exposition</a>, which attracted nearly 800,000 attendees and successfully promoted the New South's development to the world.

During the first decades of the 20th century, Atlanta experienced a period of unprecedented growth. In three decades' time, Atlanta's population tripled as the city limits expanded to include nearby streetcar suburbs. The city's skyline emerged with the construction of the <a href="Equitable%20Building%20%28Atlanta%201892%29">Equitable</a>, <a href="Flatiron%20Building%20%28Atlanta%29">Flatiron</a>, <a href="J.%20Mack%20Robinson%20College%20of%20Business%20Administration%20Building">Empire</a>, and <a href="Candler%20Building%20%28Atlanta%29">Candler</a> buildings; and <a href="Sweet%20Auburn">Sweet Auburn</a> emerged as a center of black commerce. The period was also marked by strife and tragedy. Increased racial tensions led to the <a href="Atlanta%20Race%20Riot">Atlanta Race Riot</a> of 1906, which left at least 27 people dead and over 70 injured. In 1915, <a href="Leo%20Frank">Leo Frank</a>, a Jewish-American factory superintendent, convicted of murder, was hanged in <a href="Marietta%2C%20Georgia">Marietta</a> by a <a href="Lynching">lynch mob</a>, drawing attention to <a href="antisemitism%20in%20the%20United%20States">antisemitism in the United States</a>. On May 21, 1917, the <a href="Great%20Atlanta%20Fire%20of%201917">Great Atlanta Fire</a> destroyed 1,938 buildings in what is now the <a href="Old%20Fourth%20Ward">Old Fourth Ward</a>, resulting in one fatality and the displacement of 10,000 people.

On December 15, 1939, Atlanta hosted the <a href="premiere">premiere</a> of "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Gone with the Wind</a>", the epic film based on the best-selling novel by Atlanta's <a href="Margaret%20Mitchell">Margaret Mitchell</a>. The gala event at <a href="Loew%27s%20Grand%20Theatre">Loew's Grand Theatre</a> was attended by the film's legendary producer, <a href="David%20O.%20Selznick">David O. Selznick</a>, and the film's stars <a href="Clark%20Gable">Clark Gable</a>, <a href="Vivien%20Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>, and <a href="Olivia%20de%20Havilland">Olivia de Havilland</a>, but Oscar winner <a href="Hattie%20McDaniel">Hattie McDaniel</a>, an African American actress, was barred from the event due to racial segregation laws and policies.

Atlanta played a vital role in the Allied effort during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> due to the city's war-related manufacturing companies, railroad network and military bases, leading to rapid population and economic growth. In the 1950s, the city's newly constructed highway system allowed middle class Atlantans the ability to relocate to the suburbs. As a result, the city began to make up an ever-smaller proportion of the metropolitan area's population.

During the 1960s, Atlanta was a major organizing center of the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>, with Dr. <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, <a href="Ralph%20David%20Abernathy">Ralph David Abernathy</a>, and students from Atlanta's <a href="historically%20black%20colleges%20and%20universities">historically black colleges and universities</a> playing major roles in the movement's leadership. While minimal compared to other cities, Atlanta was not free of racial strife. In 1961, the city attempted to thwart <a href="blockbusting">blockbusting</a> by erecting road barriers in <a href="Cascade%20Heights">Cascade Heights</a>, countering the efforts of civic and business leaders to foster Atlanta as the "city too busy to hate". Desegregation of the public sphere came in stages, with public transportation desegregated by 1959, the restaurant at <a href="Rich%27s%20%28department%20store%29">Rich's</a> department store by 1961, movie theaters by 1963, and public schools by 1973.

In 1960, whites comprised 61.7% of the city's population. By 1970, African Americans were a majority of the city's population and exercised new-found political influence by electing Atlanta's first black mayor, <a href="Maynard%20Jackson">Maynard Jackson</a>, in 1973. Under Mayor Jackson's tenure, Atlanta's airport was modernized, solidifying the city's role as a transportation center. The opening of the <a href="Georgia%20World%20Congress%20Center">Georgia World Congress Center</a> in 1976 heralded Atlanta's rise as a convention city. Construction of the city's <a href="Metropolitan%20Atlanta%20Rapid%20Transit%20Authority">subway system</a> began in 1975, with rail service commencing in 1979. Despite these improvements, Atlanta lost over 100,000 residents between 1970 and 1990, over 20% of its population.

Atlanta was selected as the site for the <a href="1996%20Summer%20Olympic%20Games">1996 Summer Olympic Games</a>. Following the <a href="Bids%20for%20the%201996%20Summer%20Olympics">announcement</a>, the city government undertook several major construction projects to improve Atlanta's parks, sporting venues, and transportation infrastructure. While the games themselves were marred by numerous organizational inefficiencies as well as the <a href="Centennial%20Olympic%20Park%20bombing">Centennial Olympic Park bombing</a>, the spectacle was a watershed event in Atlanta's history that initiated a fundamental transformation of the city in the decade that followed.

During the 2000s, Atlanta underwent a profound physical, <a href="human%20culture">cultural</a>, and <a href="demographics">demographic</a> transformation. Suburbanization, a booming economy, and new migrants decreased the city's black percentage from a high of 67% in 1990 to 54% in 2010. From 2000 to 2010, Atlanta gained 22,763 white residents, 5,142 Asian residents, and 3,095 Hispanic residents, while the city's black population decreased by 31,678. Much of the city's demographic change during the decade was driven by young, college-educated professionals: from 2000 to 2009, the <a href="Intown%20Atlanta">three-mile radius</a> surrounding <a href="Downtown%20Atlanta">Downtown Atlanta</a> gained 9,722 residents aged 25 to 34 holding at least a four-year degree, an increase of 61%. Between the mid-1990s and 2010, stimulated by funding from the <a href="HOPE%20VI">HOPE VI</a> program, Atlanta demolished nearly all of its public housing, a total of 17,000 units and about 10% of all housing units in the city. In 2005, the $2.8 billion <a href="BeltLine">BeltLine</a> project was adopted, with the stated goals of converting a disused 22-mile freight railroad loop that surrounds the central city into an art-filled multi-use trail and increasing the city's park space by 40%. Atlanta's cultural offerings expanded during the 2000s: the <a href="High%20Museum%20of%20Art">High Museum of Art</a> doubled in size; the <a href="Alliance%20Theatre">Alliance Theatre</a> won a <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a>; and art galleries were established on the once-industrial <a href="West%20Midtown">Westside</a>.

Atlanta encompasses , of which is land and is water. The city is situated among the foothills of the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a>, and at above mean sea level, Atlanta has one of the highest elevations among major cities east of the Mississippi River. Atlanta straddles the <a href="Eastern%20Continental%20Divide">Eastern Continental Divide</a>, such that rainwater that falls on the south and east side of the divide flows into the Atlantic Ocean, while rainwater on the north and west side of the divide flows into the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. Atlanta sits atop a <a href="ridge">ridge</a> south of the <a href="Chattahoochee%20River">Chattahoochee River</a>, which is part of the <a href="ACF%20River%20Basin">ACF River Basin</a>. Located at the far northwestern edge of the city, much of the river's natural habitat is preserved, in part by the <a href="Chattahoochee%20River%20National%20Recreation%20Area">Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area</a>.

Most of Atlanta was burned during the Civil War, depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architecture. Yet architecturally, the city had never been particularly "southern"—because Atlanta originated as a railroad town, rather than a <a href="Aristocracy%20%28class%29">patrician</a> southern seaport like <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah</a> or <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a>, many of the city's landmarks could have easily been erected in the Northeast or Midwest.

During the Cold War era, Atlanta embraced global modernist trends, especially regarding commercial and institutional architecture. Examples of <a href="modern%20architecture">modernist architecture</a> include the <a href="Westin%20Peachtree%20Plaza">Westin Peachtree Plaza</a> (1976), <a href="Georgia-Pacific%20Tower">Georgia-Pacific Tower</a> (1982), the <a href="State%20of%20Georgia%20Building">State of Georgia Building</a> (1966), and the <a href="Atlanta%20Marriott%20Marquis">Atlanta Marriott Marquis</a> (1985). In the latter half of the 1980s, Atlanta became one of the early adopters of postmodern designs that reintroduced classical elements to the cityscape. Many of Atlanta's tallest skyscrapers were built in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with most displaying tapering spires or otherwise ornamented crowns, such as the <a href="One%20Atlantic%20Center">One Atlantic Center</a> (1987), <a href="191%20Peachtree%20Tower">191 Peachtree Tower</a> (1991), and the <a href="Four%20Seasons%20Hotel%20Atlanta">Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta</a> (1992). Also completed during the era is Atlanta's tallest skyscraper, the <a href="Bank%20of%20America%20Plaza%20%28Atlanta%29">Bank of America Plaza</a> (1992), which, at , is the <a href="List%20of%20tallest%20buildings%20in%20the%20world">61st-tallest building in the world</a> and the 9th-tallest building in the United States. The Bank of America Plaza is the tallest building outside of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, and was the last building built in the United States to be in the top 10 tallest buildings in the world until <a href="One%20World%20Trade%20Center">One World Trade Center</a> was completed externally in May 2013. The city's embrace of modern architecture translated into an ambivalent approach toward historic preservation, leading to the destruction of notable architectural landmarks, including the <a href="Equitable%20Building%20%28Atlanta%201892%29">Equitable Building</a> (1892–1971), <a href="Terminal%20Station%20%28Atlanta%29">Terminal Station</a> (1905–1972), and the <a href="Atlanta-Fulton%20Public%20Library%20System%23The%20Carnegie%20Library">Carnegie Library</a> (1902–1977). The <a href="Fox%20Theatre%20%28Atlanta%2C%20Georgia%29">Fox Theatre</a> (1929)—Atlanta's cultural icon—would have met the same fate had it not been for a grassroots effort to save it in the mid-1970s.

Atlanta is divided into 242 officially defined <a href="Neighborhoods%20of%20Atlanta">neighborhoods</a>. The city contains three major high-rise districts, which form a north-south axis along <a href="Peachtree%20Street">Peachtree</a>: <a href="Downtown%20Atlanta">Downtown</a>, <a href="Midtown%20Atlanta">Midtown</a>, and <a href="Buckhead%20%28Atlanta%29">Buckhead</a>. Surrounding these high-density districts are leafy, low-density neighborhoods, most of which are dominated by single-family homes.

Downtown Atlanta contains the most office space in the metro area, much of it occupied by government entities. Downtown is home to the city's sporting venues and many of its tourist attractions. <a href="Midtown%20Atlanta">Midtown Atlanta</a> is the city's second-largest business district, containing the offices of many of the region's law firms. Midtown is known for its art institutions, cultural attractions, institutions of higher education, and dense form. <a href="Buckhead%20%28Atlanta%29">Buckhead</a>, the city's uptown district, is north of Downtown and the city's third-largest business district. The district is marked by an urbanized core along <a href="Peachtree%20Street">Peachtree Road</a>, surrounded by suburban single-family neighborhoods situated among dense forests and rolling hills.

Surrounding Atlanta's three high-rise districts are the city's low- and medium-density <a href="Neighborhoods%20of%20Atlanta">neighborhoods</a>, where the <a href="American%20Craftsman">craftsman</a> <a href="bungalow">bungalow</a> single-family home is dominant. The <a href="Eastside%20%28Atlanta%29">eastside</a> is marked by historic <a href="streetcar%20suburbs">streetcar suburbs</a> built from the 1890s-1930s as havens for the upper middle class. These neighborhoods, many of which contain their own villages encircled by shaded, architecturally-distinct residential streets, include the <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian</a> <a href="Inman%20Park">Inman Park</a>, <a href="Bohemianism">Bohemian</a> <a href="East%20Atlanta">East Atlanta</a>, and eclectic <a href="Old%20Fourth%20Ward">Old Fourth Ward</a>. On the <a href="West%20Midtown">westside</a> and along the <a href="BeltLine">BeltLine</a> on the <a href="Eastside%2C%20Atlanta">eastside</a>, former warehouses and factories have been converted into housing, retail space, and art galleries, transforming the once-industrial areas such as <a href="West%20Midtown">West Midtown</a> into model neighborhoods for <a href="smart%20growth">smart growth</a>, historic rehabilitation, and infill construction. In southwest Atlanta, neighborhoods closer to downtown originated as streetcar suburbs, including the historic <a href="West%20End%20%28Atlanta%29">West End</a>, while those farther from downtown retain a postwar suburban layout, including <a href="Collier%20Heights">Collier Heights</a> and <a href="Cascade%20Heights">Cascade Heights</a>, home to much of the city's affluent African American population. Northwest Atlanta contains the areas of the city to west of Marietta Boulevard and to the north of Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive, including those neighborhoods remote to downtown, such as Riverside, Bolton and Whittier Mill, which is one of Atlanta's designated Landmark Historical Neighborhoods. Vine City, though technically Northwest, adjoins the city's Downtown area and has recently been the target of community outreach programs and economic development initiatives.

Gentrification of the city's neighborhoods is one of the more controversial and transformative forces shaping contemporary Atlanta. The <a href="gentrification%20of%20Atlanta">gentrification of Atlanta</a> has its origins in the 1970s, after many of Atlanta's neighborhoods had undergone the urban decay that affected other major American cities in the mid-20th century. When neighborhood opposition successfully prevented two <a href="Interstate%20485%20%28Georgia%29">freeways</a> from being built through city's the east side in 1975, the area became the starting point for Atlanta's <a href="gentrification">gentrification</a>. After Atlanta was awarded the Olympic games in 1990, gentrification expanded into other parts of the city, stimulated by infrastructure improvements undertaken in preparation for the games. Gentrification was aided by the <a href="Atlanta%20Housing%20Authority">Atlanta Housing Authority</a>'s eradication of the city's public housing.

Under the <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen classification</a>, Atlanta has a <a href="humid%20subtropical%20climate">humid subtropical climate</a> ("Cfa") with four distinct seasons and generous precipitation year-round, typical for the inland <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a>. Summers are hot and humid, with temperatures somewhat moderated by the city's elevation. Winters are cool but variable, with an average of 48 freezing days per year and temperatures dropping to on rare occasions. Warm air from the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> can bring spring-like highs while strong Arctic air masses can push lows into the teens (≤ −7 °C).

July averages , with high temperatures reaching on an average 44 days per year, though readings are not seen most years. January averages , with temperatures in the suburbs slightly cooler due largely to the <a href="urban%20heat%20island">urban heat island</a> effect. Lows at or below freezing can be expected 40 nights annually, but extended stretches with daily high temperatures below are very rare, with a recent exception in <a href="Early%202014%20North%20American%20cold%20wave">January 2014</a>. Extremes range from on <a href="Great%20Blizzard%20of%201899">February 13, 1899</a> to on <a href="Summer%202012%20North%20American%20heat%20wave">June 30, 2012</a>. Dewpoints in the summer range from in June to in July.

Typical of the southeastern U.S., Atlanta receives abundant rainfall that is evenly distributed throughout the year, though spring and early fall are markedly drier. The average annual rainfall is , while snowfall is typically light at around per year. The heaviest single snowfall occurred on January 23, 1940, with around of snow. However, <a href="ice%20storm">ice storm</a>s usually cause more problems than snowfall does, the most severe occurring on January 7, 1973. Tornadoes are rare in the city itself, but the <a href="2008%20Atlanta%20tornado%20outbreak">March 14, 2008</a> <a href="Enhanced%20Fujita%20scale">EF2</a> <a href="tornado">tornado</a> damaged prominent structures in downtown Atlanta.

The <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 United States Census</a> reported that Atlanta had a population of 420,003. The <a href="population%20density">population density</a> was 3,154 per <a href="square%20mile">square mile</a> (1232/<a href="square%20kilometer">km</a>). The racial makeup and population of Atlanta was 54.0% Black or African American, 38.4% White, 3.1% Asian and 0.2% Native American. Those from some other race made up 2.2% of the city's population, while those from two or more races made up 2.0%. Hispanics of any race made up 5.2% of the city's population. The median income for a household in the city was $45,171. The per capita income for the city was $35,453. 22.6% percent of the population was living below the <a href="Poverty%20threshold">poverty line</a>. Atlanta has one of the highest <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> populations per capita, ranking third among major American cities, behind San Francisco and slightly behind <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, with 12.8% of the city's total population identifying as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. 7.3% of Atlantans were born abroad (<a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20cities%20by%20foreign-born%20population">86th</a> in the US).
In the 2010 Census, Atlanta was recorded as the nation's fourth-largest majority-black city. It has long been known as a center of African-American political power, education, and culture, often called a <a href="black%20mecca">black mecca</a>. <a href="African%20Americans%20in%20Atlanta">African-American residents of Atlanta</a> have followed whites to newer housing in the suburbs in the early 21st century. From 2000 to 2010, the city's black population decreased by 31,678 people, shrinking from 61.4% of the city's population in 2000 to 54.0% in 2010.

At the same time, the white population of Atlanta has increased. Between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of whites in the city's population grew faster than that of any other U.S. city. In that decade, Atlanta's white population grew from 31% to 38% of the city's population, an absolute increase of 22,753 people, more than triple the increase that occurred between 1990 and 2000.

Out of the total population five years and older, 83.3% spoke only English at home, while 8.8% spoke Spanish, 3.9% another Indo-European language, and 2.8% an Asian language. Atlanta's dialect has traditionally been a variation of <a href="Southern%20American%20English">Southern American English</a>. The <a href="Chattahoochee%20River">Chattahoochee River</a> long formed a border between the <a href="Southern%20American%20English%23Dialects">Coastal Southern</a> and <a href="Southern%20American%20English%23Dialects">Southern Appalachian</a> dialects. Because of the development of corporate headquarters in the region, attracting migrants from other areas of the country, by 2003, "<a href="Atlanta%20%28magazine%29">Atlanta</a>" magazine concluded that Atlanta had become significantly "de-Southernized." A Southern accent was considered a handicap in some circumstances. In general, Southern accents are less prevalent among residents of the city and inner suburbs and among younger people; they are more common in the outer suburbs and among older people. At the same time, some residents of the city express Southern variations of <a href="African%20American%20Vernacular%20English">African American Vernacular English</a>.

<a href="Religion%20in%20Atlanta">Religion in Atlanta</a>, while historically centered on <a href="Protestant%20Christianity">Protestant Christianity</a>, now involves many faiths as a result of the city and metro area's increasingly international population. Protestant Christianity still maintains a strong presence in the city (63%), but in recent decades the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Atlanta">Catholic Church</a> has increased in numbers and influence because of new migrants in the region. Metro Atlanta also has numerous ethnic or national Christian congregations, including Korean and Indian churches. The larger non-Christian faiths are Judaism, Islam and Hinduism. Overall, there are over 1,000 places of worship within Atlanta.

With a GDP of $304 billion, the <a href="Atlanta%20metropolitan%20area">Metro Atlanta</a> economy is the <a href="List%20of%20cities%20by%20GDP">eighth-largest in the country and 17th-largest in the world</a>. Corporate operations play a major role in the economy, as the city claims the country's third-largest concentration of <a href="Fortune%20500">Fortune 500</a> companies, and hosts the global headquarters of corporations such as <a href="The%20Coca-Cola%20Company">The Coca-Cola Company</a>, <a href="The%20Home%20Depot">The Home Depot</a>, <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a>, <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Mobility">AT&T Mobility</a>, <a href="Chick-fil-A">Chick-fil-A</a>, and <a href="United%20Parcel%20Service">UPS</a>.

Atlanta is an important rail junction and contains major <a href="classification%20yard">classification yard</a>s for <a href="Norfolk%20Southern">Norfolk Southern</a> and <a href="CSX%20Transportation">CSX</a>. Since its construction in the 1950s, <a href="Hartsfield-Jackson%20Atlanta%20International%20Airport">Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport</a> has served as a key engine of Atlanta's economic growth. Delta Air Lines, the city's largest employer and the metro area's third-largest, operates the world's largest airline hub at Hartsfield-Jackson and has helped make it the <a href="world%27s%20busiest%20airport">world's busiest airport</a>, both in terms of passenger traffic and aircraft operations. Partly due to the airport, Atlanta has become a hub for diplomatic missions; , the city contains <a href="List%20of%20diplomatic%20missions%20in%20Atlanta">26 consulates general</a>, the seventh-highest concentration of diplomatic missions in the United States.

Media is also an important aspect of Atlanta's economy.

Information technology companies are drawn to Atlanta's lower costs and educated workforce.

Recently, Atlanta has become a <a href="Arts%20in%20Atlanta%23Film%20and%20television">center for film and television production</a>, largely due to the <a href="Georgia%20Department%20of%20Economic%20Development%23Georgia%20Entertainment%20Industry%20Investment%20Act">Georgia Entertainment Industry Investment Act</a>, which awards qualified productions a transferable income tax credit of 20% of all in-state costs for film and television investments of $500,000 or more.

From 2010 to 2011, Atlanta saw a 0.9% contraction in employment and only a 0.4% rise in income. Though unemployment had dropped to 7% by late 2014, this was still higher than the national unemployment rate of 5.8% Atlanta's housing market has struggled, with home prices falling by 2.1% in January 2012, reaching levels not seen since 1996. Compared with a year earlier, the average home price in Atlanta fell 17.3% in February 2012, the largest annual drop in the history of the index for any city. The collapse in home prices has led some economists to deem Atlanta the worst housing market in the country.

Atlanta is a city located in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">South</a> that has a culture which is extremely dynamic. This is due to a large population of migrants from other parts of the U.S., in addition to many recent <a href="Immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">immigrants to the U.S.</a> who have made the metropolitan area their home, establishing Atlanta as the cultural and economic hub of an increasingly <a href="Multi-culturalism">multi-cultural</a> metropolitan area.

Due to the more than 30 colleges and universities located in the city, Atlanta is considered a center for higher education. The <a href="Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> is one of the most prominent public universities in Atlanta; it is a research university located in <a href="Midtown%20Atlanta">Midtown</a> that has been consistently ranked among the nation's top ten public universities for its degree programs in engineering, computing, management, the sciences, architecture, and liberal arts. <a href="Georgia%20State%20University">Georgia State University</a> is a major public research university located in <a href="Downtown%20Atlanta">Downtown Atlanta</a>; it is the largest of the 29 public colleges and universities in the <a href="University%20System%20of%20Georgia">University System of Georgia</a> and is a significant contributor to the revitalization of the city's central business district. Atlanta is home to nationally renowned private colleges and universities, most notably <a href="Emory%20University">Emory University</a>, a leading liberal arts and research institution that ranks among the top 20 schools in the United States and operates <a href="Emory%20Healthcare">Emory Healthcare</a>, the largest health care system in <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>.

Fifty-five thousand students are enrolled in 106 schools in <a href="Atlanta%20Public%20Schools">Atlanta Public Schools</a>, some of which are operated as charter schools. The district has been plagued by a widely publicized <a href="Atlanta%20Public%20Schools%20cheating%20scandal">cheating scandal</a> that was exposed in 2009. Atlanta is served by many private schools, including parochial Roman Catholic schools operated by the <a href="Archdiocese%20of%20Atlanta">Archdiocese of Atlanta</a>.

The primary network-affiliated television stations in Atlanta are <a href="WXIA-TV">WXIA-TV</a> (NBC), <a href="WGCL-TV">WGCL-TV</a> (CBS), <a href="WSB-TV">WSB-TV</a> (ABC), and <a href="WAGA-TV">WAGA-TV</a> (FOX). The Atlanta metropolitan area is served by two public television stations and one public radio station. <a href="WGTV">WGTV</a> is the flagship station of the statewide <a href="Georgia%20Public%20Television">Georgia Public Television</a> network and is a <a href="Public%20Broadcast%20Service">PBS</a> member station, while <a href="WPBA%20%28TV%29">WPBA</a> is owned by <a href="Atlanta%20Public%20Schools">Atlanta Public Schools</a>. Georgia Public Radio is listener-funded and comprises one <a href="NPR">NPR</a> member station, <a href="WABE">WABE</a>, a classical music station operated by <a href="Atlanta%20Public%20Schools">Atlanta Public Schools</a>.

Atlanta is served by the "<a href="Atlanta%20Journal-Constitution">Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>", its only major daily newspaper with wide distribution. The "Atlanta Journal-Constitution" is the result of a 1950 merger between "The Atlanta Journal" and "The Atlanta Constitution", with staff consolidation occurring in 1982 and separate publication of the morning "Constitution" and afternoon "Journal" ceasing in 2001. <a href="Alternative%20weekly">Alternative weekly</a> newspapers include "<a href="Creative%20Loafing%20%28Atlanta%29">Creative Loafing</a>", which has a weekly print circulation of 80,000. "<a href="Atlanta%20%28magazine%29">Atlanta</a>" magazine is an award-winning, monthly general-interest magazine based in and covering Atlanta.

Atlanta's transportation infrastructure comprises a complex network that includes a <a href="heavy%20rail">heavy rail</a> <a href="rapid%20transit">rapid transit</a> system, a light rail <a href="streetcar">streetcar</a> loop, a multi-county bus system, <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> service via the <a href="Crescent%20%28train%29">Crescent</a>, multiple freight train lines, an <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a>, several airports, including the world's busiest, and over of bike paths.

Atlanta has a network of freeways that radiate out from the city, and automobiles are the dominant means of transportation in the region. Three major <a href="interstate%20highways">interstate highways</a> converge in Atlanta: <a href="Interstate%2020">I-20</a> (east-west), <a href="Interstate%2075">I-75</a> (northwest-southeast), and <a href="Interstate%2085">I-85</a> (northeast-southwest). The latter two combine in the middle of the city to form the <a href="Downtown%20Connector">Downtown Connector</a> (I-75/85), which carries more than 340,000 vehicles per day and is one of the most congested segments of interstate highway in the United States. Atlanta is mostly encircled by <a href="Interstate%20285">Interstate 285</a>, a <a href="beltway">beltway</a> locally known as "the Perimeter" that has come to mark the boundary between "Inside the Perimeter" (ITP), the city and close-in suburbs, and "Outside the Perimeter" (OTP), the outer suburbs and exurbs. The heavy reliance on automobiles for transportation in Atlanta has resulted in traffic, commute, and air pollution rates that rank among the worst in the country.

The <a href="Metropolitan%20Atlanta%20Rapid%20Transit%20Authority">Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority</a> (MARTA) provides public transportation in the form of buses and heavy rail. Notwithstanding heavy automotive usage in Atlanta, the city's <a href="rapid%20transit">subway</a> system is the <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Rapid%20Transit%20systems%20by%20Ridership">eighth busiest in the country</a>. MARTA rail lines connect key destinations, such as the airport, Downtown, Midtown, Buckhead, and Perimeter Center. However, significant destinations, such as Emory University and <a href="Cumberland%2C%20Georgia">Cumberland</a>, remain unserved. As a result, a 2011 <a href="Brookings%20Institution">Brookings Institution</a> study placed Atlanta 91st of 100 metro areas for transit accessibility. <a href="Emory%20University">Emory University</a> operates its <a href="The%20Cliff%20%28Emory%29">Cliff</a> shuttle buses with 200,000 boardings per month, while private <a href="minibus">minibus</a>es supply <a href="Buford%20Highway">Buford Highway</a>. <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a>, the national rail passenger system, provides service to Atlanta via the "<a href="Crescent%20%28train%29">Crescent train</a>" (New York–New Orleans), which stops at <a href="Peachtree%20Station">Peachtree Station</a>. In 2014, the <a href="Atlanta%20Streetcar">Atlanta Streetcar</a> opened to the public. The streetcar's line, which is also known as the Downtown Loop, runs 2.7 miles around the downtown tourist areas of <a href="Peachtree%20Center">Peachtree Center</a>, <a href="Centennial%20Olympic%20Park">Centennial Olympic Park</a>, the <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.%20National%20Historic%20Site">Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site</a>, and Sweet Auburn. The Atlanta Streetcar line is also being expanded on in the coming years to include a wider range of Atlanta's neighborhoods and important places of interest, with a total of over 50 miles of track in the plan.

<a href="Hartsfield-Jackson%20Atlanta%20International%20Airport">Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport</a> is the world's busiest airport as measured by <a href="World%27s%20busiest%20airports%20by%20passenger%20traffic">passenger traffic</a> and <a href="World%27s%20busiest%20airports%20by%20traffic%20movements">aircraft traffic</a>.

Situated () south of downtown, the airport covers most of the land inside a wedge formed by <a href="Interstate%2075">Interstate 75</a>, <a href="Interstate%2085">Interstate 85</a>, and <a href="Interstate%20285">Interstate 285</a>.

<a href="Cycling%20in%20Atlanta">Cycling</a> is a growing mode of transportation in Atlanta, more than doubling since 2009, when it comprised 1.1% of all commutes (up from 0.3% in 2000). Although Atlanta's lack of bike lanes and hilly topography may deter many residents from cycling, the city's transportation plan calls for the construction of of bike lanes by 2020, with the BeltLine helping to achieve this goal. In 2012, Atlanta's first "bike track" was constructed on 10th Street in Midtown. The two lane bike track runs from Monroe Drive west to Charles Allen Drive, with connections to the Beltline and Piedmont Park. Starting in June 2016, Atlanta received a bike sharing program with 100 bikes in Downtown and Midtown, which expanded to 500 bikes at 65 stations as of April 2017.

Atlanta has a reputation as a "city in a forest" due to an abundance of trees that is rare among major cities. The city's <a href="Peachtree%20Street">main street</a> is named after a <a href="Peach">tree</a>, and beyond the Downtown, Midtown, and Buckhead business districts, the skyline gives way to a dense canopy of woods that spreads into the suburbs. The city is home to the <a href="Atlanta%20Dogwood%20Festival">Atlanta Dogwood Festival</a>, an annual arts and crafts festival held one weekend during early April, when the native <a href="Cornus%20%28genus%29">dogwoods</a> are in bloom. The nickname is factually accurate, as the city's tree coverage percentage is at 36%, the highest out of all major American cities, and above the national average of 27%. Atlanta's tree coverage does not go unnoticed—it was the main reason cited by "<a href="National%20Geographic%20%28magazine%29">National Geographic</a>" in naming Atlanta a "Place of a Lifetime".

The city's lush tree canopy, which filters out pollutants and cools sidewalks and buildings, has increasingly been under assault from man and nature due to heavy rains, drought, aged forests, new pests, and urban construction. A 2001 study found that Atlanta's heavy tree cover declined from 48% in 1974 to 38% in 1996. Community organizations and the city government are addressing the problem. <a href="Trees%20Atlanta">Trees Atlanta</a>, a non-profit organization founded in 1985, has planted and distributed over 75,000 shade trees in the city, and Atlanta's government has awarded $130,000 in grants to neighborhood groups to plant trees.

Atlanta has 17 sister cities, as designated by <a href="Sister%20Cities%20International">Sister Cities International</a>, Inc. (SCI):

Axiology

Axiology (from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> , "axia", "value, worth"; and , "<a href="wiktionary%3A-logia">-logia</a>") is the <a href="Philosophy">philosophical</a> study of <a href="value%20%28ethics%29">value</a>. It is either the collective term for <a href="ethics">ethics</a> and <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a>, philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of worth, or the foundation for these fields, and thus similar to <a href="value%20theory">value theory</a> and <a href="meta-ethics">meta-ethics</a>. The term was first used by Paul Lapie, in 1902, and <a href="Eduard%20von%20Hartmann">Eduard von Hartmann</a>, in 1908.

Axiology studies mainly two kinds of values: <a href="ethics">ethics</a> and <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a>. Ethics investigates the concepts of "right" and "good" in individual and social conduct. Aesthetics studies the concepts of "beauty" and "harmony." Formal axiology, the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with <a href="mathematical%20rigor">mathematical rigor</a>, is exemplified by <a href="Robert%20S.%20Hartman">Robert S. Hartman</a>'s <a href="science%20of%20value">science of value</a>.

Between the 5th and 6th century BC, it was important in Greece to be knowledgeable if you were to be successful. Philosophers began to recognize that differences existed between the laws and morality of society. <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a> held the belief that knowledge had a vital connection to virtue, making morality and democracy closely intertwined. <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>' student, <a href="Plato">Plato</a> furthered the belief by establishing virtues which should be followed by all. With the fall of the government, values became individual, causing skeptic schools of thought to flourish, ultimately shaping a pagan philosophy that is thought to have influenced and shaped Christianity. During the medieval times, <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> argued for a separation between natural and religious virtues. This concept led philosophers to distinguish between judgments based on fact and judgments based on values, creating division between science and philosophy.

Communication theorists seek to contribute to mutual intelligence about the anatomy and operation of human communication. The axiological issues that are significant for the evolution of communication theory are whether research can be truly free of value and whether the end for the administered research should be designed to expand knowledge or to change society. For communication theorists, a primary interest is with the philosophical establishment of the research approach. A continuing value debate occurs between scholars who comply with a conventional scientific approach and those who take an <a href="Interactionism">interpretivist</a> approach to communication development.

Those who take a conventional scientific approach believe that research must be free of values in order to be valid. Therefore, it is necessary for the scientist to approach their research in a neutral and objective manner. In contrast, the interpretivists argue that it is impossible for research to be completely free of personal values, as research is always biased towards the values of the researcher. According to interpretivists, these <a href="Bias">biases</a> are sometimes so entrenched in the researcher's culture that they will most likely go unnoticed during research. Since no one can truly be unbiased, some groups are more knowledgeable about certain things than other groups due to their positions in society, and they can be considered more qualified to perform research on certain topics as a result.

A Doll's House

A Doll's House (; also translated as "A Doll House") is a three-act play written by <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a>. It premiered at the <a href="Royal%20Danish%20Theatre">Royal Theatre</a> in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, Denmark, on 21 December 1879, having been published earlier that month. The play is set in a Norwegian town circa 1879.

The play is significant for the way it deals with the fate of a married woman, who at the time in Norway lacked reasonable opportunities for self-fulfillment in a male dominated world. It aroused a great sensation at the time, and caused a “storm of outraged controversy” that went beyond the theatre to the world newspapers and society.

In 2006, the centennial of Ibsen's death, "A Doll's House" held the distinction of being the world's most performed play for that year. <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> has inscribed Ibsen's autographed manuscripts of "A Doll's House" on the <a href="Memory%20of%20the%20World%20Register">Memory of the World Register</a> in 2001, in recognition of their historical value.

The title of the play is most commonly translated as "A Doll's House", though some scholars use "A Doll House". <a href="John%20Simon%20%28critic%29">John Simon</a> says that "A Doll’s House" is "the British term for what we call a 'dollhouse'". <a href="Egil%20T%C3%B6rnqvist">Egil Törnqvist</a> says of the alternative title: "Rather than being superior to the traditional rendering, it simply sounds more idiomatic to Americans."


The play opens at Christmas time as Nora Helmer enters her home carrying a number of packages. Nora's husband Torvald is working in his study when she arrives. He playfully rebukes her for spending so much money on Christmas gifts, calling her his "little squirrel". He teases her about how she spent weeks making gifts and ornaments by hand last year because money was scarce. This year Torvald is due a promotion at the bank where he works, so Nora feels that they can let themselves go a little. The maid announces two visitors: Mrs. Kristine Linde, an old friend of Nora's, who has come seeking employment, and Dr. Rank, a close friend of the family, who is let into the study. Kristine has had a difficult few years, ever since her husband died leaving her with no money or children. Nora explains that things have not been easy for them either: Torvald became sick and they had to travel to Italy so he could recover. Kristine further explains that when her mother was ill, she had to take care of her brothers, but now that they are grown she feels her life is "unspeakably empty". Nora promises to talk to Torvald about finding her a job. Kristine gently tells Nora that she is like a child. Nora is offended, so she reveals that she borrowed money from "some admirer", so they could travel to Italy to improve Torvald's health. She told Torvald that her father gave her the money, but in fact she managed to illegally borrow it without his knowledge. Over the years, she has been secretly working and saving up to pay it off.

Krogstad, a lower-level employee at Torvald's bank, arrives and goes into the study. Nora is clearly uneasy when she sees him. Dr. Rank leaves the study and mentions that he feels wretched, though, like everyone, he wants to go on living. In contrast to his physical illness, he says that the man in the study, Krogstad, is "morally diseased".

After the meeting with Krogstad, Torvald comes out of the study. Nora asks him if he can give Kristine a position at the bank and Torvald is very positive, saying that this is a fortunate moment, as a position has just become available. Torvald, Kristine, and Dr. Rank leave the house, leaving Nora alone. The nanny returns with the children and Nora plays with them for a while until Krogstad creeps into the living room and surprises her. Krogstad tells Nora that Torvald intends to fire him at the bank and asks her to intercede with Torvald to allow him to keep his job. She refuses and Krogstad threatens to blackmail her about the loan she took out for the trip to Italy; he knows that she obtained this loan by forging her father's signature. Krogstad leaves and when Torvald returns, she tries to convince him not to fire Krogstad. Torvald refuses to hear her pleas, explaining that Krogstad is a liar and a hypocrite and that he committed a terrible crime: he forged someone's name. Torvald feels physically ill in the presence of a man "poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation".

Kristine arrives to help Nora repair a dress for a costume function that Torvald and she plan to attend the next day. Torvald returns from the bank, and Nora pleads with him to reinstate Krogstad, claiming she is worried Krogstad will publish libelous articles about Torvald and ruin his career. Torvald dismisses her fears and explains that, although Krogstad is a good worker and seems to have turned his life around, he must be fired because he is not deferential enough to Torvald in front of other bank personnel. Torvald then retires to his study to work.

Dr. Rank, the family friend, arrives. Nora asks him for a favor, but Rank responds by revealing that he has entered the terminal stage of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> of the spine and that he has always been secretly in love with her. Nora tries to deny the first revelation and make light of it, but is more disturbed by his declaration of love. She tries clumsily to tell him that she is not in love with him, but that she loves him dearly as a friend.

Desperate after being fired by Torvald, Krogstad arrives at the house. Nora convinces Dr. Rank to go into Torvald's study so he will not see Krogstad. When Krogstad confronts Nora, he declares that he no longer cares about the remaining balance of Nora's loan, but that he will instead preserve the associated <a href="Bond%20%28finance%29">bond</a> to blackmail Torvald into not only keeping him employed but also promoting him. Nora explains that she has done her best to persuade her husband, but he refuses to change his mind. Krogstad informs Nora that he has written a letter detailing her crime (forging her father's signature of <a href="surety">surety</a> on the bond) and put it in Torvald's mailbox, which is locked.

Nora tells Kristine of her difficult situation. Having had a relationship with Krogstad in the past before her marriage, Kristine says that they are still in love and promises to try to convince him to relent.

Torvald enters and tries to retrieve his mail, but Nora distracts him by begging him to help her with the dance she has been rehearsing for the costume party, feigning anxiety about performing. She dances so badly and acts so childishly that Torvald agrees to spend the whole evening coaching her. When the others go to dinner, Nora stays behind for a few minutes and contemplates killing herself to save her husband from the shame of the revelation of her crime and to pre-empt any gallant gesture on his part to save her reputation.

Kristine tells Krogstad that she only married her husband because she had no other means to support her sick mother and young siblings and that she has returned to offer him her love again. She believes that he would not have stooped to unethical behavior if he had not been devastated by her abandonment and been in dire financial straits. Krogstad is moved and offers to take back his letter to Torvald. However, Kristine decides that Torvald should know the truth for the sake of his and Nora's marriage.

After literally dragging Nora home from the party, Torvald goes to check his mail, but is interrupted by Dr. Rank, who has followed them. Dr. Rank chats for a while, conveying obliquely to Nora that this is a final goodbye, as he has determined that his death is near. Dr. Rank leaves, and Torvald retrieves his letters. As he reads them, Nora steels herself to take her life. Torvald confronts her with Krogstad's letter. Enraged, he declares that he is now completely in Krogstad's power – he must yield to Krogstad's demands and keep quiet about the whole affair. He berates Nora, calling her a dishonest and immoral woman and telling her that she is unfit to raise their children. He says that from now on their marriage will be only a matter of appearances.

A maid enters, delivering a letter to Nora. The letter is from Krogstad, yet Torvald demands to read the letter, taking it from Nora. Torvald exults that he is saved, as Krogstad has returned the incriminating bond, which Torvald immediately burns along with Krogstad's letters. He takes back his harsh words to his wife and tells her that he forgives her. Nora realizes that her husband is not the strong and gallant man she thought he was, and that he truly loves himself more than he does her.

Torvald explains that, when a man has forgiven his wife, it makes him love her all the more, since it reminds him that she is totally dependent on him, like a child. He dismisses the fact that Nora had to make the agonizing choice between her conscience and his health, and ignores her years of secret efforts to free them from the ensuing obligations and the danger of loss of reputation. He preserves his peace of mind by thinking of the incident as a mere mistake that she made owing to her dumbness, one of her most endearing feminine traits.

Nora tells Torvald that she is leaving him, and in a confrontational scene between the two of them, she expresses her reasons and explanations. She reminds him of harsh things he has said about her and about her ability to raise their children. She says he has never loved her, they have become strangers to each other. She feels betrayed by his response to the scandal involving Krogstad, and she says she must get away to understand herself. She has lost her religion. She says that she has been treated like a doll to play with for her whole life, first by her father and then by him. Concerned for the family reputation, Torvald insists that she fulfill her duty as a wife and mother, but Nora says that she has duties to herself that are just as important, and that she cannot be a good mother or wife without learning to be more than a plaything. She reveals that she had expected that he would want to sacrifice his reputation for hers and that she had planned to kill herself to prevent him from doing so. She now realizes that Torvald is not at all the kind of person she had believed him to be and that their marriage has been based on mutual fantasies and misunderstandings.

Torvald is unable to comprehend Nora's point of view, since it contradicts all that he has been taught about the female mind throughout his life. Furthermore, he is so narcissistic that it is impossible for him to understand how he appears to her, as selfish, hypocritical, and more concerned with public reputation than with actual morality. Nora leaves her keys and wedding ring, and as Torvald breaks down and begins to cry, baffled by what has happened, Nora leaves the house, slamming the door behind herself. Whether or not she ever comes back is never made clear.

Ibsen's German agent felt that the original ending would not play well in German theatres; therefore, for it to be considered acceptable, Ibsen was forced to write an alternative ending for the German premiere. In this ending, Nora is led to her children after having argued with Torvald. Seeing them, she collapses, and the curtain is brought down. Ibsen later called the ending a disgrace to the original play and referred to it as a "barbaric outrage". Virtually all productions today use the original ending, as do nearly all of the film versions of the play.

"A Doll's House" was based on the life of <a href="Laura%20Kieler">Laura Kieler</a> (maiden name Laura Smith Petersen), a good friend of Ibsen. Much that happened between Nora and Torvald happened to Laura and her husband, Victor. Similar to the events in the play, Laura signed an illegal loan to save her husband. She wanted the money to find a cure for her husband's tuberculosis. She wrote to Ibsen, asking for his recommendation of her work to his publisher, thinking that the sales of her book would repay her debt. At his refusal, she forged a check for the money. At this point she was found out. In real life, when Victor discovered about Laura's secret loan, he divorced her and had her committed to an asylum. Two years later, she returned to her husband and children at his urging, and she went on to become a well-known Danish author, living to the age of 83.

Ibsen wrote "A Doll's House" at the point when Laura Kieler had been committed to the asylum, and the fate of this friend of the family shook him deeply, perhaps also because Laura had asked him to intervene at a crucial point in the scandal, which he did not feel able or willing to do. Instead, he turned this life situation into an aesthetically shaped, successful drama. In the play, Nora leaves Torvald with head held high, though facing an uncertain future given the limitations single women faced in the society of the time.

Kieler eventually rebounded from the shame of the scandal and had her own successful writing career while remaining discontented with sole recognition as "Ibsen's Nora" years afterwards.

Ibsen started thinking about the play around May 1878, although he did not begin its first draft until a year later, having reflected on the themes and characters in the intervening period (he visualised its <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a>, Nora, for instance, as having approached him one day wearing "a blue woollen dress"). He outlined his conception of the play as a "modern <a href="tragedy">tragedy</a>" in a note written in Rome on 19 October 1878. "A woman cannot be herself in modern society," he argues, since it is "an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint."

Ibsen sent a <a href="Foul%20papers">fair copy</a> of the completed play to his publisher on 15 September 1879. It was first published in Copenhagen on 4 December 1879, in an edition of 8,000 copies that sold out within a month; a second edition of 3,000 copies followed on 4 January 1880, and a third edition of 2,500 was issued on 8 March.

"A Doll's House" received its world premiere on 21 December 1879 at the <a href="Royal%20Danish%20Theatre">Royal Theatre</a> in Copenhagen, with Betty Hennings as Nora, Emil Poulsen as Torvald, and <a href="Peter%20Jerndorff">Peter Jerndorff</a> as Dr. Rank. Writing for the Norwegian newspaper "Folkets Avis", the critic <a href="Erik%20B%C3%B8gh">Erik Bøgh</a> admired Ibsen's originality and technical mastery: "Not a single declamatory phrase, no high dramatics, no drop of blood, not even a tear." Every performance of its run was sold out. Another production opened at the <a href="Royal%20Dramatic%20Theatre">Royal Theatre</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, on 8 January 1880, while productions in <a href="Oslo">Christiania</a> (with Johanne Juell as Nora and Arnoldus Reimers as Torvald) and <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a> followed shortly after.

In Germany, the actress <a href="Hedwig%20Raabe">Hedwig Niemann-Raabe</a> refused to perform the play as written, declaring, ""I" would never leave "my" children!" Since the playwright's wishes were not protected by copyright, Ibsen decided to avoid the danger of being rewritten by a lesser dramatist by committing what he called a "barbaric outrage" on his play himself and giving it an alternative ending in which Nora did not leave. A production of this version opened in <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a> in February 1880. This version was also played in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>, <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a>, and <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, although, in the wake of protests and a lack of success, Niemann-Raabe eventually restored the original ending. Another production of the original version, some rehearsals of which Ibsen attended, opened on 3 March 1880 at the <a href="Residenz%20Theatre">Residenz Theatre</a> in <a href="Munich">Munich</a>.

In Great Britain, the only way in which the play was initially allowed to be given in London was in an adaptation by <a href="Henry%20Arthur%20Jones">Henry Arthur Jones</a> and <a href="Henry%20Herman">Henry Herman</a> called "Breaking a Butterfly". This adaptation was produced at the Princess Theatre, 3 March 1884. Writing in 1896 in his book "The Foundations of a National Drama", Jones says: "A rough translation from the German version of A Doll's House was put into my hands, and I was told that if it could be turned into a sympathetic play, a ready opening would be found for it on the London boards. I knew nothing of Ibsen, but I knew a great deal of Robertson and H. J. Byron. From these circumstances came the adaptation called "Breaking a Butterfly"." <a href="H.%20L.%20Mencken">H. L. Mencken</a> writes that it was "A Doll’s House" “denaturized and <a href="dephlogisticated">dephlogisticated</a>. … Toward the middle of the action Ibsen was thrown to the fishes, and Nora was saved from suicide, rebellion, flight and immortality by making a faithful old clerk steal her fateful promissory note from Krogstad’s desk. … The curtain fell upon a happy home.“

Before 1899 there were two private productions of the play in London (in its original form as Ibsen wrote it) — one featured <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> in the role of Krogstad. The first public British production of the play in its regular form opened on 7 June 1889 at the Novelty Theatre, starring <a href="Janet%20Achurch">Janet Achurch</a> as Nora and Charles Charrington as Torvald. Achurch played Nora again for a 7-day run in 1897. Soon after its London premiere, Achurch brought the play to Australia in 1889.

The play was first seen in America in 1883 in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>; <a href="Helena%20Modjeska">Helena Modjeska</a> acted Nora. The play made its <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> premiere at the Palmer's Theatre on 21 December 1889, starring <a href="Beatrice%20Cameron">Beatrice Cameron</a> as Nora Helmer. It was first performed in France in 1894.
Other productions in the United States include one in 1902 starring <a href="Mrs.%20Fiske">Minnie Maddern Fiske</a>, a 1937 adaptation with acting script by <a href="Thornton%20Wilder">Thornton Wilder</a> and starring <a href="Ruth%20Gordon">Ruth Gordon</a>, and a 1971 production starring <a href="Claire%20Bloom">Claire Bloom</a>.

In June 2015, Space Arts Centre in London staged an adaptation of "A Doll's House" featuring the discarded alternate ending.

"A Doll's House" questions the traditional roles of men and women in 19th-century marriage. To many 19th-century Europeans, this was scandalous. The covenant of marriage was considered holy, and to portray it as Ibsen did was controversial; however, the Irish playwright <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> found Ibsen's willingness to examine society without prejudice exhilarating.

The Swedish playwright <a href="August%20Strindberg">August Strindberg</a> criticised the play in his volume of essays and short stories "<a href="Getting%20Married%20%28Strindberg%29">Getting Married</a>" (1884). Strindberg questioned Nora’s walking out and leaving her children behind with a man that she herself disapproved of so much that she would not remain with him. Strindberg also considers that Nora’s involvement with an illegal financial fraud that involved Nora forging a signature, all done behind her husband’s back, and then Nora’s lying to her husband regarding Krogstad’s blackmail, are serious crimes that should raise questions at the end of the play, when Nora is moralistically judging her husband. And Strindberg points out that Nora’s complaint that she and Torvald “have never exchanged one serious word about serious things”, is contradicted by the discussions that occur in act one and two.

The reason Nora leaves her husband are complex; various reasons are hinted at throughout the play. In the last scene she tells her husband she has been “greatly wronged” by his disparaging and condescending treatment of her, and his attitude towards her in their marriage — as though she were his “doll wife” — and the children in turn have become her “dolls”, and she has come to doubt her own qualifications to raise her children. She is troubled by her husband’s behavior in regard to her and the scandal of the loaned money. She does not love her husband, she feels they are strangers, she feels completely confused, and suggests that her issues are shared by many women. George Bernard Shaw suggests that she left to begin “a journey in search of self-respect and apprenticeship to life,” and that her revolt is “the end of a chapter of human history”.

Ibsen was inspired by the belief that "a woman cannot be herself in modern society," since it is "an exclusively male society, with laws made by men and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from a masculine standpoint." Its ideas can also be seen as having a wider application: <a href="Michael%20Meyer%20%28translator%29">Michael Meyer</a> argued that the play's theme is not <a href="women%27s%20rights">women's rights</a>, but rather "the need of every individual to find out the kind of person he or she really is and to strive to become that person." In a speech given to the <a href="Norwegian%20Association%20for%20Women%27s%20Rights">Norwegian Association for Women's Rights</a> in 1898, Ibsen insisted that he "must disclaim the honor of having consciously worked for the women's rights movement," since he wrote "without any conscious thought of making <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a>," his task having been "the "description of humanity"."

Because of the departure from traditional behavior and theatrical convention involved in Nora's leaving home, her act of slamming the door as she leaves has come to represent the play itself. One critic noted, "That slammed door reverberated across the roof of the world."

"A Doll's House" has been adapted for the cinema on many occasions, including:

AIM-7 Sparrow

The AIM-7 Sparrow is an American, medium-range <a href="semi-active%20radar%20homing">semi-active radar homing</a> <a href="air-to-air%20missile">air-to-air missile</a> operated by the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a>, as well as other various air forces and navies. Sparrow and its derivatives were the West's principal beyond visual range (BVR) air-to-air missile from the late 1950s until the 1990s. It remains in service, although it is being phased out in aviation applications in favor of the more advanced <a href="AIM-120%20AMRAAM">AIM-120 AMRAAM</a>. The Self-Defence Forces of <a href="Japan">Japan</a> also employ the Sparrow missile, though it is being phased out and replaced by the <a href="Mitsubishi%20AAM-4">Mitsubishi AAM-4</a>. NATO pilots use the <a href="brevity%20code">brevity code</a> <a href="Fox%20%28code%20word%29">Fox One</a> in radio communication to signal launch of a Semi-Active Radar Homing Missile such as the Sparrow.

The Sparrow was used as the basis for a <a href="surface-to-air%20missile">surface-to-air missile</a>, the <a href="RIM-7%20Sea%20Sparrow">RIM-7 Sea Sparrow</a>, which is used by a number of navies for air defense of their ships. Fired at low altitude and flying directly at its target though the lower atmosphere, the range of the missile in this role is greatly reduced. With the retirement of the Sparrow in the air-to-air role, a new version of the Sea Sparrow was produced to address this concern, producing the much larger and more capable <a href="RIM-162%20ESSM">RIM-162 ESSM</a>.

 from a late-1940s <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> program to develop a guided rocket weapon for air-to-air use. In 1947 the Navy contracted <a href="Sperry%20Corporation">Sperry</a> to build a <a href="beam%20riding">beam riding</a> version of a standard <a href="HVAR">HVAR</a>, the standard unguided aerial rocket, under Project Hotshot. The weapon was initially dubbed KAS-1, then AAM-2, and, from 1948 on, AAM-N-2. The airframe was developed by <a href="Douglas%20Aircraft%20Company">Douglas Aircraft Company</a>. The diameter of the HVAR proved to be inadequate for the electronics, leading Douglas to expand the missile's airframe to diameter. The prototype weapon began unpowered flight-tests in 1947, and made its first aerial interception in 1952.

After a protracted development cycle the initial AAM-N-2 "Sparrow" entered limited operational service in 1954 with specially modified <a href="Skyknight">Skyknight</a>s all weather carrier night fighters. And in 1956, they were carried by the <a href="F3H%20Demon">F3H-2M Demon</a> and <a href="F7U%20Cutlass">F7U Cutlass</a> <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a>. Compared to the modern versions, the Sparrow I was more <a href="Streamliner">streamlined</a> and featured a bullet-shaped airframe with a long pointed nose.

Sparrow I was a limited and rather primitive weapon. The limitations of beam-riding guidance (which was slaved to an optical sight on single seater fighters and a radar with night fighters) restricted the missile to attacks against targets flying a straight course and made it essentially useless against a maneuvering target. Only about 2,000 rounds were produced to this standard.

As early as 1950 Douglas examined equipping the Sparrow with an active radar seeker, initially known as XAAM-N-2a "Sparrow II, the original retroactively becoming Sparrow I". In 1952 it was given the new code AAM-N-3. The active radar made the Sparrow II a "fire and forget" weapon, allowing several to be fired at separate targets at the same time.

By 1955 Douglas proposed going ahead with development, intending it to be the primary weapon for the <a href="F5D%20Skylancer">F5D Skylancer</a> <a href="interceptor%20aircraft">interceptor</a>. It was later selected, with some controversy, to be the primary weapon for the Canadian <a href="Avro%20Arrow">Avro Arrow</a> supersonic interceptor, along with the new Astra fire-control system. For Canadian use and as a second source for US missiles, <a href="Canadair">Canadair</a> was selected to build the missiles in <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>.

The small size of the missile forebody and the K-band AN/APQ-64-radar limited performance, and it was never able to work in testing. After considerable development and test firings in the U.S. and Canada, Douglas abandoned development in 1956. Canadair continued development until the Arrow was cancelled in 1959.

A subvariant of the Sparrow I armed with the same nuclear warhead as the <a href="AIR-2%20Genie">MB-1 Genie</a> was proposed in 1958, but was cancelled shortly thereafter.

Concurrently with the development of the Sparrow I, in 1951, <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a> began work on the <a href="semi-active%20radar%20homing">semi-active radar homing</a> version of Sparrow family of missiles, the AAM-N-6 "Sparrow III". The first of these weapons entered <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> service in 1958.

The AAM-N-6a was similar to the -6, but used a new <a href="Thiokol">Thiokol</a> liquid-fuel rocket engine for improved performance. It also included changes to the guidance electronics to make it effective at higher closing speeds. The -6a was also selected to arm the Air Force's "F-110A Spectre" (<a href="F-4%20Phantom">F-4 Phantom</a>) fighters in 1962, known to them as the AIM-101. It entered production in 1959, with 7500 being built.

Another upgrade reverted to a Rocketdyne solid-fuel motor for the AAM-N-6b, which started production in 1963. The new motor significantly increased maximum range to for head-on attacks.

During this year the Navy and Air Force agreed on standardized naming conventions for their missiles. The Sparrows became the AIM-7 series. The original Sparrow I and aborted Sparrow II became the AIM-7A and AIM-7B, despite both being out of service. The -6, -6a and -6B became the AIM-7C, AIM-7D and AIM-7E respectively.

25,000 AIM-7Es were produced, and saw extensive use during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, where its performance was generally considered disappointing. The mixed results were a combination of reliability problems (exacerbated by the tropical climate), limited pilot training in fighter-to-fighter combat, and restrictive rules of engagement that generally prohibited BVR (beyond visual range) engagements. The P (kill probability) of the AIM-7E was less than 10%; US fighter pilots shot down 59 aircraft out of the 612 Sparrows fired. Of the 612 AIM-7D/E/E-2 missiles fired, 97 (or 15.8%) hit their targets, resulting in 56 (or 9.2%) kills. Two kills were obtained beyond visual range.

In 1969 an improved version, the E-2, was introduced with clipped wings and various changes to the fuzing. Considered a "dogfight Sparrow", the AIM-7E-2 was intended to be used at shorter ranges where the missile was still travelling at high speeds, and in the head-on aspect, making it much more useful in the visual limitations imposed on the engagements. Even so, its kill rate was only 13% in combat, leading to a practice of ripple-firing all four at once in hopes of increasing kill probability. Its worst tendency was that of detonating prematurely, approximately a thousand feet in front of the launching aircraft, but it also had many motor failures, erratic flights, and fuzing problems. An E-3 version included additional changes to the fuzing, and an E-4 featured a modified seeker for use with the <a href="F-14%20Tomcat">F-14 Tomcat</a>.

Improved versions of the AIM-7 were developed in the 1970s in an attempt to address the weapon's limitations. The AIM-7F, which entered service in 1976, had a dual-stage rocket motor for longer range, <a href="solid-state%20electronics">solid-state electronics</a> for greatly improved reliability, and a larger warhead. Even this version had room for improvement, leading <a href="British%20Aerospace">British Aerospace</a> and the Italian firm <a href="Alenia%20Aeronautica">Alenia</a> to develop advanced versions of Sparrow with better performance and improved electronics as the <a href="Skyflash">BAe Skyflash</a> and <a href="Alenia%20Aspide">Alenia Aspide</a>, respectively.

The most common version of the Sparrow today, the AIM-7M, entered service in 1982 and featured a new inverse monopulse seeker (matching the capabilities of Skyflash), active radar fuse, digital controls, improved <a href="electronic%20countermeasures">ECM</a> resistance, and better low-altitude performance. It was used to good advantage in the 1991 <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>, where it scored many USAF air-to-air kills. Of 44 missiles fired, 30 (68.2%) hit their intended targets resulting in 24/26 (54.5%/59.1%) kills. 19 kills were obtained beyond visual range.

The AIM-7P is similar in most ways to the M versions, and was primarily an upgrade program for existing M-series missiles. The main changes were to the software, improving low-level performance. A follow-on Block II upgrade added a new rear receiver allowing the missile to receive mid-course correction from the launching aircraft. Plans initially called for all M versions to be upgraded, but currently P's are being issued as required to replace M's lost or removed from the inventory.

The final version of the missile was to have been the AIM-7R, which added an <a href="infrared%20homing">infrared homing</a> seeker to an otherwise unchanged AIM-7P Block II. A general wind-down of the budget led to it being cancelled in 1997.

Sparrow is now being phased out with the availability of the active-radar <a href="AIM-120%20AMRAAM">AIM-120 AMRAAM</a>, but is likely to remain in service for several years.

As part of the <a href="Avro%20Canada%20CF-105%20Arrow">Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow</a> program, Canadair (now <a href="Bombardier%20Inc.">Bombardier</a>) partnered with <a href="Douglas%20Aircraft%20Company">Douglas Aircraft Company</a> in the development of the Sparrow II (AAM-N-3/AIM-7B). After Douglas dropped out of this program, <a href="Canadair">Canadair</a> continued on with it until the termination of the Arrow project.

The AAM-N-3 Sparrow II was unique in that it had a fully <a href="active%20radar%20guidance">active radar guidance</a> system. This combined both a radar transmitter and receiver in the missile, making it unnecessary for the pilot to keep the aircraft aimed at the target after firing the missile, unlike <a href="SARH">SARH</a> (semi-active radar homing) missiles which require continuous radar-assisted guidance throughout flight. This allowed the aircraft that fired the AAM-N-3 to turn away, prosecute other targets, and/or escape from potential retaliatory missiles fired by the enemy aircraft during the time it takes for the sparrow to reach its target. Despite the significant advantages of this design over <a href="SARH">SARH</a>, all subsequent models of the Sparrow use <a href="semi-active%20radar%20homing">semi-active radar homing</a> and <a href="GPS">GPS</a>.

To accommodate the active radar guidance system, the AAM-N-3 Sparrow II had a much greater volume than its predecessor. Its size would subsequently set the precedent for all future Sparrow variants.

In 1959, Canadair had completed five missiles based on airframes from Douglas, and built two models from scratch, when the program was cancelled with the cancellation of the Arrow.

Skyguard I is an anti-aircraft system, utilizing ground based AIM-7 Sparrow launchers.

The Italian company Finmeccanica (now <a href="Leonardo%20S.p.A.">Leonardo S.p.A.</a>), Alenia Difesa licensed the AIM-7E Sparrow technology from the US, and produced its own improved version called Aspide.

The LY-60/FD-60/PL-10 is a family of PRC missiles developed by the Shanghai Academy of Science and Technology, largely based on the Italian Aspide missile - a version of the Sparrow. There are four versions of the basic design, three of which are surface-to-air and one air-to-air.

The Soviet Union acquired an AIM-7 in 1968 and a <a href="Vympel%20PTO">Vympel</a> team started copying it as the K-25. The missile did not enter production as the <a href="R-23%20%28missile%29">R-23</a> was perceived to have better versatility, range, signal processing logic and immunity from interference. K-25 work ended in 1971, but analysis of the Sparrow was later used to inform the design of the <a href="R-27%20%28air-to-air%20missile%29">Vympel R-27</a>, particularly the servomechanisms and movable wings.

<a href="British%20Aerospace">British Aerospace</a> (BAe) licensed the AIM-7E2 technology in the 1970s, producing the Skyflash missile. Skyflash used a Marconi XJ521 monopulse Semi-Active seeker together with improvements to the electronics. It was powered by the Aerojet Mk52 mod 2 rocket engine (later by the Rocketdyne Mk38 mod 4). Skyflash entered service with the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) on their <a href="F-4%20Phantom%20II">Phantom FG.1/FGR.2</a> in 1978, and later on the <a href="Panavia%20Tornado%20ADV">Tornado F3</a>. Skyflash was also exported to Sweden for use on their <a href="Saab%2037%20Viggen">Viggen</a> fighters.

An upgraded version with active radar seeker, called Active Sky Flash was proposed by BAe and <a href="Thomson-CSF">Thomson-CSF</a>, but did not receive funding because the RAF opted for other missiles.

The Sparrow has four major sections: guidance section, <a href="warhead">warhead</a>, control, and rocket motor (currently the Hercules MK-58 solid-propellant rocket motor). It has a cylindrical body with four wings at mid-body and four tail fins. Although the external dimensions of the Sparrow remained relatively unchanged from model to model, the internal components of newer missiles represent major improvements, with vastly increased capabilities. The warhead is of the <a href="continuous-rod%20warhead">continuous-rod</a> type.

As with other semi-active radar guided missiles, the missile does not generate radar signals, but instead homes in on reflected continuous-wave signals from the launch platform's radar. The receiver also senses the guidance radar to enable comparisons that enhance the missile's resistance to passive jamming.

The launching aircraft will illuminate the target with its radar. In radars of the 1950s these were single target tracking devices using a <a href="Nutation">nutating</a> horn as part of the antenna. This caused the beam to be swept in a small cone. Signal processing would be applied to determine the direction of maximum illumination and so develop a signal to steer the antenna toward the target. The missile detects the reflected signal from the target with a high gain antenna in a similar fashion and steers the entire missile toward closure with the target. The missile guidance also samples a portion of the illuminating signal via rearward pointing <a href="waveguide">waveguide</a>s. The comparison of these two signals enabled logic circuits to determine the true target reflection signal, even if the target were to eject radar-reflecting <a href="chaff%20%28radar%20countermeasure%29">chaff</a>.

AIM-120 AMRAAM

The AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile, or AMRAAM (pronounced "am-ram"), is a modern <a href="Beyond-visual-range%20missile">beyond-visual-range</a> <a href="air-to-air%20missile">air-to-air missile</a> (BVRAAM) capable of all-weather day-and-night operations. Designed with 7-inch diameter instead of 8-inch diameter <a href="form-and-fit">form-and-fit</a> factors, and employing active transmit-receive radar guidance instead of semi-active receive-only radar guidance, it has the advantage of being a <a href="fire-and-forget">fire-and-forget</a> weapon when compared to the previous generation <a href="AIM-7%20Sparrow">Sparrow</a> missiles. When an AMRAAM missile is being launched, <a href="NATO">NATO</a> pilots use the <a href="Multiservice%20tactical%20brevity%20code">brevity code</a> <a href="Fox%20%28code%20word%29">Fox Three</a>.

The <a href="AIM-7%20Sparrow">AIM-7 Sparrow</a> medium range missile (MRM) was purchased by the US Navy from original developer <a href="Howard%20Hughes">Howard Hughes</a> in the 1950s as its first operational air-to-air missile with "<a href="beyond%20visual%20range">beyond visual range</a>" (BVR) capability. With an effective range of about , it was introduced as a radar <a href="beam%20riding">beam-riding</a> missile and then it was improved to a <a href="semi-active%20radar%20homing">semiactive radar guided</a> missile which would home in on reflections from a target illuminated by the radar of the launching aircraft. It was effective at visual to beyond visual range. The early beam riding versions of the Sparrow missiles were integrated onto the <a href="F3H%20Demon">F3H Demon</a> and <a href="F7U%20Cutlass">F7U Cutlass</a>, but the definitive AIM-7 Sparrow was the primary weapon for the all-weather <a href="F-4%20Phantom%20II">F-4 Phantom II</a> fighter/interceptor, which lacked an internal gun in its <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marine Corps</a>, and early <a href="U.S.%20Air%20Force">U.S. Air Force</a> versions. The F-4 carried up to four AIM-7s in built-in recesses under its belly.

Although designed for use against non-maneuvering targets such as bombers, because of poor performance against fighters over North Vietnam, these missiles were progressively improved until they proved highly effective in dogfights. Together with the short-range, infrared-guided <a href="AIM-9%20Sidewinder">AIM-9 Sidewinder</a>, they replaced the <a href="AIM-4%20Falcon">AIM-4 Falcon</a> IR and radar guided series for use in air combat by the USAF as well. A disadvantage to semi-active homing was that only one target could be illuminated by the launching <a href="fighter%20plane">fighter plane</a> at a time. Also, the launching aircraft had to remain pointed in the direction of the target (within the azimuth and elevation of its own radar set) which could be difficult or dangerous in <a href="air-to-air%20combat">air-to-air combat</a>.

An active-radar variant called the Sparrow II was developed to address these drawbacks, but the U.S. Navy pulled out of the project in 1956. The <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a>, which took over development in the hopes of using the missile to arm their prospective <a href="CF-105%20Arrow">CF-105 Arrow</a> interceptor, soon followed in 1958. The electronics of the time simply could not be miniaturized enough to make Sparrow II a viable working weapon. It would take decades, and a new generation of digital electronics, to produce an effective active-radar air-to-air missile as compact as the Sparrow.

The US Navy later developed the <a href="AIM-54%20Phoenix">AIM-54 Phoenix</a> long-range missile (LRM) for the fleet air defense mission. It was a large , Mach 5 missile designed to counter <a href="cruise%20missile">cruise missile</a>s and the bombers that launched them. Originally intended for the straight-wing <a href="Douglas%20F6D%20Missileer">Douglas F6D Missileer</a> and then the navalized version of the <a href="F-111B%23F-111B">F-111B</a>, it finally saw service with the <a href="Grumman%20F-14%20Tomcat">Grumman F-14 Tomcat</a>, the only fighter capable of carrying such a heavy missile. Phoenix was the first US <a href="fire-and-forget">fire-and-forget</a>, multiple-launch, radar-guided missile: one which used its own active guidance system to guide itself without help from the launch aircraft when it closed on its target. This, in theory, gave a Tomcat with a six-Phoenix load the unprecedented capability of tracking and destroying up to six targets beyond visual range, as far as away—the only US fighter with such capability.

A full load of six Phoenix missiles and its dedicated launcher exceeded a typical Vietnam-era bomb load. Its service in the US Navy was primarily as a deterrent, as its use was hampered by restrictive <a href="rules%20of%20engagement">rules of engagement</a> in conflicts such as Operations <a href="Desert%20Storm">Desert Storm</a>, <a href="Southern%20Watch">Southern Watch</a>, and <a href="Iraqi%20Freedom">Iraqi Freedom</a>. The US Navy retired the Phoenix in 2004 in light of availability of the AIM-120 AMRAAM on the <a href="F/A-18%20Hornet">F/A-18 Hornet</a> and the pending retirement of the F-14 Tomcat from active service in late 2006.

The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a> conducted an extensive evaluation of air combat tactics and missile technology from 1974 to 1978 at <a href="Nellis%20AFB">Nellis AFB</a> using the F-14 Tomcat and F-15 Eagle equipped with Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles as the blue force and aggressor F-5E aircraft equipped with <a href="AIM-9L">AIM-9L</a> <a href="all-aspect">all-aspect</a> Sidewinders as the red force. This <a href="joint%20test%20and%20evaluation">joint test and evaluation</a> (JT&E) was designated Air Combat Evaluation/Air Intercept Missile Evaluation (<a href="ACEVAL/AIMVAL">ACEVAL/AIMVAL</a>). A principal finding was that the necessity to produce illumination for the Sparrow until impact resulted in the red force's being able to launch their all-aspect Sidewinders before impact, resulting in mutual kills. What was needed was Phoenix-type multiple-launch and terminal active capability in a Sparrow-size airframe. This led to a <a href="memorandum%20of%20agreement">memorandum of agreement</a> (MOA) with European allies (principally the UK and Germany for development) for the US to develop an advanced, medium-range, air-to-air missile with the USAF as lead service. The MOA also assigned responsibility for development of an advanced, short-range, air-to-air missile to the European team; this would become the British <a href="ASRAAM">ASRAAM</a>.

By the 1990s, the reliability of the Sparrow had improved so much from the dismal days of Vietnam that it accounted for the largest number of aerial targets destroyed in <a href="Gulf%20War">Desert Storm</a>. But while the USAF had passed on the Phoenix and their own similar <a href="AIM-47">AIM-47</a>/<a href="YF-12">YF-12</a> to optimize dogfight performance, they still needed a multiple-launch fire-and-forget capability for the F-15 and F-16. AMRAAM would need to be fitted on fighters as small as the F-16, and fit in the same spaces that were designed to fit the Sparrow on the F-4 Phantom. The European partners needed AMRAAM to be integrated on aircraft as small as the Sea Harrier. The US Navy needed AMRAAM to be carried on the F/A-18 Hornet and wanted capability for two to be carried on a launcher that normally carried one Sparrow to allow for more air-to-ground weapons.

The AMRAAM became one of the primary air-to-air weapons of the new <a href="F-22%20Raptor">F-22 Raptor</a> fighter, which needed to place all of its weapons into internal weapons bays in order to help achieve an extremely low <a href="radar%20cross-section">radar cross-section</a>.

AMRAAM was developed as the result of an agreement (the <a href="Family%20of%20Weapons">Family of Weapons</a> MOA, no longer in effect by 1990), among the United States and several other <a href="NATO">NATO</a> nations to develop air-to-air missiles and to share production technology. Under this agreement the U.S. was to develop the next generation medium range missile (AMRAAM) and Europe would develop the next generation short range missile (<a href="ASRAAM">ASRAAM</a>). Although Europe initially adopted the AMRAAM, an effort to develop the <a href="Meteor%20%28missile%29">Meteor (missile)</a>, a competitor to AMRAAM, was begun in Great Britain. Eventually the ASRAAM was developed solely by the British, but using another source for its infrared seeker. After protracted development, the deployment of AMRAAM (AIM-120A) began in September 1991 in US Air Force <a href="F-15%20Eagle">F-15 Eagle</a> fighter <a href="Squadron%20%28aviation%29">squadron</a>s. The US Navy soon followed (in 1993) in its <a href="F/A-18%20Hornet">F/A-18 Hornet</a> squadrons.

The eastern counterpart of AMRAAM is the somewhat similar <a href="Russian%20Air%20Force">Russian Air Force</a> <a href="R-77">AA-12 "Adder"</a>, sometimes referred to in the West as the "AMRAAMski." Likewise, France began its own air-to-air missile development with the <a href="MICA%20%28missile%29">MICA</a> concept that used a common airframe for separate radar-guided and infrared-guided versions.

AMRAAM has an all-weather, beyond-visual-range (BVR) capability. It improves the aerial combat capabilities of US and allied aircraft to meet the threat of enemy air-to-air weapons as they existed in 1991. AMRAAM serves as a follow-on to the AIM-7 Sparrow missile series. The new missile is faster, smaller, and lighter, and has improved capabilities against low-altitude targets. It also incorporates a datalink to guide the missile to a point where its active radar turns on and makes terminal intercept of the target. An inertial reference unit and micro-computer system makes the missile less dependent upon the fire-control system of the aircraft.

Once the missile closes in on the target, its <a href="active%20radar">active radar</a> guides it to intercept. This feature, known as "fire-and-forget", frees the aircrew from the need to further provide guidance, enabling the aircrew to aim and fire several missiles simultaneously at multiple targets and perform evasive maneuvers while the missiles guide themselves to the targets.

The missile also features the ability to "Home on Jamming," giving it the ability to switch over from active radar homing to passive homing – homing on jamming signals from the target aircraft. Software on board the missile allows it to detect if it is being jammed, and guide on its target using the proper guidance system.

AMRAAM uses two-stage <a href="missile%20guidance">guidance</a> when fired at long range. The aircraft passes data to the missile just before launch, giving it information about the location of the target aircraft from the launch point and its direction and speed. The missile uses this information to fly on an interception course to the target using its built-in <a href="inertial%20navigation%20system">inertial navigation system</a> (INS). This information is generally obtained using the launching aircraft's radar, although it could come from an <a href="Infra-red%20search%20and%20track">Infra-red search and track</a> system, from a <a href="Joint%20Tactical%20Information%20Distribution%20System">data link</a> from another fighter aircraft, or from an <a href="Airborne%20Early%20Warning%20and%20Control">AWACS</a> aircraft.

After launch, if the firing aircraft or surrogate continues to track the target, periodic updates—such as changes in the target's direction and speed—are sent from the launch aircraft to the missile, allowing the missile to adjust its course, via actuation of the rear fins, so that it is able to close to a self-homing distance where it will be close enough to "catch" the target aircraft in the "basket" (the missile's radar field of view in which it will be able to lock onto the target aircraft, unassisted by the launch aircraft).

Not all armed services using the AMRAAM have elected to purchase the mid-course update option, which limits AMRAAM's effectiveness in some scenarios. The <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">RAF</a> initially opted not to use mid-course update for its <a href="Panavia%20Tornado%20ADV">Tornado F3</a> force, only to discover that without it, testing proved the AMRAAM was less effective in beyond visual range (BVR) engagements than the older <a href="semi-active%20radar%20homing">semi-active radar homing</a> <a href="Skyflash">BAE Skyflash</a> weapon—the AIM-120's own radar is necessarily of limited range and power compared to that of the launch aircraft.

Once the missile closes to self-homing distance, it turns on its active radar seeker and searches for the target aircraft. If the target is in or near the expected location, the missile will find it and guide itself to the target from this point. If the missile is fired at short range, within visual range (WVR) or the near BVR, it can use its active seeker just after launch, making the missile truly "fire and forget". 

Apart from the slave mode, there is a free guidance mode, called boresight. This mode is radar guidance-free, the missile just fires and locks the first thing it sees. This mode can be used for defensive shot, i.e. when the enemy has numerical superiority.

The <a href="probability%20of%20kill">kill probability</a> (P) is determined by several factors, including aspect (head-on interception, side-on or tail-chase), altitude, the speed of the missile and the target, and how hard the target can turn. Typically, if the missile has sufficient energy during the terminal phase, which comes from being launched at close range to the target from an aircraft with an altitude and speed advantage, it will have a good chance of success. This chance drops as the missile is fired at longer ranges as it runs out of overtake speed at long ranges, and if the target can force the missile to turn it might bleed off enough speed that it can no longer chase the target. Operationally, the missile, which was designed for <a href="Beyond-visual-range%20missile">beyond visual range</a> combat, has a P of 61.1% (18 missiles for 11 kills). The targets included six <a href="Mikoyan%20MiG-29">MiG-29s</a>, a <a href="Mikoyan-Gurevich%20MiG-25">MiG-25</a>, a <a href="Mikoyan-Gurevich%20MiG-23">MiG-23</a>, a <a href="Sukhoi%20Su-17">Su-22</a>, a <a href="Soko%20G-4%20Super%20Galeb">Galeb</a> and a US Army <a href="Sikorsky%20UH-60%20Black%20Hawk">Blackhawk</a> that was targeted by mistake.

There are currently four main variants of AMRAAM, all in service with the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>, and the United States Marine Corps. The AIM-120A is no longer in production and shares the enlarged wings and fins with the successor AIM-120B. The AIM-120C has smaller "clipped" aerosurfaces to enable internal carriage on the USAF <a href="F-22%20Raptor">F-22 Raptor</a>. AIM-120B deliveries began in 1994.

The AIM-120C deliveries began in 1996. The C-variant has been steadily upgraded since it was introduced. The AIM-120C-6 contained an improved fuse (Target Detection Device) compared to its predecessor. The AIM-120C-7 development began in 1998 and included improvements in homing and greater range (actual amount of improvement unspecified). It was successfully tested in 2003 and is currently being produced for both domestic and foreign customers. It helped the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> replace the <a href="F-14%20Tomcat">F-14 Tomcat</a>s with <a href="F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet">F/A-18E/F Super Hornet</a>s – the loss of the F-14's long-range <a href="AIM-54%20Phoenix">AIM-54 Phoenix</a> missiles (already retired) is offset with a longer-range AMRAAM-D. The lighter weight of the advanced AMRAAM enables an F/A-18E/F pilot greater bring-back weight upon carrier landings.

The AIM-120D is an upgraded version of the AMRAAM with improvements in almost all areas, including 50% greater range (than the already-extended range AIM-120C-7) and better guidance over its entire flight envelope yielding an improved kill probability (<a href="Probability%20of%20kill">P</a>). Raytheon began testing the D model on August 5, 2008, the company reported that an AIM-120D launched from an <a href="F/A-18F%20Super%20Hornet">F/A-18F Super Hornet</a> passed within lethal distance of a QF-4 target drone at the <a href="White%20Sands%20Missile%20Range">White Sands Missile Range</a>.

The AIM-120D (P3I Phase 4, formerly known as AIM-120C-8) is a development of the AIM-120C with a two-way data link, more accurate navigation using a GPS-enhanced IMU, an expanded no-escape envelope, and improved HOBS (High-Angle Off-Boresight) capability. The AIM-120D is a joint USAF/USN project, and is currently in the testing phase. The USN was scheduled to field it from 2014, and AIM-120D will be carried by all Pacific carrier groups by 2020, although the <a href="Budget%20sequestration%20in%202013">2013 sequestration cuts</a> could push back this later date to 2022. The <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> requested 450 AIM-120D missiles, which would make it the first foreign operator of the missile. The procurement, approved by the US Government in April 2016, will cost $1.1 billion and will be integrated for use on the F/A-18F Super Hornet, EA-18G Growler and the F-35 Lightning II aircraft.

There are also plans for <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a> to develop a <a href="ramjet">ramjet</a>-powered derivative of the AMRAAM, the Future Medium Range Air-Air Missile (<a href="FMRAAM">FMRAAM</a>). It is not known whether the FMRAAM will be produced since the target market, the British Ministry of Defence, has chosen the <a href="MBDA%20Meteor">Meteor missile</a> over the FMRAAM for a <a href="BVR">BVR</a> missile for the <a href="Eurofighter%20Typhoon">Eurofighter Typhoon</a> aircraft.

Raytheon is also working with the <a href="Missile%20Defense%20Agency">Missile Defense Agency</a> to develop the <a href="Network%20Centric%20Airborne%20Defense%20Element">Network Centric Airborne Defense Element</a> (NCADE), an anti-ballistic missile derived from the AIM-120. This weapon will be equipped with a <a href="Ramjet">Ramjet</a> engine and an <a href="infrared%20homing">infrared homing</a> seeker derived from the <a href="AIM-9%20Sidewinder">Sidewinder</a> missile. In place of a proximity-fused warhead, the NCADE will use a <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a> <a href="hit-to-kill">hit-to-kill</a> vehicle based on the one used in the Navy's <a href="RIM-161%20Standard%20Missile%203">RIM-161 Standard Missile 3</a>.

The −120A and −120B models are currently nearing the end of their service life while the −120D variant has just entered full production. AMRAAM was due to be replaced by the <a href="USAF">USAF</a>, the <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a>, and the <a href="U.S.%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marine Corps</a> after 2020 by the Joint Dual Role Air Dominance Missile (<a href="Next%20Generation%20Missile">Next Generation Missile</a>). This was unexpectedly terminated in the 2013 budget plan, and so the future replacement is uncertain.

<a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a> successfully tested launching AMRAAM missiles from a five-missile carrier on a M1097 <a href="Humvee">Humvee</a>. This system will be known as the SLAMRAAM (Surface Launched (SL) and AMRAAM). They receive their initial guidance information from a radar not mounted on the vehicle. Since the missile is launched without the benefit of an aircraft's speed or high altitude, its range is considerably shorter. Raytheon is currently marketing an SL-AMRAAM EX, purported to be an extended range AMRAAM and bearing a resemblance to the <a href="RIM-162%20ESSM">RIM-162 ESSM</a>.

The <a href="NASAMS">Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System</a> (NASAMS), developed by <a href="Kongsberg%20Defence%20%26amp%3B%20Aerospace">Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace</a>, consists of a number of vehicle-pulled launch batteries (containing six AMRAAMs each) along with separate radar trucks and control station vehicles. A more recent version of the program is the "High Mobility Launcher", made in cooperation with <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a> (Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace was already a subcontractor on the SLAMRAAM system), where the launch-vehicle is a <a href="Humvee">Humvee</a> (M1152A1 HMMWV), containing four AMRAAMs each.

While still under evaluation for replacement of current US Army assets, the SL-AMRAAM has been deployed in several nations' military forces. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has requested the purchasing of SL-AMRAAM as part of a larger 7 billion dollar foreign military sales package. The sale would include 288 AMRAAM C-7 missiles.

The US Army has test fired the SL-AMRAAM from a <a href="HIMARS">HIMARS</a> artillery rocket launcher as a common launcher, as part of a move to switch to a larger and more survivable launch platform.

On January 6, 2011, Secretary of Defense <a href="Robert%20Gates">Robert Gates</a> announced that the U.S. Army has decided to terminate acquisition of the SLAMRAAM as part of a budget-cutting effort.

The National Guard Association of the United States has sent a letter asking for the United States Senate to stop the Army's plan to drop the SLAMRAAM program because without it there would be no path to modernize the Guard's <a href="AN/TWQ-1%20Avenger">AN/TWQ-1 Avenger</a> Battalions.

On February 22, 2015 Raytheon announced an Extended Range upgrade to NASAMS-launched AMRAAM, calling it <a href="NASAMS%23AMRAAM-ER">AMRAAM-ER</a>. This combines the AMRAAM seeker with the ESSM rocket motor.

The AMRAAM was used for the first time on December 27, 1992, when a USAF <a href="F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon">F-16D</a> shot down an Iraqi <a href="MiG-25">MiG-25</a> that violated the southern no-fly-zone. Interestingly, this missile had been returned from the flight line as defective a day earlier. AMRAAM gained a second victory in January 1993 when an Iraqi <a href="MiG-23">MiG-23</a> was shot down by a USAF <a href="F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon">F-16C</a>.

The third combat use of the AMRAAM was in 1994, when a <a href="Republika%20Srpska%20Air%20Force">Republika Srpska Air Force</a> <a href="Soko%20J-21%20Jastreb">J-21 Jastreb</a> aircraft was shot down by a USAF <a href="F-16">F-16</a>C that was patrolling the UN-imposed no-fly zone over <a href="Bosnia">Bosnia</a>. In that engagement, at least three other Serbian aircraft were shot down by USAF F-16C fighters using <a href="AIM-9">AIM-9</a> missiles (see <a href="Banja%20Luka%20incident">Banja Luka incident</a> for more details). At that point, three launches in combat had resulted in three kills, resulting in the AMRAAM's being informally named "slammer" in the second half of the 1990s.

In 1998 and 1999 AMRAAMs were again fired by USAF <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-15%20Eagle">F-15</a> fighters at Iraqi aircraft violating the No-Fly-Zone, but this time they failed to hit their targets. During the spring of 1999, AMRAAMs saw their main combat action during <a href="Operation%20Allied%20Force">Operation Allied Force</a>, the Kosovo <a href="1999%20NATO%20bombing%20of%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">bombing campaign</a>. Six Serbian MiG-29 were shot down by NATO (4 USAF F-15C, 1 USAF F-16C, 1 Dutch F-16A MLU), all of them using AIM-120 missiles (the kill by the F-16C may have happened due to friendly fire, from <a href="SA-7%20MANPAD">SA-7 MANPAD</a> fired by Serbian infantry).

On 18 June 2017, a US <a href="Boeing%20F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet">F/A-18E Super Hornet</a> engaged and shot down a SyAAF Su-22, using an AIM-120.

As of 2017, the AIM-120 AMRAAM has shot down ten aircraft (six <a href="MiG-29">MiG-29</a>s, one <a href="MiG-25">MiG-25</a>, one <a href="MiG-23">MiG-23</a>, one <a href="Sukhoi%20Su-17">Su-22</a>, and one <a href="Soko%20J-21%20Jastreb">Soko J-21 Jastreb</a>). An AMRAAM was also involved in a friendly fire incident in 1994 when <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-15%20Eagle">F-15</a> fighters patrolling Iraq's Northern No-Fly Zone <a href="1994%20Black%20Hawk%20shootdown%20incident">inadvertently shot down</a> a pair of <a href="U.S.%20Army">U.S. Army</a> <a href="UH-60%20Black%20Hawk">Black Hawk</a> helicopters.

Since 2007 Raytheon has continued to slip on AMRAAM deliveries, leading the USAF to withhold $621 million in 2012 on account of 193 missiles not delivered.

Canadair, now <a href="Bombardier%20Aerospace">Bombardier</a>, had largely helped with the development of the <a href="AIM-7%20Sparrow">AIM-7 Sparrow</a> and Sparrow II, and assisted to a less extent in the AIM-120 development. Canada had placed an order for 256 AIM-120's, but cancelled half of them after engine ignition problems due to cold weather conditions. The AIM-9X & AIM-7 were ordered as replacements.

In early 1995 South Korea ordered 88 AIM-120A missiles for its KF-16 fleet. In 1997 South Korea ordered additional 737 AIM-120B missiles.

In 2006 Poland received AIM-120C-5 missiles to arm its new <a href="F-16">F-16C/D Block 52+</a> fighters.

In early 2006, the <a href="Pakistan%20Air%20Force">Pakistan Air Force</a> (PAF) ordered 500 AIM-120C-5 AMRAAM missiles as part of a $650 million F-16 ammunition deal to equip its <a href="F-16">F-16C/D Block 50/52+</a> and <a href="F-16">F-16A/B Block 15 MLU</a> fighters. The PAF got the first three F-16C/D Block 50/52+ aircraft on July 3, 2010 and first batch of AMRAAMs on July 26, 2010.

In 2007, the United States government agreed to sell 218 AIM-120C-7 missiles to Taiwan as part of a large arms sales package that also included 235 AGM-65G-2 Maverick missiles. Total value of the package, including launchers, maintenance, spare parts, support and training rounds, was estimated at around US$421 million. This supplemented an earlier Taiwanese purchase of 120 AIM-120C-5 missiles a few years ago.

2008 has brought announcements of new or additional sales to Singapore, Finland, Morocco and South Korea; in December 2010 the Swiss government requested 150 AIM-120C-7 missiles. Sales to Finland have stalled, because the manufacturer has not been able to fix a mysterious bug that causes the rocket motors of the missile to fail in cold tests. In May 5, 2015, the State Department has made a determination approving a possible Foreign Military Sale to <a href="Royal%20Malaysian%20Air%20Force">Royal Malaysian Air Force</a> for AIM-120C7 AMRAAM Missiles and associated equipment, parts and logistical support for an estimated cost of $21 million.

In March 2016, the US government approved the sales of AIM-120C-7 missiles to the <a href="Indonesian%20Air%20Force">Indonesian Air Force</a> to equip their fleet of F-16 C/D Block 32+.

AGM-88 HARM

The AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) is a tactical, <a href="air-to-surface%20missile">air-to-surface missile</a> designed to home in on electronic transmissions coming from surface-to-air <a href="radar">radar</a> systems. It was originally developed by <a href="Texas%20Instruments">Texas Instruments</a> as a replacement for the <a href="AGM-45%20Shrike">AGM-45 Shrike</a> and <a href="AGM-78%20Standard%20ARM">AGM-78 Standard ARM</a> system. Production was later taken over by <a href="Raytheon%20Corporation">Raytheon Corporation</a> when it purchased the defense production business of Texas Instruments.

The AGM-88 can detect, attack and destroy a <a href="radar%20antenna">radar antenna</a> or <a href="transmitter">transmitter</a> with minimal aircrew input. The proportional guidance system that homes in on enemy radar emissions has a fixed antenna and seeker head in the missile's nose. A smokeless, solid-propellant, <a href="dual-thrust">booster-sustainer</a> <a href="rocket%20motor">rocket motor</a> propels the missile at speeds over <a href="Mach%20number">Mach</a> 2. HARM, a U.S. Navy-led program, was initially integrated onto the <a href="A-6%20Intruder">A-6E</a>, <a href="A-7%20Corsair%20II">A-7</a> and <a href="F/A-18">F/A-18</a> and later onto the <a href="EA-6B">EA-6B</a>. RDT&E for use on the F-14 was begun, but not completed. The <a href="USAF">USAF</a> introduced HARM on the <a href="F-4%20Phantom%20II">F-4G</a> <a href="Wild%20Weasel">Wild Weasel</a> and later on specialized <a href="F-16">F-16</a>s equipped with the <a href="HARM%20Targeting%20System">HARM Targeting System</a> (HTS).

The HARM missile was approved for full production in March 1983, obtained initial operating capability (IOC) on the A-7E Corsair II in late 1983 and then deployed in late 1985 with <a href="Attack%20Squadron%2046%20%28United%20States%20Navy%29">VA-46</a> aboard the aircraft carrier <a href="USS%20America%20%28CV-66%29">USS "America"</a>. In 1986 the first successful firing of the HARM from an EA-6B was performed by VAQ-131. It was soon used in combat—in March 1986 against a <a href="Libyan%20Army%20%281951%E2%80%932011%29">Libyan</a> <a href="S-200%20Angara/Vega/Dubna">SA-5</a> site in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Sidra">Gulf of Sidra</a>, and then <a href="Bombing%20of%20Libya%20%281986%29">Operation Eldorado Canyon</a> in April. HARM was used extensively by the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> for Operation Desert Storm during the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a> of 1991.

During the Gulf War, the HARM was involved in a friendly fire incident when the pilot of an <a href="F-4%20Phantom%20II">F-4G</a> Wild Weasel escorting a <a href="B-52%20Stratofortress">B-52</a> bomber mistook the latter's tail gun radar for an Iraqi <a href="antiaircraft%20artillery">AAA</a> site. (This was after the tail gunner of the B-52 had targeted the F-4G, mistaking it for an Iraqi <a href="MiG">MiG</a>.) The F-4 pilot launched the missile and then saw that the target was the B-52, which was hit. It survived with shrapnel damage to the tail and no casualties. The B-52 was subsequently renamed "In HARM's Way".

"Magnum" is spoken over the radio to announce the launch of an AGM-88. During the Gulf War, if an aircraft was illuminated by enemy radar a bogus "Magnum" call on the radio was often enough to convince the operators to power down.
This technique would also be employed in Serbia during air operations in 1999.

In 2013 President Obama offered the AGM-88 to Israel for the first time.

The newest upgrade, the "AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM)," features the latest software, enhanced capabilities intended to counter radar shutdown and passive radar using an additional active millimeter wave seeker. It was released in November 2010 and is a joint venture by the US Department of Defense and the Italian Ministry of Defense and is produced by <a href="Alliant%20Techsystems">Alliant Techsystems</a>.

In November 2005, the Italian Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense signed a Memorandum of Agreement on the joint development of the AGM-88E AARGM missile. Italy was providing $20 million of developmental funding as well as several millions worth of material, equipment and related services. The Italian Air Force was expected to procure up to 250 missiles for its Tornado ECR aircraft. Thus flight test program was set to integrate the AARGM onto Tornado ECR's weapon system.<br>
The Navy demonstrated the AARGM's capability during Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) in spring 2012 with live firing of 12 missiles. Aircrew and maintenance training with live missiles was completed in June.

The Navy authorized Full-Rate Production (FRP) of the AARGM in August 2012, with 72 missiles for the Navy and nine for the <a href="Italian%20Air%20Force">Italian Air Force</a> to be delivered in 2013. A U.S. Marine Corps <a href="F/A-18%20Hornet">F/A-18 Hornet</a> squadron will be the first forward-deployed unit with the AGM-88E.

In September 2013, ATK delivered the 100th AARGM to the U.S. Navy. The AGM-88E program is on schedule and on budget, with Full Operational Capability (FOC) planned for September 2014. The AGM-88E was designed to improve the effectiveness of legacy HARM variants against fixed and relocatable radar and communications sites, particularly those that would shut down to throw off anti-radiation missiles, by attaching a new seeker to the existing Mach 2-capable rocket motor and warhead section, adding a passive anti-radiation homing receiver, satellite and <a href="inertial%20navigation%20system">inertial navigation system</a>, a <a href="millimeter%20wave">millimeter wave</a> radar for terminal guidance, and the ability to beam up images of the target via a <a href="satellite%20link">satellite link</a> just seconds before impact.

It will be initially integrated onto the F/A-18C/D, F/A-18E/F, EA-18G, and Tornado ECR aircraft and later on the <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II">F-35</a>.

The Navy's FY 2016 budget included funding for an extended range AARGM-ER that utilizes the existing guidance system and warhead of the AGM-88E with a solid integrated rocket-<a href="ramjet">ramjet</a> for double the range. Development funding will last to 2020.

On September 2016, Orbital ATK has lifted the veil on its extended-range variant of the AGM-88E or AARGM-ER, which incorporates a redesigned control section and 11.5 in.-dia. rocket motor for twice the range and internal carriage on the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II.

In September 2015, the AGM-88E successfully hit a mobile ship target in a live-fire test, demonstrating the missile's ability to use anti-radiation homing and millimeter wave radar to detect, identify, locate, and engage moving targets.

Although the U.S. chose the Orbital ATK-produced AGM-88E, Raytheon created their own version of the AARGM called the AGM-88F HARM Control Section Modification (HCSM) that incorporates similar upgrade features, which could allow the company to offer their missile for export.

AGM-65 Maverick

The AGM-65 Maverick is an <a href="Air-to-surface%20missile">air-to-ground tactical missile</a> (AGM) designed for <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a>. It is the most widely produced precision-guided missile in the Western world, and is effective against a wide range of <a href="Military%20tactics">tactical</a> targets, including <a href="Armour">armor</a>, air defenses, <a href="ship">ship</a>s, ground transportation and fuel storage facilities.

Originally designed and built by <a href="Hughes%20Aircraft">Hughes Missile Systems</a>, development of the AGM-65 spanned from 1966 to 1972, after which it entered service with the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> in August 1972. Since then, it has been exported to more than 30 countries and is certified on 25 aircraft. The Maverick served during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam</a>, <a href="Yom%20Kippur%20War">Yom Kippur</a>, <a href="Iran%E2%80%93Iraq%20War">Iran–Iraq</a>, and <a href="Gulf%20War">Persian Gulf War</a>s, along with other smaller conflicts, destroying enemy forces and installations with varying degrees of success.

Since its introduction into service, numerous Maverick versions had been designed and produced, using electro-optical, <a href="Laser%20guidance">laser</a>, <a href="charge-coupled%20device">charge-coupled device</a> and <a href="Infrared%20homing">infra-red</a> <a href="guidance%20system">guidance system</a>s. The AGM-65 has two types of warhead: one has a contact fuze in the nose, the other has a heavyweight warhead fitted with a delayed-action fuze, which penetrates the target with its kinetic energy before detonating.

The Maverick shares the same configuration as Hughes's <a href="AIM-4%20Falcon">AIM-4 Falcon</a> and <a href="AIM-54%20Phoenix">AIM-54 Phoenix</a>, and measures more than in length and in diameter.

The Maverick's development history began in 1965, when the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF) began a program to develop a replacement to the <a href="AGM-12%20Bullpup">AGM-12 Bullpup</a>. With a range of , the radio-guided Bullpup was introduced in 1959 and was considered a "silver bullet" by operators. However, the launch aircraft was required to fly straight towards the target during the missile's flight instead of performing evasive maneuvers, thus risking the crew. Even when it hit, the small warhead was only useful against small targets like bunkers, when used against larger targets like the <a href="Thanh%20H%C3%B3a%20Bridge">Thanh Hóa Bridge</a> it did little other than char the structure. The USAF began a series of projects to replace Bullpup, both larger versions of Bullpup, models C and D, as well as a series of Bullpup adaptations offering fire-and-forget guidance. Among the later were the <a href="AGM-83%20Bulldog">AGM-83 Bulldog</a>, <a href="AGM-79%20Blue%20Eye">AGM-79 Blue Eye</a>. and <a href="AGM-80%20Viper">AGM-80 Viper</a>.

From 1966 to 1968, <a href="Hughes%20Aircraft">Hughes Missile Systems Division</a> and <a href="Rockwell%20International">Rockwell</a> competed for the contract to build an entirely new fire-and-forget missile with far greater range performance than any of the Bullpup versions. Each were allocated $3 million for preliminary design and engineering work of the Maverick in 1966. In 1968, Hughes emerged with the $95 million contract for further development and testing of the missile; at the same time, contract options called for 17,000 missiles to be procured. Hughes conducted a smooth development of the AGM-65 Maverick, with the first unguided test launch from a F-4 on 18 September 1969, with the first guided test on 18 December successfully performing a direct hit on a <a href="M41%20Walker%20Bulldog">M41 tank</a> target at the Air Force Missile Development Center at <a href="Holloman%20Air%20Force%20Base">Holloman Air Force Base</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>.

In July 1971, the USAF and Hughes signed a $69.9 million contract for 2,000 missiles, the first of which was delivered in 1972. Although early operational results were favorable, military planners predicted that the Maverick would fare less successfully in the hazy conditions of <a href="Central%20Europe">Central Europe</a>, where it would have been used against <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> forces. As such, development of the AGM-65B began in 1975 before it was delivered during the late 1970s. When production of the AGM-65A/B was ended in 1978, more than 35,000 missiles had been built.

More versions of the Maverick appeared, among which was the <a href="Laser%20guidance">laser-guided</a> AGM-65C/E. Development of the AGM-65C started in 1978 by <a href="Rockwell%20International">Rockwell</a>, who built a number of development missiles for the USAF. Due to high cost, the version was not procured by the USAF, and instead entered service with the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> (USMC) as the AGM-65E.

Another major development was the AGM-65D, which employed an imaging infrared (IIR) seeker. By imaging on radiated heat, the IIR is all-weather operable as well as showing improved performance in acquiring and tracking the hot engines, such as in tanks and trucks, that were to be one of its major missions. The seekerhead mechanically scanned the scene over a nitrogen-cooled 4-by-4 pixel array using a series of mirrored facets machined into the inner surface of the ring-shaped main gyroscope. The five-year development period of the AGM-65D started in 1977 and ended with the first delivery to the USAF in October 1983. The version received <a href="initial%20operating%20capability">initial operating capability</a> in February 1986.

The AGM-65F is a hybrid Maverick combining the AGM-65D's IIR seeker and warhead and propulsion components of the AGM-65E. Deployed by the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> (USN), the AGM-65F is optimized for maritime strike roles. The first AGM-65F launch from the <a href="Lockheed%20P-3%20Orion">P-3C</a> took place in 1989, and in 1994, the USN awarded <a href="Unisys">Unisys</a> a contract to integrate the version with the P-3C. Meanwhile, Hughes produced the AGM-65G, which essentially has the same guidance system as the D, with some software modifications that track larger targets, coupled with a <a href="Shaped%20charge">shaped-charge</a> warhead.

In the mid-1990s to early 2000s, there were several ideas of enhancing the Maverick's potential. Among them was the stillborn plan to incorporate the Maverick <a href="Extremely%20high%20frequency">millimeter wave</a> <a href="active%20radar%20homing">active radar homing</a>, which can determine the exact shape of a target. Another study called "Longhorn Project" was conducted by Hughes, and later Raytheon following the absorption of Hughes into Raytheon, looked a Maverick version equipped with <a href="turbojet">turbojet</a> engines instead of rocket motors. The "Maverick ER", as it was dubbed, would have a "significant increase in range" compared to the Maverick's current range of . The proposal was abandoned, but if the Maverick ER had entered production, it would have replaced the AGM-119B Penguin carried on the MH-60R.
The most modern versions of the Maverick are the AGM-65H/K, which were in production . The AGM-65H was developed by coupling the AGM-65B with a <a href="charge-coupled%20device">charge-coupled device</a> (CCD) seeker optimized for desert operations and which has three times the range of the original TV-sensor; a parallel USN program aimed at rebuilding AGM-65Fs with newer CCD seekers resulted in the AGM-65J. The AGM-65K, meanwhile, was developed by replacing the AGM-65G's IR guidance system with an electro-optical television guidance system.

The Maverick has a <a href="modular%20design">modular design</a> construction, allowing a different combination of the guidance package and warhead to be attached to the rocket motor section to produce a different weapon. It has long-<a href="Chord%20%28aircraft%29">chord</a> <a href="delta%20wing">delta wing</a>s and a cylindrical body, reminiscent of the <a href="AIM-4%20Falcon">AIM-4 Falcon</a> and the <a href="AIM-54%20Phoenix">AIM-54 Phoenix</a>.

Different models of the AGM-65 have used electro-optical, laser, and infra-red guidance systems. The AGM-65 has two types of <a href="warhead">warhead</a>s: one has a <a href="contact%20fuze">contact fuze</a> in the nose, the other has a heavyweight warhead fitted with a delayed-action fuze, which penetrates the target with its <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a> before detonating. The latter is most effective against large, hard targets. The propulsion system for both types is a <a href="solid-fuel%20rocket">solid-fuel rocket</a> motor behind the warhead.

The Maverick missile is unable to lock onto targets on its own; it has to be given input by the pilot or <a href="weapon%20systems%20officer">weapon systems officer</a> (WSO) after which it follows the path to the target autonomously, allowing the WSO to <a href="Fire-and-forget">fire and forget</a>. In an <a href="Fairchild%20Republic%20A-10%20Thunderbolt%20II">A-10 Thunderbolt IIs</a>, for example, the video fed from the seeker head is relayed to a screen in the cockpit, where the pilot can check the locked target of the missile before launch. A crosshair on the <a href="head-up%20display">head-up display</a> is shifted by the pilot to set the approximate target while the missile will then automatically recognize and lock on to the target. Once the missile is launched, it requires no further assistance from the launch vehicle and tracks its target automatically. This fire-and-forget property is not shared by the E version that uses <a href="Laser%20guidance">semi-active laser homing</a>.


The Maverick was declared operational on 30 August 1972 with the <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-4%20Phantom%20II">F-4D/Es</a> and <a href="LTV%20A-7%20Corsair%20II">A-7s</a> initially cleared for the type; the missile made its combat debut four months later with the USAF in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. During the <a href="Yom%20Kippur%20War">Yom Kippur War</a> in October 1973, the Israelis used Mavericks to destroy and disable enemy vehicles. Deployment of early versions of the Mavericks in these two wars were successful due to the favorable atmospheric conditions that suited the electro-optical TV seeker. Ninety-nine missiles were fired during the two wars, eighty-four of which were successful.

In June 1975, during a border confrontation, a formation of Iranian F4E Phantoms destroyed a group of Iraqi tanks by firing 12 Mavericks at them. Five years later, during <a href="Operation%20Morvarid">Operation "Pearl"</a> as part of the <a href="Iran%E2%80%93Iraq%20War">Iran–Iraq War</a>, Iranian F-4s used Mavericks to sink three <a href="Osa%20class%20missile%20boat">Osa II</a> missile boats and four P-6 combat ships.
Due to weapons embargoes, Iran had to equip its <a href="AH-1J%20SeaCobra">AH-1J SeaCobra</a> helicopters with AGM-65 Maverick missiles and used them with some success in various operations such as <a href="Operation%20Fatholmobin">Operation "Undeniable Victory"</a> whereas Iranian AH-1J's fired 11 Mavericks.

In August 1990, Iraq invaded <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>. In early 1991, the US-led <a href="Coalition%20of%20the%20Gulf%20War">Coalition</a> executed <a href="Gulf%20War">Operation "Desert Storm"</a> during which Mavericks played a crucial role in the ousting of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Employed by <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F-15E%20Strike%20Eagle">F-15E Strike Eagle</a>s, <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20F/A-18%20Hornet">F/A-18 Hornet</a>s, <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20AV-8B%20Harrier%20II">AV-8B Harrier</a>s, <a href="General%20Dynamics%20F-16%20Fighting%20Falcon">F-16 Fighting Falcon</a>s and <a href="Fairchild%20Republic%20A-10%20Thunderbolt%20II">A-10 Thunderbolt IIs</a>, but used mainly by the last two, more than 5,000 Mavericks were deployed to attack armored targets. The most-used variant by the USAF was the IIR-guided AGM-65D. The reported hit rate by USAF Mavericks was 80–90%, while for the USMC it was 60%. The Maverick was used again in Iraq during the 2003 <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a>, during which 918 were fired.

The first time the Maverick were fired from a <a href="Lockheed%20P-3%20Orion">Lockheed P-3 Orion</a> at a hostile vessel was when the USN and coalition units came to the aid of Libyan rebels to engage the Libyan Coast Guard vessel "Vittoria" in the port of Misrata, Libya, during the late evening of 28 March 2011. "Vittoria" was engaged and fired upon by a USN P-3C Maritime Patrol aircraft with AGM-65 Maverick missiles.

LAU-117 Maverick launchers have been used on USN, USAF, and USMC aircraft:

The Maverick has been exported to at least 35 countries:

<doc id="3152" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3152" title="AIM-54 Phoenix">
AIM-54 Phoenix

The AIM-54 Phoenix is a radar-guided, long-range <a href="air-to-air%20missile">air-to-air missile</a> (AAM), carried in clusters of up to six missiles on the <a href="Grumman%20F-14%20Tomcat">Grumman F-14 Tomcat</a>, its only operational launch platform. The Phoenix was the United States' only long-range air-to-air missile. The combination of Phoenix missile and the <a href="AN/AWG-9">AN/AWG-9</a> guidance radar was the first aerial weapons system that could simultaneously engage multiple targets. Both the missile and the aircraft were used by the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> and are now retired, the AIM-54 Phoenix in 2004 and the F-14 in 2006. They were replaced by the shorter-range <a href="AIM-120%20AMRAAM">AIM-120 AMRAAM</a>, employed on the <a href="F/A-18%20Hornet">F/A-18 Hornet</a> and <a href="F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet">F/A-18E/F Super Hornet</a>. Following the retirement of the F-14 by the U.S. Navy, the weapon's only current operator is the <a href="Islamic%20Republic%20of%20Iran%20Air%20Force">Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force</a>. <a href="Multiservice%20tactical%20brevity%20code%23F">Brevity code</a> "Fox Three" was used when firing the AIM-54.

Since 1951, the Navy faced the initial threat from the <a href="Tupolev%20Tu-4">Tupolev Tu-4K 'Bull'</a> carrying <a href="anti-ship%20missile">anti-ship missile</a>s. Eventually, during the height of the Cold War, the threat would have expanded into regimental-size raids of <a href="Tu-16%20Badger">Tu-16 Badger</a> and <a href="Tu-22M%20Backfire">Tu-22M Backfire</a> bombers equipped with low-flying, long-range, high-speed, nuclear-armed cruise missiles and considerable <a href="electronic%20countermeasures">electronic countermeasures</a> (ECM) of various types.

The Navy would require a long-range, long-endurance <a href="interceptor%20aircraft">interceptor aircraft</a> to defend <a href="carrier%20battle%20group">carrier battle group</a>s against this threat. The proposed <a href="F6D%20Missileer">F6D Missileer</a> was intended to fulfill this mission and oppose the attack far from the fleet it was defending. The weapon needed for interceptor aircraft, the Bendix <a href="AAM-N-10%20Eagle">AAM-N-10 Eagle</a>, was to be an air-to-air missile of unprecedented range when compared to contemporary <a href="AIM-7%20Sparrow">AIM-7 Sparrow</a> missiles. It would work together with <a href="Northrop%20Grumman%20Electronic%20Systems">Westinghouse</a> <a href="AN/APQ-81">AN/APQ-81</a> radar. The Missileer project was cancelled in December 1960.

In the early 1960s, the U.S. Navy made the next interceptor attempt with the <a href="General%20Dynamics%E2%80%93Grumman%20F-111B">F-111B</a>, and they needed a new missile design. At the same time, the <a href="USAF">USAF</a> canceled the projects for their land-based high-speed interceptor aircraft, the <a href="North%20American%20XF-108%20Rapier">North American XF-108 Rapier</a> and the <a href="Lockheed%20YF-12">Lockheed YF-12</a>, and left the capable <a href="AIM-47%20Falcon">AIM-47 Falcon</a> missile at a quite advanced stage of development, but with no effective launch platform.

The AIM-54 Phoenix, developed for the F-111B fleet air defense fighter, had an airframe with four cruciform fins that was a scaled-up version of the AIM-47. One characteristic of the Missileer ancestry was that the radar sent it <a href="mid-course%20correction">mid-course correction</a>s, which allowed the fire control system to "loft" the missile up over the target into thinner air where it had better range.

The F-111B was canceled in 1968. Its weapons system, the AIM-54 working with the <a href="AWG-9%20radar">AWG-9 radar</a>, migrated to the new U.S. Navy fighter project, the VFX, which would later become the <a href="F-14">F-14 Tomcat</a>.

In 1977, development of a significantly improved Phoenix version, the AIM-54C, was developed to better counter projected threats from tactical anti-naval aircraft and cruise missiles, and its final upgrade included a re-programmable memory capability to keep pace with emerging ECM.

The AIM-54/AWG-9 combination had multiple track capability (up to 24 targets) and launch (up to 6 Phoenixes can be launched nearly simultaneously); the large missile is equipped with a conventional warhead.

On the F-14, four missiles can be carried under the fuselage tunnel attached to special aerodynamic pallets, plus two under glove stations. A full load of 6 Phoenix missiles and the unique launch rails weighs in at over , about twice the weight of Sparrows, so it was more common to carry a mixed load of 4 Phoenix, 2 <a href="AIM-7%20Sparrow">Sparrow</a>, and 2 <a href="AIM-9%20Sidewinder">Sidewinder</a> missiles.

Most other US aircraft relied on the smaller, <a href="Semi-active%20radar%20homing">semi-active</a> medium-range <a href="AIM-7%20Sparrow">AIM-7 Sparrow</a>. Semi-active guidance meant the aircraft no longer had a search capability while supporting the launched Sparrow, reducing situational awareness.

The Tomcat's radar could track up to 24 targets in <a href="track-while-scan">track-while-scan</a> mode, with the AWG-9 selecting up to 6 potential targets for the missiles. The pilot or <a href="radar%20intercept%20officer">radar intercept officer</a> (RIO) could then launch the Phoenix missiles once parameters were met. The large tactical information display (TID) in the RIO's cockpit gave information to the aircrew (the pilot had the ability to monitor the RIO's display) and the radar could continually search and track multiple targets after Phoenix missiles were launched, thereby maintaining <a href="situational%20awareness">situational awareness</a> of the battlespace.

The Link-4 datalink allowed US Navy Tomcats to share information with the <a href="E-2%20Hawkeye">E-2C Hawkeye</a> <a href="airborne%20early%20warning">AEW</a> aircraft. During <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Shield%20%28Gulf%20War%29">Desert Shield</a> in 1990, the Link-4A was introduced; this allowed the Tomcats to have a fighter-to-fighter datalink capability, further enhancing overall situational awareness. The F-14D entered service with the JTIDS that brought the even better Link-16 datalink "picture" to the cockpit.

The Phoenix has several guidance modes and achieves its longest range by using mid-course updates from the F-14A/B AWG-9 radar (APG-71 radar in the F-14D) as it climbs to cruise between and at close to Mach 5. Phoenix uses this high altitude to gain gravitational potential energy, which is later converted into kinetic energy as the missile dives at high velocity towards its target. At around from the target, the missile activates its own radar to provide terminal guidance. Minimum engagement range for the Phoenix is around and active homing would initiate upon launch.


The AIM-54 Phoenix was retired from USN service on September 30, 2004. F-14 Tomcats were retired on September 22, 2006. They were replaced by shorter-range <a href="AIM-120%20AMRAAM">AIM-120 AMRAAM</a>s, employed on the <a href="F/A-18E/F%20Super%20Hornet">F/A-18E/F Super Hornet</a>.

Despite the much-vaunted capabilities, the Phoenix was rarely used in combat, with only two confirmed launches and no confirmed targets destroyed in US Navy service, though a large number of <a href="Iranian%20aerial%20victories%20during%20the%20Iran-Iraq%20war">kills</a> were claimed by Iranian F-14s during the <a href="Iran%E2%80%93Iraq%20War">Iran–Iraq War</a>. The USAF <a href="F-15%20Eagle">F-15 Eagle</a> had responsibility for overland <a href="combat%20air%20patrol">combat air patrol</a> duties in Operation <a href="Desert%20Storm">Desert Storm</a> in 1991, primarily because of the onboard F-15 <a href="identification%20friend%20or%20foe">IFF</a> capabilities. The Tomcat did not have the requisite IFF capability mandated by the <a href="JFACC">JFACC</a> to satisfy the rules of engagement to utilize the Phoenix capability at <a href="beyond%20visual%20range">beyond visual range</a>. The AIM-54 was not adopted by any foreign nation besides <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, or any other US armed service, and was not used on any aircraft other than the F-14.

There is very little information available regarding Iran's use of its 79 F-14A Tomcats (delivered prior to 1979) in most <a href="Western%20world">western</a> outlets. The exception is a book released by <a href="Osprey%20Publishing">Osprey Publishing</a> titled "Iranian F-14 Tomcats in Combat" by Tom Cooper and Farzad Bishop. Most of the research contained in the book was based on pilot interviews. Reports vary on the use of the 285 missiles supplied to Iran, during the <a href="Iran%E2%80%93Iraq%20War">Iran–Iraq War</a>, 1980–88.

According to Cooper, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force kept its F-14 fighters and AIM-54 missiles in regular use during the entire Iran–Iraq War, though periodic lack of spares grounded large parts of the fleet at times. During late 1987, the stock of AIM-54 missiles was at its lowest, with fewer than 50 operational missiles available. The missiles needed fresh <a href="thermal%20batteries">thermal batteries</a> that could only be purchased from the US. Iran found a clandestine buyer that supplied it with batteries—which cost up to US$10,000 each. Iran received spares and parts for both the F-14s and AIM-54s from various sources during the Iran–Iraq War, and has received more spares after the conflict. Iran started a program to build spares for the planes and missiles, and although there are claims that it no longer relies on outside sources to keep its F-14s and AIM-54s operational, there is evidence that Iran continues to procure parts clandestinely.

Both the F-14 Tomcat and AIM-54 Phoenix missile continue in the service of the <a href="Islamic%20Republic%20of%20Iran%20Air%20Force">Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force</a>. The operational abilities of these aircraft and missiles are questionable, since the US refused to supply spare parts and maintenance after the 1979 revolution, except for a brief period during the <a href="Iran-Contra%20Affair">Iran-Contra Affair</a>.

Iran claimed to be working on building an equivalent missile and in 2013 unveiled the <a href="Fakour-90">Fakour-90</a>, an upgraded and reverse-engineered version of the Phoenix.


There were also test, evaluation, ground training, and captive air training versions of the missile; designated ATM-54, AEM-54, DATM-54A, and CATM-54. The flight versions had A and C versions. The DATM-54 was not made in a C version as there was no change in the ground handling characteristics.




The following is a list of AIM-54 Phoenix specifications:

The airframe is manufactured by <a href="Lockheed%20Martin">Lockheed Martin</a>, while <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> is responsible for the conversion into a gunship and for aircraft support. Developed during the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> as 'Project Gunship II', the AC-130 replaced the <a href="Douglas%20AC-47%20Spooky">Douglas AC-47 Spooky</a>, or 'Gunship I'. The sole operator is the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a>, which uses the AC-130U Spooky and AC-130W Stinger II variants for close air support, <a href="air%20interdiction">air interdiction</a>, and <a href="force%20protection">force protection</a>, with the AC-130J Ghostrider in development. Close air support roles include supporting ground troops, escorting <a href="convoy">convoy</a>s, and urban operations. Air interdiction missions are conducted against planned targets and targets of opportunity. Force protection missions include defending <a href="air%20base">air base</a>s and other facilities. AC-130Us are based at <a href="Hurlburt%20Field">Hurlburt Field</a>, Florida, while AC-130Ws are based at <a href="Cannon%20AFB">Cannon AFB</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>; gunships can be deployed worldwide. The squadrons are part of the <a href="Air%20Force%20Special%20Operations%20Command">Air Force Special Operations Command</a> (AFSOC), a component of the <a href="United%20States%20Special%20Operations%20Command">United States Special Operations Command</a> (SOCOM).

The AC-130 has an <a href="Cabin%20pressurization">unpressurized</a> cabin, with the weaponry mounted to fire from the <a href="Port%20and%20starboard">port side</a> of the fuselage. During an attack, the gunship performs a <a href="pylon%20turn">pylon turn</a>, flying in a large circle around the target, therefore being able to fire at it for far longer than in a conventional <a href="strafing">strafing</a> attack. The AC-130H Spectre was armed with two <a href="M61%20Vulcan">M61 Vulcan</a> cannons, one <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm">Bofors 40 mm</a> cannon, and one <a href="M102%20howitzer">M102 howitzer</a>; after 1994, the cannons were removed. The upgraded AC-130U Spooky has a single <a href="GAU-12%20Equalizer">GAU-12 Equalizer</a> cannon in place of the Spectre's two cannons, an improved fire control system, and increased ammunition capacity.

The new AC-130J is based on the <a href="MC-130J%20Combat%20Shadow%20II">MC-130J Combat Shadow II</a> special operations tanker . The AC-130W is armed with one <a href="Mk44%20Bushmaster%20II">30 mm Bushmaster cannon</a>, <a href="AGM-176%20Griffin">AGM-176 Griffin</a> missiles, and <a href="GBU-39%20Small%20Diameter%20Bomb">GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb</a>s (SDBs).

During the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, the <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">C-130 Hercules</a> was selected to replace the <a href="Douglas%20AC-47%20Spooky">Douglas AC-47 Spooky</a> gunship (Project Gunship I) in order to improve mission endurance and increase capacity to carry munitions. Capable of flying faster than helicopters and at high altitudes with excellent <a href="Loiter%20%28flight%29">loiter</a> time, the use of the <a href="pylon%20turn">pylon turn</a> allowed the AC-47 to deliver continuous accurate fire to a single point on the ground.
In 1967, JC-130A 54-1626 was selected for conversion into the prototype AC-130A gunship (Project Gunship II). The modifications were done at <a href="Wright-Patterson%20Air%20Force%20Base">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</a> by the Aeronautical Systems Division. A direct view <a href="Night%20vision%20device">night vision telescope</a> was installed in the forward door, an early <a href="forward%20looking%20infrared">forward looking infrared</a> device in the forward part of the left wheel well, and Gatling guns fixed facing down and aft along the left side. The <a href="Analog%20computer">analog</a> <a href="fire%20control%20computer">fire control computer</a> prototype was handcrafted by <a href="RAF">RAF</a> Wing Commander Tom Pinkerton at the USAF Avionics Laboratory at Wright-Patterson AFB. Flight testing of the prototype was performed primarily at <a href="Eglin%20Air%20Force%20Base">Eglin Air Force Base</a>, followed by further testing and modifications. By September 1967, the aircraft was certified ready for combat testing and was flown to <a href="Nha%20Trang%20Air%20Base">Nha Trang Air Base</a>, <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> for a 90-day test program. The AC-130 was later supplemented by the <a href="Fairchild%20AC-119">AC-119 Shadow</a> (Project Gunship III), which later proved to be underpowered.

Seven more <a href="warplane">warplane</a>s were converted to the "Plain Jane" configuration like the AC-130 prototype in 1968, and one aircraft received the "Surprise Package" refit in 1969. The Surprise Package upgrade included the latest <a href="20%20mm%20caliber">20 mm</a> rotary autocannons and <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">40 mm Bofors cannon</a> but no 7.62 mm close support armament. The Surprise Package configuration served as a test bed for the avionic systems and armament for the AC-130E. In 1970, ten more AC-130As were acquired under the "Pave Pronto" project. In the summer of 1971, Surprise Package AC-130s were converted to the Pave Pronto configuration and assumed the new nickname of 'Thor'. Conversion of C-130Es into AC-130Es for the "PAVE Spectre" project followed. Regardless of their project names the aircraft were more commonly referred to by the squadron's call sign 'Spectre'.

In 2007, <a href="Air%20Force%20Special%20Operations%20Command">Air Force Special Operations Command</a> (AFSOC) initiated a program to upgrade the armament of AC-130s. The test program planned for the 25 mm GAU-12/U and 40 mm Bofors cannon on the AC-130U gunships to be replaced with two <a href="30%20mm%20caliber">30 mm</a> Mk 44 <a href="Bushmaster%20II">Bushmaster II</a> cannons. In 2007, the Air Force modified four AC-130U gunships as test platforms for the Bushmasters. These were referred to as AC-130U Plus 4 or AC-130U+4. AFSOC, however, canceled its plans to install the new cannons on its fleet of AC-130Us. It has since removed the guns and re-installed the original 40 mm and 25 mm cannons and returned the planes to combat duty. Brigadier General Bradley A. Heithold, AFSOC's director of plans, programs, requirements, and assessments, said on 11 August 2008 that the effort was canceled because of problems with the Bushmaster's accuracy in tests "at the altitude we were employing it". There were also schedule considerations that drove the decision, he said.

There were also plans to possibly replace the 105 mm <a href="M102%20howitzer">cannon</a> with a <a href="Breech-loading%20weapon">breech-loading</a> 120 mm <a href="M120%20mortar">M120 mortar</a>, and to give the AC-130 a standoff capability using either the <a href="AGM-114%20Hellfire">AGM-114 Hellfire</a> missile, the <a href="Advanced%20Precision%20Kill%20Weapon%20System">Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System</a> (based on the <a href="Hydra%2070">Hydra 70</a> rocket), or the <a href="GBU-44/B%20Viper%20Strike">Viper Strike</a> <a href="glide%20bomb">glide bomb</a>.

In 2010, the Air Force awarded <a href="L-3%20Communications">L-3 Communications</a> a $61 million contract to add precision strike packages to eight <a href="Lockheed%20MC-130">MC-130W Combat Spear</a> special-mission aircraft to give them a gunship-like attack capability; such-equipped MC-130Ws are known as "Dragon Spears". Air Force Special Operations Command is arming these aircraft to relieve the high operational demands on AC-130 gunships until new AC-130Js enter service. The MC-130W Dragon Spear was renamed the AC-130W Stinger II in 2011. The precision strike packages consist of a 30 mm gun and several <a href="precision%20guided%20munition">precision guided munition</a>s (PGMs). Rails are mounted on the out-board pylon of the wing for four Hellfire missiles, SDBs, or <a href="GBU-53/B">SDB IIs</a> under each. 10 Common Launch Tubes (CLTs) are mounted on the rear ramp to fire Griffin A missiles; additional missiles are stored in the aircraft that can be reloaded in flight. CLTs are able to fire other small munitions able to fit inside the -diameter, -long tubes.

The Air Force launched an initiative in 2011 to acquire 16 new gunships based on new-built <a href="MC-130J%20Combat%20Shadow%20II">MC-130J Combat Shadow II</a> special operations tankers outfitted with a "precision strike package" to give them an attack capability, requesting $1.6 billion from Fiscal Years 2011 through 2015. This would increase the size of the gunship fleet to 33 aircraft, a net increase of eight after the planned retirement of eight aging AC-130Hs. The first aircraft would be bought in Fiscal 2012, followed by two in Fiscal 2013, five in Fiscal 2014, and the final eight in Fiscal 2015. The decision to retain the C-130 came after funding for 16 <a href="Alenia%20C-27J%20Spartan">C-27Js</a> was removed from the fiscal 2010 budget. The AC-130J will follow the path of the <a href="Dragon%20Spear">Dragon Spear</a> program. On 9 January 2013, the Air Force began converting the first MC-130J Combat Shadow II into an AC-130J Ghostrider and delivered it to AFSOC on 29 July 2015. The first AC-130J is to enter service in 2017. The AC-130J has two planned increments: the Block 10 configuration includes an internal 30 mm gun, small diameter bombs, and laser-guided missiles launched from the rear cargo door; and Block 20 configuration adds a 105 mm cannon, large aircraft <a href="infrared%20countermeasures">infrared countermeasures</a>, wing-mounted Hellfire missiles, and radio-frequency countermeasures.

The Air Force decided to add a 105 mm cannon to the AC-130J in addition to the 30 mm cannon and smart bombs, the shells being more accurate and cheaper than dropping SDBs. AFSOC is interested in adding a <a href="directed-energy%20weapon">directed-energy weapon</a> to the AC-130J by 2020, similar to the previous <a href="Advanced%20Tactical%20Laser">Advanced Tactical Laser</a> program. It is to produce a beam of up to 120 kW, or potentially even 180–200 kW, weigh about , defensively destroy anti-aircraft missiles, and offensively engage communications towers, boats, cars, and aircraft. However, laser armament may only be installed on a few aircraft rather than the entire AC-130J fleet; the laser will be mounted on the side in place of the 30 mm cannon. Other potential additions include an <a href="active%20denial%20system">active denial system</a> to perform airborne crowd control, and small <a href="unmanned%20aerial%20vehicle">unmanned aerial vehicle</a>s from the common launch tubes to provide remote video feed and coordinates to weapons operators through cloud cover. Called the Tactical Off-board Sensor (TOBS), the drones would be expendable and fly along a pre-programed orbit to verify targets the aircraft can't see itself because of bad weather or standing off from air defenses. AFSOC will initially utilize the <a href="Raytheon%20Coyote">Raytheon Coyote</a> small UAV for the TOBS mission, as it is an <a href="Commercial%20off-the-shelf">off-the-shelf</a> design with a one-hour endurance, but plans to fulfill the role with a new drone capable of a four-hour endurance by 2019.

The Air Force is also interested in acquiring a glide bomb that can be launched from the common launch tubes capable of hitting ground vehicles traveling as fast as 120 km/h (70 mph) while above . In June 2016, <a href="Dynetics">Dynetics</a> was awarded a contract by SOCOM to integrate its tactical munition onto the AC-130. Designated the <a href="GBU-69/B%20Small%20Glide%20Munition">GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition</a>, the weapon weighs and is armed with a blast-fragmentation warhead that can detonate by direct impact or at a pre-selected height; despite being smaller, being unpowered allows more volume for its warhead to be heavier than those on the Hellfire and Griffin A missiles, and respectively. Guidance is provided by a GPS receiver with anti-spoofing software and four Distributed Aperture <a href="semi-active%20laser">Semi-Active Laser</a> Seeker (DASALS) apertures adapted from the <a href="APKWS">WGU-59/B APKWS</a> for terminal guidance. Fielding is planned in 2017. Dynetics was awarded a contract to deliver an initial batch of 70 SGMs in June 2017, with plans to buy up to 1,000.

By 2018, AC-130 gunships will have been providing close air support for special operators for 50 years. Although the aircraft have been kept relevant through constant upgrades to their weaponry, sensor packages, and countermeasures, they are not expected to be survivable in future non-permissive environments due to their high signatures and low airspeeds. Military analysts, such as the <a href="Center%20for%20Strategic%20and%20Budgetary%20Assessments">Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments</a>, have suggested that AFSOC invest in more advanced technologies to fill the role to operate in future contested combat zones, including a mix of low-cost disposable unmanned and stealthy strike aircraft.

The AC-130 is a heavily armed long-endurance aircraft carrying an array of anti-ground oriented weapons that are integrated with sophisticated sensors, navigation, and <a href="fire-control%20system">fire-control system</a>s. It is capable of delivering precision firepower or area-saturation fire over a target area over a long period of time, at night or in adverse weather. The sensor suite consists of a television sensor, <a href="infrared">infrared</a> sensor, and <a href="radar">radar</a>. These sensors allow the gunship to visually or electronically identify friendly ground forces and targets in most weather conditions.

The AC-130U is equipped with the <a href="AN/APQ-180">AN/APQ-180</a>, a <a href="synthetic%20aperture%20radar">synthetic aperture radar</a> for long-range target detection and identification. The gunship's navigational devices include <a href="inertial%20navigation%20system">inertial navigation system</a>s and a <a href="Global%20Positioning%20System">Global Positioning System</a>. The AC-130U employs technologies developed in the 1990s which allow it to attack two targets simultaneously. It has twice the <a href="Ammunition">munitions</a> capacity of the AC-130H. Although the AC-130U conducts some operations in daylight, most of its combat missions are conducted at night. The AC-130H's unit cost is US$132.4 million, and the AC-130U's cost is US$190 million (fiscal 2001 dollars).

During the Vietnam era, the various AC-130 versions following the Pave Pronto modifications were equipped with a <a href="magnetic%20anomaly%20detector">magnetic anomaly detector</a> system called Black Crow (designated AN/ASD-5), a highly sensitive passive device with a <a href="phased-array">phased-array</a> <a href="Antenna%20%28radio%29">antenna</a> located in the left-front nose <a href="radome">radome</a> that could pick up localized deviations in the <a href="Earth%27s%20magnetic%20field">Earth's magnetic field</a> normally used to detect submerged <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s. The Black Crow system was <a href="Master-slave%20%28technology%29">slaved</a> into the targeting computers of the AC-130A/E/H, enabling the detection of the unshielded <a href="ignition%20coil">ignition coil</a>s of North Vietnamese trucks hidden under dense jungle foliage along the <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20trail">Ho Chi Minh trail</a>. It could also detect hand-held transmitter signals of air controllers on the ground to identify and locate targets.

The PGM-38/U enhanced 25 mm <a href="high%20explosive%20incendiary">high explosive incendiary</a> round was created to expand the AC-130U gunships' mission in standoff range and survivability for its 25 mm <a href="GAU-12%20Equalizer">GAU-12/U</a> gun. This round is a combination of the existing PGU-25 HEI and a M758 fuze designated as FMU-151/B to meet the MIL-STD-1316. The FMU-151 has an improved arming delay with multi-sensitive range.

The AC-130 gunship first arrived in South Vietnam on 21 September 1967 under the Gunship II program and began combat operations over Laos and South Vietnam that year. In June 1968, AC-130s were deployed to <a href="Tan%20Son%20Nhut">Tan Son Nhut</a> AB near Saigon for support against the <a href="Tet%20Offensive">Tet Offensive</a>. By 30 October 1968, enough AC-130 Gunship IIs arrived to form a squadron, the <a href="16th%20Special%20Operations%20Squadron">16th Special Operations Squadron</a> (SOS) of the <a href="8th%20Tactical%20Fighter%20Wing">8th Tactical Fighter Wing</a> (TFW), at <a href="Ubon%20Royal%20Thai%20Air%20Force%20Base">Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base</a>, Thailand. It was at this time that the C-130A gunship was designated the AC-130A.

On 18 August 1968, an AC-130 gunship flying an armed reconnaissance mission in Vietnam's III Corps was diverted to support the <a href="Katum%20Camp">Katum Special Forces Camp</a>. The ground commander quickly assessed the accurate fire and capabilities of this weapon system and called for fire on his own perimeter when the Viet Cong attempted to bridge the wire on the west side of his position.

By December 1968, most AC-130s flew under <a href="F-4%20Phantom%20II">F-4 Phantom II</a> escort (to protect the gunship against heavy and concentrated AAA fire) from the 497th Tactical Fighter Squadron, normally three Phantoms per Gunship. On 24 May 1969, the first Spectre gunship was lost to enemy fire.

In late 1969, under code name "Surprise Package", 56-0490 arrived with solid-state laser-illuminated low-light-level-TV with a companion YAG <a href="laser%20designator">laser designator</a>, an improved <a href="forward%20looking%20infrared">forward looking infrared</a> (FLIR) sensor, video recording for TV and FLIR, an <a href="inertial%20navigation%20system">inertial navigation system</a>, and a prototype <a href="Digital%20data">digital</a> <a href="fire%20control%20computer">fire control computer</a>. The remaining AC-130s were refitted with upgraded similar equipment in the summer of 1970, and then redeployed to Ubon RTAFB. On 25 October 1971, the first "Cadillac" gunship, the AC-130E arrived in Vietnam. On 17 February 1972, the first 105 mm cannon arrived for service with Spectre and was installed on Gunship 570. It was used from mid-February until the aircraft received battle damage to its right flap. The cannon was switched to Gunship 571 and was used until 30 March when the aircraft was shot down.

On 28 January 1973, the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Accords">Vietnam peace accord</a> went into effect, marking the end of Spectre operations in Vietnam. Spectre was still needed and active in the region, supporting operations in Laos and Cambodia. On 22 February 1973, American offensive operations in Laos ended and the gunships became totally committed to operations in the Cambodian conflict.

On 12 April 1975, the <a href="Khmer%20Rouge">Khmer Rouge</a> were threatening the capital of <a href="Phnom%20Penh">Phnom Penh</a> and AC-130s were called on to help in <a href="Operation%20Eagle%20Pull">Operation Eagle Pull</a>, the final evacuation of American and allied officials from Phnom Penh before it fell to the communists. The AC-130 was also over Saigon on 30 April 1975 to protect the final evacuation in <a href="Operation%20Frequent%20Wind">Operation Frequent Wind</a>. Spectres were also called in when the <a href="Mayaguez%20incident">SS Mayaguez</a> was seized, on the open sea, by Khmer Rouge soldiers and sailors on 15 May 1975.

Six AC-130s and 52 air crew members were lost during the war. AC-130s destroyed more than 10,000 trucks and participated in many crucial close air support missions in Vietnam.

With the conclusion of hostilities in Southeast Asia in the mid-1970s, the AC-130H became the sole gunship in the regular Air Force, home based at <a href="Hurlburt%20Field">Hurlburt Field</a>, Florida, while the AC-130A fleet was transferred to the <a href="Air%20Force%20Reserve">Air Force Reserve</a>'s 919th Tactical Airlift Group (919 TAG) at <a href="Eglin%20AFB">Eglin AFB</a> Auxiliary Field #3/<a href="Duke%20Field">Duke Field</a>, Florida. With the transition to the AC-130A, the 919 TAG was then redesignated as the <a href="919th%20Special%20Operations%20Wing">919th Special Operations Group</a> (919 SOG).

In the late 1970s, when the AC-130H fleet was first being modified for in-flight refueling capability, a demonstration mission was planned and flown from Hurlburt Field, Florida, non-stop, to conduct a 2-hour live-fire mission over Empire Firing Range in the Republic of Panama, then return home. This 13-hour mission with two in-flight refuelings from <a href="Boeing%20KC-135%20Stratotanker">KC-135</a> tankers proved the validity of flying long-range missions outside the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous United States</a> to attack targets then return to home base without intermediate stops.

AC-130s from both the <a href="4th%20Special%20Operations%20Squadron">4th</a> and <a href="16th%20Special%20Operations%20Squadron">16th</a> Special Operations Squadrons have been deployed in nearly every conflict the United States has been involved in, officially and unofficially, since the end of the Vietnam War.

In July 1979, AC-130H crews deployed to <a href="Howard%20Air%20Force%20Base">Howard Air Force Base</a>, Panama, as a precaution against possible hostile actions against American personnel during the <a href="Nicaraguan%20Revolution">Nicaraguan Revolution</a>. New time aloft and non-stop distance records were subsequently set by a 16th SOS 2-ship AC-130H formation flight that departed Hurlburt Field on 13 November 1979 and landed on 15 November at <a href="Andersen%20Air%20Force%20Base">Andersen Air Force Base</a>, <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, a distance of and 29 hours 43 minutes non-stop, refueling four times in-flight. Refueling support for the Guam deployment was provided by KC-135 crews from the 305th Air Refueling Wing from <a href="Grissom%20AFB">Grissom AFB</a>, Indiana.

In November 1979, four AC-130H gunships flew nonstop from Hurlburt Field to Anderson AFB, Guam, because of the <a href="Iran%20hostage%20crisis">hostage situation at the Embassy in Iran</a>. At Guam, AC-130H crews developed communications-out/lights-out refueling procedures for later employment by trial-and-error. This deployment with the 1 SOW/CC as Task Force commander was directed from the office of the CJCS for fear that Iranian militants could begin executing American Embassy personnel who had been <a href="Iran%20hostage%20crisis">taken hostage on 4 November</a>. One early option considered AC-130H retaliatory punitive strikes deep within Iran. Later gunship flights exceeded the 1979 Hurlburt-to-Guam flight. Upon return in March 1980, the four planes soon found themselves in Egypt to support the <a href="Operation%20Eagle%20Claw">ill-fated hostage rescue attempt</a>.
During <a href="Invasion%20of%20Grenada">Operation Urgent Fury</a> in Grenada in 1983, AC-130s suppressed enemy air defense systems and attacked ground forces enabling the assault of the <a href="Point%20Salines%20International%20Airport">Point Salines Airfield</a> via <a href="airdrop">airdrop</a> and air-land of friendly forces. The AC-130 aircrew earned the <a href="William%20H.%20Tunner">Lieutenant General William H. Tunner</a> Award for the mission.

The AC-130Hs of the <a href="16th%20Special%20Operations%20Squadron">16th Special Operations Squadron</a> unit maintained an ongoing rotation to Howard AB, Panama, monitoring activities in El Salvador and other Central American points of interest, with rules of engagement eventually permitting attacks on <a href="FMLN">FMLN</a> targets. This commitment of Maintainers and crews started in 1983 and lasted until 1990. The AC-130 is considered to have hastened the end of the <a href="Salvadoran%20Civil%20War">Salvadoran Civil War</a> in the 1980s. Crews flew undercover missions from Honduras and attacked guerrilla camps and concentrations.

AC-130s also had a primary role during the <a href="United%20States%20invasion%20of%20Panama">United States invasion of Panama</a> (named Operation Just Cause) in 1989, when they destroyed <a href="Military%20of%20Panama">Panama Defense Force</a> headquarters and numerous command-and-control facilities, and provided close air support for US ground troops. Aircrews earned the <a href="Mackay%20Trophy">Mackay Trophy</a> for the most meritorious flight of the year, and the Tunner Award.

During the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a> of 1990–91 (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm), Regular Air Force and Air Force Reserve AC-130s provided close air support and force protection (air base defense) for ground forces, and battlefield interdiction. The primary interdiction targets were early warning/<a href="Ground-controlled%20interception">ground control intercept</a> (EW/GCI) sites along the southern border of <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>. At its standard altitude of 12,000 feet, the aircraft had a proven ability to engage moving ground targets. The first gunship to enter the <a href="Battle%20of%20Khafji">Battle of Khafji</a> helped stop a southbound Iraqi armored column on 29 January 1991. One day later, three more gunships provided further aid to <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marines</a> participating in the operation. The gunships attacked Iraqi positions and columns moving south to reinforce their positions north of the city.

Despite the threat of <a href="surface-to-air%20missile">surface-to-air missile</a>s (SAMs) and increasing visibility during the early morning hours of 31 January 1991, one AC-130H, AF Serial No. 69-6567, call-sign <a href="Spirit%2003">Spirit 03</a>, opted to stay to continue to protect the Marines. A lone Iraqi with a <a href="Strela-2">Strela-2</a> <a href="MANPADS">MANPADS</a> shot Spirit 03 down, and all 14 crew members died.

The military has used AC-130 gunships during the humanitarian operations in <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a> (<a href="Unified%20Task%20Force">Operation Restore Hope</a> and <a href="Operation%20United%20Shield">Operation United Shield</a>) in 1992–93, <a href="Operation%20Uphold%20Democracy">Operation Uphold Democracy</a> in Haiti in 1994. AC-130s took part in <a href="Timeline%20of%20United%20States%20military%20operations%231991%E2%80%931999">Operation Assured Response</a> in Liberia in 1996 and in <a href="Operation%20Silver%20Wake">Operation Silver Wake</a> in 1997, the evacuation of American <a href="non-combatants">non-combatants</a> from <a href="Albania">Albania</a>.

AC-130s took part in the <a href="NATO">NATO</a> missions in <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> during the 1990s.

The AC-130U gunship set a new record for the longest sustained flight by any C-130 on 22 and 23 October 1997, when two AC-130U gunships flew 36 hours nonstop from <a href="Hurlburt%20Field">Hurlburt Field</a>, Florida to <a href="Taegu%20Air%20Base">Taegu Air Base</a> (Daegu), <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a>, being refueled seven times in the air by KC-135 tankers. The two gunships took on 410,000 lb (186,000 kg) of fuel. Gunships also were part of the buildup of U.S. forces in 1998 to compel <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> to allow <a href="UNSCOM">UNSCOM</a> weapons inspections.

The U.S. has used gunships with deployments to the <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001-present%29">War in Afghanistan</a> (Operation Enduring Freedom – Afghanistan) (2001–present), and <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a> (Operation Iraqi Freedom) (2003–11). AC-130 strikes were directed by special forces on known Taliban locations during the early days of the war in Afghanistan. U.S. Special Operations Forces are using the AC-130 to support its operations. The day after arriving in Afghanistan, the AC-130s attacked Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces near the city of Konduz and were directly responsible for the city's surrender the next day. On 26 November 2001, Spectres were called in to put down <a href="Battle%20of%20Qala-i-Jangi">a rebellion</a> at the prison fort of <a href="Qala-I-Janghi">Qala-I-Janghi</a>. The 16 SOS flew missions over Mazar-i-Sharif, <a href="History%20of%20Kunduz">Kunduz</a>, Kandahar, Shkin, Asadabad, Bagram, Baghran, Tora Bora, and virtually every other part of Afghanistan. The Spectre participated in countless operations within Afghanistan, performing on-call close air support and armed reconnaissance. In March 2002, three AC-130 Spectres provided 39 crucial combat missions in support of <a href="Operation%20Anaconda">Operation Anaconda</a> in Afghanistan. During the intense fighting, the planes fired more than 1,300 40 mm and 1,200 105 mm rounds.

Close air support was the main mission of the AC-130 in Iraq. Night after night, at least one AC-130 was in the air to fulfill one or more air support requests (ASRs). A typical mission had the AC–130 supporting a single brigade’s ASRs followed by aerial refueling and another two hours with another brigade or SOF team. The use of AC-130s in places like Fallujah, urban settings where insurgents were among crowded populations of non-combatants, was criticized by human rights groups. AC-130s were also used for intelligence gathering with their sophisticated long-range video, infrared and radar sensors. In 2007, US Special Operations forces also used the AC-130 in attacks on suspected <a href="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a> militants in Somalia.

There were eight AC-130H and seventeen AC-130U aircraft in active-duty service as of July 2010. In March 2011, the U.S. Air Force deployed two AC-130U gunships to take part in <a href="Operation%20Odyssey%20Dawn">Operation Odyssey Dawn</a>, the <a href="2011%20military%20intervention%20in%20Libya">U.S. military intervention in Libya</a>, which eventually came under <a href="NATO">NATO</a> as <a href="Operation%20Unified%20Protector">Operation Unified Protector</a>.
By September 2013, 14 MC-130W Dragon Spear aircraft have been converted to AC-130W Stinger II gunships. The Stinger gunships have been deployed to Afghanistan to replace the aging AC-130H aircraft and provide an example for the new AC-130J Ghostrider. Modifications began with crews cutting holes in the plane to make room for weapons, and adding kits and bomb bases for laser-guided munitions. Crews added a 105 mm cannon, 20-inch infrared and electro-optical sensors, and the ability to carry 250-pound bombs on the wings.

On 15 November 2015, two days after the <a href="November%202015%20Paris%20attacks">attacks in Paris</a> by <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">ISIL</a>, AC-130s and <a href="A-10%20Thunderbolt%20II">A-10 Thunderbolt II</a> attack aircraft destroyed a convoy of over 100 ISIL-operated oil tanker trucks in Syria. The attacks were part of an intensification of the U.S.-led <a href="Military%20intervention%20against%20ISIL">Military intervention against ISIL</a> called <a href="Operation%20Tidal%20Wave%20II">Operation Tidal Wave II</a> (named after the original <a href="Operation%20Tidal%20Wave">Operation Tidal Wave</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, a failed attempt to raid German oil fields that resulted in heavy aircraft and aircrew loss) in an attempt to cut off oil smuggling as a source of funding for the group.

The U.S. has continued to use the aircraft in the War in Afghanistan. On 3 October 2015, <a href="Kunduz%20hospital%20airstrike">five attacks</a> on a <a href="Doctors%20Without%20Borders">Doctors Without Borders</a> hospital in <a href="Kunduz%2C%20Afghanistan">Kunduz, Afghanistan</a> were carried out by an AC-130.


<a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a>







One of the first seven AC-130A aircraft deployed to <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> was AF serial no. 53-3129, named "First Lady" in November 1970. This aircraft was a conversion of the first production C-130. On 25 March 1971, it took an <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft artillery</a> hit in the belly just aft of the nose gear wheel well over the <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20trail">Ho Chi Minh trail</a> in Laos. The 37 mm shell destroyed everything below the crew deck and barely missed striking two crew members. The pilot was able to crash land the aircraft safely. In 1975, after the conclusion of US involvement in the Vietnam war, it was transferred to the <a href="Air%20Force%20Reserve%20Command">Air Force Reserve</a>, where it served with the <a href="711th%20Special%20Operations%20Squadron">711th Special Operations Squadron</a> of the <a href="919th%20Special%20Operations%20Wing">919th Special Operations Wing</a>. In 1980, the aircraft was upgraded from the original three-bladed propellers to the quieter four-bladed propellers and was eventually retired in late 1995. The retirement also marked an end to the <a href="Air%20Force%20Reserve%20Command">Air Force Reserve Command</a> flying the AC-130A. The aircraft now sits on display in the final Air Force Reserve Command configuration with grey paint, black markings, and the four-bladed Hamilton Sunstrand 54H60-91 props at the <a href="Air%20Force%20Armament%20Museum">Air Force Armament Museum</a> at <a href="Eglin%20Air%20Force%20Base">Eglin Air Force Base</a>, Florida, USA.

A second AC-130A, AF serial no. 56-0509, named the "Ultimate End", was accepted by the Air Force on 28 February 1957, and modified to the AC-130A configuration on 27 July 1970. The aircraft participated in the Vietnam War and the <a href="Mayaguez%20incident">rescue</a> of the <a href="SS%20Mayaguez">SS Mayaguez</a>. "Ultimate End" demonstrated the durability of the C-130 after surviving hits in five places by 37 mm anti-aircraft artillery on 12 December 1970, extensive left wing leading edge damage on 12 April 1971 and a 57 mm round damaging the belly and injuring one crewman on 4 March 1972. "Ultimate End" was reassigned to the <a href="Air%20Force%20Reserve">Air Force Reserve</a>'s <a href="919th%20Special%20Operations%20Wing">919th Special Operations Wing</a> at <a href="Eglin%20AFB">Eglin AFB</a> Auxiliary Field No.3 / <a href="Duke%20Field">Duke Field</a> on 17 June 1975, where it continued in service until retired in the fall 1994 and transferred to <a href="Air%20Force%20Special%20Operations%20Command">Air Force Special Operations Command</a>'s "Heritage Air Park" at <a href="Hurlburt%20Field">Hurlburt Field</a>, Florida. While assigned to the <a href="711th%20Special%20Operations%20Squadron">711th Special Operations Squadron</a>, "Ultimate End" served in Operations JUST CAUSE in Panama, <a href="DESERT%20STORM">DESERT STORM</a> in Kuwait and Iraq, and UPHOLD DEMOCRACY in Haiti. After 36 years and seven months of service, 24 years as a gunship, "Ultimate End" retired from active service on 1 October 1994. It made its last flight from <a href="Duke%20Field">Duke Field</a> to <a href="Hurlburt%20Field">Hurlburt Field</a> on 20 October 1994. The Spectre Association dedicated "Ultimate End" (which served with the 16 SOS in Vietnam) on 4 May 1995. Lt Col Michael Byers, then 16 SOS commander, represented the active-duty gunship force and Clyde Gowdy of the Spectre Association represented all Spectre personnel past and present for the unveiling of a monument at the aircraft and the dedication as a whole.

A third AC-130A, AF serial no. 54-1630, is on display in the Cold War Gallery at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">National Museum of the United States Air Force</a> at <a href="Wright-Patterson%20AFB">Wright-Patterson AFB</a>, Ohio. Named "Azrael" for the <a href="Azrael">angel of death</a> in <a href="Islamic">Islam</a> who severs the soul from the body, this aircraft figured prominently in the closing hours of Operation Desert Storm. On 26 February 1991, Coalition ground forces were driving the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait. With an Air Force Reserve crew called to active duty, Azrael was sent to the <a href="Highway%20of%20Death">Al Jahra highway</a> (Highway 80) between <a href="Kuwait%20City">Kuwait City</a> and <a href="Basra">Basra</a>, Iraq, to intercept the convoys of tanks, trucks, buses, and cars fleeing the battle. Facing <a href="SA-6">SA-6</a> and <a href="SA-8">SA-8</a> surface-to-air missiles and 37 mm and 57 mm radar-guided anti-aircraft artillery the crew attacked and destroyed or disabled most of the convoys. "Azrael" was also assigned to the <a href="919th%20Special%20Operations%20Wing">919th Special Operations Wing</a> and retired to the museum in October 1995.

Another AC-130A, AF serial no. 54-1626, the original prototype AC-130 named "Gunship II" is on display at the outdoor Air Park at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">National Museum of the United States Air Force</a> at <a href="Wright-Patterson%20AFB">Wright-Patterson AFB</a>, Ohio. This aircraft served in Southeast Asia from 1967 to 1972, then served in JC-130A test configuration. It was transferred to the National Museum of the United States Air Force in 1976, and converted back to AC-130A configuration in the late 1990s.

AC-130A serial no. 54-1623, c/n 3010, named "Ghost Rider" served in Southeast Asia and later conflicts until being retired in 1997 to <a href="Dobbins%20AFB">Dobbins AFB</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>. Ghost Rider eventually was transferred and displayed at the Lockheed Museum at <a href="Marietta%2C%20Georgia">Marietta</a>, Georgia.

In <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>, an alternative algebra is an <a href="algebra%20over%20a%20field">algebra</a> in which multiplication need not be <a href="associative">associative</a>, only <a href="alternativity">alternative</a>. That is, one must have
for all "x" and "y" in the algebra.

Every <a href="associative%20algebra">associative algebra</a> is obviously alternative, but so too are some strictly <a href="non-associative%20algebra">non-associative algebra</a>s such as the <a href="octonion">octonion</a>s. The <a href="sedenion">sedenion</a>s, on the other hand, are not alternative.

Alternative algebras are so named because they are precisely the algebras for which the <a href="associator">associator</a> is <a href="alternating%20form">alternating</a>. The associator is a <a href="multilinear%20map">trilinear map</a> given by
By definition a multilinear map is alternating if it <a href="Vanish_%28mathematics%29">vanishes</a> whenever two of its arguments are equal. The left and right alternative identities for an algebra are equivalent to
Both of these identities together imply that the associator is totally <a href="skew-symmetric%20graph">skew-symmetric</a>. That is,
for any <a href="permutation">permutation</a> σ. It follows that
for all "x" and "y". This is equivalent to the "<a href="flexible%20identity">flexible identity</a>"
The associator of an alternative algebra is therefore alternating. Conversely, any algebra whose associator is alternating is clearly alternative. By symmetry, any algebra which satisfies any two of:
is alternative and therefore satisfies all three identities.

An alternating associator is always totally skew-symmetric. The converse holds so long as the <a href="characteristic%20%28algebra%29">characteristic</a> of the base field is not 2.


Artin's theorem states that in an alternative algebra the <a href="subalgebra">subalgebra</a> generated by any two elements is <a href="associative">associative</a>. Conversely, any algebra for which this is true is clearly alternative. It follows that expressions involving only two variables can be written unambiguously without parentheses in an alternative algebra. A generalization of Artin's theorem states that whenever three elements formula_12 in an alternative algebra associate (i.e., formula_13), the subalgebra generated by those elements is associative.

A corollary of Artin's theorem is that alternative algebras are <a href="power-associative">power-associative</a>, that is, the subalgebra generated by a single element is associative. The converse need not hold: the <a href="sedenion">sedenion</a>s are power-associative but not alternative.

In a unital alternative algebra, multiplicative inverses are unique whenever they exist. Moreover, for any invertible element formula_17 and all formula_18 one has
This is equivalent to saying the associator formula_20 vanishes for all such formula_17 and formula_18. If formula_17 and formula_18 are invertible then formula_25 is also invertible with inverse formula_26. The set of all invertible elements is therefore closed under multiplication and forms a <a href="Moufang%20loop">Moufang loop</a>. This "loop of units" in an alternative ring or algebra is analogous to the <a href="group%20of%20units">group of units</a> in an associative ring or algebra.

Kleinfeld's theorem states that any simple non-associative alternative ring is a generalized octonion algebra over its center.
The structure theory of alternative rings is presented in.

The projective plane over any alternative division ring is a <a href="Moufang%20plane">Moufang plane</a>.

The close relationship of alternative algebras and <a href="composition%20algebra">composition algebra</a>s was given by Guy Roos in 2008: He shows (page 162) the relation for an algebra "A" with unit element "e" and an <a href="involution%20%28mathematics%29">involutive</a> <a href="anti-automorphism">anti-automorphism</a> formula_27 such that "a" + "a"* and "aa"* are on the line <a href="linear%20span">spanned</a> by "e" for all "a" in "A".

Arbitrage

In <a href="economics">economics</a> and <a href="finance">finance</a>, arbitrage (, , ) is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more <a href="Market%20%28economics%29">market</a>s: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the <a href="market%20price">market price</a>s. When used by academics, an arbitrage is a (imagined, hypothetical, thought experiment) transaction that involves no negative <a href="cash%20flow">cash flow</a> at any probabilistic or temporal state and a positive cash flow in at least one state; in simple terms, it is the possibility of a risk-free profit after transaction costs. For instance, an arbitrage is present when there is the opportunity to instantaneously buy low and sell high.

In principle and in academic use, an arbitrage is risk-free; in common use, as in <a href="statistical%20arbitrage">statistical arbitrage</a>, it may refer to "expected" profit, though losses may occur, and in practice, there are always <a href="%23Risks">risk</a>s in arbitrage, some minor (such as fluctuation of prices decreasing profit margins), some major (such as devaluation of a currency or derivative). In academic use, an arbitrage involves taking advantage of differences in price of a "single" asset or "identical" cash-flows; in common use, it is also used to refer to differences between "similar" assets (<a href="relative%20value%20%28economics%29">relative value</a> or <a href="convergence%20trade">convergence trade</a>s), as in <a href="merger%20arbitrage">merger arbitrage</a>.

People who engage in arbitrage are called arbitrageurs —such as a bank or brokerage firm. The term is mainly applied to trading in <a href="financial%20instrument">financial instrument</a>s, such as <a href="Bond%20%28finance%29">bonds</a>, <a href="stock">stock</a>s, <a href="Derivative%20%28finance%29">derivatives</a>, <a href="Commodity">commodities</a> and <a href="Currency">currencies</a>.

"Arbitrage" is a French word and denotes a decision by an arbitrator or arbitration tribunal. (In modern French, """" usually means <a href="referee">referee</a> or <a href="umpire">umpire</a>.) In the sense used here it is first defined in 1704 by <a href="Mathieu%20de%20la%20Porte">Mathieu de la Porte</a> in his treatise "" as a consideration of different exchange rates to recognize the most profitable places of issuance and settlement for a bill of exchange ("".)

If the market prices do not allow for profitable arbitrage, the prices are said to constitute an arbitrage equilibrium, or arbitrage-free market. An arbitrage equilibrium is a precondition for a <a href="general%20equilibrium">general economic equilibrium</a>. The "no arbitrage" assumption is used in <a href="quantitative%20finance">quantitative finance</a> to calculate a unique <a href="risk%20neutral">risk neutral</a> price for <a href="Derivative%20%28finance%29">derivatives</a>.

This refers to the method of valuing a coupon-bearing financial instrument by discounting its future cash flows by multiple discount rates. By doing so, a more accurate price can be obtained than if the price is calculated with a present-value pricing approach. Arbitrage-free pricing is used for bond valuation and to detect arbitrage opportunities for investors.

For the purpose of valuing the price of a bond, its cash flows can each be thought of as packets of incremental cash flows with a large packet upon maturity, being the principal. Since the cash flows are dispersed throughout future periods, they must be discounted back to the present. In the present-value approach, the cash flows are discounted with one discount rate to find the price of the bond. In arbitrage-free pricing, multiple discount rates are used.

The present-value approach assumes that the yield of the bond will stay the same until maturity. This is a simplified model because interest rates may fluctuate in the future, which in turn affects the yield on the bond. The discount rate may be different for each of the cash flows for this reason. Each cash flow can be considered a zero-coupon instrument that pays one payment upon maturity. The discount rates used should be the rates of multiple zero-coupon bonds with maturity dates the same as each cash flow and similar risk as the instrument being valued. By using multiple discount rates, the arbitrage-free price is the sum of the <a href="discounted%20cash%20flow">discounted cash flow</a>s. Arbitrage-free price refers to the price at which no price arbitrage is possible.

The ideas of using multiple discount rates obtained from zero-coupon bonds and discount a similar bonds cash flow to find its price is derived from the yield curve. The yield curve is a curve of the yields of the same bond with different maturities. This curve can be used to view trends in market expectations of how interest rates will move in the future. In arbitrage-free pricing of a bond, a yield curve of similar zero-coupon bonds with different maturities is created. If the curve were to be created with Treasury securities of different maturities, they would be stripped of their coupon payments through bootstrapping. This is to transform the bonds into zero-coupon bonds. The yield of these zero-coupon bonds would then be plotted on a diagram with time on the "x"-axis and yield on the "y"-axis.

Since the yield curve displays market expectations on how yields and interest rates may move, the arbitrage-free pricing approach is more realistic than using only one discount rate. Investors can use this approach to value bonds and find mismatches in prices, resulting in an arbitrage opportunity. If a bond valued with the arbitrage-free pricing approach turns out to be priced higher in the market, an investor could have such an opportunity:

If the outcome from the valuation were the reversed case, the opposite positions would be taken in the bonds. This arbitrage opportunity comes from the assumption that the prices of bonds with the same properties will converge upon maturity. This can be explained through market efficiency, which states that arbitrage opportunities will eventually be discovered and corrected accordingly. The prices of the bonds in t move closer together to finally become the same at t.

Arbitrage is possible when one of three conditions is met:


Arbitrage is not simply the act of buying a product in one market and selling it in another for a higher price at some later time. The transactions must occur "simultaneously" to avoid exposure to market risk, or the risk that prices may change on one market before both transactions are complete. In practical terms, this is generally possible only with securities and financial products that can be traded electronically, and even then, when each leg of the trade is executed the prices in the market may have moved. Missing one of the legs of the trade (and subsequently having to trade it soon after at a worse price) is called 'execution risk' or more specifically 'leg risk'.

In the simplest example, any good sold in one market should sell for the same price in another. <a href="Merchant">Traders</a> may, for example, find that the price of wheat is lower in agricultural regions than in cities, purchase the good, and transport it to another region to sell at a higher price. This type of price arbitrage is the most common, but this simple example ignores the cost of transport, storage, risk, and other factors. "True" arbitrage requires that there be no market risk involved. Where securities are traded on more than one exchange, arbitrage occurs by simultaneously buying in one and selling on the other.

See <a href="rational%20pricing">rational pricing</a>, particularly <a href="rational%20pricing%23Arbitrage%20mechanics">arbitrage mechanics</a>, for further discussion.

Mathematically it is defined as follows:

where formula_2 and formula_3 denotes the portfolio value at time "t".


Arbitrage has the effect of causing prices in different markets to converge. As a result of arbitrage, the currency <a href="exchange%20rate">exchange rate</a>s, the price of <a href="Commodity">commodities</a>, and the price of securities in different markets tend to converge. The speed at which they do so is a measure of market efficiency. Arbitrage tends to reduce <a href="price%20discrimination">price discrimination</a> by encouraging people to buy an item where the price is low and resell it where the price is high (as long as the buyers are not prohibited from reselling and the transaction costs of buying, holding and reselling are small relative to the difference in prices in the different markets).

Arbitrage moves different currencies toward <a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">purchasing power parity</a>. As an example, assume that a car purchased in the United States is cheaper than the same car in Canada. Canadians would buy their cars across the border to exploit the arbitrage condition. At the same time, Americans would buy US cars, transport them across the border, then sell them in Canada. Canadians would have to buy American dollars to buy the cars and Americans would have to sell the Canadian dollars they received in exchange. Both actions would increase demand for US dollars and supply of Canadian dollars. As a result, there would be an appreciation of the US currency. This would make US cars more expensive and Canadian cars less so until their prices were similar. On a larger scale, international arbitrage opportunities in <a href="commodity">commodities</a>, goods, <a href="Security%20%28finance%29">securities</a> and <a href="currency">currencies</a> tend to change <a href="exchange%20rate">exchange rate</a>s until the <a href="purchasing%20power">purchasing power</a> is equal.

In reality, most <a href="asset">asset</a>s exhibit some difference between countries. These, <a href="transaction%20cost">transaction cost</a>s, taxes, and other costs provide an impediment to this kind of arbitrage. Similarly, arbitrage affects the difference in interest rates paid on government bonds issued by the various countries, given the expected depreciation in the currencies relative to each other (see <a href="interest%20rate%20parity">interest rate parity</a>).

Arbitrage transactions in modern securities markets involve fairly low day-to-day risks, but can face extremely high risk in rare situations, particularly <a href="Financial%20crisis">financial crises</a>, and can lead to <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a>. Formally, arbitrage transactions have <a href="negative%20skew">negative skew</a> – prices can get a small amount closer (but often no closer than 0), while they can get very far apart. The day-to-day risks are generally small because the transactions involve small differences in price, so an execution failure will generally cause a small loss (unless the trade is very big or the price moves rapidly). The rare case risks are extremely high because these small price differences are converted to large profits via <a href="Leverage%20%28finance%29">leverage</a> (borrowed money), and in the rare event of a large price move, this may yield a large loss.

The main day-to-day risk is that part of the transaction fails – execution risk. The main rare risks are counterparty risk and liquidity risk – that a counterparty to a large transaction or many transactions fails to pay, or that one is required to post <a href="margin%20%28finance%29">margin</a> and does not have the money to do so.

In the academic literature, the idea that seemingly very low risk arbitrage trades might not be fully exploited because of these risk factors and other considerations is often referred to as <a href="limits%20to%20arbitrage">limits to arbitrage</a>.

Generally it is impossible to close two or three transactions at the same instant; therefore, there is the possibility that when one part of the deal is closed, a quick shift in prices makes it impossible to close the other at a profitable price. However, this is not necessarily the case. Many exchanges and inter-dealer brokers allow multi legged trades (e.g. basis block trades on LIFFE).

Competition in the marketplace can also create risks during arbitrage transactions. As an example, if one was trying to profit from a price discrepancy between IBM on the NYSE and IBM on the London Stock Exchange, they may purchase a large number of shares on the NYSE and find that they cannot simultaneously sell on the LSE. This leaves the arbitrageur in an unhedged risk position.

In the 1980s, <a href="risk%20arbitrage">risk arbitrage</a> was common. In this form of <a href="speculation">speculation</a>, one trades a security that is clearly undervalued or overvalued, when it is seen that the wrong valuation is about to be corrected by events. The standard example is the stock of a company, undervalued in the stock market, which is about to be the object of a takeover bid; the price of the takeover will more truly reflect the value of the company, giving a large profit to those who bought at the current price—if the merger goes through as predicted. Traditionally, arbitrage transactions in the securities markets involve high speed, high volume and low risk. At some moment a price difference exists, and the problem is to execute two or three balancing transactions while the difference persists (that is, before the other arbitrageurs act). When the transaction involves a delay of weeks or months, as above, it may entail considerable risk if borrowed money is used to magnify the reward through leverage. One way of reducing the risk is through the <a href="Insider%20trading">illegal use of inside information</a>, and in fact risk arbitrage with regard to <a href="leveraged%20buyout">leveraged buyout</a>s was associated with some of the famous financial scandals of the 1980s such as those involving <a href="Michael%20Milken">Michael Milken</a> and <a href="Ivan%20Boesky">Ivan Boesky</a>.

Another risk occurs if the items being bought and sold are not identical and the arbitrage is conducted under the assumption that the prices of the items are correlated or predictable; this is more narrowly referred to as a <a href="convergence%20trade">convergence trade</a>. In the extreme case this is merger arbitrage, described below. In comparison to the classical quick arbitrage transaction, such an operation can produce disastrous losses.

As arbitrages generally involve "future" movements of cash, they are subject to <a href="counterparty%20risk">counterparty risk</a>: if a counterparty fails to fulfill their side of a transaction. This is a serious problem if one has either a single trade or many related trades with a single counterparty, whose failure thus poses a threat, or in the event of a financial crisis when many counterparties fail. This hazard is serious because of the large quantities one must trade in order to make a profit on small price differences.

For example, if one purchases many risky bonds, then hedges them with <a href="Credit%20default%20swap">CDSes</a>, profiting from the difference between the bond spread and the CDS premium, in a financial crisis the bonds may default "and" the CDS writer/seller may itself fail, due to the stress of the crisis, causing the arbitrageur to face steep losses.

Arbitrage trades are necessarily synthetic, "leveraged" trades, as they involve a short position. If the assets used are not identical (so a price divergence makes the trade temporarily lose money), or the margin treatment is not identical, and the trader is accordingly required to post <a href="margin%20%28finance%29">margin</a> (faces a <a href="margin%20call">margin call</a>), the trader may run out of capital (if they run out of cash and cannot borrow more) and be forced to sell these assets at a loss even though the trades may be expected to ultimately make money. In effect, arbitrage traders synthesize a <a href="put%20option">put option</a> on their ability to finance themselves.

Prices may diverge during a financial crisis, often termed a "<a href="flight%20to%20quality">flight to quality</a>"; these are precisely the times when it is hardest for leveraged investors to raise capital (due to overall capital constraints), and thus they will lack capital precisely when they need it most.

Also known as geographical arbitrage, this is the simplest form of arbitrage. In spatial arbitrage, an arbitrageur looks for price differences between geographically separate markets. For example, there may be a bond dealer in Virginia offering a bond at 100-12/23 and a dealer in Washington bidding 100-15/23 for the same bond. For whatever reason, the two dealers have not spotted the difference in the prices, but the arbitrageur does. The arbitrageur immediately buys the bond from the Virginia dealer and sells it to the Washington dealer.

Also called <a href="risk%20arbitrage">risk arbitrage</a>, merger arbitrage generally consists of buying/holding the stock of a company that is the target of a <a href="takeover">takeover</a> while <a href="Short%20%28finance%29">shorting</a> the stock of the acquiring company.

Usually the market price of the target company is less than the price offered by the acquiring company.
The spread between these two prices depends mainly on the probability and the timing of the takeover being completed as well as the prevailing level of interest rates.

The bet in a merger arbitrage is that such a spread will eventually be zero, if and when the takeover is completed. The risk is that the deal "breaks" and the spread massively widens.

Also called "municipal bond relative value arbitrage", "municipal arbitrage", or just "muni arb", this hedge fund strategy involves one of two approaches. It should be noted that the term "arbitrage" is also used in the context of the Income Tax Regulations governing the investment of proceeds of municipal bonds; these regulations, aimed at the issuers or beneficiaries of tax-exempt municipal bonds, are different and, instead, attempt to remove the issuer's ability to arbitrage between the low tax-exempt rate and a taxable investment rate.

Generally, managers seek relative value opportunities by being both long and short municipal bonds with a duration-neutral book. The relative value trades may be between different issuers, different bonds issued by the same entity, or capital structure trades referencing the same asset (in the case of revenue bonds). Managers aim to capture the inefficiencies arising from the heavy participation of non-economic investors (i.e., high income "<a href="buy%20and%20hold">buy and hold</a>" investors seeking tax-exempt income) as well as the "crossover buying" arising from corporations' or individuals' changing income tax situations (i.e., insurers switching their munis for corporates after a large loss as they can capture a higher after-tax yield by offsetting the taxable corporate income with underwriting losses). There are additional inefficiencies arising from the highly fragmented nature of the municipal bond market which has two million outstanding issues and 50,000 issuers in contrast to the Treasury market which has 400 issues and a single issuer.

Second, managers construct leveraged portfolios of AAA- or AA-rated tax-exempt municipal bonds with the duration risk hedged by <a href="Short%20selling">shorting</a> the appropriate ratio of taxable corporate bonds. These corporate equivalents are typically <a href="interest%20rate%20swap">interest rate swap</a>s referencing <a href="Libor%23Libor-based%20derivatives">Libor</a> or <a href="Securities%20Industry%20and%20Financial%20Markets%20Association">SIFMA</a><a href="http%3A//www.investinginbonds.com/story.asp%3Fid%3D351"></a> <a href="http%3A//www.bondmarkets.com/story.asp%3Fid%3D1157"></a>. The arbitrage manifests itself in the form of a relatively cheap longer maturity municipal bond, which is a municipal bond that yields significantly more than 65% of a corresponding taxable corporate bond. The steeper slope of the municipal <a href="yield%20curve">yield curve</a> allows participants to collect more after-tax income from the municipal bond portfolio than is spent on the interest rate swap; the carry is greater than the hedge expense. Positive, tax-free carry from muni arb can reach into the double digits. The bet in this municipal bond arbitrage is that, over a longer period of time, two similar instruments—municipal bonds and interest rate swaps—will correlate with each other; they are both very high quality credits, have the same maturity and are denominated in the same currency. Credit risk and duration risk are largely eliminated in this strategy. However, basis risk arises from use of an imperfect hedge, which results in significant, but range-bound principal volatility. The end goal is to limit this principal volatility, eliminating its relevance over time as the high, consistent, tax-free cash flow accumulates. Since the inefficiency is related to government tax policy, and hence is structural in nature, it has not been arbitraged away.

Note, however, that many municipal bonds are callable, and that this imposes substantial additional risks to the strategy.

A <a href="convertible%20bond">convertible bond</a> is a <a href="bond%20%28finance%29">bond</a> that an investor can return to the issuing company in exchange for a predetermined number of shares in the company.

A convertible bond can be thought of as a <a href="corporate%20bond">corporate bond</a> with a stock <a href="call%20option">call option</a> attached to it.

The price of a convertible bond is sensitive to three major factors:


Given the complexity of the calculations involved and the convoluted structure that a convertible bond can have, an arbitrageur often relies on sophisticated quantitative models in order to identify bonds that are trading cheap versus their theoretical value.

<a href="Convertible%20arbitrage">Convertible arbitrage</a> consists of buying a convertible bond and hedging two of the three factors in order to gain exposure to the third factor at a very attractive price.

For instance an arbitrageur would first buy a convertible bond, then sell <a href="fixed%20income">fixed income</a> <a href="Security%20%28finance%29">securities</a> or <a href="interest%20rate%20future">interest rate future</a>s (to hedge the interest rate exposure) and buy some <a href="credit%20default%20swap">credit protection</a> (to hedge the risk of credit deterioration).
Eventually what he'd be left with is something similar to a call option on the underlying stock, acquired at a very low price.
He could then make money either selling some of the more expensive options that are openly traded in the market or <a href="delta%20hedging">delta hedging</a> his exposure to the underlying shares.

A <a href="depositary%20receipt">depositary receipt</a> is a security that is offered as a "tracking stock" on another foreign market. For instance a <a href="China">Chinese</a> company wishing to raise more money may issue a depository receipt on the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a>, as the amount of capital on the local exchanges is limited. These securities, known as ADRs (<a href="American%20depositary%20receipt">American depositary receipt</a>) or GDRs (<a href="global%20depository%20receipt">global depository receipt</a>) depending on where they are issued, are typically considered "foreign" and therefore trade at a lower value when first released. Many ADR's are exchangeable into the original security (known as <a href="fungibility">fungibility</a>) and actually have the same value. In this case there is a spread between the perceived value and real value, which can be extracted. Other ADR's that are not exchangeable often have much larger spreads. Since the ADR is trading at a value lower than what it is worth, one can purchase the ADR and expect to make money as its value converges on the original. However, there is a chance that the original stock will fall in value too, so by shorting it one can hedge that risk.

Cross-border arbitrage exploits different prices of the same stock in different countries:

Example: <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> is trading on <a href="NASDAQ">NASDAQ</a> at US$108.84. The stock is also traded on the German electronic exchange, <a href="Xetra%20%28trading%20system%29">XETRA</a>. If 1 euro costs US$1.11, a cross-border trader could enter a buy order on the XETRA at €98.03 per Apple share and a sell order at €98.07 per share.

Some brokers in Germany do not offer access to the U.S. exchanges. Hence if a German retail investor wants to buy Apple stock, he needs to buy it on the XETRA. The cross-border trader would sell the Apple shares on XETRA to the investor and buy the shares in the same second on NASDAQ. Afterwards, the cross-border trader would need to transfer the shares bought on NASDAQ to the German XETRA exchange, where he is obliged to deliver the stock.

In most cases, the quotation on the local exchanges is done electronically by <a href="High-frequency%20trading">high-frequency traders</a>, taking into consideration the home price of the stock and the <a href="exchange%20rate">exchange rate</a>. This kind of high-frequency trading benefits the public as it reduces the cost to the German investor and enables him to buy U.S. shares.

A <a href="dual-listed%20company">dual-listed company</a> (DLC) structure involves two companies incorporated in different countries contractually agreeing to operate their businesses as if they were a single enterprise, while retaining their separate legal identity and existing stock exchange listings. In integrated and efficient financial markets, stock prices of the twin pair should move in lockstep. In practice, DLC share prices exhibit large deviations from theoretical parity. Arbitrage positions in DLCs can be set up by obtaining a long position in the relatively underpriced part of the DLC and a short position in the relatively overpriced part. Such arbitrage strategies start paying off as soon as the relative prices of the two DLC stocks converge toward theoretical parity. However, since there is no identifiable date at which DLC prices will converge, arbitrage positions sometimes have to be kept open for considerable periods of time. In the meantime, the price gap might widen. In these situations, arbitrageurs may receive <a href="margin%20call">margin call</a>s, after which they would most likely be forced to liquidate part of the position at a highly unfavorable moment and suffer a loss. Arbitrage in DLCs may be profitable, but is also very risky.

A good illustration of the risk of DLC arbitrage is the position in <a href="Royal%20Dutch%20Shell">Royal Dutch Shell</a>—which had a DLC structure until 2005—by the hedge fund <a href="Long-Term%20Capital%20Management">Long-Term Capital Management</a> (LTCM, see also the discussion below). Lowenstein (2000) describes that LTCM established an arbitrage position in Royal Dutch Shell in the summer of 1997, when Royal Dutch traded at an 8 to 10 percent premium. In total $2.3 billion was invested, half of which long in Shell and the other half short in Royal Dutch (Lowenstein, p. 99). In the autumn of 1998 large defaults on Russian debt created significant losses for the hedge fund and LTCM had to unwind several positions. Lowenstein reports that the premium of Royal Dutch had increased to about 22 percent and LTCM had to close the position and incur a loss. According to Lowenstein (p. 234), LTCM lost $286 million in equity <a href="pairs%20trading">pairs trading</a> and more than half of this loss is accounted for by the <a href="Royal%20Dutch%20Shell">Royal Dutch Shell</a> trade.

The market prices for privately held companies are typically viewed from a return on investment perspective (such as 25%), whilst publicly held and or exchange listed companies trade on a <a href="Price%20to%20earnings%20ratio">Price to earnings ratio</a> (P/E) (such as a P/E of 10, which equates to a 10% <a href="Return%20on%20investment">ROI</a>). Thus, if a publicly traded company specialises in the acquisition of privately held companies, from a per-share perspective there is a gain with every acquisition that falls within these guidelines. E.g., <a href="Berkshire%20Hathaway">Berkshire Hathaway</a> and <a href="Halydean%20Corporation">Halydean Corporation</a>. Private to public equities arbitrage is a term which can arguably be applied to <a href="investment%20banking">investment banking</a> in general. Private markets to public markets differences may also help explain the overnight windfall gains enjoyed by principals of companies that just did an <a href="initial%20public%20offering">initial public offering</a> (IPO).

Regulatory arbitrage is where a regulated institution takes advantage of the difference between its real (or economic) <a href="risk">risk</a> and the regulatory position. For example, if a bank, operating under the <a href="Basel%20I">Basel I</a> accord, has to hold 8% capital against <a href="default%20risk">default risk</a>, but the real risk of default is lower, it is profitable to <a href="Securitization">securitise</a> the loan, removing the low risk loan from its portfolio. On the other hand, if the real risk is higher than the regulatory risk then it is profitable to make that loan and hold on to it, provided it is priced appropriately. Regulatory arbitrage can result in parts of entire businesses being unregulated as a result of the arbitrage.

This process can increase the overall riskiness of institutions under a risk insensitive regulatory regime, as described by <a href="Alan%20Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a> in his October 1998 speech on <a href="http%3A//www.ny.frb.org/research/epr/98v04n3/9810gree.pdf">The Role of Capital in Optimal Banking Supervision and Regulation</a>.

The term "Regulatory Arbitrage" was used for the first time in 2005 when it was applied by Scott V. Simpson, a partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, to refer to a new defence tactic in hostile mergers and acquisitions where differing takeover regimes in deals involving multi-jurisdictions are exploited to the advantage of a target company under threat.

In economics, regulatory arbitrage (sometimes, tax arbitrage) may be used to refer to situations when a company can choose a nominal place of business with a regulatory, legal or tax regime with lower costs. For example, an <a href="insurance">insurance</a> company may choose to locate in <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> due to preferential tax rates and policies for insurance companies. This can occur particularly where the business transaction has no obvious physical location: in the case of many financial products, it may be unclear "where" the transaction occurs.

Regulatory arbitrage can include restructuring a bank by outsourcing services such as IT. The outsourcing company takes over the installations, buying out the bank's assets and charges a periodic service fee back to the bank. This frees up cashflow usable for new lending by the bank. The bank will have higher IT costs, but counts on the multiplier effect of <a href="money%20creation">money creation</a> and the interest rate spread to make it a profitable exercise.

Example:
Suppose the bank sells its IT installations for 40 million USD. With a reserve ratio of 10%, the bank can create 400 million USD in additional loans (there is a time lag, and the bank has to expect to recover the loaned money back into its books). The bank can often lend (and securitize the loan) to the IT services company to cover the acquisition cost of the IT installations. This can be at preferential rates, as the sole client using the IT installation is the bank. If the bank can generate 5% interest margin on the 400 million of new loans, the bank will increase interest revenues by 20 million. The IT services company is free to leverage their balance sheet as aggressively as they and their banker agree to. This is the reason behind the trend towards outsourcing in the financial sector. Without this money creation benefit, it is actually more expensive to outsource the IT operations as the outsourcing adds a layer of management and increases overhead.

According to PBS Frontline's 2012 four-part documentary, "Money, Power, and Wall Street," regulatory arbitrage, along with asymmetric bank lobbying in Washington and abroad, allowed investment banks in the pre- and post-2008 period to continue to skirt laws and engage in the risky proprietary trading of opaque derivatives, swaps, and other credit-based instruments invented to circumvent legal restrictions at the expense of clients, government, and publics.

Due to the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid coverage, one form of Regulatory Arbitrage can now be found when businesses engage in “Medicaid Migration”, a maneuver by which qualifying employees who would typically be enrolled in company health plans elect to enroll in Medicaid instead. These programs that have similar characteristics as insurance products to the employee, but have radically different cost structures, resulting in significant expense reductions for employers.

Telecom arbitrage companies allow phone users to make international calls for free through certain access numbers. Such services are offered in the United Kingdom; the telecommunication arbitrage companies get paid an interconnect charge by the UK mobile networks and then buy international routes at a lower cost. The calls are seen as free by the UK contract mobile phone customers since they are using up their allocated monthly minutes rather than paying for additional calls.

Such services were previously offered in the United States by companies such as FuturePhone.com. These services would operate in rural telephone exchanges, primarily in small towns in the state of Iowa. In these areas, the local telephone carriers are allowed to charge a high "termination fee" to the caller's carrier in order to fund the cost of providing service to the small and sparsely populated areas that they serve. However, FuturePhone (as well as other similar services) ceased operations upon legal challenges from AT&T and other service providers.

<a href="Statistical%20arbitrage">Statistical arbitrage</a> is an imbalance in expected nominal values. A <a href="casino">casino</a> has a statistical arbitrage in every game of chance that it offers—referred to as the <a href="house%20advantage">house advantage</a>, house edge, <a href="vigorish">vigorish</a> or house vigorish.

<a href="Long-Term%20Capital%20Management">Long-Term Capital Management</a> (LTCM) lost 4.6 billion U.S. dollars in <a href="fixed%20income%20arbitrage">fixed income arbitrage</a> in September 1998. LTCM had attempted to make money on the price difference between different <a href="Bond%20%28finance%29">bonds</a>. For example, it would sell <a href="United%20States%20Treasury%20security">U.S. Treasury securities</a> and buy Italian bond futures. The concept was that because Italian bond futures had a less liquid market, in the short term Italian bond futures would have a higher return than U.S. bonds, but in the long term, the prices would converge. Because the difference was small, a large amount of money had to be borrowed to make the buying and selling profitable.

The downfall in this system began on August 17, 1998, when <a href="Russia">Russia</a> defaulted on its <a href="Russian%20ruble">ruble</a> debt and domestic dollar debt. Because the markets were already nervous due to the <a href="1997%20Asian%20financial%20crisis">1997 Asian financial crisis</a>, investors began selling non-U.S. treasury debt and buying U.S. treasuries, which were considered a safe investment. As a result, the price on US treasuries began to increase and the return began decreasing because there were many buyers, and the return (yield) on other bonds began to increase because there were many sellers (i.e. the price of those bonds fell). This caused the difference between the prices of U.S. treasuries and other bonds to increase, rather than to decrease as LTCM was expecting. Eventually this caused LTCM to fold, and their creditors had to arrange a bail-out. More controversially, officials of the <a href="Federal%20Reserve">Federal Reserve</a> assisted in the negotiations that led to this bail-out, on the grounds that so many companies and deals were intertwined with LTCM that if LTCM actually failed, they would as well, causing a collapse in confidence in the economic system. Thus LTCM failed as a fixed income arbitrage fund, although it is unclear what sort of profit was realized by the banks that bailed LTCM out.

ACF Fiorentina

ACF Fiorentina <a href="Societ%C3%A0%20per%20azioni">S.p.A.</a>, commonly referred to as simply Fiorentina , is a professional <a href="Football%20in%20Italy">Italian football</a> club from <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a>. Founded by a merger in 1926, and refounded in 2002 following bankruptcy, Fiorentina have played at the top level of Italian football for the majority of their existence; only four clubs have played in more <a href="Serie%20A">Serie A</a> seasons.

Fiorentina has won two <a href="List%20of%20Italian%20football%20champions">Italian Championships</a>, in <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20Serie%20A">1955–56</a> and again in <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20Serie%20A">1968–69</a>, as well as six <a href="Coppa%20Italia">Coppa Italia</a> trophies and one <a href="Supercoppa%20Italiana">Supercoppa Italiana</a>. On the <a href="UEFA">European stage</a>, Fiorentina won the <a href="UEFA%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a> in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1960–61</a> and lost the final one year later. They finished runners-up in the <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20European%20Cup">1956–57 European Cup</a>, losing against <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>, and also came close to winning the <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20UEFA%20Cup">1989–90 UEFA Cup</a>, finishing as runners-up against <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a> after losing the first leg in <a href="Turin">Turin</a> and drawing in the second one in <a href="Avellino">Avellino</a>.

Fiorentina is one of the thirteen European teams that played the finals in all three major continental competitions: the Champions League (1956-1957, the first Italian team to reach the final in the top continental competition), the UEFA Cup Winners (1960-1961 and 1961-1962) and the UEFA Cup (1989-1990).

Since 1931, the club have played at the <a href="Stadio%20Artemio%20Franchi">Stadio Artemio Franchi</a>, which currently has a capacity of 47,282. The stadium has used several names over the years and has undergone several renovations. Fiorentina are known widely by the nickname "Viola", a reference to their distinctive purple colours.

Associazione Calcio Fiorentina was founded in the autumn of 1926 by local noble and <a href="National%20Fascist%20Party">National Fascist Party</a> member Luigi Ridolfi, who initiated the merger of two older Florentine clubs, <a href="C.S.%20Firenze">CS Firenze</a> and <a href="P.G.%20Libertas">PG Libertas</a>. The aim of the merger was to give Florence a strong club to rival those of the more dominant <a href="Italian%20Football%20Championship">Italian Football Championship</a> sides of the time from <a href="Northern%20Italy">Northwest Italy</a>. Also influential was the cultural revival and rediscovery of "<a href="Calcio%20Fiorentino">Calcio Fiorentino</a>", an ancestor of modern football that was played by members of the <a href="Medici">Medici</a> family.

After a rough start and three seasons in lower leagues, Fiorentina reached the Serie A in 1931. That same year saw the opening of the new stadium, originally named after Giovanni Berta, after a prominent fascist, but now known as <a href="Stadio%20Artemio%20Franchi">Stadio Artemio Franchi</a>. At the time, the stadium was a masterpiece of engineering, and its inauguration was monumental. To be able to compete with the best teams in Italy, Fiorentina strengthened their team with some new players, notably the Uruguayan <a href="Pedro%20Petrone">Pedro Petrone</a>, nicknamed "el Artillero". Despite enjoying a good season and finishing in fourth place, Fiorentina were relegated the following year, although they would return quickly to Serie A. In 1941, they won their first <a href="Coppa%20Italia">Coppa Italia</a>, but the team were unable to build on their success during the 1940s because of World War II and other troubles.

In 1950, Fiorentina started to achieve consistent top-five finishes in the domestic league. The team consisted of great players such as well-known goalkeeper <a href="Giuliano%20Sarti">Giuliano Sarti</a>, <a href="Sergio%20Cervato">Sergio Cervato</a>, Francesco Rosella, <a href="Guido%20Gratton">Guido Gratton</a>, <a href="Giuseppe%20Chiappella">Giuseppe Chiappella</a> and Aldo Scaramucci but above all, the attacking duo of Brazilian <a href="J%C3%BAlio%20Botelho">Julinho</a> and Argentinian <a href="Miguel%20Montuori">Miguel Montuori</a>. This team won Fiorentina's first "<a href="scudetto">scudetto</a>" (Italian championship) in <a href="1955%E2%80%9356%20Serie%20A">1955–56</a>, 12 points ahead of second-place <a href="A.C.%20Milan">Milan</a>. Milan beat Fiorentina to top spot the following year, but more significantly Fiorentina became the first Italian team to play in a <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a> final, when a disputed penalty led to a 2–0 defeat at the hands of <a href="Alfredo%20Di%20St%C3%A9fano">Alfredo Di Stéfano</a>'s <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>.
Fiorentina were runners-up again in the three subsequent seasons. In the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20Serie%20A">1960–61 season</a>, the club won the Coppa Italia again and was also successful in Europe, winning the first <a href="Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">Cup Winners' Cup</a> against Scottish side <a href="Rangers%20F.C.">Rangers</a>.

After several years of runner-up finishes, Fiorentina dropped away slightly in the 1960s, bouncing from fourth to sixth place, although the club won the Coppa Italia and the <a href="Mitropa%20Cup">Mitropa Cup</a> in 1966.

While the 1960s did result in some trophies and good <a href="Serie%20A">Serie A</a> finishes for Fiorentina, nobody believed that the club could challenge for the title. The <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20Serie%20A">1968–69 season</a> started with Milan as frontrunners, but on matchday 7, they lost to <a href="Bologna%20F.C.%201909">Bologna</a> and were overtaken by <a href="Gigi%20Riva">Gigi Riva</a>'s <a href="Cagliari%20Calcio">Cagliari</a>. Fiorentina, after an unimpressive start, then moved to the top of the Serie A, but the first half of their season finished with a 2–2 draw against <a href="A.S.%20Varese%201910">Varese</a>, leaving Cagliari as outright league leader. The second half of the season was a three-way battle between the three contending teams, Milan, Cagliari and Fiorentina. Milan fell away, instead focusing their efforts on the European Cup, and it seemed that Cagliari would retain top spot. After Cagliari lost against <a href="Juventus%20F.C.">Juventus</a>, however, Fiorentina took over at the top. The team then won all of their remaining matches, beating rivals Juve in <a href="Turin">Turin</a> on the penultimate matchday to seal their second, and last, national title. In the European Cup competition the following year, Fiorentina had some good results, including a win in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> against <a href="FC%20Dynamo%20Kyiv">Dynamo Kyiv</a>, but they were eventually knocked out in the quarter-finals after a 3–0 defeat in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> to <a href="Celtic%20F.C.">Celtic</a>.

"Viola" players began the 1970s decade with "Scudetto" sewed on their breast, but the period was not especially fruitful for the team. After a fifth-place finish in 1971, they finished in mid-table almost every year, even flirting with relegation in 1972 and 1978. The "Viola" did win the <a href="Anglo-Italian%20League%20Cup">Anglo-Italian League Cup</a> in 1974 and won the Coppa Italia again in 1975. The team consisted of young talents like Vincenzo Guerini and Moreno Roggi, who had the misfortune to suffer bad injuries, and above all <a href="Giancarlo%20Antognoni">Giancarlo Antognoni</a>, who would later become an idol to Fiorentina's fans. The young average age of the players led to the team being called "Fiorentina Ye-Ye".

In 1980, Fiorentina was bought by Flavio Pontello, who came from a rich house-building family. He quickly changed the team's anthem and logo, leading to some complaints by the fans, but he started to bring in high-quality players such as <a href="Francesco%20Graziani">Francesco Graziani</a> and <a href="Eraldo%20Pecci">Eraldo Pecci</a> from <a href="Torino%20F.C.">Torino</a>; <a href="Daniel%20Bertoni">Daniel Bertoni</a> from <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>; <a href="Daniele%20Massaro">Daniele Massaro</a> from <a href="A.C.%20Monza%20Brianza%201912">Monza</a>; and a young <a href="Pietro%20Vierchowod">Pietro Vierchowod</a> from <a href="U.C.%20Sampdoria">Sampdoria</a>. The team was built around Giancarlo Antognoni, and in <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20Serie%20A">1982</a>, Fiorentina were involved in an exciting duel with rivals Juventus. After a bad injury to Antognoni, the league title was decided on the final day of the season when Fiorentina were denied a goal against Cagliari and were unable to win. Juventus won the title with a disputed penalty and the rivalry between the two teams erupted.

The following years were strange for Fiorentina, who vacillated between high finishes and relegation battles. Fiorentina also bought two interesting players, "El Puntero" <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20D%C3%ADaz">Ramón Díaz</a> and, most significantly, the young <a href="Roberto%20Baggio">Roberto Baggio</a>.

In 1990, Fiorentina fought to avoid relegation right up until the final day of the season, but did reach the <a href="UEFA%20Europa%20League">UEFA Cup</a> final, where they again faced Juventus. The Turin team won the trophy, but Fiorentina's "<a href="tifosi">tifosi</a>" once again had real cause for complaint: the second leg of the final was played in <a href="Avellino">Avellino</a> (Fiorentina's home ground was suspended), a city with many Juventus fans, and emerging star Roberto Baggio was sold to the rival team on the day of the final. Pontello, suffering from economic difficulties, was selling all the players and was forced to leave the club after serious riots in Florence's streets. The club was then acquired by the famous filmmaker <a href="Mario%20Cecchi%20Gori">Mario Cecchi Gori</a>.

The first season under Cecchi Gori's ownership was one of stabilisation, after which the new chairman started to sign some good players like <a href="Brian%20Laudrup">Brian Laudrup</a>, <a href="Stefan%20Effenberg">Stefan Effenberg</a>, <a href="Francesco%20Baiano">Francesco Baiano</a> and, most importantly, <a href="Gabriel%20Batistuta">Gabriel Batistuta</a>, who became an iconic player for the team during the 1990s. In 1993, however, Cecchi Gori died and was succeeded as chairman by his son, <a href="Vittorio%20Cecchi%20Gori">Vittorio</a>. Despite a good start to the season, Cecchi Gori fired the coach, <a href="Luigi%20Radice">Luigi Radice</a>, after a defeat against <a href="Atalanta%20B.C.">Atalanta</a>, and replaced him with <a href="Aldo%20Agroppi">Aldo Agroppi</a>. The results were dreadful: Fiorentina fell into the bottom half of the standings and were relegated on the last day of the season.

<a href="Claudio%20Ranieri">Claudio Ranieri</a> was brought in as coach for the 1993–94 season, and that year, Fiorentina dominated <a href="Serie%20B">Serie B</a>, Italy's second division. Upon their return to Serie A, Ranieri put together a good team centred around new top scorer Batistuta, signing the young talent <a href="Rui%20Costa">Rui Costa</a> from <a href="S.L.%20Benfica">Benfica</a> and the new world champion Brazilian defender <a href="M%C3%A1rcio%20Roberto%20dos%20Santos">Márcio Santos</a>. The former became an idol to Fiorentina fans, while the second disappointed and was sold after only a season. The "Viola" finished the season in tenth place.

The following season, Cecchi Gori bought other important players, namely Swedish midfielder <a href="Stefan%20Schwarz">Stefan Schwarz</a>. The club again proved its mettle in cup competitions, winning the Coppa Italia against Atalanta and finishing joint-third in Serie A. In the summer, Fiorentina became the first non-national champions to win the <a href="Supercoppa%20Italiana">Supercoppa Italiana</a>, defeating Milan 2–1 at the <a href="San%20Siro">San Siro</a>.

Fiorentina's 1995–96 season was disappointing in the league, but they did reach the <a href="Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">Cup Winners' Cup</a> semi-final by beating <a href="AF%20Gloria%20Bistri%C8%9Ba">Gloria Bistrița</a>, <a href="AC%20Sparta%20Prague">Sparta Prague</a> and Benfica. The team lost the semi-final to the eventual winner of the competition, <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> (away 1–1; home 0–2). The season's main signings were <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20Oliveira">Luís Oliveira</a> and <a href="Andrei%20Kanchelskis">Andrei Kanchelskis</a>, the latter of whom suffered from many injuries.

At the end of the season, Ranieri left Fiorentina for <a href="Valencia%20CF">Valencia</a> in Spain, with Cecchi Gori appointing <a href="Alberto%20Malesani">Alberto Malesani</a> as his replacement. Fiorentina played well but struggled against smaller teams, although they did manage to qualify for the UEFA Cup. Malesani left Fiorentina after only a season and was succeeded by <a href="Giovanni%20Trapattoni">Giovanni Trapattoni</a>. With Trapattoni's expert guidance and Batistuta's goals, Fiorentina challenged for the title in <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20Serie%20A">1998–99</a> but finished the season in third, earning them qualification for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">Champions League</a>. The following year was disappointing in Serie A, but "Viola" played some historical matches in the Champions League, beating <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> 1–0 at the old <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> and <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> 2–0 in Florence. They were ultimately eliminated in the second group stage.

At the end of the season, Trapattoni left the club and was replaced by Turkish coach <a href="Fatih%20Terim">Fatih Terim</a>. More significantly, however, Batistuta was sold to <a href="A.S.%20Roma">Roma</a>, who eventually won the title the following year. Fiorentina played well in <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Serie%20A">2000–01</a> and stayed in the top half of Serie A, despite the resignation of Terim and the arrival of <a href="Roberto%20Mancini">Roberto Mancini</a>. They also won the Coppa Italia for the sixth and last time.

The year 2001 heralded major changes for Fiorentina, as the terrible state of the club's finances was revealed: they were unable to pay wages and had debts of around US$50 million. but even this soon proved to be insufficient resources to sustain the club. Fiorentina were relegated at the end of the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Serie%20A">2001–02 season</a> and went into judicially-controlled administration in June 2002. This form of <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> (sports companies cannot exactly fail in this way in Italy, but they can suffer a similar procedure) meant that the club was refused a place in Serie B for the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Serie%20A">2002–03 season</a>, and as a result effectively ceased to exist.

The club was promptly re-established in August 2002 as Associazione Calcio Fiorentina e Florentia Viola with shoe and leather entrepreneur Diego Della Valle as new owner and the club was admitted into <a href="Serie%20C2">Serie C2</a>, the fourth tier of Italian football. The only player to remain at the club in its new incarnation was <a href="Angelo%20Di%20Livio">Angelo Di Livio</a>, whose commitment to the club's cause further endeared him to the fans. Helped by Di Livio and 30-goal striker <a href="Christian%20Rigan%C3%B2">Christian Riganò</a>, the club won its Serie C2 group with considerable ease, which would normally have led to a promotion to <a href="Serie%20C1">Serie C1</a>. Due to the bizarre "<a href="Calcio%20Catania%23Decline%20and%20revival">Caso Catania</a>" (Catania Case), however, the club skipped Serie C1 and was admitted into Serie B, something that was only made possible by the <a href="Italian%20Football%20Federation">Italian Football Federation</a> (FIGC)'s decision to resolve the <a href="Calcio%20Catania">Catania</a> situation by increasing the number of teams in Serie B from 20 to 24 and promoting Fiorentina for "sports merits." In the 2003 off-season, the club also bought back the right to use the Fiorentina name and the famous shirt design, and re-incorporated itself as ACF Fiorentina. The club finished the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Serie%20B">2003–04 season</a> in sixth place and won the <a href="Playoffs%23Association%20football">playoff</a> against <a href="Perugia%20Calcio">Perugia</a> to return to top-flight football.
In their first season back in Serie A, however, the club struggled to avoid relegation, only securing survival on the last day of the season on head-to-head record against <a href="Bologna%20F.C.%201909">Bologna</a> and <a href="Parma%20F.C.">Parma</a>. In 2005, Della Valle decided to appoint <a href="Pantaleo%20Corvino">Pantaleo Corvino</a> as new sports director, followed by the appointment of <a href="Cesare%20Prandelli">Cesare Prandelli</a> as head coach in <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Serie%20A">the following season</a>. The club made several signings during the summer transfer market, most notably <a href="Luca%20Toni">Luca Toni</a> and <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Frey">Sébastien Frey</a>. This drastic move earned them a fourth-place finish with 74 points and a Champions League qualifying round ticket. Toni scored 31 goals in 38 appearances, the first player to pass the 30-goal mark since <a href="Antonio%20Valentin%20Angelillo">Antonio Valentin Angelillo</a> in the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20Serie%20A">1958–59 season</a>, for which he was awarded the <a href="European%20Golden%20Boot">European Golden Boot</a>. On 14 July 2006, however, Fiorentina were relegated to Serie B due to their involvement in the <a href="2006%20Serie%20A%20scandal">2006 Serie A match fixing scandal</a> and given a 12-point penalty. The team was reinstated to the Serie A on appeal, but with a 19-point penalty for the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Serie%20A">2006–07 season</a>. The team's <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2006–07 Champions League</a> place was also revoked. After the start of the season, Fiorentina's penalisation was reduced from 19 points to 15 on appeal to the Italian courts. In spite of this penalty, they managed to secure a place in the UEFA Cup.

Despite Toni's departure to <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, Fiorentina had a strong start to the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Serie%20A">2007–08 season</a> and were tipped by <a href="Italy%20national%20football%20team">Italian national team</a> head coach <a href="Marcello%20Lippi">Marcello Lippi</a>, among others, as a surprise challenger for the "<a href="Scudetto">Scudetto</a>", and although this form tailed off towards the middle of the season, the "Viola" managed to qualify for the Champions League. In Europe, the club reached the semi-final of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, where they were ultimately defeated by Rangers on penalties. The <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Serie%20A">2008–09 season</a> continued this success, a fourth-place finish assuring Fiorentina's spot in <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2010's Champions League playoffs</a>. Their European campaign was also similar to that of the previous run, relegated to the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Cup">2008–09 UEFA Cup</a> and were eliminated by <a href="AFC%20Ajax">Ajax</a> in the end.

In the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Serie%20A">2009–10 season</a>, Fiorentina started their domestic campaign strongly before steadily losing momentum and slipped to mid-table positions at the latter half of the season. In Europe, the team proved to be a surprise dark horse: after losing their first away fixture against <a href="Olympique%20Lyonnais">Lyon</a>, they staged a comeback with a five-match streak by winning all their remaining matches (including defeating <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> home and away). The "Viola" qualified as group champions, but eventually succumbed to Bayern Munich due to the <a href="away%20goals%20rule">away goals rule</a>. This was controversial due to a mistaken refereeing decision by <a href="Tom%20Henning%20%C3%98vreb%C3%B8">Tom Henning Øvrebø</a>, who allowed a clearly offside goal for Bayern in the first leg. Bayern eventually finished the tournament as runners-up, making a deep run all the way to the <a href="2010%20UEFA%20Champions%20League%20Final">final</a>. The incident called into attention the possible implementation of video replays in football. Despite a good European run and reaching the semi-finals in the Coppa Italia, Fiorentina failed to qualify for Europe.

During this period, on 24 September 2009, Andrea Della Valle resigned from his position as chairman of Fiorentina, and announced all duties would be temporarily transferred to Mario Cognini, Fiorentina's vice-president until a permanent position could be filled.

In June 2010, the "Viola" bid farewell to long-time manager Cesar Prandelli, by then the longest-serving coach in the team's history, who was departing to coach the Italian national team. Catania manager <a href="Sini%C5%A1a%20Mihajlovi%C4%87">Siniša Mihajlović</a> was appointed to replace him. The club spent much of the early <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Serie%20A">2010–11 season</a> in last place, but their form improved and Fiorentina ultimately finished ninth. Following a 1–0 defeat to <a href="A.C.%20Chievo%20Verona">Chievo</a> in November 2011, Mihajlović was sacked and replaced by <a href="Delio%20Rossi">Delio Rossi</a>. After a brief period of improvements, the "Viola" were again fighting relegation, prompting the sacking of Sporting Director <a href="Pantaleo%20Corvino">Pantaleo Corvino</a> in early 2012 following a 0–5 home defeat to Juventus. Their bid for survival was kept alive by a number of upset victories away from home, notably at Roma and Milan. During a home game against <a href="Novara%20Calcio">Novara</a>, trailing 0–2 within half an hour, manager Rossi decided to substitute midfielder <a href="Adem%20Ljaji%C4%87">Adem Ljajić</a> early. Ljajić sarcastically applauded him in frustration, whereupon Rossi retaliated by physical assaulting his player, an action that ultimately prompted his termination by the club. His replacement, caretaker manager <a href="Vincenzo%20Guerini">Vincenzo Guerini</a>, then guided the team away from the relegation zone to a 13th-place finish to end the turbulent year.

To engineer a resurrection of the club after the disappointing season, the Della Valle family invested heavily in the middle of 2012, buying 17 new players and appointing <a href="Vincenzo%20Montella">Vincenzo Montella</a> as head coach. The team began the season well, finishing the calendar year in joint third place and eventually finishing the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Serie%20A">2012–13 season</a> in fourth, enough for a position in the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2013–14 Europa League</a>.

The club lost fan favourite <a href="Stevan%20Joveti%C4%87">Stevan Jovetić</a> during the middle of 2013, selling him to English Premier League club <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> for a €30 million transfer fee. They also sold Adem Ljajić to Roma and <a href="Alessio%20Cerci">Alessio Cerci</a> to Torino, using the funds to bring in <a href="Mario%20G%C3%B3mez">Mario Gómez</a>, <a href="Josip%20Ili%C4%8Di%C4%87">Josip Iličić</a> and <a href="Ante%20Rebi%C4%87">Ante Rebić</a>, among others. During the season, Fiorentina topped their Europa League group, moving on to the round of 32 to face Danish side <a href="Esbjerg%20fB">Esbjerg fB</a>, which Fiorentina defeated 4–2 on aggregate. In the following round of 16, however, they then lost to Italian rivals Juventus 2–1 on aggregate, ousting Fiorentina from the competition. At the end of the season, the team finished fourth again in the league, and also finishing they year as Coppa Italia runners-up after losing 3–1 to Napoli in the final.

In 2014–15, during the 2015 winter transfer window, the team club sold star winger <a href="Juan%20Cuadrado">Juan Cuadrado</a> to <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> for €30 million but were able to secure the loan of <a href="Mohamed%20Salah">Mohamed Salah</a> in exchange, who was a revelation in the second half of the season. Their <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2014–15 Europa League campaign</a> saw them progress to the semi-finals, where they were knocked-out by Spanish side <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla</a>, the eventual champions. In the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Serie%20A">2014–15 domestic season</a>, Fiorentina once again finished fourth, thus qualifying for the <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2015–16 Europa League</a>. In June 2015, <a href="Vincenzo%20Montella">Vincenzo Montella</a> was sacked as manager after the club grew impatient with the coaches inability to prove his commitment to the club, later appointing <a href="Paulo%20Sousa">Paulo Sousa</a> on June 21 as the team's new head coach.

 

Fiorentina have had many managers and head coaches throughout their history. Below is a chronological list from the club's foundation in 1926 to the present day.

The official emblem of the city of <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, a red <a href="fleur-de-lis">fleur-de-lis</a> on a white field, has been pivotal in the all-round symbolism of the club.

Over the course of the club's history, they have had several badge changes, all of which incorporated Florence's fleur-de-lis in some way. The first one was nothing more than the city's coat of arms, a white shield with the red fleur-de-lis inside. It was soon changed to a very stylised fleur-de-lis, always red, and sometimes even without the white field. The most common symbol, adopted for about 20 years, had been a white <a href="lozenge">lozenge</a> with the flower inside. During the season they were Italian champions, the lozenge disappeared and the flower was overlapped with the "<a href="scudetto">scudetto</a>".

The logo introduced by owner Flavio Pontello in 1980 was particularly distinct, consisting of one-half of the city of Florence's emblem and one-half of the letter "F", for Fiorentina. People disliked it when it was introduced, believing it was a commercial decision and, above all, because the symbol bore more of a resemblance to a <a href="halberd">halberd</a> than a fleur-de-lis.

Today's logo is a kite shaped double <a href="lozenge">lozenge</a> bordered in gold. The outer lozenge has a purple background with the letters "AC" in white and the letter "F" in red, standing for the club's name. The inner lozenge is white with a gold border and the red fleur-de-lis of Florence. This logo had been in use from 1992 to 2002, but after the financial crisis and resurrection of the club the new one couldn't use the same logo. Florence's "<a href="comune">comune</a>" instead granted Florentia Viola use of the stylised coat of arms used in other city documents. Diego Della Valle acquired the current logo the following year in a judicial auction for a fee of €2.5 million, making it the most expensive logo in Italian football.

When Fiorentina was founded in 1926, the players wore red and white halved shirts derived from the colour of the city emblem. The more well-known and highly distinctive purple kit was adopted in 1928 and has been used ever since, giving rise to the nickname "La Viola" ("The Purple (team)"). Tradition has it that Fiorentina got their purple kit by mistake after an accident washing the old red and white coloured kits in the river.

The away kit has always been predominantly white, sometimes with purple and red elements, sometimes all-white. The shorts had been purple when the home kit was with white shorts. Fiorentina's third kit was first worn in the 1995–96 season and it was all-red with purple borders and two <a href="lily">lilies</a> on the shoulders. The red shirt has been the most worn 3rd shirt by Fiorentina, although they also wore rare yellow shirts ('97–'98, '99–'00 and '10–'11) and a sterling version, mostly in the <a href="Coppa%20Italia">Coppa Italia</a>, in 2000–01.

For the 2017–18 season and the first time in its history, the club will use five kits during the season, composing of one home kit (all-purple) and four away kits, each one representing one historic <a href="quartiere">quartiere</a> of the city of <a href="Florence">Florence</a>: all-blue (Santa Croce), all-white (Santo Spirito), all-green (San Giovanni) and all-red (Santa Maria Novella).

A.C. Fiorentina S.p.A. was unable to register for <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20Serie%20B">2002–03 Serie B</a> due to financial difficulties, and then the sports title was transferred to a new company thanks to <a href="Article%2052%20of%20N.O.I.F.">Article 52 of N.O.I.F.</a>, while the old company was liquidated. At that time the club was heavily rely on windfall profit from selling players, especially in pure player swap or cash plus player swap that potentially increase the cost by the increase in <a href="amortization">amortization</a> of player contracts (an <a href="intangible%20asset">intangible asset</a>s). For example, <a href="Marco%20Rossi%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201978%29">Marco Rossi</a> joined Fiorentina for 17 billion lire in 2000, but at the same time <a href="Lorenzo%20Collacchioni">Lorenzo Collacchioni</a> moved to <a href="U.S.%20Salernitana%201919">Salernitana</a> for 1 billion lire, making the club had a player profit of 997 million lire and extra 1 billion lire to be amortize in 5-year. In 1999, <a href="Emiliano%20Bigica">Emiliano Bigica</a> also swapped with <a href="Giuseppe%20Taglialatela">Giuseppe Taglialatela</a>, which the latter was valued for 10 billion lire. The operating income (excluding windfall profit from players trading) of 2000–01 season was minus 113,271,475,933 <a href="Italian%20lira">Italian lire</a> (minus €58,499,835). It was only boosted by the sales of <a href="Francesco%20Toldo">Francesco Toldo</a>, <a href="Rui%20Costa">Rui Costa</a> in June 2001 (a profit of 134.883 billion lire; €69.661 million). However, alleged to Parma for a reported 140 million lire. The two players eventually joined Inter Milan and A.C. Milan in 2001–02 financial year instead, for undisclosed fees. Fail to have financial support from the owner <a href="Vittorio%20Cecchi%20Gori">Vittorio Cecchi Gori</a>, the club windup due to its huge imbalance in operating income.

Since re-established in 2002, ACF Fiorentina S.p.A. yet to self-sustain to keep the team in top division as well as in European competitions. In the 2005 financial year, which cover the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Serie%20A">first Serie A season</a>, the club made a net loss of €9,159,356, followed by a net loss of €19,519,789. In 2006 (<a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Serie%20A">2005–06 Serie A</a> and <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20Serie%20A">2006–07 Serie A</a>), Fiorentina heavily invested on players, made the amortisation of intangible asset (the player contract) had increased from €17.7 million to €24 million. However the club suffered from <a href="2006%20Italian%20football%20scandal">2006 Italian football scandal</a>, meant the club did not qualify for Europe. In 2007 Fiorentina almost break-even, with a net loss of just €3,704,953. In 2007 financial year the TV revenue increased after qualified to <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20UEFA%20Cup">2007–08 UEFA Cup</a>. Despite qualified to <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20UEFA%20Champions%20League">2008–09 UEFA Champions League</a>, Fiorentina made a net loss of €9,179,484 in 2008 financial year after the increase in TV revenue was outweighed by the increase in wage. In the 2009 financial year, Fiorentina made a net profit of €4,442,803, largely due to the profit on selling players (€33,631,489 from players such as <a href="Felipe%20Melo">Felipe Melo</a>, <a href="Giampaolo%20Pazzini">Giampaolo Pazzini</a> and <a href="Zdravko%20Kuzmanovi%C4%87">Zdravko Kuzmanović</a>; increased from about €3.5 million in 2008). However it also offset by the write-down of selling players (€6,062,545, from players such as <a href="Manuel%20da%20Costa%20%28footballer%29">Manuel da Costa</a>, <a href="Arturo%20Lupoli">Arturo Lupoli</a> and <a href="Davide%20Carcuro">Davide Carcuro</a>).

After the club failed to qualify to Europe at the end of <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Serie%20A">2009–10 Serie A</a>, as well as lack of player profit, Fiorentina turnover was decreased from €140,040,713 in 2009 to just €79,854,928, despite wage bill also fell, "la Viola" still made a net loss of €9,604,353. In the 2011 financial year, the turnover slipped to €67,076,953, as the club's lack of capital gains from selling players and 2010 financial year still included the installments from UEFA for participating <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20UEFA%20Europa%20League">2009–10 UEFA Europa League</a>. Furthermore, the gate income had dropped from €11,070,385 to €7,541,260. The wage bill did not fall much and in reverse the amortization of transfer fee had sightly increased due to new signing. "La Viola" had saving in other cost but counter-weighted by huge €11,747,668 write-down for departed players, due to D'Agostino, Frey and Mutu, but the former would counter-weight by co-ownership financial income, which all made the operating cost remained high as worse as last year. Moreover, in 2010 the result was boosted by acquiring the asset from subsidiary (related to AC Fiorentina) and the re-valuation of its value in separate balance sheet. If deducting that income (€14,737,855), 2010 financial year was net loss 24,342,208 and 2011 result was worsen €8,131,876 only in separate balance sheet. In 2012, the club benefited from the sales of <a href="Matija%20Nastasi%C4%87">Matija Nastasić</a> and <a href="Valon%20Behrami">Valon Behrami</a>, followed by <a href="Stevan%20Joveti%C4%87">Stevan Jovetić</a> and <a href="Adem%20Ljaji%C4%87">Adem Ljajić</a> in 2013. In 2014, due to €28.4 million drop from the windfall profit of selling players, the club recorded their worst financial results since re-foundation, despite even the club maintained the same level of windfall profit, the result would still worse than in 2013. Moreover, Fiorentina also revealed that the club had a relevant football net income of minus €19.5 million in the first assessment period of <a href="UEFA%20Financial%20Fair%20Play%20Regulations">UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations</a> in 2013–14 season (in May 2014). (aggregate of 2012 and 2013 results), which within the limit of minus €45 million, as well as minus €25.5 million in assessment period 2014–15 (aggregate of 2012, 2013 and 2014 results). However, as the limit was reduced to minus €30 million in assessment period 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 season, the club had to achieve a relevant net income of positive €5.6 million in 2015 financial year. "La Viola" sold <a href="Juan%20Cuadrado">Juan Cuadrado</a> to Chelsea in January 2015 for €30 million fee, in order to make the club eligible to 2016–17 edition of UEFA competitions.

Afrobeat

Afrobeat is a <a href="music%20genre">music genre</a> which developed in the 1970s out of a combination of <a href="West%20African%20music">West African musical styles</a>, such as <a href="Fuji%20music">Fuji music</a> and <a href="highlife">highlife</a> with American <a href="jazz">jazz</a>, with a focus on <a href="chant">chant</a>ed vocals and <a href="Percussion%20instrument">percussion</a>.

The genre features <a href="chant">chant</a>s, <a href="call-and-response">call-and-response</a> vocals, and complex, interacting rhythms.

The term was coined by Nigerian <a href="multi-instrumentalist">multi-instrumentalist</a> and <a href="bandleader">bandleader</a> <a href="Kwesi%20manu">Kwesi manu</a> who popularised the style both within and outside <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>. It was partially borne out of an attempt to distinguish <a href="Fela%20Kuti">Fela Kuti's</a> music from the "<a href="soul%20music">soul music</a>" of American artists such as <a href="James%20Brown">James Brown</a>.

Afrobeat originated from Fuji, heavy Nigerian drumbeats, and Ghanaian <a href="highlife">highlife</a>. It was later exported to the southern part of <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> in the 1970s, by Fela Kuti, who experimented with many different forms of contemporary music of the time. The new sound hailed from a club that he established called the <a href="New%20Afrika%20Shrine">Afrika Shrine</a>. Upon arriving in Nigeria, Kuti also changed the name of his group to Africa '70. The band maintained a five-year residency in the Afrika Shrine from 1970 to 1975 while afrobeat thrived among Nigerian youth.

Prevalent in his and <a href="Lagbaja">Lagbaja</a>'s music are native Nigerian harmonies and rhythms, taking different elements and combining, modernizing, and improvising upon them. <a href="Politics">Politics</a> are essential to Afrobeat, since founder Kuti used social criticism to pave the way for social change. His message can be described as confrontational and controversial, which can be related to the political climate of most of the African countries in the 1970s, many of which were dealing with political injustice and military corruption while recovering from the transition from colonial governments to self-determination. As the genre spread throughout the African continent many bands took up the style. The recordings of these bands and their songs were rarely heard or exported outside the originating countries but many can now be found on <a href="compilation%20album">compilation album</a>s and <a href="CD">CD</a>s from specialist record shops.

Big band (15 to 30 pieces: Fela-era afrobeat) and energetic performances



<a href="Fela%20Kuti">Fela Kuti</a> included the traditional Gbedu drum in his ensemble, with a percussionist pounding out a thunderous rhythm from a drum lying on its side.

Many <a href="jazz">jazz</a> musicians have been attracted to Afrobeat. From <a href="Roy%20Ayers">Roy Ayers</a> in the 1970s to <a href="Randy%20Weston">Randy Weston</a> in the 1990s, there have been collaborations that have resulted in albums such as "Africa: Centre of the World" by Roy Ayers, released on the <a href="Polydor%20Records">Polydore</a> label in 1981. In 1994 <a href="Branford%20Marsalis">Branford Marsalis</a>, the American jazz saxophonist, included samples of Fela's "Beast of No Nation" on his "<a href="Buckshot%20LeFonque%20%28album%29">Buckshot LeFonque</a>" album. The new generation of <a href="Disc%20Jockey">DJs</a> and musicians of the 2000s who have fallen in love with both Kuti's material and other rare releases have made compilations and <a href="remix">remix</a>es of these recordings, thus re-introducing the genre to new generations of listeners and fans of <a href="Afro%20pop%20music">afropop</a> and <a href="Groove%20%28music%29">groove</a> (see <a href="%23afrobeats">Afrobeats</a> section below).

Afrobeat has also profoundly influenced important contemporary producers and musicians like <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a> and <a href="David%20Byrne">David Byrne</a>, who credit Fela Kuti as an essential influence. Both worked on <a href="Talking%20Heads">Talking Heads</a>' highly acclaimed 1980 album "<a href="Remain%20In%20Light">Remain In Light</a>", which brought polyrhythmic afrobeat influences to Western music.

The horn section of <a href="Antibalas">Antibalas</a> have been guest musicians on <a href="TV%20On%20The%20Radio">TV On The Radio</a>'s highly acclaimed 2008 album "<a href="Dear%20Science">Dear Science</a>", as well as on British band <a href="Foals%20%28band%29">Foals</a>' 2008 album, "<a href="Antidotes">Antidotes</a>". Some Afrobeat influence can also be found in the music of <a href="Vampire%20Weekend">Vampire Weekend</a> and <a href="Paul%20Simon">Paul Simon</a>.

From early in the 21st century, a new type of sound, originating in West Africa, has become increasingly prominent in African popular music. This sound was initially referred to simply as 'Naija music' after the common slang term for Nigeria, but has become known as Afrobeats. This name echo's Afrobeat, the 1970s fusion of jazz and traditional Ghanaian and Nigerian music which is an important influence, but Afrobeats is a largely different style. Early hits included "African Queen" by <a href="2face%20Idibia">2face Idibia</a> (2004) and "No One Like You" by <a href="P-Square">P-Square</a> (2007).

More recent hits include "Bumper2Bumper" by <a href="Wande%20Coal">Wande Coal</a> (2008), "<a href="Oleku%20%28Ice%20Prince%20song%29">Oleku</a>" by <a href="Ice%20Prince">Ice Prince</a> (2010) and "<a href="Ojuelegba%20%28Wizkid%20song%29">Ojuelegba</a>" by <a href="Wizkid%20%28musician%29">Wizkid</a> (2014).

Since 2012, Afrobeats have gained mainstream recognition outside of Africa, especially within the UK. UK hits have included "<a href="Oliver%20Twist%20%28D%27banj%20song%29">Oliver Twist</a>" by <a href="D%27banj">D'banj</a> which reached 9 in the UK singles charts in 2012, and "<a href="Million%20Pound%20Girl%20%28Badder%20Than%20Bad%29">Million Pound Girl (Badder Than Bad)</a>" by the British artist <a href="Fuse%20ODG">Fuse ODG</a> which reached 5 in the UK singles charts in 2014. Afrobeats nightclubs are now primary features of UK's nightlife with clubs opening in most major cities.

According to David Drake, the eclectic genre “reimagines diasporic influences and—more often than not—completely reinvents them.” However, some caution against equating Afrobeats to contemporary pan-African music, in order to prevent the erasure of local musical contributions.

Afrobeats is primarily produced between <a href="Lagos">Lagos</a>, <a href="Accra">Accra</a>, and <a href="London">London</a>. <a href="Paul%20Gilroy">Paul Gilroy</a>, of "The Black Atlantic", reflects on the changing London music scene as a result of shifting demographics:"We are moving towards an African majority which is diverse both in its cultural habits and in its relationship to colonial and postcolonial governance, so the shift away from Caribbean dominance needs to be placed in that setting. Most of the grime folks are African kids, either the children of migrants or migrants themselves. It's not clear what Africa might mean to them"Many first and second generation African immigrants follow - and produce - Afrobeats music. Fuse ODG, a UK artist of Ghanaian descent, coins #TINA or This is New Africa as a means to change perceptions of Africa:"This movement will shed light on Africa in a positive way and focus on how we can improve Africa. It’s not about just plying your talents in the Western world; it’s about going back home and helping Africa."

<doc id="3170" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3170" title="Arithmetic function">
Arithmetic function

In <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>, an arithmetic, arithmetical, or number-theoretic function is for most authors any <a href="Function%20%28mathematics%29">function</a> "f"("n") whose domain is the <a href="natural%20number">positive integers</a> and whose range is a <a href="subset">subset</a> of the <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a>s. Hardy & Wright include in their definition the requirement that an arithmetical function "expresses some arithmetical property of "n"".

An example of an arithmetic function is the <a href="divisor%20function">divisor function</a> whose value at a positive integer "n" is equal to the number of divisors of "n".

There is a larger class of number-theoretic functions that do not fit the above definition, e.g. the <a href="Prime%20counting%20function">prime-counting functions</a>. This article provides links to functions of both classes.

formula_1   and   formula_2   mean that the sum or product is over all <a href="prime%20number">prime number</a>s:

Similarly,   formula_5   and   formula_6   mean that the sum or product is over all <a href="prime%20power">prime power</a>s with strictly positive exponent (so 1 is not included):

formula_8   and   formula_9   mean that the sum or product is over all positive divisors of "n", including 1 and "n". E.g., if "n" = 12,

The notations can be combined:   formula_11   and   formula_12   mean that the sum or product is over all prime divisors of "n". E.g., if "n" = 18,

and similarly   formula_14   and   formula_15   mean that the sum or product is over all prime powers dividing "n". E.g., if "n" = 24,

An arithmetic function "a" is

Two whole numbers "m" and "n" are called <a href="coprime">coprime</a> if their <a href="greatest%20common%20divisor">greatest common divisor</a> is 1; i.e., if there is no <a href="prime%20number">prime number</a> that divides both of them.

Then an arithmetic function "a" is

The <a href="fundamental%20theorem%20of%20arithmetic">fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a> states that any positive integer "n" can be represented uniquely as a product of powers of primes:   formula_17   where "p" < "p" < ... < "p" are primes and the "a" are positive integers. (1 is given by the empty product.)

It is often convenient to write this as an infinite product over all the primes, where all but a finite number have a zero exponent. Define ν("n") as the exponent of the highest power of the prime "p" that divides "n". I.e. if "p" is one of the "p" then ν("n") = "a", otherwise it is zero. Then

In terms of the above the functions ω and Ω are defined by

To avoid repetition, whenever possible formulas for the functions listed in this article are given in terms of "n" and the corresponding "p", "a", ω, and Ω.

<a href="divisor%20function">σ("n")</a> is the sum of the "k"th powers of the positive divisors of "n", including 1 and "n", where "k" is a complex number.

σ("n"), the sum of the (positive) divisors of "n", is usually denoted by σ("n").

Since a positive number to the zero power is one, σ("n") is therefore the number of (positive) divisors of "n"; it is usually denoted by "d"("n") or τ("n") (for the German "Teiler" = divisors).

Setting "k" = 0 in the second product gives

<a href="Euler%20totient%20function">φ("n")</a>, the Euler totient function, is the number of positive integers not greater than "n" that are coprime to "n".

<a href="Jordan%20totient%20function">J("n")</a>, the Jordan totient function, is the number of "k"-tuples of positive integers all less than or equal to "n" that form a coprime ("k" + 1)-tuple together with "n". It is a generalization of Euler's totient, .

<a href="M%C3%B6bius%20function">μ("n")</a>, the Möbius function, is important because of the <a href="M%C3%B6bius%20inversion">Möbius inversion</a> formula. See <a href="%23Dirichlet%20convolution">Dirichlet convolution</a>, below.

This implies that μ(1) = 1. (Because Ω(1) = ω(1) = 0.)

<a href="Tau-function">τ("n")</a>, the Ramanujan tau function, is defined by its <a href="generating%20function">generating function</a> identity:

Although it is hard to say exactly what "arithmetical property of "n"" it "expresses", (τ("n") is (2π) times the "n"th Fourier coefficient in the <a href="q-expansion">q-expansion</a> of the <a href="Modular%20discriminant%23Modular%20discriminant">modular discriminant</a> function) it is included among the arithmetical functions because it is multiplicative and it occurs in identities involving certain σ("n") and "r"("n") functions (because these are also coefficients in the expansion of <a href="modular%20form">modular form</a>s).

<a href="Ramanujan%27s%20sum">"c"("n")</a>, Ramanujan's sum, is the sum of the "n"th powers of the primitive "q"th <a href="roots%20of%20unity">roots of unity</a>:

Even though it is defined as a sum of complex numbers (irrational for most values of "q"), it is an integer. For a fixed value of "n" it is multiplicative in "q":

Many of the functions mentioned in this article have expansions as series involving these sums; see the article <a href="Ramanujan%27s%20sum">Ramanujan's sum</a> for examples.

<a href="Liouville%20function">λ("n")</a>, the Liouville function, is defined by

All <a href="Dirichlet%20character">Dirichlet character</a>s χ("n") are completely multiplicative. An example is the non-principal character (mod 4) defined in the introduction. Two characters have special notations:

The principal character (mod "n") is denoted by χ("a") (or χ("a")). It is defined as

The quadratic character (mod "n") is denoted by the <a href="Jacobi%20symbol">Jacobi symbol</a> for odd "n" (it is not defined for even "n".):

In this formula formula_30 is the <a href="Legendre%20symbol">Legendre symbol</a>, defined for all integers "a" and all odd primes "p" by

Following the normal convention for the empty product, formula_32

ω("n"), defined above as the number of distinct primes dividing "n", is additive.

<a href="Prime%20factor">Ω("n")</a>, defined above as the number of prime factors of "n" counted with multiplicities, is completely additive.

For a fixed prime "p", ν("n"), defined above as the exponent of the largest power of "p" dividing "n", is completely additive.

These important functions (which are not arithmetic functions) are defined for non-negative real arguments, and are used in the various statements and proofs of the <a href="prime%20number%20theorem">prime number theorem</a>. They are summation functions (see the main section just below) of arithmetic functions which are neither multiplicative nor additive.

<a href="prime%20counting%20function">π("x")</a>, the prime counting function, is the number of primes not exceeding "x". It is the summation function of the <a href="indicator%20function">characteristic function</a> of the prime numbers.

A related function counts prime powers with weight 1 for primes, 1/2 for their squares, 1/3 for cubes, … It is the summation function of the arithmetic function which takes the value 1/"k" on integers which are the k-th power of some prime number, and the value 0 on other integers.

<a href="Chebyshev%20function">"θ"("x")</a> and "ψ"("x"), the Chebyshev functions,
are defined as sums of the natural logarithms of the primes not exceeding "x".

The Chebyshev function "ψ"("x") is the summation function of the von Mangoldt function just below.

<a href="von%20Mangoldt%20function">Λ("n")</a>, the von Mangoldt function, is 0 unless the argument is a prime power, in which case it is the natural log of the prime:

<a href="partition%20function%20%28number%20theory%29">"p"("n")</a>, the partition function, is the number of ways of representing "n" as a sum of positive integers, where two representations with the same summands in a different order are not counted as being different:

<a href="Carmichael%20function">λ("n")</a>, the Carmichael function, is the smallest positive number such that formula_39   for all "a" coprime to "n". Equivalently, it is the <a href="least%20common%20multiple">least common multiple</a> of the orders of the elements of the <a href="Multiplicative%20group%20of%20integers%20modulo%20n">multiplicative group of integers modulo "n"</a>.

For powers of odd primes and for 2 and 4, λ("n") is equal to the Euler totient function of "n"; for powers of 2 greater than 4 it is equal to one half of the Euler totient function of "n":

and for general "n" it is the least common multiple of λ of each of the prime power factors of "n":

<a href="Ideal%20class%20group">"h"("n")</a>, the class number function, is the order of the ideal class group of an algebraic extension of the rationals with <a href="discriminant">discriminant</a> "n". The notation is ambiguous, as there are in general many extensions with the same discriminant. See <a href="quadratic%20field">quadratic field</a> and <a href="cyclotomic%20field">cyclotomic field</a> for classical examples.

<a href="Sum%20of%20squares%20function">"r"("n")</a> is the number of ways "n" can be represented as the sum of "k" squares, where representations that differ only in the order of the summands or in the signs of the square roots are counted as different.

Given an arithmetic function "a(n)", its summation function "A(x)" is defined by
"A" can be regarded as a function of a real variable. Given a positive integer "m", "A" is constant along <a href="open%20interval">open interval</a>s "m" < "x" < "m" + 1, and has a <a href="Classification%20of%20discontinuities">jump discontinuity</a> at each integer for which "a(m)" ≠ 0.

Since such functions are often represented by series and integrals, to achieve pointwise convergence it is usual to define the value at the discontinuities as the average of the values to the left and right:

Individual values of arithmetic functions may fluctuate wildly – as in most of the above examples. Summation functions "smooth out" these fluctuations. In some cases it may be possible to find <a href="Asymptotic%20analysis">asymptotic behaviour</a> for the summation function for large "x".

A classical example of this phenomenon is given by the <a href="divisor%20summatory%20function">divisor summatory function</a>, the summation function of "d"("n"), the number of divisors of "n":

An <a href="average%20order%20of%20an%20arithmetic%20function">average order of an arithmetic function</a> is some simpler or better-understood function which has the same summation function asymptotically, and hence takes the same values "on average". We say that "g" is an "average order" of "f" if

as "x" tends to infinity. The example above shows that "d"("n") has the average order log("n").

Given an arithmetic function "a(n)", let "F(s)", for complex "s", be the function defined by the corresponding <a href="Dirichlet%20series">Dirichlet series</a> (where it <a href="Convergent%20series">converges</a>):
"F(s)" is called a <a href="generating%20function">generating function</a> of "a(n)". The simplest such series, corresponding to the constant function "a"("n") = 1 for all "n", is ς("s") the <a href="Riemann%20zeta%20function">Riemann zeta function</a>.

The generating function of the Möbius function is the inverse of the zeta function:

Consider two arithmetic functions "a" and "b" and their respective generating functions "F"("s") and "F"("s"). The product "F"("s")"F"("s") can be computed as follows:

It is a straightforward exercise to show that if "c"("n") is defined by

then

This function "c" is called the <a href="Dirichlet%20convolution">Dirichlet convolution</a> of "a" and "b", and is denoted by formula_54.

A particularly important case is convolution with the constant function "a"("n") = 1 for all "n", corresponding to multiplying the generating function by the zeta function:

Multiplying by the inverse of the zeta function gives the <a href="M%C3%B6bius%20inversion">Möbius inversion</a> formula:

If "f" is multiplicative, then so is "g". If "f" is completely multiplicative, then "g" is multiplicative, but may or may not be completely multiplicative.

There are a great many formulas connecting arithmetical functions with each other and with the functions of analysis, especially powers, roots, and the exponential and log functions.

Here are a few examples:

There is a formula for r in the section on <a href="%23Class%20number%20related">class numbers</a> below.

Define the function σ("n") as

That is, if "n" is odd, σ("n") is the sum of the "k"th powers of the divisors of "n", i.e. σ("n"), and if "n" is even it is the sum of the "k"th powers of the even divisors of "n" minus the sum of the "k"th powers of the odd divisors of "n".

Adopt the convention that Ramanujan's τ("x") = 0 if "x" is not an integer.

Here "convolution" does not mean "Dirichlet convolution" but instead refers to the formula for the coefficients of the <a href="Power%20series%23Multiplication%20and%20division">product of two power series</a>:

The sequence formula_82 is called the <a href="convolution">convolution</a> or the <a href="Cauchy%20product">Cauchy product</a> of the sequences "a" and "b".
<br>See <a href="Eisenstein%20series">Eisenstein series</a> for a discussion of the series and functional identities involved in these formulas.

Since σ("n") (for natural number "k") and τ("n") are integers, the above formulas can be used to prove congruences for the functions. See <a href="Tau-function">Tau-function</a> for some examples.

Extend the domain of the partition function by setting "p"(0) = 1.

<a href="Peter%20Gustav%20Lejeune%20Dirichlet">Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet</a> discovered formulas that relate the class number "h" of <a href="quadratic%20number%20field">quadratic number field</a>s to the Jacobi symbol.

An integer "D" is called a fundamental discriminant if it is the <a href="discriminant">discriminant</a> of a quadratic number field. This is equivalent to "D" ≠ 1 and either a) "D" is <a href="squarefree">squarefree</a> and "D" ≡ 1 (mod 4) or b) "D" ≡ 0 (mod 4), "D"/4 is squarefree, and "D"/4 ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4).

Extend the Jacobi symbol to accept even numbers in the "denominator" by defining the <a href="Kronecker%20symbol">Kronecker symbol</a>:

Then if "D" < −4 is a fundamental discriminant

There is also a formula relating "r" and "h". Again, let "D" be a fundamental discriminant, "D" < −4. Then

Let formula_92   be the "n"th <a href="harmonic%20number">harmonic number</a>.   Then

The Riemann hypothesis is also equivalent to the statement that, for all "n" > 5040,

In 1965 P. Kesava Menon proved

This has been generalized by a number of mathematicians, e.g.:

B. Sury

N. Rao
where "a", "a", ..., "a" are integers, gcd("a", "a", ..., "a", "n") = 1.

L. Tóth
where "m" and "m" are odd, "m" = lcm("m", "m").

In fact, if "f" is any arithmetical function
where * stands for Dirichlet convolution.

Let "m" and "n" be distinct, odd, and positive. Then the Jacobi symbol satisfies the law of <a href="quadratic%20reciprocity">quadratic reciprocity</a>:

Let λ("n") be Liouville's function. Then

Let λ("n") be Carmichael's function. Then

Although this document was subsequently adopted by <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a> (ISO) and subsequent revisions published by ISO have been adopted by ANSI, many programmers still use "ANSI C" to refer to the standard. While some software developers use the term ISO C, others are standards body–neutral and use Standard C.

In 1983, the American National Standards Institute formed a committee, X3J11, to establish a standard specification of C. The standard was completed in 1989 and ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 "Programming Language C." This version of the language is often referred to as "ANSI C". Later on sometimes the label "C89" is used to distinguish it from C99 but using the same labelling method.

The same standard as C89 was ratified by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, with only formatting changes, which is sometimes referred to as C90. Therefore, the terms "C89" and "C90" refer to essentially the same language.

This standard has been withdrawn by both ANSI/INCITS and ISO/IEC.

In 1995, the <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization">ISO</a> published an extension, called Amendment 1, for the ANSI-C standard. Its full name finally was "ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995" or nicknamed "C95". Aside from error correction there were further changes to the language capabilities, such as:


In addition to the amendment, two technical corrigenda were published by ISO for C90:


In March 2000, ANSI adopted the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard. This standard is commonly referred to as C99. Some notable additions to the previous standard include:


Three technical corrigenda were published by ISO for C99:


This standard has been withdrawn by both ANSI/INCITS and ISO/IEC in favour of C11.

"C11" is the current <a href="Open%20standard">standard</a> for the <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C programming language</a>. Notable features introduced over the previous revision include improved <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> support, type-generic expressions using the new codice_16 keyword, a cross-platform <a href="Thread%20%28computing%29">multi-threading</a> API (codice_17) and <a href="Linearizability">atomic</a> types support in both core language and the library (codice_18).

One technical corrigendum has been published by ISO for C11:


As part of the standardization process, ISO also publishes <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization%23International%20Standards%20and%20other%20publications">technical reports and specifications</a> related to the C language:

More technical specifications are in development and pending approval, including the fifth and final part of TS 18661, a software transactional memory specification, and parallel library extensions.

ANSI C is now supported by almost all the widely used compilers. Most of the C code being written nowadays is based on ANSI C. Any program written "only" in standard C and without any hardware dependent assumptions is virtually guaranteed to compile correctly on any <a href="system%20platform">platform</a> with a conforming C implementation. Without such precautions, most programs may compile only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler, due, for example, to the use of non-standard libraries, such as <a href="Graphical%20user%20interface">GUI</a> libraries, or to the reliance on compiler- or platform-specific attributes such as the exact size of certain data types and byte <a href="endianness">endianness</a>.

To mitigate the differences between <a href="K%26amp%3BR%20C">K&R C</a> and the ANSI C standard, the codice_19 ("standard c") macro can be used to split code into ANSI and K&R sections.
In the above example, a prototype is used in a function declaration for ANSI compliant implementations, while an obsolescent non-prototype declaration is used otherwise. Those are still ANSI-compliant as of C99. Note how this code checks both definition and evaluation: this is because some implementations may set codice_19 to zero to indicate non-ANSI compliance.

Alien and Sedition Acts

The Alien and Sedition Acts were four bills passed by the <a href="Federalist%20Party">Federalist</a>-dominated <a href="5th%20United%20States%20Congress">5th United States Congress</a> and signed into law by President <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a> in 1798. They made it harder for an immigrant to become a citizen (<a href="Naturalization%20Act%20of%201798">Naturalization Act</a>), allowed the president to imprison and deport non-citizens who were deemed dangerous (<a href="Alien%20Friends%20Act%20of%201798">Alien Friends Act of 1798</a>) or who were from a hostile nation (<a href="Alien%20Enemy%20Act%20of%201798">Alien Enemy Act of 1798</a>), and criminalized making false statements that were critical of the federal government (Sedition Act of 1798).

The Federalists argued that the bills strengthened national security during an <a href="Quasi-War">undeclared naval war with France</a>. Critics argued that they were primarily an attempt to suppress voters who disagreed with the Federalist party, and violated the right of freedom of speech in the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a>. Three of the acts were repealed after the <a href="Democratic-Republican">Democratic-Republican</a> party of <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> came to power. But the Alien Enemies Act remained in effect, was revised and codified in 1918 for use in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and was used by <a href="President%20Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt">President Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> to imprison <a href="Japanese%20people">Japanese</a>, <a href="German%20people">German</a>, and <a href="Italian%20people">Italian</a> aliens during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Following cessation of hostilities, the act was used by President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> to continue to imprison, then deport, aliens of the formerly hostile nations. In 1948 the Supreme Court determined that presidential powers under the acts continued after cessation of hostilities until there was a peace treaty with the hostile nation. The revised Alien Enemies Act remains in effect today.

The Naturalization Act increased the residency requirement for <a href="Citizenship%20in%20the%20United%20States">American citizenship</a> from five to fourteen years. At the time, the majority of immigrants supported <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and the Democratic-Republicans, the political opponents of the Federalists. The Alien Friends Act allowed the president to imprison or deport aliens considered "dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States" at any time, while the Alien Enemies Act authorized the president to do the same to any male citizen of a hostile nation above the age of fourteen during times of war. Lastly, the controversial Sedition Act restricted speech that was critical of the federal government. Under the Sedition Act, the Federalists allowed people who were accused of violating the sedition laws to use truth as a defense. The Sedition Act resulted in the prosecution and conviction of many Jeffersonian newspaper owners who disagreed with the government.

The acts were denounced by Democratic-Republicans and ultimately helped them to victory in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201800">1800 election</a>, when <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> defeated the incumbent, President Adams. The Sedition Act and the Alien Friends Act were allowed to expire in 1800 and 1801, respectively. The Alien Enemies Act, however, remains in effect as Chapter 3; Sections 21–24 of <a href="Title%2050%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Code">Title 50 of the United States Code</a>.

Opposition to the Federalists, spurred by Democratic-Republicans, reached new heights with the Democratic-Republicans' support of France, which was still in the midst of the French Revolution. Some appeared to desire in the United States an event similar to the French Revolution, in order to overthrow the government. When Democratic-Republicans in some states refused to enforce federal laws such as the 1791 <a href="whiskey%20tax">whiskey tax</a>, the first tax levied by the national government, and threatened to rebel, Federalists warned that they would send in the army to force them to capitulate. As the unrest sweeping Europe spread to the United States, calls for secession reached unparalleled heights, and the fledgling nation seemed ready to tear itself apart. Some of this agitation was seen by Federalists as having been caused by French and French-sympathizing immigrants. The Alien Act and the Sedition Act were meant to guard against this perceived threat of anarchy.

They were a major political issue in the elections of 1798 and 1800, controversial then, and remaining so today. Opposition to them resulted in the highly controversial <a href="Virginia%20and%20Kentucky%20Resolutions">Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions</a>, authored by <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> and Thomas Jefferson. Prominent prosecutions under the Sedition Act include:


The Democratic-Republicans made the Alien and Sedition Acts an important issue in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201800">1800 election</a> campaign. Upon assuming the Presidency, Thomas Jefferson pardoned those still serving sentences under the Sedition Act, and Congress soon repaid their fines. It has been said that the Alien Acts were aimed at <a href="Albert%20Gallatin">Albert Gallatin</a>, and the Sedition Act aimed at Benjamin Bache's "Aurora". While government authorities prepared lists of aliens for deportation, many aliens fled the country during the debate over the Alien and Sedition Acts, and Adams never signed a deportation order.

The Alien and Sedition Acts were never appealed to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a>, whose right of <a href="Judicial%20review%20%28law%29">judicial review</a> was not clearly established until "<a href="Marbury%20v.%20Madison">Marbury v. Madison</a>" in 1803. Subsequent mentions in Supreme Court opinions beginning in the mid-20th century have assumed that the Sedition Act would today be found unconstitutional.

<a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> also secretly drafted the <a href="Kentucky%20and%20Virginia%20Resolutions">Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions</a> denouncing the federal legislation, though many other state legislatures strongly opposed these resolutions. Though the resolutions followed Madison's "<a href="interposition">interposition</a>" approach, Jefferson advocated <a href="Nullification%20%28U.S.%20Constitution%29">nullification</a> and at one point drafted a threat for Kentucky to <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">secede</a>. Jefferson's biographer <a href="Dumas%20Malone">Dumas Malone</a> argued that this might have gotten Jefferson impeached for treason, had his actions become known at the time. In writing the Kentucky Resolutions, Jefferson warned that, "unless arrested at the threshold," the Alien and Sedition Acts would "necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood." Historian <a href="Ron%20Chernow">Ron Chernow</a> says of this "he wasn't calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience: he was calling for outright rebellion, if needed, against the federal government of which he was vice president." Jefferson "thus set forth a radical doctrine of states' rights that effectively undermined the constitution." Chernow argues that neither Jefferson nor Madison sensed that they had sponsored measures as inimical as the Alien and Sedition Acts themselves. Historian <a href="Garry%20Wills">Garry Wills</a> argued, "Their nullification effort, if others had picked it up, would have been a greater threat to freedom than the misguided [alien and sedition] laws, which were soon rendered feckless by ridicule and electoral pressure" The theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia resolutions was "deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion". George Washington was so appalled by them that he told Patrick Henry that if "systematically and pertinaciously pursued", they would "dissolve the union or produce coercion". The influence of Jefferson's doctrine of states' rights reverberated right up to the Civil War and beyond. At the close of the Civil War, future president <a href="James%20Garfield">James Garfield</a> said that Jefferson's Kentucky Resolution "contained the germ of nullification and secession, and we are today reaping the fruits".

The Alien Enemies Acts remained in effect at the outset of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. It was recodified to be part of the US war and national defense statutes (50 USC 21–24).

On December 7, 1941, responding to the <a href="bombing%20of%20Pearl%20Harbor">bombing of Pearl Harbor</a>, <a href="President%20Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt">President Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> used the authority of the revised Alien Enemies Act to issue <a href="presidential%20proclamation">presidential proclamation</a>s 2525 (Alien Enemies – Japanese), 2526 (Alien Enemies – German), and 2527 (Alien Enemies – Italian), to apprehend, restrain, secure and remove Japanese, German, and Italian non-citizens. On February 19, 1942, citing authority of the wartime powers of the president and commander in chief, Roosevelt made <a href="Executive%20Order%209066">Executive Order 9066</a>, authorizing the Secretary of War to prescribe military areas and giving him authority that superseded the authority of other executives under Proclamations 2525-7. EO 9066 led to the <a href="internment%20of%20Japanese%20Americans">internment of Japanese Americans</a>, whereby over 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry living on the Pacific coast were forcibly relocated and forced to live in camps in the interior of the country, 62% of whom were <a href="United%20States%20citizen">United States citizen</a>s, not aliens.

Hostilities with Germany and Italy ended in May 1945, and with Japan in August. Alien enemies, and U.S. citizens, continued to be interned. On July 14, 1945, President <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a> issued Presidential Proclamation 2655, titled “Removal of Alien Enemies”. The proclamation gave the <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> authority regarding aliens enemies within the <a href="continental%20United%20States">continental United States</a>, to decide whether they are "dangerous to the public peace and safety of the United States", to order them removed, and to create regulations governing their removal. The proclamation cited the revised Alien Enemies Act (50 U.S.C. 21–24) as to powers of the President to make public proclamation regarding "subjects of the hostile nation" more than fourteen years old and living inside the United States but not naturalized, to remove them as alien enemies, and to determine the means of removal.

On September 8, 1945, Truman issued Presidential Proclamation 2662, titled "Removal of Alien Enemies". The revised Alien Enemies Act (50 U.S.C. 21–24) was cited as to removal of alien enemies in the interest of the public safety. The United States had agreed, at a conference in Rio de Janeiro in 1942, to assume responsibility for the restraint and repatriation of dangerous alien enemies to be sent to the United States from Latin American republics. In another inter-American conference in Mexico City on March 8, 1945, North and South American governments resolved to recommended adoption of measures to prevent aliens of hostile nations who were deemed to be security threats or threats to welfare from remaining in North or South America. Truman gave authority to the Secretary of State to determine if alien enemies in the United States who were sent to the United States from Latin America, or who were in the United States illegally, endangered the welfare or security of the country. The Secretary of State was given power to remove them "to destinations outside the limits of the Western Hemisphere", to the former enemy territory of the governments to whose "principles of which (the alien enemies) have adhered". The Department of Justice was directed to assist the Secretary of State in their prompt removal.

On April 10, 1946, Truman issued Presidential Proclamation 2685, titled “Removal of Alien Enemies”, citing the revised Alien Enemies Act (50 U.S.C. 21–24) as to its provision for the “removal from the United States of alien enemies in the interest of the public safety”. Truman proclaimed regulations that were in addition to and supplemented other "regulations affecting the restraint and removal of alien enemies". As to alien enemies who had been brought into the <a href="continental%20United%20States">continental United States</a> from Latin America after December 1941, the proclamation gave the Secretary of State authority to decide if their presence was "prejudicial to the future security or welfare of the Americas", and to make regulations for their removal. 30 days was set as the reasonable time for them to "effect the recovery, disposal, and removal of (their) goods and effects, and for (their) departure."

In 1947 New York's <a href="Ellis%20Island">Ellis Island</a> continued to incarcerate hundreds of ethnic Germans. Fort Lincoln was a large internment camp still holding internees in <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a>. North Dakota was represented by controversial Senator <a href="William%20Langer">William "Wild Bill" Langer</a>. Langer introduced a bill (S. 1749) "for the relief of all persons detained as enemy aliens", and directing the US Attorney General to cancel "outstanding warrants of arrest, removal, or deportation" for many German aliens still interned, listing many by name, and all of those detained by the <a href="Immigration%20and%20Naturalization%20Service">Immigration and Naturalization Service</a> (INS), which was under the Department of Justice (DOJ). It directed the INS not to issue any more warrants or orders, if their only basis was the original warrants of arrest. The bill never passed. The Attorney General gave up <a href="plenary%20power">plenary</a> jurisdiction over the last internee on Ellis Island late in 1948.

In Ludecke v. Watkins (1948), the Supreme Court interpreted the time of release under the Alien Enemies Act. German alien Kurt G. W. Ludecke was detained in 1941, under Proclamation 2526. and continued to be held after cessation of hostilities. In 1947, Ludecke petitioned for a <a href="writ%20of%20habeas%20corpus">writ of habeas corpus</a> to order his release, after the Attorney General ordered him deported. The court ruled 5–4 to release Ludecke, but also found that the Alien Enemies Act allowed for detainment beyond the time hostilities ceased, until an actual treaty was signed with the hostile nation or government.

In 1988, President Reagan and the 100th Congress introduced the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, whose purpose amongst others was to acknowledge and apologize for actions of the US against individuals of Japanese ancestry during World War II. The statement from Congress agreed with the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, that "a grave injustice was done to both citizens and permanent resident aliens of Japanese... without adequate security reasons and without any acts of espionage or sabotage documented by the Commission, and were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership."

In 2015, presidential candidate <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> made a proposal to ban all <a href="Muslims">Muslims</a> from entering the United States (as part of the <a href="War%20on%20Terror">War on Terror</a>); Roosevelt's application of the Alien Enemies Act was cited as a possible justification. The proposal created international controversy, drawing criticism from foreign heads of state that have historically remained uninvolved in United States presidential elections. A former <a href="Reagan%20Administration">Reagan Administration</a> aide noted that, despite criticism of Trump's proposal to invoke the law, "the Alien Enemies Act... is still on the books... (and people) in Congress for many decades (haven’t) repealed the law... (nor has) <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>". Other critics claimed that the proposal violated founding principles, and was unconstitutional for singling out a religion, and not a hostile nation. They included the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Pentagon</a> and others, who argued that the proposal (and its citation of the Alien Enemies proclamations as authority) played into the <a href="ISIL">ISIL</a> narrative that the United States was at war with the entire Muslim religion (not just with ISIL and other <a href="terrorist">terrorist</a> entities).

<doc id="3175" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3175" title="Antinomy">
Antinomy

Antinomy (<a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> ἀντί, "antí", "against, in opposition to", and νόμος, "nómos", "law") refers to a real or apparent mutual incompatibility of two laws. It is a term used in <a href="logic">logic</a> and <a href="epistemology">epistemology</a>, particularly in the philosophy of <a href="Kant">Kant</a> and <a href="Roberto%20Mangabeira%20Unger">Roberto Unger</a>.

There are many examples of antinomy. A self-contradictory phrase such as "There is no absolute truth" can be considered an antinomy because this statement is suggesting in itself to be an absolute truth, and therefore denies itself any truth in its statement. A <a href="paradox">paradox</a> such as "<a href="this%20sentence%20is%20false">this sentence is false</a>" can also be considered to be an antinomy; for the sentence to be true, it must be false, and vice versa.

The term acquired a special significance in the philosophy of <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> (1724–1804), who used it to describe the equally rational but contradictory results of applying to the universe of pure thought the categories or criteria of reason that are proper to the universe of sensible perception or <a href="experience">experience</a> (phenomena). <a href="Empirical">Empirical</a> reason cannot here play the role of establishing rational truths because it goes beyond possible experience and is applied to the sphere of that which <a href="transcendence%20%28philosophy%29">transcends</a> it.

For Kant there are <a href="Kant%27s%20antinomies">four antinomies</a>, connected with:

In each antinomy, a thesis is contradicted by an antithesis. For example: in the first antinomy, Kant proves the thesis that time must have a beginning by showing that if time had no beginning, then an infinity would have elapsed up until the present moment. This is a manifest contradiction because infinity cannot, by definition, be completed by "successive synthesis"—yet just such a finalizing synthesis would be required by the view that time is infinite; so the thesis is proven. Then he proves the antithesis, that time has no beginning, by showing that if time had a beginning, then there must have been "empty time" out of which time arose. This is incoherent (for Kant) for the following reason: Since, necessarily, no time elapses in this pretemporal void, then there could be no alteration, and therefore nothing (including time) would ever come to be: so the antithesis is proven. Reason makes equal claim to each proof, since they are both correct, so the question of the limits of time must be regarded as meaningless.

This was part of Kant's critical program of determining limits to <a href="science">science</a> and philosophical inquiry. These contradictions are inherent in reason when it is applied to the world as it is in itself, independently of any perception of it (this has to do with the distinction between <a href="phenomena">phenomena</a> and <a href="noumena">noumena</a>). Kant's goal in his critical philosophy was to identify what claims are and are not justified, and the antinomies are a particularly illustrative example of his larger project.

Ascending chain condition

In mathematics, the ascending chain condition (ACC) and descending chain condition (DCC) are finiteness properties satisfied by some algebraic structures, most importantly <a href="Ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideal</a>s in certain <a href="commutative%20ring">commutative ring</a>s. These conditions played an important role in the development of the structure theory of commutative rings in the works of <a href="David%20Hilbert">David Hilbert</a>, <a href="Emmy%20Noether">Emmy Noether</a>, and <a href="Emil%20Artin">Emil Artin</a>.
The conditions themselves can be stated in an abstract form, so that they make sense for any <a href="partially%20ordered%20set">partially ordered set</a>. This point of view is useful in abstract algebraic dimension theory due to Gabriel and Rentschler.

Adin Steinsaltz

Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz (Hebrew: עדין שטיינזלץ) or Adin Even Yisrael (Hebrew: עדין אבן ישראל) (born 1937) is a teacher, philosopher, social critic, and spiritual mentor, who has been hailed by "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine as a "once-in-a-millennium scholar". He has devoted his life to making the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> accessible to all Jews. Originally published in <a href="modern%20Hebrew">modern Hebrew</a>, with a running commentary to facilitate learning, his "Steinsaltz edition of the Talmud" has also been translated into English, French, Russian, and Spanish. Beginning in 1989, Steinsaltz published several <a href="tract%20%28literature%29">tractates</a> in Hebrew and English of the Babylonian (Bavli) Talmud in an English-Hebrew edition. The first volume of a new English-Hebrew edition, the Koren Talmud Bavli, was released in May, 2012, with thirteen tractates in print by July 2014. New volumes are being released following the <a href="Daf%20Yomi">Daf Yomi</a> cycle.

Born in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in 1937 to secular parents, Steinsaltz studied mathematics, physics, and chemistry at the <a href="Hebrew%20University%20of%20Jerusalem">Hebrew University</a>, in addition to rabbinical studies. Following graduation, he established several experimental schools after an unsuccessful attempt to start a neo-<a href="Hassidic">Hassidic</a> community in the <a href="Negev%20desert">Negev desert</a>, and, at the age of 23, became <a href="Israel">Israel</a>’s youngest school principal.

In 1965, he founded the Israel Institute for Talmudic Publications, and began his monumental work on the Talmud, including translation into Hebrew, English, Russian, and various other languages. The Steinsaltz editions of the Talmud include translation from the original <a href="Aramaic">Aramaic</a> and a comprehensive commentary. Steinsaltz completed his Hebrew edition of the entire Babylonian Talmud in November 2010, at which time <a href="Koren%20Publishers%20Jerusalem">Koren Publishers Jerusalem</a> became the publisher of all of his works, including the Talmud. While not without criticism (such as by <a href="Jacob%20Neusner">Jacob Neusner</a>, 1998), the Steinsaltz edition is widely used throughout Israel, the United States, and the world. Over two million volumes of the Steinsaltz Talmud have been distributed to date. The out-of-print <a href="Random%20House">Random House</a> publication of "" is widely regarded as the most accurate and least redacted of any English language edition, and is sought after on that basis by scholars and collectors. Controversial Talmud passages previously obscured, omitted entirely or confined to footnotes in English translations like the <a href="Soncino%20Press">Soncino</a> Talmud, receive full exposition in the Steinsaltz Talmud. Random House halted publication of the Steinsaltz Talmud after less than one-third of the English translation had been published.

The Steinsaltz editions of the Talmud have opened up the world of Talmud study to thousands of people outside the walls of the traditional yeshiva, including women, who traditionally were not taught Talmud. Regarding the access that his work provides, Rabbi Steinsaltz says: "I never thought that spreading ignorance has any advantage, except for those who are in a position of power and want to deprive others of their rights and spread ignorance in order to keep them underlings."

Rabbi Steinsaltz's classic work of <a href="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a>, "The Thirteen Petalled Rose", was first published in 1980, and now appears in eight languages. In all, Steinsaltz has authored some 60 books and hundreds of articles on subjects including Talmud, <a href="Kabbalah">Jewish mysticism</a>, <a href="Jewish%20philosophy">Jewish philosophy</a>, <a href="sociology">sociology</a>, historical biography, and philosophy. Many of these works have been translated into English by his close personal friend, now deceased, Yehuda Hanegbi. His latest book is a memoir-biography on the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi <a href="Menachem%20Mendel%20Schneerson">Menachem Mendel Schneerson</a>, published by Maggid Books (2014).

In the summer of 1989, a group of rabbis including <a href="Elazar%20Shach">Elazar Shach</a> placed a ban on three of Steinsaltz's books.

Continuing his work as a teacher and spiritual mentor, Steinsaltz established a network of schools and educational institutions in Israel and the former Soviet Union. He has served as scholar in residence at the <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson%20International%20Center%20for%20Scholars">Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars</a> in Washington, D. C., and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. His honorary degrees include doctorates from <a href="Yeshiva%20University">Yeshiva University</a>, <a href="Ben%20Gurion%20University%20of%20the%20Negev">Ben Gurion University of the Negev</a>, <a href="Bar%20Ilan%20University">Bar Ilan University</a>, <a href="Brandeis%20University">Brandeis University</a>, and <a href="Florida%20International%20University">Florida International University</a>. Steinsaltz is also <a href="Rosh%20Yeshiva">Rosh Yeshiva</a> of <a href="Yeshivat%20Hesder">Yeshivat Hesder</a> <a href="Tekoa%2C%20Gush%20Etzion">Tekoa</a>.

Being a follower of Rabbi <a href="Menachem%20Mendel%20Schneerson">Menachem Mendel Schneerson</a> of <a href="Chabad-Lubavitch">Chabad-Lubavitch</a>, he went to help Jews in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> assisting Chabad's "<a href="Shaliach%20%28Chabad%29">shluchim</a>" (propagators) network. Deeply involved in the future of the Jews in the former Soviet Union, Steinsaltz serves as the region's "Duchovny Ravin" (Spiritual Rabbi), a historic Russian title which indicates that he is the spiritual mentor of Russian Jewry. In this capacity, Steinsaltz travelled to Russia and the Republics once each month from his home in Jerusalem. During his time in the former Soviet Union, he founded the Jewish University, both in Moscow and <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. The Jewish University is the first degree-granting institution of Jewish studies in the former <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>.

Steinsaltz has taken a cautious approach to interfaith dialogues. During a visit of a delegation of Roman Catholic <a href="Cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29">cardinals</a> in Manhattan in January 2004, he said that, "You do not have to raise over-expectations of a meeting, as it doesn't signify in itself a breakthrough; however, the opportunity for cardinals and rabbis to speak face to face is valuable. It's part of a process in which we can talk to each other in a friendly way", and called for "a theological dialogue that asks the tough questions, such as whether Catholicism allows for Jews to enter eternal paradise".

Steinsaltz and his wife live in Jerusalem, and have three children and more than ten grandchildren. His son, Rabbi Menachem Even-Israel, is the Executive Director of Shefa - Rabbi Steinsaltz's umbrella organization, located in the Steinsaltz Center in the Nachlaot neighborhood of Jerusalem.

Rabbi Steinsaltz accepted the position as Nasi (President) of the <a href="2004%20attempt%20to%20revive%20the%20Sanhedrin">2004 attempt to revive the Sanhedrin</a>. In 2008, he resigned from this position due to differences of opinion.

Steinsaltz is a popular University and radio commentator. He has been invited to speak at the <a href="Aspen%20Institute%20for%20Humanistic%20Studies">Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies</a> at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> in 1979. In Jerusalem, he gives evening seminars, which, according to Newsweek, usually last till 2 in the morning, and have attracted prominent politicians, such as the former Prime Minister <a href="Levi%20Eshkol">Levi Eshkol</a> and former <a href="Finance%20Minister">Finance Minister</a> <a href="Pinhas%20Sapir">Pinhas Sapir</a>.

Rabbi Steinsaltz has received many awards and prizes, among them the <a href="Israel%20Prize">Israel Prize</a> for Jewish studies in 1988.

On 9 February 2012, Steinsaltz was honored by Israeli President Shimon Peres with Israel's first President's Prize for his scholarship in Talmud.

The <a href="Jewish%20Book%20Council">Jewish Book Council</a> named the Koren Talmud Bavli with commentary, translation, and notes by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, a 2012 National Jewish Book Award winner in the category of Modern Jewish Thought and Experience.

<a href="Jacob%20Neusner">Jacob Neusner</a>'s "How Adin Steinsaltz Misrepresents the Talmud. Four False Propositions from his "Reference Guide"" (1998) displays strong disagreement.

Talmudic researcher and lecturer <a href="Aharon%20Feldman">Aharon Feldman</a> penned a lengthy critical review of the Steinsaltz Talmud. Among many criticisms, he writes, "Specifically, the work is marred by an extraordinary number of inaccuracies stemming primarily from misreadings of the sources; it fails to explain those difficult passages which the reader would expect it to explain; and it confuses him with notes which are often irrelevant, incomprehensible, and contradictory." Feldman says he fears that, "An intelligent student utilizing the Steinsaltz Talmud as his personal instructor might in fact conclude that Talmud in general is not supposed to make sense." Furthermore, writes Feldman, the Steinsaltz Talmud gives off the impression that the Talmud is intellectually flabby, inconsistent, and often trivial.

Steinsaltzs' works aroused fierce opposition in parts of the Orthodox Jewish world, with many leading rabbis such as <a href="Elazar%20Shach">Elazar Shach</a>, <a href="Yosef%20Shalom%20Eliashiv">Yosef Shalom Eliashiv</a>, and <a href="Eliezer%20Waldenberg">Eliezer Waldenberg</a> harshly condemning his Talmud and other books.

Waldenberg further wrote that the Steinsaltz Talmud had the power to "poision the souls" of those who read it. <a href="Mordechai%20Gifter">Mordechai Gifter</a> delivered a pointed lecture on the subject, criticizing Steinsaltz and his defenders in strong terms.

A. E. Housman

Alfred Edward Housman (; 26 March 1859 – 30 April 1936), usually known as A. E. Housman, was an English <a href="classics">classical scholar</a> and poet, best known to the general public for his cycle of poems "<a href="A%20Shropshire%20Lad">A Shropshire Lad</a>". Lyrical and almost <a href="epigram">epigram</a>matic in form, the poems wistfully evoke the dooms and disappointments of youth in the English countryside. Their beauty, simplicity and distinctive imagery appealed strongly to late <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> and <a href="Edwardian%20period">Edwardian</a> taste, and to many early 20th-century English composers both before and after the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. Through their song-settings, the poems became closely associated with that era, and with <a href="Shropshire">Shropshire</a> itself.

Housman was one of the foremost classicists of his age and has been ranked as one of the greatest scholars who ever lived. He established his reputation publishing as a <a href="private%20scholar">private scholar</a> and, on the strength and quality of his work, was appointed Professor of Latin at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a> and then at <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. His editions of <a href="Juvenal">Juvenal</a>, <a href="Marcus%20Manilius">Manilius</a> and <a href="Marcus%20Annaeus%20Lucanus">Lucan</a> are still considered authoritative.

The eldest of seven children, Housman was born at Valley House in Fockbury, a hamlet on the outskirts of <a href="Bromsgrove">Bromsgrove</a> in Worcestershire, to Sarah Jane (née Williams, married 17 June 1858 in <a href="Woodchester">Woodchester</a>, Gloucester) and Edward Housman (whose family came from <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Lancashire">Lancaster</a>), and was baptised on 24 April 1859 at Christ Church, in <a href="Catshill">Catshill</a>. His mother died on his twelfth birthday, and his father, a country solicitor, remarried, to an elder cousin, Lucy, in 1873. Housman's brother <a href="Laurence%20Housman">Laurence Housman</a> and their sister <a href="Clemence%20Housman">Clemence Housman</a> also became writers.

Housman was educated at <a href="King%20Edward%27s%20School%2C%20Birmingham">King Edward's School</a> in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> and later <a href="Bromsgrove%20School">Bromsgrove School</a>, where he revealed his academic promise and won prizes for his poems. In 1877 he won an open scholarship to <a href="St%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford">St John's College, Oxford</a>, where he studied <a href="classics">classics</a>. Although <a href="introversion">introverted</a> by nature, Housman formed strong friendships with two roommates, Moses John Jackson (1858 – January 14, 1923) and <a href="Alfred%20W.%20Pollard">A. W. Pollard</a>. Jackson became the great love of Housman's life, but he was heterosexual and did not reciprocate Housman's feelings. Housman became an atheist while attending Oxford. Housman obtained a first in classical Moderations in 1879, but his dedication to textual analysis, particularly of <a href="Propertius">Propertius</a>, led him to neglect the ancient history and philosophy that formed part of the <a href="Literae%20Humaniores">Greats</a> curriculum. Accordingly, he failed to obtain a degree. Though some attribute Housman's unexpected failure in his final exams directly to his rejection by Jackson, most biographers adduce more obvious causes. Housman was indifferent to philosophy and overconfident in his exceptional gifts; he felt contempt for inexact scholarship; and he enjoyed idling away his time with Jackson and others. He may also have been distracted by news of his father's desperate illness. He felt deeply humiliated by his failure and became determined to vindicate his genius.
After Oxford, Jackson got a job as a <a href="patent%20examiner">clerk</a> in the <a href="Patent%20Office">Patent Office</a> in London and arranged a job there for Housman too. The two shared a flat with Jackson's brother Adalbert until 1885, when Housman moved to lodgings of his own, probably after Jackson responded to a declaration of love by telling Housman that he could not reciprocate his feelings. Moses Jackson moved to India in 1887, placing more distance between himself and Housman. When Jackson returned briefly to England in 1889, to marry, Housman was not invited to the wedding and knew nothing about it until the couple had left the country. Adalbert Jackson died in 1892 and Housman commemorated him in a poem published as "XLII – A.J.J." of "<a href="More%20Poems">More Poems</a>" (1936).

Meanwhile, Housman pursued his classical studies independently, and published scholarly articles on such authors as <a href="Horace">Horace</a>, <a href="Propertius">Propertius</a>, <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>, <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>, <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a> and <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a>. He gradually acquired such a high reputation that in 1892 he was offered and accepted the professorship of Latin at <a href="University%20College%20London">University College London</a> (UCL).

When <a href="Raymond%20Wilson%20Chambers">R. W. Chambers</a> discovered an immensely rare original <a href="Coverdale%20Bible">Coverdale Bible</a> of 1535 in the UCL library he presented it to the Library Committee, where Housman remarked that it would be better to sell it to "buy some really useful books with the proceeds". From 1947, UCL's academic common room was dedicated to his memory as the Housman Room.

In his private life Housman enjoyed <a href="gastronomy">gastronomy</a>, flying in aeroplanes and making frequent visits to France, where he read "books which were banned in Britain as pornographic". <a href="A.%20C.%20Benson">A. C. Benson</a>, a fellow don, described him as being "descended from a long line of maiden aunts".

Although Housman's early work and his responsibilities as a professor included both <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, he began to specialise in Latin poetry. When asked later why he had stopped writing about Greek verse, he responded, "I found that I could not attain to excellence in both."

In 1911 he took the <a href="Kennedy%20Professorship%20of%20Latin">Kennedy Professorship of Latin</a> at <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, where he remained for the rest of his life. G. P. Goold, Classics Professor at University College, wrote of Housman's accomplishments: "The legacy of Housman's scholarship is a thing of permanent value; and that value consists less in obvious results, the establishment of general propositions about Latin and the removal of scribal mistakes, than in the shining example he provides of a wonderful mind at work. … He was and may remain the last great textual critic." Between 1903 and 1930 Housman published his critical edition of <a href="Marcus%20Manilius">Manilius's</a> "Astronomicon" in five volumes. He also edited works by <a href="Satires%20of%20Juvenal">Juvenal</a> (1905) and <a href="Marcus%20Annaeus%20Lucanus">Lucan</a> (1926). Many colleagues were unnerved by his scathing attacks on those he thought guilty of shoddy scholarship. In his paper "The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism" (1921) Housman wrote: "A textual critic engaged upon his business is not at all like Newton investigating the motion of the planets: he is much more like a dog hunting for fleas." He declared many of his contemporary scholars to be stupid, lazy, vain, or all three, saying: "Knowledge is good, method is good, but one thing beyond all others is necessary; and that is to have a head, not a pumpkin, on your shoulders, and brains, not pudding, in your head." 

His younger colleague <a href="A.%20S.%20F.%20Gow">A. S. F. Gow</a> quoted examples of these attacks, noting that they "were often savage in the extreme". Gow also related how Housman intimidated his students, sometimes reducing them to tears. According to Gow, Housman could never remember his students' names, maintaining that "had he burdened his memory by the distinction between Miss Jones and Miss Robinson, he might have forgotten that between the second and fourth declension". One notable pupil was <a href="Enoch%20Powell">Enoch Powell</a>. Housman found his true vocation in classical studies and treated his poems as secondary. He did not speak about his poetry in public until 1933 when he gave a lecture, "The Name and Nature of Poetry", in which he argued that poetry should appeal to emotions rather than to the intellect.

Housman died, aged 77, in Cambridge. His ashes are buried just outside <a href="St%20Laurence%27s%20Church%2C%20Ludlow">St Laurence's Church, Ludlow</a>, Shropshire.

During his years in London, A. E. Housman completed "A Shropshire Lad", a cycle of 63 poems. After one publisher had turned it down, he helped subsidise its publication in 1896. At first selling slowly, it rapidly became a lasting success. Its appeal to English musicians had helped to make it widely known before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, when its themes struck a powerful chord with English readers. The book has been in print continuously since May 1896.

The poems are marked by pessimism and preoccupation with death, without religious consolation. Housman wrote many of them while living in <a href="Highgate">Highgate</a>, London, before ever visiting Shropshire, which he presented in an idealised pastoral light as his 'land of lost content'. Housman himself acknowledged that "No doubt I have been unconsciously influenced by the Greeks and Latins, but [the] chief sources of which I am conscious are Shakespeare's songs, the Scottish Border ballads, and <a href="Heinrich%20Heine">Heine</a>."

Housman began writing a new set of poems after the First World War. He was an influence on many British <a href="War%20Poets">poets</a> who became famous by their writing about the war, and wrote several poems as occasional verse to commemorate the war dead. This included his "Epitaph on an Army of Mercenaries", honouring the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">British Expeditionary Force</a>, an elite but small force of professional soldiers, 'a rapier amongst scythes' sent to Belgium at the start of the war. Fighting a well-equipped and much larger German army, they suffered heavy losses.

In the early 1920s, when Moses Jackson was dying in Canada, Housman wanted to assemble his best unpublished poems so that Jackson could read them before his death. These later poems, mostly written before 1910, show a greater variety of subject and form than those in "A Shropshire Lad" but lack the consistency of his previously published work. He published them as "<a href="Last%20Poems">Last Poems</a>" (1922), feeling that his inspiration was exhausted and that he should not publish more in his lifetime. After his death Housman's brother, <a href="Laurence%20Housman">Laurence</a>, published further poems in "More Poems" (1936), "A. E .H.: Some Poems, Some Letters and a Personal Memoir by his Brother" (1937), and "Collected Poems" (1939). "A. E. H." includes humorous verse such as a parody of <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Longfellow's</a> poem <a href="Excelsior%20%28Longfellow%29">"Excelsior"</a>. Housman also wrote a parodic "Fragment of a Greek Tragedy", in English, published posthumously with humorous poems under the title "Unkind to Unicorns".

<a href="John%20Hanbury%20Angus%20Sparrow">John Sparrow</a> quoted a letter written late in Housman's life that described the genesis of his poems:
Sparrow himself adds, "How difficult it is to achieve a satisfactory analysis may be judged by considering the last poem in "A Shropshire Lad". Of its four stanzas, Housman tells us that two were 'given' him ready made; one was coaxed forth from his subconsciousness an hour or two later; the remaining one took months of conscious composition. No one can tell for certain which was which."

In 1942 Laurence Housman also deposited an essay entitled "A. E. Housman's 'De Amicitia'" in the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>, with the proviso that it was not to be published for 25 years. The essay discussed A. E. Housman's homosexuality and his love for Moses Jackson. Despite the conservative nature of the times and his own caution in public life, Housman was quite open in his poetry, and especially in "A Shropshire Lad", about his deeper sympathies. Poem XXX of that sequence, for instance, speaks of how "Fear contended with desire": "Others, I am not the first, / Have willed more mischief than they durst". In "More Poems", he buries his love for Moses Jackson in the very act of commemorating it, as his feelings of love are not reciprocated and must be carried unfulfilled to the grave:

<poem>

</poem>

His poem "Oh who is that young sinner with the handcuffs on his wrists?", written after the trial of <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>, addressed more general attitudes towards homosexuals. In the poem the prisoner is suffering "for the colour of his hair", a natural quality that, in a coded reference to homosexuality, is reviled as "nameless and abominable" (recalling the legal phrase "peccatum illud horribile, inter Christianos non nominandum", "that horrible sin, not to be named amongst Christians").

Housman's poetry, especially "A Shropshire Lad", was set to music by many British, and in particular English, composers in the first half of the 20th century. The national, pastoral and traditional elements of his style resonated with similar trends in English music. In 1904 the cycle "A Shropshire Lad" was set by <a href="Arthur%20Somervell">Arthur Somervell</a>, who had begun to develop the concept of the English <a href="song-cycle">song-cycle</a> in his version of <a href="Alfred%20Tennyson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Tennyson">Tennyson</a>'s "<a href="Maud%20and%20other%20poems">Maud</a>" a little previously. <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a> produced his well-known settings of six songs, the cycle "<a href="On%20Wenlock%20Edge%20%28song%20cycle%29">On Wenlock Edge</a>", for <a href="string%20quartet">string quartet</a>, <a href="tenor">tenor</a> and piano in 1909. Between 1909 and 1911 <a href="George%20Butterworth">George Butterworth</a> produced settings in two collections, "<a href="Six%20Songs%20from%20A%20Shropshire%20Lad">Six Songs from A Shropshire Lad</a>" and "<a href="Bredon%20Hill%20and%20Other%20Songs">Bredon Hill and Other Songs</a>". He also wrote the orchestral <a href="tone%20poem">tone poem</a> "A Shropshire Lad", first performed at <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a> Festival in 1912.

<a href="Ivor%20Gurney">Ivor Gurney</a> was another composer who made renowned settings of Housman's poems. Towards the end of <a href="World%20War%201">World War 1</a> he was working on his cycle "Ludlow and Teme", for voice and string quartet (published in 1919), and went on to compose the eight-song cycle "The Western Playland" in 1921. One more who set Housman songs at this period was <a href="John%20Ireland%20%28composer%29">John Ireland</a> in the song cycle, "<a href="The%20Land%20of%20Lost%20Content%20%28John%20Ireland%29">The Land of Lost Content</a>" (192021). Even composers not directly associated with the 'pastoral' tradition, such as <a href="Arnold%20Bax">Arnold Bax</a>, <a href="Lennox%20Berkeley">Lennox Berkeley</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Bliss">Arthur Bliss</a>, were attracted to Housman's poetry. A 1976 catalogue listed 400 musical settings of Housman's poems. As of 2016, Lieder Net Archive records 606 settings of 187 texts.

The earliest commemoration of Housman was in his college chapel in Cambridge, where there is a memorial brass on the south wall. The Latin inscription was composed by his colleague there, <a href="A.S.F.%20Gow">A.S.F. Gow</a>, who was also the author of a biographical and bibliographical sketch published immediately following his death. Translated into English, the memorial reads:

<a href="Blue%20plaque">Blue plaque</a>s followed later, the first being on Byron Cottage in Highgate in 1969, recording the fact that "A Shropshire Lad" was written there. More followed on his Worcestershire birthplace, his homes and school in Bromsgrove. The latter were encouraged by the Housman Society, which was founded in the town in 1973. Another initiative was the statue in Bromsgrove High Street, showing the poet striding with walking stick in hand. The work of local sculptor Kenneth Potts, it was unveiled on 22 March 1985.

The blue plaques in Worcestershire were set up on the centenary of "A Shropshire Lad" in 1996. In September of the same year a memorial window lozenge was dedicated at <a href="Poets%27%20Corner">Poets' Corner</a> in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> The following year saw the première of <a href="Tom%20Stoppard">Tom Stoppard</a>'s play "<a href="The%20Invention%20of%20Love">The Invention of Love</a>", whose subject is the relationship between Housman and Moses Jackson.

As the 150th anniversary of his birth approached, <a href="London%20University">London University</a> inaugurated its Housman lectures on classical subjects in 2005, initially given every second year then annually after 2011. The anniversary itself in 2009 saw the launch of a new edition of "A Shropshire Lad", including pictures from across Shropshire taken by local photographer Gareth Thomas. Among other events, there were performances of Vaughan Williams' "On Wenlock Edge" and Gurney's "Ludlow and Teme" at St Laurence's Church in Ludlow.

Attribution of recent climate change

Attribution of recent climate change is the effort to scientifically ascertain mechanisms responsible for recent <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>s on <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, commonly known as '<a href="global%20warming">global warming</a>'. The effort has focused on changes observed during the period of <a href="instrumental%20temperature%20record">instrumental temperature record</a>, when records are most reliable; particularly in the last 50 years, when human activity has grown fastest and observations of the <a href="troposphere">troposphere</a> have become available. The dominant mechanisms are anthropogenic, i.e., the <a href="Global%20warming">result of human activity</a>. They are:

There are also natural mechanisms for variation including <a href="climate%20oscillation">climate oscillation</a>s, changes in <a href="Solar%20activity%20and%20climate">solar activity</a>, and <a href="volcano">volcanic</a> activity.

According to the <a href="Intergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPCC), it is "extremely likely" that human influence was the dominant cause of global warming between 1951 and 2010. The IPCC defines "extremely likely" as indicating a probability of 95 to 100%, based on an expert assessment of all the available evidence.

Multiple lines of evidence support attribution of recent climate change to human activities:

The IPCC's attribution of recent global warming to human activities is a view shared by the scientific community, and is also supported by 196 other scientific organizations worldwide (see also: <a href="scientific%20opinion%20on%20climate%20change">scientific opinion on climate change</a>).

This section introduces some concepts in <a href="climatology">climatology</a> that are used in the following sections:

Factors affecting <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s climate can be broken down into <a href="Global%20warming%23Feedback">feedbacks</a> and forcings. A forcing is something that is imposed externally on the climate system. External forcings include natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions and variations in the sun's output. Human activities can also impose forcings, for example, through changing the composition of the atmosphere.

<a href="Radiative%20forcing">Radiative forcing</a> is a measure of how various factors alter the <a href="First%20law%20of%20thermodynamics">energy balance</a> of the <a href="Atmosphere%20of%20Earth">Earth's atmosphere</a>. A positive radiative forcing will tend to increase the energy of the Earth-atmosphere system, leading to a warming of the system. Between the start of the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> in 1750, and the year 2005, the increase in the atmospheric concentration of <a href="Carbon%20dioxide%20in%20Earth%27s%20atmosphere">carbon dioxide</a> (<a href="chemical%20formula">chemical formula</a>: CO) led to a positive radiative forcing, averaged over the Earth's <a href="surface%20area">surface area</a>, of about 1.66 <a href="watt">watt</a>s per square metre (abbreviated W m).

Climate feedbacks can either amplify or dampen the response of the climate to a given forcing.
There are many feedback mechanisms in the climate system that can either amplify (a <a href="positive%20feedback">positive feedback</a>) or diminish (a <a href="negative%20feedback">negative feedback</a>) the effects of a change in climate forcing.

Aspects of the climate system will show variation in response to changes in forcings.
In the absence of forcings imposed on it, the climate system will still show internal variability (see images opposite). This internal variability is a result of complex interactions between components of the climate system, such as the <a href="coupling%20%28physics%29">coupling</a> between the atmosphere and <a href="ocean">ocean</a> (see also the later section on <a href="Attribution%20of%20recent%20climate%20change%23Internal%20climate%20variability%20and%20global%20warming">Internal climate variability and global warming</a>). An example of internal variability is the <a href="El%20Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern%20Oscillation">El Niño–Southern Oscillation</a>.

Detection and attribution of climate signals, as well as its common-sense meaning, has a more precise definition within the climate change literature, as expressed by the IPCC. Detection of a climate signal does not always imply significant attribution. The IPCC's <a href="IPCC%20Fourth%20Assessment%20Report">Fourth Assessment Report</a> says "it is "extremely likely" that human activities have exerted a substantial net warming influence on climate since 1750," where "extremely likely" indicates a probability greater than 95%. "Detection" of a signal requires demonstrating that an observed change is <a href="Statistical%20significance">statistically significantly</a> different from that which can be explained by natural internal variability.

"Attribution" requires demonstrating that a signal is:

<a href="Carbon%20dioxide">Carbon dioxide</a> is the primary <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a> that is contributing to recent climate change. is absorbed and emitted naturally as part of the <a href="carbon%20cycle">carbon cycle</a>, through animal and plant <a href="respiratory%20system">respiration</a>, <a href="Volcano">volcanic eruptions</a>, and ocean-atmosphere exchange. Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use (see below), release large amounts of carbon to the atmosphere, causing concentrations in the atmosphere to rise.

The high-accuracy measurements of atmospheric CO concentration, initiated by <a href="Charles%20David%20Keeling">Charles David Keeling</a> in 1958, constitute the master time series documenting the changing composition of the <a href="Atmosphere%20of%20Earth">atmosphere</a>. These data have iconic status in climate change science as evidence of the effect of human activities on the chemical composition of the global atmosphere.

Along with CO, <a href="methane">methane</a> and <a href="nitrous%20oxide">nitrous oxide</a> are also major forcing contributors to the <a href="greenhouse%20effect">greenhouse effect</a>. The <a href="Kyoto%20Protocol">Kyoto Protocol</a> lists these together with <a href="hydrofluorocarbon">hydrofluorocarbon</a> (HFCs), <a href="Fluorocarbon">perfluorocarbons</a> (PFCs), and <a href="sulfur%20hexafluoride">sulfur hexafluoride</a> (SF), which are entirely artificial (i.e. anthropogenic) gases, which also contribute to radiative forcing in the atmosphere. The chart at right attributes anthropogenic greenhouse gas <a href="Air%20pollution">emissions</a> to eight main economic sectors, of which the largest contributors are <a href="Power%20station">power stations</a> (many of which burn <a href="coal">coal</a> or other <a href="fossil%20fuel">fossil fuel</a>s), <a href="industry">industrial</a> processes, <a href="Transport">transportation</a> <a href="fuel">fuel</a>s (generally <a href="fossil%20fuel">fossil fuel</a>s), and <a href="agriculture">agricultural</a> by-products (mainly methane from <a href="enteric%20fermentation">enteric fermentation</a> and nitrous oxide from <a href="fertilizer">fertilizer</a> use).

Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas and also the most important in terms of its contribution to the natural greenhouse effect, despite having a short atmospheric lifetime (about 10 days). Some human activities can influence local water vapor levels. However, on a global scale, the concentration of water vapor is controlled by temperature, which influences overall rates of <a href="evaporation">evaporation</a> and <a href="precipitation">precipitation</a>. Therefore, the global concentration of water vapor is not substantially affected by direct human emissions.

Climate change is attributed to <a href="land%20use">land use</a> for two main reasons. Between 1750 and 2007, about two-thirds of anthropogenic <a href="carbon%20dioxide"></a> emissions were produced from burning fossil fuels, and about one-third of emissions from changes in land use, primarily <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>. Deforestation both reduces the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by deforested regions and releases greenhouse gases directly, together with aerosols, through <a href="slash%20and%20burn">biomass burning</a> that frequently accompanies it.

A second reason that climate change has been attributed to land use is that the <a href="albedo">terrestrial albedo</a> is often altered by use, which leads to <a href="radiative%20forcing">radiative forcing</a>. This effect is more significant locally than globally.

Worldwide, livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the ice-free land surface of the Earth.
More than 18% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to livestock and livestock-related activities such as deforestation and increasingly fuel-intensive farming practices. Specific attributions to the livestock sector include:

With virtual certainty, scientific consensus has attributed various forms of climate change, chiefly cooling effects, to <a href="aerosol">aerosol</a>s, which are small particles or droplets suspended in the atmosphere.
Key sources to which anthropogenic aerosols are attributed include:

Over the past 150 years human activities have released increasing quantities of <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a>es into the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">atmosphere</a>. This has led to increases in mean global temperature, or <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a>. Other human effects are relevant—for example, sulphate <a href="Aerosol">aerosols</a> are believed to have a cooling effect. Natural factors also contribute. According to the <a href="historical%20temperature%20record">historical temperature record</a> of the last century, the Earth's near-surface air temperature has risen around 0.74 <a href="Plus-minus%20sign">±</a> 0.18 °Celsius (1.3 ± 0.32 °Fahrenheit).

A historically important question in climate change research has regarded the relative importance of human activity and non-<a href="human%20impact%20on%20the%20environment">anthropogenic</a> causes during the period of <a href="instrumental%20temperature%20record">instrumental record</a>. In the 1995 <a href="IPCC%20Second%20Assessment%20Report">Second Assessment Report</a> (SAR), the <a href="Intergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change">IPCC</a> made the widely quoted statement that "The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate". The phrase "balance of evidence" suggested the (English) common-law standard of proof required in civil as opposed to criminal courts: not as high as "beyond reasonable doubt". In 2001 the <a href="IPCC%20Third%20Assessment%20Report">Third Assessment Report</a> (TAR) refined this, saying "There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities". The 2007 <a href="IPCC%20Fourth%20Assessment%20Report">Fourth Assessment Report</a> (AR4) strengthened this finding:

Other findings of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report include:

Over the past five decades there has been a global warming of approximately 0.65 °C (1.17 °F) at the Earth's surface (see <a href="historical%20temperature%20record">historical temperature record</a>). Among the possible factors that could produce changes in global mean temperature are internal variability of the climate system, external forcing, an increase in concentration of greenhouse gases, or any combination of these. Current studies indicate that the increase in greenhouse gases, most notably , is mostly responsible for the observed warming. Evidence for this conclusion includes:

Recent scientific assessments find that most of the warming of the Earth's surface over the past 50 years has been caused by human activities (see also the section on <a href="Attribution%20of%20recent%20climate%20change%23Scientific%20literature%20and%20opinion">scientific literature and opinion</a>). This conclusion rests on multiple lines of evidence. Like the warming "signal" that has gradually emerged from the "noise" of natural climate variability, the scientific evidence for a human influence on global climate has accumulated over the past several decades, from many hundreds of studies. No single study is a "<a href="smoking%20gun">smoking gun</a>." Nor has any single study or combination of studies undermined the large body of evidence supporting the conclusion that human activity is the primary driver of recent warming.

The first line of evidence is based on a physical understanding of how greenhouse gases trap heat, how the climate system responds to increases in greenhouse gases, and how other human and natural factors influence climate. The second line of evidence is from indirect estimates of climate changes over the last 1,000 to 2,000 years. These records are obtained from living things and their remains (like <a href="tree%20ring">tree ring</a>s and <a href="coral">coral</a>s) and from physical quantities (like the ratio between lighter and heavier <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s of <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> in <a href="ice%20core">ice core</a>s), which change in measurable ways as climate changes. The lesson from these data is that global surface temperatures over the last several decades are clearly unusual, in that they were higher than at any time during at least the past 400 years. For the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, the recent temperature rise is clearly unusual in at least the last 1,000 years (see graph opposite).

The third line of evidence is based on the broad, qualitative consistency between observed changes in climate and the computer model simulations of how climate would be expected to change in response to human activities. For example, when climate models are run with historical increases in greenhouse gases, they show gradual warming of the Earth and ocean surface, increases in ocean heat content and the temperature of the lower atmosphere, a <a href="current%20sea%20level%20rise">rise</a> in global sea level, retreat of <a href="sea%20ice">sea ice</a> and <a href="snow">snow</a> cover, cooling of the <a href="stratosphere">stratosphere</a>, an increase in the amount of atmospheric water vapor, and changes in large-scale <a href="precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> and <a href="atmospheric%20pressure">pressure patterns</a>. These and other aspects of modelled climate change are in agreement with observations.

Finally, there is extensive <a href="statistical">statistical</a> evidence from so-called "fingerprint" studies. Each factor that affects climate produces a unique pattern of climate response, much as each person has a unique fingerprint. Fingerprint studies exploit these unique signatures, and allow detailed comparisons of modelled and observed climate change patterns. Scientists rely on such studies to attribute observed changes in climate to a particular cause or set of causes. In the real world, the climate changes that have occurred since the start of the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> are due to a complex mixture of human and natural causes. The importance of each individual influence in this mixture changes over time. Of course, there are not multiple Earths, which would allow an experimenter to change one factor at a time on each Earth, thus helping to isolate different fingerprints. Therefore, climate models are used to study how individual factors affect climate. For example, a single factor (like greenhouse gases) or a set of factors can be varied, and the response of the modelled climate system to these individual or combined changes can thus be studied.
For example, when climate model simulations of the last century include all of the major influences on climate, both human-induced and natural, they can reproduce many important features of observed climate change patterns. When human influences are removed from the model experiments, results suggest that the surface of the Earth would actually have cooled slightly over the last 50 years (see graph, opposite). The clear message from fingerprint studies is that the observed warming over the last half-century cannot be explained by natural factors, and is instead caused primarily by human factors.

Another fingerprint of human effects on climate has been identified by looking at a slice through the layers of the atmosphere, and studying the pattern of temperature changes from the surface up through the stratosphere (see the section on <a href="Attribution%20of%20recent%20climate%20change%23Solar%20activity">solar activity</a>). The earliest fingerprint work focused on changes in surface and atmospheric temperature. Scientists then applied fingerprint methods to a whole range of climate variables, identifying human-caused climate signals in the heat content of the oceans, the height of the <a href="tropopause">tropopause</a> (the boundary between the <a href="troposphere">troposphere</a> and <a href="stratosphere">stratosphere</a>, which has shifted upward by hundreds of feet in recent decades), the geographical patterns of precipitation, <a href="drought">drought</a>, surface pressure, and the <a href="surface%20runoff">runoff</a> from major <a href="river%20basin">river basin</a>s.

Studies published after the appearance of the <a href="IPCC%20Fourth%20Assessment%20Report">IPCC Fourth Assessment Report</a> in 2007 have also found human fingerprints in the increased levels of atmospheric <a href="moisture">moisture</a> (both close to the surface and over the full extent of the atmosphere), in the decline of <a href="Arctic%20sea%20ice">Arctic sea ice</a> extent, and in the patterns of changes in <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> and <a href="Antarctic">Antarctic</a> surface temperatures.

The message from this entire body of work is that the climate system is telling a consistent story of increasingly dominant human influence – the changes in temperature, ice extent, moisture, and <a href="Atmospheric%20circulation">circulation</a> patterns fit together in a physically consistent way, like pieces in a complex puzzle.

Increasingly, this type of fingerprint work is shifting its emphasis. As noted, clear and compelling scientific evidence supports the case for a pronounced human influence on global climate. Much of the recent attention is now on climate changes at continental and regional scales, and on variables that can have large impacts on societies. For example, scientists have established causal links between human activities and the changes in <a href="snowpack">snowpack</a>, maximum and minimum (<a href="Diurnal%20temperature%20variation">diurnal</a>) temperature, and the seasonal timing of runoff over <a href="mountain">mountain</a>ous regions of the <a href="western%20United%20States">western United States</a>. Human activity is likely to have made a substantial contribution to ocean surface temperature changes in <a href="hurricane">hurricane</a> formation regions. Researchers are also looking beyond the physical climate system, and are beginning to tie changes in the distribution and seasonal behaviour of plant and animal species to human-caused changes in temperature and precipitation.

For over a decade, one aspect of the climate change story seemed to show a significant difference between models and observations. In the <a href="tropics">tropics</a>, all models predicted that with a rise in greenhouse gases, the troposphere would be expected to warm more rapidly than the surface. Observations from weather balloons, satellites, and surface thermometers seemed to show the opposite behaviour (more rapid warming of the surface than the troposphere). This issue was a stumbling block in understanding the causes of climate change. It is now largely resolved. Research showed that there were large uncertainties in the <a href="satellite">satellite</a> and <a href="weather%20balloon">weather balloon</a> data. When uncertainties in models and observations are properly accounted for, newer observational data sets (with better treatment of known problems) are in agreement with climate model results.

This does not mean, however, that all remaining differences between models and observations have been resolved. The observed changes in some climate variables, such as Arctic sea ice, some aspects of precipitation, and patterns of surface pressure, appear to be proceeding much more rapidly than models have projected. The reasons for these differences are not well understood. Nevertheless, the bottom-line conclusion from climate fingerprinting is that most of the observed changes studied to date are consistent with each other, and are also consistent with our scientific understanding of how the climate system would be expected to respond to the increase in heat-trapping gases resulting from human activities.

One of the subjects discussed in the literature is whether or not extreme weather events can be attributed to human activities. Seneviratne "et al." (2012) stated that attributing individual extreme weather events to human activities was challenging. They were, however, more confident over attributing changes in long-term trends of extreme weather. For example, Seneviratne "et al." (2012) concluded that human activities had likely led to a warming of extreme daily minimum and maximum temperatures at the global scale.

Another way of viewing the problem is to consider the effects of human-induced climate change on the probability of future extreme weather events. Stott "et al." (2003), for example, considered whether or not human activities had increased the risk of severe <a href="heat%20wave">heat wave</a>s in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, like the one <a href="2003%20European%20heat%20wave">experienced in 2003</a>. Their conclusion was that human activities had very likely more than doubled the risk of heat waves of this magnitude.

An analogy can be made between an <a href="sportsperson">athlete</a> on <a href="Doping%20in%20sport">steroid</a>s and human-induced climate change. In the same way that an athlete's performance may increase from using steroids, human-induced climate change increases the risk of some extreme weather events.

Hansen "et al." (2012) suggested that human activities have greatly increased the risk of summertime heat waves. According to their analysis, the land area of the Earth affected by very hot summer temperature anomalies has greatly increased over time (refer to graphs on the left). In the base period 1951-1980, these anomalies covered a few tenths of 1% of the global land area. In recent years, this has increased to around 10% of the global land area. With high confidence, Hansen "et al." (2012) attributed the <a href="2010%20Russian%20heat%20wave">2010 Moscow</a> and <a href="2010%E2%80%9312%20Southern%20United%20States%20drought">2011 Texas heat wave</a>s to human-induced global warming.

An earlier study by Dole "et al." (2011) concluded that the 2010 Moscow heatwave was mostly due to natural weather variability. While not directly citing Dole "et al." (2011), Hansen "et al." (2012) rejected this type of explanation. Hansen "et al." (2012) stated that a combination of natural weather variability and human-induced global warming was responsible for the Moscow and Texas heat waves.

There are a number of examples of published and informal support for the consensus view. As mentioned earlier, the IPCC has concluded that most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is "very likely" due to human activities. The IPCC's conclusions are consistent with those of several reports produced by the <a href="US%20National%20Research%20Council">US National Research Council</a>.
A report published in 2009 by the <a href="U.S.%20Global%20Change%20Research%20Program">U.S. Global Change Research Program</a> concluded that "[global] warming is unequivocal and primarily human-induced."
A number of scientific organizations have issued statements that support the consensus view. Two examples include:

The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (2007), concluded that attribution was possible for a number of observed changes in the climate (see <a href="effects%20of%20global%20warming">effects of global warming</a>). However, attribution was found to be more difficult when assessing changes over smaller regions (less than continental scale) and over short time periods (less than 50 years).
Over larger regions, averaging reduces natural variability of the climate, making detection and attribution easier.



As described above, a small minority of scientists do disagree with the consensus: see <a href="list%20of%20scientists%20opposing%20global%20warming%20consensus">list of scientists opposing global warming consensus</a>. For example, <a href="Willie%20Soon">Willie Soon</a> and <a href="Richard%20Lindzen">Richard Lindzen</a> say that there is insufficient proof for anthropogenic attribution. Generally this position requires new physical mechanisms to explain the observed warming.

Solar sunspot maximum occurs when the magnetic field of the sun collapses and reverse as part of its average 11 year <a href="solar%20cycle">solar cycle</a> (22 years for complete North to North restoration).

The role of the sun in recent climate change has been looked at by climate scientists. Since 1978, <a href="solar%20variation">output from the Sun</a> has been measured by <a href="satellite">satellite</a>s significantly more accurately than was previously possible from the surface. These measurements indicate that the Sun's total <a href="solar%20irradiance">solar irradiance</a> has not increased since 1978, so the warming during the past 30 years cannot be directly attributed to an increase in total solar energy reaching the Earth (see graph above, left). In the three decades since 1978, the combination of solar and <a href="volcanic%20activity">volcanic activity</a> probably had a slight cooling influence on the climate.

Climate models have been used to examine the role of the sun in recent climate change.
Models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when they only take into account variations in total solar irradiance and volcanic activity. Models are, however, able to simulate the observed 20th century changes in temperature when they include all of the most important external forcings, including human influences and natural forcings. As has already been stated, Hegerl "et al." (2007) concluded that greenhouse gas forcing had "very likely" caused most of the observed global warming since the mid-20th century. In making this conclusion, Hegerl "et al." (2007) allowed for the possibility that climate models had been underestimated the effect of solar forcing.

The role of solar activity in climate change has also been calculated over <a href="paleoclimatology">longer time periods</a> using "proxy" datasets, such as <a href="tree%20rings">tree rings</a>.
Models indicate that solar and volcanic forcings can explain periods of relative warmth and cold between <a href="Anno%20Domini">A.D.</a> 1000 and 1900, but human-induced forcings are needed to reproduce the late-20th century warming.

Another line of evidence against the sun having caused recent climate change comes from looking at how temperatures at different levels in the Earth's atmosphere have changed.
Models and observations (see figure above, middle) show that greenhouse gas results in warming of the lower atmosphere at the surface (called the <a href="troposphere">troposphere</a>) but cooling of the upper atmosphere (called the <a href="stratosphere">stratosphere</a>). <a href="ozone%20depletion">Depletion</a> of the <a href="ozone%20layer">ozone layer</a> by chemical <a href="refrigerant">refrigerant</a>s has also resulted in a cooling effect in the stratosphere. If the sun was responsible for observed warming, warming of the troposphere at the surface and warming at the top of the stratosphere would be expected as increase solar activity would replenish ozone and oxides of nitrogen. The stratosphere has a reverse temperature gradient than the troposphere so as the temperature of the troposphere cools with altitude, the stratosphere rises with altitude. <a href="Hadley%20cells">Hadley cells</a> are the mechanism by which equatorial generated ozone in the tropics (highest area of UV irradiance in the stratosphere) is moved poleward. Global climate models suggest that climate change may widen the Hadley cells and push the jetstream northward thereby expanding the tropics region and resulting in warmer, dryer conditions in those areas overall.

<a href="Habibullo%20Abdussamatov">Habibullo Abdussamatov</a> (2004), head of space research at St. Petersburg's <a href="Pulkovo%20Observatory">Pulkovo Astronomical Observatory</a> in <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, has argued that the sun is responsible for recently observed climate change. <a href="Journalist">Journalist</a>s for <a href="news">news</a> sources <a href="canada.com">canada.com</a> (Solomon, 2007b), <a href="National%20Geographic%20News">National Geographic News</a> (Ravillious, 2007), and <a href="LiveScience">LiveScience</a> (Than, 2007) reported on the story of warming on <a href="Mars">Mars</a>. In these articles, Abdussamatov was quoted. He stated that warming on Mars was evidence that global warming on Earth was being caused by changes in the sun.

Ravillious (2007) quoted two scientists who disagreed with Abdussamatov: Amato Evan, a climate scientist at the <a href="University%20of%20Wisconsin-Madison">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>, in the <a href="United%20States">US</a>, and Colin Wilson, a <a href="planetary%20science">planetary physicist</a> at <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">UK</a>. According to Wilson, "Wobbles in the orbit of Mars are the main cause of its climate change in the current era" (see also <a href="orbital%20forcing">orbital forcing</a>). Than (2007) quoted Charles Long, a climate physicist at <a href="Pacific%20Northwest%20National%20Laboratory">Pacific Northwest National Laboratories</a> in the US, who disagreed with Abdussamatov.

Than (2007) pointed to the view of <a href="Benny%20Peiser">Benny Peiser</a>, a <a href="social%20anthropologist">social anthropologist</a> at <a href="Liverpool%20John%20Moores%20University">Liverpool John Moores University</a> in the UK. In his <a href="newsletter">newsletter</a>, Peiser had cited a <a href="blog">blog</a> that had commented on warming observed on several planetary bodies in the <a href="Solar%20system">Solar system</a>. These included <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a>'s moon <a href="Triton%20%28moon%29">Triton</a>, <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, <a href="Pluto">Pluto</a> and Mars. In an e-mail interview with Than (2007), Peiser stated that:"I think it is an intriguing coincidence that warming trends have been observed on a number of very diverse planetary bodies in our solar system, (...) Perhaps this is just a fluke."Than (2007) provided alternative explanations of why warming had occurred on Triton, Pluto, Jupiter and Mars.

The <a href="US%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">US Environmental Protection Agency</a> (US EPA, 2009) responded to public comments on climate change attribution. A number of commenters had argued that recent climate change could be attributed to changes in solar irradiance. According to the US EPA (2009), this attribution was not supported by the bulk of the <a href="scientific%20literature">scientific literature</a>. Citing the work of the IPCC (2007), the US EPA pointed to the low contribution of solar irradiance to radiative forcing since the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1750. Over this time period (1750 to 2005), the estimated contribution of solar irradiance to radiative forcing was 5% the value of the combined radiative forcing due to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide (see graph opposite).

<a href="Henrik%20Svensmark">Henrik Svensmark</a> has suggested that the <a href="magnetic">magnetic</a> activity of the sun deflects <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a>s, and that this may influence the generation of <a href="cloud%20condensation%20nuclei">cloud condensation nuclei</a>, and thereby have an effect on the climate. The website <a href="ScienceDaily">ScienceDaily</a> reported on a 2009 study that looked at how past changes in climate have been affected by the Earth's magnetic field. Geophysicist Mads Faurschou Knudsen, who co-authored the study, stated that the study's results supported Svensmark's theory. The authors of the study also acknowledged that plays an important role in climate change.

The view that cosmic rays could provide the mechanism by which changes in solar activity affect climate is not supported by the literature. Solomon "et al." (2007) state:[..] the cosmic ray time series does not appear to correspond to global total cloud cover after 1991 or to global low-level cloud cover after 1994. Together with the lack of a proven physical mechanism and the plausibility of other causal factors affecting changes in cloud cover, this makes the association between galactic cosmic ray-induced changes in aerosol and cloud formation controversial

Studies by Lockwood and Fröhlich (2007) and Sloan and Wolfendale (2008) found no relation between warming in recent decades and cosmic rays. Pierce and Adams (2009) used a model to simulate the effect of cosmic rays on cloud properties. They concluded that the hypothesized effect of cosmic rays was too small to explain recent climate change. Pierce and Adams (2009) noted that their findings did not rule out a possible connection between cosmic rays and climate change, and recommended further research.

Erlykin "et al." (2009) found that the evidence showed that connections between solar variation and climate were more likely to be mediated by direct variation of insolation rather than cosmic rays, and concluded: "Hence within our assumptions, the effect of varying solar activity, either by direct solar irradiance or by varying cosmic ray rates, must be less than 0.07 °C since 1956, i.e. less than 14% of the observed global warming." Carslaw (2009) and Pittock (2009) review the recent and historical literature in this field and continue to find that the link between cosmic rays and climate is tenuous, though they encourage continued research. US EPA (2009) commented on research by Duplissy "et al." (2009):The CLOUD experiments at <a href="CERN">CERN</a> are interesting research but do not provide conclusive evidence that cosmic rays can serve as a major source of cloud seeding. Preliminary results from the experiment (Duplissy et al., 2009) suggest that though there was some evidence of ion mediated nucleation, for most of the nucleation events observed the contribution of ion processes appeared to be minor. These experiments also showed the difficulty in maintaining sufficiently clean conditions and stable temperatures to prevent spurious aerosol bursts. There is no indication that the earlier Svensmark experiments could even have matched the controlled conditions of the CERN experiment. We find that the Svensmark results on cloud seeding have not yet been shown to be robust or sufficient to materially alter the conclusions of the assessment literature, especially given the abundance of recent literature that is skeptical of the cosmic ray-climate linkage

Achiltibuie (; or "Field of the yellow-haired boy") is a long <a href="linear%20village">linear village</a> in <a href="Ross%20and%20Cromarty">Ross and Cromarty</a>, <a href="Highland%20%28council%20area%29">Highland</a>, on the <a href="Coigach">Coigach</a> coast of northwestern <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, overlooking <a href="Badentarbet%20Bay">Badentarbet Bay</a> to the west. <a href="Loch%20Broom">Loch Broom</a> and the <a href="Summer%20Isles">Summer Isles</a> lie to the south. Located 10 miles (16 km) northwest of <a href="Ullapool">Ullapool</a> as the crow flies. Achiltibuie is the central community of a series of townships and communities stretching from Culnacraig, through Badenscallie and <a href="Polglass">Polglass</a> (where the community hall, the primary school and the Piping School are located), <a href="Polbain">Polbain</a>, and <a href="Reiff%2C%20Ross-shire">Reiff</a> to <a href="Achnahaird">Achnahaird</a>.

The first <a href="post%20office">post office</a> in the village opened on 28 July 1884.

For a time the "Summer Isles Smokehouse" attracted visitors. In 2013 the community had hopes to re-establish the business.

The Hydroponicum, a facility for growing fresh fruit and vegetables indoors using <a href="hydroponics">hydroponics</a>, was built in the village in the 1980s by Robert Irvine, then owner of the Summer Isles Hotel. The Hydroponicum was known for growing exotic fruit such as bananas all year round. It attracted up to 10,000 visitors a year until it was sold in 2007 to a company based in the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>. New greenhouses have since been built apart from the original hydroponicum buildings, and the new owners continue to grow fruit and vegetables for local businesses and residents. A community buyout attempt in 2011 by the Coigach Community Development Company fell through when the site's sellers pulled out. The building has now been demolished. Some of the former staff of the Hydroponicum run a small-scale activity known as The Achiltibuie Garden, situated nearby.


'Coigach Community Rowing' the crew members of which coastal rowing club are all local, won the World <a href="St.%20Ayles%20Skiff">St. Ayles Skiff</a> Rowing Championships in July 2013 and a mixed crew from the club won the Alan Spong Trophy for 1st Mixed crew 4-oar rowing at the Thames Great River Race in September 2013. Coigach Community Rowing hand-built their two St Ayles rowing skiffs, the 'Coigach Lass' and the 'Lily~Rose' and race under the auspices of the Scottish Coastal Rowing Association, which is the governing body of St Ayles class coastal rowing around the world.
The Roman epic <a href="The%20Eagle%20%282011%20film%29">The Eagle</a>, based on the 1954 novel "<a href="The%20Eagle%20of%20the%20Ninth">The Eagle of the Ninth</a>" by <a href="Rosemary%20Sutcliffe">Rosemary Sutcliff</a>, was filmed on location in Achiltibuie for a week in October 2009. The main location was Fox Point, Old Dornie. The <a href="Pictish">Pictish</a> village which was constructed at Fox Point was used on most days of the filming. Other sites included Achnahaird beach where a horse chase was filmed and <a href="Loch%20Lurgainn">Loch Lurgainn</a>.

The village and its residents featured in "The Wee Mad Road" (2008) by Jack and Barbara Maloney.

Achiltibuie is also the setting of a humorous German book about Scotland by Reiner Luyken, "Schotten dicht" (2015) published by "<a href="Ullstein%20Verlag">Ullstein Verlag</a>", Berlin. Luyken was a multiple award winning foreign correspondent of the German weekly paper "<a href="Die%20Zeit">Die Zeit</a>" until his retirement in 2017.. He lives near Achiltibuie since 1978.

Adaptive expectations

In <a href="economics">economics</a>, adaptive expectations is a hypothesized process by which people form their expectations about what will happen in the future based on what has happened in the past. For example, if inflation has been higher than expected in the past, people would revise expectations for the future.

One simple version of adaptive expectations is stated in the following equation, where formula_1 is the next year's <a href="expected%20inflation">rate of inflation that is currently expected</a>; formula_2is this year's rate of inflation that was expected last year; and formula_3 is this year's actual rate of inflation:

where formula_5 is between 0 and 1. This says that current expectations of future inflation reflect past expectations and an "error-adjustment" term, in which current expectations are raised (or lowered) according to the gap between actual inflation and previous expectations. This error-adjustment is also called ""partial adjustment"."

The theory of adaptive expectations can be applied to all previous periods so that current inflationary expectations equal:

where formula_7 equals actual inflation formula_8 years in the past. Thus, current expected inflation reflects a weighted average of all past inflation, where the weights get smaller and smaller as we move further in the past.

Once a forecasting error is made by agents, due to a stochastic shock, they will be unable to correctly forecast the price level again even if the price level experiences no further shocks since they only ever incorporate part of their errors. The backward nature of expectation formulation and the resultant systematic errors made by agents (see <a href="Cobweb%20model">Cobweb model</a>) was unsatisfactory to economists such as <a href="John%20Muth">John Muth</a>, who was pivotal in the development of an alternative model of how expectations are formed, called <a href="rational%20expectations">rational expectations</a>. This has largely replaced adaptive expectations in macroeconomic theory since its assumption of optimality of expectations is consistent with economic theory. However, it must be stressed that confronting adaptivity and rationality is not necessarily justified, in other words, there are situations in which following the adaptive scheme is a rational response.

Adaptive expectations were instrumental in the <a href="Phillips%20curve">Phillips curve</a> outlined by <a href="Milton%20Friedman">Milton Friedman</a>. For Friedman, workers form adaptive expectations, so the government can easily surprise them through unexpected monetary policy changes. As agents are trapped by the <a href="money%20illusion">money illusion</a>, they are unable to correctly perceive price and wage dynamics, so, for Friedman, unemployment can always be reduced through monetary expansions. The result is an increasing level of inflation if the government chooses to fix unemployment at a low rate for an extended period of time. However, in this framework it is clear why and how adaptive expectations are problematic. Agents are arbitrarily supposed to ignore sources of information which, otherwise, would affect their expectations. For example, government announcements are such sources: agents are expected to modify their expectations and break with the former trends when changes in economic policy necessitate it. This is the reason why the theory of adaptive expectations is often regarded as a deviation from the rational tradition of economics.

Mexican tetra

The Mexican tetra or blind cave fish ("Astyanax mexicanus") is a <a href="freshwater">freshwater</a> <a href="fish">fish</a>
of the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Characidae">Characidae</a> of the <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> <a href="Characiformes">Characiformes</a>. The <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of its <a href="genus">genus</a>, it is native to the <a href="Nearctic">Nearctic</a> <a href="ecozone">ecozone</a>, originating in the lower <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a> and the <a href="Nueces%20River">Neueces</a> and <a href="Pecos%20River">Pecos River</a>s in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, as well as the central and eastern parts of Mexico.

Growing to a maximum overall length of , the Mexican tetra is of typical characin shape, with unremarkable, drab coloration. Its <a href="Blind%20fish">blind</a> cave form, however, is notable for having no eyes or pigment; it has a pinkish-white color to its body (resembling an <a href="Albinism%20in%20biology">albino</a>).

This fish, especially the blind variant, is reasonably popular among <a href="aquarist">aquarist</a>s.

"A. mexicanus" is a peaceful species that spends most of its time in midlevel water above the rocky and sandy bottoms of pools and backwaters of creeks and rivers of its native environment. Coming from a <a href="subtropical">subtropical</a> climate, it prefers water with 6.5–8 <a href="pH">pH</a>, a <a href="Hard%20water">hardness</a> of up to 30 <a href="dGH">dGH</a>, and a temperature range of . In the winter, some populations migrates to warmer waters. Its natural diet consists of <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, <a href="insect">insect</a>s, and <a href="annelid">annelid</a>s, although in captivity it is <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a>.

The Mexican tetra has been treated as a subspecies of "<a href="Astayanax%20faciatus">A. fasciatus</a>", but this is not widely accepted. Additionally, the blind cave form is sometimes recognized as a separate species, "<a href="Astyanax%20jordani">A. jordani</a>", but this directly contradicts <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> evidence.

"A. mexicanus" is famous for its blind <a href="Cavefish">cave form</a>, which is known by such names as blind cave tetra, blind tetra (leading to easy confusion with the Brazilian "<a href="Stygichthys%20typhlops">Stygichthys typhlops</a>"), blind cave characin and blind cavefish. Depending on the which population, cave forms can have degenerated <a href="visual%20perception">sight</a> or have total loss of sight and even their <a href="eye">eye</a>s. The fish in the Pachón caves have lost their eyes completely whilst the fish from the Micos cave only have limited sight. 
Cave fish and surface fish are able to produce fertile offspring.

These fish can still, however, find their way around by means of their <a href="lateral%20line">lateral line</a>s, which are highly sensitive to fluctuating <a href="water%20pressure">water pressure</a>. Currently, about 30 cave populations are known, dispersed over three geographically distinct areas in a karst region of <a href="San%20Luis%20Potos%C3%AD">San Luis Potosí</a> and far southern <a href="Tamaulipas">Tamaulipas</a>, northeastern Mexico. Among the various cave population are at least three with only full cave forms (blind and without pigment), at least eleven with cave, "normal" and intermediate forms, and at least one with both cave and "normal" forms but no intermediates. Studies suggest at least two distinct genetic <a href="Lineage%20%28evolution%29">lineages</a> occur among the blind populations, and the current distribution of populations arose by at least five independent invasions.

The eyed and eyeless forms of "A. mexicanus", being members of the same species, are closely related and can interbreed making this species an excellent <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a> for examining <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent</a> and <a href="parallel%20evolution">parallel evolution</a>, regressive evolution in cave animals, and the genetic basis of regressive traits. This, combined with the ease of maintaining the species in captivity, has made it the most studied cavefish and likely also the most studied <a href="List%20of%20troglobites">cave organism</a> overall.

The blind and colorless cave form of "A. mexicanus" is sometimes recognized as a separate species, "<a href="Astyanax%20jordani">A. jordani</a>", but this leaves the remaining "A. mexicanus" as a <a href="paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a> species and "A. jordani" as <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a>. The Cueva Chica Cave in the southern part of the Sierra del Abra system is the <a href="Type%20locality%20%28biology%29">type locality</a> for "A. jordani". Other blind populations were initially also recognized as separate species, including "antrobius" described in 1946 from the Pachón Cave and "hubbsi" described in 1947 from the Los Sabinos Cave (both subsequently merged into "jordani"/"mexicanus"). The most <a href="Genetic%20divergence">divergent</a> cave population is the one in Los Sabinos.

Another cave-adapted population of "Astyanax", varying from blind and depigmented to individuals showing intermediate features, is known from the Granadas Cave, part of the <a href="Balsas%20River">Balsas River</a> drainage in <a href="Guerrero">Guerrero</a>, southern Mexico, but it is a part of "<a href="Astyanax%20aeneus">A. aeneus</a>" (itself sometimes included in "A. mexicanus").

The surface and cave forms of the Mexican tetra have proven powerful subjects for scientists studying <a href="evolution">evolution</a>. When the surface-dwelling ancestors of current cave populations entered the subterranean environment, the change in ecological conditions rendered their <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a>—which included many biological functions dependent on the presence of light—subject to <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a> and <a href="genetic%20drift">genetic drift</a>. One of the most striking changes to evolve was the loss of eyes. This is referred to as a "regressive trait" because the surface fish that originally colonized caves possessed eyes. In addition to regressive traits, cave forms evolved "constructive traits". In contrast to regressive traits, the purpose or benefit of constructive traits is generally accepted. Active research focuses on the mechanisms driving the evolution of regressive traits, such as the loss of eyes, in "A. mexicanus". Recent studies have produced evidence that the mechanism may be direct selection, or indirect selection through antagonistic pleiotropy, rather than genetic drift and neutral mutation, the traditionally favored hypothesis for regressive evolution.

The blind form of the Mexican tetra is different from the surface-dwelling form in a number of ways, including having unpigmented skin, having a better <a href="olfaction">olfactory</a> sense by having <a href="taste%20bud">taste bud</a>s all over its head, and by being able to store four times more energy as fat, allowing it to deal with irregular food supplies more effectively.

Darwin said of sightless fish:

Modern genetics has made clear that the lack of use does not, in itself, necessitate a feature's disappearance. In this context, the positive genetic benefits have to be considered, i.e., what advantages are obtained by cave-dwelling tetras by losing their eyes? Possible explanations include:

Another likely explanation for the loss of its eyes is that of selective neutrality and genetic drift; in the dark environment of the cave, the eyes are neither advantageous nor disadvantageous and thus any genetic factors that might impair the eyes (or their development) can take hold with no consequence on the individual or species. Because there is no selection pressure for sight in this environment, any number of genetic abnormalities that give rise to the damage or loss of eyes could proliferate among the population with no effect on the fitness of the population.

Among some <a href="creation-evolution%20controversy">creationists</a>, the cave tetra is seen as evidence 'against' evolution. One argument claims this is an instance of "<a href="Biological%20devolution">devolution</a>"—showing an evolutionary trend of decreasing complexity. But evolution is a non-directional process, and while increased complexity is a common effect, there is no reason why evolution cannot tend towards simplicity if that makes an organism better suited to its environment.

Inhibition of the <a href="Hsp90">HSP90 protein</a> has a dramatic effect in the development of the blind tetra. This research is seen by creationists as evidence of "built-in adaptability, not slow and gradual evolution".

The blind cave tetras seen in the <a href="aquarium">aquarium</a> trade are all based on stock collected in the Cueva Chica Cave in the southern part of the Sierra del Abra system in 1936. These were sent to an aquarium company in Texas, who soon started to distribute them to aquarists. Since then, these have been <a href="selectively%20bred">selectively bred</a> for their <a href="troglomorphic">troglomorphic</a> traits. Today large numbers are bred at commercial facilities, especially in Asia.

The blind cave tetra is a hardy species. Their lack of sight does not hinder their ability to get food. They prefer subdued lighting with a rocky substrate, like gravel, mimicking their natural environment. They become semi-aggressive as they age, and are by nature schooling fish. Experiments have shown that keeping these fish in bright aquarium set-ups has no effect on the development of the skin flap that forms over their eyes as they grow.

<doc id="3211" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3211" title="Atom probe">
Atom probe

The atom probe was introduced at the <a href="http%3A//www.fieldemission.org/article.php%3Fid%3Dproceeding">14th Field Emission Symposium in 1967</a> by <a href="Erwin%20Wilhelm%20M%C3%BCller">Erwin Wilhelm Müller</a> and <a href="J.%20A.%20Panitz">J. A. Panitz</a>. It combined a <a href="field%20ion%20microscope">field ion microscope</a> with a mass spectrometer having a single particle detection capability and, for the first time, an instrument could “... determine the nature of one single atom seen on a metal surface and selected from neighboring atoms at the discretion of the observer”.

Atom probes are unlike conventional optical or <a href="electron%20microscope">electron microscope</a>s, in that the magnification effect comes from the magnification provided by a highly curved electric field, rather than by the manipulation of radiation paths. The method is destructive in nature removing ions from a sample surface in order to image and identify them, generating magnifications sufficient to observe individual atoms as they are removed from the sample surface. Through coupling of this magnification method with <a href="Time-of-flight%20mass%20spectrometry">time of flight mass spectrometry</a>, ions evaporated by application of electric pulses can have their mass-to-charge ratio computed.

Through successive evaporation of material, layers of atoms are removed from a specimen, allowing for probing not only of the surface, but also through the material itself. Computer methods are utilised to rebuild a three-dimensional view of the sample, prior to it being evaporated, providing atomic scale information on the structure of a sample, as well as providing the type atomic species information. The instrument allows the three-dimensional reconstruction of up to billions of <a href="atom">atom</a>s from a sharp tip (corresponding to specimen volumes of 10,000-10,000,000 <a href="nanometer">nm</a>).

Atom probe samples are shaped to implicitly provide a highly curved electric potential to induce the resultant magnification, as opposed to direct use of lensing, such as via <a href="magnetic%20lens">magnetic lens</a>es. Furthermore, in normal operation (as opposed to a field ionization modes) the atom probe does not utilize a secondary source to probe the sample. Rather, the sample is evaporated in a controlled manner (field evaporation) and the evaporated ions are impacted onto a detector, which is typically 10 to 100 cm away.

The samples are required to have a needle geometry and are produced by similar techniques as TEM sample preparation <a href="electropolishing">electropolishing</a>, or <a href="focused%20ion%20beam">focused ion beam</a> methods. Since 2006, commercial systems with laser pulsing have become available and this has expanded applications from metallic only specimens into semiconducting, insulating such as ceramics, and even geological materials. Preparation is done, often by hand, to manufacture a tip radius sufficient to induce a high electric field, with radii on the order of 100 <a href="nanometer">nm</a>.

To conduct an atom probe experiment a very sharp needle shaped specimen is placed in an <a href="ultra%20high%20vacuum">ultra high vacuum</a> chamber. After introduction into the vacuum system, the sample is reduced to cryogenic temperatures (typically 20-100 K) and manipulated such that the needle's point is aimed towards an ion detector. A high voltage is applied to the specimen, and either a laser pulse is applied to the specimen or a voltage pulse (typically 1-2 kV) with pulse repetition rates in the hundreds of kilohertz range is applied to a counter electrode. The application of the pulse to the sample allows for individual atoms at the sample surface to be ejected as an ion from the sample surface at a known time. Typically the pulse amplitude and the high voltage on the specimen are computer controlled to encourage only one atom to ionize at a time, but multiple ionizations are possible. The delay between application of the pulse and detection of the ion(s) at the detector allow for the computation of a mass-to-charge ratio.

Whilst the uncertainty in the atomic mass computed by time-of-flight methods in atom probe is sufficiently small to allow for detection of individual isotopes within a material this uncertainty may still, in some cases, confound definitive identification of atomic species. Effects such as superposition of differing ions with multiple electrons removed, or through the presence of complex species formation during evaporation may cause two or more species to have sufficiently close time-of-flights to make definitive identification impossible.

Field ion microscopy is a modification of <a href="field%20emission%20microscopy">field emission microscopy</a> where a stream of tunneling electrons is emitted from the apex of a sharp needle-like "tip" cathode when subjected to a sufficiently high electric field (~3-6 V/nm). The needle is oriented towards a phosphor screen to create a projected image of the <a href="work%20function">work function</a> at the tip apex. The image resolution is limited to (2-2.5 nm), due to quantum mechanical effects and lateral variations in the electron velocity.

In field ion microscopy the tip is cooled by a cryogen and its polarity is reversed. When an "imaging gas" (usually hydrogen or helium) is introduced at low pressures (< 0.1 Pascal) gas ions in the high electric field at the tip apex are "field ionized" and produce a projected image of protruding atoms at the tip apex. The image resolution is determined primarily by the temperature of the tip but even at 78 Kelvin atomic resolution is achieved.

The 10-cm Atom Probe, invented in 1973 by <a href="J.%20A.%20Panitz">J. A. Panitz</a> was a “new and simple atom probe which permits rapid, in depth species identification or the more usual atom-by atom analysis provided by its predecessors ... in an instrument having a volume of less than two liters in which tip movement is unnecessary and the problems of evaporation pulse stability and alignment common to previous designs have been eliminated.” This was accomplished by combining a <a href="Time-of-flight%20mass%20spectrometry">time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometer</a> with a proximity focussed, dual channel plate detector, an 11.8 cm drift region and a 38° field of view. An FIM image or a desorption image of the atoms removed from the apex of a field emitter tip could be obtained. The 10-cm Atom Probe has been called the "progenitor" of later atom probes including the commercial instruments.

The Imaging Atom-Probe (IAP) was introduced in 1974 by <a href="J.%20A.%20Panitz">J. A. Panitz</a>. It incorporated the features of the 10-cm Atom-Probe yet “... departs completely from [previous] atom probe philosophy. Rather than attempt to determine the identity of a surface species producing a preselected ion-image spot, we wish to determine the complete crystallographic distribution of a surface species of preselected mass-to-charge ratio. Now suppose that instead of operating the [detector] continuously, it is turned on for a short time coincidentally with the arrival of a preselected species of interest by applying a "gate pulse" a time T after the evaporation pulse has reached the specimen. If the duration of the gate pulse is shorter than the travel time between adjacent species, only that surface species having the unique travel time T will be detected and its complete crystallographic distribution displayed.” It was patented in 1975 as the Field Desorption Spectrometer. The Imaging Atom-Probe moniker was coined by A. J. Waugh in 1978 and the instrument was described in detail by J. A. Panitz in the same year.

Modern day atom probe tomography (APT) uses a position-sensitive detector to deduce the lateral location of atoms. The idea of the APT, inspired by J. A. Panitz's "Field Desorption Spectrometer" patent, was developed by Mike Miller starting in 1983 and culminated with the first prototype in 1986. Various refinements were made to the instrument, including the use of a so-called position-sensitive (PoS) detector by Alfred Cerezo, Terence Godfrey, and George D. W. Smith at Oxford University in 1988. The Tomographic Atom Probe (TAP), developed by researchers at the University of Rouen in France in 1993, introduced a multichannel timing system and multianode array. Both instruments (PoSAP and TAP) were commercialized by <a href="Oxford%20Instruments">Oxford Nanoscience</a> and <a href="CAMECA">CAMECA</a> respectively. Since then, there have been many refinements to increase the field of view, mass and position resolution, and data acquisition rate of the instrument. The Local Electrode Atom Probe was first introduced in 2003 by Imago Scientific Instruments. In 2005, the commercialization of the pulsed laser atom probe (PLAP) expanded the avenues of research from highly conductive materials (metals) to poor conductors (semiconductors like silicon) and even insulating materials. <a href="AMETEK">AMETEK</a> acquired <a href="CAMECA">CAMECA</a> in 2007 and <a href="Imago%20Scientific%20Instruments">Imago Scientific Instruments</a> (Madison, WI) in 2010, making the company the sole commercial developer of APTs with more than 90 instruments installed around the world in 2016.

The first few decades of work with APT focused on metals. However, more recent work has been done on semiconductors, ceramic and geologic materials, with some work on biomaterials. The most advanced study of biological material to date using APT involved analyzing the chemical structure of teeth of the <a href="radula">radula</a> of <a href="chiton">chiton</a> "<a href="Chaetopleura%20apiculata">Chaetopleura apiculata</a>". In this study, the use of APT showed chemical maps of organic fibers in the surrounding nano-crystalline <a href="magnetite">magnetite</a> in the chiton teeth, fibers which were often co-located with <a href="sodium">sodium</a> or <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>. This has been furthered to study <a href="elephant%20tusks">elephant tusks</a>, <a href="dentin">dentin</a> and potentially human <a href="Tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>.

Field evaporation is an effect that can occur when an atom bonded at the surface of a material is in the presence of a sufficiently high and appropriately directed electric field, where the electric field is the differential of electric potential (voltage) with respect to distance. Once this condition is met, it is sufficient that local bonding at the specimen surface is capable of being overcome by the field, allowing for evaporation of an atom from the surface to which it is otherwise bonded.

Whether evaporated from the material itself, or ionised from the gas, the ions that are evaporated are accelerated by electrostatic force, acquiring most of their energy within a few tip-radii of the sample.

Subsequently, the accelerative force on any given ion is controlled by the <a href="electrostatic%20equation">electrostatic equation</a>, where "n" is the ionisation state of the ion, and "e" is the fundamental electric charge.

This can be equated with the mass of the ion, "m", via Newton's law (F=ma):

Relativistic effects in the ion flight are usually ignored, as realisable ion speeds are only a very small fraction of the speed of light.

Assuming that the ion is accelerated during a very short interval, the ion can be assumed to be travelling at constant velocity. As the ion will travel from the tip at voltage V to some nominal ground potential, the speed at which the ion is travelling can be estimated by the energy transferred into the ion during (or near) ionisation. Therefore, the ion speed can be computed with the following equation, which relates kinetic energy to energy gain due to the electric field, the negative arising from the loss of electrons forming a net positive charge.

Where "U" is the ion velocity. Solving for "U", the following relation is found:

Let's say that for at a certain ionization voltage, a singly charged <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> ion acquires a resulting velocity of X ms. A singly charged <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a> ion under the sample conditions would have acquired roughly X/1.41 ms. If a detector was placed at a distance of 1 m, the ion flight times would be 1/X and 1.41/X s. Thus, the time of the ion arrival can be used to infer the ion type itself, if the evaporation time is known.

From the above equation, it can be re-arranged to show that

given a known flight distance. F, for the ion, and a known flight time, t,

and thus one can substitute these values to obtain the mass-to-charge for the ion.

Thus for an ion which traverses a 1 m flight path, across a time of 2000 ns, given an initial accelerating voltage of 5000 V (V in Si units is kg.m^2.s^-3.A^-1) and noting that one amu is 1×10 kg, the mass-to-charge ratio (more correctly the mass-to-ionisation value ratio) becomes ~3.86 amu/charge. The number of electrons removed, and thus net positive charge on the ion is not known directly, but can be inferred from the histogram (spectrum) of observed ions.

The magnification in an atom is due to the projection of ions radially away from the small, sharp tip. Subsequently, in the far field, the ions will be greatly magnified. This magnification is sufficient to observe field variations due to individual atoms, thus allowing in field ion and field evaporation modes for the imaging of single atoms.

The standard projection model for the atom probe is an emitter geometry that is based upon a revolution of a <a href="conic%20section">conic section</a>, such as a sphere, <a href="hyperboloid">hyperboloid</a> or <a href="paraboloid">paraboloid</a>. For these tip models, solutions to the field may be approximated or obtained analytically. The magnification for a spherical emitter is inversely proportional to the radius of the tip, given a projection directly onto a spherical screen, the following equation can be obtained geometrically.

Where r is the radius of the detection screen from the tip centre, and r the tip radius. Practical tip to screen distances may range from several centimeters to several meters, with increased detector area required at larger to subtend the same <a href="field%20of%20view">field of view</a>.

Practically speaking, the usable magnification will be limited by several effects, such as lateral vibration of the atoms prior to evaporation.

Whilst the magnification of both the field ion and atom probe microscopes is extremely high, the exact magnification is dependent upon conditions specific to the examined specimen, so unlike for conventional <a href="electron%20microscope">electron microscope</a>s, there is often little direct control on magnification, and furthermore, obtained images may have strongly variable magnifications due to fluctuations in the shape of the electric field at the surface.

The computational conversion of the ion sequence data, as obtained from a position sensitive detector, to a three-dimensional visualisation of atomic types, is termed "reconstruction". Reconstruction algorithms are typically geometrically based, and have several literature formulations. Most models for reconstruction assume that the tip is a spherical object, and utilise empirical corrections to <a href="stereographic%20projection">stereographic projection</a> to convert detector positions back to a 2D surface embedded in 3D space, R. By sweeping this surface through R as a function of the ion sequence input data, such as via ion-ordering, a volume is generated onto which positions the 2D detector positions can be computed and placed three-dimensional space.

Typically the sweep takes the simple form of an advancement of the surface, such that the surface is expanded in a symmetric manner about its advancement axis, with the advancement rate set by a volume attributed to each ion detected and identified. This causes the final reconstructed volume to assume a rounded-conical shape, similar to a badminton <a href="shuttlecock">shuttlecock</a>. The detected events thus become a <a href="point%20cloud">point cloud</a> data with attributed experimentally measured values, such as ion time of flight or experimentally derived quantities, e.g. time of flight or detector data.

This form of data manipulation allows for rapid computer visualisation and analysis, with data presented as point cloud data with additional information, such as each ion's mass to charge (as computed from the velocity equation above), voltage or other auxiliary measured quantity or computation therefrom.

The canonical feature of atom probe data, is its high spatial resolution in the direction through the material, which has been attributed to an ordered evaporation sequence. This data can therefore image near atomically sharp buried interfaces with the associated chemical information.

The data obtained from the evaporative process is however not without artefacts that form the physical evaporation or ionisation process. A key feature of the evaporation or field ion images is that the data density is highly inhomogeneous, due to the corrugation of the specimen surface at the atomic scale. This corrugation gives rise to strong electric field gradients in the near-tip zone (on the order of an atomic radii or less from the tip), which during ionisation deflects ions away from the electric field normal.

The resultant deflection means that in these regions of high curvature, atomic terraces are belied by a strong anisotropy in the detection density. Where this occurs due to a few atoms on a surface is usually referred to as a "pole", as these are coincident with the crystallographic axes of the specimen (<a href="Cubic%20crystal%20system">FCC</a>, <a href="Cubic%20crystal%20system">BCC</a>, <a href="Close-packing%20of%20spheres">HCP</a>) etc. Where the edges of an atomic terrace causes deflection, a low density line is formed and is termed a "zone line".

These poles and zone-lines, whilst inducing fluctuations in data density in the reconstructed datasets, which can prove problematic during post-analysis, are critical for determining information such as angular magnification, as the crystallographic relationships between features are typically well known.

When reconstructing the data, owing to the evaporation of successive layers of material from the sample, the lateral and in-depth reconstruction values are highly anisotropic. Determination of the exact resolution of the instrument is of limited use, as the resolution of the device is set by the physical properties of the material under analysis.

Many designs have been constructed since the method's inception. Initial field ion microscopes, precursors to modern atom probes, were usually glass blown devices developed by individual research laboratories.

At a minimum, an atom probe will consist of several key pieces of equipment.


Optionally, an atom probe may also include laser-optical systems for laser beam targeting and pulsing, if using laser-evaporation methods. In-situ reaction systems, heaters, or plasma treatment may also be employed for some studies as well as pure noble gas introduction for FIM.

Collectable ion volumes were previously limited to several thousand, or tens of thousands of ionic events. Subsequent electronics and instrumentation development has increased the rate of data accumulation, with datasets of hundreds of million atoms (dataset volumes of 10 nm). Data collection times vary considerably depending upon the experimental conditions and the number of ions collected. Experiments take from a few minutes, to many hours to complete.

Atom probe has typically been employed in the chemical analysis of alloy systems at the atomic level. This has arisen as a result of voltage pulsed atom probes providing good chemical and sufficient spatial information in these materials. Metal samples from large grained alloys may be simple to fabricate, particularly from wire samples, with hand-electropolishing techniques giving good results.

Subsequently, atom probe has been used in the analysis of the chemical composition of a wide range of alloys.

Such data is critical in determining the effect of alloy constituents in a bulk material, identification of solid-state reaction features, such as solid phase precipitates. Such information may not be amenable to analysis by other means (e.g. <a href="Transmission%20electron%20microscopy">TEM</a>) owing to the difficulty in generating a three-dimensional dataset with composition.

Semi-conductor materials are often analysable in atom probe, however sample preparation may be more difficult, and interpretation of results may be more complex, particularly if the semi-conductor contains phases which evaporate at differing electric field strengths.

Applications such as ion implantation may be used to identify the distribution of dopants inside a semi-conducting material, which is increasingly critical in the correct design of modern nanometre scale electronics.

Al Capone

Alphonse Gabriel Capone (; ; January 17, 1899 – January 25, 1947), sometimes known by the nickname Scarface, was an American <a href="mobster">mobster</a>, <a href="crime%20boss">crime boss</a> and businessman who attained fame during the <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition era</a> as the co-founder and boss of the <a href="Chicago%20Outfit">Chicago Outfit</a>. His seven-year reign as crime boss ended when he was 33 years old.

Capone was born in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> to <a href="Italian%20American">Italian immigrants</a>. He was considered a <a href="Five%20Points%20Gang">Five Points Gang</a> member who became a bouncer in organized crime premises such as <a href="brothels">brothels</a>. In his early twenties, he moved to <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> and became bodyguard and trusted factotum for <a href="Johnny%20Torrio">Johnny Torrio</a>, head of a criminal syndicate that illegally supplied alcohol—the forerunner of the Outfit—and that was politically protected through the <a href="Unione%20Siciliana">Unione Siciliana</a>. A conflict with the <a href="North%20Side%20Gang">North Side Gang</a> was instrumental in Capone's rise and fall. Torrio went into retirement after North Side gunmen almost killed him, handing control to Capone. Capone expanded the <a href="Rum-running">bootlegging</a> business through increasingly violent means, but his mutually profitable relationships with mayor <a href="William%20Hale%20Thompson">William Hale Thompson</a> and the city's police meant that Capone seemed safe from law enforcement.

Capone apparently reveled in attention, such as the cheers from spectators when he appeared at ball games. He made donations to various charities and was viewed by many to be a "modern-day <a href="Robin%20Hood">Robin Hood</a>". However, the <a href="Saint%20Valentine%27s%20Day%20Massacre">Saint Valentine's Day Massacre</a> of gang rivals, resulting in the killing of seven men in broad daylight, damaged Chicago's image—as well as Capone's—leading influential citizens to demand governmental action and newspapers to dub him "Public Enemy No. 1".

The federal authorities became intent on jailing Capone, and they prosecuted him for tax evasion in 1931, a federal crime and a novel strategy during the era. During the highly publicized case, the judge admitted as evidence Capone's admissions of his income and unpaid taxes during prior (and ultimately abortive) negotiations to pay the government any back taxes he owed. Capone was convicted and sentenced to 11 years in <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Prisons">federal prison</a>. After conviction, he replaced his old defense team with experts in tax law, and his grounds for appeal were strengthened by a <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> ruling, but his appeal ultimately failed.

He was already showing signs of <a href="Neurosyphilis">syphilitic</a> <a href="dementia">dementia</a> early in his sentence, and he became increasingly debilitated before being released after eight years. On January 25, 1947, Capone died of <a href="cardiac%20arrest">cardiac arrest</a> after suffering a stroke.

Al Capone was born in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> on January 17, 1899. His parents were <a href="Italian%20people">Italian</a> immigrants Gabriele Capone (1865 – 1920) and Teresa Capone (née Raiola; 1867 – 1952). His father was a <a href="barber">barber</a> and his mother was a <a href="sewing">seamstress</a>, both born in <a href="Angri">Angri</a>, a town in the <a href="Province%20of%20Salerno">Province of Salerno</a>.

Gabriele and Teresa had nine children: Alphonse "Al" Capone; <a href="James%20Vincenzo%20Capone">Vincenzo Capone</a>, who later changed his name to Richard Hart and became a Prohibition agent in <a href="Homer%2C%20Nebraska">Homer, Nebraska</a>; <a href="Ralph%20Capone">Raffaele James Capone</a>, AKA Ralph "Bottles" Capone, who took charge of his brother's beverage industry; <a href="Frank%20Capone">Salvatore "Frank" Capone</a>, Ermina Capone, who died at the age of one, Ermino "John" Capone, Albert Capone, Matthew Capone, and Mafalda Capone (who married John J. Maritote). Ralph and Frank worked with him in his criminal empire. Frank did so until his death on April 1, 1924. Ralph ran the bottling companies (both legal and illegal) early on, and was also the front man for the <a href="Chicago%20Outfit">Chicago Outfit</a> for some time until he was imprisoned for tax evasion in 1932.

The Capone family immigrated to the United States, first immigrating from Italy to Fiume, <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> (present day <a href="Rijeka">Rijeka</a>, <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>) in 1893, traveling on a ship to the U.S., and finally settling at 95 Navy Street, in the <a href="Brooklyn%20Navy%20Yard">Navy Yard</a> section of <a href="downtown%20Brooklyn">downtown Brooklyn</a>. Gabriele Capone worked at a nearby barber shop at 29 Park Avenue. When Al was 11, the Capone family moved to 38 Garfield Place in <a href="Park%20Slope">Park Slope</a>, Brooklyn.

Capone showed promise as a student, but had trouble with the rules at his strict parochial <a href="Catholic%20school">Catholic school</a>. His schooling ended at the age of 14, after he was expelled for hitting a female teacher in the face. He worked at odd jobs around Brooklyn, including a candy store and a <a href="bowling">bowling</a> alley. During this time, Capone was influenced by gangster <a href="Johnny%20Torrio">Johnny Torrio</a>, whom he came to regard as a mentor.

Capone initially became involved with small-time gangs that included the Junior Forty Thieves and the Bowery Boys. He then joined the Brooklyn Rippers, and then the powerful <a href="Five%20Points%20Gang">Five Points Gang</a> based in Lower Manhattan. During this time, he was employed and mentored by fellow racketeer <a href="Frankie%20Yale">Frankie Yale</a>, a <a href="bartender">bartender</a> in a <a href="Coney%20Island">Coney Island</a> dance hall and saloon called the Harvard Inn. Capone inadvertently insulted a woman while working the door at a Brooklyn night club and was slashed by her brother Frank Gallucio. The wounds led to the nickname that Capone loathed: "Scarface". Yale insisted that Capone apologize to Gallucio, and Capone later hired him as his bodyguard. When he was photographed, Capone hid the scarred left side of his face, saying that the injuries were war wounds. Capone was called "Snorky", a term for a sharp dresser, by his closest friends.

Capone married Mae Josephine Coughlin at age 19 on December 30, 1918. She was Irish Catholic and earlier that month had given birth to their son Albert Francis "Sonny" Capone. Capone was under the age of 21, and his parents had to consent in writing to the marriage.

At about 20 years of age, Capone left New York for <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> at the invitation of <a href="Johnny%20Torrio">Johnny Torrio</a>, who was imported by <a href="crime%20boss">crime boss</a> <a href="Jim%20Colosimo">James "Big Jim" Colosimo</a> as an enforcer. Capone began in Chicago as a bouncer in a brothel, where he contracted <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>. Timely use of <a href="Arsphenamine">Salvarsan</a> probably could have cured the infection, but he apparently never sought treatment. In 1923, he purchased a small house at 7244 South <a href="Prairie%20Avenue">Prairie Avenue</a> in the Park Manor neighborhood on the city's <a href="South%20Side%2C%20Chicago">south side</a> for . In the early years of the decade, Capone's name began appearing in newspaper sports pages, where he was described as a boxing promoter.

Chicago's location on Lake Michigan gave access to a vast inland territory, and it was well-served by railroads. Torrio took over Colosimo's crime empire after Colosimo's murder on May 11, 1920, in which Capone was suspected of being involved.

Torrio headed an essentially Italian organized crime group that was the biggest in the city, with Capone as his right-hand man. He was wary of being drawn into gang wars and tried to negotiate agreements over territory between rival crime groups. The smaller, mixed ethnicity, <a href="North%20Side%20Gang">North Side Gang</a> led by <a href="Dean%20O%27Banion">Dean O'Banion</a> (also known as Dion O'Banion) came under pressure from the Genna brothers, who were allied with Torrio. O'Banion found that, for all Torrio's pretensions to be a settler of disputes, he was unhelpful with the encroachment of the Gennas into the North Side. In a fateful step, Torrio either arranged for or acquiesced to the murder of O'Banion at the latter's flower shop in October 1924. This placed <a href="Hymie%20Weiss">Hymie Weiss</a> at the head of the gang, backed by <a href="Vincent%20Drucci">Vincent Drucci</a> and <a href="Bugs%20Moran">Bugs Moran</a>. Weiss had been a close friend of O'Banion, and the North Siders treated revenge on his killers as a priority.

In January 1925, Capone was ambushed, leaving him shaken, but unhurt. Twelve days later, Torrio was returning from a shopping trip when he was shot several times. After recovering, Torrio effectively resigned and handed control to Capone, age 26, who became the new boss of an organization that took in illegal breweries and a transportation network that reached to Canada, with political and law-enforcement protection. In turn, he was able to use more violence to increase revenue. Refusal by an establishment to purchase liquor from him often resulted in the premises being blown up. As many as 100 people were killed in such bombings during the 1920s. Rivals saw Capone as responsible for the proliferation of brothels in the city.

Capone indulged in custom suits, cigars, gourmet food and drink (his preferred liquor was <a href="Templeton%20Rye">Templeton Rye</a> from <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a>), and female companionship. He was particularly known for his flamboyant and costly jewelry. His favorite responses to questions about his activities were: "I am just a businessman, giving the people what they want"; and, "All I do is satisfy a public demand." Capone had become a national celebrity and talking point.

Capone based himself in <a href="Cicero%2C%20Illinois">Cicero</a> after using bribery and widespread intimidation to take over during elections for the town council. This made it difficult for the North Siders to target him. Capone's driver was found tortured and murdered, and there was an attempt on Weiss's life in the <a href="Chicago%20Loop">Chicago Loop</a>. On September 20, 1926, the North Side Gang used a ploy outside the Capone headquarters at the Hawthorne Inn, aimed at drawing him to the windows. Gunmen in several cars then opened fire with <a href="Thompson%20submachine%20gun">Thompson submachine gun</a>s and shotguns at the windows of the first-floor restaurant. Capone was unhurt and called for a truce, but the negotiations fell through. Three weeks later, Weiss was killed outside the former O'Banion flower shop North Side headquarters. In January 1927, the Hawthorne's restaurant owner, a friend of Capone's, was kidnapped and killed by Moran and Drucci.

Capone became increasingly security-minded and desirous of getting away from Chicago. As a precaution, he and his entourage would often show up suddenly at one of Chicago's train depots and buy up an entire <a href="Pullman%20%28car%20or%20coach%29">Pullman</a> <a href="Sleeping%20car">sleeper car</a> on a night train to a place like Cleveland, Omaha, Kansas City, <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock</a>, or Hot Springs, where they would spend a week in luxury hotel suites under assumed names. In 1928, Capone paid $40,000 to beer magnate August Busch for a 14-room retreat at 93 Palm Avenue on <a href="Palm%20Island%20%28Miami%20Beach%29">Palm Island, Florida</a>, in <a href="Biscayne%20Bay">Biscayne Bay</a> between <a href="Miami">Miami</a> and <a href="Miami%20Beach">Miami Beach</a>. Capone never registered any property under his name. He did not even have a bank account, but always used Western Union for cash delivery, not more than $1,000.

The protagonists of Chicago's politics had long been associated with questionable methods, and even newspaper circulation "wars", but the need for bootleggers to have protection in city hall introduced a far more serious level of violence and graft. Capone is generally seen as having an appreciable effect in bringing about the victories of Republican <a href="William%20Hale%20Thompson">William Hale Thompson</a>, especially in the 1927 mayoral race when Thompson campaigned for a wide open town, at one time hinting that he'd reopen illegal saloons. Such a proclamation helped his campaign gain the support of Capone, and he allegedly accepted a contribution of $250,000 from the gangster. In the 1927 mayoral race, Thompson beat <a href="William%20Emmett%20Dever">William Emmett Dever</a> by a relatively slim margin. Thompson's powerful Cook County <a href="political%20machine">political machine</a> had drawn on the often-parochial Italian community, but this was in tension with his highly successful courting of African Americans.

Capone continued to back Thompson. Voting booths were targeted by Capone's bomber <a href="James%20Belcastro">James Belcastro</a> in the wards where Thompson's opponents were thought to have support, on the polling day of April 10, 1928, in the so-called <a href="Pineapple%20Primary">Pineapple Primary</a>, causing the deaths of at least 15 people. Belcastro was also accused of the murder of lawyer Octavius Granady, an African American who challenged Thompson's candidate for the African American vote, and was chased through the streets on polling day by cars of gunmen before being shot dead. Four policemen were among those charged along with Belcastro, but all charges were dropped after key witnesses recanted their statements. An indication of the attitude of local law enforcement to Capone's organization came in 1931 when Belcastro was wounded in a shooting; police suggested to skeptical journalists that Belcastro was an independent operator.

The 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre led to public disquiet about Thompson's alliance with Capone and was a factor in <a href="Anton%20J.%20Cermak">Anton J. Cermak</a> winning the mayoral election on April 6, 1931.

Capone was widely assumed to have been responsible for ordering the 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre in an attempt to kill <a href="Bugs%20Moran">Bugs Moran</a>, the head of the North Side Gang. Moran was the last survivor of the main North Side gunmen; his succession had come about because his similarly aggressive predecessors <a href="Vincent%20Drucci">Vincent Drucci</a> and <a href="Hymie%20Weiss">Hymie Weiss</a> had been killed in the violence that followed the murder of original leader <a href="Dean%20O%27Banion">Dean O'Banion</a>.

To monitor their targets' habits and movements, Capone's men rented an apartment across from the trucking warehouse and garage at 2122 North Clark Street that served as Moran headquarters. On the morning of Thursday, February 14, 1929, Capone's lookouts signaled gunmen disguised as police to start a "raid." The "faux" police lined the seven victims along a wall without a struggle, then signaled for accomplices with machine guns. The seven victims were machine-gunned and shot-gunned. Photos of the victims shocked the public and damaged Capone's reputation. Within days, Capone received a summons to testify before a Chicago grand jury on violations of the federal Prohibition Law, but he claimed to be too unwell to attend at that time.

On March 27, 1929, Capone was arrested by FBI agents as he left a Chicago courtroom after testifying to a grand jury that was investigating violations of federal prohibition laws. He was charged with contempt of court for feigning illness to avoid an earlier appearance. In May 1929, Capone was sentenced to a prison term in Philadelphia's <a href="Eastern%20State%20Penitentiary">Eastern State Penitentiary</a>; he was convicted within 16 hours of being arrested for carrying a gun during a trip there. A week after his release in March 1930, Capone was listed as the number one "Public Enemy" on the unofficial <a href="Chicago%20Crime%20Commission">Chicago Crime Commission</a>'s widely publicized list.

In April 1930, Capone was arrested on vagrancy charges when visiting Miami Beach; the governor had ordered sheriffs to run him out of the state. Capone claimed that Miami police had refused him food and water and threatened to arrest his family. He was charged with <a href="perjury">perjury</a> for making these statements, but was acquitted after a three-day trial in July. In September, a Chicago judge issued a warrant for Capone's arrest on charges of vagrancy, and then used the publicity to run against Thompson in the Republican primary. In February 1931, Capone was tried on the contempt of court charge. In court, Judge <a href="James%20Herbert%20Wilkerson">James Herbert Wilkerson</a> intervened to reinforce questioning of Capone's doctor by the prosecutor. Wilkerson sentenced Capone to six months, but he remained free while on appeal of the contempt conviction.

In 1927, the Supreme Court ruled that illegally earned income was subject to income tax; Justice <a href="Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%20Jr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.</a> rejected the argument that the <a href="Fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifth Amendment</a> protected criminals from reporting illegal income. The IRS special investigation unit chose <a href="Frank%20J.%20Wilson">Frank J. Wilson</a> to investigate Capone, with the focus on his spending. The key to Capone's conviction on tax charges was proving his income, and the most valuable evidence in that regard originated in his offer to pay tax. Ralph, his brother and a gangster in his own right, was tried for tax evasion in 1930. Ralph spent the next three years in prison after being convicted in a two-week trial over which Wilkerson presided. Capone ordered his lawyer to regularize his tax position. Crucially, during the ultimately abortive negotiations that followed, his lawyer stated the income that Capone was willing to pay tax on for various years, admitting income of $100,000 for 1928 and 1929, for instance. Hence, without any investigation, the government had been given a letter from a lawyer acting for Capone conceding his large taxable income for certain years. In 1931, Capone was charged with <a href="income%20tax%20evasion">income tax evasion</a>, as well as with various violations of the <a href="Volstead%20Act">Volstead Act</a> (Prohibition) at the <a href="Chicago%20Federal%20Building">Chicago Federal Building</a> in the courtroom of Judge <a href="James%20Herbert%20Wilkerson">James Herbert Wilkerson</a>. U. S. Attorney George E. Q. Johnson agreed to a deal that he hoped might result in the judge giving Capone a couple of years, but Judge Wilkerson had been aware of the deal all along and refused to allow Capone to plead guilty for a reduced sentence. On the second day of the trial, Judge Wilkerson overruled objections that a lawyer could not confess for his client, saying that anyone making a statement to the government did so at his own risk. Wilkerson deemed that the 1930 letter to federal authorities could be admitted into evidence from a lawyer acting for Capone.
Much was later made of other evidence, such as witnesses and ledgers, but these strongly implied Capone's control rather than stating it. The ledgers were inadmissible on grounds of statute of limitations, but Capone's lawyers incompetently failed to make the necessary timely objection; they also ran a basically irrelevant defense of gambling losses. Judge Wilkerson allowed Capone's spending to be presented at very great length. There was no doubt that Capone "spent" vast sums but, legally speaking, the case against him centered on the size of his "income." Capone was convicted on October 17, and was sentenced a week later to eleven years in federal prison, fined $50,000 plus $7,692 for court costs, and was held liable for $215,000 plus interest due on his back taxes. The contempt of court sentence was served concurrently. New lawyers hired to represent Capone were Washington-based tax experts. They filed a writ of habeas corpus based on a Supreme Court ruling that tax evasion was not fraud, which apparently meant that Capone had been convicted on charges relating to years that were actually outside the time limit for prosecution. However, a judge interpreted the law so that the time that Capone had spent in Miami was subtracted from the age of the offences, thereby denying the appeal of both Capone's conviction and sentence.

Capone was sent to <a href="United%20States%20Penitentiary%2C%20Atlanta">Atlanta U.S. Penitentiary</a> in May 1932, aged 33. Upon his arrival at Atlanta, the Capone was officially diagnosed with <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a> and <a href="Gonorrhea">gonorrhoea</a>. He was also suffering from withdrawal symptoms from cocaine addiction, the use of which had perforated his septum. Capone was competent at his prison job of stitching soles on shoes for eight hours a day, but his letters were barely coherent. He was seen as a weak personality, and so out of his depth dealing with bullying fellow inmates that his cellmate, seasoned convict Red Rudinsky, feared that Capone would have a breakdown. Rudinsky was formerly a small-time criminal associated with the Capone gang, and found himself becoming a protector for Capone. The conspicuous protection of Rudinsky and other prisoners drew accusations from less friendly inmates, and fueled suspicion that Capone was receiving special treatment. No solid evidence ever emerged, but it formed part of the rationale for moving Capone to the recently opened <a href="Alcatraz%20Federal%20Penitentiary">Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary</a> off the coast of San Francisco. On June 23, 1936, Capone was stabbed and superficially wounded by <a href="James%20C.%20Lucas">James C. Lucas</a>.

At Alcatraz, Capone's decline became increasingly evident as <a href="neurosyphilis">neurosyphilis</a> progressively eroded his mental faculties. He spent the last year of his sentence in the prison hospital, confused and disoriented. Capone completed his term in Alcatraz on January 6, 1939, and was transferred to the <a href="Federal%20Correctional%20Institution%2C%20Terminal%20Island">Federal Correctional Institution at Terminal Island</a> in California to serve out his sentence for contempt of court. He was paroled on November 16, 1939.

The main effect of Capone's conviction was that he ceased to be boss immediately on his imprisonment, but those involved in the jailing of Capone portrayed it as considerably undermining the city's <a href="organized%20crime">organized crime</a> syndicate. Far from being smashed, the <a href="Chicago%20Outfit">Chicago Outfit</a> continued without being troubled by the Chicago police, but at a lower-level and without the open violence that had marked Capone's rule. Organized crime in the city had a lower profile once <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a> was repealed, already wary of attention after seeing Capone's notoriety bring him down, to the extent that there is a lack of consensus among writers about who was actually in control and who was a figurehead "front boss". Prostitution, labor union racketeering, and gambling became moneymakers for organized crime in the city without incurring serious investigation. In the late 1950s, FBI agents discovered an organization led by Capone's former lieutenants reigning supreme over the Chicago underworld.

After Capone was released from prison, he was referred to <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital">Johns Hopkins Hospital</a> in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> for the treatment of <a href="General%20paresis%20of%20the%20insane">paresis</a> (caused by late-stage syphilis). Hopkins refused to admit him based solely on his reputation, but <a href="Union%20Memorial%20Hospital">Union Memorial Hospital</a> accepted him. Capone was grateful for the compassionate care that he received and donated two Japanese weeping cherry trees to Union Memorial Hospital in 1939. A very sickly Capone left Baltimore on March 20, 1940, after a few weeks inpatient and a few weeks outpatient, for <a href="Palm%20Island%2C%20Florida">Palm Island, Florida</a>.

In 1946, his physician and a Baltimore psychiatrist performed examinations and concluded that Capone had the mentality of a 12-year-old child. Capone spent the last years of his life at his mansion in Palm Island, Florida. On January 21, 1947, Capone had a <a href="stroke">stroke</a>. He regained consciousness and started to improve, but contracted <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. He suffered a <a href="cardiac%20arrest">cardiac arrest</a> on January 22. On January 25, Capone died in his home, surrounded by his family. He wаs buried аt <a href="Mount%20Carmel%20Cemetery%20%28Hillside%2C%20Illinois%29">Mount Carmel Cemetery</a> in <a href="Hillside%2C%20Illinois">Hillside, Illinois</a>.

According to Guy Murchie Jr, from the "<a href="Chicago%20Daily%20Tribune">Chicago Daily Tribune</a>", 33 people died as a consequence of Al Capone.
Capone is one of the most notorious American gangsters of the 20th century and has been the major subject of numerous articles, books, and films. His personality and character have been used in fiction as a model for crime lords and criminal <a href="Mastermind%20%28Role%20Variant%29">masterminds</a> ever since his death. The stereotypical image of a mobster wearing a blue pinstriped suit and tilted <a href="fedora">fedora</a> is based on photos of Capone. His accent, mannerisms, facial construction, physical stature, and <a href="parody">parodies</a> of his name have been used for numerous gangsters in comics, movies, music, and literature.

(When measured in decibels it is <a href="logarithm">logarithm</a>ically related to the power ratio: "G"(dB)=10 log("P /("P)). <a href="Radio%20frequency">RF</a> amplifiers are often specified in terms of the maximum power gain obtainable, while the <a href="voltage">voltage</a> gain of audio amplifiers and <a href="instrumentation%20amplifier">instrumentation amplifier</a>s will be more often specified (since the amplifier's <a href="input%20impedance">input impedance</a> will often be much higher than the source impedance, and the load impedance higher than the amplifier's output impedance). For example, an audio amplifier with a gain given as 20 dB will have a "voltage gain" of ten (but a power gain of 100 would only occur in the event the input and output impedances were identical).

If two equivalent amplifiers are being compared, the amplifier with higher gain settings would be more sensitive as it would take less input signal to produce a given amount of power.

The <a href="bandwidth%20%28signal%20processing%29">bandwidth</a> of an amplifier is the range of frequencies for which the amplifier gives "satisfactory performance". The definition of "satisfactory performance" may be different for different applications. However, a common and well-accepted metric is the <a href="half-power%20point">half-power point</a>s (i.e. frequency where the power goes down by half its peak value) on the output vs. frequency curve. Therefore, bandwidth can be defined as the difference between the lower and upper half power points. This is therefore also known as the bandwidth. Bandwidths (otherwise called "frequency responses") for other response tolerances are sometimes quoted (, etc.) or "plus or minus 1dB" (roughly the sound level difference people usually can detect).

The gain of a good quality full-range audio amplifier will be essentially flat between 20 Hz to about 20 kHz (the range of normal human <a href="Hearing%20%28sense%29">hearing</a>). In ultra high fidelity amplifier design, the amplifier's frequency response should extend considerably beyond this (one or more <a href="Octave%20%28electronics%29">octaves</a> either side) and might have points < 10 Hz and > . Professional touring amplifiers often have input and/or output filtering to sharply limit frequency response beyond ; too much of the amplifier's potential output power would otherwise be wasted on <a href="infrasonic">infrasonic</a> and <a href="Ultrasound">ultrasonic</a> frequencies, and the danger of AM <a href="radio%20interference">radio interference</a> would increase. Modern <a href="switching%20amplifier">switching amplifier</a>s need steep <a href="Low-pass%20filter">low pass filtering</a> at the output to get rid of high frequency switching noise and <a href="harmonic">harmonic</a>s.

The range of frequency over which the gain is equal to or greater than 70.7% of its maximum gain is termed as bandwidth.

Efficiency is a measure of how much of the power source is usefully applied to the amplifier's output. <a href="Electronic%20amplifier%23Power%20amplifier%20classes">Class A</a> amplifiers are very inefficient, in the range of 10–20% with a max efficiency of 25% for <a href="direct%20coupling">direct coupling</a> of the output. <a href="Inductive%20coupling">Inductive coupling</a> of the output can raise their efficiency to a maximum of 50%.

Drain efficiency is the ratio of output RF power to input DC power when primary input DC power has been fed to the drain of a <a href="field-effect%20transistor">field-effect transistor</a>. Based on this definition, the drain efficiency cannot exceed 25% for a class A amplifier that is supplied drain bias current through resistors (because RF signal has its zero level at about 50% of the input DC). Manufacturers specify much higher drain efficiencies, and designers are able to obtain higher efficiencies by providing current to the drain of the transistor through an inductor or a transformer winding. In this case the RF zero level is near the DC rail and will swing both above and below the rail during operation. While the voltage level is above the DC rail current is supplied by the inductor.

Class B amplifiers have a very high efficiency but are impractical for audio work because of high levels of distortion (See: <a href="Crossover%20distortion">Crossover distortion</a>). In practical design, the result of a tradeoff is the class AB design. Modern Class AB amplifiers commonly have peak efficiencies between 30–55% in audio systems and 50-70% in radio frequency systems with a theoretical maximum of 78.5%.

Commercially available Class D <a href="switching%20amplifier">switching amplifier</a>s have reported efficiencies as high as 90%. Amplifiers of Class C-F are usually known to be very high efficiency amplifiers. RCA manufactured an AM broadcast transmitter employing a single class-C low mu triode with an RF efficiency in the 90% range.

More efficient amplifiers run cooler, and often do not need any cooling fans even in multi-kilowatt designs. The reason for this is that the loss of efficiency produces heat as a by-product of the energy lost during the conversion of power. In more efficient amplifiers there is less loss of energy so in turn less heat.

In RF linear Power Amplifiers, such as cellular base stations and broadcast transmitters, special design techniques can be used to improve efficiency. Doherty designs, which use a second output stage as a "peak" amplifier, can lift efficiency from the typical 15% up to 30-35% in a narrow bandwidth. Envelope Tracking designs are able to achieve efficiencies of up to 60%, by modulating the supply voltage to the amplifier in line with the envelope of the signal.

An ideal amplifier would be a totally linear device, but real amplifiers are only linear within limits.

When the signal drive to the amplifier is increased, the output also increases until a point is reached where some part of the amplifier becomes saturated and cannot produce any more output; this is called clipping, and results in <a href="distortion">distortion</a>.

In most amplifiers a reduction in gain takes place before hard clipping occurs; the result is a "compression" effect, which (if the amplifier is an audio amplifier) sounds much less unpleasant to the ear. For these amplifiers, the 1 dB compression point is defined as the input power (or output power) where the gain is 1 dB less than the small signal gain. Sometimes this non linearity is deliberately designed in to reduce the audible unpleasantness of hard clipping under overload.

Ill effects of non-linearity can be reduced with negative feedback.

<a href="Linearization">Linearization</a> is an emergent field, and there are many techniques, such as <a href="Feed%20forward%20%28control%29">feed forward</a>, <a href="predistortion">predistortion</a>, postdistortion, in order to avoid the undesired effects of the non-linearities.

This is a measure of how much <a href="noise">noise</a> is introduced in the amplification process. Noise is an undesirable but inevitable product of the electronic devices and components; also, much noise results from intentional economies of manufacture and design time. The metric for noise performance of a circuit is <a href="noise%20figure">noise figure</a> or noise factor. Noise figure is a comparison between the output signal to noise ratio and the thermal noise of the input signal.

Output <a href="dynamic%20range">dynamic range</a> is the range, usually given in dB, between the smallest and largest useful output levels. The lowest useful level is limited by output <a href="noise">noise</a>, while the largest is limited most often by distortion. The ratio of these two is quoted as the amplifier dynamic range. More precisely, if "S" = maximal allowed signal power and "N" = noise power, the dynamic range "DR" is "DR = (S + N ) /N".

In many switched mode amplifiers, dynamic range is limited by the minimum output step size.

<a href="Slew%20rate">Slew rate</a> is the maximum rate of change of the output, usually quoted in volts per second (or microsecond). Many amplifiers are ultimately <a href="slew%20rate">slew rate</a> limited (typically by the impedance of a drive current having to overcome capacitive effects at some point in the circuit), which sometimes limits the full <a href="power%20bandwidth">power bandwidth</a> to frequencies well below the amplifier's small-signal frequency response.

The <a href="rise%20time">rise time</a>, t, of an amplifier is the time taken for the output to change from 10% to 90% of its final level when driven by a <a href="step%20response">step input</a>.
For a <a href="Gaussian">Gaussian</a> response system (or a simple RC <a href="roll-off">roll off</a>), the rise time is approximated by:

t * BW = 0.35, where t is rise time in <a href="second">second</a>s and BW is bandwidth in <a href="hertz">Hz</a>.

The time taken for the output to settle to within a certain percentage of the final value (for instance 0.1%) is called the <a href="settling%20time">settling time</a>, and is usually specified for oscilloscope vertical amplifiers and high accuracy measurement systems. <a href="Ringing%20%28signal%29">Ringing</a> refers to an output variation that cycles above and below an amplifier's final value and leads to a delay in reaching a stable output. Ringing is the result of overshoot caused by an <a href="Damping%23Under-damping%20%280%20%E2%89%A4%20%CE%B6%20%26lt%3B%201%29">underdamped</a> circuit.

In response to a step input, the <a href="overshoot%20%28signal%29">overshoot</a> is the amount the output exceeds its final, steady-state value.

Stability is an issue in all amplifiers with feedback, whether that feedback is added intentionally or results unintentionally. It is especially an issue when applied over multiple amplifying stages.

<a href="BIBO%20stability">Stability</a> is a major concern in <a href="Radio%20frequency">RF</a> and <a href="microwave">microwave</a> amplifiers. The degree of an amplifier's stability can be quantified by a so-called stability factor. There are several different stability factors, such as the Stern stability factor and the Linvil stability factor, which specify a condition that must be met for the absolute stability of an amplifier in terms of its <a href="two-port%20parameters">two-port parameters</a>.

Army of Darkness

Army of Darkness (also known as Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness and Army of Darkness: The Medieval Dead on its UK theatrical release) is a 1992 American <a href="Comedy%20horror">horror comedy</a> film directed and co-written by <a href="Sam%20Raimi">Sam Raimi</a>, co-produced by <a href="Robert%20Tapert">Robert Tapert</a> and <a href="Bruce%20Campbell">Bruce Campbell</a> and co-written by <a href="Ivan%20Raimi">Ivan Raimi</a>. It stars Campbell and <a href="Embeth%20Davidtz">Embeth Davidtz</a>. It is the third installment in the "<a href="Evil%20Dead">Evil Dead</a>" franchise, and continuing from "<a href="Evil%20Dead%20II">Evil Dead II</a>," <a href="Ash%20Williams">Ash Williams</a> (Campbell) is trapped in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.

The film was produced as part of a production deal with <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a> after the financial success of "<a href="Darkman">Darkman</a>". Filming took place in California in 1991. The makeup and creature effects for the film were handled by two different companies: <a href="Tony%20Gardner%20%28designer%29">Tony Gardner</a> and his company <a href="Alterian%2C%20Inc.">Alterian, Inc.</a> were responsible for the Ash & Sheila Makeup Effects, while Kurtzman, Nicotero & Berger EFX Group was credited for the remaining Special Makeup Effects characters.

"Army of Darkness" premiered at the <a href="Sitges%20Film%20Festival">Sitges Film Festival</a> on October 9, 1992, and was released in the United States on February 19, 1993. It grossed $21.5 million total over a $11 million budget, and received positive reviews, though notably less than the first two films. Since its video release it has acquired a massive <a href="Cult%20film">cult following</a>, along with the other two films in the trilogy. The film was dedicated to <a href="Irvin%20Shapiro">Irvin Shapiro</a>, who died during the film's production in 1989 on New Year's Day.

<a href="Evil%20Dead%20II">Being transported to the Middle Ages</a>, <a href="Ash%20Williams">Ash Williams</a> is captured by <a href="King%20Arthur">Lord Arthur</a>'s men, who suspect him an agent for Duke Henry, with whom Arthur is at war. He is enslaved along with the captured Henry, his gun and chainsaw confiscated, and is taken to a castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he kills a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur's Wise Man. After demanding Henry and his men be set free, as he knew it was a <a href="Witch-hunt">witch hunt</a>, and killing a Deadite publicly, Ash is celebrated as a hero. He grows attracted to Sheila, the sister of one of Arthur's fallen knights.

According to the Wise Man, the only way Ash can return to his time is through the magical "<a href="Necronomicon%23In%20popular%20culture">Necronomicon Ex-Mortis</a>." Ash then starts his search for the "Necronomicon". As he enters a haunted forest, an unseen force pursues Ash into a windmill, crashing into a mirror. Small reflections of Ash in the mirror shards come to life, with one becoming a life-sized clone, after which Ash kills and buries it. 

When he arrives at the "Necronomicon"s location, he finds three books instead of one and determines which is the actual book. Attempting to say the phrase that will allow him to remove the book safely "<a href="Klaatu%20barada%20nikto">Klaatu barada nikto</a>" he forgets and tries to unsuccessfully mumble and cough "nikto". He then grabs it and rushes back, while the dead and his evil copy resurrect, uniting into the Army of Darkness.

Upon return, Ash demands to be returned to his own time. However, Sheila is captured by a Flying Deadite, and later transformed into one. Ash becomes determined to lead the humans against the Army and the people reluctantly agree. Using knowledge from textbooks in his 1973 <a href="Oldsmobile%2088">Oldsmobile Delta 88</a>, and enlisting the help of Duke Henry, Ash successfully leads the medieval soldiers to victory over the Deadites and Evil Ash, saving Sheila and bringing peace between Arthur and Henry. The Wise Men return him to the present by giving him a potion after reciting the phrase.

Back in the present, Ash recounts his story to a fellow employee at his job, working in "S-Mart". As he talks to a girl who is interested in his story, a surviving Deadite, allowed to come to the present due to Ash again forgetting the last word, attacks the customers. Ash kills it using a <a href="Winchester%20rifle">Winchester rifle</a> from the Sporting Goods department, finally ending the threat.

The original ending, preferred by Raimi and Campbell themselves, is one in which Ash is shown being placed in a cave and given a potion which will put him to sleep for centuries. Echoing his experience in botching the recovery of the "Necronomicon", Ash mishandles the specific instructions for the potion, accidentally taking an extra dose. Ash awakes and arises from his cave to find himself in a post-apocalyptic future, in which the city of London is in ruins.

The original ending was restored to the film for the UK <a href="VHS">VHS</a> release, which also had the S-Mart ending put in as a post-credit extra. This scene has been restored on the "Army of Darkness: Director's Cut" Region 3 <a href="DVD">DVD</a> released by <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>, the "director's cut bootleg edition" DVD and the double-disc DVD, which also featured the S-Mart ending of the film. The S-Mart ending was shot for the American release.


Plans to make a third "<a href="Evil%20Dead">Evil Dead</a>" film had been circulating for a number of years, even prior to the production of "<a href="Darkman">Darkman</a>". "<a href="Evil%20Dead%20II">Evil Dead II</a>" made enough money internationally that <a href="Dino%20De%20Laurentiis">Dino De Laurentiis</a> was willing to finance a sequel. Director and script writer <a href="Sam%20Raimi">Sam Raimi</a> drew from a variety of sources, including literature with "<a href="A%20Connecticut%20Yankee%20in%20King%20Arthur%27s%20Court">A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</a>" and <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a>'s "<a href="Gulliver%27s%20Travels">Gulliver's Travels</a>" and films like "<a href="The%20Seventh%20Voyage%20of%20Sinbad">The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad</a>", "<a href="Jason%20and%20the%20Argonauts%20%281963%20film%29">Jason and the Argonauts</a>", <a href="The%20Three%20Stooges">The Three Stooges</a>, and "<a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian%20%281982%20film%29">Conan The Barbarian</a>". "Evil Dead II", according to <a href="Bruce%20Campbell">Bruce Campbell</a>, "was originally designed to go back into the past to 1300, but we couldn't muster it at the time, so we decided to make an interim version, not knowing if the 1300 story would ever get made". Promotional drawings were created and published in "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" during the casting process before the budget was deemed too little for the plot. The working title for the project was "Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness". The title "Army of Darkness" came from an idea by <a href="Irvin%20Shapiro">Irvin Shapiro</a>, during the production of "Evil Dead II".

Initially, Raimi invited <a href="Scott%20Spiegel">Scott Spiegel</a> to co-write "Army of Darkness" because he had done a good job on "Evil Dead II", but he was busy on rewrites for the <a href="Clint%20Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a> film "<a href="The%20Rookie%20%281990%20film%29">The Rookie</a>". After the good experience of writing the screenplay for a film called "Easy Wheels", Sam and his brother <a href="Ivan%20Raimi">Ivan</a> decided to co-write the film together. They worked on the script throughout the pre-production and production of "Darkman". After filming "Darkman", they took the script out and worked on it in more detail. Raimi says that Ivan "has a good sense of character" and that he brought more comedy into the script. Campbell remembers, "We all decided, 'Get him out of the cabin.' There were earlier drafts where part three still took place there, but we thought, 'Well, we all know that cabin, it's time to move on.' The three of us decided to keep it in 1300, because it's more interesting". Campbell and Tapert would read the script drafts, give Raimi their notes and he would decide which suggestions to keep and which ones to discard.

The initial budget was $8 million but during pre-production, it became obvious that this was not going to be enough. "Darkman" was also a financial success and De Laurentiis had a multi-picture deal with Universal and so "Army of Darkness" became one of the films. The studio decided to contribute half of the film's $12 million budget. However, the film's ambitious scope and its extensive effects work forced Campbell, Raimi and producer <a href="Robert%20Tapert">Robert Tapert</a> to put up $1 million of their collective salaries to shoot a new ending and not film a scene where a possessed woman pushes down some giant pillars. Visual effects supervisor William Mesa showed Raimi storyboards he had from <a href="Victor%20Fleming">Victor Fleming</a>'s film "<a href="Joan%20of%20Arc%20%281948%20film%29">Joan of Arc</a>" that depicted huge battle scenes and he picked out 25 shots to use in "Army of Darkness". A storyboard artist worked closely with the director in order to blend the shots from the "Joan of Arc" storyboards with the battle scenes in his film.

<a href="Traci%20Lords">Traci Lords</a> was among the actresses auditioning for the film, saying in 2001, "I didn't get the part but I clicked with Bruce [Campbell]," with whom she would later work as a guest star in the TV series "".

<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> took place between soundstage and on-location work. "Army of Darkness" was filmed in <a href="Bronson%20Canyon">Bronson Canyon</a> and <a href="Vasquez%20Rocks">Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park</a>. The interior shots were filmed on an <a href="Front%20projection">Introvision</a> stage in <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. Raimi's use of the Introvision process was a tribute to the <a href="stop-motion%20animation">stop-motion animation</a> work of <a href="Ray%20Harryhausen">Ray Harryhausen</a>. Introvision uses front-projected images with live actors instead of the traditional <a href="rear%20projection">rear projection</a> that Harryhausen and others used. Introvision blended components with more realistic-looking results. To achieve this effect, Raimi used 60-foot-tall Scotchlite front-projection screens, miniatures and background plates. According to the director, the advantage of using this technique was "the incredible amount of interaction between the background, which doesn't exist, and the foreground, which is usually your character".

Shooting began in mid-1991, and it lasted for about 100 days. It was a mid-summer shoot and while on location on a huge castle set that was built near <a href="Acton%2C%20California">Acton</a>, California on the edge of the <a href="Mojave%20Desert">Mojave Desert</a>, the cast and crew endured very hot conditions during the day and very cold temperatures at night. Most of the film took place at night and the filmmakers shot most of the film during the summer when the days were longest and the nights were the shortest. It would take an hour and a half to light an area leaving the filmmakers only six hours left to shoot a scene. Money problems forced cinematographer <a href="Bill%20Pope">Bill Pope</a> to shoot only for certain hours Monday through Friday because he could not be paid his standard fee. Mesa shot many of the action sequences on the weekend.

It was a difficult shoot for Campbell who had to learn elaborate choreography for the battle scenes, which involved him remembering a number system because the actor was often fighting opponents that were not really there. Mesa remembers, "Bruce was cussing and swearing some of the time because you had to work on the number system. Sam would tell us to make it as complicated and hard for Bruce as possible. 'Make him go through torture!' So we'd come up with these shots that were really, really difficult, and sometimes they would take thirty-seven takes". Some scenes, like Evil Ash walking along the graveyard while his skeleton minions come to life, blended stop-motion animation with live skeletons that were mechanically rigged, with prosthetics and visual effects.

While <a href="Dino%20De%20Laurentiis">Dino De Laurentiis</a> gave Raimi and his crew freedom to shoot the film the way they wanted, Universal took over during post-production. Universal was not happy with Raimi's cut because it did not like his original ending, feeling it was negative. A more upbeat ending was shot a month later in a lumber store in Malibu, California. Then, two months after principal filming was finished, a round of re-shoots began in Santa Monica and involved Ash in the windmill and the scenes with <a href="Bridget%20Fonda">Bridget Fonda</a>. Raimi recalls, "Actually, I kind of like the fact that there are two endings, that in one alternate universe Bruce is screwed, and in another universe he's some cheesy hero".

Raimi needed $3 million to finish his film, but Universal was not willing to give him the money and delayed its release due to a dispute with De Laurentiis over the rights to the <a href="Hannibal%20Lecter">Hannibal Lecter</a> character which Universal needed so that they could film a <a href="Hannibal%20%28film%29">sequel</a> to "<a href="The%20Silence%20of%20the%20Lambs%20%28film%29">The Silence of the Lambs</a>". The matter was finally resolved, but the release date for "Army of Darkness"' was pushed back from summer of 1992 to February 1993.

For the film's poster, Universal brought Campbell in to take several reference head shots and asked him to strike a sly look on his face. They showed him a rough of the <a href="Frank%20Frazetta">Frank Frazetta</a>-like painting. The actor had a day to approve it or, as he was told, there would be no ad campaign for the film. Raimi ran into further troubles when the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America">MPAA</a> gave it an NC-17 rating for a shot of a female Deadite being decapitated early on in the film. Universal wanted a PG-13 rating, so Raimi made a few cuts and was still stuck with an R rating. In response, Universal turned the film over to outside film editors who cut the film to 81 minutes and another version running 87 minutes that was eventually released in theaters, still with an R rating.

<a href="Danny%20Elfman">Danny Elfman</a>, who composed the score for "Darkman", wrote the "March of the Dead" theme for "Army of Darkness". After the re-shoots were completed, <a href="Joseph%20LoDuca">Joseph LoDuca</a>, who composed the music for "<a href="The%20Evil%20Dead">The Evil Dead</a>" and "<a href="Evil%20Dead%20II">Evil Dead II</a>", returned to score the film. The composer used his knowledge of synthesizers and was able to present many cues in a mock-up form before he recorded them with the <a href="Seattle%20Symphony">Seattle Symphony</a>. The score was released during the <a href="MondoCon">MondoCon</a> in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a> on October 3 and 4, 2015, on <a href="Gramophone%20record">Vinyl</a>, over <a href="Mondo%20Records">Mondo Records</a>.

"Army of Darkness" was released by Universal on February 19, 1993 in 1,387 theaters in the United States, grossing $4.4 million (38.5% of total gross) on its first weekend. In total, the film earned $11.5 million in the US.

The film currently holds a 72% "Fresh" rating on the review aggregate website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, based on 46 reviews, which made its critical reception above average but much lower than "<a href="The%20Evil%20Dead">The Evil Dead</a>" and "<a href="Evil%20Dead%20II">Evil Dead II</a>", which received 96% and 98% respectively. On <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, the film holds a score of 57 out of 100, indicating "mixed or average reviews". <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> gave the film two out of four stars and wrote, "The movie isn't as funny or entertaining as "Evil Dead II", however, maybe because the comic approach seems recycled." In her review for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> praised, "Mr. Campbell's manly, mock-heroic posturing is perfectly in keeping with the director's droll outlook." Desson Howe, in this review for "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" praised the film's style: "Bill Pope's cinematography is gymnastic and appropriately frenetic. The visual and make-up effects (from artist-technicians William Mesa, <a href="Tony%20Gardner%20%28designer%29">Tony Gardner</a> and others) are incredibly imaginative." However, "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" gave the film a "C+" rating and wrote, "This spoofy cast of thousands looks a little too much like a crew of bland <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood extras</a>. By the time "Army of Darkness" turns into a retread of "<a href="Jason%20and%20the%20Argonauts%20%281963%20film%29">Jason and the Argonauts</a>", featuring an army of fighting skeletons, the film has fallen into a ditch between parody and spectacle."

"Army of Darkness" won the <a href="Saturn%20Award%20for%20Best%20Horror%20Film">Saturn Award for Best Horror Film</a> (1994). It was also nominated for <a href="Saturn%20Award%20for%20Best%20Make-up">Best Make-Up</a>. "Army of Darkness" was nominated for the Grand Prize at Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival, and won the Golden Raven at the <a href="Brussels%20International%20Fantastic%20Film%20Festival">Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film</a> in 1993. The film also won the Critics' Award at <a href="Fantasporto">Fantasporto</a>, and was nominated for the International Fantasy Film Award in the category of Best Film in 1993. It was also nominated for Best Film at <a href="Sitges%20Film%20Festival">Sitges</a>, the Spanish International Film Festival.

In March 2013, shortly before the release of "<a href="Evil%20Dead%20%282013%20film%29">Evil Dead</a>", a reboot and loose continuation of the franchise, Raimi confirmed that the next "Evil Dead" film will be "Army of Darkness 2". Campbell confirmed that he would star as an older, but not necessarily wiser, Ash. At a <a href="WonderCon">WonderCon</a> panel in March 2013, Campbell and <a href="Fede%20Alvarez">Fede Alvarez</a>, director of the reboot, stated that their ultimate plan was for Alvarez's "Evil Dead 2" and Raimi's "Army of Darkness 2" to be followed by a seventh film which would merge the narratives of Ash and Mia. On October 18, 2013, Campbell once again confirmed in an interview with ComicBook.com that he will be reprising his role as Ash in the sequel. Fede Alvarez posted a status update on his Twitter account that Raimi will direct the sequel. Campbell later commented that the rumor about him returning is false.

In July 2014, Campbell stated it was likely the planned sequel would instead be a TV series with him as the star.

RUR-5 ASROC

The RUR-5 ASROC (for "Anti-Submarine ROCket") is an all-weather, all sea-conditions anti-submarine missile system. Developed by the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> in the 1950s, it was deployed in the 1960s, updated in the 1990s, and eventually installed on over 200 USN surface ships, specifically <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s, <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, and <a href="frigate">frigate</a>s. The ASROC has been deployed on scores of warships of many other navies, including Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of China, Greece, Pakistan and others.

ASROC started development as the Rocket Assisted Torpedo (RAT) program by the <a href="Naval%20Air%20Weapons%20Station%20China%20Lake">Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake</a> in the early 1950s to develop a surface warship <a href="Anti-submarine%20warfare">ASW</a> weapon counter to the new post-World War II submarines which ran quieter, at much higher speed and could attack from much longer range with high speed homing torpedoes. In addition, the goal was to take advantage of modern sonars with a much larger detection range. An extended range torpedo delivered by parachute from the air would allow warships the stand-off capability to attack hostile submarines with very little advance notice to the hostile submarine. The RAT program came in three phases: RAT-A, RAT-B and RAT-C. RAT-A (and its follow-on, RAT-B) were efforts to develop a compact and economical stand-off ASW for smaller warships, but were found to be either unreliable or had too short a range. RAT-C was a program to develop a stand-off ASW weapon that used a nuclear depth charge. This would require a range of at least 8,000 yards to escape potential damage from the underwater blast. Unlike the original RAT program rockets, the RAT-C was considerably larger to accomplish the extended range needed and was to be fitted to larger warships. With the failure of both the RAT-A and RAT-B programs, RAT-C was redesigned from a stand-off nuclear ASW weapon to one that could use not only a nuclear depth charge but also a homing ASW torpedo. To obtain the accuracy needed, the RAT-C rocket launcher had to be redesigned with larger side fins. This program finally combined reliability and accuracy, along with the necessary stand-off range. However, before RAT-C reached initial operational status in 1960 aboard the large US Navy <a href="destroyer%20leader">destroyer leader</a> , its name was changed to the present ASROC.

The first ASROC system using the MK-112 "Matchbox" launcher, was developed in the 1950s and installed in the 1960s. This system was phased out in the 1990s and replaced with the <a href="RUM-139%20VL-ASROC">RUM-139 Vertical Launch ASROC</a>, or "VLA".

After a surface ship, patrol plane or anti-submarine helicopter detects an enemy <a href="submarine">submarine</a> by using <a href="sonar">sonar</a> or other sensors, it could relay the sub's position to an ASROC-equipped ship for attack. The attacking ship would then fire an ASROC missile carrying an acoustic homing <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> or a W44 <a href="Nuclear%20Depth%20Bomb">Nuclear Depth Bomb</a> onto an unguided ballistic trajectory toward the target. At a pre-determined point on the missile's trajectory, the payload separates from the missile and deploys a parachute to permit splashdown and water entry at a low speed and with minimum detectable noise. Water entry activates the torpedo, which is guided by its own sonar system, and homes in on the target using either <a href="active%20sonar">active sonar</a> or <a href="passive%20sonar">passive sonar</a>.

The W44 nuclear depth charge entered service in 1961, but was never used beyond one or two tests before the Limited <a href="Nuclear%20Test%20Ban%20Treaty">Nuclear Test Ban Treaty</a> banning underwater nuclear tests went into effect. A total of 575 weapons were produced. The W44 weighed with a diameter of and length of . Following payload separation, the unguided W44 sank quickly to a predetermined depth where the 10-<a href="kiloton">kiloton</a> warhead detonated. The nuclear-armed ASROC was never used in combat. W44-armed ASROC missiles were retired by 1989, when all types of nuclear depth bombs were removed from deployment.

The 31 <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> s were all built with the Mark 16 Mod 7 ASROC Launching Group and MK 4 ASROC Weapons Handling System (AWHS) reload system. These had one standard Mark 112 octuple ASROC launcher, located immediately above a reload system holding an additional 16 assembled rounds (two complete reloads of eight missiles apiece). Thus, each "Spruance"-class destroyer originally carried a maximum total of 24 ASROC.

Most other US Navy and allied navy destroyers, destroyer escorts, frigates, and several different classes of cruisers only carried the one ASROC 'matchbox' MK 112 launcher with eight ASROC missiles (although later in service, some of those missiles could be replaced by the <a href="Harpoon%20%28missile%29">Harpoon</a> anti-ship missile). The "matchbox" Mk 112 launchers were capable of carrying a mixture of the two types. Reloads were carried in many classes, either on first level of the superstructure immediately abaft the launcher, or in a separate deckhouse just forward or abaft the Mk 112.

The MK 16 Launching Group also had configurations that supported RGM-84 Harpoon (onboard destroyer escorts (frigates)) or a variation of the Tartar missile in limited distribution.

Ships with the <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Navy%20Guided%20Missile%20Launching%20System">Mk 26 GMLS</a>, and late marks of the Mk 10 GMLS aboard the s, could accommodate ASROC in these power-loaded launchers (the Mk 13 GMLS was not able to fire the weapon, as the launcher rail was too short).

Most "Spruance"-class destroyers were later modified to include the <a href="Mark%2041%20Vertical%20Launch%20System">Mk 41 VLS</a>, these launchers are capable of carrying a mixture of the <a href="RUM-139%20VL-ASROC">RUM-139 VL-ASROC</a>, the Tomahawk TLAM, and other missiles. All of the "Spruance" destroyers carried two separate quad Harpoon launchers. Other US ships with the Mk 41 can also accommodate VL-ASROC.
