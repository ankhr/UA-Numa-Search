Afghan Turkestan

Afghan Turkestan is a region in northern <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, on the border with the former <a href="Republics%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet republic</a>s of <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a> and <a href="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>. In the 19th century there was a province in Afghanistan named <a href="Turkestan%20Province">Turkestan Province</a> until abolished by <a href="Abdur%20Rahman%20Khan">Abdur Rahman</a>, and was centred on <a href="Mazari%20Sharif">Mazari Sharif</a> and included territory in the modern provinces of <a href="Balkh%20province">Balkh</a>, <a href="Jowzjan%20province">Jowzjan</a>, <a href="Faryab%20province">Faryab</a> and <a href="Sar-e%20Pol%20province">Sar-e Pol</a>. The whole territory, from the junction of the <a href="Kokcha">Kokcha</a> river with the <a href="Amu%20Darya">Amu Darya</a> on the north-east to the province of <a href="Herat%20province">Herat</a> on the south-west, was some in length, with an average width from the Russian frontier to the <a href="Hindu%20Kush">Hindu Kush</a> of 114 miles (183 km). It thus comprised about or roughly two-ninths of the former <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Afghanistan">Kingdom of Afghanistan</a>.

The area is agriculturally poor except in the river valleys, being rough and mountainous towards the south, but subsiding into undulating wastes and pasture-lands towards the <a href="Karakum%20Desert">Karakum Desert</a>.

The province included the khanates of <a href="Kunduz">Kunduz</a>, <a href="Kholm%2C%20Afghanistan">Tashkurgan</a>, <a href="Balkh">Balkh</a>, and <a href="Akcha">Akcha</a> in the east and the four khanates or "Chahar Vidayet" ("four domains") of <a href="Saripul">Saripul</a>, <a href="Shibarghan">Shibarghan</a>, <a href="Andkhui">Andkhui</a> and <a href="Maimana">Maimana</a> in the west.

The bulk of the people are <a href="Uzbek%20people">Uzbek</a> and <a href="Turkmen%20people">Turkmen</a> with large concentrations of <a href="Hazara%20people">Hazara</a>, <a href="Tajik%20people">Tajik</a>, and <a href="Pashtun%20people">Pashtuns</a>.

Ancient Balkh or <a href="Bactria">Bactria</a> was an integral part of <a href="Bactria%E2%80%93Margiana%20Archaeological%20Complex">Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex</a>, and was occupied by <a href="Indo-Iranians">Indo-Iranians</a>. In the 5th century BCE, it became a province of the <a href="Achaemenian%20Empire">Achaemenian Empire</a> and later became part of the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>. About 250 BC <a href="Diodotus%20of%20Bactria">Diodotus (Theodotus)</a>, governor of <a href="Bactria">Bactria</a> under the <a href="Seleucid%20dynasty">Seleucidae</a>, declared his independence, and commenced the history of the Greco-Bactrian dynasties, which succumbed to <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a>n and nomadic movements about 126 BC. After this came a <a href="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> era which has left its traces in the gigantic sculptures at Bamian and the rock-cut topes of Haibak. The district was devastated by <a href="Genghis%20Khan">Genghis Khan</a>, and has never since fully recovered its prosperity. For about a century it belonged to the <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a> empire, and then fell into <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbek</a> hands. In the 18th century it formed part of the dominion of <a href="Ahmad%20Shah%20Durrani">Ahmad Shah Durrani</a>, and so remained under his son Timur. But under the fratricidal wars of Timur's sons the separate khanates fell back under the independent rule of various Uzbek chiefs. At the beginning of the 19th century they belonged to Bukhara; but under the <a href="emir">emir</a> Dost Mahommed the Afghans recovered Balkh and Tashkurgan in 1850, Akcha and the four western khanates in 1855, and Kunduz in 1859. The sovereignty over <a href="Andkhui">Andkhui</a>, <a href="Shibarghan">Shibarghan</a>, <a href="Saripul">Saripul</a>, and Maimana was in dispute between Bukhara and Kabul until settled by the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1873 in favour of the Afghan claim. Under the strong rule of <a href="Abdur%20Rahman%20Khan">Abdur Rahman</a> these outlying territories were closely welded to Kabul; but after the accession of <a href="Habibullah%20Khan">Habibullah</a> the bonds once more relaxed. In the late 19th and 20th centuries, many ethnic Pashtuns either <a href="Pashtun%20colonization%20of%20northern%20Afghanistan">voluntarily or involuntarily settled in Afghan Turkestan</a>.

In 1890, the <a href="district%20of%20Qataghan%20and%20Badakhshan">district of Qataghan and Badakhshan</a> was divided from Afghan Turkestan and made into the <a href="Qataghan-Badakhshan%20Province">Qataghan-Badakhshan Province</a>. Administration of the province was assigned to the <a href="Northern%20Bureau">Northern Bureau</a> in <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a>.

Afyonkarahisar

Afyonkarahisar (, "poppy, opium", "kara" "black", "hisar" "fortress") is a city in western <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, the capital of <a href="Afyonkarahisar%20Province">Afyon Province</a>. Afyon is in mountainous countryside inland from the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a> coast, south-west of <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a> along the Akarçay River. Elevation . Population (2010 census) 173,100 
In Turkey, Afyonkarahisar stands out as a capital city of thermal and spa, an important junction of railway, highway and air traffic in West-Turkey, and the grounds where independence had been won.
In addition, Afyonkarahisar is one of the top leading provinces in agriculture, globally renown for its marble and globally largest producer of pharmaceutical opium.

The name Afyon Kara Hisar (literally "opium black castle" in <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a>), since <a href="opium">opium</a> was widely grown here and there is a castle on a black rock. Also known simply as Afyon. Older spellings include Karahisar-i Sahip, Afium-Kara-hissar and Afyon Karahisar. The city was known as Afyon (opium), until the name was changed to Afyonkarahisar by the <a href="Turkish%20Parliament">Turkish Parliament</a> in 2004.

The top of the rock in Afyon has been fortified for a long time. It was known to the <a href="Hittites">Hittites</a> as Hapanuwa, and was later occupied by <a href="Phrygians">Phrygians</a>, <a href="Lydians">Lydians</a> and <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Persians</a> until it was conquered by <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>. After the death of Alexander the city (now known as Akroinοn (Ακροϊνόν) or Nikopolis (Νικόπολις) in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>), was ruled by the <a href="Seleucids">Seleucids</a> and the kings of <a href="Pergamon">Pergamon</a>, then <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Rome</a> and <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantium</a>. The <a href="List%20of%20Byzantine%20Emperors">Byzantine emperor</a> <a href="Leo%20III%20the%20Isaurian">Leo III</a> after his <a href="Battle%20of%20Akroinon">victory</a> over <a href="Arab">Arab</a> besiegers in 740 renamed the city Nicopolis (Greek for "city of victory"). The <a href="Seljuq%20Turks">Seljuq Turks</a> then arrived in 1071 and changed its name to Kara Hissar ("black castle") after the ancient fortress situated upon a volcanic rock 201 meters above the town. Following the dispersal of the Seljuqs the town was occupied by the <a href="S%C3%A2hib%20Ata">Sâhib Ata</a> and then the <a href="Germiyanids">Germiyanids</a>.

The castle was much fought over during the <a href="Crusades">Crusades</a> and was finally conquered by the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> Sultan <a href="Beyazid%20I">Beyazid I</a> in 1392 but was lost after the invasion of <a href="Timur%20Lenk">Timur Lenk</a> in 1402. It was recaptured in 1428 or 1429.

The area thrived during the Ottoman Empire, as the centre of opium production and Afyon became a wealthy city. During the 1st World War British prisoners of war who had been captured at Gallipoli were housed here in an empty Armenian church at the foot of the rock. During the <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281919-1922%29">Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)</a> campaign (part of the <a href="Turkish%20War%20of%20Independence">Turkish War of Independence</a>) Afyon and the surrounding hills were occupied by Greek forces. However, it was recovered on 27 August 1922, a key moment in the Turkish counter-attack in the Aegean region. After 1923 Afyon became a part of the Republic of Turkey.

The region was a major producer of raw opium (hence the name "Afyon") until the late 1960s when under international pressure, from the USA in particular, the fields were burnt and production ceased. Now poppies are grown under a strict licensing regime. They do not produce raw opium any more but derive Morphine and other opiates using the <a href="poppy%20straw">poppy straw</a> method of extraction.

Afyon was depicted on the <a href="Obverse%20and%20reverse">reverse</a> of the Turkish 50 <a href="Turkish%20lira">lira</a> banknote of 1927-1938.

The economy of Afyonkarahisar is based on agriculture, industries and thermal tourism. 
Especially its agriculture is strongly developed from the fact, a large part of its population living in the countrysides. Which stimulated agricultural activities greatly.

Afyonkarahisar produces an important chunk of Turkish processed marbles, it ranks second on processed marble exports and fourth on travertine. Afyon holds an important share of Turkish marble reserves, with some 12,2% of total Turkish reserves.

Afyon has unique marble types and colors, which were historically very renown and are unique to Afyon. Like "Afyon white", historically known as "Synnadic white". "Afyon Menekse", historically known as "Pavonazzetto" and "Afyon kaplan postu", this type wasn't popular.
Historically marble from Afyon was generally referred to as "Docimeaen marble".
Docimian marble was highly admired and valued for its unique colors and fine grained quality, by ancients such as Romans. When the Romans took control over Docimian quarries, they were blown away about the beautiful color combinations of Docimian Pavonazzetto, which is a type of white marble with purple veins. A trend started about it right away. Emperors Augustus, Trajan, Hadrian, all made extensive use of Docimian marble to all their major building projects.

Docimian Pavonazzetto was extensively used in major building projects in the very heart of Rome aka Forum Romanum and all over the empire. Pavonazzetto was used on the most eye catching places such as, columns, wall and floor veneer and wall reliefs. Other marbles from all corners of the empire were used in combination, whenever Pavonazzetto was used as floor cover, it was usually in combination with other decorative marbles. But, the Pavonazzetto being a white marble was mostly the dominant color and gave the buildings a freshening white color. 

One of the greatest Roman architectural piece, the Pantheon contains Docimian Pavonazzetto as floor pavement along with other marble types. The dominant white color is the Pavonazzetto, also some of the interior main columns and pilasters are made from Docimian marble.
Other buildings in Roman capital which contains or contained Docimian marble were, 
Forum of Augustus, Forum of Trajan (floor and 184 column shafts), Temple of Mars Ultor (floor), Temple of Apollo (floor), Basilica Aemelia (20 statues), Basilica Julia (floor and some columns), Basilica Ulpia (some of the columns),
Basilica San Paolo Fuori Le Mura (24 columns, destroyed by fire in 1823),
The eight statues on the Arch of Constantine,
The greatest Roman bath, Baths of Caracalla (some of the columns and wall veneer.

Other major buildings outside Italy, Rome were :

The Hagia Sophia, one of the greatest buildings ever built, has Docimian marble as veneer on the aisles and galleries.

The heart of Catholic Christianity, Saint Peter's Basilica, as veneer.

Lepcis Magna, former limestone columns were replaced with Pavonazzetto. 
Library of Celsus, the columns on the famous wall.

Ancient City of Sagalassos, as wall and floor covering, 40 tons of veneer were recovered.

Temple of Zeus and Hera in Greece, 100 columns and wall.

Docimian marble was also preferred for sarcophagi sculpting, some emperors preferred this marble for its high value and majestic looks. As a result, one of the greatest masterpieces were made from this material. Such as sarcophagus of, Sidamara, Silifkeh, Seleukeia, Eudocia, Heraclius...several hundreds sarcophagi were constructed.

The geography of Afyon has great geothermal activity. Hence, the place has plenty thermal springs, there are about 5 main springs. Each of them have high mineral contents and high degree's, 40 °C-100 °C. The waters have strong healing properties to some diseases.
As a result, plenty of thermals commenced over time.

In time Afyon has developed it's thermal sector with more capacity, comfort and innovation. Afyon combined the traditional bath houses with 5 star resorts, the health benefits of the natural springs have put the thermal resorts further then a mere attraction.
Hospitals and universities have come in association with thermal resorts, to utilize the full health potentials of the thermals. 
As such, Kocatepe University Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Hospital opened for that purpose. 
Afyon now has the largest residence capacity of thermal resorts, of which a large part are 5 star thermal hotels which give medical care with qualified personnel.

Kizilay, was the first mineral water factory in Turkey which opened in Afyon, in 1926 by Atatürk. After the mineral water from Gazligöl springs, healed Ataturks kidneys and proved its health benefits. Since its foundation, "Kizilay Spa Water" grew as the biggest spa water distributor in Turkey, Middle-East and Balkans.

Almost a third of all the morphine produced in the world derives from alkaloids factory in Afyon, named as "Afyon Alkaloids". this large capacity is the byproduct of Afyon's poppy plantations. The pharmaceuticals derive from the opium of the poppy capsules. 
"Afyon Alkaloids" factory is the largest of its kind in the world, with high capacity processing ability and modern laboratories. The raw opium is put through a chain of biochemical processes, resulting into several types of morphine.

In the Alkaloid Extraction Unit only base morphine is produced. In the adjacent Derivatives Unit half of the morphine extracted is converted to morphine hydrochloride, codeine, codeine phosphate, codeine sulphate, codeine hydrochloride, morphine sulphate, ethylmorphine hydrochloride.

Livestocks
Afyon breeds a large amount of livestocks, its landscape and demography is suitable for this field. As such it ranks in the top 10 within Turkey in terms of amounts of sheep and cattle it has.

Meat and meat products
As a result of being an important source of livestock, related sectors such as meat and meat products are also very productive in afyon. Its one of the leading provinces in red meat production and has very prestigious brand marks of sausages, such as "Cumhuriyet Sausages".

Eggs
Afyon is the sole leader in egg production within Turkey. It has the largest amount of laying hens, with a figure of 12,7 million. And produces a record amount of 6 million eggs per day.

Cherries and sour cherries
Sour cherries are cultivated in Afyon in very large numbers, so much so that it became very iconic to Afyon. Every year, a sour cherry festival takes place in the Cay district. It is the largest producer of sour cherries in Turkey. The sour cherries grown in Afyon are of excellent quality because of the ideal climate they're grown in. For the same reason Afyon is also an ideal place for cherry cultivation. First quality cherries known as "Napolyon Cherries" are grown in abundance, its one of the top 5 leading provinces.
Poppy
One of the iconic agricultural practices of Afyon is the cultivation of poppy. Afyon's climate is ideal for the cultivation of this plant, hence a large amount of poppy plantation occurs in this region. Though, a strong limitation came some decades ago from international laws, cause of the opium content of poppy plants peels. Nevertheless, Afyon is the largest producer of poppy in Turkey and accounts for a large amount of global production.

Potatoes and sugar-beets
Afyon has a durable reputation in potato production, it produces around 8% of Turkish potato need. It ranks in the top 5 in potato, sugar-beets, cucumber and barley production.

Afyonkarahisar has a hot and dry summer <a href="continental%20climate">continental climate</a> (Dsa) under the <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen</a> classification and a hot summer continental (Dca) or hot summer oceanic climate (Doa) under the <a href="Trewartha%20climate%20classification">Trewartha</a> classification. The winters are cold and snowy winters and the summers are hot and dry with cool nights. Rainfall occurs mostly during the spring and autumn.

Afyon is the centre of an agricultural area and the city has a country town feel to it. There is little in the way of bars, cafes, live music or other cultural amenities, and the standards of education are low for a city in the west of Turkey. However <a href="Afyon%20Kocatepe%20University">Afyon Kocatepe University</a> opened in the 1990s and this must surely lead to improvements eventually.
Nowadays Afyon is known for its <a href="marble">marble</a> (in 2005 there were 355 marble quarries in the province of Afyon producing high quality white stone), its "<a href="sucuk">sucuk</a>" (spiced sausages), its "<a href="kaymak">kaymak</a>" (meaning either "cream" or a white <a href="Turkish%20Delight">Turkish Delight</a>) and various handmade weavings. There is also a large cement factory.

This is a natural crossroads, the routes from <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a> to <a href="%C4%B0zmir">İzmir</a> and from <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> to <a href="Antalya">Antalya</a> intersect here and Afyon is a popular stopping-place on these journeys.

Abba Arika

Abba Arikha (175–247) (<a href="Jewish%20Babylonian%20Aramaic">Talmudic Aramaic</a>: ; born: "Abba bar Aybo", <a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a>: רב אבא בר איבו) was a Jewish <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a>ist who was born and lived in <a href="Kafri">Kafri</a>, <a href="Sassanid%20Asuristan">Sassanid Babylonia</a>, known as an <a href="Amoraim">amora</a> (commentator on the <a href="Oral%20Law">Oral Law</a>) of the 3rd century who established at <a href="Sura%20%28city%29">Sura</a> the systematic study of the <a href="rabbinic">rabbinic</a> traditions, which, using the "<a href="Mishnah">Mishnah</a>" as text, led to the compilation of the "<a href="Talmud">Talmud</a>". With him began the long period of ascendancy of the great academies of Babylonia , around the year 220. He is commonly known simply as Rav (or Rab, <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>: ).

His surname, Arikha (English, "Long"—that is, "Tall"; it occurs only once—"Hullin" 137b), he owed to his height, which, according to a reliable record, exceeded that of his contemporaries. Others, reading Arekha, consider it an honorary title, "Lecturer" (Weiss, "Dor," iii. 147; Jastrow, "Dictionary" under the word). In the traditional literature he is referred to almost exclusively as Rav, "the Master", (both his contemporaries and posterity recognizing in him a master), just as his teacher, <a href="Judah%20HaNasi">Judah I</a>, was known simply as Rabbi. He is called Rabbi Abba only in the "<a href="tannaitic">tannaitic</a>" literature (for instance, "Tosefta", "Beitzah " 1:7), where a number of his sayings are preserved. He occupies a middle position between the "Tannaim" and the "Amoraim", and is accorded the right, rarely conceded to one who is only an " 'amora", of disputing the opinion of a "tanna" ("Bava Batra " 42a and elsewhere).

Rav was a descendant of a distinguished Babylonian family which claimed to trace its origin to <a href="Shimei">Shimei</a>, brother of <a href="King%20David">King David</a> ("Sanhedrin" 5a; "Ketubot " 62b). His father, Aibo, was a brother of <a href="Hiyya%20bar%20Abba">Chiyya</a>, who lived in <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>, and was a highly esteemed scholar in the collegiate circle of the patriarch Judah I. From his associations in the house of his uncle, and later as his uncle's disciple and as a member of the academy at <a href="Sepphoris">Sepphoris</a>, Rav acquired such an extraordinary knowledge of traditional lore as to make him its foremost exponent in his native land. While Judah I was still living, Rav, having been duly ordained as teacher—though not without certain restrictions ("Sanhedrin" 5a)—returned to <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a>, where he at once began a career that was destined to mark an epoch in the development of Babylonian Judaism.

The <a href="Aleinu">Aleinu</a> prayer first appeared in the manuscript of the <a href="Rosh%20Hashana">Rosh Hashana</a> liturgy by Rav. He included it in the Rosh Hashana <a href="mussaf">mussaf</a> service as a prologue to the Kingship portion of the <a href="Amidah">Amidah</a>. For that reason some attribute to Rav the authorship, or at least the revising, of Aleinu.

In the annals of the Babylonian schools the year of his arrival is recorded as the starting-point in the chronology of the Talmudic age. It was the 530th year of the <a href="Seleucid">Seleucid</a>an and the 219th year of the <a href="common%20era">common era</a>. As the scene of his activity, Rav first chose <a href="Nehardea">Nehardea</a>, where the <a href="exilarch">exilarch</a> appointed him "<a href="agoranomos">agoranomos</a>", or market-master, and <a href="Rav%20Shela">Rabbi Shela</a> made him lecturer ("amora") of his college ("<a href="Jerusalem%20Talmud">Jerusalem Talmud</a> Bava Batra" v. 15a; "Yoma," 20b). Then he removed to <a href="Sura%20%28city%29">Sura</a>, on the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>, where he established a school of his own, which soon became the intellectual center of the Babylonian Jews. As a renowned teacher of the Law and with hosts of disciples, who came from all sections of the Jewish world, Rav lived and worked in Sura until his death. <a href="Samuel%20of%20Nehardea">Samuel</a>, another disciple of Judah I, at the same time brought to the academy at Nehardea a high degree of prosperity; in fact, it was at the school of Rav that Jewish learning in Babylonia found its permanent home and center. Rav's activity made Babylonia independent of Palestine, and gave it that predominant position which it was destined to occupy for several centuries.

The method of treatment of the traditional material to which the Talmud owes its origin was established in Babylonia by Rav. That method takes the "Mishnah" of Judah ha-Nasi as a text or foundation, adding to it the other "tannaitic" traditions, and deriving from all of them the theoretical explanations and practical applications of the religious Law. The legal and ritual opinions recorded in Rav's name and his disputes with Samuel constitute the main body of the <a href="Babylonian%20Talmud">Babylonian Talmud</a>. His numerous disciples—some of whom were very influential and who, for the most part, were also disciples of Samuel—amplified and, in their capacity as instructors and by their discussions, continued the work of Rav. In the Babylonian schools, Rav was rightly referred to as "our great master." Rav also exercised a great influence for good upon the moral and religious conditions of his native land, not only indirectly through his disciples, but directly by reason of the strictness with which he repressed abuses in matters of marriage and divorce, and denounced ignorance and negligence in matters of ritual observance.

Rav, says tradition, found an open, neglected field and fenced it in ("Hullin" 110a). Special attention was given by him to the <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> of the <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>. He is reputed to be the author of one of the finest compositions in the <a href="Siddur">Jewish prayerbook</a>, the "<a href="Mussaf">Mussaf</a>" service of the <a href="Rosh%20Hashanah">New Year</a>. In this noble prayer are evinced profound religious feeling and exalted thought, as well as ability to use the <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew language</a> in a natural, expressive, and classical manner ("Jerusalem Talmud Rosh Hashanah" i. 57a). The many <a href="homiletic">homiletic</a> and <a href="ethical">ethical</a> (haggadistic) sayings recorded of him show similar ability. As a haggadist, Rav is surpassed by none of the Babylonian "<a href="Amoraim">Amoraim</a>". He is the only one of the Babylonian teachers whose haggadistic utterances approach in number and contents those of the Palestinian haggadists. The <a href="Jerusalem%20Talmud">Jerusalem Talmud</a> has preserved a large number of his <a href="halakha">halakic</a> and <a href="Aggadah">aggadistic</a> utterances; and the Palestinian "<a href="Midrashim">Midrashim</a>" also contain many of his "aggadot". Rav delivered homiletic discourses, both in the <a href="Beth%20midrash">Beth midrash</a> (college) and in the synagogues. He especially loved to treat in his homilies of the events and personages of Biblical history; and many beautiful and genuinely poetic embellishments of the Biblical record, which have become common possession of the <a href="aggadah">aggadah</a>, are his creations. His "aggadah" is particularly rich in thoughts concerning the moral life and the relations of human beings to one another. A few of these utterances may be quoted here: ("Shabbat" 10b)

Rav loved the "Book of Ecclesiasticus" (<a href="Sirach">Sirach</a>), and warned his disciple <a href="Hamnuna">Hamnuna</a> against unjustifiable asceticism by quoting advice contained therein—that, considering the transitoriness of human life ("Eruvin" 54a), one should not despise the good things of this world. To the celestial joys of the future he was accustomed to refer in the following poetic words: ("Berakhot" 17a)

Rav also devoted much attention to <a href="Mysticism">mystical</a> and <a href="transcendence%20%28religion%29">transcendental</a> speculations which the rabbis connect with the Biblical account of creation ("Genesis" 1, "Ma'aseh Bereshit"), the vision of the mysterious chariot of God ("Ezekiel" 1, "Ma'aseh Merkabah"), and the <a href="Divine%20name">Divine Name</a>. Many of his important utterances testify to his tendency in this direction ("Hagigah" 12a, "Kiddushin" 71a).

Concerning the social position and the personal history of Rav we were not informed. That he was rich seems probable; for he appears to have occupied himself for a time with commerce and afterward with agriculture ("Hullin" 105a). He is referred to as the son of noblemen (Shabbat 29a) but it is not clear if this is an affectionate term or a true description of his status. <a href="Rashi">Rashi</a> does tell us that he is being described as the son of great men. That he was highly respected by the <a href="Gentile">Gentile</a>s as well as by the Jews of Babylonia is proved by the friendship which existed between him and the last <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a>n king, <a href="Artabanus%20V%20%28of%20Parthia%29">Artaban</a> ("Avodah Zarah" 10b). He was deeply affected by the death of Artaban (226) and the downfall of the <a href="Arsacid%20Empire">Arsacid</a> dynasty, and does not appear to have sought the friendship of <a href="Ardashir%20I">Ardeshir</a>, founder of the <a href="Sassanian">Sassanian</a> dynasty, although <a href="Samuel%20of%20Nehardea">Samuel of Nehardea</a> probably did so. Rav became closely related, through the marriage of one of his daughters, to the family of the exilarch. Her sons, <a href="Mar%20Ukba">Mar Ukba</a> and Nehemiah, were considered types of the highest aristocracy. Rav had many sons, several of whom are mentioned in the "Talmud", the most distinguished being the eldest, Chiyya. The latter did not, however, succeed his father as head of the academy: this post fell to Rav's disciple <a href="Rav%20Huna">Rav Huna</a>. Two of his grandsons occupied in succession the office of <a href="exilarch">exilarch</a> ("resh galuta") ("Hullin" 92a).

Rav died at an advanced age, deeply mourned by numerous disciples and the entire Babylonian Jewry, which he had raised from comparative insignificance to the leading position in Judaism ("Shabbat" 110a, "Mo'ed Katan" 24a).

Abbahu

Abbahu () was a <a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a>ist, known as an "<a href="Amoraim">amora</a>", who lived in the <a href="Land%20of%20Israel">Land of Israel</a>, of the 3rd amoraic generation (about 279-320), sometimes cited as R. Abbahu of <a href="Caesarea">Caesarea</a> (Ḳisrin). His <a href="rabbinic">rabbinic</a> education was acquired mainly at <a href="Tiberias">Tiberias</a>, in the academy presided over by <a href="R.%20Johanan">R. Johanan</a>, with whom his relations were almost those of a son ("<a href="Yer.">Yer.</a> <a href="Berakhot%20%28Talmud%29">Berakhot</a>" chapter II "halachah" 1, page 4b in <a href="Daniel%20Bomberg">Daniel Bomberg</a>'s <a href="Venice">Venice</a> edition; 12b in current editions; "<a href="Gittin">Gittin</a>" 44b; "<a href="Bava%20Batra">Bava Batra</a>" 39a). He frequently made pilgrimages to Tiberias, even after he had become well known as <a href="Rector%20%28academia%29">rector</a> of the Caesarean Academy ("Yer. <a href="Shab.">Shab.</a>" chapter VIII "halachah" 1, page 11a in Bomberg's Venice edition; 54b in current editions; Yer. "<a href="Pesahim">Pesahim</a>" chapter X "halachah" 1, page 37c in Bomberg's Venice edition).

Abbahu was an authority on weights and measures ("<a href="Yer.">Yer.</a> <a href="Terumot">Terumot</a>" chapter V, "halachah" 3 page 43c in Bomberg's Venice edition; "halachah" 1 in current editions). He encouraged the study of <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> by <a href="Jew">Jew</a>s. He learned Greek himself in order to become useful to his people, then under the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> "<a href="proconsul">proconsul</a>s", that language having become, to a considerable extent, the rival of the <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> even in prayer ("Yer. <a href="Sotah%20%28Talmud%29">Sotah</a>" chapter VII, 21b). In spite of the bitter protest of <a href="Simon%20b.%20Abba">Simon b. Abba</a>, he also taught his daughters Greek ("Yer. Shab." chapter VI, 7d; "Yer. Sotah" chapter IX, 24c; "<a href="Sanhedrin%20%28tractate%29">Sanhedrin</a>" 14a). Indeed, it was said of Abbahu that he was a living illustration of the maxim (<a href="Ecc.">Ecc.</a> ; compare <a href="Targum%20Onkelos">Targum</a>), "It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this [the study of the Law]; yea, also from that [other branches of knowledge] withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all" ("<a href="Ecc.%20R.">Ecc. R.</a>" to 7:18).

Being wise, handsome, and wealthy ("<a href="Bava%20Metzia">Bava Metzia</a>" 84a; "Yer. Bava Metzia" chapter IV, 9d), Abbahu became not only popular with his coreligionists, but also influential with the proconsular government ("<a href="Hagigah">Hagigah</a>" 14a; "<a href="Ketubot">Ketubot</a>" 17a). On one occasion, when his senior colleagues, <a href="%E1%B8%A4iyya%20b.%20Abba">Ḥiyya b. Abba</a>, <a href="Rabbi%20Ammi">Rabbi Ammi</a>, and <a href="Rabbi%20Assi">Rabbi Assi</a>, had punished a certain woman, and feared the wrath of the proconsul, Abbahu was deputed to intercede for them. He had, however, anticipated the rabbis' request, and wrote them that he had appeased the informers but not the accuser. The witty enigmatic letter describing this incident, preserved in the Talmud ("Yer. <a href="Meg.">Meg.</a>" chapter III, 74a), is in the main pure Hebrew, and even includes Hebrew translations of Greek proper names, to avoid the danger of possible exposure should the letter have fallen into the hands of enemies and informers (compare "<a href="Eruvin%20%28tractate%29">Eruvin</a>" 53b).

After his ordination he declined a teacher's position, recommending in his stead a more needy friend, <a href="R.%20Abba%20of%20Acre">R. Abba of Acre</a> (Acco), as worthier than himself ("<a href="Sotah%20%28Talmud%29">Sotah</a>" 40a). He thereby illustrated his own doctrine that it is a divine virtue to sympathize with a friend in his troubles as well as to partake of his joys ("<a href="Tan.">Tan.</a>", "<a href="Vayeshev">Wa-yesheb</a>", ed. <a href="Salomon%20Buber">Buber</a>, 16). Later he assumed the office of rector in Caesarea, the former seat of <a href="Hoshaiah%20Rabbah">Hoshaiah Rabbah</a>, and established himself at the so-called Kenishta Maradta (Insurrectionary Synagogue; "Yer. <a href="Nazir%20%28Talmud%29">Nazir</a>" chapter VII, 56a; "Yer. <a href="San.">San.</a>" chapter I, 18a; compare <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a>, "B. J." ii. 14, § 5; <a href="Marcus%20Jastrow">Jastrow</a>, "Dict." p. 838), whence some of the most prominent teachers of the next generation issued. He did not, however, confine his activity to Caesarea, where he originated several ritualistic rules ("Yer. <a href="Demai%20%28tractate%29">Demai</a>" chapter II, 23a, "<a href="Rosh%20Hashanah%20%28tractate%29">R.H.</a>" 34a), one of which—that regulating the sounding of the <a href="shofar">shofar</a>—has since been universally adopted, and is referred to by medieval Jewish <a href="casuists">casuists</a> as ""Takkanat R. Abbahu"" (the Enactment of R. Abbahu; compare ""<a href="Ma%E1%B8%A5zor%20Vitry">Maḥzor Vitry</a>"", <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, 1893, p. 355). He also visited and taught in many other Jewish towns ("Yer. Berakhot" chapter VIII, 12a; "Yer. Shab." chapter III, 5c).

While on these journeys, Abbahu gathered so many "<a href="Halakot">Halakot</a>" that scholars turned to him for information on mooted questions ("Yer. Shabbat" chapter VIII, 11a; "Yer. <a href="Yevamot">Yevamot</a>" chapter I, 2d). In the course of these travels he made a point of complying with all local enactments, even where such compliance laid him open to the charge of inconsistency ("Yer. Berakhot" chapter VIII, 12a; "Yer. <a href="Beitzah">Beitzah</a>" chapter I, 60d). On the other hand, where circumstances required it, he did not spare even the princes of his people ("Yer. <a href="Avodah%20Zarah">Avodah Zarah</a>" chapter I, 39b). Where, however, the rigorous exposition of laws worked hardship on the masses, he did not scruple to modify the decisions of his colleagues for the benefit of the community ("Shabbat" 134b; "Yer. Shabbat" chapter XVII, 16b; "Yer. <a href="Mo%27ed%20Katan">Mo'ed Katan</a>" chapter I, 80b). As for himself, he was very strict in the observance of the laws. On one occasion he ordered some <a href="Samaritan">Samaritan</a> wine, but subsequently learning that there were no longer any strict observers of the dietary laws among the Samaritans, with the assistance of his colleagues, <a href="%E1%B8%A4iyya%20b.%20Abba">Ḥiyya b. Abba</a>, Rabbi Ammi, and Rabbi Assi, he investigated the report, and, ascertaining it to be well founded, did not hesitate to declare the Samaritans, for all ritualistic purposes, <a href="Gentiles">Gentiles</a> ("Yer. Avodah Zarah" chapter V, 44d; "<a href="Hullin">Hullin</a>" 6a).

R. Abbahu's chief characteristic seems to have been modesty. While lecturing in different towns, he met <a href="R.%20%E1%B8%A4iyya%20b.%20Abba">R. Ḥiyya b. Abba</a>, who was lecturing on intricate "<a href="halakic">halakic</a>" themes. As Abbahu delivered popular sermons, the masses naturally crowded to hear him, and deserted the halakist. At this apparent slight, R. Ḥiyya manifested chagrin, and R. Abbahu hastened to comfort him by comparing himself to the pedler of glittering fineries that always attracted the eyes of the masses, while his rival was a trader in precious stones, the virtues and values of which were appreciated only by the connoisseur. This speech not having the desired effect, R. Abbahu showed special respect for his slighted colleague by following him for the remainder of that day. "What," said Abbahu, "is my modesty as compared with that of R. <a href="Abba%20of%20Acre">Abba of Acre</a> (Acco), who does not even remonstrate with his interpreter for interpolating his own comments in the lecturer's expositions." When his wife reported to him that his interpreter's wife had boasted of her own husband's greatness, R. Abbahu simply said, "What difference does it make which of us is really the greater, so long as through both of us heaven is glorified?" ("<a href="Sotah%20%28Talmud%29">Sotah</a>" 40a). His principle of life he expressed in the maxim,

R. Abbahu, though eminent as a halakist, was more distinguished as a <a href="haggadist">haggadist</a> and controversialist. He had many interesting disputes with the <a href="Christians">Christians</a> of his day ("Shab." 152b; "<a href="San.">San.</a>" 39a; "<a href="Av.%20Zarah">Av. Zarah</a>" 4a). Sometimes these disputes were of a jocular nature. Thus, a heretic bearing the name of Sason (=Joy) once remarked to him, "In the <a href="Olam%20Haba">next world</a> your people will have to draw water for me; for thus it is written in the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> (<a href="Isaiah">Isaiah</a> 12:3), 'With joy shall ye draw water.'" To this R. Abbahu replied, "Had the Bible said 'for joy' ["le-sason"], it would mean as thou sayest, but since it says 'with joy' ["be-sason"], it means that we shall make bottles of thy hide and fill them with water" ("<a href="Suk.">Suk.</a>" 48b). These controversies, though forced on him, provoked resentment, and it is even related that his physician, Jacob the <a href="Jewish%20schisms">Schismatic</a> ("Minaah"), was slowly poisoning him, but <a href="R.%20Ammi">R. Ammi</a> and <a href="R.%20Assi">R. Assi</a> discovered the crime in time ("Av. Zarah" 28a).

Abbahu had two sons, Zeira and Ḥanina. Some writers ascribe to him a third son, Abimi (<a href="Wilhelm%20Bacher">Bacher</a>, "Agada der Babylonischen Amoräer"). Abbahu sent Ḥanina to the academy at Tiberias, where he himself had studied, but the lad occupied himself with the <a href="burial">burial</a> of the dead, and on hearing of this, the father sent him a reproachful message in this laconic style: "Is it because there are no graves in <a href="C%C3%A6sarea">Cæsarea</a> (compare <a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Exodus</a> 14:11) that I have sent thee off to Tiberias? Study must precede practice" ("Yer. Pesahim" chapter III, 30b). Abbahu left behind him a number of disciples, the most prominent among whom were the leaders of the 4th amoraic generation, <a href="R.%20Jonah">R. Jonah</a> and <a href="R.%20Jose">R. Jose</a>. At Abbahu's death the mourning was so great that it was said, "Even the statues of Cæsarea shed tears" ("<a href="Mo%27ed%20Katan">Mo'ed Katan</a>" 25b; "Yer. Av. Zarah" chapter III, 42c).

There are several other Abbahus mentioned in the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a>im and <a href="Midrashim">Midrashim</a>, prominent among whom is Abbahu (Abuha, Aibut) b. Ihi (Ittai), a <a href="Jews%20of%20Babylonia">Babylonian</a> halakist, contemporary of <a href="Samuel%20of%20Nehardea">Samuel</a> and <a href="Anan%20%28amora%29">Anan</a> ("<a href="Eruvin%20%28tractate%29">Eruvin</a>" 74a), and brother of Minyamin (Benjamin) b. Ihi. While this Abbahu repeatedly applied to Samuel for information, Samuel in return learned many Halakot from him ("<a href="Naz.">Naz.</a>" 24b; "<a href="Bava%20Metzia">Bava Metzia</a>" 14a; 75a).

"When does your Messiah come?" a <a href="Christian">Christian</a> ("Minaah") once asked Abbahu in a tone of mockery, whereupon he replied: "When you will be wrapped in darkness, for it says, 'Behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the nations; then shall the Lord rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen on thee' <nowiki>[</nowiki><a href="Isaiah">Isaiah</a> 60:2]," ("Sanhedrin" 99a). A Christian came to Abbahu with the quibbling question: "How could your God in His priestly holiness bury <a href="Moses">Moses</a> without providing for purificatory rites, yet oceans are declared insufficient?" (Isaiah 40:12). "Why," said Abbahu, "does it not say, 'The Lord cometh with fire'?" (Isaiah 64:15). "Fire is the true element of purification, according to <a href="Book%20of%20Numbers">Numbers</a> 31:23," was his answer ("Sanhedrin" 39a). Another question of the same character: "Why the boastful claim: 'What nation on earth is like Thy people Israel' (II <a href="Books%20of%20Samuel">Sam.</a> 7:23), since we read, 'All the nations are as nothing before Him'?" (Isaiah 40:17), to which Abbahu replied: "Do we not read of Israel, he 'shall not be reckoned among the nations'?" (, "Sanhedrin" as above).

Abbahu made a notable exception with reference to the <a href="Tosefta">Tosefta</a>'s statement that the "Gilionim" (Evangels) and other books of the Mineans ("Minnin") are not to be saved from a conflagration on <a href="Shabbat">Sabbath</a>: "the books of those [written by "Minnin" for the purpose of debating with Jews] at Abidan may or may not be saved" ("Shab." 116a). In regard to the benediction ""Baruk Shem Kebod Malkuto"" (Blessed be the Name of His glorious Kingdom) after the ""Shema' Yisrael"," Abbahu says that in Palestine, where the Christians look for points of controversy, the words should be recited aloud (lest the Jews be accused of silently tampering with the unity of God proclaimed in the "Shema"), whereas in the Babylonian city of <a href="Nehardea">Nehardea</a>, where there are no Christians, the words are recited with a low voice ("Pesahim" 56a). Preaching directly against the Christian dogma, Abbahu says: "A king of flesh and blood may have a father, a brother, or a son to share in or dispute his sovereignty, but the Lord saith, 'I am the Lord thy God! I am the first; that is, I have no father, and I am the last; that is, I have no brother, and besides me there is no God; that is, I have no son'" (Isaiah 44:6; "<a href="Ex.%20R.">Ex. R.</a>" 29). His comment on Numbers 23:19 has a still more polemical tone: "God is not a man that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent; if a man says: 'I am God,' he is a liar; if he says: 'I am a son of man,' he will have cause to regret it; and if he says, 'I will go up to heaven,' he has said ["something"] but will not keep his word" ("Yer. <a href="Ta%27anit">Ta'anit</a>" chapter II "halachah" 1, end, page 65b in Bomberg's Venice edition; 9a in current editions).

Some of his controversies on Christian theological subjects, as on <a href="Adam%20%28Bible%29">Adam</a> ("<a href="Yal%E1%B8%B3.">Yalḳ.</a>", Gen. 47), on <a href="Enoch%20%28ancestor%20of%20Noah%29">Enoch</a> ("<a href="Gen.%20R.">Gen. R.</a>" 25), and on the resurrection ("Shab." 152b), are less clear and direct (see Bacher, "Agada der Pal. Amor." ii. 97, 115-118).

Abbreviator

An Abbreviator (plural "Abbreviators" in English and "Abbreviatores" in Latin) or Breviator was a writer of the <a href="Apostolic%20Chancery">Papal Chancery</a> who adumbrated and prepared in correct form <a href="Papal%20bull">Papal bull</a>s, <a href="Papal%20brief">briefs</a>, and <a href="papal%20consistory">consistorial</a> decrees before these were written out "in extenso" by the "scriptores".

They are first mentioned in the <a href="Papal%20bull">Papal bull</a> "<a href="Extravagantes">Extravagantes</a>" of <a href="Pope%20John%20XXII">Pope John XXII</a> and in a <a href="Papal%20bull">Papal bull</a> of <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XII">Pope Benedict XII</a>.

After the <a href="protonotary">protonotaries</a> left the adumbration of the minutes to the Abbreviators, those "de Parco majori" of the dignity of <a href="prelate">prelate</a> were the most important officers of the <a href="Papal%20Chancery">Papal Chancery</a>. By the pontificate of <a href="Pope%20Martin%20V">Pope Martin V</a> their signature was essential to the validity of the acts of the Chancery. Over time they obtained many important privileges.

Abbreviators make an abridgment or abstract of a long writing or discourse by contracting the parts, i. e., the words and sentences; an abbreviated form of writing common among the ancient Romans. Abbreviations were of two kinds: the use of a single letter for a single word and the use of a sign, note, or mark for a word or phrase.
The <a href="Emperor%20Justinian">Emperor Justinian</a> forbade the use of abbreviations in the compilation of the "Digest" and afterward extended his prohibition to all other writings. This prohibition was not universally obeyed. The Abbreviators found it convenient to use the abbreviated form, and this was especially the case in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>. The early Christians practised the abbreviated mode, no doubt as an easy and safe way of communicating with one another and safeguarding their secrets from enemies and false brethren.

In course of time the <a href="Papal%20Chancery">Papal Chancery</a> adopted this mode of writing as the "curial" style, still further abridging by omitting the <a href="diphthong">diphthong</a>s "ae" and "oe", and likewise all lines and marks of punctuation. The "Abbreviatores" were officials of the <a href="Roman%20Curia">Roman Curia</a>.

The scope of its labour, as well as the number of its officials, varied over time. Up to the twelfth or thirteenth century, the duty of the Apostolic – or <a href="Roman%20Chancery">Roman – Chancery</a> was to prepare and expedite the Papal letters and writs for collation of ecclesiastical dignitaries and other matters of grave importance which were discussed and decided in <a href="Papal%20consistory">Papal consistory</a>. About the thirteenth or fourteenth century, the Popes, then residing in <a href="Avignon">Avignon</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, began to reserve the collation of a great many <a href="benefice">benefice</a>s, so that all the benefices, especially the greater ones, were to be conferred through the <a href="Roman%20Curia">Roman Curia</a> (Lega, "Praelectiones Jur. Can.", 1, 2, 287). As a consequence, the labour was immensely augmented, and the number of "Abbreviatores" necessarily increased. To regulate the proper expedition of these reserved benefices, <a href="Pope%20John%20XXII">Pope John XXII</a> instituted the rules of chancery to determine the competency and mode of procedure of the Chancery. Afterwards the establishment of the "<a href="Dataria%20Apostolica">Dataria Apostolica</a>" and the <a href="Secretariate%20of%20Briefs">Secretariate of Briefs</a> lightened the work of the Chancery and led to a reduction in the number of "Abbreviatores".

According to Ciampini ("Lib. de abbreviatorum de parco majore etc.", Cap. 1) the institution of curial abbreviators was very ancient, succeeding after the persecutions to the notaries who recorded the acts of the martyrs. Other authors reject this early institution and ascribe it to <a href="Pope%20John%20XXII">Pope John XXII</a> in 1316. It is certain that he uses the name ""abbreviatores"", but speaks as if they had existed before his time, and had, by over-taxation of their labour, caused much complaint and protest. He ("Extravag. Joan.", Tit. 13, "Cum ad Sacrosanctae Romanae Ecclesiae") prescribed their work, determined how much they could charge for their labour, fixed a certain tax for an abstract or abridgment of twenty-five words or their equivalent at 150 letters, forbade them to charge more, even though the abstract was over twenty-five words but less than fifty words, enacted that the basis of the tax was the labour employed in writing, expediting, etc. the bulls, and by no means the emoluments that accrued to the recipient of the favour or benefice conferred by the bull, and declared that whoever charged more than the tax fixed by him was suspended for six months from office, and upon a second violation of the law, was deprived of it altogether, and if the delinquent was an abbreviator, he was excommunicated. Should a large letter have to be rewritten, owing to the inexact copy of the abbreviator, the abbreviator and not the receiver of the bull had to pay the extra charge for the extra labour to the Apostolic writer.

Whatever may be the date of the institution of the office of abbreviator, it is certain that it became of greater importance and more highly privileged upon its erection into a college of prelates. <a href="Pope%20Martin%20V">Pope Martin V</a> (Constit. 3 "In Apostolicae", 2 and 5) fixed the manner for their examination and approbation and also the tax they could demand for their labour and the punishment for overcharge. He also assigned to them certain remunerations. The Abbreviators of the lower, or lesser, were to be promoted to the higher, or greater, bar or presidency. Their offices were compatible with other offices, i. e. they could hold two benefices or offices simultaneously, some conferred by the Cardinal Vice Chancellor, others by the <a href="Pope">Pope</a>.

In the pontificate of <a href="Pope%20Pius%20II">Pope Pius II</a>, their number, which had been fixed at twenty-four, had overgrown to such an extent as to diminish considerably the individual remuneration, and, as a consequence, competent men no longer sought the office, and hence the old style of writing and expediting the bulls was no longer used, to the great injury of justice, the interested parties, and the dignity of the <a href="Apostolic%20See">Apostolic See</a>. To remedy this and to restore the old established chancery style, the Pope selected out of the many then living Abbreviators seventy, and formed them into a college of prelates denominated the "College of Abbreviators", and decreed that their office should be perpetual, that certain remunerations should be attached to it, and granted certain privileges to the possessors of the same. He ordained further that some should be called "Abbreviators of the Upper Bar" ("Abbreviatores de Parco Majori"; the name derived from a place in the Chancery that was surrounded by a grating, in which the officials sat, which is called higher or lower (major or minor) according to the proximity of the seats to that of the Vice Chancellor), the others of the Lower Bar ("Abbreviatores de Parco Minori"); that the former should sit upon a slightly raised portion of the chamber, separated from the rest of the chamber by lattice work, assist the <a href="Cardinal%20Vice-Chancellor">Cardinal Vice-Chancellor</a>, subscribe the letters and have the principal part in examining, revising, and expediting the Apostolic letters to be issued with the leaden seal; that the latter, however, should sit among the Apostolic writers upon benches in the lower part of the chamber, and their duty was to carry the signed schedules or supplications to the prelates of the Upper Bar. Then one of the prelates of the Upper Bar made an abstract, and another prelate of the same bar revised it. Prelates of the Upper Bar formed a quasi-tribunal, in which as a college they decided all doubts that might arise about the form and quality of the letters, of the clauses and decrees to be adjoined to the Apostolic letters, and sometimes about the payment of the remunerations and other contingencies. Their opinion about questions concerning Chancery business was held in the highest estimation by all the Roman tribunals.

<a href="Pope%20Paul%20II">Pope Paul II</a> suppressed the College; but <a href="Pope%20Sixtus%20IV">Pope Sixtus IV</a> ("Constitutio" 16, "Divina") re-instituted it. He appointed seventy-two abbreviators, of whom twelve were of the upper, or greater, and twenty-two of the lower, or lesser, presidency ("parco"), and thirty-eight examiners on first appearance of letters. They were bound to be in attendance on certain days under penalty of fine, and sign letters and diplomas. Ciampini mentions a decree of the Vice Chancellor by which absentees were mulcted in the loss of their share of the remuneration of the following session of the Chancery. The same Pope also granted many privileges to the College of Abbreviators, but especially to the members of the greater presidency.

<a href="Pope%20Pius%20VII">Pope Pius VII</a> suppressed many of the offices of the Chancery, and so the <a href="Tribunal%20of%20Correctors">Tribunal of Correctors</a> and the Abbreviators of the lower presidency disappeared. Of the Tribunal of Correctors, a <a href="substitute-corrector">substitute-corrector</a> alone remains. Bouix ("Curia Romana", edit. 1859) chronicled the suppression of the lower presidency and put the number of Abbreviators at that date at eleven. Later the College consisted of seventeen prelates, six substitutes, and one sub-substitute, all of whom, except the prelates, were clerics or laity. Although the duty of Abbreviators was originally to make abstracts and abridgments of the Apostolic letters, diplomas, et cetera, using the legal abbreviations, clauses, and <a href="Formulary%20%28model%20documents%29">formularies</a>, in course of time, as their office grew in importance they delegated that part of their office to their substitute and confined themselves to overseeing the proper expedition of the Apostolic letters. Prior to 1878, all Apostolic letters and briefs requiring for their validity the leaden seal were engrossed upon rough <a href="parchment">parchment</a> in Gothic characters or round letters, also called "Gallicum" and commonly "Bollatico", but in <a href="Italy">Italy</a> "Teutonic", without lines, diphthongs, or marks of punctuation. Bulls engrossed on a different parchment, or in different characters with lines and punctuation marks, or without the accustomed abbreviations, clauses, and formularies, were rejected as spurious. <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a> in his "Constitutio Universae Eccles." of 29 December 1878 ordained that they should be written henceforth in ordinary Latin characters upon ordinary parchment and that no abbreviations were to be used except those easily understood.

Many great privileges were conferred upon Abbreviators. By decree of <a href="Pope%20Leo%20X">Pope Leo X</a> they were elevated as Papal nobles, ranking as "<a href="Comes%20palatinus">Comes palatinus</a>" ("Count Palatine"), <a href="wikt%3Afamiliar">familiars</a> and members of the Papal household, so that they might enjoy all the privileges of <a href="domestic%20prelate">domestic prelate</a>s and of prelates in actual attendance on the Pope, as regards plurality of benefices as well as expectives. They and their clerics and their properties were exempt from all jurisdiction except the immediate jurisdiction of the <a href="Pope">Pope</a>, and they were not subject to the judgments of the <a href="Auditor%20of%20Causes">Auditor of Causes</a> or the <a href="Cardinal%20Vicar">Cardinal Vicar</a>. He also empowered them to confer, later within strict limitations, the degree of Doctor, with all university privileges, institute notaries (later abrogated), legitimize children so as to make them eligible to receive benefices vacated by their fathers (later revoked), also to ennoble three persons and to make Knights of the <a href="Order%20of%20St.%20Sylvester">Order of St. Sylvester</a> ("Militiae Aureae"), the same to enjoy and to wear the insignia of nobility. <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20XVI">Pope Gregory XVI</a> rescinded this privilege and reserved to the Pope the right of institution of such knights ("Acta Pont. Greg. XVI", Vol. 3, 178-179-180).

<a href="Pope%20Paul%20V">Pope Paul V</a>, who in early manhood was a member of the College (Const. 2, "Romani"), made them <a href="Referendaries%20of%20Favours">Referendaries of Favours</a>, and after three years of service, <a href="Referendaries%20of%20Justice">Referendaries of Justice</a>, enjoying the privileges of Referendaries and permitting one to assist in the signatures before the Pope, giving all a right to a portion in the Papal palace and exempting them from the registration of favours as required by <a href="Pope%20Pius%20IV">Pope Pius IV</a> (Const., 98) with regard to matters pertaining to the <a href="Apostolic%20Chamber">Apostolic Chamber</a>.

They followed immediately after the twelve voting members of the Signature "in capella". Abbreviators of the greater presidency were permitted to wear the purple cassock and "cappa", as also <a href="rochet">rochet</a> "in capella". Abbreviators of the lower presidency before their suppression were simple clerics, and according to permission granted by <a href="Pope%20Sixtus%20IV">Pope Sixtus IV</a> (loc. cit.) might be even married.

These offices becoming vacant by death of the Abbreviator, no matter where the death occurred, were reserved to the <a href="Roman%20Curia">Roman Curia</a>. The prelates could resign their office in favour of others. Formerly these offices as well as those of the other Chancery officers from the Regent down were occasions of venality, until Popes, especially <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XIV">Pope Benedict XIV</a> and <a href="Pope%20Pius%20VII">Pope Pius VII</a>, gradually abolished that. <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a> in a <a href="motu%20proprio">motu proprio</a> of 4 July 1898 most solemnly decreed the abolition of all venality in the transfer or collation of the said offices.

As domestic prelates, prelates of the <a href="Roman%20Curia">Roman Curia</a>, they had personal preeminence in every diocese of the world. They were addressed as "Reverendissimus", "Right Reverend", and "Monsignor". As prelates, and therefore possessing the legal dignity, they were competent to receive and execute Papal commands. <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XIV">Pope Benedict XIV</a> (Const. 3, "Maximo") granted prelates of the greater presidency the privilege of wearing a hat with a purple band, which right they held even after they ceased to be abbreviators.

<a href="Pope%20Pius%20X">Pope St. Pius X</a> abrogated the College in 1908 and their obligations were transferred to the "<a href="protonotarius%20apostolicus%20participans">protonotarii apostolici participantes</a>".

Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi

Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi, short for Muwaffaq al-Din Muhammad Abd al-Latif ibn Yusuf al-Baghdadi (; 1162–1231), or Abdallatif al-Baghdadi (), born in <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a> (modern Iraq), was a <a href="Islamic%20medicine">physician</a>, <a href="Historiography%20of%20early%20Islam">historian</a>, <a href="Egyptologist">Egyptologist</a> and traveler, and one of the most voluminous writers of the <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a> in his time.

Many details of Abd al-Latif's life are known from his autobiography. As a young man, he studied grammar, law, tradition, medicine, alchemy and philosophy. He focused his studies on ancient authors, in particular <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, after first adopting <a href="Avicenna">Avicenna</a> as his philosophical mentor at the suggestion of a wandering scholar from the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a>. He traveled extensively and resided for a while in <a href="Mosul">Mosul</a> (in 1189) where he studied the works of al-Suhrawardi before traveling on to <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> (1190) and the camp of <a href="Saladin">Saladin</a> outside <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Acre</a> (1191). It was at the latter location that he met Baha’ al-Din Ibn Shaddad and ‘Imad al-Din al-Isfahani and acquired the <a href="qadi">qadi</a> al-Fadil's patronage. He went on to <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, where he met Abu'l-Qasim al-Shari'i, who introduced him to the works of al-Farabi, <a href="Alexander%20of%20Aphrodisias">Alexander of Aphrodisias</a>, and <a href="Themistius">Themistius</a> and (according to al-Latif) turned him away from Avicenna and alchemy.

He met Saladin himself in 1192 in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, then went to Damascus again before returning to Cairo. In later years he again journeyed to Jerusalem and to Damascus in 1207-8, and eventually made his way via <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a> to <a href="Erzindjan">Erzindjan</a>, where he remained at the court of Ala’-al-Din Da’ud until the city was conquered by the <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Rum">Seljuk</a> ruler <a href="Kayqubadh">Kayqubadh</a>. ‘Abd al-Latif returned to Baghdad in 1229, travelling back via <a href="Erzerum">Erzerum</a>, <a href="Kamakh">Kamakh</a>, <a href="Diwrigi">Diwrigi</a> and <a href="Malatiya">Malatiya</a>. He died in Baghdad two years later.

Abdullatif was undoubtedly a man of great knowledge and of an inquisitive and penetrating mind. Of the numerous works (mostly on medicine) which Osaiba ascribes to him, one only, his graphic and detailed "Account of Egypt" (in two parts), appears to be known in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>.

Abd-al-Latif was well aware of the value of ancient monuments and praised Muslim rulers for preserving and protecting pre-Islamic artifacts and monuments. He noted that the preservation of antiquities presented a number of benefits for Muslims:

While discussing the profession of <a href="treasure%20hunting">treasure hunting</a>, he notes that poorer treasure hunters were often sponsored by rich businessmen to go on <a href="Archeology">archeological</a> expeditions. In some cases, an expedition could turn out to be <a href="fraud">fraud</a>, with the treasure hunter disappearing with large amounts of money extracted from sponsors. This fraudulent practice continues to the present day, with rich businessmen in Egypt still being deceived by local treasure hunters.

This work was one of the earliest works on <a href="Egyptology">Egyptology</a>. It contains a vivid description of a <a href="famine">famine</a> caused, during the author's residence in Egypt, by the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> failing to overflow its banks. He also wrote detailed descriptions on <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20architecture">ancient Egyptian monuments</a>.

Al-Baghdadi wrote that during the famine in Egypt in 597 AH (1200 AD), he had the opportunity to <a href="observe">observe</a> and <a href="examine">examine</a> a large number of <a href="skeleton">skeleton</a>s. This was one of the earliest examples of a postmortem <a href="autopsy">autopsy</a>, through which he discovered that <a href="Galen">Galen</a> was incorrect regarding the formation of the <a href="bone">bone</a>s of the lower <a href="jaw">jaw</a> and <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a>.

The Arabic manuscript was discovered in 1665 by <a href="Edward%20Pococke">Edward Pococke</a> the <a href="oriental%20studies">orientalist</a>, and preserved in the <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a>. He then published the Arabic manuscript in the 1680s. His son, Edward Pococke the Younger, translated the work into <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, though he was only able to publish less than half of his work. <a href="Thomas%20Hunt%20%28professor%29">Thomas Hunt</a> attempted to publish Pococke's complete translation in 1746, though his attempt was unsuccessful. Pococke's complete Latin translation was eventually published by <a href="Joseph%20White%20%28professor%29">Joseph White</a> of <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> in 1800. The work was then translated into <a href="French%20language">French</a>, with valuable notes, by <a href="Silvestre%20de%20Sacy">Silvestre de Sacy</a> in 1810.

Al-Baghdadi's "Mukhtarat fi al-Tibb" was one of the earliest works on <a href="hirudotherapy">hirudotherapy</a>. He introduced a more modern use for <a href="medicinal%20leech">medicinal leech</a>, stating that leech could be used for cleaning the <a href="Tissue%20%28biology%29">tissues</a> after <a href="Surgery">surgical</a> operations. He did, however, understand that there is a risk over using <a href="leech">leech</a>, and advised patients that leech need to be cleaned before being used and that the dirt or dust "clinging to a leech should be wiped off" before application. He further writes that after the leech has sucked out the blood, <a href="salt">salt</a> should be "sprinkled on the affected part of the human body."

He wrote a book called "Al-Tibb min al-Kitab wa-al-Sunna" ("Medicine from the Book and the Life of the Prophet") describing the <a href="Islamic%20medicine">Islamic medical</a> practices from the time of <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>.

Al-Baghdadi was also the author of a major book dealing with <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>.

<doc id="2676" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2676" title="Abd al-Rahman I">
Abd al-Rahman I

Abd al-Rahman I, more fully Abd al-Rahman ibn Mu'awiya ibn Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (731–788), was the founder of a <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> dynasty that ruled the greater part of <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberia</a> for nearly three centuries (including the succeeding <a href="Caliphate%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Caliphate of Córdoba</a>). At the time it was an establishment of a government in al-Andalus represented a branching from the rest of the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Caliphate of Damascus</a>, which had been brought under the <a href="Abbasid">Abbasid</a> following the overthrow of the Umayyad dynasty from <a href="Damascus%2C%20Syria">Damascus</a> in 750.

He was also known by the surnames "al-Dakhil" ("the Entrant"), "Saqr Quraish" ("the Falcon of the <a href="Quraysh%20%28tribe%29">Quraysh</a>") and the "Falcon of Andalus". Variations of the spelling of his name include Abd ar-Rahman I, Abdul Rahman I, Abdar Rahman I, and Abderraman I.

Born near <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> in <a href="Bilad%20al-Sham">Syria</a>, Abd al-Rahman was the son of the Umayyad prince <a href="Mu%27awiya%20ibn%20Hisham">Mu'awiya ibn Hisham</a> and a <a href="Berber%20people">Berber</a> mother, and thus the grandson of <a href="Hisham%20ibn%20Abd%20al-Malik">Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik</a>, <a href="caliph">caliph</a> from 724 to 743. He was twenty when his family, the ruling <a href="Umayyads">Umayyads</a>, were overthrown by the <a href="Abbasid%20Revolution">Abbasid Revolution</a> in 748–750. Abd al-Rahman and a small part of his family fled Damascus, where the center of Umayyad power had been; people moving with him include his brother Yahya, his four-year-old son Sulayman, and some of his sisters, as well as his Greek <a href="freedman">freedman</a>, Bedr. The family fled from Damascus to the River <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>. All along the way the path was filled with danger, as the <a href="Abbasids">Abbasids</a> had dispatched horsemen across the region to try to find the Umayyad prince and kill him. The Abbasids were merciless with all Umayyads that they found. Abbasid agents closed in on Abd al-Rahman and his family while they were hiding in a small village. He left his young son with his sisters and fled with Yahya. Accounts vary, but Bedr likely initially escaped with Abd ar-Rahman. Some histories indicate that Bedr met up with Abd al-Rahman at a later date.

Abd al-Rahman, Yahya and Bedr quit the village narrowly escaping the Abbasid assassins. Later, on the way south, Abbasid horsemen again caught up with the trio: Abd al-Rahman and his companions then threw themselves into the River Euphrates. While trying to swim across the dangerous Euphrates, Abd al-Rahman is said to have become separated from his brother Yahya, who began swimming back towards the horsemen, possibly from fear of drowning. The horsemen begged the escapers to return, promising that no harm would come to them. The 17th-century historian <a href="Ahmed%20Mohammed%20al-Maqqari">Ahmed Mohammed al-Maqqari</a> poignantly described Abd al-Rahman's reaction as he implored Yahya to keep going: "O brother! Come to me, come to me!" Yahya returned to the near shore, and was quickly dispatched by the horsemen. They cut the head off their prize, leaving Yahya's body to rot. Al-Maqqari quotes prior <a href="Muslim%20historians">Muslim historians</a> as having recorded that Abd al-Rahman said he was so overcome with fear at that moment, that once he made the far shore he ran until exhaustion overcame him. Only he and Bedr were left to face the unknown.

After barely escaping with their lives, Abd al-Rahman and Bedr continued south through <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>, the <a href="Sinai">Sinai</a>, and then into <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. Abd al-Rahman had to keep a low profile as he traveled. It may be assumed that he intended to go at least as far as northwestern Africa (<a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a>), the land of his mother, which had been <a href="Muslim%20conquest%20of%20the%20Maghreb">partly conquered</a> by his Umayyad predecessors. The journey across Egypt would prove perilous. At the time, <a href="Abd%20al-Rahman%20ibn%20Habib%20al-Fihri">Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib al-Fihri</a> was the semi-autonomous governor of <a href="Ifriqiya">Ifriqiya</a> (roughly, modern Tunisia) and a former Umayyad client. The ambitious Ibn Habib, a member of the illustrious <a href="Fihrid">Fihrid</a> family, had long sought to carve out Ifriqiya as a private dominion for himself. At first, he sought an understanding with the Abbasids, but when they refused his terms and demanded his submission, Ibn Habib broke openly with the Abbasids and invited the remnants of the Umayyad dynasty to take refuge in his dominions. Abd al-Rahman was only one of several surviving Umayyad family members to make their way to Ifriqiya at this time.

But Ibn Habib soon changed his mind. He feared the presence of prominent Umayyad exiles in Ifriqiya, a family more illustrious than his own, might become a focal point for intrigue among local nobles against his own usurped powers. Around 755, believing he had discovered plots involving some of the more prominent Umayyad exiles in <a href="Kairouan">Kairouan</a>, Ibn Habib turned against them. At the time, Abd al-Rahman and Bedr were keeping a low profile, staying in <a href="Kabylie">Kabylie</a>, at the camp of a Nafza Berber chieftain friendly to their plight. Ibn Habib dispatched spies to look for the Umayyad prince. When Ibn Habib's soldiers entered the camp, the Berber chieftain's wife Tekfah hid Abd al-Rahman under her personal belongings to help him go unnoticed. Once they were gone, Abd a-Rahman and Bedr immediately set off westwards.

In 755, Abd al-Rahman and Bedr reached modern-day Morocco near <a href="Ceuta">Ceuta</a>. Their next step would be to cross the sea to <a href="al-Andalus">al-Andalus</a>, where Abd al-Rahman could not have been sure whether or not he would be welcomed. Following the <a href="Berber%20Revolt">Berber Revolt</a> of the 740s, the province was in a state of confusion, with the <a href="Ummah">Muslim community</a> torn by tribal dissensions among the <a href="Arab">Arab</a>s (the <a href="Qays%E2%80%93Yemeni%20feud">Qays–Yemeni feud</a>) and racial tensions between the Arabs and Berbers. At that moment, the nominal ruler of al-Andalus, emir <a href="Yusuf%20ibn%20%27Abd%20al-Rahman%20al-Fihri">Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri</a>—another member of the Fihrid family and a favorite of the old Arab settlers ("baladiyun"), mostly of south Arabian or "<a href="Yemen">Yemen</a>i" tribal stock—was locked in a contest with his vizier (and son-in-law) <a href="al-Sumayl%20ibn%20Hatim%20al-Kilabi">al-Sumayl ibn Hatim al-Kilabi</a>, the head of the "Syrians"—the "shamiyum", drawn from the "<a href="jund">jund</a>s" or military regiments of Syria, mostly of north Arabian <a href="Qays">Qays</a>id tribes—who had arrived in 742.

Among the Syrian "junds" were contingents of old Umayyad clients, numbering perhaps 500, and Abd al-Rahman believed he might tug on old loyalties and get them to receive him. Bedr was dispatched across the straits to make contact. Bedr managed to line up three Syrian commanders—<a href="Ubayd%20Allah%20ibn%20Uthman">Ubayd Allah ibn Uthman</a> and <a href="Abd%20Allah%20ibn%20Khalid">Abd Allah ibn Khalid</a>, both originally of Damascus, and <a href="Yusuf%20ibn%20Bukht">Yusuf ibn Bukht</a> of Qinnasrin. The trio approached the Syrian arch-commander al-Sumayl (then in <a href="Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a>) to get his consent, but al-Sumayl refused, fearing Abd al-Rahman would try to make himself emir. As a result, Bedr and the Umayyad clients sent out feelers to their rivals, the Yemenite commanders. Although the Yemenites were not natural allies (the Umayyads are a Qaysid tribe), their interest was piqued. The emir Yusuf al-Fihri had proven himself unable to keep the powerful al-Sumayl in check and several Yemenite chieftains felt their future prospects were poor, whether in a Fihrid or Syrian-dominated Spain, so that they had a better chance of advancement if they hitched themselves to the glitter of the Umayyad name. Although the Umayyads did not have a historical presence in the region (no member of the Umayyad family was known to have ever set foot in al-Andalus before) and there were grave concerns about young Abd al-Rahman's inexperience, several of the lower-ranking Yemenite commanders felt they had little to lose and much to gain, and agreed to support the prince.

Bedr returned to Africa to tell Abd al-Rahman of the invitation of the Umayyad clients in al-Andalus. Shortly thereafter, they set off with a small group of followers for Europe. When some local Berber tribesmen learned of Abd al-Rahman's intent to set sail for al-Andalus, they quickly rode to catch up with him on the coast. The tribesmen might have figured that they could hold Abd al-Rahman as hostage, and force him to buy his way out of Africa. He did indeed hand over some amount of dinars to the suddenly hostile local Berbers. Just as Abd al-Rahman launched his boat, another group of Berbers arrived. They also tried to obtain a fee from him for leaving. One of the Berbers held on to Abd al-Rahman's vessel as it made for al-Andalus, and allegedly had his hand cut off by one of the boat's crew.

Abd al-Rahman landed at <a href="Almu%C3%B1%C3%A9car">Almuñécar</a> in al-Andalus, to the east of <a href="M%C3%A1laga">Málaga</a>, in September 755; however his landing site was unconfirmed.

Upon landing in al-Andalus, Abd al-Rahman was greeted by clients Abu Uthman and Ibn Khalid and an escort of 300 cavalry. During his brief time in <a href="M%C3%A1laga">Málaga</a>, he was able to amass local support quickly. Waves of people made their way to Málaga to pay respect to the prince they thought was dead, including many of the aforementioned Syrians. One famous story that persisted through history related to a gift Abd al-Rahman was given while in Málaga. The gift was a beautiful young slave girl, but Abd al-Rahman humbly returned her to her previous master.

News of the prince's arrival spread like wildfire throughout the peninsula. During this time, emir al-Fihri and the Syrian commander al-Sumayl pondered what to do about the new threat to their shaky hold on power. They decided to try to marry Abd al-Rahman into their family. If that did not work, then Abd al-Rahman would have to be killed. Abd al-Rahman was apparently sagacious enough to expect such a plot. In order to help speed his ascension to power, he was prepared to take advantage of the feuds and dissensions. However, before anything could be done, trouble broke out in northern al-Andalus. Zaragoza, an important trade city on the <a href="Upper%20March">Upper March</a> of al-Andalus, made a bid for autonomy. Al-Fihri and al-Sumayl rode north to quash the rebellion. This might have been fortunate timing for Abd al-Rahman, since he was still getting a solid foothold in al-Andalus. By March 756, Abd al-Rahman and his growing following of Umayyad clients and Yemenite "junds", were able to take <a href="Sevilla">Sevilla</a> without violence. He managed to break the rebellion attempt in Zaragoza, but just about that time the Cordovan governor received news of a Basque rebellion in Pamplona. An important detachment was sent by Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman to quash it, but his troops were annihilated. After the setback, al-Fihri turned his army back south to face the "pretender". The fight for the right to rule al-Andalus was about to begin. The two contingents met on opposite sides of the <a href="Guadalquivir">River Guadalquivir</a>, just outside the capital of <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Spain">Córdoba</a> on the plains of Musarah.

The river was, for the first time in years, overflowing its banks, heralding the end of a long drought. Nevertheless, food was still scarce, and Abd al-Rahman's army suffered from hunger. In an attempt to demoralize Abd al-Rahman's troops, al-Fihri ensured that his troops not only were well fed, but also ate gluttonous amounts of food in full view of the Umayyad lines. An attempt at negotiations soon followed in which it is likely that Abd al-Rahman was offered the hand of al-Fihri's daughter in marriage and great wealth. Abd ar-Rahman, however, would settle for nothing less than control of the emirate, and an impasse was reached. Even before the fight began, dissension spread through some of Abd al-Rahman's lines. Specifically, the Yemeni Arabs were unhappy that the prince was mounted on a fine Spanish steed. And the prince's mettle was untried in battle, after all! The Yemenis observed significantly that such a fine horse would provide an excellent mount to escape from battle.

Being the ever-wary politician, Abd al-Rahman acted quickly to regain Yemeni support, and rode to a Yemeni chief who was mounted on a mule named "Lightning". Abd al-Rahman averred that his horse proved difficult to ride and was wont to buck him out of the saddle. He offered to exchange his horse for the mule, a deal to which the surprised chief readily agreed. The swap quelled the simmering Yemeni rebellion. Soon both armies were in their lines on the same bank of the Guadalquivir. Abd al-Rahman had no banner, and so one was improvised by unwinding a green turban and binding it round the head of a spear. Subsequently, the turban and the spear became the banner and symbol of the Andalusian Umayyads. Abd al-Rahman led the charge toward al-Fihri's army. Al-Sumayl in turn advanced his cavalry out to meet the Umayyad threat. After a long and difficult fight "Abd ar-Rahman obtained a most complete victory, and the field was strewn with the bodies of the enemy.". Both al-Fihri and al-Sumayl managed to escape the field (probably) with parts of the army too. Abd al-Rahman triumphantly marched into the capital, Córdoba. Danger was not far behind, as al-Fihri planned a <a href="counterattack">counterattack</a>. He reorganized his forces and set out for the capital Abd al-Rahman had usurped from him. Again Abd al-Rahman met al-Fihri with his army; this time negotiations were successful, although the terms were somewhat changed. In exchange for al-Fihri's life and wealth, he would be a prisoner and not allowed to leave the city limits of Córdoba. Al-Fihri would have to report once a day to Abd al-Rahman, as well as turn over some of his sons and daughters as hostages. For a while al-Fihri met the obligations of the one-sided truce, but he still had many people loyal to him; people who would have liked to see him back in power.

Al-Fihri eventually did make another bid for power. He quit Córdoba and quickly started gathering supporters. While at large, al-Fihri managed to gather an army allegedly numbering to 20,000. It is doubtful, however, that his troops were "regular" soldiers, but rather a <a href="wikt%3Ahodge-podge">hodge-podge</a> of men from various parts of al-Andalus. Abd ar-Rahman's appointed governor in Sevilla took up the chase, and after a series of small fights, managed to defeat al-Fihri's army. Al-Fihri himself managed to escape to the former Visigoth capital of <a href="Toledo%2C%20Spain">Toledo</a> in central al-Andalus; once there, he was promptly killed. Al-Fihri's head was sent to Córdoba, where Abd al-Rahman had it nailed to a bridge. With this act, Abd ar-Rahman proclaimed himself the emir of al-Andalus. However, one final act to take over southern Iberia had to be performed: al-Fihri's general, al-Sumayl, had to be dealt with, and he was garroted in Córdoba's jail. Now most of central and northern al-Andalus (Toledo, Zaragoza, Barcelona, etc.) was out of his rule, with large swathes remaining in the hands of <a href="Yusuf%20ibn%20%27Abd%20al-Rahman%20al-Fihri">Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri</a>'s supporters until 779 (submission of Zaragoza).

It is unclear whether Abd al-Rahman proclaimed himself caliph. There are documents in the archives of Cordoba that state that this was his first act upon entering the city. He himself believed he was destined to be Caliph because of prophesies he had heard as a boy, so it seems likely he would. However, historically he is recorded as Emir and not Caliph. Abd al-Rahman's 7th descendent, Abd al-Rahman III, would, however, take up the title of caliph. In the meantime, a call went out through the Muslim world that al-Andalus was a <a href="wikt%3Asafe%20haven">safe haven</a> for friends of the house of Umayya, if not for Abd al-Rahman's scattered family that managed to evade the Abbasids. Abd al-Rahman probably was quite happy to see his call answered by waves of Umayyad faithful and family. He was finally reacquainted with his son Sulayman, whom he last saw weeping on the banks of the Euphrates with his sisters. Abd ar-Rahman's sisters were unable to make the long voyage to al-Andalus. Abd al-Rahman placed his family members in high offices across the land, as he felt he could trust them more than non-family. The Umayyad family would again grow large and prosperous over successive generations. However, by 763 Abd ar-Rahman had to get back to the business of war. Al-Andalus had been invaded by an Abbasid army.

Far away in <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a>, the current Abbasid caliph, <a href="al-Mansur">al-Mansur</a>, had long been planning to depose the Umayyad who dared to call himself emir of al-Andalus. Al-Mansur installed <a href="al-Ala">al-Ala</a> ibn-Mugith (also known as al-Ala) as governor of Africa (whose title gave him dominion over the province of al-Andalus). It was al-Ala who headed the Abbasid army that landed in al-Andalus, possibly near <a href="Beja%20%28Portugal%29">Beja</a> (in modern-day <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>). Much of the surrounding area of Beja capitulated to al-Ala, and in fact rallied under the Abbasid banners against Abd al-Rahman. Abd al-Rahman had to act quickly. The Abbasid contingent was vastly superior in size, said to have numbered 7,000 men. The emir quickly made for the redoubt of Carmona with his army. The Abbasid army was fast on their heels, and laid siege to Carmona for approximately two months. Abd al-Rahman must have sensed that time was against him as food and water became scarce, and his troops morale likely came into question. Finally Abd al-Rahman gathered his men as he was "resolved on an audacious sally". Abd al-Rahman hand-picked 700 fighters from his army and led them to Carmona's main gate. There, he started a great fire and threw his scabbard into the flames. Abd al-Rahman told his men that time had come to go down fighting rather than die of hunger.
The gate lifted and Abd ar-Rahman's men fell upon the unsuspecting Abbasids, thoroughly routing them. Most of the Abbasid army was killed. The heads of the main Abbasid leaders were cut off. Their heads were preserved in salt, and identifying tags pinned to their ears. The heads were bundled together in a gruesome package and sent to the Abbasid caliph who was on pilgrimage at <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a>. Upon receiving the evidence of al-Ala's defeat in al-Andalus, al-Mansur is said to have gasped, "God be praised for placing a sea between us!" Al-Mansur hated, and yet apparently respected Abd al-Rahman to such a degree that he dubbed him the "Hawk of Quraysh" (The Umayyads were from a branch of the Quraysh tribe.)

Despite such a tremendous victory, Abd al-Rahman had to continuously put down rebellions in al-Andalus. Various Arab and Berber tribes fought each other for varying degrees of power, some cities tried to break away and form their own state, and even members of Abd al-Rahman's family tried to wrest power from him. During a large revolt, dissidents marched on Córdoba itself; However, Abd al-Rahman always managed to stay one step ahead, and crushed all opposition; as he always dealt severely with dissidence in al-Andalus. However, this assumption needs to be in perspective, since in 756 he was in charge of a limited number of southern strongholds and he faced resistance to submit from other towns during the next 25 years, rather than revolts.

Despite all this turmoil in al-Andalus, Abd al-Rahman wanted to take the fight back east to Baghdad. Revenge for the massacre of his family at the hands of the Abbasids must surely have been the driving factor in Abd al-Rahman's war plans. However his war against Baghdad was put on hold by more internal problems. The city of Zaragoza on the Upper March remained out of reach of the Umayyad leader since the times of <a href="Yusuf%20ibn%20%27Abd%20al-Rahman%20al-Fihri">Yusuf ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri</a>, bidding for autonomy. Little could Abd al-Rahman have known that as he set off to settle matters in that northern city, his hopes of warring against Baghdad would be indefinitely put on hold.

Zaragoza proved to be a most difficult city to reign over for not only Abd ar-Rahman, but his successors as well. In the year 777–778, several notable men including Sulayman ibn Yokdan al-Arabi al-Kelbi, the self-appointed governor of Zaragoza, met with delegates of the leader of the Franks, <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>. "(Charlemagne's) army was enlisted to help the Muslim governors of Barcelona and Zaragoza against the Umayyad (emir) in Cordoba..." Essentially Charlemagne was being hired as a mercenary, even though he likely had other plans of acquiring the area for his own empire. After Charlemagne's columns arrived at the gates of Zaragoza, Sulayman got cold feet and refused to let the Franks into the city, after his subordinate, <a href="Husayn%20of%20Zaragoza">al-Husayn ibn Yahiya</a>, had successfully defeated and captured Abd al-Rahman's most trusted general, Thalaba Ibn Ubayd. It is possible that he realized that Charlemagne would want to usurp power from him. After capturing Sulayman, Charlemagne's force eventually headed back to France via a narrow pass in the Pyrenees, where his rearguard was wiped out by <a href="Basque%20people">Basque</a> and <a href="Duchy%20of%20Vasconia">Gascon</a> rebels (this disaster inspired the epic <a href="Chanson%20de%20Roland">Chanson de Roland</a>)., Charlemagne also suffered attack from Sulayman's relatives, who had freed Sulayman.

Now Abd al-Rahman could deal with Sulayman and the city of Zaragoza without having to fight a massive Christian army. In 779 Abd al-Rahman offered Husayn, one of Sulayman's allies, the job of Zaragoza's governorship. The temptation was too much for al-Husayn, who murdered his colleague Sulayman. As promised, al-Husayn was awarded Zaragoza with the expectation that he would always be a subordinate of Córdoba. However, within two years al-Husayn broke off relations with Abd al-Rahman and announced that Zaragoza would be an independent city-state. Once again Abd al-Rahman had to be concerned with developments in the Upper March. He was intent on keeping this important northern border city within the Umayyad fold. By 783 Abd al-Rahman's army advanced on Zaragoza. It appeared as though Abd al-Rahman wanted to make clear to this troublesome city that independence was out of the question. Included in the arsenal of Abd al-Rahman's army were thirty-six <a href="siege%20engine">siege engine</a>s. Zaragoza's famous white granite <a href="defensive%20wall">defensive wall</a>s were breached under a torrent of ordnance from the Umayyad lines. Abd al-Rahman's warriors spilled into the city's streets, quickly thwarting al-Husayn's desires for independence.

After the aforementioned period of conflict, Abd al-Rahman continued in his improvement of al-Andalus' infrastructure. He ensured roadways were begun, aqueducts were constructed or improved, and that a new mosque was well funded in his capital at Córdoba. Construction on what would in time become the world-famous <a href="Great%20Mosque%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Great Mosque of Córdoba</a> was started circa the year 786. Abd al-Rahman knew that one of his sons would one day inherit the rule of al-Andalus, but that it was a land torn by strife. In order to successfully rule in such a situation, Abd al-Rahman needed to create a reliable civil service and organize a standing army. He felt that he could not always rely on the local populace in providing a loyal army; and therefore bought a massive <a href="standing%20army">standing army</a> consisting mainly of Berbers from <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a> as well as slaves from other areas. The total number of army-men under his command were nearly 40,000. As was common during the years of Islamic expansion from Arabia, <a href="Religious%20toleration">religious tolerance</a> was practiced. Abd al-Rahman continued to allow Jews and Christians and other monotheistic religions to retain and practice their faiths. They did,and have to pay a tribute tax for this privilege. Abd al-Rahman's policy of taxing non-Muslims, which was often carried out by later rulers, changed the religious dynamic of al-Andalus. Possibly because of excessive tribute taxes "the bulk of the country's population must have become Muslim". However, other scholars have argued that though 80% of al-Andalus converted to Islam, it did not truly occur until near the 10th century.

Christians more often converted to Islam than Jews although there were converted Jews among the new followers of Islam. There was a great deal of freedom of interaction between the groups: for example, Sarah, the granddaughter of the Visigoth king <a href="Wittiza">Wittiza</a>, married a Muslim man and bore two sons who were later counted among the ranks of the highest Arab nobility.

Abd al-Rahman I was able to forge a new Umayyad dynasty by standing successfully against <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>, the <a href="Abassid">Abassid</a>s, the <a href="Berber%20people">Berbers</a>, and other Muslim Spaniards. There is some dispute as to what exactly it was that he created: an extension of the <a href="Umayyad%20Dynasty">Umayyad Dynasty</a> or the new <a href="Caliphate%20of%20Cordoba">Caliphate of Cordoba</a>.

The date of Abd al-Rahman's death is disputed, but is generally accepted to be sometime around 785 through 788. Abd al-Rahman died in his adopted city of Córdoba, and was supposedly buried under the site of the Mezquita. Abd al-Rahman's alleged <a href="favorite%20son">favorite son</a> was his choice for successor, and would later be known as <a href="Hisham%20I">Hisham I</a>. Abd ar-Rahman's progeny would continue to rule al-Andalus in the name of the house of Umayyad for several generations, with the zenith of their power coming during the reign of <a href="Abd%20al-Rahman%20III">Abd al-Rahman III</a>.

Abd al-Rahman was the son of <a href="Mu%27awiya%20ibn%20Hisham">Mu'awiya</a>, son of <a href="Hisham%20ibn%20Abd%20al-Malik">Hisham</a>, son of <a href="Abd%20al-Malik%20ibn%20Marwan">Abd al-Malik</a> according to Abd el-Wahid Merrakechi when reciting his ancestry. Abd al-Rahman's mother was a member from the Nafza Berbers with whom he found refuge after the murder of his family in 750.

Abd al-Rahman married a woman named Hulal. She is said to be the mother of Hisham. Abd al-Rahman was the father of several sons, but the identity of their mother(s) is not clear:

In his lifetime, Abd al-Rahman was known as "al Dakhil" ("the Entrant"). But he was also known as "Saqr Quraish" ("The Falcon of the <a href="Quraysh%20%28tribe%29">Quraish</a>"), bestowed on him by one of his greatest enemies, the Abbasid caliph <a href="al-Mansur">al-Mansur</a>.

According to the chroniclers, the Abbasid caliph <a href="al-Mansur">al-Mansur</a> once asked his courtiers who deserved the exalted title of "Falcon of the <a href="Quraysh%20%28tribe%29">Quraysh</a>" ("Saqr Quraish", foremost of the Prophet's tribe). The obsequious courtiers naturally replied "You, O <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Faithful">Commander of the Faithful</a>!", but the Caliph said no. Then they suggested <a href="Muawiyah%20I">Mu'awiya</a> (founder of the Umayyad Caliphate), but the Caliph again said no. Then they suggested <a href="Abd%20al-Malik%20ibn%20Marwan">Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan</a> (one of the greatest of the Umayyad caliphs), but again no. Then who, they asked, and the Caliph al-Mansur replied:

Abd-ar-Rahman III

Abd-ar-Rahman III (′Abd ar-Rahmān ibn Muhammad ibn ′Abd Allāh ibn Muhammad ibn ′abd ar-Rahman ibn al-Hakam ar-Rabdi ibn Hisham ibn ′abd ar-Rahman ad-Dakhil; ; 11 January 889/9115 October 961) was the <a href="Emir%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Emir</a> and <a href="Caliph%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Caliph of Córdoba</a> (912–961) of the <a href="Umayyads">Umayyad</a> dynasty in <a href="al-Andalus">al-Andalus</a>. Called "al-Nasir li-Din Allah" ("the Defender of God's Faith"), he ascended the throne in his early 20s, and reigned for half a century as the most powerful prince of Iberia. Although people of all creeds enjoyed tolerance and <a href="freedom%20of%20religion">freedom of religion</a> under his rule, he repelled the <a href="Fatimid">Fatimid</a>s, partly by supporting their <a href="Maghrawa">Maghrawa</a> enemies in <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, and partly by claiming the title <a href="Caliph">Caliph</a> (ruler of the <a href="Muslim%20world">Islamic world</a>) for himself.

Abd ar-Rahman was born in <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Spain">Córdoba</a>, the grandson of <a href="Abdullah%20ibn%20Muhammad%20al-Umawi%20">Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi </a>, seventh independent <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyad</a> emir of <a href="al-Andalus">al-Andalus</a>. His parents were Abdullah's son Muhammad and Muzna (or Muzayna), a Christian concubine. His paternal grandmother was also a Christian, the royal infanta <a href="Onneca%20Fort%C3%BAnez">Onneca Fortúnez</a>, daughter of the captive king <a href="Fort%C3%BAn%20Garc%C3%A9s%20of%20Pamplona">Fortún Garcés of Pamplona</a>. Abd ar-Rahman was thus nephew in the half-blood of queen <a href="Toda%20of%20Pamplona">Toda of Pamplona</a>. He is described as having "white skin, blue eyes and attractive face; good looking, although somewhat sturdy and stout. His legs were short, to the point that the stirrups of his saddle were mounted just one palm under it. When mounted, he looked tall, but on his feet he was quite short. He dyed his beard black.

Muhammad was assassinated by his brother Al-Mutarrif, who had allegedly grown jealous of the favour Muhammad had gained in the eyes of their father Abdallah. Al-Mutarrif had accused Muhammad of plotting with the rebel <a href="Umar%20ibn%20Hafsun">Umar ibn Hafsun</a>, and Muhammad had been imprisoned. According to some sources, the emir himself was behind Muhammad's fall, as well as Al-Mutarrif's death in 895. Abd ar-Rahman spent his youth in his mother's harem. Al-Mutarrif's sister, known as "al-Sayyida" ("the Lady"), was entrusted with his education. She made sure that Abd ar-Rahman's education was conducted with some rigor.

Emir Abdallah died at the age of 72. Despite the fact that four of his sons (Aban, Abd al Rahman, Muhammad and Ahmad) were alive at the time of his death, all of them were passed over for succession. Abdallah instead chose as his successor his grandson, Abd al-Rahman III (the son of his first son). This came as no surprise, since Abdallah had already demonstrated his affection for his grandson in many ways, namely by allowing him to live in his own tower (something he did not allow for any of his sons), and allowing him to sit on the throne on some festive occasions. Most importantly Abdallah gave Abd al-Rahman his ring, the symbol of power, when Abdallah fell ill prior to his death. Abd al-Rahman succeeded Abdallah the day after his death, 16 October 912. Historiographers of the time, such as "<a href="Al-Bayan%20al-Mughrib">Al-Bayan al-Mughrib</a>" and the "Crónica anónima de Abd al-Rahman III", state that his succession was "without incident". At the time, Abd al-Rahman was about 21 or 22 years old. He inherited an emirate on the verge of dissolution, his power extending not far beyond the vicinity of Córdoba. To the north, the Christian <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Asturias">Kingdom of Asturias</a> was continuing its program of "<a href="Reconquista">Reconquista</a>" in the <a href="Douro">Douro</a> valley. To the south in <a href="Ifriqiya">Ifriqiya</a>, the <a href="Fatimid%20Caliphate">Fatimids</a> had created an independent caliphate that threatened to attract the allegiance of the Muslim population, who had suffered under the harsh rule of Abdullah. On the internal front the discontented <a href="Muladi">Muladi</a> families (Muslims of Iberian origin) represented a constant danger for the Córdoban emir. The most powerful of the latter was Umar ibn Hafsun, who, from his impregnable fortress of <a href="Umar%20ibn%20Hafsun">Umar ibn Hafsun</a>, controlled much of eastern Al-Andalus.

From the very early stages of his reign, Abd ar-Rahman showed a firm resolve to quash the rebels of al-Andalus, consolidate centralized power, and reestablish internal order within the emirate. Within 10 days of taking the throne, he exhibited the head of a rebel leader in Cordoba. From this point on he led annual expeditions against the northern and southern tribes to maintain control over them. To accomplish his aims he introduced into the court the "<a href="saqaliba">saqaliba</a>h", slaves of East European origin. The "saqalibah" represented a third ethnic group that could neutralize the endless strife between his subjects of Muslim <a href="Arabs">Arab</a> heritage, and those of Muslim <a href="Berbers">Berber</a> heritage.

<a href="Hasdai%20ibn%20Shaprut">Hasdai ibn Shaprut</a>, a Jewish courtier of the king's court who served as financier to the king, wrote of the king's revenues on this wise:
During the first 20 years of his rule, Abd ar-Rahman avoided military action against the northern Christian kingdoms, Asturias and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Navarre">Kingdom of Navarre</a>. The Muladi rebels were the first problem he confronted. Those powerful families were supported by Iberians who were openly or secretly Christians and had acted with the rebels. These elements, which formed the bulk of the population, were not averse to supporting a strong ruler who would protect them against the Arab aristocracy. Abd ar-Rahman moved to subdue them by means of a mercenary army that included Christians.
He first had to suppress the rebel Umar ibn Hafsun. On 1 January 913 an army, led by the eunuch Badr, conquered the fortress of <a href="%C3%89cija">Écija</a>, at some from the capital. All the city's fortifications were destroyed, aside from the citadel, which was left as residence of the governor and a garrison for the emiral troops. In the following spring, after sixty-five days of meticulous preparations, Abd ar-Rahman personally led an expedition to the south of his realm. His troops were able to recover the "coras" (provinces) of <a href="Province%20of%20Ja%C3%A9n%20%28Spain%29">Jaén</a> and <a href="Province%20of%20Granada">Granada</a>, while a cavalry detachment was sent to free <a href="M%C3%A1laga">Málaga</a> from ibn Hafsun's siege. He also obtained the capitulation of <a href="Fi%C3%B1ana">Fiñana</a> (in the modern <a href="province%20of%20Almer%C3%ADa">province of Almería</a>), after setting fire to its suburbs. Subsequently he moved against the castle of <a href="Juviles">Juviles</a> in the <a href="Alpujarras">Alpujarras</a>. After devastating its countryside to deprive it of any resource, he encircled it. Finding it difficult to bombard with catapults, he ordered the construction of a platform where his <a href="siege%20engine">siege engine</a>s could be mounted to greater effect, and cut the water supply. The Muladi defenders surrendered after a few days: their lives, apart from fifty-five die-hards who were beheaded, were spared in exchange of their allegiance to the emir. The campaign continued in a similar vein, lasting for a total of ninety days. Abd ar-Rahman forced the defeated Muladi to send hostages and treasures to Córdoba, in order to secure their continued submission.

In the first year of his reign, Abd ar-Rahman took advantage of the rivalries between the <a href="Banu%20Hayyay">Banu Hayyay</a> lords of <a href="Seville">Seville</a> and <a href="Carmona%2C%20Spain">Carmona</a> to force them to submit. He initially sent a special corps ("hasam") under Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Hudayr, governor of Écija, to Seville, to obtain their submission. This attempt failed, but gained him the support of Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn Hayyay, lord of Carmona, and a cousin of the Sevillan lord, Ahmad ibn Maslama. When the latter was surrounded by Umayyad troops, he sued for help to Ibn Hafsun, but the latter was defeated by the besiegers and returned to Bobastro. He next went after the forts in the provinces of Elvira, <a href="Province%20of%20Granada">Granada</a>, and <a href="Province%20of%20Ja%C3%A9n%20%28Spain%29">Jaen</a>, all of which were either directly or indirectly controlled by Hafsun. Seville finally capitulated on 20 December 913. Ibn al-Mundir al-Qurays, a member of the royal family, was named governor of the city, while the Lord of Carmona obtained the title of <a href="vizier">vizier</a>. Muhammad ibn Ibrahim enjoyed his office for only a single day, for Abd ar-Rahman soon discovered his collusion with the rebel governor of Carmona. Muhammad was sent to prison, where he later met his death.

The region of <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a> submitted peacefully in 915.

Abd ar-Rahman's next objective was to quash the longstanding rebellion of Umar ibn Hafsun.

His troops left Córdoba on 7 May 914 and, after a few days, encamped before the walls of Balda (identified with today's <a href="Cuevas%20de%20San%20Marcos">Cuevas de San Marcos</a>). His cavalry ravaged the nearby woods and the countryside, while the rest of the troopes moved to Turrus, a castle located in the present municipality of <a href="Algarinejo">Algarinejo</a>, which was surrounded within five days, while its environs were also devastated.

The Umayyad army then moved to the citadel of Umar ibn Hafsun, while the cavalry was sent to the castle of Sant Batir, which was abandoned by the defenders, allowing Abd ar-Rahman's troops to secure a large booty. Then it was the turn of the castles of Olías and Reina. The latter fell after a violent fight, leaving the road open to the major city and provincial capital of Málaga, which he captured after one day. Abd ar-Rahman then turned and followed the coast by Montemayor, near <a href="Benahav%C3%ADs">Benahavís</a>, Suhayl (<a href="Fuengirola">Fuengirola</a>) and another castle called "Turrus "or "Turrus Jusayn" (identified by <a href="%C3%89variste%20L%C3%A9vi-Proven%C3%A7al">Évariste Lévi-Provençal</a> as <a href="Oj%C3%A9n">Ojén</a>). He finally arrived at <a href="Algeciras">Algeciras</a> on 1 June 914. He ordered a patrol of the coast to destroy the boats that supplied the citadel of Umar ibn Hafsun from the <a href="Maghreb">Maghreb</a>. Many of them were captured and set afire in front of the emir. The rebellious castles near Algeciras surrendered as soon as the Cordoban army manifested itself.

Abd ar-Rahman launched three different campaigns against Ibn Hafsun (who died in 917) and his sons. Among them, Jafar ibn Hafsun held the stronghold of Toledo. Abd ar-Rahman ordered ravaged the city's countryside. Jafar, after two years of siege, escaped the city to ask for help in the northern Christian kingdoms. In the meantime Abd ar-Rahman obtained the surrender of the city from its population, after promising them immunity, although 4,000 rebel men escaped in a night sally. The city surrendered on 2 August 932, after a siege of two years.

In 921 the Banu Muhallab of <a href="Guadix">Guadix</a> submitted, followed by those of <a href="Jerez%20de%20la%20Frontera">Jerez de la Frontera</a> and <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a>, as well as the trading republic of <a href="Pechina">Pechina</a> (922). In 927, Abd-ar-Rahman also launched a campaign against the rebel <a href="Banu%20Qasi">Banu Qasi</a>, but was forced to break it off by the intervention of <a href="Jimeno%20Garc%C3%A9s%20of%20Pamplona">Jimeno Garcés of Pamplona</a>.

The last of Ibn Hafsun to fall was Hafs, who commanded his powerful fortress of Umar ibn Hafsun. Surrounded by Abd ar-Rahman's vizier Said ibn al-Mundhir who had ordered the construction of bastions around the city, he resisted the siege for six months, until he surrendered in 928 and had his life spared.

The continued expeditions against the Hafsunids did not distract Abd ad-Rahman III from the situation of other regions in al-Andalus, which recognized him only nominally, if not being in open revolt. Most of the loyal governors of the cities were in a weak position, such as the governor of <a href="%C3%89vora">Évora</a>, who could not prevent the attack of the king of Galicia (future king of León), <a href="Ordo%C3%B1o%20II%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Ordoño II</a>, who captured the city in the summer of 913, taking back a sizable booty and 4,000 prisoners and massacring many Muslims.

In much of the eastern and western province, Abd ar-Rahman's authority was completely unrecognized. The lord of Badajoz, Abd Allah ibn Muhammad, grandson of Abd-ar-Rahman ibn Marwan al-Yilliqi, not only fortified his city against a possible attack from Ordoño, but also acted in complete independence from Córdoba. To avoid the fall of Évora into the hands of the Berber groups of the region, he ordered the destruction of its defensive towers and lowered the walls, though a year later he decided to reconstruct it, giving its control to his ally Masud ibn Sa' dun al-Surunbaqi. The Algarve was dominated completely by a muladí coalition led by Sa'id ibn Mal, who had expelled the Arabs from <a href="Beja%20%28Portugal%29">Beja</a>, and the lords of <a href="Faro%2C%20Portugal">Ocsónoba</a>, Yahya ibn Bakr, and of <a href="Taifa%20of%20Niebla">Niebla</a>, Ibn Ufayr.

The absence of royal authority enabled Ordoño II to easily campaign in this area, his main objective being the city of <a href="M%C3%A9rida%2C%20Spain">Mérida</a>, in the summer of 915. Abd ar-Rahman III did not send an army and only several local Berber "jefes" offered some resistance which was ineffective.

In the next year, despite having defeated only some of the rebels, Abd ar-Rahman III considered himself powerful enough to declare himself <a href="Caliph%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Caliph of Córdoba</a> (16 January 929), effectively breaking his allegiance to, and ties with, the <a href="Fatimid">Fatimid</a> and <a href="Abbasid">Abbasid</a> caliphs. The caliphate was thought only to belong to the Emperor who ruled over the sacred cities of <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a> and <a href="Medina">Medina</a>, and his ancestors had until then been content with the title of emir. But the force of this tradition had weakened over time; and the title increased Abd-ar-Rahman's prestige with his subjects, both in Iberia and Africa. He based his claim to the caliphate on his Umayyad ancestors who had held undisputed control of the caliphate until they were overthrown by the Abbasids.

Abd ar-Rahman's move made him both the political and the religious leader of all the Muslims in al-Andalus, as well as the protector of his Christian and Jewish subjects. The symbols of his new caliphate power were a scepter ("jayzuran") and the throne ("sarir"). In the mint he had founded in November 928, Abd ar-Rahman started to coin golden dinars and silver dirhams, replacing the "al-Andalus" title with his name.

In his new role of caliph, he achieved the surrender of <a href="Ibn%20Marwan">Ibn Marwan</a> of Badajoz in 930. On the southern front, to counter the increasing Fatimid power in North Africa, abd ar-Rahmad ordered the construction of a fleet based in <a href="Almeria">Almeria</a>. The caliph helped the <a href="Maghrawa">Maghrawa</a> Berbers conquer <a href="Melilla">Melilla</a> (927), <a href="Ceuta">Ceuta</a> (931) and <a href="Tangiers">Tangiers</a> (951), which accepted his suzerainty. However, he was unable to defeat <a href="Jawhar%20al-Siqilli">Jawhar al-Siqilli</a> of the <a href="Fatamid">Fatamid</a>s. In 951 he signed a peace with the new king of León, <a href="Ordo%C3%B1o%20III%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Ordoño III</a>, in order to have a free hand against the Fatimids whose ships were harassing the caliphate ones in the Mediterranean and had even launched an assault against Almeria. Abd ar-Rahman's force, led by prime minister Ahmad ibn Said, besieged the Fatimid port of Tunis, which bought its safety through paying a huge sum.

In the end he was able to create a protectorate covering the northern and central Maghreb, supporting the <a href="Idrisid">Idrisid</a> dynasty; the caliphate influence in the area disappeared after a Fatimid offensive in 958, after which abd ar-Rahman kept only the strongholds of Ceuta and Tangiers.

Even before al-Andalus was firmly under his rule, he had restarted the war against King <a href="Ordo%C3%B1o%20II%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Ordoño II of León</a>, who had taken advantage of the previous troublesome situation to capture some boundary areas and menace the Umayyad territory. In 917 the then emir had sent a large army under his general Ahmad ibn Abi Abda against León, but this force was destroyed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Esteban%20de%20Gormaz%20%28917%29">Battle of San Esteban de Gormaz</a> in September of that year.

Recognizing he had underestimated the power of Ordoño II, in 920 Abd ar-Rahman mustered another powerful army to reclaim the territories lost after the previous campaign. He captured the forts of <a href="Osma">Osma</a> and <a href="San%20Esteban%20de%20Gormaz">San Esteban de Gormaz</a>. After defeating King <a href="Sancho%20Garc%C3%A9s%20I%20of%20Navarre">Sancho Garcés I of Navarre</a> and the king of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Leon</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Valdejunquera">Valdejunquera</a> on 26 July, he penetrated into Navarre, overcoming Aragon by the classic route of the invasions from the south. Abd ar-Rahman reached the Basque city of <a href="Pamplona">Pamplona</a>, which was sacked and its cathedral church demolished.

In 924 Abd-ar-Rahman felt obliged to avenge the massacre of Viguera castle perpetrated by King Sancho Ordóñez of Navarre one year earlier. he launched counter offensive against Sancho in which Abd-ar-Rahman devastated a large area of Basque territory.

The succession crisis which struck León after Ordoño II's death in the same year caused hostilities to cease until <a href="Ramiro%20II%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Ramiro II</a> obtained the throne in 932; a first attempt by him to assist the besieged rebels in Toledo was repelled in 932, despite the Christian king capturing <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> and scoring a victory at <a href="Osma">Osma</a>.

In 934, after reasserting supremacy over Pamplona and <a href="%C3%81lava">Álava</a>, Abd-ar-Rahmad forced Ramiro to retreat to <a href="Burgos">Burgos</a>, and forced the Navarrese queen <a href="Toda%20of%20Navarre">Toda</a>, his aunt, to submit to him as a vassal and withdraw from direct rule as regent for her son <a href="Garc%C3%ADa%20S%C3%A1nchez%20I%20of%20Pamplona">García Sánchez I</a>. In 937 Abd-ar-Rahmad conquered some thirty castles in León. Next he turned to Muhammad ibn Hashim at-Tugib, governor of <a href="Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a>, who had allied with Ramiro but was pardoned after the capture of his city.

Despite early defeats, Ramiro and García were able to crush the caliphate army in 939 at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Simancas">Battle of Simancas</a>, and almost kill Abd-ar-Rahman, due, most likely, to treason by Arab elements in the caliph's army. After this defeat, Abd-ar-Rahman stopped taking personal command of his military campaigns. His cause was helped, however, by <a href="Fern%C3%A1n%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20of%20Castile">Fernán González of Castile</a>, one of the Christian leaders at Simancas, who subsequently launched a sustained rebellion against Ramiro. The victory of Simancas enabled the Christian kingdom to maintain the military initiative in the peninsula until the defeat of Ramiro's successor, <a href="Ordo%C3%B1o%20III%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Ordoño III of León</a>, in 956. However they did not press this advantage as civil war broke out in the Christian territories.

In 950 Abd ar-Rahman received in Córdoba an embassy from count <a href="Borrell%20II%20of%20Barcelona">Borrell II of Barcelona</a>, by which the northern county recognized caliphate supremacy in exchange for peace and mutual support. In 958, <a href="Sancho%20I%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Sancho</a>, the exiled king of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Leon</a>, <a href="Garc%C3%ADa%20S%C3%A1nchez%20I">Garcia Sanchez</a>, King of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Navarre">Navarre</a>, and <a href="Toda%20of%20Navarre">Queen Toda</a> all paid homage to Abd-ar-Rahman in <a href="Caliphate%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Cordoba</a>.

Until 961, the caliphate played an active role in the dynastic strife characterizing the Christian kingdom during the period. Ordoño III's half-brother and successor, <a href="Sancho%20I%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Sancho the Fat</a>, had been deposed by his cousin <a href="Ordo%C3%B1o%20IV%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">Ordoño IV</a>. Together with his grandmother Toda of Navarre, Sancho sought an alliance with Córdoba. In exchange for some castles, Abd-ar-Rahman helped them to take back <a href="Zamora%2C%20Spain">Zamora</a> (959) and <a href="Oviedo">Oviedo</a> (960) and to overthrow Ordoño IV.

Abd-ar-Rahman was accused of having sunk in his later years into the self-indulgent habits of the <a href="harem">harem</a>. He is known to have openly kept a male as well as a female harem. This likely influenced the polemical story of his falling in love with a 13-year-old boy (later enshrined as a Christian martyr and canonised as <a href="Pelagius%20of%20Cordova">Saint Pelagius of Córdoba</a>) who refused the Caliph's advances. The love story may have been a construct on top of an original tale, however, in which he ordered the boy-slave to convert to Islam. Either way, enraged, he had the boy tortured and dismembered, thus contributing to the Christian perception of Muslim brutality.

Abd-ar-Rahman spent the rest of his years in his new palace outside Córdoba. He died in October 961 and was succeeded by his son <a href="al-Hakam%20II">al-Hakam II</a>.

Abd-ar-Rahman was a patron of arts, especially architecture. A third of his revenue sufficed for the ordinary expenses of government, a third was hoarded, and a third was spent on buildings. After declaring the caliphate, he had a massive palace complex, known as the <a href="Medina%20Azahara">Medina Azahara</a>, built some five kilometers north of Córdoba. The Medina Azahara was modeled after the old Umayyad palace in <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> and served as a symbolic tie between the new caliph and his ancestors. It was said that Cordoba contained 3000 mosques and 100,000 shops and homes during his reign.

Under his reign, Córdoba became the most important intellectual centre of Western Europe. He expanded the city's library, which would be further enriched by his successors.

He also reinforced the Iberian fleet, which became the most powerful in <a href="Mediterranean%20Europe">Mediterranean Europe</a>. Iberian raiders moved up to <a href="Galicia%20%28Spain%29">Galicia</a>, Asturias, and North Africa. The colonizers of <a href="Fraxinetum">Fraxinetum</a> came from al-Andalus as well.

Due to his consolidation of power, Muslim Iberia became a power for a few centuries. It also brought prosperity, and with this he created mints where pure gold and silver coins were created. He renovated and added to the <a href="Mosque%E2%80%93Cathedral%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba</a>.

He was very wary of losing control and kept tight reins in his family. In 949, he executed one of his sons for conspiring against him. He was tolerant of non-Muslims, Jews and Christians who were treated fairly. European nations sent emissaries such as from <a href="Otto%20I">Otto I</a> of Germany, and the <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> emperor.

Abd-ar-Rahman III's mother Muzna was a Christian captive, possibly from the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenean</a> region. His paternal grandmother <a href="Onneca%20Fort%C3%BAnez">Onneca Fortúnez</a> was a Christian princess from the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Navarre">Kingdom of Pamplona</a>. In his immediate ancestry, Abd-ar-Rahman III was Hispano–<a href="Basque%20people">Basque</a> and <a href="Arab%20people">Arab</a>.

Abdülaziz

Abdülaziz (<a href="Ottoman%20Turkish%20language">Ottoman Turkish</a>: عبد العزيز / "`Abdü’l-`Azīz", ; 9 February 18304 June 1876) was the 32nd <a href="List%20of%20sultans%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">Sultan</a> of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and reigned between 25 June 1861 and 30 May 1876. He was the son of Sultan <a href="Mahmud%20II">Mahmud II</a> and succeeded his brother <a href="Abd%C3%BClmecid%20I">Abdülmecid I</a> in 1861.

Born at Eyüp Palace, Constantinople (present-day <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>), on 9/18 February 1830, Abdülaziz received an Ottoman education but was nevertheless an ardent admirer of the material progress that was made in the West. He was the first Ottoman Sultan who travelled to <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a>, visiting a number of important European capitals including <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="London">London</a> and <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> in the summer of 1867.

Apart from his passion for the <a href="Ottoman%20Navy">Ottoman Navy</a>, which had the world's third largest fleet in 1875 (after the British and French navies), the Sultan took an interest in documenting the Ottoman Empire. He was also interested in literature and was a talented <a href="classical%20music">classical music</a> composer. Some of his compositions, together with those of the other members of the <a href="Ottoman%20dynasty">Ottoman dynasty</a>, have been collected in the album ""European Music at the Ottoman Court"" by the London Academy of Ottoman Court Music.

His parents were <a href="Mahmud%20II">Mahmud II</a> and <a href="Pertevniyal%20Sultan">Pertevniyal Sultan</a>. (1812–1883), originally named Besime, a <a href="Circassians">Circassian</a>. He was a quarter French. In 1868 Pertevniyal was residing at <a href="Dolmabah%C3%A7e%20Palace">Dolmabahçe Palace</a>. That year Abdülaziz led the visiting <a href="Eug%C3%A9nie%20de%20Montijo">Eugénie de Montijo</a>, Empress of France, to see his mother. Pertevniyal perceived the presence of a foreign woman within her quarters of the <a href="seraglio">seraglio</a> as an insult. She reportedly <a href="Slapping%20%28strike%29">slapped</a> Eugénie across the face, almost resulting in an international incident. According to another account, Pertevniyal became outraged by the forwardness of Eugénie taking the arm of one of her sons while he gave a tour of the palace garden, and she gave the Empress a slap on the stomach as a possibly more subtly intended than often represented reminder that they were not in France. The <a href="Pertevniyal%20Valide%20Sultan%20Mosque">Pertevniyal Valide Sultan Mosque</a> was built under the patronage of his mother. The construction work began in November 1869 and the mosque was finished in 1871.

His paternal grandparents were Sultan <a href="Abdul%20Hamid%20I">Abdul Hamid I</a> and Sultana <a href="Nak%C5%9Fidil%20Sultan">Nakşidil Sultan</a>. Several accounts identify his paternal grandmother with <a href="Aim%C3%A9e%20du%20Buc%20de%20Riv%C3%A9ry">Aimée du Buc de Rivéry</a>, a cousin of <a href="Jos%C3%A9phine%20de%20Beauharnais">Joséphine de Beauharnais</a>. Pertevniyal was a sister of Khushiyar Qadin, third wife of <a href="Ibrahim%20Pasha%20of%20Egypt">Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt</a>. Khushiyar and Ibrahim were the parents of <a href="Isma%27il%20Pasha">Isma'il Pasha</a>.

Between 1861 and 1871, the <a href="Tanzimat">Tanzimat</a> reforms which began during the reign of his brother <a href="Abd%C3%BClmecid%20I">Abdülmecid I</a> were continued under the leadership of his chief ministers, <a href="Mehmed%20Fuad%20Pasha">Mehmed Fuad Pasha</a> and <a href="Mehmed%20Emin%20Aali%20Pasha">Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha</a>. <a href="Subdivisions%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire%23Administrative%20reform%2C%201864">New administrative districts ("vilayets")</a> were set up in 1864 and a <a href="Council%20of%20State">Council of State</a> was established in 1868. Public education was organized on the <a href="Education%20in%20France">French model</a> and <a href="Istanbul%20University">Istanbul University</a> was reorganised as a modern institution in 1861. He was also integral in establishing the first Ottoman civil code.

Abdülaziz cultivated good relations with the <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">Second French Empire</a> and the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. In 1867 he was the first Ottoman sultan to visit <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a>; his trip included a visit to the United Kingdom, where he was made a <a href="List%20of%20Knights%20and%20Ladies%20of%20the%20Garter">Knight of the Garter</a> by <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and shown a <a href="Fleet%20Review%2C%20Royal%20Navy%23Queen%20Victoria">Royal Navy Fleet Review</a> with <a href="Isma%27il%20Pasha">Ismail Pasha</a>. He travelled by a private rail car, which today can be found in the <a href="Rahmi%20M.%20Ko%C3%A7%20Museum">Rahmi M. Koç Museum</a> in Istanbul. His fellow Knights of the Garter created in 1867 were <a href="Charles%20Gordon-Lennox%2C%206th%20Duke%20of%20Richmond">Charles Gordon-Lennox, 6th Duke of Richmond</a>, <a href="Charles%20Manners%2C%206th%20Duke%20of%20Rutland">Charles Manners, 6th Duke of Rutland</a>, <a href="Henry%20Somerset%2C%208th%20Duke%20of%20Beaufort">Henry Somerset, 8th Duke of Beaufort</a>, <a href="Prince%20Arthur%2C%20Duke%20of%20Connaught%20and%20Strathearn">Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn</a> (a son of Queen Victoria), <a href="Franz%20Joseph%20I%20of%20Austria">Franz Joseph I of Austria</a> and <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II of Russia</a>.

Also in 1867, Abdülaziz became the first Ottoman <a href="Sultan">Sultan</a> to formally recognize the title of <a href="Khedive">Khedive</a> (Viceroy) to be used by the <a href="W%C4%81li">Vali</a> (Governor) of the <a href="Egypt%20Eyalet">Ottoman Eyalet of Egypt and Sudan</a> (1517–1867), which thus became the autonomous <a href="Khedivate%20of%20Egypt">Ottoman Khedivate of Egypt and Sudan</a> (1867–1914). <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20of%20Egypt">Muhammad Ali Pasha</a> and his descendants had been the governors (Vali) of Ottoman Egypt and Sudan since 1805, but were willing to use the higher title of Khedive, which was unrecognized by the Ottoman government until 1867. In return, the first Khedive, <a href="Isma%27il%20Pasha">Ismail Pasha</a>, had agreed a year earlier (in 1866) to increase the annual tax revenues which Egypt and Sudan would provide for the Ottoman treasury. Between 1854 and 1894, the revenues from Egypt and Sudan were often declared as a <a href="surety">surety</a> by the Ottoman government for borrowing loans from British and French banks. After the Ottoman government declared a <a href="sovereign%20default">sovereign default</a> on its foreign debt repayments on 30 October 1875, which triggered the <a href="Great%20Eastern%20Crisis">Great Eastern Crisis</a> in the empire's Balkan provinces that led to the devastating <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877%E2%80%9378%29">Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)</a> and the establishment of the <a href="Ottoman%20Public%20Debt%20Administration">Ottoman Public Debt Administration</a> in 1881, the importance for Britain of the sureties regarding the Ottoman revenues from Egypt and Sudan increased. Combined with the much more important <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> which was opened in 1869, these sureties were influential in the British government's decision to <a href="History%20of%20Egypt%20under%20the%20British">occupy Egypt and Sudan</a> in 1882, with the pretext of helping the Ottoman-Egyptian government to put down the <a href="%E2%80%98Urabi%20Revolt">Urabi Revolt</a> (1879–1882). Egypt and Sudan (together with <a href="Cyprus%20Convention">Cyprus</a>) nominally remained Ottoman territories until 5 November 1914, when the British Empire declared war against the Ottoman Empire during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

In 1869, Abdülaziz received visits from <a href="Eug%C3%A9nie%20de%20Montijo">Eugénie de Montijo</a>, Empress consort of <a href="Napoleon%20III%20of%20France">Napoleon III of France</a> and other foreign monarchs on their way to the opening of the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. The <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>, the future <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>, twice visited Constantinople.

By 1871 both <a href="Mehmed%20Fuad%20Pasha">Mehmed Fuad Pasha</a> and <a href="Mehmed%20Emin%20Aali%20Pasha">Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha</a> were dead. The Second French Empire, his Western European model, had been defeated in the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> by the <a href="North%20German%20Confederation">North German Confederation</a> under the leadership of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a>. Abdülaziz turned to the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> for friendship, as unrest in the Balkan provinces continued. In 1875, the <a href="Herzegovina%20Uprising%20%281875-1878%29">Herzegovinian rebellion</a> was the beginning of further unrest in the Balkan provinces. In 1876, the <a href="April%20Uprising">April Uprising</a> saw insurrection spreading among the <a href="Bulgarians">Bulgarians</a>. Ill feeling mounted against Russia for its encouragement of the rebellions.

While no one event led to his being deposed, the crop failure of 1873 and his lavish expenditures on the <a href="Ottoman%20Navy">Ottoman Navy</a> and on new palaces which he had built, along with mounting public debt, helped to create an atmosphere conducive to his being overthrown. Abdülaziz was deposed by his ministers on 30 May 1876.

Abdülaziz's death at <a href="%C3%87%C4%B1ra%C4%9Fan%20Palace">Çırağan Palace</a> in Constantinople a few days later was documented as a suicide at the time, but suspicions of magnicide promptly erupted.

In <a href="Abdul%20Hamid%20II">Sultan Abdulhamid II</a>'s recently surfaced memoirs, the event is described as an assassination by the order of <a href="H%C3%BCseyin%20Avni%20Pasha">Hüseyin Avni Pasha</a> and <a href="Midhat%20Pasha">Midhat Pasha</a>. According to this source, when <a href="Murad%20V">Sultan Murad V</a> began to show signs of paranoia, madness and continuous fainting and vomiting even on the day of his coronation and threw himself into a pool yelling at his guards to protect his life, they were afraid the public would become outraged and revolt to bring the former Sultan back. Within a few days, on 4 June 1876, they arranged for Sultan Abdülaziz to kill himself with scissors, cutting his wrists.

On the morning of June 5, Abdülaziz asked for a pair of scissors with which to trim his beard. Shortly after this he was found dead in a pool of blood flowing from two wounds in his arms. His body was examined by 17 physicians ("Dr. Marco, Nouri, A. Sotto, Physician attached to the Imperial and Royal Embassy of Austria‐Hungary; Dr. Spagnolo, Marc Markel, Jatropoulo, Abdinour, Servet, J. de Castro, A. Marroin, Julius Millingen, C. Caratheodori; E. D. Dickson, Physician of the British Embassy; Dr. O. Vitalis, Physician of the Sanitary Board; Dr. E. Spadare, J. Nouridjian, Miltiadi Bey, Mustafa, Mehmed") who certified that the death had been “caused by the loss of blood produced by the wounds of the blood‐vessels at the joints of the arms” and that “the direction and nature of the wounds, together with the instrument which is said to have produced them, lead us to conclude that suicide had been committed.” 

One of those physicians also stated that “His skin was very pale, and entirely free from bruises, marks or spots of any kind whatever. There was no lividity of the lips indicating suffocation nor any sign of pressure having been applied to the throat.” 


Abdülaziz had five consorts:

The municipality of Abdera (<a href="Modern%20Greek">Modern Greek</a>: ) has 19,005 inhabitants (2011). The seat of the municipality is the town <a href="Genisea">Genisea</a>.

Its mythical foundation was attributed to <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a> who founded the city on behalf of his fallen friend <a href="Abderus">Abderus</a>. The historical founding is traced back to a colony from <a href="Klazomenai">Klazomenai</a>. This historical founding was traditionally dated to 654 BC, which is unverified, although evidence in 7th century BC <a href="Pottery%20of%20ancient%20Greece">Greek pottery</a> tends to support it. But its prosperity dates from 544 BC, when the majority of the people of <a href="Teos">Teos</a> (including the poet <a href="Anacreon">Anacreon</a>) migrated to Abdera to escape the <a href="Iran">Persian</a> yoke (<a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> i.168). The chief coin type, a "<a href="griffon">griffon</a>", is identical with that of Teos; the rich silver coinage is noted for the beauty and variety of its reverse types.

In 513 BC and 512 BC, the Persians conquered Abdera. In 496 BC, the Persians again conquered Abdera, this time under <a href="Darius%20I">Darius I</a>. It later became part of the <a href="Delian%20League">Delian League</a> and fought on the side of Athens in the <a href="Peloponnesian%20war">Peloponnesian war</a>.

Abdera was a wealthy city, the third richest in the League, due to its status as a prime port for trade with the interior of Thrace and the <a href="Odrysian%20kingdom">Odrysian kingdom</a>.

A valuable prize, the city was repeatedly sacked: by the <a href="Triballi">Triballi</a> in 376 BC, <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a> in 350 BC; later by <a href="Lysimachus">Lysimachos of Thrace</a>, the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucids</a>, the <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemies</a>, and again by the Macedonians. In 170 BC the Roman armies and those of <a href="Eumenes%20II">Eumenes II of Pergamon</a> besieged and sacked it.

The town seems to have declined in importance after the middle of the 4th century BC. Cicero ridicules the city as a byword for stupidity in his letters to <a href="Atticus%20%28philosopher%29">Atticus</a>, writing of a debate in the Senate, "Here was Abdera, but I wasn't silent" ("Hic, Abdera non tacente me"). Nevertheless, the city counted among its citizens the philosophers <a href="Democritus">Democritus</a>, <a href="Protagoras">Protagoras</a> and <a href="Anaxarchus">Anaxarchus</a>, historian and philosopher <a href="Hecataeus%20of%20Abdera">Hecataeus of Abdera</a>, and the lyric poet <a href="Anacreon">Anacreon</a>.

Abdera had flourished especially in ancient times mainly for two reasons: because of the large area of their territory and their highly strategic position. The city controlled two great road passages (one of Nestos river and other through the mountains north of Xanthi). Furthermore, from their ports passed the sea road, which from Troas led to the Thracian and then the Macedonian coast.

The ruins of the town may still be seen on Cape Balastra (40°56'1.02"N 24°58'21.81"E); they cover seven small hills, and extend from an eastern to a western harbor; on the southwestern hills are the remains of the medieval settlement of Polystylon.

The municipality Abdera was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of three former municipalities that became municipal units: Abdera, <a href="Selero">Selero</a>, and <a href="Vistonida">Vistonida</a>.

The municipality has an area of 352.047 km, the municipal unit 161.958 km. The municipal unit Abdera is subdivided into the communities Abdera, <a href="Mandra%2C%20Xanthi">Mandra</a>, <a href="Myrodato">Myrodato</a> and <a href="Nea%20Kessani">Nea Kessani</a>. The community Abdera consists of the settlements Abdera, <a href="Giona%2C%20Xanthi">Giona</a>, Lefkippos, <a href="Pezoula">Pezoula</a> and Skala.

Landmarks of Abdera include the <a href="Archaeological%20Museum%20of%20Abdera">Archaeological Museum of Abdera</a>, and <a href="Agios%20Ioannis%20Beach">Agios Ioannis Beach</a> (also "Paralia Avdiron") near the village Lefkippos.

Apollos

Apollos () was a <a href="Christianity%20in%20the%201st%20century">1st century</a> <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>n <a href="Jewish%20Christian">Jewish Christian</a> mentioned several times in the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>. A contemporary and co-worker of <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul the Apostle</a>, he played an important role in the early development of the churches of <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Corinth%23Biblical%20Corinth">Corinth</a>.

Apollos is first mentioned as a Christian preacher who had come to Ephesus (probably in the year 52 or 53), where he is described as "being fervent in spirit: he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>, though he knew only the baptism of <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John</a>" (). <a href="Priscilla%20and%20Aquila">Priscilla and Aquila</a>, a Jewish Christian couple who had come to Ephesus with the <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Apostle Paul</a>, instructed Apollos:

The differences between the two understandings probably related to <a href="baptism%20with%20the%20Holy%20Spirit">baptism with the Holy Spirit</a>, since Apollos "knew only the baptism of John". Later, during Apollos' absence, the writer of the <a href="Acts%20of%20the%20Apostles">Acts of the Apostles</a> recounts an encounter between Paul and some disciples at Ephesus:
Before Paul's arrival, Apollos had moved from Ephesus to <a href="Achaia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Achaia</a> and was living in <a href="Corinth">Corinth</a>, the provincial capital of Achaia. Acts reports that Apollos arrived in Achaia with a <a href="Epistle%20to%20Corinth">letter of recommendation</a> from the Ephesian Christians and "greatly helped those who through grace had believed, for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing by the <a href="Old%20Testament">Scriptures</a> that the Christ was Jesus ().

Paul's <a href="First%20Epistle%20to%20the%20Corinthians">First Epistle to the Corinthians</a> (55 AD) mentions Apollos as an important figure at Corinth. Paul describes Apollos' role at Corinth:
Paul's Epistle refers to a <a href="Schism%20%28religion%29">schism</a> between four parties in the Corinthian church, of which two attached themselves to Paul and Apollos respectively, using their names (the third and fourth were Peter, identified as Cephas, and Jesus Christ himself). It is possible, though, that, as Msgr. <a href="Ronald%20Knox">Ronald Knox</a> suggests, the parties were actually two, one claiming to follow Paul, the other claiming to follow Apollos. "It is surely probable that the adherents of St. Paul [...] alleged in defence of his orthodoxy the fact that he was in full agreement with, and in some sense commissioned by, the Apostolic College. Hence 'I am for Cephas'. [...] What reply was the faction of Apollos to make? It devised an expedient which has been imitated by sectaries more than once in later times; appealed behind the Apostolic College itself to him from whom the Apostolic College derived its dignity; 'I am for Christ.'" Paul states that the schism arose because of the Corinthians' immaturity in faith (). 

Apollos was a devout Jew born in Alexandria. <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> says that the name "Apollos" was probably short for Apollonius or Apollodorus. Apollos' origin in Alexandria has led to speculations that he would have preached in the allegorical style of <a href="Philo">Philo</a>. Theologian <a href="Jerome%20Murphy-O%27Connor">Jerome Murphy-O'Connor</a>, for example, commented: "It is difficult to imagine that an Alexandrian Jew ... could have escaped the influence of Philo, the great intellectual leader ... particularly since the latter seems to have been especially concerned with education and preaching." <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI">Pope Benedict</a> suggest there were those in Corinth "...fascinated by his way of speaking..."

There is no indication that Apollos favored or approved an overestimation of his person. Paul urged him to go to Corinth at the time, but Apollos refused, stating that he would come later when he had an opportunity.

Apollos is mentioned one more time in the New Testament. In the <a href="Epistle%20to%20Titus">Epistle to Titus</a>, the recipient is exhorted to "speed <a href="Zenas%20the%20Lawyer">Zenas the lawyer</a> and Apollos on their way".

<a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> states that Apollos was so dissatisfied with the division at Corinth that he retired to <a href="Crete">Crete</a> with Zenas; and that once the schism had been healed by Paul's letters to the Corinthians, Apollos returned to the city and became one of its elders. Less probable traditions assign to him the bishop of Duras, or of Iconium in Phrygia, or of Caesarea.

<a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> and some modern scholars have proposed Apollos as the author of the <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Hebrews">Epistle to the Hebrews</a>, rather than <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul</a> or <a href="Barnabas">Barnabas</a>. Both Apollos and Barnabas were Jewish Christians with sufficient intellectual authority. The <a href="Pulpit%20Commentary">Pulpit Commentary</a> treats Apollos' authorship of Hebrews as "generally believed". Other than this, there are no known surviving texts attributed to Apollos.

Apollos is regarded as a saint by several Christian churches, including the <a href="Lutheran%20Church%E2%80%93Missouri%20Synod">Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod</a>, which hold a commemoration for him, together with saints <a href="Aquila%20and%20Priscilla">Aquila and Priscilla</a>, on 13 February.

Acquis communautaire

The Community acquis or acquis communautaire (; ), sometimes called the EU acquis and often shortened to acquis, is the accumulated legislation, legal acts, and court decisions which constitute the body of <a href="European%20Union%20law">European Union law</a>. The term is French: "acquis" meaning "that which has been acquired or obtained", and "communautaire" meaning "of the community".

During the process of the <a href="enlargement%20of%20the%20European%20Union">enlargement of the European Union</a>, the acquis was divided into 31 chapters for the purpose of negotiation between the EU and the candidate member states for the fifth enlargement (the ten that joined in 2004 plus <a href="Romania">Romania</a> and <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> which joined in 2007).

Correspondence between chapters of the 5th and the 6th Enlargement:

Such negotiations usually involved agreeing transitional periods before new member states needed to implement the laws of the European Union fully and before they and their citizens acquired full rights under the "acquis".

The term "acquis" is also used to describe laws adopted under the <a href="Schengen%20Agreement">Schengen Agreement</a>, prior to its integration into the European Union legal order by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Amsterdam">Treaty of Amsterdam</a>, in which case one speaks of the "Schengen acquis".

The term "acquis" has been borrowed by the <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a> Appellate Body, in the case "Japan – Taxes on Alcoholic Beverages", to refer to the accumulation of <a href="General%20Agreement%20on%20Tariffs%20and%20Trade">General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</a> (GATT) and WTO law (""acquis gattien""), though this usage is not well established.

It has been used to describe the achievements of the <a href="Council%20of%20Europe">Council of Europe</a> (an international organisation unconnected with the European Union):

It has also been applied to the body of "principles, norms and commitments" of the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE):

Antacid

An antacid is a substance which <a href="neutralization%20%28chemistry%29">neutralizes</a> <a href="gastric%20acid">stomach acidity</a>, used to relieve <a href="heartburn">heartburn</a>, <a href="indigestion">indigestion</a> or an upset stomach.

Antacids are available <a href="over%20the%20counter">over the counter</a> and are taken by mouth to quickly relieve occasional <a href="heartburn">heartburn</a>, the major symptom of <a href="gastroesophageal%20reflux%20disease">gastroesophageal reflux disease</a> and also <a href="indigestion">indigestion</a>. Treatment with antacids alone is <a href="Symptomatic%20treatment">symptomatic</a> and only justified for minor symptoms.

Antacids are distinct from acid-reducing drugs like <a href="H2%20antagonist">H-receptor antagonist</a>s or <a href="proton%20pump%20inhibitor">proton pump inhibitor</a>s and they do not kill the bacteria "<a href="Helicobacter%20pylori">Helicobacter pylori</a>", which causes most <a href="gastric%20ulcer">ulcers</a>. 

Versions with magnesium may cause diarrhoea, and brands with calcium or aluminium may cause constipation and rarely, long-term use may cause kidney stones. Long-term use of versions with aluminium may increase the risk for getting <a href="osteoporosis">osteoporosis</a>.

When excessive amounts of acids are produced in the stomach the natural mucous barrier that protects the lining of the stomach can damage the esophagus in people with <a href="Gastroesophageal%20reflux%20disease">acid reflux</a>. Antacids contain <a href="alkaline">alkaline</a> ions that <a href="Neutralization%20%28chemistry%29">chemically neutralize</a> stomach <a href="gastric%20acid">gastric acid</a>, reducing damage and relieving pain.

Antacids may be formulated with other <a href="active%20pharmaceutical%20ingredient">active ingredients</a> such as <a href="simethicone">simethicone</a> to control <a href="Flatulence">gas</a> or <a href="alginic%20acid">alginic acid</a> to act as a physical barrier to acid.

Effervescent tablets are tablets which are designed to dissolve in water, and release <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. The common ingredients are <a href="citric%20acid">citric acid</a> and <a href="sodium%20bicarbonate">sodium bicarbonate</a>, which react when in contact with water to produce carbon dioxide. Effervescent antacids may also contain <a href="aspirin">aspirin</a>, <a href="sodium%20carbonate">sodium carbonate</a>, or <a href="tartaric%20acid">tartaric acid</a>

Well known brands are <a href="Alka-Seltzer">Alka-Seltzer</a> in the United States, and <a href="Eno%20%28drug%29">Eno</a> in the United Kingdom.

Under the generic name algeldrate, <a href="aluminium%20hydroxide">aluminium hydroxide</a> is used as an antacid. Aluminium hydroxide is preferred over other alternatives such as <a href="sodium%20bicarbonate">sodium bicarbonate</a> because Al(OH), being insoluble, does not increase the pH of stomach above 7 and hence, does not trigger secretion of excess <a href="stomach%20acid">stomach acid</a>. Brand names include Alu-Cap, Aludrox, Gaviscon, and Pepsamar. In 2016 Gaviscon was one of the biggest selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of £62 million. It reacts with excess acid in the stomach, reducing the acidity of the stomach content, which may relieve the symptoms of ulcers, heartburn or dyspepsia. Such products can cause <a href="constipation">constipation</a>, because the aluminum ions inhibit the contractions of <a href="smooth%20muscle%20cells">smooth muscle cells</a> in the gastrointestinal tract, slowing <a href="peristalsis">peristalsis</a> and lengthening the time needed for stool to pass through the colon.

Áed mac Cináeda

Áed mac Cináeda (died 878) was a son of <a href="Cin%C3%A1ed%20mac%20Ailp%C3%ADn">Cináed mac Ailpín</a>. He became king of the <a href="Picts">Picts</a> in 877, when he succeeded his brother <a href="Constant%C3%ADn%20mac%20Cin%C3%A1eda">Constantín mac Cináeda</a>. He was nicknamed Áed of the White Flowers, the wing-footed () or the white-foot ().

The "<a href="Chronicle%20of%20the%20Kings%20of%20Alba">Chronicle of the Kings of Alba</a>" says of Áed: "Edus [Áed] held the same [i.e. the kingdom] for one year. The shortness of his reign has bequeathed nothing memorable to history. He was slain in the civitas of Nrurim." Nrurim is unidentified.

The <a href="Annals%20of%20Ulster">Annals of Ulster</a> say that in 878: "Áed mac Cináeda, king of the Picts, was killed by his associates." Tradition, reported by <a href="George%20Chalmers%20%28antiquarian%29">George Chalmers</a> in his "Caledonia" (1807), and by the <a href="Statistical%20Accounts%20of%20Scotland">New Statistical Account</a> (1834–1845), has it that the early-historic mound of the Cunninghillock by <a href="Inverurie">Inverurie</a> is the burial place of Áed. This is based on reading Nrurim as "Inruriu".

A longer account is interpolated in <a href="Andrew%20of%20Wyntoun">Andrew of Wyntoun</a>'s "Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland". This says that Áed reigned one year and was killed by his successor <a href="Giric">Giric</a> in <a href="Strathallan">Strathallan</a> and other king lists have the same report.

It is uncertain which, if any, of the "<a href="Prophecy%20of%20Berch%C3%A1n">Prophecy of Berchán</a>"'s kings should be taken to be Áed. <a href="William%20Forbes%20Skene">William Forbes Skene</a> presumed that the following verses referred to Áed:129. Another king will take [sovereignty]; small is the profit that he does not divide. Alas for Scotland thenceforward. His name will be the Furious.<br>130. He will be but a short time over Scotland. The will be no [word uncertain] unplundered. Alas for Scotland, through the youth; alas for their books, alas for their bequests.<br>131. He will be nine years in the kingdom. I shall tell you—it will be a tale of truth—he dies without bell, with communion, at evening, in a fatal pass.

Áed's son, <a href="Constant%C3%ADn%20mac%20%C3%81eda">Constantín mac Áeda</a>, became king in 900.

Abdul Hamid I

Abdülhamid I, Abdul Hamid I or Abd Al-Hamid I (, "`Abdü’l-Ḥamīd-i evvel"; ; 20 March 1725 – 7 April 1789) was the 27th <a href="Sultan%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">Sultan of the Ottoman Empire</a>, reigning over the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> from 1773 to 1789.

He was born in Constantinople, a younger son of Sultan <a href="Ahmed%20III">Ahmed III</a> (reigned 1703–1730) and his consort <a href="%C5%9Eermi%20Kad%C4%B1n">Şermi Kadın</a>. Ahmed III abdicated in favor of his nephew <a href="Mahmud%20I">Mahmud I</a>, who was succeeded by his brother <a href="Osman%20III">Osman III</a>, and Osman by Ahmed's elder son <a href="Mustafa%20III">Mustafa III</a>. As a potential heir to the throne, Abdül Hamid was imprisoned in comfort by his cousins and older brother, as was customary. This lasted until 1767. During this period, he received his early education from his mother Rabia Şermi, who taught him history and <a href="calligraphy">calligraphy</a>.

When his brother Mustafa III died, Abdül Hamid succeeded him on 21 January 1774.

Abdül Hamid's long imprisonment had left him indifferent to state affairs and malleable to the designs of his advisors. Yet he was also very religious and a <a href="pacifism">pacifist</a> by nature. At his accession the financial straits of the treasury were such that the usual donative could not be given to the <a href="Janissary">Janissary</a> Corps. The new Sultan told the Janissaries "There are no longer gratuities in our treasury, as all of our soldier sons should learn."

Despite his pacific inclinations, the Ottoman Empire was forced to renew <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281768%E2%80%9374%29">the ongoing war</a> with <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a> almost immediately. This led to <a href="Battle%20of%20Kozludzha">complete Turkish defeat at Kozludzha</a> and the humiliating <a href="Treaty%20of%20K%C3%BC%C3%A7%C3%BCk%20Kaynarca">Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca</a>, signed on 21 July 1774. The Ottomans ceded territory to Russia, and also the right to intervene on behalf of the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox Christian</a>s in the Empire.

Abdülhamid now sought to reform the Empire's armed forces. He enumerated the Janissary corps and tried to renovate it, and also the navy. He established a new artillery corps. He was also credited with the creation of the Imperial Naval Engineering School.

Abdülhamid tried to strengthen Ottoman rule over <a href="Ottoman%20Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="Eyalet%20of%20Egypt">Egypt</a>, and <a href="Ottoman%20Iraq">Iraq</a>. However, slight successes against rebellions in Syria and the <a href="Morea">Morea</a> could not compensate for the loss of the <a href="Crimean%20Peninsula">Crimean Peninsula</a>, which had become nominally independent in 1774, but was in practice now controlled by Russia.

Russia repeatedly exploited its position as protector of Eastern Christians to interfere in the Ottoman Empire, and explicitly. Finally the Ottomans declared <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281787%E2%80%9392%29">war against Russia in 1787</a>. <a href="Austro-Turkish%20War%20%281787%E2%80%9391%29">Austria soon joined Russia</a>. Turkey held its own in the conflict, at first, but on 6 December 1788, <a href="Siege%20of%20Ochakov%20%281788%29">Ochakov fell to Russia</a> (all of its inhabitants being massacred). It is said that this sad defeat broke Abdül Hamid's spirit, as he died four months later.

In spite of his failures, Abdülhamid was regarded as the most gracious Ottoman Sultan. He personally directed the <a href="fire%20brigade">fire brigade</a> during the Constantinople fire of 1782. He was admired by the people for his religious devotion, and was even called a "Veli" ("saint"). He also outlined a reform policy, supervised the government closely, and worked with statesmen.

In 1789, <a href="Tipu%20Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a>, ruler of the <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Mysore">Sultanate of Mysore</a> sent an embassy to Abdülhamid, urgently requesting assistance against the <a href="British%20East%20India%20Company">British East India Company</a>, and proposed an offensive and defensive alliance. Abdul Hamid informed the Mysori ambassadors that the Ottomans were still entangled and exhausted from the ongoing war with Russia and Austria.

Abdülhamid died on 7 April 1789, at the age of sixty-four, in Constantinople. He was buried in Bahcekapi, a tomb he had built for himself.

He bred <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian horse</a>s with great passion. One breed of Küheylan Arabians was named "Küheylan Abdülhamid" after him.

Abdul Hamid had nine wives:

Abdur Rahman Khan () (between 1840 and 1844October 1, 1901) was <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Afghanistan">Emir of Afghanistan</a> from 1880 to 1901.

He was the third son of <a href="Mohammad%20Afzal%20Khan">Mohammad Afzal Khan</a>, and grandson of <a href="Dost%20Mohammad%20Khan">Dost Mohammad Khan</a>.

He became known as "The Iron Amir" because his government was a military despotism resting upon a well-appointed army administered through officials absolutely subservient to an inflexible will and controlled by a widespread system of <a href="espionage">espionage</a>; and for his <a href="1888-1893%20Uprisings%20of%20Hazaras">crushing of a number of rebellions</a> by various tribes who were led by his relatives one of which resulted in the killing and displacement of 60% of the <a href="Hazara%20people">Hazara people</a>'s population.

Described by the American scholar and explorer <a href="Eugene%20Schuyler">Eugene Schuyler</a> as "a tall well-built man, with a large head, and a marked Afghan, almost <a href="Jewish%20people">Jewish</a>, face", Abdur Rahman distinguished himself for his ability and energetic daring. Although his father, Afzal Khan, who had none of these qualities, came to terms with the Amir Sher Ali, the son's behaviour in the northern province soon excited the Amir's suspicion, and Abdur Rahman, when he was summoned to Kabul, fled across the <a href="Oxus">Oxus</a> into <a href="Bukhara">Bukhara</a>. Sher Ali threw Afzal Khan into prison, and a serious revolt followed in southern Afghanistan.

The Amir had scarcely suppressed it by winning a desperate battle when Abdur Rahman's reappearance in the north was a signal for a mutiny by troops stationed in those parts and a gathering of armed bands to his standard. After some delay and desultory fighting, he and his uncle, Azam Khan, occupied Kabul in March 1866. The Amir Sher Ali marched up against them from <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a>; but in the battle that ensued at Sheikhabad on May 10, he was deserted by a large body of his troops, and after his signal defeat Abdur Rahman released his father, Afzul Khan, from prison in <a href="Ghazni">Ghazni</a>, and installed him upon the throne as Amir of Afghanistan. Notwithstanding the new Amir's incapacity, and some jealousy between the real leaders, Abdur Rahman and his uncle, they again routed Sher Ali's forces, and occupied Kandahar in 1867. When Afzal Khan died at the end of the year, Azam Khan became the new ruler, with Abdur Rahman installed as Governor in the northern province. But towards the end of 1868 Sher Ali's return, and a general rising in his favour, resulted in Abdur Rahman and Azam Khan's defeat at "Tinah Khan" on January 3, 1869. Both sought refuge to the east in Central Asia, whence Abdur Rahman placed himself under Russian protection at <a href="Samarkand">Samarkand</a>. Azam died eventually in Kabul in October 1869.

Abdur Rahman lived in exile in <a href="Tashkent">Tashkent</a>. The <a href="Governor-General">governor-general</a> of <a href="Tashkent">Tashkent</a> sent for Abdur Rahman and <a href="motivated">motivated</a> him by bringing up the <a href="blessing%20of%20Jacob">blessing of Jacob</a>, Abdur's <a href="patriarch">patriarch</a>. He was being told to cross the <a href="Oxus">Oxus</a> and claim <a href="throne">throne</a> for <a href="Amir">Amir</a>. In March 1880, a report reached India that Abdur Rahman was in northern Afghanistan; and the Governor-General, <a href="Robert%20Bulwer-Lytton%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Lytton">Lord Lytton</a>, opened communications with him to the effect that the <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Government">British government</a> were prepared to withdraw their troops, and to recognize Abdur Rahman as Amir of Afghanistan, with the exception of Kandahar and some districts adjacent to it. After some negotiations, and an interview with <a href="Lepel%20Griffin">Lepel Griffin</a>, the diplomatic representative at Kabul of the Indian government. Griffin described Abdur Rahman as a man of middle height, with an exceedingly intelligent face and frank and courteous manners, shrewd and able in conversation on the business in hand.

At the "<a href="Durbar%20%28court%29">durbar</a>" on July 22, 1880, Abdur Rahman was officially recognized as Amir, granted assistance in arms and money, and promised, in case of unprovoked foreign aggression, such further aid as might be necessary to repel it, provided that he align his foreign policy with the British. The British evacuation of Afghanistan was settled on the terms proposed, and in 1881, the <a href="British%20Army">British troops</a> also handed over Kandahar to the new "Amir".

However, <a href="Mohammad%20Ayub%20Khan%20%28Emir%20of%20Afghanistan%29">Ayub Khan</a>, one of Sher Ali Khan's sons, marched upon that city from Herat, defeated Abdur Rahman's troops, and occupied the place in July 1880. This serious reverse roused the "Amir", who had not at first displayed much activity. He led a force from Kabul, met Ayub's army close to Kandahar, and the complete victory which he there won forced Ayub Khan to flee into Persia. From that time Abdur Rahman was fairly seated on the throne at Kabul, and in the course of the next few years he consolidated his dominion over all Afghanistan, suppressing <a href="insurrection">insurrection</a>s by a sharp and relentless use of his <a href="Despotism">despotic</a> authority. The powerful <a href="Ghilzai">Ghilzai</a> tribe revolted against the severity of his measures several times. In that same year, Ayub Khan made a fruitless inroad from Persia.

In 1885, at the moment when the "Amir" was in conference with the British <a href="viceroy">viceroy</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Dufferin%20and%20Ava">Lord Dufferin</a>, in India, the news came of a skirmish between Russian and Afghan troops at <a href="Panjdeh">Panjdeh</a>, over a disputed point in the demarcation of the northwestern frontier of Afghanistan. Abdur Rahman's attitude at this critical juncture is a good example of his political sagacity. To one who had been a man of war from his youth, who had won and lost many fights, the rout of a detachment and the forcible seizure of some debatable frontier lands was an untoward incident; but it was not a <a href="Principle%20of%20sufficient%20reason">sufficient reason</a> for calling upon the British, although they had guaranteed his territory's integrity, to vindicate his rights by hostilities which would certainly bring upon him a Russian invasion from the north, and would compel his British allies to throw an army into Afghanistan from the southeast. He also published his <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a> in 1885, which served more as an advice guide for <a href="prince">prince</a>s than anything else.

His interest lay in keeping powerful neighbours, whether friends or foes, outside his kingdom. He knew this to be the only policy that would be supported by the Afghan nation; and although for some time a rupture with Russia seemed imminent, while the <a href="India%20Office">Government of India</a> made ready for that contingency, the Amir's reserved and circumspect tone in the consultations with him helped to turn the balance between peace and war, and substantially conduced towards a pacific solution. Abdur Rahman left on those who met him in India the impression of a clear-headed man of action, with great self-reliance and hardihood, not without indications of the implacable severity that too often marked his administration. His investment with the insignia of the highest grade of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Star%20of%20India">Order of the Star of India</a> appeared to give him much pleasure.

His adventurous life, his forcible character, the position of his state as a barrier between the Indian and the Russian empires, and the skill with which he held the balance in dealing with them, combined to make him a prominent figure in contemporary Asian politics and will mark his reign as an epoch in the history of Afghanistan. The Amir received an annual <a href="subsidy">subsidy</a> from the British government of 1,850,000 <a href="rupee">rupee</a>s. He was allowed to import munitions of war. He succeeded in imposing an organized government upon the fiercest and most unruly population in <a href="Asia">Asia</a>; he availed himself of <a href="Europe">Europe</a>an inventions for strengthening his armament, while he sternly set his face against all innovations which, like <a href="railway">railway</a>s and <a href="Telegraphy">telegraph</a>s, might give Europeans a foothold within his country.

The Amir found himself unable, by reason of <a href="Illness">ill-health</a>, to accept an invitation from <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> to visit England; but his second son <a href="Nasrullah%20Khan%20%28Afghanistan%29">Nasrullah Khan</a> went instead. 

In 1893, Mortimer Durand was deputed to Kabul by the government of British India for this purpose of settling an exchange of territory required by the demarcation of the boundary between northeastern Afghanistan and the Russian possessions, and in order to discuss with Amir Abdur Rahman Khan other pending questions. Abdur Rahman Khan showed his usual ability in diplomatic argument, his tenacity where his own views or claims were in debate, with a sure underlying insight into the real situation.

In the agreement that followed relations between the British Indian and Afghan governments, as previously arranged, were confirmed; and an understanding was reached upon the important and difficult subject of the border line of Afghanistan on the east, towards India. A Royal Commission was set up to determine the boundary between Afghanistan and British Governed India was rasked to negotiate terms for agreeing to the Durand line, between the two parties camped at <a href="Parachinar">Parachinar</a>, now part of FATA Pakistan, which is near <a href="Khost">Khost</a>, Afghanistan. From the British side the camp was attended by Mortimer Durand and <a href="Sahibzada%20Abdul%20Qayyum">Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum</a>, <a href="Political%20Agent">Political Agent</a> Khyber. Afghanistan was represented by <a href="Sahibzada%20Abdul%20Latif">Sahibzada Abdul Latif</a> and the Governor <a href="Sardar%20Shireendil%20Khan">Sardar Shireendil Khan</a> representing Amir Abdur Rahman Khan.In 1893, <a href="Mortimer%20Durand">Mortimer Durand</a> negotiated with Abdur Rahman Khan the "<a href="Durand%20Line">Durand Line</a> Treaty" for the demarcation of the frontier between Afghanistan, the <a href="FATA">FATA</a>, <a href="Khyber%20Pakhtunkhwa">North-West Frontier Province</a> and <a href="Balochistan%20%28Pakistan%29">Baluchistan</a> Provinces of Pakistan the successor state of <a href="British%20India">British India</a>. The <a href="Durand%20Line">Durand Line</a> still remains as an unrecognized boundary by the Government of Afghanistan. 

Abdur Rahman Khan's government was a military despotism resting upon a well-appointed army; it was administered through officials absolutely subservient to an inflexible will and controlled by a widespread system of <a href="espionage">espionage</a>; while the exercise of his personal authority was too often stained by acts of unnecessary cruelty. He held open courts for the receipt of petitioners and the dispensation of justice; and in the disposal of business he was indefatigable. 

In the 1880s, the "Iron Emir" decided to strategically displace some members of different ethnic groups in order to bring better security. For example, he "uprooted troublesome Durrani and Ghilzai [Pashtun] tribes and transported them to <a href="Uzbeks">Uzbek</a> and <a href="Tajiks">Tajik</a> populated areas in the north]], where they could spy on local Dari-speaking, non-Pashtun ethnic groups and act as a screen against further Russian encroachments on Afghan territory." From the end of 1888, the Amir spent eighteen months in his northern provinces bordering upon the Oxus, where he was engaged in pacifying the country that had been disturbed by revolts, and in punishing with a heavy hand all who were known or suspected to have taken any part in rebellion.

In 1895–1896, Abdur Rahman directed the invasion of <a href="Kafiristan">Kafiristan</a> and the conversion of its indigenous peoples to Islam. The region was subsequently renamed <a href="Nuristan%20Province">Nuristan</a>. In 1896, he adopted the title of "Zia-ul-Millat-Wa-ud Din" ("Light of the nation and religion"), and his zeal for the cause of <a href="Islam">Islam</a> induced him to publish <a href="treatises">treatises</a> on "<a href="jihad">jihad</a>". 

Chitral, Yarkand and Ferghana became shelters for refugees in 1887 and 1883 from Badakhshan who fled from the campaigns of Abdul Rahman.

In the late 1880s some Hazara tribes revolted against Abdur Rahman in favor of <a href="Sher%20Ali%20Khan">Sher Ali Khan</a>. In 1888, for example the Amir's cousin, Ishak Khan, rebelled against him in the north; but these two enterprises came to nothing. According to <a href="Syed%20Askar%20Mousavi">Syed Askar Mousavi</a>, "thousands of Hazara men, women, and children were sold as slaves in the markets of Kabul and Qandahar, while numerous towers of human heads were made from the defeated rebels as a warning to others who might challenge the rule of the Amir." During this period some Hazaras migrated to <a href="Quetta">Quetta</a> in <a href="Balochistan%20%28Pakistan%29">Balochistan</a>, while smaller number moved to <a href="Mashhed">Mashhed</a> in northeastern Iran. The crackdown resulted in the killing and displacement of 60% of the <a href="Hazara">Hazara</a> population. 

Abdur Rahman died on October 1, 1901, being succeeded by his son <a href="Habibullah%20Khan">Habibullah Khan</a>. He had defeated all enterprises by rivals against his throne; he had broken down the power of local chiefs, and tamed the refractory tribes; so that his orders were irresistible throughout the whole dominion.

Today, his descendants can be found in many places outside Afghanistan, such as in America, <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, and even in Scandinavian countries such as <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>. His two eldest sons, Habibullah Khan and <a href="Nasrullah%20Khan%20%28Afghanistan%29">Nasrullah Khan</a>, were born at <a href="Samarkand">Samarkand</a>. His youngest son, Mahomed Omar Jan, was born in 1889 of an Afghan mother, connected by descent with the <a href="Barakzai">Barakzai</a> family.

Afghan society has mixed feelings about his rule. Some remember him as a ruler who initiated many programs for modernization and effectively prevented the country from being occupied by Russia and Britain during <a href="the%20Great%20Game">the Great Game</a>. On the other hand, some sectors of Afghanistan remember him as a domestically violent and geopolitically weak ruler in that he was brought to power by the British and declared war on Afghan minorities instead of fighting the British who were deciding Afghanistan's foreign policy for him.

Abencerrages

The Abencerrages (from the Arabic for "Saddler's Son") were a family or faction that is said to have held a prominent position in the <a href="Emirate%20of%20Granada">Kingdom of Granada</a> in the 15th century.

The name appears to have been derived from Yussuf ben-Serragh, the head of the tribe in the time of <a href="Muhammed%20VII%2C%20Sultan%20of%20Granada">Muhammed VII, Sultan of Granada</a> (1370–1408), who did that sovereign good service in his struggles to retain the crown of which he was three times deprived.

Little is known of the family with certainty. The <a href="Chambers%20Biographical%20Dictionary">Chambers Biographical Dictionary</a> records that they arrived in Spain in the 8th century but the name is familiar from the romance by <a href="Gin%C3%A9s%20P%C3%A9rez%20de%20Hita">Ginés Pérez de Hita</a>, "Guerras civiles de Granada", which celebrates the feuds of the Abencerrages and the rival family of the Zegris, and the cruel treatment to which the former were subjected. <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Claris%20de%20Florian">J. P. de Florian</a>'s "Gonsalve de Cordoue" and <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</a>'s "Le dernier des Abencerrages" are imitations of Pérez de Hita's work.

The story is told that one of the Abencerrages, having fallen in love with a lady of the royal family, was caught in the act of climbing up to her window. The king, enraged, shut up the whole family in one of the halls of the <a href="Alhambra">Alhambra</a>, and ordered the Zegris to kill them all. The apartment where this is said to have taken place is one of the most beautiful courts of the Alhambra, and is still called the Hall of the Abencerrages.

Many poems and plays, and two operas ("<a href="Les%20Abenc%C3%A9rages">Les Abencérages</a>", by <a href="Luigi%20Cherubini">Luigi Cherubini</a>, and "<a href="L%27esule%20di%20Granata">L'esule di Granata</a>", by <a href="Giacomo%20Meyerbeer">Giacomo Meyerbeer</a>) mention the legend.

Aberdare

Aberdare ( ; ) is a town in the <a href="Cynon%20Valley">Cynon Valley</a> area of <a href="Rhondda%20Cynon%20Taf">Rhondda Cynon Taf</a>, <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, at the <a href="confluence">confluence</a> of the Rivers Dare (Dâr) and <a href="River%20Cynon">Cynon</a>. The population at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202001">2001 census</a> was 31,705 (ranked 13th largest in Wales). Aberdare is south-west of <a href="Merthyr%20Tydfil">Merthyr Tydfil</a>, north-west of <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> and east-north-east of <a href="Swansea">Swansea</a>. During the 19th century it became a thriving industrial settlement, which was also notable for the vitality of its cultural life and as an important publishing centre.

Aberdare dates from the Middle Ages. It was originally a small village in an agricultural district, centred around the <a href="St%20John%27s%20Church%2C%20Aberdare">Church of St John the Baptist</a>, said to date from 1189. By the middle of the 15th century, Aberdare contained a water mill in addition to a number of thatched cottages, of which no evidence remains. In the early 19th century the population grew rapidly, owing to the abundance of coal and iron ore,: the population of the whole parish, 1,486 in 1801, increased tenfold during the first half of the 19th century.

Two major industries supported the growth of the community: first iron, then coal. A branch of the <a href="Glamorganshire%20Canal">Glamorganshire Canal</a> (1811) was used to transport these products; then the railway became the main means of transport to the South Wales coast. From the 1870s onwards, the economy of the town was dominated by the coal mining industry, with only a small <a href="tinplate">tinplate</a> works. There were also several brickworks and breweries. During the latter half of the 19th century, considerable improvements were made to the town, which became a pleasant place to live, despite the nearby collieries. A postgraduate theological college opened in connection with the Church of England in 1892, but in 1907 it moved to <a href="Llandaff">Llandaff</a>.

With the ecclesiastical parishes of St Fagan's (Trecynon) and Aberaman carved out of the ancient parish, Aberdare had 12 <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> churches and one <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic church</a>, built in 1866 in Monk Street near the site of a cell attached to <a href="Penrhys%23Medieval%20monastery">Penrhys monastery</a>; and at one time there were over 50 <a href="Nonconformist">Nonconformist</a> chapels (including those in surrounding settlements such as <a href="Cwmaman">Cwmaman</a> and <a href="Llwydcoed">Llwydcoed</a>). The services in the majority of the chapels were in <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a>. Most of these chapels have now closed, with many converted to other uses. The urban district includes what were once the separate villages of <a href="Aberaman">Aberaman</a>, <a href="Abernant%2C%20Rhondda%20Cynon%20Taf">Abernant</a>, <a href="Cwmaman">Cwmaman</a>, <a href="Cwmbach">Cwmbach</a>, <a href="Cwmdare">Cwmdare</a>, <a href="Llwydcoed">Llwydcoed</a>, <a href="Penywaun">Penywaun</a> and <a href="Trecynon">Trecynon</a>. There are several <a href="cairn">cairn</a>s and the remains of a circular <a href="Brython">British</a> encampment on the mountain between Aberdare and <a href="Merthyr">Merthyr</a>. <a href="Hirwaun">Hirwaun</a> moor, 4 miles to the north west of Aberdare, was according to tradition the scene of a battle at which <a href="Rhys%20ap%20Tewdwr">Rhys ap Tewdwr</a>, prince of <a href="Dyfed">Dyfed</a>, was defeated by the allied forces of the <a href="Normans">Norman</a> <a href="Robert%20Fitzhamon">Robert Fitzhamon</a> and <a href="Iestyn%20ap%20Gwrgant">Iestyn ap Gwrgant</a>, the last Welsh prince of <a href="Glamorgan">Glamorgan</a>.

The parish population was 1,486 in 1801, but expanded fast, especially during the 1840s and 1850s: the population of the Aberdare District, centred on the town, was 9,322 in 1841; 18,774 in 1851; and 37,487 in 1861. This population growth, a result of the growth of the <a href="steam%20coal">steam coal</a> trade (see below) was increasingly concentrated in the previously agricultural areas of Blaengwawr and Cefnpennar to the south of the town. Many of the migrants came from the rural parts of west Wales which had been affected by an agricultural depression. Population levels continued to increase over the next forty years, albeit with a small decline in the 1870s. The first decade of the 20th century saw a further sharp increase, largely as a result of the steam coal trade, reaching 53,779 in 1911. The population has since declined owing to the loss of most of the heavy industry.

Welsh was the prominent language until the mid 20th century and Aberdare was an important centre of Welsh language publishing. A large proportion of the early migrant population were Welsh speaking, and in 1851 only ten per cent of the population had been born outside of Wales.

In his controversial evidence to the <a href="Treason%20of%20the%20Blue%20Books">1847 Education Reports</a> (known in Wales as the "Brad y Llyfrau Gleision" or "Treachery of the Blue Books"), the Anglican vicar of Aberdare, <a href="John%20Griffith%20%28Anglican%20priest%29">John Griffith</a>, stated that the English language was "generally understood" and referred to the arrival of people from anglicised areas such as Radnorshire and south Pembrokeshire. Griffith also made allegations about the Welsh speaking population and what he considered to be the degraded character of the women of Aberdare, alleging sexual promiscuity was an accepted social convention, that drunkenness and improvidence amongst the miners was common and attacking what he saw as exaggerated emotion in the religious practices of the Nonconformists.
This evidence helped inform the findings of the report which would go on to stigmatise Welsh people as "ignorant", "lazy" and "immoral" and found the reason for this was the continued use of the Welsh language, which it described as "evil". The controversial reports allowed the local non-conformist minister <a href="Thomas%20Price%20%28Baptist%20minister%29">Thomas Price</a> of <a href="Calfaria%2C%20Aberdare">Capel Calfaria</a> to arrange public debates, from which he would emerge as a leading defender of the Welsh language and by extension, the local population, Rev. Griffiths meanwhile, was made vicar of <a href="Merthyr%20Tydfil">Merthyr</a> in order to escape local anger. The reports and subsequent defence would maintain the perceptions of Aberdare, the <a href="Cynon%20Valley">Cynon Valley</a> and even the <a href="South%20Wales%20Valleys">wider area</a> as proudly Non Conformist and defiantly Welsh speaking throughout its industrialised history.

By 1901, the census recorded that 71.5% of the population of Aberdare Urban District spoke Welsh, but this fell to 65.2% in 1911. The 1911 data shows that Welsh was more widely spoken among the older generation compared to the young, and amongst women compared to men. A shift in language was expedited with the loss of men during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and the resulting economic turmoil. English gradually began to replace Welsh as the community language, as shown by the decline of the Welsh language press in the town. This pattern continued after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> despite the advent of Welsh medium education. <a href="Ysgol%20Gymraeg%20Aberd%C3%A2r">Ysgol Gymraeg Aberdâr</a>, the Welsh-medium primary school, was established in the 1950s with Idwal Rees as head teacher.

<a href="Ironworks">Ironworks</a> were established at <a href="Llwydcoed">Llwydcoed</a> and <a href="Abernant%2C%20Rhondda%20Cynon%20Taff">Abernant</a> in 1799 and 1800 respectively, followed by others at Gadlys and <a href="Aberaman">Aberaman</a> in 1827 and 1847. The iron industry began to expand in a significant way around 1818 when the Crawshay family of Merthyr purchased the <a href="Hirwaun">Hirwaun</a> ironworks and place them under independent management. In the following year, <a href="Rowland%20Fothergill">Rowland Fothergill</a> took over the ironworks at <a href="Abernant%2C%20Rhondda%20Cynon%20Taf">Abernant</a> and a few years later did the same at <a href="Llwydcoed">Llwydcoed</a>. Both concerns later fell into the hands of his nephew <a href="Richard%20Fothergill%20%28politician%29">Richard Fothergill</a>. The Gadlys Ironworks was established in 1827 by Matthew Wayne, who had previously managed the <a href="Cyfarthfa">Cyfarthfa</a> ironworks at Merthyr. The Gadlys works, now considered an important archaeological site, originally comprised four blast furnaces, inner forges, rowing mills and puddling furnaces. The development of these works provided impetus to the growth of Aberdare as a nucleated town. The iron industry was gradually supserseded by coal and all the five iron works had closed by 1875, as the local supply of iron ore was inadequate to meet the ever-increasing demand created by the invention of steel, and as a result the importing of ore proved more profitable.

The iron industry had a relatively small impact upon the economy of Aberdare and in 1831 only 1.2% of the population was employed in manufacturing, as opposed to 19.8% in neighbouring Merthyr Tydfil. In the early years of Aberdare's development, most of the coal worked in the parish was coking coal, and was consumed locally, chiefly in the <a href="ironworks">ironworks</a>. Although the <a href="Gadlys">Gadlys</a> works was small in comparison with the other ironworks it became significant as the Waynes also became involved in the production of sale coal. In 1836, this activity led to the exploitation of the "Four-foot Seam" of high-<a href="heating%20value">calorific value</a> <a href="steam%20coal">steam coal</a> began, and pits were sunk in rapid succession.

In 1840, Thomas Powell sank a pit at <a href="Cwmbach">Cwmbach</a>, and during the next few years he opened another four pits. In the next few years, other local entrepreneurs now became involved in the expansion of the coal trade, including <a href="David%20Williams%20%28coal%20owner%29">David Williams</a> at Ynysgynon and <a href="David%20Davis%2C%20Blaengwawr%20%28coal%20owner%29">David Davis</a> at Blaengwawr, as well as the latter's son <a href="David%20Davis%2C%20Maesyffynnon%20%28coal%20owner%29">David Davis, Maesyffynnon</a>. They were joined by newcomers such as <a href="Crawshay%20Bailey">Crawshay Bailey</a> at Aberaman and, in due course, <a href="Sir%20George%20Elliot%2C%201st%20Baronet">George Elliot</a> in the lower part of the valley. This coal was valuable for steam railways and <a href="steam%20ship">steam ship</a>s, and an export trade began, via the <a href="Taff%20Vale%20Railway">Taff Vale Railway</a> and the port of <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>. The population of the parish rose from 6,471 in 1841 to 14,999 in 1851 and 32,299 in 1861 and John Davies described it as "the most dynamic place in Wales". In 1851, the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> decided to use Welsh steam coal in ships of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, and this decision boosted the reputation of Aberdare's product and launched a huge international export market. Coal mined in Aberdare parish rose from in 1844 to in 1850, and the coal trade, which after 1875 was the chief support of the town, soon reached huge dimensions.

The growth of the coal trade inevitably led to a number of industrial disputes, some of which were local and others which affected the wider coalfield. Trade unionism began to appear in the Aberdare Valley at intervals from the 1830s onwards but the first significant manifestation occurred during the <a href="Aberdare%20Strike%201857-8">Aberdare Strike of 1857–8</a>. The dispute was initiated by the depression in trade which followed the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a> and saw the local coal owners successfully impose a reduction in wages. The dispute did, however, witness an early manifestation of mass trade unionism amongst the miners of the valley and although unsuccessful the dispute saw the emergence of a stronger sense of solidarity amongst the miners.

Steam coal was subsequently found in the <a href="Ystradyfodwg">Rhondda</a> and further west, but many of the great companies of the Welsh coal industry's Gilded Age started operation in Aberdare and the lower Cynon Valley, including those of <a href="David%20Alfred%20Thomas%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Rhondda">Samuel Thomas</a>, <a href="David%20Davies%20%28industrialist%29">David Davies and Sons</a>, <a href="John%20Nixon%20%28mining%20engineer%29">Nixon's Navigation</a> and <a href="Powell%20Duffryn">Powell Duffryn</a>.

In common with the rest of the South Wales coalfield, Aberdare's coal industry commenced a long decline after <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and the last two deep mines still in operation in the 1960s were the small Aberaman and Fforchaman collieries, which closed in 1962 and 1965 respectively.

On 11 May 1919, an extensive fire broke out on Cardiff Street, Aberdare.
As a small village in the upland valleys of Glamorgan, Aberdare did not play any significant part in political life until its development as an industrial settlement. It was part of the lordship of Miskin, and the ancient office of High Constable continued in ceremonial form until relatively recent times.

In 1832, Aberdare was removed from the county of Glamorgan and became part of the parliamentary borough of <a href="Merthyr%20Tydfil%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Merthyr Tydfil</a>. For much of the nineteenth century, the representation was initially controlled by the ironmasters of Merthyr, notably the Guest family. From 1852 until 1868 the seat was held by <a href="Henry%20Bruce%2C%201st%20Baron%20Aberdare">Henry Austen Bruce</a> whose main industrial interests lay in the Aberdare valley. Bruce was a Liberal but was viewed with suspicion by the more <a href="Radicals%20%28UK%29">radical</a> faction which became increasingly influential within Welsh Liberalism in the 1860s. The radicals supported such policies as the disestablishment of the Church of England and were closely allied to the <a href="Liberation%20Society">Liberation Society</a>.

Nonconformist ministers played a prominent role in this new politics and, at Aberdare, they found an effective spokesman in the Rev <a href="Thomas%20Price%20%28Baptist%20minister%29">Thomas Price</a> minister of <a href="Calfaria%2C%20Aberdare">Calfaria, Aberdare</a>. Following the granting of a second parliamentary seat to the borough of Merthyr Tydfil in 1867, the Liberals of Aberdare sought to ensure that a candidate from their part of the constituency was returned alongside the sitting member, <a href="Henry%20Bruce%2C%201st%20Baron%20Aberdare">Henry Austen Bruce</a>. Their choice fell upon <a href="Richard%20Fothergill%20%28politician%29">Richard Fothergill</a>, owner of the ironworks at Abernant, who was enthusiastically supported by the Rev Thomas Price. Shortly before the election, however, <a href="Henry%20Richard">Henry Richard</a> intervened as a radical Liberal candidate, invited by the radicals of Merthyr. To many people's surprise, Price was lukewarm about his candidature and continued to support Fothergill. Ultimately, <a href="Henry%20Richard">Henry Richard</a> won a celebrated victory with Fothergill in second place and Bruce losing his seat. Richard thus became one of the-first radical MPs from Wales.

At the 1874 General Election, both Richard and Fothergill were again returned, although the former was criticised for his apparent lack of sympathy towards the miners during the industrial disputes of the early 1870s. This led to the emergence of Thomas Halliday as the first <a href="Liberal-Labour%20%28UK%29">labour</a> or working-class candidate to contest a Welsh constituency. Although he polled well, Halliday fell short of being elected. For the remainder of the nineteenth century, the constituency was represented by industrialists, most notably <a href="David%20Alfred%20Thomas">David Alfred Thomas</a>. In 1900, however, Thomas was joined by <a href="Keir%20Hardie">Keir Hardie</a>, the <a href="Independent%20Labour%20Party">ILP</a> candidate, who became the first labour representative to be returned for a Welsh constituency independent of the Liberal Party.

The <a href="Aberdare%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Aberdare</a> constituency came into being at the 1918 election. The first representative was <a href="Charles%20Butt%20Stanton">Charles Butt Stanton</a> who had been elected at a by-election following Hardie's death in 1915. However, in 1922, Stanton was defeated by a Labour candidate and the party has held the seat ever since. The only significant challenge came from <a href="Plaid%20Cymru">Plaid Cymru</a> at the 1970 and February 1974 General Elections but this performance has not since been repeated. Since 1984 the parliamentary seat, now known as <a href="Cynon%20Valley%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Cynon Valley</a> has been held by <a href="Ann%20Clwyd">Ann Clwyd</a>.

Until the mid-nineteenth century the local government of Aberdare and its locality remained in the hands of traditional structures such as the parish vestry and the High Constable, who was chosen on an annual basis. However, the rapid industrial development of the parsing resulted in the situation where these traditional bodies could not cope with the realities of an urbanised, industrial community which had developed without any planning or facilities. During the early decades of the century the iron masters gradually imposed their influence over local affairs and this remained the case following the formation of the Merthyr Board of Guardians in 1836. During the 1850s and early 1860s, however, as coal displaced iron as the main industry in the valley, the ironmasters were displaced as the dominant group in local government and administration by an alliance between mostly indigenous coal owners, shopkeepers and tradesmen, professional men and dissenting ministers. A central figure in this development was the Rev <a href="Thomas%20Price%20%28Baptist%20minister%29">Thomas Price</a>. The growth of this alliance was rooted in the reaction to the <a href="Treason%20of%20the%20Blue%20Books">1847 Education Reports</a> and the subsequent efforts to establish a British School at Aberdare.

In the 1840s there were no adequate sanitary facilities or water supply and life expectancy was low. Outbreaks of cholera and typhus were commonplace. Against this background, <a href="Thomas%20Webster%20Rammell">Thomas Webster Rammell</a> prepared a report for the General Board of Health on the sanitary condition of the parish, which concluded that a <a href="Aberdare%20Lpcal%20Board%20of%20Health">Local Board of Health</a> be established. This happened in 1854. Its first chairman was <a href="Richard%20Fothergill%20%28politician%29">Richard Fothergill</a> and the members included <a href="David%20Davis%2C%20Blaengwawr%20%28coal%20owner%29">David Davis, Blaengwawr</a>, <a href="David%20Williams%20%28coal%20owner%29">David Williams ("Alaw Goch")</a>, <a href="Rees%20Hopkin%20Rhys%20%28industrialist%20and%20local%20politician%29">Rees Hopkin Rhys</a> and the <a href="Thomas%20Price%20%28Baptist%20minister%29">Rev. Thomas Price</a>. It was followed by the <a href="Aberdare%20School%20Board">Aberdare School Board</a> in 1871.

By 1889, the Local Board of Health had initiated a number of developments which included the purchase of local reservoirs from the Aberdare Waterworks Company for £97,000, a sewerage scheme costing £35,000, as well as the opening of <a href="Aberdare%20Park">Aberdare Public Park</a> and a local fever hospital. The lack of a Free Library, however, remained a concern.

Later, the formation of the <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Council">Glamorgan County Council</a> (upon which Aberdare had five elected members) in 1889, followed by the <a href="Aberdare%20Urban%20District%20Council">Aberdare Urban District Council</a>, which replaced the Local Board in 1889, transformed the local politics of the Aberdare valley.

At the <a href="1889%20Glamorgan%20County%20Council%20Elections">1889 Glamorgan County Council Elections</a> most of the elected representatives were coalowners and industrialists and the only exception in the earlier period was the miners' agent <a href="David%20Morgan%20%28trade%20unionist%29">David Morgan</a> (Dai o'r Nant), elected in 1892 as a labour representative. From the early 1900s, however, Labour candidates began to gain ground and dominated local government from the 1920s onwards. The same pattern was seen on the Aberdare UDC.

In 1974, following local government re-organization, Aberdare became part of the county of <a href="Mid%20Glamorgan">Mid Glamorgan</a> and the <a href="Cynon%20Valley%20Borough%20Council">Cynon Valley Borough Council</a>. Labour members held a majority of seats on both authorities until their abolition in 1996. Since the latest re-organization, Aberdare has been part of the <a href="Rhondda%20Cynon%20Taff">Rhondda Cynon Taff</a> unitary authority. Once again, Labour has been the majority party although <a href="Plaid%20Cymru">Plaid Cymru</a> controlled the authority from 1999 until 2003.

Aberdare, during its boom years, was considered a centre of <a href="Welsh%20culture">Welsh culture</a>: it hosted the first <a href="National%20Eisteddfod">National Eisteddfod</a> in 1861, with which <a href="David%20Williams%20%28coal%20owner%29">David Williams (Alaw Goch)</a> was closely associated. A number of local eisteddfodau had long been held in the locality, associated with figures such as <a href="William%20Williams%20%28Carw%20Coch%29">William Williams (Carw Coch)</a> The Eisteddfod was again held in Aberdare in 1885, and also in 1956 at <a href="Aberdare%20Park">Aberdare Park</a> where the <a href="Gorsedd%20stones">Gorsedd standing stones</a> still exist. At the last National Eisteddfod held in Aberdare in 1956 Mathonwy Hughes won the chair. From the mid nineteenth century, Aberdare was an important publishing centre where a large number of books and journals were produced, the majority of which were in the Welsh language. A newspaper entitled <a href="Y%20Gwladgarwr">Y Gwladgarwr</a> (the Patriot) was published at Aberdare from 1856 until 1882 and was circulated widely throughout the South Wales valleys. From 1875 a more successful newspaper, <a href="Tarian%20y%20Gweithiwr">Tarian y Gweithiwr</a> (the Workman's Shield) was published at Aberdare by John Mills. Y Darian, as it was known, strongly supported the trade union movements among the miners and ironworkers of the valleys. The miners' leader, <a href="William%20Abraham%20%28trade%20unionist%29">William Abraham</a>, derived support from the newspaper, which was also aligned with radical nonconformist liberalism. The rise of the political labour movement and the subsequent decline of the Welsh language in the valleys, ultimately led to its decline and closure in 1934.

The <a href="Coliseum%20Theatre%20%28Aberdare%29">Coliseum Theatre</a> is Aberdare's main <a href="arts">arts</a> venue, containing a 600-seat <a href="auditorium">auditorium</a> and cinema. It is situated in nearby <a href="Trecynon">Trecynon</a> and was built in 1938 using <a href="miner">miner</a>s' subscriptions.

The <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> poet <a href="Alun%20Lewis%20%28poet%29">Alun Lewis</a>, was born near Aberdare in the village <a href="Cwmaman">Cwmaman</a> and there is a plaque commemorating him, including a quotation from his poem "The Mountain over Aberdare".

The founding members of the rock band <a href="Stereophonics">Stereophonics</a> originated from the nearby village of <a href="Cwmaman">Cwmaman</a>. It is also the hometown of guitarist <a href="Mark%20Parry%20%28musician%29">Mark Parry</a> of Vancouver rock band <a href="The%20Manvils">The Manvils</a>. Famed <a href="anarcho-punk">anarchist-punk</a> band <a href="Crass">Crass</a> played their last live show for striking miners in Aberdare during the <a href="UK%20miners%27%20strike%20%281984-1985%29">UK miners' strike</a>.

<a href="Griffith%20Rhys%20Jones">Griffith Rhys Jones − or Caradog</a> as he was commonly known − was the Conductor of the famous 'Côr Mawr' of some 460 voices (the South Wales Choral Union), which twice won first prize at Crystal Palace choral competitions in London in the 1870s. He is depicted in the town's most prominent statue by sculptor <a href="Sir%20William%20Goscombe%20John">Goscombe John</a>, unveiled on Victoria Square in 1920.

The original parish church of <a href="St%20John%27s%20Church%2C%20Aberdare">St John the Baptist</a> was originally built in 1189. Some of its original architecture is still intact.
With the development of Aberdare as an industrial centre in the nineteenth century it became increasingly apparent that the ancient church was far too small to service the perceived spiritual needs of an urban community, particularly in view of the rapid growth of nonconformity from the 1830s onwards. Eventually, <a href="John%20Griffith%20%28Anglican%20priest%29">John Griffith</a>, the rector of Aberdare undertook to raise funds to build a new church, leading to the rapid construction of <a href="St%20Elvan%27s%20Church%2C%20Aberdare">St Elvan's Church</a> in the town centre between 1851 and 1852. This <a href="Church%20in%20Wales">Church in Wales</a> church still stands the heart of the parish of Aberdare and has had extensive work since its erection. The church has a modern electrical, two-manual and pedal board pipe organ, that is still used in services.
John Griffith, vicar of Aberdare, who built St Elvan's, transformed the role of the Anglican church in the valley by building a number of other churches, including <a href="St%20Fagan%27s%20Church">St Fagan's</a>, <a href="Trecynon">Trecynon</a>. Other churches in the parish are St Luke's (<a href="Cwmdare">Cwmdare</a>), St James's (<a href="Llwydcoed">Llwydcoed</a>) and St Matthew's Church (1891) (<a href="Abernant%2C%20Rhondda%20Cynon%20Taf">Abernant</a>).

In the parish of Aberaman and Cwmaman is St Margaret's Church, with an old, but beautiful, pipe organ with two manuals and a pedal board. Also in this parish is St Joseph's Church, Cwmaman. St Joseph's has recently undergone much recreational work, almost converting the church into a community centre. However, regular church services still take place. Here, there is a two-manual and pedal board electric organ, with speakers at the front and sides of the church.

In 1910 there were 34 Anglican churches in the Urban District of Aberdare. A survey of the attendance at places of worship on a particular Sunday in that year recorded that 17.8% of worshippers attended church services, with the remainder attending nonconformist chapels.

The Aberdare Valley was a stronghold of <a href="Nonconformity%20in%20Wales">Nonconformity</a> from the mid-nineteenth century until the inter-war years. In the aftermath of the <a href="Treachery%20of%20the%20Blue%20Books">1847 Education Reports</a> nonconformists became increasingly active in the political and educational life of Wales and in few places was this as prevalent as at Aberdare. The leading figure was <a href="Thomas%20Price%20%28Baptist%20minister%29">Thomas Price</a>, minister of Calfaria, Aberdare.

Aberdare was a major centre of the <a href="1904%E2%80%931905%20Welsh%20Revival">1904-05 Religious Revival</a>, which had begun at <a href="Loughor">Loughor</a> near Swansea. The revival aroused alarm among ministers for the revolutionary, even anarchistic, impact it had upon chapel congregations and denominational organization. In particular, it was seen as drawing attention away from pulpit preaching and the role of the minister. The local newspaper, the "Aberdare Leader", regarded the revival with suspicion from the outset, objecting to the 'abnormal heat' which it engendered. <a href="Trecynon">Trecynon</a> was particularly affected by the revival, and the meetings held there were sais to have aroused more emotion and excitement than the more restrained meetings in Aberdare itself. The impact of the revival was significant in the short term, but in the longer term was fairly transient.

Once the immediate impact of the revival had faded, it was clear from the early twentieth century that there was a gradual decline in the influence of the chapels. This can be explained by several factors, including the rise of socialism and the process of linguistic change which saw the younger generation increasingly turn to the English language. There were also theological controversies such as that over the New Theology propounded by <a href="R.J.%20Campbell">R.J. Campbell</a>.

Of the many chapels, few are still used for their original purpose and a number of closed since the turn of the millennium. Many have been converted for housing or other purposes (including one at Robertstown which has become a mosque), and others demolished. Among the notable chapels were <a href="Calfaria%2C%20Aberdare">Calfaria, Aberdare</a> and <a href="Seion%2C%20Cwmaman">Seion, Cwmaman</a> (Baptist); <a href="Saron%2C%20Aberaman">Saron, Aberaman</a> and <a href="Siloa%2C%20Aberdare">Siloa, Aberdare</a> (Independent); and <a href="Bethania%2C%20Aberdare">Bethania, Aberdare</a> (Calvinistic Methodist).

The earliest Welsh Independent, or Congregationalist chapel in the Aberdare area was Ebenezer, trecynon, although meetings had been held from the latter years of the eighteenth century in dwelling houses in the locality, for example at Hirwaun. During the nineteenth century, the Independents showed the biggest increases in terms of places of worship: from two in 1837 to twenty-five (four of them being English causes), in 1897. By 1910 there were 35 Independent chapels, with a total membership of 8,612. <a href="Siloa%2C%20Aberdare">Siloa Chapel</a> was the largest of the Independent chapels in Aberdare and is one of the few that remain open today, having been 're-established' as a Welsh language chapel. The Independent ministers of nineteenth-century Aberdare included some powerful personalities but none had the kind of wider social authority which Thomas Price enjoyed amongst the Baptists.
Of the other Independent chapels in the valley <a href="Saron%2C%20Aberaman">Saron</a>, in Davis Street, Aberaman, was used for regular services by a small group of members until 2011. For many years, these were held in a small side-room, and not the chapel itself. The chapel has a large vestry comprising rows of two-way-facing wooden benches and a stage, with a side entrance onto Beddoe Street and back entrance to Lewis Street. Although the building is not in good repair, the interior, including pulpit and balcony seating area (back & sides), was in good order but the chapel eventually closed due to the very small number of members remaining. In February 1999, Saron was made a Grade II Listed Building.

The Baptists were the most influential of the nonconformist denominations in Aberdare and their development was led by the Rev. <a href="Thomas%20Price%20%28Baptist%20minister%29">Thomas Price</a> who came to Aberdare in the early 1840s as minister of <a href="Calfaria%2C%20Aberdare">Calfaria</a> Chapel. In 1837 the Baptists had three chapels, but in 1897 there were twenty, seventeen of them being Welsh. By 1910 the number of chapels had increased to 30, with a total membership of 7,422. Most of these Baptist chapels were established under the influence of Thomas Price who encouraged members to establish branch chapels to attract migrants who flocked to the town and locality from rural Wales. The chapels came together for regular gatherings, including baptismal services which were held in the <a href="River%20Cynon">River Cynon</a> As a result, Price exerted an influence in the religious life of the locality which was far greater than that of any other minister.

By 1910 there were 24 Calvinistic Methodist chapels in the Aberdare Urban District with a total membership of 4,879. The most prominent of these was <a href="Bethania%2C%20Aberdare">Bethania, Aberdare</a>, once the largest chapel in Aberdare. Derelict for many years, it was demolished in 2015. The Methodists were numerically powerful and while some of their ministers such as William James of <a href="Bethania%2C%20Aberdare">Bethania</a> served on the <a href="Aberdare%20School%20Board">Aberdare School Board</a> and other public bodies, their constitution militated against the sort of active political action which came more naturally to the Baptists and Independents.

The other denominations were weaker, including the Wesleyan Methodists who had 14 places of worship by 1910. There was also a significant Unitarian tradition in the valley and three places of worship by 1910. Highland Place Unitarian Church celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2010, with a number of lectures on its history and the history of Unitarianism in Wales taking place there. The church has a two-manual pipe organ with pedal board that is used to accompany all services. The current organist is Jacob Jones. The connected schoolroom is used for post-service meetings and socialising.

The state of education in the parish was a cause for concern during the early industrial period as is illustrated by the reaction to the <a href="Treachery%20of%20the%20Blue%20Books">1847 Education Reports</a>. Initially, there was an outcry, led by the Rev <a href="Thomas%20Price%20%28Baptist%20minister%29">Thomas Price</a> against the comments made by the vicar of Aberdare in his submission to the commissioners. However, on closer reflection, the reports related the deficiencies of educational provision, not only in Aberdare itself but also in the communities of the valleys generally. In so doing they not only criticised the ironmasters for their failure to provide schools for workers' children but also the nonconformists for not establishing <a href="British%20and%20Foreign%20School%20Society">British Schools</a>. At the ten schools in Aberdare there was accommodation for only 1,317 children, a small proportion of the population. Largely as a result of these criticisms, the main nonconformist denominations worked together to establish a British School, known locally as Ysgol y Comin, which was opened in 1848, accommodating 200 pupils. Funds were raised which largely cleared the debts and the opening of the school was marked by a public meeting addressed by Price and <a href="David%20Williams%20%28coal%20owner%29">David Williams ("Alaw Goch")</a>.

Much energy was expended during this period on conflicts between Anglicans and nonconformists over education. The establishment of the <a href="Aberdare%20School%20Board">Aberdare School Board</a> in 1871 brought about an extension of educational provision but also intensified religious rivalries. School Board elections were invariably fought on religious grounds. Despite these tensions the Board took over a number of existing schools and established new ones. By 1889, fourteen schools were operated by the Board but truancy and lack of attendance remained a problem, as in many industrial districts.

In common with other public bodies at the time (see 'Local Government' above), membership of the School Board was dominated by coal owners and colliery officials, nonconformist ministers, professional men and tradesmen. Only occasionally was an Anglican clergyman elected and, with the exception of <a href="David%20Morgan%20%28trade%20unionist%29">David Morgan ("Dai o'r Nant")</a>, no working class candidates were elected for more than one term.

<a href="Aberdare%20Athletic%20F.C.">Aberdare Athletic F.C.</a> were members of the <a href="Football%20League">Football League</a> between 1921 and 1927 before being replaced by <a href="Torquay%20United">Torquay United</a> after finishing bottom. The senior club folded a year later. They played their football league games at the <a href="Aberdare%20Athletic%20Ground">Aberdare Athletic Ground</a> and were known as the Darians. The reserve team carried on as Aberaman and Aberdare Athletic for one more season and were known as <a href="Aberaman%20Athletic%20F.C.">Aberaman Athletic F.C.</a> Now renamed as Aberdare Town They play in the Welsh League Division Two at Aberaman Park

<a href="Aberdare%20RFC">Aberdare Rugby Football Club</a> are a <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> team formed in 1890 which still play in Aberdare today at the Ynys Stadium.

The <a href="Aberdare%20Athletic%20Ground">Aberdare Athletic Ground</a> was the venue of the first <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a> international, played between <a href="Wales%20national%20rugby%20league%20team">Wales</a> and the <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20league%20team%23The%20All%20Golds">New Zealand All Golds</a> on New Year's Day 1908, which was won by the Welsh 9-8.

The town is served by <a href="Aberdare%20railway%20station">Aberdare railway station</a> and <a href="Aberdare%20bus%20station">Aberdare bus station</a>, opposite each other in the town centre. The town has also been subject to an extensive redevelopment scheme during 2012–13.

With the decline of both iron and coal, Aberdare has become reliant on commercial businesses as a major source of employment. Its industries include cable manufacture, smokeless fuels, and tourism.

An aberration is something that deviates from the normal way.

Aberration of light

The aberration of light (also referred to as astronomical aberration, stellar aberration, or velocity aberration) is an <a href="Astronomy">astronomical</a> phenomenon which produces an <a href="apparent%20place">apparent motion</a> of celestial objects about their true positions, dependent on the velocity of the observer. Aberration causes objects to appear to be displaced towards the direction of motion of the observer compared to when the observer is stationary. The change in angle is typically very small — of the order of "v/c" where "c" is the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a> and "v" the <a href="velocity">velocity</a> of the observer. In the case of "stellar" or "annual" aberration, the apparent position of a star to an observer on Earth varies periodically over the course of a year as the Earth's velocity changes as it <a href="orbital%20revolution">revolves</a> around the Sun, by a maximum angle of approximately 20 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s in <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> or <a href="declination">declination</a>.

The term "aberration" has historically been used to refer to a number of related phenomena concerning the propagation of light in moving bodies. 
Aberration should not be confused with "<a href="stellar%20parallax">parallax</a>". The latter is a change in the apparent position of a relatively nearby object, as measured by a moving observer, relative to more distant objects that define a reference frame. The amount of parallax depends on the "distance" of the object from the observer, whereas aberration does not. Aberration is also related to <a href="light-time%20correction">light-time correction</a> and <a href="relativistic%20beaming">relativistic beaming</a>, although it is often considered separately from these effects.

Aberration is historically significant because of its role in the development of the theories of <a href="light">light</a>, <a href="electromagnetism">electromagnetism</a> and, ultimately, the theory of <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a>. It was first observed in the late 1600s by astronomers searching for stellar parallax in order to confirm the <a href="heliocentrism">heliocentric model</a> of the Solar System. However, it was not understood at the time to be a different phenomenon.
In 1727, <a href="James%20Bradley">James Bradley</a> provided a <a href="Classical%20physics">classical</a> explanation for it in terms of the finite speed of light relative to the motion of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun, 
which he used to make one of the earliest measurements of the speed of light. However, Bradley's theory was incompatible with 19th century theories of light, and aberration became a major motivation for the <a href="aether%20drag%20hypothesis">aether drag theories</a> of <a href="Augustin-Jean%20Fresnel">Augustin Fresnel</a> (in 1818) and <a href="George%20Gabriel%20Stokes">G. G. Stokes</a> (in 1845), and for <a href="Hendrik%20Lorentz">Hendrik Lorentz</a>'s <a href="Lorentz%20ether%20theory">aether theory</a> of electromagnetism in 1892. The aberration of light, together with Lorentz's elaboration of <a href="Maxwell%27s%20equations">Maxwell's electrodynamics</a>, the <a href="moving%20magnet%20and%20conductor%20problem">moving magnet and conductor problem</a>, the <a href="Michelson%E2%80%93Morley%20experiment">negative aether drift experiments</a>, as well as the <a href="Fizeau%20experiment">Fizeau experiment</a>, led <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> to develop the theory of special relativity in 1905, which provided a conclusive explanation for the phenomenon.

Aberration may be explained as the difference in angle of a beam of light in different <a href="inertial%20frames%20of%20reference">inertial frames of reference</a>. A common analogy is to consider the apparent direction of falling rain. If rain is falling vertically in the frame of reference of a person standing still, then to a person moving forwards the rain will appear to arrive at an angle, requiring the moving observer to tilt their umbrella forwards. The faster the observer moves, the more tilt is needed.

The net effect is that light rays striking the moving observer from the sides in a stationary frame will come angled from ahead in the moving observer's frame. This effect is sometimes called the "searchlight" or "headlight" effect.

In the case of annual aberration of starlight, the direction of incoming starlight as seen in the Earth's moving frame is tilted relative to the angle observed in the Sun's frame. Since the direction of motion of the Earth changes during its orbit, the direction of this tilting changes during the course of the year, and causes the apparent position of the star to differ from its true position as measured in the inertial frame of the Sun.

While classical reasoning gives intuition for aberration, it leads to a number of physical paradoxes observable even at the classical level (see <a href="%23Historical_Theories_of_Aberration">history</a>). The theory of <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a> is required to correctly account for aberration. The relativistic explanation is very similar to the classical one however, and in both theories aberration may be understood as a case of <a href="vector%20space">addition of velocities</a>.

In the Sun's frame, consider a beam of light with velocity equal to the speed of light c, with x and y velocity components formula_1 and formula_2, at an angle formula_3. If the Earth is moving at velocity formula_4 in the x direction relative to the Sun, then by velocity addition the x component of the beam's velocity in the Earth's frame of reference is formula_5, and the y velocity is unchanged, formula_6. (Note that you need the velocity of the Sun with respect to the Earth which is the negative of the velocity of the Earth with respect to the Sun. Also note that we are only using vectors here without indication of direction.) Thus the angle of the light in the Earth's frame in terms of the angle in the Sun's frame is

In the case of formula_8, this result reduces to formula_9.

The reasoning in the relativistic case is the same except that the <a href="Velocity-addition%20formula">relativistic velocity addition</a> formulae must be used, which can be derived from <a href="Lorentz%20transformations">Lorentz transformations</a> between different frames of reference. These formulae are

where formula_12, giving the components of the light beam in the Earth's frame in terms of the components in the Sun's frame. The angle of the beam in the Earth's frame is thus 

In the case of formula_8, this result reduces to formula_15, and in the limit formula_16 this may be approximated by formula_17. This relativistic derivation keeps the speed of light formula_18 constant in all frames of reference, unlike the classical derivation above.

Aberration is related to two other phenomena, <a href="light-time%20correction">light-time correction</a>, which is due to the motion of an observed object during the time taken by its light to reach an observer, and <a href="relativistic%20beaming">relativistic beaming</a>, which is an angling of the light emitted by a moving light source. It can be considered equivalent to them but in a different inertial frame of reference. In aberration, the observer is considered to be moving relative to a (for the sake of simplicity) stationary light source, while in light-time correction and relativistic beaming the light source is considered to be moving relative to a stationary observer.

Consider the case of an observer and a light source moving relative to each other at constant velocity, with a light beam moving from the source to the observer. At the moment of emission, the beam in the observer's rest frame is tilted compared to the one in the source's rest frame, as understood through relativistic beaming. During the time it takes the light beam to reach the observer the light source moves in the observer's frame, and the 'true position' of the light source is displaced relative to the apparent position the observer sees, as explained by light-time correction. Finally, the beam in the observer's frame at the moment of observation is tilted compared to the beam in source's frame, which can be understood as an aberrational effect. Thus, a person in the light source's frame would describe the apparent tilting of the beam in terms of aberration, while a person in the observer's frame would describe it as a light-time effect.

The relationship between these phenomena is only valid if the observer and source's frames are inertial frames. In practice, because the Earth is not an inertial rest frame but experiences centripetal <a href="acceleration">acceleration</a> towards the Sun, many aberrational effects such as annual aberration on Earth cannot be considered light-time corrections. However, if the time between emission and detection of the light is short compared to the orbital period of the Earth, the Earth may be approximated as an inertial frame and aberrational effects are equivalent to light-time corrections.

There are a number of types of aberration, caused by the differing components of the Earth's and observed object's motion:


Annual aberration is caused by the motion of an observer on the Earth revolving around the Sun. The velocity formula_4 of the Earth (in the Sun's rest frame) varies periodically over the course of a year as the Earth traverses its orbit and consequently the aberration also varies periodically, typically causing stars to appear to move in small ellipses.

Approximating the Earth's orbit as circular, the maximum displacement of a star due to annual aberration is known as the "constant of aberration", conventionally represented by formula_20. It may be calculated using the relation formula_21 substituting the Earth's average speed in the Sun's frame for formula_4 and the speed of light formula_23. Its accepted value is 20″.49552  <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s (at <a href="J2000">J2000</a>).

Assuming a circular orbit, annual aberration causes stars exactly on the <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a> (the plane of the Earth's orbit) to appear to move back and forth along a straight line, varying by formula_20 on either side of their position in the Sun's frame. A star that is precisely at one of the <a href="ecliptic%20pole">ecliptic pole</a>s (at 90 degrees from the ecliptic plane) will appear to move in a circle of radius formula_20 about its true position, and stars at intermediate <a href="ecliptic%20latitude">ecliptic latitude</a>s will appear to move along a small <a href="ellipse">ellipse</a>.

For illustration, consider a star at the northern ecliptic pole viewed by an observer at a point on the <a href="Arctic%20Circle">Arctic Circle</a>. Such an observer will see the star <a href="culmination">transit</a> at the <a href="zenith">zenith</a>, once every day (strictly speaking <a href="sidereal%20day">sidereal day</a>). At the time of the <a href="March%20equinox">March equinox</a>, the Earth's orbit carries the observer in a southwards direction, and the star's apparent <a href="declination">declination</a> is therefore displaced to the south by an angle of formula_20. At the <a href="September%20equinox">September equinox</a>, the star's position is displaced to the north by an equal and opposite amount. At the June and December <a href="solstice">solstice</a>s, the displacement in declination is zero. Conversely, the amount of displacement in <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> is zero at either <a href="equinox">equinox</a> and maximum at the solstices.
In practice the Earth's orbit is slightly elliptic rather than circular and its speed changes somewhat over the course of its orbit, which means the description above is only approximate. Aberration is more accurately calculated using the Earth's instantaneous velocity relative to the center of mass of the Solar System.

Note that the displacement due to aberration is orthogonal to any displacement due to parallax. If parallax were detectable, the maximum displacement to the south would occur in December, and the maximum displacement to the north in June. It is this apparently anomalous motion that so mystified early astronomers.

A special case of annual aberration is the nearly constant deflection of the Sun from its position in the Sun's rest frame by formula_20 towards the "west" (as viewed from Earth), opposite to the apparent motion of the Sun along the ecliptic (which is from west to east, as seen from Earth). The deflection thus makes the Sun appear to be behind (or retarded) from its rest-frame position on the ecliptic by a position or angle formula_20.

This deflection may equivalently be described as a light-time effect due to motion of the Earth during the 8.3 minutes that it takes light to travel from the Sun to Earth. This is possible since the transit time of sunlight is short relative to the orbital period of the Earth, so the Earth's frame may be approximated as inertial. In the Earth's frame, the Sun moves by a distance formula_29 in the time it takes light to reach Earth, formula_30 for the orbit of radius formula_31. This gives an angular correction formula_32 which can be solved to give formula_33, the same as the aberrational correction.

Planetary aberration is the combination of the aberration of light (due to Earth's velocity) and light-time correction (due to the object's motion and distance), as calculated in the rest frame of the Solar System. Both are determined at the instant when the moving object's light reaches the moving observer on Earth. It is so called because it is usually applied to planets and other objects in the Solar System whose motion and distance are accurately known.

Diurnal aberration is caused by the velocity of the observer on the surface of the rotating Earth. It is therefore dependent not only on the time of the observation, but also the <a href="latitude">latitude</a> and <a href="longitude">longitude</a> of the observer. Its effect is much smaller than that of annual aberration, and is only 0′′.32 in the case of an observer at the equator, where the rotational velocity is greatest.

The Sun and Solar System are revolving around the center of the Galaxy. Aberration due to this motion is known as secular aberration and affects the apparent positions of distant stars and <a href="extragalactic%20astronomy">extragalactic</a> objects. However, since the <a href="galactic%20year">galactic year</a> is about 230 million years, the aberration varies very slowly and this change is extremely difficult to observe. Therefore, secular aberration is usually ignored when considering the positions of stars. In other words, star maps show the observed apparent positions of the stars, not their calculated true positions after accounting for secular aberration.

For stars significantly less than 230 million <a href="light%20years">light years</a> away, the Solar System may be approximated as an inertial frame and so the effect of secular aberration is equivalent to a light-time correction. This includes stars in the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, since the Milky Way is about 100,000 light years in diameter. For these stars the true position of the star is then easily computed from its <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> and its distance.

Secular aberration is typically a small number of <a href="arcminutes">arcminutes</a>, for example the stationary star <a href="Groombridge%201830">Groombridge 1830</a> is displaced by approximately 3 arcminutes, due to secular aberration. This is roughly 8 times the effect of annual aberration, as one would expect since the velocity of the Solar System relative to the center of the Galaxy is about 8 times the velocity of the Earth relative to the Sun.

The discovery of the aberration of light was totally unexpected, and it was only by considerable perseverance and perspicacity that <a href="James%20Bradley">Bradley</a> was able to explain it in 1727. It originated from attempts to discover whether stars possessed appreciable <a href="stellar%20parallax">parallaxes</a>.

The <a href="Nicolaus%20Copernicus">Copernican</a> <a href="heliocentricity">heliocentric</a> theory of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> had received confirmation by the observations of <a href="Galileo%20Galilei">Galileo</a> and <a href="Tycho%20Brahe">Tycho Brahe</a> and the mathematical investigations of <a href="Johannes%20Kepler">Kepler</a> and <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Newton</a>. As early as 1573, <a href="Thomas%20Digges">Thomas Digges</a> had suggested that parallactic shifting of the stars should occur according to the heliocentric model, and consequently if stellar parallax could be observed it would help confirm this theory. Many observers claimed to have determined such parallaxes, but Tycho Brahe and <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Riccioli">Giovanni Battista Riccioli</a> concluded that they existed only in the minds of the observers, and were due to instrumental and personal errors. However, in 1680 <a href="Jean%20Picard">Jean Picard</a>, in his "Voyage d’<a href="Uraniborg">Uranibourg</a>," stated, as a result of ten <a href="year">year</a>s' observations, that <a href="Polaris">Polaris</a>, the Pole Star, exhibited variations in its position amounting to 40″ annually. Some astronomers endeavoured to explain this by parallax, but these attempts failed because the motion differed from that which parallax would produce. <a href="John%20Flamsteed">John Flamsteed</a>, from measurements made in 1689 and succeeding years with his mural quadrant, similarly concluded that the declination of Polaris was 40″ less in July than in September. <a href="Robert%20Hooke">Robert Hooke</a>, in 1674, published his observations of <a href="Gamma%20Draconis">γ Draconis</a>, a star of <a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a> 2 which passes practically overhead at the latitude of <a href="London">London</a> (hence its observations are largely free from the complex corrections due to <a href="atmospheric%20refraction">atmospheric refraction</a>), and concluded that this star was 23″ more northerly in July than in October.

Consequently, when Bradley and <a href="Samuel%20Molyneux">Samuel Molyneux</a> entered this sphere of research in 1725, there was still considerable uncertainty as to whether stellar parallaxes had been observed or not, and it was with the intention of definitely answering this question that they erected a large telescope at Molyneux's house at <a href="Kew">Kew</a>. They decided to reinvestigate the motion of γ Draconis with a telescope constructed by <a href="George%20Graham%20%28clockmaker%29">George Graham</a> (1675–1751), a celebrated instrument-maker. This was fixed to a vertical chimney stack in such manner as to permit a small oscillation of the eyepiece, the amount of which (i.e. the deviation from the vertical) was regulated and measured by the introduction of a screw and a plumb line.

The instrument was set up in November 1725, and observations on γ Draconis were made starting in December. The star was observed to move 40″ southwards between September and March, and then reversed its course from March to September. At the same time, <a href="HD%2040873">35 Camelopardalis</a>, a star with a right ascension nearly exactly opposite to that of γ Draconis, was 19" more northerly at the beginning of March than in September. These results were completely unexpected and inexplicable by existing theories.

Bradley and Molyneux discussed several hypotheses in the hope of finding the solution. Since the apparent motion was evidently caused neither by parallax nor observational errors, Bradley first hypothesized that it could be due to oscillations in the orientation of the Earth's axis relative to the celestial sphere – a phenomenon known as <a href="astronomical%20nutation">nutation</a>. 35 Camelopardalis was seen to possess an apparent motion which could be consistent with nutation, but since its declination varied only one half as much as that of γ Draconis, it was obvious that nutation did not supply the answer (however, Bradley later went on to discover that the Earth does indeed nutate). He also investigated the possibility that the motion was due to an irregular distribution of the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a>, thus involving abnormal variations in the refractive index, but again obtained negative results.

On August 19, 1727, Bradley embarked upon a further series of observations using a telescope of his own erected at the Rectory, <a href="Wanstead">Wanstead</a>. This instrument had the advantage of a larger field of view and he was able to obtain precise positions of a large number of stars over the course of about twenty years. During his first two years at Wanstead, he established the existence of the phenomenon of aberration beyond all doubt, and this also enabled him to formulate a set of rules that would allow the calculation of the effect on any given star at a specified date.

Bradley eventually developed his explanation of aberration in about September 1728 and this theory was presented to the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> in mid January the following year. One well-known story was that he saw the change of direction of a wind vane on a boat on the Thames, caused not by an alteration of the wind itself, but by a change of course of the boat relative to the wind direction.
However, there is no record of this incident in Bradley's own account of the discovery, and it may therefore be <a href="apocrypha">apocrypha</a>l.

Based on his early calculations, Bradley was able to estimate the constant of aberration at 20", and with this was able to estimate the speed of light at per second.

The discovery and elucidation of aberration is now regarded as a classic case of the application of <a href="scientific%20method">scientific method</a>, in which observations are made to test a theory, but unexpected results are sometimes obtained that in turn lead to new discoveries. It is also worth noting that part of the original motivation of the search for stellar parallax was to test the Copernican theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun, but of course the existence of aberration also establishes the truth of that theory.

The phenomenon of aberration became a driving force for many physical theories during the 200 years between its observation and the conclusive explanation by Albert Einstein.

The first classical explanation was provided in 1729, by James Bradley as described above, who attributed it to the finite <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a> and the motion of <a href="Earth">Earth</a> in its orbit around the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>. However, this explanation proved inaccurate once the wave nature of light was better understood, and correcting it became a major goal of the 19th century theories of <a href="luminiferous%20aether">luminiferous aether</a>. <a href="Augustin-Jean%20Fresnel">Augustin-Jean Fresnel</a> proposed a correction due to the motion of a medium (the aether) through which light propagated, known as <a href="Aether%20drag%20hypothesis">"partial aether drag"</a>. He proposed that objects partially drag the aether along with them as they move, and this became the accepted explanation for aberration for some time. <a href="George%20Gabriel%20Stokes">George Stokes</a> proposed a similar theory, explaining that aberration occurs due to the flow of aether induced by the motion of the Earth. Accumulated evidence against these explanations, combined with new understanding of the electromagnetic nature of light, led <a href="Hendrik%20Lorentz">Hendrik Lorentz</a> to develop an <a href="Lorentz%20ether%20theory">electron theory</a> which featured an immobile aether, and he explained that objects contract in length as they move through the aether. Motivated by these previous theories, <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> then developed the theory of <a href="special%20relativity">special relativity</a> in 1905, which provides the modern account of aberration.

Bradley conceived of an explanation in terms of a <a href="corpuscular%20theory%20of%20light">corpuscular theory of light</a> in which light is made of particles unaffected by gravity. His classical explanation appeals to the motion of the earth relative to a beam of light-particles moving at a finite velocity, and is developed in the Sun's frame of reference, unlike the classical derivation given above.

Consider the case where a distant star is motionless relative to the Sun, and the star is extremely far away, so that parallax may be ignored. In the rest frame of the Sun, this means light from the star travels in parallel paths to the Earth observer, and arrives at the same angle regardless of where the Earth is in its orbit. Suppose the star is observed on Earth with a telescope, idealized as a narrow tube. The light enters the tube from the star at angle formula_34 and travels at speed formula_23 taking a time formula_36 to reach the bottom of the tube, where it is detected. Suppose observations are made from Earth, which is moving with a speed formula_4. During the transit of the light, the tube moves a distance formula_38. Consequently, for the particles of light to reach the bottom of the tube, the tube must be inclined at an angle formula_39 different from formula_34, resulting in an "apparent" position of the star at angle formula_39. As the Earth proceeds in its orbit it changes direction, so formula_39 changes with the time of year the observation is made. The apparent angle and true angle are related using trigonometry as:

In the case of formula_8, this gives formula_45. While this is different from the more accurate relativistic result described above, in the limit of small angle and low velocity they are approximately the same, within the error of the measurements of Bradley's day. These results allowed Bradley to make one of the earliest measurements of the <a href="Speed%20of%20light%23History">speed of light</a>.

In the early nineteenth century the wave theory of light was being rediscovered, and in 1804 <a href="Thomas%20Young%20%28scientist%29">Thomas Young</a> adapted Bradley's explanation for corpuscular light to wavelike light traveling through a medium known as the luminiferous aether. His reasoning was the same as Bradley's, but it required that this medium be immobile in the Sun's reference frame and must pass through the earth unaffected, otherwise the medium (and therefore the light) would move along with the earth and no aberration would be observed. 
However, it soon became clear Young's theory could not account for aberration when materials with a non-vacuum <a href="index%20of%20refraction">index of refraction</a> were present. An important example is of a telescope filled with water. The velocity of the light in such a telescope will be slower than in vacuum, and is given by formula_46 rather than formula_23 where formula_48 is the index of refraction of the water. Thus, by Bradley and Young's reasoning the aberration angle is given by

which predicts a medium-dependent angle of aberration. When refraction at the telescope's <a href="Objective%20%28optics%29">objective</a> is taken into account this result deviates even more from the vacuum result. In 1810 <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Arago">François Arago</a> performed a similar experiment and found that the aberration was unaffected by the medium in the telescope, providing solid evidence against Young's theory. This experiment was subsequently verified by many others in the following decades, most accurately by <a href="George%20Biddell%20Airy">Airy</a> in 1871, with the same result.

In 1818, <a href="Augustin%20Fresnel">Augustin Fresnel</a> developed a modified explanation to account for the water telescope and for other aberration phenomena. He explained that the aether is generally at rest in the Sun's frame of reference, but objects partially drag the aether along with them as they move. That is, the aether in an object of index of refraction formula_48 moving at velocity formula_4 is partially dragged with a velocity formula_52 bringing the light along with it. This factor is known as "Fresnel's dragging coefficient". This dragging effect, along with refraction at the telescope's objective, compensates for the slower speed of light in the water telescope in Bradley's explanation. With this modification Fresnel obtained Bradley's vacuum result even for non-vacuum telescopes, and was also able to predict many other phenomena related to the propagation of light in moving bodies. Fresnel's dragging coefficient became the dominant explanation of aberration for the next decades.

However, the fact that light is <a href="Polarization%20%28waves%29">polarized</a> (discovered by Fresnel himself) led scientists such as <a href="Augustin-Louis%20Cauchy">Cauchy</a> and <a href="George%20Green%20%28mathematician%29">Green</a> to believe that the aether was a totally immobile elastic solid as opposed to Fresnel's fluid aether. There was thus renewed need for an explanation of aberration consistent both with Fresnel's predictions (and Arago's observations) as well as polarization.

In 1845, <a href="Sir%20George%20Stokes%2C%201st%20Baronet">Stokes</a> proposed a 'putty-like' aether which acts as a liquid on large scales but as a solid on small scales, thus supporting both the transverse vibrations required for polarized light and the aether flow required to explain aberration. Making only the assumptions that the fluid is <a href="Potential%20flow">irrotational</a> and that the <a href="Boundary%20value%20problem">boundary conditions</a> of the flow are such that the aether has zero velocity far from the Earth, but moves at the Earth's velocity at its surface and within it, he was able to completely account for aberration.
The velocity of the aether outside of the Earth would decrease as a function of distance from the Earth so light rays from stars would be progressively dragged as they approached the surface of the Earth. The Earth's motion would be unaffected by the aether due to <a href="D%27Alembert%27s%20paradox">D'Alembert's paradox</a>.

Both Fresnel and Stokes' theories were popular. However, the question of aberration was put aside during much of the second half of the 19th century as focus of inquiry turned to the electromagnetic properties of aether.

In the 1880s once electromagnetism was better understood, interest turned again to the problem of aberration. By this time flaws were known to both Fresnel's and Stokes' theories. Fresnel's theory required that the relative velocity of aether and matter to be different for light of different colors, and it was shown that the boundary conditions Stokes had assumed in his theory were inconsistent with his assumption of irrotational flow. At the same time, the modern theories of electromagnetic aether could not account for aberration at all. Many scientists such as <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell">Maxwell</a>, <a href="Oliver%20Heaviside">Heaviside</a> and <a href="Heinrich%20Hertz">Hertz</a> unsuccessfully attempted to solve these problems by incorporating either Fresnel or Stokes' theories into <a href="Maxwell%27s%20equations">Maxwell's new electromagnetic laws</a>.

Hendrik Lorentz spent considerable effort along these lines. After working on this problem for a decade, the issues with Stokes' theory caused him to abandon it and to follow Fresnel's suggestion of a (mostly) stationary aether (1892, 1895). However, in Lorentz's model the aether was "completely" immobile, like the electromagnetic aethers of Cauchy, Green and Maxwell and unlike Fresnel's aether. He obtained Fresnel's dragging coefficient from modifications of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, including a modification of the time coordinates in moving frames ("local time"). In order to explain the <a href="Michelson%E2%80%93Morley%20experiment">Michelson–Morley experiment</a> (1887), which apparently contradicted both Fresnel's and Lorentz's immobile aether theories, and apparently confirmed Stokes' complete aether drag, Lorentz theorized (1892) that objects undergo "<a href="length%20contraction">length contraction</a>" by a factor of formula_53 in the direction of their motion through the aether. In this way, aberration (and all related optical phenomena) can be accounted for in the context of an immobile aether. Lorentz' theory became the basis for much research in the next decade, and beyond. Its predictions for aberration are identical to those of the relativistic theory.

Lorentz' theory matched experiment well, but it was complicated and made many unsubstantiated physical assumptions about the microscopic nature of electromagnetic media. In his 1905 theory of special relativity, Albert Einstein reinterpreted the results of Lorentz' theory in a much simpler and more natural conceptual framework which disposed of the idea of an aether. His derivation is given <a href="Aberration_of_light%23Relativistic_explanation">above</a>, and is now the accepted explanation. <a href="Robert%20S.%20Shankland">Robert S. Shankland</a> reported some conversations with Einstein, in which Einstein emphasized the importance of aberration:

Other important motivations for Einstein's development of relativity were the <a href="moving%20magnet%20and%20conductor%20problem">moving magnet and conductor problem</a> and (indirectly) the negative aether drift experiments, already mentioned by him in the introduction of his first relativity paper. Einstein wrote in a note in 1952:

While Einstein's result is the same as Bradley's original equation except for an extra factor of formula_54, it should be emphasized that Bradley's result does not merely give the classical limit of the relativistic case, in the sense that it gives incorrect predictions even at low relative velocities. Bradley's explanation cannot account for situations such as the water telescope, nor for many other optical effects (such as interference) that might occur within the telescope. This is because in the Earth's frame it predicts that the direction of propagation of the light beam in the telescope is not normal to the wavefronts of the beam, in contradiction with <a href="Maxwell%27s%20theory%20of%20electromagnetism">Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism</a>. It also does not preserve the speed of light c between frames. However, Bradley did correctly infer that the effect was due to relative velocities.

Optical aberration

Aberration in <a href="optics">optics</a> refers to a defect in a <a href="lens">lens</a> such that <a href="light">light</a> is not focussed to a point, but is spread out over some region of space, 
and hence an image formed by a lens with aberration is blurred or distorted, with the nature of the distortion depending on the type of abberation.
More specifically, it can be defined as a departure of the performance of an optical system from the predictions of <a href="paraxial%20optics">paraxial optics</a>. In an imaging system, it occurs when light from one point of an object does not converge into (or does not diverge from) a single point after transmission through the system. Aberrations occur because the simple paraxial theory is not a completely accurate model of the effect of an optical system on light, rather than due to flaws in the optical elements.

An image-forming optical system with aberration will produce an image which is not sharp. Makers of <a href="optical%20instruments">optical instruments</a> need to correct optical systems to compensate for aberration.

Abberation can be analyzed with the techniques of <a href="geometrical%20optics">geometrical optics</a>. The articles on <a href="Reflection%20%28physics%29">reflection</a>, <a href="refraction">refraction</a> and <a href="caustic%20%28optics%29">caustics</a> discuss the general features of reflected and refracted <a href="ray%20%28optics%29">rays</a>.

In an ideal <a href="lens">lens</a>, light from any point of an image will come to a focus on a single point at the <a href="focal%20plane">focal plane</a> (or, in the more general case, the focal surface, which need not be a plane). Deviations from this ideality, lenses in which light does not focus to a single point, are called "abberation" of the lens.

Aberrations fall into two classes: "monochromatic" and "chromatic". Monochromatic aberrations are caused by the geometry of the lens or mirror and occur both when light is reflected and when it is refracted. They appear even when using <a href="monochromatic%20light">monochromatic light</a>, hence the name.

<a href="Chromatic%20aberration">Chromatic aberration</a>s are caused by <a href="dispersion%20%28optics%29">dispersion</a>, the variation of a <a href="lens%20%28optics%29">lens's</a> <a href="refractive%20index">refractive index</a> with <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> means that the focus will be different for different wavelengths of light. Thus, chromatic abberation does not appear when monochromatic light is used.

The most common monochromatic aberrations are:


Although defocus is technically the lowest-order of the optical aberrations, it is usually not considered as a lens aberration, since it can be corrected by moving the lens (or the image plane) to bring the image plane to the optical focus of the lens. 

In addition to these abberations, <a href="Piston%20%28optics%29">piston</a> and <a href="Tilt%20%28optics%29">tilt</a> are effects which shift the position of the focal point. Piston and tilt are not true optical aberrations, since when an otherwise perfect wavefront is altered by piston and tilt, it will still form a perfect, aberration-free image, only shifted to a different position. 

Chromatic aberration occurs when different wavelengths are not focussed to the same point. Types of chromatic aberration are:

The elementary theory of optical systems leads to the theorem: Rays of light proceeding from any "object point" unite in an "image point"; and therefore an "object space" is reproduced in an "image space." The introduction of simple auxiliary terms, due to <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Gauss">C. F. Gauss</a> ("Dioptrische Untersuchungen", Göttingen, 1841), named the <a href="focal%20length">focal length</a>s and <a href="focal%20plane">focal plane</a>s, permits the determination of the image of any object for any system (see <a href="Lens%20%28optics%29">lens</a>). The Gaussian theory, however, is only true so long as the angles made by all rays with the optical axis (the symmetrical axis of the system) are infinitely small, i.e. with infinitesimal objects, images and lenses; in practice these conditions may not be realized, and the images projected by uncorrected systems are, in general, ill-defined and often completely blurred, if the aperture or field of view exceeds certain limits.

The investigations of <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell">James Clerk Maxwell</a> ("Phil.Mag.," 1856; "Quart. Journ. Math.," 1858) and <a href="Ernst%20Abbe">Ernst Abbe</a> showed that the properties of these reproductions, i.e. the relative position and magnitude of the images, are not special properties of optical systems, but necessary consequences of the supposition (in Abbe) of the reproduction of all points of a space in image points (Maxwell assumes a less general hypothesis), and are independent of the manner in which the reproduction is effected. These authors proved, however, that no optical system can justify these suppositions, since they are contradictory to the fundamental laws of reflection and refraction. Consequently, the Gaussian theory only supplies a convenient method of approximating to reality; and no constructor would attempt to realize this unattainable ideal. At present, all that can be attempted is to reproduce a single plane in another plane; but even this has not been altogether satisfactorily accomplished: aberrations always occur, and it is improbable that these will ever be entirely corrected.

This, and related general questions, have been treated — besides the above-mentioned authors — by M. Thiesen ("Berlin. Akad. Sitzber.," 1890, xxxv. 799; "Berlin. Phys. Ges. Verh.," 1892) and H. Bruns ("Leipzig. Math. Phys. Ber.," 1895, xxi. 325) by means of Sir W. R. Hamilton's "characteristic function" (Irish Acad. Trans., "Theory of Systems of Rays", 1828, et seq.). Reference may also be made to the treatise of Czapski-Eppenstein, pp. 155–161.

A review of the simplest cases of aberration will now be given.

Let S (fig. 1) be any optical system, rays proceeding from an axis point O under an angle u1 will unite in the axis point O'1; and those under an angle u2 in the axis point O'2. If there is refraction at a collective spherical surface, or through a thin positive lens, O'2 will lie in front of O'1 so long as the angle u2 is greater than u1 ("under correction"); and conversely with a dispersive surface or lenses ("over correction"). The caustic, in the first case, resembles the sign > (greater than); in the second < (less than). If the angle u1 is very small, O'1 is the Gaussian image; and O'1 O'2 is termed the "longitudinal aberration," and O'1R the "lateral aberration" of the <a href="Pencil%20%28physics%29">pencils</a> with aperture u2. If the pencil with the angle u2 is that of the maximum aberration of all the pencils transmitted, then in a plane perpendicular to the axis at O'1 there is a circular "disk of confusion" of radius O'1R, and in a parallel plane at O'2 another one of radius O'2R2; between these two is situated the "disk of least confusion."

The largest opening of the pencils, which take part in the reproduction of O, i.e. the angle u, is generally determined by the margin of one of the lenses or by a hole in a thin plate placed between, before, or behind the lenses of the system. This hole is termed the "stop" or "diaphragm"; Abbe used the term "<a href="aperture">aperture</a> stop" for both the hole and the limiting margin of the lens. The component S1 of the system, situated between the aperture stop and the object O, projects an image of the diaphragm, termed by Abbe the "entrance pupil"; the "exit pupil" is the image formed by the component S2, which is placed behind the aperture stop. All rays which issue from O and pass through the aperture stop also pass through the entrance and exit pupils, since these are images of the aperture stop. Since the maximum aperture of the pencils issuing from O is the angle u subtended by the entrance pupil at this point, the magnitude of the aberration will be determined by the position and diameter of the entrance pupil. If the system be entirely behind the aperture stop, then this is itself the entrance pupil ("front stop"); if entirely in front, it is the exit pupil ("back stop").

If the object point be infinitely distant, all rays received by the first member of the system are parallel, and their intersections, after traversing the system, vary according to their "perpendicular height of incidence," i.e. their distance from the axis. This distance replaces the angle u in the preceding considerations; and the aperture, i.e. the radius of the entrance pupil, is its maximum value.

If rays issuing from O (fig. 1) be concurrent, it does not follow that points in a portion of a plane perpendicular at O to the axis will be also concurrent, even if the part of the plane be very small. With a considerable aperture, the neighboring point N will be reproduced, but attended by aberrations comparable in magnitude to ON. These aberrations are avoided if, according to Abbe, the "sine condition," sin u'1/sin u1=sin u'2/sin u2, holds for all rays reproducing the point O. If the object point O is infinitely distant, u1 and u2 are to be replaced by h1 and h2, the perpendicular heights of incidence; the "sine condition" then becomes sin u'1/h1=sin u'2/h2. A system fulfilling this condition and free from spherical aberration is called "aplanatic" (Greek a-, privative, plann, a wandering). This word was first used by <a href="Robert%20Blair%20%28astronomer%29">Robert Blair</a> (d. 1828), professor of practical astronomy at Edinburgh University, to characterize a superior achromatism, and, subsequently, by many writers to denote freedom from spherical aberration. Both the aberration of axis points, and the deviation from the sine condition, rapidly increase in most (uncorrected) systems with the aperture.

A point O (fig. 2) at a finite distance from the axis (or with an infinitely distant object, a point which subtends a finite angle at the system) is, in general, even then not sharply reproduced if the pencil of rays issuing from it and traversing the system is made infinitely narrow by reducing the aperture stop; such a pencil consists of the rays which can pass from the object point through the now infinitely small entrance pupil. It is seen (ignoring exceptional cases) that the pencil does not meet the refracting or reflecting surface at right angles; therefore it is astigmatic (Gr. a-, privative, stigmia, a point). Naming the central ray passing through the entrance pupil the "axis of the pencil" or "principal ray," it can be said: the rays of the pencil intersect, not in one point, but in two focal lines, which can be assumed to be at right angles to the principal ray; of these, one lies in the plane containing the principal ray and the axis of the system, i.e. in the "first principal section" or "meridional section", and the other at right angles to it, i.e. in the second principal section or sagittal section. We receive, therefore, in no single intercepting plane behind the system, as, for example, a focusing screen, an image of the object point; on the other hand, in each of two planes lines O' and O" are separately formed (in neighboring planes ellipses are formed), and in a plane between O' and O" a circle of least confusion. The interval O'O", termed the astigmatic difference, increases, in general, with the angle W made by the principal ray OP with the axis of the system, i.e. with the field of view. Two "astigmatic image surfaces" correspond to one object plane; and these are in contact at the axis point; on the one lie the focal lines of the first kind, on the other those of the second. Systems in which the two astigmatic surfaces coincide are termed anastigmatic or stigmatic.

<a href="Isaac%20Newton">Sir Isaac Newton</a> was probably the discoverer of astigmation; the position of the astigmatic image lines was determined by Thomas Young ("A Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy," 1807); and the theory was developed by <a href="Allvar%20Gullstrand">Allvar Gullstrand</a>. A bibliography by P. Culmann is given in Moritz von Rohr's "Die Bilderzeugung in optischen Instrumenten".

By opening the stop wider, similar deviations arise for lateral points as have been already discussed for axial points; but in this case they are much more complicated. The course of the rays in the meridional section is no longer symmetrical to the principal ray of the pencil; and on an intercepting plane there appears, instead of a luminous point, a patch of light, not symmetrical about a point, and often exhibiting a resemblance to a comet having its tail directed towards or away from the axis. From this appearance it takes its name. The unsymmetrical form of the meridional pencil—formerly the only one considered—is <a href="coma%20%28optics%29">coma</a> in the narrower sense only; other errors of coma have been treated by <a href="Arthur%20K%C3%B6nig">Arthur König</a> and Moritz von Rohr, and later by Allvar Gullstrand.

If the above errors be eliminated, the two astigmatic surfaces united, and a sharp image obtained with a wide aperture—there remains the necessity to correct the curvature of the image surface, especially when the image is to be received upon a plane surface, e.g. in photography. In most cases the surface is concave towards the system.

Even if the image is sharp, it may be distorted compared to ideal <a href="pinhole%20projection">pinhole projection</a>. In pinhole projection, the magnification of an object is inversely proportional to its distance to the camera along the optical axis so that a camera pointing directly at a flat surface reproduces that flat surface. Distortion can be thought of as stretching the image non-uniformly, or, equivalently, as a variation in magnification across the field. While "distortion" can include arbitrary deformation of an image, the most pronounced modes of distortion produced by conventional imaging optics is "barrel distortion", in which the center of the image is magnified more than the perimeter (figure 3a). The reverse, in which the perimeter is magnified more than the center, is known as "pincushion distortion" (figure 3b). This effect is called lens distortion or <a href="image%20distortion">image distortion</a>, and there are <a href="http%3A//www.vassg.hu/pdf/vass_gg_2003_lo.pdf">algorithms</a> to correct it.

Systems free of distortion are called "orthoscopic" (orthos, right, skopein to look) or "rectilinear" (straight lines).
This aberration is quite distinct from that of the sharpness of reproduction; in unsharp, reproduction, the question of distortion arises if only parts of the object can be recognized in the figure. If, in an unsharp image, a patch of light corresponds to an object point, the "center of gravity" of the patch may be regarded as the image point, this being the point where the plane receiving the image, e.g., a focusing screen, intersects the ray passing through the middle of the stop. This assumption is justified if a poor image on the focusing screen remains stationary when the aperture is diminished; in practice, this generally occurs. This ray, named by Abbe a "principal ray" (not to be confused with the "principal rays" of the Gaussian theory), passes through the center of the entrance pupil before the first refraction, and the center of the exit pupil after the last refraction. From this it follows that correctness of drawing depends solely upon the principal rays; and is independent of the sharpness or curvature of the image field. Referring to fig. 4, we have O'Q'/OQ = a' tan w'/a tan w = 1/N, where N is the "scale" or magnification of the image. For N to be constant for all values of w, a' tan w'/a tan w must also be constant. If the ratio a'/a be sufficiently constant, as is often the case, the above relation reduces to the "condition of <a href="George%20Biddell%20Airy">Airy</a>," i.e. tan w'/ tan w= a constant. This simple relation (see Camb. Phil. Trans., 1830, 3, p. 1) is fulfilled in all systems which are symmetrical with respect to their diaphragm (briefly named "symmetrical or holosymmetrical objectives"), or which consist of two like, but different-sized, components, placed from the diaphragm in the ratio of their size, and presenting the same curvature to it (hemisymmetrical objectives); in these systems tan w' / tan w = 1.

The constancy of a'/a necessary for this relation to hold was pointed out by R. H. Bow (Brit. Journ. Photog., 1861), and Thomas Sutton (Photographic Notes, 1862); it has been treated by O. Lummer and by M. von Rohr (Zeit. f. Instrumentenk., 1897, 17, and 1898, 18, p. 4). It requires the middle of the aperture stop to be reproduced in the centers of the entrance and exit pupils without spherical aberration. M. von Rohr showed that for systems fulfilling neither the Airy nor the Bow-Sutton condition, the ratio a' cos w'/a tan w will be constant for one distance of the object. This combined condition is exactly fulfilled by holosymmetrical objectives reproducing with the scale 1, and by hemisymmetrical, if the scale of reproduction be equal to the ratio of the sizes of the two components.

Circular wavefront profiles associated with aberrations may be mathematically modeled using <a href="Zernike%20polynomial">Zernike polynomial</a>s. Developed by <a href="Frits%20Zernike">Frits Zernike</a> in the 1930s, Zernike's polynomials are <a href="orthogonal">orthogonal</a> over a circle of unit radius. A complex, aberrated wavefront profile may be <a href="curve-fitted">curve-fitted</a> with Zernike polynomials to yield a set of fitting <a href="coefficient">coefficient</a>s that individually represent different types of aberrations. These Zernike coefficients are <a href="linearly%20independent">linearly independent</a>, thus individual aberration contributions to an overall wavefront may be isolated and quantified separately.

There are <a href="even%20and%20odd%20functions">even and odd</a> Zernike polynomials. The even Zernike polynomials are defined as

and the odd Zernike polynomials as

where "m" and "n" are nonnegative <a href="integer">integer</a>s with formula_3, Φ is the <a href="azimuth">azimuth</a>al <a href="angle">angle</a> in <a href="radian">radian</a>s, and ρ is the normalized radial distance. The radial polynomials formula_4 have no azimuthal dependence, and are defined as

and formula_6 if formula_7 is odd.

The first few Zernike polynomials are:
where formula_8 is the normalized pupil radius with formula_9, formula_10 is the azimuthal angle around the pupil with formula_11, and the fitting coefficients formula_12 are the wavefront errors in wavelengths.

As in <a href="Fourier%20analysis">Fourier</a> synthesis using <a href="sine">sine</a>s and <a href="cosine">cosine</a>s, a wavefront may be perfectly represented by a sufficiently large number of higher-order Zernike polynomials. However, wavefronts with very steep <a href="gradients">gradients</a> or very high <a href="spatial%20frequency">spatial frequency</a> structure, such as produced by <a href="Wave%20propagation">propagation</a> through <a href="atmospheric%20turbulence">atmospheric turbulence</a> or <a href="turbulence">aerodynamic flowfields</a>, are not well modeled by Zernike polynomials, which tend to <a href="low-pass%20filter">low-pass filter</a> fine <a href="Three-dimensional%20space">spatial</a> definition in the wavefront. In this case, other fitting methods such as <a href="fractals">fractals</a> or <a href="singular%20value%20decomposition">singular value decomposition</a> may yield improved fitting results.

The <a href="Zernike%20polynomials">circle polynomials</a> were introduced by <a href="Frits%20Zernike">Frits Zernike</a> to evaluate the point image of an aberrated optical system taking into account the effects of <a href="diffraction">diffraction</a>. The perfect point image in the presence of diffraction had already been described by <a href="George%20Biddell%20Airy">Airy</a>, as early as 1835. It took almost hundred years to arrive at a comprehensive theory and modeling of the point image of aberrated systems (Zernike and Nijboer). The analysis by Nijboer and Zernike describes the intensity distribution close to the optimum focal plane. An extended theory that allows the calculation of the point image amplitude and intensity over a much larger volume in the focal region was recently developed (<a href="http%3A//www.nijboerzernike.nl">Extended Nijboer-Zernike theory</a>). This Extended Nijboer-Zernike theory of point image or ‘point-spread function’ formation has found applications in general research on image formation, especially for systems with a high <a href="numerical%20aperture">numerical aperture</a>, and in characterizing optical systems with respect to their aberrations.

The preceding review of the several errors of reproduction belongs to the "Abbe theory of aberrations," in which definite aberrations are discussed separately; it is well suited to practical needs, for in the construction of an optical instrument certain errors are sought to be eliminated, the selection of which is justified by experience. In the mathematical sense, however, this selection is arbitrary; the reproduction of a finite object with a finite aperture entails, in all probability, an infinite number of aberrations. This number is only finite if the object and aperture are assumed to be "infinitely small of a certain order"; and with each order of infinite smallness, i.e. with each degree of approximation to reality (to finite objects and apertures), a certain number of aberrations is associated. This connection is only supplied by theories which treat aberrations generally and analytically by means of indefinite series.

A ray proceeding from an object point O (fig. 5) can be defined by the coordinates (ξ, η). Of this point O in an object plane I, at right angles to the axis, and two other coordinates (x, y), the point in which the ray intersects the entrance pupil, i.e. the plane II. Similarly the corresponding image ray may be defined by the points (ξ', η'), and (x', y'), in the planes I' and II'. The origins of these four plane coordinate systems may be collinear with the axis of the optical system; and the corresponding axes may be parallel. Each of the four coordinates ξ', η', x', y' are functions of ξ, η, x, y; and if it be assumed that the field of view and the aperture be infinitely small, then ξ, η, x, y are of the same order of infinitesimals; consequently by expanding ξ', η', x', y' in ascending powers of ξ, η, x, y, series are obtained in which it is only necessary to consider the lowest powers. It is readily seen that if the optical system be symmetrical, the origins of the coordinate systems collinear with the optical axis and the corresponding axes parallel, then by changing the signs of ξ, η, x, y, the values ξ', η', x', y' must likewise change their sign, but retain their arithmetical values; this means that the series are restricted to odd powers of the unmarked variables.

The nature of the reproduction consists in the rays proceeding from a point O being united in another point O'; in general, this will not be the case, for ξ', η' vary if ξ, η be constant, but x, y variable. It may be assumed that the planes I' and II' are drawn where the images of the planes I and II are formed by rays near the axis by the ordinary Gaussian rules; and by an extension of these rules, not, however, corresponding to reality, the Gauss image point O', with coordinates ξ', η', of the point O at some distance from the axis could be constructed. Writing Dξ'=ξ'-ξ' and Dη'=η'-η', then Dξ' and Dη' are the aberrations belonging to ξ, η and x, y, and are functions of these magnitudes which, when expanded in series, contain only odd powers, for the same reasons as given above. On account of the aberrations of all rays which pass through O, a patch of light, depending in size on the lowest powers of ξ, η, x, y which the aberrations contain, will be formed in the plane I'. These degrees, named by <a href="Jozef%20Maximili%C3%A1n%20Petzval">J. Petzval</a> ("Bericht uber die Ergebnisse einiger dioptrischer Untersuchungen", Buda Pesth, 1843; "Akad. Sitzber., Wien," 1857, vols. xxiv. xxvi.) "the numerical orders of the image," are consequently only odd powers; the condition for the formation of an image of the mth order is that in the series for Dξ' and Dη' the coefficients of the powers of the 3rd, 5th…(m-2)th degrees must vanish. The images of the Gauss theory being of the third order, the next problem is to obtain an image of 5th order, or to make the coefficients of the powers of 3rd degree zero. This necessitates the satisfying of five equations; in other words, there are five alterations of the 3rd order, the vanishing of which produces an image of the 5th order.

The expression for these coefficients in terms of the constants of the optical system, i.e. the radii, thicknesses, refractive indices and distances between the lenses, was solved by <a href="Philipp%20Ludwig%20von%20Seidel">L. Seidel</a> (Astr. Nach., 1856, p. 289); in 1840, J. Petzval constructed his portrait objective, from similar calculations which have never been published (see M. von Rohr, "Theorie und Geschichte des photographischen Objectivs", Berlin, 1899, p. 248). The theory was elaborated by S. Finterswalder (Munchen. Acad. Abhandl., 1891, 17, p. 519), who also published a posthumous paper of Seidel containing a short view of his work ("München. Akad. Sitzber.," 1898, 28, p. 395); a simpler form was given by A. Kerber ("Beiträge zur Dioptrik", Leipzig, 1895-6-7-8-9). A. Konig and M. von Rohr (see M. von Rohr, "Die Bilderzeugung in optischen Instrumenten", pp. 317–323) have represented Kerber's method, and have deduced the Seidel formulae from geometrical considerations based on the Abbe method, and have interpreted the analytical results geometrically (pp. 212–316).

The aberrations can also be expressed by means of the "characteristic function" of the system and its differential coefficients, instead of by the radii, &c., of the lenses; these formulae are not immediately applicable, but give, however, the relation between the number of aberrations and the order. Sir William Rowan Hamilton (British Assoc. Report, 1833, p. 360) thus derived the aberrations of the third order; and in later times the method was pursued by Clerk Maxwell ("Proc. London Math. Soc.," 1874–1875; (see also the treatises of R. S. Heath and L. A. Herman), M. Thiesen ("Berlin. Akad. Sitzber.," 1890, 35, p. 804), H. Bruns ("Leipzig. Math. Phys. Ber.," 1895, 21, p. 410), and particularly successfully by K. Schwarzschild ("Göttingen. Akad. Abhandl.," 1905, 4, No. 1), who thus discovered the aberrations of the 5th order (of which there are nine), and possibly the shortest proof of the practical (Seidel) formulae. A. Gullstrand (vide supra, and "Ann. d. Phys.," 1905, 18, p. 941) founded his theory of aberrations on the differential geometry of surfaces.

The aberrations of the third order are: (1) aberration of the axis point; (2) aberration of points whose distance from the axis is very small, less than of the third order — the deviation from the sine condition and coma here fall together in one class; (3) astigmatism; (4) curvature of the field; (5) distortion.

The classical imaging problem is to reproduce perfectly a finite plane (the object) onto another plane (the image) through a finite aperture. It is impossible to do so perfectly for "more than one" such pair of planes (this was proven with increasing generality by <a href="James%20Clerk%20Maxwell">Maxwell</a> in 1858, by Bruns in 1895, and by <a href="Constantin%20Carath%C3%A9odory">Carathéodory</a> in 1926, see summary in Walther, A., J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 6, 415–422 (1989)). For a single pair of planes (e.g. for a single focus setting of an objective), however, the problem can in principle be solved perfectly. Examples of such a theoretically perfect system include the <a href="Luneburg%20lens">Luneburg lens</a> and the <a href="Maxwell%20fish-eye">Maxwell fish-eye</a>.

Practical methods solve this problem with an accuracy which mostly suffices for the special purpose of each species of instrument. The problem of finding a system which reproduces a given object upon a given plane with given magnification (insofar as aberrations must be taken into account) could be dealt with by means of the approximation theory; in most cases, however, the analytical difficulties were too great for older calculation methods but may be ameliorated by application of modern computer systems. Solutions, however, have been obtained in special cases (see A. Konig in M. von Rohr's "Die Bilderzeugung", p. 373; K. Schwarzschild, Göttingen. Akad. Abhandl., 1905, 4, Nos. 2 and 3). At the present time constructors almost always employ the inverse method: they compose a system from certain, often quite personal experiences, and test, by the trigonometrical calculation of the paths of several rays, whether the system gives the desired reproduction (examples are given in A. Gleichen, "Lehrbuch der geometrischen Optik", Leipzig and Berlin, 1902). The radii, thicknesses and distances are continually altered until the errors of the image become sufficiently small. By this method only certain errors of reproduction are investigated, especially individual members, or all, of those named above. The analytical approximation theory is often employed provisionally, since its accuracy does not generally suffice.

In order to render spherical aberration and the deviation from the sine condition small throughout the whole aperture, there is given to a ray with a finite angle of aperture u* (width infinitely distant objects: with a finite height of incidence h*) the same distance of intersection, and the same sine ratio as to one neighboring the axis (u* or h* may not be much smaller than the largest aperture U or H to be used in the system). The rays with an angle of aperture smaller than u* would not have the same distance of intersection and the same sine ratio; these deviations are called "zones," and the constructor endeavors to reduce these to a minimum. The same holds for the errors depending upon the angle of the field of view, w: astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion are eliminated for a definite value, w*, "zones of astigmatism, curvature of field and distortion," attend smaller values of w. The practical optician names such systems: "corrected for the angle of aperture u* (the height of incidence h*) or the angle of field of view w*." Spherical aberration and changes of the sine ratios are often represented graphically as functions of the aperture, in the same way as the deviations of two astigmatic image surfaces of the image plane of the axis point are represented as functions of the angles of the field of view.

The final form of a practical system consequently rests on compromise; enlargement of the aperture results in a diminution of the available field of view, and vice versa. But the larger aperture will give the larger resolution. The following may be regarded as typical:

In optical systems composed of lenses, the position, magnitude and errors of the image depend upon the refractive indices of the glass employed (see <a href="Lens%20%28optics%29">Lens (optics)</a> and <a href="%23Monochromatic%20aberration">Monochromatic aberration</a>, above). Since the index of refraction varies with the color or wavelength of the light (see <a href="dispersion%20%28optics%29">dispersion</a>), it follows that a system of lenses (uncorrected) projects images of different colors in somewhat different places and sizes and with different aberrations; i.e. there are "chromatic differences" of the distances of intersection, of magnifications, and of monochromatic aberrations. If mixed light be employed (e.g. white light) all these images are formed and they cause a confusion, named chromatic aberration; for instance, instead of a white margin on a dark background, there is perceived a colored margin, or narrow spectrum. The absence of this error is termed achromatism, and an optical system so corrected is termed achromatic. A system is said to be "chromatically under-corrected" when it shows the same kind of chromatic error as a thin positive lens, otherwise it is said to be "overcorrected."

If, in the first place, monochromatic aberrations be neglected — in other words, the Gaussian theory be accepted — then every reproduction is determined by the positions of the focal planes, and the magnitude of the focal lengths, or if the focal lengths, as ordinarily happens, be equal, by three constants of reproduction. These constants are determined by the data of the system (radii, thicknesses, distances, indices, etc., of the lenses); therefore their dependence on the refractive index, and consequently on the color, are calculable. The refractive indices for different wavelengths must be known for each kind of glass made use of. In this manner the conditions are maintained that any one constant of reproduction is equal for two different colors, i.e. this constant is achromatized. For example, it is possible, with one thick lens in air, to achromatize the position of a focal plane of the magnitude of the focal length. If all three constants of reproduction be achromatized, then the Gaussian image for all distances of objects is the same for the two colors, and the system is said to be in "stable achromatism."

In practice it is more advantageous (after Abbe) to determine the chromatic aberration (for instance, that of the distance of intersection) for a fixed position of the object, and express it by a sum in which each component conlins the amount due to each refracting surface. In a plane containing the image point of one color, another colour produces a disk of confusion; this is similar to the confusion caused by two "zones" in spherical aberration. For infinitely distant objects the radius Of the chromatic disk of confusion is proportional to the linear aperture, and independent of the focal length ("vide supra", "Monochromatic Aberration of the Axis Point"); and since this disk becomes the less harmful with an increasing image of a given object, or with increasing focal length, it follows that the deterioration of the image is proportional to the ratio of the aperture to the focal length, i.e. the "relative aperture." (This explains the gigantic focal lengths in vogue before the discovery of achromatism.)

Examples:

Newton failed to perceive the existence of media of different dispersive powers required by achromatism; consequently he constructed large reflectors instead of refractors. James Gregory and Leonhard Euler arrived at the correct view from a false conception of the achromatism of the eye; this was determined by Chester More Hall in 1728, Klingenstierna in 1754 and by Dollond in 1757, who constructed the celebrated achromatic telescopes. (See <a href="telescope">telescope</a>.)

Glass with weaker dispersive power (greater formula_43) is named "<a href="Crown%20glass%20%28optics%29">crown glass</a>"; that with greater dispersive power, "<a href="flint%20glass">flint glass</a>". For the construction of an achromatic collective lens (formula_15 positive) it follows, by means of equation (4), that a collective lens I. of crown glass and a dispersive lens II. of flint glass must be chosen; the latter, although the weaker, corrects the other chromatically by its greater dispersive power. For an achromatic dispersive lens the converse must be adopted. This is, at the present day, the ordinary type, e.g., of telescope objective; the values of the four radii must satisfy the equations (2) and (4). Two other conditions may also be postulated: one is always the elimination of the aberration on the axis; the second either the "Herschel" or "Fraunhofer Condition," the latter being the best vide supra, "Monochromatic Aberration"). In practice, however, it is often more useful to avoid the second condition by making the lenses have contact, i.e. equal radii. According to P. Rudolph (Eder's Jahrb. f. Photog., 1891, 5, p. 225; 1893, 7, p. 221), cemented objectives of thin lenses permit the elimination of spherical aberration on the axis, if, as above, the collective lens has a smaller refractive index; on the other hand, they permit the elimination of astigmatism and curvature of the field, if the collective lens has a greater refractive index (this follows from the Petzval equation; see L. Seidel, Astr. Nachr., 1856, p. 289). Should the cemented system be positive, then the more powerful lens must be positive; and, according to (4), to the greater power belongs the weaker dispersive power (greater formula_43), that is to say, crown glass; consequently the crown glass must have the greater refractive index for astigmatic and plane images. In all earlier kinds of glass, however, the dispersive power increased with the refractive index; that is, formula_43 decreased as formula_13 increased; but some of the Jena glasses by E. Abbe and O. Schott were crown glasses of high refractive index, and achromatic systems from such crown glasses, with flint glasses of lower refractive index, are called the "new achromats," and were employed by P. Rudolph in the first "anastigmats" (photographic objectives).

Instead of making formula_29 vanish, a certain value can be assigned to it which will produce, by the addition of the two lenses, any desired chromatic deviation, e.g. sufficient to eliminate one present in other parts of the system. If the lenses I. and II. be cemented and have the same refractive index for one color, then its effect for that one color is that of a lens of one piece; by such decomposition of a lens it can be made chromatic or achromatic at will, without altering its spherical effect. If its chromatic effect (formula_49) be greater than that of the same lens, this being made of the more dispersive of the two glasses employed, it is termed "hyper-chromatic."

For two thin lenses separated by a distance formula_50 the condition for achromatism is formula_51; if formula_52 (e.g. if the lenses be made of the same glass), this reduces to formula_53, known as the "condition for oculars."

If a constant of reproduction, for instance the focal length, be made equal for two colors, then it is not the same for other colors, if two different glasses are employed. For example, the condition for achromatism (4) for two thin lenses in contact is fulfilled in only one part of the spectrum, since formula_54 varies within the spectrum. This fact was first ascertained by J. Fraunhofer, who defined the colors by means of the dark lines in the solar spectrum; and showed that the ratio of the dispersion of two glasses varied about 20% from the red to the violet (the variation for glass and water is about 50%). If, therefore, for two colors, a and b, formula_55, then for a third color, c, the focal length is different; that is, if c lies between a and b, then formula_56, and vice versa; these algebraic results follow from the fact that towards the red the dispersion of the positive crown glass preponderates, towards the violet that of the negative flint. These chromatic errors of systems, which are achromatic for two colors, are called the "secondary spectrum," and depend upon the aperture and focal length in the same manner as the primary chromatic errors do.

In fig. 6, taken from M. von Rohr's "Theorie und Geschichte des photographischen Objectivs", the abscissae are focal lengths, and the ordinates wavelengths. The <a href="Fraunhofer%20line">Fraunhofer line</a>s used are shown in adjacent table.

The focal lengths are made equal for the lines C and F. In the neighborhood of 550 nm the tangent to the curve is parallel to the axis of wavelengths; and the focal length varies least over a fairly large range of color, therefore in this neighborhood the color union is at its best. Moreover, this region of the spectrum is that which appears brightest to the human eye, and consequently this curve of the secondary on spectrum, obtained by making formula_57, is, according to the experiments of Sir G. G. Stokes (Proc. Roy. Soc., 1878), the most suitable for visual instruments ("optical achromatism,"). In a similar manner, for systems used in photography, the vertex of the color curve must be placed in the position of the maximum sensibility of the plates; this is generally supposed to be at G'; and to accomplish this the F and violet mercury lines are united. This artifice is specially adopted in objectives for astronomical photography ("pure actinic achromatism"). For ordinary photography, however, there is this disadvantage: the image on the focusing-screen and the correct adjustment of the photographic sensitive plate are not in register; in astronomical photography this difference is constant, but in other kinds it depends on the distance of the objects. On this account the lines D and G' are united for ordinary photographic objectives; the optical as well as the actinic image is chromatically inferior, but both lie in the same place; and consequently the best correction lies in F (this is known as the "actinic correction" or "freedom from chemical focus").

Should there be in two lenses in contact the same focal lengths for three colours a, b, and c, i.e. formula_58, then the relative partial dispersion formula_59 must be equal for the two kinds of glass employed. This follows by considering equation (4) for the two pairs of colors ac and bc. Until recently no glasses were known with a proportional degree of absorption; but R. Blair (Trans. Edin. Soc., 1791, 3, p. 3), P. Barlow, and F. S. Archer overcame the difficulty by constructing fluid lenses between glass walls. Fraunhofer prepared glasses which reduced the secondary spectrum; but permanent success was only assured on the introduction of the Jena glasses by E. Abbe and O. Schott. In using glasses not having proportional dispersion, the deviation of a third colour can be eliminated by two lenses, if an interval be allowed between them; or by three lenses in contact, which may not all consist of the old glasses. In uniting three colors an "achromatism of a higher order" is derived; there is yet a residual "tertiary spectrum," but it can always be neglected.

The Gaussian theory is only an approximation; monochromatic or spherical aberrations still occur, which will be different for different colors; and should they be compensated for one color, the image of another color would prove disturbing. The most important is the chromatic difference of aberration of the axis point, which is still present to disturb the image, after par-axial rays of different colors are united by an appropriate combination of glasses. If a collective system be corrected for the axis point for a definite wavelength, then, on account of the greater dispersion in the negative components — the flint glasses, — overcorrection will arise for the shorter wavelengths (this being the error of the negative components), and under-correction for the longer wavelengths (the error of crown glass lenses preponderating in the red). This error was treated by Jean le Rond d'Alembert, and, in special detail, by C. F. Gauss. It increases rapidly with the aperture, and is more important with medium apertures than the secondary spectrum of par-axial rays; consequently, spherical aberration must be eliminated for two colors, and if this be impossible, then it must be eliminated for those particular wavelengths which are most effectual for the instrument in question (a graphical representation of this error is given in M. von Rohr, "Theorie und Geschichte des photographischen Objectivs").

The condition for the reproduction of a surface element in the place of a sharply reproduced point — the constant of the sine relationship must also be fulfilled with large apertures for several colors. E. Abbe succeeded in computing microscope objectives free from error of the axis point and satisfying the sine condition for several colors, which therefore, according to his definition, were "aplanatic for several colors"; such systems he termed "<a href="apochromatic">apochromatic</a>". While, however, the magnification of the individual zones is the same, it is not the same for red as for blue; and there is a chromatic difference of magnification. This is produced in the same amount, but in the opposite sense, by the oculars, which Abbe used with these objectives ("compensating oculars"), so that it is eliminated in the image of the whole microscope. The best telescope objectives, and photographic objectives intended for three-color work, are also apochromatic, even if they do not possess quite the same quality of correction as microscope objectives do. The chromatic differences of other errors of reproduction have seldom practical importances.

Amy Lee Grant (born November 25, 1960) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, author and <a href="media%20personality">media personality</a>. She is known for performing <a href="contemporary%20Christian%20music">contemporary Christian music</a> (CCM) and for a successful crossover to pop music in the 1980s and 1990s. She has been referred to as "The Queen of Christian Pop".

, she had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide, won six <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s and 22 <a href="Gospel%20Music%20Association">Gospel Music Association</a> <a href="Dove%20Award">Dove Award</a>s, and had the first Christian album ever to go <a href="Platinum%20album">Platinum</a>. She was honored with a star on <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> in 2006 for her contributions to the entertainment industry. She made her debut as a teenager, and gained fame in <a href="Christian%20music">Christian music</a> during the 1980s with such hits as "Father's Eyes", "<a href="El%20Shaddai%20%28song%29">El Shaddai</a>", and "<a href="Angels%20%28Amy%20Grant%20song%29">Angels</a>". In the mid-1980s, she began broadening her audience and soon became one of the first <a href="Contemporary%20Christian%20music">CCM</a> artists to <a href="Crossover%20%28music%29">cross over</a> into mainstream pop on the heels of her successful albums "<a href="Unguarded%20%28Amy%20Grant%20album%29">Unguarded</a>" and "<a href="Lead%20Me%20On%20%28Amy%20Grant%20album%29">Lead Me On</a>". In 1986, she scored her first <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> No. 1 song in a duet with <a href="Peter%20Cetera">Peter Cetera</a>, "<a href="The%20Next%20Time%20I%20Fall">The Next Time I Fall</a>". In 1991, she released the blockbuster album "<a href="Heart%20in%20Motion">Heart in Motion</a>" which became her best-selling album to date, topping the "Billboard" Christian album chart for 32 weeks, selling five million copies in the U.S., and producing her second No. 1 pop single "<a href="Baby%20Baby%20%28Amy%20Grant%20song%29">Baby Baby</a>". She is the author of several books, including a memoir, "", and a book based on the popular Christmas song "<a href="Breath%20of%20Heaven%20%28Mary%27s%20Song%29">Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song)</a>" which she co-wrote.

Born in <a href="Augusta%2C%20Georgia">Augusta, Georgia</a>, Grant is the youngest of four sisters. Her family settled in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, in 1967. She is a great-granddaughter of Nashville philanthropist <a href="A.%20M.%20Burton">A. M. Burton</a> (founder of Life and Casualty Insurance Company, eponym of Nashville's <a href="Life%20%26amp%3B%20Casualty%20Tower">Life & Casualty Tower</a>, <a href="WLAC">WLAC</a> Radio, and <a href="WLAC-TV">WLAC-TV</a>) and Lillie Burton. She has acknowledged the influence of the Burtons on her development as a musician, starting with their common membership in Nashville's Ashwood <a href="Churches%20of%20Christ">Church of Christ</a>.

In 1976, Grant wrote her first song ("Mountain Man"), performed in public for the first time at <a href="Harpeth%20Hall%20School">Harpeth Hall School</a>, the all-girls school she attended in Nashville. She recorded a demo tape for her parents with church youth-leader <a href="Brown%20Bannister">Brown Bannister</a>. When Bannister was dubbing a copy of the tape, <a href="Chris%20Christian">Chris Christian</a>, the owner of the recording studio, heard the demo and called <a href="Word%20Records">Word Records</a>. He played it over the phone, and she was offered a recording contract, five weeks before her 16th birthday. In 1977, she recorded her first album titled "<a href="Amy%20Grant%20%28album%29">Amy Grant</a>", produced by Brown Bannister, who would also produce her next 11 albums. It was released in early 1978, one month before her high-school graduation. Toward the end of 1978 she performed her first ticketed concert after beginning her first year at <a href="Furman%20University">Furman University</a>. In May 1979, while at the album-release party for her second album, "<a href="My%20Father%27s%20Eyes%20%28album%29">My Father's Eyes</a>", Grant met <a href="Gary%20Chapman%20%28musician%29">Gary Chapman</a>, who had written the title track and would become her first husband. Grant and Chapman toured together in mid-1979. In late 1980, she transferred to <a href="Vanderbilt%20University">Vanderbilt University</a>, where she was a member of the sorority <a href="Kappa%20Alpha%20Theta">Kappa Alpha Theta</a>. Grant then made a few more albums before dropping out of college to pursue a career in music—"<a href="Never%20Alone%20%28album%29">Never Alone</a>", followed by a pair of live albums in 1981 ("<a href="In%20Concert%20%28Amy%20Grant%20album%29">In Concert</a>" and "<a href="In%20Concert%20Volume%20Two%20%28Amy%20Grant%20album%29">In Concert Volume Two</a>"), both backed by an augmented edition of the <a href="DeGarmo%20and%20Key">DeGarmo & Key</a> band. It was during these early shows that Grant also established one of her concert trademarks: performing barefoot. To date, Grant continues to take off her shoes midway through performances, as she has said "it is just more comfortable."

1982 saw the release of her breakthrough album "<a href="Age%20to%20Age">Age to Age</a>". The album contains the signature track, "<a href="El%20Shaddai%20%28song%29">El Shaddai</a>" (written by <a href="Michael%20Card">Michael Card</a>) and the Grant-Chapman penned song, "In a Little While". "El Shaddai" was later awarded one of the "<a href="Songs%20of%20the%20Century">Songs of the Century</a>" by the <a href="RIAA">RIAA</a> in 2001. Grant received her first <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> for Best Contemporary Gospel Performance, as well as two <a href="GMA%20Dove%20Awards">GMA Dove Awards</a> for Gospel Artist of the Year and Pop/Contemporary Album of the Year. "Age to Age" became the first Christian album by a solo artist to be certified gold (1983) and the first Christian album to be certified platinum (1985).

In the mid-1980s, Grant began touring and recording with young up-and-coming songwriter <a href="Michael%20W.%20Smith">Michael W. Smith</a>. Grant and Smith continue to have a strong friendship and creative relationship, often writing songs for or contributing vocals to each other's albums. During the 1980s, Grant was also a backup singer for <a href="Bill%20Gaither%20%28gospel%20singer%29">Bill Gaither</a>.

Grant followed this album with the first of her Christmas albums, which would later be the basis for her holiday shows. In 1984, she released another pop-oriented Christian hit, "<a href="Straight%20Ahead%20%28Amy%20Grant%20album%29">Straight Ahead</a>", earning Grant her first appearance at the <a href="Grammy%20Awards">Grammy Awards</a> show in 1985. The head of <a href="NBC">NBC</a> took notice of Grant's performance and called her manager to book her for her own Christmas special.

Hardly had Grant established herself as the "Queen of Christian Pop" when she changed directions to widen her fan base (and hence her musical message). Her goal was to become the first Christian singer-songwriter who was also successful as a contemporary pop singer. "<a href="Unguarded%20%28Amy%20Grant%20album%29">Unguarded</a>" (1985) surprised some fans for its very mainstream sound (and Grant's leopard-print jacket, in four poses for four different covers). "<a href="Find%20a%20Way%20%28Amy%20Grant%20song%29">Find a Way</a>", from "Unguarded", became the first non-Christmas Christian song to hit <a href="The%20Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Top 40</a> list, also reaching No. 7 on the <a href="Adult%20Contemporary">Adult Contemporary</a> chart. She also scored No. 18 on "Billboard" AC in 1986 with "<a href="Stay%20for%20Awhile">Stay for Awhile</a>". Grant scored her first "Billboard" No. 1 song in 1986 with "<a href="The%20Next%20Time%20I%20Fall">The Next Time I Fall</a>", a duet with former <a href="Chicago%20%28band%29">Chicago</a> singer/bassist <a href="Peter%20Cetera">Peter Cetera</a>. That year, she also recorded a duet with singer <a href="Randy%20Stonehill">Randy Stonehill</a> for his "<a href="Love%20Beyond%20Reason">Love Beyond Reason</a>" album, titled "I Could Never Say Goodbye", and recorded "The Animals' Christmas" with <a href="Art%20Garfunkel">Art Garfunkel</a>.

"<a href="Lead%20Me%20On%20%28Amy%20Grant%20album%29">Lead Me On</a>" (1988) contained many songs that were about Christianity and love relationships, but some interpreted it as not being an obviously "Christian" record. Years later, "Lead Me On" would be chosen as the greatest Contemporary Christian album of all time by "<a href="CCM%20Magazine">CCM Magazine</a>". The mainstream song "Saved by Love" was a minor hit, receiving airplay on radio stations featuring the newly emerging Adult Contemporary format. The album's title song received some pop radio airplay and <a href="Crossover%20%28music%29">crossed over</a> to No. 96 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, and "1974 (We Were Young)" and "Saved By Love" also charted as Adult Contemporary songs. In 1989, she appeared in a <a href="Target%20Corporation">Target</a> ad campaign, performing songs off the album.

When "<a href="Heart%20in%20Motion">Heart in Motion</a>" was released in 1991, many fans were surprised that the album was so clearly one of contemporary pop music. Grant's desire to widen her audience was frowned upon by the confines of the popular definitions of ministry at the time. The track "<a href="Baby%20Baby%20%28Amy%20Grant%20song%29">Baby Baby</a>" (written for Grant's newborn daughter Millie, whose "six-week-old face was my inspiration,") became a pop hit (hitting No. 1 on the "Billboard" Hot 100), and Grant was established as a name in the mainstream music world. "Baby Baby" received Grammy nominations for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Record and Song of the Year (although it failed to win in any of those categories). Four other hits from the album made the Pop top 20: "<a href="Every%20Heartbeat">Every Heartbeat</a>" (No. 2), "<a href="That%27s%20What%20Love%20Is%20For">That's What Love Is For</a>" (No. 7), "<a href="Good%20for%20Me%20%28song%29">Good for Me</a>" (No. 8), and "<a href="I%20Will%20Remember%20You%20%28Amy%20Grant%20song%29">I Will Remember You</a>" (No. 20). On the Adult Contemporary chart, all five songs were top 10 hits, with two of the five ("Baby Baby" and "That's What Love Is For") reaching No. 1. Many Christian fans remained loyal, putting the album atop "Billboard" Contemporary Christian Chart for 32 weeks. "Heart in Motion" is Grant's best-selling album, having sold over five million copies according to the RIAA. Grant followed the album with her second Christmas album, "<a href="Home%20For%20Christmas%20%28Amy%20Grant%20album%29">Home For Christmas</a>" in 1992, which included the song "<a href="Breath%20of%20Heaven%20%28Mary%27s%20Song%29">Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song)</a>", written by <a href="Chris%20Eaton%20%28UK%20musician%29">Chris Eaton</a> and Grant, and would later be covered by many artists, including <a href="Donna%20Summer">Donna Summer</a>, <a href="Jessica%20Simpson">Jessica Simpson</a> (who acknowledged Grant as one of her favorite artists), <a href="Vince%20Gill">Vince Gill</a>, <a href="Sara%20Groves">Sara Groves</a>, <a href="Point%20of%20Grace">Point of Grace</a>, <a href="Gladys%20Knight">Gladys Knight</a>, and Broadway star <a href="Barbara%20Cook">Barbara Cook</a>.

"<a href="House%20of%20Love%20%28Amy%20Grant%20album%29">House of Love</a>" in 1994 continued in the same vein, boasting catchy pop songs mingled with spiritual lyrics. The album was a multi-platinum success and produced the pop hit "<a href="Lucky%20One%20%28song%29">Lucky One</a>" (No. 18 pop and No. 2 AC; No. 1 on <a href="Radio%20%26amp%3B%20Records">Radio & Records</a>) as well as the title track (a duet with country music star and future husband <a href="Vince%20Gill">Vince Gill</a>) (No. 37 pop) and a cover of Joni Mitchell's frequently covered "<a href="Big%20Yellow%20Taxi">Big Yellow Taxi</a>" (No. 67 pop) (in which she changed the line "And they charged the people "a dollar and a half" just to see'em" to "And then they charged the people "25 bucks" just to see'em").

After she covered the <a href="10cc">10cc</a> song "<a href="The%20Things%20We%20Do%20for%20Love%20%28song%29">The Things We Do for Love</a>" for the "<a href="Mr.%20Wrong%20%28film%29">Mr. Wrong</a>" soundtrack, "<a href="Behind%20the%20Eyes%20%28Amy%20Grant%20album%29">Behind the Eyes</a>" was released in September 1997. The album struck a much darker note, leaning more towards downtempo, acoustic soft-rock songs, with more mature (yet still optimistic) lyrics. She called it her "razor blades and <a href="Prozac">Prozac</a>" album. Although "<a href="Takes%20a%20Little%20Time%20%28Amy%20Grant%20song%29">Takes a Little Time</a>" was a moderate hit single, the album failed to sell like the previous two albums, which had both gone multi-platinum. "Behind The Eyes" was eventually certified Gold by the <a href="RIAA">RIAA</a>. The video for "Takes a Little Time" was a new direction for Grant; with a blue light filter, acoustic guitar, the streets and characters of New York City, and a plot, Grant was re-cast as an adult light rocker. She followed up "Behind The Eyes" with "<a href="A%20Christmas%20To%20Remember">A Christmas To Remember</a>", her third Christmas album, in 1999. The album was certified Gold in 2000.

In 2001, Grant sang "<a href="God%20Bless%20America">God Bless America</a>" in front of a sellout crowd at the Owen County Fair Grounds in <a href="Spencer%2C%20Indiana">Spencer, Indiana</a>. She dedicated her performance to the victims of <a href="9/11">9/11</a>, and officially started the Demolition Derby. Following the 9/11 attacks, Grant's "<a href="I%20Will%20Remember%20You%20%28Amy%20Grant%20song%29">I Will Remember You</a>" saw a resurgence in popularity as many radio DJs mixed a special tribute version of the song. That same year, Grant won $125,000 for charity on the "Rock Star Edition" of "<a href="Who%20Wants%20to%20Be%20a%20Millionaire%3F">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a>"

Grant returned to her roots with the 2002 release of an album of <a href="hymns">hymns</a> titled "<a href="Legacy...%20Hymns%20and%20Faith">Legacy... Hymns and Faith</a>". The album featured a Vince Gill-influenced mix of <a href="Bluegrass%20music">bluegrass</a> and <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> and marked Grant's 25th anniversary in the music industry. Grant followed this up with "<a href="Simple%20Things%20%28Amy%20Grant%20album%29">Simple Things</a>" in 2003. The album did not have the success of her previous pop or gospel efforts. Soon after "Simple Things", Grant and <a href="Interscope">Interscope</a>/A&M parted ways. The same year, Grant was inducted into the <a href="Gospel%20Music%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Gospel Music Hall of Fame</a> by the <a href="Gospel%20Music%20Association">Gospel Music Association</a>, an industry trade organization of which she is a longstanding member, in her first year of eligibility. Grant released a sequel in 2005 titled "<a href="Rock%20of%20Ages...Hymns%20and%20Faith">Rock of Ages...Hymns and Faith</a>".

Grant joined the reality television phenomenon by hosting "<a href="Three%20Wishes%20%28TV%20series%29">Three Wishes</a>", a show in which she and a team of helpers make wishes come true for small-town residents. The show debuted on <a href="NBC">NBC</a> in the fall of 2005 but was canceled at the end of its first season because of high production costs. After "Three Wishes" was canceled, Grant won her 6th Grammy Award for "Rock of Ages... Hymns & Faith". In a February 2006 webchat, Grant stated she believes her "best music is still ahead".

In April 2006, a live CD/DVD titled "<a href="Time%20Again...Amy%20Grant%20Live">Time Again...Amy Grant Live</a>" was recorded in <a href="Fort%20Worth%2C%20Texas">Fort Worth, Texas</a>, at <a href="Bass%20Performance%20Hall">Bass Performance Hall</a>. (Grant's first paid public performance was at the Will Rogers Auditorium in Fort Worth.) The concert was released on September 26, 2006. In addition to receiving a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>, media appearances included write-ups in "<a href="CCM%20Magazine">CCM Magazine</a>", and a performance on "<a href="The%20View%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">The View</a>".

In a February 2007 web chat on her web site, Grant discussed a book she was working on titled "", saying, "It's not an autobiography, but more a collection of memories, song lyrics, poetry and a few pictures." The book was released on October 16, 2007. In November, it debuted at No. 35 on the <a href="New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">New York Times Best Seller list</a>. In the same web chat, Grant noted that she is "anxious to get back in the studio after the book is finished, and reinvent myself as an almost-50 performing woman".

2007 was Grant's 30th year in music. She left Word/Warner, and contracted with EMI CMG who re-released her regular studio albums as remastered versions on August 14, 2007. Marking the start of Grant's new contract is a career-spanning <a href="Greatest%20Hits%20%28Amy%20Grant%20album%29">greatest hits</a> album, with all the songs digitally remastered. The album was released as both a single-disc CD edition, and a two-disc CD/DVD Special Edition, the DVD featuring music videos and interviews.

Grant appeared with Gill on "<a href="The%20Oprah%20Winfrey%20Show">The Oprah Winfrey Show</a>" for a holiday special in December 2007. Grant has plans to appear on <a href="Country%20Music%20Television">CMT</a>, a <a href="Food%20Network">Food Network</a> special, the Gospel Music Channel, and <a href="The%20Hour%20of%20Power">The Hour of Power</a>.

In February 2008, Grant joined the writing team from <a href="Compassionart">Compassionart</a> as a guest vocalist at the Abbey Road studios, London, to record a song called "Highly Favoured", which was included on the album "<a href="CompassionArt%20%28album%29">CompassionArt</a>".

On June 24, 2008, Grant re-released her 1988 album, "Lead Me On", in honor of its 20th anniversary. The two-disc release includes the original album and a second disc with new acoustic recordings, live performances from 1989, and interviews with Amy. Grant recreated the "Lead Me On" tour in the fall of 2008.

On June 27, 2008, Grant surprised everyone at the <a href="Creation%20Festival">Creation Festival Northeast</a> by being the special guest. She performed "Lead Me On" and a few other songs backed with the <a href="Hawk%20Nelson">Hawk Nelson</a> band. At the end of the concert, Grant returned to the stage and sang "Thy Word". She appeared on the 2008 album "" singing "Could I Have This Dance".

On May 5, 2009, Grant released an EP containing two new songs, "<a href="She%20Colors%20My%20Day">She Colors My Day</a>", and "Unafraid", as well as the previously released songs "<a href="Baby%20Baby%20%28Amy%20Grant%20song%29">Baby Baby</a>" and "<a href="Oh%20How%20the%20Years%20Go%20By">Oh How the Years Go By</a>". The EP, exclusively through iTunes, benefited the Entertainment Industry Foundation's (EIF) Women's Cancer Research Fund.

In 2010, Grant released "<a href="Somewhere%20Down%20the%20Road%20%28Amy%20Grant%20album%29">Somewhere Down the Road</a>", featuring the hit single "<a href="Better%20Than%20a%20Hallelujah">Better Than a Hallelujah</a>", which peaked at No. 8 on "Billboard" Top Christian Songs chart. When asked about the new album during an interview with CBN.com, Grant says, "... my hope is just for those songs to provide companionship, remind myself and whoever else is listening what's important. I feel like songs have the ability to connect us to ourselves and to each other, and to our faith, to the love of Jesus, in a way that conversation doesn't do. Songs kind of slip in and move you before you realize it."

In September 2012, Grant took part in a campaign called "30 Songs / 30 Days" to support "", a multi-platform media project inspired by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn's book.

Grant's next album, titled "<a href="How%20Mercy%20Looks%20from%20Here">How Mercy Looks from Here</a>", was released on May 14, 2013. The album was produced by <a href="Marshall%20Altman">Marshall Altman</a>. The album reached No. 12 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart, making it her highest charting album since 1997's "<a href="Behind%20the%20Eyes%20%28Amy%20Grant%20album%29">Behind the Eyes</a>". Two singles were released from the album: "Don't Try So Hard" and "If I Could See", both of which charted on the US "<a href="Billboard%20Magazine">Billboard</a>" <a href="Hot%20Christian%20Songs">Hot Christian Songs</a> chart.

On August 19, 2014, she released an album of hits remixed by well known engineers and DJs. The album was titled "In Motion: The Remixes". It charted at 110 on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart and at number 5 on the <a href="Dance/Electronic%20Albums">US Dance</a> chart. To promote the album, several new remix EPs were released on iTunes the following month including "<a href="Find%20a%20Way%20%28Amy%20Grant%20song%29">Find a Way</a>, "<a href="Stay%20for%20Awhile">Stay for Awhile</a>", "<a href="Baby%20Baby%20%28Amy%20Grant%20song%29">Baby Baby</a>, "<a href="Every%20Heartbeat">Every Heartbeat</a>" and "<a href="That%27s%20What%20Love%20Is%20For">That's What Love Is For</a>". Due to club play of the remix of "Every Heartbeat", it charted at number 13 on the US <a href="Hot%20Dance%20Club%20Songs">Dance Chart</a>. This marked her first appearance on that chart in 23 years. On September 30, 2014, Grant released a new single titled "Welcome Yourself". In honor of <a href="National%20Breast%20Cancer%20Awareness%20Month">Breast Cancer Awareness Month</a>, proceeds of the single go to breast cancer research.

On February 12, 2015, she announced a new compilation album titled "<a href="Be%20Still%20and%20Know...%20Hymns%20%26amp%3B%20Faith">Be Still and Know... Hymns & Faith</a>", to be released. The album was released on April 14, 2015 and charted at No. 7 in the U.S. on the "<a href="Billboard%20Magazine">Billboard</a>" <a href="Christian%20Albums">Christian Albums</a> chart. .

On June 19, 1982, Grant married fellow Christian musician <a href="Gary%20Chapman%20%28musician%29">Gary Chapman</a>. Their marriage produced three children. In March 1999, she filed for divorce from Chapman, citing "irreconcilable differences," and the divorce was finalized three months later.
On March 10, 2000, Grant married country singer-songwriter <a href="Vince%20Gill">Vince Gill</a>, who had been previously married to country singer Janis Oliver of <a href="Sweethearts%20of%20the%20Rodeo">Sweethearts of the Rodeo</a>. Grant and Gill have one daughter together, Corrina Grant Gill, born March 12, 2001.

In the November 1999 "CCM Magazine", Grant explained why she left Chapman and married Gill:

"I didn't get a divorce because 'I had a great marriage and then along came Vince Gill'. Gary and I had a rocky road from day one. I think what was so hard—and this is (what) one of our counselors said—sometimes an innocent party can come into a situation, and they're like a big spotlight. What they do is reveal, by comparison, the painful dynamics that are already in existence."

Among praise for her contributions to the Contemporary Christian genre, Grant has also generated controversy within the Christian community, from "complaints that she was too worldly and too sexy" to a "barrage of condemnation" following her divorce and remarriage.

In an interview early in her career, Grant stated, "I have a healthy sense of right and wrong, but sometimes, for example, using foul, exclamation-point words among friends can be good for a laugh." The article which was based on that interview was constructed in such a manner so as to make it appear as though Grant condoned premarital sex. Later Grant reflected on how the article misrepresented her views, stating: "We probably talked for two hours about sexual purity, but when the interview finally came out he worded it in such a way that it sounded like I condoned premarital sex. So I picked up that article and thought, 'You've made me say something I've never said, and you've totally disregarded two hours of Bible put in one flippant comment that I made about a moan.'"

Aberdeen, South Dakota

Aberdeen (<a href="Lakota%20language">Lakota</a>: "Ablíla") is a city in and the <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a> of <a href="Brown%20County%2C%20South%20Dakota">Brown County, South Dakota</a>, United States, about northeast of <a href="Pierre%2C%20South%20Dakota">Pierre</a>. The city population was 26,091 at the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 census</a>, making it the <a href="List%20of%20cities%20in%20South%20Dakota">third largest city</a> in the state. Aberdeen is the principal city of the <a href="Aberdeen%2C%20South%20Dakota%2C%20micropolitan%20area">Aberdeen Micropolitan Statistical Area</a>, which includes all of Brown and <a href="Edmunds%20County%2C%20South%20Dakota">Edmunds</a> counties and has a population of 40,602 in 2010. Aberdeen is considered a <a href="college%20town">college town</a>, being the home of both <a href="Northern%20State%20University">Northern State University</a> and <a href="Presentation%20College%2C%20South%20Dakota">Presentation College</a>.

Before Aberdeen or Brown County was inhabited by European settlers, it was inhabited by the <a href="Lakota%20people">Sioux Indians</a> from approximately 1700 to 1879. Europeans entered the region for business, founding <a href="fur%20trading">fur trading</a> posts during the 1820s; these trading posts operated until the mid-1830s. The first "settlers" of this region were the <a href="Arikara">Arikara Indians</a>, but they would later be joined by others.

The first group of Euro-American settlers to reach the area that is now Brown County was a party of four people, three horses, two mules, fifteen cattle, and two wagons. This group of settlers was later joined by another group the following spring, and, eventually, more settlers migrated toward this general area, currently known as <a href="Columbia%2C%20South%20Dakota">Columbia, South Dakota</a>. This town was established on June 15, 1879. The town was settled in 1880, and incorporated in 1882.

Aberdeen, like many towns of the Midwest, was built around the newly developing railroad systems. Aberdeen was first officially plotted as a town site on January 3, 1881, by Charles Prior, the superintendent of the Minneapolis office of the <a href="Chicago%2C%20Milwaukee%2C%20St.%20Paul%20and%20Pacific%20Railroad">Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad</a>, or the Milwaukee Road for short, which was presided over by <a href="Alexander%20Mitchell%20%28Wisconsin%20politician%29">Alexander Mitchell</a>. Mitchell, Charles Prior's boss, was responsible for the choice of town names, was born in <a href="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a>, Scotland, after which the town of Aberdeen, South Dakota, was named. Aberdeen was officially founded on July 6, 1881, the date of the first arrival of a Milwaukee Railroad train. Aberdeen then operated under a city charter granted by the Territorial Legislature in March 1883.

As Aberdeen grew, many businesses and buildings were constructed along Aberdeen's Main Street. However, this soon became a problem due to Aberdeen's periodic flooding, which led to it being referred to as "The Town in the Frog Pond". At first, this unique condition presented no problem to the newly constructed buildings because it had not rained very much but, when heavy rains fell, the Pond reappeared and flooded the basements of every building on Main Street, causing many business owners and home owners much turmoil. When this flooding happened, the city had one steam-powered pump that had to be used to dry out the entire area that had been flooded, which would take days, if not weeks – and more often than not, it would have rained again in this time period and caused even more flooding, even in the basements that had already been emptied of the water. When the water was gone from the basements, the city still had to deal with the mud that also resulted from the heavy rains.

The city decided in 1882 to build an artesian ditch to control the "Frog Pond" effects; the plan was later upgraded and developed into an artesian well in 1884 to combat the heavy rains and keep the basements from flooding. The artesian well was designed by the city engineers to prevent flooding and develop a water system. However, during the digging of the well, the water stream that was found underground was too powerful to be contained. The water came blasting out with violent force and had the entire Main Street submerged in up to four feet of water. The engineers realized the previous flaws of the artesian well plan and soon added a gate valve to the well to control the flow of water, giving Aberdeen its first working water supply.

Aberdeen had four different railroad companies with depots built in the newly developing town. With these four railroads intersecting here, Aberdeen soon became known as the "Hub City of the Dakotas". When looking down on Aberdeen from above, the railroad tracks converging in Aberdeen resembled the spokes of a wheel converging at a hub, hence the name "Hub City of the Dakotas". These four railroad companies are the reason why Aberdeen was able to grow and flourish as it did. The only railroad still running through Aberdeen is the Burlington Northern Santa Fe.

On October 25, 1999, a Learjet 35 carrying golfing star <a href="Payne%20Stewart">Payne Stewart</a> crashed in a field near Aberdeen. All on board died.

Aberdeen is located in northeastern South Dakota, in the <a href="James%20River%20%28Dakotas%29">James River</a> valley, approximately west of the river. The James River enters northeastern South Dakota in Brown County, where it is dammed to form two reservoirs northeast of Aberdeen. The city is bisected by "Moccasin Creek", a slow-moving waterway which flows south and then northeast to the James River.

According to the <a href="United%20States%20Census%20Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a>, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Aberdeen has been assigned the <a href="ZIP%20code">ZIP code</a> range 57401−57402.

Aberdeen experiences a <a href="humid%20continental%20climate">humid continental climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen</a> "Dfb/Dfa") influenced by its position far from moderating bodies of water. This brings four distinct seasons, a phenomenon that is characterized by hot, relatively humid summers and cold, dry winters, and it lies in <a href="Hardiness%20zone">USDA Hardiness Zone</a> 4. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in January to in July, while there are 13 days of + highs and 37 days with sub- lows annually. Snowfall occurs mostly in light to moderate amounts during the winter, totaling . Precipitation, at annually, is concentrated in the warmer months. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on January 12, 1912, and February 8, 1895, to on July 6 and 15, 1936, although a reading occurred as recently as January 15, 2009.

The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration maintains a National Weather Service office in Aberdeen. Their area of responsibility includes northern and eastern South Dakota and two counties in west-central Minnesota.

Aberdeen is the county seat of Brown County. The original county seat was, however, <a href="Columbia%2C%20South%20Dakota">Columbia</a>. During the days of the railroad construction, plans were laid to bring the railroad through Columbia, then the county seat. When word of this spread, land in and around Columbia soared in price due to speculation. When the time came for the railroads to purchase land, the increase in land prices led them to change their decision and instead to route the rail lines through Aberdeen. However, once Aberdeen became a town in 1881, there was a long-running controversy concerning which town would be the county seat, which continued until 1890, when it was declared by the newly formed South Dakota state constitution in 1889 that a majority vote could move the county seat if the county seat in question had originally been established by less than a majority vote. The result of the vote declared that Aberdeen would be the county seat once and for all, so all of the records were once again transferred to Aberdeen's courthouse; during the battle for county seat, the records had been moved from Columbia's courthouse to Aberdeen's courthouse (which was built from 1886 to 1887), and back again to Columbia's in what seemed to be a never-ending cycle of the transferring of records. This was typically done in the form of nighttime raids from the two towns.

Aberdour

Aberdour (; , ) is a scenic and historic village on the south coast of <a href="Fife">Fife</a>, Scotland. It is on the north shore of the <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a>, looking south to the island of <a href="Inchcolm">Inchcolm</a> and its Abbey, and to <a href="Leith">Leith</a> and <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> beyond. According to the 2011 census, the village has a population of 1,633.

The village's winding High Street lies a little inland from the coast. Narrow lanes run off it, providing access to the more hidden parts of the village and the shoreline itself. The village nestles between the bigger coastal towns of <a href="Burntisland">Burntisland</a> to the east and <a href="Dalgety%20Bay">Dalgety Bay</a> to the west.

The origins of the village lie with its harbour, where the Dour Burn enters the River Forth. The place-name itself is <a href="Pictish%20language">Pictish</a>, implying an origin in the <a href="Dark%20Ages%20%28historiography%29">Dark Ages</a>: "aber" 'confluence'. The -dour element, referring to the Burn, means simply 'water' (archaic "dobur"), and is unconnected to the Scots/English 'dour'. For much of its history Aberdour was two villages, Wester Aberdour and Easter Aberdour, on either side of the Dour Burn; however this distinction was blurred by the 19th century arrival of the railway.

In the 18th century Aberdour's harbour was improved by the addition of a stone pier to help handle the coal traffic from nearby collieries. However, in the 1850s the traffic changed dramatically, and Aberdour Harbour became a popular destination for pleasure steamers from <a href="Leith">Leith</a>. This in turn led to the building of a deeper water pier a little around the bay at Hawkcraig, and to the development of hotels and many of the other services still on view today in the village.

The railway came to Aberdour in 1890, with the building of the line east from the newly opened <a href="Forth%20Bridge">Forth Bridge</a>. The <a href="Aberdour%20railway%20station">station</a> has won many "best kept station" awards. The half an hour journey to the centre of <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> helped build on the existing popularity of the village, though it put the steamers out of business. The main result was a growth in the building of large and attractive houses, especially down the hill from Wester Aberdour to the West Sands. <a href="Ticket%20inspector">Ticket inspector</a>s on the train line through Aberdour were known for their sing song refrain: ""Half an hour, Half an hour, Half an hour to Aberdour - tickets please.""

Virtually between the two former settlements, though actually part of Easter Aberdour, lies <a href="Aberdour%20Castle">Aberdour Castle</a>. This started life as a modest <a href="hall%20house">hall house</a> on a site overlooking the Dour Burn in the 13th century. The oldest part of the present semi-ruin constitutes one of the earliest surviving stone castles in mainland <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. Over the next four hundred years the Castle was successively developed according to contemporary architectural ideas. Notable are the parts, still largely roofed, built by the Earls of Morton, with refined <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> detail, in the second half of the 16th century. A fire in the late 17th century was followed by some repairs, but in 1725 the family purchased 17th century Aberdour House, on the west side of the burn and in Wester Aberdour, and the medieval Castle was allowed to fall into relative decay. Aberdour Castle is now in the care of <a href="Historic%20Scotland">Historic Scotland</a> and open to the public (entrance charge). After a period of dereliction Aberdour House was developed for residential use in the early 1990s.

Neighbouring St Fillan's Church is one of the best-preserved medieval parish churches in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, dating largely to the 12th century. A south arcade was added to the nave in the early 16th century (open in summer). The <a href="A921%20road">A921</a>, the main road along the south coast of <a href="Fife">Fife</a>, leads down the High Street of Wester Aberdour, before kinking sharply left to cross the railway line, then right again to progress through Easter Aberdour's Main Street.

Wester Aberdour has the more 'olde worlde' feel of the two, with the narrower through road more closely hemmed in by shops and hotels. A number of vernacular buildings of the 17th-early 19th centuries add to the historic scene. Close to the railway bridge, three lanes continue eastwards, presumably once the route of the original High Street before the arrival of the railway. One now leads to <a href="Aberdour%20railway%20station">Aberdour railway station</a>, a beautifully kept and cared for example of a traditional station, in keeping with its role of transporting at least a quarter of the village's working population to their work each day.

A second lane leads alongside the railway line to <a href="Aberdour%20Castle">Aberdour Castle</a>, while a third leads to the restored Aberdour House. A little further west, a narrow road closely lined with high walls, Shore Road, leads down to the West Sands and the Harbour. For many this area is the highlight of any visit to Aberdour; parking at the foot of Shore Road is usually at a premium.

Another road leads coastwards from Easter Aberdour. Hawkcraig Road leads past St Fillan's Church and through Silversand Park, home to <a href="Aberdour%20Shinty%20Club">Aberdour Shinty Club</a>, en route to the much better parking area on Hawkcraig. This was formerly a sandstone quarry and then used as the council refuse tip before becoming a carpark, part of the overgrown and rocky bluff separating Aberdour's two bays. From here is it a short walk to the Silver Sands, Aberdour's busiest and most popular beach. On the west side of Hawkcraig Point there is a short concrete jetty that was used as part of the development of radio controlled torpedoes during World War One. The foundations of the Radio Hut can still be seen in the lea of the hill.

The Aberdour obelisk was built by <a href="James%20Douglas%2C%2014th%20Earl%20of%20Morton">Lord Morton</a> on his departure from the village to relocate to a large home in Edinburgh, it was built so he could see his former hometown from his new house when he looked through binoculars - it stands in a cowfield between the castle and the beach.

The yearly festival runs from the last week in July for a week, running into early August. It is now in its 32nd year and is most notable for its marquee on the silver sands playing fields. The festival hosts a number of children's, cultural and local events. Acts that have performed at Aberdour festival have been Yard Of Ale, Percy & The Peanuts, Swings & Roundabouts, Capercaillie, Boys of the Lough, Eddi Reader and <a href="http%3A//www.fencerecords.com">The Fence Collective's</a> Three Craws

The Donkey brae run is held on the first Sunday of the festival and is popular nationwide, with a 7-mile race, 2-mile run and a 1-mile run for children.

Aberdour has a very popular yearly festival, which runs from late July to early August and features musical events, shows, sporting events and children's events.

Aberdour was a 2005 finalist in the prestigious "Beautiful Scotland in Bloom" awards. It was nominated for ""Best Coastal Resort"" in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> along with <a href="St%20Andrews">St Andrews</a> in <a href="Fife">Fife</a>, <a href="North%20Berwick">North Berwick</a> in <a href="East%20Lothian">East Lothian</a>, and <a href="Rothesay%2C%20Argyll%20and%20Bute">Rothesay</a> in <a href="Argyll%20and%20Bute">Argyll and Bute</a>.
In 2014 Aberdour was voted Best Coastal Village in Fife and Best Small Coastal Village in Scotland. It also received a Gold Award in Beautiful Fife and Beautiful Scotland.

Aberdour is home to Fife's only senior shinty club. <a href="Aberdour%20Shinty%20Club">Aberdour Shinty Club</a> field teams in both the men's and women's senior national leagues.

Aberdour has two beaches - the Silver Sands, and the Black Sands.

The Silver Sands are located on the East side of the village, and has previously held a "<a href="Blue%20Flag%20beach">Blue flag</a>" beach award, which denotes an exemplary standard of cleanliness, facilities, safety, environmental education and management. New facilities are currently under construction by Fife Council, which will much improve the beach throughout the year.

The Black Sands (also known as the West Beach), as the contrasting name would suggest, have a rockier and darker sand, and are also popular with visitors exploring the rock caves and fascinating sea life. During the summer months (April–September), dogs are banned from the Silver Sands but they are allowed all year round at the West Beach. The two beaches are linked by part of the <a href="Fife%20Coastal%20Path">Fife Coastal Path</a> which also takes you past the harbour and the Hawkcraig - a popular rock climbing location.

Silver Sands is becoming more popular with open water swimmers, who swim daily in the sea, both as a leisure pursuit, and as training for open water competition. The bay provides safety from the currents, although only the adventurous swim round to the harbour.

Several scenes of <a href="Richard%20Jobson%20%28television%20presenter%29">Richard Jobson</a>'s 2003 movie "<a href="16%20Years%20of%20Alcohol">16 Years of Alcohol</a>" were filmed at the Black Sands in Aberdour.

The island of <a href="Inchcolm">Inchcolm</a>, or Island (<a href="Scottish%20Gaelic%20language">Gaelic</a> "innis") of <a href="Columba">Columba</a>, a quarter of a mile from the shore, forms part of the parish of Aberdour. Its name implies associations dating back to the time of <a href="Columba">Columba</a> and, although undocumented before the 12th century, it may have served the monks of the Columban family as an '<a href="Iona">Iona</a> of the east' from early times.

During the First and Second World Wars, <a href="Inchcolm">Inchcolm</a> was occupied by the army as part of the defences of the <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a>. There are extensive remains of gun emplacements, barracks, etc. from these periods.

The island is notable for its wildlife, especially seabirds and seals. These draw many visitors in summer, along with the remains of the historic Abbey, and is a popular setting for weddings.

Notable past and present residents of the town include:

The <a href="slate">slate</a> <a href="Quarry">quarries</a> on Craigmore which operated from the 1820s to the 1950s are now defunct; at its peak this was a major industry. Other industries included an ironworks, established in the 1720s, as well as wool spinning and a lint mill.

From 1882 the village was served by <a href="Aberfoyle%20railway%20station">Aberfoyle railway station</a>, the terminus of the <a href="Strathendrick%20and%20Aberfoyle%20Railway">Strathendrick and Aberfoyle Railway</a> which connected to Glasgow via <a href="Dumbarton">Dumbarton</a> or <a href="Kirkintilloch">Kirkintilloch</a> The station closed to passenger traffic in 1951, and the remaining freight services ceased in 1959.

The above industries have since died out, and Aberfoyle is supported mainly by the forestry, industry and tourism.

Visitors were first attracted to Aberfoyle and the surrounding area after the publication of "<a href="Lady%20of%20the%20Lake">The Lady of the Lake</a>" by <a href="Sir%20Walter%20Scott">Sir Walter Scott</a> in 1810. The poem described the beauty of <a href="Loch%20Katrine">Loch Katrine</a>. Aberfoyle describes itself as "The Gateway to the Trossachs", and is well situated for visitors to access attractions such as <a href="Loch%20Lomond">Loch Lomond</a> and <a href="Inchmahome%20Priory">Inchmahome Priory</a> at the <a href="Lake%20of%20Menteith">Lake of Menteith</a>. A tourist information office run by <a href="VisitScotland">VisitScotland</a> sits in the centre of town, offering free information, selling souvenirs and acting as a booking office for many of the local B&B's and hotels. Aberfoyle Golf Club was built in 1860 and is located just south of town near the Rob Roy restaurant. Aberfoyle is also part of the <a href="Loch%20Lomond%20and%20The%20Trossachs%20National%20Park">Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park</a>.

Aberfoyle is also home to the largest Go Ape adventure course in the UK, featuring the longest death slide, or 'zip-line', in the UK.

Aberfoyle has connections to many historical figures such as <a href="Robert%20Roy%20MacGregor">Rob Roy</a> and <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>. Robert Roy MacGregor was born at the head of nearby Loch Katrine, and his well-known cattle stealing exploits took him all around the area surrounding Aberfoyle. It is recorded, for example, that in 1691, the MacGregors raided every barn in the village of Kippen and stole all the villagers' livestock! There currently stands a tree in the village that MacGregor was reputed to have climbed and hid in to escape the clutches of the law. Also, Mary, Queen of Scots, visited nearby Inchmahome Priory often as a child, and during her short reign. She also used the priory during her short reign, particularly in 1547, where she felt safe from the English Army.

However, the most local historical figure is the Reverend <a href="Robert%20Kirk%20%28folklorist%29">Robert Kirk</a>, born in 1644. It was the Rev. Kirk who provided the first translation into <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic%20language">Gaidhlig</a> of the Book of Psalms, however, he is better remembered for the publication of his book ""The Secret Commonwealth of Elves, Fauns, and Fairies"" in 1691. Kirk had long been researching fairies, and the book collected several personal accounts and stories of folk who claimed to have encountered them. It was after this, while Kirk was minister of Aberfoyle parish, that he died in unusual circumstances.

Kirk had long believed that the local Doon Hill was the gateway to the "Secret Commonwealth", or the land of the Fairies. It was a place that Kirk visited often, taking daily walks there from his manse. The story goes that the Fairies of Doon Hill were angry with the Rev. Kirk for going into the domain of the Unseelie court, where he had been warned not to go, and decided to imprison him in Doon Hill — for one night in May 1692, the Rev. Kirk went out for a walk to the hill, in his nightshirt. Some accounts claim that he simply vanished, however he suddenly collapsed. He was found and brought home, but died soon afterwards. He was buried in his own kirkyard, although local legends claim that the fairies took his body away, and the coffin contains only stones. The huge pine tree that still stands at the top of Doon Hill is said to contain Kirk's imprisoned spirit.

Kirk's cousin, Graham of Duchray, was then to claim that the spectre of Kirk had visited him in the night, and told him that he had been carried off by the Fairies. Having left his widow expecting a child, the spectre of Kirk told Graham that he would appear at the baptism, whereupon Graham was to throw an iron knife at the apparition, thus freeing Kirk from the Fairies' clutches. However, when Kirk's spectre appeared, Graham was apparently too shocked by the vision to throw the knife, and Kirk's ghost faded away forever.

Today, visitors to Doon Hill write their wishes on pieces of white silk, or other white cloth, and tie them to the branches of the trees for the Fairies to grant. Unfortunately some people tie plastic confectionery wrappers instead, which slightly spoils the magic of the location and may harm the ecology of the forest. It is also said that if one runs around the great 'Minister's Pine' tree at the summit seven times, then the Fairies will appear. Some people have tried this and afterwards claim to have seen apparitions. Others merely get a bit dizzy and fall over.

Abergavenny

Abergavenny (; , archaically "Abergafenni" meaning "Mouth of the <a href="River%20Gavenny">River Gavenny</a>") is a <a href="market%20town">market town</a> in <a href="Monmouthshire">Monmouthshire</a>, Wales. It is located west of <a href="Monmouth">Monmouth</a> on the <a href="A40%20road">A40</a> and <a href="A465%20road">A465</a> roads, from the English border. Originally the site of a <a href="Castra">Roman fort</a>, <a href="Gobannium">Gobannium</a>, it became a <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval</a> <a href="Defensive%20wall">walled town</a> within the <a href="Welsh%20marches">Welsh marches</a>. The town contains the remains of a medieval stone <a href="castle">castle</a> built soon after the <a href="Norman%20invasion%20of%20Wales">Norman conquest of Wales</a>. The town hosted the 2016 <a href="National%20Eisteddfod%20of%20Wales">National Eisteddfod of Wales</a>.

Abergavenny is promoted as a "Gateway to Wales". Situated at the <a href="confluence">confluence</a> of a <a href="tributary">tributary</a> stream, the Gavenny, and the <a href="River%20Usk">River Usk</a>, it is almost surrounded by two mountains – the <a href="Blorenge">Blorenge</a> () and the <a href="Sugar%20Loaf%20Mountain%2C%20Wales">Sugar Loaf</a> () – and five hills: <a href="Ysgyryd%20Fawr">Ysgyryd Fawr</a> (The Skirrid), Ysgyryd Fach (Skirrid Fach), Deri, Rholben and Mynydd Llanwenarth, known locally as "<a href="Llanwenarth">Llanwenarth</a> Breast". It provides access to the nearby <a href="Black%20Mountains%2C%20Wales">Black Mountains</a> and the <a href="Brecon%20Beacons">Brecon Beacons</a> <a href="National%20parks%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">National Park</a>. The <a href="Offa%27s%20Dyke%20Path">Offa's Dyke Path</a> is close by and the <a href="Marches%20Way">Marches Way</a>, the <a href="Beacons%20Way">Beacons Way</a> and <a href="Usk%20Valley%20Walk">Usk Valley Walk</a> all pass through the town.

In the UK 2011 census, the six relevant wards (Lansdown, Grofield, Castle, Croesonen, Cantref and Priory) collectively listed Abergavenny's population as 12,515.

The <a href="Welsh%20placenames">name</a> derives from a <a href="Brythonic%20languages">Brythonic</a> word "Gobannia" meaning "river of the blacksmiths", and relates to the town's pre-Roman importance in iron <a href="smelting">smelt</a>ing. The name is related to the modern Welsh word "gof" (<a href="blacksmith">blacksmith</a>), and so is also associated with the Welsh smith <a href="Gofannon">Gofannon</a> from folklore. The river later became, in Welsh, "Gafenni", and the town's name became Abergavenny, meaning "mouth of (Welsh: "Aber") the Gavenny ("Gafenni")". In Welsh, the shortened form "Y Fenni" may have come into use for a very short period after about the 15th century, although pronounced similarly in English or Welsh the English spelling Abergavenny is in general use.

Gobannium was a Roman fort guarding the road along the valley of the River Usk, which linked the legionary fortress of <a href="Burrium">Burrium</a> (<a href="Usk">Usk</a>) and later <a href="Isca%20Augusta">Isca Augusta</a> or Isca Silurum (<a href="Caerleon">Caerleon</a>) in the south with <a href="Y%20Gaer%2C%20Brecon">Y Gaer, Brecon</a> and <a href="Mid%20Wales">Mid Wales</a>. It was also built to keep the peace among the local <a href="British%20Iron%20Age">British Iron Age</a> tribe, the <a href="Silures">Silures</a>.

Remains of the walls of this fort were discovered west of the castle when excavating the foundations for a new <a href="post%20office">post office</a> and <a href="telephone%20exchange">telephone exchange</a> building in the late 1960s.

Abergavenny grew as a town in early <a href="Normans">Norman</a> times under the protection of the <a href="Baron%20Bergavenny">Lords of Abergavenny</a>. The first Baron was <a href="Hamelin%20de%20Balun">Hamelin de Balun</a>, from <a href="Ballon%2C%20Sarthe">Ballon</a>, a small town and castle in <a href="Maine-Anjou">Maine-Anjou</a> called "Gateway to Maine", near <a href="Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a>, today in the <a href="Sarthe%20%28d%C3%A9partement%29">Sarthe département</a> of France. He founded the <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> <a href="priory">priory</a>, now the <a href="Priory%20Church%20of%20St%20Mary%2C%20Abergavenny">Priory Church of St Mary</a>, in the late 11th century. The Priory belonged originally to the <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> foundation of St. Vincent Abbaye at Le Mans. It was subsequently endowed by <a href="William%20de%20Braose%2C%204th%20Lord%20of%20Bramber">William de Braose</a>, with a <a href="tithe">tithe</a> of the profits of the castle and town. The church contains some unique <a href="alabaster">alabaster</a> <a href="Effigy">effigies</a>, <a href="church%20monument">church monument</a>s and unique medieval wood carving, such as the <a href="Tree%20of%20Jesse">Tree of Jesse</a>.

Owing to its geographical location, the town was frequently embroiled in the border warfare and power play of the 12th and 13th centuries in the Welsh Marches. In 1175, <a href="Abergavenny%20Castle">Abergavenny Castle</a> was the site of the Massacre. Reference to a market at Abergavenny is found in a charter granted to the Prior by William de Braose.

<a href="Owain%20Glynd%C5%B5r">Owain Glyndŵr</a> attacked Abergavenny in 1404. According to popular legend, his raiders gained access to the walled town with the aid of a local woman who sympathised with the rebellion, letting a small party in via the Market Street gate at midnight. They were able to open the gate and allow a much larger party who set fire to the town and plundered its churches and homes leaving Abergavenny Castle intact. Market Street has been referred to as "Traitors' Lane" thereafter. In 1404 Abergavenny was declared its own nation by <a href="Ieuan%20ab%20Owain%20Glynd%C5%B5r">Ieuan ab Owain Glyndŵr</a>, illegitimate son of <a href="Owain%20Glynd%C5%B5r">Owain Glyndŵr</a>. The arrangement lasted approximately two weeks.

At the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a> in 1541, the priory's endowment went towards the foundation of a free <a href="grammar%20school">grammar school</a>, <a href="King%20Henry%20VIII%20Grammar%20School">King Henry VIII Grammar School</a>, the site itself passing to the Gunter family.

During the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, prior to the siege of <a href="Raglan%20Castle">Raglan Castle</a> in 1645, <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">King Charles I</a> visited Abergavenny and presided in person over the trial of <a href="Sir%20Trevor%20Williams%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Trefor Williams, 1st Baronet</a> of <a href="Llangybi%2C%20Monmouthshire">Llangibby</a>, a <a href="Royalist">Royalist</a> who changed sides, and other <a href="Roundhead">Parliamentarians</a>.

In 1639, Abergavenny received a <a href="charter">charter</a> of incorporation under the title of <a href="bailiff">bailiff</a> and <a href="Burgess%20%28word%29">burgesses</a>. A charter with extended privileges was drafted in 1657, but appears never to have been enrolled or to have come into effect. Owing to the refusal of the chief officers of the corporation to take the <a href="oath%20of%20allegiance">oath of allegiance</a> to <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a> in 1688, the charter was annulled, and the town subsequently declined in prosperity. Chapter 28 of the <a href="Laws%20in%20Wales%20Acts%201535%E2%80%931542">1535 Act of Henry VIII</a>, which provided that Monmouth, as <a href="county%20town">county town</a>, should return one burgess to Parliament, further stated that other <a href="Monmouthshire%20%28historic%29">ancient Monmouthshire boroughs</a> were to contribute towards the payment of the member. In consequence of this clause Abergavenny on various occasions shared in the election, the last instance being in 1685.

The right to hold two weekly markets and three yearly <a href="fair">fair</a>s, beginning in the 13th century, was held ever since as confirmed in 1657. Abergavenny was celebrated for the production of Welsh <a href="flannel">flannel</a>, and also for the manufacture, whilst the fashion prevailed, of goats' hair <a href="periwig">periwig</a>s.

<a href="Abergavenny%20railway%20station">Abergavenny railway station</a> opened 2 January 1854 by the <a href="Newport%2C%20Abergavenny%20and%20Hereford%20Railway">Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway</a>. The <a href="London%20North%20Western%20Railway">London North Western Railway</a> sponsored the construction of the railway linking <a href="Newport%20railway%20station">Newport station</a> to <a href="Hereford%20railway%20station">Hereford station</a>. The line was taken over by the <a href="West%20Midland%20Railway">West Midland Railway</a> in 1860 before becoming part of the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> in 1863. The station is on the <a href="Welsh%20Marches%20Line">Welsh Marches Line</a> and is mostly served by <a href="Arriva%20Trains%20Wales">Arriva Trains Wales</a> services.

The <a href="Baker%20Street%20drill%20hall%2C%20Abergavenny">Baker Street drill hall</a> was completed in 1896. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>'s deputy <a href="Rudolf%20Hess">Rudolf Hess</a> was kept under escort at <a href="Maindiff%20Court%20Military%20Hospital">Maindiff Court Military Hospital</a> during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, after his flight to Britain.

The title of <a href="Baron%20Bergavenny">Baron Abergavenny</a>, in the Nevill family, dates from the 15th century with <a href="Edward%20Nevill%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Bergavenny">Edward Nevill, 3rd Baron Bergavenny</a>, who was the youngest son of <a href="Ralph%20de%20Neville%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Westmorland">Ralph de Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland</a> by his second wife <a href="Joan%20Beaufort%2C%20Countess%20of%20Westmorland">Joan Beaufort</a>, daughter of <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster">John of Gaunt</a>, first <a href="Duke%20of%20Lancaster">Duke of Lancaster</a>. He married the heiress of <a href="Richard%20de%20Beauchamp%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Worcester">Richard de Beauchamp, 1st Earl of Worcester</a>, whose father had inherited the castle and estate of Abergavenny, and was summoned in 1392 to parliament as Lord Bergavenny. Edward Nevill was summoned to parliament with this title in 1450. His direct male descendants ended in 1587 in <a href="Henry%20Nevill%2C%206th%20Baron%20Bergavenny">Henry Nevill, 6th Baron Bergavenny</a>, but a cousin, <a href="Edward%20Nevill%2C%208th%20Baron%20Bergavenny">Edward Nevill, 8th Baron Bergavenny</a>, was confirmed in the barony in 1604. From him it has descended continuously, through fifteen individuals, the title being increased to an <a href="earl">earl</a>dom in 1784; and in 1876 <a href="William%20Nevill%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Abergavenny">William Nevill</a> 5th Earl, an indefatigable and powerful supporter of the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Tory Party</a>, was created 1st <a href="Marquess%20of%20Abergavenny">Marquess of Abergavenny</a>.

<a href="Coldbrook%20Park">Coldbrook Park</a> was a country house in an estate some southeast of the town. The house was originally built in the 14th century and belonged to the Herbert family for many generations until purchased by John Hanbury for his son, the diplomat Sir <a href="Charles%20Hanbury%20Williams">Charles Hanbury Williams</a>. Sir Charles reconstructed the house in 1746 with the addition of a nine-<a href="bay%20window">bay</a> two-storey <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> <a href="fa%C3%A7ade">façade</a> with a <a href="Doric%20order">Doric</a> <a href="portico">portico</a>. It subsequently passed down in the Hanbury Williams family until it was demolished in 1954.

Held during the first week of August every year, the <a href="National%20Eisteddfod">National Eisteddfod</a> is a celebration of the culture and language in Wales. The festival travels from place to place, alternating between north and south Wales, attracting around 150,000 visitors and over 250 tradestands and stalls. The Chair and Crown for 2016 were presented to the festival's Executive Committee, at a special ceremony in Monmouth held on 14 June 2016.

The <a href="Abergavenny%20Food%20Festival">Abergavenny Food Festival</a>, is held in the second week of September each year. The Steam, Veteran and Vintage Rally takes place in May every year. The event expands year on year with the 2016 rally including a rock choir, shire horses, motorcycling stunts, vintage cars and steam engines. The Country and Western Music Festival is attended by enthusiasts of <a href="country%20music">country music</a>. It marked its third year in 2016 and was attended by acts including Ben Thompson, LA Country and many more. The Abergavenny Writing Festival began in April 2016 and is a celebration of writing and the written word.

In recent decades the number of Welsh speakers in the town has increased dramatically. The 2001 census recorded 10% of the local population spoke the language, a five fold increase over ten years from the figure of 2% recorded in 1991.

The town has one of the two Welsh-medium primary schools in Monmouthshire, <a href="Ysgol%20Gymraeg%20y%20Fenni">Ysgol Gymraeg y Fenni</a>, which was founded in the early 1990s. It is also home to the Abergavenny Welsh society, <a href="Cymreigyddion%20y%20Fenni">Cymreigyddion y Fenni</a>, and the local <a href="Abergavenny%20Eisteddfod">Abergavenny Eisteddfod</a>.

Abergavenny was the home of <a href="Abergavenny%20Thursdays%20F.C.">Abergavenny Thursdays F.C.</a>, which was formed in 1927, but wound up in 2013. However, football is now represented in the town by the new Abergavenny Town team which was formerly called Govilon FC. Town play at the Penypound Stadium and are members of the Welsh League Division 2 for season 2016-17.

Abergavenny Cricket Club play at <a href="Pen-y-Pound%2C%20Abergavenny">Pen-y-Pound</a>, Avenue Road, and <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan CCC</a> also play some of their games here. Abergavenny Cricket Club is one of the oldest in the country and celebrated the 175th anniversary of its foundation in 2009. Abergavenny Tennis Club also play at <a href="Pen-y-Pound%2C%20Abergavenny">Pen-y-Pound</a> and plays in the South Wales Doubles League and Aegon Team Tennis.

Abergavenny is also the home of <a href="Abergavenny%20RFC">Abergavenny RFC</a>, a <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> club founded in 1875 who play at Bailey Park. They play in the <a href="Welsh%20Rugby%20Union">Welsh Rugby Union</a> Division Two East league.

A <a href="cattle">cattle</a> market has been held in Abergavenny on its current site since 1863. During the period 1825–1863 a <a href="Domestic%20sheep">sheep</a> market was held at a site in Castle Street, to stop the sale of sheep on the streets of the town. Today the market is leased and operated by Abergavenny Market Auctioneers Ltd, who hold regular livestock auctions on the site. Market days are: Tuesday – auction sale of finished sheep, cull ewe/store and fodder (hay and straw). Some Fridays – auction sale of cattle. A few other sales are held at the market on other days throughout the year. Following the closure of <a href="Newport%2C%20Wales">Newport</a>'s cattle market for redevelopment, Newport’s sales are held at Abergavenny every Wednesday.

In 2011, doubts about the future of Abergavenny Cattle Market were raised following the granting of planning permission by <a href="Monmouthshire%20County%20Council">Monmouthshire County Council</a> for its demolition and replacement with a supermarket, car park, and library.

In January 2012, the Welsh Government announced the repeal the Abergavenny Improvement Acts of 1854 to 1871 which obliged the holding of a livestock market within the boundaries of Abergavenny town; that repeal being effective from 26 March 2012.

<a href="Monmouthshire%20County%20Council">Monmouthshire County Council</a>, which requested that the Abergavenny Improvement Acts be repealed, is supporting plans for a new cattle market to be established about from Abergavenny in countryside at Bryngwyn, some from <a href="Raglan%2C%20Monmouthshire">Raglan</a>. There has been extensive local opposition to this site, which is situated on a notoriously dangerous B road.

Various markets are held in the Market Hall, for example: Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays – retail market; Wednesdays – flea market; fourth Thursday of each month – <a href="farmers%27%20market">farmers' market</a>; third Sunday of each month – antique fair; second Saturday of each month – craft fair.


<a href="Abergavenny%20Castle">Abergavenny Castle</a> is located strategically just south of the town centre overlooking the <a href="River%20Usk">River Usk</a>. It was built in about 1067 by the Norman baron <a href="Hamelin%20de%20Ballon">Hamelin de Ballon</a> to guard against incursions by the Welsh from the hills to the north and west. All that remains is defensive ditches and the ruins of the stone keep, towers, and part of the curtain wall. It is a <a href="Listed%20building">Grade I listed building</a>.
Other listed buildings in the town include the parish Church of St Mary, a medieval and Victorian building that was originally the church of the Benedictine priory founded in Abergavenny before 1100; the sixteenth century tithe barn near St Mary's; the Victorian Church of the Holy Trinity; the Grade II* listed St John's Masonic Lodge; the Museum; the Public Library; the Town Hall; and the remains of the town walls behind Neville Street.
The <a href="Church%20in%20Wales">Church in Wales</a> church of the Holy Trinity is in the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Monmouth">Diocese of Monmouth</a>. Holy Trinity Church was consecrated by the Bishop of Llandaff on November 6, 1840. It was originally built as a chapel to serve the adjacent almshouses and the nearby school. It has been Grade II listed since January 1974.

From 1851, the <a href="Monmouthshire">Monmouthshire</a> <a href="Lunatic%20Asylum">Lunatic Asylum</a>, later <a href="Pen-y-Fal%20Hospital">Pen-y-Fal Hospital</a>, a <a href="psychiatric%20hospital">psychiatric hospital</a>, stood on the outskirts of Abergavenny. Between 1851 and 1950, over 3,000 patients died at the hospital. A memorial plaque for the deceased has now been placed at the site. After closure in the 1990s, its buildings and grounds were redeveloped as a luxury housing development comprising houses as well as apartments. Some psychiatric services are now administered from <a href="Maindiff%20Court%20Hospital">Maindiff Court Hospital</a> on the outskirts of the town, close to the foot of the <a href="Skirrid">Skirrid</a> mountain. The hospital is housed in historic buildings, and is known for <a href="Rudolf%20Hess">Rudolf Hess</a> who was incarcerated here during WW2.

Abersychan was the birthplace of the politicians <a href="Roy%20Jenkins">Roy Jenkins</a>, <a href="Don%20Touhig">Don Touhig</a> and <a href="Paul%20Murphy%20%28UK%20politician%29">Paul Murphy</a> (MP for Torfaen); and of the <a href="rugby%20football">rugby football</a>ers <a href="Wilfred%20Hodder">Wilfred Hodder</a>, <a href="Candy%20Evans">Candy Evans</a> and <a href="Bryn%20Meredith">Bryn Meredith</a>.

Like many of the 17th century isolated agricultural hamlets in the forested South Wales Valleys, Abersychan became a thriving industrial centre in the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly for iron production.

After the discovery of iron stone locally, the principal ironworks were built by the <a href="British%20Iron%20Company">British Iron Company</a> in 1825, served mainly by the LNWR's <a href="Brynmawr%20and%20Blaenavon%20Railway">Brynmawr and Blaenavon Railway</a>. The ironwork's main office building and <a href="quadrangle%20%28architecture%29">quadrangle</a> were designed by architect <a href="Decimus%20Burton">Decimus Burton</a>, best known for his design of <a href="London%20Zoo">London Zoo</a>. The works passed to the New British Iron Company in 1843 and to the <a href="Ebbw%20Vale">Ebbw Vale</a> Company in 1852, before closing in 1889. On 6 February 1890, an underground <a href="explosion">explosion</a> at Llanerch Colliery killed 176.

The site of the former ironworks today is a core site of , and a total land area of , includes a number of listed buildings:

Various proposals have been made over the years to redevelop the site, currently under the ownership of <a href="HSBC">HSBC</a>, but none have so far passed the requirements of <a href="Torfaen">Torfaen</a> <a href="County%20borough">county council</a>.

Abersychan constitutes a community and electoral ward of the <a href="county%20borough">county borough</a> of <a href="Torfaen">Torfaen</a>. The area was part of the ancient parish of <a href="Trevethin">Trevethin</a>, in <a href="Monmouthshire%20%28historic%29">Monmouthshire</a>. On 3 June 1864 Abersychan was constituted a local government district, governed by a <a href="local%20board%20of%20health">local board</a>. In 1894 Abersychan became an <a href="Urban%20district%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">urban district</a> and <a href="civil%20parishes%20in%20Wales">civil parish</a>. The urban district was abolished in 1935, with most of its area passing to Pontypool urban district, and a small area going to <a href="Abercarn">Abercarn</a> UD.

In 1974 the area became part of the borough of Torfaen, in the new local government county of <a href="Gwent%20%28county%29">Gwent</a>. The community of Abersychan was formed in 1985, but no <a href="community%20council">community council</a> has yet been formed. Abersychan and Cwmavon is now a ward for the Pontypool Community Council. In 1996 Torfaen became a unitary authority.

The Abersychan community includes Abersychan, <a href="Cwmavon%2C%20Torfaen">Cwmavon</a>, <a href="Garndiffaith">Garndiffaith</a>, <a href="Pentwyn%2C%20Torfaen">Pentwyn</a>, <a href="Talywain">Talywain</a>, <a href="Varteg">Varteg</a>, and <a href="Victoria%20Village%2C%20Torfaen">Victoria Village</a>.

The nearest railway stations to Abersychan are <a href="Pontypool%20and%20New%20Inn%20railway%20station">Pontypool & New Inn</a> (3 miles), <a href="Llanhilleth%20railway%20station">Llanhilleth</a> (3.5 miles) and <a href="Abergavenny%20railway%20station">Abergavenny</a> (7 miles). Abersychan was served by the following (disused) stations:

"Pentwyn", <a href="Torfaen">Torfaen</a> is a small village located in the district of Abersychan. It contains a post office, a chapel, several houses and a small play park. The village has a <a href="cricket">cricket</a> team (Pentwyn CC) and is located right next to the old railway line. The cricket club celebrated its 100-year anniversary in 2006 with a successful tour to <a href="Cork%20%28city%29">Cork</a>, Ireland. The village has superb views over the <a href="River%20Severn">River Severn</a> and <a href="Newport%2C%20Wales">Newport</a> to the south.

"Victoria Village" is a small <a href="hamlet%20%28place%29">hamlet</a> located in the district of Abersychan. It comprises a small village school and a number of houses. A small group of houses on Incline Road mark the beginning of the village and the village boundary is near <a href="Cwmavon%2C%20Torfaen">Cwmavon</a>. Victoria Primary School is also in this area, housed in large grounds. Many homes are built around the school's boundaries.

Abertillery

Abertillery (; , meaning mouth of the <a href="Cwmtillery">River Tyleri</a>) is the largest town of the <a href="Ebbw%20Fach%20Valley">Ebbw Fach valley</a> in what was the <a href="Monmouthshire%20%28historic%29">historic county of Monmouthshire</a>, <a href="Wales">Wales</a>. Following local government reorganisation it became part of the <a href="Blaenau%20Gwent">Blaenau Gwent</a> County Borough administrative area.

The surrounding landscape borders the <a href="Brecon%20Beacons%20National%20Park">Brecon Beacons National Park</a> and the Blaenavon World heritage Site. Formerly a major coal mining centre the Abertillery area was transformed in the 1990s using EU and other funding to return to a greener environment.

Situated on the A467 the town is north of the <a href="M4%20motorway%20%28Great%20Britain%29">M4</a> and south of the <a href="A465%20road">A465</a> "Heads of the Valleys" trunk road. It is about by road from <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> and from Bristol.

According to the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202001">2001 Census</a> and information gathered by The <a href="Welsh%20Language%20Board">Welsh Language Board</a> (), 1,146 (9.9%) of Abertillery speaks Welsh. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202011">2011 Census</a>, this figure dropped to 7.2%, a 2.7 percentage point drop.

Abertillery's traditional-style town centre mainly developed in the late 19th century and as such has some interesting <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian architecture</a>. Spread over 4 main streets the town in its heyday had two department stores and a covered Victorian arcade linking two of the main shopping areas. These were all included in a Blaenau Gwent Borough Council remodelling and modernisation project using European Union funding in a £13 million programme spread over a 5-year period ending in 2015.

The project included a new multi-storey car park, a revamp of public areas and the town's Metropole Theatre. This <a href="RICS">RICS</a> award-winning building provides state of the art production, exhibition, conference and meeting facilities as well as housing Abertillery museum. In March 2014 <a href="Edward%2C%20Earl%20of%20Wessex">Prince Edward, the Earl of Wessex</a>, officiated at the launch of Jubilee Square, a public facility in the town centre next to St Michael's Church.

Major industry came to the area in 1843 when the locality's first deep coal mine was sunk at Tir Nicholas Farm, <a href="Cwmtillery">Cwmtillery</a>. The town developed rapidly thereafter and played a major part in the South Wales coalfield. Its population rose steeply, being 10,846 in the 1891 census and 21,945 ten years later. The population peaked just short of 40,000 around the beginning of the 1930s. Eventually there were six deep coal mines, numerous small coal levels, a tin works, brick works, iron foundry and light engineering businesses in the area. Just one of the coal mines, <a href="Cwmtillery">Cwmtillery</a>, produced over 32 million tons of coal in its lifetime and at its height employed 2760 men and boys.

In 1960 an underground explosion at <a href="Six%20Bells%20Colliery">Six Bells Colliery</a> resulted in the loss of life of 45 local miners. Fifty years later the archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams officiated at the launch of the <a href="Guardian%20-%20mining%20memorial">"Guardian" mining memorial</a>. This artistically acclaimed monument standing at 20m tall overlooks Parc Arael Griffin, the now reclaimed and landscaped former colliery site. The adjoining <a href="http%3A//www.tyebbwfach.co.uk/">Ty Ebbw Fach</a> visitor centre provides conference facilities, a restaurant and a "mining valley" experience room. Not long after the disaster the renowned artist <a href="L.%20S.%20Lowry">L. S. Lowry</a> visited the area and recorded the scene. The resultant landscape painting now hangs in the <a href="Museum%20of%20Wales">Museum of Wales</a> in <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>.

The coal mines remained the predominant economic emphasis until the general run down of the industry in the 1980s.

Away from the town centre, the often steep sided nature of the landscape, imposes its own demands on development. Whilst this sounds limiting it has helped provide the almost amphitheatre nature of Abertillery Park, often described as one of the most attractive rugby grounds in world rugby.

The street plan and housing stock flow uninterrupted from Cwmtillery in the north to Six Bells in the south, forming the town that is Abertillery. Prior to 1974 local government was provided by <a href="List%20of%20urban%20districts%20formed%20in%20England%20and%20Wales%201894%E2%80%9395">Abertillery Urban District</a> Council (AUDC). Its area included the small neighbouring villages of <a href="Aberbeeg">Aberbeeg</a>, <a href="Llanhilleth">Llanhilleth</a> and Brynithel. Historical data relating to Abertillery occasionally refers to this AUDC area meaning that it can be difficult to compare like with like. For example, the 2014 population for the wider conurbation area is around 20,000 rather than the 11,000 often quoted for Abertillery itself.

Whilst in the main the area has an older housing stock there are several developments of modern, often large homes, generally found on the outskirts of the town with views out over the surrounding area. These apart, terraced <a href="Council%20Tax">council tax band</a> A and B properties predominate, meaning that average house prices are among the most affordable in the UK.

There are very few written historical records relating to the area possibly because today's town developed as late as the middle of the 19th century. Nevertheless, there are facts that you can use to outline important events.


Before the coming of major industry, Abertillery was little more than an area of scattered farms in the ancient parish of <a href="Aberystruth">Aberystruth</a>. In 1779 the parish minister Edmund Jones described the area thus: "The valley of Tyleri ... is the most delightful. The trees ... especially the beech trees, abounding about rivers great and small, the hedges and lanes make these places exceeding pleasant and the passing by them delightful and affecting ... in these warm valleys, with the prospect of the grand high mountains about them would make very delightful habitations." In 1799 clergyman and historian <a href="William%20Coxe%20%28historian%29">Archdeacon William Coxe</a> toured the area and in writing a diary of his travels described it as "... richly wooded, and highly cultivated...we looked down with delight upon numerous valleys ... with romantic scenery". The entire population of Aberystruth parish at the turn of the 19th century was just a little over 800. It is not known what the population of Abertillery was at the time but it was probably in the very low hundreds, all of whom would have spoken Welsh only.

The area's first deep coal mine was sunk in 1843.

Formed in 1877, Abertillery Urban District Council incorporated the adjoining smaller communities of Six Bells, Cwmtillery, Brynithel, Aberbeeg and Llanhilleth. The population of this conurbation climbed to almost 40,000 in 1931 making it the second largest town in Monmouthshire. The council was abolished in 1974 as part of major UK wide local government reorganisation.

The reopening of <a href="Abertillery%20railway%20station">Abertillery railway station</a> has been identified as a future development of the <a href="Ebbw%20Valley%20Railway">Ebbw Valley Railway</a>. Regular bus services in the area link with <a href="Llanhilleth%20railway%20station">Llanhilleth railway station</a>, away.

The modern <a href="Abertillery%20Comprehensive%20School">local comprehensive</a> provides secondary education for the town and neighbouring areas. It is fed by several small schools, the most recent of which was opened in 2000. Until the 1970s the town had its own local authority run Grammar school providing education up to the age of eighteen. Tertiary education is now provided by <a href="Coleg%20Gwent">Coleg Gwent</a> at Ebbw Vale – opened in 2013.

There are several small and medium-sized business parks in the area offering a range of business premises. In 2014 the largest employer was Tyleri Valley Foods. Many local people commute outside the area to work.

Abertillery Town <a href="cricket">cricket</a> club and <a href="Abertillery%20RFC">Abertillery Blaenau Gwent RFC</a> formed in the 1880s. Both have their playing headquarters at "the Park" one of the most picturesque sporting complexes in the UK.
The town supports two local Saturday <a href="Association%20football">football</a> teams: <a href="Abertillery%20Bluebirds%20F.C.">Abertillery Bluebirds</a> and Abertillery Excelsiors. There are numerous other sports activities running on an organized basis such as bowls, badminton, squash etc.

The surrounding landscape provides hill walking opportunities and walker led groups are thriving in the area. One example is <a href="http%3A//www.ebbwfachtrekkers.co.uk/index.php/ShowWalk%3Fw%3D185">Ebbw Fach Trekkers walking group.</a> The Borough Council provides details of local walks.

The local <a href="http%3A//www.abertilleryanddistrictmuseum.org.uk">museum</a> has displays showing what life was like in the area in its heyday. It also has its own "valleys" Italian café complete with original furnishings.

The <a href="http%3A//www.the-met.co.uk">Metropole</a> theatre holds musical and drama events – from Blues to amateur dramatics and dance.

The <a href="Guardian%20%28sculpture%29">"Guardian" memorial</a> is a destination for visitors to South Wales and amateur photographers in particular as evidenced by <a href="https%3A//www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g1471577-d2441584-r200629790-Guardian_Six_Bells_Mining_Memorial-Abertillery_Blaenau_Gwent_South_Wales_Wales.html">trip advisor</a>.

<doc id="2719" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2719" title="Abettor">
Abettor

Abettor (from "to abet," <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> "abeter", "à" and "beter", to bait, urge dogs upon any one; this word is probably of Scandinavian origin, meaning to cause to bite), is a legal term implying one who instigates, encourages or assists another to commit an offence.

An abettor differs from an <a href="Accessory%20%28legal%20term%29">accessory</a> in that he must be present at the commission of the crime; in addition they are equally guilty as they knowingly and voluntarily assist in the commission of that crime. All abettors (with certain exceptions) are principals, and, in the absence of specific statutory provision to the contrary, are punishable to the same extent as the actual perpetrator of the offence. A person may in certain cases be convicted as an abettor in the commission of an offence in which he or she could not be a principal, e.g. a woman or boy under fourteen years of age in aiding rape, or a solvent person in aiding and abetting a bankrupt to commit offences against the bankruptcy laws.

More recently, an abettor is generally known as an <a href="accomplice">accomplice</a>.

<doc id="2720" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2720" title="Abeyance">
Abeyance

Abeyance (from the <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> "abeance" meaning "gaping") is a state of expectancy in respect of property, titles or office, when the right to them is not <a href="vesting">vested</a> in any one person, but awaits the appearance or determination of the true owner. In law, the term abeyance can only be applied to such <a href="Future%20interest">future estates</a> as have not yet vested or possibly may not vest. For example, an estate is granted to A for life, with <a href="Remainder%20%28law%29">remainder</a> to the heir of B. During B's lifetime, the remainder is in abeyance, for until the death of B it is uncertain who is B's heir. Similarly the <a href="Freehold%20%28real%20property%29">freehold</a> of a <a href="benefice">benefice</a>, on the death of the incumbent, is said to be in abeyance until the next incumbent takes possession.

The term hold in abeyance is used in lawsuits and court cases when a case is temporarily put on hold.

The most common use of the term is in the case of English <a href="British%20Peerage">peerage</a> dignities. Most such peerages pass to <a href="Order%20of%20succession%23Agnatic%20succession">heirs-male</a>, but the ancient <a href="barony">baronies</a> created by <a href="hereditary%20peer%23Writs%20of%20summons">writ</a>, as well as some very old <a href="earldom">earldom</a>s, pass instead to <a href="Order%20of%20succession%23Primogeniture">heirs-general</a> (by <a href="cognatic%20primogeniture">cognatic primogeniture</a>). In this system, sons are preferred from eldest to youngest, the heirs of a son over the next son, and any son over daughters, but there is no preference among daughters: they or their heirs inherit equally.

If the daughter is an only child or her sisters are deceased and have no living issue, she (or her heir) is vested with the title; otherwise, since a peerage cannot be shared nor divided, the dignity goes into abeyance between the sisters or their heirs, and is held by no one. If through lack of issue, marriage, or both, eventually only one person represents the claims of all the sisters, he or she can claim the dignity as a matter of right, and the abeyance is said to be terminated. On the other hand, the number of prospective heirs can grow quite large, since each share potentially can be divided between daughters, where the owner of a share dies without leaving a son.

A co-heir may petition the Crown for a termination of the abeyance. The Crown may choose to grant the petition, but if there is any doubt whatsoever as to the pedigree of the petitioner, the claim is normally referred to the <a href="Peerage%20law%23Peerage%20disputes">Committee for Privileges</a>. If the claim is unopposed, the Committee will generally award the claim, unless there is evidence of <a href="collusion">collusion</a>, the peerage has been in abeyance for more than a century, or the petitioner holds less than one-third of the claim.

This doctrine is a 17th-century innovation, although it is now applied retrospectively for centuries. It cannot be applied perfectly; for example, <a href="Thomas%20West%2C%208th%20Baron%20De%20La%20Warr">the eighth Baron De La Warr</a> had three surviving sons; <a href="Thomas%20West%2C%209th%20Baron%20De%20La%20Warr">the first</a> died without children, the second left two daughters, and the third left a son. In modern law, the title would have fallen into abeyance between the two daughters of the second son, and nobody else would have been able to claim it even if the abeyance were settled; however, in 1597, <a href="Thomas%20West%2C%202nd%20Baron%20De%20La%20Warr">the grandson of the third son</a> (whose <a href="William%20West%2C%201st%20Baron%20De%20La%20Warr">father</a> had been re-created <a href="Earl%20De%20La%20Warr">Baron De La Warr</a> in 1570) claimed the title and its precedence.

In 1604, the <a href="Baron%20le%20Despencer">Baron le Despencer</a> case was the first peerage abeyance ever settled; the second was at the <a href="Restoration%20%281660%29">Restoration</a> in 1660. Most subsequent abeyances (only a few dozen cases) were settled after a few years, in favour of the holder of the family properties; there were two periods in which long-abeyant peerages (in some cases peerages of doubtful reality) were brought back: between 1838 and 1841 and between 1909 and 1921. "<a href="The%20Complete%20Peerage">The Complete Peerage</a>" reports that only baronies have been called out of abeyance, although the <a href="Earl%20of%20Cromartie">Earldom of Cromartie</a> was called out of a two-year abeyance in 1895.

It is entirely possible for a peerage to remain in abeyance for centuries. For example, the <a href="Baron%20Grey%20of%20Codnor">Barony of Grey of Codnor</a> was in abeyance for over 490 years between 1496 and 1989, and the <a href="Baron%20Hastings">Barony of Hastings</a> was similarly in abeyance for over 299 years from 1542 to 1841. Some other baronies became abeyant in the 13th century, and the abeyance has yet to be terminated. The only titles other than a barony that have yet gone into abeyance are the <a href="Baron%20Arlington">earldom of Arlington and the viscountcy of Thetford</a>, which are united, and (as noted above) the <a href="Earl%20of%20Cromartie">earldom of Cromartie</a>.

It is no longer straightforward to claim English peerages after long abeyances. In 1927 a parliamentary Select Committee on Peerages in Abeyance recommended that no claim should be considered where the abeyance has lasted more than 100 years, nor where the claimant lays claim to less than one third of the dignity. The <a href="Baron%20Grey%20of%20Codnor">Barony of Grey of Codnor</a> was treated as an exception to this principle, as a claim to it had been submitted prior to these recommendations being made to the Sovereign.

Titles in the <a href="Peerage%20of%20Scotland">Peerage of Scotland</a> cannot go into abeyance, because in Scottish law the eldest sister is preferred over younger sisters; sisters are not considered equal co-heirs.

It is common, but incorrect, to speak of peerage dignities which are dormant (i.e. unclaimed) as being in abeyance.


Abeyance can be used in cases where parties are interested in temporarily settling litigation while still holding the right to seek relief later if necessary. This may be considered a desirable outcome in cases where the party to the lawsuit is an organization with a transient membership and political perspective. The use of abeyance in such instances can allow such an organization to 'settle' with the party without officially binding its actions in the future, should a new group of decision makers within the organization choose to pursue taking the dispute to court.

For example, abeyance was used as a settlement method in a Canadian lawsuit involving the <a href="University%20of%20Victoria%20Students%27%20Society">University of Victoria Students' Society</a> (UVSS), the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Civil%20Liberties%20Association">BCCLA</a>, and a campus pro-life club to whom the UVSS denied funding. The parties agreed to settle the lawsuit by holding the case in abeyance in return for the UVSS temporarily giving resources back to the club. With this arrangement, the pro-life club held on to its right to immediately reopen the case again should the UVSS deny resources to the club in the future, and the UVSS was able to avoid an expensive legal battle it did not have the will to pursue at the time. Thus the use of abeyance provided the security of a settlement for the pro-life campus club, while preserving the student society's voting membership's ability to take the matter back to court should they choose in the future to deny resources to the club.

Other court cases may be held in abeyance when the issue may be resolved by another court or another event. This saves time and effort trying to resolve a dispute that may be made <a href="mootness">moot</a> by the other events. During lawsuits related to the <a href="Patient%20Protection%20and%20Affordable%20Care%20Act">Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA, Obamacare) after the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> granted <a href="certiorari">certiorari</a> in "<a href="King%20v.%20Burwell">King v. Burwell</a>", attorneys in "Halbig v. Burwell" requested abeyance of that case as the matter would be resolved in "King" and it would be a waste of time and effort to try and resolve it in the "Halbig" case.

Anders Celsius

Anders Celsius (27 November 170125 April 1744) was a <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a> <a href="astronomy">astronomer</a>, physicist and mathematician. He was professor of astronomy at <a href="Uppsala%20University">Uppsala University</a> from 1730 to 1744, but traveled from 1732 to 1735 visiting notable observatories in Germany, Italy and France. He founded the <a href="Uppsala%20Astronomical%20Observatory">Uppsala Astronomical Observatory</a> in 1741, and in 1742 proposed the <a href="Celsius">Celsius</a> <a href="temperature">temperature</a> scale which bears his name.

Anders Celsius was born in <a href="Uppsala">Uppsala</a>, Sweden on 27 November 1701. His family originated from <a href="Ovan%C3%A5ker">Ovanåker</a> in the province of <a href="H%C3%A4lsingland">Hälsingland</a>. Their family estate was at "<a href="Doma%2C%20Ovan%C3%A5ker%20Municipality">Doma</a>", also known as "Höjen" or "Högen" (locally as "Högen 2"). The name "Celsius" is a latinization of the estate's name (Latin "celsus" "mound").

As the son of an astronomy professor, <a href="Nils%20Celsius">Nils Celsius</a>, and the grandson of the mathematician <a href="Magnus%20Celsius">Magnus Celsius</a> and the astronomer Anders Spole, Celsius chose a career in science. He was a talented mathematician from an early age. Anders Celsius studied at Uppsala University, where his father was a teacher, and in 1730 he too, became a professor of astronomy there.

In 1730, Celsius published the ("New Method for Determining the Distance from the Earth to the Sun"). His research also involved the study of auroral phenomena, which he conducted with his assistant <a href="Hiorter">Olof Hiorter</a>, and he was the first to suggest a connection between the <a href="aurora%20borealis">aurora borealis</a> and changes in the magnetic field of the Earth. He observed the variations of a compass needle and found that larger deflections correlated with stronger auroral activity. At <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> in 1733, he published a collection of 316 observations of the aurora borealis made by himself and others over the period 1716–1732.

Celsius traveled frequently in the early 1730s, including to Germany, Italy and France, when he visited most of the major European observatories. In Paris he advocated the measurement of an <a href="arc%20of%20the%20meridian">arc of the meridian</a> in <a href="Laponia%20%28historical%20province%29">Lapland</a>. In 1736, he participated in the expedition organized for that purpose by the <a href="French%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">French Academy of Sciences</a>, led by the French mathematician <a href="Pierre%20Louis%20Maupertuis">Pierre Louis Maupertuis</a> (1698–1759) to measure a degree of <a href="latitude">latitude</a>. The aim of the expedition was to measure the length of a degree along a meridian, close to the pole, and compare the result with a similar expedition to <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, today in <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, near the <a href="equator">equator</a>. The expeditions confirmed <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a>'s belief that the shape of the earth is an <a href="ellipsoid">ellipsoid</a> flattened at the poles. 

In 1738, he published the ("Observations on Determining the Shape of the Earth"). Celsius' participation in the Lapland expedition won him much respect in Sweden with the government and his peers, and played a key role in generating interest from the Swedish authorities in donating the resources required to construct a new modern observatory in Uppsala. He was successful in the request, and Celsius founded the <a href="Uppsala%20Astronomical%20Observatory">Uppsala Astronomical Observatory</a> in 1741. The observatory was equipped with instruments purchased during his long voyage abroad, comprising the most modern instrumental technology of the period.

In astronomy, Celsius began a series of observations using colored glass plates to record the magnitude (a measure of brightness) of certain stars. This was the first attempt to measure the intensity of starlight with a tool other than the human eye. He made observations of eclipses and various astronomical objects and published catalogues of carefully determined magnitudes for some 300 stars using his own photometric system (mean error=0.4 mag).

Celsius was the first to perform and publish careful experiments aiming at the definition of an international <a href="temperature">temperature</a> <a href="Celsius">scale</a> on scientific grounds. In his Swedish paper "Observations of two persistent degrees on a thermometer" he reports on experiments to check that the freezing point is independent of latitude (and of atmospheric pressure). He determined the dependence of the boiling of water with atmospheric pressure which was accurate even by modern-day standards. He further gave a rule for the determination of the boiling point if the barometric pressure deviates from a certain standard pressure. He proposed the Celsius temperature scale in a paper to the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Sciences%20in%20Uppsala">Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala</a>, the oldest Swedish scientific society, founded in 1710. His thermometer was calibrated with a value of 100° for the freezing point of water and 0° for the boiling point. In 1745, a year after Celsius' death, the scale was reversed by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> to facilitate more practical measurement. Celsius originally called his scale centigrade derived from the Latin for "hundred steps". For years it was simply referred to as the Swedish thermometer.

Celsius conducted many geographical measurements for the Swedish General map, and was one of earliest to note that much of Scandinavia is slowly rising above sea level, a continuous process which has been occurring since the melting of the ice from the latest <a href="Quaternary%20glaciation">ice age</a>. However, he wrongly posed the notion that the water was <a href="evaporating">evaporating</a>.

In 1725 he became secretary of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, and served at this post until his death from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in 1744. He supported the formation of the <a href="Royal%20Swedish%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> in 1739 by Linnaeus and five others, and was elected a member at the first meeting of this academy. It was in fact Celsius who proposed the new academy's name.

Adam Carolla

Adam Carolla (born May 27, 1964) is an American comedian, radio personality, television host, actor, podcaster, and director. He hosts "<a href="The%20Adam%20Carolla%20Show%20%28podcast%29">The Adam Carolla Show</a>", a talk show distributed as a <a href="podcast">podcast</a> which set the record as the "most downloaded podcast" as judged by <a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a> in 2011.

Carolla co-hosted the syndicated radio call-in program "<a href="Loveline">Loveline</a>" from 1995 to 2005 as well as the show's television incarnation on <a href="MTV">MTV</a> from 1996 to 2000.

Carolla has also appeared on the network <a href="Reality%20television%23Reality%20competition/game%20shows">reality television programs</a> "<a href="Dancing%20with%20the%20Stars%20%28U.S.%20season%206%29">Dancing with the Stars</a>" and "<a href="The%20Apprentice%20%28U.S.%20season%2012%29">The Celebrity Apprentice</a>". His book "In Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks" debuted on "The New York Times" <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">Best Seller list</a> in 2010, and his second book, "Not Taco Bell Material", also reached "New York Times" bestseller status.

Carolla has made numerous guest appearances on political talk shows as a commentator. He hosted a weekly segment, "Rollin' with Carolla", on <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28political%20commentator%29">Bill O'Reilly</a>'s "<a href="The%20O%27Reilly%20Factor">The O'Reilly Factor</a>".

Adam Carolla was born in <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County">Los Angeles County</a>, California. His mother's maiden name was McCall. The two separated when Adam was young. Carolla was not given a middle name by his parents; on his driver's license application he listed his middle name as "Lakers" as a joke. The application was processed without notice. His maternal step-grandfather was screenwriter <a href="L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3%20G%C3%B6r%C3%B6g%20%28writer%29">László Görög</a>, who wrote "<a href="The%20Mole%20People%20%28film%29">The Mole People</a>".

Adam was raised in the <a href="North%20Hollywood%2C%20Los%20Angeles">North Hollywood</a> neighborhood of Los Angeles. He attended Colfax Elementary School, <a href="Walter%20Reed%20Middle%20School">Walter Reed Junior High</a>, and <a href="North%20Hollywood%20High%20School">North Hollywood High School</a>. Carolla did not receive his high school diploma until years later as it was held by the school until a library fine was paid. Carolla can be seen paying off the book and receiving his diploma in an episode of his 2005 television show, "The Adam Carolla Project".

During his earlier years, Carolla played <a href="Pop%20Warner%20Little%20Scholars">Pop Warner</a> <a href="American%20football">football</a> for seven years; he later suggested that being involved in sports saved him from a chaotic home life. During his senior year at North Hollywood High School, Carolla distinguished himself in football. In December 1981, he was named to the First Team Offensive Line, Central Valley League, one of 8 leagues at the time in the LA City Section of the California Interscholastic Federation.

He began living on his own at the age of 18. He briefly attended <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Valley%20College">Los Angeles Valley College</a>, a <a href="community%20college">community college</a>, where he was placed on academic probation before dropping out to work in a series of jobs, including carpet cleaner, carpenter, <a href="boxing">boxing</a> instructor, and <a href="traffic%20school">traffic school</a> instructor. Although broke, Carolla, his friends, and roommates owned a 1963 <a href="Cadillac">Cadillac</a> <a href="limousine">limousine</a>.

In the early 1990s, Carolla studied <a href="improvisational%20comedy">improvisational comedy</a> with <a href="The%20Groundlings">The Groundlings</a> and was a member of the <a href="ACME%20Comedy%20Theatre">ACME Comedy Theatre</a> troupe.

In 1994, Carolla volunteered his services as a boxing trainer to prepare <a href="Jimmy%20Kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> for a bout being staged by <a href="KROQ-FM">KROQ-FM</a>'s morning radio program "<a href="Kevin%20and%20Bean">Kevin and Bean</a>". Kimmel was a regular on the show as "Jimmy the Sports Guy" and he was set to fight another KROQ personality in a boxing exhibition which was being billed as the "Bleeda in Reseda." Carolla parlayed this opportunity into a long-running friendship and business partnership with Kimmel as well as a recurring role on "Kevin and Bean" as cranky woodshop teacher, Mr. Birchum.

In October 1995, after being signed to the <a href="William%20Morris%20Endeavor">William Morris Agency</a> by <a href="Mark%20Itkin">Mark Itkin</a>, Carolla was offered the job of co-hosting the radio call-in show "<a href="Loveline">Loveline</a>." His co-hosts were the physician <a href="Drew%20Pinsky">Drew Pinsky</a> ("Dr. Drew") and <a href="Riki%20Rachtman">Riki Rachtman</a>. Carolla received the offer after Pinsky heard him on "Kevin and Bean" (Rachtman left the show the following year.) "Loveline" is broadcast on <a href="KROQ-FM">KROQ-FM</a> in Los Angeles and is syndicated nationwide on the <a href="Westwood%20One%20%281976%E2%80%932011%29">Westwood One</a> radio network.

While the format of the program was primarily a call-in show where listeners would ask questions about sex and relationships, Carolla would often spend much of the show ranting about various topics, from fart jokes to extended parodies of radio morning shows, including mocking the format's penchant for useless and repetitive weather and traffic reports. In contrast to the reserved, thoughtful Pinsky, Carolla served as the loud, funny side of the show. Carolla's character was described by one reviewer as "a toned-down version of <a href="Howard%20Stern">Howard Stern</a> minus the huge ego". On September 25, 2001 Carolla and Jimmy Kimmel both had filled in for Howard Stern's head writer <a href="Jackie%20Martling">Jackie Martling</a> after Martling's departure from the show in March 2001. Carolla had mentioned in various interviews and on his podcast that he was offered the job to replace Jackie Martling, but turned it down primarily due to Stern's show being located in New York as well as his commitment to "Loveline".

In October 2005, Carolla was announced as the host of a new morning radio show on the <a href="Infinity%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Infinity Broadcasting</a> network. His new show would replace the popular syndicated <a href="The%20Howard%20Stern%20Show">Howard Stern Show</a> (which was moving to <a href="satellite%20radio">satellite radio</a>) in twelve of the 27 markets in which Stern had been broadcast including <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas</a>, <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix</a> and <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. "The Adam Carolla Show" debuted in January 2006.

In early 2009, actor <a href="Gerard%20Butler">Gerard Butler</a> sat in and observed Adam Carolla on "<a href="The%20Adam%20Carolla%20Show%20%28terrestrial%20radio%29">The Adam Carolla Show</a>" in order to prepare for his role in <a href="The%20Ugly%20Truth">The Ugly Truth</a> as the cynical and crass talk-radio host Mike Chadway allegedly based on Adam Carolla.

On February 18, 2009, <a href="The%20Adam%20Carolla%20Show%20%28radio%29">The Adam Carolla Show</a> was canceled as part of a format switch at <a href="KAMP-FM">KLSX</a> to AMP FM, a new top 40 station. The final show was Friday, February 20, 2009.

Carolla started a daily podcast on February 23, 2009, at his personal website, which would evolve into the <a href="ACE%20Broadcasting%20Network">ACE Broadcasting Network</a>. The first Adam Carolla podcast was downloaded more than 250,000 times in the initial 24 hours, and by the third podcast, it was the number one podcast on iTunes in both the U.S. and Canada. During the debut week, the Adam Carolla podcast recorded 1.6 million downloads. In the second week it recorded 2.4 million downloads. By the fourth episode of the second week, featuring former <a href="The%20Adam%20Carolla%20Show%20%28terrestrial%20radio%29">Adam Carolla Show</a> sidekick <a href="Dave%20Dameshek">Dave Dameshek</a>, the show was downloaded more than 500,000 times. Adam stated that <a href="Bandwidth%20%28computing%29">bandwidth</a> cost more than $9,000 a month as of May 2009.

At the end of 2009, The Adam Carolla Podcast was selected by iTunes for its end-of-the-year awards as the Best Audio Podcast of 2009. On May 18, 2011, Carolla made the claim on <a href="Jimmy%20Kimmel%20Live%21">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a> that The Adam Carolla Show had taken the <a href="Guinness%20World%20Record">Guinness World Record</a> for the most downloaded podcast ever from <a href="Ricky%20Gervais">Ricky Gervais</a> after he claims it received 59,574,843 unique downloads from March 2009 to March 16, 2011.

In a case that has been referred to as <a href="patent%20trolling">patent trolling</a>, patent holding company <a href="Personal%20Audio%20LLC%20%28Patent%20holding%20company%29">Personal Audio</a> sued, among others, Adam Carolla, claiming a patent on "an audio program and message distribution system in which a host system organizes and transmits program segments to client subscriber locations".

After co-hosting (with Dr. Drew) a television version of Loveline on MTV during the late 90s, Carolla began his first original television series with "<a href="The%20Man%20Show">The Man Show</a>", along with partner and close friend <a href="Jimmy%20Kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a>, on <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a> from 1999 to 2003. He left "The Man Show" at the same time as Kimmel, after having been reportedly offered $50,000 per episode to stay on. Carolla has continued his work with Kimmel as a writer and guest on "<a href="Jimmy%20Kimmel%20Live%21">Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a>". He also appeared on an episode of "<a href="Space%20Ghost%20Coast%20to%20Coast">Space Ghost Coast to Coast</a>" around this time.

Carolla and partner <a href="Daniel%20Kellison">Daniel Kellison</a> are the heads of <a href="Jackhole%20Productions">Jackhole Productions</a>. The two created the television show "<a href="Crank%20Yankers">Crank Yankers</a>" for Comedy Central, which revived the Mr. Birchum character. (The show premiered in 2002 on Comedy Central and returned to MTV2 on February 9, 2007, running again until March 30, 2007. The show screened in Australia on SBS Television and The Comedy Channel between 2003 and 2008.)

From August 2005 to November 2005, Carolla hosted the talk show "<a href="Too%20Late%20with%20Adam%20Carolla">Too Late with Adam Carolla</a>" on Comedy Central.

Also in 2005, Carolla was featured in a home remodeling program called "<a href="The%20Adam%20Carolla%20Project">The Adam Carolla Project</a>" wherein he and a crew of old friends renovated his childhood home. The 13 episodes aired on the cable channel TLC (The Learning Channel) from October through December 2005. The house was then sold for 1.2 million dollars.

In 2006, Carolla appeared on the special summer series "<a href="Gameshow%20Marathon%20%28US%20TV%20series%29">Gameshow Marathon</a>" as a celebrity panelist on the <a href="Match%20Game">Match Game</a> episode.

On the February 18, 2008 broadcast of his radio show, Carolla announced that he would be one of the contestants on the next season of "<a href="Dancing%20with%20the%20Stars%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Dancing with the Stars</a>". Later in the broadcast, it was revealed to Adam that his partner would be <a href="Julianne%20Hough">Julianne Hough</a>. He was voted off on the April 8, 2008 episode after his performance of the <a href="Paso%20Doble">Paso Doble</a>, after incorporating a demonstration of unicycle riding in his dance routine.

On June 16, 2008 Carolla was selected to host a pilot of an American version of the popular <a href="BBC">BBC</a> show "<a href="Top%20Gear%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Top Gear</a>" for <a href="NBC">NBC</a>. In December 2008, <a href="NBC">NBC</a> decided not to pick up the show.

On February 21, 2009, a day after his Los Angeles-based morning radio show was canceled — as part of a format change at KLSX-FM — CBS ordered a comedy pilot starring the actor/comedian. "Ace in the Hole" was to star Carolla as a husband and father who works as a driving instructor. Carolla created and wrote the pilot with Kevin Hench ("Jimmy Kimmel Live!"). Carolla stated that <a href="Pamela%20Adlon">Pamela Adlon</a> was to play his wife and <a href="Windell%20Middlebrooks">Windell Middlebrooks</a> of the Miller High Life commercial fame will play his best friend. During his March 30, 2009, podcast, Carolla briefly described the show as being ""<a href="All%20in%20the%20Family">All in the Family</a>", essentially", with Carolla playing a similar role to that of <a href="Archie%20Bunker">Archie Bunker</a>. On the July 23, 2009, episode of the Adam Carolla Podcast, Carolla announced that CBS was not picking up the pilot for the 2009 season, "in any way, shape or form."

On October 22, 2009, it was reported in "Variety" that Carolla had struck a deal with NBC to produce a half-hour pilot for a sitcom. The report was later confirmed on January 4, 2010, and was the first comedy pilot ordered by NBC for the season. The untitled project, written by Carolla and Kevin Hench, was a single-camera endeavor that starred Carolla as a contractor and father who attempts to rebuild his life after his wife leaves him. Carolla was set to executive produce the NBC project along with frequent collaborators Kimmel and Hench, as well as his agent James "Babydoll" Dixon, Jon Pollack from "<a href="30%20Rock">30 Rock</a>", Gail Berman, Daniel Kellison, and Lloyd Braun. Universal Media Studios, BermanBraun, and Carolla and Jimmy Kimmel's own Jackhole Industries.

On the February 13, 2010 episode of Carolla's CarCast podcast, he broke the news that The History Channel had picked up "Top Gear US", which NBC had decided against in 2008. On the March 26, 2010, episode of CarCast, Carolla said that he would not be co-hosting "Top Gear US" because of scheduling conflicts with his NBC sitcom project. In June 2010, Carolla said that his NBC pilot had not been picked up and was now "dead."

Premiering on February 19, 2012, Carolla was also one of the contestants in the 12th season of <a href="NBC">NBC</a>'s "<a href="The%20Apprentice%20%28U.S.%20season%2012%29">The Celebrity Apprentice</a>". He was fired in Week 4, because Mr. Trump perceived that Carolla did not utilize Andretti's car background during a Buick presentation, even though it was clear that Andretti did not like public speaking.

Carolla's "The Car Show" debuted on Speed TV July 13, 2011. Appearing Wednesdays at 10 pm Eastern, it featured Carolla as the host, along with <a href="Dan%20Neil">Dan Neil</a>, <a href="John%20Salley">John Salley</a>, and Matt Farah. It had a format similar to <a href="Top%20Gear%20%282002%20TV%20series%29">Top Gear</a>, mixing car reviews, tests and humor. The show was initially met with largely positive reviews from car enthusiasts and comedy fans. Talk show host and comedian <a href="Jay%20Leno">Jay Leno</a> called The Car Show, "...a lot of fun."
The Car Show was cancelled after one season, after undergoing format changes due to low ratings, as Carolla mentioned on his podcast January 13, 2012.

"<a href="Catch%20a%20Contractor">Catch a Contractor</a>" is a non-scripted, original series on <a href="Spike%20%28TV%20network%29">Spike</a>, hosted by Adam Carolla along with "no-nonsense contractor" Skip Bedell and his wife, investigator Alison Bedell.

The comments were met with anger in Hawaii and resulted in "Loveline"'s cancellation on Hawaiian affiliate KPOI.

On the April 4, 2010, episode of "<a href="The%20Adam%20Carolla%20Show%20%28podcast%29">The Adam Carolla Show</a>", Carolla referred to Filipino boxer <a href="Manny%20Pacquiao">Manny Pacquiao</a> as a "fucking idiot" and said of the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>: "They got this and sex tours, that's all they have over there. Get your shit together, Philippines." A spokesman for President <a href="Gloria%20Macapagal-Arroyo">Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo</a> called Carolla an "ignorant fool." Carolla subsequently apologized via Twitter.

In 2010, Carolla posed for the <a href="NOH8%20Campaign">NOH8 campaign</a>. In August 2011, Carolla released a podcast where he mocked a petition to the producers of "<a href="Sesame%20Street">Sesame Street</a>" that demanded <a href="Bert%20and%20Ernie">Bert and Ernie</a> get married on air. He said on air that gay activists should "[j]ust get married, and please shut up" and that "Y.U.C.K." would be more memorable acronym than <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a>, and referring to <a href="transgender">transgender</a> people he asked: "When did we start giving a shit about these people?"

The <a href="Gay%20%26amp%3B%20Lesbian%20Alliance%20Against%20Defamation">Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation</a> characterized the previous remarks by Carolla as offensive, including an assertion that "all things being equal," heterosexual parents make better parents than homosexual parents. Carolla responded: "I'm sorry my comments were hurtful. I'm a comedian, not a politician." GLAAD called the apology "empty."

In June 2012, Carolla became the target of charges of sexism due to his remarks during an interview published in the "New York Post":

Carolla's comments were widely reported and criticized as sexist. Carolla criticized coverage of his comments as overly simplistic and misleading.

On September 28, 2002, Carolla married Lynette Paradise. Lynette gave birth to their first children, twins Natalia and Santino "Sonny" Richard Carolla on June 7, 2006.
On "<a href="The%20Adam%20Carolla%20Show%20%28terrestrial%20radio%29">The Adam Carolla Show</a>", Adam repeatedly mentioned the birth was originally scheduled for June 6, but that he and Lynette decided to push it back one day as to avoid the symbolic <a href="Number%20of%20the%20Beast">666</a> (<a href="June%202006%236%20June%202006">06–06–06</a>).

Carolla is a part owner of Amalfi, an Italian restaurant in Los Angeles.

Carolla won the 2013 <a href="Toyota%20Pro/Celebrity%20Race">Pro/Celebrity Race</a> as a professional and the 2012 <a href="Toyota%20Pro/Celebrity%20Race">Pro/Celebrity Race</a> at the <a href="Toyota%20Grand%20Prix%20of%20Long%20Beach">Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach</a> as an amateur. The race was run on April 14, 2012 and was broadcast on <a href="Speed%20TV">Speed TV</a>. In 2013, Carolla again competed in the Toyota Grand Prix race, this time he raced as a pro-driver. Carolla finished first in the Pro category in the 2013 race Carolla has previously participated in the race in 2010 and 2003. He finished ninth among 19 racers (fifth among the ten celebrities) in 2010 despite being regarded as a pre-race favorite. He is also a serious automobile collector with over 20 cars. His collection includes several <a href="Lamborghini">Lamborghini</a>s from the 1960s and early 1970s, including two <a href="Lamborghini%20Miura">Miuras</a> (of 764 examples ever produced), one of which he has loaned to the <a href="Petersen%20Automotive%20Museum">Petersen Automotive Museum</a> in Los Angeles, two <a href="Lamborghini%20400GT">400GT 2+2s</a> (of 247 units produced) and a 1965 <a href="Lamborghini%20350GT">350GT</a> (one of 135 built). At least one <a href="Ferrari">Ferrari</a> and <a href="Aston%20Martin">Aston Martin</a> and several vintage race cars round out the collection.

Carolla conceived the fortified wine cocktail '<a href="Mangria">Mangria</a>' (a pun on <a href="sangria">sangria</a>), which later became commercialized with the Napa Valley-based "Patio Wine Company" as a partner.

Regarding his religious beliefs, Carolla has stated, "I am not <a href="Agnosticism">agnostic</a>. I am <a href="Atheism">atheist</a>. I don't think there is no God; I know there's no God. I know there's no God the same way I know many other laws in our universe. I know there's no God and I know most of the world knows that as well. They just won't admit it because there's another thing they know: they know they're going to die, and it freaks them out. So most people don't have the courage to admit there's no God and they know it. They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if you bring it up they get angry because it freaks them out."

Regarding his political views, Carolla has stated, "I guess I would be <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a>, in the sense that I want a secure border, I'm not into the <a href="Social%20programs%20in%20the%20United%20States">welfare state</a>, I'm not into all those <a href="Supplemental%20Nutrition%20Assistance%20Program">freebie lunch programs</a>. It just kind of demeans people." He goes on to state, however, that he is also in favor of typically <a href="Modern%20liberalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">liberal</a> causes such as the legalization of <a href="Cannabis%20%28drug%29">marijuana</a> and support for as well some <a href="Progressivism%20in%20the%20United%20States">progressive</a> causes such as "...  [being] against <a href="Semi-automatic%20firearm">semi-automatic</a> and <a href="Automatic%20firearm">automatic weapons</a>. I'm not an <a href="National%20Rifle%20Association">NRA</a> guy by any stretch of the imagination. I'd like alternative energy to be explored and electric cars to be used, but I want them to be powered by nuclear power plants." (He is a member of the advisory board of the <a href="Marijuana%20Policy%20Project">Marijuana Policy Project</a>.) Elsewhere, he has stated, "My feeling is this whole country is founded on the principle of 'If you are not hurting anyone, and you're not fucking with someone else's shit, and you are paying your <a href="tax">tax</a>es, you should be able to just do what you want to do.' It's the freedom and the independence." In an interview with "<a href="Reason%20%28magazine%29">Reason TV</a>", Carolla described his views as <a href="Libertarianism">libertarian</a>.

Carolla and Pinsky received a <a href="Shine%20Award">Sexual Health In Entertainment (SHINE) Award</a> from <a href="The%20Media%20Project">The Media Project</a> in 2000 for "incorporating accurate and honest portrayals of sexuality" in the talk show category for <a href="Loveline">Loveline</a>.

<a href="Asteroid">Asteroid</a> <a href="4535%20Adamcarolla">4535 Adamcarolla</a> is named in his honor.

Autocorrelation

Autocorrelation, also known as serial correlation, is the <a href="correlation">correlation</a> of a <a href="Signal%20%28information%20theory%29">signal</a> with a delayed copy of itself as a function of delay. Informally, it is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them. The analysis of autocorrelation is a mathematical tool for finding repeating patterns, such as the presence of a <a href="periodic%20signal">periodic signal</a> obscured by <a href="noise%20%28signal%20processing%29">noise</a>, or identifying the <a href="missing%20fundamental%20frequency">missing fundamental frequency</a> in a signal implied by its <a href="harmonic">harmonic</a> frequencies. It is often used in <a href="signal%20processing">signal processing</a> for analyzing functions or series of values, such as <a href="time%20domain">time domain</a> signals.

<a href="Unit%20root">Unit root</a> processes, <a href="trend%20stationary">trend stationary</a> processes, <a href="autoregressive%20process">autoregressive process</a>es, and <a href="moving%20average%20process">moving average process</a>es are specific forms of processes with autocorrelation.

Different fields of study define autocorrelation differently, and not all of these definitions are equivalent. In some fields, the term is used interchangeably with <a href="autocovariance">autocovariance</a>.

In <a href="statistics">statistics</a>, the autocorrelation of a <a href="random%20process">random process</a> is the <a href="Pearson%20correlation%20coefficient">Pearson correlation</a> between values of the process at different times, as a function of the two times or of the time lag. Let "X" be a stochastic process, and "t" be any point in time ("t" may be an <a href="integer">integer</a> for a <a href="discrete-time">discrete-time</a> process or a <a href="real%20number">real number</a> for a <a href="continuous-time">continuous-time</a> process). Then "X" is the value (or <a href="Realization%20%28probability%29">realization</a>) produced by a given <a href="Execution%20%28computing%29">run</a> of the process at time "t". Suppose that the process has <a href="mean">mean</a> "μ" and <a href="variance">variance</a> "σ" at time "t", for each "t". Then the definition of the autocorrelation between times "s" and "t" is

where "E" is the <a href="expected%20value">expected value</a> operator. Note that this expression is not well-defined for all-time series or processes, because the mean may not exist, or the variance may be zero (for a constant process) or infinite (for processes with distribution lacking well-behaved moments, such as certain types of power law). If the function "R" is well-defined, its value must lie in the range [−1, 1], with 1 indicating perfect correlation and −1 indicating perfect <a href="anti-correlation">anti-correlation</a>. 

If "X" is a <a href="wide-sense%20stationary%20process">wide-sense stationary process</a> then the mean "μ" and the variance "σ" are time-independent, and further the autocorrelation depends only on the lag between "t" and "s": the correlation depends only on the time-distance between the pair of values but not on their position in time. This further implies that the autocorrelation can be expressed as a function of the time-lag, and that this would be an <a href="even%20function">even function</a> of the lag "τ" = "s" − "t". This gives the more familiar form

and the fact that this is an <a href="even%20function">even function</a> can be stated as

It is common practice in some disciplines, other than statistics and <a href="time%20series%20analysis">time series analysis</a>, to drop the normalization by "σ" and use the term "autocorrelation" interchangeably with "autocovariance". However, the normalization is important both because the interpretation of the autocorrelation as a correlation provides a scale-free measure of the strength of <a href="statistical%20dependence">statistical dependence</a>, and because the normalization has an effect on the statistical properties of the estimated autocorrelations.

In <a href="signal%20processing">signal processing</a>, the above definition is often used without the normalization, that is, without subtracting the mean and dividing by the variance. When the autocorrelation function is normalized by mean and variance, it is sometimes referred to as the autocorrelation coefficient or autocovariance function.

Given a <a href="Signal%20%28electronics%29">signal</a> formula_4, the continuous autocorrelation formula_5 is most often defined as the continuous cross-correlation integral of formula_4 with itself, at lag formula_7.

where formula_9 represents the <a href="complex%20conjugate">complex conjugate</a>, formula_10 is a function which manipulates the function formula_11 and is defined as formula_12 and formula_13 represents <a href="convolution">convolution</a>.

For a <a href="real%20function">real function</a>, formula_14.

Note that the parameter formula_15 in the integral is a dummy variable and is only necessary to calculate the integral. It has no specific meaning.

The discrete autocorrelation formula_16 at lag formula_17 for a discrete signal formula_18 is

The above definitions work for signals that are square integrable, or square summable, that is, of finite energy. Signals that "last forever" are treated instead as random processes, in which case different definitions are needed, based on expected values. For <a href="stationary%20process">wide-sense-stationary random processes</a>, the autocorrelations are defined as

For processes that are not <a href="Stationary%20process">stationary</a>, these will also be functions of formula_22, or formula_23.

For processes that are also <a href="Ergodic%20process">ergodic</a>, the expectation can be replaced by the limit of a time average. The autocorrelation of an ergodic process is sometimes defined as or equated to

These definitions have the advantage that they give sensible well-defined single-parameter results for periodic functions, even when those functions are not the output of stationary ergodic processes.

Alternatively, signals that "last forever" can be treated by a short-time autocorrelation function analysis, using finite time integrals. (See <a href="short-time%20Fourier%20transform">short-time Fourier transform</a> for a related process.)

Multi-<a href="dimension">dimension</a>al autocorrelation is defined similarly. For example, in <a href="Three-dimensional%20space">three dimensions</a> the autocorrelation of a square-summable <a href="discrete%20signal">discrete signal</a> would be

When mean values are subtracted from signals before computing an autocorrelation function, the resulting function is usually called an auto-covariance function.

In the following, we will describe properties of one-dimensional autocorrelations only, since most properties are easily transferred from the one-dimensional case to the multi-dimensional cases. These properties hold for <a href="Stationary_process%23Weak_or_wide-sense_stationarity">wide-sense stationary processes</a>.




For data expressed as a <a href="Discrete%20signal">discrete</a> sequence, it is frequently necessary to compute the autocorrelation with high <a href="algorithmic%20efficiency">computational efficiency</a>. A brute force method based on the signal processing definition formula_41 can be used when the signal size is small. For example, to calculate the autocorrelation of the real signal sequence formula_42 (i.e. formula_43, and formula_44 for all other values of ) by hand, we first recognize that the definition just given is same as the "usual" multiplication, but with right shifts, where each vertical addition gives the autocorrelation for particular lag values:

Thus the required autocorrelation sequence is formula_46, where formula_47 formula_48 and formula_49 the autocorrelation for other lag values being zero. In this calculation we do not perform the carry-over operation during addition as is usual in normal multiplication. Note that we can halve the number of operations required by exploiting the inherent symmetry of the autocorrelation. If the signal happens to be periodic, i.e. formula_50 then we get a circular autocorrelation (similar to <a href="circular%20convolution">circular convolution</a>) where the left and right tails of the previous autocorrelation sequence will overlap and give formula_51 which has the same period as the signal sequence formula_52 The procedure can be regarded as an application of the convolution property of <a href="z-transform">z-transform</a> of a discrete signal.

While the brute force algorithm is <a href="Big%20O%20notation">order</a> , several efficient algorithms exist which can compute the autocorrelation in order . For example, the <a href="Wiener%E2%80%93Khinchin%20theorem">Wiener–Khinchin theorem</a> allows computing the autocorrelation from the raw data with two <a href="Fast%20Fourier%20transform">Fast Fourier transform</a>s (FFT):

where IFFT denotes the inverse <a href="Fast%20Fourier%20transform">Fast Fourier transform</a>. The asterisk denotes <a href="complex%20conjugate">complex conjugate</a>.

Alternatively, a multiple correlation can be performed by using brute force calculation for low values, and then progressively binning the data with a <a href="logarithm">logarithm</a>ic density to compute higher values, resulting in the same efficiency, but with lower memory requirements.

For a <a href="Discrete%20signal">discrete</a> process with known mean and variance for which we observe formula_23 observations formula_55, an estimate of the autocorrelation may be obtained as

for any positive integer formula_57. When the true mean formula_58 and variance formula_59 are known, this estimate is <a href="Biased%20estimator">unbiased</a>. If the true mean and <a href="variance">variance</a> of the process are not known there are a several possibilities:
The advantage of estimates of the last type is that the set of estimated autocorrelations, as a function of formula_66, then form a function which is a valid autocorrelation in the sense that it is possible to define a theoretical process having exactly that autocorrelation. Other estimates can suffer from the problem that, if they are used to calculate the variance of a linear combination of the formula_67's, the variance calculated may turn out to be negative. 

In <a href="regression%20analysis">regression analysis</a> using <a href="time%20series%20analysis">time series data</a>, autocorrelation in a variable of interest is typically modeled either with an <a href="autoregressive%20model">autoregressive model</a> (AR), a <a href="moving%20average%20model">moving average model</a> (MA), their combination as an <a href="autoregressive%20moving%20average%20model">autoregressive moving average model</a> (ARMA), or an extension of the latter called an <a href="autoregressive%20integrated%20moving%20average%20model">autoregressive integrated moving average model</a> (ARIMA). With multiple interrelated data series, <a href="vector%20autoregression">vector autoregression</a> (VAR) or its extensions are used.

In <a href="ordinary%20least%20squares">ordinary least squares</a> (OLS), the adequacy of a model specification can be checked in part by establishing whether there is autocorrelation of the <a href="errors%20and%20residuals%20in%20statistics">regression residuals</a>. 
Problematic autocorrelation of the errors, which themselves are unobserved, can generally be detected because it produces autocorrelation in the observable residuals. (Errors are also known as "error terms" in <a href="econometrics">econometrics</a>.) Autocorrelation of the errors violates the ordinary least squares assumption that the error terms are uncorrelated, meaning that the <a href="Gauss%E2%80%93Markov%20theorem">Gauss Markov theorem</a> does not apply, and that OLS estimators are no longer the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE). While it does not bias the OLS coefficient estimates, the <a href="Standard%20error%20%28statistics%29">standard errors</a> tend to be underestimated (and the <a href="T-statistics">t-scores</a> overestimated) when the autocorrelations of the errors at low lags are positive.

The traditional test for the presence of first-order autocorrelation is the <a href="Durbin%E2%80%93Watson%20statistic">Durbin–Watson statistic</a> or, if the explanatory variables include a lagged dependent variable, <a href="Durbin%E2%80%93Watson%20statistic%23Durbin%20h-statistic">Durbin's h statistic</a>. The Durbin-Watson can be linearly mapped however to the Pearson correlation between values and their lags. A more flexible test, covering autocorrelation of higher orders and applicable whether or not the regressors include lags of the dependent variable, is the <a href="Breusch%E2%80%93Godfrey%20test">Breusch–Godfrey test</a>. This involves an auxiliary regression, wherein the residuals obtained from estimating the model of interest are regressed on (a) the original regressors and (b) "k" lags of the residuals, where "k" is the order of the test. The simplest version of the test statistic from this
auxiliary regression is "TR", where "T" is the sample size and "R" is the <a href="coefficient%20of%20determination">coefficient of determination</a>. Under the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation, this statistic is
asymptotically distributed as formula_68 with "k" degrees of freedom.

Responses to nonzero autocorrelation include <a href="generalized%20least%20squares">generalized least squares</a> and the <a href="Newey%20West">Newey–West HAC estimator</a> (Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent).

In the estimation of a <a href="moving%20average%20model">moving average model</a> (MA), the autocorrelation function is used to determine the appropriate number of lagged error terms to be included. This is based on the fact that for an MA process of order "q", we have formula_69, for formula_70, and formula_71, for formula_72.



Serial dependence is closely linked to the notion of autocorrelation, but represents a distinct concept (see <a href="Correlation%20and%20dependence">Correlation and dependence</a>). In particular, it is possible to have serial dependence but no (linear) correlation. In some fields however, the two terms are used as synonyms.

A <a href="time%20series">time series</a> of a <a href="random%20variable">random variable</a> has serial dependence if the value at some time "t" in the series is <a href="Statistical%20independence">statistically dependent</a> on the value at another time "s". A series is serially independent if there is no dependence between any pair.

If a time series {"X"} is <a href="Stationary%20process">stationary</a>, then statistical dependence between the pair ("X , X") would imply that there is statistical dependence between all pairs of values at the same lag "s"−"t".

Atlas Autocode

Atlas Autocode (AA) was a <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a> developed around 1965 at <a href="Manchester%20University">Manchester University</a>. A variant of the <a href="ALGOL">ALGOL</a> <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a>, it was developed by <a href="Tony%20Brooker">Tony Brooker</a> and Derrick Morris for the <a href="Atlas%20Computer">Atlas Computer</a>. 

("Autocode" was basically an early term for "programming language"; different autocodes could be totally different).

It removed some Algol features such as "<a href="Call%20by%20name%23Call%20by%20name">passing parameters by name</a>" (which in Algol 60 means passing the address of a short subroutine to recalculate the parameter each time it was mentioned). 

It featured explicitly typed variables, subroutines, and functions. 

The AA compiler generated range-checking for array accesses, and allowed an array to have dimensions that were determined at run-time (i.e. you could declare an array as codice_1, where codice_2 and codice_3 were calculated values).

<a href="Machine%20code">Machine code</a> could be included within the high-level AA routines either to make an inner loop more efficient or to effect some operation which could not easily be done otherwise.

Atlas Autocode included a codice_4 data type to represent <a href="complex%20number">complex number</a>s, partly because of pressure from the <a href="electrical%20engineering">electrical engineering</a> department, as complex numbers are used to represent the behavior of <a href="alternating%20current">alternating current</a>. The square root of -1 was represented by codice_2, which was treated as a fixed complex constant = "i".

The codice_4 data type was dropped when Atlas Autocode later evolved into the <a href="Edinburgh%20IMP">Edinburgh IMP</a> programming language. (Imp was an extension of AA and was used to write the <a href="Edinburgh%20Multiple%20Access%20System">EMAS</a> <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>.)

Atlas Autocode's second-greatest claim to fame (after being the progenitor of Imp and EMAS) was that it had many of the features of the original "<a href="Compiler-compiler">Compiler Compiler</a>". A variant of the AA compiler included run-time support for a top-down <a href="recursive%20descent%20parser">recursive descent parser</a>. The style of parser used in the Compiler Compiler was in use continuously at Edinburgh from the 60's until almost the turn of the millennium.

Other <a href="Autocode">Autocode</a>s were developed for the <a href="Titan%20%28computer%29">Titan computer</a>, a prototype Atlas 2 at Cambridge, and the <a href="Ferranti">Ferranti</a> Mercury.

Atlas Autocode's syntax was largely similar to Algol, though it was influenced by the output device which the author had available, a <a href="Friden%2C%20Inc.">Friden Flexowriter</a>. Consequently, it allowed symbols like "½" for ".5" and the superscript for "to the power of 2". The Flexowriter supported overstriking and therefore AA did as well — up to three characters could be overstruck as a single symbol. For example, the character set had no "↑" symbol, so exponentiation was an overstrike of "|" and "*". The aforementioned underlining of keywords could also be done using overstriking. The language is described in detail in the <a href="http%3A//history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/docs/atlasautocode.html">Atlas Autocode Reference Manual</a>.

Other Flexowriter characters that were found a use in Atlas Autocode were: codice_7 in floating-point numbers, "e.g.", codice_8 for modern codice_9 ; codice_10 to mean "the second half of a 48-bit Atlas memory <a href="Word%20%28data%20type%29">word</a>"; codice_11 for the mathematical constant <a href="pi">pi</a>.

When AA was ported to the <a href="English%20Electric%20KDF9">English Electric KDF9</a> computer, the character set was changed to <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization">ISO</a> and that compiler has been recovered from an old paper tape by the <a href="http%3A//history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/">Edinburgh Computer History Project</a> and is available online, as is a high-quality scan of the original Edinburgh version of the Atlas Autocode manual.

Keywords in AA were distinguishable from other text by being underlined, which was implemented via overstrike in the Flexowriter (compare to bold in Algol). There were also two <a href="Stropping%20%28syntax%29">stropping</a> regimes. First, there was an "uppercasedelimiters" mode where all uppercase letters (outside strings) were treated as underlined lowercase. Second, in some versions (but not in the original Atlas version), it was possible to strop keywords by placing a "codice_12" sign in front of them, for example the keyword codice_13 could be typed as codice_14 or codice_15. This significantly reduced typing, due to only needing one character, rather than overstriking the whole keyword. As in Algol, there were no <a href="reserved%20word">reserved word</a>s in the language as keywords were identified by underlining (or stropping), not by recognising reserved character sequences. In the statement codice_16, there is both a keyword codice_17 and a variable named codice_17.

As in Algol, AA allowed spaces in variable names, such as codice_19. Spaces were not significant and were removed before parsing in a trivial pre-lexing stage called "<a href="line%20reconstruction">line reconstruction</a>". What the compiler would see in the above example would be "codice_20". Spaces were possible due partly to keywords being distinguished in other ways, and partly because the source was processed by a <a href="scannerless%20parser">scannerless parser</a>, without a separate lexing phase, which allowed the lexical syntax to be context-sensitive.

The syntax for expressions let the multiplication operator be omitted, e.g. codice_21 was treated as codice_22, and codice_23 was treated as codice_24 if codice_25 was not an array. In ambiguous usages, the longest possible name was taken (<a href="maximal%20munch">maximal munch</a>), for example codice_26 was not treated as codice_27, whether or not codice_25 and codice_29 had been declared.

In the original Atlas Autocode for the Atlas computer, Atlas machine code instructions could be interpolated between the Atlas Autocode statements.

Although the format now supports many <a href="digital%20audio">audio encoding</a> formats, it remains associated with the <a href="mu-law">µ-law</a> logarithmic encoding. This encoding was native to the <a href="SPARCstation%201">SPARCstation 1</a> hardware, where <a href="SunOS">SunOS</a> exposed the encoding to application programs through the /dev/audio interface. This encoding and interface became a <a href="de%20facto">de facto</a> standard for <a href="Unix">Unix</a> sound.

All fields are stored in <a href="big-endian">big-endian</a> format, including the sample data.

The type of encoding depends on the value of the "encoding" field (word 3 of the header). Formats 2 through 7 are uncompressed linear <a href="Pulse-code%20modulation">PCM</a>, therefore technically <a href="lossless">lossless</a> (although not necessarily free of quantisation error, especially in 8-bit form). Formats 1 and 27 are <a href="%CE%BC-law%20algorithm">μ-law</a> and <a href="A-law">A-law</a>, respectively, both <a href="companding">companding</a> logarithmic representations of PCM, and arguably lossy as they pack what would otherwise be almost 16 bits of dynamic range into 8 bits of encoded data, even though this is achieved by an altered dynamic response and no data is actually "thrown away". Formats 23 through 26 are ADPCM, which is an early form of <a href="lossy%20compression">lossy compression</a>, usually but not always with 4 bits of encoded data per audio sample (for 4:1 efficiency with 16-bit input, or 2:1 with 8-bit; equivalent to e.g. encoding CD quality MP3 at a 352kbit rate using a low quality encoder). Several of the others are <a href="digital%20signal%20processing">DSP</a> commands or data, designed to be processed by the <a href="NeXT">NeXT</a> <a href="Music%20Kit">Music Kit</a> software.

Note: PCM formats are encoded as signed data (as opposed to unsigned).

Following the header structure is a variable-length annotation field. The contents of this field are currently undefined, except that its length must be a multiple of eight bytes and it must be terminated with at least one null (zero) byte. The audio data segment begins on an eight-byte boundary immediately following the annotation field. Audio data is encoded in the format identified by the file header. The current implementation supports only a single audio data segment per file. The variable-length annotation field is currently ignored by most audio applications.

Andalusia

Andalusia (; ) is an <a href="Autonomous%20communities%20of%20Spain">autonomous community</a> in southern <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. It is the most populated and the second largest in area of the autonomous communities in the country. The Andalusian autonomous community is officially recognised as <a href="Nationalities%20and%20regions%20of%20Spain">"historical nationality"</a>. The territory is divided into eight <a href="Provinces%20of%20Spain">provinces</a>: <a href="Province%20of%20Almer%C3%ADa">Almería</a>, <a href="Province%20of%20C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a>, <a href="Province%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba%20%28Spain%29">Córdoba</a>, <a href="Province%20of%20Granada">Granada</a>, <a href="Province%20of%20Huelva">Huelva</a>, <a href="Province%20of%20Ja%C3%A9n%20%28Spain%29">Jaén</a>, <a href="Province%20of%20M%C3%A1laga">Málaga</a> and <a href="Province%20of%20Seville">Seville</a>. Its capital is the city of <a href="Seville">Seville</a> (Spanish: "Sevilla").

Andalusia is in the south of the <a href="Iberian%20peninsula">Iberian peninsula</a>, in south-western Europe, immediately south of the autonomous communities of <a href="Extremadura">Extremadura</a> and <a href="Castilla-La%20Mancha">Castilla-La Mancha</a>; west of the autonomous community of <a href="Region%20of%20Murcia">Murcia</a> and the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>; east of <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> and the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>; and north of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> and the <a href="Strait%20of%20Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a>. Andalusia is the only European region with both Mediterranean and Atlantic coastlines. The small <a href="British%20overseas%20territory">British overseas territory</a> of <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> shares a three-quarter-mile land border with the Andalusian <a href="province%20of%20C%C3%A1diz">province of Cádiz</a> at the eastern end of the Strait of Gibraltar.

The main mountain ranges of Andalusia are the <a href="Sierra%20Morena">Sierra Morena</a> and the <a href="Baetic%20System">Baetic System</a>, consisting of the <a href="Subbaetic%20System">Subbaetic</a> and <a href="Penibaetic%20System">Penibaetic</a> Mountains, separated by the <a href="Intrabaetic%20Basin">Intrabaetic Basin</a>. In the north, the Sierra Morena separates Andalusia from the plains of Extremadura and Castile–La Mancha on Spain's <a href="Meseta%20Central">Meseta Central</a>. To the south the geographic subregion of Upper Andalusia lies mostly within the <a href="Baetic%20System">Baetic System</a>, while Lower Andalusia is in the <a href="Baetic%20Depression">Baetic Depression</a> of the valley of the <a href="Guadalquivir">Guadalquivir</a>.

The name "Andalusia" is derived from the <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> word "<a href="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a>" (الأندلس). The toponym "al-Andalus" is first attested by inscriptions on coins minted in 716 by the new Muslim government of Iberia. These coins, called "<a href="dinars">dinars</a>", were inscribed in both <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> and <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>. The etymology of the name ""al-Andalus"" has traditionally been derived from the name of the "<a href="Vandals">Vandals</a>"; however, a number of proposals since the 1980s have challenged this contention. Halm in 1989 derived the name from a Gothic term, "*landahlauts",
and in 2002, Bossong suggested its derivation from a pre-Roman substrate. The region's history and culture have been influenced by the <a href="Iberians">native Iberians</a>, <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>ns, <a href="Ancient%20Carthage">Carthaginians</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greeks</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>, <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a>, <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a>, <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantines</a>,
<a href="Jews%20in%20Spain">Jews</a>, <a href="Romani%20people%20in%20Spain">Romani</a>, <a href="Moors">Muslim Moors</a> and the <a href="Castilian%20people">Castilian</a> and other <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> North Iberian nationalities who reconquered and settled the area in the latter phases of the "<a href="Reconquista">Reconquista</a>".

Andalusia has been a traditionally agricultural region, compared to the rest of Spain and the rest of Europe. However, the growth of the community especially in the sectors of industry and services was above average in Spain and higher than many communities in the <a href="Eurozone">Eurozone</a>. The region has a rich culture and a strong identity. Many cultural phenomena that are seen internationally as distinctively Spanish are largely or entirely Andalusian in origin. These include <a href="flamenco">flamenco</a> and, to a lesser extent, <a href="Spanish-style%20bullfighting">bullfighting</a> and <a href="Moorish%20architecture">Hispano-Moorish</a> <a href="Mud%C3%A9jar">architectural styles</a> both of which are also prevalent in other regions of Spain.

Andalusia's hinterland is the hottest area of Europe, with cities like <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Andalusia">Córdoba</a> and <a href="Seville">Seville</a> averaging above 36 °C (97 °F) in summer high temperatures. Late evening temperatures can sometimes stay around 35 °C (95 °F) until close to midnight, with daytime highs of over 40 °C (104 °F) common. Seville also has the highest average annual temperature in mainland Spain and mainland Europe (19.2 °C), closely followed by Almería (19.1 °C).

Its present form is derived the Arabic name for Muslim Iberia, "Al-Andalus". However, the <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of the name "Al-Andalus" is disputed, and the extent of Iberian territory encompassed by the name has changed over the centuries.

The Spanish place name "Andalucía" (immediate source of the English "Andalusia") was introduced into the <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish language</a>s in the 13th century under the form "el Andalucía". The name was adopted to refer to those territories still under Moorish rule, and generally south of <a href="New%20Castile%20%28Spain%29">Castilla Nueva</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Valencia">Valencia</a>, and corresponding with the former Roman province hitherto called <a href="Baetica">Baetica</a> in Latin sources. This was a Castilianization of "Al-Andalusiya", the <a href="adjective">adjectival</a> form of the Arabic language "al-Andalus", the name given by the Arabs to all of the Iberian territories under Muslim rule from 711 to 1492. The etymology of "al-Andalus" is itself somewhat debated (see <a href="al-Andalus">al-Andalus</a>), but in fact it entered the Arabic language before this area came under Muslim rule.

Like the Arabic term "al-Andalus", in historical contexts the Spanish term "Andalucía" or the English term "Andalusia" do not necessarily refer to the exact territory designated by these terms today. Initially, the term referred exclusively to territories under Muslim control; later, it was applied to some of the last Iberian territories to be regained from the Muslims, though not always to exactly the same ones. In the "<a href="Estoria%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a">Estoria de España</a>" (also known as the "<a href="Primera%20Cr%C3%B3nica%20General">Primera Crónica General</a>") of <a href="Alfonso%20X%20of%20Castile">Alfonso X of Castile</a>, written in the second half of the 13th century, the term "Andalucía" is used with three different meanings:


From an administrative point of view, Granada remained separate for many years even after the completion of the "Reconquista" due, above all, to its emblematic character as the last territory regained, and as the seat of the important <a href="Audiencia%20Real">Real Chancillería de Granada</a>, a <a href="court%20of%20last%20resort">court of last resort</a>. Still, the reconquest and repopulation of Granada was accomplished largely by people from the three preexisting Christian kingdoms of Andalusia, and Granada came to be considered a fourth kingdom of Andalusia. The often-used expression "<a href="Four%20Kingdoms%20of%20Andalusia">Four Kingdoms of Andalusia</a>" dates back in Spanish at least to the mid-18th century.

The Andalusian coat of arms shows the figure of <a href="Hercules">Hercules</a> and two <a href="lion">lion</a>s between the two <a href="pillars%20of%20Hercules">pillars of Hercules</a> that tradition situates on either side of the Strait of Gibraltar. An inscription below, superimposed on an image of the <a href="flag%20of%20Andalusia">flag of Andalusia</a> reads "Andalucía por sí, para España y la Humanidad" ("Andalusia for herself, Spain and Humanity"). Over the two columns is a semicircular arch in the colors of the flag of Andalusia, with the <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> words "Dominator Hercules Fundator" (Lord Hercules is the Founder) superimposed.

The official flag of Andalusia consists of three equal horizontal stripes, colored green, white, and green respectively; the Andalusian coat of arms is superimposed on the central stripe. Its design was overseen by <a href="Blas%20Infante">Blas Infante</a> and approved in the <a href="Assembly%20of%20Ronda">Assembly of Ronda</a> (a 1918 gathering of <a href="Andalusian%20nationalism">Andalusian nationalists</a> at <a href="Ronda">Ronda</a>). The green symbolizes hope and union, and the white symbolizes peace and dialogue. Blas Infante considered these to have been the colors most used in regional symbols throughout the region's history. According to him, the green came in particular from the <a href="banner">standard</a> of the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyad Caliphate</a> and represented the call for a gathering of the populace. The white symbolized pardon in the <a href="Almohad%20dynasty">Almohad dynasty</a>, interpreted in European heraldry as parliament or peace. Other writers have justified the colors differently, with some Andalusian nationalists referring to them as the "Arbonaida", meaning white-and-green in <a href="Mozarabic%20language">Mozarabic</a>, a <a href="Romance%20language">Romance language</a> that was spoken in the region in Muslim times.
The <a href="national%20anthem">anthem</a> of Andalusia was composed by José del Castillo Díaz (director of the Municipal Band of Seville, commonly known as Maestro Castillo) with lyrics by Blas Infante. The music was inspired by "Santo Dios", a popular religious song sung at harvest time by peasants and day laborers in the provinces of Málaga, Seville, and Huelva. Blas Infante brought the song to Maestro Castillo's attention; Maestro Castillo adapted and harmonized the traditional melody. The lyrics appeal to the Andalusians to mobilize and demand "tierra y libertad" ("land and liberty") by way of <a href="agrarian%20reform">agrarian reform</a> and a statute of autonomy within Spain.

The <a href="Parliament%20of%20Andalusia">Parliament of Andalusia</a> voted unanimously in 1983 that the preamble to the <a href="Statute%20of%20Autonomy%20of%20Andalusia">Statute of Autonomy</a> recognize Blas Infante as the Father of the Andalusian Nation ("Padre de la Patria Andaluza"), which was reaffirmed in the reformed Statute of Autonomy submitted to popular <a href="referendum">referendum</a> 18 February 2007. The preamble of the present 2007 Statute of Autonomy says that Article 2 of the present <a href="Spanish%20Constitution%20of%201978">Spanish Constitution of 1978</a> recognizes Andalusia as a <a href="Nationalities%20and%20regions%20of%20Spain">nationality</a>. Later, in its articulation, it speaks of Andalusia as a "historic nationality" (Spanish: "nacionalidad histórica"). It also cites the 1919 Andalusianist Manifesto of Córdoba describing Andalusia as a "national reality" ("realidad nacional"), but does not endorse that formulation. Article 1 of the earlier 1981 Statute of Autonomy defined it simply as a "nationality" ("nacionalidad").

The national holiday, the <a href="D%C3%ADa%20de%20Andaluc%C3%ADa">Día de Andalucía</a>, is celebrated on 28 February, commemorating the 1980 autonomy referendum. In spite of this, nationalist groups celebrate the holiday on 4 December, commemorating the 1977 demonstrations to demand autonomy.

The honorific title of "<a href="Hijo%20Predilecto%20de%20Andaluc%C3%ADa">Hijo Predilecto de Andalucía</a>" ("Favorite Son of Andalucia") is granted by the Regional Government of Andalusia to those whose exceptional merits benefited Andalusia, for work or achievements in natural, social, or political science. It is the highest distinction given by the Autonomous Community of Andalusia.

The Sevillian historian <a href="Antonio%20Dom%C3%ADnguez%20Ortiz">Antonio Domínguez Ortiz</a> wrote that:

Andalusia has a surface area of , 17.3 percent of the territory of Spain. Andalusia alone is comparable in extent and in the variety of its terrain to any of several of the smaller European countries. To the east is the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>; to the west the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>; to the north the <a href="Sierra%20Morena">Sierra Morena</a> constitutes the border with the <a href="Meseta%20Central">Meseta Central</a>; to the south, the <a href="self-governance">self-governing</a> <a href="British%20overseas%20territory">British overseas territory</a> of <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> and the <a href="Strait%20of%20Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a> separate it from <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>.

Andalusia is home to the hottest and driest summers in Spain, but in the west, weather systems sweeping in from the Atlantic ensure that it is relatively wet in the winter, with some areas receiving copious amounts. Contrary to what many people think, as a whole, the region enjoys above average yearly rainfall in the context of Spain.

Andalusia sits at a latitude between 36° and 38° 44' N, in the warm-temperate region. In general, it experiences a <a href="hot-summer%20Mediterranean%20climate">hot-summer Mediterranean climate</a>, with dry summers influenced by the <a href="Azores%20High">Azores High</a>, but subject to occasional torrential rains and extremely hot temperatures. In the winter, the tropical anticyclones move south, allowing cold polar fronts to penetrate the region. Still, within Andalusia there is considerable climatic variety. From the extensive coastal plains one may pass to the valley of the Guadalquivir, barely above sea level, then to the highest altitudes in the Iberian peninsula in the peaks of the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28Spain%29">Sierra Nevada</a>. In a mere one can pass from the subtropical coast of the province of Granada to the snowy peaks of <a href="Mulhac%C3%A9n">Mulhacén</a>. Andalusia also includes both the dry <a href="Tabernas%20Desert">Tabernas Desert</a> in the province of Almería and the <a href="Sierra%20de%20Grazalema%20Natural%20Park">Sierra de Grazalema Natural Park</a> in the province of Cádiz, which experiences Spain's greatest rainfall.

Annual rainfall in the Sierra de Grazalema has been measured as high as in 1963, the highest ever recorded for any location in Iberia. Andalusia is also home to the driest place in continental Europe, the <a href="Cabo%20de%20Gata-N%C3%ADjar%20Natural%20Park">Cabo de Gata</a>, with only of rain per year.

In general, as one goes from west to east, away from the Atlantic, there is less precipitation. "Wet Andalusia" includes most of the highest points in the region, above all the Sierra de Grazalema but also the <a href="Serran%C3%ADa%20de%20Ronda">Serranía de Ronda</a> in western Málaga. The valley of the Guadalquivir has moderate rainfall. The <a href="Tabernas%20Desert">Tabernas Desert</a> in Almería, Europe's only true desert, has less than 75 days with any measurable precipitation, and some particular places in the desert have as few as 50 such days. Much of "dry Andalusia" has more than 300 "sunny" days a year.

The average temperature in Andalusia throughout the year is over . Averages in the cities range from in <a href="Baeza">Baeza</a> to in <a href="Almer%C3%ADa">Almería</a>. Much of the Guadalquivir valley and the Mediterranean coast has an average of about . The coldest month is January when <a href="Granada">Granada</a> at the foot of the Sierra Nevada experiences an average temperature of . The hottest are July and August, with an average temperature of for Andalusia as a whole. <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Andalusia">Córdoba</a> is the hottest provincial capital, followed by <a href="Seville">Seville</a>.

The Guadalquivir valley has experienced the highest temperatures recorded in Europe, with a maximum of recorded at Córdoba and Seville. The mountains of Granada and Jaén have the coldest temperatures in southern Iberia, but do not reach continental extremes (and, indeed are surpassed by some mountains in northern Spain). In the cold snap of January 2005, <a href="Santiago%20de%20la%20Espada">Santiago de la Espada</a> (Jaén) experienced a temperature of and the <a href="ski">ski</a> resort at <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20National%20Park%20%28Spain%29">Sierra Nevada National Park</a>—the southernmost ski resort in Europe—dropped to . Sierra Nevada Natural Park has Iberia's lowest average annual temperature, ( at Pradollano) and its peaks remain snowy practically year-round.

Mountain ranges affect climate, the network of rivers, soils and their erosion, bioregions, and even human economies insofar as they rely on natural resources. The Andalusian terrain offers a range of altitudes and slopes. Andalusia has the Iberian peninsula's highest mountains and nearly 15 percent of its terrain over . The picture is similar for areas under (with the Baetic Depression), and for the variety of slopes.

The Atlantic coast is overwhelmingly beach and gradually sloping coasts; the Mediterranean coast has many cliffs, above all in the Malagan <a href="Axarqu%C3%ADa">Axarquía</a> and in Granada and Almería. This asymmetry divides the region naturally into Upper Andalusia (two mountainous areas) and Lower Andalusia (the broad basin of the Guadalquivir).

The <a href="Sierra%20Morena">Sierra Morena</a> separates Andalusia from the plains of Extremadura and Castile–La Mancha on Spain's <a href="Meseta%20Central">Meseta Central</a>. Although sparsely populated, this is not a particularly high range, and its highest point, the peak of La <a href="Ba%C3%B1uela">Bañuela</a> in the <a href="Sierra%20Madrona">Sierra Madrona</a>, lies outside of Andalusia. Within the Sierra Morena, the <a href="canyon">gorge</a> of <a href="Despe%C3%B1aperros">Despeñaperros</a> forms a natural frontier between Castile and Andalusia.

The <a href="Baetic%20Cordillera">Baetic Cordillera</a> consists of the parallel mountain ranges of the <a href="Cordillera%20Penib%C3%A9tica">Cordillera Penibética</a> near the Mediterranean coast and the <a href="Cordillera%20Subb%C3%A9tica">Cordillera Subbética</a> inland, separated by the <a href="Surco%20Intrab%C3%A9tico">Surco Intrabético</a>. The Cordillera Subbética is quite discontinuous, offering many passes that facilitate transportation, but the Penibético forms a strong barrier between the Mediterranean coast and the interior. The Sierra Nevada, part of the Cordillera Penibética in the Province of Granada, has the highest peaks in Iberia: El <a href="Mulhac%C3%A9n">Mulhacén</a> at and El <a href="Veleta%20%28Sierra%20Nevada%29">Veleta</a> at .

Lower Andalusia, the <a href="Baetic%20Depression">Baetic Depression</a>, the basin of the Guadalquivir, lies between these two mountainous areas. It is a nearly flat territory, open to the <a href="Gulf%20of%20C%C3%A1diz">Gulf of Cádiz</a> in the southeast. Throughout history, this has been the most populous part of Andalusia.

Andalusia has rivers that flow into both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Flowing to the Atlantic are the <a href="Guadiana">Guadiana</a>, <a href="Odiel">Odiel</a>-<a href="R%C3%ADo%20Tinto">Tinto</a>, <a href="Guadalquivir">Guadalquivir</a>, <a href="Guadalete">Guadalete</a>, and <a href="Barbate%20%28river%29">Barbate</a>. Flowing to the Mediterranean are the <a href="Guadiaro%20%28river%29">Guadiaro</a>, <a href="Guadalhorce">Guadalhorce</a>, <a href="Guadalmedina">Guadalmedina</a>, <a href="Guadalfeo">Guadalfeo</a>, <a href="Andarax">Andarax</a> (also known as the Almería) and <a href="Almanzora%20%28river%29">Almanzora</a>. Of these, the <a href="Guadalquivir">Guadalquivir</a> is the longest in Andalusia and fifth longest on the Iberian peninsula, at .
The rivers of the Atlantic basin are characteristically long, run through mostly flat terrain, and have broad river valleys. As a result, at their mouths are <a href="estuary">estuaries</a> and <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s, such as the marshes of <a href="Do%C3%B1ana%20National%20Park">Doñana</a> in the delta of the Guadalquivir, and <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s of the Odiel. In contrast, the rivers of the Mediterranean Basin are shorter, more seasonal, and make a precipitous descent from the mountains of the Baetic Cordillera. Their estuaries are small, and their valleys are less suitable for agriculture. Also, being in the <a href="rain%20shadow">rain shadow</a> of the Baetic Cordillera means that they receive a lesser volume of water.

The following hydrographic basins can be distinguished in Andalusia. On the Atlantic side are the Guadalquivir basin; the <a href="Andalusian%20Atlantic%20Basin">Andalusian Atlantic Basin</a> with the sub-basins Guadalete-Barbate and Tinto-Odiel; and the Guadiana basin. On the Mediterranean side is the <a href="Andalusian%20Mediterranean%20Basin">Andalusian Mediterranean Basin</a> and the very upper portion of the basin of the <a href="Segura">Segura</a>.

The soils of Andalusia can be divided into three large areas: the <a href="Sierra%20Morena">Sierra Morena</a>, <a href="Cordillera%20Subb%C3%A9tica">Cordillera Subbética</a>, and the <a href="Baetic%20Depression">Baetic Depression</a> and the <a href="Surco%20Intrab%C3%A9tico">Surco Intrabético</a>.

The Sierra Morena, due to its morphology and the acidic content of its rocks, developed principally relatively poor, shallow soils, suitable only for forests. In the valleys and in some areas where <a href="limestone">limestone</a> is present, deeper soils allowed farming of cereals suitable for livestock. The more complicated morphology of the Baetic Cordillera makes it more heterogeneous, with the most heterogeneous soils in Andalusia. Very roughly, in contrast to the Sierra Morena, a predominance of <a href="base%20%28chemistry%29">basic</a> (alkaline) materials in the Cordillera Subbética, combined with a hilly landscape, generates deeper soils with greater agricultural capacity, suitable to the cultivation of olives.

Finally, the Baetic Depression and the Surco Intrabético have deep, rich soils, with great agricultural capacity. In particular, the <a href="alluvium">alluvial</a> soils of the <a href="Guadalquivir">Guadalquivir</a> valley and plain of <a href="Granada">Granada</a> have a <a href="loam">loam</a>y texture and are particularly suitable for intensive irrigated crops. In the hilly areas of the countryside, there is a double dynamic: the depressions have filled with older lime-rich material, developing the deep, rich, dark <a href="clay">clay</a> soils the Spanish call "<a href="bujeo">bujeo</a>", or "tierras negras andaluzas", excellent for dryland farming. In other zones, the whiter "albariza" provides an excellent soil for <a href="vineyard">vineyard</a>s.

Despite their marginal quality, the poorly consolidated soils of the sandy coastline of Huelva and Almería
have been successfully used in recent decades for hothouse cultivation under clear plastic of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and other fruits.

Biogeographically, Andalusia forms part of the Western Mediterranean subregion of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Basin">Mediterranean Basin</a>, which falls within the <a href="Boreal%20Kingdom">Boreal Kingdom</a>. Five <a href="Phytochorion">floristic provinces</a> lie, in whole or in part, within Andalusia: along much of the Atlantic coast, the Lusitanian-Andalusian littoral or Andalusian Atlantic littoral; in the north, the southern portion of the Luso-Extremaduran floristic province; covering roughly half of the region, the Baetic floristic province; and in the extreme east, the Almerian portion of the Almerian-Murcian floristic province and (coinciding roughly with the upper Segura basin) a small portion of the Castilian-Maestrazgan-Manchegan floristic province. These names derive primarily from past or present political geography: "Luso" and "Lusitanian" from <a href="Lusitania">Lusitania</a>, one of three <a href="Roman%20province">Roman province</a>s in Iberia, most of the others from present-day Spanish provinces, and <a href="Maestrazgo">Maestrazgo</a> being a historical region of northern <a href="Valencian%20Community">Valencia</a>.
In broad terms, the typical vegetation of Andalusia is <a href="Mediterranean%20forests%2C%20woodlands%2C%20and%20scrub">Mediterranean woodland</a>, characterized by <a href="leaf">leaf</a>y <a href="Xerophile">xerophilic</a> <a href="perennial%20plant">perennials</a>, adapted to the long, dry summers. The dominant species of the <a href="climax%20community">climax community</a> is the holly oak ("<a href="Quercus%20ilex">Quercus ilex</a>"). Also abundant are cork oak ("<a href="Quercus%20suber">Quercus suber</a>"), various <a href="pine">pine</a>s, and Spanish fir ("<a href="Abies%20pinsapo">Abies pinsapo</a>"). Due to cultivation, <a href="olive">olive</a> ("Olea europaea") and <a href="almond">almond</a> ("Prunus dulcis") trees also abound. The dominant <a href="understory">understory</a> is composed of thorny and aromatic woody species, such as <a href="rosemary">rosemary</a> ("Rosmarinus officinalis"), <a href="thyme">thyme</a> ("Thymus"), and "<a href="Cistus">Cistus</a>". In the wettest areas with <a href="Soil%20pH">acidic soils</a>, the most abundant species are the oak and cork oak, and the cultivated "<a href="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a>". In the woodlands, leafy <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a>s of genus "<a href="Populus">Populus</a>" (poplars, aspens, cottonwoods) and "<a href="Ulmus">Ulmus</a>" (elms) are also abundant; poplars are cultivated in the plains of Granada.

The Andalusian woodlands have been much altered by human settlement, the use of nearly all of the best land for farming, and frequent <a href="wildfire">wildfire</a>s. The degraded forests become shrubby and combustible <a href="garrigue">garrigue</a>. Extensive areas have been planted with non-<a href="Climax%20species">climax</a> trees such as pines. There is now a clear conservation policy for the remaining forests, which survive almost exclusively in the mountains.

The <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> of Andalusia extends to its fauna as well. More than 400 of the 630 vertebrate species extant in Spain can be found in Andalusia. Spanning the Mediterranean and Atlantic basins, and adjacent to the Strait of Gibraltar, Andalusia is on the migratory route of many of the numerous flocks of birds that travel annually from Europe to Africa and back.

The Andalusian wetlands host a rich variety of birds. Some are of African origin, such as the <a href="red-knobbed%20coot">red-knobbed coot</a> ("Fulica cristata"), the <a href="purple%20swamphen">purple swamphen</a> ("Porphyrio porphyrio"), and the <a href="greater%20flamingo">greater flamingo</a> ("Phoenicopterus roseus"). Others originate in Northern Europe, such as the <a href="greylag%20goose">greylag goose</a> ("Anser anser"). <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">Birds of prey</a> (raptors) include the <a href="Spanish%20imperial%20eagle">Spanish imperial eagle</a> ("Aquila adalberti"), the <a href="griffon%20vulture">griffon vulture</a> ("Gyps fulvus"), and both the <a href="Black%20kite">black</a> and <a href="red%20kite">red kite</a> ("Milvus migrans" and "Milvus milvus").
Among the <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>s, are several <a href="deer">deer</a> (Cervidae) species, notably the <a href="fallow%20deer">fallow deer</a> ("Dama dama") and <a href="roe%20deer">roe deer</a> ("Capreolus capreolus"); the <a href="European%20mouflon">European mouflon</a> ("Ovis orientalis musimon"), a type of sheep; and the <a href="Spanish%20ibex">Spanish ibex</a> ("Capra pyrenaica", which despite its scientific name is no longer found in the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>). The Spanish ibex has recently been losing ground to the <a href="Barbary%20sheep">Barbary sheep</a> ("Ammotragus lervia"), an <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a> from Africa, introduced for hunting in the 1970s. Among the small herbivores are rabbits—especially the <a href="European%20rabbit">European rabbit</a> ("Oryctolagus cuniculus")—which form the most important part of the diet of the carnivorous species of the Mediterranean woodlands.

The large <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a>s such as the <a href="Iberian%20wolf">Iberian wolf</a> ("Canis lupus signatus") and the <a href="Iberian%20lynx">Iberian lynx</a> ("Lynx pardinus") are quite threatened, and are limited to the Sierra de Andújar, inside of Sierra Morena, Doñana and Despeñaperros. Stocks of the <a href="wild%20boar">wild boar</a> ("Sus scrofa"), on the other hand, have been well preserved because they are popular with hunters. More abundant and in varied situations of conservation are such smaller carnivores as <a href="otter">otter</a>s, dogs, foxes, the <a href="European%20badger">European badger</a> ("Meles meles"), the <a href="European%20polecat">European polecat</a> ("Mustela putorius"), the <a href="least%20weasel">least weasel</a> ("Mustela nivalis"), the <a href="wildcat">wildcat</a> ("Felis silvestris"), the <a href="common%20genet">common genet</a> ("Genetta genetta"), and the <a href="Egyptian%20mongoose">Egyptian mongoose</a> ("Herpestes ichneumon)".

Other notable species are "<a href="Acherontia%20atropos">Acherontia atropos</a>" (a variety of <a href="death%27s-head%20hawkmoth">death's-head hawkmoth</a>), "<a href="Vipera%20latasti">Vipera latasti</a>" (a <a href="venomous%20snake">venomous snake</a>), and the endemic (and endangered) fish "<a href="Aphanius%20baeticus">Aphanius baeticus</a>".

Andalusia has many unique ecosystems. In order to preserve these areas in a manner compatible with both conservation and economic exploitation, many of the most representative ecosystems have been given protected status.

The various levels of protection are encompassed within the Network of Protected Natural Spaces of Andalusia (Red de Espacios Naturales Protegidos de Andalucía, RENPA) which integrates all protected natural spaces located in Andalusia, whether they are protected at the level of the local community, the autonomous community of Andalusia, the Spanish state, or by international conventions. RENPA consists of 150 protected spaces, consisting of two <a href="List%20of%20national%20parks%20of%20Spain">national parks</a>, 24 <a href="natural%20park%20%28Spain%29">natural parks</a>, 21 periurban parks (on the fringes of cities or towns), 32 natural sites, two protected countrysides, 37 natural monuments, 28 nature reserves, and four concerted nature reserves (in which a government agency coordinates with the owner of the property for its management), all part of the European Union's <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a> network. Under the international ambit are the nine <a href="Man%20and%20Biosphere%20Reserve%20Programme">Biosphere Reserves</a>, 20 <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar</a> wetland sites, four <a href="Specially%20Protected%20Areas%20of%20Mediterranean%20Importance">Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance</a> and two <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="Geopark">Geopark</a>s.

In total, nearly 20 percent of the territory of Andalusia lies in one of these protected areas, which constitute roughly 30 percent of the protected territory of Spain. Among these many spaces, some of the most notable are the <a href="Sierras%20de%20Cazorla%2C%20Segura%20y%20Las%20Villas%20Natural%20Park">Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas Natural Park</a>, Spain's largest natural park and the second largest in Europe, the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20National%20Park%20%28Spain%29">Sierra Nevada National Park</a>, <a href="Do%C3%B1ana%20National%20Park">Doñana National Park and Natural Park</a>, the <a href="Tabernas%20Desert">Tabernas Desert</a>, and the <a href="Cabo%20de%20Gata-N%C3%ADjar%20Natural%20Park">Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park</a>, the largest terrestrial-maritime reserve in the European Western Mediterranean Sea.

The geostrategic position of Andalusia in the extreme south of <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, providing (along with <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>) a gateway between Europe and Africa, added to its position between the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> and the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, as well as its rich deposits of minerals and its agricultural wealth, have made Andalusia a tempting prize for civilizations since prehistoric times. Add to this its area of (larger than many European countries), and it can be no surprise that Andalusia has figured prominently in the history of Europe and the Mediterranean.

Several theories postulate that the first <a href="hominid">hominid</a>s in Europe were in Andalusia, having passed across the Strait of <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>; the earliest known paintings of humanity have been found in the <a href="Caves%20of%20Nerja">Caves of Nerja</a>, <a href="Province%20of%20M%C3%A1laga">Málaga</a>. The first settlers, based on artifacts from the archaeological sites at <a href="Los%20Millares">Los Millares</a>, <a href="El%20Argar">El Argar</a>, and <a href="Tartessos">Tartessos</a>, were clearly influenced by cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean who arrived on the Andalusian coast. Andalusia then went through a period of <a href="protohistory">protohistory</a>, when the region did not have a written language of its own, but its existence was known to and documented by literate cultures, principally the <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>ns (Gadir, Malaka) and <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greeks</a>. During the second millennium BCE, the kingdom of <a href="Tartessos">Tartessos</a> developed in Andalusia.

With the fall of the <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>n cities, <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a> became the dominant sea power of the western Mediterranean and the most important trading partner for the Phoenician towns along the Andalusian coast. Between the <a href="First%20Punic%20War">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second Punic War</a>s, Carthage extended its control beyond Andalucia to include all of Iberia except the Basque Country. Andalusia was the major staging ground for the war with Rome led by the Carthaginian general <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a> Barca. The Romans defeated the Carthaginians and conquered Andalusia, the region being renamed <a href="Baetica">Baetica</a>. It was fully incorporated into the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, and from this region came many Roman magistrates and senators, as well as the emperors <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a> and (most likely) <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>.

The Vandals moved briefly through the region during the 5th century AD before settling in North Africa, after which the region fell into the hands of the <a href="Visigothic%20Kingdom">Visigothic Kingdom</a>. The <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> in this region were practically independent of the <a href="Visigothic%20Kingdom%23Catholic%20Kingdom%20of%20Toledo">Visigothic Catholic Kingdom of Toledo</a>. This is the era of Saints <a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore of Seville</a> and <a href="Hermenegild">Hermenegild</a>. During this period, around 555 AD, the <a href="Eastern%20Roman%20Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a> conquered Andalusia under <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a>, the <a href="Eastern%20Roman%20Emperor">Eastern Roman Emperor</a>. They established <a href="Spania">Spania</a>, a province of the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> from 552 until 624. Though their holdings were quickly reduced, they continued to have interests in the region until it was lost altogether in 624.

The Visigothic era came to an abrupt end in 711 with the <a href="Umayyad%20conquest%20of%20Hispania">Umayyad conquest of Hispania</a> by the <a href="Umayyad">Umayyad</a> general <a href="Tariq%20ibn%20Ziyad">Tariq ibn Ziyad</a>, an <a href="Islamic">Islamic</a> <a href="Berber%20people">Berber</a>. Tariq is known in Spanish history and legend as a formidable conqueror who dared and bore the nerve to burn his fleet of ships, when he landed with his troops on the coast of Gibraltar - an acronym of "Jabel alTariq" meaning "the mountain of Tariq". The —by the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyad Caliphate</a>—of the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a> in 711–718 marked the collapse of Visigothic rule. When the Muslim invaders seized control and consolidated their domain of the region, they remained tolerant of the Christian religion, but they also needed a place of cult for their own faith. In the 750s, they forcibly rented half of Cordoba's Christian Cathedral of <a href="Saint%20Vincent%20the%20Deacon">San Vicente</a> (<a href="Visigoth">Visigoth</a>ic) to use as a mosque. 

In this period, the name "<a href="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a>" was applied to a much larger area than the present Andalusia, and in some periods it referred to nearly the entire Iberian peninsula. Islamic rulers of Hispania were economic invaders and interested in collecting taxes, they were not social invaders. Changes were mainly confined to geographical, political and legal conveniences. <a href="Al-Andalus">Al-Andalus</a> remained quite connected to its sister Christian states under Islamic rule, As such trade routes between it and <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> and <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> remained fluent. Roman/Byzantine ideas and customs flowed on between post Byzantine regions. This Bizantine/Roman architecture is such an example.

Nevertheless, the <a href="Guadalquivir">Guadalquivir</a> River valley in present-day Andalusia became the hub of Muslim power in the peninsula, with the <a href="Caliphate%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Caliphate of Córdoba</a> making <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Andalusia">Córdoba</a> its capital. The Umayyad Caliphate produced such leaders as Caliph <a href="Abd-ar-Rahman%20III">Abd-ar-Rahman III</a> (ruled 912–961) and his son, Caliph <a href="Al-Hakam%20II">Al-Hakam II</a> (ruled 961–976); and built the magnificent <a href="Great%20Mosque%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Great Mosque of Córdoba</a>. Under these rulers, <a href="Moors">Moorish</a> Islam in Spain reached its zenith, and Córdoba was a center of global economic and cultural significance.

By the 10th century, the Christians of northern Spain had begun what would eventually become the <a href="Reconquista">Reconquista</a>: the reconquest of Spain for Christendom. Caliph Abd-ar-Rahman suffered some minor military defeats, but often managed to manipulate the Christian kingdoms to act against each other's interests. Al-Hakam achieved military successes, but at the expense of uniting the Christian kings of the north against him.
After the conquest of Toledo in 1086 by <a href="Alfonso%20VI%20of%20Castile">Alfonso VI</a>, Christian rule dominated the peninsula. The main "<a href="Taifa">Taifa</a>s" therefore had to resort to assistance from various Muslim powers across the Mediterranean. A number of different Muslim dynasties of North African origin—notably <a href="Almoravid%20dynasty">Almoravid dynasty</a> and <a href="Almohad%20dynasty">Almohad dynasty</a>—dominated a slowly diminishing Al-Andalus over the next several centuries.

After the Muslim victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sagrajas">Battle of Sagrajas</a> (1086) put a temporary stop to Christian expansion, the <a href="Almoravid%20dynasty">Almoravid dynasty</a> constructed a unified Al-Andalus with its capital in Granada, ruling until the mid-12th century. The various "Taifa" kingdoms were assimilated. the <a href="Almohad%20dynasty">Almohad dynasty</a> expansion in North Africa weakened Al-Andalus, and in 1170 the Almohads transferred their capital from <a href="Marrakesh">Marrakesh</a> to <a href="Seville">Seville</a>. The Christian victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Las%20Navas%20de%20Tolosa">Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa</a> (1212) marked the beginning of the end of the Almohad dynasty.

The weakness caused by the collapse of Almohad power and the subsequent creation of new "Taifas", each with its own ruler, led to the rapid Christian reconquest of the valley of the Guadalquivir. Córdoba was regained in 1236 and Seville in 1248. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Granada">fall of Granada</a> in 1492 put an end to Muslim rule in the Iberian peninsula.
On 3 August 1492 <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> left the town of <a href="Palos%20de%20la%20Frontera">Palos de la Frontera</a>, with the first expedition that resulted in the <a href="discovery%20of%20America">Europeans learning of the existence of America</a>. Many Andalusians participated in the expedition that would end the Middle Ages and signal the beginning of modernity. Contacts between Spain and the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>, including royal administration and the shipping trade of <a href="Spanish%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">Spanish colonies</a> for over three hundred years, came almost exclusively through Andalusia. As a result, it became the wealthiest, most influential region in Spain and amongst the most influential in Europe. However, <a href="Habsburg%20dynasty">Habsburg</a> ambitions elsewhere in Europe diverted much of the colonial wealth to war. Discontent with this situation culminated in 1641, when the Andalusian nobility staged an unsuccessful <a href="Andalusian%20independentist%20conspiracy%20%281641%29">conspiracy to gain independence</a> in 1641 from the provincial government of the <a href="Gaspar%20de%20Guzm%C3%A1n%2C%20Count-Duke%20of%20Olivares">Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares</a>.

In the first half of the 16th century <a href="Black%20Death">plague</a> was still prevalent in Spain. According to George C. Kohn, "One of the worst epidemics of the century, whose miseries were accompanied by severe drought and food shortage, started in 1505; by 1507, about 100,000 people had died in Andalusia alone... Andalusia was struck once again in 1646. For three years, <a href="Great%20Plague%20of%20Seville">plague</a> haunted the entire region, causing perhaps as many as 200,000 deaths, especially in Málaga and Seville."

Following the <a href="Morisco%20Revolt">Second Rebellion of the Alpujarras</a> in 1568-1571, the Moorish population—that is, unconverted <a href="Morisco">Morisco</a>s—were expelled from <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Castile">Kingdom of Castile</a> (and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Aragon">Aragon</a>). However, by order of the <a href="Spanish%20crown">Spanish crown</a>, two Moorish families were required to remain in each village in order to demonstrate to the new inhabitants, introduced from northern Spain, the workings of the <a href="terrace%20%28agriculture%29">terracing</a> and irrigation systems on which the district's agriculture depends.

In 1810-12 the people strongly resisted the French occupation during the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a> (part of the Napoleonic Wars).

Andalusia profited from the Spanish overseas empire, although much trade and finance eventually came to be controlled by other parts of Europe to where it was ultimately destined. In the 18th century, commerce from other parts of Spain began to displace Andalusian commerce when the Spanish government ended Andalusia's trading monopoly with the American colonies. The loss of the empire in the 1820s hurt the economy of the region, particularly the cities that had benefited from the trade and ship building. The construction of railways in the latter part of the 19th century enabled Andalusia to better develop its agricultural potential and it became an exporter of food. While industrialisation was taking off in the northern Spanish regions of Catalonia and the Basque country, Andalusia remained traditional and displayed a deep social division between a small class of wealthy landowners and a population made up largely of poor agricultural labourers and tradesmen.

Andalusia is one of the 17 <a href="autonomous%20communities%20of%20Spain">autonomous communities of Spain</a>. The <a href="Regional%20Government%20of%20Andalusia">Regional Government of Andalusia</a> (Spanish: "Junta de Andalucía") includes the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Andalusia">Parliament of Andalusia</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20Parliament%20of%20Andalusia">its chosen president</a>, a Consultative Council, and other bodies.

The Autonomous Community of Andalusia was formed in accord with a referendum of 28 February 1980 and became an autonomous community under the 1981 Statute of Autonomy known as the "Estatuto de Carmona". The process followed the <a href="Spanish%20Constitution%20of%201978">Spanish Constitution of 1978</a>, still current as of 2009, which recognizes and guarantees the right of autonomy for the various regions and nationalities of Spain. The process to establish Andalusia as an autonomous region followed Article 151 of the Constitution, making Andalusia the only autonomous community to take that particular course. That article was set out for regions like Andalusia that had been prevented by the outbreak of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a> from adopting a statute of autonomy during the period of the <a href="Second%20Spanish%20Republic">Second Spanish Republic</a>.

Article 1 of the 1981 Statute of Autonomy justifies autonomy based on the region's "historical identity, on the self-government that the Constitution permits every nationality, on outright equality to the rest of the nationalities and regions that compose Spain, and with a power that emanates from the Andalusian Constitution and people, reflected in its Statute of Autonomy".

In October 2006 the constitutional commission of the <a href="Cortes%20Generales">Cortes Generales</a> (the national legislature of Spain), with favorable votes from the left-of-center <a href="Spanish%20Socialist%20Workers%27%20Party">Spanish Socialist Workers' Party</a> (PSOE), the leftist <a href="United%20Left%20%28Spain%29">United Left</a> (IU) and the right-of-center <a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28Spain%29">People`s Party</a> (PP), approved a new Statute of Autonomy for Andalusia, whose preamble refers to the community as a "<a href="Nationalities%20and%20regions%20of%20Spain">national reality</a>" ("realidad nacional"):

On 2 November 2006 the Spanish Chamber Deputies ratified the text of the Constitutional Commission with 306 votes in favor, none opposed, and 2 abstentions. This was the first time a Spanish <a href="Organic%20Law%20%28Spain%29">Organic Law</a> adopting a Statute of Autonomy was approved with no opposing votes. The Senate, in a plenary session of 20 December 2006, ratified the referendum to be voted upon by the Andalusian public 18 February 2007.

The Statute of Autonomy spells out Andalusia's distinct institutions of government and administration. Chief among these is the <a href="Andalusian%20Autonomous%20Government">Andalusian Autonomous Government</a> ("Junta de Andalucía"). Other institutions specified in the Statute are the Defensor del Pueblo Andaluz (literally "Defender of the Andalusian People", basically an <a href="ombudsperson">ombudsperson</a>), the Consultative Council, the Chamber of Accounts, the Audiovisual Council of Andalusia, and the Economic and Social Council.

The Andalusian Statute of Autonomy recognizes Seville as the region's capital. The Andalusian Autonomous Government is located there. However, the region's highest court, the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Andalusia">High Court of Andalusia</a> ("<a href="Tribunal%20Superior%20de%20Justicia%20de%20Andaluc%C3%ADa">Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Andalucía</a>") is not part of the Autonomous Government, and has its seat in <a href="Granada">Granada</a>.

The Andalusian Autonomous Government ("Junta de Andalucía") is the institution of self-government of the Autonomous Community of Andalusia. Within the government, the <a href="President%20of%20Andalusia">President of the Regional Government of Andalusia</a> is the supreme representative of the autonomous community, and the ordinary representative of the Spanish state in the autonomous community. The president is formally named to the position by the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Spain">Monarch of Spain</a> and then confirmed by a majority vote of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Andalusia">Parliament of Andalusia</a>. In practice, the monarch always names a person acceptable to the ruling party or coalition of parties in the autonomous region. In theory, were the candidate to fail to gain the needed majority, the monarch could propose a succession of candidates. After two months, if no proposed candidate could gain the parliament's approval, the parliament would automatically be dissolved and the acting president would call new elections. On September 5, 2013 <a href="Susana%20D%C3%ADaz">Susana Díaz</a> was elected president.

The Council of Government, the highest political and administrative organ of the Community, exercises <a href="rulemaking">regulatory</a> and <a href="executive%20power">executive power</a>. The President presides over the council, which also includes the heads of various departments ("Consejerías"). In the current legislature (2008–2012), there are 15 of these departments. In order of precedence, they are Presidency, Governance, Economy and Treasury, Education, Justice and Public Administration, Innovation, Science and Business, Public Works and Transportation, Employment, Health, Agriculture and Fishing, Housing and Territorial Planning, Tourism, Commerce and Sports, Equality and Social Welfare, Culture, and Environment.

The Parliament of Andalusia, its Autonomic Legislative Assembly, develops and approves laws and elects and removes the President. Elections to the Andalusian Parliament follow a democratic formula through which the citizens elect 109 representatives. After the approval of the Statute of Autonomy through Organic Law 6/1981 on 20 December 1981, the first elections to the autonomic parliament took place 23 May 1982. Further elections have occurred in 1986, 1990, 1994, 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008.

The current (2008–2012) legislature includes representatives of the PSOE-A (Andalusian branch of the left-of-center PSOE), PP-A (Andalusian branch of the right-of-center PP) and IULV-CA (Andalusian branch of the leftist IU).

The <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Andalusia">High Court of Andalusia</a> ("<a href="Tribunal%20Superior%20de%20Justicia%20de%20Andaluc%C3%ADa">Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Andalucía</a>") in Granada is subject only to the higher jurisdiction of <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Spain">Supreme Court of Spain</a>. The High Court is not an organ of the Autonomous Community, but rather of the <a href="Judiciary%20of%20Spain">Judiciary of Spain</a>, which is unitary throughout the kingdom and whose powers are not transferred to the autonomous communities. The Andalusian territory is divided into 88 <a href="legal%20district">legal/judicial districts</a> ("partidos judiciales").

Andalusia consists of eight <a href="Provinces%20of%20Spain">provinces</a>. The latter were established by <a href="Javier%20de%20Burgos">Javier de Burgos</a> in the <a href="1833%20territorial%20division%20of%20Spain">1833 territorial division of Spain</a>. Each of the Andalusian provinces bears the same name as its capital:

Andalusia is traditionally divided into two historical subregions: Upper Andalusia" or "Eastern Andalusia ("Andalucía Oriental"), consisting of the provinces of Almería, Granada, Jaén, and Málaga, and Lower Andalusia" or "Western Andalusia ("Andalucía Occidental"), consisting of the provinces of Cádiz, Córdoba, Huelva and Seville.

Beyond the level of provinces, Andalusia is further divided into 774 <a href="List%20of%20municipalities%20of%20Spain">municipalities</a> ("municipios"). The municipalities of Andalusia are regulated by Title III of the Statute of Autonomy, Articles 91–95, which establishes the municipality as the basic territorial entity of Andalusia, each of which has legal personhood and autonomy in many aspects of its internal affairs. At the municipal level, representation, government and administration is performed by the "ayuntamiento" (municipal government), which has competency for <a href="urban%20planning">urban planning</a>, community social services, supply and treatment of water, collection and treatment of waste, and promotion of tourism, culture, and sports, among other matters established by law.

Among the more important Andalusian cities besides the provincial capitals are:

In conformity with the intent to devolve control as locally as possible, in many cases, separate nuclei of population within municipal borders each administer their own interests. These are variously known as "pedanías" ("hamlets"), "villas" ("villages"), "aldeas" (also usually rendered as "villages"), or other similar names.

Within the various autonomous communities of Spain, "<a href="comarcas">comarcas</a>" are comparable to <a href="shire">shire</a>s (or, in some countries, <a href="county">counties</a>) in the English-speaking world. Unlike in some of Spain's other autonomous communities, under the original 1981 Statute of Autonomy, the <a href="comarcas%20of%20Andalusia">"comarcas" of Andalusia</a> had no formal recognition, but, in practice, they still had informal recognition as geographic, cultural, historical, or in some cases administrative entities. The 2007 Statute of Autonomy echoes this practice, and mentions "comarcas" in Article 97 of Title III, which defines the significance of "comarcas" and establishes a basis for formal recognition in future legislation.

The current statutory entity that most closely resembles a "comarca" is the "<a href="mancomunidad">mancomunidad</a>", a freely chosen, bottom-up association of municipalities intended as an instrument of socioeconomic development and coordination between municipal governments in specific areas.

Andalusia ranks first by population among the 17 autonomous communities of Spain. The estimated population at the beginning of 2009 was 8,285,692. The population is concentrated, above all, in the provincial capitals and along the coasts, so that the level of urbanization is quite high; half the population is concentrated in the 28 cities of more than 50,000 inhabitants. The population is aging, although the process of immigration is countering the inversion of the <a href="population%20pyramid">population pyramid</a>.

At the end of the 20th century, Andalusia was in the last phase of <a href="demographic%20transition">demographic transition</a>. The <a href="death%20rate">death rate</a> stagnated at around 8–9 per thousand, and the population came to be influenced mainly by birth and migration.
In 1950, Andalusia had 20.04 percent of the national population of Spain. By 1981, this had declined to 17.09 percent. Although the Andalusian population was not declining in absolute terms, these relative losses were due to emigration great enough to nearly counterbalance having the highest <a href="birth%20rate">birth rate</a> in Spain. Since the 1980s, this process has reversed on all counts, and as of 2009, Andalusia has 17.82 percent of the Spanish population.
The birth rate is sharply down, as is typical in developed economies, although it has lagged behind much of the rest of the world in this respect. Furthermore, prior emigrants have been returning to Andalusia. Beginning in the 1990s, others have been immigrating in large numbers as well, as Spain has become a country of net immigration.

At the beginning of the 21st century, statistics show a slight increase in the birth rate, due in large part to the higher birth rate among immigrants. The result is that as of 2009, the trend toward rejuvenation of the population is among the strongest of any autonomous community of Spain, or of any comparable region in Europe.

At the beginning of the 21st century, the population structure of Andalusia shows a clear inversion of the population pyramid, with the largest cohorts falling between ages 25 and 50. Comparison of the population pyramid in 2008 to that in 1986 shows:

As far as composition by sex, two aspects stand out: the higher percentage of women in the elderly population, owing to women's longer life expectancy, and, on the other hand, the higher percentage of men of working age, due in large part to a predominantly male immigrant population.

In 2005, 5.35 percent of the population of Andalusia were born outside of Spain. This is a relatively low number for a Spanish region, the national average being three percentage points higher. The immigrants are not evenly distributed among the Andalusian provinces: Almería, with a 15.20 percent immigrant population, is third among all provinces in Spain, while at the other extreme Jaén is only 2.07 percent immigrants and Córdoba 1.77 percent. The predominant nationalities among the immigrant populations are <a href="Morocco">Moroccan</a> (92,500, constituting 17.79 percent of the foreigners living in Andalusia) and <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> (15.25 percent across the region). When comparing regions rather than individual countries, the single largest immigrant block is from <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>, outnumbering either North Africans or non-Spanish Western Europeans. Demographically, this group has provided an important addition to the Andalusian labor force.

Andalusia is traditionally an agricultural area, but the <a href="service%20sector">service sector</a> (particularly tourism, retail sales, and transportation) now predominates. The once booming construction sector, hit hard by the <a href="Great%20Recession">2009 recession</a>, was also important to the region's economy. The industrial sector is less developed than most other regions in Spain.

Between 2000–2006 economic growth per annum was 3.72%, one of the highest in the country. Still, according to the Spanish <a href="Instituto%20Nacional%20de%20Estad%C3%ADstica%20%28Spain%29">Instituto Nacional de Estadística</a> (INE), the GDP per capita of Andalusia (€17,401; 2006) remains the second lowest in Spain, with only <a href="Extremadura">Extremadura</a> lagging behind.

The <a href="primary%20sector">primary sector</a>, despite adding the least of the three sectors to the regional <a href="GDP">GDP</a> remains important, especially when compared to typical developed economies. The primary sector produces 8.26 percent of regional GDP and employs 8.19 percent of the workforce. In monetary terms it could be considered a rather uncompetitive sector, given its level of productivity compared to other Spanish regions. In addition to its numeric importance relative to other regions, agriculture and other primary sector activities have strong roots in local culture and identity.

The primary sector is divided into a number of subsectors: <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>, <a href="commercial%20fishing">commercial fishing</a>, <a href="animal%20husbandry">animal husbandry</a>, <a href="hunting">hunting</a>, <a href="forestry">forestry</a>, <a href="mining">mining</a>, and <a href="energy">energy</a>.

For many centuries, Andalusian society was mainly agricultural. Even today, 45.74 percent of the Andalusian territory is cultivated. The primary cultivation is dryland farming of <a href="cereal">cereal</a>s and <a href="sunflower">sunflower</a>s without artificial <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a>, especially in the vast countryside of the Guadalquivir valley and the high plains of Granada and Almería-with a considerably lesser and more geographically focused cultivation of <a href="barley">barley</a> and <a href="avena">oats</a>. Using irrigation, <a href="maize">maize</a>, <a href="cotton">cotton</a> and <a href="rice">rice</a> are also grown on the banks of the Guadalquivir and <a href="Genil">Genil</a>.

The most important tree crops are <a href="Olea%20europaea">olives</a>, especially in the Subbetic regions of the provinces of Córdoba and Jáen, where irrigated olive orchards constitute a large component of agricultural output. There are extensive <a href="vineyard">vineyard</a>s in various zones such as <a href="Jerez%20de%20la%20Frontera">Jerez de la Frontera</a> (<a href="sherry">sherry</a>), <a href="Condado%20de%20Huelva">Condado de Huelva</a>, <a href="Montilla-Moriles">Montilla-Moriles</a> and <a href="Malaga%20%28wine%29">Málaga</a>. Fruits—mainly <a href="citrus">citrus</a> fruits—are grown near the banks of the Guadalquivir; <a href="almond">almond</a>s, which require far less water, are grown on the high plains of Granada and Almería.

In monetary terms, by far the most productive and competitive agriculture in Andalusia is the intensive forced cultivation of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and other fruits grown under hothouse conditions under clear plastic, often in sandy zones, on the coasts, in Almería and Huelva.

<a href="Organic%20farming">Organic farming</a> has recently undergone rapid expansion in Andalusia, mainly for export to European markets but with increasing demand developing in Spain.

Andalusia has a long tradition of <a href="animal%20husbandry">animal husbandry</a> and <a href="livestock">livestock</a> farming, but it is now restricted mainly to mountain meadows, where there is less pressure from other potential uses. Andalusians have a long and colourful history of <a href="dog%20breeding">dog breeding</a> that can be observed throughout the region today. The raising of livestock now plays a semi-marginal role in the Andalusian economy, constituting only 15 percent of the primary sector, half the number for Spain taken as a whole.

"Extensive" raising of livestock grazes the animals on natural or cultivated <a href="pasture">pasture</a>s, whereas "intensive" raising of livestock is based in <a href="fodder">fodder</a> rather than pasture. Although the productivity is higher than with extensive techniques, the economics are quite different. While intensive techniques now dominate in Europe and even in other regions of Spain, most of Andalusia's <a href="cattle">cattle</a>, virtually all of its <a href="sheep">sheep</a> and <a href="goat">goat</a>s, and a good portion of its <a href="pig">pig</a>s are raised by extensive farming in mountain pastures. This includes the <a href="Black%20Iberian%20pig">Black Iberian pig</a>s that are the source of "<a href="Jam%C3%B3n%20ib%C3%A9rico">Jamón ibérico</a>". Andalusia's native sheep and goats present a great economic opportunity in a Europe where animal products are generally in strong supply, but the sheep and goat meat, milk, and leather (and the products derived from these) are relatively scarce. <a href="Dog">Dog</a>s are bred not just as companion animals, but also as herding animals used by goat and sheep herders.

Hunting remains relatively important in Andalusia, but has largely lost its character as a means of obtaining food.
It is now more of a leisure activity linked to the mountain areas and complementary to forestry and the raising of livestock. Dogs are frequently used as hunting companions to retrieve killed game.

The Andalusian <a href="forest">forest</a>s are important for their extent—50 percent of the territory of Andalusia—and for other less quantifiable environmental reasons, such as their value in preventing erosion, regulating the flow of water necessary for other flora and fauna. For these reasons, there is legislation in place to protect the Andalusian forests. The value of forest products as such constitutes only 2 percent of agricultural production. This comes mostly from cultivated species—<a href="eucalyptus">eucalyptus</a> in Huelva and <a href="Populus">poplar</a> in Granada—as well as naturally occurring <a href="cork%20oak">cork oak</a> in the Sierra Morena.

<a href="Commercial%20fishing">Fishing</a> is a longstanding tradition on the Andalusian coasts. Fish and other seafood have long figured prominently in the local diet and in the local <a href="gastronomy">gastronomic</a> culture: <a href="fried%20fish">fried fish</a> ("pescaito frito" in local dialect), white <a href="prawn">prawn</a>s, "<a href="almadraba">almadraba</a>" tuna, among others. The Andalusian fishing fleet is Spain's second largest, after <a href="Galicia%20%28Spain%29">Galicia</a>, and Andalusia's 38 fishing ports are the most of any Spanish autonomous community. Commercial fishing produces only 0.5 percent of the product of the regional primary sector by value, but there are areas where it has far greater importance. In the province of Huelva it constitutes 20 percent of the primary sector, and locally in <a href="Punta%20Umbr%C3%ADa">Punta Umbría</a> 70 percent of the work force is involved in commercial fishing.

Failure to comply with fisheries laws regarding the use of trawling, urban <a href="pollution">pollution</a> of the seacoast, destruction of habitats by coastal construction (for example, alteration of the mouths of rivers, construction of ports), and diminution of fisheries by <a href="overexploitation">overexploitation</a>
have created a permanent crisis in the Andalusian fisheries, justifying attempts to convert the fishing fleet. The decrease in fish stocks has led to the rise of <a href="aquaculture">aquaculture</a>, including <a href="fish%20farming">fish farming</a> both on the coasts and in the interior.

Despite the general poor returns in recent years, <a href="mining">mining</a> retains a certain importance in Andalusia. Andalusia produces half of Spain's mining product by value. Of Andalusia's production, roughly half comes from the province of Huelva. Mining for precious metals at <a href="Minas%20de%20Riotinto">Minas de Riotinto</a> in Huelva ("see <a href="Rio%20Tinto%20Group">Rio Tinto Group</a>") dates back to pre-Roman times; the mines were abandoned in the Middle Ages and rediscovered in 1556. Other mining activity is <a href="coal">coal</a> mining in the Guadiato valley in the province of Córdoba; various metals at <a href="Aznalc%C3%B3llar">Aznalcóllar</a> in the province of Seville, and iron at <a href="Alquife">Alquife</a> in the province of Granada. In addition, limestone, clay, and other materials used in construction are well distributed throughout Andalusia.

The Andalusian industrial sector has always been relatively small. Nevertheless, in 2007, Andalusian industry earned 11.979 million euros and employed more than 290,000 workers. This represented 9.15 percent of regional GDP, far below the 15.08 the secondary sector represents in the economy of Spain as a whole. By analyzing the different subsectors of the food industry Andalusian industry accounts for more than 16% of total production. In a comparison with the Spanish economy, this subsector is virtually the only food that has some weight in the national economy with 16.16%. Lies far behind the manufacturing sector of shipping materials just over 10% of the Spanish economy. Companies like Cruzcampo (Heineken Group), Puleva, Domecq, Santana Motors or Renault-Andalusia, are exponents of these two subsectors. Of note is the Andalusian aeronautical sector, which is second nationally only behind Madrid and represents approximately 21% of total turnover in terms of employment, highlighting companies like Airbus, Airbus Military, or the newly formed Aerospace Alestis. On the contrary it is symptomatic of how little weight the regional economy in such important sectors such as textiles or electronics at the national level.

Andalusian industry is also characterized by a specialization in industrial activities of transforming raw agricultural and mineral materials. This is largely done by small enterprises without the public or foreign investment more typical of a high level of industrialization.

In recent decades the Andalusian tertiary (service) sector has grown greatly, and has come to constitute the majority of the regional economy, as is typical of contemporary economies in developed nations. In 1975 the service sector produced 51.1 percent of local GDP and employed 40.8 percent of the work force. In 2007, this had risen to 67.9 percent of GDP and 66.42 percent of jobs. This process of "tertiarization" of the economy has followed a somewhat unusual course in Andalusia. This growth occurred somewhat earlier than in most developed economies and occurred independently of the local industrial sector. There were two principal reasons that "tertiarization" followed a different course in Andalusia than elsewhere:

1. Andalusian capital found it impossible to compete in the industrial sector against more developed regions, and was obligated to invest in sectors that were easier to enter.

2. The absence of an industrial sector that could absorb displaced agricultural workers and artisans led to the proliferation of services with rather low productivity. This unequal development compared to other regions led to a hypertrophied and unproductive service sector, which has tended to reinforce underdevelopment, because it has not led to large accumulations of capital.

Due in part to the relatively mild winter and spring climate, the south of Spain is attractive to overseas visitors–especially tourists from Northern Europe. While inland areas such as <a href="Province%20of%20Ja%C3%A9n%20%28Spain%29">Jaén</a>, <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%20%28Spanish%20province%29">Córdoba</a> and the hill villages and towns remain relatively untouched by tourism, the coastal areas of Andalusia have heavy visitor traffic for much of the year.

Among the autonomous communities, Andalusia is second only to <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> in tourism, with nearly 30 million visitors every year. The principal tourist destinations in Andalusia are the <a href="Costa%20del%20Sol">Costa del Sol</a> and (secondarily) the <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28Spain%29">Sierra Nevada</a>. As discussed <a href="%23Climate">above</a>, Andalusia is one of the sunniest and warmest places in Europe, making it a center of "sun and sand" tourism. 70 percent of the lodging capacity and 75 percent of the nights booked in Andalusian hotels are in coastal municipalities. The largest number of tourists come in August—13.26 percent of the nights booked throughout the year—and the smallest number in December—5.36 percent.

On the west (Atlantic) coast are the <a href="Costa%20de%20la%20Luz">Costa de la Luz</a> (provinces of Huelva and Cádiz), and on the east (Mediterranean) coast, the <a href="Costa%20del%20Sol">Costa del Sol</a> (provinces of Cádiz y Málaga), <a href="Costa%20Tropical">Costa Tropical</a> (Granada and part of Almería) and the <a href="Costa%20de%20Almer%C3%ADa">Costa de Almería</a>. In 2004, the <a href="Blue%20Flag%20beach">Blue Flag beach</a> program of the non-profit <a href="Foundation%20for%20Environmental%20Education">Foundation for Environmental Education</a> recognized 66 Andalusian beaches and 18 pleasure craft ports as being in a good state of conservation in terms of sustainability, accessibility, and quality. Nonetheless, the level of tourism on the Andalusian coasts has been high enough to have a significant environmental impact, and other organizations—such as the Spanish <a href="Ecologists%20in%20Action">Ecologists in Action</a> ("Ecologistas en Acción") with their description of "Black Flag beaches" or <a href="Greenpeace">Greenpeace</a>—have expressed the opposite sentiment. However, <a href="Hotel%20chains">Hotel chains</a> such as <a href="Fuerte%20Hotels%23Responsible%20Tourism">Fuerte Hotels</a> have ensured that sustainability within the tourism industry is one of their highest priorities.

Together with "sand and sun" tourism, there has also been a strong increase in nature tourism in the interior, as well as <a href="cultural%20tourism">cultural tourism</a>, sport tourism, and conventions. One example of sport and nature tourism is the ski resort at <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20National%20Park%20%28Spain%29">Sierra Nevada National Park</a>.

As for cultural tourism, Andalusia has some notable monuments dating back to the Muslim era: the <a href="Great%20Mosque%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Great Mosque of Córdoba</a>, the <a href="Alhambra">Alhambra</a> in Granada, the <a href="Giralda">Giralda</a> and <a href="Alc%C3%A1zar%20of%20Seville">Alcazar</a> in Seville, and the <a href="Alcazaba%20of%20M%C3%A1laga">Alcazaba</a> in Málaga. There are hundreds of cultural tourist destinations: cathedrals, castles, forts, monasteries, and historic city centers; the city centers of <a href="%C3%9Abeda">Úbeda</a> and <a href="Baeza">Baeza</a> in the province of Jaén are UNESCO <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>s.

Each of the provinces shows a great variety of architectural styles: <a href="Islamic%20architecture">Islamic architecture</a>, <a href="Renaissance%20architecture">Renaissance architecture</a>, <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque architecture</a> and more modern styles. Further, there are the "<a href="Lugares%20colombinos">Lugares colombinos</a>", significant places in the life of <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>: <a href="Palos%20de%20la%20Frontera">Palos de la Frontera</a>, <a href="La%20R%C3%A1bida%20Monastery">La Rábida Monastery</a>, and <a href="Moguer">Moguer</a>) in the province of Huelva. There are also archeological sites of great interest: the Roman city of <a href="Italica">Italica</a>, birthplace of <a href="Roman%20Emperor">Emperor</a> <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a> and (most likely) <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>; <a href="Baelo%20Claudia">Baelo Claudia</a> near the Straits of Gibraltar; <a href="Medina%20Azahara">Medina Azahara</a>, the city-palace of the Cordoban <a href="caliph">caliph</a> <a href="Abd-ar-Rahman%20III">Abd-ar-Rahman III</a>, where major excavations still continue.

Andalusia was the birthplace of such great painters as <a href="Diego%20Vel%C3%A1zquez">Velázquez</a> and <a href="Bartolom%C3%A9%20Esteban%20Murillo">Murillo</a> (Seville) and, more recently, <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Picasso</a> (Málaga); Picasso is memorialized by his native city at the <a href="Museo%20Picasso%20M%C3%A1laga">Museo Picasso Málaga</a> and <a href="Fundaci%C3%B3n%20Picasso">Natal House Foundation</a>; the <a href="Casa%20de%20Murillo">Casa de Murillo</a> was a <a href="house%20museum">house museum</a> 1982–1998, but is now mostly offices for the Andalusian Council of Culture. The <a href="http%3A//www.cacmalaga.org/">CAC Málaga (Museum of Modern Art)</a> is the most visited museum of Andalusia and has offered exhibitions of artists such as <a href="Louise%20Bourgeois">Louise Bourgeois</a>, <a href="Jake%20and%20Dinos%20Chapman">Jake and Dinos Chapman</a>, <a href="Gerhard%20Richter">Gerhard Richter</a>, <a href="Anish%20Kapoor">Anish Kapoor</a>, <a href="Ron%20Mueck">Ron Mueck</a> or <a href="Rodney%20Graham">Rodney Graham</a>. Malaga is also located part of the private <a href="Carmen%20Cervera">Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection</a> at <a href="Carmen%20Thyssen%20Museum">Carmen Thyssen Museum</a>.

There are numerous other significant museums around the region, both of paintings and of archeological artifacts such as gold jewelry, pottery and other ceramics, and other works that demonstrate the region's artisanal traditions.

The Council of Government has designated the following "Municipios Turísticos": in Almería, <a href="Roquetas%20de%20Mar">Roquetas de Mar</a>; in Cádiz, <a href="Chiclana%20de%20la%20Frontera">Chiclana de la Frontera</a>, <a href="Chipiona">Chipiona</a>, <a href="Conil%20de%20la%20Frontera">Conil de la Frontera</a>, <a href="Grazalema">Grazalema</a>, <a href="Rota%2C%20Andalusia">Rota</a>, and <a href="Tarifa">Tarifa</a>; in Granada, <a href="Almu%C3%B1%C3%A9car">Almuñécar</a>; in Huelva, <a href="Aracena">Aracena</a>; in Jaén, <a href="Cazorla">Cazorla</a>; in Málaga, <a href="Benalm%C3%A1dena">Benalmádena</a>, <a href="Fuengirola">Fuengirola</a>, <a href="Nerja">Nerja</a>, <a href="Rinc%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20Victoria">Rincón de la Victoria</a>, <a href="Ronda">Ronda</a>, and <a href="Torremolinos">Torremolinos</a>; in Seville, <a href="Santiponce">Santiponce</a>.

As in any modern society, transport systems are an essential structural element of the functioning of Andalusia. The transportation network facilitates territorial coordination, economic development and distribution, and intercity transportation.

In urban transport, underdeveloped public transport systems put pedestrian traffic and other non-motorized traffic are at a disadvantage compared to the use of private vehicles. Several Andalusian capitals—Córdoba, Granada and Seville—have recently been trying to remedy this by strengthening their public transport systems and providing a better infrastructure for the use of <a href="bicycle">bicycle</a>s.

For over a century, the conventional rail network has been centralized on the regional capital, Seville, and the national capital, Madrid; in general, there are no direct connections between provincial capitals. High-speed <a href="AVE">AVE</a> trains run from Madrid via Córdoba to Seville and Málaga. Further AVE routes are under construction. The Madrid-Córdoba-Seville route was the first high-velocity route in Spain (operating since 1992). Other principal routes are the one from Algeciras to Seville and from <a href="Almer%C3%ADa">Almería</a> via Granada to Madrid.

Most of the principal roads have been converted into <a href="limited%20access%20highway">limited access highway</a>s known as "<a href="autov%C3%ADa">autovía</a>s". The Autovía del Este (<a href="Autov%C3%ADa%20A-4">Autovía A-4</a>) runs from Madrid through the Despeñaperros Natural Park, then via Bailén, Córdoba, and Seville to Cádiz, and is part of <a href="European%20route%20E05">European route E05</a> in the <a href="International%20E-road%20network">International E-road network</a>. The other main road in the region is the portion of <a href="European%20route%20E15">European route E15</a>, which runs as the Autovia del Mediterráneo along the Spanish Mediterranean coast. Parts of this constitute the <a href="superhighway">superhighway</a> <a href="Autopista%20AP-7">Autopista AP-7</a>, while in other areas it is <a href="Autov%C3%ADa%20A-7">Autovía A-7</a>. Both of these roads run generally east-west, although the Autovía A-4 turns to the south in western Andalusia.

Other first-order roads include the <a href="Autov%C3%ADa%20A-48">Autovía A-48</a> roughly along the Atlantic coast from Cádiz to Algeciras, continuing European route E05 to meet up with <a href="European%20route%20E15">European route E15</a>; the Autovía del Quinto Centenario (<a href="Autov%C3%ADa%20A-49">Autovía A-49</a>), which continues west from Seville (where the Autovía A-4 turns toward the south) and goes on to Huelva and into Portugal as <a href="European%20route%20E01">European route E01</a>; the Autovía Ruta de la Plata (<a href="Autov%C3%ADa%20A-66">Autovía A-66</a>), <a href="European%20route%20E803">European route E803</a>, which roughly corresponds to the ancient Roman '<a href="V%C3%ADa%20de%20la%20Plata">Silver Route</a>' from the mines of northern Spain, and runs north from Seville; the Autovía de Málaga (<a href="Autov%C3%ADa%20A-45">Autovía A-45</a>), which runs south from Córdoba to Málaga; and the Autovía de Sierra Nevada (<a href="Autov%C3%ADa%20A-44">Autovía A-44</a>), part of <a href="European%20route%20E902">European route E902</a>, which runs south from Jaén to the Mediterranean coast at Motril.

As of 2008 Andalusia has six public airports, all of which can legally handle international flights; however the <a href="M%C3%A1laga%20Airport">Málaga Airport</a> is dominant, handling 60.67 percent of passengers and 85 percent of its international traffic. The <a href="Seville%20Airport">Seville Airport</a> handles another 20.12 percent of traffic, and the <a href="Jerez%20Airport">Jerez Airport</a> 7.17 percent, so that these three airports account for 87.96 percent of traffic.

Málaga Airport is the international airport that offers a wide variety of international destinations. It has a daily link with twenty cities in Spain and over a hundred cities in Europe (mainly in Great Britain, Central Europe and the Nordic countries but also the main cities of Eastern Europe: <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>, <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>, <a href="Riga">Riga</a> or <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>), North Africa, Middle East (<a href="Riyadh">Riyadh</a>, <a href="Jeddah">Jeddah</a> and <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>) and North America (<a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>, <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> and <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>).

The main ports are Algeciras (for freight and container traffic) and Málaga for cruise ships. Algeciras is Spain's leading commercial port, with of cargo in 2004. Seville has Spain's only commercial river port. Other significant commercial ports in Andalusia are the ports of the <a href="Bay%20of%20C%C3%A1diz">Bay of Cádiz</a>, Almería and Huelva.

The Council of Government has approved a Plan of Infrastructures for the Sustainability of Transport in Andalusia (PISTA) 2007–2013, which plans an investment of 30 billion euros during that period.

The lack of high-quality <a href="fossil%20fuel">fossil fuel</a>s in Andalusia has led to a strong dependency on <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a> imports. Still, Andalusia has a strong potential for the development of <a href="renewable%20energy">renewable energy</a>, above all <a href="wind%20energy">wind energy</a>. The Andalusian Energy Agency established in 2005 by the autonomous government, is a new governmental organ charged with the development of energy policy and provision of a sufficient supply of energy for the community.

The infrastructure for production of <a href="electricity">electricity</a> consists of eight large <a href="thermal%20power%20station">thermal power station</a>s, more than 70 <a href="hydroelectricity">hydroelectric</a> power plants, two <a href="wind%20farm">wind farm</a>s, and 14 major <a href="cogeneration">cogeneration</a> facilities. Historically, the largest Andalusian business in this sector was the <a href="Compa%C3%B1%C3%ADa%20Sevillana%20de%20Electricidad">Compañía Sevillana de Electricidad</a>, founded in 1894, absorbed into <a href="Endesa%20%28Spain%29">Endesa</a> in 1996.

The <a href="Solar%20power%20tower">Solar power tower</a> <a href="PS10%20solar%20power%20tower">PS10</a> was built by the Andalusian firm <a href="Abengoa">Abengoa</a> in <a href="Sanl%C3%BAcar%20la%20Mayor">Sanlúcar la Mayor</a> in the province of Seville, and began operating in March 2007. It is the largest existing solar power facility in Europe. Smaller solar power stations, also recent, exist at <a href="C%C3%BAllar">Cúllar</a> and <a href="Galera%2C%20Granada">Galera, Granada</a>, inaugurated by <a href="Geosol">Geosol</a> and <a href="Caja%20Granada">Caja Granada</a>. Two more large thermosolar facilities, <a href="Andasol">Andasol I y II</a>, planned at Hoya de <a href="Guadix">Guadix</a> in the province of Granada are expected to supply electricity to half a million households. The <a href="Plataforma%20Solar%20de%20Almer%C3%ADa">Plataforma Solar de Almería</a> (PSA) in the Tabernas Desert is an important center for the exploration of the solar energy.

The largest wind power firm in the region is the <a href="Sociedad%20E%C3%B3lica%20de%20Andaluc%C3%ADa">Sociedad Eólica de Andalucía</a>, formed by the merger of <a href="Planta%20E%C3%B3lica%20del%20Sur%20S.A.">Planta Eólica del Sur S.A.</a> and <a href="Energ%C3%ADa%20E%C3%B3lica%20del%20Estrecho%20S.A.">Energía Eólica del Estrecho S.A.</a>

As throughout Spain, basic education in Andalusia is free and compulsory. Students are required to complete ten years of schooling, and may not leave school before the age of 16, after which students may continue on to a <a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">baccalaureate</a>, to intermediate <a href="vocational%20education">vocational education</a>, to intermediate-level schooling in arts and design, to intermediate sports studies, or to the working world.

Andalusia has a tradition of higher education dating back to the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> and the <a href="Madrasah%20of%20Granada">Madrasah of Granada</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Baeza">University of Baeza</a>, and <a href="University%20of%20Osuna">University of Osuna</a>.

As of 2009, there are ten private or public universities in Andalucia. University studies are structured in cycles, awarding degrees based on <a href="European%20Credit%20Transfer%20and%20Accumulation%20System">ECTS credits</a> in accord with the <a href="Bologna%20process">Bologna process</a>, which the Andalusian universities are adopting in accord with the other universities of the <a href="European%20Higher%20Education%20Area">European Higher Education Area</a>.

Responsibility for healthcare jurisdictions devolved from the Spanish government to Andalusia with the enactment of the Statute of Autonomy. Thus, the <a href="Andalusian%20Health%20Service">Andalusian Health Service</a> ("Servicio Andaluz de Salud") currently manages almost all public health resources of the Community, with such exceptions as health resources for prisoners and members of the military, which remain under central administration.

According to the Outreach Program for Science in Andalusia, Andalusia contributes 14 percent of Spain's scientific production behind only Madrid and Catalonia among the autonomous communities, even though regional investment in <a href="research%20and%20development">research and development</a> (R&D) as a proportion of <a href="GDP">GDP</a> is below the national average. The lack of research capacity in business and the low participation of the private sector in research has resulted in R&D taking place largely in the public sector.

The Council of Innovation, Science and Business is the organ of the autonomous government responsible for universities, research, technological development, industry, and energy. The council coordinates and initiates scientific and technical innovation through specialized centers an initiatives such as the <a href="Andalusian%20Center%20for%20Marine%20Science%20and%20Technology">Andalusian Center for Marine Science and Technology</a> ("Centro Andaluz de Ciencia y Tecnología Marina") and <a href="Technological%20Corporation%20of%20Andalusia">Technological Corporation of Andalusia</a> ("Corporación Tecnológica de Andalucía").

Within the private sphere, although also promoted by public administration, technology parks have been established throughout the Community, such as the <a href="Technological%20Park%20of%20Andalucia">Technological Park of Andalucia</a> ("Parque Tecnológico de Andalucía") in <a href="Campanillas">Campanillas</a> on the outskirts of Málaga, and <a href="Cartuja%2093">Cartuja 93</a> in Seville. Some of these parks specialize in specific sector, such as <a href="Aer%C3%B3polis">Aerópolis</a> in <a href="aerospace">aerospace</a> or <a href="Geolit">Geolit</a> in <a href="food%20technology">food technology</a>. The Andalusian government deployed 600,000 <a href="Ubuntu%20%28operating%20system%29">Ubuntu</a> desktop computers in their schools.

Andalusia has international, national, regional, and local media organizations, which are active gathering and disseminating information (as well as creating and disseminating entertainment).

The most notable is the public <a href="Radio%20y%20Televisi%C3%B3n%20de%20Andaluc%C3%ADa">Radio y Televisión de Andalucía</a> (RTVA), broadcasting on two regional television channels, <a href="Canal%20Sur">Canal Sur</a> and <a href="Canal%20Sur%202">Canal Sur 2</a>, four regional radio stations, <a href="Canal%20Sur%20Radio">Canal Sur Radio</a>, <a href="Canal%20Fiesta%20Radio">Canal Fiesta Radio</a>, <a href="Radio%20Andaluc%C3%ADa%20Informaci%C3%B3n">Radio Andalucía Información</a> and <a href="Canal%20Flamenco%20Radio">Canal Flamenco Radio</a>, as well as various digital signals, most notably <a href="Canal%20Sur%20Andaluc%C3%ADa">Canal Sur Andalucía</a> available on <a href="cable%20television">cable TV</a> throughout Spain.

Different newspapers are published for each Andalusian provincial capital, <a href="comarca">comarca</a>, or important city. Often, the same newspaper organization publishes different local editions with much shared content, with different <a href="masthead%20%28publishing%29">mastheads</a> and different local coverage. There are also popular papers distributed without charge, again typically with local editions that share much of their content.

No single Andalusian newspaper is distributed throughout the region, not even with local editions. In eastern Andalusia the "<a href="Diario%20Ideal">Diario Ideal</a>" has editions tailored for the provinces if Almería, Granada, and Jaén. <a href="Grupo%20Joly">Grupo Joly</a> is based in Andalucia, backed by Andalusian capital, and publishes eight daily newspapers there. Efforts to create a newspaper for the entire autonomous region have not succeeded (the most recent as of 2009 was the "<a href="Diario%20de%20Andaluc%C3%ADa">Diario de Andalucía</a>"). The national press ("<a href="El%20Pa%C3%ADs">El País</a>", "<a href="El%20Mundo%20%28Spain%29">El Mundo</a>", "<a href="ABC%20%28newspaper%29">ABC</a>", etc.) include sections or editions specific to Andalusia.

Andalusia has two public television stations, both operated by <a href="Radio%20y%20Televisi%C3%B3n%20de%20Andaluc%C3%ADa">Radio y Televisión de Andalucía</a> (RTVA):

In addition, RTVA also operates the national and international cable channel Canal Sur Andalucía, which first broadcast in 1996 as Andalucía Televisión.

There are four public radio stations in the region, all operated by RTVA:

The culture of Andalusia has been shaped by its particular history and geography, as well as its complex flows of population. Andalusia has been home to a succession of peoples and civilizations, many very different from one another, each impacting the settled inhabitants. The ancient <a href="Iberians">Iberians</a> were followed by <a href="Celts">Celts</a>, <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>ns and other Eastern Mediterranean traders, <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>, <a href="Migration%20Period">migrating Germanic tribes</a>, North African <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s, and the <a href="Castilian%20people">Castilians</a> and other Spanish of the "<a href="Reconquista">Reconquista</a>". All have affected Andalusian identity and culture, which was already delineated in the 19th century and diffused widely in the literary and pictorial genre of the "<a href="costumbrismo%20andaluz">costumbrismo andaluz</a>".
In the 19th century, Andalusian culture came to be widely viewed as the Spanish culture "par excellence", in part thanks to the perceptions of <a href="romanticism">romantic</a> travellers. In the words of <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Ortega%20y%20Gasset">Ortega y Gasset</a>:

Andalusia has been the birthplace of many great artists: the classic painters <a href="Diego%20Vel%C3%A1zquez">Velázquez</a>, <a href="Bartolom%C3%A9%20Esteban%20Murillo">Murillo</a>, and <a href="Juan%20de%20Vald%C3%A9s%20Leal">Juan de Valdés Leal</a>; the sculptors <a href="Juan%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20Monta%C3%B1%C3%A9s">Juan Martínez Montañés</a>, <a href="Alonso%20Cano">Alonso Cano</a> and <a href="Pedro%20de%20Mena">Pedro de Mena</a>; and such modern painters as <a href="Daniel%20V%C3%A1zquez%20D%C3%ADaz">Daniel Vázquez Díaz</a> and <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>.

The composer <a href="Manuel%20de%20Falla">Manuel de Falla</a> was from Cádiz and incorporated typical Andalusian melodies in his works, as did <a href="Joaqu%C3%ADn%20Turina">Joaquín Turina</a>, from Seville. The great singer <a href="Camar%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20Isla">Camarón de la Isla</a> was born in <a href="San%20Fernando%2C%20C%C3%A1diz">San Fernando, Cádiz</a>, and <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20Segovia">Andrés Segovia</a> who helped shape the romantic-modernist approach to <a href="classical%20guitar">classical guitar</a>, was born in <a href="Linares%2C%20Ja%C3%A9n">Linares, Jaén</a>.

Since the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> era, Andalusia has preserved important <a href="megalith">megalith</a>s, such as the <a href="dolmen">dolmen</a>s at the <a href="Cueva%20de%20Menga">Cueva de Menga</a> and the <a href="Dolmen%20de%20Viera">Dolmen de Viera</a>, both at <a href="Antequera">Antequera</a>. Archeologists have found <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> cities at <a href="Los%20Millares">Los Millares</a> and <a href="El%20Argar">El Argar</a>. Archeological digs at Doña Blanca in <a href="El%20Puerto%20de%20Santa%20Mar%C3%ADa">El Puerto de Santa María</a> have revealed the oldest <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>ns city in the Iberian peninsula; major ruins have also been revealed at Roman <a href="Italica">Italica</a> near Seville.

Some of the greatest architecture in Andalusia dates from the Muslim era: the <a href="Alhambra">Alhambra</a> and the <a href="Great%20Mosque%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Great Mosque of Córdoba</a>.

The traditional architecture of Andalusia retains its <a href="Architecture%20of%20ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> and <a href="Islamic%20architecture">Arab</a> roots, with a marked Mediterranean character strongly conditioned by the climate. Traditional urban houses are constructed with shared walls to minimize exposure to high exterior temperatures. Solid exterior walls are <a href="Whitewash">painted</a> with <a href="Lime%20%28material%29">lime</a> to minimize the heating effects of the sun. In accord with the climate and tradition of each area, the roofs may be <a href="Terrace%20%28building%29">terraces</a> or tiled in the Roman <a href="imbrex%20and%20tegula">imbrex and tegula</a> style. One of the most characteristic elements (and one of the most obviously influenced by Roman and <a href="Moorish%20architecture">North African architecture</a>) is the interior <a href="patio">patio</a> or <a href="courtyard">courtyard</a>; the patios of Córdoba are particularly famous. Other characteristic elements are decorative (and functional) <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> <a href="grating">grating</a>s, and the <a href="tile">tile</a>s known as "<a href="azulejo">azulejo</a>s". Landscaping—both for common private homes and homes on a more lavish scale—also carries on older traditions, with plants, flowers, and fountains, pools, and streams of water. Beyond these general elements, there are also specific local architectural styles, such as the <a href="flat%20roof">flat roof</a>s, roofed chimneys, and radically extended <a href="Balcony">balconies</a> of the <a href="Alpujarra">Alpujarra</a>, the cave dwellings of <a href="Guadix">Guadix</a> and of Granada's <a href="Sacromonte">Sacromonte</a>, or the traditional architecture of the <a href="Mancomunidad%20de%20Municipios%20Marquesado%20del%20Zenete">Marquisate of Zenete</a>.

The monumental architecture of the centuries immediately after the Reconquista often displayed an assertion of Christian hegemony through architecture that referenced non-Arab influences. Some of the greatest <a href="Renaissance%20architecture">Renaissance</a> buildings in Andalusia are from the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ja%C3%A9n">then-kingdom of Jaén</a>: the <a href="Ja%C3%A9n%20Cathedral">Jaén Cathedral</a>, designed in part by <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20de%20Vandelvira">Andrés de Vandelvira</a>, served as a model for the <a href="Cathedral%20of%20Malaga">Cathedral of Malaga</a> and <a href="Cathedral%20of%20Guadix">Guadix</a>; the centers of <a href="%C3%9Abeda">Úbeda</a> and <a href="Baeza">Baeza</a>, dating largely from this era, are UNESCO <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>s. Seville and its kingdom also figured prominently in this era, as is shown by the <a href="Casa%20consistorial%20de%20Sevilla">Casa consistorial de Sevilla</a>, the <a href="Hospital%20de%20las%20Cinco%20Llagas">Hospital de las Cinco Llagas</a> or the <a href="Charterhouse%20of%20Jerez%20de%20la%20Frontera">Charterhouse of Jerez de la Frontera</a>. The <a href="Palace%20of%20Charles%20V">Palace of Charles V</a> in Granada is uniquely important for its <a href="Italianate%20architecture">Italianate</a> purism. Andalusia also has such <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque</a>-era buildings as the <a href="Palace%20of%20San%20Telmo">Palace of San Telmo</a> in Seville (seat of the current autonomic presidency), the <a href="Church%20of%20Our%20Lady%20of%20Reposo">Church of Our Lady of Reposo</a> in <a href="Campillos">Campillos</a>, and the <a href="Granada%20Charterhouse">Granada Charterhouse</a>. <a href="Academic%20art">Academicism</a> gave the region the <a href="Royal%20Tobacco%20Factory">Royal Tobacco Factory</a> in Seville and <a href="Neoclassicism">Neoclassicism</a> the nucleus of Cádiz, such as its <a href="Ayuntamiento%20de%20C%C3%A1diz">city hall</a>, <a href="C%C3%A1rcel%20Real%20%28C%C3%A1diz%29">Royal Prison</a> and the <a href="Oratorio%20de%20la%20Santa%20Cueva%20%28C%C3%A1diz%29">Oratorio de la Santa Cueva</a>.

<a href="Revivalism%20%28architecture%29">Revivalist</a> architecture in the 19th and 20th centuries contributed the buildings of the <a href="Ibero-American%20Exposition%20of%201929">Ibero-American Exposition of 1929</a> in Seville, including the <a href="Neo-Mud%C3%A9jar">Neo-Mudéjar</a> <a href="Plaza%20de%20Espa%C3%B1a%20%28Seville%29">Plaza de España</a>. Andalusia also preserves an important industrial patrimony related to various economic activities.

Besides the architecture of the cities, there is also much outstanding rural architecture: houses, as well as ranch and farm buildings and <a href="dog%20house">dog house</a>s.

The <a href="Iberian%20sculpture">Iberian reliefs</a> of <a href="Osuna">Osuna</a>, <a href="Lady%20of%20Baza">Lady of Baza</a>, and <a href="Le%C3%B3n%20de%20Bujalance">León de Bujalance</a>, the Phoenician <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagi</a> of Cádiz, and the <a href="Roman%20sculpture">Roman sculpture</a>s of the <a href="Baetica">Baetic</a> cities such as <a href="Italica">Italica</a> give evidence of traditions of sculpture in Andalusia dating back to antiquity. There are few significant surviving sculptures from the time of <a href="al-Andalus">al-Andalus</a>; two notable exceptions are the lions of the Alhambra and of the <a href="Marist%C3%A1n%20of%20Granada">Maristán of Granada</a> (the Muslim-era hospital in the Albaicín).

The <a href="Sevillian%20school%20of%20sculpture">Sevillian school of sculpture</a> dating from the 13th century onward and the <a href="Granadan%20school%20of%20sculpture">Granadan school</a> beginning toward the end of the 16th century both focused primarily on Christian religious subject matter, including many wooden <a href="altarpiece">altarpiece</a>s. Notable sculptors in these traditions include <a href="Lorenzo%20Mercadante%20de%20Breta%C3%B1a">Lorenzo Mercadante de Bretaña</a>, <a href="Pedro%20Mill%C3%A1n">Pedro Millán</a>, <a href="Juan%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20Monta%C3%B1%C3%A9s">Juan Martínez Montañés</a>, <a href="Pedro%20Rold%C3%A1n">Pedro Roldán</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20de%20Arce">José de Arce</a>, <a href="Jer%C3%B3nimo%20de%20Balb%C3%A1s">Jerónimo Balbás</a>, <a href="Alonso%20Cano">Alonso Cano</a>, and <a href="Pedro%20de%20Mena">Pedro de Mena</a>.

Non-religious sculpture has also existed in Andalusia since antiquity. A fine example from the Renaissance era is the decoration of the <a href="Casa%20de%20Pilatos">Casa de Pilatos</a> in Seville. Nonetheless, non-religious sculpture played a relatively minor role until such 19th-century sculptors as <a href="Antonio%20Susillo">Antonio Susillo</a>.

As in sculpture, there were <a href="Sevillian%20school%20of%20painting">Sevillian</a> and the <a href="Granadan%20school%20of%20painting">Granadan</a> schools of painting. The latter has figured prominently in the history of Spanish art since the 15th century and includes such important artists as <a href="Francisco%20Zurbar%C3%A1n">Zurbarán</a>, <a href="Diego%20Vel%C3%A1zquez">Velázquez</a> and <a href="Bartolom%C3%A9%20Esteban%20Murillo">Murillo</a>, as well as <a href="aesthetics">theoreticians of art</a> such as <a href="Francisco%20Pacheco">Francisco Pacheco</a>. The <a href="Museum%20of%20Fine%20Arts%20of%20Seville">Museum of Fine Arts of Seville</a> and the <a href="Museo%20del%20Prado">Prado</a> contain numerous representative works of the Sevillian school of painting.

A specific <a href="Romanticism">romantic</a> genre known as "<a href="costumbrismo%20andaluz">costumbrismo andaluz</a>" depicts traditional and folkloric Andalusian subjects, such as bullfighting scenes, dogs, and scenes from Andalusia's history. Important artists in this genre include <a href="Manuel%20Barr%C3%B3n">Manuel Barrón</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Ramos">José García Ramos</a>, <a href="Gonzalo%20Bilbao">Gonzalo Bilbao</a> and <a href="Julio%20Romero%20de%20Torres">Julio Romero de Torres</a>. The genre is well represented in the private <a href="Carmen%20Cervera">Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection</a>, part of which is on display at Madrid's <a href="Thyssen-Bornemisza%20Museum">Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum</a> and <a href="Carmen%20Thyssen%20Museum">Carmen Thyssen Museum</a> in Málaga.

Málaga also has been and is an important artistic center. Its most illustrious representative was <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a>, one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. The city has a <a href="Museo%20Picasso%20M%C3%A1laga">Museum</a> and <a href="Fundaci%C3%B3n%20Picasso">Natal House Foundation</a>, dedicated to the painter.

Andalusia plays a significant role in the history of <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish language</a> literature, however not all of the important literature associated with Andalusia was written in Spanish. Before 1492, there was the literature written in <a href="Andalusian%20Arabic">Andalusian Arabic</a>. Hispano-Arabic authors native to the region include
<a href="Ibn%20Hazm">Ibn Hazm</a>, <a href="Ibn%20Zaydun">Ibn Zaydun</a>, <a href="Ibn%20Tufail">Ibn Tufail</a>, <a href="Al-Mu%27tamid">Al-Mu'tamid</a>, <a href="Ibn%20al-Khatib">Ibn al-Khatib</a>, <a href="Ibn%20al-Yayyab">Ibn al-Yayyab</a>, and <a href="Ibn%20Zamrak">Ibn Zamrak</a> or Andalusian Hebrew poets as <a href="Solomon%20Ibn%20Gabirol">Solomon Ibn Gabirol</a>. <a href="Ibn%20Quzman">Ibn Quzman</a>, of the 12th century, crafted poems in the colloquial Andalusian language.

In 1492 <a href="Antonio%20de%20Nebrija">Antonio de Nebrija</a> published his celebrated "<a href="Gram%C3%A1tica%20de%20la%20lengua%20castellana">Gramática de la lengua castellana</a>" ("Grammar of the Castilian language"), the first such work for a modern European language. In 1528 <a href="Francisco%20Delicado">Francisco Delicado</a> wrote "", a novel in the orbit of "<a href="La%20Celestina">La Celestina</a>", and in 1599 the Sevillian <a href="Mateo%20Alem%C3%A1n">Mateo Alemán</a> wrote the first part of "<a href="Guzm%C3%A1n%20de%20Alfarache">Guzmán de Alfarache</a>", the first <a href="picaresque%20novel">picaresque novel</a> with a known author.

The prominent <a href="humanism">humanist</a> literary school of Seville included such writers as <a href="Juan%20de%20Mal%20Lara">Juan de Mal Lara</a>, <a href="Fernando%20de%20Herrera">Fernando de Herrera</a>, <a href="Gutierre%20de%20Cetina">Gutierre de Cetina</a>, <a href="Luis%20Barahona%20de%20Soto">Luis Barahona de Soto</a>, <a href="Juan%20de%20la%20Cueva">Juan de la Cueva</a>, <a href="Gonzalo%20Argote%20de%20Molina">Gonzalo Argote de Molina</a>, and <a href="Rodrigo%20Caro">Rodrigo Caro</a>. The Cordoban <a href="Luis%20de%20G%C3%B3ngora%20y%20Argote">Luis de Góngora</a> was the greatest exponent of the "<a href="culteranismo">culteranismo</a>" of <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> poetry in the <a href="Siglo%20de%20Oro">Siglo de Oro</a>; indeed, the style is often referred to as "Góngorismo".

Literary Romanticism in Spain had one of its great centers in Andalusia, with such authors as <a href="%C3%81ngel%20de%20Saavedra%2C%20Duke%20of%20Rivas">Ángel de Saavedra, Duke of Rivas</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Cadalso">José Cadalso</a> and <a href="Gustavo%20Adolfo%20B%C3%A9cquer">Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer</a>. "Costumbrismo andaluz" existed in literature as much as in visual art, with notable examples being the "Escenas andaluzas" of <a href="Seraf%C3%ADn%20Est%C3%A9banez%20Calder%C3%B3n">Serafín Estébanez Calderón</a> and the works of <a href="Pedro%20Antonio%20de%20Alarc%C3%B3n">Pedro Antonio de Alarcón</a>.

Andalusian authors <a href="%C3%81ngel%20Ganivet">Ángel Ganivet</a>, <a href="Manuel%20G%C3%B3mez-Moreno%20Mart%C3%ADnez">Manuel Gómez-Moreno</a>, <a href="Manuel%20Machado%20y%20Ruiz">Manuel</a> and <a href="Antonio%20Machado">Antonio Machado</a>, and <a href="Francisco%20Villaespesa">Francisco Villaespesa</a> are all generally counted in the <a href="Generation%20of%20%2798">Generation of '98</a>. Also of this generation were the <a href="Hermanos%20%C3%81lvarez%20Quintero">Hermanos Álvarez Quintero</a>, dramatists who faithfully captured <a href="Andalusian%20Spanish">Andalusian dialects</a> and idiosyncrasies. Also of note, 1956 <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a>-winning poet <a href="Juan%20Ram%C3%B3n%20Jim%C3%A9nez">Juan Ramón Jiménez</a> was a native of <a href="Moguer">Moguer</a>, near Huelva.

A large portion of the "<a href="avant%20garde">avant garde</a>" <a href="Generation%20of%20%2727">Generation of '27</a> who gathered at the <a href="Ateneo%20de%20Sevilla">Ateneo de Sevilla</a> on the 300th anniversary of Góngora's death were Andalusians: <a href="Federico%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Lorca">Federico García Lorca</a>, <a href="Luis%20Cernuda">Luis Cernuda</a>, <a href="Rafael%20Alberti">Rafael Alberti</a>, <a href="Manuel%20Altolaguirre">Manuel Altolaguirre</a>, <a href="Emilio%20Prados">Emilio Prados</a>, and 1977 Nobel laureate <a href="Vicente%20Aleixandre">Vicente Aleixandre</a>.

Certain Andalusian fictional characters have become universal archetypes: <a href="Prosper%20Merim%C3%A9e">Prosper Merimée</a>'s gypsy "Carmen", <a href="P.%20D.%20Eastman">P. D. Eastman</a>'s "Perro", <a href="Pierre%20Beaumarchais">Pierre Beaumarchais</a>'s "Fígaro", and <a href="Tirso%20de%20Molina">Tirso de Molina</a>'s "Don Juan".

As in most regions of Spain, the principal form of popular verse is the <a href="romance%20%28meter%29">romance</a>, although there are also <a href="strophe">strophe</a>s specific to Andalusia, such as the "<a href="sole%C3%A1">soleá</a>" or the "<a href="soleariya">soleariya</a>". Ballads, lullabies, street vendor's cries, nursery rhymes, and work songs are plentiful.

Among the philosophers native to the region can be counted <a href="Seneca%20the%20Younger">Seneca</a>, <a href="Solomon%20Ibn%20Gabirol">Avicebron</a>, <a href="Maimonides">Maimonides</a>, <a href="Averroes">Averroes</a>, <a href="Fern%C3%A1n%20P%C3%A9rez%20de%20Oliva">Fernán Pérez de Oliva</a>, <a href="Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Fox%20Morcillo">Sebastián Fox Morcillo</a>, <a href="%C3%81ngel%20Ganivet">Ángel Ganivet</a>, <a href="Francisco%20Giner%20de%20los%20R%C3%ADos">Francisco Giner de los Ríos</a> and <a href="Mar%C3%ADa%20Zambrano">María Zambrano</a>.

The music of Andalusia includes traditional and contemporary music, folk and composed music, and ranges from <a href="flamenco">flamenco</a> to <a href="rock%20music">rock</a>. Conversely, certain metric, melodic and harmonic characteristics are considered Andalusian even when written or performed by musicians from elsewhere.

Flamenco, perhaps the most characteristically Andalusian genre of music and dance, originated in the 18th century, but is based in earlier forms from the region. The influence of the traditional music and dance of the <a href="Romani%20people%20in%20Spain">Romani people</a> or Gypsies is particularly clear. The genre embraces distinct vocal ("<a href="cante%20flamenco">cante flamenco</a>"), guitar ("<a href="toque%20flamenco">toque flamenco</a>"), and dance ("<a href="baile%20flamenco">baile flamenco</a>") styles.

The Andalusian Statute of Autonomy reflects the cultural importance of flamenco in its Articles 37.1.18 and 68:

Fundamental in the history of Andalusian music are the composers <a href="Crist%C3%B3bal%20de%20Morales">Cristóbal de Morales</a>, <a href="Francisco%20Guerrero%20%28composer%29">Francisco Guerrero</a>, <a href="Francisco%20Correa%20de%20Arauxo">Francisco Correa de Arauxo</a>, <a href="Manuel%20del%20P%C3%B3pulo%20Vicente%20Garc%C3%ADa">Manuel García</a>, <a href="Manuel%20de%20Falla">Manuel de Falla</a>, <a href="Joaqu%C3%ADn%20Turina">Joaquín Turina</a>, and <a href="Manuel%20Castillo">Manuel Castillo</a>, as well as the father of modern <a href="classical%20guitar">classical guitar</a>, the guitarist <a href="Andr%C3%A9s%20Segovia">Andrés Segovia</a>. Mention should also be made of the great folk artists of the "<a href="copla%20%28music%29">copla (music)</a>" and the "<a href="cante%20hondo">cante hondo</a>", such as <a href="Roc%C3%ADo%20Jurado">Rocío Jurado</a>, <a href="Lola%20Flores">Lola Flores</a> ("La Faraona", "the <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>"), <a href="Juanito%20Valderrama">Juanito Valderrama</a> and the revolutionary <a href="Camar%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20Isla">Camarón de la Isla</a>.

Prominent Andalusian rock groups include <a href="Triana%20%28band%29">Triana</a> and <a href="Medina%20Azahara%20%28band%29">Medina Azahara</a>. The duo <a href="Los%20del%20R%C3%ADo">Los del Río</a> from <a href="Dos%20Hermanas">Dos Hermanas</a> had international success with their "<a href="Macarena%20%28song%29">Macarena</a>", including playing at a <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a> half-time show in the United States, where their song has also been used as campaign music by the <a href="United%20States%20Democratic%20Party">Democratic Party</a>. Other notables include the singer, songwriter, and poet <a href="Joaqu%C3%ADn%20Sabina">Joaquín Sabina</a>, <a href="Isabel%20Pantoja">Isabel Pantoja</a>, <a href="Rosa%20L%C3%B3pez">Rosa López</a>, who represented Spain at <a href="Eurovision">Eurovision</a> in 2002, and <a href="David%20Bisbal">David Bisbal</a>.

The portrayal of Andalusia in film is often reduced to archetypes: flamenco, <a href="Spanish-style%20bullfighting">bullfighting</a>, Catholic pageantry, <a href="outlaw">brigands</a>, the property-rich and cash-poor "señorito andaluz" and emigrants. These images particularly predominated from the 1920s through the 1960s, and helped to consolidate a cliched image of the region. In a very different vein, the province of Almería was the filming location for many <a href="Western%20%28genre%29">Westerns</a>, especially (but by no means exclusively) the Italian-directed <a href="Spaghetti%20Western">Spaghetti Western</a>s. During the dictatorship of <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a>, this was the extent of the film industry in Andalusia.

Nonetheless, Andalusian film has roots as far back as <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Val%20del%20Omar">José Val del Omar</a> in the pre-Franco years, and since the <a href="Spanish%20transition%20to%20democracy">Spanish transition to democracy</a> has brought forth numerous nationally and internationally respected directors: <a href="Antonio%20Cuadri">Antonio Cuadri</a> ("<a href="Heart%20of%20the%20Earth">Heart of the Earth</a>"), <a href="Chus%20Guti%C3%A9rrez">Chus Gutiérrez</a> ("<a href="Poniente%20%28film%29">Poniente</a>"), <a href="Chiqui%20Carabante">Chiqui Carabante</a> ("<a href="Carlos%20Against%20the%20World">Carlos Against the World</a>"), <a href="Alberto%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Librero">Alberto Rodríguez</a> ("<a href="7%20Virgins">7 Virgins</a>"), <a href="Benito%20Zambrano">Benito Zambrano</a> ("<a href="Solas%20%28film%29">Solas</a>"), and <a href="Antonio%20Banderas">Antonio Banderas</a> ("<a href="Summer%20Rain%20%282006%20film%29">Summer Rain</a>").

Counting together feature films, documentaries, television programs, music videos etc., Andalusia has boomed from 37 projects shooting in 1999 to 1,054 in 2007, with the figure for 2007 including 19 feature films. Although feature films are the most prestigious, commercials and television are currently more economically important to the region.

The <a href="Filmoteca%20de%20Andaluc%C3%ADa">Filmoteca de Andalucía</a>, headquartered in Córdoba, is a government-run entity in charge of the investigation, collection and diffusion of Andalusian cinematic heritage. Other important contributors to this last activity are such annual film festivals as the ("Festival de Málaga Cine Español (FMCE)"), the most important festival dedicated exclusively to cinema made in Spain, the <a href="Seville%20Festival%20of%20European%20Film">Seville Festival of European Film</a> (SFCE), the <a href="International%20Festival%20of%20Short%20Films%20-%20Almer%C3%ADa%20in%20Short">International Festival of Short Films - Almería in Short</a>, the <a href="Huelva%20Festival%20of%20Latin%20American%20Film">Huelva Festival of Latin American Film</a>, the <a href="Atlantic%20Film%20Show">Atlantic Film Show</a> in Cádiz, the <a href="Islantilla%20Festival%20of%20Film%20and%20Television">Islantilla Festival of Film and Television</a> and the <a href="African%20Film%20Festival%20of%20Tarifa">African Film Festival of Tarifa</a>.

Andalusia has a wide array of social customs, many of which have their roots in the Islamic traditions integrated into the culture of the area under Muslim rule. Each sub-region in Andalusia has its own unique customs that represent a fusion of Catholicism and local folklore. Traditional dress in all areas of Andalusia tends to be colorful and involve various head coverings reminiscent of a Muslim past. Cities like Almería have been influenced historically by both <a href="Granada">Granada</a> and Murcia in the use of traditional head coverings. The "sombrero de Labrador", a worker's hat made of black velvet, is a signature style of the region.

In Cádiz, traditional costumes with rural origins are worn at bullfights and at parties on the large estates. The "tablao flamenco" dance and the accompanying "<a href="cante%20jondo">cante jondo</a>" vocal style originated in Granada. They are believed to have their roots in oriental, Gregorian, Moorish, and Jewish music. This music is most often performed by the gypsy <a href="Romani%20people">Romani</a>, who are more numerous in Granada than anywhere else in Spain. One of the most distinctive cultural events in Andalusia is the <a href="Romeria%20de%20El%20Rocio">Romeria de El Rocio</a> in May. It consists of a pilgrimage to the <a href="Hermitage%20of%20El%20Roc%C3%ADo">Hermitage of El Rocío</a> in the countryside near <a href="Almonte%2C%20Spain">Almonte</a>, in honor of the <a href="Virgin%20of%20El%20Roc%C3%ADo">Virgin of El Rocío</a>, an image of the <a href="Virgin%20and%20Child">Virgin and Child</a>, which was supposedly hidden from the Muslims during Moorish rule. In recent times the "Romería" has attracted roughly a million pilgrims each year.

In <a href="Province%20of%20Ja%C3%A9n%20%28Spain%29">Jaén</a>, the <a href="saeta%20%28flamenco%29">saeta</a> is a revered form of Spanish religious song, whose form and style has evolved over many centuries. Saetas evoke strong emotion and are sung most often during public processions. "Verdiales", based upon the <a href="Fandango%20%28dance%29">fandango</a>, are a flamenco music style and song form originating in Almogia, near Málaga. For this reason, the Verdiales are sometimes known as "Fandangos de Málaga." The region also has a rich musical tradition of flamenco songs, or <a href="Palo%20%28flamenco%29">palos</a> called <a href="cartageneras">cartageneras</a>. Seville celebrates "<a href="Holy%20Week%20in%20Seville">Semana Santa</a>", one of the better known religious events within Spain. During the festival, religious fraternities dress as penitents and carry large floats of lifelike wooden sculptures representing scenes of the <a href="Passion%20%28Christianity%29">Passion</a>, and images of the Virgin Mary. <a href="Sevillanas">Sevillanas</a>, a type of old folk music sung and written in Seville and still very popular, are performed in fairs and festivals, along with an associated dance for the music, the "Baile por sevillanas". All the different regions of Andalusia have developed their own distinctive customs, but all share a connectedness to Catholicism and the region's Muslim cultural past.

Andalusian Spanish is one of the most widely spoken forms of <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> in Spain, and because of emigration patterns was very influential on <a href="Spanish%20language%20in%20the%20Americas">American Spanish</a>. Rather than a single dialect, it is really a range of dialects sharing some common features; among these is the retention of more <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> words than elsewhere in Spain, as well as some <a href="phonology">phonological differences</a> compared with <a href="Standard%20Spanish">Standard Spanish</a>. The <a href="isogloss">isogloss</a>es that mark the borders of Andalusian Spanish overlap to form a network of divergent boundaries, so there is no clear border for the linguistic region.

The territory now known as Andalusia fell within the sphere of influence of ancient Mediterranean <a href="mythology">mythological</a> beliefs. Phoenician colonization brought the cults of <a href="Baal">Baal</a> and <a href="Melqart">Melqart</a>; the latter lasted into Roman times as <a href="Hercules">Hercules</a>, mythical founder of both Cádiz and Seville. The <a href="Islote%20de%20Sancti%20Petri">Islote de Sancti Petri</a> held the supposed tomb of Hercules, with representations of his <a href="Labours%20of%20Hercules">Twelve labors</a>; the region was the traditional site of the tenth labor, obtaining the cattle of the monster <a href="Geryon">Geryon</a>. Traditionally, the <a href="Pillars%20of%20Hercules">Pillars of Hercules</a> flank the <a href="Strait%20of%20Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a>. Clearly, the European pillar is the <a href="Rock%20of%20Gibraltar">Rock of Gibraltar</a>; the African pillar was presumably either <a href="Monte%20Hacho">Monte Hacho</a> in <a href="Ceuta">Ceuta</a> or <a href="Jebel%20Musa%2C%20Morocco">Jebel Musa</a> in <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>. The <a href="Roman%20road">Roman road</a> that led from Cádiz to Rome was known by several names, one of them being "<a href="Via%20Herculea">Via Herculea</a>", Hercules route returning from his tenth labor. The present <a href="coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Andalusia">coat of arms of Andalusia</a> shows Hercules between two lions, with two pillars behind these figures.

<a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a> is, by far, the largest religion in Andalusia. In 2012, the proportion of <a href="Andalusians">Andalusians</a> that identify themselves as Roman Catholic was 78.8%. The principal characteristic of the local popular form of Catholicism is devotion to the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>; Andalusia is sometimes known as "la tierra de María Santísima" ("the land of Most Holy Mary"). Also characteristic are the processions during <a href="Holy%20Week">Holy Week</a>, in which thousands of <a href="penance">penitents</a> (known as "nazarenos") sing <a href="saeta%20%28flamenco%29">saetas</a>. Andalusia is the site of such <a href="pilgrim">pilgrim</a> destinations as the <a href="Santuario%20de%20Nuestra%20Se%C3%B1ora%20de%20la%20Cabeza">Santuario de Nuestra Señora de la Cabeza</a> in <a href="And%C3%BAjar">Andújar</a> and the <a href="Hermitage%20of%20El%20Roc%C3%ADo">Hermitage of El Rocío</a> in <a href="Almonte%2C%20Spain">Almonte</a>.

While some trace the lineage of the <a href="Spanish%20Fighting%20Bull">Spanish Fighting Bull</a> back to Roman times, today's fighting bulls in the Iberian peninsula and in the former <a href="Spanish%20Empire">Spanish Empire</a> trace back to Andalusia in the 15th and 16th centuries. Andalusia remains a center of bull-rearing and <a href="Spanish-style%20bullfighting">bullfighting</a>: its 227 "fincas de ganado" where fighting bulls are raised cover . In the year 2000, Andalusia's roughly 100 <a href="bullring">bullring</a>s hosted 1,139 "<a href="Spanish-style%20bullfighting">corridas</a>".

The oldest bullring still in use in Spain is the <a href="Neoclassicism">neoclassical</a> "<a href="Plaza%20de%20Toros%20de%20Ronda">Plaza de toros</a>" in <a href="Ronda">Ronda</a>, built in 1784. The Andalusian Autonomous Government sponsors the "Rutas de Andalucía taurina", a touristic route through the region centered on bullfighting.

The Andalusian festivals provide a showcase for popular arts and traditional costume. Among the most famous of these are the <a href="Seville%20Fair">Seville Fair</a> or "Feria de Abril" in Seville, now echoed by smaller fairs in Madrid and Barcelona, both of which have many Andalusian immigrants; the "<a href="Feria%20de%20Agosto">Feria de Agosto</a>" in Málaga; the <a href="Feria%20de%20Jerez">Feria de Jerez</a> or "Feria del Caballo" in Jerez; the Festival of <a href="Corpus%20Christi%20%28feast%29">Corpus Christi</a> in Granada; the <a href="Feria%20de%20Nuestra%20Se%C3%B1ora%20de%20la%20Salud">Feria de Nuestra Señora de la Salud</a> in Córdoba; the <a href="Columbian%20Festivals">Columbian Festivals</a> ("Fiestas Colombinas") in Huelva; the <a href="Feria%20de%20la%20Virgen%20del%20Mar">Feria de la Virgen del Mar</a> in <a href="Almer%C3%ADa">Almería</a>; and the <a href="Feria%20de%20San%20Lucas%20%28Ja%C3%A9n%29">Feria de San Lucas</a> in Jaén, among many others.

Festivals of a religious nature are a deep Andalusian tradition and are met with great popular fervor. There are numerous major festivals during <a href="Holy%20Week">Holy Week</a>. An annual pilgrimage brings a million visitors to the Hermitage of El Rocío in Almonte (population 16,914 in 2008); similarly large crowds visit the Santuario de Nuestra Señora de la Cabeza in Andújar every April.

Other important festivals are the <a href="Carnival%20of%20C%C3%A1diz">Carnival of Cádiz</a> and the <a href="Fiesta%20de%20las%20Cruces">Fiesta de las Cruces</a> or <a href="Cruz%20de%20mayo">Cruz de mayo</a> in Granada and Córdoba; in Córdoba this is combined with a competition for among the "patios" (courtyards) of the city.

Andalusia hosts an annual festival for the dance of flamenco in the summer-time.

The Andalusian diet varies, especially between the coast and the interior, but in general is a <a href="Mediterranean%20diet">Mediterranean diet</a> based on <a href="olive%20oil">olive oil</a>, <a href="cereal">cereal</a>s, <a href="legume">legume</a>s, <a href="vegetable">vegetable</a>s, <a href="fish">fish</a>, <a href="dried%20fruit">dried fruit</a>s and <a href="Nut%20%28fruit%29">nuts</a>, and <a href="meat">meat</a>; there is also a great tradition of drinking <a href="wine">wine</a>.

<a href="Fried%20fish">Fried fish</a>—"pescaíto frito"—and <a href="seafood">seafood</a> are common on the coast and also eaten well into the interior under coastal influence. <a href="Atlantic%20bluefin%20tuna">Atlantic bluefin tuna</a> ("Thunnus thynnus") from the <a href="Almadraba">Almadraba</a> areas of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20C%C3%A1diz">Gulf of Cádiz</a>, <a href="prawn">prawn</a>s from <a href="Sanl%C3%BAcar%20de%20Barrameda">Sanlúcar de Barrameda</a> (known as "langostino de Sanlúcar"), and deepwater rose shrimp ("") from Huelva are all highly prized. Fishing for the transparent goby or "chanquete" ("<a href="Aphia%20minuta">Aphia minuta</a>"), a once-popular small fish from Málaga, is now banned because the techniques used to catch them trap too many immature fish of <a href="Bycatch">other species</a>.

The mountainous regions of the Sierra Morena and Sierra Nevada produce cured <a href="ham">ham</a>s, notably including "<a href="jam%C3%B3n%20serrano">jamón serrano</a>" and "<a href="jam%C3%B3n%20ib%C3%A9rico">jamón ibérico</a>". These come from two different types of pig, ("jamón serrano" from white pigs, the more expensive "jamón ibérico" from the <a href="Black%20Iberian%20pig">Black Iberian pig</a>). There are several <a href="Denominaci%C3%B3n%20de%20Origen">Denominaciones de Origen</a>, each with its own specifications including in just which <a href="microclimate">microclimate</a> region ham of a particular denomination must be cured. "<a href="Plato%20alpujarre%C3%B1o">Plato alpujarreño</a>" is another mountain specialty, a dish combining ham, sausage, sometimes other pork, egg, potatoes, and olive oil.

<a href="Confectionery">Confectionery</a> is popular in Andalusia. <a href="Almond">Almond</a>s and <a href="honey">honey</a> are common ingredients. Many enclosed <a href="convent">convent</a>s of <a href="nun">nun</a>s make and sell pastries, especially Christmas pastries: "<a href="mantecado">mantecado</a>s", "<a href="polvor%C3%B3n">polvorones</a>", "<a href="pesti%C3%B1o">pestiño</a>s", "<a href="alfajor">alfajor</a>es", "<a href="yemas%20de%20San%20Leandro">yemas de San Leandro</a>", as well as "<a href="churro">churro</a>s" or "tejeringos", <a href="meringue">meringue</a> cookies ("merengadas"), and "<a href="amarguillo">amarguillo</a>s".

Cereal-based dishes include "<a href="migas">migas</a> de harina" in eastern Andalusia (a similar dish to <a href="couscous">couscous</a> rather than the fried breadcrumb based "migas" elsewhere in Spain) and a sweeter, more aromatic porridge called "<a href="pole%C3%A1">poleá</a>" in western Andalusia.
Vegetables form the basis of such dishes as "<a href="alboron%C3%ADa">alboronía</a>" (similar to "ratatouille") and the chopped salad known as "<a href="pipirrana">pipirrana</a>" or "piriñaca". Hot and cold soups based in olive oil, garlic, bread, tomato and peppers include "<a href="gazpacho">gazpacho</a>", "<a href="salmorejo">salmorejo</a>", "<a href="porra%20antequerana">porra antequerana</a>", "<a href="ajo%20caliente">ajo caliente</a>", "<a href="sopa%20campera">sopa campera</a>", or—using almonds instead of tomato—"<a href="ajoblanco">ajoblanco</a>".

Wine has a privileged place at the Andalusian table. Andalusian wines are known worldwide, especially <a href="fortified%20wine">fortified wine</a>s such as <a href="sherry">sherry</a> ("jerez"), aged in <a href="solera">solera</a>s. These are enormously varied; for example, dry sherry may be the very distinct "<a href="fino">fino</a>", "<a href="manzanilla%20%28wine%29">manzanilla</a>", "<a href="amontillado">amontillado</a>", "<a href="oloroso">oloroso</a>", or "<a href="Palo%20Cortado">Palo Cortado</a>" and each of these varieties can each be sweetened with <a href="Pedro%20Xim%C3%A9nez">Pedro Ximénez</a> or <a href="Muscat%20of%20Alexandria">Moscatel</a> to produce a different variety of sweet sherry. Besides sherry, Andalucía has five other <a href="Denominaci%C3%B3n%20de%20Origen">Denominaciones de Origen</a> for wine: <a href="D.O.%20Condado%20de%20Huelva">D.O. Condado de Huelva</a>, <a href="D.O.%20Manzanilla-Sanl%C3%BAcar%20de%20Barrameda">D.O. Manzanilla-Sanlúcar de Barrameda</a>, <a href="M%C3%A1laga%20and%20Sierras%20de%20M%C3%A1laga">D.O. Málaga</a>, <a href="D.O.%20Montilla-Moriles">D.O. Montilla-Moriles</a>, and <a href="M%C3%A1laga%20and%20Sierras%20de%20M%C3%A1laga">D.O. Sierras de Málaga</a>. Most Andalusian wine comes from one of these regions, but there are other historic wines without a <a href="Protected%20Geographical%20Status">Protected Geographical Status</a>, for example <a href="Tintilla%20de%20Rota">Tintilla de Rota</a>, <a href="Pajarete">Pajarete</a>, <a href="Moscatel%20de%20Chipiona">Moscatel de Chipiona</a> and <a href="Mosto%20de%20Umbrete">Mosto de Umbrete</a>.

Andalusia also produces D.O. <a href="vinegar">vinegar</a> and <a href="brandy">brandy</a>: <a href="D.O.%20Vinagre%20de%20Jerez">D.O. Vinagre de Jerez</a> and <a href="D.O.%20Brandy%20de%20Jerez">D.O. Brandy de Jerez</a>.

The traditional dress of 18th-century Andalusia was strongly influenced by "<a href="majo">majismo</a>" within the context of "<a href="castizo">casticismo</a>" (purism, traditionalism, authenticity). The archetype of the "majo" and "maja" was that of a bold, pure Spaniard from a lower-class background, somewhat flamboyant in his or her style of dress. This emulation of lower-class dress also extended to imitating the clothes of brigands and <a href="Romani%20people%20in%20Spain">Romani</a> ("Gypsy") women.
The <a href="Museum%20of%20Arts%20and%20Traditions%20of%20Sevilla">Museum of Arts and Traditions of Sevilla</a> has collected representative samples of a great deal of the history of Andalusian dress, including examples of such notable types of hat as the "<a href="sombrero%20cordob%C3%A9s">sombrero cordobés</a>, "<a href="sombrero%20cala%C3%B1%C3%A9s">sombrero calañés</a>, "<a href="sombrero%20de%20catite">sombrero de catite</a>" and the "<a href="pavero">pavero</a>", as well as the "<a href="traje%20corto">traje corto</a>" and "<a href="traje%20de%20flamenca">traje de flamenca</a>".

Andalusia has a great artisan tradition in <a href="tile">tile</a>, <a href="leather">leather</a> ("see <a href="Shell%20cordovan">Shell cordovan</a>"), <a href="weaving">weaving</a> (especially of the heavy "<a href="jarapa">jarapa</a>" cloth), <a href="marquetry">marquetry</a>, and <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a>s (especially in Jaén, Granada, and Almería), <a href="lace">lace</a> (especially Granada and Huelva), <a href="embroidery">embroidery</a> (in <a href="And%C3%A9valo">Andévalo</a>), <a href="ironwork">ironwork</a>, <a href="woodworking">woodworking</a>, and <a href="basketry">basketry</a> in <a href="wicker">wicker</a>, many of these traditions a heritage of the long period of Muslim rule.

Andalusia is also known for its dogs, particularly the <a href="Andalusian%20Hound">Andalusian Hound</a>, which was originally bred in the region. Dogs, not just andalusian hounds, are very popular in the region.

Andalusian equestrianism, institutionalized in the <a href="Royal%20Andalusian%20School%20of%20Equestrian%20Art">Royal Andalusian School of Equestrian Art</a> is known well beyond the borders of Spain. The <a href="Andalusian%20horse">Andalusian horse</a> is strongly built, compact yet elegant, distinguished in the area of <a href="dressage">dressage</a> and <a href="show%20jumping">show jumping</a>, and is also an excellent horse for <a href="driving%20%28horse%29">driving</a>. They are known for their elegant "dancing" <a href="gait">gait</a>.

In Andalusia, as throughout Spain, <a href="Association%20football">football</a> is the predominant sport. Introduced to Spain by <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> men who worked in mining for <a href="Rio%20Tinto%20Group">Rio Tinto</a> in the province of Huelva, the sport soon became popular with the local population. As Spain's oldest existing football club, <a href="Recreativo%20de%20Huelva">Recreativo de Huelva</a>, founded 1889, is known as "El Decano" ("the Dean").

For the 2015/16 season, four Andalusian clubs will compete in Spain's First Division "<a href="La%20Liga">La Liga</a>": <a href="Granada%20CF">Granada CF</a>, <a href="M%C3%A1laga%20CF">Málaga CF</a>, <a href="Real%20Betis">Real Betis</a> and <a href="Sevilla%20FC">Sevilla FC</a>. Betis won La Liga in <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20La%20Liga">1934–35</a> and Sevilla in the 1945–46 season. The four other Andalusian teams, <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%20CF">Córdoba CF</a> and <a href="UD%20Almer%C3%ADa">UD Almería</a>, play in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Segunda División</a>, whilst <a href="Recreativo%20de%20Huelva">Recreativo de Huelva</a>, Spain's oldest club, and <a href="Real%20Ja%C3%A9n">Real Jaén</a> participate in the <a href="Segunda%20Divisi%C3%B3n%20B">Segunda División B</a>.

The <a href="Andalusia%20autonomous%20football%20team">Andalusia autonomous football team</a> is not in any league, and plays only <a href="exhibition%20game">friendly matches</a>. In recent years, they have played mostly during the Christmas break of the football leagues. They play mostly against national teams from other countries, but would not be eligible for international league play, where Spain is represented by a single national team.

In recent decades, <a href="basketball">basketball</a> has become increasingly popular, with <a href="CB%20M%C3%A1laga">CB Málaga</a>, also known as Unicaja Málaga who have won the <a href="Liga%20ACB">Liga ACB</a> in 2007 and the <a href="Kora%C4%87%20Cup">Korać Cup</a> in 2001 and usually play the <a href="Euroleague">Euroleague</a>, <a href="CB%20Sevilla">CB Sevilla</a> (Banca Cívica) and <a href="CB%20Granada">CB Granada</a> competing at the top level in the <a href="Liga%20ACB">Liga ACB</a>.

Unlike basketball, <a href="Team%20handball">handball</a> has never really taken off in Andalusia. There is one Andalusian team in the <a href="Liga%20ASOBAL">Liga Asobal</a>, Spain's premier handball league: <a href="BM%20Puente%20Genil">BM Puente Genil</a>, playing in the provincia of <a href="Province%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba%20%28Spain%29">Córdoba</a>.

Andalusia's strongest showing in sports has been in <a href="table%20tennis">table tennis</a>. There are two professional teams: <a href="Cajasur%20Priego%20TM">Cajasur Priego TM</a> and <a href="Caja%20Granada%20TM">Caja Granada TM</a>, the latter being Spain's leading table tennis team, with more than 20 league championships in nearly consecutive years and 14 consecutive Copas del Rey, dominating the <a href="Liga%20ENEB%C3%89">Liga ENEBÉ</a>. Cajasur is also one of the league's leading teams. 

220 Andalusian athletes have competed in a total of 16 summer or winter <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a>. The first was <a href="Leopoldo%20S%C3%A1inz%20de%20la%20Maza">Leopoldo Sáinz de la Maza</a>, part of the silver-medal-winning <a href="polo">polo</a> team at the <a href="1920%20Summer%20Olympics">1920 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>.

Abhorrers

Abhorrers, the name given in 1679 to the persons who expressed their abhorrence at the action of those who had signed petitions urging King <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II of England</a> to assemble <a href="English%20Parliament">Parliament</a>.

Feeling against <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a>s, and especially against <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James, Duke of York</a>, was running strongly; the <a href="Exclusion%20Bill">Exclusion Bill</a> had been passed by the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a>, and the popularity of <a href="James%20Scott%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Monmouth">James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth</a>, was very great.

To prevent this bill from passing into law, Charles had dissolved parliament in July 1679, and in the following October had <a href="legislative%20session%23Procedure%20in%20Commonwealth%20realms">prorogue</a>d its successor, which became known as the <a href="Exclusion%20Bill%20Parliament">Exclusion Bill Parliament</a>, without allowing it to meet. He was then deluged with petitions urging him to call it together, and this agitation was opposed by Sir <a href="George%20Jeffreys%2C%201st%20Baron%20Jeffreys">George Jeffreys</a> and <a href="Francis%20Wythens">Francis Wythens</a>, who presented addresses expressing "abhorrence" of the "Petitioners," and thus initiated the movement of the abhorrers, who supported the action of the king. "The frolic went all over <a href="England">England</a>," says <a href="Roger%20North%20%2817th%20century%29">Roger North</a>; and the addresses of the Abhorrers which reached the king from all parts of the country formed a counterblast to those of the <a href="Petitioner">Petitioner</a>s. It is said that the terms <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whig</a> and <a href="British%20Tory%20Party">Tory</a> were first applied to English political parties in consequence of this dispute.

<doc id="2740" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2740" title="Abiathar">
Abiathar

Abiathar (אֶבְיָתָר, "Evyatar", "the [divine] father is pre-eminent" or "father of plenty"), in the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, son of <a href="Ahimelech">Ahimelech</a> or Ahijah, <a href="Kohen%20Gadol">High Priest</a> at <a href="Nob%2C%20Israel">Nob</a>, the fourth in descent from <a href="Eli%20%28Bible%29">Eli</a> (1 Sam. 23:6) and the last of Eli's House. The only one of the priests to escape from Saul's massacre, he fled to David at <a href="Keilah">Keilah</a>, taking with him the <a href="ephod">ephod</a> and other priestly regalia (1 Sam. 22:20 f., 23:6, 9). He was of great service to David, especially at the time of the rebellion of <a href="Absalom">Absalom</a> (2 Sam. 15:24, 29, 35, 20:25). In 1 Kings 4:4 <a href="Zadok%20%28High%20Priest%29">Zadok</a> and Abiathar are found acting together as priests under Solomon. In 1 Kings 1:7, 19, 25, however, Abiathar appears as a supporter of Adonijah, and in 2:22 and 26 it is said that he was deposed by Solomon and banished to Anathoth. In 2 Sam. 8:17 "Abiathar, the son of Achimelech" should be read, with the Syriac, for "Achimelech, the son of Abiathar."

A similar confusion occurs in <a href="Gospel%20of%20Mark">Gospel of Mark</a> 2:26: in reporting Jesus' words, <a href="Mark%20the%20Evangelist">the evangelist</a> used the name Abiathar when we might expect to see Jesus mention his father <a href="Ahimelech">Ahimelech</a>. Suggestions made to resolve the difficulty — e.g. that father and son each bore the same double name, or that Abiathar officiated during his father's lifetime and in his father's stead—have been supported by great names, but have not been fully accepted.

When his father and the priests of Nob were slain on the command of Saul, Abiathar escaped, bearing with him the <a href="ephod">ephod</a>. Rabbinical literature that linked the later extermination of the male descendants of David with the priests of Nob, also link the survival of David's descendant <a href="Jehoash%20of%20Judah">Joash</a> with that of Abiathar. (Sanh. 95b)

Abiathar joined David, who was then in the cave of <a href="Adullam">Adullam</a> (1 Sam. 22:20-23; 23:6). He remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the leader (1 Sam. 30:7). When David ascended the throne of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a>, Abiathar was appointed High Priest (1 Chr. 15:11; 1 Kings 2:26) and the "king's counselor" (1 Chr. 27:33-34). Meanwhile, Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made High Priest. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia Abiathar was deposed from office when he was deserted by the Holy Spirit without which the <a href="Urim">Urim</a> and Thummin could not be consulted. Another version says he was Co-Pontiff with Zadok during King David. He supported Prince Adonijah over Prince <a href="Solomon">Solomon</a>, and was deposed by him and exiled in <a href="Anathoth">Anathoth</a>.

These appointments continued in force till the end of David's reign (1 Kings 4:4). Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by <a href="Solomon">Solomon</a>, because he took part in the attempt to raise <a href="Adonijah">Adonijah</a> to the throne. The priesthood thus passed from the house of Ithamar (1 Sam. 2:30-36; 1 Kings 1:19; 2:26, 27). Zadok now became sole high priest. Abiathar's removal from the Priesthood fulfilled that other part of the curse on the House of Eli—that the Priesthood would pass out of the House of Eli.

In Georgian traditions, <a href="Abiathar%20and%20Sidonia">Abiathar and Sidonia</a> were a legendary <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> priest of <a href="Mtskheta">Mtskheta</a> and his daughter. Abiathar is said to have been the first person <a href="Saint%20Nino">Saint Nino</a> converted to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>.

"Abiathar" ( in Modern Hebrew) is sometimes used as a male given name in contemporary <a href="Israel">Israel</a> (see <a href="Eviatar%20Banai">Eviatar Banai</a>, <a href="Eviatar%20Zerubavel">Eviatar Zerubavel</a>, <a href="Eviatar%20Manor">Eviatar Manor</a>).

Abigail

Abigail ()) spelled "Abigal" in in the <a href="American%20Standard%20Version">American Standard Version</a> and "Ab'igal" in the <a href="Revised%20Standard%20Version">Revised Standard Version</a>, but "Abigail" in the <a href="King%20James%20Version">King James Version</a>}} was the wife of <a href="Nabal">Nabal</a>; she became a wife of the future <a href="David">King David</a> after Nabal's death (<a href="Books%20of%20Samuel">1 Samuel</a> ). Abigail was David's third wife, after Saul's daughter, <a href="Michal">Michal</a>, whom Saul later married to <a href="Palti%2C%20son%20of%20Laish">Palti, son of Laish</a> when David went into hiding, and <a href="Ahinoam">Ahinoam</a>.

She became the mother of one of David's sons, who is listed in the <a href="Book%20of%20Chronicles">Book of Chronicles</a> under the name "<a href="Daniel%20%28son%20of%20David%29">Daniel</a>", in the <a href="Masoretic%20Text">Masoretic Text</a> of the Books of Samuel as "Chileab," and in the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> text of 2 Samuel 3:3 as Δαλουια, "Dalouia".

Derived from the word "ab," "father", and the root "g-y-l", "to rejoice," the name Abigail has a variety of possible meanings including "my father's joy" and the like.

In 1 Samuel 25, <a href="Nabal">Nabal</a> demonstrates ingratitude towards David, and Abigail attempts to placate David in order to stop the future King from taking revenge. She gives him food, and speaks to him, urging him not to "have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed" (verse 31, <a href="NIV">NIV</a>) and reminding him that <a href="God">God</a> will make him a "<a href="Davidic%20line">lasting dynasty</a>" (verse 28). <a href="Jon%20Levenson">Jon Levenson</a> calls this an "undeniable <a href="wikt%3Aadumbration">adumbration</a>" of <a href="Nathan%20%28prophet%29">Nathan</a>'s prophecy in <a href="Covenant%20%28biblical%29%23Davidic%20covenant">2 Samuel 7</a>. <a href="Alice%20Bach">Alice Bach</a> notes that Abigail pronounces a "crucial prophecy," and the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> regards her as one of the <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>'s seven female prophets. Levenson, however, suggests that she "senses the drift of history" from intelligence rather than from special revelation.

After Abigail reveals to Nabal what she has done, "<a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a> struck Nabal and he died," (v.38), after which David married her. Abigail is described as intelligent and beautiful. The <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> amplifies this idea, mentioning her as being one of the "four women of surpassing beauty in the world," (the other three being <a href="Rahab">Rahab</a>, <a href="Sarah">Sarah</a>, and <a href="Esther">Esther</a>). As the wife of the wealthy Nabal, she is also a woman of high socioeconomic status. Whether David married her because he was attracted to her, or as an astute political move, or both is unclear.

Abigail and David's second wife, Ahinoam the Jezreelite, accompany David and his war band when they seek refuge in Philistine territory. While David and his men were encamped near Jezreel, and when they are captured by Amalekites raided the town of Ziglak and carried off the women and children. David led the pursuit and they were subsequently rescued. Both wives then settle with David in Hebron, where Abigail gives birth to David’s second son, Chileab (also called Daniel).

Abigail is also listed as one of the seven Jewish women prophets, the other six being <a href="Miriam">Miriam</a>, <a href="Deborah">Deborah</a>, <a href="Hannah%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Hannah</a>, <a href="Sarah">Sarah</a>, <a href="Huldah">Huldah</a>,and <a href="Esther">Esther</a>. In terms of her moral character, <a href="Abraham%20Kuyper">Abraham Kuyper</a> argues that Abigail's conduct indicates "a most appealing character and unwavering faith," but Alice Bach regards her as subversive.

Adele Berlin contrasts the story of Abigail with that of Bathsheba. In one, the wife prevents David from murdering her foolish and greedy husband. In the second, David orders the murder of a good man because he desires his wife. "In the Abigail story, David, the potential king, is seen as increasingly strong and virtuous, whereas in the Bathsheba story, the reigning monarch shows his flaws ever more overtly and begins to lose control of his family."

<a href="Jon%20D.%20Levenson">Levenson</a> and <a href="Halpern">Halpern</a> suggest that Abigail may, in fact, also be the same person as <a href="Abigail%20%28mother%20of%20Amasa%29">Abigail, mother of Amasa</a>. <a href="Richard%20M.%20Davidson">Richard M. Davidson</a>, however, points out that "on the basis of the final form of Old Testament canon, references to Abigail in the biblical accounts indicate two different individuals."

Abigail's self-styling as a "<a href="handmaid">handmaid</a>" led to "Abigail" being the traditional term for a waiting-woman, for example as the "waiting <a href="gentlewoman">gentlewoman</a>" in <a href="Beaumont%20and%20Fletcher">Beaumont and Fletcher</a>'s "<a href="The%20Scornful%20Lady">The Scornful Lady</a>", published in 1616. <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a> and <a href="Henry%20Fielding">Henry Fielding</a> use "Abigail" in this generic sense, as does <a href="Charlotte%20Bront%C3%AB">Charlotte Brontë</a>. <a href="Anthony%20Trollope">Anthony Trollope</a> makes two references to "the abigail" (all lower case) in "<a href="The%20Eustace%20Diamonds">The Eustace Diamonds</a>", at the beginning of Chapter 42, whilst <a href="Thomas%20Mann">Thomas Mann</a> makes the same reference at the start of the second chapter of Part 2 in <a href="Buddenbrooks">Buddenbrooks</a> (published in 1901). <a href="William%20Rose%20Benet">William Rose Benet</a> notes the notoriety of <a href="Abigail%20Hill">Abigail Hill</a>, better known as "Mrs Masham", a <a href="lady-in-waiting">lady-in-waiting</a> to <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a>. <a href="George%20MacDonald%20Fraser">George MacDonald Fraser</a> makes mention of "an "abigail" fussing about the room" in his novel "<a href="Flashman%20%28novel%29">Flashman</a>" from "<a href="The%20Flashman%20Papers">The Flashman Papers</a>" series.

Abigail is a featured figure on <a href="Judy%20Chicago">Judy Chicago</a>'s installation piece "<a href="The%20Dinner%20Party">The Dinner Party</a>", being represented in one of the 999 tiles of the "<a href="List%20of%20women%20in%20the%20Heritage%20Floor">Heritage Floor</a>."

Azad Kashmir

Azad Jammu and Kashmir ( "Āzād Jammū̃ o Kaśmīr", translation: Free Jammu and Kashmir), abbreviated as AJK and commonly known as Azad Kashmir, is a nominally <a href="Self-governance">self-governing</a> polity administered by <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>. The territory lies west of the Indian-administered state of <a href="Jammu%20and%20Kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir</a>, and was previously part of the former <a href="princely%20state">princely state</a> of <a href="Jammu%20and%20Kashmir%20%28princely%20state%29">Jammu and Kashmir</a>, which ceased to exist as a result of the <a href="Indo-Pakistani%20War%20of%201947">first Kashmir war</a> fought between <a href="India">India</a> and Pakistan in 1947.

Azad Kashmir is part of the greater <a href="Kashmir">Kashmir</a> region, which is the subject of <a href="Kashmir%20conflict">a long-running conflict</a> between Pakistan and India. The territory shares a border with <a href="Gilgit-Baltistan">Gilgit-Baltistan</a>, together with which it is referred to by the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> and other international organisations as "Pakistan-administered Kashmir".
Azad Kashmir is one-sixth of the size of <a href="Gilgit-Baltistan">Gilgit-Baltistan</a>. The territory also borders Pakistan's <a href="Punjab%2C%20Pakistan">Punjab</a> province to the south and <a href="Khyber%20Pakhtunkhwa">Khyber Pakhtunkhwa</a> province to the west. To the east, Azad Kashmir is separated from the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir by the <a href="Line%20of%20Control">Line of Control</a>, the "de facto" border between India and Pakistan. Azad Kashmir has a total area of , and a total population of 4,045,366 as per the 2017 Census.

The territory has a parliamentary form of government modeled after the <a href="Westminster%20system">Westminster system</a>, with its capital located at <a href="Muzaffarabad">Muzaffarabad</a>. The <a href="President%20of%20Azad%20Jammu%20and%20Kashmir">President</a> is the constitutional head of state, while the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Azad%20Jammu%20and%20Kashmir">Prime Minister</a>, supported by a Council of Ministers, is the chief executive. The unicameral <a href="Azad%20Kashmir%20Legislative%20Assembly">Azad Kashmir Legislative Assembly</a> elects both the Prime Minister and President. The state has its own Supreme Court and a High Court, while the <a href="Government%20of%20Pakistan">Government of Pakistan</a>'s <a href="Ministry%20of%20Kashmir%20Affairs%20and%20Gilgit-Baltistan">Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan</a> serves as a link with Azad Kashmir's government, although Azad Kashmir is not represented in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Pakistan">Parliament of Pakistan</a>.

<a href="2005%20Kashmir%20earthquake">The 2005 earthquake</a> killed 100,000 people and left another three million people displaced, with widespread devastation. Since then, with help from the Government of Pakistan and foreign donors, reconstruction of infrastructure is underway. Azad Kashmir's economy largely depends on agriculture, services, tourism, and remittances sent by members of the <a href="British%20Mirpuri">British Mirpuri</a> community. Nearly 87% of the households own farms in Azad Kashmir, while the region has a literacy rate of approximately 72% and has the highest school enrollment in Pakistan.

At the time of the <a href="Partition%20of%20India">Partition of India</a> in 1947, the British abandoned their <a href="suzerainty">suzerainty</a> over the <a href="princely%20states">princely states</a>, which were left with the options of joining India or Pakistan or remaining independent. <a href="Hari%20Singh">Hari Singh</a>, the <a href="maharaja">maharaja</a> of Jammu and Kashmir, wanted his state to remain independent. Muslims in Western Jammu province (current day Azad Kashmir) and the Frontier Districts Province (current day <a href="Gilgit-Baltistan">Gilgit-Baltistan</a>) had wanted to join <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>.

In Spring 1947, an uprising against the Maharaja broke out in <a href="Poonch%20district%2C%20Pakistan">Poonch</a>, an area bordering the <a href="Rawalpindi%20division">Rawalpindi division</a> of <a href="West%20Punjab">West Punjab</a>. Maharaja's administration is said to have started levying punitive taxes on the peasantry which provoked a local revolt and the administration resorted to brutal suppression. The area's population, swelled by recently demobilised soldiers following <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, rebelled against the Maharaja's forces and gained control of almost the entire district. Following this victory, the pro-Pakistan chieftains of the western districts of <a href="Muzaffarabad%20district">Muzaffarabad</a>, <a href="History%20of%20Poonch%20District">Poonch</a> and <a href="Mirpur%20district">Mirpur</a> proclaimed a provisional Azad Jammu and Kashmir government in Rawalpindi on October 3, 1947. <a href="Khwaja%20Ghulam%20Nabi%20Gilkar">Khwaja Ghulam Nabi Gilkar</a>, under the assumed name "Mr. Anwar," issued a proclamation in the name of the provisional government in <a href="Muzaffarabad">Muzaffarabad</a>. However, this government quickly fizzled out with the arrest of Anwar in Srinagar. On October 24, a second provisional government of Azad Kashmir was established at <a href="Palandri">Palandri</a> under the leadership of <a href="Sardar%20Ibrahim">Sardar Ibrahim</a>.

On October 21, several thousand <a href="Pashtuns">Pashtun</a> tribesmen from <a href="North-West%20Frontier%20Province%20%281901%E2%80%931955%29">North-West Frontier Province</a> poured into Jammu and Kashmir to liberate it from the Maharaja's rule. They were led by experienced military leaders and were equipped with modern arms. The Maharaja's crumbling forces were unable to withstand the onslaught. The raiders captured the towns of Muzaffarabad and <a href="Baramulla">Baramulla</a>, the latter northwest of the state capital <a href="Srinagar">Srinagar</a>. On October 24, the Maharaja requested military assistance from India, which responded that it was unable to help him unless he acceded to India. Accordingly, on October 26, 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh signed an <a href="Instrument%20of%20Accession%20%28Jammu%20and%20Kashmir%29">Instrument of Accession</a>, handing over control of defence, external affairs and communications to the Government of India in return for military aid. Indian troops were immediately airlifted into Srinagar. Pakistan intervened subsequently. Fighting ensued between the Indian and Pakistani armies, with the two areas of control more or less stabilised around what is now known as the "<a href="Line%20of%20Control">Line of Control</a>".

India later approached the United Nations, asking it to resolve the dispute, and resolutions were passed in favour of the holding of a plebiscite with regard to Kashmir's future. However, no such plebiscite has ever been held on either side, since there was a precondition which required the withdrawal of the Pakistani Army along with the non-state elements and the subsequent partial withdrawal of the Indian Army. from the parts of Kashmir under their respective control – a withdrawal that never took place. In 1949, a formal cease-fire line separating the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled parts of Kashmir came into effect.

Following the <a href="Karachi%20Agreement">1949 cease-fire agreement</a> with India, the government of Pakistan divided the northern and western parts of Kashmir that it occupied at the time of cease-fire into the following two separately-controlled political entities:

At one time under Pakistani control, Kashmir's <a href="Trans-Karakoram%20Tract">Shaksgam tract</a>, a small region along the northeastern border of Gilgit–Baltistan, was provisionally ceded by Pakistan to the People's Republic of China in 1963 and now forms part of China's <a href="Xinjiang">Xinjiang</a> Uygur Autonomous Region.

In 1972, the then current border between the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of Kashmir was designated as the "<a href="Line%20of%20Control">Line of Control</a>". This line has remained unchanged since the 1972 <a href="Simla%20Agreement">Simla Agreement</a>, which bound the two countries "to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations". Some political experts claim that, in view of that pact, the only solution to the issue is mutual negotiation between the two countries without involving a third party such as the United Nations. The 1974 Interim Constitution Act was passed by the 48-member Azad Jammu and Kashmir unicameral assembly.

Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) is a self-governing state under Pakistani control, but under <a href="Constitution%20of%20Pakistan">Pakistan's constitution</a> the state is informally part of the country. Pakistan is administering the region as a self-governing territory rather than incorporating it in the federation since the UN-mandated ceasefire. Azad Kashmir has its own elected <a href="President">President</a>, <a href="Prime%20Minister">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Legislative%20Assembly">Legislative Assembly</a>, <a href="High%20Court">High Court</a>, with Azam Khan as its present chief justice, and official flag.

Azad Kashmir's financial matters, i.e., budget and tax affairs, are dealt with by the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council rather than by Pakistan's Central Board of Revenue. The Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council is a supreme body consisting of 14 members, 8 from the government of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and 6 from the government of Pakistan. Its chairman/chief executive is the prime minister of Pakistan. Other members of the council are the president and the prime minister of Azad Kashmir(or and individual nominated by her/him) and 6 members of the AJK Legislative Assembly. Azad Kashmir Day is celebrated in Azad Jammu and Kashmir on October 24, which is the day that the Azad Jammu and Kashmir government was created in 1947. Pakistan has celebrated <a href="Kashmir%20Solidarity%20Day">Kashmir Solidarity Day</a> on February 5 of each year since 1990 as a day of protest against <a href="India">India</a>'s "<a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>" sovereignty over its State of <a href="Jammu%20and%20Kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir</a>. That day is a <a href="Public%20holidays%20in%20Pakistan">national holiday</a> in Pakistan. Kashmiris in Azad Kashmir observe the Kashmir <a href="Accession%20Day%20%28Jammu%20and%20Kashmir%29">Black Day</a> on October 27 of each year since 1947 as day of protest against military occupation in Indian controlled <a href="Jammu%20and%20Kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir</a>.

<a href="Brad%20Adams">Brad Adams</a> the Asia director at the U.S. based <a href="NGO">NGO</a> <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> has said in 2006; "Although 'azad' means 'free,' the residents of Azad Kashmir are anything but, the Pakistani authorities govern Azad Kashmir government with tight controls on basic freedoms." Scholar <a href="Christopher%20Snedden">Christopher Snedden</a> has observed that despite tight controls the people of Azad Kashmir have generally accepted whatever Pakistan has done to them, which in any case has varied little from how most Pakistanis have been treated (by Pakistan). According to <a href="Christopher%20Snedden">Christopher Snedden</a> one of the reasons for this was that the people of Azad Kashmir had always wanted to be a part of Pakistan.

Consequently, having little to fear from a pro-Pakistan population devoid of options, Pakistan imposed its will through the Federal <a href="Ministry%20of%20Kashmir%20Affairs%20%28Pakistan%29">Ministry of Kashmir Affairs</a> and failed to empower the people of Azad Kashmir, allowing genuine self-government for only a short period in the 1970s. The Interim Constitution of the 1970s only allows the political parties that pay allegiance to Pakistan: "No person or political party in Azad Jammu and Kashmir shall be permitted... activities prejudicial or detrimental to the State's accession to Pakistan." The pro-independence <a href="Jammu%20and%20Kashmir%20Liberation%20Front">Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front</a> has never been allowed to contest elections in Azad Kashmir. While the Interim Constitution does not give them a choice, the people of Azad Kashmir have not considered any option other than joining Pakistan. Except in the legal sense, Azad Kashmir has been fully integrated into Pakistan.

According to the project report by the <a href="Asian%20Development%20Bank">Asian Development Bank</a>; The Asian Development Bank has set out development goals for Azad Kashmir in the areas of Health, Education, Nutrition and Social development. The whole project is estimated to cost $76 million Dollars. <a href="Germany">Germany</a> between 2006 and 2014 has also donated $38,180,000 towards the AJK Health Infrastructure Programme.

The state is administratively divided into three <a href="Division%20%28Pakistan%29">divisions</a> which, in turn, are divided into ten <a href="District%20%28Pakistan%29">districts</a>.

The northern part of Azad Jammu and Kashmir encompasses the lower part of the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>, including Jamgarh Peak (15,531 feet [4,734 meters]). However, Sarwali peak in the <a href="Neelum%20Valley">Neelum Valley</a> is the highest peak in the state. Fertile, green, mountainous valleys are characteristic of Azad Kashmir's geography, making it one of the most beautiful regions on the subcontinent.

The southern parts of Azad Kashmir including Bhimber, Mirpur and Kotli districts has extremely hot weather in summers and moderate cold weather in winters. It receives rains mostly in <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a> weather.

In the central and northern parts of state weather remains moderate hot in summers and very cold and chilly in winter. Snow fall also occurs there in December and January.

This region receives rainfall in both winters and summers. <a href="Muzaffarabad">Muzaffarabad</a> and Pattan are among the wettest areas of the state. Throughout most of the region, the average rainfall exceeds 1400 mm, with the highest average rainfall occurring near Muzaffarabad (around 1800 mm). During summer, monsoon floods of the <a href="Jhelum%20River">Jhelum</a> and Leepa rivers are common, due to high rainfall and melting snow.

Azad Jammu and Kashmir has an almost entirely Muslim population. Most residents of the region are not ethnic Kashmiris. The majority of people in Azad Kashmir are ethnically Punjabi. While <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a> is the official language of the region, other languages commonly spoken are Pahari, <a href="Gojri">Gojri</a> and <a href="Pothohari%20language">Potohari</a>. The main communities living in this region are as follows:

The culture of Azad Kashmir has many similarities to that of northern Punjabi (<a href="Pothohar%20Plateau">Potohar</a>) culture in <a href="Punjab%20%28Pakistan%29">Punjab</a> province. The natives of Azad Kashmir speak <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a>, <a href="Potwari%20language">Potwari</a> and Pahari. The <a href="Kashmiri%20language">Kashmiri language</a> is spoken by hardly 5% of Azad Kashmir's population according to Kashmiri journalist Shujaat Bukhari. Professor Khawaja Abdul Rehman states that the Kashmiri language is on the verge of dying out in the Neelam Valley.

The traditional dress of the women is the <a href="shalwar%20kameez">shalwar kameez</a> in Pahari style. The shalwar kameez is commonly worn by both men and women. Women use shawl to cover their head and upper body.

Historically the economy of these areas now called ‘Azad’ Kashmir has been agricultural which meant that land was the main source or mean of production. This means that all food for immediate and long term consumption was produced from land. The produce included various crops, fruits, vegetables etc. Land was also the source of other livelihood necessities such as wood, fuel, grazing for animals which then turned into dairy products. Because of this land was also the main source of revenue for the governments whose primary purpose for centuries was to accumulate revenue.

Agriculture is a major part of Azad Kashmir's economy. Low-lying areas that have high populations grow crops like <a href="barley">barley</a>, <a href="mango">mango</a>es, <a href="millet">millet</a>, <a href="maize">corn</a> (maize), and wheat, and also raise cattle. In the elevated areas that are less populated and more spread-out, forestry, corn, and livestock are the main sources of income. There are mineral and marble resources in Azad Kashmir close to <a href="Mirpur%2C%20Azad%20Kashmir">Mirpur</a> and <a href="Muzaffarabad">Muzaffarabad</a>. There are also graphite deposits at Mohriwali. There are also reservoirs of low-grade coal, <a href="chalk">chalk</a>, <a href="bauxite">bauxite</a>, and <a href="zircon">zircon</a>. Local household industries produce carved wooden objects, textiles, and dhurrie carpets. There is also an arts and crafts industry that produces such cultural goods as namdas, shawls, pashmina, pherans, <a href="Papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9">Papier-mâché</a>, basketry copper, rugs, wood carving, silk and woolen clothing, patto, carpets, namda gubba, and silverware. Agricultural goods produced in the region include mushrooms, honey, walnuts, apples, cherries, medicinal herbs and plants, resin, deodar, kail, chir, fir, maple, and ash timber.

The migration to UK was accelerated and by the completion of <a href="Mangla%20Dam">Mangla Dam</a> in 1967 the process of ‘<a href="chain%20migration">chain migration</a>’ became in full flow. Today, remittances from <a href="British%20Mirpuri">British Mirpuri</a> community make a critical role in AJK's economy. In the mid-1950s various economic and social development processes were launched in Azad Kashmir. In the 1960s, with the construction of the <a href="Mangla%20Dam">Mangla Dam</a> in <a href="Mirpur%20District">Mirpur District</a>, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Government began to receive royalties from the Pakistani government for the electricity that the dam provided to Pakistan. During the mid-2000s, a multibillion-dollar reconstruction began in the aftermath of the <a href="2005%20Kashmir%20earthquake">2005 Kashmir earthquake</a>.

In addition to agriculture, textiles, and arts and crafts, remittances have played a major role in the economy of Azad Kashmir. One analyst estimated that the figure for Azad Kashmir was 25.1% in 2001. With regard to annual household income, people living in the higher areas are more dependent on remittances than are those living in the lower areas. In the latter part of 2006, billions of dollars for development were mooted by <a href="international%20aid%20agencies">international aid agencies</a> for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of earthquake-hit zones in Azad Kashmir, though much of that amount was subsequently lost in bureaucratic channels, leading to considerable delays in help getting to the most needy. Hundreds of people continued to live in tents long after the earthquake. A land-use plan for the city of <a href="Muzaffarabad">Muzaffarabad</a> was prepared by the <a href="Japan%20International%20Cooperation%20Agency">Japan International Cooperation Agency</a>.

Kashmir as a whole is the one of the most beautiful regions in the world. Some well-known and popular tourist destinations are the following:


The literacy rate in Azad Kashmir was 62% in 2004, higher than in any region in Pakistan. However, only 2.2% were graduates, compared to the average of 2.9% for Pakistan.

The following is a list of universities recognised by <a href="Higher%20Education%20Commission%20of%20Pakistan">Higher Education Commission of Pakistan</a> (HEC):


The following is a list of undergraduate medical institutions recognised by <a href="Pakistan%20Medical%20and%20Dental%20Council">Pakistan Medical and Dental Council</a> (PMDC) as of 2013.


In terms of sports, football, cricket and volleyball are very popular in Azad Kashmir. Many tournaments are also held throughout the year and in the holy month of <a href="Ramadan%20%28calendar%20month%29">Ramazan</a> night time floodlit tournaments are also organised.


New Mirpur City has a cricket stadium (<a href="Quaid-e-Azam%20Stadium">Quaid-e-Azam Stadium</a>) which has been taken over by the <a href="Pakistan%20Cricket%20Board">Pakistan Cricket Board</a> for renovation to bring it up to International standards. There is also a cricket stadium in <a href="Muzaffarabad">Muzaffarabad</a> with the capacity of 8,000 people. This stadium has hosted 8 matches of Inter-District Under 19 Tournament 2013.

There are also registered football clubs namely, Pilot Football Club, Youth Football Club, Kashmir National FC and Azad Super FC.

Arabian Sea

The Arabian Sea is a region of the northern <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> bounded on the north by <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, on the west by northeastern <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a> and the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>, and on the east by <a href="India">India</a>. Historically the sea has been known by other names including the <a href="Erythraean%20Sea">Erythraean Sea</a> and the <a href="Persian%20Sea">Persian Sea</a>. Its total area is and its maximum depth is . The <a href="Gulf%20of%20Aden">Gulf of Aden</a> is in the southwest, connecting the Arabian Sea to the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a> through the strait of <a href="Bab-el-Mandeb">Bab-el-Mandeb</a>, and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Oman">Gulf of Oman</a> is in the northwest, connecting it to the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>.

The Arabian Sea has been crossed by important marine trade routes since the third or second millennium BCE. Major seaports include <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru%20Port">Jawaharlal Nehru Port</a> in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, the <a href="Port%20of%20Karachi">Port of Karachi</a> and the <a href="Gwadar%20Port">Gwadar Port</a> in <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> and the Port of Salalah in <a href="Oman">Oman</a>.

<a href="International%20Hydrographic%20Organization">International Hydrographic Organization</a> defines the limits of the Arabian Sea as follows:
"On the West." The Eastern limit of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Aden">Gulf of Aden</a> [The meridian of <a href="Cape%20Guardafui">Cape Guardafui</a> (Ras Asir, 51°16'E)].

"On the North." A line joining <a href="Ras%20al%20Hadd">Ràs al Hadd</a>, East point of <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabia</a> (22°32'N) and <a href="Jiwani">Ràs Jiyùni</a> (61°43'E) on the coast of <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>.

"On the South." A line running from the South extremity of <a href="Addu%20Atoll">Addu Atoll</a> (<a href="Maldives">Maldives</a>), to the Eastern extreme of <a href="Ras%20Hafun">Ràs Hafun</a> (Africa, 10°26'N).

"On the East." The Western limit of the <a href="Laccadive%20Sea">Laccadive Sea</a> [A line running from <a href="Sadashivgad">Sadashivgad Lt.</a> on West Coast of <a href="India">India</a> () to <a href="Cora%20Divh">Corah Divh</a> () and thence down the West side of the <a href="Lakshadweep">Laccadive</a> and <a href="Maldives">Maldive</a> Archipelagos to the most Southerly point of <a href="Addu%20Atoll">Addu Atoll</a> in the Maldives].
The Arabian Sea historically and geographically has been referred to by many different names by <a href="Arab">Arab</a> travellers and European geographers, that include Indian Sea, Persian Sea, <a href="Sindh">Sindh</a>u Sagar, <a href="Erythraean%20Sea">Erythraean Sea</a>, <a href="Sindh%20Sea">Sindh Sea</a>, and Akhzar Sea.

The Arabian Sea has been an important <a href="Marine%20%28ocean%29">marine</a> <a href="trade%20route">trade route</a> since the era of the "coastal sailing vessels" from possibly as early as the 3rd millennium BCE, certainly the late 2nd millennium BCE through the later days known as the <a href="Age%20of%20Sail">Age of Sail</a>. By the time of <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>, several well-established combined land-sea trade routes depended upon <a href="water%20transport">water transport</a> through the Sea around the rough inland <a href="terrain%20feature">terrain feature</a>s to its north.

These routes usually began in the <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a> or down river from <a href="Madhya%20Pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a> with <a href="transshipment">transshipment</a> via historic <a href="Bharuch">Bharuch</a> (Bharakuccha), traversed past the inhospitable coast of today's <a href="Iran">Iran</a> then split around <a href="Hadhramaut">Hadhramaut</a> into two streams north into the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Aden">Gulf of Aden</a> and thence into the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>, or south into <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> via <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a> ports such as <a href="Axum">Axum</a>. Each major route involved transhipping to pack animal caravan, travel through desert country and risk of bandits and extortionate tolls by local potentiates.

This southern coastal route past the rough country in the southern <a href="Arabian%20peninsula">Arabian peninsula</a> (<a href="Yemen">Yemen</a> and <a href="Oman">Oman</a> today) was significant, and the <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>ian <a href="Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a>s built several shallow canals to service the trade, one more or less along the route of today's <a href="Suez%20canal">Suez canal</a>, and another from the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a> to the <a href="Nile%20River">Nile River</a>, both shallow works that were swallowed up by huge <a href="sand%20storm">sand storm</a>s in antiquity. Later the <a href="kingdom%20of%20Axum">kingdom of Axum</a> arose in <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> to rule a mercantile empire rooted in the trade with Europe via Alexandria.

<a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru%20Port">Jawaharlal Nehru Port</a> in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> is the largest port in the Arabian Sea, and the largest container port in India.

The <a href="Port%20of%20Karachi">Port of Karachi</a> (Urdu: بندر گاہ كراچى, "") is <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>'s largest and busiest seaport, handling about 60% of the nation's cargo (25 million tons per annum). It is located between the Karachi towns of <a href="Kiamari">Kiamari</a> and <a href="Saddar">Saddar</a>, close to the main business district and several industrial areas. The geographic position of the port places it in close proximity to major shipping routes such as the <a href="Strait%20of%20Hormuz">Strait of Hormuz</a>. The history of the port is intertwined with that of the city of Karachi. Several ancient ports have been attributed in the area including "Krokola", "Morontobara" (Woman's Harbour) (mentioned by <a href="Nearchus">Nearchus</a>), <a href="Barbarikon">Barbarikon</a> (the <a href="Periplus%20of%20the%20Erythraean%20Sea">Periplus of the Erythraean Sea</a>, and <a href="Debal">Debal</a> (a city invaded and captured by the Muslim general <a href="Muhammad%20bin%20Qasim">Muhammad bin Qasim</a> in 712 AD). There is a reference to the early existence of the port of Karachi in the "<a href="Umdah">Umdah</a>", by the Arab navigator <a href="Sulaiman%20al%20Mahri">Sulaiman al Mahri</a> (AD 1511), who mentions "<a href="Ras%20al%20Karazi">Ras al Karazi</a>" and "<a href="Ras%20Karashi">Ras Karashi</a>" while describing a route along the coast from <a href="Pasni%20City">Pasni</a> to Ras Karashi.

<a href="Karachi">Karachi</a> is also mentioned in the sixteenth century <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a> treatise <a href="Mirat%20ul%20Memalik">Mirat ul Memalik</a> (Mirror of Countries, 1557) by the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> captain <a href="Seydi%20Ali%20Reis">Seydi Ali Reis</a>, which is a compilation of sailing directions from the <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> island of <a href="Diu%20Island">Diu</a> to <a href="Strait%20of%20Hormuz">Hormuz</a> in the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>. It warns sailors about whirlpools and advises them to seek safety in "<a href="Kaurashi">Kaurashi</a>" harbour if they found themselves drifting dangerously.

The gate facing the sea was called "Kharadar" (salt gate), and the gate facing the <a href="Lyari%20River">Lyari River</a> was called "<a href="Mithadar">Mithadar</a>" (sweet gate). The modern neighbourhoods around the location of the gates are called <a href="Mithadar">Mithadar</a> and Kharadar. Surrounded by mangrove swamps to the east, the sea to the southwest, and the <a href="Lyari%20River">Lyari River</a> to the north, the town was well defended and engaged in a profitable trade with Muscat and Bahrain.

The <a href="Gwadar%20Port">Gwadar Port</a> is a warm-water, deep-sea port situated at <a href="Gwadar">Gwadar</a> in <a href="Balochistan%2C%20Pakistan">Balochistan, Pakistan</a> at the apex of the Arabian Sea and at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, about 460 km west of <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a> and approximately 75 km (47 mi) east of Pakistan's border with <a href="Iran">Iran</a>. The port is located on the eastern bay of a natural hammerhead-shaped peninsula jutting out into the Arabian Sea from the coastline.

<a href="Port%20of%20Salalah">Port of Salalah</a> in <a href="Salalah">Salalah</a>, <a href="Oman">Oman</a> is also a major port in the area. From a modest start in 1997, the Omani container transhipment port has achieved consistent growth. It is a key container transhipment hub on the Arabian Sea and is often used as the first port of call for vessels whose crew have just been released from the clutches of <a href="Piracy%20in%20Somalia">Somali pirates</a> following ransom payments for withheld vessels and crew.
The port also plays host as a supply base for the visiting warships that provide protective escorts for merchant shipping in the sea lanes.
From that dual role has emerged another, one as an intelligence network — both military and civilian — to exchange information on possible pirate sightings and near misses. Also, the International Task Force often uses the port as a base. There is a significant number of warships of all nations coming in and out of the port, which makes it a very safe bubble. The port handled just under 3.5m teu in 2009

Major <a href="India">India</a>n ports in the Arabian Sea are <a href="Mundra%20Port">Mundra Port</a>, <a href="Kandla%20Port">Kandla Port</a>, <a href="Nava%20Sheva">Nava Sheva</a>, <a href="Kochi%20Port">Kochi Port</a>, <a href="Mumbai%20Port">Mumbai Port</a>, and <a href="Mormug%C3%A3o">Mormugão</a>.

There are several islands in the Arabian Sea, with the largest being <a href="Socotra">Socotra</a> (<a href="Yemen">Yemen</a>), <a href="Masirah">Masirah</a> (<a href="Oman">Oman</a>), <a href="Astola%20Island">Astola Island</a> (<a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>) and <a href="Andrott">Andrott</a> (<a href="India">India</a>).
Astola Island, also known as "Jezira Haft Talar" () or 'Island of the Seven Hills', is a small, uninhabited island in the northern tip of the Arabian Sea in <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>'s territorial waters. It is a popular <a href="eco-tourism">eco-tourism</a> destination in the region. Overnight tourists camp on the island and bring their own provisions. Camping, fishing and scuba-diving expeditions are popular. It is also a site for observing turtle breeding.

Aspartame

Aspartame (APM) is an artificial, non-<a href="saccharide">saccharide</a> <a href="sweeteners">sweetener</a> used as a <a href="sugar%20substitute">sugar substitute</a> in some foods and beverages. In the European Union, it is codified as <a href="E%20number">E951</a>. Aspartame is a <a href="Methyl%20group">methyl</a> <a href="ester">ester</a> of the <a href="aspartic%20acid">aspartic acid</a>/<a href="phenylalanine">phenylalanine</a> <a href="dipeptide">dipeptide</a>. 
A panel of experts set up by the <a href="European%20Food%20Safety%20Authority">European Food Safety Authority</a> concluded in 2013 that aspartame is safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure, As of 2017 evidence does not support a long-term benefit for <a href="weight%20loss">weight loss</a> or in <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>. Because its breakdown products include <a href="phenylalanine">phenylalanine</a>, people with the genetic condition <a href="phenylketonuria">phenylketonuria</a> (PKU) must be aware of this as an additional source.
It was first sold under the brand name <a href="NutraSweet">NutraSweet</a>. It was first made in 1965, and the patent expired in 1992. It was initially approved for use in food products by the <a href="U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) in 1981. The <a href="Aspartame%20controversy">safety of aspartame</a> has been the subject of several political and medical controversies, <a href="United%20States%20congressional%20hearing">United States congressional hearing</a>s, and Internet hoaxes.

Aspartame is approximately 200 times sweeter than <a href="sucrose">sucrose</a> (table sugar). Due to this property, even though aspartame produces four kilocalories of energy per gram (/g) when metabolized, the quantity of aspartame needed to produce a sweet taste is so small that its caloric contribution is negligible. The taste of aspartame and other artificial sweeteners differs from that of table sugar in the times of onset and how long the sweetness lasts, though aspartame comes closest to sugar's taste profile among approved artificial sweeteners. The sweetness of aspartame lasts longer than that of sucrose, so it is often blended with other artificial sweeteners such as <a href="acesulfame%20potassium">acesulfame potassium</a> to produce an overall taste more like that of sugar.

Like many other <a href="peptide">peptide</a>s, aspartame may <a href="hydrolyze">hydrolyze</a> (break down) into its constituent amino acids under conditions of elevated temperature or high <a href="pH">pH</a>. This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener, and prone to degradation in products hosting a high pH, as required for a long shelf life. The stability of aspartame under heating can be improved to some extent by encasing it in fats or in <a href="maltodextrin">maltodextrin</a>. The stability when dissolved in water depends markedly on <a href="pH">pH</a>. At room temperature, it is most stable at pH 4.3, where its <a href="half-life">half-life</a> is nearly 300 days. At pH 7, however, its <a href="half-life">half-life</a> is only a few days. Most soft-drinks have a pH between 3 and 5, where aspartame is reasonably stable. In products that may require a longer shelf life, such as <a href="syrups">syrups</a> for <a href="soda%20fountain">fountain beverages</a>, aspartame is sometimes blended with a more stable sweetener, such as <a href="saccharin">saccharin</a>.

<a href="Descriptive%20statistics">Descriptive analyses</a> of solutions containing aspartame report a sweet aftertaste as well as bitter and off-flavor aftertastes. In products such as <a href="powdered%20beverage">powdered beverage</a>s, the <a href="amine">amine</a> in aspartame can undergo a <a href="Maillard%20reaction">Maillard reaction</a> with the <a href="aldehyde">aldehyde</a> groups present in certain <a href="aroma%20compound">aroma compound</a>s. The ensuing loss of both flavor and sweetness can be prevented by protecting the aldehyde as an <a href="acetal">acetal</a>.

The safety of aspartame has been studied since its discovery. Aspartame is one of the most rigorously tested food ingredients. As of 2017 evidence does not support a benefit for <a href="weight%20loss">weight loss</a> or in <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a> with some data finding an association with weight gain and heart disease risks.

Reviews by governmental regulatory bodies have found aspartame safe for consumption at current levels. Aspartame has been deemed safe for human consumption by over 100 regulatory agencies in their respective countries, including the UK <a href="Food%20Standards%20Agency">Food Standards Agency</a>, the <a href="European%20Food%20Safety%20Authority">European Food Safety Authority</a> (EFSA) and <a href="Health%20Canada">Health Canada</a>.

Two 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found that aspartame consumption had no significant effect on variables related to obesity and diabetes. Nonnutritive sweeteners are also linked with increased weight and heart disease risk.

High levels of the naturally occurring <a href="essential%20amino%20acid">essential amino acid</a> <a href="phenylalanine">phenylalanine</a> are a health hazard to those born with <a href="phenylketonuria">phenylketonuria</a> (PKU), a rare inherited disease that prevents phenylalanine from being properly metabolized. Since individuals with PKU must consider aspartame as an additional source of phenylalanine, foods containing aspartame sold in the United States must state "Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine" on their product labels.

In the UK, foods that contain aspartame are legally required by the country's <a href="Food%20Standards%20Agency">Food Standards Agency</a> to list the substance among the product's ingredients and carry the warning "Contains a source of phenylalanine" – this is usually at the foot of the list of ingredients. Manufacturers are also required to print '"with sweetener(s)" on the label close to the main product name on foods that contain "sweeteners such as aspartame" or "with sugar and sweetener(s)" on "foods that contain both sugar and sweetener".

In Canada, foods that contain aspartame are legally required by the country to list the substance among the product's ingredients and include a measure of the amount of aspartame per serving. As well, labels must state that the product contains phenylalanine – this is usually in the order of ingredients, contained in brackets.

Phenylalanine is one of the <a href="essential%20amino%20acid">essential amino acid</a>s and is required for normal growth and maintenance of life. Concerns about the safety of phenylalanine from aspartame for those without phenylketonuria center largely on hypothetical changes in <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a> levels as well as ratios of neurotransmitters to each other in the blood and brain that could lead to neurological symptoms. Reviews of the literature have found no consistent findings to support such concerns, and while high doses of aspartame consumption may have some biochemical effects, these effects are not seen in toxicity studies to suggest aspartame can adversely affect neuronal function. Like methanol, common foods in the typical diet, such as milk, meat, and fruits, will lead to ingestion of significantly higher amounts of phenylalanine than would be expected from aspartame consumption.

In a study done in 1979, the effect of aspartame ingestion on blood and milk amino acid levels in lactating women was tested. In this study, six women from the ages of 20 to 29 with established lactation were studied after oral administration of aspartame or lactose (50 mg/kg body weight) in a random order, with the intent to study the differences in breast milk between the two. The study resulted with the conclusion that aspartame administration at 50 mg/kg body weight has a small effect upon the milk aspartate levels; and, although a small increase in aspartate time-effect scores was noted over the four-hour postabsorptive period, no significant difference was noted over the entire 24-hour watching period.

Reviews have found no association between aspartame and cancer. These reviews have looked at numerous carcinogenicity studies in animals, epidemiologic studies in humans, as well as "in vitro" <a href="genotoxicity">genotoxicity</a> studies. These studies have found no significant evidence that aspartame causes cancer in animals, damages the genome, or causes cancer in humans at doses currently used. This position is supported by multiple regulatory agencies like the FDA and EFSA as well as scientific bodies such as the <a href="National%20Cancer%20Institute">National Cancer Institute</a>. Aspartame did not show any DNA-damaging properties either.

Concern about possible <a href="carcinogen">carcinogen</a>ic properties of aspartame was originally raised and popularized in the mainstream media by <a href="John%20Olney">John Olney</a> in the 1970s and again in 1996 by suggesting that aspartame may be related to brain tumors. Reviews have found that these concerns were flawed, due to reliance on the <a href="ecological%20fallacy">ecological fallacy</a> and the purported mechanism of causing tumors being unlikely to actually cause cancer. Independent agencies such as the FDA and <a href="National%20Cancer%20Institute">National Cancer Institute</a> have reanalyzed multiple studies based on these worries and found no association between aspartame and brain cancer.

As discussed in the article on <a href="Aspartame%20controversy">controversies around aspartame</a>, the Cesare Maltoni Cancer Research Center of the European Ramazzini Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences released several studies which claimed that aspartame can increase several malignancies in rodents, concluding that aspartame is a potential carcinogen at normal dietary doses. The EFSA and the FDA discounted the study results due to lack of transparency and numerous flaws in the study, finding no reason to revise their previously established acceptable daily intake levels for aspartame.

Numerous allegations have been made via the Internet and in consumer magazines purporting neurotoxic effects of aspartame leading to neurological or psychiatric symptoms such as <a href="seizures">seizures</a>, <a href="headache">headache</a>s, and <a href="Mood%20swing">mood changes</a>. Review of the biochemistry of aspartame has found no evidence that the doses consumed would plausibly lead to neurotoxic effects.
Comprehensive reviews have not found any evidence for aspartame as a cause for these symptoms.
One review did provide a theoretical biochemical background of neurotoxicity and suggested further testing.
However, a panel of EFSA experts noted that this review's conclusions were partially based on Internet sources and therefore were not scientifically robust. These experts also concurred with a critique that significant scientific errors were made in the critical review that led to unsubstantiated and misleading interpretations. A review of studies on children did not show any significant findings for safety concerns with regard to neuropsychiatric conditions such as <a href="panic%20attack">panic attack</a>s, mood changes, <a href="hallucination">hallucination</a>s or with <a href="ADHD">ADHD</a> or seizures.

Headaches are the most common symptom reported by consumers. While one small review noted aspartame is likely one of many dietary triggers of <a href="migraine">migraine</a>s, in a list that includes "cheese, chocolate, <a href="Citrus">citrus fruits</a>, <a href="hot%20dog">hot dog</a>s, <a href="monosodium%20glutamate">monosodium glutamate</a>, aspartame, fatty foods, <a href="ice%20cream">ice cream</a>, <a href="caffeine%20withdrawal">caffeine withdrawal</a>, and alcoholic drinks, especially <a href="red%20wine">red wine</a> and beer,"
other reviews have noted conflicting studies about headaches
and still more reviews lack any evidence and references to support this claim.

Aspartame has been found to be safe for human consumption by more than ninety countries worldwide, with FDA officials describing aspartame as "one of the most thoroughly tested and studied food additives the agency has ever approved" and its safety as "clear cut", but has been the subject of several controversies, hoaxes and health scares.

Initially, aspartame was approved by the <a href="U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) in 1974; however, problems with Searle's safety testing program, including testing of aspartame, were discovered subsequently. The approval was rescinded the following year; but, after outside reviews of the problematic tests and additional testing, final approval was granted in 1981. Because allegations of <a href="Conflict%20of%20interest">conflicts of interest</a> marred the FDA's approval of aspartame, the U.S. <a href="Government%20Accountability%20Office">Government Accountability Office</a> reviewed the actions of involved officials in 1986 and the approval process in 1987; neither the allegations of conflict of interest nor problems in the final approval process were substantiated.

In addition, the <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control">Centers for Disease Control</a> investigated in 1984 and was unable to find any significant <a href="Epidemiology">epidemiological</a> associations to serious risk or harm.

Since December 1998, a widely circulated email hoax has cited aspartame as the cause of numerous diseases.

The weight of existing scientific evidence indicates that aspartame is safe at current levels of consumption as a non-nutritive sweetener. Reviews conducted by regulatory agencies decades after aspartame was first approved have supported its continued availability.

The perceived sweetness of aspartame (and other sweet substances like acesulfame K) in humans is due to its binding of the heterodimer G-protein coupled receptor formed by the proteins <a href="TAS1R2">TAS1R2</a> and <a href="TAS1R3">TAS1R3</a>.

Aspartame is rapidly <a href="Hydrolysis">hydrolyzed</a> in the <a href="small%20intestine">small intestine</a>s. Even with ingestion of very high doses of aspartame (over 200 mg/kg), no aspartame is found in the blood due to the rapid breakdown. Upon ingestion, aspartame breaks down into residual components, including <a href="aspartic%20acid">aspartic acid</a>, <a href="phenylalanine">phenylalanine</a>, <a href="methanol">methanol</a>, in ratio of 4:5:1 by mass and further breakdown products including <a href="formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a> and <a href="formic%20acid">formic acid</a>. Human studies show that formic acid is excreted faster than it is formed after ingestion of aspartame. In some <a href="fruit%20juice">fruit juice</a>s, "higher" concentrations of methanol can be found than the amount produced from aspartame in beverages.

Aspartame's major decomposition products are its <a href="Cyclic%20compound">cyclic</a> <a href="dipeptide">dipeptide</a> (in a <a href="2%2C5-Diketopiperazine">2,5-diketopiperazine</a>, or DKP, form), the de-esterified dipeptide (aspartyl-phenylalanine), and its constituent components, <a href="phenylalanine">phenylalanine</a>, <a href="aspartic%20acid">aspartic acid</a>, and <a href="methanol">methanol</a>. At 180 °C, aspartame undergoes decomposition to form a diketopiperazine derivative.

Aspartic acid (aspartate) is one of the most common <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s in the typical diet. As with methanol and phenylalanine, intake of aspartic acid from aspartame is less than would be expected from other dietary sources. At the 90th percentile of intake, aspartame provides only between 1% and 2% of the daily intake of aspartic acid. There has been some speculation that aspartame, in conjunction with other amino acids like <a href="glutamate">glutamate</a>, may lead to <a href="excitotoxicity">excitotoxicity</a>, inflicting damage on brain and nerve cells. However, clinical studies have shown no signs of neurotoxic effects, and studies of metabolism suggest it is not possible to ingest enough aspartic acid and glutamate through food and drink to levels that would be expected to be toxic.

The <a href="methanol">methanol</a> produced by the metabolism of aspartame is absorbed and quickly converted into <a href="formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a> and then completely oxidized to <a href="formic%20acid">formic acid</a>. The methanol from aspartame is unlikely to be a safety concern for several reasons. Fruit juices and citrus fruits contain methanol, and there are other dietary sources for methanol such as <a href="Fermentation%20%28food%29">fermented</a> beverages and the amount of methanol produced from aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages is likely to be less than that from these and other sources that are already in people's diets. With regard to formaldehyde, it is rapidly converted in the body, and the amounts of formaldehyde from the metabolism of aspartame are trivial when compared to the amounts produced routinely by the human body and from other foods and drugs. At the highest expected human doses of consumption of aspartame, there are no increased blood levels of methanol or formic acid, and ingesting aspartame at the 90th percentile of intake would produce 25 times less methanol than what would be considered toxic.

Aspartame is a <a href="Methyl%20group">methyl</a> <a href="ester">ester</a> of the <a href="dipeptide">dipeptide</a> of the natural <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s -<a href="aspartic%20acid">aspartic acid</a> and -<a href="phenylalanine">phenylalanine</a>. Under strongly <a href="acid">acid</a>ic or <a href="Base%20%28chemistry%29">alkaline</a> conditions, aspartame may generate <a href="methanol">methanol</a> by <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a>. Under more severe conditions, the <a href="peptide%20bond">peptide bond</a>s are also <a href="Hydrolysis">hydrolyzed</a>, resulting in free amino acids.

While known aspects of synthesis are covered by patents, many details are proprietary. Two approaches to synthesis are used commercially. In the chemical synthesis, the two carboxyl groups of aspartic acid are joined into an anhydride, and the amino group is <a href="protective%20group">protected</a> by converting it to a functional group that will not interfere in the next reaction. Phenylalanine is converted to its methyl ester and combined with the "N"-protected aspartic anhydride; then the protecting group is removed from aspartic nitrogen by acid hydrolysis. The drawback of this technique is that a byproduct, the bitter-tasting β-form, is produced when the wrong carboxyl group from aspartic acid links to phenylalanine. A process using an <a href="Thermolysin">enzyme from "Bacillus thermoproteolyticus"</a> to catalyze the condensation of the chemically altered amino acids will produce high yields without the β-form byproduct. A variant of this method, which has not been used commercially, uses unmodified aspartic acid, but produces low yields. Methods for directly producing aspartyl-phenylalanine by enzymatic means, followed by chemical methylation, have also been tried, but not scaled for industrial production.

The <a href="acceptable%20daily%20intake">acceptable daily intake</a> (ADI) value for aspartame, as well as other food additives studied, is defined as the "amount of a food additive, expressed on a body weight basis, that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without appreciable health risk." The <a href="Joint%20FAO/WHO%20Expert%20Committee%20on%20Food%20Additives">Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives</a> (JECFA) and the <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission's</a> <a href="Scientific%20Committee%20on%20Food">Scientific Committee on Food</a> has determined this value is 40 mg/kg of body weight for aspartame, while FDA has set its ADI for aspartame at 50 mg/kg.

The primary source for exposure to aspartame in the United States is diet <a href="soft%20drink">soft drink</a>s, though it can be consumed in other products, such as pharmaceutical preparations, fruit drinks, and chewing gum among others in smaller quantities. A 12 US fluid ounce (355 ml) can of diet soda contains of aspartame, and for a adult, it takes approximately 21 cans of diet soda daily to consume the of aspartame that would surpass the FDA's 50 milligrams per kilogram of body weight ADI of aspartame from diet soda alone.

Reviews have analyzed studies which have looked at the consumption of aspartame in countries worldwide, including the United States, countries in Europe, and Australia, among others. These reviews have found that even the high levels of intake of aspartame, studied across multiple countries and different methods of measuring aspartame consumption, are well below the ADI for safe consumption of aspartame. Reviews have also found that populations that are believed to be especially high consumers of aspartame such as children and diabetics are below the ADI for safe consumption, even considering extreme worst-case scenario calculations of consumption.

In a report released on 10 December 2013, the EFSA said that, after an extensive examination of evidence, it ruled out the "potential risk of aspartame causing damage to genes and inducing cancer," and deemed the amount found in diet sodas an amount safe to consume.

Aspartame was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for <a href="Searle%20%28company%29">G.D. Searle & Company</a>. Schlatter had <a href="Chemical%20synthesis">synthesized</a> aspartame as an intermediate step in generating a tetrapeptide of the hormone <a href="gastrin">gastrin</a>, for use in assessing an anti-<a href="Peptic%20ulcer">ulcer</a> drug candidate. He discovered its sweet taste when he licked his finger, which had become contaminated with aspartame, to lift up a piece of paper. <a href="Torunn%20Atteraas%20Garin">Torunn Atteraas Garin</a> participated in the development of aspartame as an <a href="artificial%20sweetener">artificial sweetener</a>.

In 1975, prompted by issues regarding <a href="Flagyl">Flagyl</a> and <a href="Aldactone">Aldactone</a>, a U.S. FDA task force team reviewed 25 studies submitted by the manufacturer, including 11 on aspartame. The team reported "serious deficiencies in Searle's operations and practices". The FDA sought to authenticate 15 of the submitted studies against the supporting data. In 1979, the <a href="Center%20for%20Food%20Safety%20and%20Applied%20Nutrition">Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition</a> (CFSAN) concluded, since many problems with the aspartame studies were minor and did not affect the conclusions, the studies could be used to assess aspartame's safety.

In 1980, the FDA convened a Public Board of Inquiry (PBOI) consisting of independent advisors charged with examining the purported relationship between aspartame and <a href="brain%20cancer">brain cancer</a>. The PBOI concluded aspartame does not cause <a href="Human%20brain">brain</a> damage, but it recommended against approving aspartame at that time, citing unanswered questions about cancer in laboratory rats.

Citing data from a Japanese study that had not been available to the members of the PBOI, and after seeking advice from an expert panel that found fault with statistical analyses underlying the PBOI's hesitation, yet argued against approval, FDA commissioner Hayes approved aspartame for use in dry goods. In 1983, the FDA further approved aspartame for use in carbonated beverages, and for use in other beverages, baked goods, and confections in 1993. In 1996, the FDA removed all restrictions from aspartame, allowing it to be used in all foods. 

Several European Union countries approved aspartame in the 1980s, with EU-wide approval in 1994. The European Commission <a href="Scientific%20Committee%20on%20Food">Scientific Committee on Food</a> reviewed subsequent safety studies and reaffirmed the approval in 2002. The <a href="European%20Food%20Safety%20Authority">European Food Safety Authority</a> reported in 2006 that the previously established <a href="Acceptable%20daily%20intake">Acceptable daily intake</a> was appropriate, after reviewing yet another set of studies.

Under the trade names <a href="Equal%20%28sweetener%29">Equal</a>, <a href="NutraSweet">NutraSweet</a>, and <a href="Canderel">Canderel</a>, aspartame is an ingredient in approximately 6,000 consumer foods and beverages sold worldwide, including (but not limited to) diet sodas and other soft drinks, instant breakfasts, breath mints, cereals, sugar-free chewing gum, cocoa mixes, frozen desserts, gelatin desserts, juices, laxatives, chewable vitamin supplements, milk drinks, pharmaceutical drugs and supplements, shake mixes, tabletop sweeteners, teas, <a href="instant%20coffee">instant coffee</a>s, topping mixes, wine coolers and yogurt. It is provided as a table <a href="condiment">condiment</a> in some countries. Aspartame is less suitable for <a href="baking">baking</a> than other sweeteners, because it <a href="chemical%20decomposition">breaks down</a> when heated and loses much of its sweetness.

In 1985, <a href="Monsanto%20Company">Monsanto Company</a> bought G.D.Searle, and the aspartame business became a separate Monsanto subsidiary, the <a href="NutraSweet">NutraSweet Company</a>. In March 2000, Monsanto sold it to <a href="J.W.%20Childs">J.W. Childs</a> Equity Partners II L.P.<ref name="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EUY/is_22_6/ai_62920821"><a href="http%3A//www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EUY/is_22_6/ai_62920821">J.W. Childs Equity Partners II, L.P</a> , "Food & Drink Weekly", 5 June 2000</ref> European use patents on aspartame expired starting in 1987, and the U.S. patent expired in 1992. Since then, the company has competed for market share with other manufacturers, including <a href="Ajinomoto">Ajinomoto</a>, <a href="Merisant">Merisant</a> and the Holland Sweetener Company.

Many aspects of industrial synthesis of aspartame were established by Ajinomoto. In 2004, the market for aspartame, in which <a href="Ajinomoto">Ajinomoto</a>, the world's largest aspartame manufacturer, had a 40 percent share, was 14,000 metric tons a year, and consumption of the product was rising by 2 percent a year. Ajinomoto acquired its aspartame business in 2000 from <a href="Monsanto">Monsanto</a> for $67M.

In 2008, Ajinomoto sued British supermarket chain <a href="Asda">Asda</a>, part of <a href="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a>, for a malicious falsehood action concerning its aspartame product when the substance was listed as excluded from the chain's product line, along with other "nasties". In July 2009, a British court found in favour of Asda. In June 2010, an appeals court reversed the decision, allowing Ajinomoto to pursue a case against Asda to protect aspartame's reputation. Asda said that it would continue to use the term "no nasties" on its own-label products, but the suit was settled in 2011 with Asda choosing to remove references to aspartame from its packaging.

In November 2009, <a href="Ajinomoto">Ajinomoto</a> announced a new brand name for its aspartame sweetener – AminoSweet.

A joint venture of <a href="DSM%20%28company%29">DSM</a> and <a href="Tosoh">Tosoh</a>, the Holland Sweetener Company manufactured aspartame using the enzymatic process developed by Toyo Soda (Tosoh) and sold as the brand Sanecta. Additionally, they developed a combination <a href="aspartame-acesulfame%20salt">aspartame-acesulfame salt</a> under the brand name Twinsweet. They left the sweetener industry in late 2006, because "global aspartame markets are facing structural oversupply, which has caused worldwide strong price erosion over the last five years", making the business "persistently unprofitable".

Because <a href="sucralose">sucralose</a>, unlike aspartame, retains its sweetness after being heated, and has at least twice the shelf life of aspartame, it has become more popular as an ingredient. This, along with differences in marketing and changing consumer preferences, caused aspartame to lose market share to sucralose. In 2004, aspartame traded at about $30/kg and sucralose, which is roughly three times sweeter by weight, at around $300/kg.

Aspartame has been falsely claimed to have been originally developed as ant poison. The source for this was a satirical article posted on "thespoof" website. Further claims that the substance actually is poisonous to ants were inferred from that online article being quoted as fact by various anti-aspartame websites, and videos of numerous trials of this rumor have been shown on YouTube, or posted on social networks, some even claiming success in eradicating ants with Aspartame or with other sweeteners.

AutoCAD was derived from a program begun in 1977 and released in 1979 called <a href="Interact%20CAD">Interact CAD</a>, also referred to in early Autodesk documents as MicroCAD, which was written prior to Autodesk's (then Marinchip Software Partners) formation by Autodesk cofounder Mike Riddle.

The first version by Autodesk was demonstrated at the 1982 <a href="Comdex">Comdex</a> and released that December. As Autodesk's flagship product, by March 1986 AutoCAD had become the most ubiquitous CAD program worldwide. The 2018 release marked the 32nd major release of AutoCAD for <a href="Windows">Windows</a>. The 2014 release marked the fourth consecutive year of AutoCAD for <a href="macOS">Mac</a>.

The native file format of AutoCAD is "<a href=".dwg">.dwg</a>". This and, to a lesser extent, its interchange file format "<a href="DXF">DXF</a>", have become <a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>, if proprietary, standards for CAD data <a href="interoperability">interoperability</a>, particularly for 2D drawing exchange. AutoCAD has included support for <a href="Design%20Web%20Format">.dwf</a>, a format developed and promoted by Autodesk, for publishing CAD data.

Autodesk's logo and, respectively, AutoCAD icons have changed for several versions through the years.

ESRI ArcMap 10 permits export as AutoCAD drawing files. Civil 3D permits export as AutoCAD objects and as <a href="LandXML">LandXML</a>. Third-party <a href="file%20converter">file converter</a>s exist for specific formats such as Bentley MX GENIO Extension, PISTE Extension (France), 
ISYBAU (Germany), OKSTRA and <a href="Microdrainage">Microdrainage</a> (UK);
also, conversion of <a href=".pdf">.pdf</a> files is feasible, however, the accuracy of the results may be unpredictable or distorted. For example, jagged edges may appear. Several vendors provide on-line conversions for free such as Cometdocs.autoCAD commonly use in all purposes

AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT are available for <a href="English%20language">English</a>, <a href="German%20language">German</a>, <a href="French%20language">French</a>, <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>, <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, <a href="Korean%20language">Korean</a>, <a href="Chinese%20Simplified">Chinese Simplified</a>, <a href="Chinese%20Traditional">Chinese Traditional</a>, <a href="Brazilian%20Portuguese">Brazilian Portuguese</a>, <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>, <a href="Czech%20language">Czech</a>, <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a> and <a href="Hungarian%20language">Hungarian</a>, <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian</a> (also through additional Language Packs). The extent of localization varies from full translation of the product to documentation only. The AutoCAD command set is localized as a part of the software localization.

AutoCAD supports a number of <a href="application%20program%20interface">API</a>s for customization and automation. These include <a href="AutoLISP">AutoLISP</a>, <a href="Visual%20LISP">Visual LISP</a>, <a href="Visual%20Basic%20for%20Applications">VBA</a>, <a href="Microsoft%20.NET">.NET</a> and <a href="ObjectARX">ObjectARX</a>. ObjectARX is a <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a> class library, which was also the base for:
There are a large number of AutoCAD plugins (add-on applications) available on the application store Autodesk Exchange Apps
AutoCAD's <a href="DXF">DXF</a>, drawing exchange format, allows importing and exporting drawing information.

Autodesk has also developed a few vertical programs:



for discipline-specific enhancements.

For example, <a href="AutoCAD%20Architecture">AutoCAD Architecture</a> (formerly Architectural Desktop) permits architectural designers to draw 3D objects, such as walls, doors and windows, with more intelligent data associated with them rather than simple objects, such as lines and circles. The data can be programmed to represent specific architectural products sold in the construction industry, or extracted into a data file for pricing, materials estimation, and other values related to the objects represented.

Additional tools generate standard 2D drawings, such as elevations and sections, from a 3D architectural model. Similarly, Civil Design, Civil Design 3D, and Civil Design Professional support data-specific objects, facilitating easy standard civil engineering calculations and representations.

Civil 3D was originally developed as an AutoCAD add-on by a company in New Hampshire called Softdesk (originally DCA). Softdesk was acquired by Autodesk, and Civil 3D was further evolved.

AutoCAD Architecture (abbreviated as ACA) is a version of AutoCAD with tools and functions specially suited to <a href="Architecture">architectural</a> work.

AutoCAD LT is the lower cost version of AutoCAD, with reduced capabilities, first released in November 1993. Autodesk developed AutoCAD LT to have an entry-level CAD package to compete in the lower price level. AutoCAD LT, priced at $495, became the first AutoCAD product priced below $1000. It is sold directly by Autodesk and can also be purchased at computer stores (unlike the full version of AutoCAD, which must be purchased from official Autodesk dealers).

As of the 2011 release the AutoCAD LT MSRP has risen to $1200. While there are hundreds of small differences between the full AutoCAD package and AutoCAD LT, there are a few recognized major differences in the software's features:


AutoCAD LT 2015 introduced Desktop Subscription (rental) from $360 per year

Formerly marketed as AutoCAD WS, AutoCAD 360 is an account-based mobile and web application enabling registered users to view, edit, and share AutoCAD files via mobile device and web using a limited AutoCAD feature set — and using cloud-stored drawing files. The program, which is an evolution and combination of previous products, uses a <a href="freemium">freemium</a> business model with a free plan and two paid levels — marketed as Pro ($4.99 monthly or $49.99 yearly) and Pro Plus ($99.99 yearly) — including various amounts of storage, tools, and online access to drawings. 360 includes new features such as a "Smart Pen" mode and linking to third-party cloud-based storage such as <a href="Dropbox%20%28service%29">Dropbox</a>. Having evolved from Flash-based software, AutoCAD 360 uses <a href="HTML5">HTML5</a> browser technology available in newer browsers including Firefox and Google Chrome.

AutoCAD WS began with a version for the <a href="iPhone">iPhone</a> and subsequently expanded to include versions for the <a href="iPod%20Touch">iPod Touch</a>, <a href="iPad">iPad</a>, Android phones, and Android tablets. Autodesk released the <a href="iOS">iOS</a> version in September 2010, following with the <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> version on April 20, 2011. The program is available via download at no cost from the <a href="App%20Store%20%28iOS%29">App Store</a> (<a href="iOS">iOS</a>), <a href="Google%20Play">Google Play</a> (<a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a>) and <a href="Amazon%20Appstore">Amazon Appstore</a> (Android).

In its initial iOS version, AutoCAD WS supported drawing of lines, circles, and other shapes; creation of text and comment boxes; and management of color, layer, and measurements — in both landscape and portrait modes. Version 1.3, released August 17, 2011, added support of unit typing, layer visibility, area measurement and file management. The Android variant includes the iOS feature set along with such unique features as the ability to insert text or captions by voice command as well as manually. Both Android and iOS versions allow the user to save files on-line — or off-line in the absence of an Internet connection.

In 2011, Autodesk announced plans to migrate the majority of its software to "<a href="cloud%20computing">the cloud</a>", starting with the AutoCAD WS mobile application.

According to a 2013 interview with Ilai Rotbaein, an AutoCAD WS Product Manager for Autodesk, the name AutoCAD WS had no definitive meaning, and was interpreted variously as "Autodesk Web Service", "White Sheet" or "Work Space."

AutoCAD is licensed, for free, to students, educators, and educational institutions, with an 36-month renewable license available. The student version of AutoCAD is functionally identical to the full commercial version, with one exception: DWG files created or edited by a student version have an internal bit-flag set (the "educational flag"). When such a DWG file is printed by any version of AutoCAD (commercial or student) older than AutoCAD 2014 SP1, the output includes a plot stamp / banner on all four sides. Objects created in the Student Version cannot be used for commercial use. Student Version objects "infect" a commercial version DWG file if they are imported in versions older than AutoCAD 2015.

AutoCAD is a software package created for Windows and usually any new AutoCAD version supports the current Windows version and some older ones. AutoCAD 2016 and 2017 supports Windows 7 up to Windows 10.

Autodesk stopped supporting Apple's <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> computers in 1994. Over the next several years, no compatible versions for the Mac were released. In 2010 Autodesk announced that it would once again support Apple's Mac OS X software in the future. Most of the features found in the 2012 Windows version can be found in the 2012 Mac version. The main difference is the user interface and layout of the program. The interface is designed so that users who are already familiar with Apple's <a href="macOS">macOS</a> software will find it similar to other Mac applications. Autodesk has also built in various features in order to take full advantage of Apple's Trackpad capabilities as well as the full-screen mode in Apple's <a href="OS%20X%20Lion">OS X Lion</a>. AutoCAD 2012 for Mac supports both the editing and saving of files in DWG formatting that will allow the file to be compatible with other platforms besides the OS X. AutoCAD 2014 for Mac supports Apple OS X v10.9.0 or later (Mavericks), OS X v10.8.0 or later (Mountain Lion) with 64-bit Intel processor.

AutoCAD LT 2013 is now available through the <a href="Mac%20App%20Store">Mac App Store</a> for $899.99. The full featured version of AutoCAD 2013 for Mac, however, is not available through the Mac App Store due to the price limit of $999 set by Apple. AutoCAD 2014 for Mac is available for purchase from Autodesk's Web site for $4,195 and AutoCAD LT 2014 for Mac for $1,200, or from an Autodesk Authorized Reseller. The latest version available for Mac is AutoCAD 2017 as of July 2017.

Autodesk AutoCAD 360 is the official AutoCAD mobile app for <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> and <a href="iOS">iOS</a> and <a href="Windows">Windows</a> tablets (UWP). It can view, markup, measure and edit (2D only editing) any DWG file from a mobile phone or tablet. The actual file editing operations are performed in the cloud, in genuine DWG file format.

AutoCAD DXF

AutoCAD DXF (Drawing Interchange Format, or Drawing Exchange Format) is a <a href="Computer-aided%20design">CAD</a> data <a href="file%20format">file format</a> developed by <a href="Autodesk">Autodesk</a> for enabling <a href="CAD%20data%20exchange">data interoperability</a> between <a href="AutoCAD">AutoCAD</a> and other programs.

DXF was originally introduced in December 1982 as part of AutoCAD 1.0, and was intended to provide an exact representation of the data in the AutoCAD native file format, <a href=".dwg">DWG</a> (Drawing), for which Autodesk for many years did not publish specifications. Because of this, correct imports of DXF files have been difficult. Autodesk now publishes the DXF specifications as a PDF on its website.

Versions of AutoCAD from Release 10 (October 1988) and up support both <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> and <a href="binary%20file">binary</a> forms of DXF. Earlier versions support only ASCII.

As AutoCAD has become more powerful, supporting more complex object types, DXF has become less useful. Certain object types, including <a href="ACIS">ACIS</a> solids and regions, are not documented. Other object types, including AutoCAD 2006's dynamic blocks, and all of the objects specific to the <a href="vertical%20market">vertical market</a> versions of AutoCAD, are partially documented, but not well enough to allow other developers to support them. For these reasons many CAD applications use the <a href=".dwg">DWG</a> format which can be licensed from <a href="Autodesk">Autodesk</a> or non-natively from the <a href="Open%20Design%20Alliance">Open Design Alliance</a>.

DXF coordinates are always without dimensions so that the reader or user needs to know the drawing unit or has to extract it from the textual comments in the sheets.

ASCII versions of DXF can be read with any <a href="text%20editor">text editor</a>. The basic organization of a DXF file is as follows:


The data format of a DXF is called a "tagged data" format which "means that each data element in the file is preceded by an integer number that is called a group code. A group code's value indicates what type of data element follows. This value also indicates the meaning of a data element for a given object (or record) type. Virtually all user-specified information in a drawing file can be represented in DXF format."

<doc id="2756" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2756" title="Asexual reproduction">
Asexual reproduction

Asexual reproduction is a type of <a href="reproduction">reproduction</a> by which offspring arise from a single organism, and inherit the genes of that parent only; it does not involve the fusion of <a href="gamete">gamete</a>s, and almost never changes the number of <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s. Asexual reproduction is the primary form of reproduction for <a href="single-celled%20organism">single-celled organism</a>s such as the <a href="Archaea">Archaea</a> and <a href="eubacteria">bacteria</a>. Many <a href="plant">plant</a>s and <a href="Fungus">fungi</a> reproduce asexually as well.

While all <a href="prokaryote">prokaryote</a>s reproduce asexually (without the formation and fusion of gametes), mechanisms for <a href="lateral%20gene%20transfer">lateral gene transfer</a> such as <a href="Bacterial%20conjugation">conjugation</a>, <a href="Transformation%20%28genetics%29">transformation</a> and <a href="Transduction%20%28genetics%29">transduction</a> are sometimes likened to <a href="sexual%20reproduction">sexual reproduction</a> or at least with <a href="sex">sex</a>, in the sense of <a href="genetic%20recombination">genetic recombination</a> in <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a>. Current hypotheses suggest that asexual reproduction may have benefits when rapid population growth is important or in stable environments, while sexual reproduction offers a net advantage by allowing more rapid generation of genetic diversity allowing adaptation to changing environments . Developmental constraints may underlie why few animals have relinquished sexual reproduction completely in their life-cycles. Another constraint on switching from sexual to asexual reproduction would be the concomitant loss of meiosis and the protective recombinational repair of DNA damage afforded as one function of meiosis.

An important form of <a href="Fission%20%28biology%29">fission</a> is "binary fission".
In binary fission, the parent organism is replaced by two daughter organisms, because it literally divides in two. Only <a href="prokaryote">prokaryote</a>s (the <a href="archaea">archaea</a> and the <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>) reproduce asexually through binary fission. <a href="Eukaryote">Eukaryote</a>s (such as <a href="protist">protist</a>s and unicellular <a href="fungi">fungi</a>) may reproduce in a functionally similar manner by <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a>; most of these are also capable of sexual reproduction.

Another type of fission is "multiple fission". Multiple fission at the cellular level occurs in many <a href="protist">protist</a>s, e.g. <a href="sporozoa">sporozoa</a>ns and <a href="algae">algae</a>. The <a href="Cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a> of the parent cell divides several times by <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a>, producing several nuclei. The cytoplasm then separates, creating multiple daughter cells.

In <a href="apicomplexa">apicomplexa</a>ns, multiple fission, or <a href="schizogony">schizogony</a>, is manifested either as <a href="protozoal%20merogony">merogony</a>, <a href="sporogony">sporogony</a> or <a href="gametogony">gametogony</a>. Merogony results in <a href="merozoite">merozoite</a>s, which are multiple daughter cells, that originate within the same cell membrane, sporogony results in <a href="sporozoite">sporozoite</a>s, and gametogony results in micro<a href="gamete">gamete</a>s.

Some cells split via <a href="budding">budding</a> (for example <a href="Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae">baker's yeast</a>), resulting in a "mother" and "daughter" cell. The offspring organism is smaller than the parent. Budding is also known on a multicellular level; an animal example is the <a href="Hydra%20%28genus%29">hydra</a>, which reproduces by budding. The buds grow into fully matured individuals which eventually break away from the parent organism.

Internal budding is a process of asexual reproduction, favoured by parasites such as "<a href="Toxoplasma%20gondii">Toxoplasma gondii</a>". It involves an unusual process in which two ("endodyogeny") or more ("endopolygeny") daughter cells are produced inside a mother cell, which is then consumed by the offspring prior to their separation.

Also, budding (external or internal) is present in some worm like <a href="Taenia%20%28genus%29">Taenia</a> or <a href="Echinococcus">Echinococci</a>; these worm produce cyst and then produce (invaginated or evaginated) <a href="protoscolex">protoscolex</a> with <a href="budding">budding</a>.

Vegetative propagation is a type of asexual reproduction found in plants where new individuals are formed without the production of seeds or spores by <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a> or <a href="syngamy">syngamy</a>. Examples of vegetative reproduction include the formation of miniaturized plants called plantlets on specialized leaves (for example in <a href="kalanchoe">kalanchoe</a>) and some produce new plants out of <a href="rhizome">rhizome</a>s or <a href="stolon">stolon</a> (for example in <a href="Garden%20strawberry">strawberry</a>). Other plants reproduce by forming <a href="bulb">bulb</a>s or <a href="tuber">tuber</a>s (for example <a href="tulip">tulip</a> bulbs and <a href="dahlia">dahlia</a> tubers). Some plants produce <a href="adventitious">adventitious</a> shoots and may form a <a href="clonal%20colony">clonal colony</a>, where all the individuals are clones, and the clones may cover a large area.

Many multicellular organisms form <a href="spore">spore</a>s during their <a href="biological%20life%20cycle">biological life cycle</a> in a process called sporogenesis. Exceptions are animals and some protists, who undergo "meiosis" immediately followed by fertilization. Plants and many algae on the other hand undergo "sporic meiosis" where meiosis leads to the formation of haploid spores rather than gametes. These spores grow into multicellular individuals (called <a href="gametophyte">gametophyte</a>s in the case of plants) without a fertilization event. These haploid individuals give rise to <a href="gamete">gamete</a>s through <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a>. Meiosis and gamete formation therefore occur in separate generations or "phases" of the life cycle, referred to as <a href="alternation%20of%20generations">alternation of generations</a>. Since sexual reproduction is often more narrowly defined as the fusion of gametes (<a href="fertilization">fertilization</a>), spore formation in plant <a href="sporophyte">sporophyte</a>s and algae might be considered a form of asexual reproduction (agamogenesis) despite being the result of <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a> and undergoing a reduction in <a href="ploidy">ploidy</a>. However, both events (spore formation and fertilization) are necessary to complete sexual reproduction in the plant life cycle.

Fungi and some algae can also utilize true asexual <a href="spore">spore</a> formation, which involves <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a> giving rise to reproductive cells called mitospores that develop into a new organism after dispersal. This method of reproduction is found for example in <a href="Conidium">conidial fungi</a> and the <a href="red%20algae">red algae</a> "Polysiphonia", and involves sporogenesis without meiosis. Thus the chromosome number of the spore cell is the same as that of the parent producing the spores. However, mitotic sporogenesis is an exception and most spores, such as those of plants, most <a href="Basidiomycota">Basidiomycota</a>, and many algae, are produced by <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a>.

Fragmentation is a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism grows from a fragment of the parent. Each fragment develops into a mature, fully grown individual. Fragmentation is seen in many organisms. Animals that reproduce asexually include <a href="planarian">planarian</a>s, many <a href="annelid">annelid</a> worms including <a href="polychaete">polychaete</a>s and some <a href="oligochaete">oligochaete</a>s, <a href="turbellarians">turbellarians</a> and <a href="sea%20stars">sea stars</a>. Many fungi and plants reproduce asexually. Some plants have specialized structures for reproduction via fragmentation, such as "<a href="Gemma%20%28botany%29">gemma</a>" in <a href="Marchantiophyta">liverworts</a>. Most <a href="lichen">lichen</a>s, which are a <a href="Symbiosis">symbiotic</a> union of a fungus and <a href="Photosynthesis">photosynthetic</a> algae or bacteria, reproduce through fragmentation to ensure that new individuals contain both symbiont. These fragments can take the form of "soredia", dust-like particles consisting of fungal hyphen wrapped around photobiont cells.

Clonal Fragmentation in multicellular or colonial organisms is a form of asexual reproduction or cloning where an organism is split into fragments. Each of these fragments develop into mature, fully grown individuals that are clones of the original organism. In <a href="echinoderm">echinoderm</a>s, this method of reproduction is usually known as fissiparity. Researchers claim today that due to many environmental and <a href="Epigenetics">epigenetic</a> differences, that clones originated in the same ancestor might actually be genetically and epigenetically different.

Agamogenesis is any form of reproduction that does not involve a male gamete. Examples are <a href="parthenogenesis">parthenogenesis</a> and <a href="apomixis">apomixis</a>.

Parthenogenesis is a form of <a href="agamogenesis">agamogenesis</a> in which an unfertilized egg develops into a new individual. Parthenogenesis occurs naturally in many plants, <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s (e.g. water fleas, <a href="rotifer">rotifer</a>s, aphids, <a href="stick%20insect">stick insect</a>s, some ants, bees and parasitic wasps), and <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s (e.g. some reptiles, amphibians, rarely birds). In plants, <a href="apomixis">apomixis</a> may or may not involve parthenogenesis.

Apomixis in plants is the formation of a new <a href="sporophyte">sporophyte</a> without fertilization. It is important in ferns and in flowering plants, but is very rare in other seed plants. In flowering plants, the term "apomixis" is now most often used for <a href="agamospermy">agamospermy</a>, the formation of seeds without fertilization, but was once used to include <a href="vegetative%20reproduction">vegetative reproduction</a>. An example of an <a href="apomictic">apomictic</a> plant would be the <a href="triploid">triploid</a> European <a href="dandelion">dandelion</a>. Apomixis mainly occurs in two forms: In gametophytic apomixis, the embryo arises from an unfertilized egg within a diploid embryo sac that was formed without completing meiosis. In <a href="nucellar%20embryony">nucellar embryony</a>, the embryo is formed from the diploid <a href="nucellus">nucellus</a> tissue surrounding the embryo sac. Nucellar embryony occurs in some <a href="citrus">citrus</a> seeds. Male apomixis can occur in rare cases, such as the Saharan Cypress "<a href="Cupressus%20dupreziana">Cupressus dupreziana</a>", where the genetic material of the embryo are derived entirely from <a href="pollen">pollen</a>.
The term "apomixis" is also used for asexual reproduction in some animals, notably water-fleas, "<a href="Daphnia">Daphnia</a>".

Some species alternate between the sexual and asexual strategies, an ability known as <a href="heterogamy">heterogamy</a>, depending on conditions. Alternation is observed in several <a href="rotifer">rotifer</a> species (cyclical parthenogenesis e.g. in <a href="Brachionus">Brachionus</a> species) and a few types of insects, such as <a href="aphid">aphid</a>s which will, under certain conditions, produce eggs that have not gone through meiosis, thus cloning themselves. The cape bee <a href="Apis%20mellifera%20capensis">"Apis mellifera" subsp. "capensis"</a> can reproduce asexually through a process called <a href="thelytoky">thelytoky</a>. A few species of amphibians, reptiles, and birds have a similar ability (see <a href="parthenogenesis">parthenogenesis</a> for examples).
For example, the freshwater crustacean "<a href="Daphnia">Daphnia</a>" reproduces by parthenogenesis in the spring to rapidly populate ponds, then switches to <a href="sexual%20reproduction">sexual reproduction</a> as the intensity of competition and predation increases. Another example are monogonont <a href="rotifer">rotifer</a>s of the genus "<a href="Brachionus">Brachionus</a>", which reproduce via cyclical parthenogenesis: at low population densities females produce asexually and at higher densities a chemical cue accumulates and induces the transition to sexual reproduction. Many protists and fungi alternate between sexual and asexual reproduction.

For example, the slime mold "<a href="Dictyostelium">Dictyostelium</a>" undergoes binary fission (mitosis) as single-celled amoebae under favorable conditions. However, when conditions turn unfavorable, the cells aggregate and follow one of two different developmental pathways, depending on conditions. In the social pathway, they form a multicellular slug which then forms a fruiting body with asexually generated spores. In the sexual pathway, two cells fuse to form a giant cell that develops into a large cyst. When this macrocyst germinates, it releases hundreds of amoebic cells that are the product of meiotic recombination between the original two cells.

The hyphae of the common mold ("<a href="Rhizopus">Rhizopus</a>") are capable of producing both mitotic as well as meiotic spores. Many algae similarly switch between sexual and asexual reproduction. A number of plants use both sexual and asexual means to produce new plants, some species alter their primary modes of reproduction from sexual to asexual under varying environmental conditions.

For example, in the <a href="rotifer">rotifer</a> "<a href="Brachionus">Brachionus</a> calyciflorus" asexual reproduction (obligate <a href="parthenogenesis">parthenogenesis</a>) can be inherited by a recessive allele, which leads to loss of sexual reproduction in homozygous offspring.
Inheritance of asexual reproduction by a single recessive locus has also been found in the parasitoid wasp "Lysiphlebus fabarum".

Parthenogenesis occurs in the <a href="hammerhead%20shark">hammerhead shark</a> and the <a href="blacktip%20shark">blacktip shark</a>. In both cases, the sharks had reached sexual maturity in captivity in the absence of males, and in both cases the offspring were shown to be genetically identical to the mothers. The <a href="New%20Mexico%20whiptail">New Mexico whiptail</a> is another example.

Reptiles use the <a href="ZW%20sex-determination%20system">ZW sex-determination system</a>, which produces either males (with ZZ sex chromosomes) or females (with ZW or WW sex chromosomes). Until 2010, it was thought that the ZW chromosome system used by reptiles was incapable of producing viable WW offspring, but a (ZW) female <a href="boa%20constrictor">boa constrictor</a> was discovered to have produced viable female offspring with WW chromosomes. The female boa could have chosen any number of male partners (and had successfully in the past) but on these occasions she reproduced asexually, creating 22 female babies with WW sex-chromosomes.

<a href="Polyembryony">Polyembryony</a> is a widespread form of asexual reproduction in animals, whereby the fertilized egg or a later stage of embryonic development splits to form genetically identical clones. Within animals, this phenomenon has been best studied in the parasitic <a href="Hymenoptera">Hymenoptera</a>. In the <a href="9-banded%20armadillos">9-banded armadillos</a>, this process is obligatory and usually gives rise to genetically identical quadruplets. In other mammals, <a href="monozygotic%20twinning">monozygotic twinning</a> has no apparent genetic basis, though its occurrence is common. There are at least 10 million identical human twins and triplets in the world today.

Bdelloid <a href="rotifer">rotifer</a>s reproduce exclusively asexually, and all individuals in the class <a href="Bdelloidea">Bdelloidea</a> are females. Asexuality evolved in these animals millions of years ago and has persisted since. There is evidence to suggest that asexual reproduction has allowed the animals to evolve new proteins through the <a href="Matthew%20Meselson%23The%20Meselson%20Effect">Meselson effect</a> that have allowed them to survive better in periods of dehydration.

Molecular evidence strongly suggest that several species of the <a href="stick%20insect">stick insect</a> genus "<a href="Timema">Timema</a>" have used only asexual (parthenogenetic) reproduction for millions of years, the longest period known for any insect.

In the grass <a href="thrips">thrips</a> genus "<a href="Aptinothrips">Aptinothrips</a>" there have been several transitions to asexuality, likely due to different causes.

Aelbert Jacobsz Cuyp (October 20, 1620 – November 15, 1691) was one of the leading <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> <a href="landscape%20painting">landscape</a> <a href="Painting">painter</a>s of the <a href="Dutch%20Golden%20Age">Dutch Golden Age</a> in the 17th century. The most famous of a family of painters, the pupil of his father <a href="Jacob%20Gerritsz%20Cuyp">Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp</a> (1594–1651/52), he is especially known for his large views of the Dutch countryside in early morning or late afternoon light.

Aelbert Cuyp was born in <a href="Dordrecht">Dordrecht</a> on October 20, 1620, and also died there on November 15, 1691. Known as the <a href="Netherlands">Dutch</a> equivalent of <a href="Claude%20Lorrain">Claude Lorrain</a>, this <a href="landscape%20art">landscape art</a>ist went on to inherit a considerable fortune. His family were all artists, with his uncle <a href="Benjamin%20Gerritsz%20Cuyp">Benjamin</a> and grandfather <a href="Gerrit%20Gerritsz%20Cuyp">Gerrit</a> being <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> cartoon designers. Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp, his father, was a <a href="portraitist">portraitist</a>.

The amount of biographical information regarding Aelbert Cuyp is tremendously limited. Even Arnold Houbraken, a noted historian of Dutch Golden Age paintings and the sole authority on Cuyp for the hundred years following his death, paints a very thin biographical picture. His period of activity as a painter is traditionally limited to the two decades between 1639 and 1660, fitting directly within the generally accepted limits of the Dutch Golden Age's most significant period, 1640-1665. He is known to have been married to Cornelia Bosman in 1658, a date coinciding so directly with the end of his productivity as a painter that it has been accepted that his marriage played some sort of role in the end of his artistic career. The year after his marriage Cuyp became the deacon of the reformed church. Even Houbraken recalled that Cuyp was a devout Calvinist and the fact that when he died, there were no paintings of other artists found in his home.

The development of Aelbert Cuyp, who was trained as a landscape painter, may be roughly sketched in three phases based on the painters who most influenced him during that time and the subsequent artistic characteristics that are apparent in his paintings. Generally, Cuyp learned tone from the exceptionally prolific <a href="Jan%20van%20Goyen">Jan van Goyen</a>, light from <a href="Jan%20Both">Jan Both</a> and form from his father, Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp.

Cuyp's "van Goyen phase" can be placed approximately in the early 1640s.
Cuyp probably first encountered a painting by van Goyen in 1640 when van Goyen was, as Stephen Reiss points out "at the height of [his] powers." This is noticeable in the comparison between two of Cuyp's landscape paintings inscribed 1639 where no properly formed style is apparent and the landscape backgrounds he painted two years later for two of his father's group portraits that are distinctly van Goyenesque. 
Cuyp took from van Goyen the straw yellow and light brown tones that are so apparent in his Dunes (1629) and the broken brush technique also very noticeable in that same work. 
This technique, a precursor to impressionism, is noted for the short brush strokes where the colors are not necessarily blended smoothly. In Cuyp's River Scene, Two Men Conversing (1641) both of these van Goyen-influenced stylistic elements are noticeable

The next phase in the development of Cuyp's increasingly amalgamated style is due to the influence of Jan Both. In the mid-1640s Both, a native and resident of Utrecht, had just returned to his hometown from a trip to Rome. It is around this same time that Cuyp's style changed fundamentally. In Rome, Both had developed a new style of composition due, at least in part, to his interaction with Claude Lorrain. This new style was focused on changing the direction of light in the painting. Instead of the light being placed at right angles in relation to the line of vision, Both started moving it to a diagonal position from the back of the picture. In this new form of lighting, the artist (and viewer of the painting) faced the sun more or less contre-jour. Both, and subsequently Cuyp, used the advantages of this new lighting style to alter the sense of depth and luminosity possible in a painting. To make notice of these new capabilities, much use was made of elongated shadows. Cuyp was one of the first Dutch painters to appreciate this new leap forward in style and while his own Both-inspired phase was quite short (limited to the mid-1640s) he did, more than any other contemporary Dutch artist, maximize the full chromatic scale for sunsets and sunrises.

Cuyp's third stylistic phase (which occurred throughout his career) is based on the influence of his father. While it is assumed that the younger Cuyp did work with his father initially to develop rudimentary talents, Aelbert became more focused on landscape paintings while Jacob was a portrait painter by profession. As has been mentioned and as will be explained in depth below, there are pieces where Aelbert provided the landscape background for his father's portraits. What is meant by stating that Aelbert learned form from his father is that his eventual transition from a specifically landscape painter to the involvement of foreground figures is attributed to his interaction with his father Jacob. The evidence for Aelbert's evolution to foreground figure painter is in the production of some paintings from 1645-50 featuring foreground animals that do not fit with Jacob's style. Adding to the confusion that is, Aelbert's stylistic development and the problem of attribution is of course the fact that Jacob's style was not stagnant either. Their converging styles make it difficult to exactly understand the influences each had on the other, although it is clear enough to say that Aelbert started representing large scale forms (something he had not done previously) and placing animals as the focus of his paintings (something that was specific to him).

Sunlight in his paintings rakes across the panel, accentuating small bits of detail in the golden light. In large, atmospheric panoramas of the countryside, the highlights on a blade of meadow grass, the mane of a tranquil horse, the horn of a dairy cow reclining by a stream, or the tip of a peasant's hat are all caught in a bath of yellow ocher light. The richly <a href="varnish">varnish</a>ed medium refracts the rays of light like a jewel as it dissolves into numerous glazed layers. Cuyp's landscapes were based on reality and on his own invention of what an enchanting landscape should be.

Cuyp's drawings reveal him to be a <a href="drawing">draftsman</a> of superior quality. Light-drenched washes of <a href="Walnut%20ink">golden brown ink</a> depict a distant view of the city of <a href="Dordrecht">Dordrecht</a> or <a href="Utrecht">Utrecht</a>.
A Cuyp drawing may look like he intended it to be a finished work of art, but it was most likely taken back to the studio and used as a reference for his paintings. Often the same section of a sketch can be found in several different pictures.

Cuyp signed many of his works but rarely dated them, so that a chronology of his career has not been satisfactorily reassembled. A phenomenal number of paintings are ascribed to him, some of which are likely to be by other masters of the golden landscape, such as <a href="Abraham%20Calraet">Abraham Calraet</a> (1642–1722), whose initials "A.C." may be mistaken for Cuyp's.

However, not everyone appreciates his work and "River Landscape" (1660), despite being widely regarded as amongst his best work, has been described as having "<a href="Chocolate%20box%20art">chocolate box</a> blandness".

In addition to the scarcely documented and confirmed biography of Cuyp's life, and even more so than his amalgamated style from his three main influences, there are yet other factors that have led to the misattribution and confusion over Aelbert Cuyp's works for hundreds of years. His highly influenced style which incorporated Italianate lighting from Jan Both, broken brush technique and atonality from Jan van Goyen, and his ever-developing style from his father Jacob Gerritsz Cuyp was studied acutely by his most prominent follower, Abraham van Calraet. Calraet mimicked Cuyp's style, incorporating the same aspects, and produced similar landscapes to that of the latter. This made it quite difficult to tell whose paintings where whose. Adding to the confusion is the similar initials between the two and the inconsistent signing of paintings which were produced by Cuyp's studio.

Although Aelbert Cuyp signed many of his paintings with a script "A. Cuyp" insignia, many paintings were left unsigned (not to mention undated) after being painted, and so a similar signature was added later on, presumably by collectors who inherited or discovered the works. Furthermore, many possible Cuyp paintings were not signed but rather initialed "A. C." referring to his name. However, Abraham van Calraet could also have used the same initials to denote a painting. Although this is unlikely (as Calraet would likely have signed his paintings "A. v.C."), this brings up the question of how paintings were signed to show ownership. Most original Cuyp paintings were signed by him, and in the script manner in which his name was inscribed. This would denote that the painting was done almost entirely by him. Conversely, paintings which came out of his workshop that were not necessarily physically worked on by Cuyp but merely overseen by him technically, were marked with A.C. to show that it was his instruction which saw the paintings' completion. Cuyp's pupils and assistants often worked on paintings in his studio, and so most of the work of a painting could be done without Cuyp ever touching the canvas, but merely approving its finality. Hence, the initialed inscription rather than a signature.

Common among the mislabeled works are all of the reasons identified for misattributing Cuyp's works: the lack of biography and chronology of his works made it difficult to discern when paintings were created (making it difficult to pinpoint an artist); contentious signatures added to historians' confusion as to who actually painted the works; and the collaborations and influences by different painters makes it hard to justify that a painting is genuinely that of Aelbert Cuyp; and finally, accurate identification is made extremely difficult by the fact that this same style was copied (rather accurately) by his predecessor. As it turns out, even the historians and expert researchers have been fooled and forced to reassess their conclusions over "Cuyp's" paintings over the years.

After he married Cornelia Boschman in 1658, the number of works produced by him declined almost to nothing. This may have been because his wife was a very religious woman and a not very big patron of the arts. It could also be that he became more active in the church under his wife's guidance. He was also active as deacon and elder of the Reformed Church.

Upon close examination of the works attributed to Aelbert Cuyp it is easily understood why his unique style developed the way it did, and how his works have been misinterpreted over the years. A lacking biography and weak chronology of works as well as his style which emerged from various influences makes his works distinctive, yet often questionable in determination. Furthermore, his evolving technique and collaborations with his father add to the puzzle over which works should be attributed to Cuyp. Lastly and most importantly, the precision in mimicking Cuyp's style by his follower Abraham van Calraet and their contentious signatures makes it all the more difficult to determine which paintings are genuinely that of Cuyp and which ones are actually accurate reproductions in his style.

Such a thin chronology and little background knowledge has led to gross misinterpretations of his works, and thus further investigation must always be done to conclude with confidence that Aelbert Cuyp is the genuine source of such great paintings. It is this felt reluctance which led the Rijksmuseum to reattribute works to other painters (Abraham van Calraet does not even appear in a Museum catalogue until 1926, and even then he is not given his own entry) which shows how important it is to art historians that painters are accurately connected to their works—and this is continuously necessary for those of Aelbert Cuyp, as Dordrecht's most famous painter may not in fact be Dordrecht's most famous painter.

Alkene

In <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic chemistry</a>, an alkene is an <a href="unsaturated%20hydrocarbon">unsaturated hydrocarbon</a> that contains at least one <a href="carbon">carbon</a>–carbon <a href="double%20bond">double bond</a>. The words alkene and olefin are often used interchangeably (see <a href="Alkene%23Nomenclature">nomenclature</a> section below). Acyclic alkenes, with only one double bond and no other <a href="functional%20group">functional group</a>s, known as mono-enes, form a <a href="homologous%20series">homologous series</a> of <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a>s with the general formula . Alkenes have two <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> <a href="atom">atom</a>s fewer than the corresponding <a href="alkane">alkane</a> (with the same number of carbon atoms). The simplest alkene, <a href="ethylene">ethylene</a> (CH), with the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry</a> (IUPAC) name "ethene", is the <a href="organic%20compound">organic compound</a> produced on the largest scale industrially. <a href="Aromatic">Aromatic</a> compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes, but their structure and properties are different and they are not considered to be alkenes.

Like a single <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent bond</a>, double bonds can be described in terms of overlapping <a href="atom">atom</a>ic orbitals, except that, unlike a single bond (which consists of a single <a href="sigma%20bond">sigma bond</a>), a carbon–carbon double bond consists of one <a href="sigma%20bond">sigma bond</a> and one <a href="pi%20bond">pi bond</a>. This double bond is stronger than a single <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent bond</a> (611 <a href="joule">kJ</a>/<a href="Mole%20%28unit%29">mol</a> for C=C vs. 347 kJ/mol for C–C) and also shorter, with an average <a href="bond%20length">bond length</a> of 1.33 <a href="%C3%A5ngstr%C3%B6m">ångström</a>s (133 <a href="picometre">pm</a>).

Each carbon of the double bond uses its three sp <a href="orbital%20hybridization">hybrid orbitals</a> to form sigma bonds to three atoms (the other carbon and two hydrogen atoms). The unhybridized 2p atomic orbitals, which lie perpendicular to the plane created by the axes of the three sp² hybrid orbitals, combine to form the pi bond. This bond lies outside the main C–C axis, with half of the bond on one side of the molecule and half on the other.

Rotation about the carbon–carbon double bond is restricted because it incurs an energetic cost to break the alignment of the <a href="p%20orbital">p orbital</a>s on the two carbon atoms. As a consequence, substituted alkenes may exist as one of two <a href="isomer">isomer</a>s, called "cis" or "trans" isomers. More complex alkenes may be named with the <a href="E-Z%20notation">"E"–"Z" notation</a> for molecules with three or four different <a href="substituent">substituent</a>s (side groups). For example, of the <a href="Butene%23Isomers">isomers of butene</a>, the two methyl groups of ("Z")-but-2<a href="-ene">-ene</a> (a.k.a. "cis"-2-butene) appear on the same side of the double bond, and in ("E")-but-2-ene (a.k.a. "trans"-2-butene) the methyl groups appear on opposite sides. These two isomers of butene are slightly different in their chemical and physical properties.

A 90° twist of the C=C bond (which may be determined by the positions of the groups attached to the carbons) requires less energy than the strength of a <a href="pi%20bond">pi bond</a>, and the bond still holds. This contradicts a common textbook assertion that the <a href="p%20orbital">p orbital</a>s would be unable sustain such a bond. In truth, the misalignment of the <a href="p%20orbital">p orbital</a>s is less than expected because <a href="pyramidalization">pyramidalization</a> takes place (See: <a href="pyramidal%20alkene">pyramidal alkene</a>). "trans"-<a href="Cyclooctene">Cyclooctene</a> is a stable strained alkene and the orbital misalignment is only 19° with a <a href="dihedral%20angle">dihedral angle</a> of 137° (normal 120°) and a degree of pyramidalization of 18°. The "trans" isomer of <a href="cycloheptene">cycloheptene</a> is stable only at low temperatures.

As predicted by the <a href="VSEPR%20theory">VSEPR</a> model of <a href="electron">electron</a> pair repulsion, the <a href="molecular%20geometry">molecular geometry</a> of alkenes includes <a href="bond%20angle">bond angle</a>s about each carbon in a double bond of about 120°. The angle may vary because of <a href="steric%20strain">steric strain</a> introduced by <a href="nonbonded%20interactions">nonbonded interactions</a> between <a href="functional%20group">functional group</a>s attached to the carbons of the double bond. For example, the C–C–C bond angle in <a href="propylene">propylene</a> is 123.9°.

For bridged alkenes, <a href="Bredt%27s%20rule">Bredt's rule</a> states that a double bond cannot occur at the bridgehead of a bridged ring system unless the rings are large enough. Following Fawcett and defining "S" as the total number of non-bridgehead atoms in the rings, bicyclic systems require "S" ≥ 7 for stability and tricyclic systems require "S" ≥ 11.

The physical properties of alkenes and <a href="alkane">alkane</a>s are similar. They are colourless, nonpolar, combustable, and almost odorless. The <a href="physical%20state">physical state</a> depends on <a href="molecular%20mass">molecular mass</a>: like the corresponding saturated hydrocarbons, the simplest alkenes, <a href="Ethylene">ethene</a>, <a href="propene">propene</a>, and <a href="butene">butene</a> are gases at room temperature. Linear alkenes of approximately five to sixteen carbons are liquids, and higher alkenes are waxy solids.

Alkenes are relatively stable compounds, but are more reactive than <a href="alkane">alkane</a>s, either because of the reactivity of the carbon–carbon pi-bond or the presence of <a href="allylic">allylic</a> CH centers. Most reactions of alkenes involve additions to this pi bond, forming new <a href="sigma%20bond">single bonds</a>. Alkenes serve as a feedstock for the <a href="petrochemical">petrochemical</a> industry because they can participate in a wide variety of reactions, prominently polymerization and alkylation.

Alkenes react in many <a href="addition%20reaction">addition reaction</a>s, which occur by opening up the double-bond. Most of these addition reactions follow the mechanism of <a href="electrophilic%20addition">electrophilic addition</a>. Examples are <a href="hydrohalogenation">hydrohalogenation</a>, <a href="halogenation">halogenation</a>, <a href="halohydrin%20formation">halohydrin formation</a>, <a href="oxymercuration">oxymercuration</a>, <a href="Hydroboration%E2%80%93oxidation%20reaction">hydroboration</a>, <a href="dichlorocarbene%20addition">dichlorocarbene addition</a>, <a href="Simmons%E2%80%93Smith%20reaction">Simmons–Smith reaction</a>, <a href="catalytic%20hydrogenation">catalytic hydrogenation</a>, <a href="epoxidation">epoxidation</a>, <a href="radical%20polymerization">radical polymerization</a> and <a href="hydroxylation">hydroxylation</a>.

<a href="Hydrogenation">Hydrogenation</a> of alkenes produces the corresponding <a href="alkane">alkane</a>s. The reaction is carried out under pressure at a temperature of 200 °C in the presence of a metallic <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a>. Common industrial catalysts are based on <a href="platinum">platinum</a>, <a href="nickel">nickel</a> or <a href="palladium">palladium</a>. For laboratory syntheses, <a href="Raney%20nickel">Raney nickel</a> (an <a href="alloy">alloy</a> of nickel and aluminium) is often employed. The simplest example of this reaction is the catalytic hydrogenation of <a href="ethylene">ethylene</a> to yield <a href="ethane">ethane</a>:

<a href="Hydration%20reaction">Hydration</a>, the addition of water across the double bond of alkenes, yields <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a>s. The reaction is catalyzed by strong <a href="acids">acids</a> such as <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a>. This reaction is carried out on an industrial scale to produce <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a>.

Alkenes can also be converted into alcohols via the <a href="oxymercuration%E2%80%93demercuration%20reaction">oxymercuration–demercuration reaction</a> , the <a href="hydroboration%E2%80%93oxidation%20reaction">hydroboration–oxidation reaction</a> or by <a href="Mukaiyama%20hydration">Mukaiyama hydration</a>.

In <a href="electrophilic%20halogenation">electrophilic halogenation</a> the addition of elemental <a href="bromine">bromine</a> or <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a> to alkenes yields <a href="vicinal%20%28chemistry%29">vicinal</a> dibromo- and dichloroalkanes (1,2-dihalides or ethylene dihalides), respectively. The decoloration of a solution of bromine in water is an analytical test for the presence of alkenes:

Related reactions are also used as quantitative measures of unsaturation, expressed as the <a href="bromine%20number">bromine number</a> and <a href="iodine%20number">iodine number</a> of a compound or mixture.

<a href="Hydrohalogenation">Hydrohalogenation</a> is the addition of <a href="hydrogen%20halide">hydrogen halide</a>s such as <a href="hydrogen%20chloride">HCl</a> or <a href="hydrogen%20iodide">HI</a> to alkenes to yield the corresponding <a href="haloalkane">haloalkane</a>s:

If the two carbon atoms at the double bond are linked to a different number of hydrogen atoms, the halogen is found preferentially at the carbon with fewer hydrogen substituents. This patterns is known as <a href="Markovnikov%27s%20rule">Markovnikov's rule</a>. The use of <a href="Free-radical%20addition">radical initiators</a> or other compounds can lead to the opposite product result. <a href="Hydrobromic%20acid">Hydrobromic acid</a> in particular is prone to forming radicals in the presence of various impurities or even atmospheric oxygen, leading to the reversal of the Markovnikov result:

Alkenes react with water and halogens to form <a href="halohydrin">halohydrin</a>s by an addition reaction. <a href="Markovnikov%27s%20rule">Markovnikov regiochemistry</a> and anti stereochemistry occur.

Alkenes are <a href="organic%20oxidation">oxidized</a> with a large number of <a href="oxidizing%20agent">oxidizing agent</a>s. In the presence of <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, alkenes burn with a bright flame to produce <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and water. <a href="Catalysis">Catalytic</a> oxidation with oxygen or the reaction with <a href="Peroxy%20acid">percarboxylic acids</a> yields <a href="epoxide">epoxide</a>s. Reaction with ozone in <a href="ozonolysis">ozonolysis</a> leads to the breaking of the double bond, yielding two <a href="aldehyde">aldehyde</a>s or <a href="ketone">ketone</a>s. Reaction with concentrated, hot <a href="potassium%20permanganate">KMnO</a> (or other oxidizing salts) in an acidic solution will yield <a href="ketone">ketone</a>s or <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a>s.

This reaction can be used to determine the position of a double bond in an unknown alkene.

The oxidation can be stopped at the <a href="vicinal%20%28chemistry%29">vicinal</a> <a href="diol">diol</a> rather than full cleavage of the alkene by using milder (dilute,lower temperature) KMnO or with <a href="osmium%20tetroxide">osmium tetroxide</a> or other oxidants.

In the presence of an appropriate <a href="photosensitiser">photosensitiser</a>, such as <a href="methylene%20blue">methylene blue</a> and light, alkenes can undergo reactions with reactive oxygen species generated by the photosensitiser, such as <a href="hydroxyl%20radical">hydroxyl radical</a>s, <a href="singlet%20oxygen">singlet oxygen</a> or <a href="superoxide">superoxide</a> ion. These reactive <a href="photochemical">photochemical</a> intermediates are generated in what are known as Type I, Type II, and Type III processes, respectively. These various alternative processes and reactions can be controlled by choice of specific reaction conditions, leading to a wide range of different products. A common example is the [4+2]-<a href="cycloaddition">cycloaddition</a> of singlet oxygen with a <a href="diene">diene</a> such as <a href="cyclopentadiene">cyclopentadiene</a> to yield an <a href="endoperoxide">endoperoxide</a>:

Another example is the <a href="Ene%20reaction%23Singlet-oxygen%20ene%20reaction">Schenck ene reaction</a>, in which singlet oxygen reacts with an <a href="allyl">allyl</a>ic structure to give a transposed allyl <a href="peroxide">peroxide</a>:

<a href="Polymerization">Polymerization</a> of alkenes is a reaction that yields <a href="polymer">polymer</a>s of high industrial value at great economy, such as the plastics <a href="polyethylene">polyethylene</a> and <a href="polypropylene">polypropylene</a>. Polymers from alkene <a href="monomer">monomer</a>s are referred to in a general way as "<a href="polyolefin">polyolefin</a>s" or in rare instances as "polyalkenes". A polymer from <a href="alpha-olefin">alpha-olefin</a>s is called a polyalphaolefin (PAO). Polymerization can proceed via either a free-<a href="Radical%20%28chemistry%29">radical</a> or an ionic mechanism, converting the double to a single bond and forming single bonds to join the other monomers. Polymerization of <a href="Conjugated%20system">conjugated</a> <a href="diene">diene</a>s such as <a href="buta-1%2C3-diene">buta-1,3-diene</a> or <a href="isoprene">isoprene</a> (2-methylbuta-1,3-diene) results in largely 1,4-addition with possibly some 1,2-addition of the diene monomer to a growing polymer chain.

Alkenes are <a href="ligand">ligand</a>s in <a href="transition%20metal%20alkene%20complex">transition metal alkene complex</a>es. The two carbon centres bond to the metal using the C–C pi- and pi*-orbitals. Mono- and diolefins are often used as ligands in stable complexes. <a href="Cyclooctadiene">Cyclooctadiene</a> and <a href="norbornadiene">norbornadiene</a> are popular chelating agents, and even <a href="ethylene">ethylene</a> itself is sometimes used as a ligand, for example, in <a href="Zeise%27s%20salt">Zeise's salt</a>. In addition, metal–alkene complexes are intermediates in many metal-catalyzed reactions including hydrogenation, hydroformylation, and polymerization.

Alkenes are produced by hydrocarbon <a href="cracking%20%28chemistry%29">cracking</a>. Raw materials are mostly <a href="natural%20gas%20condensate">natural gas condensate</a> components (principally ethane and propane) in the US and Mideast and <a href="naphtha">naphtha</a> in Europe and Asia. Alkanes are broken apart at high temperatures, often in the presence of a <a href="zeolite">zeolite</a> catalyst, to produce a mixture of primarily aliphatic alkenes and lower molecular weight alkanes. The mixture is feedstock and temperature dependent, and separated by fractional distillation. This is mainly used for the manufacture of small alkenes (up to six carbons).
Related to this is catalytic <a href="dehydrogenation">dehydrogenation</a>, where an alkane loses hydrogen at high temperatures to produce a corresponding alkene. This is the reverse of the <a href="catalytic%20hydrogenation">catalytic hydrogenation</a> of alkenes.

This process is also known as <a href="Catalytic%20reforming">reforming</a>. Both processes are endothermic and are driven towards the alkene at high temperatures by <a href="entropy">entropy</a>.

<a href="Catalytic">Catalytic</a> synthesis of higher α-alkenes (of the type RCH=CH) can also be achieved by a reaction of ethylene with the <a href="organometallic%20compound">organometallic compound</a> <a href="triethylaluminium">triethylaluminium</a> in the presence of <a href="nickel">nickel</a>, <a href="cobalt">cobalt</a>, or <a href="platinum">platinum</a>.

One of the principal methods for alkene synthesis in the laboratory is the room <a href="elimination%20reaction">elimination</a> of alkyl halides, alcohols, and similar compounds. Most common is the β-elimination via the E2 or E1 mechanism, but α-eliminations are also known.

The E2 mechanism provides a more reliable β-elimination method than E1 for most alkene syntheses. Most E2 eliminations start with an alkyl halide or alkyl sulfonate ester (such as a <a href="tosylate">tosylate</a> or <a href="triflate">triflate</a>). When an alkyl halide is used, the reaction is called a <a href="dehydrohalogenation">dehydrohalogenation</a>. For unsymmetrical products, the more substituted alkenes (those with fewer hydrogens attached to the C=C) tend to predominate (see <a href="Zaitsev%27s%20rule">Zaitsev's rule</a>). Two common methods of elimination reactions are dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides and dehydration of alcohols. A typical example is shown below; note that if possible, the H is "anti" to the leaving group, even though this leads to the less stable "Z"-isomer.

Alkenes can be synthesized from alcohols via <a href="Dehydration%20reaction">dehydration</a>, in which case water is lost via the E1 mechanism. For example, the dehydration of <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a> produces ethene:

An alcohol may also be converted to a better leaving group (e.g., <a href="xanthate">xanthate</a>), so as to allow a milder "syn"-elimination such as the <a href="Chugaev%20elimination">Chugaev elimination</a> and the <a href="Grieco%20elimination">Grieco elimination</a>. Related reactions include eliminations by β-haloethers (the <a href="Boord%20olefin%20synthesis">Boord olefin synthesis</a>) and esters (<a href="ester%20pyrolysis">ester pyrolysis</a>).

Alkenes can be prepared indirectly from alkyl <a href="amine">amine</a>s. The amine or ammonia is not a suitable leaving group, so the amine is first either <a href="alkylation">alkylated</a> (as in the <a href="Hofmann%20elimination">Hofmann elimination</a>) or oxidized to an <a href="amine%20oxide">amine oxide</a> (the <a href="Cope%20reaction">Cope reaction</a>) to render a smooth elimination possible. The Cope reaction is a "syn"-elimination that occurs at or below 150 °C, for example:

The Hofmann elimination is unusual in that the "less" substituted (non-<a href="Saytzeff%27s%20rule">Saytseff</a>) alkene is usually the major product.

Alkenes are generated from α-halo<a href="sulfone">sulfone</a>s in the <a href="Ramberg%E2%80%93B%C3%A4cklund%20reaction">Ramberg–Bäcklund reaction</a>, via a three-membered ring sulfone intermediate.

Another important method for alkene synthesis involves construction of a new carbon–carbon double bond by coupling of a carbonyl compound (such as an <a href="aldehyde">aldehyde</a> or <a href="ketone">ketone</a>) to a <a href="carbanion">carbanion</a> equivalent. Such reactions are sometimes called "olefinations". The most well-known of these methods is the <a href="Wittig%20reaction">Wittig reaction</a>, but other related methods are known.

The Wittig reaction involves reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with a <a href="Wittig%20reagent">Wittig reagent</a> (or phosphorane) of the type PhP=CHR to produce an alkene and <a href="Triphenylphosphine%20oxide">PhP=O</a>. The Wittig reagent is itself prepared easily from <a href="triphenylphosphine">triphenylphosphine</a> and an alkyl halide. The reaction is quite general and many functional groups are tolerated, even esters, as in this example:

Related to the Wittig reaction is the <a href="Peterson%20olefination">Peterson olefination</a>. This uses a less accessible silicon-based reagent in place of the phosphorane, but it allows for the selection of "E"- or "Z"-products. If an "E"-product is desired, another alternative is the <a href="Julia%20olefination">Julia olefination</a>, which uses the carbanion generated from a <a href="phenyl">phenyl</a> <a href="sulfone">sulfone</a>. The <a href="Takai%20olefination">Takai olefination</a> based on an organochromium intermediate also delivers E-products. A titanium compound, <a href="Tebbe%27s%20reagent">Tebbe's reagent</a>, is useful for the synthesis of methylene compounds; in this case, even esters and amides react.

A pair of carbonyl compounds can also be reductively coupled together (with reduction) to generate an alkene. Symmetrical alkenes can be prepared from a single aldehyde or ketone coupling with itself, using <a href="titanium">titanium</a> metal reduction (the <a href="McMurry%20reaction">McMurry reaction</a>). If two different ketones are to be coupled, a more complex, indirect method such as the <a href="Barton%E2%80%93Kellogg%20reaction">Barton–Kellogg reaction</a> may be used.

A single ketone can also be converted to the corresponding alkene via its tosylhydrazone, using <a href="sodium%20methoxide">sodium methoxide</a> (the <a href="Bamford%E2%80%93Stevens%20reaction">Bamford–Stevens reaction</a>) or an alkyllithium (the <a href="Shapiro%20reaction">Shapiro reaction</a>).

Alkenes can be prepared by exchange with other alkenes, in a reaction known as <a href="olefin%20metathesis">olefin metathesis</a>. Frequently, loss of ethene gas is used to drive the reaction towards a desired product. In many cases, a mixture of geometric isomers is obtained, but the reaction tolerates many functional groups. The method is particularly effective for the preparation of cyclic alkenes, as in this synthesis of <a href="muscone">muscone</a>:
Transition metal catalyzed hydrovinylation is another important alkene synthesis process starting from alkene itself. In general, it involves the addition of a hydrogen and a vinyl group (or an alkenyl group) across a double bond. The hydrovinylation reaction was first reported by Alderson, Jenner, and Lindsey by using rhodium and ruthenium salts, other metal catalysts commonly employed nowadays included iron, cobalt, nickel, and palladium. The addition can be done highly regio- and stereoselectively, the choices of metal centers, ligands, substrates and counterions often play very important role. Recent studies showed that the use of N-heterocyclic carbene with Ni can be useful for the selective preparations of functionalized geminal olefins or 1,1-disubstituted alkenes.

Reduction of <a href="alkyne">alkyne</a>s is a useful method for the <a href="stereoselectivity">stereoselective</a> synthesis of disubstituted alkenes. If the "cis"-alkene is desired, <a href="hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a> in the presence of <a href="Lindlar%27s%20catalyst">Lindlar's catalyst</a> (a heterogeneous catalyst that consists of palladium deposited on calcium carbonate and treated with various forms of lead) is commonly used, though hydroboration followed by hydrolysis provides an alternative approach. Reduction of the alkyne by <a href="sodium">sodium</a> metal in liquid <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> gives the "trans"-alkene.

For the preparation multisubstituted alkenes, <a href="carbometalation">carbometalation</a> of alkynes can give rise to a large variety of alkene derivatives.

Alkenes can be synthesized from other alkenes via <a href="rearrangement%20reaction">rearrangement reaction</a>s. Besides <a href="olefin%20metathesis">olefin metathesis</a> (described <a href="%23Olefin%20metathesis">above</a>), a large number of <a href="pericyclic%20reaction">pericyclic reaction</a>s can be used such as the <a href="ene%20reaction">ene reaction</a> and the <a href="Cope%20rearrangement">Cope rearrangement</a>.

In the <a href="Diels%E2%80%93Alder%20reaction">Diels–Alder reaction</a>, a <a href="cyclohexene">cyclohexene</a> derivative is prepared from a diene and a reactive or electron-deficient alkene.

Although the nomenclature is not followed widely, according to IUPAC, alkenes are acyclic hydrocarbons with one double bond between carbon centers. Olefins comprise a larger collection of cyclic and acyclic alkenes as well as dienes and polyenes.

To form the root of the <a href="IUPAC%20nomenclature">IUPAC</a> names for alkenes, simply change the "-an-" infix of the parent to "-en-". For example, CH-CH is the <a href="alkane">alkane</a> "ethANe". The name of CH=CH is therefore "ethENe".

In higher alkenes, where <a href="isomer">isomer</a>s exist that differ in location of the double bond, the following numbering system is used:

In the specific case of disubstituted alkenes where the two carbons have one substituent each, <a href="Cis-trans%20isomerism">"cis"–"trans"</a> notation may be used. If both substituents are on the same side of the bond, it is defined as "cis"-. If the substituents are on either side of the bond, it is defined as "trans"-.

When an alkene has more than one substituent (especially necessary with 3 or 4 substituents), the double bond geometry is described using the labels "E" and "Z". These labels come from the German words "entgegen", meaning "opposite", and "zusammen", meaning "together". Alkenes with the higher priority groups (as determined by <a href="Cahn-Ingold-Prelog%20priority%20rule">CIP rules</a>) on the same side of the double bond have these groups together and are designated "Z". Alkenes with the higher priority groups on opposite sides are designated "E". A mnemonic to remember this: "Z" notation has the higher priority groups on "ze zame zide."

IUPAC recognizes two names for hydrocarbon groups containing carbon–carbon double bonds, the <a href="vinyl%20group">vinyl group</a> and the <a href="allyl">allyl</a> group.

<doc id="2762" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2762" title="Allene">
Allene

An allene is a <a href="Chemical%20compound">compound</a> in which one <a href="carbon">carbon</a> atom has <a href="double%20bond">double bond</a>s with each of its two adjacent carbon centres. Allenes are classified as <a href="polyene">polyene</a>s with <a href="diene%23Classes">cumulated dienes</a>. The parent compound of allene is <a href="propadiene">propadiene</a>. Compounds with an allene-type structure but with more than three carbon atoms are called <a href="cumulene">cumulene</a>s. Allenes are much more reactive than most other <a href="alkene">alkene</a>s. For example, their reactivity with gaseous <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a> is more like the reactivity of <a href="alkyne">alkyne</a>s than that of alkenes.

The central carbon atom of allene forms two <a href="sigma%20bond">sigma bond</a>s and two <a href="pi%20bond">pi bond</a>s. The central carbon is <a href="Orbital%20hybridization%23sp%20hybrids">sp-hybridized</a>, and the two terminal carbon atoms are <a href="Orbital%20hybridization%23sp2%20hybrids">sp-hybridized</a>. The bond angle formed by the three carbon atoms is 180°, indicating linear geometry for the carbon atoms of allene. It can also be viewed as an "extended tetrahedral" with a similar shape to <a href="methane">methane</a>.

The symmetry and isomerism of allenes has long fascinated organic chemists. For allenes with four identical substituents, there exist two twofold axes of rotation through the center carbon, inclined at 45° to the CH planes at either end of the molecule. The molecule can thus be thought of as a two-bladed <a href="propeller">propeller</a>. A third twofold axis of rotation passes through the C=C=C bonds, and there is a mirror plane passing through both CH planes. Thus this class of molecules belong to the D <a href="point%20group">point group</a>. Because of the symmetry, an unsubstituted allene has no net <a href="Bond%20dipole%20moment">dipole moment</a>.

An allene with two different substituents on each of the two carbon atoms will be <a href="chirality%20%28chemistry%29">chiral</a> because there will no longer be any mirror planes. Where A has a greater priority than B according to the <a href="Cahn-Ingold-Prelog%20priority%20rule">Cahn-Ingold-Prelog priority rule</a>, the configuration of the <a href="axial%20chirality">axial chirality</a> can be determined by considering the substituents on the front atom followed by the back atom when viewed along the allene axis. For the bottom, only the group of higher priority need be considered. Chiral allenes have been recently used as building blocks in the construction of organic materials with exceptional chiroptical properties. 
Although allenes often require specialized syntheses, the parent, propadiene is produced on a large scale as an equilibrium mixture with <a href="methylacetylene">methylacetylene</a>:
This mixture, known as <a href="MAPP%20gas">MAPP gas</a>, is commercially available.

Laboratory methods for the formation of allenes include:

Allenes function as ligands, not unlike alkenes. A typical complex is Pt(<a href="hapticity">η</a>-allene)(PPh). Ni(0) reagents catalyze the cyclooligomerization of allene. Using a suitable catalyst (e.g. <a href="Wilkinson%27s%20catalyst">Wilkinson's catalyst</a>), it is possible to reduce just one of the double bonds of an allene.

Many rings or ring systems are known by semisystematic names that assume a maximum number of noncumulative bonds. To unambiguously specify derivatives that include cumulated bonds (and hence fewer hydrogens than would be expected from the skeleton), a lowercase delta may be used with a subscript indicating the number of cumulated double bonds from that atom, e.g. 8δ-Benzocyclononene. This may be combined with the λ-convention for specifying nonstandard valency states, e.g. 2λδ,5λδ-Thieno[3,4-c]thiophene.

<doc id="2763" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2763" title="Alkyne">
Alkyne

In <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic chemistry</a>, an alkyne is an <a href="Saturation%20%28chemistry%29">unsaturated</a> <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a> containing at least one carbon—carbon <a href="triple%20bond">triple bond</a>. The simplest acyclic alkynes with only one triple bond and no other <a href="functional%20group">functional group</a>s form a <a href="homologous%20series">homologous series</a> with the general chemical formula . Alkynes are traditionally known as acetylenes, although the name "acetylene" also refers specifically to CH, known formally as <a href="ethyne">ethyne</a> using <a href="IUPAC%20nomenclature%20of%20organic%20chemistry">IUPAC nomenclature</a>. Like other hydrocarbons, alkynes are generally hydrophobic but tend to be more reactive.

Alkynes are characteristically more <a href="Saturation%20%28chemistry%29">unsaturated</a> than alkenes. Thus they add two equivalents of <a href="bromine">bromine</a> whereas an alkene adds only one equivalent in the reaction. Other reactions are listed below. In some reactions, alkynes are less reactive than <a href="alkene">alkene</a>s. For example, in a molecule with an -ene and an -yne group, addition occurs preferentially at the -ene. Possible explanations involve the two π-bonds in the alkyne delocalising, which would reduce the energy of the π-system or the stability of the intermediates during the reaction.
They show greater tendency to <a href="Polymerization">polymerize</a> or <a href="oligomer">oligomer</a>ize than alkenes do. The resulting polymers, called <a href="polyacetylene">polyacetylene</a>s (which do not contain alkyne units) are <a href="conjugated%20system">conjugated</a> and can exhibit semiconducting properties.

In acetylene, the H–C≡C <a href="bond%20angle">bond angle</a>s are 180°. By virtue of this bond angle, alkynes are rod-like. Correspondingly, cyclic alkynes are rare. <a href="Benzyne">Benzyne</a> is highly unstable. The C≡C bond distance of 121 <a href="picometer">picometer</a>s is much shorter than the C=C distance in <a href="alkene">alkene</a>s (134 pm) or the C–C bond in alkanes (153 pm).

The <a href="triple%20bond">triple bond</a> is very strong with a <a href="bond%20strength">bond strength</a> of 839 kJ/mol. The sigma bond contributes 369 kJ/mol, the first pi bond contributes 268 kJ/mol and the second pi-bond of 202 kJ/mol bond strength. Bonding usually discussed in the context of <a href="molecular%20orbital%20theory">molecular orbital theory</a>, which recognizes the triple bond as arising from overlap of s and p orbitals. In the language of <a href="valence%20bond%20theory">valence bond theory</a>, the carbon atoms in an alkyne bond are <a href="sp%20hybridized">sp hybridized</a>: they each have two unhybridized <a href="p%20orbital">p orbital</a>s and two <a href="Orbital%20hybridisation">sp hybrid orbitals</a>. Overlap of an sp orbital from each atom forms one sp–sp <a href="sigma%20bond">sigma bond</a>. Each p orbital on one atom overlaps one on the other atom, forming two <a href="pi%20bond">pi bond</a>s, giving a total of three bonds. The remaining sp orbital on each atom can form a sigma bond to another atom, for example to hydrogen atoms in the parent acetylene. The two sp orbitals project on opposite sides of the carbon atom.

Internal alkynes feature carbon substituents on each acetylenic carbon. Symmetrical examples include <a href="diphenylacetylene">diphenylacetylene</a> and <a href="3-hexyne">3-hexyne</a>.

Terminal alkynes have the formula RCH. An example is <a href="methylacetylene">methylacetylene</a> (propyne using IUPAC nomenclature). Terminal alkynes, like <a href="acetylene">acetylene</a> itself, are mildly acidic, with p"K" values of around 25. They are far more acidic than alkenes and alkanes, which have p"K" values of around 40 and 50, respectively. The acidic hydrogen on terminal alkynes can be replaced by a variety of groups resulting in halo-, silyl-, and alkoxoalkynes. The <a href="carbanion">carbanion</a>s generated by deprotonation of terminal alkynes are called <a href="acetylide">acetylide</a>s.

In <a href="Chemical%20nomenclature">systematic chemical nomenclature</a>, alkynes are named with the Greek prefix system without any additional letters. Examples include ethyne or octyne. In parent chains with four or more carbons, it is necessary to say where the triple bond is located. For <a href="octyne">octyne</a>, one can either write 3-octyne or oct-3-yne when the bond starts at the third carbon. The lowest number possible is given to the <a href="triple%20bond">triple bond</a>. When no superior functional groups are present, the parent chain must include the triple bond even if it is not the longest possible carbon chain in the molecule. Ethyne is commonly called by its trivial name acetylene.

In chemistry, the <a href="affix">suffix</a> <a href="-yne">-yne</a> is used to denote the presence of a triple bond. In <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic chemistry</a>, the suffix often follows <a href="Chemical%20nomenclature">IUPAC nomenclature</a>. However, <a href="inorganic%20compound">inorganic compound</a>s featuring <a href="Saturation%20%28chemistry%29">unsaturation</a> in the form of triple bonds may be denoted by substitutive nomenclature with the same methods used with alkynes (i.e. the name of the corresponding saturated compound is modified by replacing the "<a href="-ane">-ane</a>" ending with "-yne"). <a href="Polyyne">"-diyne"</a> is used when there are two triple bonds, and so on. The position of unsaturation is indicated by a numerical <a href="locant">locant</a> immediately preceding the "-yne" suffix, or 'locants' in the case of multiple triple bonds. Locants are chosen so that the numbers are low as possible. "-yne" is also used as an <a href="infix">infix</a> to name substituent groups that are triply bound to the parent compound.

Sometimes a number between <a href="hyphen">hyphen</a>s is inserted before it to state which atoms the triple bond is between. This suffix arose as a collapsed form of the end of the word "<a href="acetylene">acetylene</a>". The final "-e" disappears if it is followed by another suffix that starts with a vowel.

Commercially, the dominant alkyne is acetylene itself, which is used as a fuel and a precursor to other compounds, e.g., <a href="acrylate">acrylate</a>s. Hundreds of millions of kilograms are produced annually by partial oxidation of <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a>:
Propyne, also industrially useful, is also prepared by <a href="thermal%20cracking">thermal cracking</a> of hydrocarbons. Most other industrially useful alkyne derivatives are prepared from acetylene, e.g. via condensation with formaldehyde.

Specialty alkynes are prepared by <a href="dehydrohalogenation">dehydrohalogenation</a> of <a href="Vicinal%20%28chemistry%29">vicinal</a> alkyl <a href="Halide">dihalides</a> or vinyl halides. Metal acetylides can be coupled with primary <a href="alkyl%20halide">alkyl halide</a>s. Via the <a href="Fritsch%E2%80%93Buttenberg%E2%80%93Wiechell%20rearrangement">Fritsch–Buttenberg–Wiechell rearrangement</a>, alkynes are prepared from <a href="vinyl%20bromide">vinyl bromide</a>s. Alkynes can be prepared from <a href="aldehyde">aldehyde</a>s using the <a href="Corey%E2%80%93Fuchs%20reaction">Corey–Fuchs reaction</a> and from aldehydes or <a href="ketone">ketone</a>s by the <a href="Seyferth%E2%80%93Gilbert%20homologation">Seyferth–Gilbert homologation</a>. In the <a href="alkyne%20zipper%20reaction">alkyne zipper reaction</a>, alkynes are generated from other alkynes by treatment with a strong base.

Featuring a reactive <a href="functional%20group">functional group</a>, alkynes participate in many <a href="organic%20reaction">organic reaction</a>s.

Alkynes characteristically undergo reactions that show that they are "doubly unsaturated", meaning that each alkyne unit is capable of adding two equivalents of H, <a href="halogen">halogen</a>s or related HX reagents (X = halide, pseudohalide, etc.). Depending on catalysts and conditions, alkynes add one or two equivalents of hydrogen. Partial <a href="hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a>, stopping after the addition of only one equivalent to give the <a href="alkene">alkene</a>, is usually more desirable since alkanes are less useful:
The largest scale application of this technology is the conversion of acetylene to ethylene in refineries. The steam cracking of alkanes yields a few percent acetylene, which is selectively hydrogenated in the presence of a <a href="palladium">palladium</a>/<a href="silver">silver</a> catalyst. For more complex alkynes, the <a href="Lindlar%20catalyst">Lindlar catalyst</a> is widely recommended to avoid formation of the alkane, for example in the conversion of <a href="phenylacetylene">phenylacetylene</a> to <a href="styrene">styrene</a>.

Similarly, <a href="halogenation">halogenation</a> of alkynes gives the vinyl dihalides or alkyl tetrahalides:

The addition of nonpolar E–H bonds across C≡C is general for silanes, boranes, and related hydrides. The <a href="hydroboration-oxidation%20reaction">hydroboration</a> of alkynes gives vinylic boranes which oxidize to the corresponding <a href="aldehyde">aldehyde</a> or ketone. In the <a href="thiol-yne%20reaction">thiol-yne reaction</a> the substrate is a thiol.

Acid-promoted addition reactions are likewise analogous to those of alkenes, including <a href="Markovnikov%27s%20rule">Markovnikov</a> selectivity. <a href="Hydrohalogenation">Hydrohalogenation</a> gives the corresponding <a href="vinyl%20halide">vinyl halide</a>s or alkyl dihalides, again depending on the number of equivalents of HX added. The <a href="hydration%20reaction">hydration reaction</a> gives an <a href="enol">enol</a> via the addition of one equivalent of water, a structure that <a href="Keto%E2%80%93enol%20tautomerism">tautomerize</a>s to form a ketone or aldehyde. For example, the hydration of <a href="phenylacetylene">phenylacetylene</a> gives <a href="acetophenone">acetophenone</a>, and the (PhP)AuCH-catalyzed hydration of 1,8-nonadiyne to 2,8-nonanedione:

Alkynes undergo diverse <a href="cycloaddition">cycloaddition</a> reactions. Most notable is the <a href="Diels%E2%80%93Alder%20reaction">Diels–Alder reaction</a> with 1,3-<a href="diene">diene</a>s to give <a href="1%2C4-cyclohexadienes">1,4-cyclohexadienes</a>. This general reaction has been extensively developed and electrophilic alkynes are especially effective <a href="dienophile">dienophile</a>s. The "cycloadduct" derived from the addition of alkynes to <a href="2-pyrone">2-pyrone</a> eliminates <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> to give the <a href="aromatic">aromatic</a> compound. Other specialized cycloadditions include multicomponent reactions such as <a href="alkyne%20trimerisation">alkyne trimerisation</a> to give <a href="aromatic">aromatic</a> compounds and the [2+2+1]-cycloaddition of an alkyne, <a href="alkene">alkene</a> and <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> in the <a href="Pauson%E2%80%93Khand%20reaction">Pauson–Khand reaction</a>. Non-carbon reagents also undergo cyclization, e.g. <a href="Azide%20alkyne%20Huisgen%20cycloaddition">Azide alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition</a> to give <a href="triazole">triazole</a>s. Cycloaddition processes involving alkynes are often catalyzed by metals, e.g. <a href="enyne%20metathesis">enyne metathesis</a> and <a href="alkyne%20metathesis">alkyne metathesis</a>, which allows the scrambling of carbyne (RC) centers:
Oxidative cleavage of alkynes proceeds via cycloaddition to metal oxides. Most famously, <a href="potassium%20permanganate">potassium permanganate</a> converts alkynes to a pair of <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a>s.

In addition to undergoing the reactions characteristic of internal alkynes, terminal alkynes are reactive as weak acids, with <a href="Acid%20dissociation%20constant">p"K"</a> values (25) between that of <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> (35) and <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a> (16). The acetylide <a href="conjugate%20base">conjugate base</a> is stabilized as a result of the high s character of the sp orbital, in which the electron pair resides. <a href="Electron">Electron</a>s in an s orbital benefit from closer proximity to the positively charged atom nucleus, and are therefore lower in energy. Treatment of terminal alkynes with a <a href="strong%20base">strong base</a> gives the corresponding <a href="metal%20acetylide">metal acetylide</a>s:
The reactions of alkynes with certain metal cations, e.g. Ag also gives acetylides. Thus, few drops of <a href="Tollens%20reagent">diamminesilver(I) hydroxide</a> (Ag(NH)OH) reacts with terminal alkynes signaled by formation of a white precipitate of the silver acetylide.
Acetylide derivatives are synthetically useful <a href="nucleophile">nucleophile</a>s that participate in C–C bond forming reactions, as illustrated in the area called <a href="Carbonylation">"Reppe Chemistry"</a>.

In the <a href="Favorskii%20reaction">Favorskii reaction</a> and in <a href="alkynylation">alkynylation</a>s in general, terminal alkynes add to <a href="carbonyl">carbonyl</a> compounds to give the <a href="hydroxyalkyne">hydroxyalkyne</a>. <a href="Coupling%20reaction">Coupling</a> of terminal alkynes to give dialkynes is effected in the <a href="Cadiot%E2%80%93Chodkiewicz%20coupling">Cadiot–Chodkiewicz coupling</a>, <a href="Glaser%20coupling">Glaser coupling</a>, and the <a href="Eglinton%20coupling">Eglinton coupling</a> reactions. Terminal alkynes can also be coupled to aryl or vinyl halides as in the <a href="Sonogashira%20coupling">Sonogashira coupling</a>.

Terminal alkynes, including acetylene itself, can react with water to give aldehydes. The transformation typically requires special metal catalysts to give this anti-Markovnikov addition result.

Alkynes form complexes with transition metals. Such compounds are sometimes useful reagents or illustrate the role that metals play in catalytic transformations of alkynes.

According to Ferdinand Bohlmann, the first naturally occurring acetylenic compound, dehydromatricaria ester, was isolated from an "Artemisia" species in 1826. In the nearly two centuries that have followed, well over a thousand naturally occurring acetylenes have been discovered and reported. Polyynes, a subset of this class of natural products, have been isolated from a wide variety of plant species, cultures of higher fungi, bacteria, marine sponges, and corals. Some acids like <a href="tariric%20acid">tariric acid</a> contains an alkyne group. Diynes and triynes, species with the linkage RC≡C–C≡CR′ and RC≡C–C≡C–C≡CR′ respectively, occur in certain plants ("<a href="Ichthyothere">Ichthyothere</a>", "<a href="Chrysanthemum">Chrysanthemum</a>", "<a href="Cicuta">Cicuta</a>", "<a href="Water%20dropwort">Oenanthe</a>" and other members of the <a href="Asteraceae">Asteraceae</a> and <a href="Apiaceae">Apiaceae</a> families). Some examples are <a href="cicutoxin">cicutoxin</a>, <a href="oenanthotoxin">oenanthotoxin</a>, <a href="falcarinol">falcarinol</a> and <a href="carotatoxin">carotatoxin</a>. These compounds are highly bioactive, e.g. as <a href="nematocide">nematocide</a>s. 1-Phenylhepta-1,3,5-triyne is illustrative of a naturally occurring triyne.

Alkynes occur in some pharmaceuticals, including the contraceptive <a href="noretynodrel">noretynodrel</a>. A carbon–carbon triple bond is also present in marketed drugs such as the antiretroviral <a href="Efavirenz">Efavirenz</a> and the antifungal <a href="Terbinafine">Terbinafine</a>. Molecules called ene-diynes feature a ring containing an alkene ("ene") between two alkyne groups ("diyne"). These compounds, e.g. <a href="calicheamicin">calicheamicin</a>, are some of the most aggressive antitumor drugs known, so much so that the ene-diyne subunit is sometimes referred to as a "warhead". Ene-diynes undergo rearrangement via the <a href="Bergman%20cyclization">Bergman cyclization</a>, generating highly reactive radical intermediates that attack DNA within the tumor.

AbiWord

AbiWord () is a <a href="free%20and%20open-source%20software">free and open-source software</a> <a href="word%20processor">word processor</a> written in <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a>. Since version 3 it is based on <a href="GTK%2B">GTK+</a> 3. The name "AbiWord" is derived from the root of the Spanish word ""<a href="wikt%3Aen%3Aabierto%23Spanish">abierto</a>"", meaning "open".

AbiWord was originally started by SourceGear Corporation as the first part of a proposed AbiSuite but was adopted by open source developers after SourceGear changed its business focus and ceased development. It now runs on <a href="Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> (Last 2.8.6, 2.9.4 beta ), <a href="ReactOS">ReactOS</a>, Solaris, <a href="AmigaOS">AmigaOS</a> 4.0 (through its <a href="Cygnix">Cygnix</a> <a href="X%20Window%20System">X11</a> engine), <a href="MeeGo">MeeGo</a> (on the <a href="Nokia%20N9">Nokia N9</a> smartphone), <a href="Maemo">Maemo</a> (on the <a href="Nokia%20N810">Nokia N810</a>) <a href="QNX">QNX</a> and other <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>s.

The <a href="macOS">macOS</a> port has remained on version 2.4 since 2005, although the current version does run non-natively on macOS through <a href="XQuartz">XQuartz</a>.

AbiWord is part of the AbiSource project which develops a number of <a href="office%20suite">office-related</a> technologies.

The software is available on <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> devices as part of the "Debian noroot" package from the Google <a href="Google%20Play%23Android%20applications">Play Store</a>.

AbiWord supports both basic word processing features such as lists, indents and character formats, and more sophisticated features including tables, styles, page headers and footers, <a href="Note%20%28typography%29">footnotes</a>, templates, multiple views, page columns, <a href="spell%20checker">spell checking</a>, and <a href="grammar%20checker">grammar checking</a>. Starting with version 2.8.0, AbiWord includes a <a href="collaborative%20software">collaboration</a> plugin that allows integration with AbiCollab.net, a Web-based service that permits multiple users to work on the same document <a href="Collaborative%20real-time%20editor">in real time</a>, in full synchronization. The Presentation view of AbiWord, which permits easy display of presentations created in AbiWord on "screen-sized" pages, is another feature not often found in word processors.

AbiWord generally works similarly to classic versions (pre-Office 2007) of <a href="Microsoft%20Word">Microsoft Word</a>, as direct ease of migration was a high priority early goal. While many interface similarities remain, cloning the Word interface is no longer a top priority. The interface is intended to follow user interface guidelines for each respective platform.

AbiWord comes with several import and export filters providing a partial support for such formats as <a href="HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="Microsoft%20Word">Microsoft Word</a> (.doc), <a href="Office%20Open%20XML">Office Open XML</a> (.docx), <a href="OpenDocument">OpenDocument Text</a> (.odt), <a href="Rich%20Text%20Format">Rich Text Format</a> (.rtf), and <a href="Plain%20text">text document</a>s (.txt). <a href="LaTeX">LaTeX</a> is supported for export only. Plug-in filters are available to deal with many other formats, notably <a href="WordPerfect">WordPerfect</a> documents. The native <a href="file%20format">file format</a>, .abw, uses <a href="XML">XML</a>, so as to mitigate <a href="vendor%20lock-in">vendor lock-in</a> concerns with respect to interoperability and <a href="digital%20archiving">digital archiving</a>.

The AbiWord project includes a US English-only grammar checking plugin using <a href="Link%20Grammar">Link Grammar</a>. AbiWord had grammar checking before any other open source word processor, although a grammar checker was later added to <a href="OpenOffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>. Link Grammar is both a theory of syntax and an open source parser which is now developed by the AbiWord project.

<doc id="2766" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2766" title="Ames test">
Ames test

The Ames test is a widely employed method that uses <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> to test whether a given chemical can cause <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s in the <a href="DNA">DNA</a> of the test organism. More formally, it is a <a href="bioassay">biological assay</a> to assess the <a href="mutagenic">mutagenic</a> potential of chemical compounds. A positive test indicates that the chemical is mutagenic and therefore may act as a <a href="carcinogen">carcinogen</a>, because cancer is often linked to <a href="mutation">mutation</a>. The test serves as a quick and convenient assay to estimate the carcinogenic potential of a compound because standard carcinogen assays on mice and rats are time-consuming (taking two to three years to complete) and expensive. However, false-positives and false-negatives are known.

The procedure was described in a series of papers in the early 1970s by <a href="Bruce%20Ames">Bruce Ames</a> and his group at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>.

The Ames test uses several strains of the bacterium "<a href="Salmonella%20typhimurium">Salmonella typhimurium</a>" that carry mutations in genes involved in <a href="histidine">histidine</a> synthesis. These strains are <a href="auxotrophy">auxotrophic</a> mutants, i.e. they require histidine for growth, but cannot produce it. The method tests the capability of the tested substance in creating mutations that result in a return to a "prototrophic" state, so that the cells can grow on a histidine-free medium.

The tester strains are specially constructed to detect either <a href="Translational%20frameshift">frameshift</a> (e.g. strains TA-1537 and TA-1538) or <a href="point%20mutation">point</a> (e.g. strain TA-1531) <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s in the genes required to synthesize histidine, so that mutagens acting via different mechanisms may be identified. Some compounds are quite specific, causing reversions in just one or two strains. The tester strains also carry mutations in the genes responsible for <a href="lipopolysaccharide">lipopolysaccharide</a> synthesis, making the <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a> of the bacteria more permeable, and in the <a href="Nucleotide%20excision%20repair">excision repair system</a> to make the test more sensitive. Rat liver extract is optionally added to simulate the effect of <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>, as some compounds, like <a href="benzo%28a%29pyrene">benzo["a"]pyrene</a>, are not mutagenic themselves but their metabolic products are.

The bacteria are spread on an <a href="agar">agar</a> plate with small amount of histidine. This small amount of histidine in the growth medium allows the bacteria to grow for an initial time and have the opportunity to mutate.
When the histidine is depleted only bacteria that have mutated to gain the ability to produce its own histidine will survive. The plate is incubated for 48 hours. The mutagenicity of a substance is proportional to the number of colonies observed.

Mutagens identified via Ames test are also possible carcinogens, and early studies by Ames showed that 90% of known carcinogens may be identified via this test. Later studies however showed identification of 50–70% of known carcinogens. The test was used to identify a number of compounds previously used in commercial products as potential carcinogens. Examples include <a href="tris%282%2C3-dibromopropyl%29phosphate">tris(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate</a>, which was used as a flame retardant in plastic and textiles such as children's sleepwear, and <a href="furylfuramide">furylfuramide</a> which was used as an antibacterial additive in food in Japan in 1960s and 1970s. Furylfuramide in fact had previously passed animal test, but more vigorous tests after its identification in the Ames test showed it to be carcinogenic. Their positive tests resulted in those chemicals being withdrawn from use in consumer products.

One interesting result from the Ames test is that the dose response curve using varying concentrations of chemical is almost always linear, indicating that there is no threshold concentration for mutagenesis. It therefore suggests that, as with radiations, there may be <a href="Linear%20no-threshold%20model">no safe threshold</a> for chemical mutagens or carcinogens. However some proposed that organisms can tolerate low level of mutagens due to protective mechanisms such as <a href="DNA%20repair">DNA repair</a>, and threshold may exist for certain chemical mutagens. Bruce Ames himself argued against linear dose-response extrapolation from the high dose used in carcinogenesis tests in animal systems to the lower dose of chemicals normally encountered in human exposure, as the results may be false positives due to <a href="mitogenic">mitogenic</a> response caused by the artificially high dose of chemicals used in such tests. He also cautioned against the "hysteria over tiny traces of chemicals that may or may not cause cancer", that "completely drives out the major risks you should be aware of."

The Ames test is often used as one of the initial screens for potential drugs to weed out possible carcinogens, and it is one of the eight tests required under the <a href="Federal%20Insecticide%2C%20Fungicide%2C%20and%20Rodenticide%20Act">Pesticide Act</a> (USA) and one of six tests required under the <a href="Toxic%20Substances%20Control%20Act%20of%201976">Toxic Substances Control Act</a> (USA).

"Salmonella typhimurium" is a prokaryote, therefore it is not a perfect model for humans. Rat liver <a href="S9%20fraction">S9 fraction</a> is used to mimic the mammalian metabolic conditions so that the mutagenic potential of metabolites formed by a parent molecule in the hepatic system can be assessed; however, there are differences in metabolism between human and rat that can affect the mutagenicity of chemicals being tested. The test may therefore be improved by the use of human liver S9 fraction; its use was previously limited by its availability, but it is now available commercially and therefore may be more feasible. An adapted "in vitro" model has been made for eukaryotic cells, for example yeast.

Mutagens identified in the Ames test need not necessarily be carcinogenic, and further tests are required for any potential carcinogen identified in the test. Drugs that contain the nitrate moiety sometimes come back positive for Ames when they are indeed safe. The nitrate compounds may generate <a href="nitric%20oxide">nitric oxide</a>, an important signal molecule that can give a false positive. <a href="Nitroglycerin">Nitroglycerin</a> is an example that gives a positive Ames yet is still used in treatment today. Nitrates in food however may be reduced by bacterial action to nitrites which are known to generate carcinogens by reacting with amines and amides. Long toxicology and outcome studies are needed with such compounds to disprove a positive Ames test.

The Ames test was initially developed using agar plates (the plate incorporation technique), as described above. Since that time, a popular alternative to performing the Ames test has been developed, which is known as the "fluctuation method". This technique is the same in concept as the agar-based method, with bacteria being added to a reaction mixture with a small amount of <a href="histidine">histidine</a>, which allows the bacteria to grow and mutate, returning to synthesize their own histidine. By including a pH indicator, the frequency of mutation is counted in microplates as the number of wells which have changed color (caused by a drop in pH due to metabolic processes of reproducing bacteria). As with the traditional Ames test, the sample is compared to the natural background rate of reverse mutation in order to establish the genotoxicity of a substance.The fluctuation method is performed entirely in liquid culture and is scored by counting the number of wells that turn yellow from purple in 96-well or 384-well microplates. 
In the 96-well plate method the frequency of mutation is counted as the number of wells out of 96 which have changed color. The plates are incubated for up to five days, with mutated (yellow) colonies being counted each day and compared to the background rate of reverse mutation using established tables of significance to determine the significant differences between the background rate of mutation and that for the tested samples.

In the more scaled-down 384-well plate microfluctuation method the frequency of mutation is counted as the number of wells out of 48 which have changed color after 2 days of incubation. A test sample is assayed across 6 dose levels with concurrent zero-dose (background) and positive controls which all fit into one 384-well plate. The assay is performed in triplicates to provide statistical robustness. It uses the recommended OECD Guideline 471 tester strains (histidine auxotrophs and tryptophan auxotrophs).

The fluctuation method is comparable to the traditional pour plate method in terms of sensitivity and accuracy, however, it does have a number of advantages: it needs less test sample, it has a simple colorimetric endpoint, counting the number of positive wells out of possible 96 or 48 wells is much less time consuming than counting individual colonies on an agar plate. Several commercial kits are available. Most kits have consumable components in a ready-to-use state, including lyophilized bacteria, and tests can be performed using multichannel pipettes. The fluctuation method also allows for testing higher volumes of aqueous samples (up to 75% v/v), increasing the sensitivity and extending its application to low-level environmental mutagens.

<doc id="2767" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2767" title="ACE inhibitor">
ACE inhibitor

An angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor) is a <a href="pharmaceutical%20drug">pharmaceutical drug</a> used primarily for the treatment of <a href="hypertension">hypertension</a> (elevated blood pressure) and <a href="congestive%20heart%20failure">congestive heart failure</a>.

This group of drugs causes relaxation of blood vessels as well as a decrease in <a href="blood%20volume">blood volume</a>, which leads to lower <a href="blood%20pressure">blood pressure</a> and decreased oxygen demand from the <a href="heart">heart</a>. They <a href="Enzyme%20inhibitor">inhibit</a> the <a href="angiotensin-converting%20enzyme">angiotensin-converting enzyme</a>, an important component of the <a href="renin%E2%80%93angiotensin%20system">renin–angiotensin system</a>.

Frequently prescribed ACE inhibitors include <a href="benazepril">benazepril</a>, <a href="zofenopril">zofenopril</a>, <a href="perindopril">perindopril</a>, <a href="trandolapril">trandolapril</a>, <a href="captopril">captopril</a>, <a href="enalapril">enalapril</a>, <a href="lisinopril">lisinopril</a>, and <a href="ramipril">ramipril</a>.

ACE inhibitors were initially approved for the treatment of hypertension and can be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive medications. Later, they were found useful for other cardiovascular and kidney diseases including:

In treating heart disease, ACE inhibitors are usually used with other medications. A typical treatment plan often includes an ACE inhibitor, a <a href="beta%20blocker">beta blocker</a>, a long-acting <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>, and a <a href="calcium%20channel%20blocker">calcium channel blocker</a>, in combinations that are adjusted to the individual patient's needs. There are fixed-dose <a href="combination%20drugs">combination drugs</a>, such as <a href="ACE%20inhibitor%20and%20thiazide%20combination">ACE inhibitor and thiazide combination</a>s.

ACE inhibitors have also been used in <a href="chronic%20kidney%20failure">chronic kidney failure</a> and kidney involvement in <a href="systemic%20sclerosis">systemic sclerosis</a> (hardening of tissues, as scleroderma renal crisis).

In those with stable coronary artery disease but no heart failure benefits are similar to other usual treatments.

ACE inhibitors may also be used to help decrease excessive water consumption in people with <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a> resulting in <a href="psychogenic%20polydipsia">psychogenic polydipsia</a>. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that when used for this purpose, <a href="enalapril">enalapril</a> lead to decreased consumption (determined by urine output and osmality) in 60% of people; the same effect has been demonstrated in other ACE inhibitors.

ACE inhibitors reduce the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) as the primary etiologic (causal) event in the development of hypertension in people with diabetes mellitus, as part of the insulin-resistance syndrome or as a manifestation of renal disease.

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is a major blood pressure regulating mechanism. Markers of electrolyte and water imbalance in the body such as <a href="hypotension">hypotension</a>, low <a href="Distal%20convoluted%20tubule">distal tubule</a> <a href="sodium">sodium</a> concentration, decreased blood volume and high <a href="sympathetic%20nervous%20system">sympathetic</a> tone trigger the release of the enzyme <a href="renin">renin</a> from the cells of <a href="juxtaglomerular%20apparatus">juxtaglomerular apparatus</a> in the kidney. Renin activates a circulating liver derived prohormone <a href="angiotensin">angiotensin</a>ogen by proteolytic cleavage of all but its first ten <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> residues known as <a href="angiotensin%20I">angiotensin I</a>. <a href="Angiotensin%20converting%20enzyme">ACE</a> (Angiotensin converting enzyme) then removes a further two residues, converting angiotensin I into <a href="angiotensin%20II">angiotensin II</a>. <a href="Angiotensin%20converting%20enzyme">ACE</a> is found in the <a href="pulmonary%20circulation">pulmonary circulation</a> and in the <a href="endothelium">endothelium</a> of many blood vessels. The system increases blood pressure by increasing the amount of salt and water the body retains, although angiotensin is also very good at causing the blood vessels to tighten (a potent <a href="vasoconstrictor">vasoconstrictor</a>).

ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I (AI) to angiotensin II (AII). They thereby lower <a href="arteriole">arteriolar</a> resistance and increase venous capacity; decrease <a href="cardiac%20output">cardiac output</a>, <a href="cardiac%20index">cardiac index</a>, stroke work, and <a href="stroke%20volume">volume</a>; lower resistance in blood vessels in the kidneys; and lead to increased <a href="natriuresis">natriuresis</a> (excretion of sodium in the urine).
Renin increases in concentration in the blood as a result of negative feedback of conversion of AI to AII. AI increases for the same reason; AII and aldosterone decrease. <a href="Bradykinin">Bradykinin</a> increases because of less inactivation by ACE.

Under normal conditions, angiotensin II has these effects:

With ACE inhibitor use, the production of AII is decreased, leading to decreased blood pressure.

<a href="Epidemiology">Epidemiological</a> and clinical studies have shown ACE inhibitors reduce the progress of <a href="diabetic%20nephropathy">diabetic nephropathy</a> independently from their blood pressure-lowering effect. This action of ACE inhibitors is used in the prevention of diabetic <a href="renal%20failure">renal failure</a>.

ACE inhibitors have been shown to be effective for indications other than hypertension even in patients with normal blood pressure. The use of a maximum dose of ACE inhibitors in such patients (including for prevention of diabetic nephropathy, congestive heart failure, and prophylaxis of cardiovascular events) is justified, because it improves clinical outcomes independently of the blood pressure-lowering effect of ACE inhibitors. Such therapy, of course, requires careful and gradual titration of the dose to prevent the effects of rapidly decreasing blood pressure (dizziness, fainting, etc.).

ACE inhibitors have also been shown to cause a central enhancement of <a href="parasympathetic%20nervous%20system">parasympathetic nervous system</a> activity in healthy volunteers and patients with heart failure. This action may reduce the prevalence of malignant cardiac arrhythmias, and the reduction in sudden death reported in large clinical trials.
ACE Inhibitors also reduce plasma <a href="norepinephrine">norepinephrine</a> levels, and its resulting vasoconstriction effects, in heart failure patients, thus breaking the vicious circles of <a href="sympathetic%20nervous%20system">sympathetic</a> and renin angiotensin system activation, which sustains the downward spiral in cardiac function in congestive heart failure

The ACE inhibitor <a href="enalapril">enalapril</a> has also been shown to reduce cardiac <a href="cachexia">cachexia</a> in patients with chronic heart failure. Cachexia is a poor prognostic sign in patients with chronic heart failure.
ACE inhibitors are under early investigation for the treatment of frailty and muscle wasting (sarcopenia) in elderly patients without heart failure.

Common <a href="adverse%20drug%20reaction">adverse drug reaction</a>s include: hypotension, <a href="cough">cough</a>, <a href="hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</a>, <a href="headache">headache</a>, <a href="Vertigo%20%28medical%29">dizziness</a>, <a href="Fatigue%20%28physical%29">fatigue</a>, <a href="nausea">nausea</a>, and <a href="kidney">renal</a> impairment. ACE inhibitors might increase <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a>-related <a href="pain">pain</a>, perhaps mediated by the buildup of <a href="bradykinin">bradykinin</a> that accompanies ACE inhibition.
The main adverse effects of ACE inhibition can be understood from their pharmacological action. The other reported adverse effects are hepatotoxicity and effect on the fetus.
Renal impairment is a significant potential adverse effect of all ACE inhibitors that directly follows from their mechanism of action. Patients starting on an ACE inhibitor usually have a modest reduction in <a href="glomerular%20filtration%20rate">glomerular filtration rate</a> (GFR) that stabilizes after several days. However, the decrease may be significant in conditions of decreased renal perfusion, such as renal artery stenosis, heart failure, polycystic kidney disease, or volume depletion. In these patients, maintenance of GFR depends on angiotensin-II-dependent efferent vasomotor tone. Therefore, <a href="renal%20function">renal function</a> should be closely monitored over the first few days after initiation of treatment with ACE inhibitor in patients with decreased renal perfusion. A moderate reduction in renal function, no greater than 30% rise in serum creatinine, that is stabilized after a week of treatment is deemed acceptable as part of the therapeutic effect, providing the residual renal function is sufficient. This is especially a problem if the patient is concomitantly taking an <a href="Non-steroidal%20anti-inflammatory%20drug">NSAID</a> and a <a href="diuretic">diuretic</a>. When the three drugs are taken together, the risk of developing renal failure is significantly increased.

<a href="Hyperkalemia">Hyperkalemia</a> (high concentration of potassium in the blood) is another possible complication of treatment with an ACE inhibitor due to its effect on aldosterone. Suppression of angiotensin II leads to a decrease in aldosterone levels. Since aldosterone is responsible for increasing the excretion of potassium, ACE inhibitors can cause retention of potassium. Some people, however, can continue to lose potassium while on an ACE inhibitor. Hyperkalemia may decrease the velocity of impulse conduction in the nerves and muscles, including cardiac tissues. This leads to cardiac dysfunction and neuromuscular consequences, such as muscle weakness, paresthesia, nausea, diarrhea, and others. Close monitoring of potassium levels is required in patients receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors who are at risk of hyperkalemia.

Another possible adverse effect specific for ACE inhibitors, but not for other RAAS blockers, is an increase in <a href="bradykinin">bradykinin</a> level. Elevated bradykinin level due to ACE inhibition can be a cause of dry cough, angioedema and/or rash, hypotension, and inflammation-related pain.

A persistent dry cough is a relatively common adverse effect believed to be associated with the increases in bradykinin levels produced by ACE inhibitors, although the role of bradykinin in producing these symptoms has been disputed. Patients who experience this cough are often switched to <a href="angiotensin%20II%20receptor%20antagonist">angiotensin II receptor antagonist</a>s.

Some patients develop <a href="angioedema">angioedema</a> due to increased bradykinin levels. A genetic predisposition may exist toward this adverse effect in patients who degrade bradykinin more slowly than average.

Rash and taste disturbances, infrequent with most ACE inhibitors, are more prevalent in <a href="captopril">captopril</a>, and this is attributed to its sulfhydryl moiety. This has led to decreased use of captopril in clinical setting, although it is still used in <a href="scintigraphy">scintigraphy</a> of the kidney.

A severe rare allergic reaction can affect the bowel wall and secondarily cause abdominal pain.

Hematologic effects, such as neutropenia, agranulocytosis and other blood dyscrasias, have occurred during therapy with ACE inhibitors, especially in patients with additional risk factors (see Warnings). Patients should be advised to report symptoms such as sore throat or fever to their physician.

In pregnant women, ACE inhibitors taken during all the trimesters have been reported to cause <a href="congenital%20malformations">congenital malformations</a>, <a href="stillbirth">stillbirth</a>s, and <a href="neonatal%20death">neonatal death</a>s. Commonly reported fetal abnormalities include <a href="hypotension">hypotension</a>, <a href="renal%20dysplasia">renal dysplasia</a>, anuria/oliguria, <a href="oligohydramnios">oligohydramnios</a>, <a href="intrauterine%20growth%20retardation">intrauterine growth retardation</a>, <a href="pulmonary%20hypoplasia">pulmonary hypoplasia</a>, <a href="patent%20ductus%20arteriosus">patent ductus arteriosus</a>, and incomplete ossification of the skull. Overall, about half of newborns exposed to ACE inhibitors are adversely affected.

Symptoms and Treatment: There are few reports of ACE inhibitor overdose in the literature. The most likely manifestations are hypotension, which may be severe, hyperkalemia, hyponatremia and renal impairment with metabolic acidosis. Treatment should be mainly symptomatic and supportive, with volume expansion using normal saline to correct hypotension and improve renal function, and gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal and a cathartic to prevent further absorption of the drug. Captopril, enalapril, lisinopril and perindopril are known to be removable by hemodialysis.

The ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with:

ACE inhibitors should be used with caution in patients with:

ACE inhibitors are <a href="Australian%20Drug%20Evaluation%20Committee">ADEC</a> <a href="pregnancy%20category">pregnancy category</a> D, and should be avoided in women who are likely to become pregnant. In the U.S., ACE inhibitors must be labeled with a <a href="boxed%20warning">boxed warning</a> concerning the risk of birth defects when taken during the second and third trimester. Their use in the first trimester is also associated with a risk of major <a href="congenital%20malformation">congenital malformation</a>s, particularly affecting the <a href="Circulatory%20system">cardiovascular</a> and <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a>s.

A combination of ACE inhibitor with other drugs may increase effects of these drugs, but also the risk of adverse effects. The commonly reported adverse effects of drug combination with ACE are acute renal failure, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The drugs interacting with ACE inhibitor should be prescribed with caution. Special attention should be given to combinations of ACE inhibitor with other RAAS blockers, <a href="diuretics">diuretics</a> (especially potassium-sparing diuretics), NSAIDs, <a href="anticoagulants">anticoagulants</a>, <a href="cyclosporine">cyclosporine</a>, <a href="DPP-4%20inhibitors">DPP-4 inhibitors</a>, and <a href="potassium%20supplements">potassium supplements</a>.

Potassium supplementation should be used with caution and under medical supervision owing to the <a href="hyperkalemia">hyperkalemic</a> effect of ACE inhibitors.

ACE inhibitors are easily identifiable by their common suffix, '-pril'. ACE inhibitors can be divided into three groups based on their molecular structure:


This is the largest group, including:




All ACE inhibitors have similar antihypertensive efficacy when equivalent doses are administered. The main differences lie with <a href="captopril">captopril</a>, the first ACE inhibitor. Captopril has a shorter duration of action and an increased incidence of adverse effects. It is also the only ACE inhibitor capable of passing through the <a href="blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier">blood–brain barrier</a>, although the significance of this characteristic has not been shown to have any positive clinical effects.

In a large clinical study, one of the agents in the ACE inhibitor class, <a href="ramipril">ramipril</a> (Altace), demonstrated an ability to reduce the mortality rates of patients suffering from a <a href="myocardial%20infarction">myocardial infarction</a>, and to slow the subsequent development of heart failure. This finding was made after it was discovered that regular use of ramipril reduced mortality rates even in test subjects not having suffered from hypertension.

Some believe ramipril's additional benefits may be shared by some or all drugs in the ACE-inhibitor class. However, ramipril currently remains the only ACE inhibitor for which such effects are actually evidence-based.

A meta-analysis confirmed that ACE inhibitors are effective and certainly the first-line choice in hypertension treatment. This meta-analysis was based on 20 trials and a cohort of 158,998 patients, of whom 91% were hypertensive. ACE inhibitors were used as the active treatment in seven trials (n=76,615) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in 13 trials (n=82,383).
ACE inhibitors were associated with a statistically significant 10% mortality reduction: (HR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.97; P=0.004). In contrast, no significant mortality reduction was observed with ARB treatment (HR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.94-1.04; P=0.683). Analysis of mortality reduction by different ACE inhibitors showed that perindopril-based regimens are associated with a statistically significant 13% all-cause mortality reduction.
Taking into account the broad spectrum of the hypertensive population, one might expect that an effective treatment with ACE inhibitors, in particular with <a href="perindopril">perindopril</a>, would result in an important gain of lives saved.

The ACE inhibitors have different strengths with different starting dosages. Dosage should be adjusted according to the clinical response.
ACE inhibitors possess many common characteristics with another class of cardiovascular drugs, <a href="angiotensin%20II%20receptor%20antagonist">angiotensin II receptor antagonist</a>s, which are often used when patients are intolerant of the adverse effects produced by ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors do not completely prevent the formation of angiotensin II, as blockage is dose-dependent, so angiotensin II receptor antagonists may be useful because they act to prevent the action of angiotensin II at the AT receptor, leaving AT receptor unblocked; the latter may have consequences needing further study.

The combination therapy of angiotensin II receptor antagonists with ACE inhibitors may be superior to either agent alone. This combination may increase levels of bradykinin while blocking the generation of angiotensin II and its activity at the AT receptor. This 'dual blockade' may be more effective than using an ACE inhibitor alone, because angiotensin II can be generated via non-ACE-dependent pathways. Preliminary studies suggest this combination of pharmacologic agents may be advantageous in the treatment of <a href="essential%20hypertension">essential hypertension</a>, chronic <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a>, and <a href="nephropathy">nephropathy</a>. However, the more recent ONTARGET study showed no benefit of combining the agents and more adverse events. While statistically significant results have been obtained for its role in treating hypertension, clinical significance may be lacking. There are warnings about the combination of ACE inhibitors with ARBs.

Patients with heart failure may benefit from the combination in terms of reducing <a href="morbidity">morbidity</a> and <a href="ventricular%20remodeling">ventricular remodeling</a>.

The most compelling evidence for the treatment of nephropathy has been found: This combination therapy partially reversed the <a href="proteinuria">proteinuria</a> and also exhibited a renoprotective effect in patients afflicted with <a href="diabetic%20nephropathy">diabetic nephropathy</a>, and pediatric <a href="IgA%20nephropathy">IgA nephropathy</a>.

The first step in the development of ACE inhibitors was the discovery of ACE in <a href="blood%20plasma">plasma</a> by <a href="Leonard%20T.%20Skeggs">Leonard T. Skeggs</a> and his colleagues in 1956. Brazilian scientist <a href="S%C3%A9rgio%20Henrique%20Ferreira">Sérgio Henrique Ferreira</a> reported a bradykinin-potentiating factor (BPF) present in the venom of "<a href="Bothrops%20jararaca">Bothrops jararaca</a>", a South American pit viper, in 1965. Ferreira then went to <a href="John%20Vane">John Vane</a>'s laboratory as a postdoctoral fellow with his already-isolated BPF. The conversion of the inactive angiotensin I to the potent angiotensin II was thought to take place in the plasma. However, in 1967, <a href="Kevin%20K.%20F.%20Ng">Kevin K. F. Ng</a> and <a href="John%20R.%20Vane">John R. Vane</a> showed plasma ACE is too slow to account for the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II "in vivo". Subsequent investigation showed rapid conversion occurs during its passage through the pulmonary circulation.

Bradykinin is rapidly inactivated in the circulating blood, and it disappears completely in a single pass through the pulmonary circulation. Angiotensin I also disappears in the pulmonary circulation because of its conversion to angiotensin II. Furthermore, angiotensin II passes through the lungs without any loss. The inactivation of bradykinin and the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II in the lungs was thought to be caused by the same enzyme. In 1970, Ng and Vane, using BPF provided by Ferreira, showed the conversion is inhibited during its passage through the pulmonary circulation.

BPFs are members of a family of peptides whose potentiating action is linked to inhibition of bradykinin by ACE. Molecular analysis of BPF yielded a nonapeptide BPF <a href="teprotide">teprotide</a> (SQ 20,881), which showed the greatest ACE inhibition potency and hypotensive effect "in vivo". Teprotide had limited clinical value as a result of its peptide nature and lack of activity when given orally. In the early 1970s, knowledge of the structure-activity relationship required for inhibition of ACE was growing. <a href="David%20Cushman">David Cushman</a>, <a href="Miguel%20Ondetti">Miguel Ondetti</a> and colleagues used peptide analogues to study the structure of ACE, using carboxypeptidase A as a model. Their discoveries led to the development of captopril, the first orally-active ACE inhibitor, in 1975.

Captopril was approved by the United States <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> in 1981. The first nonsulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor, enalapril, was marketed two years later. At least 12 other ACE inhibitors have since been marketed.

In 1991, Japanese scientists created the first milk-based ACE inhibitor, in the form of a fermented milk drink, using specific cultures to liberate the <a href="tripeptide">tripeptide</a> <a href="isoleucine">isoleucine</a>-<a href="proline">proline</a>-proline (IPP) from the dairy protein. <a href="Valine">Valine</a>-proline-proline (VPP) is also liberated in this process—another milk tripeptide with a very similar chemical structure to IPP. Together, these peptides are now often referred to as <a href="lactotripeptides">lactotripeptides</a>. In 1996, the first human study confirmed the blood pressure-lowering effect of IPP in fermented milk. Although twice the amount of VPP is needed to achieve the same ACE-inhibiting activity as the originally discovered IPP, VPP also is assumed to add to the total blood pressure lowering effect.
Since the first lactotripeptides discovery, more than 20 human clinical trials have been conducted in many different countries.

Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System

The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System is used for the <a href="drug%20class">classification</a> of <a href="Medication">active ingredient</a>s of <a href="drug">drug</a>s according to the <a href="organ%20%28anatomy%29">organ</a> or <a href="system">system</a> on which they act and their <a href="therapeutic">therapeutic</a>, <a href="pharmacological">pharmacological</a> and chemical properties. It is controlled by the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology (WHOCC), and was first published in 1976.

This <a href="Pharmaceutical%20code">pharmaceutical coding system</a> divides drugs into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act or their <a href="medicine">therapeutic</a> and <a href="chemical%20classification">chemical characteristics</a>. Each bottom-level ATC code stands for a pharmaceutically used substance, or a combination of substances, in a single indication (or use). This means that one drug can have more than one code: <a href="acetylsalicylic%20acid">acetylsalicylic acid</a> (aspirin), for example, has as a drug for local <a href="mouth">oral</a> treatment, as a <a href="platelet%20inhibitor">platelet inhibitor</a>, and as an <a href="analgesic">analgesic</a> and <a href="antipyretic">antipyretic</a>. On the other hand, several different brands share the same code if they have the same active substance and indications.

The ATC system is based on the earlier Anatomical Classification System, which is intended as a tool for the pharmaceutical industry to classify pharmaceutical products (as opposed to their active ingredients). This system, confusingly also called ATC, was initiated in 1971 by the <a href="European%20Pharmaceutical%20Market%20Research%20Association">European Pharmaceutical Market Research Association</a> (EphMRA) and is being maintained by the EphMRA and the <a href="Pharmaceutical%20Business%20Intelligence%20and%20Research%20Group">Pharmaceutical Business Intelligence and Research Group</a> (PBIRG). Its codes are organised into four levels. The WHO's system, having five levels, is an extension and modification of the EphMRA's. It was first published in 1976.

In this system, drugs are classified into groups at five different levels:

The first level of the code indicates the anatomical main group and consists of one letter. There are 14 main groups:

"Example": <a href="ATC%20code%20C">C</a> <a href="Cardiovascular%20system">Cardiovascular system</a>

The second level of the code indicates the therapeutic main group and consists of two digits.

"Example": <a href="ATC%20code%20C03">C03</a> <a href="Diuretic">Diuretic</a>s

The third level of the code indicates the therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup and consists of one letter.

"Example": C03C High-ceiling diuretics

The fourth level of the code indicates the chemical/therapeutic/pharmacological subgroup and consists of one letter.

"Example": C03CA <a href="Sulfonamide%20%28medicine%29">Sulfonamide</a>s

The fifth level of the code indicates the chemical substance and consists of two digits.

"Example": C03CA01 <a href="Furosemide">Furosemide</a>

The "Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System for veterinary medicinal products" (ATCvet) is used to classify <a href="veterinary">veterinary</a> drugs. ATCvet codes can be created by placing the letter Q in front of the ATC code of most human medications. For example, furosemide for veterinary use has the code QC03CA01.

Some codes are used exclusively for veterinary drugs, such as "<a href="ATCvet%20code%20QI">QI</a> Immunologicals", "<a href="ATCvet%20code%20QJ51">QJ51</a> Antibacterials for intramammary use" or "QN05AX90 <a href="amperozide">amperozide</a>".

The ATC system also includes defined daily doses (DDDs) for many drugs. This is a measurement of drug consumption based on the usual daily dose for a given drug. According to the definition, "[t]he DDD is the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults."

National issues of the ATC classification, such as the <a href="Germany">German</a> "Anatomisch-therapeutisch-chemische Klassifikation mit Tagesdosen", may include additional codes and DDDs not present in the WHO version.

ATC follows guidelines in creating new codes for newly approved drugs. In order to create a new ATC code, an application has to be sent to the WHO. New ATC codes are published twice annually. A formal release of new ATC edition occurs once a year.

<doc id="2778" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2778" title="Parallel ATA">
Parallel ATA

Parallel ATA (PATA), originally ', is an <a href="Electrical%20connector">interface</a> <a href="standardization">standard</a> for the connection of <a href="computer%20storage">storage</a> devices such as <a href="hard%20disk%20drive">hard disk drive</a>s, <a href="floppy%20disk%20drive">floppy disk drive</a>s, and <a href="optical%20disc%20drive">optical disc drive</a>s in <a href="computer">computer</a>s. The standard is maintained by the X3/<a href="INCITS">INCITS</a> committee. It uses the underlying ' (ATA) and Packet Interface (<a href="ATA%20Packet%20Interface">ATAPI</a>) standards.

The Parallel ATA standard is the result of a long history of incremental technical development, which began with the original AT Attachment interface, developed for use in early <a href="PC%20AT">PC AT</a> equipment. The ATA interface itself evolved in several stages from <a href="Western%20Digital">Western Digital</a>'s original Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) interface. As a result, many near-synonyms for ATA/ATAPI and its previous incarnations are still in common informal use, in particular Extended IDE (EIDE) and Ultra ATA (UATA). After the introduction of <a href="Serial%20ATA">Serial ATA</a> (SATA) in 2003, the original ATA was <a href="retronym">renamed</a> to Parallel ATA, or PATA for short.

Parallel ATA cables have a maximum allowable length of . Because of this limit, the technology normally appears as an internal computer storage interface. For many years, ATA provided the most common and the least expensive interface for this application. It has largely been replaced by SATA in newer systems.

The standard was originally conceived as the "AT Bus Attachment," officially called "AT Attachment" and abbreviated "ATA" because its primary feature was a direct connection to the 16-bit <a href="ISA%20bus">ISA bus</a> introduced with the <a href="IBM%20PC/AT">IBM PC/AT</a>. The original ATA specifications published by the standards committees use the name "AT Attachment". The "AT" in the IBM PC/AT referred to "Advanced Technology" so ATA has also been referred to as "Advanced Technology Attachment". When a newer Serial ATA Serial ATA (SATA) was introduced in 2003, the original ATA was renamed to Parallel ATA, or PATA for short.

The first version of what is now called the ATA/ATAPI interface was developed by <a href="Western%20Digital">Western Digital</a> under the name "Integrated Drive Electronics" (IDE). Together with <a href="Control%20Data%20Corporation">Control Data Corporation</a> (the hard drive manufacturer) and <a href="Compaq">Compaq Computer</a> (the initial customer), they developed the connector, the signaling protocols and so on, with the goal of remaining software compatible with the existing <a href="ST-506">ST-506</a> hard drive interface. The first such drives appeared in Compaq PCs in 1986.

The term "Integrated Drive Electronics" refers not just to the connector and interface definition, but also to the fact that the <a href="drive%20controller">drive controller</a> is integrated into the drive, as opposed to a separate controller on or connected to the <a href="motherboard">motherboard</a>. The interface cards used to connect a parallel ATA drive to, for example, a <a href="PCI%20slot">PCI slot</a> are not drive controllers: they are merely bridges between the host bus and the ATA interface. Since the original ATA interface is essentially just a 16-bit <a href="ISA%20bus">ISA bus</a> in disguise, the bridge was especially simple in case of an ATA connector being located on an ISA interface card. The integrated controller presented the drive to the host computer as an array of 512-byte blocks with a relatively simple command interface. This relieved the mainboard and interface cards in the host computer of the chores of stepping the disk head arm, moving the head arm in and out, and so on, as had to be done with earlier <a href="ST-506">ST-506</a> and <a href="Enhanced%20Small%20Disk%20Interface">ESDI</a> hard drives. All of these low-level details of the mechanical operation of the drive were now handled by the controller on the drive itself. This also eliminated the need to design a single controller that could handle many different types of drives, since the controller could be unique for the drive. The host need only to ask for a particular sector, or block, to be read or written, and either accept the data from the drive or send the data to it.

The interface used by these drives was standardized in 1994 as ANSI standard X3.221-1994, "AT Attachment Interface for Disk Drives". After later versions of the standard were developed, this became known as "ATA-1".

A short-lived, seldom-used implementation of ATA was created for the <a href="IBM%20Personal%20Computer%20XT">IBM XT</a> and similar machines that used the 8-bit version of the ISA bus. It has been referred to as <a href="Industry%20Standard%20Architecture%23XT-IDE">"XT-IDE"</a>, "XTA" or "XT Attachment".

When PC motherboard makers started to include onboard ATA interfaces in place of the earlier ISA plug-in cards, there was usually only one ATA connector on the board, which could support up to two hard drives. At the time, in combination with the floppy drive, this was sufficient for most users. When the <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> was developed, many computers would have been unable to accept these drives if they had been ATA devices, due to already having two hard drives installed. Adding the CD-ROM drive would have required removal of one of the drives.

<a href="SCSI">SCSI</a> was available as a CD-ROM expansion option at the time, but devices with SCSI were more expensive than ATA devices due to the need for a smart interface that is capable of <a href="bus%20arbitration">bus arbitration</a>. SCSI typically added to the cost of a storage device, in addition to the cost of a SCSI host adapter.

The less expensive solution was the addition of a dedicated CD-ROM interface, which was typically included as an expansion option on a <a href="sound%20card">sound card</a>. PC motherboards initially did not come with support for more than simple beeps from <a href="PC%20speaker">internal speaker</a>s; thus, sound cards (such as the <a href="Sound%20Blaster%20Pro">Sound Blaster Pro</a>) were available for use with games, operating system and software event sounds, or to listen to audio CDs. Also, sound cards commonly included a <a href="gameport">gameport</a> joystick/gamepad port along with interfaces to control a CD-ROM and transmit CD audio to the system.

Initially, the second drive interface was not well defined. It was first introduced with interfaces specific to certain CD-ROM drives such as Mitsumi, Sony or Panasonic drives, and it was common to find early sound cards with two or three separate connectors each designed to match a certain brand of CD-ROM drive. This evolved into the standard ATA interface for ease of cross-compatibility, though the sound card ATA interface still usually supported only a single CD-ROM and not hard drives.

This second ATA interface on the sound card eventually evolved into the second motherboard ATA interface which was long included as a standard component in all PCs.
Called the "primary" and "secondary" ATA interfaces, they were assigned to <a href="Input/Output%20Base%20Address">base addresses</a> 0x1F0 and 0x170 on <a href="ISA%20bus">ISA bus</a> systems.

In 1994, about the same time that the ATA-1 standard was adopted, Western Digital introduced drives under a newer name, Enhanced IDE (EIDE). These included most of the features of the forthcoming ATA-2 specification and several additional enhancements. Other manufacturers introduced their own variations of ATA-1 such as "Fast ATA" and "Fast ATA-2".

The new version of the ANSI standard, "AT Attachment Interface with Extensions ATA-2" (X3.279-1996), was approved in 1996. It included most of the features of the manufacturer-specific variants.

ATA-2 also was the first to note that devices other than hard drives could be attached to the interface:
As mentioned in the previous sections, ATA was originally designed for, and worked only with <a href="hard%20disk%20drive">hard disk drive</a>s and devices that could emulate them. The introduction of ATAPI (ATA Packet Interface) by a group called the <a href="Small%20Form%20Factor%20committee">Small Form Factor committee</a> (SFF) allowed ATA to be used for a variety of other devices that require functions beyond those necessary for hard disk drives. For example, any removable media device needs a "media eject" command, and a way for the host to determine whether the media is present, and these were not provided in the ATA protocol.

The Small Form Factor committee approached this problem by defining ATAPI, the "ATA Packet Interface". ATAPI is actually a protocol allowing the ATA interface to carry <a href="SCSI">SCSI</a> commands and responses; therefore, all ATAPI devices are actually "speaking SCSI" other than at the electrical interface. In fact, some early ATAPI devices were simply SCSI devices with an ATA/ATAPI to SCSI protocol converter added on. The SCSI commands and responses are embedded in "packets" (hence "ATA Packet Interface") for transmission on the ATA cable. This allows any device class for which a SCSI command set has been defined to be interfaced via ATA/ATAPI.

ATAPI devices are also "speaking ATA", as the ATA physical interface and protocol are still being used to send the packets. On the other hand, ATA hard drives and solid state drives do not use ATAPI.

ATAPI devices include CD-ROM and <a href="DVD-ROM">DVD-ROM</a> drives, <a href="tape%20drive">tape drive</a>s, and large-capacity <a href="floppy%20disk">floppy</a> drives such as the <a href="Zip%20drive">Zip drive</a> and <a href="SuperDisk%20drive">SuperDisk drive</a>.

The SCSI commands and responses used by each class of ATAPI device (CD-ROM, tape, etc.) are described in other documents or specifications specific to those device classes
and are not within ATA/ATAPI or the <a href="T13%20subcommittee">T13</a> committee's purview. One commonly used set is defined in the <a href="MultiMedia%20Commands">MMC</a> SCSI command set.

ATAPI was adopted as part of ATA in INCITS 317-1998, "AT Attachment with Packet Interface Extension (ATA/ATAPI-4)".

The ATA/ATAPI-4 standard also introduced several "Ultra DMA" transfer modes. These initially supported speeds from 16 MByte/s to 33 MByte/second. In later versions, faster Ultra DMA modes were added, requiring new 80-wire cables to reduce crosstalk. The latest versions of Parallel ATA support up to 133 MByte/s.

Ultra ATA, abbreviated UATA, is a designation that has been primarily used by <a href="Western%20Digital%20Corporation">Western Digital</a> for different speed enhancements to the ATA/ATAPI standards. For example, in 2000 Western Digital published a document describing "Ultra ATA/100", which brought performance improvements for the then-current ATA/ATAPI-5 standard by improving maximum speed of the Parallel ATA interface from 66 to 100 MB/s. Most of Western Digital's changes, along with others, were included in the ATA/ATAPI-6 standard (2002).

The terms "integrated drive electronics" (IDE), "enhanced IDE" and "EIDE" have come to be used interchangeably with ATA (now Parallel ATA, or PATA).

In addition, there have been several generations of "EIDE" drives marketed, compliant with various versions of the ATA specification. An early "EIDE" drive might be compatible with ATA-2, while a later one with ATA-6.

Nevertheless, a request for an "IDE" or "EIDE" drive from a computer parts vendor will almost always yield a drive that will work with most Parallel ATA interfaces.

Another common usage is to refer to the specification version by the fastest mode supported. For example, ATA-4 supported Ultra DMA modes 0 through 2, the latter providing a maximum transfer rate of 33 megabytes per second. ATA-4 drives are thus sometimes called "UDMA-33" drives, and sometimes "ATA-33" drives. Similarly, ATA-6 introduced a maximum transfer speed of 100 megabytes per second, and some drives complying to this version of the standard are marketed as "PATA/100" drives.

Initially, the size of an ATA drive was stored in the system <a href="x86">x86</a> BIOS using a type number (1 through 45) that predefined the C/H/S parameters and also often the landing zone, in which the drive heads are parked while not in use. Later, a "user definable" format called C/H/S or cylinders, heads, sectors was made available. These numbers were important for the earlier ST-506 interface, but were generally meaningless for ATA—the CHS parameters for later ATA large drives often specified impossibly high numbers of heads or sectors that did not actually define the internal physical layout of the drive at all. From the start, and up to ATA-2, every user had to specify explicitly how large every attached drive was. From ATA-2 on, an "identify drive" command was implemented that can be sent and which will return all drive parameters.

Owing to a lack of foresight by motherboard manufacturers, the system BIOS was often hobbled by artificial C/H/S size limitations due to the manufacturer assuming certain values would never exceed a particular numerical maximum.

The first of these BIOS limits occurred when ATA drives reached sizes in excess of 504 megabytes, because some motherboard BIOSes would not allow C/H/S values above 1024 cylinders, 16 heads, and 63 sectors. Multiplied by 512 bytes per sector, this totals bytes which, divided by bytes per megabyte, equals 504 megabytes.

The second of these BIOS limitations occurred at 1024 <a href="Cylinder-head-sector%23Cylinders">cylinders</a>, 256 <a href="Cylinder-head-sector%23Heads">heads</a>, and 63 <a href="Disk%20sector">sectors</a>, and a bug in <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> and <a href="Windows%2095">MS-Windows 95</a> limited the number of heads to 255. This totals to bytes, commonly referred to as the 8.4 gigabyte barrier. This is again a limit imposed by x86 BIOSes, and not a limit imposed by the ATA interface.

It was eventually determined that these size limitations could be overridden with a tiny program loaded at startup from a hard drive's boot sector. Some hard drive manufacturers, such as Western Digital, started including these override utilities with new large hard drives to help overcome these problems. However, if the computer was booted in some other manner without loading the special utility, the invalid BIOS settings would be used and the drive could either be inaccessible or appear to the operating system to be damaged.

Later, an extension to the x86 BIOS <a href="INT%2013H">disk services</a> called the "<a href="Enhanced%20Disk%20Drive">Enhanced Disk Drive</a>" (EDD) was made available, which makes it possible to address drives as large as 2 sectors.

The first drive interface used 22-bit addressing mode which resulted in a maximum drive capacity of two gigabytes. Later, the first formalized ATA specification used a 28-bit addressing mode through <a href="LBA28">LBA28</a>, allowing for the addressing of 2 () sectors (blocks) of 512 bytes each, resulting in a maximum capacity of 128 <a href="Gibibyte">GiB</a> (137 <a href="Gigabyte">GB</a>).

ATA-6 introduced 48-bit addressing, increasing the limit to 128 <a href="Pebibyte">PiB</a> (144 <a href="Petabyte">PB</a>). As a consequence, any ATA drive of capacity larger than about 137 GB must be an ATA-6 or later drive. Connecting such a drive to a host with an ATA-5 or earlier interface will limit the usable capacity to the maximum of the interface.

Some operating systems, including <a href="Windows%20XP">Windows XP</a> pre-SP1, and <a href="Windows%202000">Windows 2000</a> pre-SP3, disable <a href="LBA48">LBA48</a> by default, requiring the user to take extra steps to use the entire capacity of an ATA drive larger than about 137 gigabytes.

Older operating systems, such as <a href="Windows%2098">Windows 98</a>, do not support 48-bit LBA at all. However, members of the third-party group MSFN have modified the Windows 98 disk drivers to add unofficial support for 48-bit LBA to <a href="Windows%2095%20OSR2">Windows 95 OSR2</a>, <a href="Windows%2098">Windows 98</a>, <a href="Windows%2098%20SE">Windows 98 SE</a> and <a href="Windows%20ME">Windows ME</a>.

Some 16-bit and 32-bit operating systems supporting LBA48 may still not support disks larger than 2 <a href="TiB">TiB</a> due to using 32-bit arithmetics only; a limitation also applying to many <a href="boot%20sector">boot sector</a>s.

Parallel ATA (then simply called ATA or IDE) became the primary storage device interface for PCs soon after 
its introduction. In some systems, a third and fourth motherboard interface was provided, allowing up to eight ATA devices to be attached to the motherboard. Often, these additional connectors were implemented by inexpensive <a href="RAID">RAID</a> controllers.

Soon after the introduction of <a href="Serial%20ATA">Serial ATA</a> (SATA) in 2003, use of Parallel ATA declined. The first motherboards with built-in SATA interfaces usually had only a single PATA connector (for up to two PATA devices), along with multiple SATA connectors.

As of 2007, some PC <a href="chipset">chipset</a>s, for example the Intel ICH10, had removed support for PATA. Motherboard vendors still wishing to offer Parallel ATA with those chipsets must include an additional interface chip. In more recent computers, the Parallel ATA interface is rarely used even if present, as four or more Serial ATA connectors are usually provided on the motherboard and SATA devices of all types are common.

With <a href="Western%20Digital">Western Digital</a>'s withdrawal from the PATA market, hard disk drives with the PATA interface were no longer in production after December 2013 for other than specialty applications.

Parallel ATA cables transfer data 16 bits at a time. The traditional cable uses 40-pin connectors attached to a <a href="ribbon%20cable">ribbon cable</a>. Each cable has two or three connectors, one of which plugs into an adapter interfacing with the rest of the computer system. The remaining connector(s) plug into storage devices, most commonly hard disk drives or optical drives.

ATA's cables have had 40 wires for most of its history (44 conductors for the smaller form-factor version used for 2.5" drives—the extra four for power), but an 80-wire version appeared with the introduction of the "UDMA/66" mode. All of the additional wires in the new cable are <a href="ground%20%28electricity%29">ground</a> wires, interleaved with the previously defined wires to reduce the effects of <a href="capacitive%20coupling">capacitive coupling</a> between neighboring signal wires, reducing <a href="Crosstalk%20%28electronics%29">crosstalk</a>. Capacitive coupling is more of a problem at higher transfer rates, and this change was necessary to enable the 66 megabytes per second (MB/s) transfer rate of "UDMA4" to work reliably. The faster "UDMA5" and "UDMA6" modes also require 80-conductor cables.

Though the number of wires doubled, the number of connector pins and the pinout remain the same as 40-conductor cables, and the external appearance of the connectors is identical. Internally, the connectors are different; the connectors for the 80-wire cable connect a larger number of ground wires to the ground pins, while the connectors for the 40-wire cable connect ground wires to ground pins one-for-one. 80-wire cables usually come with three differently colored connectors (blue, black, and gray for controller, master drive, and slave drive respectively) as opposed to uniformly colored 40-wire cable's connectors (commonly all gray). The gray connector on 80-conductor cables has pin 28 CSEL not connected, making it the slave position for drives configured cable select.

Round parallel ATA cables (as opposed to ribbon cables) were eventually made available for '<a href="case%20mod">case mod</a>ders' for cosmetic reasons, as well as claims of improved <a href="computer%20cooling%23Rounded%20cables">computer cooling</a> and were easier to handle; however, only ribbon cables are supported by the ATA specifications.

In the ATA standard, pin 20 is defined as (mechanical) key and is not used. This socket on the female connector is often obstructed, requiring pin 20 to be omitted from the male cable or drive connector, making it impossible to plug it in the wrong way round; a male connector with pin 20 present cannot be used. However, some <a href="flash%20memory">flash memory</a> drives can use pin 20 as VCC_in to power the drive without requiring a special power cable; this feature can only be used if the equipment supports this use of pin 20.

Pin 28 of the gray (slave/middle) connector of an 80-conductor cable is not attached to any conductor of the cable. It is attached normally on the black (master drive end) and blue (motherboard end) connectors.

Pin 34 is connected to ground inside the blue connector of an 80-conductor cable but not attached to any conductor of the cable. It is attached normally on the gray and black connectors.

The image on the right shows PATA connectors after removal of strain relief, cover, and cable. Pin one is at bottom left of the connectors, pin 2 is top left, etc., except that the lower image of the blue connector shows the view from the opposite side, and pin one is at top right. 

The connector is an <a href="insulation-displacement%20connector">insulation-displacement connector</a>—in other words, each contact comprises a pair of points which together pierce the insulation of the ribbon cable with such precision that they make a connection to the desired conductor without harming the insulation on the neighboring wires. The center row of contacts are all connected to the common ground bus and attached to the odd numbered conductors of the cable. The top row of contacts are the even-numbered sockets of the connector (mating with the even-numbered pins of the receptacle) and attach to every other even-numbered conductor of the cable. The bottom row of contacts are the odd-numbered sockets of the connector (mating with the odd-numbered pins of the receptacle) and attach to the remaining even-numbered conductors of the cable.

Note the connections to the common ground bus from sockets 2 (top left), 19 (center bottom row), 22, 24, 26, 30, and 40 on all connectors. Also note (enlarged detail, bottom, looking from the opposite side of the connector) that socket 34 of the blue connector does not contact any conductor but unlike socket 34 of the other two connectors, it does connect to the common ground bus. On the gray connector, note that socket 28 is completely missing, so that pin 28 of the drive attached to the gray connector will be open. On the black connector, sockets 28 and 34 are completely normal, so that pins 28 and 34 of the drive attached to the black connector will be connected to the cable. Pin 28 of the black drive reaches pin 28 of the host receptacle but not pin 28 of the gray drive, while pin 34 of the black drive reaches pin 34 of the gray drive but not pin 34 of the host. Instead, pin 34 of the host is grounded.

The standard dictates color-coded connectors for easy identification by both installer and cable maker. All three connectors are different from one another. The blue (host) connector has the socket for pin 34 connected to ground inside the connector but not attached to any conductor of the cable. Since the old 40 conductor cables do not ground pin 34, the presence of a ground connection indicates that an 80 conductor cable is installed. The wire for pin 34 is attached normally on the other types and is not grounded. Installing the cable backwards (with the black connector on the system board, the blue connector on the remote device and the gray connector on the center device) will ground pin 34 of the remote device and connect host pin 34 through to pin 34 of the center device. The gray center connector omits the connection to pin 28 but connects pin 34 normally, while the black end connector connects both pins 28 and 34 normally.

If two devices are attached to a single cable, one must be designated as "device 0" (commonly referred to as "master") and the other as "device 1" ("slave"). This distinction is necessary to allow both drives to share the cable without conflict. The "master" drive is the drive that usually appears "first" to the computer's <a href="BIOS">BIOS</a> and/or <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>. On old BIOSes (<a href="Intel%20486">Intel 486</a> era and older), the drives are often referred to by the BIOS as "C" for the master and "D" for the slave following the way DOS would refer to the active primary partitions on each.

The mode that a drive must use is often set by a <a href="Jumper%20%28computing%29">jumper setting</a> on the drive itself, which must be manually set to "master" or "slave". If there is a single device on a cable, it should be configured as "master". However, some hard drives have a special setting called "single" for this configuration (Western Digital, in particular). Also, depending on the hardware and software available, a single drive on a cable will often work reliably even though configured as the "slave" drive (most often seen where an optical drive is the only device on the secondary ATA interface).

A drive mode called "cable select" was described as optional in ATA-1 and has come into fairly widespread use with ATA-5 and later. A drive set to "cable select" automatically configures itself as master or slave, according to its position on the cable. Cable select is controlled by pin 28. The host adapter grounds this pin; if a device sees that the pin is grounded, it becomes the master device; if it sees that pin 28 is open, the device becomes the slave device.

This setting is usually chosen by a <a href="Jumper%20%28computing%29">jumper setting</a> on the drive called "cable select", usually marked "CS", which is separate from the "master" or "slave" setting.

Note that if two drives are configured as "master" and "slave" manually, this configuration does not need to correspond to their position on the cable. Pin 28 is only used to let the drives know their position on the cable; it is not used by the host when communicating with the drives.

With the 40-wire cable, it was very common to implement cable select by simply cutting the pin 28 wire between the two device connectors; putting the slave device at the end of the cable, and the master on the middle connector. This arrangement eventually was standardized in later versions. If there is just one device on the cable, this results in an unused stub of cable, which is undesirable for physical convenience and electrical reasons. The stub causes <a href="signal%20reflections">signal reflections</a>, particularly at higher transfer rates.

Starting with the 80-wire cable defined for use in ATAPI5/UDMA4, the master device goes at the end of the cable—the black connector—and the slave device goes on the middle connector—the gray one—and the blue connector goes onto the motherboard. So, if there is only one (master) device on the cable, there is no cable stub to cause reflections. Also, cable select is now implemented in the slave device connector, usually simply by omitting the contact from the connector body.

Although they are in extremely common use, the terms <a href="Master/slave%20%28technology%29">"master" and "slave"</a> do not actually appear in current versions of the ATA specifications. The two devices are simply referred to as "device 0" and "device 1", respectively, in ATA-2 and later.

It is a common myth that the controller on the master drive assumes control over the slave drive, or that the master drive may claim priority of communication over the other device on the same ATA interface. In fact, the drivers in the host operating system perform the necessary arbitration and serialization, and each drive's onboard controller operates independently of the other.

The parallel ATA protocols up through ATA-3 require that once a command has been given on an ATA interface, it must complete before any subsequent command may be given. Operations on the devices must be serializedwith only one operation in progress at a timewith respect to the ATA host interface. A useful mental model is that the host ATA interface is busy with the first request for its entire duration, and therefore can not be told about another request until the first one is complete. The function of serializing requests to the interface is usually performed by a device driver in the host operating system.

The ATA-4 and subsequent versions of the specification have included an "overlapped feature set" and a "queued feature set" as optional features, both being given the name "<a href="Tagged%20Command%20Queuing">Tagged Command Queuing</a>" (TCQ), a reference to a set of features from SCSI which the ATA version attempts to emulate. However, support for these is extremely rare in actual parallel ATA products and device drivers because these feature sets were implemented in such a way as to maintain software compatibility with its heritage as originally an extension of the ISA bus. This implementation resulted in excessive CPU utilization which largely negated the advantages of command queuing. By contrast, overlapped and queued operations have been common in other storage buses, in particular, SCSI's version of tagged command queuing had no need to be software compatible with ISA's APIs, allowing it to attain high performance with low overhead on buses which supported first party DMA like PCI. This has long been seen as a major advantage of SCSI.

The Serial ATA standard has supported <a href="Native%20Command%20Queuing">native command queueing</a> (NCQ) since its first release, but it is an optional feature for both host adapters and target devices. Many obsolete PC motherboards do not support NCQ, but modern SATA hard disk drives and SATA <a href="solid-state%20drive">solid-state drive</a>s usually support NCQ, which is not the case for removable (CD/DVD) drives because the ATAPI command set used to control them prohibits queued operations.

There are many debates about how much a slow device can impact the performance of a faster device on the same cable. There is an effect, but the debate is confused by the blurring of two quite different causes, called here "Lowest speed" and "One operation at a time".

It is a common misconception that, if two devices of different speed capabilities are on the same cable, both devices' data transfers will be constrained to the speed of the slower device.

For all modern ATA host adapters, this is not true, as modern ATA host adapters support "independent device timing". This allows each device on the cable to transfer data at its own best speed. Even with older adapters without independent timing, this effect applies only to the data transfer phase of a read or write operation. This is usually the shortest part of a complete read or write operation.

This is caused by the omission of both overlapped and queued feature sets from most parallel ATA products. Only one device on a cable can perform a read or write operation at one time, therefore, a fast device on the same cable as a slow device under heavy use will find it has to wait for the slow device to complete its task first.

However, most modern devices will report write operations as complete once the data is stored in its onboard cache memory, before the data is written to the (slow) magnetic storage. This allows commands to be sent to the other device on the cable, reducing the impact of the "one operation at a time" limit.

The impact of this on a system's performance depends on the application. For example, when copying data from an optical drive to a hard drive (such as during software installation), this effect probably will not matter: Such jobs are necessarily limited by the speed of the optical drive no matter where it is. But if the hard drive in question is also expected to provide good throughput for other tasks at the same time, it probably should not be on the same cable as the optical drive.

ATA devices may support an optional security feature which is defined in an ATA specification, and thus not specific to any brand or device. The security feature can be enabled and disabled by sending special ATA commands to the drive. If a device is locked, it will refuse all access until it is unlocked.

A device can have two passwords: A User Password and a Master Password. Either or both maybe set; there is a Master Password identifier feature which if supported and used can identifies with out disclosing the current Master Password. 

A device can be locked in two modes: High security mode or Maximum security mode. Bit 8 in word 128 of the IDENTIFY response shows which mode the disk is in: 0 = High, 1 = Maximum.

In High security mode, the device can be unlocked with either the User or Master password, using the "SECURITY UNLOCK DEVICE" ATA command. There is an attempt limit, normally set to 5, after which the disk must be power cycled or hard-reset before unlocking can be attempted again. Also in High security mode, the SECURITY ERASE UNIT command can be used with either the User or Master password.

In Maximum security mode, the device can be unlocked only with the User password. If the User password is not available, the only remaining way to get at least the bare hardware back to a usable state is to issue the SECURITY ERASE PREPARE command, immediately followed by SECURITY ERASE UNIT. In Maximum security mode, the SECURITY ERASE UNIT command requires the Master password and will completely erase all data on the disk. Word 89 in the IDENTIFY response indicates how long the operation will take. 

While the ATA lock is intended to be impossible to defeat without a valid password, there are purported workarounds to unlock a device.

Due to a short cable length specifcation and shielding issues it is extremely uncommon to find external PATA devices that directly use PATA for connection to a computer. A device connected externally needs additional cable length to form a U-shaped bend so that the external device may be placed alongside, or on top of the computer case, and the standard cable length is too short to permit this. For ease of reach from motherboard to device, the connectors tend to be positioned towards the front edge of motherboards, for connection to devices protruding from the front of the computer case. This front-edge position makes extension out the back to an external device even more difficult. Ribbon cables are poorly shielded, and the standard relies upon the cabling to be installed inside a shielded computer case to meet RF emissions limits.

External hard disk drives or optical disk drives that have an internal PATA interface, use some other interface technology to bridge the distance between the external device and the computer. USB is the most common external interface, followed by Firewire. A bridge chip inside the external devices converts from the USB interface to PATA, and typically only supports a single external device without cable select or master/slave.

<a href="Compact%20Flash%23Technical%20details">Compact Flash</a> in its "IDE mode" is essentially a miniaturized ATA interface, intended for use on devices that use flash memory storage. No interfacing chips or circuitry are required, other than to directly adapt the smaller CF socket onto the larger ATA connector.

The ATA connector specification does not include pins for supplying power to a CF device, so power is inserted into the connector from a separate source. The exception to this is when the CF device is connected to a 44-pin ATA bus designed for 2.5-inch hard disk drives, commonly found in notebook computers, as this bus implementation must provide power to a standard hard disk drive.

CF devices can be designated as master or slave on an ATA interface, though since most CF devices offer only a single socket, it is not necessary to offer this selection to end users. Although CF can be <a href="hot-pluggable">hot-pluggable</a> with additional design methods, by default when wired directly to an ATA interface, it is not intended to be hot-pluggable.

The following table shows the names of the versions of the ATA standards and the transfer modes and rates supported by each. Note that the transfer rate for each mode (for example, 66.7 MB/s for UDMA4, commonly called "Ultra-DMA 66", defined by ATA-5) gives its maximum theoretical transfer rate on the cable. This is simply two bytes multiplied by the effective clock rate, and presumes that every clock cycle is used to transfer end-user data. In practice, of course, protocol overhead reduces this value.

Congestion on the host bus to which the ATA adapter is attached may also limit the maximum burst transfer rate. For example, the maximum data transfer rate for <a href="conventional%20PCI">conventional PCI</a> bus is 133 MB/s, and this is shared among all active devices on the bus.

In addition, no ATA <a href="hard%20drive">hard drive</a>s existed in 2005 that were capable of measured sustained transfer rates of above 80 MB/s. Furthermore, sustained transfer rate tests do not give realistic throughput expectations for most workloads: They use I/O loads specifically designed to encounter almost no delays from seek time or rotational latency. Hard drive performance under most workloads is limited first and second by those two factors; the transfer rate on the bus is a distant third in importance. Therefore, transfer speed limits above 66 MB/s really affect performance only when the hard drive can satisfy all I/O requests by reading from its internal <a href="disk%20buffer">cache</a>—a very unusual situation, especially considering that such data is usually already buffered by the operating system.

, mechanical hard disk drives can transfer data at up to 157 MB/s, which is beyond the capabilities of the PATA/133 specification. High-performance <a href="solid%20state%20drives">solid state drives</a> can transfer data at up to 308 MB/s.

Only the Ultra DMA modes use <a href="Cyclic%20redundancy%20check">CRC</a> to detect errors in data transfer between the controller and drive. This is a 16-bit CRC, and it is used for data blocks only. Transmission of command and status blocks do not use the fast signaling methods that would necessitate CRC. For comparison, in Serial ATA, 32-bit CRC is used for both commands and data.

ATAPI devices with removable media, other than CD and DVD drives, are classified as ARMD (ATAPI Removable Media Device) and can appear as either a super-floppy (non-partitioned media) or a hard drive (partitioned media) to the <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>. These can be supported as bootable devices by a BIOS complying with the ATAPI Removable Media Device BIOS Specification, originally developed by <a href="Compaq">Compaq Computer Corporation</a> and <a href="Phoenix%20Technologies">Phoenix Technologies</a>. It specifies provisions in the <a href="BIOS">BIOS</a> of a <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a> to allow the computer to be <a href="booting">bootstrapped</a> from devices such as <a href="Iomega%20Zip%20drive">Zip drives</a>, <a href="Iomega%20Jaz%20drive">Jaz drives</a>, <a href="SuperDisk">SuperDisk</a> (LS-120) drives, and similar devices.

These devices have removable media like <a href="Floppy%20disk">floppy disk drives</a>, but capacities more commensurate with <a href="hard%20drive">hard drive</a>s, and programming requirements unlike either. Due to limitations in the floppy controller interface most of these devices were <a href="ATA%20Packet%20Interface">ATAPI</a> devices, connected to one of the host computer's ATA interfaces, similarly to a hard drive or <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> device. However, existing BIOS standards did not support these devices. An ARMD-compliant BIOS allows these devices to be booted from and used under the operating system without requiring device-specific code in the OS.

A BIOS implementing ARMD allows the user to include ARMD devices in the boot search order. Usually an ARMD device is configured earlier in the boot order than the hard drive. Similarly to a floppy drive, if bootable media is present in the ARMD drive, the BIOS will boot from it; if not, the BIOS will continue in the search order, usually with the hard drive last.

There are two variants of ARMD, ARMD-FDD and ARMD-HDD. Originally ARMD caused the devices to appear as a sort of very large floppy drive, either the primary floppy drive device 00h or the secondary device 01h. Some operating systems required code changes to support floppy disks with capacities far larger than any standard floppy disk drive. Also, standard-floppy disk drive emulation proved to be unsuitable for certain high-capacity floppy disk drives such as <a href="Iomega%20Zip%20drive">Iomega Zip drive</a>s. Later the ARMD-HDD, ARMD-"Hard disk device", variant was developed to address these issues. Under ARMD-HDD, an ARMD device appears to the BIOS and the operating system as a hard drive.

In August 2004, Sam Hopkins and Brantley Coile of <a href="Coraid">Coraid</a> specified a lightweight <a href="ATA%20over%20Ethernet">ATA over Ethernet</a> protocol to carry ATA commands over <a href="Ethernet">Ethernet</a> instead of directly connecting them to a PATA host adapter. This permitted the established block protocol to be reused in <a href="storage%20area%20network">storage area network</a> (SAN) applications.

Atari 2600

The Atari 2600 (or Atari Video Computer System before November 1982) is a <a href="home%20video%20game%20console">home video game console</a> by <a href="Atari%2C%20Inc.">Atari, Inc.</a> Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of <a href="microprocessor">microprocessor</a>-based hardware and <a href="ROM%20cartridge">ROM cartridge</a>s containing game code, a format first used with the <a href="Fairchild%20Channel%20F">Fairchild Channel F</a> video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor <a href="dedicated%20console">dedicated</a> hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit.

For five years, 1977 until late 1982, the system was officially sold as the Atari VCS, an abbreviation for Video Computer System. Following the release of the <a href="Atari%205200">Atari 5200</a> in November 1982, the VCS was renamed to the "Atari 2600", after the unit's Atari part number, CX2600. The 2600 was typically bundled with two <a href="joystick">joystick</a> <a href="game%20controller">controllers</a>, a conjoined pair of <a href="paddle%20%28game%20controller%29">paddle</a> controllers, and a game cartridge: initially "<a href="Combat%20%281977%20video%20game%29">Combat</a>", and later "<a href="Pac-Man%20%28Atari%202600%29">Pac-Man</a>".

Ted Dabney and Nolan Bushnell developed the Atari gaming system in the 1970s. Originally operating under the name "Syzygy", Bushnell and Dabney changed the name of their company to "Atari" in 1972. In 1973, Atari Inc. had purchased an engineering think tank called <a href="Cyan%20Engineering">Cyan Engineering</a> to research next-generation video game systems, and had been working on a prototype known as "Stella" (named after one of the engineers' bicycles) for some time. Unlike prior generations of machines that use custom <a href="logic%20programming">logic</a> to play a small number of games, its core is a complete <a href="Central%20processing%20unit">CPU</a>, the famous <a href="MOS%20Technology%206502">MOS Technology 6502</a> in a cost-reduced version known as the <a href="MOS%20Technology%206507">6507</a>. It was combined with a <a href="Random-access%20memory">RAM</a>-and-<a href="Input/output">I/O</a> chip, the <a href="MOS%20Technology%206532">MOS Technology 6532</a>, and a display and sound chip known as the <a href="Television%20Interface%20Adaptor">Television Interface Adaptor</a> (TIA). The first two versions of the machine contained a fourth chip in the video circuitry, a standard CMOS 4050 buffer <a href="Integrated%20circuit">IC</a>. Some later versions of the console eliminated the buffer chip. 

Programs for small computers of the time were generally stored on <a href="Compact%20Cassette">cassette tapes</a>, <a href="floppy%20disk">floppy disk</a>s, or <a href="Punched%20tape">paper tape</a>. By the early 1970s, <a href="Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a> manufactured desktop computers costing thousands of dollars, such as the <a href="HP%209800%20series">HP 9830</a>, which packaged Read Only Memory (ROM) into removable cartridges to add special programming features, and these were being considered for use in games. At first, the design was not going to be cartridge-based, but after seeing a "fake" cartridge system on another machine, they realized they could place the games on cartridges essentially for the price of the connector and packaging.

In 1976, <a href="Fairchild%20Semiconductor">Fairchild Semiconductor</a> released their own CPU-based system, the <a href="Fairchild%20Channel%20F">Video Entertainment System</a>. Stella was still not ready for production, but it was clear that it needed to be before there were a number of "me too" products filling up the market, which had happened after they released "<a href="Pong">Pong</a>". Atari Inc. didn't have the cash flow to complete the system quickly, given that sales of their "Pong" systems were cooling. <a href="Nolan%20Bushnell">Nolan Bushnell</a> eventually turned to <a href="Time%20Warner">Warner Communications</a>, and sold the company to them in 1976 for US$28 million on the promise that Stella would be produced as soon as possible.

Key to the eventual success of the machine was the hiring of <a href="Jay%20Miner">Jay Miner</a>, a chip designer who managed to squeeze an entire <a href="wire%20wrap">wire wrap</a> of equipment making up the TIA into a single chip. Once that was completed and debugged, the system was ready for shipping.

The unit was originally priced at US$199 ($ adjusted for inflation), and shipped with two joysticks and a "<a href="Combat%20%28video%20game%29">Combat</a>" cartridge (eight additional games were available at launch and sold separately). In a move to compete directly with the <a href="Fairchild%20Channel%20F">Channel F</a>, Atari Inc. named the machine the Video Computer System (or VCS for short), as the Channel F was at that point known as the VES, for "Video Entertainment System". The VCS was also rebadged as the Sears Video Arcade and sold through <a href="Sears">Sears, Roebuck and Company</a> stores. Another breakthrough for gaming systems was Atari's invention of a computer-controlled opponent, rather than the usual two-player or asymmetric challenges of the past.
When Fairchild learned of Atari Inc.'s naming, they quickly changed the name of their system to become the Channel F. However, both systems were now in the midst of a vicious round of price-cutting: "Pong" clones that had been made obsolete by these newer and more powerful machines were sold off to discounters for ever-lower prices. Soon many of the clone companies were out of business, and both Fairchild and Atari Inc. were selling to a public that was completely burnt out on Pong. In 1977, Atari Inc. sold 250,000 Video Computer Systems.

For the first year of production, the Video Computer System was manufactured in <a href="Sunnyvale%2C%20California">Sunnyvale, California</a>. The consoles manufactured there had thick plastic molding around the sides and bottom. These added weight to the console, and because all six switches were on the front, these consoles were nicknamed "Heavy Sixers". After this first year, production moved to <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>, and the consoles manufactured there had thinner plastic molding. In 1978, only 550,000 units from a production run of 800,000 were sold, requiring further financial support from Warner to cover losses. This led directly to the disagreements that caused Atari Inc. founder Nolan Bushnell to leave the company in 1978. Despite Bushnell's retirement in 1978, Warren Robinett's invention of the first graphical adventure game, "<a href="Adventure%20%28Atari%202600%29">Adventure</a>", was developed the same year and changed the fundamentals of gaming as it unlocked a game with a "virtual space bigger than the screen".
Once the public realized it was possible to play video games other than "Pong", and programmers learned how to push its hardware's capabilities, the VCS gained popularity. By this point, Fairchild had given up, thinking video games were a passing fad, thereby handing the entire quickly growing market to Atari Inc. By 1979, the VCS was the best-selling <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> gift (and console), due to its exclusive content, and 1 million units were sold that year.
Atari Inc. then licensed the smash <a href="Arcade%20game">arcade</a> hit "<a href="Space%20Invaders">Space Invaders</a>" by <a href="Taito%20Corporation">Taito</a>, which greatly increased the unit's popularity when it was released in January 1980, doubling sales to over 2 million units. The VCS and its cartridges were the main factor behind Atari Inc. grossing more than $2 billion in 1980. Sales then doubled again for the next two years; by 1982, the console had sold 10 million units, while its best-selling game "<a href="Pac-Man%20%28Atari%202600%29">Pac-Man</a>" sold 7 million copies. The console also sold 450,000 units in <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> by 1984. By 1982 the 2600 console cost Atari about $40 to make and was sold for an average of $125. The company spent $4.50 to $6 to manufacture each cartridge and $1 to $2 for advertising, and sold it for $18.95 wholesale.
In 1980, the VCS was given a minor revision in which the left and right difficulty switches were moved to the back of the console, leaving four switches on the front. Other than this, these four-switch consoles looked nearly identical to the earlier six-switch models. In 1982, another version of the four-switch console was released without woodgrain. They were nicknamed "<a href="Darth%20Vader">Darth Vader</a>" consoles due to their all-black appearance. These were also the first consoles to be officially called "Atari 2600", as the <a href="Atari%205200">Atari 5200</a> was released the same year.
During this period, Atari Inc. expanded the 2600 family with two other compatible consoles. Despite the faux-wood panels and what would now appear to be primitive graphics, the game console became widely popular for the time. Later however, they designed the <a href="Atari%202700">Atari 2700</a>, a wireless version of the console that was never released because of a design flaw. The company also built a sleeker version of the machine dubbed the Atari 2800 to sell directly to the <a href="Japan">Japan</a>ese market in early 1983, but it suffered from competition with the newly released <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Famicom</a>.

In a survey mentioned by <a href="Jeff%20Rovin">Jeff Rovin</a> it is reported that more stores reported breakdowns of the Atari 2600 system than any other, and that Atari repair centers seemed to have the most trouble with consoles manufactured in 1980. In one case it is stated that a system was repaired five times before static electricity from a carpet was discovered as having caused the problem. The controllers were also a source of breakage because of the way they could be gripped by a player holding it with their fist, allowing players to get carried away and over control, which was less likely with other systems released at the time, such as the <a href="Magnavox%20Odyssey%C2%B2">Magnavox Odyssey²</a>, which has controllers that are nearly half its size.

Atari Inc. also continued their <a href="Original%20equipment%20manufacturer">OEM</a> relationship with Sears under the latter's Tele-Games brand label, which started in 1975 with the original "<a href="Pong">Pong</a>". Sears released several versions of the 2600 as the Sears Video Arcade series from 1977 to 1983. These include the Rev. A "Heavy Sixer" model in 1977, the "Light Sixer" model in 1978, the Rev. B "4 switch" model in 1980, and the US version of the Atari 2800 branded as the Sears Video Arcade II in 1983.

Sears also released their own versions of Atari Inc.'s games under the Tele-Games brand — often with different titles — which included the Tele-Games branded variations of text and picture labels. Three games were also produced by Atari Inc. for Sears as exclusive releases under the Tele-Games brand: "<a href="Steeplechase%20%28video%20game%29">Steeplechase</a>", "Stellar Track", and "Submarine Commander".

Sears's Tele-Games brand was unrelated to the company <a href="Telegames">Telegames</a>, which also produced cartridges for the Atari 2600 — mostly re-issues of <a href="M%20Network">M Network</a> games.

During the 1970s, Atari Inc. continued to grow until it had one of the largest <a href="research%20and%20development">R&D</a> divisions in <a href="Silicon%20Valley">Silicon Valley</a>. However, it spent much of its R&D budget on projects that seemed out of place at a video game (or even home computer) company; many of these projects never saw the light of day. Meanwhile, several attempts to bring out newer consoles failed for one reason or another, although Atari Inc.'s <a href="home%20computer">home computer</a> system (the <a href="Atari%208-bit%20family">Atari 8-bit family</a>) sold reasonably well, Warner was pleased as it seemed to have no end to the sales of the 2600, and Atari Inc. was responsible for over half of the company's income.

The programmers of many of Atari Inc.'s biggest hits grew disgruntled with the company for not crediting game developers and many left the company and formed their own independent software companies. The most prominent and longest-lasting of these third-party developers was <a href="Activision">Activision</a>, founded in 1980, whose titles quickly became more popular than those of Atari Inc. itself. Atari Inc. attempted to block third-party development for the 2600 in court but failed, and soon other publishers, such as <a href="Imagic">Imagic</a> and <a href="Coleco">Coleco</a>, entered the market. Atari Inc. suffered from an image problem when a company named <a href="Mystique%20%28company%29">Mystique</a> produced a number of <a href="pornography">pornographic</a> games for the 2600. The most notorious of these, "<a href="Custer%27s%20Revenge">Custer's Revenge</a>", was protested by women's and <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> groups because it depicted <a href="George%20Armstrong%20Custer">General George Armstrong Custer</a> raping a bound Native American woman. Atari Inc. sued Mystique in court over the release of the game.

Atari Inc. continued to acquire licenses for the 2600, the most prominent of which included "<a href="Pac-Man%20%28Atari%202600%29">Pac-Man</a>" and "<a href="E.T.%20the%20Extra-Terrestrial%20%28video%20game%29">E.T.</a>" Public disappointment with these two titles and the market saturation of poor third-party titles are cited as major contributors to the <a href="North%20American%20video%20game%20crash%20of%201983">video game crash of 1983</a>. Suddenly, Atari Inc.'s growth meant it was losing massive amounts of money during the crash, at one point about $10,000 a day. This in part led to the <a href="Atari%20video%20game%20burial">Atari video game burial</a> of 1000s of unsold Atari 2600 games in the desert in New Mexico. Warner quickly grew tired of supporting Atari Inc., and started looking for buyers in 1984.

By mid-1984 most software development for the 2600 had stopped except by Atari and Activision, with third-party developers emphasizing ColecoVision games. Although not formally discontinued, the 2600 was de-emphasized for two years after Warner's 1984 sale of Atari Inc.'s Consumer Division to <a href="Commodore%20International">Commodore Business Machines</a> founder <a href="Jack%20Tramiel">Jack Tramiel</a>, who wanted to concentrate on <a href="home%20computer">home computer</a>s. He ended all development of console games, including a <a href="Garfield%20%28Atari%202600%29">2600 "Garfield" game</a> and an Atari 5200 port of "<a href="Super%20Pac-Man">Super Pac-Man</a>". Due to a large library and a low price point, the 2600 and the 2600 Jr. continued to sell into the late 1980s and were not discontinued until 1992. The 2600 ended up outdoing all other hardware that Atari released, in attempt to replicate its success.

The Atari 2800 is the Japanese version of the Atari 2600, released in October 1983. It was the first release of a 2600 designed specifically for the Japanese market, despite companies like <a href="Epoch%20Co.">Epoch</a> distributing the 2600 in Japan previously. In fact, Atari's name was inspired by the Japanese game 'Go'.

The 2800 never captured a large market in Japan. It was released a short time after <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Family Computer</a>, which became the dominant console in the Japanese video game market of the time.

Codenamed "Cindy", and designed by Atari engineer Joe Tilly, the Atari 2800 had four controller ports instead of the standard two on the Atari 2600's. The <a href="game%20controller">controllers</a> are an all-in one design using a combination of an 8-direction digital <a href="joystick">joystick</a> and a 270-degree <a href="paddle%20%28game%20controller%29">paddle</a>, designed by John Amber.

The 2800's case design departed from the standard 2600 format, using a wedge shape with non-protruding switches.

Around 30 specially branded games were released for the 2800. Their boxes are in Japanese and have a silver/red color scheme similar to the packaging of Atari's 2600 branded games of the time. The <a href="ROM%20cartridge">ROM cartridge</a>s themselves had identical labels as their 2600 branded counterparts.

Sears liked the design of the Atari 2800 so much, they opted to sell a version under their Tele-Games label. It was released in the US in 1983 as the Sears Video Arcade II, and was packaged with 2 controllers and "<a href="Space%20Invaders">Space Invaders</a>".

The Atari 2800's case style was used as the basis for the <a href="Atari%207800">Atari 7800</a>'s case style by Barney Huang.

In 1986, a new version of the 2600 was released. The newly redesigned version of the 2600, unofficially referred to as the 2600 Jr., features a smaller, cost-reduced form factor with a modernized, <a href="Atari%207800">Atari 7800</a>-like appearance. The redesigned 2600 was advertised as a budget gaming system (under US$50) that has the ability to run a large collection of classic games.

The Atari 2600 continued to sell in North America and Europe until 1991, and in Asia until the early 1990s. Its final Atari-licensed release is "<a href="Klax%20%28video%20game%29">KLAX</a>" in 1990. In 2007, the Atari 2600 was inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame, with 40 million units sold in its lifetime, and the youngest toy to be inducted. In <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, the console became extremely popular in the mid-1980s. The Atari 2600 was officially retired by Atari Corp. on January 1, 1992, making it, at the time, the longest-lived home video game console (14 years, 4 months) in video game history. It was later surpassed by the <a href="Sega%20Master%20System">Sega Master System</a>, a console that never formally ended production in Brazil.

The Atari 2600 was also, at the time, the best-selling American-made console, selling 30 million units. 

The system was promoted on a United Kingdom TV ad in 1989 in the run-up to Christmas, in which it claimed "The fun is back!". The advertising campaign used its price of under £50 as a selling point. The advert was a re-dubbed version of the early original campaign in the United States. Also, the 2600 Jr. was originally to be packaged with a Pro-Line joystick (the same one used on the Atari 7800), but when it was released, it instead included the original CX-40 Joystick. Later European versions of the 2600 Jr. included a joypad, which was also featured with the European 7800.

The CPU was the <a href="MOS%20Technology%206507">MOS Technology 6507</a>, a stripped-down version of the <a href="MOS%20Technology%206502">6502</a>, running at 1.19 <a href="megahertz">MHz</a> in the 2600. Though their internal silicon wafer was identical, the 6507 was cheaper than the 6502 because its package included fewer <a href="Memory%20address">memory-address</a> pins—13 instead of 16. Smaller packaging was, and still is, an important factor in overall system cost, and since memory was very expensive at the time, the 6507's small 8 <a href="kilobyte">kB</a> of maximum external memory space was not going to be used up anyway.

The designers of the Atari 2600 selected an inexpensive cartridge interface that had one fewer address than the 13 allowed by the 6507, further reducing the already limited addressable memory to 4 <a href="kilobyte">kB</a> (2^12 = 4096). This was believed to be sufficient as "<a href="Combat%20%28video%20game%29">Combat</a>" was itself only 2 <a href="kilobyte">kB</a>. Later games get around this limitation with <a href="bank%20switching">bank switching</a>. The maximum supported cartridge size is 32 <a href="kilobyte">kilobyte</a>s. Atari established their system design in order to be compatible with the cathode-ray tube television sets in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

The console has only 128 <a href="byte">byte</a>s of <a href="random-access%20memory">RAM</a> for <a href="Run%20time%20%28program%20lifecycle%20phase%29">run-time</a> data that includes the <a href="call%20stack">call stack</a> and the state of the game world. There is no <a href="framebuffer">frame buffer</a>. Instead the video device has two <a href="bitmap">bitmap</a>ped <a href="Sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a>, two 1-pixel "missile" sprites, a 1-pixel "ball," and a 40-pixel "playfield" that is drawn by writing a bit pattern for each line into a register just before the television scans that line. As each line is scanned, a game must identify the non-sprite objects that overlaps the next line, assemble the appropriate bit patterns to draw for those objects, and write the pattern into the register. In a telling reveal of its Pong heritage, by default, the right side of the screen is a mirrored duplicate of the left; to control it separately, the software may modify the patterns as the scan line is drawn. After the controller scans the last active line, a more leisurely <a href="vertical%20blanking%20interval">vertical blanking interval</a> begins, during which the game can process inputs and update the positions & states of objects in the game world. Any mistake in timing produces visual artifacts, a problem that programmers call "racing the beam".

The 2600's video hardware is therefore highly flexible, but also challenging to program. One advantage the 2600 has over more powerful contemporary competitors such as the <a href="ColecoVision">ColecoVision</a> is that the 2600 has no protection against altering settings in mid-line. For example, although each sprite nominally has only one color, it is possible to color the rows differently by changing the sprite's color as it is drawn. If the two hardware sprites are not enough for a game, a developer may share one sprite among several objects (as with the ghosts in "<a href="Pac-Man%20%28Atari%202600%29">Pac-Man</a>") or draw software sprites, which is only a little more difficult than drawing a fixed playfield. The "<a href="Pitfall%21">Pitfall!</a>" screenshot below (section: "Games") demonstrates some of these tricks: the player is a multicolor sprite, one sprite is multiplexed for the logs and the scorpion, and the swinging vine is drawn by shifting the position of the "ball" on each scan line. Despite the hardware limitations, many Atari 2600 games have a lot of action on the screen, creating an engaging experience. Furthermore, the Atari 2600 was one of the first consoles to introduce video game cartridges instead of having hardwired games built into it, allowing for the play of multiple different games rather than the usual one built in.

The Atari originally shipped with two types of controllers, a joystick as well as a pair of paddle controllers. Later, new controllers were added to the game system including a driving controller, a trak-ball controller, and finally keypad controllers. Additionally, the 2600 supports several types of input devices as well as third-party peripherals. Because the <a href="Atari%20joystick%20port">Atari joystick port</a> and <a href="CX40%20joystick">CX40 joystick</a> became industry standards, many peripherals are interchangeable with the <a href="MSX">MSX</a> and other Japanese systems, the <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a>, <a href="Commodore%20128">Commodore 128</a>, <a href="Amiga">Amiga</a>, <a href="Sega%20Master%20System">Sega Master System</a>, and <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Mega Drive/Genesis</a>, though functionality may be somewhat limited. Also, although Master System and Mega Drive/Genesis controllers work on the Atari 2600, only the "B" button can be used in most games. Another adapter is the <a href="Starpath%20Supercharger">Starpath Supercharger</a>, an add-on created by Starpath to expand the game capabilities of the Atari 2600. The Supercharger's interface adds an extra 6 kB to the Atari 2600's 128 bytes of RAM, allowing for larger games with higher-resolution graphics. A cord coming out of the side of the cartridge plugs into the earphone jack of any standard cassette player. Games for the Supercharger are stored on standard audio cassettes.

Third-party accessories include Wico's Command Control joystick.

The console was designed by Fred Thompson, and the controller was designed by Kevin McKinsey. 

The Atari 2600 uses different color palettes depending on the television signal format used. With the NTSC format, a 128-color palette is available, while in PAL, only 104 colors are available. Additionally, the <a href="SECAM">SECAM</a> palette consists of only 8 colors.

In 1977, nine games were released on cartridge to accompany the launch of the machine, including Air-Sea Battle, Star Ship and Street Racer. During the console's lifetime, Atari, Inc. and Atari Corp. published many titles: these games included "<a href="Adventure%20%28Atari%202600%29">Adventure</a>" (often credited as starting the <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure game</a> genre), "<a href="Breakout%20%28video%20game%29%23Ports">Breakout</a>", and "<a href="Yars%27%20Revenge">Yars' Revenge</a>". The console's popularity attracted many third-party developers, which led to popular titles such as <a href="Activision">Activision</a>'s "<a href="Pitfall%21">Pitfall!</a>" and <a href="Imagic">Imagic</a>'s "<a href="Atlantis%20%28video%20game%29">Atlantis</a>". However, two Atari published titles, "<a href="E.T.%20the%20Extra-Terrestrial%20%28video%20game%29">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a>" and "<a href="Pac-Man%20%28Atari%202600%29">Pac-Man</a>", are frequently blamed for contributing to the <a href="video%20game%20crash%20of%201983">video game crash of 1983</a>.

The Atari 2600 was wildly successful and, during much of the 1980s, "Atari" was a synonym for this particular model in mainstream media and, <a href="metonymy">by extension</a>, for video games in general.

The Atari 2600 was inducted into the <a href="National%20Toy%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Toy Hall of Fame</a> at <a href="The%20Strong">The Strong</a> in <a href="Rochester%2C%20New%20York">Rochester, New York</a>, in 2007. In 2009, the Atari 2600 was named the second greatest video game console of all time by <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, who cited its remarkable role as the console behind both the first video game boom and the video game crash of 1983, and called it "the console that our entire industry is built upon".

The Atari 2000 (model number CX-2000) was a <a href="prototype">prototype</a> version of the Atari 2600 that was intended to be released as a cheaper alternative for children in 1982. Although identical in specification to the original 2600, the 2000 included built-in controllers and an innovative case design. The 2000 was originally intended to be black, but it was later recolored blue to appeal more to children. While Atari never officially stated the reason for not releasing the 2000, experts have cited the poor quality and durability of its built-in joysticks and the greater in-house popularity of the competing 2600 Jr. design as the most likely reasons.

Atari started work on a replacement to the 2600, called the Atari 3200, with codenames including Super Stella, Sylvia, and PAM (a note attached reads "Super Stella: Multipurpose"). The system was to have compatibility with Atari 2600 cartridges, and was rumored to be based on a 10-bit processor, although design documents shows it was to actually be based around the <a href="MOS%20Technology%206502">6502</a> 8-bit CPU. It was still unfinished when preliminary game programmers discovered that it was difficult to program. The project was cancelled, and Atari went with the second "System X", also titled PAM, that would later become the <a href="Atari%205200">Atari 5200</a>. Atari also cloned the Atari 3200 into the Sears Super Arcade II, but this was never released.

The console and its old and new games are very popular with collectors because of its significant impact on video game and consumer electronics history and also due to its nostalgic value for many people, along with a number of games that are still considered highly playable. In addition, modern Atari 2600 clones remain on the market. One example is the Atari Classics 10-in-1 TV Game, manufactured by <a href="Jakks%20Pacific">Jakks Pacific</a>, which <a href="Video%20game%20console%20emulator">emulates</a> the 2600 console, and includes converted versions of 10 games into a single Atari-brand-lookalike joystick with <a href="composite%20video">composite-video</a> outputs for connecting directly to modern televisions or VCRs. Another is the <a href="TV%20Boy">TV Boy</a>, which includes 127 games in an enlarged joypad.

The <a href="Atari%20Flashback%202">Atari Flashback 2</a> console, released in 2005, contains 40 games (with four additional programs unlockable by a <a href="cheat%20code">cheat code</a>). The console implements the original 2600 architecture and can be modified to play original 2600 cartridges by adding a cartridge port, and is also compatible with original 2600 controllers.

Many games for the Atari 2600 have detailed and easily identifiable music, and its distinctive sound makes it ideal for use in modern <a href="Lo-fi%20music">lo-fi</a> and <a href="industrial%20music">industrial music</a>. In 2002, <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a> musician and visual artist Paul Slocum developed a cartridge called Synthcart for the Atari 2600, which allows the user to turn an Atari 2600 into a two-voice synthesizer and drum machine. Adapters have also been developed by amateurs enabling the Atari 2600's use with <a href="MIDI">MIDI</a> devices. A number of bands, such as <a href="8%20Bit%20Weapon">8 Bit Weapon</a>, <a href="Black%20Moth%20Super%20Rainbow">Black Moth Super Rainbow</a> and Slocum's own band Tree Wave, use Synthcart to make modern music on the Atari 2600. Some <a href="effects%20unit">effects unit</a>s like the MXR Blue Box are often cited for their ability to produce an Atari-like sound. <a href="Phonte">Phonte</a> from the hip-hop group <a href="Little%20Brother%20%28band%29">Little Brother</a>, along with fellow lyricist Eccentric, formed a mock group named Unheralded Symmetrics, and recorded a tribute to the system, entitled "Atari 2600".

Atari 5200

The Atari 5200 SuperSystem, commonly known as the Atari 5200, is a <a href="home%20video%20game%20console">home video game console</a> that was introduced in 1982 by Atari Inc. as a higher-end complementary console for the popular <a href="Atari%202600">Atari 2600</a>. The 5200 was created to compete with the <a href="Intellivision">Intellivision</a>, but wound up more directly competing with the <a href="ColecoVision">ColecoVision</a> shortly after its release.

The 5200's internal hardware is almost identical to that of Atari's <a href="Atari%208-bit%20family">8-bit computers</a>, although software is not directly compatible between the two systems. The 5200's controllers have an analog <a href="joystick">joystick</a> and a <a href="numeric%20keypad">numeric keypad</a> along with start, pause and reset buttons. The 360-degree non-centering joystick was touted as offering more control than the eight-way joystick controller offered with the Atari 2600.

Much of the technology in the <a href="Atari%208-bit%20family">Atari 8-bit family</a> of <a href="home%20computer">home computer</a> systems was originally developed as a second-generation games console intended to replace the <a href="Atari%202600">2600</a>. However, as the system was reaching completion, the personal computer revolution was starting with the release of machines like the <a href="Commodore%20PET">Commodore PET</a>, <a href="TRS-80">TRS-80</a> and <a href="Apple%20II">Apple II</a>. These machines had less advanced hardware than the new Atari technology, but sold for much higher prices with associated higher profit margins. Atari's management decided to enter this market, and the technology was repackaged into the <a href="Atari%20400">Atari 400</a> and <a href="Atari%20800">800</a>. The chipset used in these machines was created with the mindset that the <a href="Atari%202600">2600</a> would likely be obsolete by the 1980 time frame.

Atari later decided to re-enter the games market with a design that closely matched their original 1978 specifications. In its prototype stage, the Atari 5200 was originally called the "Atari Video System X – Advanced Video Computer System", and was codenamed "Pam" after a female employee at <a href="Atari%20Inc.">Atari Inc.</a> It is also rumored that PAM actually stood for "Personal Arcade Machine", as the majority of games for the system ended up being arcade conversions. Actual working "Atari Video System X" machines, whose hardware is 100% identical to the Atari 5200 do exist, but are extremely rare.

The initial 1982 release of the system featured four controller ports, where nearly all other systems of the day had only one or two ports. The 5200 also featured a new style of controller with an analog <a href="joystick">joystick</a>, numeric keypad, two fire buttons on each side of the controller and game function keys for Start, Pause, and Reset. The 5200 also featured the innovation of the first automatic TV switchbox, allowing it to automatically switch from regular TV viewing to the game system signal when the system was activated. Previous RF adapters required the user to slide a switch on the adapter by hand. The <a href="radio%20frequency">RF</a> box was also where the power supply connected in a unique dual power/television signal setup similar to the <a href="RCA%20Studio%20II">RCA Studio II</a>'s. A single cable coming out of the 5200 plugged into the switch box and was used for both electricity and the television signal.

The 1983 revision of the Atari 5200 has two controller ports instead of four, and a change back to the more conventional separate power supply and standard non-autoswitching RF switch. It also has changes in the cartridge port address lines to allow for the <a href="Atari%202600">Atari 2600</a> adapter released that year. While the adapter was only made to work on the two-port version, modifications can be made to the four-port to make it line-compatible. In fact, towards the end of the four-port model's production run, there were a limited number of consoles produced which included these modifications. These consoles can be identified by an asterisk in their serial numbers.

The controller prototypes used in the electrical development lab employed a yoke and gimbal mechanism that came from an RC airplane controller kit. This simple design gave smooth linear control and was highly reliable. The design of the <a href="analog%20stick">analog joystick</a>, which used a weak rubber boot rather than springs to provide centering, proved to be ungainly and unreliable. They quickly became the <a href="Achilles%27%20heel">Achilles' heel</a> of the system because of their combination of an overly complex mechanical design with a very low-cost internal flex circuit system. Another major flaw of the controllers was that the design did not translate into a linear acceleration from the center through the arc of the stick travel. The controllers did, however, include a pause button, a unique feature at the time. Various third-party replacement joysticks were also released, including those made by Wico.

Atari Inc. released the Pro-Line <a href="trackball">Trak-Ball</a> controller for the system, which was used primarily for gaming titles such as "<a href="Centipede">Centipede</a>" and "<a href="Missile%20Command">Missile Command</a>". A paddle controller and an updated self-centering version of the original controller were also in development, but never made it to market.

Games shipped with plastic card overlays that snapped in over the keypad. The card would indicate which game functions, such as changing the view or vehicle speed, were assigned to each key.

The primary controller was ranked the 10th worst video game controller by <a href="IGN">IGN</a> editor Craig Harris. An editor for "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" said that their non-centering joysticks "rendered many games nearly unplayable".

The Atari 5200's internal design was extensively based on that of the 400/800 home computers. Software designed for one does not run on the other, although <a href="porting">porting</a> the source code is not difficult as long as it does not use computer-specific features. <a href="John%20J.%20Anderson">John J. Anderson</a> of "<a href="Creative%20Computing">Creative Computing</a>" alluded to the incompatibility being intentional, caused by rivalries between Atari's computer and console divisions.

Besides the 5200's lack of a <a href="computer%20keyboard">computer keyboard</a>, other differences include:

In 1987, <a href="Atari%20Corporation">Atari Corp.</a> released the <a href="XEGS">XE Game System</a> console, which was essentially a repackaged 65XE (the then-current iteration of the 8-bit computer line) with a detachable keyboard that could run home computer titles directly, unlike the 5200. Anderson wrote in 1984 that Atari could have released a console compatible with computer software in 1981.

The Atari 5200 did not fare well commercially, compared to its predecessor, the Atari 2600. While it touted superior graphics to the 2600 and Mattel's <a href="Intellivision">Intellivision</a>, the system was initially incompatible with the 2600's expansive library of games, and some market analysts have speculated that this hurt its sales, especially since an Atari 2600 cartridge adapter had been released for the <a href="Intellivision%20II">Intellivision II</a>. (A revised 2-port model was released in 1983, along with a game adapter that allowed gamers to play all 2600 games.) This lack of new games was due in part to a lack of funding, with Atari continuing to develop most of its games for the saturated 2600 market.

Many of the 5200's games appeared simply as updated versions of 2600 titles, which failed to excite consumers. Its pack-in game, "<a href="Super%20Breakout">Super Breakout</a>", was particularly criticized for not doing enough to demonstrate the system's capabilities, and this gave the ColecoVision a significant advantage when its pack-in, "<a href="Donkey%20Kong%20%28video%20game%29">Donkey Kong</a>", delivered a more authentic arcade experience than any previous game cartridge. In its list of the top 25 game consoles of all time, <a href="IGN">IGN</a> claimed that the main reason for the 5200's market failure was the technological superiority of its competitor, while other sources maintain that the two consoles are roughly equivalent in power.

The 5200 received much criticism for the "sloppy" design of its non-centering analog controllers. Anderson described the controllers as "absolutely atrocious".

At one point following the 5200's release, Atari had planned a smaller, cost-reduced version of the Atari 5200, which would have removed the controller storage bin. Code-named the "Atari 5100" (a.k.a. "Atari 5200 Jr."), only a few fully working prototype 5100s were made before the project was canceled.

On May 21, 1984, during a press conference at which the <a href="Atari%207800">Atari 7800</a> was introduced, company executives revealed that the 5200 had been discontinued after just two years on the market. Total sales of the 5200 were reportedly in excess of 1 million units.

Atari 7800

The Atari 7800 ProSystem, or simply the Atari 7800, is a <a href="home%20video%20game%20console">home video game console</a> officially released by <a href="Atari%20Corporation">Atari Corporation</a> in 1986. It is almost fully <a href="Backward%20compatibility">backward-compatible</a> with the <a href="Atari%202600">Atari 2600</a>, the first console to have backward compatibility without the use of additional modules. It was considered affordable at a price of US$140.

The 7800 has significantly improved graphics hardware over the 2600, but uses the same audio chip. It also shipped with a different model of joystick from the 2600-standard <a href="Atari%20CX40%20joystick">CX40</a>.

The 1986 launch is sometimes referred to as a "re-release" or "relaunch" because the Atari 7800 had originally been announced on May 21, 1984, to replace Atari Inc.'s <a href="Atari%205200">Atari 5200</a>, but a general release was shelved due to the sale of the company.

The Atari 7800 ProSystem was the first game system from Atari Inc. designed by an outside company, <a href="General%20Computer%20Corporation">General Computer Corporation</a> (GCC). The system was designed in 1983-84 with an intended mass market rollout in June 1984, but was canceled shortly thereafter due to the sale of the company to <a href="Jack%20Tramiel">Tramel Technology Ltd</a> on July 2, 1984. The project was originally called the Atari 3600, though was later renamed the Atari 7800.

Atari had been facing mounting pressure in the form of competition from the <a href="ColecoVision">ColecoVision</a>, which boasted graphics that more closely mirrored <a href="arcade%20game">arcade game</a>s of the time than Atari’s 2600 system. At the same time, the Atari 5200 (the original intended successor to the Atari 2600) had been widely criticized for not being able to play Atari 2600 games without an adapter.

GCC had a background in creating arcade games and designed their new system with a graphical architecture similar to arcade machines of the time. The 7800 allows a large number of moving objects (75 to 100). Powering the system is a slightly customized 6502 processor, the Atari SALLY (sometimes described as a "6502C"), running at 1.79 MHz. By some measures the 7800 is more powerful, and by others less, than Nintendo's 1983 <a href="Famicom">Famicom</a>. 

The 7800 was initially released in southern <a href="California">California</a> in June 1984, following an announcement on May 21, 1984 at the Summer <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a>. Thirteen games were announced for the system's launch: "<a href="Ms.%20Pac-Man">Ms. Pac-Man</a>", "<a href="Pole%20Position%20II">Pole Position II</a>", "<a href="Centipede%20%28video%20game%29">Centipede</a>", "<a href="Joust%20%28video%20game%29">Joust</a>", "<a href="Dig%20Dug">Dig Dug</a>", "<a href="Desert%20Falcon">Desert Falcon</a>", "", "<a href="Galaga">Galaga</a>", "<a href="Food%20Fight%20%28video%20game%29">Food Fight</a>", "<a href="Ballblazer">Ballblazer</a>", "<a href="Rescue%20on%20Fractalus%21">Rescue on Fractalus!</a>", "<a href="Track%20%26amp%3B%20Field%20%28video%20game%29">Track & Field</a>", and "<a href="Xevious">Xevious</a>". Atari was a sponsor of the <a href="1984%20Summer%20Olympics">1984 Summer Olympics</a> and planned to push the 7800 aggressively in time for Christmas that year. 

On July 2, 1984, <a href="Time%20Warner">Warner Communications</a> sold Atari's Consumer Division to <a href="Jack%20Tramiel">Jack Tramiel</a>. All projects were halted during an initial evaluation period. Modern publications have often incorrectly asserted that Jack Tramiel mothballed the Atari 7800, feeling video games were a past fad, and subsequently asserted that he dusted off the Atari 7800 once the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">NES</a> became successful. The reality was that a contractual issue arose in that GCC had not been paid for their development of the 7800. Warner and Tramiel battled back and forth over who was accountable, with Tramiel believing that the 7800 should have been covered as part of his acquisition deal. In May 1985, Jack relented and paid GCC the overdue payment. This led to additional negotiations regarding the initial launch titles that GCC had developed and then an effort to find someone to lead their new video game division, which was completed in November 1985.

The original production run of the Atari 7800 languished on warehouse shelves until it was re-introduced in January 1986, after strong 2600 sales the previous Christmas. The console was released nationwide in May 1986 for $79.95.

Atari's launch of the 7800 under Tramiel was far more subdued than Warner had planned for the system in 1984 with a marketing budget of just $300,000. Additionally, the keyboard and high score cartridge were canceled, the expansion port was removed from later production runs of the system and, in lieu of new titles, the system was launched with titles intended for the 7800's debut in 1984.

By the end of 1986, Computer Entertainer claimed the Atari 7800 had sold 100,000 consoles in the United States, less than the <a href="Sega%20Master%20System">Sega Master System</a>'s 125,000 and the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>'s 1.1 million. According to Atari, due to manufacturing problems, it only managed to produce and sell 100,000 units by 1986, including units that had been in a warehouse since 1984. A common complaint in 1986 was a lack of games, including a gap of months between new releases ("<a href="Galaga">Galaga</a>"s release in August was followed by "<a href="Xevious">Xevious</a>" in November). By the end of 1986, the 7800 had 10 games, compared to Sega's 20 and Nintendo's 36; nine of the NES games were third-party, whereas the 7800 and Master System had no third-party games. A reason cited for the lack of third-party interest in the 7800 was its small 100,000 install base and low market penetration.

Atari's lineup for the 7800 emphasized high-quality versions of popular arcade games like "<a href="Joust%20%28video%20game%29">Joust</a>" and "<a href="Asteroids%20%28video%20game%29">Asteroids</a>". This had been a primary reason for the success of the Atari 2600, but "Joust" was four years old in 1986, and "Asteroids" seven.

During the Atari 7800’s life cycle, Atari found themselves struggling to get developers to create 7800 versions of then-popular arcade titles because of a controversial policy employed by Nintendo. When Nintendo entered the industry, it signed up software development companies to create <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> games under a strict license agreement which imposed serious restrictions on what they were allowed to do. One of the key clauses was that companies who made Nintendo games were not allowed to make that game on a competing system for a period of two years. Because of the market success of the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, companies chose to develop for it first and were thus barred from developing the same games on competing systems for two years. The software libraries of the Atari 7800 and Sega Master System suffered tremendously as a result.

Eleven titles were developed and sold by three third-party companies under their own labels for the 7800 (<a href="Absolute%20Entertainment">Absolute Entertainment</a>, <a href="Activision">Activision</a>, and <a href="Froggo">Froggo</a>) with the rest published by Atari themselves. However, most Atari development was contracted out.

Some NES titles were developed by companies who had licensed their title from a different arcade manufacturer. While the creator of the NES version would be restricted from making a competitive version of an NES game, the original arcade copyright holder was not precluded from licensing out rights for a home version of an arcade game to multiple systems. Through this loophole, Atari 7800 conversions of "<a href="Mario%20Bros.">Mario Bros.</a>", "<a href="Double%20Dragon">Double Dragon</a>", "<a href="Commando%20%28video%20game%29">Commando</a>", "<a href="Rampage%20%28video%20game%29">Rampage</a>", "<a href="Xenophobe%20%28video%20game%29">Xenophobe</a>", "<a href="Ikari%20Warriors">Ikari Warriors</a>", and "<a href="Kung-Fu%20Master">Kung-Fu Master</a>" were licensed and developed.

By June 1988, the Atari 7800 had sold more than 1 million units worldwide.

The Atari 7800 remained officially active in the United States between 1986 and 1991 and in Europe between 1989 and 1991. On January 1, 1992, Atari Corp. formally announced that production of the Atari 7800, the Atari 2600, the Atari 8-bit computer line, and the Atari XE Game System would cease. (It has since been discovered that Atari Corp. continued to develop games such as "<a href="Toki%20%28video%20game%29">Toki</a>" for the Atari 7800 until all development was shut down in May 1993.<a href="http%3A//betaphasegames.com/7800_Toki_Screens.html"></a>) By the time of the cancellation, Nintendo's NES dominated the North American market, controlling 80% while Atari Corp. controlled just 12%.

Despite trailing the Nintendo Entertainment System in terms of number of units sold, the 7800 was a profitable enterprise for Atari Corp., benefiting largely from Atari’s name and the system's 2600 compatibility. Profits were strong owing to low investment in game development and marketing.


The graphics are generated by a custom graphics chip called MARIA, which uses an approach to graphics commonly used in <a href="arcade%20game">arcade game</a> <a href="Arcade%20system%20board">system boards</a> at the time. It was very different from other <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28second%20generation%29">second</a> and <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28third%20generation%29">third generation</a> consoles. Instead of a limited number of hardware sprites, MARIA allows for a much larger number of sprites described in a series of <a href="display%20list">display list</a>s. Each display list contains sprite entries with pointers to graphics data, color information, and horizontal positioning. The same display list is used for multiple rasters with the pointers being automatically adjusted. However, managing and displaying a large number of sprites required much more <a href="CPU">CPU</a> time (both directly and indirectly since the MARIA would halt the CPU when drawing sprites) than consoles with hardware sprites and backgrounds.

MARIA has a number of different graphics modes which are either 160 pixels wide or 320 pixels wide. While the 320 pixel modes theoretically enable the 7800 to create games at higher resolution than the 256 pixel wide graphics found in the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> and <a href="Sega%20Master%20System">Sega Master System</a>, the intense processing demands of MARIA typically meant that programmers created their games using the lower 160 pixel modes.

The 7800 features a broad (for its time) palette of 256 colors. Depending on various parameters, each individual sprite can use from 1 to 12 colors, with 3 colors (plus a 4th "transparency" color) being the most common. In this format, the sprite is referenced to one of 8 palettes, where each palette holds 3 assignable colors. There is also an assignable background color, which will be visible wherever another object has not covered it up. In total the system can utilize 25 colors on a scanline at one time.

The graphics resolution, color palette assignments, and background color can be adjusted in between scanlines. This technique is documented in the original 1983 "Atari 3600 Software Guide". Games often used this feature to render high resolution text in one area of the screen, while displaying more colorful graphics with less resolution in the gameplay area. Demos also exist which use this feature to place all 256 colors on the screen at the same time.

The MARIA’s approach had advantages and disadvantages when it came to generating graphics in software during the lifespan of the 7800. It excelled at moving around large numbers of sprites on a static screen without the screen flickering that plagued other 8-bit systems. Its flexible design enabled it to play games which used display list manipulation to generate a pseudo 3D appearance such as "<a href="Ballblazer">Ballblazer</a>" (1987) and "F-18 Hornet" (1988). While side-scrolling games in the vein of "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Bros.">Super Mario Bros.</a>" are possible on the system (1990's "Scrapyard Dog" is the best example), it is significantly harder to develop such a title than on a tile-based system such as the Nintendo Entertainment System.

A common criticism of the 7800 regards its use of the TIA to provide 2-channel sound effects and music, resulting in sound quality that is virtually identical to the Atari 2600 VCS from 1977. While the inclusion of 2600 hardware is required to maintain compatibility with the older system, this drove up production costs and reduced available space on the 7800’s motherboard. As such, the 7800 does not include additional hardware for generating sound as it does with graphics and the sound hardware is considered the weakest part of the system.

To compensate for this, GCC’s engineers allowed games to include a <a href="Atari%20POKEY">POKEY audio chip</a> in the cartridge which substantially improved the audio quality. To ensure software developers had an economical means of producing better sound than TIA, GCC had originally planned to make a low-cost, high performance sound chip, GUMBY, which could also be placed in 7800 cartridges to enhance its sound capabilities further. This project was cancelled when Atari was sold to Jack Tramiel.

Despite having the capability to support sound chips in cartridges, almost no 7800 cartridges feature POKEY hardware for enhanced sound. "Ballblazer", released in 1987, uses the POKEY to generate all music and sound effects. Similarly, "<a href="Commando%20%28video%20game%29">Commando</a>", released in 1989, uses a POKEY to generate in-game music while the TIA generates the game's sound effects for a total of 6 channels of sound.

Following the debate over "<a href="Custer%27s%20Revenge">Custer's Revenge</a>", an Atari 2600 VCS title with adult themes, Atari had concerns over similar adult titles finding their way onto the 7800 and displaying adult content using the significantly improved graphics capabilities of the MARIA chip. To combat this, they included a digital signature protection method which prevented unauthorized 7800 games from being played on the system.

When a cartridge was inserted into the system, the 7800 BIOS included code which would generate a digital signature of the cartridge ROM and compare it to the signature stored on the cartridge. If a correct signature was located on the cartridge, the 7800 would operate in 7800 mode, granting the game access to MARIA and other features. If a signature was not located, the 7800 remained in 2600 mode and MARIA was unavailable. All 7800 games released in North America had to be digitally signed by Atari. This digital signature code is not present in PAL 7800s, which use various heuristics to detect 2600 cartridges, due to export restrictions. The signing utility was found and released by Classic Gaming Expo in 2001.

The Atari 7800 differs from the 2600 in several key areas. It features a full Atari SALLY 6502 processor whereas the 2600 VCS has a stripped-down 6507 processor running at a slower speed. It has additional <a href="RAM">RAM</a> (Random Access Memory) and the ability to access more cartridge data at one time than the 2600. The most substantial difference, however, is a graphics architecture which differs markedly from either the Atari 2600 VCS or Atari’s 8-bit line of computers.

The 7800's compatibility with the Atari 2600 is made possible by including many of the same chips used in the Atari 2600. When operating in “2600” mode to play Atari 2600 titles, the 7800 uses a Television Interface Adapter (TIA) chip to generate graphics and sound. The processor is slowed to 1.19 MHz, enabling the 7800 to mirror the performance of the 2600's stripped-down 6507 processor. RAM is limited to 128 bytes found in the RIOT and game data is accessed in 4K blocks.

When in “7800” mode (signified by the appearance of the full-screen Atari logo), the graphics are generated entirely by the MARIA graphics processing unit, all system RAM is available and game data is accessed in larger 48K blocks. The system’s SALLY 6502 runs at its normal 1.79 MHz instead of the reduced speed of 2600 mode. The 2600 chips are used in 7800 mode to generate sound as well as switch and controller interfaces.

The Atari 7800 does not support backward compatibility for Atari 5200 games or accessories.

Prototypes:

Production:

The Atari 7800 came bundled with the Atari Proline Joystick, a two button controller with a <a href="joystick">joystick</a> for movement. In response to criticism over ergonomic issues in the 7800’s Pro-Line controllers, Atari later released joypad controllers with European 7800s, which were similar in style to controllers found on Nintendo and Sega Systems. The Joypad was not available in the United States.

There were few add-on peripherals for the 7800, though its backwards compatibility feature allowed it to use most Atari 2600 peripherals. The XG-1 lightgun, which came bundled with the <a href="Atari%20XEGS">Atari XEGS</a>, was sold separately for other Atari systems and was fully compatible with the 7800. Atari released four 7800 light gun games: "<a href="Alien%20Brigade">Alien Brigade</a>", "<a href="Crossbow%20%28video%20game%29">Crossbow</a>", "Meltdown", and "Barnyard Blaster".

After the acquisition of the Atari Consumer Division by <a href="Jack%20Tramiel">Jack Tramiel</a> in 1984, a number of planned peripherals for the system were canceled.


While the 7800 can actually play hundreds of titles due to its compatibility with the Atari 2600, there was limited third party support for the 7800 and fewer than 100 titles were specifically designed for it.

The source code for 13 games, as well as the OS and development tools (for the <a href="Atari%20ST">Atari ST</a> computer system) were discovered in a dumpster behind the Atari building in Sunnyvale, California. Commented <a href="assembly%20language">assembly language</a> source code was made available for "<a href="Centipede%20%28video%20game%29">Centipede</a>", "Commando", "Crossbow", "Desert Falcon", "<a href="Dig%20Dug">Dig Dug</a>", "<a href="Food%20Fight%20%28video%20game%29">Food Fight</a>", "<a href="Galaga">Galaga</a>", "<a href="Hat%20Trick%20%28video%20game%29">Hat Trick</a>", "<a href="Joust%20%28video%20game%29">Joust</a>", "<a href="Ms.%20Pac-Man">Ms. Pac-Man</a>", "Super Stunt Cycle", "Robotron: 2084" and "<a href="Xevious">Xevious</a>" game titles.

When emulators of 1980s video game consoles began to appear on home computers in the late 1990s, the Atari 7800 was one of the last to be emulated. The lack of awareness of the system, the lack of understanding of the hardware, and fears about the digital signature lockout initially caused concerns. Since that time, however, the 7800 has been emulated successfully and is now common on emulation sites. One such program is ProSystem, written in C/C++ for the <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> operating system. It uses the Windows API and DirectX to display what it emulates in both <a href="PAL">PAL</a> and <a href="NTSC">NTSC</a>.

The digital signature long prevented homebrew games from being developed until the original encryption generating software was discovered. When the original digital signature generating software was turned over to the Atari community, development of new Atari 7800 titles began. In addition, the Atari community has slowly uncovered the original 7800 development tools and released them into the public domain. New tools, documentation, source code and utilities for development have since been created which has sponsored additional homebrew development. Several new commercial Atari 7800 titles such as "Beef Drop", "B*nQ", "Pac-Man Collection", "Combat 1990", "Santa Simon", and "Space War" have been created and released.

In 2004, Atari (now owned by <a href="Infogrames%20Entertainment%2C%20SA">Infogrames</a>) released the first <a href="Atari%20Flashback">Atari Flashback</a> console. This system resembled a miniature Atari 7800 and joysticks and had 20 built in games (five 7800 and fifteen 2600 titles). While the unit sold well, it was controversial among Atari fans. Atari had given the engineering firm, Legacy Engineering, extremely limited development timelines. The firm was forced to build the Flashback using <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System%20hardware%20clone">NES-On-A-Chip</a> hardware instead of recreating the Atari 7800 hardware. As a result, the Flashback has been criticized for failing to properly replicate the actual Atari gaming experience.

Legacy Engineering was later commissioned to create another 7800 project that was subsequently cancelled after prototypes were made.

Atari Jaguar

The Atari Jaguar is a <a href="home%20video%20game%20console">home video game console</a> that was developed by <a href="Atari%20Corporation">Atari Corporation</a>. The console was the sixth and last programmable console to be developed under the <a href="Atari">Atari</a> brand, originally released in North America in November 1993. Controversially, Atari marketed the Jaguar as being the first <a href="64-bit">64-bit</a> video game console, while competing with the existing 16-bit consoles (<a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> and <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>) and the 32-bit <a href="3DO%20Interactive%20Multiplayer">3DO Interactive Multiplayer</a> platform (which launched the same year).

Development on the Atari Jaguar started in the early 1990s, and was designed by <a href="Flare%20Technology">Flare Technology</a>, who were tasked by Atari to create two consoles; the <a href="Atari%20Panther">Atari Panther</a>, which would compete with the Genesis and the Super NES, and a successor, the Jaguar, which would surpass the capabilities of any other console on the market at the time. With development of the Jaguar running ahead of schedule, the Panther was cancelled, and the release of the Jaguar was pushed forward. It was originally released to test markets in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> in November 1993, and to the general public in 1994, with "<a href="Cybermorph">Cybermorph</a>" as the <a href="pack-in%20game">pack-in</a> launch game.

The console's multi-chip architecture made game development for the console difficult, and underwhelming sales further contributed to the console's lack of third party support. This, in addition to the lack of internal development at Atari, led to a limited games library, comprising only 67 licensed titles.

Atari attempted to extend the lifespan of the Jaguar by releasing a <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> <a href="Video%20game%20accessory">add-on</a> known as the <a href="Atari%20Jaguar%20CD">Atari Jaguar CD</a> and marketing the Jaguar as the low-cost next generation console, with a price tag over $100 less than any of its competitors. With the release of the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a> and <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony</a>'s <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> in 1995, sales of the Jaguar continued to fall, ultimately selling no more than 250,000 units before it was discontinued in 1996. The Jaguar was deemed a <a href="List%20of%20commercial%20failures%20in%20video%20gaming">commercial failure</a>, and prompted Atari to leave the home video game console market. After <a href="Hasbro%20Interactive">Hasbro Interactive</a> bought out Atari in the late 1990s, the patents to the Jaguar were released into the <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a>, with the console being declared an open platform. Since then, the Jaguar has gained a cult following, with a developer base that produces <a href="homebrew%20%28video%20games%29">homebrew games</a> for the console.

The Jaguar was developed by the members of <a href="Flare%20Technology">Flare Technology</a>, a company formed by <a href="Martin%20Brennan%20%28engineer%29">Martin Brennan</a> and <a href="John%20Mathieson%20%28computer%20scientist%29">John Mathieson</a>. The team had claimed that they could not only make a console superior to the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Genesis</a> or the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super NES</a>, but they could also be cost-effective. Impressed by their work on the <a href="Konix%20Multisystem">Konix Multisystem</a>, Atari persuaded them to close Flare and form a new company called <a href="Flare%20Technology">Flare II</a>, with Atari providing the funding. Flare II initially set to work designing two consoles for Atari Corp. One was a 32-bit architecture (codenamed "<a href="Atari%20Panther">Panther</a>"), and the other was a 64-bit system (codenamed "Jaguar"); however, work on the Jaguar design progressed faster than expected, so Atari Corp. canceled the Panther project to focus on the more promising Jaguar.

The Jaguar was unveiled in August 1993 at the Chicago Consumer Entertainment Show.

The Jaguar was introduced in 1993 at a price of $249.99, under a $500 million manufacturing deal with <a href="IBM">IBM</a>. The system was initially available only in the <a href="test%20market">test market</a>s of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, under the slogan "Do the Math", claiming superiority over competing 16-bit and 32-bit systems. A U.S.-wide release followed six months later, in early 1994.

The Atari Jaguar struggled to attain a substantial user base. In 1993, Atari reported that it had shipped 17,000 units as part of the system's initial test market. By the end of 1994, Atari reported that it had sold approximately 100,000 systems and had reduced the price to improve the competitive nature of the console. By the end of 1995, <a href="Sony">Sony</a> and <a href="Sega">Sega</a> had entered the marketplace with competing consoles and Atari's sales declined rapidly. In Atari's 1995 annual report, it noted:

"Jaguar sales were substantially below Atari's expectations, and Atari's business and financial results were materially adversely affected in 1995 as Atari continued to invest heavily in Jaguar game development, entered into arrangements to publish certain licensed titles and reduced the retail price for its Jaguar console unit. Atari attributes the poor performance of Jaguar to a number of factors including (i) extensive delays in development of software for the Jaguar which resulted in reduced orders due to consumer concern as to when titles for the platform would be released and how many titles would ultimately be available, and (ii) the introduction of competing products by Sega and Sony in May 1995 and September 1995, respectively."

The lack of titles was attributable to two main factors: the Jaguar's questionable long-term prospects among third-party game-publishers and the problematic nature of developing games for the Jaguar. Atari had one opportunity to convince third-party developers, vital for the diversity of Jaguar's game library, with a solid retail-performance, but as things played out, post-holiday sales figures questioned the viability of Atari's business; Atari failed to attract many third-party developers already committed to other game platforms. In addition, the Jaguar's underlying hardware was crippled by a flaw in the CPU's <a href="memory%20controller">memory controller</a>, which prevented code execution out of system <a href="Random-access%20memory">RAM</a>. Less severe defects included a buggy <a href="Universal%20asynchronous%20receiver/transmitter">UART</a>. The memory controller flaw could have been mitigated by a mature code-development environment, to unburden the programmer from having to micromanage small chunks of code. Jaguar's development tools left much to the programmer's own implementation, as documentation was incomplete. Writing game-code was often an endurance exercise in the tedious <a href="assembly%20language">assembler</a>.

In a July 1995 interview with "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>", then-CEO Sam Tramiel declared that the Jaguar was as powerful, if not more powerful, than the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a>, and slightly weaker than the <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a>. "Next Generation" received a deluge of letters in response to Tramiel's comments, particularly his threat to bring Sony to court for <a href="dumping%20%28pricing%20policy%29">price dumping</a> if the PlayStation entered the U.S. market at a retail price below $300 and his remark that the small number of third party Jaguar games was good for Atari's profitability (which angered Jaguar owners who were already frustrated at how few games were coming out for the system).

In a last-ditch effort to revive the Jaguar, Atari Corp. tried to play down the other two consoles by proclaiming the Jaguar was the only "64-bit" system. This claim is questioned by some, because the <a href="Central%20processing%20unit">CPU</a> (<a href="Motorola%2068000">68000</a>) and <a href="Graphics%20processing%20unit">GPU</a> executed a 32-bit instruction-set, but sent control signals to the 64-bit graphics co-processors (or "graphics accelerators"). Atari Corp.'s reasoning that the 32-bit "Tom" and "Jerry" chips work in tandem to add up to a 64-bit system was ridiculed in a mini-editorial by "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>", which commented that "If Sega did the math for the Sega Saturn the way Atari did the math for their 64-bit Jaguar system, the Sega Saturn would be a 112-bit monster of a machine." On the other side, "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>", while giving a mostly negative review of the Jaguar, maintained that it is a true 64-bit system, since the data path from the <a href="DRAM">DRAM</a> to the CPU and Tom and Jerry chips is 64 bits wide. Design specs for the console allude to the GPU or DSP being capable of acting as a CPU, leaving the Motorola 68000 to read controller inputs. In practice, however, many developers used the Motorola 68000 to drive gameplay logic.

By the end of 1995, Atari's revenues declined by more than half, from US$38.7 million in 1994 to $14.6 million in 1995. In late 1995, Atari Corp. ran early-morning <a href="infomercial">infomercial</a> advertisements with enthusiastic salesmen touting the powerful game system. The infomercials ran most of the year, but did not significantly sell the remaining stock of Jaguar systems. By November 1995, mass layoffs and insider statements were fueling journalistic speculation that Atari had ceased both development and manufacturing for the Jaguar and was simply trying to sell off existing stock before exiting the video game industry. Though Atari Corp. continued to deny these theories going into 1996, core Jaguar developers such as <a href="High%20Voltage%20Software">High Voltage Software</a> and <a href="Beyond%20Games">Beyond Games</a> stated that they were no longer receiving communications from Atari regarding Jaguar projects. In its <a href="Form%2010-K405">10-K405 SEC Filing</a>, filed April 12, 1996, Atari informed their stockholders of the truly dire nature of the Jaguar business: 

The filing also confirmed the longstanding theory that Atari had given up on the Jaguar in late 1995, and in the subsequent months were concerned chiefly with liquidating its inventory of Jaguar products. On April 8, 1996, Atari Corp. merged with <a href="JT%20Storage">JT Storage</a> in a <a href="reverse%20takeover">reverse takeover</a>.

From the Jaguar Software Reference manual, page 1:

Jaguar is a custom chip set primarily intended to be the heart of a very high-performance games/leisure computer. It may also be used as a graphics accelerator in more complex systems, and applied to workstation and business uses. As well as a general purpose CPU, Jaguar contains four processing units. These are the Object Processor, Graphics Processor, Blitter, and Digital Sound Processor. Jaguar provides these blocks with a 64-bit data path to external memory devices, and is capable of a very high data transfer rate into external dynamic RAM.



<a href="Atari%20Games">Atari Games</a> licensed the Atari Jaguar's chipset for use in its arcade games. The system, named COJAG (for "Coin-Op Jaguar"), replaced the <a href="Motorola%2068000">68000</a> with a <a href="Motorola%2068020">68020</a> or <a href="MIPS%20Technologies">MIPS</a> <a href="R3000">R3000</a>-based CPU (depending on the board version), and added a hard drive and more RAM. It ran the lightgun games "<a href="Area%2051%20%281995%20video%20game%29">Area 51</a>" and "<a href="Maximum%20Force">Maximum Force</a>", which were released by Atari as dedicated cabinets or as the Area 51/Maximum Force combo machine. Other games ("3 On 3 Basketball"; "Fishin' Frenzy"; "Freeze"; "Vicious Circle") were developed but never released.

The Atari Jaguar Duo was a proposed console similar to the <a href="TurboDuo">TurboDuo</a> and <a href="Sega%20Genesis%23Variations">Genesis CDX</a>. It was an attempt by <a href="Atari">Atari</a> to combine the Atari Jaguar and <a href="Atari%20Jaguar%20CD">Atari Jaguar CD</a> to make a new console. A prototype model, described by journalists as resembling a <a href="bathroom%20scale">bathroom scale</a>, was unveiled at the 1995 Winter <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a>, but the console was cancelled before production could begin.

Prior to the launch of the console in November 1993, Atari had announced a variety of peripherals and add-ons for the Jaguar to be released over the console's lifespan. This included a <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a>-based add-on console, a <a href="Dial-up%20Internet%20access">dial-up internet link</a> with support for online gaming, a <a href="virtual%20reality">virtual reality</a> headset, and an <a href="MPEG-2">MPEG-2</a> video card. However, due to the poor sales and eventual commercial failure of the Jaguar, most of the peripherals in development were scrapped. The only peripherals and add-ons released by Atari for the Jaguar were a redesigned controller, an adapter for <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">four-players</a>, a CD console add-on and a link cable for <a href="Local%20area%20network">Local area network</a> (LAN) gaming.

The redesigned second controller for the Jaguar, the ProController by Atari, added three more face buttons and two triggers. The controller was created in response to the criticism of the original controller that the console came with. Sold independently, however, it was never bundled with the system after its release. A peripheral that allowed 4 controllers to be plugged into the console was also released. Dubbed the "Team Tap", it was released independently and as a bundle with "<a href="White%20Men%20Can%27t%20Jump%20%28video%20game%29">White Men Can't Jump</a>". However, the Team Tap was only compatible with "White Men Can't Jump" and "<a href="NBA%20Jam%20Tournament%20Edition">NBA Jam Tournament Edition</a>". Eight player gameplay with the Team Tap peripheral is also possible if a second Team Tap is plugged into the second controller port on the console, but neither of the compatible games supports eight players. Local area network multiplayer gameplay was achieved through the use of the Jaglink Interface, which allowed two Jaguar consoles to be linked together through a modular extension and a <a href="Twisted%20pair%23Unshielded%20twisted%20pair">UTP</a> phone cable. The Jaglink was compatible with three games: "AirCars", "<a href="BattleSphere">BattleSphere</a>" and "<a href="Doom%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Doom</a>".

In 1994 at the CES, Atari announced that it partnered up with Phylon, Inc. to create the Jaguar Voice/Data Communicator. The unit was delayed and eventually in 1995 mass production was canceled all together, but not before an estimated 100 or so were made. The JVM as it became known, utilized a 19.9kbit/s dial up modem and had the ability to answer incoming phone calls and store up to 18 phone numbers. Players were required to directly dial each other for online game play. The only Jaguar game that supports the JVM is <a href="Ultra%20Vortek">Ultra Vortek</a>, the modem is initialized in the Ultra Vortek start up screen by entering 911 on the key pad.

The Atari Jaguar CD is an add-on to the Jaguar that made use of <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a>s to distribute games. It was released in September 1995, two years after the Jaguar's launch. Twelve games were released for the system during its manufacturing lifetime, with more being made after by <a href="Homebrew%20%28video%20games%29">homebrew</a> developers. Each Jaguar CD unit came with a <a href="Virtual%20Light%20Machine">Virtual Light Machine</a>, which displayed light patterns corresponding to music, if the user inserts an audio CD into the console. It was developed by <a href="Jeff%20Minter">Jeff Minter</a>, who had created the program after experimenting with graphics during the development of "<a href="Tempest%202000">Tempest 2000</a>". The program was deemed a spiritual successor to the <a href="Atari%20Video%20Music">Atari Video Music</a>, a system which served a similar purpose, released in 1976.

An additional accessory for the Jaguar CD, which allowed Jaguar CD games to save persistent data such as preferences and saved games, was also released. Known as the Memory Track, it was a cartridge that contained a 128 K <a href="EEPROM">EEPROM</a>, and was to be inserted into the cartridge slot on the Jaguar CD while the user played a Jaguar CD game. The program manager for the Memory Track is accessed by pushing the option button while the system is starting, and exited by pushing the * and # keys simultaneously. There were plans to make a second model of the Jaguar console that combined both the Jaguar and the Jaguar CD into one unit, a la the <a href="TurboDuo">TurboDuo</a>. Originally codenamed the Jaguar III, and later the Jaguar Duo, the proposed model was scrapped after the discontinuation of the Jaguar.

A <a href="virtual%20reality">virtual reality</a> headset compatible with the console, tentatively titled the Jaguar VR, was unveiled by Atari at the 1995 Winter <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a>. The development of the peripheral was a response to <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s virtual reality console, the <a href="Virtual%20Boy">Virtual Boy</a>, which had been announced the previous year. The headset was developed in cooperation with <a href="Virtuality%20%28gaming%29">Virtuality</a>, who had previously created many virtual reality <a href="arcade%20game">arcade systems</a>, and was already developing a similar headset for practical purposes, named <a href="Virtuality%20%28gaming%29%23Project%20Elysium">Project Elysium</a>, for <a href="IBM">IBM</a>. The peripheral was targeted for a commercial release before Christmas 1995. However, the deal with Virtuality was abandoned in October 1995. After Atari's merger with <a href="JT%20Storage">JTS</a> in 1996, all prototypes of the headset were allegedly destroyed. However, two working units, one low-resolution prototype with red and grey-colored graphics, and one high-resolution prototype with blue and grey-colored graphics, have since been recovered, and are regularly showcased at <a href="retrogaming">retrogaming</a>-themed conventions and festivals. Only one game was developed for the Jaguar VR prototype; a 3D-rendered version of the 1980 arcade game "<a href="Missile%20Command">Missile Command</a>", entitled "<a href="Missile%20Command%203D">Missile Command 3D</a>", though a demo of Virtuality's "Zone Hunter" was also created for Jaguar VR demonstrations.

An unofficial expansion peripheral for the Atari Jaguar dubbed the "Catbox" was released by the <a href="Rockford%2C%20Illinois">Rockford, Illinois</a> company ICD. It was originally slated to be released early in the Jaguar's life, in the second quarter of 1994, but was not actually released until mid-1995. The ICD CatBox plugs directly into the AV/DSP connectors located in the rear of the Jaguar console and provides three main functions. These are audio, video, and communications. It features six output formats, three for audio (<a href="Line%20level">line level stereo</a>, RGB monitor, <a href="Headphones">headphone</a> jack with volume control) and three for video (<a href="Composite%20video">composite</a>, <a href="S-Video">S-Video</a>, and <a href="RGB%20color%20model">RGB analog component video</a>) making the Jaguar compatible with multiple high quality monitor systems and multiple monitors at the same time. It is capable of communications methods known as CatNet and <a href="RS-232">RS-232</a> as well as <a href="Digital%20signal%20processor">DSP</a> pass through, allowing the user to connect two or more Jaguars together for multi player games either directly or with modems. The ICD CatBox features a polished stainless steel casing and red <a href="Light-emitting%20diode">LED</a>s in the jaguar's eyes on the logo that indicate communications activity. An <a href="IBM%20Personal%20Computer/AT">IBM AT</a> type null modem cable may be used to connect two Jaguars together. The CatBox is also compatible with Atari's Jaglink Interface peripheral.

An adaptor for the Jaguar that allows for <a href="MSN%20TV">WebTV</a> access was revealed in 1998; one prototype is known to exist.

Reviewing the Jaguar just a few weeks prior to its launch, "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" gave it a "thumbs sideways". They praised the power of the hardware but criticized the controller, and were dubious of how the software lineup would turn out, commenting that Atari's failure to secure support from key third party publishers such as <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a> was a bad sign. They concluded that "Like the <a href="3DO%20Interactive%20Multiplayer">3DO</a>, the Jaguar is a risky investment - just not quite as expensive."

The Jaguar, however, won "<a href="GameFan">GameFan</a>"'s "Best New System" award for 1993.

The small size and poor quality of the Jaguar's game library became the most commonly cited reason for its failure in the marketplace. Jaguar did earn praise with titles such as "<a href="Tempest%202000">Tempest 2000</a>", "<a href="Doom%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Doom</a>", and "<a href="Wolfenstein%203D">Wolfenstein 3D</a>". The most successful title during the Jaguar's first year was "<a href="Alien%20vs%20Predator%20%28Jaguar%20game%29">Alien vs. Predator</a>". Both it and "Tempest 2000" were named among the system's defining titles by "GamePro" in 2007. However, these occasional successes were seen as insufficient while the Jaguar's competitors were receiving a continuous stream of critically acclaimed software; "GamePro" concluded their rave review of "Alien vs.Predator" by remarking "If Atari can turn out a dozen more games like AvP, Jaguar owners could truly rest easy and enjoy their purchase." In a late 1995 review of the Jaguar, "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" commented that "thus far, Atari has spectacularly failed to deliver on the software side, leaving many to question the actual quality and capability of the hardware. With only one or two exceptions - "Tempest 2000" is cited most frequently - there have just been no truly great games for the Jaguar up to now." They further noted that while Atari is well known by older gamers, the company had much less overall <a href="brand%20recognition">brand recognition</a> than Sega, Sony, Nintendo, or even The 3DO Company. However, they argued that with its low price point, the Jaguar might still compete if Atari could improve the software situation. They gave the system two out of five stars. With such a small library of games to challenge the incumbent 16-bit game consoles, Jaguar's appeal never grew beyond a small gaming audience. Digital Spy commented: "Like many failed hardware ventures, it still maintains something of a cult following but can only be considered a misstep for Atari."

In 2006 <a href="IGN">IGN</a> editor Craig Harris rated the standard Jaguar controller as the worst game controller ever, criticizing the unwarranted recycling of the 1980s "phone keypad" format and the small number of action buttons, which he found particularly unwise given that Atari was actively trying to court fighting game fans to the system. Ed Semrad of "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" commented that many Jaguar games gratuitously used all of the controller's phone keypad buttons, making the controls much more difficult than they needed to be. "GamePro"s The Watch Dog remarked, "The controller usually doesn't use the keypad, and for games that use the keypad extensively ("Alien vs. Predator", "Doom"), a keypad overlay is used to minimize confusion. But yes, it is a lot of buttons for nuttin'."

After the Atari Corporation properties were bought out by <a href="Hasbro%20Interactive">Hasbro Interactive</a> in the late 1990s, Hasbro released the rights to the Jaguar, declaring the console an open platform and opening the doors for <a href="homebrew%20%28video%20games%29">homebrew</a> development. A few developers, including <a href="Telegames">Telegames</a> and Songbird Productions, released previously unfinished materials from the Jaguar's past and several brand new titles to satisfy the system's cult following.

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in 2001, a deal was struck between Telegames and retailer <a href="Game%20%28retailer%29">Game</a> to bring the Jaguar to Game's retail outlets. The machine was initially sold for £29.99 brand new and software prices ranged between £9.99 for more common games such as "<a href="Doom%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Doom</a>" and "<a href="Ruiner%20Pinball">Ruiner Pinball</a>", and £39.99 for more sought-after releases such as "<a href="Defender%202000">Defender 2000</a>" and "<a href="Checkered%20Flag%20%28video%20game%29">Checkered Flag</a>". The machine had a presence in the stores until 2007 when remaining consoles were sold off for £9.99 and games were sold for as low as 97p.

This deal was seen as a move to remain competitive with Game's rival at the time, <a href="Gamestation">Gamestation</a>, who were well known for stocking retro formats.

Imagin Systems, a manufacturer of dental imaging equipment, has since purchased the molding plates for the Jaguar's casing as with minor modification they were found to be the right size for housing their HotRod camera. The game cartridge molds were reused to create an optional memory expansion card.

In December 2014, the molds for the console and cartridges were purchased from Imagin Systems by Mike Kennedy, owner of the <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> funded "Retro Videogame Magazine", to propose a new crowdfunded video game console called the "<a href="Chameleon%20%28video%20game%20console%29">Retro VGS</a>", later rebranded the "Coleco Chameleon" after entering a licensing agreement with <a href="Coleco">Coleco</a>. The purchase of the molds from Imagin Systems was far cheaper than designing and manufacturing entirely new molds, and Kennedy described their acquisition as "the entire reason [the Retro VGS] is possible". However, the project was ultimately terminated in March 2016 following a long period of heavy criticism and controversy surrounding Kennedy's perceived dishonesty, unprofessionalism, and lack of technical knowledge in addition to the perceived lack of market demand for the proposed console. The project culminated with the production of two "prototypes" that were quickly proven to be fake, and Coleco removing their involvement from the project after Kennedy and his team failed to produce a prototype for investigation. After the project's termination, the molds were sold to Albert Yarusso, the founder of the AtariAge website.

Atari Lynx

The Atari Lynx is a 16-bit <a href="handheld%20game%20console">handheld game console</a> that was released by <a href="Atari%20Corporation">Atari Corporation</a> in September 1989 in North America, and in Europe and Japan in 1990. It was the world's first <a href="handheld%20electronic%20game">handheld electronic game</a> with a <a href="color">color</a> <a href="LCD">LCD</a>. It was also notable for its advanced graphics and <a href="ambidextrous">ambidextrous</a> layout. The Lynx competed with the <a href="Game%20Boy">Game Boy</a> (released two months earlier), as well as the <a href="Game%20Gear">Game Gear</a> and <a href="TurboExpress">TurboExpress</a>, both released the following year. It was discontinued in 1995.

The Atari Lynx's innovative features include being the first color handheld, with a backlit display, a switchable right-handed/left-handed (upside down) configuration, and the ability to network with up to 15 other units via its "Comlynx" system (though most games would network eight or fewer players). <a href="Comlynx">Comlynx</a> was originally developed to run over infrared links (and was codenamed RedEye). This was changed to a cable-based networking system before the final release.
The Lynx was cited as the "first gaming console with <a href="Graphics%20processing%20unit">hardware</a> support for zooming and distortion of <a href="sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a>". Featuring a 4096 color palette and integrated math and graphics co-processors (including a <a href="blitter">blitter</a> unit), its <a href="pseudo-3D">pseudo-3D</a> color graphics display was said to be the key defining feature in the system's competition against Nintendo's monochromatic Game Boy. The fast pseudo-3D graphics features were made possible on a minimal hardware system by co-designer <a href="Dave%20Needle">Dave Needle</a> having "invented the technique for planar expansion/shrinking capability" and using stretched, textured, triangles instead of full polygons. These particular features were achieved over a year prior to the launch of the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super NES</a>, whose stock hardware features the comparable <a href="Mode%207">Mode 7</a> but which cannot scale sprites.

The Lynx was the second handheld game system to be released with the Atari name. The first was Atari Inc.'s <a href="handheld%20electronic%20game">handheld electronic game</a> "<a href="Touch%20Me%20%28arcade%20game%29">Touch Me</a>". Atari Inc. had previously worked on several other handheld projects including the "<a href="Breakout%20%28arcade%20game%29">Breakout</a>", "<a href="Space%20Invaders">Space Invaders</a>", and the <a href="Atari%20Cosmos">Atari Cosmos</a> portable/tabletop console. However, those projects were shut down during development, some just short of their intended commercial release.

The Lynx system was originally developed by <a href="Epyx">Epyx</a> as the Handy Game. In 1986, two former <a href="Amiga">Amiga</a> designers, <a href="R.%20J.%20Mical">R. J. Mical</a> and <a href="Dave%20Needle">Dave Needle</a>, had been asked by former manager at Amiga, David Morse, if they could come up with a design for a portable gaming system. Morse now worked at Epyx, a game software company that had a recent string of hit games. Morse's son had asked him if he could make a portable gaming system, prompting the lunch with Mical and Needle to discuss the idea. Morse convinced Mical and Needle to develop the idea and they were hired by Epyx to be a part of the design team. Planning and design of the console began in 1986 and was completed in 1987. Epyx first showed the Handy system at the Winter <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a> (CES) in January 1989. Facing financial difficulties, Epyx sought out partners. <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>, <a href="Sega">Sega</a>, and other companies declined, but Atari Corp. and Epyx eventually agreed that Atari Corp. would handle production and marketing, while Epyx would handle software development. Epyx declared bankruptcy by the end of the year, and Atari essentially owned the entire project; both Atari and others, however, had to purchase Amigas from Atari archrival <a href="Commodore%20Business%20Machines">Commodore</a> to develop Lynx software.

The Handy was designed to run games from the cartridge format, and the game data must be copied from ROM to RAM before it can be used. Thus, less RAM is available and the games initially load relatively slowly. There are trace remnants of a <a href="Compact%20Cassette">cassette tape</a> interface physically capable of being programmed to read a tape. Lynx developers have noted that "there is still reference of the tape and some hardware addresses" and an updated vintage Epyx manual describes the bare existence of what could be utilized for tape support. A 2009 retrospective interview clarifies that although some early reports claimed that games were loaded from tape, Mical says there was no truth in them: "We did think about hard disk a little".

Atari Corp. changed the internal speaker and removed the thumb-stick on the control pad before releasing it as the Lynx, initially retailing in the US at . Atari Corp. then showed the Lynx to the press at the Summer 1989 CES as the "Portable Color Entertainment System", which was changed to "Lynx" when actual consoles were distributed to resellers.

The Lynx started off successfully. Atari reported that they had sold 90% of the 50,000 units it shipped in its launch month in the U.S. with a limited launch in New York. US sales in 1990 were approximately 500,000 units according to the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a>. In late 1991, it was reported that Atari sales estimates were about 800,000, which Atari claimed was within their expected projections. Lifetime sales by 1995 amounted to fewer than 7 million units when combined with the Game Gear. In comparison, the Game Boy sold 16 million units by 1995 because it was more rugged, cost half as much, had much longer battery life, was bundled with "<a href="Tetris%20%28Game%20Boy%29">Tetris</a>", and had a superior software library. 

As with the actual console units, the game cartridges themselves evolved over the first year of the console's release. The first generation of cartridges were flat, and were designed to be stackable for ease of storage. However, this design proved to be very difficult to remove from the console and was replaced by a second design. This style, called "tabbed" or "ridged", used the same basic design as the original cartridges with the addition of two small tabs on the cartridge's underside to aid in removal. The original flat style cartridges could be stacked on top of the newer cartridges, but the newer cartridges could not be easily stacked on each other, nor were they stored easily. Thus a third style, the "curved lip" style was produced, and all official and third-party cartridges during the console's lifespan were released (or re-released) using this style.

In May 1991, Sega launched its Game Gear portable gaming handheld. Also a color handheld, in comparison to the Lynx it had a higher cost and shorter battery life (3–4 hours as opposed to 4-5 for the Lynx), but it was slightly smaller and was backed up by significantly more games. Retailers such as <a href="Game%20%28retailer%29">Game</a> and Toys R Us continued to sell the Lynx well into the mid-1990s on the back of the <a href="Atari%20Jaguar">Atari Jaguar</a> launch, helped by magazines such as "Ultimate Future Games" who continued to cover the Lynx alongside the new generation of 32-bit and 64-bit consoles.

During 1990, the Lynx had moderate sales. In July 1991, Atari Corp. introduced the Lynx II with a new marketing campaign, new packaging, slightly improved hardware, better battery life and a new sleeker look. The new system (referred to within Atari Corp. as the "Lynx II") featured rubber hand grips and a clearer backlit color screen with a power save option (which turned off the LCD panel's backlighting). It also replaced the monaural headphone jack of the original Lynx with one wired for stereo. The new packaging made the Lynx available without any accessories, dropping the price to $99. Although sales improved, Nintendo still dominated the handheld market.

In 1995, Atari Corp. shifted its focus away from the Lynx. As the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super NES</a> and <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Genesis</a> filled retailers' shelves, Atari Corp. refocused its efforts on its Jaguar console and its CD-ROM add-on. A handful of games were released during this time, including "Battlezone 2000". In 1996, Atari shut down its internal game development.

The game system was reviewed in 1990 in "<a href="Dragon%20%28magazine%29">Dragon</a>", giving the Lynx 5 out of 5 stars. The review states that the Lynx "throws the into the prehistoric age"; and praises the built-in object scaling capabilities, the multiplayer feature of the ComLynx cable, and the strong set of launch games.

The infrequency of Lynx software releases and the system's minimal marketing budget have been cited as the main factors in its commercial failure.

Telegames released a number of games in the second half of the 1990s, including a port of "<a href="Raiden%20%28arcade%20game%29">Raiden</a>" and a platformer called "Fat Bobby" in 1997, as well as an action sports game called "Hyperdrome" in 1999. At the end of the 1990s, Hasbro, the owners of the Atari properties at the time, released the rights to develop for the system to the public domain. Since then a number of independent developers released games into the new decade, like "<a href="Championship_Rally_%28Atari_Lynx%29">Championship Rally</a>", "CyberVirus", and "Alpine Games". Some of the late 1990s/early 2000s games were under development by other companies at one time, but rights to the game programs and all of the existing code was bought and finished by other developers.

In 2008 Atari was honored at the 59th Annual <a href="Technology%20%26amp%3B%20Engineering%20Emmy%20Award">Technology & Engineering Emmy Award</a>s for pioneering the development of <a href="handheld%20games">handheld games</a> with its Lynx game unit.

On October 24, 2009, North American company <a href="Super%20Fighter%20Team">Super Fighter Team</a> released "<a href="Zaku%20%28video%20game%29">Zaku</a>", a horizontal shooter for the Lynx developed by PenguiNet. It was the first new game for the system since the 1990s whose game card has an authentic "curved lip" plastic shell instead of a custom bare circuit board. Three other non-prototype Lynx game have been developed by the <a href="retrogaming">retrogaming</a> community.

Ahimsa

Ahimsa <a href="IAST">IAST</a>: ', <a href="Pali">Pāli</a>: ') means 'not to injure' and 'compassion' and refers to a key virtue in <a href="Indian%20religions">Indian religions</a>. The word is derived from the Sanskrit root "hiṃs" – to strike; "hiṃsā" is injury or harm, "a-hiṃsā" is the opposite of this, i.e. cause no injury, do no harm. Ahimsa is also referred to as <a href="nonviolence">nonviolence</a>, and it applies to all living beings—including all animals—in ancient Indian religions.

Ahimsa is one of the cardinal virtues and an important tenet of <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>, <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, and <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>. Ahimsa is a multidimensional concept, inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. Ahimsa has also been related to the notion that any violence has <a href="Karma">karmic</a> consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of Ahimsa, the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism. Most popularly, <a href="Mahatma%20Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> strongly believed in the principle of "ahimsa".

Ahimsa's precept of 'cause no injury' includes one's deeds, words, and thoughts. Classical literature of Hinduism such as <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a> and <a href="Ramayana">Ramayana</a>, as well as modern scholars debate principles of Ahimsa when one is faced with war and situations requiring self-defence. The historic literature from India and modern discussions have contributed to <a href="Just%20war%20theory">theories of Just War</a>, and theories of appropriate <a href="self-defence">self-defence</a>.

The word "Ahimsa"—sometimes spelled as "Ahinsa"—is derived from the Sanskrit root "hiṃs" – to strike; "hiṃsā" is injury or harm, "a-hiṃsā" is the opposite of this, i.e. "non harming" or "<a href="nonviolence">nonviolence</a>".

There is a debate on the origins of the word "Ahimsa", and how its meaning evolved. <a href="Manfred%20Mayrhofer">Mayrhofer</a> as well as Dumot suggest the root word may be "han" which means kill, which leads to the interpretation that "ahimsa" means "do not kill". Schmidt as well as <a href="Henk%20Bodewitz">Bodewitz</a> explain the proper root word is "hiṃs" and the Sanskrit verb "hinasti", which leads to the interpretation "ahimsa" means "do not injure", or "do not hurt". Wackernagel-Debrunner concur with the latter explanation.

Ancient texts use ahimsa to mean non-injury, a broader concept than non-violence. Non-injury implies not killing others, as well as not hurting others mentally or verbally; it includes avoiding all violent means—including physical violence—anything that injures others. In classical Sanskrit literature of Hinduism, another word "Adrohi" is sometimes used instead of "Ahimsa", as one of the cardinal virtues necessary for moral life. One example is in <a href="Baudhayana">Baudhayana</a> Dharmasutra 2.6.23: वाङ्-मनः-कर्म-दण्डैर् भूतानाम् अद्रोही (One who does not injure others with words, thoughts or acts is named "Adrohi").

Ahimsa as an ethical concept evolved in Vedic texts. The oldest scripts, along with discussing ritual animal sacrifices, indirectly mention Ahimsa, but do not emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices and the concept of Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the concept that describes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words <a href="Satya">Satya</a> (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra; later, the <a href="Yajurveda">Yajur Veda</a> dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, "may all beings look at me with a friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may we look at each other with the eyes of a friend".

The term "Ahimsa" appears in the text <a href="Taittiriya%20Shakha">Taittiriya Shakha</a> of the <a href="Yajurveda">Yajurveda</a> (TS 5.2.8.7), where it refers to non-injury to the sacrificer himself. It occurs several times in the "<a href="Shatapatha%20Brahmana">Shatapatha Brahmana</a>" in the sense of "non-injury". The Ahimsa doctrine is a late Vedic era development in Brahmanical culture. The earliest reference to the idea of non-violence to animals ("pashu-Ahimsa"), apparently in a moral sense, is in the Kapisthala Katha Samhita of the Yajurveda (KapS 31.11), which may have been written in about the 8th century BCE.

Bowker states the word appears but is uncommon in the principal Upanishads. Kaneda gives examples of the word "Ahimsa" in these Upanishads. Other scholars suggest "Ahimsa" as an ethical concept that started evolving in the Vedas, becoming an increasingly central concept in Upanishads.

The <a href="Ch%C4%81ndogya%20Upani%E1%B9%A3ad">Chāndogya Upaniṣad</a>, dated to the 8th or 7th century BCE, one of the oldest <a href="Upanishads">Upanishads</a>, has the earliest evidence for the <a href="Vedas">Vedic era</a> use of the word "Ahimsa" in the sense familiar in Hinduism (a code of conduct). It bars violence against "all creatures" ("sarvabhuta") and the practitioner of Ahimsa is said to escape from the cycle of <a href="Reincarnation">rebirths</a> (CU 8.15.1). Some scholars state that this 8th or 7th-century BCE mention may have been an influence of Jainism on Vedic Hinduism. Others scholar state that this relationship is speculative, and though Jainism is an ancient tradition the oldest traceable texts of Jainism tradition are from many centuries after the Vedic era ended.

Chāndogya Upaniṣad also names Ahimsa, along with Satyavacanam (truthfulness), Arjavam (sincerity), <a href="D%C4%81na">Danam</a> (charity), <a href="Tapas%20%28Sanskrit%29">Tapo</a> (penance/meditation), as one of five essential virtues (CU 3.17.4).

The Sandilya <a href="Upanishad">Upanishad</a> lists ten forbearances: Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, Daya, Arjava, Kshama, Dhriti, Mitahara and Saucha. According to Kaneda, the term Ahimsa is an important spiritual doctrine shared by Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It literally means 'non-injury' and 'non-killing'. It implies the total avoidance of harming of any kind of living creatures not only by deeds, but also by words and in thoughts.

The <a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>, one of the epics of Hinduism, has multiple mentions of the phrase "Ahimsa Paramo Dharma" (अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मः), which literally means: non-violence is the highest moral virtue. For example, <a href="Mahaprasthanika%20Parva">Mahaprasthanika Parva</a> has the verse:
<poem>
अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मस तथाहिंसा परॊ दमः।
अहिंसा परमं दानम अहिंसा परमस तपः।
अहिंसा परमॊ यज्ञस तथाहिस्मा परं बलम।
अहिंसा परमं मित्रम अहिंसा परमं सुखम।
अहिंसा परमं सत्यम अहिंसा परमं शरुतम॥
</poem>
The above passage from Mahabharata emphasises the cardinal importance of Ahimsa in Hinduism, and literally means: Ahimsa is the highest <a href="virtue">virtue</a>, Ahimsa is the highest self-control, Ahimsa is the greatest gift, Ahimsa is the best suffering, Ahimsa is the highest sacrifice, Ahimsa is the finest strength, Ahimsa is the greatest friend, Ahimsa is the greatest happiness, Ahimsa is the highest truth, and Ahimsa is the greatest teaching. Some other examples where the phrase "Ahimsa Paramo Dharma" are discussed include <a href="Adi%20Parva">Adi Parva</a>, <a href="Vana%20Parva">Vana Parva</a> and <a href="Anushasana%20Parva">Anushasana Parva</a>. The <a href="Bhagavad%20Gita">Bhagavad Gita</a>, among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. These verses develop the concepts of lawful violence in self-defence and the <a href="Just%20war%20theory">theories of just war</a>. However, there is no consensus on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about non-violence and lawful violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, when he or she faces moral questions.

The classical texts of Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice the virtue of Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment. <a href="Arthashastra">Arthashastra</a> discusses, among other things, why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment.

The precepts of Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force must be the last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its objective to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful. War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction. All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment. Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.

In matters of self-defence, different interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered. For example, Tähtinen suggests self-defence is appropriate, criminals are not protected by the rule of Ahimsa, and Hindu scriptures support the use of violence against an armed attacker. Ahimsa is not meant to imply pacifism.

Alternate theories of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to theories of just war. <a href="Aikido">Aikido</a>, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. <a href="Morihei%20Ueshiba">Morihei Ueshiba</a>, the founder of Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume that the world is free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.

Tähtinen concludes that Hindus have no misgivings about death penalty; their position is that evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, and that a king in particular is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if they happen to be his own brothers and sons.

Other scholars conclude that the scriptures of Hinduism suggest sentences for any crime must be fair, proportional and not cruel.

There is no consensus on <a href="pacifism">pacifism</a> among modern Hindu scholars. The conflict between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and the theories of <a href="just%20war">just war</a> prescribed by the Gita has been resolved by some scholars such as <a href="Mohandas%20Karamchand%20Gandhi">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</a>, as being an allegory, wherein the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, the war is within each human being, where man's higher impulses struggle against his own evil impulses.

The Hindu precept of 'cause no injury' applies to animals and all life forms. This precept isn't found in the oldest verses of Vedas, but increasingly becomes one of the central ideas between 500 BC and 400 AD. In the oldest texts, numerous ritual sacrifices of animals, including cows and horses, are highlighted and hardly any mention is made of Ahimsa to non-human life.

Hindu scriptures, dated to between 5th century and 1st century BC, while discussing human diet, initially suggest "kosher" meat may be eaten, evolving it with the suggestion that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, then that one should eat no meat because it hurts animals, with verses describing the noble life as one that lives on flowers, roots and fruits alone.

Later texts of Hinduism declare Ahimsa one of the primary virtues, declare any killing or harming any life as against "dharma" (moral life). Finally, the discussion in Upanishads and Hindu Epics shifts to whether a human being can ever live his or her life without harming animal and plant life in some way; which and when plants or animal meat may be eaten, whether violence against animals causes human beings to become less compassionate, and if and how one may exert least harm to non-human life consistent with ahimsa precept, given the constraints of life and human needs. The Mahabharata permits hunting by warriors, but opposes it in the case of hermits who must be strictly non-violent. <a href="Sushruta%20Samhita">Sushruta Samhita</a>, a Hindu text written in the 3rd or 4th century, in Chapter XLVI suggests proper diet as a means of treating certain illnesses, and recommends various fishes and meats for different ailments and for pregnant women, and the <a href="Charaka%20Samhita">Charaka Samhita</a> describes meat as superior to all other kinds of food for convalescents.

Across the texts of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to non-human life, but without a universal consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.

Many of the arguments proposed in favor of non-violence to animals refer to the bliss one feels, the rewards it entails before or after death, the danger and harm it prevents, as well as to the karmic consequences of violence.

The ancient Hindu texts discuss Ahimsa and non-animal life. They discourage wanton destruction of nature including of wild and cultivated plants. Hermits (<a href="sannyasa">sannyasin</a>s) were urged to live on a <a href="fruitarian">fruitarian</a> diet so as to avoid the destruction of plants. Scholars claim the principles of ecological non-violence is innate in the Hindu tradition, and its conceptual fountain has been Ahimsa as their cardinal virtue.

The classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, "<a href="Tirukku%E1%B9%9Ba%E1%B8%B7">Tirukkuṛaḷ</a>," written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and sometimes called the <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> <a href="Veda">Veda</a>, is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. Tirukkuṛaḷ dedicates Chapters 26, 32 and 33 of Book 1 to the virtue of Ahimsa, namely, <a href="vegetarianism">vegetarianism</a>, <a href="non-violence">non-harming</a>, and <a href="non-killing">non-killing</a>, respectively. "Tirukkuṛaḷ" says that Ahimsa applies to all life forms.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, prominent figures of Indian spirituality such as <a href="Swami%20Vivekananda">Swami Vivekananda</a>, <a href="Ramana%20Maharshi">Ramana Maharshi</a>, <a href="Swami%20Sivananda">Swami Sivananda</a>, <a href="A.%20C.%20Bhaktivedanta%20Swami">A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami</a> and in the present time Vijaypal Baghel emphasised the importance of Ahimsa.

<a href="Mohandas%20Karamchand%20Gandhi">Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</a> promoted the principle of Ahimsa, very successful by applying it to all spheres of life, particularly to politics (<a href="Swaraj">Swaraj</a>). His non-violent resistance movement <a href="satyagraha">satyagraha</a> had an immense impact on India, impressed public opinion in Western countries, and influenced the leaders of various <a href="civil%20and%20political%20rights">civil and political rights</a> movements such as the American civil rights movement's <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a> and <a href="James%20Bevel">James Bevel</a>. In Gandhi's thought, Ahimsa precludes not only the act of inflicting a physical injury, but also mental states like evil thoughts and hatred, unkind behavior such as harsh words, dishonesty and lying, all of which he saw as manifestations of violence incompatible with Ahimsa. Gandhi believed Ahimsa to be a creative energy force, encompassing all interactions leading one's self to find satya, "Divine Truth". <a href="Sri%20Aurobindo">Sri Aurobindo</a> criticised the Gandhian concept of Ahimsa as unrealistic and not universally applicable; he adopted a pragmatic non-pacifist position, saying that the justification of violence depends on the specific circumstances of the given situation. Sri Aurobindo also indicated that Gandhi's Ahimsa led to partition of India as it blocked the forceful action that the Indian people were engaged in during the 1920s and 30s, which caused delay in independence, allowing other forces to take root, including those who wanted India divided.

Gandhi stated that he viewed "Ahimsa is in Hinduism, it is in Christianity as well as in Islam." He added, "Nonviolence is common to all religions, but it has found the highest expression and application in Hinduism (I do not regard Jainism or Buddhism as separate from Hinduism)." When questioned whether violence and non-violence is both taught in Quran, he stated, "I have heard it from many Muslim friends that the Koran teaches the use of non-violence. (... The) argument about non-violence in the Holy Koran is an interpolation, not necessary for my thesis."

A historical and philosophical study of Ahimsa was instrumental in the shaping of <a href="Albert%20Schweitzer">Albert Schweitzer</a>'s principle of "reverence for life". Schweitzer praised Indian philosophical and religious traditions for ethics of Ahimsa as, "the laying down of the commandment not to kill and not to damage is one of the greatest events in the spiritual history of mankind", but suggested that "not-killing and not-harming" is not always practically possible as in self-defence, nor ethical as in chronic starving during a famine case.

Ahimsa is imperative for practitioners of <a href="Pata%C3%B1jali">Patañjali</a>'s eight limb <a href="Raja%20yoga">Raja yoga</a> system. It is included in the first limb and is the first of five <a href="Yamas">Yamas</a> (self restraints) which, together with the second limb, make up the code of ethical conduct in Yoga philosophy. Ahimsa is also one of the ten "Yamas" in <a href="Hatha%20Yoga">Hatha Yoga</a> according to verse 1.1.17 of its classic manual "<a href="Hatha%20Yoga%20Pradipika">Hatha Yoga Pradipika</a>".
The significance of Ahimsa as the very first restraint in the very first limb of Yoga (Yamas), is that it defines the necessary foundation for progress through Yoga. It is a precursor to Asana, implying that success in Yogasana can be had only if the self is purified in thought, word and deed through the self-restraint of Ahimsa.

In Jainism, the understanding and implementation of "Ahimsā" is more radical, scrupulous, and comprehensive than in any other religion. Killing any living being out of passions is considered "hiṃsā" (to injure) and abstaining from such an act is "ahimsā" (noninjury). The vow of ahimsā is considered the foremost among the 'five vows of Jainism'. Other vows like truth (satya) are meant for safeguarding the vow of ahimsā. In the practice of Ahimsa, the requirements are less strict for the lay persons (<a href="sravakas">sravakas</a>) who have undertaken "anuvrata" (Smaller Vows) than for the <a href="Jain%20monasticism">Jain monastics</a> who are bound by the <a href="Mahavrata">Mahavrata</a> "Great Vows". The statement "" is often found inscribed on the walls of the <a href="Jain%20temple">Jain temple</a>s. Like in Hinduism, the aim is to prevent the accumulation of harmful karma. When <a href="Mahavira">Mahavira</a> revived and reorganised the Jain faith in the 6th or 5th century BCE, Ahimsa was already an established, strictly observed rule. <a href="Rishabhanatha">Rishabhanatha</a> (Ādinātha), the first Jain <a href="Tirthankara">Tirthankara</a>, whom modern Western historians consider to be a historical figure, followed by <a href="Parshvanatha">Parshvanatha</a> (Pārśvanātha) the twenty-third <a href="Tirthankara">Tirthankara</a> lived in about the 8th century BCE. He founded the community to which Mahavira's parents belonged. Ahimsa was already part of the "Fourfold Restraint" ("Caujjama"), the vows taken by Parshva's followers. In the times of Mahavira and in the following centuries, Jains were at odds with both Buddhists and followers of the Vedic religion or Hindus, whom they accused of negligence and inconsistency in the implementation of Ahimsa. According to the Jain tradition either <a href="lacto%20vegetarianism">lacto vegetarianism</a> or <a href="veganism">veganism</a> is mandatory.

The Jain concept of Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It does not make any exception for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out. Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed for the sake of food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants. Jains go out of their way so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals. For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action. Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees. Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects, but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.

Theoretically, all life forms are said to deserve full protection from all kinds of injury, but Jains recognise a hierarchy of life. Mobile beings are given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more they care about non-injuring it. Among the five-sensed beings, the precept of non-injury and non-violence to the rational ones (humans) is strongest in Jain Ahimsa.

Jains agree with Hindus that violence in self-defence can be justified, and they agree that a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty. Jain communities accepted the use of military power for their defence, there were Jain monarchs, military commanders, and soldiers.

In Buddhist texts "Ahimsa" (or its <a href="P%C4%81li">Pāli</a> cognate ) is part of the <a href="Five%20Precepts">Five Precepts</a> (), the first of which has been to abstain from killing. This precept of Ahimsa is applicable to both the Buddhist layperson and the monk community.

The Ahimsa precept is not a commandment and transgressions did not invite religious sanctions for layperson, but their power has been in the Buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in afterlife during rebirth. Killing, in Buddhist belief, could lead to rebirth in the hellish realm, and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk. Saving animals from slaughter for meat, is believed to be a way to acquire merit for better rebirth. These moral precepts have been voluntarily self-enforced in lay Buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth. The Buddhist texts not only recommended Ahimsa, but suggest avoiding trading goods that contribute to or are a result of violence:

Unlike lay Buddhists, transgressions by monks do invite sanctions. Full expulsion of a monk from "sangha" follows instances of killing, just like any other serious offense against the monastic "nikaya" code of conduct.

Violent ways of punishing criminals and prisoners of war was not explicitly condemned in Buddhism, but peaceful ways of conflict resolution and punishment with the least amount of injury were encouraged. The early texts condemn the mental states that lead to violent behavior.

Nonviolence is an overriding theme within the <a href="Pali%20Canon">Pali Canon</a>. While the early texts condemn killing in the strongest terms, and portray the ideal king as a pacifist, such a king is nonetheless flanked by an army. It seems that the Buddha's teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists. The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare. In Pali texts, injunctions to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the <a href="Sangha%20%28Buddhism%29">sangha</a>; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.

The early texts do not contain just-war ideology as such. Some argue that a <a href="suttas">sutta</a> in the "Gamani Samyuttam" rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha if it is true that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth. In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.

Some Buddhists point to other early texts as justifying defensive war. One example is the "Kosala Samyutta", in which King <a href="Pasenadi">Pasenadi</a>, a righteous king favored by the Buddha, learns of an impending attack on his kingdom. He arms himself in defence, and leads his army into battle to protect his kingdom from attack. He lost this battle but won the war. King Pasenadi eventually defeated King <a href="Ajatasattu">Ajatasattu</a> and captured him alive. He thought that, although this King of <a href="Magadha">Magadha</a> has transgressed against his kingdom, he had not transgressed against him personally, and Ajatasattu was still his nephew. He released Ajatasattu and did not harm him. Upon his return, the Buddha said (among other things) that Pasenadi "is a friend of virtue, acquainted with virtue, intimate with virtue", while the opposite is said of the aggressor, King Ajatasattu.

According to Theravada commentaries, there are five requisite factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) the presence of a living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.

According to <a href="Dr.%20Babasaheb%20Ambedkar">Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar</a>, there is circumstantial evidence encouraging Ahimsa, from the Buddha's doctrine, ""Love all, so that you may not wish to kill any."" Gautama Buddha distinguished between a principle and a rule. He did not make Ahimsa a matter of rule, but suggested it as a matter of principle. This gives Buddhists freedom to act.

The emperors of <a href="Sui%20dynasty">Sui dynasty</a>, <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a> and early <a href="Song%20dynasty">Song dynasty</a> banned killing in Lunar calendar <a href="Chinese%20New%20Year">1st</a>, 5th, and 9th month. <a href="Wu%20Zetian">Empress Wu Tse-Tien</a> banned killing for more than half a year in 692. Some also banned fishing for some time each year.

There were bans after death of emperors, Buddhist and Taoist prayers, and natural disasters such as after a drought in 1926 summer Shanghai and an 8 days ban from August 12, 1959, after the August 7 flood (), the last big flood before <a href="the%2088%20Taiwan%20Flood">the 88 Taiwan Flood</a>.

People avoid killing during some festivals, like the Taoist <a href="Ghost%20Festival">Ghost Festival</a>, the <a href="Nine%20Emperor%20Gods%20Festival">Nine Emperor Gods Festival</a>, the <a href="Vegetarian%20Festival">Vegetarian Festival</a> and many others.

The Annals of Mathematics is a bimonthly <a href="mathematical%20journal">mathematical journal</a> published by <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> and the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a>.
Although its <a href="ISO%204">ISO 4</a> abbreviation is "Ann. Math.", "<a href="Mathematical%20Reviews">Mathematical Reviews</a>" and many other mathematical publications abbreviate it as "Ann. of Math." instead.

The journal was established as "The Analyst" in 1874 and with <a href="Joel%20E.%20Hendricks">Joel E. Hendricks</a> as the founding <a href="editor-in-chief">editor-in-chief</a>. It was "intended to afford a medium for the presentation and analysis of any and all questions of interest or importance in pure and applied Mathematics, embracing especially all new and interesting discoveries in theoretical and practical astronomy, mechanical philosophy, and engineering". It was published in <a href="Des%20Moines%2C%20Iowa">Des Moines, Iowa</a>, and was the earliest American mathematics journal to be published continuously for more than a year or two. This incarnation of the journal ceased publication after its tenth year, in 1883, giving as an explanation Hendricks' declining health, but Hendricks made arrangements to have it taken over by new management, and it was continued from March 1884 as the "Annals of Mathematics". The new incarnation of the journal was edited by <a href="Ormond%20Stone">Ormond Stone</a> (<a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a>). It moved to <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard</a> in 1899 before reaching its current home in Princeton in 1911.

An important period for the journal was 1928–1958 with <a href="Solomon%20Lefschetz">Solomon Lefschetz</a> as editor. During this time, it became an increasingly well-known and respected journal. Its rise, in turn, stimulated American mathematics. <a href="Norman%20Steenrod">Norman Steenrod</a> characterized Lefschetz' impact as editor as follows: ""The importance to American mathematicians of a first-class journal is that it sets high standards for them to aim at. In this somewhat indirect manner, Lefschetz profoundly affected the development of mathematics in the United States.""

Princeton University continued to publish the annals on its own until 1933, when the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> took joint editorial control. Since 1998 it has been available in an electronic edition, alongside its regular print edition. The electronic edition was available without charge, as an <a href="open%20access%20journal">open access journal</a>, but since 2008 this is no longer the case. Issues from before 2003 were transferred to the non-free <a href="JSTOR">JSTOR</a> archive, and articles are not freely available until 5 years after publication.

Andrei Sakharov

Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov (; 21 May 192114 December 1989) was a Russian <a href="nuclear%20physicist">nuclear physicist</a>, <a href="Soviet%20dissident">dissident</a>, and activist for <a href="Nuclear%20disarmament">disarmament</a>, peace and human rights.

He became renowned as the designer of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>'s <a href="Soviet%20atomic%20bomb%20project%23RDS-37">RDS-37</a>, a codename for Soviet development of <a href="Teller%E2%80%93Ulam%20design">thermonuclear weapons</a>. Sakharov later became an advocate of <a href="civil%20liberties">civil liberties</a> and civil reforms in the Soviet Union, for which he faced state persecution; these efforts earned him the <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 1975. The <a href="Sakharov%20Prize">Sakharov Prize</a>, which is awarded annually by the <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a> for people and organizations dedicated to human rights and freedoms, is named in his honor.

Sakharov was born in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> on May 21, 1921. His father was Dmitri Ivanovich Sakharov, a private school physics teacher and an amateur <a href="pianist">pianist</a>. His father later taught at the <a href="Second%20Moscow%20State%20University">Second Moscow State University</a>. Andrei's grandfather Ivan had been a prominent lawyer in the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> who had displayed respect for social awareness and humanitarian principles (including advocating the abolition of <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20Russia">capital punishment</a>) that would later influence his grandson. Sakharov's mother was Yekaterina Alekseyevna Sakharova, a great-granddaughter of the prominent military commander Alexey Semenovich Sofiano (who was of <a href="Greece">Greek</a> ancestry). Sakharov's parents and paternal grandmother, Maria Petrovna, largely shaped his personality. His mother and grandmother were churchgoers; his father was a nonbeliever. When Andrei was about thirteen, he realized that he did not believe, but in later life he unequivocally described his religious feeling.

Sakharov entered <a href="Moscow%20State%20University">Moscow State University</a> in 1938. Following evacuation in 1941 during the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Great Patriotic War</a> (World War II), he graduated in <a href="A%C5%9Fgabat">Aşgabat</a>, in today's <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>. He was then assigned to laboratory work in <a href="Ulyanovsk">Ulyanovsk</a>. In 1943, he married Klavdia Alekseyevna Vikhireva, with whom he raised two daughters and a son before she died in 1969. He returned to Moscow in 1945 to study at the Theoretical Department of <a href="Lebedev%20Physical%20Institute">FIAN</a> (the Physical Institute of the <a href="Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Soviet Academy of Sciences</a>). He received his <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Ph.D.</a> in 1947.

After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, he researched <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a>s. In mid-1948 he participated in the <a href="Soviet%20atomic%20bomb%20project">Soviet atomic bomb project</a> under <a href="Igor%20Kurchatov">Igor Kurchatov</a> and <a href="Igor%20Tamm">Igor Tamm</a>. Sakharov's study group at FIAN in 1948 came up with a second concept in August–September 1948. Adding a shell of natural, unenriched uranium around the deuterium would increase the deuterium concentration at the uranium-deuterium boundary and the overall yield of the device, because the natural uranium would capture neutrons and itself fission as part of the thermonuclear reaction. This idea of a layered fission-fusion-fission bomb led Sakharov to call it the sloika, or layered cake. The first Soviet atomic device was tested on August 29, 1949. After moving to <a href="Sarov">Sarov</a> in 1950, Sakharov played a key role in the development of the first megaton-range Soviet hydrogen bomb using a design known as "Sakharov's Third Idea" in Russia and the <a href="Teller-Ulam%20design">Teller-Ulam design</a> in the United States. Before his "Third Idea", Sakharov tried a "layer cake" of alternating layers of fission and fusion fuel. The results were disappointing, yielding no more than a typical fission bomb. However the design was seen to be worth pursuing because deuterium is abundant and uranium is scarce, and he had no idea how powerful the US design was. One of the <a href="Bikini%20atomic%20experiments">Bikini atomic experiments</a> changed that, because the magnitude of the explosion became public knowledge when there was a dispute between Japan and the US over the contamination of a large area of ocean. Sakharov was surprised by the size of the explosion and realized that the Americans had harnessed the power of a separate fission explosion to compress the fusion fuel. Sakharov realised that in order to cause the explosion of one side of the fuel to symmetrically compress the fusion fuel, a mirror could be used to reflect the radiation. The details had not been officially declassified in Russia when Sakharov was writing his memoirs, but in the <a href="Teller-Ulam%20design">Teller-Ulam design</a>, soft X-rays emitted by the fission bomb were focused onto a cylinder of lithium deuteride to compress it symmetrically. This is called <a href="radiation%20implosion">radiation implosion</a>. The Teller-Ulam design also had a secondary fission device inside the fusion cylinder to assist with the compression of the fusion fuel and generate neutrons to convert some of the lithium to tritium, producing a mixture of deuterium and tritium. Sakharov's idea was first tested as <a href="RDS-37">RDS-37</a> in 1955. A larger variation of the same design which Sakharov worked on was the 50 Mt <a href="Tsar%20Bomba">Tsar Bomba</a> of October 1961, which was the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated.

Sakharov saw "striking parallels" between his fate and those of <a href="J.%20Robert%20Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a> and <a href="Edward%20Teller">Edward Teller</a> in the USA. Sakharov believed that in this "tragic confrontation of two outstanding people", both deserved respect, because "each of them was certain he had right on his side and was morally obligated to go to the end in the name of truth." While Sakharov strongly disagreed with Teller over <a href="Nuclear%20weapons%20testing">nuclear testing in the atmosphere</a> and the <a href="Strategic%20Defense%20Initiative">Strategic Defense Initiative</a>, he believed that American academics had been unfair to Teller's resolve to get the H-bomb for the United States since "all steps by the Americans of a temporary or permanent rejection of developing thermonuclear weapons would have been seen either as a clever feint, or as the manifestation of stupidity. In both cases, the reaction would have been the same – avoid the trap and immediately take advantage of the enemy's stupidity."

Sakharov never felt that by creating nuclear weapons he had "known sin", in Oppenheimer's expression. He later wrote: "After more than forty years, we have had no <a href="third%20world%20war">third world war</a>, and the <a href="Mutual%20assured%20destruction">balance of nuclear terror</a> ... may have helped to prevent one. But I am not at all sure of this; back then, in those long-gone years, the question didn't even arise. What most troubles me now is the instability of the balance, the extreme peril of the current situation, the appalling waste of the arms race ... Each of us has a responsibility to think about this in global terms, with tolerance, trust, and candor, free from ideological dogmatism, parochial interests, or national egotism."

In 1950 he proposed an idea for a controlled <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a> reactor, the <a href="tokamak">tokamak</a>, which is still the basis for the majority of work in the area. Sakharov, in association with <a href="Igor%20Tamm">Igor Tamm</a>, proposed confining extremely hot ionized <a href="Plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a> by <a href="torus">torus</a> shaped <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>s for controlling <a href="thermonuclear%20fusion">thermonuclear fusion</a> that led to the development of the tokamak device.

In 1951 he invented and tested the first <a href="explosively%20pumped%20flux%20compression%20generator">explosively pumped flux compression generator</a>s, compressing magnetic fields by <a href="Explosive%20material">explosives</a>. He called these devices MK (for "MagnetoKumulative") generators. The radial MK-1 produced a pulsed magnetic field of 25 <a href="gauss%20%28unit%29">megagauss</a> (2500 <a href="tesla%20%28unit%29">teslas</a>). The resulting helical MK-2 generated 1000 million amperes in 1953.

Sakharov then tested a MK-driven "plasma cannon" where a small aluminum ring was vaporized by huge <a href="eddy%20current">eddy current</a>s into a stable, self-confined <a href="torus">toroidal</a> <a href="plasmoid">plasmoid</a> and was accelerated to 100 km/s. Sakharov later suggested replacing the copper <a href="Electromagnetic%20coil">coil</a> in MK generators with a large <a href="Superconductivity">superconductor</a> <a href="solenoid">solenoid</a> to magnetically compress and focus <a href="Nuclear%20testing">underground nuclear explosions</a> into a <a href="shaped%20charge">shaped charge</a> effect. He theorized this could focus 10 <a href="proton">proton</a>s per second on a 1 mm surface.

After 1965 Sakharov returned to <a href="fundamental%20science">fundamental science</a> and began working on <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a> and <a href="physical%20cosmology">physical cosmology</a>.

He mainly tried to explain the <a href="baryon%20asymmetry">baryon asymmetry</a> of the universe, considering for the first time <a href="CPT%20symmetry">CPT-symmetric</a> events occurring "before" the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a>:

Sakharov was the first scientist to introduce twin universes he called "sheets". He achieved a complete CPT symmetry since the second sheet is populated by invisible "shadow matter" which is <a href="antimatter">antimatter</a> (<a href="C-symmetry">C-symmetry</a>) because of an opposite <a href="CP-violation">CP-violation</a> there, and the two sheets are <a href="Chirality%20%28mathematics%29">mirror of each other</a> both in space (<a href="parity%20inversion">P-symmetry</a>) and time (<a href="T-symmetry">T-symmetry</a>) through the same initial <a href="gravitational%20singularity">gravitational singularity</a>.

In his first model the two universes did not interact, except via local matter accumulation whose density and pressure become high enough to connect the two sheets through a bridge without <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a> between them, but with a continuity of <a href="geodesic">geodesic</a>s beyond the <a href="Schwarzschild%20radius">Schwarzschild radius</a> with no singularity, allowing an exchange of matter between the two conjugated sheets, based on an idea after <a href="Igor%20Dmitriyevich%20Novikov">Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov</a>. Novikov called such singularities a "collapse" and an "anticollapse", which are an alternative to the couple <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a> and <a href="white%20hole">white hole</a> in the <a href="wormhole">wormhole</a> model. Sakharov also proposed the idea of <a href="induced%20gravity">induced gravity</a> as an alternative theory of <a href="quantum%20gravity">quantum gravity</a>.

Since the late 1950s Sakharov had become concerned about the moral and political implications of his work. Politically active during the 1960s, Sakharov was against <a href="nuclear%20proliferation">nuclear proliferation</a>. Pushing for the end of atmospheric tests, he played a role in the 1963 <a href="Partial%20Test%20Ban%20Treaty">Partial Test Ban Treaty</a>, signed in Moscow.

Sakharov was also involved in an event with political consequences in 1964, when the USSR Academy of Sciences nominated for full membership Nikolai Nuzhdin, a follower of <a href="Trofim%20Lysenko">Trofim Lysenko</a> (initiator of the Stalin-supported anti-genetics campaign <a href="Lysenkoism">Lysenkoism</a>). Contrary to normal practice Sakharov, a member of the Academy, publicly spoke out against full membership for Nuzhdin, holding him responsible for "the defamation, firing, arrest, even death, of many genuine scientists." In the end, Nuzhdin was not elected, but the episode prompted Sergei Khrushchev to order the KGB to gather compromising material on Sakharov.

The major turn in Sakharov's political evolution came in 1967, when <a href="anti-ballistic%20missile">anti-ballistic missile</a> defense became a key issue in US–Soviet relations. In a secret detailed letter to the Soviet leadership of July 21, 1967, Sakharov explained the need to "take the Americans at their word" and accept their proposal for a "bilateral rejection by the USA and the Soviet Union of the development of antiballistic missile defense", because otherwise an arms race in this new technology would increase the likelihood of nuclear war. He also asked permission to publish his manuscript (which accompanied the letter) in a newspaper to explain the dangers posed by this kind of defense. The government ignored his letter and refused to let him initiate a public discussion of ABMs in the Soviet press.

In May 1968 Sakharov completed an essay entitled "Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom". In it, he described the anti-ballistic missile defense as a major threat of world nuclear war. After this essay was circulated in "<a href="samizdat">samizdat</a>" and then published outside the Soviet Union, Sakharov was banned from conducting any military-related research and returned to FIAN to study fundamental theoretical physics.

Over the next twelve years, until his exile to Gorky (<a href="Nizhny%20Novgorod">Nizhny Novgorod</a>) in January 1980, Andrei Sakharov assumed the role of a widely recognized and open dissident in Moscow. He stood vigil outside closed courtrooms, wrote appeals on behalf of more than two hundred individual prisoners, and continued to write essays about the need for democratization.

In 1970 Sakharov was among the three founding members of the <a href="Committee%20on%20Human%20Rights%20in%20the%20USSR">Committee on Human Rights in the USSR</a> along with <a href="Valery%20Chalidze">Valery Chalidze</a> and <a href="Andrei%20Tverdokhlebov">Andrei Tverdokhlebov</a>. The Committee wrote appeals, collected signatures for petitions and succeeded in affiliating with several international human rights organizations. Its work was the subject of many KGB reports and brought Sakharov under increasing pressure from the government.

Sakharvov married a fellow human rights activist, <a href="Yelena%20Bonner">Yelena Bonner</a>, in 1972.

By 1973 Sakharov was meeting regularly with Western correspondents, holding press conferences in his apartment. He appealed to the U.S. Congress to approve the 1974 <a href="Jackson%E2%80%93Vanik%20amendment">Jackson-Vanik Amendment</a> to a trade bill, which coupled trade tariffs to the Kremlin's willingness to allow freer emigration.

In 1972 Sakharov became the target of sustained pressure and intimidation, from his fellow scientists in the <a href="Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">USSR Academy of Sciences</a>, the Soviet press and direct threats of physical assault. Dissident activists, including the writer Solzhenitsyn, sprang to his defence.

In 1973 and 1974, the Soviet media campaign continued, targeting both Sakharov and <a href="Aleksandr%20Solzhenitsyn">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</a>. While Sakharov disagreed with Solzhenitsyn's vision of Russian revival, he deeply respected him for his courage. Only a few individuals in the Soviet Union were willing to defend 'traitors' like Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn, and those who had dared were inevitably punished.

Sakharov later described that it took "years" for him to "understand how much substitution, deceit, and lack of correspondence with reality there was" in the Soviet ideals. "At first I thought, despite everything that I saw with my own eyes, that the Soviet State was a breakthrough into the future, a kind of prototype for all countries". Then he came, in his words, to "the theory of symmetry: all governments and regimes to a first approximation are bad, all peoples are oppressed, and all are threatened by common dangers."

After that he realized that there is not much "symmetry between a cancer cell and a normal one. Yet our state is similar to a cancer cell – with its messianism and expansionism, its totalitarian suppression of dissent, the authoritarian structure of power, with a total absence of public control in the most important decisions in domestic and foreign policy, a closed society that does not inform its citizens of anything substantial, closed to the outside world, without freedom of travel or the exchange of information." Sakharov's ideas on social development led him to put forward the principle of human rights as a new basis of all politics. In his works he declared that "the principle '<a href="Everything%20which%20is%20not%20forbidden%20is%20allowed">what is not prohibited is allowed</a>' should be understood literally", defying the unwritten ideological rules imposed by the Communist ruling elite on the society in spite of the seemingly democratic (1936) <a href="USSR%20Constitution">USSR Constitution</a>.

In no way did Sakharov consider himself a prophet or the like: "I am no volunteer priest of the idea, but simply a man with an unusual fate. I am against all kinds of self-immolation (for myself and for others, including the people closest to me)." In a letter written from exile, he cheered up a fellow physicist and human rights activist with the words: "Fortunately, the future is unpredictable and also – because of <a href="quantum%20effects">quantum effects</a> – uncertain." For Sakharov the indeterminacy of the future supported his belief that he could, and should, take personal responsibility for it.

In 1973, Sakharov was nominated for the <a href="Nobel%20Peace%20Prize">Nobel Peace Prize</a> and in 1974 was awarded the <a href="Prix%20mondial%20Cino%20Del%20Duca">Prix mondial Cino Del Duca</a>.

Sakharov was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975. The <a href="Norwegian%20Nobel%20Committee">Norwegian Nobel Committee</a> called him "a spokesman for the conscience of mankind". In the words of the Nobel Committee's citation: "In a convincing manner Sakharov has emphasised that Man's inviolable rights provide the only safe foundation for genuine and enduring international cooperation."

Sakharov was not allowed to leave the Soviet Union to collect the prize. His wife <a href="Yelena%20Bonner">Yelena Bonner</a> read his speech at the ceremony in <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a>. On the day the prize was awarded, Sakharov was in <a href="Vilnius">Vilnius</a>, where human rights activist <a href="Sergei%20Kovalev">Sergei Kovalev</a> was being tried. In his Nobel lecture, titled "Peace, Progress, Human Rights", Sakharov called for an end to the arms race, greater respect for the environment, international cooperation, and universal respect for human rights. He included a list of prisoners of conscience and political prisoners in the USSR, stating that he shares the prize with them.

By 1976 the head of the KGB <a href="Yuri%20Andropov">Yuri Andropov</a> was prepared to call Sakharov "Domestic Enemy Number One" before a group of KGB officers.

Sakharov was arrested on January 22, 1980, following his public protests against the <a href="Soviet%20intervention%20in%20Afghanistan">Soviet intervention in Afghanistan</a> in 1979, and was sent to internal exile in the city of Gorky, now <a href="Nizhny%20Novgorod">Nizhny Novgorod</a>, a city that was off limits to foreigners.

Between 1980 and 1986, Sakharov was kept under tight Soviet police surveillance. In his memoirs he mentions that their apartment in Gorky was repeatedly subjected to searches and heists. Sakharov was named the 1980 Humanist of the Year by the <a href="American%20Humanist%20Association">American Humanist Association</a>.

In May 1984, Sakharov's wife, <a href="Yelena%20Bonner">Yelena Bonner</a>, was detained and Sakharov began a <a href="hunger%20strike">hunger strike</a>, demanding permission for his wife to travel to the United States for heart surgery. He was forcibly hospitalized and <a href="forced%20feeding">force-fed</a>. He was held in isolation for four months. In August 1984 Yelena Bonner was sentenced by a court to five years of exile in Gorky.

In April 1985, Sakharov started a new hunger strike for his wife to travel abroad for medical treatment. He again was taken to a hospital and force-fed. In August the Politburo discussed what to do about Sakharov. He remained in the hospital until October 1985 when his wife was allowed to travel to the United States. She had heart surgery in the United States and returned to Gorky in June 1986.

In December 1985, the <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a> established the <a href="Sakharov%20Prize%20for%20Freedom%20of%20Thought">Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought</a>, to be given annually for outstanding contributions to human rights.

On December 19, 1986, <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, who had initiated the policies of <a href="perestroika">perestroika</a> and <a href="glasnost">glasnost</a>, called Sakharov to tell him that he and his wife could return to Moscow.

In 1988, Sakharov was given the International Humanist Award by the <a href="International%20Humanist%20and%20Ethical%20Union">International Humanist and Ethical Union</a>. He helped to initiate the first independent legal political organizations and became prominent in the Soviet Union's growing political opposition. In March 1989, Sakharov <a href="Soviet%20Union%20legislative%20election%2C%201989">was elected</a> to the new parliament, the <a href="Congress%20of%20People%27s%20Deputies%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">All-Union Congress of People's Deputies</a> and co-led the democratic opposition, the <a href="Inter-Regional%20Deputies%20Group">Inter-Regional Deputies Group</a>. In November the head of the KGB reported to Mikhail Gorbachev on Sakharov's encouragement and support for the coal-miners' strike in Vorkuta.

Soon after 21:00 on December 14, 1989, Sakharov went to his study to take a nap before preparing an important speech he was to deliver the next day in the Congress. His wife went to wake him at 23:00 as he had requested but she found Sakharov dead on the floor. According to the notes of Yakov Rapoport, a senior pathologist present at the autopsy, it is most likely that Sakharov died of an <a href="arrhythmia">arrhythmia</a> consequent to <a href="dilated%20cardiomyopathy">dilated cardiomyopathy</a> at the age of 68.
