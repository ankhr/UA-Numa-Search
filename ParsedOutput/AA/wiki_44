Bela Lugosi

Béla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó (; 20 October 1882 – 16 August 1956), better known as Bela Lugosi (; ), was a <a href="Hungarian-American">Hungarian-American</a> actor, famous for portraying <a href="Count%20Dracula">Count Dracula</a> in the <a href="Dracula%20%281931%20English-language%20film%29">1931 film</a> and for his roles in various other <a href="horror%20films">horror films</a>.

He had been playing small parts on the stage in his native Hungary before making his first film in 1917, but had to leave the country after <a href="Hungarian%20Soviet%20Republic">the failed Hungarian Communist Revolution of 1919</a>. He had roles in several films in <a href="Weimar%20Germany">Weimar Germany</a> before arriving in the United States as a seaman on a merchant ship.

In 1927, he appeared as Count Dracula in a Broadway adaptation of <a href="Bram%20Stoker">Bram Stoker</a>'s <a href="Dracula">novel</a>. He later appeared in the classic 1931 film "Dracula" by <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Pictures</a>. Through the 1930s, he occupied an important niche in popular horror films, with their East European setting, but his Hungarian accent limited his repertoire, and he tried unsuccessfully to avoid typecasting.

Meanwhile, he was often paired with <a href="Boris%20Karloff">Boris Karloff</a>, who was able to demand top billing. To his frustration, Lugosi was increasingly restricted to minor parts, kept employed by the studio principally for the sake of his name on the posters. Among his pairings with Karloff, only in "<a href="The%20Black%20Cat%20%281934%20film%29">The Black Cat</a>" (1934), "<a href="The%20Raven%20%281935%20film%29">The Raven</a>" (1935), and "<a href="Son%20of%20Frankenstein">Son of Frankenstein</a>" (1939) did he perform major roles again, and, even in "The Raven", Karloff received top billing despite Lugosi performing the lead role. By this time, Lugosi had been receiving regular medication for <a href="sciatica">sciatic neuritis</a>, and he became addicted to <a href="morphine">morphine</a> and <a href="methadone">methadone</a>. This drug dependence was noted by producers, and the offers eventually dwindled down to a few parts in <a href="Ed%20Wood">Ed Wood</a>'s low-budget movies, most notably "<a href="Plan%209%20from%20Outer%20Space">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a>".

Lugosi was married five times, and had one son, <a href="Bela%20G.%20Lugosi">Bela George Lugosi</a>. Lugosi was a charter member of the American <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a>.

Lugosi, the youngest of four children, was born Béla Ferenc Dezső Blaskó in Lugos in the Kingdom of Hungary (now <a href="Lugoj">Lugoj</a>, <a href="Romania">Romania</a>), not far from <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>, to István Blaskó, a banker, and Paula de Vojnich. He later based his last name on his hometown. He and his sister Vilma were raised in a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> family.

At the age of 12, Lugosi dropped out of school. He began his acting career probably in 1901 or 1902. His earliest known performances are from provincial theatres in the 1903–04 season, playing small roles in several plays and <a href="operetta">operetta</a>s. He went on to <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> plays and other major roles. Moving to <a href="Budapest">Budapest</a> in 1911, he played dozens of roles with the National Theatre of Hungary between 1913–19. Although Lugosi would later claim that he "became the leading actor of Hungary's Royal National Theatre", almost all his roles there were small or supporting parts.

During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, he served as an infantryman in the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Army">Austro-Hungarian Army</a> from 1914-16. There he rose to the rank of captain in the <a href="Ski%20warfare">ski patrol</a> and was awarded the <a href="Wound%20Medal%20%28Austria-Hungary%29">Wound Medal</a> for wounds he suffered while serving on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Russian front</a>.

Due to his activism in the actors' union in Hungary during the time of the <a href="Revolutions%20and%20interventions%20in%20Hungary%20%281918%E2%80%931920%29">Hungarian Revolution of 1919</a>, he was forced to flee his homeland. He first went to <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> and then settled in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> in the Langestrasse where he continued acting. Eventually, he travelled to <a href="New%20Orleans%2C%20Louisiana">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>, US as a crewman aboard a merchant ship. He took the name Lugosi in 1903 to honor his birthplace, Lugos.

Lugosi's first film appearance was in the movie "<a href="The%20Colonel%20%281917%20film%29">Az ezredes</a>" ("The Colonel", 1917). When appearing in <a href="Cinema%20of%20Hungary">Hungarian</a> <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a>s, he used the stage name Arisztid Olt. Lugosi made 12 films in Hungary between 1917 and 1918 before leaving for Germany. Following the collapse of <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Kun">Béla Kun</a>'s <a href="Hungarian%20Soviet%20Republic">Hungarian Soviet Republic</a> in 1919, <a href="political%20left">leftists</a> and <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a>ists became vulnerable. Lugosi was proscribed from acting due to his participation in the formation of an actors’ <a href="labor%20union">union</a>. In exile in Germany, he began appearing in a small number of well-received films, including adaptations of the <a href="Karl%20May">Karl May</a> novels, "<a href="On%20the%20Brink%20of%20Paradise">Auf den Trümmern des Paradieses</a>" ("On the Brink of Paradise"), and "<a href="Caravan%20of%20Death%20%28film%29">Die Todeskarawane</a>" ("The Caravan of Death"), opposite the <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> actress <a href="Dora%20Gerson">Dora Gerson</a> (who died in <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz</a>).

Lugosi left Germany in October 1920, intending to emigrate to the United States, and entered the country at <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> in December 1920. He made his way to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> and was legally inspected for immigration at <a href="Ellis%20Island">Ellis Island</a> in March 1921. He declared his intention to become a U.S. citizen in 1928, and on June 26, 1931, he was <a href="naturalization">naturalized</a>.

On his arrival in America, the , Lugosi worked for some time as a laborer, and then entered the theater in New York City's Hungarian immigrant colony. With fellow Hungarian actors he formed a small <a href="repertory">stock company</a> that toured Eastern cities, playing for immigrant audiences. Lugosi acted in several Hungarian plays before breaking out into his first English <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> play, "The Red Poppy", in 1922. Three more parts came in 1925–26, including a five-month run in the comedy-fantasy "The Devil in the Cheese".

In 1925, he appeared as an Arab Sheik in "Arabesque" which premiered in <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo, New York</a> at the Teck Theatre before moving to Broadway. His first American film role came in the 1923 melodrama "<a href="The%20Silent%20Command">The Silent Command</a>". Several more silent roles followed, as villains or continental types, all in productions made in the New York area.

Lugosi was approached in the summer of 1927 to star in a Broadway production of "<a href="Dracula%20%281924%20play%29">Dracula</a>" adapted by <a href="Hamilton%20Deane">Hamilton Deane</a> and <a href="John%20L.%20Balderston">John L. Balderston</a> from <a href="Bram%20Stoker">Bram Stoker</a>'s <a href="Dracula%20%28novel%29">novel</a>. The <a href="Horace%20Liveright">Horace Liveright</a> production was successful, running 261 performances before touring the United States to much fanfare and critical acclaim throughout 1928-1929. In 1928, Lugosi decided to stay in California when the play ended its West Coast run. His performance piqued the interest of Fox Studios; in 1929, he appeared in the studio's silent film, "<a href="The%20Veiled%20Woman">The Veiled Woman</a>". He also appeared in the (now, supposedly lost) film, "<a href="Prisoners%20%281929%29%20film">Prisoners</a>" which was released in both a silent and sound versions. Following the success of Dracula, Universal Studios decided to do a movie, but Lugosi wasn't their first choice for the role. In 1929, with no other film roles in sight, he returned to the stage as Dracula for a short West Coast tour of the play. Lugosi remained in California where he resumed (under contract with Fox) his film work, appearing in early talkies often as a heavy or as "exotic sheiks". He also continued to lobby for his prized role in the film version of "<a href="Dracula%20%281931%20English-language%20film%29">Dracula</a>".

Despite his critically acclaimed performance on stage, Lugosi was not <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Pictures</a>’ first choice for the role of Dracula when the company optioned the rights to the Deane play and began production in 1930. A persistent rumor asserts that director <a href="Tod%20Browning">Tod Browning</a>'s long-time collaborator, <a href="Lon%20Chaney%2C%20Sr.">Lon Chaney</a>, was Universal's first choice for the role, and that Lugosi was chosen only due to Chaney's death shortly before production. This is questionable, because Chaney had been under long-term contract to <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> since 1925, and had negotiated a lucrative new contract just before his death.

Chaney and Browning had worked together on several projects (including four of Chaney's final five releases), but Browning was only a last-minute choice to direct the movie version of "Dracula" after the death of director <a href="Paul%20Leni">Paul Leni</a>, who was originally slated to direct. Different prominent actors were considered before Browning cast Lugosi for the role. The film, "<a href="Dracula%20%281931%20English-language%20film%29">Dracula</a>", was a hit.

Through his association with "Dracula" (in which he appeared with minimal makeup, using his natural, heavily accented voice), Lugosi found himself <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> as a <a href="horror%20film">horror</a> villain in movies such as "<a href="Murders%20in%20the%20Rue%20Morgue%20%281932%20film%29">Murders in the Rue Morgue</a>", "<a href="The%20Raven%20%281935%20film%29">The Raven</a>", and "<a href="Son%20of%20Frankenstein">Son of Frankenstein</a>" for Universal, and the independent "<a href="White%20Zombie%20%28film%29">White Zombie</a>". His accent, while a part of his image, limited the roles he could play.

Lugosi did attempt to break type by auditioning for other roles. He lost out to <a href="Lionel%20Barrymore">Lionel Barrymore</a> for the role of <a href="Rasputin">Rasputin</a> in "<a href="Rasputin%20and%20the%20Empress">Rasputin and the Empress</a>"; <a href="C.%20Henry%20Gordon">C. Henry Gordon</a> for the role of Surat Khan in "<a href="The%20Charge%20of%20the%20Light%20Brigade%20%281936%20film%29">Charge of the Light Brigade</a>"; <a href="Basil%20Rathbone">Basil Rathbone</a> for the role of Commissar Dimitri Gorotchenko in "<a href="Tovarich%20%28film%29">Tovarich</a>" (a role Lugosi had played on stage). He played the elegant, somewhat hot-tempered Gen. Nicholas Strenovsky-Petronovich in "<a href="International%20House%20%281933%20film%29">International House</a>".

Regardless of controversy, five films at Universal — "<a href="The%20Black%20Cat%20%281934%20film%29">The Black Cat</a>", "<a href="The%20Raven%20%281935%20film%29">The Raven</a>", "<a href="The%20Invisible%20Ray%20%281936%20film%29">The Invisible Ray</a>", "<a href="Son%20of%20Frankenstein">Son of Frankenstein</a>", "<a href="Black%20Friday%20%281940%20film%29">Black Friday</a>" (plus minor cameo performances in 1934's "<a href="Gift%20of%20Gab%20%281934%20film%29">Gift of Gab</a>") and two at <a href="RKO%20Pictures">RKO Pictures</a>, "<a href="You%27ll%20Find%20Out">You'll Find Out</a>" and "<a href="The%20Body%20Snatcher%20%28film%29">The Body Snatcher</a>" — paired Lugosi with <a href="Boris%20Karloff">Boris Karloff</a>. Despite the relative size of their roles, Lugosi inevitably got second billing, below Karloff. There are contradictory reports of Lugosi's attitude toward Karloff, some claiming that he was openly resentful of Karloff's long-term success and ability to get good roles beyond the horror arena, while others suggested the two actors were — for a time, at least — good friends. Karloff himself in interviews suggested that Lugosi was initially mistrustful of him when they acted together, believing that the Englishman would attempt to upstage him. When this proved not to be the case, according to Karloff, Lugosi settled down and they worked together amicably (though some have further commented that Karloff's on-set demand to break from filming for mid-afternoon tea annoyed Lugosi). Karloff also insinuated that his iconic rival could not act, claiming Lugosi had "never learned his trade". Universal did cast Lugosi in a couple of heroic parts, as in "<a href="The%20Black%20Cat%20%281934%20film%29">The Black Cat</a>" after Karloff had been accorded the more colorful role of the villain, "<a href="The%20Invisible%20Ray%20%281936%20film%29">The Invisible Ray</a>", and a romantic role in the adventure serial "<a href="The%20Return%20of%20Chandu">The Return of Chandu</a>", but his typecasting problem appears to have been too entrenched to be alleviated by those films. Of course, Karloff had a leg up on Lugosi simply by being a native English speaker; Lugosi had to learn English as a second language, and was never able to shed his heavy accent.

Lugosi addressed his plea to be cast in non-horror roles directly to casting directors through his listing in the 1937 "Players Directory", published by the Motion Picture Academy, in which he (or his agent) calls the idea that he is only fit for horror films "an error."

A number of factors worked against Lugosi's career in the mid-1930s. Universal changed management in 1936, and because of a British ban on horror films, dropped them from their production schedule; Lugosi found himself consigned to Universal's non-horror <a href="B-movie">B-film</a> unit, at times in small roles where he was obviously used for "name value" only. Throughout the 1930s, Lugosi, experiencing a severe career decline despite popularity with audiences (Universal executives always preferred his rival Karloff), accepted many leading roles from independent producers like Nat Levine, <a href="Sol%20Lesser">Sol Lesser</a>, and <a href="Sam%20Katzman">Sam Katzman</a>. These low-budget thrillers indicate that Lugosi was less discriminating than Karloff in selecting screen vehicles, but the exposure helped Lugosi financially if not artistically. Lugosi tried to keep busy with stage work, but had to borrow money from the Actors' Fund to pay hospital bills when his only child, Bela George Lugosi, was born in 1938.

Historian John McElwee reports, in his 2013 book "Showmen, Sell It Hot!", that Bela Lugosi's popularity received a much-needed boost in August 1938, when California theater owner Emil Umann revived "Dracula" and "Frankenstein" as a special double feature. The combination was so successful that Umann scheduled extra shows to accommodate the capacity crowds, and invited Lugosi to appear in person, which thrilled new audiences that had never seen Lugosi's classic performance. "I owe it all to that little man at the Regina Theatre," said Lugosi of exhibitor Umann. "I was dead, and he brought me back to life." Universal took notice of the tremendous business and launched its own national re-release of the same two horror favorites. The studio then rehired Lugosi to star in new films.

The first was Universal's "<a href="Son%20of%20Frankenstein">Son of Frankenstein</a>" (1939), when he played the character role of <a href="Igor%20%28fictional%20character%29">Ygor</a>, a mad blacksmith with a broken neck, in heavy makeup and beard. The same year saw Lugosi playing a straight character role in a major motion picture: he was a stern commissar in <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>'s comedy "<a href="Ninotchka">Ninotchka</a>", starring <a href="Greta%20Garbo">Greta Garbo</a>. This small but prestigious role could have been a turning point for the actor, but within the year, he was back on Hollywood's <a href="Poverty%20Row">Poverty Row</a>, playing leads for Sam Katzman. These horror, comedy and <a href="Mystery%20fiction">mystery</a> B-films were released by <a href="Monogram%20Pictures">Monogram Pictures</a>. At Universal, he often received star billing for what amounted to a supporting part. "<a href="The%20Gorilla%20%281939%20film%29">The Gorilla</a>" (1939) had him playing <a href="double%20act">straight man</a> to <a href="Patsy%20Kelly">Patsy Kelly</a>.
Ostensibly due to injuries received during military service, Lugosi developed severe, chronic <a href="sciatica">sciatica</a>. Though at first he was treated with pain remedies such as <a href="asparagus">asparagus</a> juice, doctors increased the medication to <a href="opiate">opiate</a>s. The growth of his dependence on pain-killers, particularly <a href="morphine">morphine</a> and, after 1947 when it became available in America, <a href="methadone">methadone</a>, was directly proportional to the dwindling of screen offers. He was finally cast in the role of Frankenstein's monster for Universal's "<a href="Frankenstein%20Meets%20the%20Wolf%20Man">Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man</a>" (1943), but Lugosi had no dialogue. Lugosi's voice had been dubbed over that of <a href="Lon%20Chaney%2C%20Jr.">Lon Chaney, Jr.</a>, from line readings at the end of "<a href="The%20Ghost%20of%20Frankenstein">The Ghost of Frankenstein</a>" (1942). Lugosi played Dracula for a second and last time on film in "<a href="Abbott%20and%20Costello%20Meet%20Frankenstein">Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein</a>" (1948).

"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" was Bela Lugosi's last "A" movie. For the remainder of his life he appeared — less and less frequently — in obscure, low-budget features. From 1947-50, he performed in <a href="summer%20stock">summer stock</a>, often in productions of "Dracula" or "<a href="Arsenic%20and%20Old%20Lace%20%28play%29">Arsenic and Old Lace</a>", and during the other parts of the year made personal appearances in a touring "spook show", and on early commercial television.

In September 1949 <a href="Milton%20Berle">Milton Berle</a> invited Lugosi to appear in a sketch on "<a href="Texaco%20Star%20Theater">Texaco Star Theater</a>". Lugosi memorized the script for the skit, but became confused on the air when Berle began to ad lib. His only television dramatic role was on the anthology series "Suspense" on October 11, 1949, in an adaptation of <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>'s "<a href="The%20Cask%20of%20Amontillado">The Cask of Amontillado</a>".

In 1951, while in <a href="England">England</a> to play a six-month tour of "Dracula", he co-starred in a lowbrow movie comedy, "<a href="Mother%20Riley%20Meets%20the%20Vampire">Mother Riley Meets the Vampire</a>" (also known as "Vampire over London" and "My Son, the Vampire"). Following his return to the U.S., he was interviewed for television, and reflected wistfully on his typecasting in horror parts: "Now I am the boogie man." In the same interview he expressed a desire to play more comedy, as he had in the Mother Riley farce. Independent producer Jack Broder took Lugosi at his word, casting him in a jungle-themed comedy, "<a href="Bela%20Lugosi%20Meets%20a%20Brooklyn%20Gorilla">Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla</a>" co-starring nightclub comedians <a href="Duke%20Mitchell">Duke Mitchell</a> and <a href="Sammy%20Petrillo">Sammy Petrillo</a>, whose act closely resembled that of <a href="Dean%20Martin">Dean Martin</a> and <a href="Jerry%20Lewis">Jerry Lewis</a>.

While Lugosi enjoyed a lively career on stage with plenty of personal appearances, as film offers declined, he became more and more dependent on live venues to support his family. Bela took over the role of Jonathan Brewster from Boris Karloff for "<a href="Arsenic%20and%20Old%20Lace%20%28play%29">Arsenic and Old Lace</a>". Bela had also expressed interest in playing Elwood P. Dowd in "<a href="Harvey%20%28play%29">Harvey</a>" to help him professionally. He also made plenty of personal appearances to promote his horror image and/or an accompanying film.

Late in his life, Bela Lugosi again received star billing in movies when ambitious filmmaker <a href="Ed%20Wood">Ed Wood</a>, a fan of Lugosi, found him living in obscurity and near-poverty and offered him roles in his films, such as an anonymous narrator in "<a href="Glen%20or%20Glenda">Glen or Glenda</a>" and a <a href="Victor%20Frankenstein">Dr. Frankenstein</a>-like <a href="mad%20scientist">mad scientist</a> in "<a href="Bride%20of%20the%20Monster">Bride of the Monster</a>". During <a href="post-production">post-production</a> of the latter, Lugosi decided to seek treatment for his <a href="drug%20addiction">drug addiction</a>, and the premiere of the film was said to be intended to help pay for his hospital expenses. According to <a href="Kitty%20Kelley">Kitty Kelley</a>'s biography of <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>, when the entertainer heard of Lugosi's problems, he helped with expenses and visited at the hospital. He would recall Lugosi's amazement at his visit, since the two men did not know each other.

During an impromptu interview upon his exit from the treatment center in 1955, Lugosi stated that he was about to go to work on a new Ed Wood film, "The Ghoul Goes West". This was one of several projects proposed by Wood, including "The Phantom Ghoul" and "Dr. Acula". With Lugosi in his famed Dracula cape, Wood shot impromptu test footage, with no storyline in mind, in front of <a href="Tor%20Johnson">Tor Johnson</a>'s home, a suburban graveyard and in front of Lugosi's apartment building on Carlton Way. This footage ended up in "<a href="Plan%209%20from%20Outer%20Space">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a>", which was mostly filmed after Lugosi's death. Wood hired <a href="Tom%20Mason">Tom Mason</a>, his wife's <a href="chiropractor">chiropractor</a>, to double for Lugosi in additional shots. Mason was noticeably taller and thinner than Lugosi, and had the lower half of his face covered with his cape in every shot, as Lugosi sometimes did in "<a href="Abbott%20and%20Costello%20Meet%20Frankenstein">Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein</a>".

Following his treatment, Lugosi made one final film, in late 1955, "<a href="The%20Black%20Sleep">The Black Sleep</a>", for Bel-Air Pictures, which was released in the summer of 1956 through <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a> with a promotional campaign that included several personal appearances. To his disappointment, however, his role in this film was of a <a href="Muteness">mute</a>, with no dialogue.

In 1917, Lugosi married Ilona Szmik. The couple divorced in 1920, reputedly over political differences with her parents. In 1921, he married Ilona con Montagh, and divorced in 1924. In 1929, Lugosi took his place in Hollywood society and scandal when he married wealthy <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> widow Beatrice Weeks, but she filed for divorce four months later. Weeks cited actress <a href="Clara%20Bow">Clara Bow</a> as the "other woman".

On 26 June 1931, he became a naturalised United States citizen. In 1933, he married 19-year-old Lillian Arch, the daughter of Hungarian immigrants. They had a child, <a href="Bela%20G.%20Lugosi">Bela G. Lugosi</a>, in 1938.

Lillian and Bela, as well as his mother, vacationed on their lake property in <a href="Lake%20Elsinore%2C%20California">Lake Elsinore, California</a> (then called Elsinore), on two lots between 1944 and 1953. Bela Lugosi Jr. attended the Elsinore Naval & Military School in Lake Elsinore. Lillian and Béla divorced in 1953, at least partially because of Béla's jealousy over Lillian taking a full-time job as an assistant to <a href="Brian%20Donlevy">Brian Donlevy</a> on the sets and studios for Donlevy's radio and television series "Dangerous Assignment" – Lillian eventually did marry <a href="Brian%20Donlevy">Brian Donlevy</a>, in 1966. Lugosi married Hope Lininger, his fifth wife, in 1955; they remained married until his death. She had been a fan, writing letters to him when he was in the hospital recovering from addiction to <a href="Demerol">Demerol</a>. She would sign her letters "A dash of Hope". She died in 1997 at age 77.

Lugosi died of a <a href="heart%20attack">heart attack</a> on August 16, 1956, while lying on a bed in his <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> apartment. He was 73. The rumor that Lugosi was clutching the script for "<a href="Final%20Curtain%20%28film%29">The Final Curtain</a>", a planned Ed Wood project, at the time of his death is not true.

Lugosi was buried wearing one of the "Dracula" cape costumes, per the request of his son and fifth wife, in the <a href="Holy%20Cross%20Cemetery%2C%20Culver%20City">Holy Cross Cemetery</a> in <a href="Culver%20City%2C%20California">Culver City, California</a>. Contrary to popular belief, Lugosi never requested to be buried in his cloak; <a href="Bela%20G.%20Lugosi">Bela G. Lugosi</a> confirmed on numerous occasions that he and his mother, Lillian, actually made the decision but believed that it is what his father would have wanted.

In 1979, the "<a href="Lugosi%20v.%20Universal%20Pictures">Lugosi v. Universal Pictures</a>" decision by the <a href="California%20Supreme%20Court">California Supreme Court</a> held that Lugosi's <a href="personality%20rights">personality rights</a> could not pass to his heirs, as a <a href="copyright">copyright</a> would have. The court ruled that under California law any rights of publicity, including the right to his image, terminated with Lugosi's death.
In <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a>'s "<a href="Ed%20Wood%20%28film%29">Ed Wood</a>", Lugosi is played by <a href="Martin%20Landau">Martin Landau</a>, who received the 1994 <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor</a>. According to <a href="Bela%20G.%20Lugosi">Bela G. Lugosi</a> (his son), <a href="Forrest%20Ackerman">Forrest Ackerman</a>, <a href="Dolores%20Fuller">Dolores Fuller</a> and Richard Sheffield, the film's portrayal of Lugosi is inaccurate: In real life, he never used profanity, owned small dogs, or slept in coffins. And contrary to this film, Bela did not struggle performing on "<a href="The%20Red%20Skelton%20Show">The Red Skelton Show</a>".

Three Lugosi projects were featured on the television show "<a href="Mystery%20Science%20Theater%203000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a>". "<a href="The%20Corpse%20Vanishes">The Corpse Vanishes</a>" appeared in episode 105, the serial "<a href="The%20Phantom%20Creeps">The Phantom Creeps</a>" throughout season two and the Ed Wood production "<a href="Bride%20of%20the%20Monster">Bride of the Monster</a>" in episode 423.
An episode of "<a href="Sledge%20Hammer%21">Sledge Hammer!</a>" titled "Last of the Red Hot Vampires" was a homage to Bela Lugosi; at the end of the episode, it was dedicated to "Mr. Blasko".

In 2001, <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> broadcast "There Are Such Things" by <a href="Steven%20McNicoll">Steven McNicoll</a> and Mark McDonnell.

The cape Lugosi wore in "<a href="Dracula%20%281931%20English-language%20film%29">Dracula</a>" (1931) still survives today in the ownership of Universal Studios.

The theatrical play "Lugosi - a vámpír árnyéka" ("Lugosi - the Shadow of the Vampire", in <a href="Hungarian%20language">Hungarian</a>) is based on Lugosi's life, telling the story of his life as he became typecast as Dracula and as his drug addiction worsened.

Bride of the Monster

Bride of the Monster is a 1955 American <a href="Science%20fiction%20film">science fiction</a> <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a> directed, written, and produced by <a href="Ed%20Wood">Edward D. Wood, Jr.</a>, and starring <a href="Bela%20Lugosi">Bela Lugosi</a>, along with <a href="Tor%20Johnson">Tor Johnson</a>, Tony McCoy, and <a href="Loretta%20King%20Hadler">Loretta King</a>.

The film is considered to have Wood's biggest budget ($70,000). Production commenced in 1953 but, due to further financial problems, wasn't completed until 1955.

A <a href="sequel">sequel</a>, entitled "<a href="Night%20of%20the%20Ghouls">Night of the Ghouls</a>", was finished in 1959, but due to last-minute financial problems, was not released until 1987.

In a stretch of woods, two hunters are caught in a "raging <a href="thunderstorm">thunderstorm</a>". They decide to seek refuge in Willows House, which is supposedly <a href="Abandoned%20property">abandoned</a> and <a href="Haunted%20house">haunted</a>. When they reach Willows House, they find it to be occupied and the current owner repeatedly denies them hospitality. One of the hunters attempts to force his entry into the house, but a giant <a href="octopus">octopus</a> is released from its tank and sent after the intruders. One of the fleeing hunters is killed by the octopus, while the other is captured by the giant. The owner is a scientist, Dr. Eric Vornoff, and the giant is his mute assistant, Lobo. Vornoff explains that he will perform an experiment on the unwilling hunter, who dies on the operating table.

In a police station, Officer Tom Robbins sees Lieutenant Dick Craig. There are now 12 missing victims, and the police still do not know what happened to them. The reporter behind the newspaper reports is Janet Lawton, Craig's <a href="Engagement">fiancée</a>. Janet forces her way into the office and argues with Robbins, and vows to go to Lake Marsh to investigate. At the police station, Robbins and Craig have a meeting with an intellectual from Europe, Professor Vladimir Strowski, who agrees to assist the police in investigating the Marsh, but not at night. As night falls and another storm begins, Janet drives alone to Lake Marsh, but visibility is poor and she drives off the road and into a <a href="ravine">ravine</a>. Lobo rescues her.

Janet awakens to find herself a prisoner of Vornoff, who uses <a href="hypnosis">hypnosis</a> to put her back to sleep. The following day, Craig and his partner drive to the area around Lake Marsh, a <a href="swamp">swamp</a>. The partners also discuss the strange weather and mention that the newspapers could be right about <a href="History%20of%20nuclear%20weapons">"the atom bomb explosions distorting the atmosphere"</a>. The duo eventually discover Janet's abandoned car and realize she is the 13th missing victim. They leave the swamp while, Strowski drives a rented car to the swamp.

Janet awakens at Willows House. Vornoff assures her that Lobo is harmless, but the giant seems fascinated with the female captive and approaches her with questionable intent. Vornoff explains the giant is human and that Vornoff found him in the "<a href="wilderness">wilderness</a> of <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a>". Vornoff then hypnotically places Janet back to sleep. He orders Lobo to transport the captive to Vornoff's private quarters. Meanwhile, Strowski silently approaches Willows House and enters through the unlocked front door. While Strowski searches the house, Vornoff arrives to greet him. Their country of origin is interested in Vornoff's groundbreaking experiments with <a href="atomic%20energy">atomic energy</a> and wants to recruit him. Vornoff narrates that two decades prior, Vornoff had suggested using experiments with <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear power</a> which could create <a href="superhuman">superhuman</a>s of great strength and size. In response, he was branded a <a href="Mad%20scientist">madman</a> and <a href="exile">exile</a>d by his country. Strowski reveals that he has dreams of conquest in the name of their country, while Vornoff dreams of his creations conquering in his own name. By late evening, Craig and his partner return to the swamp and discover Strowski's abandoned car. The partners split up to search the area, Craig heading towards Willows House. Back in the secret laboratory, Vornoff uses a wave of his hand to summon Janet to his current location. She arrives dressed as a <a href="bride">bride</a>, summoned through <a href="telepathy">telepathy</a>. He has decided to use her as the next subject of his experiments. Lobo is reluctant to take part in this experiment, and Vornoff uses a <a href="whip">whip</a> to re-assert his control over his slave and assistant. Meanwhile, Craig has entered the house and accidentally discovers the secret passage. He is himself captured by Vornoff and Lobo.

As the experiment is about to begin, Lobo, is visibly distressed. Taking his decision, Lobo rebels and attacks Vornoff. After a fight, Lobo knocks Vornoff out, releases Janet, and transports the unconscious Vornoff to the operating table. The scientist becomes the subject of his own human experiment. This time the experiment works and Vornoff is transformed to an atomic-powered superhuman being. He and Lobo physically struggle with each other, and their fight destroys the laboratory and starts a fire. Vornoff grabs Janet and escapes from the flames. Robbins and other officers arrive to help Craig. The police pursue Vornoff through the woods. There is another thunderstorm, and a <a href="lightning%20strike">lightning strike</a> further destroys Willows House. With his home and equipment destroyed, a distressed Vornoff abandons Janet and merely attempts to escape. Craig rolls a rock at him and lands him in the water with the octopus. They struggle until a nuclear explosion obliterate both combatants, apparently the end result of the chain reaction started at the destroyed laboratory. Robbins comments that Vornoff "<a href="Playing%20God%20%28ethics%29">tampered in God's domain</a>".

The first incarnation of the film was a 1953 script by <a href="Alex%20Gordon%20%28writer-producer%29">Alex Gordon</a> titled "The Atomic Monster", but a lack of financing prevented any production. Later Ed Wood revived the project as "The Monster of the Marshes". Actual shooting began in October 1954 at the Ted Allan Studios, but further money problems quickly halted the production. The required funds were supplied by a rancher named Donald McCoy, who became the film's producer. He also provided his son to star as the film's hero. According to screenwriter Dennis Rodriguez, casting the younger McCoy as a protagonist was one of two terms Donald imposed on Wood. The other term was to include an atomic explosion in the finale. Production resumed in 1955 at Centaur Studios.

The film premiered at Hollywood's <a href="El%20Capitan%20Theatre">Paramount theater</a> in May 1955, under the title "Bride of the Atom". The film was reportedly completed and released through a deal with <a href="Samuel%20Z.%20Arkoff">Samuel Z. Arkoff</a>. Arkoff profited from the film more than Wood, and his earnings contributed to the funding of <a href="American%20International%20Pictures">American International Pictures</a>. The end credits identify the copyright holder of the film as "Filmakers Releasing Organization". Distribution rights were held by Banner Films in the United States, and by Exclusive in the United Kingdom.

The film combines elements of <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> and <a href="horror%20fiction">horror fiction</a>, genres which were frequently combined in films of the 1950s. Like many of these contemporaries, "Bride" serves in part as a <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> <a href="propaganda%20film">propaganda film</a>. Once again, an external threat from "<a href="Old%20Europe%20%28politics%29">Old Europe</a>" serves as the enemy of the righteous <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States%20%281945%E2%80%9364%29">United States</a>. In Cold War <a href="Thriller%20%28genre%29">thrillers</a>, foreign nations served as a <a href="Defamation">vilified</a> and <a href="Demonization">demonized</a> <a href="Other%20%28philosophy%29">Other</a> for American audiences. The country of origin for Vornoff and Strowski is left unnamed. The only clues is that it is European and has its own dreams of conquest. By implication, the country which exiled Vornoff in the 1930s could be <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> or the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Their role as villains for the American cinema had already been solidified by the 1950s, and Wood could be alluding to both of them. Strowski uses the term <a href="master%20race">master race</a>, which is a key concept in <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a>.

Both the working title "Bride of the Atom" and the final title "Bride of the Monster" allude to the earlier film "<a href="Bride%20of%20Frankenstein">Bride of Frankenstein</a>" (1935). The film otherwise follows the template of the <a href="Poverty%20Row">Poverty Row</a> <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a>s of the 1940s. The <a href="Atomic%20Age">Atomic Age</a> influences the film in its ominous implications concerning <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s and the threat they posed towards human civilization. Rob Craig makes an argument for including the film in a subgenre of Cold War-themed thrillers along with "<a href="Kiss%20Me%20Deadly">Kiss Me Deadly</a>" (1955), "<a href="The%20World%2C%20the%20Flesh%20and%20the%20Devil%20%281959%20film%29">The World, the Flesh and the Devil</a>" (1959), "<a href="On%20the%20Beach%20%281959%20film%29">On the Beach</a>" (1959), "<a href="The%20Manchurian%20Candidate%20%281962%20film%29">The Manchurian Candidate</a>" (1962), "<a href="Dr.%20Strangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a>" (1964), "<a href="Seven%20Days%20in%20May">Seven Days in May</a>" (1964), and "<a href="Fail%20Safe%20%281964%20film%29">Fail-Safe</a>" (1964).

This was <a href="Bela%20Lugosi">Bela Lugosi</a>'s last speaking role in a feature film. Lugosi subsequently played a silent part in "<a href="The%20Black%20Sleep">The Black Sleep</a>" (1956). "<a href="Plan%209%20from%20Outer%20Space">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a>" (1959) uses silent archive footage of Lugosi, but he died prior to the creation of its script. The footage was from an unfinished film called "The Vampire's Tomb". "<a href="Lock%20Up%20Your%20Daughters%20%281959%20film%29">Lock Up Your Daughters</a>" (1959) recycled footage from Lugosi's earlier films, possibly mixed with some new material. According to Rob Craig, in "Bride" Lugosi for the last time plays "a charismatic <a href="villain">villain</a> whose <a href="megalomania">megalomania</a> leads to downfall and destruction". Craig considers this to be one of Lugosi's finest roles, citing the surprisingly energetic performance of the aging actor. The scenes involving hypnosis contain <a href="close-up">close-up</a>s of Lugosi's eyes. Wood was probably trying to re-create similar scenes from an older film of Lugosi, "<a href="White%20Zombie%20%28film%29">White Zombie</a>" (1932). Lugosi did not actually play Vornoff in the scenes demanding physical combat. The film made use of <a href="body%20double">body double</a>s for Lugosi: <a href="Eddie%20Parker%20%28actor%29">Eddie Parker</a> and Red Reagan. Parker was also the body-double of Lugosi in "<a href="Frankenstein%20Meets%20the%20Wolf%20Man">Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man</a>" (1943). Lugosi's fee for the film is estimated at 1000 <a href="dollar">dollar</a>s.

The story could almost be a sequel to an earlier Bela Lugosi movie, "The Corpse Vanishes" (Each bride at her wedding was given an orchid, which she sniffed before passing out. In "The Corpse Vanishes" Bela played a doctor who captured the brides and took some kind of liquid from each bride's body and injected it into his wife to make her temporarily young again. Characters included his wife, an old woman, the old woman's grown son, and a dwarf.) In "Bride of the Monster" Bela again plays a doctor doing experiments, but his only housemate/assistant is Lobo, and when his experiment fails to turn someone into an "atomic-powered superman", he throws the dead body to an octopus or an alligator, similar to what Bela did in "Murders in the Rue Morgue". 

The hunters of the opening scenes are unnamed in the actual scenes, but identified later in the film as Jake Long and Blake "Mac" McCreigh. According to the credits, Jake was played by John Warren and Mac by <a href="Bud%20Osborne">Bud Osborne</a>. The police office scenes feature cameos by a drunk and a newspaper seller. The former is played by Ben Frommer (known for playing Count Bloodcount in "<a href="Transylvania%206-5000%20%281963%20film%29">Transylvania 6-5000</a>"), the latter is played by <a href="William%20Benedict">William Benedict</a> (known as one of <a href="The%20Bowery%20Boys">The Bowery Boys</a>). Janet Lawton briefly speaks with a co-worker called Margie. Margie is played by <a href="Dolores%20Fuller">Dolores Fuller</a>. Dick Craig's partner, Martin, is played by Don Nagel. Both Fuller and Nagel had worked with Wood in "<a href="Jail%20Bait%20%281954%20film%29">Jail Bait</a>" (1954).

The film uses both stock footage of a real octopus and a fake, rubber octopus in scenes where "the monster" interacts with actors. It is widely believed this is a prop from the film "<a href="Wake%20of%20the%20Red%20Witch">Wake of the Red Witch</a>" (1948). Contradictory accounts claim that Wood either stole or rented the prop from <a href="Republic%20Pictures">Republic Pictures</a>, which produced the earlier film. The struggle between Vornoff and the octopus was filmed at <a href="Griffith%20Park">Griffith Park</a>.

Craig comments that there is a stark contrast between the characters of Dick Craig and Janet Lawton. Dick speaks in a <a href="deadpan">deadpan</a> unemotional way and seems to be a rather lethargic character. Janet is a "brassy girl reporter", a dynamic character with a sense of autonomy. The role was reportedly intended for <a href="Dolores%20Fuller">Dolores Fuller</a>. According to Fuller's recollections, <a href="Loretta%20King%20Hadler">Loretta King</a> bribed Wood into casting her as Janet, with promises of securing further funding for the film. Fuller was so reduced to a cameo role. King vehemently denies bribing Wood, so the story lacks confirmation.

In a subplot of the film, there are storms every night for three months and strange weather patterns. The characters attribute the phenomenon to the effects the <a href="nuclear%20explosion">nuclear explosion</a>s have on the atmosphere. This probably reflects actual anxiety of the 1950s about potential <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>. Until the <a href="Partial%20Nuclear%20Test%20Ban%20Treaty">Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty</a> (1963), atmospheric <a href="nuclear%20weapons%20testing">nuclear weapons testing</a> was used widely and recklessly. Rob Craig suggests that the months of constant storms could be inspired by the <a href="Genesis%20flood%20narrative">Genesis flood narrative</a>. In the context of the film, the strange weather is implied to be a side-effect of the experiments of Vornoff which apparently release radioactivity to the atmosphere.

The dialogue of the film includes memorable lines such as ""Home? I have no home!"" and ""One is always considered mad, when one discovers something which others cannot grasp"". The phrases could well apply to the fates of <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> artists and thinkers. The title ""Bride of the Atom"", which Vornoff uses for Janet in the bridal dress, is inexplicable unless the scientist is actually attempting to use Janet to replace his long-lost wife. One of his re-assuring lines to Janet concerning the experiment, ""It hurts, just for a moment, but then you will emerge a woman..."", sounds as if preparing her for the loss of her <a href="virginity">virginity</a>. The scene of a young woman, in a bridal gown, restrained by leather shackles seems to be <a href="Sadomasochism">sadomasochistic</a> in nature.

Throughout the film, the mute Lobo is implied to have an unspecified <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a> and to be of sub-human intelligence. Yet he successfully operates complex machinery as if trained to do so. Craig views this scene as implying that supposedly "dumb" servants, can have a capacity of learning the secrets of their masters .

The final scenes, with the <a href="mushroom%20cloud">mushroom cloud</a> of the nuclear explosion, use stock footage from the blast of a <a href="thermonuclear%20weapon">thermonuclear weapon</a> ("hydrogen bomb").

The apparent fetish of Lobo with <a href="angora%20wool">angora wool</a> is a reflection of Wood's own fetish for the material. This also serves as the film's connection to "<a href="Glen%20or%20Glenda">Glen or Glenda</a>" (1953), where the fetish plays a more prominent role.

The character of Lobo also appeared again in Wood's "<a href="Night%20of%20the%20Ghouls">Night of the Ghouls</a>". This film served as a sequel of sorts to "Bride". Vornoff is absent from the later film, but there are references to the activities of "the mad doctor".

This film is part of what Wood aficionados refer to as "The Kelton Trilogy", a trio of films featuring <a href="Paul%20Marco">Paul Marco</a> as "Officer Kelton", a whining, reluctant policeman. The other two films are "<a href="Plan%209%20from%20Outer%20Space">Plan 9 from Outer Space</a>" and "<a href="Night%20of%20the%20Ghouls">Night of the Ghouls</a>". Kelton is the only character to appear in all three films.

In 1986, the film was featured in the syndicated series, the "<a href="Canned%20Film%20Festival">Canned Film Festival</a>" and was later featured on the comedy series, "<a href="Mystery%20Science%20Theater%203000">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a>".

The late '90s dream trance track "Alright", by DJ Taucher, sampled a monologue from Bela Lugosi during the interlude of the song.

In 2008, a <a href="Film%20colorization">colorized</a> version was released by <a href="Legend%20Films">Legend Films</a>. This version is also available from <a href="Amazon%20Video%20on%20Demand">Amazon Video on Demand</a>.

In 2010, a retrospective on the movie entitled "Citizen Wood: Making ‘The Bride,’ Unmaking the Legend" was included in the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" Volume 19 DVD set as a bonus feature for said episode featuring the movie. <a href="Horror%20host">Horror host</a> <a href="Mr.%20Lobo">Mr. Lobo</a> is among the interviewees of the 27 minute documentary.

In 1980, the book "<a href="The%20Golden%20Turkey%20Awards">The Golden Turkey Awards</a>" claims that Lugosi's character declares his manservant Lobo (<a href="Tor%20Johnson">Tor Johnson</a>) "as harmless as kitchen" . This allegedly misspoken line is cited as evidence of either Lugosi's failing health/mental faculties, or as further evidence of Wood's incompetence as a director. However, a viewing of the film itself reveals that Lugosi said this line correctly, the exact words being, ""Don't be afraid of Lobo; he's as gentle as a kitten."" The easier explanation would be that authors <a href="Michael%20Medved">Michael Medved</a> and Harry Medved saw the film in a theater setting with inferior sound quality. A single viewing in such conditions could result in mishearing some lines of dialogue. Unfortunately the inaccurate claim managed to achieve <a href="urban%20legend">urban legend</a> status, and it keeps circulating.

In 1994, the biopic "<a href="Ed%20Wood%20%28film%29">Ed Wood</a>", directed by <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a>, alleged that Wood and the filmmakers stole the mechanical <a href="octopus">octopus</a> (previously used in the film "<a href="Wake%20of%20the%20Red%20Witch">Wake of the Red Witch</a>") from the <a href="Republic%20Pictures">Republic Studios</a> backlot, while failing to steal the motor which enabled the prop to move realistically, although, by the director's admission, the film preferred narrative interest over historical accuracy. These events are also alleged in the 2004 documentary, "The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made." However, other stories circulated insist Wood legitimately rented the octopus, along with some cars. To remedy the lack of movement from the octopus prop, whenever someone was killed by the monster in the film, they simply flailed around in the shallow water while holding the tentacles to imitate movement. The filming of these scenes, as well as the production of the film in general, were played to comic effect in "Ed Wood".

Rudolph Grey's book "Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood Jr." contains anecdotes regarding the making of this film.
Grey notes that participants in the original events sometimes contradict one another, but he relates each person's information for posterity. He also includes Ed Wood's claim that one of his films made a profit and surmises that it was most likely "Bride of the Monster", but that Wood had oversold the film and could not reimburse the backers.

<doc id="5036" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5036" title="Berry paradox">
Berry paradox

The Berry paradox is a <a href="self-referential">self-referential</a> <a href="paradox">paradox</a> arising from an expression like "the smallest positive integer not definable in fewer than twelve <a href="word">word</a>s" (note that this defining phrase has eleven words). <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, the first to discuss the paradox in print, attributed it to G. G. Berry (1867–1928), a junior <a href="librarian">librarian</a> at <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>'s <a href="Bodleian%20library">Bodleian library</a>.

Consider the expression:

Since there are only twenty-six letters in English alphabet, there are finitely many phrases of under sixty letters, and hence finitely many positive integers that are defined by phrases of under sixty letters. Since there are infinitely many positive integers, this means that there are positive integers that cannot be defined by phrases of under sixty letters. If there are positive integers that satisfy a given property, then there is a "smallest" positive integer that satisfies that property; therefore, there is a smallest positive integer satisfying the property "not definable in under sixty letters". This is the integer to which the above expression refers. The above expression is only fifty-seven letters long, therefore it "is" definable in under sixty letters, and is "not" the smallest positive integer not definable in under sixty letters, and is "not" defined by this expression. This is a paradox: there must be an integer defined by this expression, but since the expression is self-contradictory (any integer it defines is definable in under sixty letters), there cannot be any integer defined by it.

Perhaps another helpful analogy to Berry's Paradox would be the phrase, "indescribable feeling". If the feeling is indeed indescribable, then no description of the feeling would be true. But if the word "indescribable" communicates something about the feeling, then it may be considered a description: this is self-contradictory.

The Berry paradox as formulated above arises because of systematic <a href="ambiguity">ambiguity</a> in the word "definable". In other formulations of the Berry paradox, such as one that instead reads: "...not <a href="name">name</a>able in less..." the term "nameable" is also one that has this systematic ambiguity. Terms of this kind give rise to <a href="vicious%20circle%20principle">vicious circle</a> fallacies. Other terms with this type of ambiguity are: satisfiable, true, false, function, property, class, relation, cardinal, and ordinal. To resolve one of these paradoxes means to pinpoint exactly where our use of language went wrong and to provide restrictions on the use of language which may avoid them.

This family of paradoxes can be resolved by incorporating stratifications of meaning in language. Terms with systematic ambiguity may be written with subscripts denoting that one level of meaning is considered a higher priority than another in their interpretation. "The number not nameable in less than eleven words" may be nameable in less than eleven words under this scheme.

Using programs or proofs of bounded lengths, it is possible to construct an analogue of the Berry expression in a formal mathematical language, as has been done by <a href="Gregory%20Chaitin">Gregory Chaitin</a>. Though the formal analogue does not lead to a logical contradiction, it does prove certain impossibility results.

<a href="George%20Boolos">George Boolos</a> (1989) built on a formalized version of Berry's paradox to prove <a href="G%C3%B6del%27s%20Incompleteness%20Theorem">Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem</a> in a new and much simpler way. The basic idea of his proof is that a <a href="proposition">proposition</a> that holds of "x" if and only if "x" = "n" for some natural number "n" can be called a "definition" for "n", and that the set {("n", "k"): "n" has a definition that is "k" symbols long} can be shown to be representable (using <a href="G%C3%B6del%20number">Gödel number</a>s). Then the proposition ""m" is the first number not definable in less than "k" symbols" can be formalized and shown to be a definition in the sense just stated.

It is not possible in general to unambiguously define what is the minimal number of symbols required to describe a given string (given a specific description mechanism). In this context, the terms "string" and "number" may be used interchangeably, since a number is actually a string of symbols, e.g. an English word (like the word "eleven" used in the paradox) while, on the other hand, it is possible to refer to any word with a number, e.g. by the number of its position in a given dictionary or by suitable encoding. Some long strings can be described exactly using fewer symbols than those required by their full representation, as is often achieved using <a href="data%20compression">data compression</a>. The complexity of a given string is then defined as the minimal length that a description requires in order to (unambiguously) refer to the full representation of that string.

The Kolmogorov complexity is defined using <a href="formal%20language">formal language</a>s, or <a href="Turing%20machines">Turing machines</a> which avoids ambiguities about which string results from a given description. It can be proven that the Kolmogorov complexity is not computable. The proof by contradiction shows that if it were possible to compute the Kolmogorov complexity, then it would also be possible to systematically generate paradoxes similar to this one, i.e. descriptions shorter than what the complexity of the described string implies. That is to say, the definition of the Berry number is paradoxical because it is not actually possible to compute how many words are required to define a number, and we know that such computation is not possible because of the paradox.
