Anglicanism

Anglicanism is a <a href="Western%20Christianity">Western</a> <a href="Christian%20tradition">Christian tradition</a> that evolved out of the practices, liturgy and identity of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> following the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> in the 16th century. The word "Anglican" itself has its background in "ecclesia anglicana", a <a href="medieval%20Latin">medieval Latin</a> phrase dating to the 12th century or earlier, which means the "English Church".

Adherents of Anglicanism are called "Anglicans". The majority of Anglicans are members of national or regional <a href="Ecclesiastical%20province%23Anglican%20Communion">ecclesiastical provinces</a> of the international <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a>, which forms the third-largest Christian <a href="Communion%20%28Christian%29">communion</a> in the world, after the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> and the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>. They are in <a href="full%20communion">full communion</a> with the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Canterbury">See of Canterbury</a>, and thus the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, whom the communion refers to as its "<a href="Primus%20inter%20pares%23Anglican%20Communion">primus inter pares</a>". He calls the decennial <a href="Lambeth%20Conference">Lambeth Conference</a>, chairs the meeting of <a href="primate%20%28bishop%29">primate</a>s, and the <a href="Anglican%20Consultative%20Council">Anglican Consultative Council</a>. Some churches that are not part of the Anglican Communion also consider themselves Anglican, including those that are part of the <a href="Continuing%20Anglican%20movement">Continuing Anglican movement</a> and the <a href="Anglican%20realignment">Anglican realignment</a> movement.

Anglicans base their Christian faith on the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>, traditions of the apostolic Church, <a href="apostolic%20succession">apostolic succession</a> ("historic episcopate"), and writings of the <a href="Church%20Fathers">Church Fathers</a>. Anglicanism forms one of the branches of <a href="Western%20Christianity">Western Christianity</a>; having definitively declared its independence from the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a> at the time of the <a href="Elizabethan%20Religious%20Settlement">Elizabethan Religious Settlement</a>. Many of the new Anglican formularies of the mid-16th century corresponded closely to those of contemporary <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>. These reforms in the Church of England were understood by one of those most responsible for them, the then <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>, as navigating a middle way between two of the emerging Protestant traditions, namely <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a> and <a href="Calvinism">Calvinism</a>. By the end of the century, the retention in Anglicanism of many traditional liturgical forms and of the episcopate was already seen as unacceptable by those promoting the most developed Protestant principles.

In the first half of the 17th century, the Church of England and its associated <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> were presented by some Anglican divines as comprising a distinct Christian tradition, with theologies, structures, and forms of worship representing a different kind of middle way, or "<a href="via%20media">via media</a>", between Protestantism and Roman Catholicism – a perspective that came to be highly influential in later theories of Anglican identity and expressed in the description of Anglicanism as "Catholic and Reformed". The degree of distinction between Protestant and Catholic tendencies within the Anglican tradition is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion. Unique to Anglicanism is the <a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>, the collection of services that worshippers in most Anglican churches have used for centuries, and is thus acknowledged as one of the ties that bind the Anglican Communion together.

After the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>, Anglican congregations in the United States and <a href="British%20North%20America">British North America</a> (which would later form the basis for the modern country of Canada) were each reconstituted into autonomous churches with their own bishops and self-governing structures; these were known as the American <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopal Church</a> and the <a href="Anglican%20Church%20of%20Canada">Church of England in the Dominion of Canada</a>. Through the expansion of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> and the activity of <a href="Christian%20mission">Christian mission</a>s, this model was adopted as the model for many newly formed churches, especially in Africa, <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>, and Asia-Pacific. In the 19th century, the term "Anglicanism" was coined to describe the common religious tradition of these churches; as also that of the <a href="Scottish%20Episcopal%20Church">Scottish Episcopal Church</a>, which, though originating earlier within the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a>, had come to be recognised as sharing this common identity.

The word "Anglican" originates in , a <a href="medieval%20Latin">medieval Latin</a> phrase dating to at least 1246 that means the "English Church". Adherents of Anglicanism are called "Anglicans". As an adjective, "Anglican" is used to describe the people, institutions and churches, as well as the liturgical traditions and theological concepts developed by the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>. As a noun, an Anglican is a member of a church in the Anglican Communion. The word is also used by followers of separated groups which have left the communion or have been founded separately from it, although this is sometimes considered as a misuse. The word "Anglicanism" came into being in the 19th century. The word originally referred only to the teachings and rites of Christians throughout the world in communion with the <a href="Episcopal%20see">see</a> of <a href="Diocese%20of%20Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, but has come to sometimes be extended to any church following those traditions rather than actual membership in the modern <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a>.

Although the term "Anglican" is found referring to the Church of England as far back as the 16th century, its use did not become general until the latter half of the 19th century. In British parliamentary legislation referring to the English <a href="established%20church">established church</a>, there is no need for a description; it is simply the Church of England, though the word "Protestant" is used in many Acts specifying the succession to the Crown and qualifications for office. When the <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201800">Union with Ireland Act</a> created the United Church of England and Ireland, it is specified that it shall be one "Protestant Episcopal Church", thereby distinguishing its form of church government from the Presbyterian polity that prevails in the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a>.

The word "Episcopal" is preferred in the title of the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopal Church</a> (the province of the Anglican Communion covering the United States) and the <a href="Scottish%20Episcopal%20Church">Scottish Episcopal Church</a>, though the full name of the former is "The Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States of America". Elsewhere, however, the term "Anglican Church" came to be preferred as it distinguished these churches from others that maintain an <a href="episcopal%20polity">episcopal polity</a>.

Anglicanism, in its structures, theology and forms of worship, is commonly understood as a distinct Christian tradition representing a middle ground between what are perceived to be the extremes of the claims of 16th-century Roman Catholicism and the <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> and <a href="Calvinism">Reformed</a> varieties of <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a> of that era. As such, it is often referred to as being a "via media" (or "middle way") between these traditions.

The faith of Anglicans is founded in the <a href="Scriptures">Scriptures</a> and the <a href="Gospels">Gospels</a>, the traditions of the <a href="Apostle%20%28Christian%29">Apostolic</a> Church, the <a href="historical%20episcopate">historical episcopate</a>, the <a href="ecumenical%20council">first four ecumenical councils</a>, and the early <a href="Church%20Fathers">Church Fathers</a> (among these councils, especially the premier four ones, and among these Fathers, especially those active during the five initial centuries of Christianity, according to the "quinquasaecularist" principle proposed by the English bishop <a href="Lancelot%20Andrewes">Lancelot Andrewes</a> and the Lutheran dissident <a href="Georg%20Calixtus">Georg Calixtus</a>). Anglicans understand the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old</a> and <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>s as "containing all things necessary for salvation" and as being the rule and ultimate standard of faith. Reason and tradition are seen as valuable means to interpret scripture (a position first formulated in detail by <a href="Richard%20Hooker">Richard Hooker</a>), but there is no full mutual agreement among Anglicans "exactly how" scripture, reason, and tradition interact (or ought to interact) with each other. Anglicans understand the <a href="Apostles%27%20Creed">Apostles' Creed</a> as the baptismal symbol and the <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Nicene Creed</a> as the sufficient <a href="creed">statement of the Christian faith</a>.

Anglicans believe the catholic and apostolic faith is revealed in <a href="Holy%20Scripture">Holy Scripture</a> and the Catholic creeds and interpret these in light of the Christian tradition of the historic church, scholarship, reason and experience.

Anglicans celebrate the traditional sacraments, with special emphasis being given to the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>, also called Holy Communion, the Lord's Supper or the <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a>. The Eucharist is central to worship for most Anglicans as a communal offering of prayer and praise in which the life, death and resurrection of <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a> are proclaimed through prayer, reading of the Bible, singing, giving God thanks over the bread and wine for the innumerable benefits obtained through the passion of Christ, the breaking of the bread, and reception of the bread and wine as representing the body and blood of Christ as instituted at the <a href="Last%20Supper">Last Supper</a>. While many Anglicans celebrate the Eucharist in similar ways to the predominant western Catholic tradition, a considerable degree of liturgical freedom is permitted, and worship styles range from the simple to elaborate.

Unique to Anglicanism is the "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>" (BCP), the collection of services that worshippers in most Anglican churches used for centuries. It was called "common prayer" originally because it was intended for use in all Church of England churches which had previously followed differing local liturgies. The term was kept when the church became international because all Anglicans used to share in its use around the world.

In 1549, the first "Book of Common Prayer" was compiled by <a href="Thomas%20Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>, who was then <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. While it has since undergone many revisions and Anglican churches in different countries have developed other service books, the Prayer Book is still acknowledged as one of the ties that bind Anglicans together.

The founding of Christianity in Britain is commonly attributed to <a href="Joseph%20of%20Arimathea">Joseph of Arimathea</a>, according to Anglican legend, and is commemorated in <a href="Glastonbury%20Abbey">Glastonbury Abbey</a>. Many of the early <a href="Church%20fathers">Church fathers</a> wrote of the presence of Christianity in <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman Britain</a>, with <a href="Tertullian">Tertullian</a> stating "those parts of Britain into which the Roman arms had never penetrated were become subject to Christ". <a href="Saint%20Alban">Saint Alban</a>, who was executed in AD 209, is the first <a href="Christian%20martyr">Christian martyr</a> in the British Isles. The historian <a href="Heinrich%20Zimmer%20%28Celticist%29">Heinrich Zimmer</a> writes that "Just as Britain was a part of the Roman Empire, so the British Church formed (during the fourth century) a branch of the Catholic Church of the West; and during the whole of that century, from the <a href="Synod%20of%20Arles">Council of Arles</a> (316) onward, took part in all proceedings concerning the Church."

After <a href="End%20of%20Roman%20rule%20in%20Britain">Roman troops withdrew from Britain</a>, however, the "absence of Roman military and governmental influence and overall decline of Roman imperial political power enabled Britain and the surrounding isles to develop distinctively from the rest of the West. A new culture emerged around the Irish Sea among the Celtic peoples with Celtic Christianity at its core. What resulted was a form of Christianity distinct from Rome in many traditions and practices." The historian <a href="Charles%20Thomas%20%28historian%29">Charles Thomas</a>, in addition to the <a href="Celticist">Celticist</a> Heinrich Zimmer, writes that the distinction between sub-Roman and post-Roman Insular Christianity, also known as Celtic Christianity, began to become apparent around AD 475, with the <a href="Celtic%20Christianity">Celtic churches</a> allowing married clergy, observing <a href="Lent">Lent</a> and Easter according to their own calendar, and having a different <a href="tonsure">tonsure</a>; moreover, the Celtic churches operated independently of the Pope's authority, namely a result of their isolated development in the British Isles.
In what is known as the <a href="Gregorian%20mission">Gregorian mission</a>, the Roman Catholic <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Pope Gregory I</a>, sent <a href="Augustine%20of%20Canterbury">Augustine of Canterbury</a> to the British Isles in AD 596, with the purpose of <a href="evangelism">evangelising</a> the pagans there (who were largely <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20paganism">Anglo-Saxons</a>), as well as to reconcile the Celtic churches in the British Isles to the <a href="See%20of%20Rome">See of Rome</a>. In <a href="Kent%2C%20England">Kent</a>, Augustine persuaded the Anglo-Saxon king "<a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Kent">Æthelberht</a> and his people to accept Christianity." Augustine, on two occasions, "met in conference with members of the Celtic episcopacy, but no understanding was reached between them." Eventually, the "Christian Church of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria convened the <a href="Synod%20of%20Whitby">Synod of Whitby</a> in 663/664 to decide whether to follow Celtic or Roman usages." This meeting, with <a href="Oswiu%20of%20Northumbria">King Oswiu</a> as the final decision maker, "led to the acceptance of Roman usage elsewhere in England and brought the English Church into close contact with the Continent." As a result of assuming Roman usages, the Celtic Church surrendered its independence and from this point on, the Church in England "was no longer purely Celtic, but became Anglo-Roman-Celtic". The theologian Christopher L. Webber writes that although "the Roman form of Christianity became the dominant influence in Britain as in all of western Europe, Anglican Christianity has continued to have a distinctive quality because of its Celtic heritage."

The Church in England remained united with Rome until the English Parliament, through the <a href="Act%20of%20Supremacy">Act of Supremacy</a> (1534), declared <a href="King%20Henry%20VIII">King Henry VIII</a> to be the <a href="Supreme%20Head%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20England">Supreme Head of the Church of England</a> to fulfill the "English desire to be independent from continental Europe religiously and politically." Although now separate from Rome, the English Church, at this point in history, continued to maintain the Roman Catholic theology on many things, such as the <a href="Anglican%20sacraments">sacraments</a>. Under <a href="King%20Edward%20VI">King Edward VI</a>, however, the Church in England underwent what is known as the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a>, in the course of which it acquired a number of characteristics that would subsequently become recognised as constituting a distinct, Anglican, identity.

By the <a href="Elizabethan%20Settlement">Elizabethan Settlement</a>, the Protestant identity of the English and Irish churches was affirmed through parliamentary legislation which assumed allegiance and loyalty to the British Crown in all their members. However, from the first, the Elizabethan church began to develop distinct religious traditions; assimilating some of the theology of <a href="Reformed%20churches">Reformed churches</a> with the services in the "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>" (which drew extensively on the <a href="Sarum%20Rite">Sarum Rite</a> native to England), under the leadership and organisation of a continuing episcopate; and over the years these traditions themselves came to command adherence and loyalty. The Elizabethan Settlement stopped the radical Protestant tendencies under Edward VI by combining the more radical elements of the Second Prayer Book of 1552 with the conservative 'Catholic' First Prayer Book of 1549. From then on Protestantism was in a "state of arrested development" regardless of the attempts to detach the Church of England from its "idiosyncratic anchorage in the medieval past" by various groups which tried to push it towards a more Reformed theology and governance in the years 1560–1660. It has resolutely refused to identify decisively as Catholic or Protestant and sees it as a "virtue" rather than a "handicap," indeed it prefers to see itself as both.
Although two important constitutive elements of what later would emerge as Anglicanism, were present in 1559 – the <a href="historic%20episcopate">historic episcopate</a> and the "Book of Common Prayer" – neither the laypeople nor the clergy perceived themselves as Anglicans at the beginning of Elizabeth I's reign. Historical studies on the period 1560–1660 written before the late 1960s tended to project the predominant conformist spirituality and doctrine of the 1660s on the ecclesiastical situation one hundred years before, and there was also a tendency to take polemically binary partitions of reality claimed by contestants studied (such as the dichotomies Protestant-'Popish' or 'Laudian'-'Puritan') at face value. Since the late 1960s these interpretations have been criticised. Studies on the subject written during the last forty-five years have, however, not reached any consensus on how to interpret this period in English church history. The extent to which one or several positions concerning doctrine and spirituality existed alongside the more well-known and articulate Puritan movement and the Durham House Party, and the exact extent of continental Calvinism among the English elite and among the ordinary churchgoers from the 1560s to the 1620s are subjects of current and ongoing debate.

In 1662, under <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">King Charles II</a>, a revised "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>" was produced, which was acceptable to high churchmen as well as some Puritans, and is still considered authoritative to this day.

In so far as Anglicans derived their identity from both parliamentary legislation and ecclesiastical tradition, a crisis of identity could result wherever secular and religious loyalties came into conflict – and such a crisis indeed occurred in 1776 with the <a href="American%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">American Declaration of Independence</a>, most of whose signatories were, at least nominally, Anglican. For these American patriots, even the forms of Anglican services were in doubt, since the Prayer Book rites of <a href="Matins">Matins</a>, <a href="Evening%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Evensong</a> and Holy Communion, all included specific prayers for the British Royal Family. Consequently, the conclusion of the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">War of Independence</a> eventually resulted in the creation of two new Anglican churches, the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopal Church in the United States</a> in those states that had achieved independence; and in the 1830s <a href="Anglican%20Church%20of%20Canada">The Church of England in Canada</a> became independent from the Church of England in those North American colonies which had remained under British control and to which many Loyalist churchmen had migrated.

Reluctantly, legislation was passed in the British Parliament (the <a href="Consecration%20of%20Bishops%20Abroad%20Act%201786">Consecration of Bishops Abroad Act 1786</a>) to allow bishops to be consecrated for an American church outside of allegiance to the British Crown (whereas no bishoprics had ever been established in the former American colonies). Both in the United States and in Canada, the new Anglican churches developed novel models of self-government, collective decision-making, and self-supported financing; that would be consistent with separation of religious and secular identities.

In the following century, two further factors acted to accelerate the development of a distinct Anglican identity. From 1828 and 1829, <a href="Dissenters">Dissenters</a> and Catholics could be elected to the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a>, which consequently ceased to be a body drawn purely from the established churches of Scotland, England and Ireland; but which nevertheless, over the following ten years, engaged in extensive reforming legislation affecting the interests of the English and Irish churches; which by the <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201800">Acts of Union of 1800</a>, had been reconstituted as the <a href="United%20Church%20of%20England%20and%20Ireland">United Church of England and Ireland</a>. The propriety of this legislation was bitterly contested by the <a href="Oxford%20Movement">Oxford Movement</a> (Tractarians), who in response developed a vision of Anglicanism as religious tradition deriving ultimately from the <a href="ecumenical%20councils">ecumenical councils</a> of the patristic church. Those within the Church of England opposed to the Tractarians, and to their revived ritual practices, introduced a stream of bills in parliament aimed to control innovations in worship. This only made the dilemma more acute, with consequent continual litigation in the secular and ecclesiastical courts.

Over the same period, Anglican churches engaged vigorously in <a href="Mission%20%28Christian%29">Christian missions</a>, resulting in the creation, by the end of the century, of over ninety colonial bishoprics; which gradually coalesced into new self-governing churches on the Canadian and American models. However, the case of <a href="John%20Colenso">John Colenso</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Natal">Bishop of Natal</a>, reinstated in 1865 by the English <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Judicial Committee of the Privy Council</a> over the heads of the Church in South Africa, demonstrated acutely that the extension of episcopacy had to be accompanied by a recognised Anglican ecclesiology of ecclesiastical authority, distinct from secular power.

Consequently, at the instigation of the bishops of Canada and South Africa, the first <a href="Lambeth%20Conference">Lambeth Conference</a> was called in 1867; to be followed by further conferences in 1878 and 1888, and thereafter at ten-year intervals. The various papers and declarations of successive Lambeth Conferences, have served to frame the continued Anglican debate on identity, especially as relating to the possibility of ecumenical discussion with other churches. This ecumenical aspiration became much more of a possibility, as other denominational groups rapidly followed the example of the Anglican Communion in founding their own transnational alliances: the <a href="World%20Alliance%20of%20Reformed%20Churches">Alliance of Reformed Churches</a>, the <a href="World%20Methodist%20Council">Ecumenical Methodist Council</a>, the <a href="World%20Alliance%20of%20Reformed%20Churches">International Congregational Council</a>, and the <a href="Baptist%20World%20Alliance">Baptist World Alliance</a>.

In their rejection of absolute parliamentary authority, the <a href="Oxford%20Movement">Tractarians</a> – and in particular <a href="John%20Henry%20Newman">John Henry Newman</a> – looked back to the writings of 17th-century Anglican divines, finding in these texts the idea of the English church as a "via media" between the Protestant and Catholic traditions. This view was associated – especially in the writings of <a href="Edward%20Bouverie%20Pusey">Edward Bouverie Pusey</a> – with the theory of Anglicanism as one of three "<a href="Branch%20Theory">branches</a>" (alongside the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church) historically arising out of the common tradition of the earliest <a href="ecumenical%20councils">ecumenical councils</a>. Newman himself subsequently rejected the theory of the "via media", as essentially historicist and static; and hence unable to accommodate any dynamic development within the church. Nevertheless, the aspiration to ground Anglican identity in the writings of the 17th-century divines, and in faithfulness to the traditions of the <a href="Church%20Fathers">Church Fathers</a> reflects a continuing theme of Anglican ecclesiology, most recently in the writings of <a href="Henry%20Robert%20McAdoo">Henry Robert McAdoo</a>.

The Tractarian formulation of the theory of the "via media" was essentially a party platform, and not acceptable to Anglicans outside the confines of the <a href="Oxford%20Movement">Oxford Movement</a>. However, the theory of the "via media" was reworked in the ecclesiological writings of <a href="Frederick%20Denison%20Maurice">Frederick Denison Maurice</a>, in a more dynamic form that became widely influential. Both Maurice and Newman saw the Church of England of their day as sorely deficient in faith; but whereas Newman had looked back to a distant past when the light of faith might have appeared to burn brighter, Maurice looked forward to the possibility of a brighter revelation of faith in the future. Maurice saw the Protestant and Catholic strands within the Church of England as contrary but complementary, both maintaining elements of the true church, but incomplete without the other; such that a true catholic and evangelical church might come into being by a union of opposites.
Central to Maurice's perspective was his belief that the collective elements of family, nation, and church represented a divine order of structures through which God unfolds his continuing work of creation. Hence, for Maurice, the Protestant tradition had maintained the elements of national distinction which were amongst the marks of the true universal church, but which had been lost within contemporary Roman Catholicism in the internationalism of centralised papal authority. Within the coming universal church that Maurice foresaw, national churches would each maintain the six signs of Catholicity: baptism, Eucharist, the creeds, Scripture, an episcopal ministry, and a fixed liturgy (which could take a variety of forms in accordance with divinely ordained distinctions in national characteristics). Not surprisingly, this vision of a becoming universal church as a congregation of autonomous national churches, proved highly congenial in Anglican circles; and Maurice's six signs were adapted to form the <a href="Chicago-Lambeth%20Quadrilateral">Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral</a> of 1888.

In the latter decades of the 20th century, Maurice's theory, and the various strands of Anglican thought that derived from it, have been criticised by <a href="Stephen%20Sykes">Stephen Sykes</a>; who argues that the terms "Protestant" and "Catholic" as used in these approaches are synthetic constructs denoting ecclesiastic identities unacceptable to those to whom the labels are applied. Hence, the Catholic Church does not regard itself as a party or strand within the universal church – but rather identifies itself as the universal church. Moreover, Sykes criticises the proposition, implicit in theories of "via media", that there is no distinctive body of Anglican doctrines, other than those of the universal church; accusing this of being an excuse not to undertake systematic doctrine at all.

Contrariwise, Sykes notes a high degree of commonality in Anglican liturgical forms, and in the doctrinal understandings expressed within those liturgies. He proposes that Anglican identity might rather be found within a shared consistent pattern of prescriptive liturgies, established and maintained through canon law, and embodying both a historic deposit of formal statements of doctrine, and also framing the regular reading and proclamation of scripture. Sykes nevertheless agrees with those heirs of Maurice who emphasise the incompleteness of Anglicanism as a positive feature, and quotes with qualified approval the words of <a href="Michael%20Ramsey">Michael Ramsey</a>:

In the time of <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> the nature of Anglicanism was based on questions of jurisdiction – specifically, the belief of the Crown that <a href="national%20church">national church</a>es should be autonomous – rather than theological disagreement. The effort was to create a national church in legal continuity with its traditions, but inclusive of certain doctrinal and liturgical beliefs of the <a href="Protestant%20Reformers">Reformers</a>. The result has been a movement with a distinctive self-image among Christian movements. The question often arises as to whether the Anglican Communion should be identified as a Protestant or <a href="Catholicism">Catholic</a> church, or perhaps as a distinct branch of Christianity altogether.

The distinction between Reformed and Catholic, and the coherence of the two, is routinely a matter of debate both within specific Anglican churches and throughout the Anglican Communion by members themselves. Since the <a href="Oxford%20Movement">Oxford Movement</a> of the mid-19th century, many churches of the communion have revived and extended liturgical and pastoral practices similar to Roman Catholicism. This extends beyond the ceremony of <a href="high%20church">high-church</a> services to even more theologically significant territory, such as sacramental theology (see <a href="Anglican%20sacraments">Anglican sacraments</a>). While <a href="Anglo-Catholic">Anglo-Catholic</a> practices, particularly liturgical ones, have resurfaced and become more common within the tradition over the last century, there remain many places where practices and beliefs remain on the more Reformed or evangelical side (see <a href="Sydney%20Anglicanism">Sydney Anglicanism</a>).

For high-church Anglicans, doctrine is neither established by a <a href="magisterium">magisterium</a>, nor derived from the theology of an <a href="%3Awikt%3Aeponym">eponymous</a> founder (such as <a href="Calvinism">Calvinism</a>), nor summed up in a confession of faith beyond the ecumenical <a href="creed">creed</a>s (such as the <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> <a href="Book%20of%20Concord">Book of Concord</a>). For them, the earliest Anglican theological documents are its prayer books, which they see as the products of profound theological reflection, compromise and synthesis. They emphasise the "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>" as a key expression of Anglican doctrine. The principle of looking to the prayer books as a guide to the parameters of belief and practice is called by the Latin name "<a href="lex%20orandi%2C%20lex%20credendi">lex orandi, lex credendi</a>" ("the law of prayer is the law of belief").

Within the prayer books are the fundamentals of Anglican doctrine: the <a href="Apostles%27%20Creed">Apostles'</a> and <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Nicene</a> creeds, the <a href="Athanasian%20Creed">Athanasian Creed</a> (now rarely used), the scriptures (via the lectionary), the sacraments, daily prayer, the <a href="catechism">catechism</a> and apostolic succession in the context of the historic threefold ministry. For some low-church and evangelical Anglicans, the 16th-century <a href="Reformed">Reformed</a> Thirty-Nine Articles form the basis of doctrine.

The <a href="Thirty-Nine%20Articles">Thirty-Nine Articles</a> played a significant role in Anglican doctrine and practice. Following the passing of the 1604 canons, all Anglican clergy had to formally subscribe to the articles. Today, however, the articles are no longer binding, but are seen as a historical document which has played a significant role in the shaping of Anglican identity. The degree to which each of the articles has remained influential varies.

On the doctrine of <a href="Justification%20%28theology%29">justification</a>, for example, there is a wide range of beliefs within the Anglican Communion, with some <a href="Anglo-Catholicism">Anglo-Catholics</a> arguing for a faith with good works and the sacraments. At the same time, however, some <a href="evangelical">evangelical</a> Anglicans ascribe to the Reformed emphasis on "<a href="sola%20fide">sola fide</a>" ("faith alone") in their doctrine of justification (see <a href="Sydney%20Anglicanism">Sydney Anglicanism</a>). Still other Anglicans adopt a nuanced view of justification, taking elements from the early <a href="Church%20Fathers">Church Fathers</a>, <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a>, <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>, <a href="liberal%20Christianity">liberal theology</a>, and <a href="latitudinarian">latitudinarian</a> thought.

Arguably, the most influential of the original articles has been Article VI on the "sufficiency of scripture" which says that "Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation." This article has informed Anglican biblical <a href="exegesis">exegesis</a> and <a href="hermeneutics">hermeneutics</a> since earliest times.

Anglicans look for authority in their "standard divines" (see below). Historically, the most influential of these – apart from Cranmer – has been the 16th century cleric and theologian <a href="Richard%20Hooker%20%28theologian%29">Richard Hooker</a> who after 1660 was increasingly portrayed as the founding father of Anglicanism. Hooker's description of Anglican authority as being derived primarily from scripture, informed by reason (the intellect and the experience of God) and tradition (the practices and beliefs of the historical church), has influenced Anglican self-identity and doctrinal reflection perhaps more powerfully than any other formula. The analogy of the "three-legged stool" of <a href="Bible">scripture</a>, <a href="reason">reason</a>, and <a href="Sacred%20Tradition">tradition</a> is often incorrectly attributed to Hooker. Rather Hooker's description is a hierarchy of authority, with scripture as foundational and reason and tradition as vitally important, but secondary, authorities.

Finally, the extension of Anglicanism into non-English cultures, the growing diversity of prayer books and the increasing interest in ecumenical dialogue, has led to further reflection on the parameters of Anglican identity. Many Anglicans look to the <a href="Chicago-Lambeth%20Quadrilateral">Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral</a> of 1888 as the "sine qua non" of communal identity. In brief, the quadrilateral's four points are the scriptures, as containing all things necessary to salvation; the creeds (specifically, the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds) as the sufficient statement of Christian faith; the dominical sacraments of <a href="Baptism">Baptism</a> and <a href="Holy%20Communion">Holy Communion</a>; and the historic <a href="Episcopalian%20church%20governance%23Anglican%20Communion">episcopate</a>.

Within the Anglican tradition, "divines" are clergy of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> whose theological writings have been considered standards for faith, doctrine, worship and spirituality and whose influence has permeated the Anglican Communion in varying degrees through the years. While there is no authoritative list of these Anglican divines, there are some whose names would likely be found on most lists – those who are commemorated in <a href="Calendar%20of%20saints%20%28Anglican%29">lesser feasts</a> of the Anglican churches and those whose works are frequently <a href="anthology">anthologised</a>.

The corpus produced by Anglican divines is diverse. What they have in common is a commitment to the faith as conveyed by scripture and the "Book of Common Prayer", thus regarding prayer and theology in a manner akin to that of the <a href="Apostolic%20Fathers">Apostolic Fathers</a>. On the whole, Anglican divines view the "<a href="via%20media">via media</a>" of Anglicanism not as a compromise, but as "a positive position, witnessing to the universality of God and God's kingdom working through the fallible, earthly "ecclesia Anglicana"."

These theologians regard scripture as interpreted through tradition and reason as authoritative in matters concerning salvation. Reason and tradition, indeed, is extant in and presupposed by scripture, thus implying co-operation between God and humanity, God and nature, and between the sacred and secular. Faith is thus regarded as <a href="incarnation">incarnation</a>al and authority as dispersed.
Amongst the early Anglican divines of the 16th and 17th centuries, the names of <a href="Thomas%20Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>, <a href="John%20Jewel">John Jewel</a>, <a href="Matthew%20Parker">Matthew Parker</a>, <a href="Richard%20Hooker">Richard Hooker</a>, <a href="Lancelot%20Andrewes">Lancelot Andrewes</a>, and <a href="Jeremy%20Taylor">Jeremy Taylor</a> predominate. The influential character of Hooker's "<a href="Of%20the%20Laws%20of%20Ecclesiastical%20Polity">Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity</a>" cannot be overestimated. Published in 1593 and subsequently, Hooker's eight-volume work is primarily a treatise on church-state relations, but it deals comprehensively with issues of <a href="biblical%20interpretation">biblical interpretation</a>, <a href="soteriology">soteriology</a>, ethics and <a href="sanctification">sanctification</a>. Throughout the work, Hooker makes clear that theology involves prayer and is concerned with ultimate issues and that theology is relevant to the social mission of the church.

The 18th century saw the rise of two important movements in Anglicanism: <a href="Cambridge%20Platonists">Cambridge Platonism</a>, with its mystical understanding of reason as the "candle of the Lord" and the <a href="evangelicalism">evangelical</a> <a href="revivalism">revival</a> with its emphasis on the personal experience of the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>. The Cambridge Platonist movement evolved into a school called <a href="Latitudinarianism">Latitudinarianism</a>, which emphasised reason as the barometer of discernment and took a stance of indifference towards doctrinal and ecclesiological differences.

The evangelical revival, influenced by such figures as <a href="John%20Wesley">John Wesley</a> and <a href="Charles%20Simeon">Charles Simeon</a>, re-emphasised the importance of <a href="Sola%20fide">justification through faith</a> and the consequent importance of personal conversion. Some in this movement, such as Wesley and <a href="George%20Whitefield">George Whitefield</a>, took the message to the United States, influencing the <a href="First%20Great%20Awakening">First Great Awakening</a> and creating an Anglo-American movement called <a href="Methodism">Methodism</a> that would eventually break away, structurally, from the Anglican churches after the American Revolution.

By the 19th century, there was a renewed interest in pre-Reformation English religious thought and practice. Theologians such as <a href="John%20Keble">John Keble</a>, <a href="Edward%20Bouverie%20Pusey">Edward Bouverie Pusey</a> and <a href="John%20Henry%20Newman">John Henry Newman</a> had widespread influence in the realm of polemics, homiletics and theological and devotional works, not least because they largely repudiated the old high church tradition and replaced it with a dynamic appeal to antiquity which looked beyond the Reformers and Anglican formularies. Their work is largely credited with the development of the <a href="Oxford%20Movement">Oxford Movement</a>, which sought to reassert Catholic identity and practice in Anglicanism.

In contrast to this movement, clergy such as the Bishop of Liverpool, <a href="J.%20C.%20Ryle">J. C. Ryle</a>, sought to uphold the distinctly Reformed identity of the Church of England. He was not a servant of the status quo, but argued for a lively religion which emphasised grace, holy and charitable living and the plain use of the 1662 "Book of Common Prayer" (interpreted in a partisan evangelical way) without additional rituals. <a href="Frederick%20Denison%20Maurice">Frederick Denison Maurice</a>, through such works as "<a href="The%20Kingdom%20of%20Christ">The Kingdom of Christ</a>", played a pivotal role in inaugurating another movement, <a href="Christian%20socialism">Christian socialism</a>. In this, Maurice transformed Hooker's emphasis on the <a href="incarnation">incarnation</a>al nature of Anglican spirituality to an imperative for social justice.

In the 19th century, Anglican biblical scholarship began to assume a distinct character, represented by the so-called "Cambridge triumvirate" of <a href="Joseph%20Lightfoot">Joseph Lightfoot</a>, <a href="Fenton%20John%20Anthony%20Hort">F. J. A. Hort</a> and <a href="Brooke%20Foss%20Westcott">Brooke Foss Westcott</a>. Their orientation is best summed up by Lightfoot's observation that "Life which Christ is and which Christ communicates, the life which fills our whole beings as we realise its capacities, is active fellowship with God."

The earlier part of the 20th century is marked by <a href="Charles%20Gore">Charles Gore</a>, with his emphasis on <a href="natural%20revelation">natural revelation</a>, and <a href="William%20Temple%20%28bishop%29">William Temple</a>'s focus on Christianity and society, while from outside England, <a href="Robert%20Leighton%20%28bishop%29">Robert Leighton</a>, Archbishop of Glasgow, and several clergy from the United States have been suggested, such as <a href="William%20Porcher%20DuBose">William Porcher DuBose</a>, <a href="John%20Henry%20Hobart">John Henry Hobart</a> (1775–1830, Bishop of New York 1816–30), <a href="William%20Meade">William Meade</a>, <a href="Phillips%20Brooks">Phillips Brooks</a>, and <a href="Charles%20Brent">Charles Brent</a>.

"<a href="Churchmanship">Churchmanship</a>" can be defined as the manifestation of theology in the realms of liturgy, piety and, to some extent, spirituality. Anglican diversity in this respect has tended to reflect the diversity in the tradition's Reformed and Catholic identity. Different individuals, groups, parishes, dioceses and provinces may identify more closely with one or the other, or some mixture of the two.

The range of Anglican belief and practice became particularly divisive during the 19th century when some clergy were disciplined and even imprisoned on charges of <a href="ritual%20heresy">ritual heresy</a> while, at the same time, others were criticised for engaging in public worship services with ministers of Reformed churches. Resistance to the growing acceptance and restoration of traditional Catholic ceremonial by the mainstream of Anglicanism ultimately led to the formation of small breakaway churches such as the <a href="Free%20Church%20of%20England">Free Church of England</a> in England (1844) and the <a href="Reformed%20Episcopal%20Church">Reformed Episcopal Church</a> in North America (1873).

<a href="Anglo-Catholic">Anglo-Catholic</a> (and some broad-church) Anglicans celebrate public liturgy in ways that understand worship to be something very special and of utmost importance. <a href="Vestments">Vestments</a> are worn by the clergy, sung settings are often used and <a href="incense">incense</a> may be used. Nowadays, in most Anglican churches, the Eucharist is celebrated in a manner similar to the usage of Catholics and some Lutherans though, in many churches, more traditional, "pre–Vatican II", models of worship are common, (e.g. an "eastward orientation" at the altar). Whilst many Anglo-Catholics derive much of their liturgical practice from that of the pre-Reformation English church, others more closely follow traditional Roman Catholic practices.

The Eucharist may sometimes be celebrated in the form known as <a href="Solemn%20Mass">High Mass</a>, with a priest, deacon and <a href="subdeacon">subdeacon</a> dressed in traditional vestments, with incense and <a href="Altar%20bell">sanctus bells</a> and with prayers adapted from the <a href="Roman%20Missal">Roman Missal</a> or other sources by the celebrant. Such churches may also have forms of <a href="Eucharistic%20adoration">Eucharistic adoration</a> such as Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament. In terms of personal piety some Anglicans may recite the <a href="Anglican%20Rosary">rosary</a> and <a href="angelus">angelus</a>, be involved in a devotional society dedicated to "Our Lady" (the <a href="Blessed%20Virgin%20Mary">Blessed Virgin Mary</a>) and seek the intercession of the saints.

In recent years the prayer books of several provinces have, out of deference to a greater agreement with Eastern <a href="Conciliarism">Conciliarism</a> (and a perceived greater respect accorded Anglicanism by Eastern Orthodoxy than by Roman Catholicism), instituted a number of historically Eastern and <a href="Oriental%20Orthodox">Oriental Orthodox</a> elements in their liturgies, including introduction of the <a href="Trisagion">Trisagion</a> and deletion of the <a href="filioque">filioque</a> clause from the <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Nicene Creed</a>.

For their part, those <a href="evangelicalism">evangelical</a> (and some broad-church) Anglicans who emphasise the more Protestant aspects of the Church stress the Reformation theme of <a href="Salvation%23Christian%20views%20of%20salvation">salvation</a> by grace through faith. They emphasise the two dominical sacraments of Baptism and Eucharist, viewing the other five as "lesser rites". Some evangelical Anglicans may even tend to take the inerrancy of scripture literally, adopting the view of Article VI that it contains all things necessary to salvation in an explicit sense. Worship in churches influenced by these principles tends to be significantly less elaborate, with greater emphasis on the <a href="Liturgy%20of%20the%20Word">Liturgy of the Word</a> (the reading of the scriptures, the sermon and the intercessory prayers).

The Order for Holy Communion may be celebrated bi-weekly or monthly (in preference to the <a href="daily%20office">daily office</a>s), by priests attired in <a href="choir%20habit">choir habit</a>, or more regular clothes, rather than Eucharistic vestments. Ceremony may be in keeping with their view of the provisions of the 17th-century Puritans – being a <a href="Reformed">Reformed</a> interpretation of the <a href="Ornaments%20Rubric">Ornaments Rubric</a> – no candles, no incense, no bells and a minimum of manual actions by the presiding celebrant (such as touching the elements at the <a href="Words%20of%20Institution">Words of Institution</a>).

In recent decades there has been a growth of <a href="Charismatic%20Movement">charismatic</a> worship among Anglicans. Both Anglo-Catholics and evangelicals have been affected by this movement such that it is not uncommon to find typically charismatic postures, music, and other themes evident during the services of otherwise Anglo-Catholic or evangelical parishes.

The spectrum of Anglican beliefs and practice is too large to be fit into these labels. Many Anglicans locate themselves somewhere in the spectrum of the broad-church tradition and consider themselves an amalgam of evangelical and Catholic. Such Anglicans stress that Anglicanism is the ""<a href="via%20media">via media</a>"" (middle way) between the two major strains of Western Christianity and that Anglicanism is like a "bridge" between the two strains.

In accord with its prevailing self-identity as a "<a href="via%20media">via media</a>" or "middle path" of <a href="Western%20Christianity">Western Christianity</a>, Anglican sacramental theology expresses elements in keeping with its status as being both a church in the <a href="Catholicism">Catholic</a> tradition as well as a <a href="English%20Reformation">Reformed</a> church. With respect to sacramental theology the Catholic heritage is perhaps most strongly asserted in the importance Anglicanism places on the <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a>s as a means of <a href="Divine%20grace">grace</a>, <a href="sanctification">sanctification</a> and <a href="salvation">salvation</a> as expressed in the church's <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> and doctrine.

Of the seven sacraments, all Anglicans recognise <a href="Baptism">Baptism</a> and the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a> as being directly instituted by Christ. The other five – <a href="Confession%20%28sacrament%29">Confession and absolution</a>, <a href="Christian%20view%20of%20marriage">Matrimony</a>, <a href="Confirmation%20%28sacrament%29">Confirmation</a>, <a href="Holy%20Orders">Holy Orders</a> (also called Ordination) and <a href="Anointing%20of%20the%20Sick">Anointing of the Sick</a> (also called Unction) – are regarded variously as full sacraments by <a href="Anglo-Catholic">Anglo-Catholic</a>s, many <a href="high%20church">high-church</a> and some <a href="broad%20church">broad-church</a> Anglicans, but merely as "sacramental rites" by other broad-church and <a href="low%20church">low-church</a> Anglicans, especially <a href="evangelicalism">evangelical</a>s associated with <a href="Reform%20%28Anglican%29">Reform UK</a> and the <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Sydney">Diocese of Sydney</a>.

Anglican eucharistic theology is divergent in practice, reflecting the essential comprehensiveness of the tradition. Some <a href="Low%20Church">Low Church</a> Anglicans take a strictly memorialist (<a href="Zwingli">Zwingli</a>an) view of the sacrament. In other words, they see Holy Communion as a memorial to Christ's suffering, and participation in the Eucharist as both a re-enactment of the Last Supper and a foreshadowing of the heavenly banquet – the fulfilment of the eucharistic promise.

Other low-church Anglicans believe in the <a href="real%20presence%20of%20Christ%20in%20the%20Eucharist">real presence of Christ in the Eucharist</a> but deny that the presence of Christ is carnal or is necessarily localised in the bread and wine. Despite explicit criticism in the <a href="Thirty-Nine%20Articles">Thirty-Nine Articles</a>, many high-church or Anglo-Catholic Anglicans hold, more or less, the Catholic view of the real presence as expressed in the doctrine of <a href="transubstantiation">transubstantiation</a>, seeing the Eucharist as a liturgical representation of Christ's atoning sacrifice with the elements actually transformed into Christ's body and blood.

The majority of Anglicans, however, have in common a belief in the real presence, defined in one way or another. To that extent, they are in the company of the continental reformer <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> rather than <a href="Ulrich%20Zwingli">Ulrich Zwingli</a>.

A famous Anglican aphorism regarding Christ's presence in the sacrament, commonly misattributed to <a href="Elizabeth%20I">Queen Elizabeth I</a>, is first found in print in a poem by <a href="John%20Donne">John Donne</a>:

<poem>
He was the word that spake it,
He took the bread and brake it:
And what that word did make it,
I do believe and take it.</poem>

An Anglican position on the eucharistic sacrifice ("Sacrifice of the Mass") was expressed in the response "<a href="Saepius%20officio">Saepius officio</a>" of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York to <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a>'s Papal Encyclical "<a href="Apostolicae%20curae">Apostolicae curae</a>".

Anglican and Catholic representatives declared that they had "substantial agreement on the doctrine of the Eucharist" in the 'Windsor Statement on Eucharistic Doctrine" from the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Consultation (1971) and the Elucidation of the ARCIC Windsor Statement (1979). The final response (1991) to these documents by the Vatican made it plain that it did not consider the degree of agreement reached to be satisfactory.

In Anglicanism there is a distinction between liturgy, which is the formal public and communal worship of the Church, and personal prayer and devotion which may be public or private. Liturgy is regulated by the prayer books and consists of the Holy Eucharist (some call it Holy Communion or Mass), the other six Sacraments, and the Divine Office or Liturgy of the Hours.

The "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>" (BCP) is the foundational prayer book of Anglicanism. The original book of 1549 (revised 1552) was one of the instruments of the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a>, replacing the various "uses" or rites in Latin that had been used in different parts of the country with a single compact volume in the language of the people, so that "now from henceforth all the Realm shall have but one use". Suppressed under Queen <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Mary I</a>, it was revised in 1559, and then again in 1662, after the <a href="English%20Restoration">Restoration</a> of <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a>. This version was made mandatory in England and Wales by the <a href="Act%20of%20Uniformity%201662">Act of Uniformity</a> and was in standard use until the mid-20th century.

With <a href="British%20Empire">British colonial</a> expansion from the 17th century onwards, Anglican churches were planted around the globe. These churches at first used and then revised the "Book of Common Prayer" until they, like their parent church, produced prayer books which took into account the developments in liturgical study and practice in the 19th and 20th centuries, which come under the general heading of the <a href="Liturgical%20Movement">Liturgical Movement</a>.

Anglican worship services are open to all visitors. Anglican worship originates principally in the reforms of <a href="Thomas%20Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a>, who aimed to create a set order of service like that of the pre-Reformation church but less complex in its seasonal variety and said in English rather than <a href="Latin">Latin</a>. This use of a set order of service is not unlike the Catholic tradition. Traditionally the pattern was that laid out in the "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>". Although many Anglican churches now use a wide range of modern service books written in the local language, the structures of the "Book of Common Prayer" are largely retained. Churches which call themselves Anglican will have identified themselves so because they use some form or variant of the "Book of Common Prayer" in the shaping of their worship.

Anglican worship, however, is as diverse as Anglican theology. A contemporary "<a href="low%20church">low church</a>" service may differ little from the worship of many mainstream non-Anglican Protestant churches. The service is constructed around a sermon focused on Biblical exposition and opened with one or more Bible readings and closed by a series of prayers (both set and extemporised) and hymns or songs. A "<a href="high%20church">high-church</a>" or Anglo-Catholic service, by contrast, is usually a more formal <a href="liturgy">liturgy</a> celebrated by clergy in distinctive <a href="vestments">vestments</a> and may be almost indistinguishable from a Roman Catholic service, often resembling the "pre–Vatican II" <a href="Tridentine%20Mass">Tridentine rite</a>.

Between these extremes are a variety of styles of worship, often involving a robed choir and the use of the organ to accompany the singing and to provide music before and after the service. Anglican churches tend to have <a href="pew">pew</a>s or chairs and it is usual for the congregation to kneel for some prayers but to stand for hymns and other parts of the service such as the Gloria, Collect, Gospel reading, Creed and either the Preface or all of the Eucharistic Prayer. High Anglicans may genuflect or cross themselves in the same way as Roman Catholics.

Other more traditional Anglicans tend to follow the 1662 "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>", and retain the use of the King James Bible. This is typical in many Anglican cathedrals and particularly in <a href="Royal%20Peculiar">Royal Peculiar</a>s such as the <a href="Savoy%20Chapel">Savoy Chapel</a> and the <a href="Queen%27s%20Chapel">Queen's Chapel</a>. These services reflect the original Anglican doctrine and differ from the <a href="Traditional%20Anglican%20Communion">Traditional Anglican Communion</a> in that they are in favour of women vicars and the ability of vicars to marry. These Anglican church services include classical music instead of songs, hymns from the <a href="New%20English%20Hymnal">New English Hymnal</a> (usually excluding modern hymns such as Lord of the Dance), and are generally non-evangelical and formal in practice. Due to their association with royalty, these churches are generally host to staunch Anglicans who are strongly opposed to Catholicism.

Until the mid-20th century the main Sunday service was typically <a href="Morning%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">morning prayer</a>, but the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a> has once again become the standard form of Sunday worship in many Anglican churches; this again is similar to Roman Catholic practice. Other common Sunday services include an early morning Eucharist without music, an abbreviated Eucharist following a service of morning prayer and a service of <a href="Evening%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">evening prayer</a>, sometimes in the form of sung <a href="Evening%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Evensong</a>, usually celebrated between 3 and 6 pm The late-evening service of <a href="Compline">Compline</a> was revived in parish use in the early 20th century. Many Anglican churches will also have daily morning and evening prayer and some have midweek or even daily celebration of the Eucharist.

An Anglican service (whether or not a Eucharist) will include readings from the Bible that are generally taken from a standardised <a href="lectionary">lectionary</a>, which provides for much of the Bible (and some passages from the <a href="Biblical%20apocrypha">Apocrypha</a>) to be read out loud in the church over a cycle of one, two or three years (depending on which eucharistic and office lectionaries are used, respectively). The <a href="sermon">sermon</a> (or <a href="homily">homily</a>) is typically about ten to twenty minutes in length, often comparably short to sermons in evangelical churches. Even in the most informal Anglican services it is common for set prayers such as the weekly <a href="Collect">Collect</a> to be read. There are also set forms for <a href="intercessory%20prayer">intercessory prayer</a>, though this is now more often extemporaneous. In high and Anglo-Catholic churches there are generally prayers for the dead.

Although Anglican public worship is usually ordered according to the canonically approved services, in practice many Anglican churches use forms of service outside these norms. Liberal churches may use freely structured or experimental forms of worship, including patterns borrowed from ecumenical traditions such as those of <a href="Taiz%C3%A9%20Community">Taizé Community</a> or the <a href="Iona%20Community">Iona Community</a>.

<a href="Anglo-Catholic">Anglo-Catholic</a> parishes might use the modern Roman Catholic liturgy of the <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a> or more traditional forms, such as the <a href="Tridentine%20Mass">Tridentine Mass</a> (which is translated into English in the <a href="English%20Missal">English Missal</a>), the <a href="Anglican%20Missal">Anglican Missal</a>, or, less commonly, the <a href="Sarum%20Rite">Sarum Rite</a>. Catholic devotions such as the <a href="Rosary">Rosary</a>, <a href="Angelus">Angelus</a> and <a href="Benediction%20of%20the%20Blessed%20Sacrament">Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament</a> are also common among Anglo-Catholics.

Only <a href="Baptism">baptised</a> persons are eligible to receive communion, although in many churches communion is restricted to those who have not only been baptised but also <a href="Confirmation">confirmed</a>. In many Anglican provinces, however, all baptised Christians are now often invited to receive communion and some dioceses have regularised a system for admitting baptised young people to communion before they are confirmed.

The discipline of fasting before communion is practised by some Anglicans. Most Anglican priests require the presence of at least one other person for the celebration of the Eucharist (referring back to Christ's statement in Matthew 18:20, "When two or more are gathered in my name, I will be in the midst of them."), though some Anglo-Catholic priests (like Roman Catholic priests) may say private Masses. As in the Roman Catholic Church, it is a canonical requirement to use fermented wine for communion.

Unlike in Roman Catholicism, the consecrated bread and wine are always offered to the congregation at a eucharistic service ("communion in both kinds"). This practice is becoming more frequent in the Roman Catholic Church as well, especially through the <a href="Neocatechumenal%20Way">Neocatechumenal Way</a>. In some churches the sacrament is reserved in a tabernacle or <a href="aumbry">aumbry</a> with a lighted candle or lamp nearby. In Anglican churches, only a priest or a bishop may be the celebrant at the Eucharist.

All Anglican prayer books contain offices for <a href="Morning%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Morning Prayer</a> (Matins) and <a href="Evening%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Evening Prayer</a> (Evensong). In the original "Book of Common Prayer" these were derived from combinations of the ancient monastic offices of <a href="Matins">Matins</a> and <a href="Lauds">Lauds</a>; and <a href="Vespers">Vespers</a> and <a href="Compline">Compline</a> respectively. The prayer offices have an important place in Anglican history.

Prior to the <a href="Oxford%20Movement">Catholic revival</a> of the 19th century, which eventually restored the <a href="Holy%20Eucharist">Holy Eucharist</a> as the principal Sunday liturgy, and especially during the 18th century, a morning service combining Matins, the <a href="Litany">Litany</a> and ante-Communion comprised the usual expression of common worship; while Matins and Evensong were sung daily in cathedrals and some collegiate chapels. This nurtured a tradition of distinctive <a href="Anglican%20chant">Anglican chant</a> applied to the <a href="canticle">canticle</a>s and <a href="psalm">psalm</a>s used at the offices (although <a href="plainsong">plainsong</a> is often used as well).

In some official and many unofficial Anglican service books these offices are supplemented by other offices such as the <a href="Little%20Hours">Little Hours</a> of <a href="Prime%20%28liturgy%29">Prime</a> and prayer during the day such as (<a href="Terce">Terce</a>, <a href="Sext">Sext</a>, <a href="None%20%28liturgy%29">None</a> and <a href="Compline">Compline</a>). Some Anglican monastic communities have a <a href="Daily%20Office">Daily Office</a> based on that of the "Book of Common Prayer" but with additional antiphons and canticles, etc. for specific days of the week, specific psalms, etc. See, for example, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Holy%20Cross">Order of the Holy Cross</a> and Order of St Helena, editors, "A Monastic Breviary" (Wilton, Conn.: Morehouse-Barlow, 1976). The All Saints Sisters of the Poor, with convents in Catonsville, Maryland and elsewhere use an elaborated version of the Anglican Daily Office. The <a href="Society%20of%20St.%20Francis">Society of St. Francis</a> publishes "Celebrating Common Prayer" which has become especially popular for use among Anglicans.

In England, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and some other Anglican provinces the modern prayer books contain four offices:

In addition, most prayer books include a section of prayers and devotions for family use. In the US, these offices are further supplemented by an "Order of Worship for the Evening", a prelude to or an abbreviated form of Evensong, partly derived from <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> prayers. In the United Kingdom, the publication of "Daily Prayer", the third volume of "<a href="Common%20Worship">Common Worship</a>" was published in 2005. It retains the services for Morning and Evening Prayer and Compline and includes a section entitled "Prayer during the Day". 'A New Zealand Prayer Book' of 1989 provides different outlines for Matins and Evensong on each day of the week, as well as "Midday Prayer", "Night Prayer" and "Family Prayer".

Some Anglicans who pray the office on daily basis use the present <a href="Liturgy%20of%20the%20Hours">Divine Office</a> of the Catholic Church. In many cities, especially in England, Anglican and Catholic priests and lay people often meet several times a week to pray the office in common. A small but enthusiastic minority use the <a href="Anglican%20Breviary">Anglican Breviary</a>, or other translations and adaptations of the pre–Vatican II Roman Rite and <a href="Sarum%20Rite">Sarum Rite</a>, along with supplemental material from cognate western sources, to provide such things as a common of Octaves, a common of Holy Women and other additional material. Others may privately use idiosyncratic forms borrowed from a wide range of Christian traditions.

In the late medieval period, many English cathedrals and monasteries had established small choirs of trained <a href="lay%20clerk">lay clerk</a>s and boy <a href="choir">choristers</a> to perform <a href="polyphony">polyphonic</a> settings of the <a href="Mass%20%28music%29">Mass</a> in their <a href="Lady%20chapel">Lady chapel</a>s. Although these "Lady Masses" were discontinued at the Reformation, the associated musical tradition was maintained in the <a href="Elizabethan%20Settlement">Elizabethan Settlement</a> through the establishment of choral foundations for daily singing of the Divine Office by expanded choirs of men and boys. This resulted from an explicit addition by Elizabeth herself to the injunctions accompanying the 1559 "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>" (that had itself made no mention of choral worship) by which existing choral foundations and choir schools were instructed to be continued, and their endowments secured. Consequently, some thirty-four cathedrals, collegiate churches and royal chapels maintained paid establishments of lay singing men and choristers in the late 16th century.

All save four of these have – with an interruption during the <a href="English%20Interregnum">Commonwealth</a> – continued daily choral prayer and praise to this day. In the Offices of <a href="Matins">Matins</a> and <a href="Evening%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Evensong</a> in the 1662 "Book of Common Prayer", these choral establishments are specified as "Quires and Places where they sing".

For nearly three centuries, this round of daily professional choral worship represented a tradition entirely distinct from that embodied in the intoning of <a href="Parish%20Clerk">Parish Clerk</a>s, and the singing of "<a href="West%20gallery%20music">west gallery choirs</a>" which commonly accompanied weekly worship in English parish churches. In 1841, the rebuilt <a href="Leeds%20Parish%20Church">Leeds Parish Church</a> established a surpliced <a href="choir">choir</a> to accompany parish services, drawing explicitly on the musical traditions of the ancient choral foundations. Over the next century, the Leeds example proved immensely popular and influential for choirs in cathedrals, parish churches and schools throughout the Anglican communion. More or less extensively adapted, this choral tradition also became the direct inspiration for robed choirs leading congregational worship in a wide range of Christian denominations.

In 1719 the cathedral choirs of <a href="Gloucester%20Cathedral">Gloucester</a>, <a href="Hereford%20Cathedral">Hereford</a> and <a href="Worcester%20Cathedral">Worcester</a> combined to establish the annual <a href="Three%20Choirs%20Festival">Three Choirs Festival</a>, the precursor for the multitude of summer music festivals since. By the 20th century, the choral tradition had become for many the most accessible face of worldwide Anglicanism – especially as promoted through the regular broadcasting of choral evensong by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>; and also in the annual televising of the festival of <a href="Nine%20lessons%20and%20carols">Nine lessons and carols</a> from <a href="King%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">King's College, Cambridge</a>. Composers closely concerned with this tradition include <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Edward Elgar</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>, <a href="Gustav%20Holst">Gustav Holst</a>, <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Charles Villiers Stanford</a> and <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>. A number of important 20th-century works by non-Anglican composers were originally commissioned for the Anglican choral tradition – for example the "<a href="Chichester%20Psalms">Chichester Psalms</a>" of <a href="Leonard%20Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a>, and the "<a href="Nunc%20dimittis">Nunc dimittis</a>" of <a href="Arvo%20P%C3%A4rt">Arvo Pärt</a>.

Contrary to popular misconception, the British monarch is not the constitutional "head" but in law the "<a href="Supreme%20Governor">Supreme Governor</a>" of the Church of England, nor does he or she have any role in provinces outside England. The role of the crown in the Church of England is practically limited to the appointment of bishops, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, and even this role is limited, as the Church presents the government with a short list of candidates to choose from. This process is accomplished through collaboration with and consent of ecclesial representatives "(see <a href="Ecclesiastical%20Commissioners">Ecclesiastical Commissioners</a>)". The monarch has no constitutional role in Anglican churches in other parts of the world, although the prayer books of several countries where she is head of state maintain prayers for her as sovereign.

A characteristic of Anglicanism is that it has no international juridical authority. All thirty-nine provinces of the Anglican Communion are autonomous, each with their own <a href="primate%20%28bishop%29">primate</a> and governing structure. These provinces may take the form of national churches (such as in Canada, Uganda, or Japan) or a collection of nations (such as the West Indies, Central Africa, or South Asia), or geographical regions (such as Vanuatu and Solomon Islands) etc. Within these Communion provinces may exist subdivisions, called <a href="ecclesiastical%20province">ecclesiastical province</a>s, under the jurisdiction of a metropolitan archbishop.

All provinces of the Anglican Communion consist of <a href="diocese">diocese</a>s, each under the jurisdiction of a bishop. In the Anglican tradition, bishops must be consecrated according to the strictures of <a href="apostolic%20succession">apostolic succession</a>, which Anglicans consider one of the marks of <a href="Catholicism">Catholicity</a>. Apart from bishops, there are two other orders of ordained ministry: <a href="deacon">deacon</a> and priest.

No requirement is made for <a href="clerical%20celibacy">clerical celibacy</a>, though many Anglo-Catholic priests have traditionally been bachelors. Because of innovations that occurred at various points after the latter half of the 20th century, women may be ordained as deacons in almost all provinces, as priests in some, and as bishops in a few provinces. <a href="Anglican%20religious%20order">Anglican religious order</a>s and communities, suppressed in England during the Reformation, have re-emerged, especially since the mid-19th century, and now have an international presence and influence.

Government in the Anglican Communion is <a href="synod">synod</a>ical, consisting of three houses of <a href="laity">laity</a> (usually elected parish representatives), clergy, and bishops. National, provincial, and diocesan synods maintain different scopes of authority, depending on their <a href="canon%20law">canons and constitutions</a>. Anglicanism is not <a href="Congregationalist%20polity">congregational</a> in its polity: it is the diocese, not the parish church, which is the smallest unit of authority in the church. "(See <a href="Episcopal%20polity">Episcopal polity</a>)".

The <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> has a precedence of honour over the other primates of the Anglican Communion, and for a province to be considered a part of the Communion means specifically to be in full communion with the <a href="episcopal%20see">See</a> of <a href="Province%20of%20Canterbury">Canterbury</a>. The Archbishop is, therefore, recognised as "<a href="primus%20inter%20pares">primus inter pares</a>", or first amongst equals even though he does not exercise any direct authority in any <a href="province%20%28Anglican%29">province</a> outside England, of which he is chief primate. <a href="Rowan%20Williams">Rowan Williams</a>, the Archbishop of Canterbury from 2002 to 2012, was the first archbishop appointed from outside the Church of England since the Reformation: he was formerly the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Wales">Archbishop of Wales</a>.

As "spiritual head" of the Communion, the Archbishop of Canterbury maintains a certain <a href="moral%20authority">moral authority</a>, and has the right to determine which churches will be in communion with his <a href="Episcopal%20See">See</a>. He hosts and chairs the <a href="Lambeth%20Conference">Lambeth Conference</a>s of Anglican Communion bishops, and decides who will be invited to them. He also hosts and chairs the <a href="Anglican%20Communion%20Primates%27%20Meeting">Anglican Communion Primates' Meeting</a> and is responsible for the invitations to it. He acts as president of the secretariat of the Anglican Communion Office, and its deliberative body, the <a href="Anglican%20Consultative%20Council">Anglican Consultative Council</a>.

The Anglican Communion has no international juridical organisation. All international bodies are consultative and collaborative, and their resolutions are not legally binding on the autonomous provinces of the Communion. There are three international bodies of note.


Like the Roman Catholic Church and the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> churches, the Anglican Communion maintains the threefold ministry of <a href="deacon">deacon</a>s, <a href="presbyter">presbyter</a>s (usually called "<a href="priest">priest</a>s") and <a href="bishop">bishop</a>s.

Bishops, who possess the fullness of Christian priesthood, are the successors of the <a href="Twelve%20Apostles">Apostles</a>. <a href="Primate%20%28bishop%29">Primates</a>, archbishops and <a href="metropolitan%20bishop">metropolitans</a> are all bishops and members of the <a href="historical%20episcopate">historical episcopate</a> who derive their authority through <a href="apostolic%20succession">apostolic succession</a> – an unbroken line of bishops that can be traced back to the 12 apostles of Jesus.

Bishops are assisted by <a href="Episcopal%20priest">priests</a> and <a href="deacon">deacon</a>s. Most ordained ministers in the Anglican Communion are priests, who usually work in parishes within a <a href="diocese">diocese</a>. Priests are in charge of the spiritual life of parishes and are usually called the <a href="Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29">rector</a> or <a href="vicar">vicar</a>. A <a href="curate">curate</a> (or, more correctly, an 'assistant curate') is a term often used for a priest or deacon who assists the parish priest. Non-parochial priests may earn their living by any vocation, although employment by educational institutions or charitable organisations is most common. Priests also serve as chaplains of hospitals, schools, prisons, and in the armed forces.

An <a href="archdeacon">archdeacon</a> is a priest or deacon responsible for administration of an <a href="archdeaconry">archdeaconry</a>, which is often the name given to the principal subdivisions of a <a href="diocese">diocese</a>. An archdeacon represents the diocesan bishop in his or her archdeaconry. In the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> the position of archdeacon can only be held by someone in priestly orders who has been ordained for at least six years. In some other parts of the Anglican Communion the position can also be held by deacons. In parts of the Anglican Communion where women cannot be ordained as priests or bishops but can be ordained as deacons, the position of archdeacon is effectively the most senior office an ordained woman can be appointed to.

A <a href="Dean%20%28Christianity%29">dean</a> is a priest who is the principal cleric of a cathedral or other collegiate church and the head of the chapter of canons. If the cathedral or collegiate church has its own parish, the dean is usually also rector of the parish. However, in the Church of Ireland the roles are often separated and most cathedrals in the Church of England do not have associated parishes. In the Church in Wales, however, most cathedrals are parish churches and their deans are now also vicars of their parishes.

The Anglican Communion recognises <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> ordinations as valid. Outside the Anglican Communion, Anglican ordinations (at least of male priests) are recognised by the <a href="Old%20Catholic%20Church">Old Catholic Church</a> Provoo Communion Lutherans and various <a href="Independent%20Catholic">Independent Catholic</a> churches.

In Anglican churches, deacons often work directly in ministry to the marginalised inside and outside the church: the poor, the sick, the hungry, the imprisoned. Unlike Orthodox and most Roman Catholic deacons who may be married only before ordination, deacons are permitted to marry freely both before and after ordination, as are priests. Most deacons are preparing for priesthood and usually only remain as deacons for about a year before being ordained priests. However, there are some deacons who remain so.

Many provinces of the <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a> ordain both men and women as deacons. Many of those provinces that ordain women to the priesthood previously allowed them to be ordained only to the diaconate. The effect of this was the creation of a large and overwhelmingly female diaconate for a time, as most men proceeded to be ordained priest after a short time as a deacon.

Deacons, in some dioceses, can be granted licences to <a href="wedding">solemnise matrimony</a>, usually under the instruction of their parish priest and bishop. They sometimes officiate at <a href="Benediction%20of%20the%20Blessed%20Sacrament">Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament</a> in churches which have this service. Deacons are not permitted to preside at the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a> (but can lead worship with the distribution of already consecrated communion where this is permitted), <a href="absolution%20%28religious%29">absolve sins</a>, or <a href="blessing">pronounce a blessing</a>. It is the prohibition against deacons pronouncing blessings that leads some to believe that deacons cannot solemnise matrimony.

All baptised members of the church are called Christian <a href="Faithful%20%28baptized%20Catholic%29">faithful</a>, truly equal in dignity and in the work to build the church. Some non-ordained people also have a formal public ministry, often on a full-time and long-term basis – such as <a href="lay%20reader">lay reader</a>s (also known as readers), <a href="churchwarden">churchwarden</a>s, <a href="verger">verger</a>s and <a href="sexton%20%28office%29">sextons</a>. Other lay positions include acolytes (male or female, often children), lay <a href="eucharistic%20minister">eucharistic minister</a>s (also known as chalice bearers) and lay eucharistic visitors (who deliver consecrated bread and wine to "shut-ins" or members of the parish who are unable to leave home or hospital to attend the Eucharist). Lay people also serve on the parish altar guild (preparing the altar and caring for its candles, linens, flowers etc.), in the choir and as cantors, as ushers and greeters and on the church council (called the "vestry" in some countries) which is the governing body of a parish.

A small yet influential aspect of Anglicanism is its <a href="Anglican%20religious%20order">religious orders</a> and communities. Shortly after the beginning of the <a href="Catholic%20Revival">Catholic Revival</a> in the Church of England, there was a renewal of interest in re-establishing religious and monastic orders and communities. One of Henry VIII's earliest acts was their <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20Monasteries">dissolution</a> and seizure of their assets. In 1841 <a href="Marian%20Rebecca%20Hughes">Marian Rebecca Hughes</a> became the first woman to take the vows of religion in communion with the <a href="Province%20of%20Canterbury">Province of Canterbury</a> since the Reformation. In 1848, <a href="Priscilla%20Lydia%20Sellon">Priscilla Lydia Sellon</a> became the superior of the <a href="Society%20of%20the%20Most%20Holy%20Trinity">Society of the Most Holy Trinity</a> at Devonport, Plymouth, the first organised religious order. Sellon is called "the restorer, after three centuries, of the religious life in the Church of England." For the next one hundred years, religious orders for both men and women proliferated throughout the world, becoming a numerically small but disproportionately influential feature of global Anglicanism.

Anglican religious life at one time boasted hundreds of orders and communities, and thousands of <a href="religious%20order">religious</a>. An important aspect of Anglican religious life is that most communities of both men and women lived their lives consecrated to God under the <a href="vow">vow</a>s of <a href="poverty%2C%20chastity%20and%20obedience">poverty, chastity and obedience</a> (or in <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> communities, Stability, Conversion of Life, and Obedience) by practising a mixed life of reciting the full eight services of the <a href="Breviary">Breviary</a> in choir, along with a daily <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>, plus service to the poor. The mixed life, combining aspects of the contemplative orders and the active orders remains to this day a hallmark of Anglican religious life. Another distinctive feature of Anglican religious life is the existence of some mixed-gender communities.

Since the 1960s there has been a sharp decline in the number of professed religious in most parts of the Anglican Communion, especially in North America, Europe, and Australia. Many once large and international communities have been reduced to a single <a href="convent">convent</a> or <a href="monastery">monastery</a> with memberships of elderly men or women. In the last few decades of the 20th century, novices have for most communities been few and far between. Some orders and communities have already become extinct. There are however, still thousands of Anglican religious working today in approximately 200 communities around the world, and religious life in many parts of the Communion – especially in developing nations – flourishes.

The most significant growth has been in the <a href="Melanesia">Melanesia</a>n countries of the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, <a href="Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a> and <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>. The <a href="Melanesian%20Brotherhood">Melanesian Brotherhood</a>, founded at <a href="Tabalia">Tabalia</a>, <a href="Guadalcanal%20%28Pacific%20Ocean%20island%29">Guadalcanal</a>, in 1925 by Ini Kopuria, is now the largest Anglican Community in the world with over 450 <a href="monk">brothers</a> in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> and the United Kingdom. The <a href="Sisters%20of%20the%20Church">Sisters of the Church</a>, started by Mother <a href="Emily%20Ayckbowm">Emily Ayckbowm</a> in England in 1870, has more <a href="nun">sisters</a> in the Solomons than all their other communities. The <a href="Community%20of%20the%20Sisters%20of%20Melanesia">Community of the Sisters of Melanesia</a>, started in 1980 by <a href="Sister%20Nesta%20Tiboe">Sister Nesta Tiboe</a>, is a growing community of women throughout the Solomon Islands.

The <a href="Society%20of%20Saint%20Francis">Society of Saint Francis</a>, founded as a union of various <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> orders in the 1920s, has experienced great growth in the Solomon Islands. Other communities of religious have been started by Anglicans in Papua New Guinea and in Vanuatu. Most Melanesian Anglican religious are in their early to mid-20s – vows may be temporary and it is generally assumed that brothers, at least, will leave and marry in due course – making the average age 40 to 50 years younger than their brothers and sisters in other countries. Growth of religious orders, especially for women, is marked in certain parts of Africa.

Anglicanism represents the third largest Christian communion in the world, after the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> and the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>es. The number of Anglicans in the world is over 85 million . The 11 provinces in Africa saw growth in the last two decades. They now include 36.7 million members, more Anglicans than there are in England. England remains the largest single Anglican province, with 26 million members. In most industrialised countries, church attendance has decreased since the 19th century. Anglicanism's presence in the rest of the world is due to large-scale emigration, the establishment of expatriate communities or the work of missionaries.

The <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> has been a church of <a href="missionary">missionaries</a> since the 17th century when the Church first left English shores with colonists who founded what would become the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa and established Anglican churches. For example, an Anglican chaplain, <a href="Robert%20Wolfall">Robert Wolfall</a>, with <a href="Martin%20Frobisher">Martin Frobisher</a>'s <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> expedition celebrated the Eucharist in 1578 in <a href="Frobisher%20Bay">Frobisher Bay</a>.

The first Anglican church in the Americas was built at <a href="Jamestown%2C%20Virginia">Jamestown, Virginia</a>, in 1607. By the 18th century, missionaries worked to establish Anglican churches in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The great Church of England missionary societies were founded; for example the <a href="Society%20for%20Promoting%20Christian%20Knowledge">Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge</a> (SPCK) in 1698. <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Propagation%20of%20the%20Gospel%20in%20Foreign%20Parts">Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts</a> (SPG) in 1701, and the <a href="Church%20Mission%20Society">Church Mission Society</a> (CMS) in 1799.

The 19th century saw the founding and expansion of social oriented evangelism with societies such as the <a href="Church%20Pastoral%20Aid%20Society">Church Pastoral Aid Society</a> (CPAS) in 1836, <a href="Mission%20to%20Seafarers">Mission to Seafarers</a> in 1856, <a href="Girls%27%20Friendly%20Society">Girls' Friendly Society</a> (GFS) in 1875, <a href="Mothers%27%20Union">Mothers' Union</a> in 1876 and <a href="Church%20Army">Church Army</a> in 1882 all carrying out a personal form of evangelism.

The 20th century saw the Church of England developing new forms of evangelism such as the <a href="Alpha%20course">Alpha course</a> in 1990 which was developed and propagated from <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Brompton%20Church">Holy Trinity Brompton Church</a> in London. In the 21st century, there has been renewed effort to reach children and youth. <a href="Fresh%20expressions">Fresh expressions</a> is a Church of England missionary initiative to youth begun in 2005, and has ministries at a <a href="skate%20park">skate park</a> through the efforts of St George's Church, <a href="Benfleet%20Urban%20District">Benfleet</a>, Essex – <a href="Diocese%20of%20Chelmsford">Diocese of Chelmsford</a> – or youth groups with evocative names, like the C.L.A.W (Christ Little Angels – Whatever!) youth group at <a href="Coventry%20Cathedral">Coventry Cathedral</a>. And for the unchurched who do not actually wish to visit a bricks and mortar church there are Internet ministries such as the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Oxford">Diocese of Oxford</a>'s online Anglican <a href="i-Church">i-Church</a> which appeared on the web in 2005.

Anglican interest in <a href="ecumenism">ecumenical</a> dialogue can be traced back to the time of the Reformation and dialogues with both Orthodox and Lutheran churches in the 16th century. In the 19th century, with the rise of the Oxford Movement, there arose greater concern for reunion of the churches of "Catholic confession". This desire to work towards full <a href="Communion%20%28Christian%29">communion</a> with other denominations led to the development of the <a href="Chicago-Lambeth%20Quadrilateral">Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral</a>, approved by the third <a href="Lambeth%20Conference">Lambeth Conference</a> of 1888. The four points (the sufficiency of scripture, the historic creeds, the two dominical sacraments, and the historic episcopate) were proposed as a basis for discussion, although they have frequently been taken as a non-negotiable bottom-line for any form of reunion.

Anglicanism in general has always sought a balance between the emphases of <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> and <a href="Protestantism">Protestantism</a>, while tolerating a range of expressions of <a href="evangelicalism">evangelicalism</a> and ceremony. Clergy and laity from all Anglican <a href="churchmanship">churchmanship</a> traditions have been active in the formation of the Continuing movement.

While there are <a href="high%20church">high-church</a>, <a href="broad%20church">broad-church</a>, and <a href="low%20church">low-church</a> Continuing Anglicans, many Continuing churches are <a href="Anglo-Catholic">Anglo-Catholic</a> with highly ceremonial liturgical practices. Others belong to a more evangelical or <a href="low%20church">low-church</a> tradition and tend to support the <a href="Thirty-nine%20Articles">Thirty-nine Articles</a> and simpler worship services. <a href="Morning%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Morning Prayer</a>, for instance, is often used instead of the <a href="Holy%20Eucharist">Holy Eucharist</a> for Sunday worship services, although this is not necessarily true of all low church parishes.

Most Continuing churches in the United States reject the 1979 revision of the "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>" by the Episcopal Church and use the 1928 version for their services instead. In addition, Anglo-Catholic bodies may use the <a href="Anglican%20Missal">Anglican Missal</a> or <a href="English%20Missal">English Missal</a> in celebrating the Eucharist.

A changing focus on social issues after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> led to Lambeth Conference resolutions countenancing <a href="contraception">contraception</a> and the <a href="remarriage">remarriage</a> of divorced persons. They led to most provinces approving the <a href="ordination%20of%20women">ordination of women</a>. In more recent years it has led some jurisdictions to permit the ordination of people in same-sex relationships and to authorise rites for the blessing of same-sex unions (see <a href="Homosexuality%20and%20Anglicanism">Homosexuality and Anglicanism</a>). "The more liberal provinces that are open to changing Church doctrine on marriage in order to allow for same-sex unions include Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, Scotland, South India, South Africa, the US and Wales." More conservative elements within and outside of Anglicanism (primarily African churches and factions within North American Anglicanism) have opposed these proposals.

Some liberal and moderate Anglicans see this opposition as representing a new <a href="fundamentalism">fundamentalism</a> within Anglicanism. Others see the advocacy for these proposals as representing a breakdown of Christian theology and commitment. The lack of social consensus among and within provinces of diverse cultural traditions has resulted in considerable conflict and even schism concerning some or all of these developments (see <a href="Anglican%20realignment">Anglican realignment</a>). Some Anglicans opposed to various liberalising changes, in particular the ordination of women, have become Roman Catholics or Orthodox. Others have, at various times, joined the <a href="Continuing%20Anglican%20movement">Continuing Anglican movement</a>.

These latter trends reflect a countervailing tendency in Anglicanism towards insularity, reinforced perhaps by the "big tent" nature of the tradition which seeks to be comprehensive of various views and tendencies. The insularity and complacency of the early established <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> has tended to influence Anglican self-identity and inhibit engagement with the broader society in favour of internal debate and dialogue. Nonetheless, there is significantly greater cohesion among Anglicans when they turn their attention outward.

The term "<a href="Continuing%20Anglicanism">Continuing Anglicanism</a>" refers to a number of church bodies which have formed outside of the <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a> in the belief that traditional forms of Anglican faith, worship and order have been unacceptably revised or abandoned within some Anglican Communion churches in recent decades. They therefore claim that they are "continuing" traditional Anglicanism.

The modern Continuing Anglican movement principally dates to the <a href="Congress%20of%20St.%20Louis">Congress of St. Louis</a>, held in the United States in 1977, where participants rejected changes that had been made in the Episcopal Church's "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>" and also the Episcopal Church's approval of the <a href="ordination%20of%20women">ordination of women</a> to the priesthood. More recent changes in the North American churches of the Anglican Communion, such as the introduction of same-sex marriage rites and the ordination of gay and lesbian people to the <a href="priesthood">priesthood</a> and <a href="Bishop">episcopate</a>, have created further separations.

Continuing churches have generally been formed by people who have left the Anglican Communion. The original Anglican churches are charged by the Continuing Anglicans with being greatly compromised by secular cultural standards and liberal theology. Many Continuing Anglicans believe that the faith of some churches in communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury has become <a href="heterodox">unorthodox</a> and therefore have not sought to also be in communion with him.

The original generation of continuing parishes in the United States were found mainly in metropolitan areas. Since the late 1990s a number have appeared in smaller communities, often as a result of a division in the town's existing Episcopal churches. The 2007–08 "Directory of Traditional Anglican and Episcopal Parishes", published by the Fellowship of Concerned Churchmen, contained information on over 900 parishes affiliated with either the Continuing Anglican churches or the Anglican realignment movement, a more recent wave of Anglicans withdrawing from the Anglican Communion's North American provinces.

Anglican concern with broader issues of social justice can be traced to its earliest divines. Richard Hooker, for instance, wrote that "God hath created nothing simply for itself, but each thing in all things, and of every thing each part in other have such interest, that in the whole world nothing is found whereunto any thing created can say, 'I need thee not.'"

This, and related statements, reflect the deep thread of <a href="Incarnation">incarnational theology</a> running through Anglican social thought – a theology which sees God, nature, and humanity in dynamic interaction, and the interpenetration of the secular and the sacred in the make-up of the cosmos. Such theology is informed by a traditional English spiritual ethos, rooted in Celtic Christianity and reinforced by Anglicanism's origins as an <a href="established%20church">established church</a>, bound up by its structure in the life and interests of civil society.

Repeatedly, throughout Anglican history, this principle has reasserted itself in movements of social justice. For instance, in the 18th century the influential evangelical Anglican <a href="William%20Wilberforce">William Wilberforce</a>, along with others, campaigned against the slave trade. In the 19th century, the dominant issues concerned the adverse effects of industrialisation. The usual Anglican response was to focus on education and give support to 'The National Society for the Education of the Children of the Poor in the principles of the Church of England'.

Lord Shaftesbury, a devout evangelical, campaigned to improve the conditions in factories, in mines, for chimney sweeps, and for the education of the very poor. For years he was chairman of the <a href="Ragged%20school">Ragged School</a> Board. Frederick Denison Maurice was a leading figure advocating reform, founding so-called "producer's co-operatives" and the <a href="Working%20Men%27s%20College">Working Men's College</a>. His work was instrumental in the establishment of the <a href="Christian%20socialism">Christian socialist</a> movement, although he himself was not in any real sense a socialist but, "a Tory paternalist with the unusual desire to theories his acceptance of the traditional obligation to help the poor", influenced Anglo-Catholics such as Charles Gore, who wrote that, "the principle of the incarnation is denied unless the Christian spirit can be allowed to concern itself with everything that interests and touches human life." Anglican focus on labour issues culminated in the work of <a href="William%20Temple%20%28archbishop%29">William Temple</a> in the 1930s and 1940s.

A question of whether or not Christianity is a <a href="pacifist">pacifist</a> religion has remained a matter of debate for Anglicans. In 1937, the <a href="Anglican%20Pacifist%20Fellowship">Anglican Pacifist Fellowship</a> emerged as a distinct reform organisation, seeking to make pacifism a clearly defined part of Anglican theology. The group rapidly gained popularity amongst Anglican intellectuals, including <a href="Vera%20Brittain">Vera Brittain</a>, <a href="Evelyn%20Underhill">Evelyn Underhill</a>, and the former British political leader <a href="George%20Lansbury">George Lansbury</a>. Furthermore, <a href="Dick%20Sheppard%20%28priest%29">Dick Sheppard</a>, who during the 1930s was one of Britain's most famous Anglican priests due to his landmark sermon broadcasts for <a href="BBC%20Radio">BBC Radio</a>, founded the <a href="Peace%20Pledge%20Union">Peace Pledge Union</a> a secular pacifist organisation for the non-religious that gained considerable support throughout the 1930s.

Whilst never actively endorsed by Anglican churches, many Anglicans unofficially have adopted the Augustinian "<a href="Just%20War">Just War</a>" doctrine. The Anglican Pacifist Fellowship remain highly active throughout the Anglican world. It rejects this doctrine of "just war" and seeks to reform the Church by reintroducing the pacifism inherent in the beliefs of many of the earliest Christians and present in their interpretation of Christ's <a href="Sermon%20on%20the%20Mount">Sermon on the Mount</a>. The principles of the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship are often formulated as a statement of belief that "Jesus' teaching is incompatible with the waging of war ... that a Christian church should never support or justify war ... [and] that our Christian witness should include opposing the waging or justifying of war."

Confusing the matter was the fact that the 37th Article of Religion in the "Book of Common Prayer" states that "it is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate, to wear weapons, and serve in the wars." Therefore, the Lambeth Council in the modern era has sought to provide a clearer position by repudiating modern war and developed a statement that has been affirmed at each subsequent meeting of the Council.

This statement was strongly reasserted when "the 67th General Convention of the Episcopal Church reaffirms the statement made by the Anglican Bishops assembled at Lambeth in 1978 and adopted by the 66th General Convention of the Episcopal Church in 1979, calling "Christian people everywhere ... to engage themselves in non-violent action for justice and peace and to support others so engaged, recognising that such action will be controversial and may be personally very costly... this General Convention, in obedience to this call, urges all members of this Church to support by prayer and by such other means as they deem appropriate, those who engaged in such non-violent action, and particularly those who suffer for conscience' sake as a result; and be it further Resolved, that this General Convention calls upon all members of this Church seriously to consider the implications for their own lives of this call to resist war and work for peace for their own lives."

The focus on other social issues became increasingly diffuse after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. On the one hand, the growing independence and strength of Anglican churches in the global south brought new emphasis to issues of global poverty, the inequitable distribution of resources, and the lingering effects of colonialism. In this regard, figures such as <a href="Desmond%20Tutu">Desmond Tutu</a> and <a href="Ted%20Scott">Ted Scott</a> were instrumental in mobilising Anglicans worldwide against the <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> policies of South Africa. Rapid social change in the industrialised world during the 20th century compelled the church to examine issues of gender, sexuality and marriage.

On 4 November 2009, <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> issued an <a href="apostolic%20constitution">apostolic constitution</a>, "<a href="Anglicanorum%20Coetibus">Anglicanorum Coetibus</a>", to allow groups of former Anglicans to enter into <a href="full%20communion">full communion</a> with the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> as members of <a href="personal%20ordinariate">personal ordinariate</a>s. The 20 October 2009 announcement of the imminent constitution mentioned:

For each personal ordinariate the <a href="Ordinary%20%28officer%29">ordinary</a> may be a former Anglican bishop or priest. It is expected that provision will be made to allow the retention of aspects of Anglican liturgy; cf. <a href="Anglican%20Use">Anglican Use</a>.

Athens

Athens (; , "Athína" , , "Athínai") is the <a href="capital%20city">capital</a> and largest <a href="city">city</a> of <a href="Greece">Greece</a>. Athens dominates the <a href="Attica%20%28region%29">Attica</a> region and is one of the <a href="List%20of%20oldest%20continuously%20inhabited%20cities">world's oldest cities</a>, with its <a href="recorded%20history">recorded history</a> spanning over 3,400 years and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennium BC.

<a href="Classical%20Athens">Classical Athens</a> was a powerful <a href="Polis">city-state</a> that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>, which had been a distinct city prior to its <a href="5th%20century%20BC">5th century BC</a> incorporation with Athens. A centre for <a href="the%20arts">the arts</a>, learning and <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>, home of <a href="Plato">Plato</a>'s <a href="Platonic%20Academy">Academy</a> and <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s <a href="Lyceum%23History">Lyceum</a>, it is widely referred to as the <a href="cradle%20of%20civilization">cradle</a> of <a href="Western%20civilization">Western civilization</a> and the <a href="democracy%23History">birthplace of democracy</a>, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular <a href="Ancient%20Rome">the Romans</a>. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan <a href="metropolis">metropolis</a> and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2012, Athens was ranked the world's <a href="List%20of%20cities%20by%20GDP">39th richest city</a> by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a <a href="UBS%20AG">UBS</a> study.

Athens is a <a href="global%20city">global city</a> and one of the biggest economic centres in <a href="southeastern%20Europe">southeastern Europe</a>. It has a large financial sector, and its port <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> is both the largest passenger port in Europe, and the second largest in the world. 
The Municipality of Athens (also City of Athens) had a population of 664,046 (in 2011) within its administrative limits, and a land area of . The urban area of Athens (Greater Athens and Greater Piraeus) extends beyond its administrative municipal <a href="city%20limits">city limits</a>, with a population of 3,090,508 (in 2011) over an area of . According to <a href="Eurostat">Eurostat</a> in 2011, the <a href="larger%20urban%20zone">functional urban area</a> (FUA) of Athens was the 9th most populous FUA in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> (the 6th most populous capital city of the EU), with a population of 3,828,000. Athens is also the southernmost capital on the European mainland.

The heritage of the <a href="Classical%20Greece">classical era</a> is still evident in the city, represented by <a href="ancient%20monument">ancient monument</a>s and works of art, the most famous of all being the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>, considered a key landmark of early <a href="Western%20culture">Western civilization</a>. The city also retains <a href="Roman%20Greece">Roman</a> and <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> monuments, as well as a smaller number of <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> monuments.

Athens is home to two <a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20Sites">UNESCO World Heritage Sites</a>, the <a href="Acropolis%20of%20Athens">Acropolis of Athens</a> and the medieval <a href="Daphni%20Monastery">Daphni Monastery</a>. Landmarks of the modern era, dating back to the establishment of Athens as the capital of the independent Greek state in 1834, include the <a href="Old%20Royal%20Palace">Hellenic Parliament</a> and the so-called "architectural trilogy of Athens", consisting of the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Greece">National Library of Greece</a>, the <a href="National%20and%20Kapodistrian%20University%20of%20Athens">National and Kapodistrian University of Athens</a> and the <a href="Academy%20of%20Athens%20%28modern%29">Academy of Athens</a>. Athens is also home to several museums and cultural institutions, such as the <a href="National%20Archaeological%20Museum%2C%20Athens">National Archeological Museum</a>, featuring the world's largest collection of ancient Greek antiquities, the <a href="Acropolis%20Museum">Acropolis Museum</a>, the <a href="Goulandris%20Museum%20of%20Cycladic%20Art">Museum of Cycladic Art</a>, the <a href="Benaki%20Museum">Benaki Museum</a> and the <a href="Byzantine%20and%20Christian%20Museum">Byzantine and Christian Museum</a>. Athens was the host city of the <a href="1896%20Summer%20Olympics">first modern-day Olympic Games</a> in 1896, and 108 years later it welcomed home the <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics">2004 Summer Olympics</a>.

In <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20language">Ancient Greek</a>, the name of the city was ("Athēnai", in <a href="Attic%20Greek">Classical Attic</a>) a plural. In earlier Greek, such as <a href="Homeric%20Greek">Homeric Greek</a>, the name had been current in the singular form though, as ("Athēnē"). It was possibly rendered in the plural later on, like those of ("<a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thêbai</a>") and ("<a href="Mycenae">Μukênai</a>"). The root of the word is perhaps not of Greek or <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a> origin, and is a possible remnant of the <a href="Pre-Greek%20substrate">Pre-Greek substrate</a> of Attica, as could be the name of the goddess <a href="Athena">Athena</a> (<a href="Attic%20Greek">Attic</a> , "Athēnā", <a href="Ionic%20Greek">Ionic</a> , "Athēnē", and <a href="Doric%20Greek">Doric</a> , "Athānā"), that was always related to the city of Athens. During the medieval period the name of the city was rendered once again in the singular as . However, after the establishment of the modern Greek state, and partly due to the conservatism of the written language, became again the official name of the city and remained so until the abandonment of <a href="Katharevousa">Katharevousa</a> in the 1970s, when Ἀθήνα, "Athína", became the official name.

An <a href="etiological%20myth">etiological myth</a> explaining how Athens has acquired its name was well known among ancient Athenians and even became the theme of the sculpture on the West pediment of the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>. The goddess of wisdom, <a href="Athena">Athena</a>, and the god of the seas, <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> had many disagreements and battles between themselves, and one of these was a race to be the Patron God of the city. In an attempt to compel the people, Poseidon created a salt water <a href="Spring%20%28hydrosphere%29">spring</a> by striking the ground with his trident, symbolizing <a href="naval%20power">naval power</a>. However, when Athena created the <a href="Olive%20oil%23History">olive tree</a>, symbolizing <a href="Olive%20branch">peace</a> and <a href="prosperity">prosperity</a>, the Athenians, under their ruler <a href="Cecrops%20I">Cecrops</a>, accepted the olive tree and named the city after Athena.

Different etymologies, now commonly rejected, were proposed during the 19th century. <a href="Christian%20Lobeck">Christian Lobeck</a> proposed as the root of the name the word ("áthos") or ("ánthos") meaning "flower", to denote Athens as the "flowering city". <a href="Johann%20Christoph%20Wilhelm%20Ludwig%20D%C3%B6derlein">Ludwig von Döderlein</a> proposed the stem of the verb , stem θη- ("tháō", "thē-", "to suck") to denote Athens as having fertile soil.

In classical literature, the city was sometimes referred to as the <a href="City%20of%20the%20Violet%20Crown">City of the Violet Crown</a>, first documented in Pindar's ἰοστέφανοι Ἀθᾶναι ("iostéphanoi Athânai"), or as ("tò kleinòn ásty", "the glorious city"). In medieval texts, variant names include Setines, Satine, and Astines, all derivations involving <a href="false%20splitting">false splitting</a> of prepositional phrases. Today the caption ("ī protévousa"), "the capital", has become somewhat common.

The oldest known human presence in Athens is the Cave of Schist, which has been dated to between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Athens has been continuously inhabited for at least 7000 years.
By 1400 BC the settlement had become an important centre of the <a href="Mycenaean%20Greece">Mycenaean</a> civilization and the Acropolis was the site of a major <a href="Mycenae">Mycenae</a>an fortress, whose remains can be recognised from sections of the characteristic <a href="Cyclopean">Cyclopean</a> walls. Unlike other Mycenaean centers, such as <a href="Mycenae">Mycenae</a> and <a href="Pylos">Pylos</a>, it is not known whether Athens suffered destruction in about 1200 BC, an event often attributed to a <a href="Dorians">Dorian</a> invasion, and the Athenians always maintained that they were "pure" <a href="Ionians">Ionians</a> with no Dorian element. However, Athens, <a href="Bronze%20Age%20collapse">like many other Bronze Age settlements</a>, went into economic decline for around 150 years afterwards.

<a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> burials, in the <a href="Kerameikos">Kerameikos</a> and other locations, are often richly provided for and demonstrate that from 900 BC onwards Athens was one of the leading centres of trade and prosperity in the region. The leading position of Athens may well have resulted from its central location in the Greek world, its secure stronghold on the Acropolis and its access to the sea, which gave it a natural advantage over inland rivals such as <a href="Thebes%20%28Greece%29">Thebes</a> and <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>.

By the 6th century BC, widespread social unrest led to the reforms of <a href="Solon">Solon</a>. These would pave the way for the eventual introduction of democracy by <a href="Cleisthenes">Cleisthenes</a> in 508 BC. Athens had by this time become a significant naval power with a large fleet, and helped the <a href="Ionian%20Revolt">rebellion of the Ionian cities</a> against <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian</a> rule. In the ensuing <a href="Greco-Persian%20Wars">Greco-Persian Wars</a> Athens, together with Sparta, led the coalition of Greek states that would eventually repel the Persians, defeating them decisively at <a href="Battle%20of%20Marathon">Marathon</a> in 490 BC, and crucially at <a href="Battle%20of%20Salamis">Salamis</a> in 480 BC. However, this did not prevent Athens from being captured and sacked twice by the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persians</a> within one year, after a heroic resistance at <a href="Battle%20of%20Thermopylae">Thermopylae</a> by <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>ns and other Greeks led by <a href="Leonidas%20I">King Leonidas</a>, after both <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a> and <a href="Attica">Attica</a> fell to the Persians.

The decades that followed became known as the <a href="Fifth-century%20Athens">Golden Age of Athenian democracy</a>, during which time Athens became the leading city of <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a>, with its cultural achievements laying the foundations for <a href="western%20culture">Western civilization</a>. The playwrights <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>, <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a> and <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a> flourished in Athens during this time, as did the historians <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> and <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>, the physician <a href="Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a>, and the philosopher <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>. Guided by <a href="Pericles">Pericles</a>, who promoted the arts and fostered democracy, Athens embarked on an ambitious building program that saw the construction of the Acropolis of Athens (including the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>), as well as empire-building via the <a href="Delian%20League">Delian League</a>. Originally intended as an association of Greek city-states to continue the fight against the Persians, the league soon turned into a vehicle for Athens's own imperial ambitions. The resulting tensions brought about the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a> (431–404 BC), in which Athens was defeated by its rival <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>.

By the mid-4th century BC, the northern Greek kingdom of <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a> was becoming dominant in Athenian affairs. In 338 BC the armies of <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II</a> defeated an alliance of some of the Greek city-states including Athens and Thebes at the Battle of Chaeronea, effectively ending Athenian independence. Later, under Rome, Athens was given the status of a free city because of its widely admired schools. The Roman emperor <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>, in the 2nd century AD, constructed a library, a gymnasium, an aqueduct which is still in use, several temples and sanctuaries, a bridge and financed the completion of the <a href="Temple%20of%20Olympian%20Zeus%2C%20Athens">Temple of Olympian Zeus</a>.

By the end of <a href="Late%20Antiquity">Late Antiquity</a>, the city experienced decline followed by recovery in the second half of the Middle Byzantine Period, in the 9th to 10th centuries AD, and was relatively prosperous during the <a href="Crusades">Crusades</a>, benefiting from Italian trade. After the <a href="Fourth%20Crusade">Fourth Crusade</a> the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Athens">Duchy of Athens</a> was established. In 1458 it was conquered by the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and entered a long period of decline.

Following the <a href="Greek%20War%20of%20Independence">Greek War of Independence</a> and the establishment of the <a href="Greek%20Kingdom">Greek Kingdom</a>, Athens was chosen as the capital of the newly independent Greek state in 1834, largely because of historical and sentimental reasons. At the time it was a town of modest size built around the foot of the Acropolis. The first <a href="King%20of%20Greece">King of Greece</a>, Otto of Bavaria, commissioned the architects <a href="Stamatios%20Kleanthis">Stamatios Kleanthis</a> and <a href="Eduard%20Schaubert">Eduard Schaubert</a> to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state.

The first modern city plan consisted of a triangle defined by the <a href="Acropolis">Acropolis</a>, the ancient cemetery of <a href="Kerameikos">Kerameikos</a> and the new palace of the Bavarian king (now housing the <a href="Greek%20Parliament">Greek Parliament</a>), so as to highlight the continuity between modern and ancient Athens. Neoclassicism, the international style of this epoch, was the architectural style through which Bavarian, French and Greek architects such as Hansen, Klenze, Boulanger or Kaftantzoglou designed the first important public buildings of the new capital. In 1896, Athens hosted the first modern <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a>. During the 1920s a number of Greek refugees, expelled from <a href="Anatolia">Asia Minor</a> after the <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281919%E2%80%931922%29">Greco-Turkish War</a>, swelled Athens's population; nevertheless it was most particularly following <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and from the 1950s and 1960s, that the population of the city exploded, and Athens experienced a gradual expansion.

In the 1980s it became evident that smog from factories and an ever-increasing fleet of automobiles, as well as a lack of adequate free space due to congestion, had evolved into the city's most important challenge. A series of anti-pollution measures taken by the city's authorities in the 1990s, combined with a substantial improvement of the city's infrastructure (including the <a href="Attiki%20Odos">Attiki Odos</a> motorway, the expansion of the <a href="Athens%20Metro">Athens Metro</a>, and the new <a href="Athens%20International%20Airport">Athens International Airport</a>), considerably alleviated pollution and transformed Athens into a much more functional city. In 2004 Athens hosted the <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics">2004 Summer Olympics</a>.

Athens sprawls across the central plain of <a href="Attica">Attica</a> that is often referred to as the "Athens or Attica Basin" (<a href="Modern%20Greek">Greek</a>: Λεκανοπέδιο Αττικής). The basin is bounded by four large mountains: <a href="Mount%20Aigaleo">Mount Aigaleo</a> to the west, Mount <a href="Parnitha">Parnitha</a> to the north, <a href="Mount%20Pentelicus">Mount Pentelicus</a> to the northeast and Mount <a href="Hymettus">Hymettus</a> to the east. Beyond Mount Aegaleo lies the <a href="Thriasian%20plain">Thriasian plain</a>, which forms an extension of the central plain to the west. The <a href="Saronic%20Gulf">Saronic Gulf</a> lies to the southwest. Mount Parnitha is the tallest of the four mountains (), and has been declared a <a href="national%20park">national park</a>.

Athens is built around a number of hills. <a href="Mount%20Lycabettus">Lycabettus</a> is one of the tallest hills of the city proper and provides a view of the entire Attica Basin. The geomorphology of Athens is deemed to be one of the most complex in the world because its mountains cause a <a href="inversion%20%28meteorology%29">temperature inversion</a> phenomenon which, along with the Greek Government's difficulties controlling industrial pollution, was responsible for the air pollution problems the city has faced. This issue is not unique to Athens; for instance, Los Angeles and <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> also suffer from similar geomorphology inversion problems.

The <a href="Cephissus%20%28Athenian%20plain%29">Cephissus</a> river, the <a href="Ilisos">Ilisos</a> and the <a href="Eridanos%20%28Athens%29">Eridanos</a> stream are the historical rivers of Athens.

Athens has a hot-summer <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen</a> "Csa"). The dominant feature of Athens's climate is alternation between prolonged hot and dry summers and mild to cool winters with moderate rainfall. With an average of of yearly precipitation, rainfall occurs largely between the months of October and April. July and August are the driest months, where thunderstorms occur sparsely once or twice a month.

The annual precipitation of Athens is typically lower than in other parts of Greece, mainly in western Greece. As an example, <a href="Ioannina">Ioannina</a> receives around per year, and <a href="Agrinio">Agrinio</a> around per year. Daily average highs for July (1987–2016) have been measured at , but some parts of the city may be even warmer, in particular its western areas partly because of industrialization and partly because of a number of natural factors, knowledge of which has been available from the mid-19th century.

Athens is affected by the <a href="urban%20heat%20island">urban heat island</a> effect in some areas which is caused by human activity, altering its temperatures compared to the surrounding rural areas, and bearing detrimental effects on energy usage, expenditure for cooling, and health. The urban heat island of the city has also been found to be partially responsible for alterations of the climatological temperature time-series of specific Athens meteorological stations, because of its impact on the temperatures and the temperature trends recorded by some meteorological stations. On the other hand, specific meteorological stations, such as the National Garden station and Thiseio meteorological station, are less affected or do not experience the urban heat island.

Athens holds the <a href="World%20Meteorological%20Organization">World Meteorological Organization</a> record for the highest temperature ever recorded in Europe, at , which was recorded in the <a href="Eleusina">Elefsina</a> and Tatoi suburbs of Athens on 10 July 1977.

Athens became the capital of Greece in 1834, following <a href="Nafplion">Nafplion</a>, which was the provisional capital from 1829. The municipality (City) of Athens is also the capital of the <a href="Attica%20%28region%29">Attica region</a>. The term "Athens" can refer either to the municipality of Athens, to Greater Athens, or to the entire Athens Urban Area.

The municipality (City) of Athens is the <a href="List%20of%20cities%20in%20Greece">most populous in Greece</a>, with a population of 664,046 people (in 2011) and an area of , forming the core of the Athens Urban Area within the "Attica Basin". The current <a href="List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Athens">mayor of Athens</a> is <a href="Giorgos%20Kaminis">Giorgos Kaminis</a>. The municipality is divided into seven municipal districts which are mainly used for administrative purposes.

As of the 2011 census, the population for each of the seven municipal districts of Athens is as follows:


For the Athenians the most popular way of dividing the city proper is through its neighbourhoods such as <a href="Pangrati">Pagkrati</a>, <a href="Ambelokipi%2C%20Athens">Ambelokipi</a>, <a href="Exarcheia">Exarcheia</a>, <a href="Patissia">Patissia</a>, <a href="Ilissia">Ilissia</a>, <a href="Petralona">Petralona</a>, <a href="Koukaki">Koukaki</a> and <a href="Kypseli%2C%20Athens">Kypseli</a>, each with its own distinct history and characteristics.

The Athens municipality forms the core and center of Greater Athens, which consists of the Athens municipality and 34 more municipalities, divided in four <a href="regional%20units%20of%20Greece">regional units</a> (Central, North, South and West Athens), accounting for 2,641,511 people (in 2011) within an area of . Until 2010, these four regional units made up the abolished <a href="Athens%20Prefecture">Athens Prefecture</a>. The municipality of <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>, the historic Athenian port, with its 4 suburban municipalities make up the <a href="Piraeus%20%28regional%20unit%29">regional unit of Piraeus</a>, which in turn forms Greater Piraeus.

Greater Athens and Greater Piraeus combined make up the continuous built up Athens Urban Area (), also called the Urban Area of the Capital () or simply Athens (the most common use of the term), spanning over , with a population of 3,090,508 people as of 2011. The Athens Urban Area is considered to form the city of Athens as a whole, despite its administrative divisions, which is the largest in Greece and one of the most populated urban areas in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>.

The Athens Metropolitan Area, with an area of and inhabited by 3,753,783 people in 2011, consists of the Athens Urban Area with the addition of the towns and villages of <a href="East%20Attica">East</a> and <a href="West%20Attica">West Attica</a>, which surround the dense urban area of the Greek capital. It actually sprawls over the whole peninsula of <a href="Attica">Attica</a>, which is the best part of the <a href="Attica%20%28region%29">region of Attica</a>, excluding the <a href="Islands%20%28regional%20unit%29">islands</a>. 

Athens incorporates <a href="architectural%20style">architectural style</a>s ranging from <a href="Greek%20Revival%20architecture">Greco-Roman</a> and <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">Neoclassical</a> to modern times. They are often to be found in the same areas, as Athens is not marked by a uniformity of architectural style.

For the greatest part of the 19th century Neoclassicism dominated Athens, as well as some deviations from it such as <a href="Eclecticism">Eclecticism</a>, especially in the early 20th century. Thus, the <a href="Old%20Royal%20Palace">Old Royal Palace</a> was the first important public building to be built, between 1836 and 1843. Later in the mid and late 19th century, <a href="Baron%20Theophil%20von%20Hansen">Theophil Freiherr von Hansen</a> and <a href="Ernst%20Ziller">Ernst Ziller</a> took part in the construction of many neoclassical buildings such as the <a href="Academy%20of%20Athens%20%28modern%29">Athens Academy</a> and the <a href="Zappeion">Zappeion</a> Hall. Ziller also designed many private mansions in the centre of Athens which gradually became public, usually through donations, such as <a href="Heinrich%20Schliemann">Schliemann</a>'s <a href="Iliou%20Melathron">Iliou Melathron</a>.

Beginning in the 1920s, <a href="Modern%20architecture">Modern architecture</a> including <a href="Bauhaus">Bauhaus</a> and <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> began to exert an influence on almost all Greek architects, and buildings both public and private were constructed in accordance with these styles. Localities with a great number of such buildings include <a href="Kolonaki">Kolonaki</a>, and some areas of the centre of the city; neighbourhoods developed in this period include <a href="Kypseli%2C%20Athens">Kypseli</a>.

In the 1950s and 1960s during the extension and development of Athens, other modern movements such as the <a href="International%20Style%20%28architecture%29">International style</a> played an important role. The centre of Athens was largely rebuilt, leading to the demolition of a number of neoclassical buildings. The architects of this era employed materials such as glass, marble and aluminium, and many blended modern and classical elements. After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, internationally known architects to have designed and built in the city included <a href="Walter%20Gropius">Walter Gropius</a>, with his design for the US Embassy, and, among others, <a href="Eero%20Saarinen">Eero Saarinen</a>, in his postwar design for the east terminal of the <a href="Ellinikon%20International%20Airport">Ellinikon Airport</a>.

All over the city can be found several statues or busts. Apart from the neoclassicals by <a href="Leonidas%20Drosis">Leonidas Drosis</a> at the Academy of Athens (Plato, Socrates, Apollo, Athena), other notable include the statue of <a href="Theseus">Theseus</a> by <a href="Georgios%20Fytalis">Georgios Fytalis</a> at Thiseion, of philhellenes like <a href="Lord%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>, <a href="George%20Canning">George Canning</a> and <a href="William%20Gladstone">William Gladstone</a>, the equestrian statue of <a href="Theodoros%20Kolokotronis">Theodoros Kolokotronis</a> by <a href="Lazaros%20Sochos">Lazaros Sochos</a> in front of the Old Parliament, statues of <a href="Ioannis%20Kapodistrias">Ioannis Kapodistrias</a>, <a href="Rigas%20Feraios">Rigas Feraios</a> and <a href="Adamantios%20Korais">Adamantios Korais</a> at the University, of <a href="Evangelos%20Zappas">Evangelos Zappas</a> and <a href="Konstantinos%20Zappas">Konstantinos Zappas</a> at Zappeion, of <a href="Ioannis%20Varvakis">Ioannis Varvakis</a> at the National Garden, the "woodbreaker" by <a href="Dimitrios%20Filippotis">Dimitrios Filippotis</a>, the equestrian statue of <a href="Alexandros%20Papagos">Alexandros Papagos</a> at Papagou district and various busts of fighters of Greek independence at the <a href="Pedion%20tou%20Areos">Pedion tou Areos</a>. An important landmark is also the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Syntagma.

The municipality of Athens, the city centre of the Athens Urban Area, is divided into several districts: <a href="Omonoia%20Square">Omonoia</a>, <a href="Syntagma%20Square">Syntagma</a>, <a href="Exarcheia">Exarcheia</a>, Agios Nikolaos, Neapolis, <a href="Mount%20Lycabettus">Lykavittos</a>, Lofos Strefi, Lofos Finopoulou, Lofos Filopappou, <a href="Pedion%20tou%20Areos">Pedion Areos</a>, <a href="Metaxourgeio">Metaxourgeio</a>, Aghios Kostantinos, <a href="Larissa%20Station">Larissa Station</a>, <a href="Kerameikos">Kerameikos</a>, <a href="Psiri">Psiri</a>, <a href="Monastiraki">Monastiraki</a>, <a href="Gazi%2C%20Athens">Gazi</a>, <a href="Thiseio">Thission</a>, <a href="Church%20of%20Panaghia%20Kapnikarea">Kapnikarea</a>, Aghia Irini, Aerides, Anafiotika, <a href="Plaka">Plaka</a>, <a href="Acropolis">Acropolis</a>, <a href="Pnyx">Pnyka</a>, Makrygianni, Lofos Ardittou, <a href="Zappeion">Zappeion</a>, Aghios Spyridon, <a href="Pangrati">Pangrati</a>on, <a href="Kolonaki">Kolonaki</a>, Dexameni, Evaggelismos, Gouva, Aghios Ioannis, <a href="Neos%20Kosmos%2C%20Athens">Neos Kosmos</a>, <a href="Koukaki">Koukaki</a>, Kynosargous, Fix, Ano Petralona, Kato Petralona, Rouf, <a href="Votanikos">Votanikos</a>, Profitis Daniil, <a href="Akadimia%20Platonos">Akadimia Platonos</a>, <a href="Kolonos">Kolonos</a>, Kolokynthou, Attikis Square, Lofos Skouze, Sepolia, <a href="Kypseli%2C%20Athens">Kypseli</a>, Aghios Meletios, Nea Kypseli, Gyzi, Polygono, <a href="Ambelokipi%2C%20Athens">Ampelokipoi</a>, Panormou-Gerokomeio, Pentagono, Ellinorosson, <a href="Nea%20Filothei">Nea Filothei</a>, Ano Kypseli, Tourkovounia-Lofos Patatsou, Lofos Elikonos, Koliatsou, Thymarakia, Kato Patisia, Treis Gefyres, Aghios Eleftherios, <a href="Ano%20Patissia">Ano Patisia</a>, Kypriadou, Menidi, Prompona, Aghios Panteleimonas, <a href="Pangrati">Pangrati</a>, Goudi and Ilisia.


The <a href="Gazi%2C%20Athens">Gazi</a> () area, one of the latest in full redevelopment, is located around a historic gas factory, now converted into the "<a href="Technopolis%20%28Gazi%29">Technopolis</a>" cultural multiplex, and also includes artists' areas, small clubs, bars and restaurants, as well as Athens's "<a href="Gay%20village">Gay village</a>". The metro's expansion to the western suburbs of the city has brought easier access to the area since spring 2007, as the blue line now stops at Gazi (<a href="Kerameikos">Kerameikos</a> station).

The Athens Metropolitan Area consists of 58 densely populated municipalities, sprawling around the municipality of Athens (the city centre) in virtually all directions. For the Athenians, all the urban municipalities surrounding the city centre are called suburbs. According to their geographic location in relation to the City of Athens, the suburbs are divided into four zones; the northern suburbs (including <a href="Agios%20Stefanos%2C%20Attica">Agios Stefanos</a>, <a href="Dionysos%2C%20Greece">Dionysos</a>, <a href="Ekali">Ekali</a>, <a href="Nea%20Erythraia">Nea Erythraia</a>, <a href="Kifissia">Kifissia</a>, <a href="Marousi">Maroussi</a>, <a href="Pefki">Pefki</a>, <a href="Lykovrysi">Lykovrysi</a>, <a href="Metamorfosi">Metamorfosi</a>, <a href="Nea%20Ionia">Nea Ionia</a>, <a href="Nea%20Filadelfeia">Nea Filadelfeia</a>, <a href="Irakleio%2C%20Attica">Irakleio</a>, <a href="Vrilissia">Vrilissia</a>, <a href="Melissia">Melissia</a>, <a href="Penteli%2C%20Greece">Penteli</a>, <a href="Chalandri">Chalandri</a>, <a href="Agia%20Paraskevi">Agia Paraskevi</a>, <a href="Galatsi">Galatsi</a>, <a href="Psychiko">Psychiko</a> and <a href="Filothei">Filothei</a>); the southern suburbs (including <a href="Alimos">Alimos</a>, <a href="Nea%20Smyrni">Nea Smyrni</a>, <a href="Moschato">Moschato</a>, <a href="Kallithea">Kallithea</a>, <a href="Agios%20Dimitrios">Agios Dimitrios</a>, <a href="Palaio%20Faliro">Palaio Faliro</a>, <a href="Ellinikon">Elliniko</a>, <a href="Glyfada">Glyfada</a>, <a href="Argyroupoli">Argyroupoli</a>, <a href="Ilioupoli">Ilioupoli</a>, <a href="Voula">Voula</a> and <a href="Vouliagmeni">Vouliagmeni</a>); the eastern suburbs (including <a href="Zografou">Zografou</a>, <a href="Dafni%2C%20Attica">Dafni</a>, <a href="Vyronas">Vyronas</a>, <a href="Kaisariani">Kaisariani</a>, <a href="Cholargos">Cholargos</a> and <a href="Papagou">Papagou</a>); and the western suburbs (including <a href="Peristeri">Peristeri</a>, <a href="Ilion%2C%20Greece">Ilion</a>, <a href="Egaleo">Egaleo</a>, <a href="Koridallos">Koridallos</a>, <a href="Agia%20Varvara">Agia Varvara</a>, <a href="Chaidari">Chaidari</a>, <a href="Petroupoli">Petroupoli</a>, <a href="Agioi%20Anargyroi">Agioi Anargyroi</a> and <a href="Kamatero">Kamatero</a>).

The Athens city coastline, extending from the major commercial port of <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> to the southernmost suburb of <a href="Varkiza">Varkiza</a> for some , is also connected to the city centre by a tram.

In the northern suburb of Maroussi, the upgraded main <a href="Athens%20Olympic%20Sports%20Complex">Olympic Complex</a> (known by its Greek acronym OAKA) dominates the skyline. The area has been redeveloped according to a design by the Spanish architect <a href="Santiago%20Calatrava">Santiago Calatrava</a>, with steel arches, landscaped gardens, fountains, futuristic glass, and a landmark new blue glass roof which was added to the main stadium. A second Olympic complex, next to the sea at the beach of Palaio Faliro, also features modern stadia, shops and an elevated esplanade. Work is underway to transform the grounds of the old Athens Airport – named <a href="Ellinikon%20International%20Airport">Elliniko</a> – in the southern suburbs, into one of the largest landscaped parks in Europe, to be named the <a href="Hellenikon%20Metropolitan%20Park">Hellenikon Metropolitan Park</a>.

Many of the southern suburbs (such as <a href="Alimos">Alimos</a>, <a href="Palaio%20Faliro">Palaio Faliro</a>, <a href="Ellinikon">Elliniko</a>, <a href="Voula">Voula</a>, <a href="Vouliagmeni">Vouliagmeni</a> and <a href="Varkiza">Varkiza</a>) host a number of sandy beaches, most of which are operated by the <a href="Greek%20National%20Tourism%20Organization">Greek National Tourism Organisation</a> and require an entrance fee. Casinos operate on both Mount Parnitha, some from downtown Athens (accessible by car or cable car), and the nearby town of <a href="Loutraki">Loutraki</a> (accessible by car via the Athens – <a href="Corinth">Corinth</a> National Highway, or the suburban rail service <a href="Proastiakos">Proastiakos</a>).
Parnitha National Park is punctuated by well-marked paths, gorges, springs, torrents and caves dotting the protected area. Hiking and mountain-biking in all four mountains are popular outdoor activities for residents of the city. The <a href="National%20Garden%20of%20Athens">National Garden of Athens</a> was completed in 1840 and is a green refuge of 15.5 hectares in the centre of the Greek capital. It is to be found between the Parliament and <a href="Zappeion">Zappeion</a> buildings, the latter of which maintains its own garden of seven hectares.

Parts of the city centre have been redeveloped under a masterplan called the "Unification of Archeological Sites of Athens", which has also gathered funding from the EU to help enhance the project. The landmark <a href="Dionysiou%20Areopagitou%20Street">Dionysiou Areopagitou Street</a> has been pedestrianised, forming a scenic route. The route starts from the <a href="Temple%20of%20Olympian%20Zeus%20%28Athens%29">Temple of Olympian Zeus</a> at Vasilissis Olgas Avenue, continues under the southern slopes of the Acropolis near <a href="Plaka">Plaka</a>, and finishes just beyond the <a href="Temple%20of%20Hephaestus">Temple of Hephaestus</a> in <a href="Thiseio">Thiseio</a>. The route in its entirety provides visitors with views of the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a> and the <a href="ancient%20Agora%20of%20Athens">Agora</a> (the meeting point of ancient Athenians), away from the busy city centre.

The hills of Athens also provide green space. <a href="Mount%20Lycabettus">Lycabettus</a>, <a href="Philopappos%20Monument">Philopappos hill</a> and the area around it, including <a href="Pnyx">Pnyx</a> and <a href="Ardettos%20hill">Ardettos hill</a>, are planted with pines and other trees, with the character of a small forest rather than typical metropolitan parkland. Also to be found is the <a href="Pedion%20tou%20Areos">Pedion tou Areos</a> ("Field of Mars") of 27.7 hectares, near the <a href="National%20Archaeological%20Museum%2C%20Athens">National Archaeological Museum</a>.

Athens' largest zoo is the <a href="Attica%20Zoological%20Park">Attica Zoological Park</a>, a 20-hectare (49-acre) private zoo located in the suburb of Spata. The zoo is home to around 2000 animals representing 400 species, and is open 365 days a year. Smaller zoos exist within public gardens or parks, such as the zoo within the National Garden of Athens.

<a href="Mycenaean%20Greece">Mycenean</a> Athens in 1600–1100 BC could have reached the size of <a href="Tiryns">Tiryns</a>; that would put the population at the range of 10,000 – 15,000. During the <a href="Greek%20Dark%20Ages">Greek Dark Ages</a> the population of Athens was around 4,000 people. In 700 BC the population grew to 10,000. In 500 BC the area probably contained 200,000 people. During the classical period the city's population is estimated from 150,000 – 350,000 and up to 610,000 according to <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>. When <a href="Demetrius%20of%20Phalerum">Demetrius of Phalerum</a> conducted a population census in 317 BC the population was 21,000 free citizens, plus 10,000 resident aliens and 400,000 slaves. This suggests a total population of 431,000.

The municipality of Athens has an official population of 664,046 people. The four regional units that make up what is referred to as Greater Athens have a combined population of 2,640,701. They together with the regional unit of Piraeus (Greater Piraeus) make up the dense Athens Urban Area which reaches a total population of 3,090,508 inhabitants (in 2011). As <a href="Eurostat">Eurostat</a> the <a href="Larger%20urban%20zone">FUA</a> of Athens had in 2013 3,828,434 inhabitants, being apparently decreasing compared with the <a href="Greek%20government-debt%20crisis">pre-economic crisis</a> date of 2009 (4,164,175)

The ancient site of Athens is centred on the rocky hill of the acropolis. In ancient times the port of <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> was a separate city, but it has now been absorbed into the Athens Urban Area. The rapid expansion of the city, which continues to this day, was initiated in the 1950s and 1960s, because of Greece's transition from an agricultural to an <a href="Developed%20country">industrial nation</a>. The expansion is now particularly toward the East and North East (a tendency greatly related to the new <a href="Athens%20International%20Airport">Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport</a> and the <a href="Attiki%20Odos">Attiki Odos</a>, the freeway that cuts across <a href="Attica">Attica</a>). By this process Athens has engulfed many former suburbs and villages in Attica, and continues to do so. The table below shows the historical population of Athens in recent times.

The large City Centre of the Greek capital falls directly within the municipality of Athens, which is the largest in population size in Greece. <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> also forms a significant city centre on its own, within the Athens Urban Area and being the second largest in population size within it, with <a href="Peristeri">Peristeri</a> and <a href="Kallithea">Kallithea</a> following.

The Athens Urban Area today consists of 40 municipalities, 35 of which make up what is referred to as the Greater Athens municipalities, located within 4 regional units (<a href="North%20Athens%20%28regional%20unit%29">North Athens</a>, <a href="West%20Athens%20%28regional%20unit%29">West Athens</a>, <a href="Central%20Athens%20%28regional%20unit%29">Central Athens</a>, <a href="South%20Athens%20%28regional%20unit%29">South Athens</a>); and a further 5, which make up the Greater Piraeus municipalities, located within the <a href="Piraeus%20%28regional%20unit%29">regional unit of Piraeus</a> as mentioned above. The densely built up urban area of the Greek capital sprawls across throughout the "Attica Basin" and has a total population of 3,074,160 (in 2011).

The Athens Metropolitan Area spans within the <a href="Attica%20%28region%29">Attica</a> region and includes a total of 58 municipalities, which are organized in 7 regional units (those outlined above, along with <a href="East%20Attica">East Attica</a> and <a href="West%20Attica">West Attica</a>), having reached a population of 3,737,550 based on the preliminary results of the 2011 census. Athens and Piraeus municipalities serve as the two metropolitan centres of the Athens Metropolitan Area. There are also some inter-municipal centres serving specific areas. For example, <a href="Kifissia">Kifissia</a> and <a href="Glyfada">Glyfada</a> serve as inter-municipal centres for northern and southern suburbs respectively.

The city is a world centre of <a href="archaeology">archaeological research</a>. Along with national institutions, such as the <a href="National%20and%20Kapodistrian%20University%20of%20Athens">Athens University</a> and the <a href="Archaeological%20Society%20of%20Athens">Archaeological Society</a>, there are multiple archaeological Museums including the <a href="National%20Archaeological%20Museum%2C%20Athens">National Archaeological Museum</a>, the <a href="Goulandris%20Museum%20of%20Cycladic%20Art">Cycladic Museum</a>, the <a href="Epigraphy">Epigraphic</a> Museum, the <a href="Byzantine%20%26amp%3B%20Christian%20Museum">Byzantine & Christian Museum</a>, as well as museums at the ancient <a href="Ancient%20Agora%20of%20Athens">Agora</a>, <a href="Acropolis%20Museum">Acropolis</a>, <a href="Kerameikos">Kerameikos</a>, and the <a href="Kerameikos%20Archaeological%20Museum">Kerameikos Archaeological Museum</a>. The city is also home to the <a href="Democritus">Demokritos</a> laboratory for <a href="Archaeological%20science">Archaeometry</a>, alongside regional and national archaeological authorities that form part of the <a href="Minister%20for%20Culture%20%28Greece%29">Greek Department of Culture</a>.

Athens hosts 17 <a href="List%20of%20Foreign%20Archaeological%20Institutes%20in%20Greece">Foreign Archaeological Institutes</a> which promote and facilitate research by scholars from their home countries. As a result, Athens has more than a dozen archaeological libraries and three specialized archaeological laboratories, and is the venue of several hundred specialized lectures, conferences and seminars, as well as dozens of archaeological exhibitions, each year. At any given time, hundreds of international scholars and researchers in all disciplines of archaeology are to be found in the city.

Athens' most important museums include:

Athens has been a destination for travellers since antiquity. Over the past decade, the city's infrastructure and social amenities have improved, in part because of its successful bid to stage the <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics">2004 Olympic Games</a>. The Greek Government, aided by the EU, has funded major infrastructure projects such as the state-of-the-art <a href="Athens%20International%20Airport">Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport</a>, the expansion of the <a href="Athens%20Metro">Athens Metro</a> system, and the new <a href="Attiki%20Odos">Attiki Odos</a> Motorway.

Athens was voted as the third best European city to visit in 2015 by European Best Destination. More than 240,000 people voted.

Athens is home to 148 theatrical stages, more than any other city in the world, including the ancient <a href="Odeon%20of%20Herodes%20Atticus">Odeon of Herodes Atticus</a>, home to the <a href="Athens%20Festival">Athens Festival</a>, which runs from May to October each year. In addition to a large number of multiplexes, Athens plays host to open air garden cinemas.

Athens has a long tradition in sports and sporting events, serving as home to the most important clubs in <a href="Sport%20in%20Greece">Greek sport</a> and housing a large number of sports facilities. The city has also been host to sports events of international importance.

Athens has hosted the <a href="Summer%20Olympic%20Games">Summer Olympic Games</a> twice, in <a href="1896%20Summer%20Olympics">1896</a> and <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics">2004</a>. The 2004 Summer Olympics required the development of the <a href="Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Athens%29">Athens Olympic Stadium</a>, which has since gained a reputation as one of the most beautiful stadiums in the world, and one of its most interesting modern monuments.

Other notable clubs within Athens are <a href="Athinaikos">Athinaikos</a>, <a href="Panionios">Panionios</a>, <a href="Atromitos%20F.C.">Atromitos</a>, <a href="Apollon%20Smyrni%20F.C.">Apollon</a>, <a href="Panellinios%20G.S.">Panellinios</a>, <a href="Ethnikos%20Piraeus">Ethnikos Piraeus</a>, <a href="Maroussi%20BC">Maroussi BC</a> and <a href="Peristeri%20B.C.">Peristeri B.C.</a>. Athenian clubs have also had domestic and international success in other sports.

The Athens area encompasses a variety of <a href="terrain">terrain</a>, notably hills and mountains rising around the city, and the capital is the only major city in Europe to be bisected by a <a href="mountain%20range">mountain range</a>. Four mountain ranges extend into city boundaries and thousands of miles of trails criss-cross the city and neighbouring areas, providing exercise and wilderness access on <a href="hiking">foot</a> and <a href="Mountain%20biking">bike</a>.

Beyond Athens and across the prefecture of Attica, outdoor activities include <a href="skiing">skiing</a>, <a href="rock%20climbing">rock climbing</a>, <a href="hang%20gliding">hang gliding</a> and windsurfing. Numerous outdoor clubs serve these sports, including the Athens Chapter of the <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a>, which leads over 4,000 outings annually in the area.
Beside the above clubs, inside the boundaries of Athens municipality there are some more clubs with presence in national divisions or notable action for short periods. Some of them are <a href="PAO%20Rouf">PAO Rouf</a> (<a href="Rouf%2C%20Athens">Rouf</a>) with earlier presence in <a href="Gamma%20Ethniki">Gamma Ethniki</a>, <a href="Petralona%20F.C.">Petralona F.C.</a>() (<a href="Petralona">Petralona</a>), football club founded in 1963, with earlier presence in <a href="Beta%20Ethniki">Beta Ethniki</a>, <a href="Attikos%20F.C.">Attikos F.C.</a>() (<a href="Kolonos">Kolonos</a>), football club founded in 1919 with short presence in <a href="Gamma%20Ethniki">Gamma Ethniki</a>, <a href="Athinais%20Kypselis">Athinais Kypselis</a>() (<a href="Kypseli%2C%20Athens">Kypseli</a>), football club founded in 1938 with short presence in <a href="Gamma%20Ethniki">Gamma Ethniki</a>, <a href="Gyziakos">Gyziakos</a> (<a href="Gyzi">Gyzi</a>), basketball club founded in 1937 with short presence in Beta Ethniki basketball and <a href="Aetos%20B.C.">Aetos B.C.</a>() (<a href="Agios%20Panteleimonas%2C%20Athens">Agios Panteleimonas</a>), basketball club founded in 1992 with earlier presence in <a href="A2%20Ethniki">A2 Ethniki</a> Basketball. Another important Athenian sport club is the <a href="Athens%20Tennis%20Club">Athens Tennis Club</a> founded in 1895 with important offer for the Greek tennis.

The most successful songs during the period 1870–1930 were the so-called Athenian serenades (Αθηναϊκές καντάδες), based on the <a href="Heptanese">Heptanese</a>an <a href="Greek%20folk%20music%23Ionian%20Islands">kantádhes</a> (καντάδες '<a href="serenade">serenade</a>s'; sing.: καντάδα) and the songs performed on stage (επιθεωρησιακά τραγούδια 'theatrical revue songs') in <a href="revues">revues</a>, <a href="Musical%20theatre">musical comedies</a>, <a href="operettas">operettas</a> and <a href="nocturnes">nocturnes</a> that were dominating Athens' theatre scene.

Notable composers of <a href="operetta">operetta</a>s or <a href="nocturne">nocturne</a>s were <a href="Kostas%20Giannidis">Kostas Giannidis</a>, <a href="Dionysios%20Lavrangas">Dionysios Lavrangas</a>, <a href="Nikos%20Hatziapostolou">Nikos Hatziapostolou</a>, while <a href="Theophrastos%20Sakellaridis">Theophrastos Sakellaridis</a>' "The Godson" remains probably the most popular operetta. Despite the fact that the Athenian songs were not autonomous artistic creations (in contrast with the serenades) and despite their original connection with mainly <a href="Drama%20%28Art%20Form%29">dramatic forms of Art</a>, they eventually became hits as independent songs. Notable actors of Greek operettas, who made also a series of melodies and songs popular at that time, include <a href="Orestis%20Makris">Orestis Makris</a>, <a href="Kalouta%20sisters">Kalouta sisters</a>, <a href="Vasilis%20Avlonitis">Vasilis Avlonitis</a>, <a href="Afroditi%20Laoutari">Afroditi Laoutari</a>, <a href="Eleni%20Papadaki">Eleni Papadaki</a>, <a href="Marika%20Nezer">Marika Nezer</a>, <a href="Marika%20Krevata">Marika Krevata</a> and others. After 1930, wavering among American and European musical influences as well as the Greek musical tradition. Greek composers begin to write music using the tunes of the <a href="Tango%20%28dance%29">tango</a>, <a href="waltz">waltz</a>, <a href="Swing%20music">swing</a>, <a href="foxtrot">foxtrot</a>, some times combined with melodies in the style of Athenian serenades' repertory. <a href="Nikos%20Gounaris">Nikos Gounaris</a> was probably the most renowned composer and singer of the time.

In 1923, after the <a href="population%20exchange%20between%20Greece%20and%20Turkey">population exchange between Greece and Turkey</a>, many <a href="ethnic%20Greeks">ethnic Greeks</a> from <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a> fled to Athens as a result of the <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281919%E2%80%931922%29">Greco-Turkish War</a>. They settled in poor neighborhoods and brought with them <a href="Rebetiko">Rebetiko</a> music, making it popular also in Greece, which became later the base for the <a href="La%C3%AFko">Laïko</a> music. Other forms of song popular today in Greece are elafrolaika, entechno, dimotika, and skyladika. Greece's most notable, and internationally famous, composers of Greek song, mainly of the entechno form, are Manos Hadjidakis and Mikis Theodorakis. Both composers have achieved fame abroad for their composition of film scores.

Athens is the financial capital of Greece, and multinational companies such as <a href="Ericsson">Ericsson</a>, <a href="Siemens">Siemens</a>, <a href="Motorola">Motorola</a> and <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> have their regional research and development headquarters there.

Located on <a href="Panepistimiou%20Street">Panepistimiou Street</a>, the old campus of the <a href="National%20and%20Kapodistrian%20University%20of%20Athens">University of Athens</a>, the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Greece">National Library</a>, and the Athens Academy form the "Athens Trilogy" built in the mid-19th century. Most of the university's workings have been moved to a much larger, modern campus located in the eastern suburb of <a href="Zografou">Zografou</a>. The second higher education institution in the city is the <a href="National%20Technical%20University%20of%20Athens">Athens Polytechnic School</a>, found in Patission Street. This was the location where on 17 November 1973, more than 13 students were killed and hundreds injured inside the university during the <a href="Athens%20Polytechnic%20uprising">Athens Polytechnic uprising</a>, against the <a href="Greek%20military%20junta%20of%201967%E2%80%931974">military junta</a> that ruled the nation from 21 April 1967 until <a href="Turkish%20invasion%20of%20Cyprus">23 July 1974</a>.

Other universities that lie within Athens are the <a href="Athens%20University%20of%20Economics%20and%20Business">Athens University of Economics and Business</a>, the <a href="Panteion%20University">Panteion University</a>, the <a href="Agricultural%20University%20of%20Athens">Agricultural University of Athens</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Piraeus">University of Piraeus</a>. There are overall eleven state-supported Institutions of Higher (or Tertiary) education located in the Metropolitan Area of Athens, these are by chronological order: <a href="Athens%20School%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Athens School of Fine Arts</a> (1837), <a href="National%20Technical%20University%20of%20Athens">National Technical University of Athens</a> (1837), <a href="National%20and%20Kapodistrian%20University%20of%20Athens">National and Kapodistrian University of Athens</a> (1837), <a href="Agricultural%20University%20of%20Athens">Agricultural University of Athens</a> (1920), <a href="Athens%20University%20of%20Economics%20and%20Business">Athens University of Economics and Business</a> (1920), <a href="Panteion%20University%20of%20Social%20and%20Political%20Sciences">Panteion University of Social and Political Sciences</a> (1927), <a href="University%20of%20Piraeus">University of Piraeus</a> (1938), <a href="Technological%20Educational%20Institute%20of%20Piraeus">Technological Educational Institute of Piraeus</a> (1976), <a href="Technological%20Educational%20Institute%20of%20Athens">Technological Educational Institute of Athens</a> (1983), <a href="Harokopio%20University">Harokopio University</a> (1990), <a href="School%20of%20Pedagogical%20and%20Technological%20Education">School of Pedagogical and Technological Education</a> (2002). There are also several other private "colleges", as they called formally in Greece, as the establishment of private universities is prohibited by the constitution. Many of them are accredited by a foreign state or university such as the <a href="American%20College%20of%20Greece">American College of Greece</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Indianapolis%20%E2%80%93%20Athens%20Campus">Athens Campus</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Indianapolis">University of Indianapolis</a>.

By the late 1970s, the pollution of Athens had become so destructive that according to the then Greek <a href="Minister%20for%20Culture%20%28Greece%29">Minister of Culture</a>, Constantine Trypanis, ""...the carved details on the five the caryatids of the Erechtheum had seriously degenerated, while the face of the horseman on the Parthenon's west side was all but obliterated."" A series of measures taken by the authorities of the city throughout the 1990s resulted in the improvement of air quality; the appearance of smog (or "nefos" as the Athenians used to call it) has become less common.

Measures taken by the Greek authorities throughout the 1990s have improved the quality of air over the Attica Basin. Nevertheless, air pollution still remains an issue for Athens, particularly during the hottest summer days. In late June 2007, the <a href="Attica">Attica</a> region experienced a number of <a href="2007%20Greek%20forest%20fires">brush fires</a>, including a blaze that burned a significant portion of a large forested national park in <a href="Parnitha">Mount Parnitha</a>, considered critical to maintaining a better air quality in Athens all year round. Damage to the park has led to worries over a stalling in the improvement of air quality in the city.

The major waste management efforts undertaken in the last decade (particularly the plant built on the small island of Psytalia) have improved <a href="water%20quality">water quality</a> in the Saronic Gulf, and the coastal waters of Athens are now accessible again to swimmers. In January 2007, Athens faced a waste management problem when its <a href="landfill">landfill</a> near <a href="Ano%20Liosia">Ano Liosia</a>, an Athenian suburb, reached capacity. The crisis eased by mid-January when authorities began taking the garbage to a temporary landfill.

Athens is serviced by a variety of transportation means, forming the largest mass transit system of Greece. The <a href="Athens%20Mass%20Transit%20System">Athens Mass Transit System</a> consists of a large bus fleet, a <a href="trolleybus">trolleybus</a> fleet that mainly serves Athens's city center, the city's Metro, a <a href="commuter%20rail">commuter rail</a> service and a <a href="Athens%20Tram">tram network</a>, connecting the southern suburbs to the city centre.

Ethel () (Etaireia Thermikon Leoforeion), or "Thermal Bus Company", is the main operator of buses in Athens. Its network consists of about 300 bus lines which span the Athens Metropolitan Area, with an operating staff of 5,327, and a fleet of 1,839 buses. Of those 1,839 buses 416 run on <a href="compressed%20natural%20gas">compressed natural gas</a>, making up the largest fleet of natural gas-powered buses in Europe.

Besides being served by a fleet of natural-gas and <a href="diesel%20engine">diesel</a> buses, the Athens Urban Area is also served by <a href="trolleybus">trolleybus</a>es – or electric buses, as they are referred to in the name of the operating company. The network is operated by "Electric Buses of the Athens and <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> Region", or <a href="ILPAP">ILPAP</a> () and consists of 22 lines with an operating staff of 1,137. All of the 366 trolleybuses are equipped to enable them to run on diesel in case of <a href="power%20outage">power failure</a>.

International and regional bus links are provided by <a href="KTEL%20%28Greece%29">KTEL</a> from two InterCity Bus Terminals, <a href="Kifissos%20Bus%20Terminal">Kifissos Bus Terminal</a> A and <a href="Liosion%20Bus%20Terminal">Liosion Bus Terminal</a> B, both located in the north-western part of the city. "Kifissos" provides connections towards the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a> and <a href="Attica">Attica</a>, whereas "Liosion" is used for most northerly mainland destinations.

The <a href="Athens%20Metro">Athens Metro</a> is more commonly known in Greece as the <a href="Attiko%20Metro">Attiko Metro</a> () and provides public transport throughout the Athens Urban Area. While its main purpose is transport, it also houses Greek artifacts found during construction of the system. The Athens Metro has an operating staff of 387 and runs two of the three metro lines; namely the <a href="Red%20%28line%202%29">Red (line 2)</a> and <a href="Blue%20%28line%203%29">Blue (line 3)</a> lines, which were constructed largely during the 1990s, with the initial sections opened in January 2000. All routes run entirely underground and a fleet of 42 trains consisting of 252 cars operate within the network, with a daily occupancy of 550,000 passengers.

The Red Line (line 2) runs from <a href="Anthoupoli%20metro%20station">Anthoupoli</a> station to <a href="Elliniko%20metro%20station">Elliniko</a> station and covers a distance of . The line connects the western suburbs of Athens with the southeast suburbs passing through the center of Athens. The line associated with <a href="Green%20%28line%201%29">Green (line 1)</a> stations at <a href="Attiki">Attiki</a> and <a href="Omonoia%20Square">Omonoia Square</a> station. Also the line connected with the <a href="Blue%20%28line%203%29">Blue (line 3)</a> at <a href="Syntagma%20Square">Syntagma Square</a> station and connected with Tram at <a href="Syntagma%20Square">Syntagma Square</a>, <a href="Sygrou-Fix">Sygrou-Fix</a> and <a href="Agios%20Ioannis%20metro%20station">Agios Ioannis</a> station.

The Blue Line (line 3) runs from the western suburbs, namely <a href="Agia%20Marina%20metro%20station">Agia Marina</a> to the <a href="Egaleo">Egaleo</a> station, through the central <a href="Monastiraki">Monastiraki</a> and <a href="Syntagma%20metro%20station">Syntagma</a> stations to <a href="Doukissis%20Plakentias%20station">Doukissis Plakentias</a> avenue in the northeastern suburb of <a href="Chalandri">Halandri</a>, covering a distance of , then ascending to ground level and reaching <a href="Athens%20International%20Airport">Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport</a>, using the Suburban Railway infrastructure and extending its length to . The spring 2007 extension from Monastiraki westwards, to <a href="Egaleo">Egaleo</a>, connected some of the main <a href="Nightlife">night life</a> hubs of the city, namely the ones of Gazi (<a href="Kerameikos">Kerameikos</a> station) with Psirri (<a href="Monastiraki">Monastiraki</a> station) and the city centre (<a href="Syntagma%20station">Syntagma station</a>). Extensions are under construction to the west southwest suburbs of Athens, reaching to the port and the center of Piraeus. The new stations will be Agia Barvara, Koridallos, Nikaia, Maniatika, Piraeus and Dimotiko Theatro station. The stations will be ready in 2017, connecting the biggest port of Greece <a href="Piraeus%20Port">Piraeus Port</a> with the biggest airport of Greece the <a href="Athens%20International%20Airport">Athens International Airport</a>.

Not run by the Athens Metro company, is the ISAP (), the "Electric Railway Company" line, which for many years served as Athens's primary urban rail transport. This is today the Green Line (line 1) of the Athens Metro network as shown on maps, and unlike the red and blue lines, ISAP has many above-ground sections on its route. This was the original metro line from Piraeus to Kifisia; serving 22 stations, with a network length of , an operating staff of 730 and a fleet of 44 trains and 243 cars. ISAP's occupancy rate is 600,000 passengers daily.

The Green Line (line 1) now serves 24 stations, and forms the oldest line of the Athens metro network and for the most part runs at ground level, connecting the port of <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> with the northern suburb of <a href="Kifissia">Kifissia</a>. The line is set to be extended to Agios Stefanos, a suburb located to the north of Athens, reaching to .

The Athens Metropolitan Railway system is managed by three companies; namely ISAP (line 1), Attiko Metro (lines 2 & 3), while its commuter rail, the <a href="Proastiakos">Proastiakós</a> is considered as line 4.

The Athens commuter rail service, referred to as the "<a href="Proastiakos">Proastiakós</a>", connects <a href="Athens%20International%20Airport">Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport</a> to the city of <a href="Kiato">Kiato</a>, west of Athens, via Larissa station, the city's central rail station and the port of Piraeus. The service is sometimes considered the fourth line of the Athens Metro. The length of Athens's commuter rail network extends to , and is expected to stretch to by 2010. The Proastiakos will be extended to Xylokastro west of Athens and Chalkida.

<a href="Athens%20Tram%20SA">Athens Tram SA</a> operates a fleet of 35 vehicles, called 'Sirios', which serve 48 stations, employ 345 people with an average daily occupancy of 65,000 passengers. The tram network spans a total length of and covers ten Athenian suburbs. The network runs from <a href="Syntagma%20Square">Syntagma Square</a> to the southwestern suburb of <a href="Palaio%20Faliro">Palaio Faliro</a>, where the line splits in two branches; the first runs along the Athens coastline toward the southern suburb of <a href="Voula">Voula</a>, while the other heads toward the <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> district of Neo Faliro. The network covers the majority of the Saronic coastline. Further extensions are planned towards the major commercial port of <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>. The expansion to Piraeus will include 12 new stations, increase the overall length of tram route by , and increase the overall transportation network.

Athens is served by the <a href="Athens%20International%20Airport">Athens International Airport</a> (ATH), located near the town of <a href="Spata">Spata</a>, in the eastern Messoghia plain, some east of Athens. The airport, awarded the "European Airport of the Year 2004" Award, is intended as an expandable hub for air travel in <a href="Balkans">southeastern Europe</a> and was constructed in 51 months, costing 2.2 billion euros. It employs a staff of 14,000.

The airport is served by the Metro, the <a href="Proastiakos">suburban rail</a>, buses to <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> port, Athens' city centre and its suburbs, and also taxis. The airport accommodates 65 landings and take-offs per hour, with its 24-passenger boarding bridges, 144 check-in counters and broader main terminal; and a commercial area of which includes cafés, <a href="duty-free%20shop">duty-free shop</a>s, and a small museum.

In 2014, the airport handled 15,196,369 passengers, an increase of 21.2% over the previous year of 2013. Of those 15,196,369 passengers, 5,267,593 passed through the airport for domestic flights, and 9,970,006 passengers travelled through for international flights. Beyond the dimensions of its passenger capacity, ATH handled 205,294 total flights in 2007, or approximately 562 flights per day.

Athens is the hub of the <a href="Hellenic%20Railways%20Organisation">country's national railway system</a> (OSE), connecting the capital with major cities across Greece and abroad (<a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a> and <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>).The <a href="Port%20of%20Piraeus">Port of Piraeus</a> connects Athens to the numerous <a href="List%20of%20islands%20of%20Greece">Greek islands</a> of the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>, with ferries departing, while also serving the cruise ships that arrive.

Two main motorways of Greece begin in Athens, namely the <a href="Motorway%201%20%28Greece%29">A1</a>/<a href="European%20route%20E75">E75</a>, which crosses through Athens's Urban Area from <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>, heading north towards Greece's second largest city, <a href="Thessaloniki">Thessaloniki</a>; and the <a href="Olympia%20Odos">A8</a>/<a href="European%20route%20E94">E94</a> heading west, towards <a href="Patras">Patras</a>, which incorporated the <a href="Greek%20National%20Road%208A">GR-8A</a>. Before their completion much of the road traffic used the <a href="Greek%20National%20Road%201">GR-1</a> and the <a href="Greek%20National%20Road%208">GR-8</a>.

Athens' Metropolitan Area is served by the motorway network of the <a href="Attiki%20Odos">Attiki Odos</a> toll-motorway (code: <a href="Attiki%20Odos">A6</a>). Its main section extends from the western industrial suburb of <a href="Eleusina">Elefsina</a> to <a href="Athens%20International%20Airport">Athens International Airport</a>; while two beltways, namely the Aigaleo Beltway (A65) and the Hymettus Beltway (A64) serve parts of western and eastern Athens respectively. The span of the Attiki Odos in all its length is , making it the largest metropolitan motorway network in all of Greece.

1896 brought forth the revival of the modern Olympic Games, by Frenchman <a href="Pierre%20de%20Coubertin">Pierre de Coubertin</a>. Thanks to his efforts, Athens was awarded the first modern Olympic Games. In 1896, the city had a population of 123,000 and the event helped boost the city's international profile. Of the venues used for these Olympics, the <a href="Kallimarmaro">Kallimarmaro</a> Stadium, and <a href="Zappeion">Zappeion</a> were most crucial. The Kallimarmaro is a replica of the ancient Athenian stadiums, and the only major stadium (in its capacity of 60,000) to be made entirely of white marble from Mount <a href="Penteli%2C%20Greece">Penteli</a>, the same material used for construction of the <a href="Parthenon">Parthenon</a>.

The <a href="1906%20Intercalated%20Games">1906 Summer Olympics</a>, or the 1906 Intercalated games, were held in Athens. The intercalated competitions were intermediate games to the internationally organized Olympics, and were meant to be organized in Greece every four years, between the main Olympics. This idea later lost support from the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">IOC</a> and these games were discontinued.

Athens was awarded the 2004 Summer Olympics on 5 September 1997 in <a href="Lausanne">Lausanne</a>, Switzerland, after having lost a previous bid to host the <a href="1996%20Summer%20Olympics">1996 Summer Olympics</a>, to <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, United States. It was to be the second time Athens would host the games, following the inaugural event of 1896. After an unsuccessful bid in 1990, the 1997 bid was radically improved, including an appeal to Greece's Olympic history. In the last round of voting, Athens defeated Rome with 66 votes to 41. Prior to this round, the cities of <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, Stockholm and <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> had been eliminated from competition, having received fewer votes.

During the first three years of preparations, the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> had expressed concern over the speed of construction progress for some of the new Olympic venues. In 2000 the Organising Committee's president was replaced by <a href="Gianna%20Angelopoulos-Daskalaki">Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki</a>, who was the president of the original Bidding Committee in 1997. From that point forward, preparations continued at a highly accelerated, almost frenzied pace.

Although the heavy cost was criticized, estimated at $1.5 billion, Athens was transformed into a more functional city that enjoys modern technology both in transportation and in modern <a href="urban%20planning">urban development</a>. Some of the finest sporting venues in the world were created in the city, all of which were fully ready for the games. The games welcomed over 10,000 athletes from all 202 countries.

The 2004 Games were judged a success, as both security and organization worked well, and only a few visitors reported minor problems mainly concerning accommodation issues. The 2004 Olympic Games were described as "Unforgettable, dream Games", by IOC President <a href="Jacques%20Rogge">Jacques Rogge</a> for their return to the birthplace of the Olympics, and for meeting the challenges of holding the Olympic Games. The only observable problem was a somewhat sparse attendance of some early events. Eventually, however, a total of more than 3.5 million tickets were sold, which was higher than any other Olympics with the exception of Sydney (more than 5 million tickets were sold there in 2000).

In 2008 it was reported that most of the Olympic venues had fallen into disrepair: according to those reports, 21 of the 22 facilities built for the games had either been left abandoned or are in a state of dereliction, with several <a href="squatting">squatter</a> camps having sprung up around certain facilities, and a number of venues afflicted by <a href="vandalism">vandalism</a>, graffiti or strewn with rubbish. These claims, however, are disputed and likely to be inaccurate, as most of the facilities used for the <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics">Athens Olympics</a> are either in use or in the process of being converted for post-Olympics use. The Greek Government has created a corporation, Olympic Properties SA, which is overseeing the post-Olympics management, development and conversion of these facilities, some of which will be sold off (or have already been sold off) to the private sector, while other facilities are still in use just as during the Olympics, or have been converted for commercial use or modified for other sports. Concerts and theatrical shows, such as those by the troupe Cirque du Soleil, have recently been held in the complex.

The 2011 <a href="Special%20Olympics%20World%20Summer%20Games">Special Olympics World Summer Games</a> was in Athens. The opening ceremony of the games took place on 25 June 2011 at the Panathinaiko Stadium and the closing ceremony was held on 4 July 2011.

Over 7,500 athletes, from 185 countries, competed in a total of 22 sports.

Anguilla

Anguilla ( ) is a <a href="British%20Overseas%20Territories">British overseas territory</a> in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. It is one of the most northerly of the <a href="Leeward%20Islands">Leeward Islands</a> in the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>, lying east of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and the <a href="Virgin%20Islands">Virgin Islands</a> and directly north of <a href="Saint%20Martin">Saint Martin</a>. The territory consists of the main island of Anguilla, approximately 16 miles (26 km) long by 3 miles (5 km) wide at its widest point, together with a number of much smaller islands and <a href="cay">cay</a>s with no permanent population. The island's capital is <a href="The%20Valley%2C%20Anguilla">The Valley</a>. The total land area of the territory is 35 square miles (90 km), with a population of approximately ( estimate).

Anguilla has become a popular <a href="tax%20haven">tax haven</a>, having no capital gains, estate, profit or other forms of direct taxation on either individuals or corporations. In April 2011, faced with a mounting deficit, it introduced a 3% "Interim Stabilisation Levy", Anguilla's first form of <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a>.

On 7 September 2017, the Category 5 <a href="Hurricane%20Irma">Hurricane Irma</a> hit the island. As of the next day, one death had been reported; the island also sustained extensive damage to many buildings, including government ones, as well as its electricity infrastructure and water supply. The UK government summarized this as "severe and in places critical" damage. A few days later, <a href="Hurricane%20Jose%20%282017%29">Hurricane Jose</a> largely bypassed Anguilla.

The name Anguilla is an <a href="Anglicization%20of%20names">anglicised</a> or <a href="Latinization%20of%20names">latinate</a> form of earlier Spanish "" meaning "<a href="eel">eel</a>" in reference to the island's shape. It is believed by most sources to have been named by <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>. For similar reasons, it was also known as "Snake" or "Snake Island".

Anguilla was first settled by Indigenous Amerindian peoples who migrated from South America. The earliest Native American artefacts found on Anguilla have been dated to around 1300 ; remains of settlements date from  600. The <a href="Arawak">Arawak</a> name for the island seems to have been "Malliouhana". The date of European colonisation is uncertain: some sources claim that <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Columbus</a> sighted the island during his second voyage in 1493, while others state that the island's first European explorer was the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20France">French</a> Huguenot nobleman and merchant mariner <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Goulaine%20de%20Laudonni%C3%A8re">René Goulaine de Laudonnière</a> in 1564.

Traditional accounts state that Anguilla was first colonised by <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">English</a> settlers from <a href="Saint%20Kitts">Saint Kitts</a> beginning in 1650. In this early colonial period, however, Anguilla sometimes served as a place of refuge and recent scholarship focused on Anguilla has placed greater significance on other Europeans and <a href="creole%20peoples">creoles</a> migrating from <a href="St.%20Kitts">St. Christopher</a>, <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>, <a href="Nevis">Nevis</a> and <a href="Antigua">Antigua</a>. The French temporarily took over the island in 1666 but returned it to English control under the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Breda%20%281667%29">Treaty of Breda</a> the next year. A Major John Scott who visited in September 1667, wrote of leaving the island "in good condition" and noted that in July 1668, "200 or 300 people fled thither in time of war".

It is likely that some of these early Europeans brought enslaved Africans with them. Historians confirm that <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">African slaves</a> lived in the region in the early 17th century. For example, Africans from <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a> lived in St. Christopher in 1626. By 1672 a slave depot existed on the island of Nevis, serving the <a href="Leeward%20Islands">Leeward Islands</a>. While the time of African arrival in Anguilla is difficult to place precisely, archival evidence indicates a substantial African presence of at least 100 slaves by 1683. These seem to have come from Central Africa as well as West Africa.

Attempts by the French to capture the island during the <a href="War%20of%20Austrian%20Succession">War of Austrian Succession</a> (<a href="Battle%20of%20Anguilla">1745</a>) and the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> (1796) ended in failure.

During the early colonial period, Anguilla was administered by the British through Antigua; in 1825, it was placed under the administrative control of nearby Saint Kitts. In 1967, Britain granted Saint Kitts and <a href="Nevis">Nevis</a> full internal autonomy. Anguilla was also incorporated into the new unified dependency, named <a href="Saint%20Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla">Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla</a>, against the wishes of many Anguillians. This led to two Anguillian Revolutions in 1967 and 1969 headed by Atlin Harrigan and <a href="Ronald%20Webster">Ronald Webster</a>. The island briefly operated as the independent "<a href="Republic%20of%20Anguilla">Republic of Anguilla</a>". The goal of the revolution was not independence per se, but rather independence from Saint Kitts and Nevis and a return to being a British colony. British authority was fully restored in July 1971; in 1980, Anguilla was finally allowed to secede from Saint Kitts and Nevis and become a separate British <a href="Crown%20colony">Crown colony</a> (now a <a href="British%20overseas%20territory">British overseas territory</a>).

Anguilla is an internally self-governing <a href="British%20overseas%20territory">overseas territory</a> of the United Kingdom. Its politics take place in a framework of a <a href="parliamentary%20system">parliamentary</a> <a href="representative%20democracy">representative democratic</a> <a href="Dependent%20territory">dependency</a>, whereby the <a href="Chief%20Minister">Chief Minister</a> is the <a href="head%20of%20government">head of government</a>, and of a <a href="wikt%3Apluriform">pluriform</a> multi-party system.

The <a href="United%20Nations%20Committee%20on%20Decolonization">United Nations Committee on Decolonization</a> includes Anguilla on the <a href="United%20Nations%20list%20of%20Non-Self-Governing%20Territories">United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories</a>. The territory's constitution is Anguilla Constitutional Order 1 April 1982 (amended 1990). <a href="Executive%20power">Executive power</a> is exercised by the government. <a href="Legislative%20power">Legislative power</a> is vested in both the government and the <a href="Anguilla%20House%20of%20Assembly">House of Assembly</a>. The <a href="judiciary">judiciary</a> is independent of the executive and the legislature. 

As a dependency of the UK, the UK is responsible for Anguilla's military defence, although there are no active <a href="garrisons">garrisons</a> or armed forces present. Anguilla has a small <a href="marine%20police">marine police</a> force, comprising around 32 personnel, which operates one M160-class fast <a href="patrol%20boat">patrol boat</a>.

The majority of residents (90.08%) are black, the descendants of slaves transported from Africa. Minorities include whites at 3.74% and people of mixed race at 4.65% (figures from 2001 census).

72% of the population is Anguillian while 28% is non-Anguillian (2001 census). Of the non-Anguillian population, many are citizens of the United States, United Kingdom, <a href="St%20Kitts%20%26amp%3B%20Nevis">St Kitts & Nevis</a>, the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a>, <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> and <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>.

2006 and 2007 saw an influx of large numbers of Chinese, Indian and <a href="Mexican%20people">Mexican</a> workers, brought in as labour for major tourist developments due to the local population not being large enough to support the labour requirements.

Christian churches did not have a consistent or strong presence during the initial period of English colonisation. Spiritual and religious practices of Europeans and Africans tended to reflect their regional origins. As early as 1813, Christian ministers formally ministered to enslaved Africans and promoted literacy among converts. The <a href="Wesleyan">Wesleyan</a> (Methodist) <a href="Missionary%20Society%20of%20England">Missionary Society of England</a> built churches and schools in 1817.

According to the 2001 census, Christianity is Anguilla's predominant religion, with 29 percent of the population practising <a href="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a>. Another 23.9 percent are <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a>. Other churches on the island include <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist">Seventh-day Adventist</a>, <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a>, <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> (served by the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Saint%20John%27s%20-%20Basseterre">Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint John's - Basseterre</a>, with see at Saint John on <a href="Antigua%20and%20Barbuda">Antigua and Barbuda</a>) and a community of <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> (0.7%). Between 1992 and 2001 the number of followers of the <a href="Church%20of%20God%20%28Cleveland%2C%20Tennessee%29">Church of God</a> and <a href="Pentecostals">Pentecostals</a> increased considerably. There are at least 15 churches on the island. Although a minority on the island, it is an important location to followers of <a href="Rastafari%20movement">Rastafarian</a> religion—Anguilla is the birthplace of <a href="Robert%20Athlyi%20Rogers">Robert Athlyi Rogers</a>, author of the "<a href="Holy%20Piby">Holy Piby</a>" which has had a strong influence on Rastafarian beliefs. Various other religions are practised as well. More recently, a Muslim cultural center has opened on the island.

Today most people in Anguilla speak a British-influenced variety of standard English. Other languages are also spoken on the island, including varieties of Spanish, Chinese and the languages of other immigrants. However, the most common language other than Standard English is the island's own English-lexifier Creole language (not to be confused with <a href="Antillean%20Creole">Antillean Creole</a> ('French Creole'), spoken in French islands such as <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a> and <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>). It is referred to locally by terms such as "dialect" (pronounced "dialek"), Anguilla Talk or "Anguillian". It has its main roots in early varieties of English and West African languages, and is similar to the dialects spoken in English-speaking islands throughout the Eastern Caribbean, in terms of its structural features and to the extent of being considered one single language.

Linguists who are interested in the origins of Anguillian and other Caribbean Creoles point out that some of its grammatical features can be traced to African languages while others can be traced to European languages. Three areas have been identified as significant for the identification of the linguistic origins of those forced migrants who arrived before 1710: the <a href="Gold%20Coast%20%28region%29">Gold Coast</a>, the <a href="Slave%20Coast">Slave Coast</a> and the Windward Coast.

Sociohistorical information from Anguilla's archives suggest that Africans and Europeans formed two distinct, but perhaps overlapping speech communities in the early phases of the island's colonisation. "Anguillian" is believed to have emerged as the language of the masses as time passed, slavery was abolished and locals began to see themselves as "belonging" to Anguillian society.

The Anguilla National Trust (ANT) was established in 1988 and opened its offices in 1993 charged with the responsibility of preserving the heritage of the island, including its cultural heritage. The Trust has programmes encouraging Anguillian writers and the preservation of the island's history. In 2015, "Where I See The Sun – Contemporary Poetry in Anguilla" A New Anthology by <a href="Lasana%20M.%20Sekou">Lasana M. Sekou</a> was published by House of Nehesi Publishers. Among the forty three poets in the unprecedented collection are Rita Celestine-Carty, <a href="Bankie%20Banx">Bankie Banx</a>, John T. Harrigan, <a href="Patricia%20J.%20Adams">Patricia J. Adams</a>, Fabian Fahie, Dr. Oluwakemi Linda Banks, and Reuel Ben Lewi.

The island's cultural history begins with the <a href="Ta%C3%ADno%20people">Taino</a> Native Americans. Artifacts have been found around the island, telling of life before European settlers arrived by the <a href="Arawak">Arawak</a> and <a href="Island%20Caribs">Carib</a> peoples.

As throughout the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, holidays are a cultural fixture. Anguilla's most important holidays are of historic as much as cultural importance – particularly the anniversary of the emancipation (previously August Monday in the Park), celebrated as the Summer Festival. British festivities, such as the <a href="Queen%27s%20Official%20Birthday">Queen's Birthday</a>, are also celebrated.

Anguillian cuisine is influenced by native Caribbean, African, Spanish, French and English cuisines. Seafood is abundant, including prawns, shrimp, crab, <a href="spiny%20lobster">spiny lobster</a>, <a href="conch">conch</a>, <a href="mahi-mahi">mahi-mahi</a>, <a href="Lutjanus%20campechanus">red snapper</a>, <a href="marlin">marlin</a> and <a href="grouper">grouper</a>. <a href="Salt%20cod">Salt cod</a> is a staple food eaten on its own and used in stews, casseroles and soups. Livestock is limited due to the small size of the island and people there utilise poultry, pork, goat and mutton, along with imported beef. Goat is the most commonly eaten meat, utilised in a variety of dishes.

A significant amount of the island's produce is imported due to limited land suitable for agriculture production; much of the soil is sandy and infertile. Among the agriculture produced in Anguilla includes tomatoes, <a href="Bell%20pepper">peppers</a>, limes and other <a href="citrus%20fruit">citrus fruit</a>s, onion, garlic, squash, <a href="pigeon%20pea">pigeon pea</a>s and <a href="callaloo">callaloo</a>. Starch staple foods include imported rice and other foods that are imported or locally grown, including <a href="Yam%20%28vegetable%29">yams</a>, sweet potatoes and <a href="breadfruit">breadfruit</a>.

Due to its internationally recognised culinary community, the island has enjoyed a reputation as "the culinary capital of the Caribbean". This reputation was reinforced with the publication of the (WE) Are Anguilla Cookbook, a guide to the cuisine of Anguilla featuring emerging and established local chefs, who share both their signature dishes and personal anecdotes regarding the island's epicurean culture. A publishing contract was secured by The Britto Agency, which had conceived the idea for the book itself.

The island's burgeoning musical community made history with the recording of "Sounds of Anguilla (Volume 1)", the first album ever composed solely of artists from a single Caribbean island representing multiple musical genres: pop, <a href="reggae">reggae</a>, hip-hop, <a href="soca%20music">soca music</a> and R&B. The album, featuring Anguillian musicians such as <a href="Bankie%20Banx">Bankie Banx</a>, Amalia Watty, True Intentions and Gerswin Lake and The Parables, was released on <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a> in June 2015.

A branch of the <a href="Saint%20James%20School%20of%20Medicine">Saint James School of Medicine</a> was established in 2011 in Anguilla. It is a <a href="private%20university">private</a>, <a href="For-profit%20school">for-profit</a> medical school headquartered in <a href="Park%20Ridge%2C%20Illinois">Park Ridge, Illinois</a>. The school's mission is to help motivated students become a doctor, irrespective of ethnic, religious and cultural backgrounds. The school was founded on the belief that a high quality medical education should be affordable and accessible to everyone with the commitment and the ability to succeed in a career in medicine.

Boat racing has deep roots in Anguillian culture and is the national sport.
There are regular sailing <a href="regattas">regattas</a> on national holidays, such as Carnival, which are contested by locally built and designed boats. These boats have names and have sponsors that print their logo on their sails.

As in many other former <a href="British%20Colony">British colonies</a>, cricket is also a popular sport. Anguilla is the home of <a href="Omari%20Banks">Omari Banks</a>, who played for the <a href="West%20Indies%20Cricket%20Team">West Indies Cricket Team</a>, while <a href="Cardigan%20Connor">Cardigan Connor</a> played first-class cricket for English county side <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a> and was 'chef de mission' (team manager) for Anguilla's <a href="Commonwealth%20Games">Commonwealth Games</a> team in 2002.

<a href="Rugby%20union">Rugby union</a> is represented in Anguilla by the Anguilla Eels RFC, who were formed in April 2006. The Eels have been finalists in the St. Martin tournament in November 2006 and semi-finalists in 2007, 2008, 2009 and Champions in 2010. The Eels were formed in 2006 by Scottish club national second row Martin Welsh, Club Sponsor and President of the AERFC Ms. Jacquie Ruan, and Canadian standout Scrumhalf Mark Harris (Toronto Scottish RFC).

Anguilla is also the birthplace of sprinter <a href="Zharnel%20Hughes">Zharnel Hughes</a> who has represented Great Britain since 2015. He specialises in the 100m and 200m sprints. He won the 100m in the <a href="2013%20CARIFTA%20Games">2013 CARIFTA Games</a> with a time of 10.44 seconds, despite his time being some way below his personal best. He currently holds the ISSA/GraceKennedy Boys' and Girls' Athletics Championships record for the 100m, with a time of 10.12 seconds having taken the record from Yohan Blake.[5][6] On 13 March 2015, Hughes made his Diamond League debut where he was commended for almost beating world champion Usain Bolt.[7] On 24 July 2015, Hughes won the 200m at the London Diamond League meet to take the lead in the Diamond League standings for the season.[8] On 27 August 2015, Hughes came 5th in the 200m at the World Championships in Beijing with a time of 20.02 seconds.

<a href="Shara%20Proctor">Shara Proctor</a>, British Long Jump Silver Medalist in World Championships in Beijing first represented Anguilla in the event until 2010 when she began to represent the UK. Under the Anguillian Flag she achieved several medals in the <a href="North%20American%2C%20Central%20American%20and%20Caribbean%20Athletic%20Association">NACAC</a> games.

<a href="Keith%20Connor">Keith Connor</a>, triple jumper, is also an Anguillian. He represented Great Britain and achieved several international titles including Commonwealth and European Games gold medals and an Olympic bronze medal. Keith later became Head Coach of Australia Athletics.

<a href="Chesney%20Hughes">Chesney Hughes</a>, is a West Indian cricketer who plays for Derbyshire. He was born in Anguilla. Having signed for the side in June 2009, and holding a British passport, Hughes made his List A debut for the side during the 2009 Pro40 League against Warwickshire.

Anguilla has habitat for the <a href="Cuban%20tree%20frog">Cuban tree frog</a>s ("Osteopilus septentrionalis"). The <a href="red-footed%20tortoise">red-footed tortoise</a> ("Chelonoidis carbonaria") is a species of tortoise found here, it somehow came from South America. Hurricanes led to over-water dispersal for the <a href="green%20iguana">green iguana</a>s ("Iguana iguana") to colonise Anguilla. All three animals are introduced.

Five species of bats are known in the literature from Anguilla — the threatened <a href="insular%20single%20leaf%20bat">insular single leaf bat</a> ("Monophyllus plethodon"), the <a href="Antillean%20fruit-eating%20bat">Antillean fruit-eating bat</a> ("Brachyphylla cavernarum"), the <a href="Jamaican%20fruit%20bat">Jamaican fruit bat</a> ("Artibeus jamaicensis"), the <a href="Mexican%20funnel-eared%20bat">Mexican funnel-eared bat</a> ("Natalus stramineus"), and the <a href="velvety%20free-tailed%20bat">velvety free-tailed bat</a> ("Molossus molossus").

Anguilla is a flat, low-lying island of <a href="coral">coral</a> and <a href="limestone">limestone</a> in the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>, east of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and the <a href="Virgin%20Islands">Virgin Islands</a>. It is directly north of <a href="Saint%20Martin">Saint Martin</a>, separated from that island by the <a href="Anguilla%20Channel">Anguilla Channel</a>. The soil is generally thin and poor, supporting scrub, tropical and forest vegetation.

Anguilla is noted for its spectacular and ecologically important <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a>s and beaches. Apart from the main island of Anguilla itself, the territory includes a number of other smaller islands and <a href="cays">cays</a>, mostly tiny and uninhabited. Some of these are:

Anguilla has a volcanic origin and has been submerged repeatedly from <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>.

Northeastern trade winds keep this tropical island relatively cool and dry. Average annual temperature is 80 °F (27 °C). July–October is its hottest period, December–February, its coolest.

Rainfall averages 35 inches (890 mm) annually, although the figures vary from season to season and year to year. The island is subject to both sudden tropical storms and hurricanes, which occur in the period from July to November. The island suffered damage in 1995 from <a href="Hurricane%20Luis">Hurricane Luis</a> and severe flooding 5–20 feet from <a href="Hurricane%20Lenny">Hurricane Lenny</a>.

Anguilla's thin arid soil being largely unsuitable for agriculture, the island has few land-based <a href="natural%20resources">natural resources</a>. Its main industries are tourism, <a href="offshore%20companies">offshore incorporation and management</a>, <a href="offshore%20bank">offshore bank</a>ing, <a href="captive%20insurance">captive insurance</a> and fishing.

Before the 2008 worldwide crisis the economy of Anguilla was expanding rapidly, especially the tourism sector which was driving major new developments in partnerships with multi-national companies.

Anguilla's currency is the <a href="East%20Caribbean%20dollar">East Caribbean dollar</a>, though the US dollar is also widely accepted. The exchange rate is fixed to the US dollar at US$1 = EC$2.70.

The economy, and especially the tourism sector, suffered a setback in late 1995 due to the effects of <a href="Hurricane%20Luis">Hurricane Luis</a> in September but recovered in 1996. Hotels were hit particularly hard during this time. Another economic setback occurred during the aftermath of <a href="Hurricane%20Lenny">Hurricane Lenny</a> in 2000.

Anguilla's financial system comprises 7 banks, 2 money services businesses, more than 40 company managers, more than 50 insurers, 12 brokers, more than 250 captive intermediaries, more than 50 mutual funds and 8 trust companies.

Anguilla's tourism industry received a major boost when it was selected to host the <a href="World%20Travel%20Awards">World Travel Awards</a> in December 2014. Known as "the Oscars of the travel industry", the awards ceremony was held at the <a href="CuisinArt%20Resort%20and%20Spa">CuisinArt Resort and Spa</a> and was hosted by award-winning actress <a href="Vivica%20A.%20Fox">Vivica A. Fox</a>. Anguilla was voted the World's Leading Luxury Island Destination from a short list of top-tier candidates such as St. Barts, Maldives and Mauritius.

Anguilla aims to obtain 15% of its energy from <a href="solar%20power">solar power</a> so it is less reliant on expensive imported diesel. The <a href="Climate%20%26amp%3B%20Development%20Knowledge%20Network">Climate & Development Knowledge Network</a> is helping the government gather the information it needs to change the territory's legislation, so it can integrate renewables into its grid. <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>, have also made good progress in switching to renewables, but many other SIDS are still at the early stages of planning how to integrate renewable energy into their grids. "For a small island we're very far ahead," said Beth Barry, Coordinator of the Anguilla Renewable Energy Office. "We've got an Energy Policy and a draft Climate Change policy and have been focussing efforts on the question of <a href="sustainable%20energy">sustainable energy</a> supply for several years now. As a result we have a lot of information we can share with other islands."

Anguilla is served by <a href="Clayton%20J.%20Lloyd%20International%20Airport">Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport</a> (prior to 4 July 2010 known as Wallblake Airport). The primary runway at the airport is in length and can accommodate moderate-sized aircraft. Services connect to various other Caribbean islands via regional carrier <a href="LIAT">LIAT</a>, local charter airlines and others. Although there are no direct scheduled flights to or from continental America or Europe, <a href="Tradewind%20Aviation">Tradewind Aviation</a> and <a href="Cape%20Air">Cape Air</a> provide scheduled air service to San Juan, Puerto Rico. The airport can handle large <a href="narrow-body">narrow-body</a> jets such as the <a href="Boeing%20727">Boeing 727</a>, <a href="Boeing%20737">Boeing 737</a> and <a href="Boeing%20757">Boeing 757</a>.

Aside from taxis, there is no public transport on the island. Cars drive on the left.

Ashmore and Cartier Islands

The Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands is an uninhabited <a href="States%20and%20territories%20of%20Australia">external territory</a> of <a href="Australia">Australia</a> consisting of four low-lying tropical islands in two separate <a href="reef">reef</a>s, and the 12 nautical mile <a href="Territorial%20waters">territorial sea</a> generated by the islands. The territory is located in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> situated on the edge of the <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelf</a>, about off the northwest coast of Australia and south of the <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>n island of <a href="Rote%20Island">Rote</a>.

Ashmore Reef is called "Pulau Pasir" by Indonesians and it is called "Nusa Solokaek" in the <a href="Rotenese%20language">Rotenese language</a>. Both names have the meaning "sand island".

The Territory comprises Ashmore Reef, which includes West, Middle, and <a href="East%20Island%20%28Ashmore%20and%20Cartier%20Islands%29">East Islands</a>, and two <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a>s, and Cartier Reef, which includes <a href="Cartier%20Islands">Cartier Island</a>. Ashmore Reef covers approximately and Cartier Reef , both to the limits of the reefs. They have a total of of shoreline, measured along the outer edge of the <a href="reef">reef</a>. Australia also claims a 12 nautical mile <a href="Territorial%20waters">territorial sea</a> generated by the islands.

West, Middle, and East Islands have a combined land area variously reported as 54 ha, 93 ha, and 112 ha (1 <a href="hectare">hectare</a> is 0.01 km, or about 2.5 <a href="acres">acres</a>). Cartier Island has a reported land area of 0.4 ha.

By a British <a href="Order-in-council">Order-in-council</a> dated 23 July 1931, Ashmore and Cartier Islands were placed under the authority of the Commonwealth of Australia, but Australia officially accepted the Territory on 10 May 1934 when the "Ashmore and Cartier Islands Acceptance Act 1933" came into operation. The Act authorised the <a href="Governor%20of%20Western%20Australia">Governor of Western Australia</a> to make Ordinances for the Territory. In July 1938 the Territory was annexed to the Northern Territory, then also administered by the Commonwealth, whose laws, ordinances and regulations applied to the Territory. When <a href="self-government">self-government</a> was granted to the Northern Territory on 1 July 1978, administration of the Territory was retained by the Commonwealth.

Due to its proximity to Indonesia, and the area being traditional fishing grounds of Indonesian fishermen for centuries, some Indonesian groups claim Ashmore Reef to be part of <a href="Rote%20Ndao%20Regency">Rote Ndao Regency</a> of <a href="East%20Nusa%20Tenggara">East Nusa Tenggara</a> province. However, the Indonesian government does not appear to actively contest Australia's sovereignty of the Territory. Australia's sovereignty is backed up by the fact that the Territory was not administered by the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> (Indonesia's former colonial power), but by the <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> before it was transferred to Australia.

In 1983 the Territory was declared a nature reserve under the "National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975", now replaced by the "<a href="Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act%201999">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</a>".

After the islands became a first point of contact with the <a href="Australian%20migration%20zone">Australian migration zone</a>, in September 2001, the Australian government excised the Ashmore and Cartier Islands from the Australian migration zone.

Today, the Territory is administered from <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> by the <a href="Department%20of%20Infrastructure%20and%20Regional%20Development">Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development</a>, which is also responsible for the administration of the territories of <a href="Christmas%20Island">Christmas Island</a>, <a href="Cocos%20%28Keeling%29%20Islands">Cocos (Keeling) Islands</a>, the <a href="Coral%20Sea%20Islands">Coral Sea Islands</a>, <a href="Jervis%20Bay%20Territory">Jervis Bay Territory</a> and <a href="Norfolk%20Island">Norfolk Island</a>.

The <a href="Attorney-General%27s%20Department%20%28Australia%29">Attorney-General's Department</a> had been responsible for the administration of Australian territories until the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202010">2010 federal election</a>. In that year the responsibility for Australian territories was transferred to the then <a href="Department%20of%20Regional%20Australia%2C%20Local%20Government%2C%20Arts%20and%20Sport">Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport</a>, and from 18 September 2013 the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development has administered Australian territories.

Defence of Ashmore and Cartier Islands is the responsibility of Australia, with periodic visits by the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>, <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> and <a href="Australian%20Customs%20and%20Border%20Protection%20Service">Australian Customs and Border Protection Service</a>.

Nearby Hibernia Reef, northeast of Ashmore Reef, is not part of the Territory, but belongs to <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>. It has no permanently dry land area, although large parts of the reef become exposed during low tide.

The Ashmore Reef Commonwealth Marine Reserve (formerly Ashmore Reef National Nature Reserve), established in August 1983, comprises an area of approximately . It is of significant <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> value as it is in the flow of the <a href="Indonesian%20Throughflow">Indonesian Throughflow</a> ocean current from the Pacific Ocean through <a href="Maritime%20Southeast%20Asia">Maritime Southeast Asia</a> to the Indian Ocean. It is also in a surface current west from the <a href="Arafura%20Sea">Arafura Sea</a> and <a href="Timor%20Sea">Timor Sea</a>.

The Reserve comprises several marine habitats, including seagrass meadows, intertidal sand flats, coral reef flats, and lagoons, and supports an important and diverse range of species, including 14 species of <a href="sea%20snake">sea snake</a>s, a population of <a href="dugong">dugong</a> that may be genetically distinct, a diverse <a href="marine%20invertebrate">marine invertebrate</a> fauna, and many <a href="endemism">endemic</a> species, especially of sea snakes and <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s. There are feeding and nesting sites for <a href="Loggerhead%20Turtle">loggerhead</a>, <a href="Hawksbill%20turtle">hawksbill</a> and <a href="green%20turtle">green turtle</a>s. It is classified as an <a href="Important%20Bird%20Area">Important Bird Area</a> and has 50,000 breeding pairs of various kinds of <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s. A high abundance and diversity of <a href="sea%20cucumber">sea cucumber</a>s, <a href="over-exploitation">over-exploited</a> on other reefs in the region, is present, with 45 species recorded.

In 2003 the nature reserve was recognised as a wetland of international importance due to the importance of its islands providing a resting place for migratory shorebirds and supporting large seabird breeding colonies. It was designated Ramsar Site 1220 under the <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar Convention on Wetlands</a>.

The Cartier Island Commonwealth Marine Reserve (formerly Cartier Island Marine Reserve) was established in June 2000, and comprises an area of approximately , within a 4 nautical mile radius from the center of Cartier Island, and extends to a depth of below the sea floor. It includes the reef around Cartier island, a small submerged pinnacle called Wave Governor Bank, and two shallow pools to the island's northeast. The Reserve is part of the North-west Commonwealth Marine Reserve Network.

There is no economic activity in the Territory, Ashmore and Cartier Islands being uninhabited. Cartier Island is an unvegetated sand island. Access to Cartier Island is prohibited because of the risk of <a href="unexploded%20ordnance">unexploded ordnance</a>s. There are no ports or harbours, only offshore anchorage. The customs vessel <a href="ACV%20Ashmore%20Guardian">ACV "Ashmore Guardian"</a> is stationed off the reef for up to 330 days per year. The islands are also visited by seasonal caretakers and occasional scientific researchers.

The area has been a traditional fishing ground of Indonesian fishermen for centuries, and continues. In the 1850s, American whalers operated in the region. Mining of phosphate deposits took place on Ashmore Island in the latter half of the 19th century. Today, all the <a href="water%20well">well</a>s in the Territory are infected with <a href="cholera">cholera</a> or contaminated and <a href="potable%20water">undrinkable</a>.

Petroleum extraction activities take place at the <a href="Jabiru%20oil%20field">Jabiru</a> and <a href="Challis%20oil%20field">Challis oil field</a>s, which are adjacent to the Territory, and which are administered by the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy on behalf of the Commonwealth.

As Ashmore Reef is the closest point of Australian territory to Indonesia, it was a popular target for <a href="people%20smugglers">people smugglers</a> transporting <a href="asylum%20seekers">asylum seekers</a> en route to Australia. Once they had landed on Ashmore Island, asylum seekers could claim to have entered Australian migration zone and request to be processed as refugees. The use of Ashmore Island for this purpose created great notoriety during late 2001, when refugee arrivals became a major political issue in Australia. The Australian Government argued that as Australia was not the country of first asylum for these "<a href="boat%20people">boat people</a>", Australia did not have a responsibility to accept them.

A number of things were done to discourage the use of the Territory for this purpose, such as attempting to have the people smugglers arrested in Indonesia; the so-called <a href="Pacific%20Solution">Pacific Solution</a> of processing them in third countries; the boarding and forced turnaround of the boats by Australian military forces; and finally excising the Territory and many other small islands from the <a href="Australian%20migration%20zone">Australian migration zone</a>.

Two boatloads of asylum seekers were each detained for several days in the lagoon at Ashmore Island after failed attempts by the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> to turn them back to Indonesia in October 2001.

<doc id="1234" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1234" title="Acoustic theory">
Acoustic theory

Acoustic theory is a scientific field that relates to the description of <a href="Sound%23Longitudinal_and_transverse_waves">sound waves</a>. It derives from <a href="fluid%20dynamics">fluid dynamics</a>. See <a href="acoustics">acoustics</a> for the <a href="engineering">engineering</a> approach.

Propagation of sound waves in a fluid (such as water) can be modeled by an equation of continuity (conservation of <a href="mass">mass</a>) and an equation of motion (conservation of <a href="momentum">momentum</a>) . With some simplifications, in particular constant density, they can be given as follows:
where formula_2 is the acoustic pressure and formula_3 is the <a href="flow%20velocity">flow velocity</a> vector, formula_4 is the vector of spatial coordinates formula_5, formula_6 is the time, formula_7 is the static mass density of the medium and formula_8 is the <a href="bulk%20modulus">bulk modulus</a> of the medium. The bulk modulus can be expressed in terms of the density and the speed of sound in the medium (formula_9) as
If the flow velocity field is <a href="irrotational">irrotational</a>, formula_11, then the <a href="acoustic%20wave%20equation">acoustic wave equation</a> is a combination of these two sets of balance equations and can be expressed as
where we have used the <a href="vector%20Laplacian">vector Laplacian</a>, formula_13
The acoustic wave equation (and the mass and momentum balance equations) are often expressed in terms of a <a href="scalar%20potential">scalar potential</a> formula_14 where formula_15. In that case the acoustic wave equation is written as
and the momentum balance and mass balance are expressed as

The derivations of the above equations for waves in an acoustic medium are given below.

The equations for the <a href="Derivation%20of%20the%20Navier%E2%80%93Stokes%20equations%23General%20form%20of%20the%20Navier%E2%80%93Stokes%20equations">conservation of linear momentum</a> for a fluid medium are
where formula_19 is the body force per unit mass, formula_20 is the pressure, and formula_21 is the <a href="Cauchy%20stress%20tensor%23Stress%20deviator%20tensor">deviatoric stress</a>. If formula_22 is the <a href="Cauchy%20stress%20tensor">Cauchy stress</a>, then
where formula_24 is the rank-2 identity tensor.

We make several assumptions to derive the momentum balance equation for an acoustic medium. These assumptions and the resulting forms of the momentum equations are outlined below.

In acoustics, the fluid medium is assumed to be <a href="Newtonian%20fluid">Newtonian</a>. For a Newtonian fluid, the deviatoric stress tensor is related to the flow velocity by
where formula_26 is the shear <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a> and formula_27 is the <a href="bulk%20viscosity">bulk viscosity</a>.

Therefore, the divergence of formula_21 is given by
Using the identity formula_30, we have
The equations for the conservation of momentum may then be written as

For most acoustics problems we assume that the flow is irrotational, that is, the <a href="vorticity">vorticity</a> is zero. In that case
and the momentum equation reduces to

Another frequently made assumption is that effect of body forces on the fluid medium is negligible. The momentum equation then further simplifies to

Additionally, if we assume that there are no viscous forces in the medium (the bulk and shear viscosities are zero), the momentum equation takes the form

An important simplifying assumption for acoustic waves is that the amplitude of the disturbance of the field quantities is small. This assumption leads to the linear or small signal acoustic wave equation. Then we can express the variables as the sum of the (time averaged) mean field (formula_37) that varies in space and a small fluctuating field (formula_38) that varies in space and time. That is
and
Then the momentum equation can be expressed as
Since the fluctuations are assumed to be small, products of the fluctuation terms can be neglected (to first order) and we have

Next we assume that the medium is homogeneous; in the sense that the time averaged variables
formula_43 and formula_44 have zero gradients, i.e.,
The momentum equation then becomes

At this stage we assume that the medium is at rest, which implies that the mean flow velocity is zero, i.e., formula_47. Then the balance of momentum reduces to
Dropping the tildes and using formula_49, we get the commonly used form of the acoustic momentum equation

The equation for the <a href="Derivation%20of%20the%20Navier%E2%80%93Stokes%20equations%23Conservation%20of%20mass">conservation of mass</a> in a fluid volume (without any mass sources or sinks) is given by
where formula_52 is the mass density of the fluid and formula_53 is the flow velocity.

The equation for the conservation of mass for an acoustic medium can also be derived in a manner similar to that used for the conservation of momentum.

From the assumption of small disturbances we have
and
Then the mass balance equation can be written as
If we neglect higher than first order terms in the fluctuations, the mass balance equation becomes

Next we assume that the medium is homogeneous, i.e.,
Then the mass balance equation takes the form

At this stage we assume that the medium is at rest, i.e., formula_47. Then the mass balance equation can be expressed as

To close the system of equations we need an <a href="equation%20of%20state">equation of state</a> for the pressure. To do that we assume that the medium is an <a href="ideal%20gas">ideal gas</a> and all acoustic waves compress the medium in an <a href="adiabatic">adiabatic</a> and <a href="Reversible%20process%20%28thermodynamics%29">reversible</a> manner. The equation of state can then be expressed in the form of the differential equation:
where formula_63 is the <a href="specific%20heat">specific heat</a> at constant pressure, formula_64 is the <a href="specific%20heat">specific heat</a> at constant volume, and formula_65 is the wave speed. The value of formula_66 is 1.4 if the acoustic medium is air.

For small disturbances
where formula_9 is the <a href="speed%20of%20sound">speed of sound</a> in the medium.

Therefore,
The balance of mass can then be written as
Dropping the tildes and defining formula_71 gives us the commonly used expression for the balance of mass in an acoustic medium:

If we use a <a href="cylindrical%20coordinate%20system">cylindrical coordinate system</a> formula_73 with <a href="basis%20vectors">basis vectors</a> formula_74, then the <a href="gradient">gradient</a> of formula_20 and the <a href="divergence">divergence</a> of formula_76 are given by
where the <a href="flow%20velocity">flow velocity</a> has been expressed as formula_78.

The equations for the <a href="conservation%20of%20momentum">conservation of momentum</a> may then be written as
In terms of components, these three equations for the <a href="conservation%20of%20momentum">conservation of momentum</a> in <a href="cylindrical%20coordinates">cylindrical coordinates</a> are

The equation for the <a href="conservation%20of%20mass">conservation of mass</a> can similarly be written in <a href="cylindrical%20coordinates">cylindrical coordinates</a> as

The acoustic equations for the <a href="conservation%20of%20momentum">conservation of momentum</a> and the <a href="conservation%20of%20mass">conservation of mass</a> are often expressed in time <a href="harmonic">harmonic</a> form (at fixed <a href="frequency">frequency</a>). In that case, the pressures and the flow velocity are assumed to be time harmonic functions of the form
where formula_83 is the frequency. Substitution of these expressions into the governing equations in <a href="cylindrical%20coordinates">cylindrical coordinates</a> gives us the fixed frequency form of the <a href="conservation%20of%20momentum">conservation of momentum</a>
and the fixed frequency form of the <a href="conservation%20of%20mass">conservation of mass</a>

In the special case where the field quantities are independent of the z-coordinate we can eliminate formula_86 to get
Assuming that the solution of this equation can be written as
we can write the partial differential equation as
The left hand side is not a function of formula_90 while the right hand side is not a function of formula_91. Hence,
where formula_93 is a constant. Using the substitution
we have
The equation on the left is the <a href="Bessel%20equation">Bessel equation</a>, which has the general solution
where formula_97 is the cylindrical <a href="Bessel%20function">Bessel function</a> of the first kind and formula_98 are undetermined constants. The equation on the right has the general solution
where formula_100 are undetermined constants. Then the solution of the acoustic wave equation is
Boundary conditions are needed at this stage to determine formula_102 and the other undetermined constants.

Alexander Mackenzie (politician)

Alexander Mackenzie, <a href="Queen%27s%20Privy%20Council%20for%20Canada">PC</a> (January 28, 1822April 17, 1892), was a Canadian politician who served as the <a href="List%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Canada">second</a> <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister of Canada</a>, in office from 1873 to 1878.

Mackenzie was born in <a href="Logierait">Logierait</a>, <a href="Perthshire">Perthshire</a>, Scotland. He left school at the age of 13, following his father's death, and trained as a <a href="stonemason">stonemason</a>. Mackenzie immigrated to Canada when he was 20, settling in what became <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>. His masonry business prospered, allowing him to pursue other interests – such as the editorship of a pro-<a href="Reform%20movement%20%28pre-Confederation%20Canada%29">Reformist</a> newspaper. Mackenzie was elected to the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Province%20of%20Canada">Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada</a> in 1861, as a supporter of <a href="George%20Brown%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">George Brown</a>.

In 1867, Mackenzie was elected to the new <a href="Canadian%20House%20of%20Commons">Canadian House of Commons</a> for the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada">Liberal Party</a>. He became leader of the party (and thus <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28Canada%29">Leader of the Opposition</a>) in mid-1873, and a few months later succeeded <a href="John%20A.%20Macdonald">John A. Macdonald</a> as prime minister, following Macdonald's resignation in the aftermath of the <a href="Pacific%20Scandal">Pacific Scandal</a>. Mackenzie and the Liberals won a clear majority at the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201874">1874 election</a>. He was popular among the general public for his humble background and apparent democratic tendencies.

As prime minister, Mackenzie continued the nation-building programme that had been begun by his predecessor. His government established the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> and <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%20of%20Canada">Royal Military College of Canada</a>, and created the <a href="District%20of%20Keewatin">District of Keewatin</a> to better administer Canada's newly acquired western territories. However, it made little progress on the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">transcontinental railway</a>, and struggled to deal with the aftermath of the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a>. At the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201878">1878 election</a>, Mackenzie's government suffered a landslide defeat. He remained leader of the Liberal Party for another two years, and continued on as a member of parliament until his death.

Mackenzie was born on 28 January 1822 in <a href="Logierait">Logierait</a>, Perthshire, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, the son of Mary Stewart (Fleming) and Alexander Mackenzie Sr. who were married in 1817. The site of his birthplace is known as Clais-'n-deoir "The Hollow of the Weeping", where families said their goodbyes as the convicted were led to nearby Gallows Hill. The house he was born in was built by his father and is still standing in 2017. He was the third of ten boys, seven of who survived infancy. Alexander Mackenzie Sr. was a carpenter and ship's joiner who had to move around frequently for work after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. Mackenzie's father died on 7 March 1836 and at the age of thirteen Alexander Mackenzie Jr. was thus forced to end his formal education in order to help support his family. He apprenticed as a stonemason and met his future wife, Helen Neil, in Irvine, where her father was also a stonemason. The Neils were Baptist and shortly thereafter, Mackenzie converted from <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterianism</a> to <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> beliefs. Together with the Neils, he immigrated to Canada in 1842 to seek a better life. Mackenzie's faith was to link him to the increasingly influential <a href="temperance%20cause">temperance cause</a>, particularly strong in <a href="Canada%20West">Canada West</a> where he lived, a constituency of which he was to represent in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Canada">Parliament of Canada</a>.

The Neils and Mackenzie settled in Kingston, Ontario. The limestone in the area proved too hard for his stonemason tools and, not having money to buy new tools, Mackenzie took a job as a labourer constructing a building on Princess Street. The contractor on the job claimed financial difficulty and so Mackenzie accepted a promissory note for summer wages. The note later proved to be worthless. Subsequently, Mackenzie won a contract building a bomb-proof arch at <a href="Fort%20Henry%2C%20Ontario">Fort Henry</a>. He later became a foreman on the construction of Kingston's four <a href="Martello%20tower">Martello Towers</a> - <a href="%20Murney%20Tower"> Murney Tower</a>, <a href="Fort%20Frederick">Fort Frederick</a>, <a href="Cathcart%20Tower">Cathcart Tower</a>, and <a href="Shoal%20Tower">Shoal Tower</a>. He was also a foreman on the construction of the <a href="Welland%20Canal">Welland Canal</a> and the <a href="Lachine%20Canal">Lachine Canal</a>. While working on the <a href="Beauharnois%20Canal">Beauharnois Canal</a> a one ton stone fell and crushed one of his legs. He recovered but never regained the strength in that leg. It was while in Kingston that Mackenzie became a vocal opponent of religious and political entitlement and corruption in government. 

Mackenzie married Helen Neil (1826–52) in 1845 and with her had three children, with only one girl, Mary, surviving infancy. He and Helen moved to Sarnia, Ontario (known as Canada West) in 1847 and Mary was born in 1848. They were soon joined from Scotland by the rest of Mackenzie's brothers and his mother. He began working as a general contractor, earning a reputation for being a hard working, honest man as well as having a working man's view on fiscal policy. Mackenzie helped construct many courthouses and jails across southern Ontario. A number of these still stand today including the Sandwich Courthouse and Jail now known as the <a href="Windsor%2C%20Ontario">Mackenzie Hall Cultural Centre</a> in Windsor, Ontario and the <a href="Chatham%20Jail">Kent County Courthouse and Jail</a> in Chatham, Ontario. He even bid, unsuccessfully, on the construction of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa in 1859. Helen died in 1852, finally succumbing to the effects of excessive doses of mercury-based calomel used to treat a fever while in Kingston. In 1853, he married <a href="Jane%20Mackenzie">Jane Sym</a> (1825–93).

Mackenzie involved himself in politics almost from the moment he arrived in Canada. He fought passionately for equality and the elimination of all forms of class distinction. In 1851 he became the Secretary for the <a href="Reform%20movement%20%28pre-Confederation%20Canada%29">Reform Party</a> for Lambton. After convincing him to run in Kent/Lambton, Mackenzie campaigned relentlessly for <a href="George%20Brown%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">George Brown</a>, owner of the <a href="Reform%20movement%20%28pre-Confederation%20Canada%29">Reformist</a> paper "<a href="The%20Globe%20%28Toronto%20newspaper%29">The Globe</a>" in the 1851 election, helping Brown to win his first seat in the Legislative Assembly. Mackenzie and Brown remained the closest of friends and colleagues for the rest of their lives. In 1852 Mackenzie became editor of another reformist paper, the Lambton Shield. As editor, Mackenzie was perhaps a little too vocal, leading the paper to a lawsuit for libel against the local conservative candidate. Because a key witness claimed Cabinet Confidence and would not testify, the paper lost the suit and was forced to fold due to financial hardship. After his brother, Hope Mackenzie, declined to run, Alexander was petitioned to run and won his first seat in the Legislative Assembly as a supporter of George Brown in 1861. When George Brown resigned from the <a href="Great%20Coalition">Great Coalition</a> in 1865 over reciprocity negotiations with the United States, Mackenzie was invited to replace him as the President of the Council. Wary of <a href="John%20A.%20Macdonald">Macdonald's</a> motivations and true to his principles, Mackenzie declined. 

He entered the <a href="Canadian%20House%20of%20Commons">Canadian House of Commons</a> in 1867, representing the <a href="Lambton%20%28electoral%20district%29">Lambton</a>, Ontario, riding. There was no cohesive national <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada">Liberal Party of Canada</a> at the time and with <a href="George%20Brown%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">George Brown</a> not winning his seat, there was no official leader. Mackenzie did not believe he was the best qualified for the position and although he resisted offers of the position, he nevertheless sat as the de facto leader of the Official Opposition. 

When the <a href="John%20A.%20Macdonald">Macdonald</a> government fell due to the <a href="Pacific%20Scandal">Pacific Scandal</a> in 1873, the <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Dufferin%20and%20Ava">Lord Dufferin</a>, called upon Mackenzie, who had been chosen as the leader of the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada">Liberal Party</a> a few months earlier, to form a new government. Mackenzie formed a government and asked the Governor General to call an <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201874">election for January 1874</a>. The Liberals won, having garnered 53.8% of the popular vote. The voter support of 53.8% remains the record in <a href="Canada">Canada</a> for all federal elections. Mackenzie remained prime minister until the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201878">1878 election</a> when Macdonald's <a href="Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada%20%28historical%29">Conservatives</a> returned to power with a <a href="majority%20government">majority government</a>.

It was unusual for a man of Mackenzie's humble origins to attain such a position in an age which generally offered such opportunity only to the privileged. Lord Dufferin, the current Governor General, expressed early misgivings about a stonemason taking over government. But on meeting Mackenzie, Dufferin revised his opinions: "However narrow and inexperienced Mackenzie may be, I imagine he is a thoroughly upright, well-principled, and well-meaning man."

Mackenzie served concurrently as Minister of Public Works and oversaw the completion of the Parliament Buildings. While drawing up the plans for the <a href="West%20Block">West Block</a>, he included a circular staircase leading directly from his office to the outside of the building which allowed him to escape the patronage-seekers waiting for him in his ante-chamber. Proving Dufferin's reflections on his character to be true, Mackenzie disliked intensely the patronage inherent in politics. Nevertheless, he found it a necessary evil in order to maintain party unity and ensure the loyalty of his fellow Liberals.

As Prime Minister, Alexander Mackenzie strove to reform and simplify the machinery of government, achieving a remarkable record of reform legislation. He introduced the <a href="secret%20ballot">secret ballot</a>; advised the creation of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a>; the establishment of the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%20of%20Canada">Royal Military College of Canada</a> in <a href="Kingston%2C%20Ontario">Kingston</a> in 1874; and, the creation of the Office of the <a href="Auditor%20General%20of%20Canada">Auditor General</a> in 1878. He completed the <a href="Intercolonial%20Railway">Intercolonial Railway</a> but struggled to progress on the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">national railway</a> due to a worldwide economic depression, almost coming to blows with the then Governor General Lord Dufferin over imperial interference. Mackenzie stood up for the rights of Canada as a nation and fought for the supremacy of Parliament and honesty in government. Above all else, he was known and loved for his honesty and integrity. 

However, his term was marked by <a href="economic%20depression">economic depression</a> that had grown out of the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a>, which Mackenzie's government was unable to alleviate. In 1874, Mackenzie negotiated a new <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a> agreement with the United States, eliminating the high protective tariffs on Canadian goods in US markets. However, this action did not bolster the economy, and construction of the CPR slowed drastically due to lack of funding. In 1876 the Conservative opposition announced a <a href="National%20Policy">National Policy</a> of protective tariffs, which resonated with voters. When an <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201878">election</a> was held at the conclusion of Mackenzie's five-year term, the Conservatives were swept back into office in a landslide victory.

Mackenzie chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> by the <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General</a>:

After his government's defeat, Mackenzie remained <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28Canada%29">Leader of the Opposition</a> for another two years, until 1880. He was soon struck with a mysterious ailment that sapped his strength and all but took his voice. Sitting in silence, he nevertheless remained an undefeated MP until his death in 1892 from a stroke that resulted from hitting his head during a fall. He died in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> and was buried in Lakeview Cemetery in <a href="Sarnia">Sarnia</a>, Ontario.

In their 1999 study of the Prime Ministers of Canada, which included the results of a survey of Canadian historians, <a href="J.L.%20Granatstein">J.L. Granatstein</a> and <a href="Norman%20Hillmer">Norman Hillmer</a> found that Mackenzie was in the No. 11 place just after <a href="John%20Sparrow%20David%20Thompson">John Sparrow David Thompson</a>.

The following are named in honour of Alexander Mackenzie:

Ashoka

Ashoka (; ; died 232 BCE) was an <a href="List%20of%20Indian%20monarchs">Indian emperor</a> of the <a href="Maurya%20Empire">Maurya Dynasty</a>, who ruled almost all of the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> from to 232 BCE. He was the grandson of the founder of the Maurya Dynasty, <a href="Chandragupta%20Maurya">Chandragupta Maurya</a>, who had created one of the largest empires in ancient India and then, according to <a href="Jainism">Jain</a> sources, renounced it all to become a Jain monk. One of India's greatest emperors, Ashoka expanded Chandragupta's empire, and reigned over a realm that stretched from present-day <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> in the west to <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> in the east. It covered the entire Indian subcontinent except for parts of present-day <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>, <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> and <a href="Kerala">Kerala</a>. The empire's capital was <a href="Pataliputra">Pataliputra</a> (in <a href="Magadha">Magadha</a>, present-day <a href="Patna">Patna</a>), with provincial capitals at <a href="Taxila">Taxila</a> and <a href="Ujjain">Ujjain</a>.

In about 260 BCE, Ashoka waged a destructive war against the state of <a href="Kalinga%20%28historical%20kingdom%29">Kalinga</a> (modern <a href="Odisha">Odisha</a>). He conquered Kalinga, which none of his ancestors had done. Some scholars suggest he belonged to the <a href="Jainism">Jain</a> tradition, but it is generally accepted that he embraced <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>. Legends state he converted after witnessing the mass deaths of the <a href="Kalinga%20War">Kalinga War</a>, which he himself had waged out of a desire for conquest. "Ashoka reflected on the war in Kalinga, which reportedly had resulted in more than 100,000 deaths and 150,000 deportations, ending at around 200,000 deaths." Ashoka converted to Buddhism about 263 BCE. He is remembered for the Ashoka pillars and edicts, for sending Buddhist monks to <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> and <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>, and for establishing monuments marking several significant sites in the life of <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>.

Beyond the <a href="Edicts%20of%20Ashoka">Edicts of Ashoka</a>, biographical information about him relies on legends written centuries later, such as the 2nd-century CE "<a href="Ashokavadana">Ashokavadana</a>" (""Narrative of Ashoka"", a part of the "<a href="Divyavadana">Divyavadana</a>"), and in the Sri Lankan text "<a href="Mahavamsa">Mahavamsa</a>" (""Great Chronicle""). The emblem of the modern <a href="Republic%20of%20India">Republic of India</a> is an adaptation of the <a href="Lion%20Capital%20of%20Ashoka">Lion Capital of Ashoka</a>. Ashoka's name "" means "painless, without sorrow" in <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> (the <a href="a%20privativum">"a" privativum</a> and "śoka", "pain, distress"). In his <a href="Edicts%20of%20Ashoka">edicts</a>, he is referred to as ' (Pali ' or "the Beloved of the Gods"), and ' (Pali ' or "He who regards everyone with affection"). His fondness for his name's connection to the "<a href="Saraca%20asoca">Saraca asoca</a>" tree, or "Ashoka tree", is also referenced in the <a href="Ashokavadana">Ashokavadana</a>. <a href="H.G.%20Wells">H.G. Wells</a> wrote of Ashoka in his book "<a href="The%20Outline%20of%20History">The Outline of History</a>": "Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like, the name of Ashoka shines, and shines, almost alone, a star."

Ashoka was born to the <a href="Mauryan">Mauryan</a> emperor, <a href="Bindusara">Bindusara</a> and <a href="Subhadrang%C4%AB">Subhadrangī</a> (or Dharmā). He was the grandson of <a href="Chandragupta%20Maurya">Chandragupta Maurya</a>, founder of the Maurya dynasty. Broadly, Chandragupta was born in a humble family, abandoned, raised as a son by another family, then with the training and counsel of <a href="Chanakya">Chanakya</a> of "<a href="Arthashastra">Arthashastra</a>" fame ultimately built one of the largest empires in ancient India. Ashoka's grandfather Chandragupta renounced it all, and became a monk in the <a href="Jainism">Jain</a> tradition. According to Roman historian <a href="Appian">Appian</a>, Chandragupta had made a "marital alliance" with <a href="Seleucus%20I%20Nicator">Seleucus</a>; there is thus a possibility that Ashoka had a <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid</a> Greek grandmother. An Indian <a href="Puranic">Puranic</a> source, the <a href="Pratisargaparvan">Pratisarga Parva</a> of the <a href="Bhavishya%20Purana">Bhavishya Purana</a>, also described the marriage of Chandragupta with a Greek ("<a href="Yavana">Yavana</a>") princess, daughter of Seleucus.

The ancient Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain texts provide varying biographical accounts. The <a href="Avadana">Avadana</a> texts mention that his mother was queen Subhadrangī. According to the <a href="Ashokavadana">Ashokavadana</a>, she was the daughter of a Brahmin from the city of Champa. She gave him the name Ashoka, meaning "one without sorrow". The <a href="Divyavadana">"Divyāvadāna"</a> tells a similar story, but gives the name of the queen as Janapadakalyānī. Ashoka had several elder siblings, all of whom were his half-brothers from the other wives of his father Bindusara. Ashoka was given royal military training.

The Buddhist text "<a href="Divyavadana">Divyavadana</a>" describes Ashoka putting down a revolt due to activities of wicked ministers. This may have been an incident in <a href="Bindusara">Bindusara</a>'s times. <a href="Taranatha">Taranatha</a>'s account states that <a href="Chanakya">Chanakya</a>, Bindusara's chief advisor, destroyed the nobles and kings of 16 towns and made himself the master of all territory between the eastern and the western seas. Some historians consider this as an indication of Bindusara's conquest of the Deccan while others consider it as suppression of a revolt. Following this, Ashoka was stationed at <a href="Ujain">Ujain</a>, the capital of <a href="Malwa">Malwa</a>, as governor.

Bindusara's death in 272 BCE led to a war over succession. According to the "Divyavadana", Bindusara wanted his elder son <a href="Susima">Susima</a> to succeed him but Ashoka was supported by his father's ministers, who found Susima to be arrogant and disrespectful towards them. A minister named Radhagupta seems to have played an important role in Ashoka's rise to the throne. The Ashokavadana recounts Radhagupta's offering of an old royal elephant to Ashoka for him to ride to the Garden of the Gold Pavilion where King Bindusara would determine his successor. Ashoka later got rid of the legitimate heir to the throne by tricking him into entering a pit filled with live coals. Radhagupta, according to the Ashokavadana, would later be appointed prime minister by Ashoka once he had gained the throne. The "<a href="Dipavansa">Dipavansa</a>" and "<a href="Mahavansa">Mahavansa</a>" refer to Ashoka's killing 99 of his brothers, sparing only one, named <a href="Vitashoka">Vitashoka</a> or Tissa, although there is no clear proof about this incident (many such accounts are saturated with mythological elements). The <a href="coronation">coronation</a> happened in 269 BCE, four years after his succession to the throne.
Buddhist legends state that Ashoka was bad-tempered and of a wicked nature. He built <a href="Ashoka%27s%20Hell">Ashoka's Hell</a>, an elaborate <a href="torture%20chamber">torture chamber</a> described as a "Paradisal Hell" due to the contrast between its beautiful exterior and the acts carried out within by his appointed executioner, Girikaa. This earned him the name of "Chanda Ashoka" () meaning "Ashoka the Fierce" in Sanskrit. Professor Charles Drekmeier cautions that the Buddhist legends tend to dramatise the change that Buddhism brought in him, and therefore, exaggerate Ashoka's past wickedness and his piousness after the conversion.

Ascending the throne, Ashoka expanded his empire over the next eight years, from the present-day <a href="Assam">Assam</a> in the East to <a href="Balochistan">Balochistan</a> in the West; from the <a href="Pamir%20Knot">Pamir Knot</a> in Afghanistan in the north to the peninsula of southern India except for present day <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> and <a href="Kerala">Kerala</a> which were ruled by the three <a href="Sangam%20period">ancient</a> <a href="Tamil%20people">Tamil</a> kingdoms.

While the early part of Ashoka's reign was apparently quite bloodthirsty, he became a follower of the <a href="Buddha">Buddha</a>'s teachings after his conquest of <a href="Kalinga%20%28historical%20kingdom%29">Kalinga</a> on the east coast of India in the present-day states of <a href="Odisha">Odisha</a> and North Coastal <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>. Kalinga was a state that prided itself on its sovereignty and democracy. With its monarchical parliamentary democracy it was quite an exception in ancient Bharata where there existed the concept of <a href="Rajdharma">Rajdharma</a>. Rajdharma means the duty of the rulers, which was intrinsically entwined with the concept of bravery and dharma. The Kalinga War happened eight years after his coronation. From his 13th inscription, we come to know that the battle was a massive one and caused the deaths of more than 100,000 soldiers and many civilians who rose up in defence; over 150,000 were deported. When he was walking through the grounds of Kalinga after his conquest, rejoicing in his victory, he was moved by the number of bodies strewn there and the wails of the bereaved.

From the various sources that speak of his life, Ashoka is believed to have had five wives. They were named <a href="Devi%20%28Ashoka%27s%20wife%29">Devi</a> (or Vedisa-Mahadevi-Shakyakumari), the second queen, <a href="Karuvaki">Karuvaki</a>, <a href="Asandhimitra">Asandhimitra</a> (designated "" or "chief queen"), <a href="Padmavati%20%28wife%20of%20Ashoka%29">Padmavati</a>, and <a href="Tishyarakshita">Tishyarakshita</a>. He is similarly believed to have had four sons and two daughters: a son by Devi named Mahendra (<a href="Pali">Pali</a>: "Mahinda"), Tivara (son of Karuvaki), Kunala (son of <a href="Padmavati%20%28wife%20of%20Ashoka%29">Padmavati</a>, and Jalauka (mentioned in the <a href="Rajatarangini">Kashmir Chronicle</a>), a daughter of Devi named <a href="Sanghamitra">Sanghamitra</a> (<a href="Pali">Pali</a>: "Sanghamitta"), and another daughter named Charumati.

According to one version of the "<a href="Mahavamsa">Mahavamsa</a>", the Buddhist chronicle of <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, Ashoka, when he was heir-apparent and was journeying as Viceroy to <a href="Ujjain">Ujjain</a>, is said to have halted at <a href="Vidisha">Vidisha</a> (10 kilometers from <a href="Sanchi">Sanchi</a>), and there married the daughter of a local banker. She was called <a href="Devi%20%28wife%20of%20Ashoka%29">Devi</a> and later gave Ashoka two sons, Ujjeniya and <a href="Mahinda%20%28Buddhist%20monk%29">Mahendra</a>, and a daughter <a href="Sanghamitta">Sanghamitta</a>. After Ashoka's accession, Mahendra headed a Buddhist mission, sent probably under the auspices of the Emperor, to <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>.

Edict 13 on the <a href="Edicts%20of%20Ashoka">Edicts of Ashoka</a> Rock Inscriptions reflect the great remorse the king felt after observing the destruction of Kalinga:

His Majesty felt remorse on account of the conquest of Kalinga because, during the subjugation of a previously unconquered country, slaughter, death, and taking away captive of the people necessarily occur, whereas His Majesty feels profound sorrow and regret.

The edict goes on to address the even greater degree of sorrow and regret resulting from Ashoka's understanding that the friends and families of deceased would suffer greatly too.

Legend says that one day after the war was over, Ashoka ventured out to roam the city and all he could see were burnt houses and scattered corpses. The lethal war with Kalinga transformed the vengeful Emperor Ashoka to a stable and peaceful emperor and he became a patron of Buddhism. According to the prominent <a href="Indology">Indologist</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Llewellyn%20Basham">A. L. Basham</a>, Ashoka's personal religion became Buddhism, if not before, then certainly after the Kalinga war. However, according to Basham, the Dharma officially propagated by Ashoka was not Buddhism at all. Nevertheless, his patronage led to the expansion of Buddhism in the Mauryan empire and other kingdoms during his rule, and worldwide from about 250 BCE. Prominent in this cause were his son <a href="Mahinda%20%28buddhist%20monk%29">Mahinda</a> (Mahendra) and daughter <a href="Sanghamitra">Sanghamitra</a> (whose name means "friend of the Sangha"), who established Buddhism in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).

Ashoka ruled for an estimated 36 years and died in 232 BCE. Legend states that during his cremation, his body burned for seven days and nights. After his death, the Mauryan dynasty lasted just fifty more years until his empire stretched over almost all of the Indian subcontinent. Ashoka had many wives and children, but many of their names are lost to time. His chief consort ("agramahisi") for the majority of his reign was his wife, <a href="Asandhimitra">Asandhimitra</a>, who apparently bore him no children.

In his old age, he seems to have come under the spell of his youngest wife <a href="Tishyaraksha">Tishyaraksha</a>. It is said that she had got Ashoka's son <a href="Kunala">Kunala</a>, the regent in <a href="Taxila">Takshashila</a> and the heir presumptive to the throne, blinded by a wily stratagem. The official executioners spared Kunala and he became a wandering singer accompanied by his favourite wife <a href="Kanchanmala">Kanchanmala</a>. In <a href="Pataliputra">Pataliputra</a>, Ashoka heard Kunala's song, and realised that Kunala's misfortune may have been a punishment for some past sin of the emperor himself. He condemned Tishyaraksha to death, restoring Kunala to the court. In the Ashokavadana, Kunala is portrayed as forgiving Tishyaraksha, having obtained enlightenment through Buddhist practice. While he urges Ashoka to forgive her as well, Ashoka does not respond with the same forgiveness. Kunala was succeeded by his son, <a href="Samprati">Samprati</a>, who ruled for 50 years until his death.

The reign of Ashoka Maurya might have disappeared into history as the ages passed by, had he not left behind records of his reign. These records are in the form of sculpted pillars and rocks inscribed with a variety of actions and teachings he wished to be published under his name. The language used for inscription was in one of the <a href="Prakrit">Prakrit</a> "common" languages etched in a Brahmi script.

In the year 185 BCE, about fifty years after Ashoka's death, the last Maurya ruler, <a href="Brihadratha%20Maurya">Brihadratha</a>, was assassinated by the commander-in-chief of the Mauryan armed forces, <a href="Pushyamitra%20Shunga">Pushyamitra Shunga</a>, while he was taking the Guard of Honor of his forces. Pushyamitra Shunga founded the <a href="Shunga%20dynasty">Shunga dynasty</a> (185-75 BCE) and ruled just a fragmented part of the Mauryan Empire. Many of the northwestern territories of the Mauryan Empire (modern-day Afghanistan and Northern Pakistan) became the <a href="Indo-Greek%20Kingdom">Indo-Greek Kingdom</a>.

King Ashoka, the third monarch of the Indian Mauryan dynasty, is also considered as one of the most exemplary rulers who ever lived.

One of the more enduring legacies of Ashoka was the model that he provided for the relationship between Buddhism and the state. Emperor Ashoka was seen as a role model to leaders within the Buddhist community. He not only provided guidance and strength, but he also created personal relationships with his supporters. Throughout Theravada Southeastern Asia, the model of rulership embodied by Ashoka replaced the notion of divine kingship that had previously dominated (in the <a href="Angkor">Angkor</a> kingdom, for instance). Under this model of 'Buddhist kingship', the king sought to legitimise his rule not through descent from a divine source, but by supporting and earning the approval of the Buddhist "<a href="Sangha%20%28Buddhism%29">sangha</a>". Following Ashoka's example, kings established monasteries, funded the construction of stupas, and supported the ordination of monks in their kingdom. Many rulers also took an active role in resolving disputes over the status and regulation of the sangha, as Ashoka had in calling a conclave to settle a number of contentious issues during his reign. This development ultimately led to a close association in many Southeast Asian countries between the monarchy and the religious hierarchy, an association that can still be seen today in the state-supported <a href="Buddhism%20in%20Thailand">Buddhism of Thailand</a> and the traditional role of the Thai king as both a religious and secular leader. Ashoka also said that all his courtiers always governed the people in a moral manner.

According to the legends mentioned in the 2nd-century CE text "<a href="Ashokavadana">Ashokavadana</a>", Ashoka was not non-violent after adopting Buddhism. In one instance, a non-Buddhist in <a href="Pundravardhana">Pundravardhana</a> drew a picture showing the Buddha bowing at the feet of <a href="Nirgrantha%20Jnatiputra">Nirgrantha Jnatiputra</a> (identified with <a href="Mahavira">Mahavira</a>, 24th Tirthankara of <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>). On complaint from a Buddhist devotee, Ashoka issued an order to arrest him, and subsequently, another order to kill all the <a href="Ajivika">Ajivika</a>s in Pundravardhana. Around 18,000 followers of the Ajivika sect were executed as a result of this order. Sometime later, another Nirgrantha follower in <a href="Pataliputra">Pataliputra</a> drew a similar picture. Ashoka burnt him and his entire family alive in their house. He also announced an award of one <a href="denarius">dinara</a> (silver coin) to anyone who brought him the head of a Nirgrantha heretic. According to "Ashokavadana", as a result of this order, his own brother was mistaken for a heretic and killed by a cowherd. However, for several reasons, scholars say, these stories of persecutions of rival sects by Ashoka appear to be clear fabrications arising out of sectarian propaganda.

Ashoka was almost forgotten by the historians of the early British India, but <a href="James%20Prinsep">James Prinsep</a> contributed in the revelation of historical sources. Another important historian was British <a href="archaeologist">archaeologist</a> <a href="John%20Hubert%20Marshall">John Hubert Marshall</a>, who was director-General of the <a href="Archaeological%20Survey%20of%20India">Archaeological Survey of India</a>. His main interests were <a href="Sanchi">Sanchi</a> and <a href="Sarnath">Sarnath</a>, in addition to <a href="Harappa">Harappa</a> and <a href="Mohenjo-daro">Mohenjodaro</a>. Sir <a href="Alexander%20Cunningham">Alexander Cunningham</a>, a British archaeologist and army engineer, and often known as the father of the <a href="Archaeological%20Survey%20of%20India">Archaeological Survey of India</a>, unveiled heritage sites like the <a href="Bharhut">Bharhut</a> Stupa, Sarnath, Sanchi, and the Mahabodhi Temple. <a href="Mortimer%20Wheeler">Mortimer Wheeler</a>, a British archaeologist, also exposed Ashokan historical sources, especially the <a href="Taxila">Taxila</a>.
Information about the life and reign of Ashoka primarily comes from a relatively small number of Buddhist sources. In particular, the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> "<a href="Ashokavadana">Ashokavadana</a>" ('Story of Ashoka'), written in the 2nd century, and the two <a href="P%C4%81li">Pāli</a> chronicles of Sri Lanka (the <a href="Dipavamsa">Dipavamsa</a> and "<a href="Mahavamsa">Mahavamsa</a>") provide most of the currently known information about Ashoka. Additional information is contributed by the <a href="Edicts%20of%20Ashoka">Edicts of Ashoka</a>, whose authorship was finally attributed to the Ashoka of Buddhist legend after the discovery of dynastic lists that gave the name used in the edicts ("Priyadarshi"—'He who regards everyone with affection') as a title or additional name of Ashoka Maurya. Architectural remains of his period have been found at <a href="Kumhrar">Kumhrar</a>, <a href="Patna">Patna</a>, which include an <a href="Kumhrar%23Assembly%20Hall%20of%2080-pillars">80-pillar hypostyle hall</a>.

<a href="Edicts%20of%20Ashoka">Edicts of Ashoka</a> -The Edicts of Ashoka are a collection of 33 inscriptions on the <a href="Pillars%20of%20Ashoka">Pillars of Ashoka</a>, as well as boulders and cave walls, made by Ashoka during his reign. These inscriptions are dispersed throughout modern-day Pakistan and India, and represent the first tangible evidence of Buddhism. The edicts describe in detail the first wide expansion of Buddhism through the sponsorship of one of the most powerful kings of Indian history, offering more information about Ashoka's proselytism, moral precepts, religious precepts, and his notions of social and animal welfare.

<a href="Ashokavadana">Ashokavadana</a> – The "Aśokāvadāna" is a 2nd-century CE text related to the legend of Ashoka. The legend was translated into Chinese by <a href="Fa%20Hien">Fa Hien</a> in 300 CE. It is essentially a Hinayana text, and its world is that of Mathura and North-west India. The emphasis of this little known text is on exploring the relationship between the king and the community of monks (the <a href="Sangha%20%28Buddhism%29">Sangha</a>) and setting up an ideal of religious life for the <a href="laity">laity</a> (the common man) by telling appealing stories about religious exploits. The most startling feature is that Ashoka’s conversion has nothing to do with the Kalinga war, which is not even mentioned, nor is there a word about his belonging to the Maurya dynasty. Equally surprising is the record of his use of state power to spread Buddhism in an uncompromising fashion. The legend of Veetashoka provides insights into Ashoka’s character that are not available in the widely known Pali records.

"<a href="Mahavamsa">Mahavamsa</a>" -The "Mahavamsa" ("Great Chronicle") is a historical poem written in the <a href="Pali">Pali</a> language of the kings of Sri Lanka. It covers the period from the coming of King Vijaya of <a href="Kalinga%20%28historical%20kingdom%29">Kalinga</a> (ancient Odisha) in 543 BCE to the reign of King Mahasena (334–361). As it often refers to the royal dynasties of India, the "Mahavamsa" is also valuable for historians who wish to date and relate contemporary royal dynasties in the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>. It is very important in dating the consecration of Ashoka.

<a href="Dipavamsa">Dwipavamsa</a> -The Dwipavamsa, or "Dweepavamsa", (i.e., Chronicle of the Island, in Pali) is the oldest historical record of Sri Lanka. The chronicle is believed to be compiled from <a href="Atthakatha">Atthakatha</a> and other sources around the 3rd or 4th century CE. King Dhatusena (4th century) had ordered that the Dipavamsa be recited at the <a href="Mahinda%20%28buddhist%20monk%29">Mahinda</a> festival held annually in Anuradhapura.

The <a href="caduceus">caduceus</a> appears as a symbol of the <a href="punch-marked%20coins">punch-marked coins</a> of the <a href="Maurya%20Empire">Maurya Empire</a> in India, in the 3rd-2nd century BCE. Numismatic research suggests that this symbol was the symbol of king Ashoka, his personal "<a href="Mudra">Mudra</a>". This symbol was not used on the pre-Mauryan punch-marked coins, but only on coins of the Maurya period, together with the <a href="arched-hill%20symbol">three arched-hill symbol</a>, the "peacock on the hill", the <a href="triskelis">triskelis</a> and the <a href="Taxila">Taxila</a> mark.

The use of Buddhist sources in reconstructing the life of Ashoka has had a strong influence on perceptions of Ashoka, as well as the interpretations of his Edicts. Building on traditional accounts, early scholars regarded Ashoka as a primarily Buddhist monarch who underwent a conversion to Buddhism and was actively engaged in sponsoring and supporting the Buddhist monastic institution. Some scholars have tended to question this assessment. Romila Thappar writes about Ashoka that "We need to see him both as a statesman in the context of inheriting and sustaining an empire in a particular historical period, and as a person with a strong commitment to changing society through what might be called the propagation of social ethics." The only source of information not attributable to Buddhist sources are the Ashokan Edicts, and these do not explicitly state that Ashoka was a Buddhist. In his edicts, Ashoka expresses support for all the major religions of his time: <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="Vedic%20Brahmanism">Brahmanism</a>, <a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>, and <a href="Ajivika">Ajivika</a>ism, and his edicts addressed to the population at large (there are some addressed specifically to Buddhists; this is not the case for the other religions) generally focus on moral themes members of all the religions would accept. For example, Amartya Sen writes, "The Indian Emperor Ashoka in the third century BCE presented many political inscriptions in favor of tolerance and individual freedom, both as a part of state policy and in the relation of different people to each other".

However, the edicts alone strongly that he was a Buddhist. In one edict he belittles rituals, and he banned Vedic animal sacrifices; these strongly suggest that he at least did not look to the Vedic tradition for guidance. Furthermore, many edicts are expressed to Buddhists alone; in one, Ashoka declares himself to be an "<a href="upasaka">upasaka</a>", and in another he demonstrates a close familiarity with Buddhist texts. He erected rock pillars at Buddhist holy sites, but did not do so for the sites of other religions. He also used the word <a href="Dharma%20%28Buddhism%29">"dhamma"</a> to refer to qualities of the heart that underlie moral action; this was an exclusively Buddhist use of the word. However, he used the word more in the spirit than as a strict code of conduct. Romila Thappar writes, "His dhamma did not derive from divine inspiration, even if its observance promised heaven. It was more in keeping with the ethic conditioned by the logic of given situations. His logic of Dhamma was intended to influence the conduct of categories of people, in relation to each other. Especially where they involved unequal relationships." Finally, he promotes ideals that correspond to the first three steps of the Buddha's graduated discourse.

Interestingly, the Ashokavadana presents an alternate view of the familiar Ashoka; one in which his conversion has nothing to do with the Kalinga war or about his descent from the Maurya dynasty. Instead, Ashoka's reason for adopting non-violence appears much more personal. The Ashokavadana shows that the main source of Ashoka's conversion and the acts of welfare that followed are rooted instead in intense personal anguish at its core, from a wellspring inside himself rather than spurred by a specific event. It thereby illuminates Ashoka as more humanly ambitious and passionate, with both greatness and flaws. "This" Ashoka is very different from the "shadowy do-gooder" of later Pali chronicles.

Much of the knowledge about Ashoka comes from the <a href="Edicts%20of%20Ashoka">several inscriptions</a> that he had carved on pillars and rocks throughout the empire. All his inscriptions present him as compassionate and loving. In the Kalinga rock edits, he addresses his people as his "children" and mentions that as a father he desires their good. These inscriptions promoted Buddhist morality and encouraged nonviolence and adherence to <a href="dharma">dharma</a> (duty or proper behaviour), and they talk of his fame and conquered lands as well as the neighbouring kingdoms holding up his might. One also gets some primary information about the Kalinga War and Ashoka's allies plus some useful knowledge on the civil administration. The Ashoka Pillar at <a href="Sarnath">Sarnath</a> is the most notable of the relics left by Ashoka. Made of sandstone, this pillar records the visit of the emperor to Sarnath, in the 3rd century BCE. It has a four-lion capital (four lions standing back to back), which was adopted as the emblem of the modern Indian republic. The lion symbolises both Ashoka's imperial rule and the kingship of the <a href="Buddha">Buddha</a>. In translating these monuments, historians learn the bulk of what is assumed to have been true fact of the Mauryan Empire. It is difficult to determine whether or not some events ever actually happened, but the stone etchings clearly depict how Ashoka wanted to be thought of and remembered.

Recently scholarly analysis determined that the three major foci of debate regarding Ashoka involve the nature of the Maurya empire; the extent and impact of Ashoka's pacifism; and what is referred to in the Inscriptions as "dhamma" or <a href="dharma">dharma</a>, which connotes goodness, virtue, and charity. Some historians have argued that Ashoka's pacifism undermined the "military backbone" of the Maurya empire, while others have suggested that the extent and impact of his pacifism have been "grossly exaggerated". The "dhamma" of the Edicts has been understood as concurrently a Buddhist lay ethic, a set of politico-moral ideas, a "sort of universal religion", or as an Ashokan innovation. On the other hand, it has also been interpreted as an "essentially political" ideology that sought to knit together a vast and diverse empire. Scholars are still attempting to analyse both the expressed and implied political ideas of the Edicts (particularly in regard to imperial vision), and make inferences pertaining to how that vision was grappling with problems and political realities of a "virtually subcontinental, and culturally and economically highly variegated, 3rd century BCE Indian empire. Nonetheless, it remains clear that Ashoka's Inscriptions represent the earliest corpus of royal inscriptions in the Indian subcontinent, and therefore prove to be a very important innovation in royal practices."

Until the Ashokan inscriptions were discovered and deciphered, stories about Ashoka were based on the legendary accounts of his life and not strictly on historical facts. These legends were found in Buddhist textual sources such as the text of "Ashokavadana". The "Ashokavadana" is a subset of a larger set of legends in the "Divyavadana", though it could have existed independently as well. Following are some of the legends narrated in the "Ashokavadana" about Ashoka:

1) One of the stories talks about an event that occurred in a past life of Ashoka, when he was a small child named Jaya. Once when Jaya was playing on the roadside, the Buddha came by. The young child put a handful of earth in the Buddha’s begging bowl as his gift to the saint and declared his wish to one day become a great emperor and follower of the Buddha. The Buddha is said to have smiled a smile that “illuminated the universe with its rays of light”. These rays of light are then said to have re-entered the Buddha’s left palm, signifying that this child Jaya would, in his next life, become a great emperor. The Buddha is said to have even turned to his disciple Ananda and is said to have predicted that this child would be “a great, righteous chakravarti king, who would rule his empire from his capital at Pataliputra”.

2) Another story aims to portray Ashoka as an evil person in order to convey the importance of his transformation into a good person upon adopting Buddhism. It begins by stating that due to Ashoka’s physical ugliness he was disliked by his father Bindusara. Ashoka wanted to become king and so he got rid of the heir by tricking him into entering a pit filled with live coals. He became famous as “Ashoka the Fierce” because of his wicked nature and bad temper. He is said to have subjected his ministers to a test of loyalty and then have 500 of them killed for failing it. He is said to have burnt his entire harem to death when certain women insulted him. He is supposed to have derived sadistic pleasure from watching other people suffer. And for this he built himself an elaborate and horrific torture chamber where he amused himself by torturing other people. The story then goes on to narrate how it was only after an encounter with a pious Buddhist monk that Ashoka himself transformed into “Ashoka the pious”. A Chinese traveler who visited India in the 7th century CE, XuanZang recorded in his memoirs that he visited the place where the supposed torture chamber stood.

3) Another story is about events that occurred towards the end of Ashoka’s time on earth. Ashoka is said to have started gifting away the contents of his treasury to the Buddhist "sangha". His ministers however were scared that his eccentricity would be the downfall of the empire and so denied him access to the treasury. As a result, Ashoka started giving away his personal possessions and was eventually left with nothing and so died peacefully.

At this point it is important to note that the "Ashokavadana" being a Buddhist text in itself sought to gain new converts for Buddhism and so used all these legends. Devotion to the Buddha and loyalty to the "sangha" are stressed. Such texts added to the perception that Ashoka was essentially the ideal Buddhist monarch who deserved both admiration and emulation.

According to Buddhist legend, particularly the <a href="Mahaparinirvana">Mahaparinirvana</a>, the relics of the Buddha had been shared among eight countries following his death. Ashoka endeavoured to take back the relics and share them among 84.000 stupas. This story is amply depicted in the reliefs of <a href="Sanchi">Sanchi</a> and <a href="Bharhut">Bharhut</a>. According to the legend, Ashoka obtain the ashes from seven of countries, but failed to take the ashes from the <a href="N%C4%81ga">Nagas</a> at <a href="Ramagrama">Ramagrama</a>, who were able to keep them. This scene is depicted on the tranversal portion of the southern gateway at Sanchi.

According to Indian historian Romila Thapar, Ashoka emphasized respect for all religious teachers, and harmonious relationship between parents and children, teachers and pupils, and employers and employees. Ashoka's religion contained gleanings from all religions. He emphasized the virtues of "Ahimsa", respect to all religious teachers, equal respect for and study of each other's scriptures, and rational faith.

As a <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> emperor, Ashoka believed that <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> is beneficial for all human beings as well as animals and plants, so he built a number of <a href="stupas">stupas</a>, <a href="Sangharama">Sangharama</a>, <a href="viharas">viharas</a>, <a href="chaitya">chaitya</a>, and residences for Buddhist monks all over South Asia and Central Asia. According to the Ashokavadana, he ordered the construction of 84,000 stupas to house the Buddha's relics. In the Aryamanjusrimulakalpa, Ashoka takes offerings to each of these stupas traveling in a chariot adorned with precious metals. He gave donations to viharas and <a href="matha">matha</a>s. He sent his only daughter <a href="Sanghamitra">Sanghamitra</a> and son <a href="Mahinda%20%28buddhist%20monk%29">Mahindra</a> to spread Buddhism in Sri Lanka (then known as Tamraparni).

According to the "<a href="Mahavamsa">Mahavamsa</a>", in the 17th year of Ashoka's reign, at the end of the <a href="Third%20Buddhist%20Council">Third Buddhist Council</a>, Ashoka sent Buddhist missionaries to nine parts of the world to propagate Buddhism.
Ashoka also invited Buddhists and non-Buddhists for religious conferences. He inspired the Buddhist monks to compose the sacred religious texts, and also gave all types of help to that end. Ashoka also helped to develop viharas (intellectual hubs) such as <a href="Nalanda">Nalanda</a> and <a href="Taxila">Taxila</a>. Ashoka helped to construct <a href="Sanchi">Sanchi</a> and <a href="Mahabodhi%20Temple">Mahabodhi Temple</a>. Ashoka also gave donations to non-Buddhists. As his reign continued his even-handedness was replaced with special inclination towards Buddhism. Ashoka helped and respected both Shramanas (Buddhists monks) and Brahmins (Vedic monks). Ashoka also helped to organise the <a href="Third%20Buddhist%20council">Third Buddhist council</a> () at Pataliputra (today's <a href="Patna">Patna</a>). It was conducted by the monk <a href="Moggaliputta-Tissa">Moggaliputta-Tissa</a> who was the spiritual teacher of Ashoka.

Emperor Ashoka's son, Mahinda, also helped with the spread of Buddhism by translating the Buddhist Canon into a language that could be understood by the people of Sri Lanka.

It is well known that Ashoka sent "dütas" or emissaries to convey messages or letters, written or oral (rather both), to various people. The VIth Rock Edict about "oral orders" reveals this. It was later confirmed that it was not unusual to add oral messages to written ones, and the content of Ashoka's messages can be inferred likewise from the XIIIth Rock Edict: They were meant to spread his "dhammavijaya," which he considered the highest victory and which he wished to propagate everywhere (including far beyond India). There is obvious and undeniable trace of cultural contact through the adoption of the <a href="Kharosthi">Kharosthi</a> script, and the idea of installing inscriptions might have travelled with this script, as <a href="Achaemenid">Achaemenid</a> influence is seen in some of the formulations used by Ashoka in his inscriptions. This indicates to us that Ashoka was indeed in contact with other cultures, and was an active part in mingling and spreading new cultural ideas beyond his own immediate walls.

In his edicts, Ashoka mentions some of the people living in <a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenic countries</a> as converts to Buddhism and recipients of his envoys, although no Hellenic historical record of this event remains:

It is not too far-fetched to imagine, however, that Ashoka received letters from Greek rulers and was acquainted with the Hellenistic royal orders in the same way as he perhaps knew of the inscriptions of the Achaemenid kings, given the presence of ambassadors of Hellenistic kings in India (as well as the "dütas" sent by Ashoka himself). <a href="Dionysius%20%28ambassador%29">Dionysius</a> is reported to have been such a Greek ambassador at the court of Ashoka, sent by <a href="Ptolemy%20II%20Philadelphus">Ptolemy II Philadelphus</a>, who himself is mentioned in the <a href="Edicts%20of%20Ashoka">Edicts of Ashoka</a> as a recipient of the Buddhist proselytism of Ashoka. Some Hellenistic philosophers, such as <a href="Hegesias%20of%20Cyrene">Hegesias of Cyrene</a>, who probably lived under the rule of King <a href="Magas%20of%20Cyrene">Magas</a>, one of the supposed recipients of Buddhist emissaries from Asoka, are sometimes thought to have been influenced by Buddhist teachings.

The Greeks in India even seem to have played an active role in the propagation of Buddhism, as some of the emissaries of Ashoka, such as <a href="Dharmaraksita">Dharmaraksita</a>, are described in <a href="P%C4%81li">Pali</a> sources as leading Greek (<a href="Yona">Yona</a>) Buddhist monks, active in spreading Buddhism (the "<a href="Mahavamsa">Mahavamsa</a>", XII).

Some Greeks (Yavana) may have played an administrative role in the territories ruled by Ashoka. The Girnar inscription of <a href="Rudradaman">Rudradaman</a> records that during the rule of Ashoka, a <a href="Yavana">Yavana</a> Governor was in charge in the area of <a href="Girnar">Girnar</a>, <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>, mentioning his role in the construction of a water reservoir.

Ashoka's military power was strong, but after his conversion to Buddhism, he maintained friendly relations with three major <a href="Tamil%20people">Tamil</a> kingdoms in the South—namely, <a href="Chera%20dynasty">Cheras</a>, <a href="Cholas">Cholas</a> and <a href="Pandyas">Pandyas</a>—the post-Alexandrian empire, <a href="Tamraparni">Tamraparni</a>, and <a href="Suvarnabhumi">Suvarnabhumi</a>. His <a href="Ashoka%27s%20Major%20Rock%20Edict">edicts</a> state that he made provisions for medical treatment of humans and animals in his own kingdom as well as in these neighbouring states. He also had wells dug and trees planted along the roads for the benefit of the common people.

Ashoka's rock edicts declare that injuring living things is not good, and no animal should be sacrificed for slaughter. However, he did not prohibit common cattle slaughter or beef eating.

He imposed a ban on killing of "all four-footed creatures that are neither useful nor edible", and of specific animal species including several birds, certain types of fish and bulls among others. He also banned killing of female goats, sheep and pigs that were nursing their young; as well as their young up to the age of six months. He also banned killing of all fish and <a href="neutering">castration</a> of animals during certain periods such as <a href="Chaturmasa">Chaturmasa</a> and <a href="Uposatha">Uposatha</a>.

Ashoka also abolished the royal hunting of animals and restricted the slaying of animals for food in the royal residence. Because he banned hunting, created many veterinary clinics and eliminated meat eating on many holidays, the Mauryan Empire under Ashoka has been described as "one of the very few instances in world history of a government treating its animals as citizens who are as deserving of its protection as the human residents".

The <a href="Ashoka%20Chakra">Ashoka Chakra</a> (the wheel of Ashoka) is a depiction of the <a href="Dharmachakra">Dharmachakra</a> (the Wheel of Dharma). The wheel has 24 spokes which represent the 12 Laws of Dependent Origination and the 12 Laws of Dependent Termination. The Ashoka Chakra has been widely inscribed on many relics of the <a href="Mauryan">Mauryan</a> Emperor, most prominent among which is the Lion Capital of <a href="Sarnath">Sarnath</a> and The <a href="Ashoka%20Pillar">Ashoka Pillar</a>. The most visible use of the Ashoka Chakra today is at the centre of the National flag of the Republic of India (adopted on 22 July 1947), where it is rendered in a Navy-blue color on a White background, by replacing the symbol of Charkha (<a href="Spinning%20wheel">Spinning wheel</a>) of the pre-independence versions of the flag. The Ashoka Chakra can also been seen on the base of the Lion Capital of Ashoka which has been adopted as the National Emblem of India.

The Ashoka Chakra was created by Ashoka during his reign. <a href="Chakra">Chakra</a> is a <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> word which also means "cycle" or "self-repeating process". The process it signifies is the cycle of time—as in how the world changes with time.

A few days before India became independent in August 1947, the specially-formed <a href="Constituent%20Assembly">Constituent Assembly</a> decided that the <a href="flag%20of%20India">flag of India</a> must be acceptable to all parties and communities. A flag with three colours, Saffron, White and Green with the Ashoka Chakra was selected.

Ashoka is often credited with the beginning of stone architecture in India, possibly following the introduction of stone-building techniques by the <a href="Greco-Bactrian">Greeks after Alexander the Great</a>. Before Ashoka's time, buildings were probably built in non-permanent material, such as wood, <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a> or <a href="thatch">thatch</a>. Ashoka may have rebuilt his palace in <a href="Pataliputra">Pataliputra</a> by replacing wooden material by stone, and may also have used the help of foreign craftmen. Ashoka also innovated by using the permament qualities of stone for his written <a href="Edicts%20of%20Ashoka">edicts</a>, as well as his pillars with Buddhist symbolism.

The pillars of Ashoka are a series of columns dispersed throughout the northern Indian subcontinent, and erected by Ashoka during his reign in the 3rd century BCE. Originally, there must have been many pillars of Ashoka although only ten with inscriptions still survive. Averaging between forty and fifty feet in height, and weighing up to fifty tons each, all the pillars were quarried at Chunar, just south of Varanasi and dragged, sometimes hundreds of miles, to where they were erected. The first Pillar of Ashoka was found in the 16th century by Thomas Coryat in the ruins of ancient Delhi. The wheel represents the sun time and Buddhist law, while the <a href="swastika">swastika</a> stands for the cosmic dance around a fixed center and guards against evil.

The Lion capital of Ashoka is a sculpture of four lions standing back to back. It was originally placed atop the Ashoka pillar at <a href="Sarnath">Sarnath</a>, now in the state of <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>, India. The pillar, sometimes called the Ashoka Column, is still in its original location, but the Lion Capital is now in the <a href="Sarnath%20Museum">Sarnath Museum</a>. This Lion Capital of Ashoka from Sarnath has been adopted as the <a href="State%20Emblem%20of%20India">National Emblem of India</a> and the wheel ("<a href="Ashoka%20Chakra">Ashoka Chakra</a>") from its base was placed onto the center of the <a href="National%20Flag%20of%20India">National Flag of India</a>.

The capital contains four lions (Indian / Asiatic Lions), standing back to back, mounted on a short cylindrical abacus, with a frieze carrying sculptures in high relief of an elephant, a galloping horse, a bull, and a lion, separated by intervening spoked chariot-wheels over a bell-shaped lotus. Carved out of a single block of polished sandstone, the capital was believed to be crowned by a 'Wheel of Dharma' (Dharmachakra popularly known in India as the "Ashoka Chakra"). The Sarnath pillar bears one of the Edicts of Ashoka, an inscription against division within the Buddhist community, which reads, "No one shall cause division in the order of monks."

The four animals in the Sarnath capital are believed to symbolise different steps of Lord <a href="Buddha">Buddha</a>'s life.

Besides the religious interpretations, there are some non-religious interpretations also about the symbolism of the Ashoka capital pillar at Sarnath. According to them, the four lions symbolise Ashoka's rule over the four directions, the wheels as symbols of his enlightened rule (Chakravartin) and the four animals as symbols of four adjoining territories of India.

The British restoration was done under guidance from <a href="Weligama%20Sri%20Sumangala">Weligama Sri Sumangala</a>.

American (word)

The meaning of the word American in the English language varies according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used. "American" is derived from "America", a term originally denoting all of the <a href="New%20World">New World</a> (also called "the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>"). In some expressions, it retains this Pan-American sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the <a href="United%20States%20of%20America">United States of America</a>.

In modern English, "<a href="Americans">Americans</a>" generally refers to persons or things related to the United States of America; among native English speakers this usage is almost universal, with any other use of the term requiring specification. However, this usage is seen by some as a semantic "misappropriation" by those who argue that "American" <a href="Linguistic%20prescription">should be widened</a> in English <a href="semantic%20change">to also include</a> people or things from anywhere in the American continents.

The word can be used as either an <a href="adjective">adjective</a> or a <a href="noun">noun</a> (viz. a <a href="demonym">demonym</a>). In adjectival use, it means "of or relating to the United States"; for example, "<a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a> was an American singer" or "the man prefers <a href="American%20English">American English</a>". In its noun form, the word generally means a <a href="demographics%20of%20the%20US">resident</a> or <a href="United%20States%20nationality%20law">citizen</a> of the US, or occasionally <a href="American%20ethnicity">someone whose ethnic identity is simply "American"</a>. The noun is rarely used in <a href="American%20English">American English</a> to refer to people not connected to the United States. When used with a <a href="Grammatical%20modifier">grammatical qualifier</a>, the adjective "American" can mean "of or relating to the Americas", as in <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>n or <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Indigenous American</a>. Less frequently, the adjective can take this meaning without a qualifier, as in "<a href="Spanish%20dialects%20and%20varieties">American Spanish</a> dialects and pronunciation differ by country", or the name of the <a href="Organization%20of%20American%20States">Organization of American States</a>. A third use of the term pertains specifically to the <a href="indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">indigenous peoples of the Americas</a>, for instance, "In the 16th century, many Americans died from imported diseases during the European conquest".

Compound constructions such as "<a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a>" likewise refer exclusively to people in or from the United States of America, as does the <a href="prefix">prefix</a> "<a href="%3Awiktionary%3AAmerico-">Americo-</a>". For instance, the <a href="Americo-Liberians">Americo-Liberians</a> and their language <a href="Merico%20language">Merico</a> derive their name from the fact that they are <a href="African-American%20settlement%20in%20Africa">descended from African American settlers</a>, i.e. former slaves in the United States of America.

<a href="French%20language">French</a>, <a href="German%20language">German</a>, <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>, <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a>, <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>, <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>, and <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a> speakers may use cognates of "American" to refer to inhabitants of the Americas or to U.S. nationals. They generally have other terms specific to U.S. nationals, such as the German ', French ', Japanese , Arabic ' ( as opposed to ' ), and Italian "". These specific terms may be less common than the term "American".

In French, ', ' or ', from ' ("United States of America"), is a rarely used word that distinguishes U.S. things and persons from the adjective "", which denotes persons and things from the United States, but may also refer to "the Americas".

Likewise, German's use of ' and ' observe said cultural distinction, solely denoting U.S. things and people. Note that these are "politically correct" terms and that in normal parlance, the adjective "American" and its direct cognates are usually used if the context renders the nationality of the person clear.

This differentiation is prevalent in German-speaking countries, as indicated by the <a href="style%20manual">style manual</a> of the "<a href="Neue%20Z%C3%BCrcher%20Zeitung">Neue Zürcher Zeitung</a>" (one of the leading German-language newspapers in Switzerland) which dismisses the term ' as both ′unnecessary′ and ′artificial′ and recommends replacing it with "amerikanisch". The respective guidelines of the foreign ministries of Austria, Germany and Switzerland all prescribe "Amerikaner" and "amerikanisch" in reference to the United States for official usage, making no mention of ' or "".

Portuguese has ', denoting both a person or thing from the Americas and a U.S. national. For referring specifically to a U.S. national and things, some words used are ' (also spelled ', "United States person"), from ', and ' ("Yankee")—both usages exist in Brazil, but are uncommon in Portugal—but the term most often used, and the only one in Portugal, is ', even though it could, as with its Spanish equivalent, apply to Canadians, Mexicans, etc. as well.

In Spanish, ' denotes geographic and cultural origin in the New World, as well as (infrequently) a U.S. citizen; the more common term is ' ("United States person"), which derives from ' ("United States of America"). The Spanish term ' ("North American") is frequently used to refer things and persons from the United States, but this term can also denote people and things from Canada and Mexico. Among Spanish-speakers, North America generally doesn't include Central America or the Caribbean.

In other languages, however, there is no possibility for confusion. For example, the <a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a> word for "U.S. national" is ' () is derived from a word for the United States, ', where ' is an abbreviation for "Yàměilìjiā" ("America") and ' is "country". The name for the American continents is ', from ' plus ' ("continent"). Thus, a ' is an American in the continent sense, and a "" is an American in the U.S. sense.

Conversely, in <a href="Czech%20language">Czech</a>, there is no possibility for disambiguation. "<a href="%3Awiktionary%3AAmeri%C4%8Dan">Američan</a>" (m.) and "<a href="%3Awiktionary%3AAmeri%C4%8Danka">američanka</a>" (f.) can refer to persons from the United States or from the continents of the Americas, and there is no specific word capable of distinguishing the two meanings. For this reason, the latter meaning is very rarely used, and word "američan(ka)" is used almost exclusively to refer to persons from the United States. The usage is exactly parallel to the English word.

<a href="Korean%20language">Korean</a> and <a href="Vietnamese%20language">Vietnamese</a> also use unambiguous terms, with Korean having ' () for the country versus ' () for the continents, and Vietnamese having ' for the country versus ' for the continents. <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a> has such terms as well (' [ versus ' []), but they are found more in newspaper headlines than in speech, where "" predominates.

In <a href="Swahili%20language">Swahili</a>, ' means specifically the United States, and ' is a U.S. national, whereas the international form ' refers to the continents, and ' would be an inhabitants thereof. Likewise, the <a href="Esperanto">Esperanto</a> word ' refers to the continents. For the country there is the term '. Thus, a citizen of the United States is an ', whereas an ' is an inhabitant of the Americas.

In <a href="Hungarian%20language">Hungarian</a> the term amerikai (American) refers to a person or a thing from the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>.

The name "America" was coined by <a href="Martin%20Waldseem%C3%BCller">Martin Waldseemüller</a> from "Americus Vespucius", the Latinized version of the name of <a href="Amerigo%20Vespucci">Amerigo Vespucci</a> (1454–1512), the Italian explorer who mapped South America's east coast and the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> Sea in the early 16th century. Later, Vespucci's published letters were the basis of <a href="Waldseem%C3%BCller%20map">Waldseemüller's 1507 map</a>, which is the first usage of "America". The adjective "American" subsequently denoted the New World.

16th-century European usage of "American" denoted the native inhabitants of the New World. The earliest recorded use of this term in English is in <a href="Thomas%20Hacket">Thomas Hacket</a>'s 1568 translation of <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Th%C3%A9vet">André Thévet</a>'s book "<a href="France%20Antarctique">France Antarctique</a>"; Thévet himself had referred to the natives as "Ameriques". In the following century, the term was extended to European settlers and their descendants in the Americas. The earliest recorded use of "English-American" dates to 1648, in <a href="Thomas%20Gage%20%28clergyman%29">Thomas Gage</a>'s "The English-American his travail by sea and land: or, a new survey of the West India's".

In English, "American" was used especially for people in the <a href="British%20America">British America</a>. <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a>, the leading English lexicographer, wrote in 1775, before the United States declared independence: "That the Americans are able to bear taxation is indubitable." The <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence of July 1776</a> refers to "[the] unanimous Declaration of the thirteen United States of America" adopted by the "Representatives of the United States of America" on July 4, 1776. The official name of the country was reaffirmed on November 15, 1777, when the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a> adopted the <a href="Articles%20of%20Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a>, the first of which says, "The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'". The Articles further state:
Sam Haselby, a history professor in Lebanon and Egypt, claims it was British officials who first called the colonists "Americans". When the drafters of the "Declaration" — <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> from Virginia, for example, or <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a> from Massachusetts — talked about "my country", they meant Virginia or Massachusetts, respectively. This situation was changed by the Revolution and the impulse toward nationalism. Jefferson, newly elected president in May 1801 wrote, "I am sure the measures I mean to pursue are such as would in their nature be approved by every American who can emerge from preconceived prejudices; as for those who cannot, we must take care of them as of the sick in our hospitals. The medicine of time and fact may cure some of them."

In "<a href="The%20Federalist%20Papers">The Federalist Papers</a>" (1787–88), <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> and <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> used the adjective "American" with two different meanings: one political and one geographic; "the American republic" in <a href="Federalist%20No.%2051">Federalist No. 51</a> and in <a href="Federalist%20No.%2070">Federalist No. 70</a>, and, in <a href="Federalist%20No.%2024">Federalist No. 24</a>, Hamilton used "American" to denote the lands beyond the U.S.'s political borders.

Early official U.S. documents show inconsistent usage; the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Alliance%20%281778%29">1778 Treaty of Alliance</a> with <a href="France">France</a> used "the United States of North America" in the first sentence, then "the said United States" afterwards; "the United States of America" and "the United States of North America" derive from "the United Colonies of America" and "the United Colonies of North America". The Treaty of Peace and Amity of September 5, 1795, between the United States and the <a href="Barbary%20States">Barbary States</a> contains the usages "the United States of North America", "citizens of the United States", and "American Citizens".
U.S. President <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, in his <a href="Washington%27s%20Farewell%20Address">1796 "Farewell Address"</a>, declaimed that "The name of American, which belongs to you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation." Political scientist Virginia L. Arbery notes that, in his "Farewell Address": "...Washington invites his fellow citizens to view themselves now as Americans who, out of their love for the truth of liberty, have replaced their maiden names (Virginians, South Carolinians, New Yorkers, etc.) with that of “American”. Get rid of, he urges, “any appellation derived from local discriminations.” By defining himself as an American rather than as a Virginian, Washington set the national standard for all citizens. "Over and over, Washington said that America must be something set apart. As he put it to <a href="Patrick%20Henry">Patrick Henry</a>, 'In a word, I want an "American" character, that the powers of Europe may be convinced we act for "ourselves" and not for "others".'" As the historian <a href="Garry%20Wills">Garry Wills</a> has noted: "This was a theme dear to Washington. He wrote to <a href="Timothy%20Pickering">Timothy Pickering</a> that the nation 'must never forget that we are Americans; the remembrance of which will convince us we ought not to be French or English'." Washington's countrymen subsequently embraced his exhortation with notable enthusiasm.

This semantic divergence among North American <a href="English-speaking%20world">anglophones</a>, however, remained largely unknown in the Spanish-American colonies. In 1801, the document titled "Letter to American Spaniards"—published in French (1799), in Spanish (1801), and in English (1808)—might have influenced <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>'s <a href="Venezuelan%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Act of Independence</a> and its 1811 constitution.

The <a href="Latter-day%20Saints">Latter-day Saints</a>' <a href="Articles%20of%20Faith%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Articles of Faith</a> refer to the American continents as where they are to build Zion. 
Common short forms and abbreviations are the "United States", the "U.S.", the "U.S.A.", and "America"; colloquial versions include the "U.S. of A." and "the States". The term "<a href="Columbia%20%28name%29">Columbia</a>" (from the Columbus surname) was a popular name for the U.S. and for the entire geographic Americas; its usage is present today in the <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">District of Columbia</a>'s name. Moreover, the womanly personification of Columbia appears in some official documents, including editions of the U.S. dollar.

Use of the term "American" for U.S. nationals is common at the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, and financial markets in the United States are referred to as "American financial markets".

"<a href="American%20Samoa">American Samoa</a>" is a recognized territorial name at the United Nations.

The use of "American" as a national <a href="demonym">demonym</a> for U.S. nationals is challenged, primarily by Hispanic Americans. Spanish speakers in Spain and Latin America use the term ' to refer to people and things from the United States (from '), while ' refers to the <a href="the%20Americas">continents</a> as a whole. The term ' is also accepted in many parts of Latin America to refer to a person or something from the United States, however this term may be ambiguous in certain parts. Up to and including the 1992 edition, the ', published by the <a href="Real%20Academia%20Espa%C3%B1ola">Real Academia Española</a>, did not include the United States definition in the entry for '; this was added in the 2001 edition. The Real Academia Española advised against using "" exclusively for U.S. nationals:
Modern Canadians typically refer to people from the United States as "Americans", though they seldom refer to the United States as "America"; they use the terms "the United States", "the U.S.", or (informally) "the States" instead. Canadians rarely apply the term "American" to themselves – some Canadians resent either being referred to as Americans because of mistaken assumptions that they are U.S. citizens or others' inability, particularly of those overseas, to distinguish <a href="Canadian%20English">Canadian</a> from <a href="American%20English">American</a> <a href="Accent%20%28dialect%29">accents</a>. Some Canadians have protested the use of "American" as a national demonym. People of U.S. ethnic origin in Canada are categorized as "Other North American origins" by <a href="Statistics%20Canada">Statistics Canada</a> for purposes of <a href="census">census</a> counts.

Generally, ' denotes "U.S. citizen" in <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>. Usage of ' to exclusively denote people and things of the U.S. is discouraged by the <a href="Academia%20das%20Ci%C3%AAncias%20de%20Lisboa">Lisbon Academy of Sciences</a>, because the specific word ' (also ') clearly denotes a person from the United States. The term currently used by the Portuguese press is ".

In <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, the term ' is used to address both that which pertains to both American continents and, in current speech, that which pertains to the U.S.; the particular meaning is deduced from context. Alternatively, the term ' ("North American") is also used in more informal contexts, while ' (of the U.S.) is the preferred form in academia. Use of the three terms is common in schools, government, and media. The term ' is used almost exclusively for the continents, and the U.S. is called ' ("United States") or ' ("United States of America"), often abbreviated ".

The Getting Through Customs website advises business travelers not to use "in America" as a U.S. reference when conducting business in Brazil.

"American" in the 1994 "<a href="AP%20Stylebook">Associated Press Stylebook</a>" was defined as, "An acceptable description for a resident of the United States. It also may be applied to any resident or citizen of nations in North or South America." Elsewhere, the "AP Stylebook" indicates that "United States" must "be spelled out when used as a noun. Use U.S. (no space) only as an adjective."

The entry for "America" in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Manual%20of%20Style%20and%20Usage">The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage</a>" from 1999 reads:
Media releases from the <a href="Pope">Pope</a> and <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a> frequently use "America" to refer to the United States, and "American" to denote something or someone from the United States.

At least one international law uses "U.S. citizen" in defining a citizen of the United States rather than "American citizen"; for example, the English version of the <a href="North%20American%20Free%20Trade%20Agreement">North American Free Trade Agreement</a> includes:
Many international treaties use the terms "American" and "American citizen":

Products that are labeled, advertised, and marketed in the U.S. as "<a href="Made%20in%20USA%20label">Made in the USA</a>" must be, as set by the <a href="Federal%20Trade%20Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> (FTC), "all or virtually all made in the U.S." The FTC, to prevent deception of customers and unfair competition, considers an unqualified claim of "American Made" to expressly claim exclusive manufacture in the U.S: "The <a href="FTC%20Act">FTC Act</a> gives the Commission the power to bring law enforcement actions against false or misleading claims that a product is of U.S. origin."

There are a number of alternatives to the <a href="demonym">demonym</a> "American" as a citizen of the United States that do not simultaneously mean any inhabitant of the Americas. One uncommon alternative is "<a href="Usonian">Usonian</a>", which usually describes a certain style of residential <a href="architecture">architecture</a> designed by <a href="Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>. Other alternatives have also surfaced, but most have fallen into disuse and obscurity. "<a href="Merriam-Webster">Merriam-Webster</a>'s Dictionary of English Usage" says:

Nevertheless, no alternative to "American" is common.

Ada (programming language)

Ada is a <a href="structured%20programming">structured</a>, <a href="statically%20typed">statically typed</a>, <a href="Imperative%20programming">imperative</a>, <a href="wide-spectrum%20language">wide-spectrum</a>, and <a href="Object-oriented%20programming">object-oriented</a> <a href="High-level%20programming%20language">high-level</a> <a href="computer%20programming">computer</a> <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a>, extended from <a href="Pascal%20%28programming%20language%29">Pascal</a> and other languages. It has built-in language support for <a href="design%20by%20contract">design-by-contract</a>, extremely strong typing, explicit concurrency, offering tasks, synchronous message passing, protected objects, and <a href="nondeterministic%20programming">non-determinism</a>. Ada improves code safety and maintainability by using the compiler to find errors in favor of runtime errors. Ada is an international standard; the current version (known as Ada 2012) is defined by ISO/IEC 8652:2012.

Ada was originally designed by a team led by <a href="Jean%20Ichbiah">Jean Ichbiah</a> of <a href="Groupe%20Bull">CII Honeywell Bull</a> under contract to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">United States Department of Defense</a> (DoD) from 1977 to 1983 to supersede over 450 programming languages used by the DoD at that time. Ada was named after <a href="Ada%20Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> (1815–1852), who has been credited with being the first computer programmer.

Ada was originally targeted at <a href="embedded%20system">embedded</a> and <a href="real-time%20computing">real-time</a> systems. The Ada 95 revision, designed by <a href="Tucker%20Taft">S. Tucker Taft</a> of <a href="Intermetrics">Intermetrics</a> between 1992 and 1995, improved support for systems, numerical, financial, and <a href="object-oriented%20programming">object-oriented programming</a> (OOP).

Features of Ada include: <a href="strongly%20typed%20languages">strong typing</a>, <a href="modularity%20%28programming%29">modularity mechanisms</a> (packages), <a href="run-time%20checking">run-time checking</a>, <a href="Parallel%20computing">parallel processing</a> (<a href="Task%20%28computing%29">tasks</a>, synchronous <a href="message%20passing">message passing</a>, <a href="protected%20objects">protected objects</a>, and nondeterministic <a href="Switch%20statement">select statements</a>), <a href="exception%20handling">exception handling</a>, and <a href="generic%20programming">generics</a>. Ada 95 added support for <a href="object-oriented%20programming">object-oriented programming</a>, including <a href="dynamic%20dispatch">dynamic dispatch</a>.

The syntax of Ada minimizes choices of ways to perform basic operations, and prefers English keywords (such as "or else" and "and then") to symbols (such as "||" and "&&"). Ada uses the basic arithmetical operators "+", "-", "*", and "/", but avoids using other symbols. Code blocks are delimited by words such as "declare", "begin", and "end", where the "end" (in most cases) is followed by the identifier of the block it closes (e.g., "if … end if", "loop … end loop"). In the case of conditional blocks this avoids a "<a href="dangling%20else">dangling else</a>" that could pair with the wrong nested if-expression in other languages like C or Java.

Ada is designed for development of very large software systems. Ada packages can be compiled separately. Ada package specifications (the package interface) can also be compiled separately without the implementation to check for consistency. This makes it possible to detect problems early during the design phase, before implementation starts.

A large number of compile-time checks are supported to help avoid bugs that would not be detectable until run-time in some other languages or would require explicit checks to be added to the source code. For example, the syntax requires explicitly named closing of blocks to prevent errors due to mismatched end tokens. The adherence to strong typing allows detection of many common software errors (wrong parameters, range violations, invalid references, mismatched types, etc.) either during compile-time, or otherwise during run-time. As concurrency is part of the language specification, the compiler can in some cases detect potential deadlocks. Compilers also commonly check for misspelled identifiers, visibility of packages, redundant declarations, etc. and can provide warnings and useful suggestions on how to fix the error.

Ada also supports run-time checks to protect against access to unallocated memory, <a href="buffer%20overflow">buffer overflow</a> errors, range violations, <a href="off-by-one%20error">off-by-one error</a>s, array access errors, and other detectable bugs. These checks can be disabled in the interest of runtime efficiency, but can often be compiled efficiently. It also includes facilities to help program verification. For these reasons, Ada is widely used in critical systems, where any <a href="anomaly%20in%20software">anomaly</a> might lead to very serious consequences, e.g., accidental death, injury or severe financial loss. Examples of systems where Ada is used include <a href="avionics">avionics</a>, <a href="Air%20traffic%20control">ATC</a>, railways, banking, military and space technology.

Ada's dynamic <a href="memory%20management">memory management</a> is high-level and type-safe. Ada does not have generic or untyped <a href="pointer%20%28computer%20programming%29">pointers</a>; nor does it implicitly declare any pointer type. Instead, all dynamic memory allocation and deallocation must take place through explicitly declared "access types".
Each access type has an associated "storage pool" that handles the low-level details of memory management; the programmer can either use the default storage pool or define new ones (this is particularly relevant for <a href="Non-Uniform%20Memory%20Access">Non-Uniform Memory Access</a>). It is even possible to declare several different access types that all designate the same type but use different storage pools.
Also, the language provides for "accessibility checks", both at compile time and at run time, that ensures that an "access value" cannot outlive the type of the object it points to.

Though the semantics of the language allow automatic <a href="garbage%20collection%20%28computer%20science%29">garbage collection</a> of inaccessible objects, most implementations do not support it by default, as it would cause unpredictable behaviour in real-time systems. Ada does support a limited form of <a href="region-based%20memory%20management">region-based memory management</a>; also, creative use of storage pools can provide for a limited form of automatic garbage collection, since destroying a storage pool also destroys all the objects in the pool.

Ada was designed to resemble the English language in its syntax for <a href="Comment%20%28computer%20programming%29">comments</a>: a double-<a href="dash">dash</a> ("--"), resembling an <a href="em%20dash">em dash</a>, denotes comment text. Comments stop at end of line, so there is no danger of unclosed comments accidentally voiding whole sections of source code. Prefixing each line (or column) with "--" will skip all that code, while being clearly denoted as a column of repeated "--" down the page. There is no limit to the nesting of comments, thereby allowing prior code, with commented-out sections, to be commented-out as even larger sections. All <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a> characters are allowed in comments, such as for symbolic formulas (E[0]=m×c²). To the compiler, the double-dash is treated as end-of-line, allowing continued parsing of the language as a <a href="context-free%20grammar">context-free grammar</a>.

The semicolon (";") is a <a href="statement%20terminator">statement terminator</a>, and the null or no-operation statement is codice_1. A single codice_2 without a statement to terminate is not allowed.

Unlike most <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization">ISO</a> standards, the Ada language definition (known as the "Ada Reference Manual" or "ARM", or sometimes the "Language Reference Manual" or "LRM") is <a href="free%20content">free content</a>. Thus, it is a common reference for Ada programmers and not just programmers implementing Ada compilers. Apart from the reference manual, there is also an extensive rationale document which explains the language design and the use of various language constructs. This document is also widely used by programmers. When the language was revised, a new rationale document was written.

One notable <a href="free%20software">free software</a> tool that is used by many Ada programmers to aid them in writing Ada source code is the <a href="GNAT%20Programming%20Studio">GNAT Programming Studio</a>.

In the 1970s, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">US Department of Defense</a> (DoD) was concerned by the number of different programming languages being used for its embedded computer system projects, many of which were obsolete or hardware-dependent, and none of which supported safe modular programming. In 1975, a <a href="working%20group">working group</a>, the <a href="High%20Order%20Language%20Working%20Group">High Order Language Working Group</a> (HOLWG), was formed with the intent to reduce this number by finding or creating a programming language generally suitable for the department's and the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">UK Ministry of Defence</a> requirements. After many iterations beginning with an original <a href="Straw%20man%20proposal">Straw man proposal</a> the eventual programming language was named Ada. The total number of high-level programming languages in use for such projects fell from over 450 in 1983 to 37 by 1996.

The HOLWG working group crafted the <a href="Steelman%20language%20requirements">Steelman language requirements</a>, a series of documents stating the requirements they felt a programming language should satisfy. Many existing languages were formally reviewed, but the team concluded in 1977 that no existing language met the specifications.

Requests for proposals for a new programming language were issued and four contractors were hired to develop their proposals under the names of Red (<a href="Intermetrics">Intermetrics</a> led by Benjamin Brosgol), Green (<a href="CII%20Honeywell%20Bull">CII Honeywell Bull</a>, led by <a href="Jean%20Ichbiah">Jean Ichbiah</a>), Blue (<a href="SofTech%2C%20Inc.">SofTech</a>, led by John Goodenough) and Yellow (<a href="SRI%20International">SRI International</a>, led by Jay Spitzen). In April 1978, after public scrutiny, the Red and Green proposals passed to the next phase. In May 1979, the Green proposal, designed by Jean Ichbiah at CII Honeywell Bull, was chosen and given the name Ada—after <a href="Ada%20Lovelace">Augusta Ada, Countess of Lovelace</a>. This proposal was influenced by the programming language <a href="LIS%20programming%20language">LIS</a> that Ichbiah and his group had developed in the 1970s. The preliminary Ada reference manual
was published in ACM SIGPLAN Notices in June 1979. The Military Standard reference manual was approved on December 10, 1980 (<a href="Ada%20Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>'s birthday), and
given the number MIL-STD-1815 in honor of Ada Lovelace's birth year. In 1981, <a href="C.%20A.%20R.%20Hoare">C. A. R. Hoare</a> took advantage of his <a href="Turing%20Award">Turing Award</a> speech to criticize Ada for being overly complex and hence unreliable, but subsequently seemed to recant in the foreword he wrote for an Ada textbook.

Ada attracted much attention from the programming community as a whole during its early days. Its backers and others predicted that it might become a dominant language for general purpose programming and not just defense-related work. Ichbiah publicly stated that within ten years, only two programming languages would remain, Ada and <a href="Lisp%20%28programming%20language%29">Lisp</a>. Early Ada compilers struggled to implement the large, complex language, and both compile-time and run-time performance tended to be slow and tools primitive. Compiler vendors expended most of their efforts in passing the massive, language-conformance-testing, government-required "ACVC" validation suite that was required in another novel feature of the Ada language effort.

The first validated Ada implementation was the NYU Ada/Ed translator, certified on April 11, 1983. NYU Ada/Ed is implemented in the high-level set language <a href="SETL">SETL</a>. A number of commercial companies began offering Ada compilers and associated development tools, including <a href="Alsys">Alsys</a>, <a href="TeleSoft">TeleSoft</a>, <a href="DDC-I">DDC-I</a>, <a href="Advanced%20Computer%20Techniques">Advanced Computer Techniques</a>, <a href="Tartan%20Laboratories">Tartan Laboratories</a>, <a href="TLD%20Systems">TLD Systems</a>, <a href="Verdix">Verdix</a>, and others.
In 1991, the US Department of Defense began to require the use of Ada (the "Ada mandate") for all software, though exceptions to this rule were often granted. The Department of Defense Ada mandate was effectively removed in 1997, as the DoD began to embrace <a href="Commercial%20off-the-shelf">COTS</a> technology. Similar requirements existed in other <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Treaty%20Organisation">NATO</a> countries: Ada was required for NATO systems involving command and control and other functions, and Ada was the mandated or preferred language for defense-related applications in countries such as Sweden, Germany, and Canada.

By the late 1980s and early 1990s, Ada compilers had improved in performance, but there were still barriers to full exploitation of Ada's abilities, including a tasking model that was different from what most real-time programmers were used to.

Because of Ada's <a href="safety-critical">safety-critical</a> support features, it is now used not only for military applications, but also in commercial projects where a software bug can have severe consequences, e.g., <a href="avionics">avionics</a> and <a href="air%20traffic%20control">air traffic control</a>, commercial rockets such as the <a href="Ariane%20%28rocket%20family%29">Ariane 4 and 5</a>, <a href="satellite">satellite</a>s and other space systems, railway transport and banking.
For example, the <a href="Airplane%20Information%20Management%20System">Airplane Information Management System</a>, the <a href="Aircraft%20flight%20control%20systems">fly-by-wire</a> system software in the <a href="Boeing%20777">Boeing 777</a>, was written in Ada. Developed by <a href="Honeywell%20Aerospace">Honeywell Air Transport Systems</a> in collaboration with consultants from <a href="DDC-I">DDC-I</a>, it became arguably the best-known of any Ada project, civilian or military. The Canadian Automated Air Traffic System was written in 1 million lines of Ada (<a href="Source%20lines%20of%20code">SLOC</a> count). It featured advanced distributed processing, a distributed Ada database, and object-oriented design. Ada is also used in other air traffic systems, e.g., the UK’s next-generation Interim Future Area Control Tools Support (iFACTS) air traffic control system is designed and implemented using <a href="SPARK%20%28programming%20language%29">SPARK</a> Ada.
It is also used in the <a href="France">French</a> <a href="Transmission%20Voie-Machine">TVM</a> in-<a href="cab%20signalling">cab signalling</a> system on the <a href="TGV">TGV</a> high-speed rail system, and the metro suburban trains in Paris, London, Hong Kong and New York City.

The language became an <a href="American%20National%20Standards%20Institute">ANSI</a> standard in 1983 (<a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20040625113309/http%3A//archive.adaic.com/standards/83lrm/html/Welcome.html">ANSI/MIL-STD 1815A</a>), and without any further changes became
an <a href="International%20standard">ISO standard</a> in 1987 (ISO-8652:1987). This version of the language is commonly known as Ada 83, from the date of its adoption by ANSI, but is sometimes referred to also as Ada 87, from the date of its adoption by ISO.

Ada 95, the joint ISO/ANSI standard (<a href="http%3A//www.adaic.org/standards/95lrm/html/RM-TTL.html">ISO-8652:1995</a>) was published in February 1995, making Ada 95 the first ISO standard object-oriented programming language. To help with the standard revision and future acceptance, the <a href="US%20Air%20Force">US Air Force</a> funded the development of the <a href="GNAT">GNAT</a> <a href="Compiler">Compiler</a>. Presently, the GNAT Compiler is part of the <a href="GNU%20Compiler%20Collection">GNU Compiler Collection</a>.

Work has continued on improving and updating the technical content of the Ada programming language. A Technical Corrigendum to Ada 95 was published in October 2001, and a major Amendment, <a href="http%3A//www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail%3FCSNUMBER%3D45001">ISO/IEC 8652:1995/Amd 1:2007</a> was published on March 9, 2007. At the Ada-Europe 2012 conference in Stockholm, the Ada Resource Association (ARA) and Ada-Europe announced the completion of the design of the latest version of the Ada programming language and the submission of the reference manual to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for approval. ISO/IEC 8652:2012 was published in December 2012.

Other related standards include <a href="ISO%208651">ISO 8651</a>-3:1988 "Information processing systems—Computer graphics—Graphical Kernel System (GKS) language bindings—Part 3: Ada".

Ada is an <a href="ALGOL">ALGOL</a>-like programming language featuring control structures with reserved words such as "if", "then", "else", "while", "for", and so on. However, Ada also has many data structuring facilities and other abstractions which were not included in the original <a href="ALGOL%2060">ALGOL 60</a>, such as <a href="type%20system">type definitions</a>, <a href="record%20%28computer%20science%29">records</a>, <a href="pointer%20%28computer%20programming%29">pointers</a>, <a href="enumerated%20type">enumerations</a>. Such constructs were in part inherited from or inspired by <a href="Pascal%20%28programming%20language%29">Pascal</a>.

A common example of a language's <a href="Syntax%20%28programming%20languages%29">syntax</a> is the <a href="Hello%20world%20program">Hello world program</a>:

with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
procedure Hello is
begin
end Hello;

This program can be compiled by using the freely available open source compiler <a href="GNAT">GNAT</a>, by executing
gnatmake hello.adb

Ada's type system is not based on a set of predefined <a href="primitive%20types">primitive types</a> but allows users to declare their own types. This declaration in turn is not based on the internal representation of the type but on describing the goal which should be achieved. This allows the compiler to determine a suitable memory size for the type, and to check for violations of the type definition at compile time and run time (i.e., range violations, buffer overruns, type consistency, etc.). Ada supports numerical types defined by a range, modulo types, aggregate types (records and arrays), and enumeration types. Access types define a reference to an instance of a specified type; untyped pointers are not permitted.
Special types provided by the language are task types and protected types.

For example, a date might be represented as:
type Day_type is range 1 .. 31;
type Month_type is range 1 .. 12;
type Year_type is range 1800 .. 2100;
type Hours is mod 24;
type Weekday is (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday);

type Date is
Types can be refined by declaring subtypes:

subtype Working_Hours is Hours range 0 .. 12; -- at most 12 Hours to work a day
subtype Working_Day is Weekday range Monday .. Friday; -- Days to work

Work_Load: constant array(Working_Day) of Working_Hours -- implicit type declaration

Types can have modifiers such as "limited, abstract, private" etc. Private types can only be accessed and limited types can only be modified or copied within the scope of the package that defines them.
Ada 95 adds additional features for object-oriented extension of types.

Ada is a <a href="structured%20programming">structured programming</a> language, meaning that the flow of control is structured into standard statements. All standard constructs and deep level early exit are supported so the use of the also supported '<a href="goto%20%28command%29">go to</a>' commands is seldom needed.
-- while a is not equal to b, loop.
while a /= b loop
end loop;

if a > b then
else
end if;

for i in 1 .. 10 loop
end loop;

loop
end loop;

case i is
end case;

for aWeekday in Weekday'Range loop -- loop over an enumeration
end loop;
Among the parts of an Ada program are packages, procedures and functions.

Example:
Package specification (example.ads)

package Example is
end Example;

Package body (example.adb)

with Ada.Text_IO;
package body Example is

-- package initialization executed when the package is elaborated
begin
end Example;

This program can be compiled, e.g., by using the freely available open source compiler <a href="GNAT">GNAT</a>, by executing
gnatmake -z example.adb

Packages, procedures and functions can nest to any depth and each can also be the logical outermost block.

Each package, procedure or function can have its own declarations of constants, types, variables, and other procedures, functions and packages, which can be declared in any order.

Ada has language support for task-based concurrency. The fundamental concurrent unit in Ada is a "task" which is a built-in limited type. Tasks are specified in two parts – the task declaration defines the task interface (similar to a type declaration), the task body specifies the implementation of the task.
Depending on the implementation, Ada tasks are either mapped to operating system threads or processes, or are scheduled internally by the Ada runtime.

Tasks can have entries for synchronisation (a form of <a href="message%20passing">synchronous message passing</a>). Task entries are declared in the task specification. Each task entry can have one or more "accept" statements within the task body. If the control flow of the task reaches an accept statement, the task is blocked until the corresponding entry is called by another task (similarly, a calling task is blocked until the called task reaches the corresponding accept statement). Task entries can have parameters similar to procedures, allowing tasks to synchronously exchange data. In conjunction with "select" statements it is possible to define "guards" on accept statements (similar to Dijkstra's <a href="guarded%20commands">guarded commands</a>).

Ada also offers "<a href="protected%20object">protected object</a>s" for <a href="mutual%20exclusion">mutual exclusion</a>. Protected objects are a <a href="Monitor%20%28synchronization%29">monitor-like</a> construct, but use guards instead of conditional variables for signaling (similar to conditional critical regions). Protected objects combine the data encapsulation and safe mutual exclusion from monitors, and entry guards from conditional critical regions. The main advantage over classical monitors is that conditional variables are not required for signaling, avoiding potential deadlocks due to incorrect locking semantics. Like tasks, the protected object is a built-in limited type, and it also has a declaration part and a body.

A protected object consists of encapsulated private data (which can only be accessed from within the protected object), and procedures, functions and entries which are guaranteed to be mutually exclusive (with the only exception of functions, which are required to be side effect free and can therefore run concurrently with other functions). A task calling a protected object is blocked if another task is currently executing inside the same protected object, and released when this other task leaves the protected object. Blocked tasks are queued on the protected object ordered by time of arrival.

Protected object entries are similar to procedures, but additionally have "guards". If a guard evaluates to false, a calling task is blocked and added to the queue of that entry; now another task can be admitted to the protected object, as no task is currently executing inside the protected object. Guards are re-evaluated whenever a task leaves the protected object, as this is the only time when the evaluation of guards can have changed.

Calls to entries can be "requeued" to other entries with the same signature. A task that is requeued is blocked and added to the queue of the target entry; this means that the protected object is released and allows admission of another task.

The "select" statement in Ada can be used to implement non-blocking entry calls and accepts, non-deterministic selection of entries (also with guards), time-outs and aborts.

The following example illustrates some concepts of concurrent programming in Ada.

with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Traffic is

begin
end Traffic;
A pragma is a <a href="compiler%20directive">compiler directive</a> that conveys information to the compiler to allow specific manipulation of compiled output. Certain pragmas are built into the language while other are implementation-specific.

Examples of common usage of compiler pragmas would be to disable certain features, such as run-time type checking or array subscript boundary checking, or to instruct the compiler to insert object code in lieu of a function call (as C/C++ does with inline functions).

Alfonso Cuarón

Alfonso Cuarón Orozco (; born November 28, 1961) is a Mexican <a href="film%20director">film director</a>, <a href="screenwriter">screenwriter</a>, <a href="film%20producer">producer</a>, and <a href="Film%20editor">editor</a> best known for his dramas "<a href="A%20Little%20Princess%20%281995%20film%29">A Little Princess</a>" (1995) and
"<a href="Y%20Tu%20Mam%C3%A1%20Tambi%C3%A9n">Y Tu Mamá También</a>" (2001), the fantasy film "<a href="Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Prisoner%20of%20Azkaban%20%28film%29">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a>" (2004), and science fiction thrillers "<a href="Children%20of%20Men">Children of Men</a>" (2006) and "<a href="Gravity%20%282013%20film%29">Gravity</a>" (2013). Cuarón is the first Mexican director to win an <a href="AMPAS">Oscar</a> for Best Director.

Most of his work has been praised by both audiences and critics, and has been nominated for six <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>s including <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Screenplay">Best Original Screenplay</a> for "Y Tu Mamá También", and both <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Adapted%20Screenplay">Best Adapted Screenplay</a> and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20Editing">Best Film Editing</a> for "Children of Men". For "Gravity", Cuarón received several major accolades for his achievement in direction, winning in the respective categories at the Academy Awards, the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Golden Globe Awards</a>, the <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Direction">BAFTA Awards</a> and the <a href="Directors%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Directing%20%E2%80%93%20Feature%20Film">Directors Guild of America</a>; and in addition winning the BAFTA Award <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20British%20Film">Best British Film</a> and the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20Editing">Academy Award for Best Film Editing</a> (shared with <a href="Mark%20Sanger">Mark Sanger</a>). He has also been awarded the <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20not%20in%20the%20English%20Language">BAFTA Award for Best Film not in the English Language</a> as one of the producers of "<a href="Pan%27s%20Labyrinth">Pan's Labyrinth</a>" (2006).

Cuarón's brother <a href="Carlos%20Cuar%C3%B3n">Carlos</a>, as well as his son <a href="Jon%C3%A1s%20Cuar%C3%B3n">Jonás</a>, are also writers and directors and have both acted as co-writers in some of his works. He is also friends with fellow Mexican directors <a href="Guillermo%20del%20Toro">Guillermo del Toro</a> and <a href="Alejandro%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20I%C3%B1%C3%A1rritu">Alejandro González Iñárritu</a>, collectively known as "The Three Amigos of Cinema."

Cuarón was born in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>, and is the son of Alfredo Cuarón, a nuclear physicist who worked for the United Nations' <a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> for many years. He has two brothers, <a href="Carlos%20Cuar%C3%B3n">Carlos</a>, also a filmmaker, and Alfredo, a conservation biologist.

Cuarón studied philosophy at the <a href="National%20Autonomous%20University%20of%20Mexico">National Autonomous University of Mexico</a> (UNAM) and filmmaking at CUEC (<a href="Centro%20Universitario%20de%20Estudios%20Cinematogr%C3%A1ficos">Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos</a>), a school within the same university. There, he met the director Carlos Marcovich and <a href="cinematographer">cinematographer</a> <a href="Emmanuel%20Lubezki">Emmanuel Lubezki</a>, and they made what would be his first <a href="short%20film">short film</a>, "Vengeance Is Mine".

Cuarón began working in television in Mexico, first as a technician and then as a director. His television work led to assignments as an assistant director for several Latin American film productions including "" and "<a href="Romero%20%28film%29">Romero</a>", and in 1991, he landed his first big-screen directorial assignment. On January 12, 2014, Alfonso accepted the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a> in the category <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Best Director</a> for <a href="Gravity%20%282013%20film%29">Gravity</a> (<a href="71st%20Golden%20Globe%20Awards">The 71st Annual Golden Globe Awards</a>, 2014). He also won two Oscars for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20Editing">Best Film Editing</a> and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Directing">Best Directing</a>.

"<a href="S%C3%B3lo%20con%20tu%20pareja">Sólo con tu pareja</a>" was a sex comedy about a womanizing businessman (played by <a href="Daniel%20Gim%C3%A9nez%20Cacho">Daniel Giménez Cacho</a>) who, after having sex with an attractive nurse, is fooled into believing he's contracted <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a>. In addition to writing, producing and directing, Cuarón co-edited the film with Luis Patlán. It is somewhat unusual for directors to be credited co-editors, although the <a href="Coen%20Brothers">Coen Brothers</a> and <a href="Robert%20Rodriguez">Robert Rodriguez</a> have both directed and edited nearly all of their films. Cuarón continued this close involvement in editing on several of his later films.

The film, which also starred cabaret singer <a href="Astrid%20Hadad">Astrid Hadad</a> and model/actress Claudia Ramírez (with whom Cuarón was linked between 1989 and 1993), was a big hit in Mexico. After this success, director <a href="Sydney%20Pollack">Sydney Pollack</a> hired Cuarón to direct an episode of "<a href="Fallen%20Angels%20%28TV%20series%29">Fallen Angels</a>", a series of <a href="neo-noir">neo-noir</a> stories produced for the <a href="Showtime%20%28TV%20network%29">Showtime</a> premium cable network in 1993; other directors who worked on the series included <a href="Steven%20Soderbergh">Steven Soderbergh</a>, <a href="Jonathan%20Kaplan">Jonathan Kaplan</a>, <a href="Peter%20Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a> and <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a>.

In 1995, Cuarón released his first feature film produced in the United States, "<a href="A%20Little%20Princess%20%281995%20film%29">A Little Princess</a>", an adaptation of <a href="Frances%20Hodgson%20Burnett">Frances Hodgson Burnett</a>'s classic novel. Cuarón's next feature was also a literary adaptation, a modernized version of <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>'s "<a href="Great%20Expectations%20%281998%20film%29">Great Expectations</a>" starring <a href="Ethan%20Hawke">Ethan Hawke</a>, <a href="Gwyneth%20Paltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a> and <a href="Robert%20De%20Niro">Robert De Niro</a>.

Cuarón's next project found him returning to Mexico with a Spanish-speaking cast to film "<a href="Y%20Tu%20Mam%C3%A1%20Tambi%C3%A9n">Y Tu Mamá También</a>", starring <a href="Gael%20Garc%C3%ADa%20Bernal">Gael García Bernal</a>, <a href="Diego%20Luna">Diego Luna</a> and <a href="Maribel%20Verd%C3%BA">Maribel Verdú</a>. It was a provocative and controversial road comedy about two sexually obsessed teenagers who take an extended road trip with an attractive married woman that is much older than them. The film's open portrayal of sexuality and frequent rude humor, as well as the politically and socially relevant asides, made the film an international hit and a major success with critics. Cuarón shared an <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> nomination for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Writing%20%28Original%20Screenplay%29">Best Original Screenplay</a> with co-writer and brother <a href="Carlos%20Cuar%C3%B3n">Carlos Cuarón</a>.

In 2004, Cuarón directed the third film in the successful "<a href="Harry%20Potter%20%28film%20series%29">Harry Potter</a>" series, "<a href="Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Prisoner%20of%20Azkaban%20%28film%29">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a>". Cuarón faced criticism from some of the more purist "<a href="Harry%20Potter">Harry Potter</a>" fans for his approach to the film. At the time of the movie's release, however, author <a href="J.%20K.%20Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a>, who had seen and loved Cuarón's film "Y Tu Mamá También", said that it was her personal favorite from the series so far. Critically, the film was also better received than the first two installments, with some critics remarking its new tone and for being the first "Harry Potter" film to truly capture the essence of the novels. It remained as the most critically acclaimed film of the "Harry Potter" film franchise.

Cuarón's feature "<a href="Children%20of%20Men">Children of Men</a>", an adaptation of the <a href="P.%20D.%20James">P. D. James</a> novel starring <a href="Clive%20Owen">Clive Owen</a>, <a href="Julianne%20Moore">Julianne Moore</a> and <a href="Michael%20Caine">Michael Caine</a>, received wide critical acclaim, including three <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> nominations. Cuarón himself received two nominations for his work on the film in <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20Editing">Best Film Editing</a> (with <a href="Alex%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20%28film%20editor%29">Alex Rodríguez</a>) and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Adapted%20Screenplay">Best Adapted Screenplay</a> (with several collaborators).

He created the production and distribution company <a href="Esperanto%20Filmoj">Esperanto Filmoj</a> ("Esperanto Films", named because of his support for the international language <a href="Esperanto">Esperanto</a>), which has credits in the films "<a href="Duck%20Season">Duck Season</a>", "<a href="Pan%27s%20Labyrinth">Pan's Labyrinth</a>", and "<a href="Gravity%20%282013%20film%29">Gravity</a>".

Cuarón also directed the controversial public service announcement "I Am Autism" for <a href="Autism%20Speaks">Autism Speaks</a> that was sharply criticized by disability rights groups for its negative portrayal of autism.

In 2010, Cuarón began to develop the film "<a href="Gravity%20%282013%20film%29">Gravity</a>", a drama set in space. He was joined by producer <a href="David%20Heyman">David Heyman</a>, with whom Cuarón worked on "<a href="Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Prisoner%20of%20Azkaban%20%28film%29">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a>". Starring <a href="Sandra%20Bullock">Sandra Bullock</a> and <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a>, the film was released in the fall of 2013 and opened the <a href="70th%20Venice%20International%20Film%20Festival">70th Venice International Film Festival</a> in August. The film received ten <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> nominations, including <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a> and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Directing">Best Directing</a>. Cuarón won for Best Directing, becoming the first Latin American to win the award, while he and <a href="Mark%20Sanger">Mark Sanger</a> shared the award for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20Editing">Best Film Editing</a>.

In 2013, Cuarón created "<a href="Believe%20%28TV%20series%29">Believe</a>", a science fiction/fantasy/adventure series that was broadcast as part of the 2013–14 United States network television schedule on NBC as a mid-season entry. The series was created by Cuarón for Bad Robot Productions and Warner Bros. Television. In 2014, "<a href="TIME">TIME</a>" placed him in its list of "<a href="100%20Most%20Influential%20People%20in%20the%20World">100 Most Influential People in the World</a>" – Pioneers.

In May 2015 Cuarón was announced as the President of the Jury for the <a href="72nd%20Venice%20International%20Film%20Festival">72nd Venice International Film Festival</a>.

On September 8, 2016, it was announced that he would be writing and directing <a href="Roma%20%28upcoming%20film%29">a project</a> focusing on a Mexican family living in Mexico City in the 1970s. Production is set to begin in fall 2016. The project will be produced by Cuarón, Gabriela Rodríguez and Nicolás Celis. On November 3, 2016, it was revealed that the crew was robbed on set during filming.

Cuarón is a vegetarian and has been living in <a href="London">London</a> since 2000. He was 20 when his girlfriend at the time became pregnant with <a href="Jon%C3%A1s%20Cuar%C3%B3n">Jonás</a>. He was married to <a href="Italy">Italian</a> actress and freelance journalist Annalisa Bugliani from 2001 to 2008. They have two children: daughter Tess Bu Cuarón (born 2003) and son Olmo Teodoro Cuarón (born 2005).

Arianism

In <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>, Arianism is a <a href="Christological">Christological</a> concept which asserts the belief that <a href="Jesus">Jesus Christ</a> is the <a href="Son%20of%20God">Son of God</a> who was begotten by <a href="God%20the%20Father">God the Father</a> at a point in time, is distinct from the <a href="Father">Father</a> and is therefore subordinate to the Father. Arian teachings were first attributed to <a href="Arius">Arius</a> (<a href="circa">c.</a> AD 256–336), a Christian <a href="presbyter">presbyter</a> in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. The teachings of Arius and his supporters were opposed to the theological views held by <a href="Homoousian">Homoousian</a> Christians, regarding the nature of the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a> and the nature of Christ. The Arian <a href="Christology">concept of Christ</a> is based on the belief that the Son of God did not always exist but was begotten by God the Father.

There was a dispute between two interpretations (Arianism and Homoousianism) based upon the theological orthodoxy of the time, both of them attempted to solve its theological dilemmas. So there were, initially, two equally orthodox interpretations which initiated a conflict in order to attract adepts and define the new orthodoxy. <a href="Homoousian">Homoousian</a>ism was formally affirmed by the first two <a href="Ecumenical%20Council">Ecumenical Council</a>s. The Ecumenical <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">First Council of Nicaea</a> of 325 deemed it to be a heresy. All mainstream branches of Christianity now consider Arianism to be <a href="Heterodoxy">heterodox</a> and <a href="heresy">heretical</a>.

According to Everett Ferguson, "The great majority of Christians had no clear views about the nature of the Trinity and they did not understand what was at stake in the issues that surrounded it." At the regional <a href="First%20Synod%20of%20Tyre">First Synod of Tyre</a> in 335, Arius was exonerated. <a href="Constantine%20the%20Great">Constantine the Great</a> was baptized by the Arian bishop <a href="Eusebius%20of%20Nicomedia">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a>. After the deaths of both Arius and Constantine, Arius was again <a href="anathema">anathemised</a> and pronounced a heretic again at the Ecumenical <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Constantinople">First Council of Constantinople</a> of 381. The Roman Emperors <a href="Constantius%20II%23Christianity%20under%20Constantius">Constantius II</a> (337–361) and <a href="Valens%23Struggles%20with%20the%20religious%20nature%20of%20the%20Empire">Valens</a> (364–378) were Arians or <a href="Semi-Arianism">Semi-Arians</a>, as was the first <a href="King%20of%20Italy">King of Italy</a>, <a href="Odoacer">Odoacer</a> (433?–493), and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Lombards">Lombards</a> were also Arians or Semi-Arians until the 7th century.

Arianism is also used to refer to other <a href="nontrinitarian">nontrinitarian</a> theological systems of the 4th century, which regarded <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a>—the Son of God, the <a href="Logos%20%28Christianity%29">Logos</a>—as either a begotten being (as in Arianism proper and <a href="Anomoeanism">Anomoeanism</a>) or as neither uncreated nor created in the sense other beings are created (as in <a href="Semi-Arianism">Semi-Arianism</a>).

Arius had been a pupil of <a href="Lucian%20of%20Antioch">Lucian of Antioch</a> at <a href="School%20of%20Antioch">Lucian's private academy in Antioch</a> and inherited from him a modified form of the teachings of <a href="Paul%20of%20Samosata">Paul of Samosata</a>. He taught that God the Father and the Son of God did not always exist together eternally. Arians taught that the Logos was a divine being begotten by God the Father before the creation of the world, made him a medium through whom everything else was created, and that the Son of God is subordinate to God the Father. A verse from Proverbs was also used: "The Lord created me at the beginning of his work" (<a href="Book%20of%20Proverbs">Proverbs</a> ). Therefore, the Son was rather the very first and the most perfect of God's creatures, and he was made "God" only by the Father's permission and power.

Controversy over Arianism arose in the late 3rd century and persisted throughout most of the 4th century. It involved most church members—from simple believers, priests, and monks to bishops, emperors, and members of Rome's imperial family. Two Roman emperors, <a href="Constantius%20II">Constantius II</a> and <a href="Valens">Valens</a>, became Arians or Semi-Arians, as did prominent <a href="Goths">Gothic</a>, <a href="Vandal">Vandal</a>, and <a href="Lombards">Lombard</a> warlords both before and after the <a href="fall%20of%20the%20Western%20Roman%20Empire">fall of the Western Roman Empire</a>. Such a deep controversy within the Church during this period of its development could not have materialized without significant historical influences providing a basis for the Arian doctrines. Of the roughly three hundred bishops in attendance at the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">Council of Nicea</a>, two bishops did not sign the <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Nicene Creed</a> that condemned Arianism. <a href="Constantine%20the%20Great">Emperor Constantine</a> also ordered a penalty of death for those who refused to surrender the Arian writings:

Reconstructing what Arius actually taught, and why, is a formidable task, both because little of his own work survives except in quotations selected for polemical purposes by his opponents, and also because there is no certainty about what theological and philosophical traditions formed his thought.

Arians do not believe in the traditional doctrine of the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a>. The letter of Arian Auxentius regarding the Arian missionary <a href="Ulfilas">Ulfilas</a> gives a picture of Arian beliefs. Arian <a href="Ulfilas">Ulfilas</a>, who was ordained a bishop by Arian <a href="Eusebius%20of%20Nicomedia">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a> and returned to his people to work as a missionary, believed: God, the Father, ("unbegotten" God; Almighty God) always existing and who is the only true God (John 17:3). The Son of God, Jesus Christ, ("only-begotten God" John 1:18; Mighty God Isaiah 9:6) begotten before time began (Proverbs 8:22-29; Revelation 3:14; Colossians 1:15) and who is Lord/Master (1 Cor 8:6). The Holy Spirit (the illuminating and sanctifying power, who is neither God the Father nor Lord/Master. <a href="First%20Epistle%20to%20the%20Corinthians">First Corinthians</a> - was cited as <a href="proof%20text">proof text</a>:

The creed of Arian <a href="Ulfilas">Ulfilas</a> (c. 311 – 383), which concludes a letter praising him written by Auxentius, distinguishes God the Father ("unbegotten"), who is the only true God from Son of God ("only-begotten"), who is Lord/Master; and the Holy Spirit, the illuminating and sanctifying power, who is neither God the Father nor Lord/Master:

A letter from <a href="Arius">Arius</a> (c. 250–336) to the Arian <a href="Eusebius%20of%20Nicomedia">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a> (died 341) succinctly states the core beliefs of the Arians:

According to <a href="Bart%20Ehrman">Bart Ehrman</a>, the dispute between Trinitarianism and Arianism was about:


Arianism had several different variants, including <a href="Eunomianism">Eunomianism</a> and <a href="Acacians">Homoian Arianism</a>. Homoian Arianism is associated with <a href="Acacius%20of%20Caesarea">Akakius</a> and <a href="Eudoxius%20of%20Antioch">Eudoxius</a>. Homoian Arianism avoided the use of the word "ousia" to describe the relation of Father to Son, and described these as "like" each other. Hanson lists twelve creeds that reflect the Homoian faith:

In 321, Arius was denounced by a <a href="synod">synod</a> at Alexandria for teaching a heterodox view of the relationship of Jesus to God the Father. Because Arius and his followers had great influence in the schools of Alexandria—counterparts to modern universities or seminaries—their theological views spread, especially in the eastern Mediterranean.

By 325, the controversy had become significant enough that the <a href="Emperor%20Constantine">Emperor Constantine</a> called an assembly of bishops, the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">First Council of Nicaea</a>, which condemned Arius's doctrine and formulated the original <a href="Nicene%20Creed%23The%20original%20Nicene%20Creed%20of%20325">Nicene Creed of 325</a>. The Nicene Creed's central term, used to describe the relationship between the Father and the Son, is <a href="Homoousios">Homoousios</a> (), or <a href="Consubstantiality">Consubstantiality</a>, meaning "of the same substance" or "of one being". (The <a href="Athanasian%20Creed">Athanasian Creed</a> is less often used but is a more overtly anti-Arian statement on the Trinity.)

The focus of the Council of Nicaea was the nature of the Son of God and his precise relationship to God the Father. (see <a href="Paul%20of%20Samosata">Paul of Samosata</a> and the <a href="Synods%20of%20Antioch">Synods of Antioch</a>). Arius taught that Jesus Christ was divine/holy and was sent to earth for the salvation of mankind but that Jesus Christ was not equal to God the Father (infinite, primordial origin) in rank "and" that God the Father and the Son of God were not equal to the Holy Spirit (power of God the Father). Under Arianism, Christ was instead not consubstantial with God the Father since both the Father and the Son under Arius were made of "like" essence or being (see <a href="homoiousia">homoiousia</a>) but not of the same essence or being (see <a href="homoousia">homoousia</a>).

In the Arian view, God the Father is a Deity and is divine "and" the Son of God is not a Deity but divine (I, the LORD, am Deity alone. Isaiah 46:9). God the Father sent Jesus to earth for salvation of mankind (John 17:3). <a href="Ousia">Ousia</a> is essence or being, in Eastern Christianity, and is the aspect of God that is completely incomprehensible to mankind and human perception. It is all that subsists by itself and which has not its being in another, God the Father and God the Son and God the Holy Spirit all being uncreated.

According to the teaching of Arius, the pre-existent Logos and thus the incarnate Jesus Christ was a begotten being; only the Son was directly begotten by God the Father, before ages, but was of a distinct, though similar, essence or substance from the Creator. His opponents argued that this would make Jesus less than God and that this was heretical. Much of the distinction between the differing factions was over the phrasing that Christ expressed in the New Testament to express submission to God the Father. The theological term for this submission is <a href="kenosis">kenosis</a>. This Ecumenical council declared that Jesus Christ was a distinct being of God in existence or reality (<a href="hypostasis%20%28philosophy%29">hypostasis</a>), which the Latin fathers translated as persona. Jesus was God in essence, being, and/or nature (ousia), which the Latin fathers translated as substantia.

Constantine is believed to have exiled those who refused to accept the Nicean creed—Arius himself, the deacon Euzoios, and the Libyan bishops Theonas of Marmarica and <a href="Secundus%20of%20Ptolemais">Secundus of Ptolemais</a>—and also the bishops who signed the creed but refused to join in condemnation of Arius, Eusebius of Nicomedia and <a href="Theognis%20of%20Nicaea">Theognis of Nicaea</a>. The Emperor also ordered all copies of the "Thalia", the book in which Arius had expressed his teachings, to be <a href="Book%20burning">burned</a>. However, there is no evidence that his son and ultimate successor, <a href="Constantius%20II">Constantius II</a>, who was an Arian Christian, was exiled.

Although he was committed to maintaining what the church had defined at Nicaea, Constantine was also bent on pacifying the situation and eventually became more lenient toward those condemned and exiled at the council. First he allowed Eusebius of Nicomedia, who was a protégé of his sister, and Theognis to return once they had signed an ambiguous statement of faith. The two, and other friends of Arius, worked for Arius's rehabilitation.

At the <a href="First%20Synod%20of%20Tyre">First Synod of Tyre</a> in AD 335, they brought accusations against <a href="Pope%20Athanasius%20I%20of%20Alexandria">Athanasius</a>, now bishop of Alexandria, the primary opponent of Arius. After this, Constantine had Athanasius banished since he considered him an impediment to reconciliation. In the same year, the Synod of Jerusalem under Constantine's direction readmitted <a href="Arius">Arius</a> to communion in AD 336. Arius died on the way to this event in Constantinople. Some scholars suggest that Arius may have been poisoned by his opponents. Eusebius and Theognis remained in the Emperor's favor, and when Constantine, who had been a <a href="catechumen">catechumen</a> much of his adult life, accepted <a href="baptism">baptism</a> on his deathbed, it was from Eusebius of Nicomedia.

The historian <a href="Jacob%20Burckhardt">Jacob Burckhardt</a> wrote of the Council: 
The Council of Nicaea did not end the controversy, as many bishops of the Eastern provinces disputed the "<a href="homoousios">homoousios</a>", the central term of the Nicene creed, as it had been used by <a href="Paul%20of%20Samosata">Paul of Samosata</a>, who had advocated a <a href="Monarchianism">monarchianist</a> <a href="Christology">Christology</a>. Both the man and his teaching, including the term "homoousios", had been condemned by the <a href="Synods%20of%20Antioch">Synods of Antioch</a> in 269.

Hence, after Constantine's death in 337, open dispute resumed again. Constantine's son <a href="Constantius%20II">Constantius II</a>, who had become Emperor of the eastern part of the Empire, actually encouraged the Arians and set out to reverse the Nicene creed. His advisor in these affairs was Eusebius of Nicomedia, who had already at the Council of Nicea been the head of the Arian party, who also was made bishop of Constantinople.

Constantius used his power to exile bishops adhering to the Nicene creed, especially St <a href="Athanasius%20of%20Alexandria">Athanasius of Alexandria</a>, who fled to Rome. In 355 Constantius became the sole Emperor and extended his pro-Arian policy toward the western provinces, frequently using force to push through his creed, even exiling <a href="Pope%20Liberius">Pope Liberius</a> and installing <a href="Antipope%20Felix%20II">Antipope Felix II</a>.

The third <a href="Council%20of%20Sirmium">Council of Sirmium</a> in 357 was the high point of Arianism. The Seventh Arian Confession (Second Sirmium Confession) held that both "homoousios" (of one substance) and "homoiousios" (of similar substance) were unbiblical and that the Father is greater than the Son. (This confession was later known as the Blasphemy of Sirmium.)
But since many persons are disturbed by questions concerning what is called in Latin "substantia", but in Greek "ousia", that is, to make it understood more exactly, as to 'coessential,' or what is called, 'like-in-essence,' there ought to be no mention of any of these at all, nor exposition of them in the Church, for this reason and for this consideration, that in divine Scripture nothing is written about them, and that they are above men's knowledge and above men's understanding;

As debates raged in an attempt to come up with a new formula, three camps evolved among the opponents of the Nicene creed. The first group mainly opposed the Nicene terminology and preferred the term "homoiousios" (alike in substance) to the Nicene "homoousios", while they rejected Arius and his teaching and accepted the equality and coeternality of the persons of the Trinity. Because of this centrist position, and despite their rejection of Arius, they were called "semi-Arians" by their opponents. The second group also avoided invoking the name of Arius, but in large part followed Arius' teachings and, in another attempted compromise wording, described the Son as being like ("<a href="Acacians">homoios</a>") the Father. A third group explicitly called upon Arius and described the Son as unlike ("<a href="Anomoeanism">anhomoios</a>") the Father. Constantius wavered in his support between the first and the second party, while harshly persecuting the third.

<a href="Epiphanius%20of%20Salamis">Epiphanius of Salamis</a> labelled the party of <a href="Basil%20of%20Ancyra">Basil of Ancyra</a> in 358 "<a href="Semi-Arianism">Semi-Arianism</a>". This is considered unfair by Kelly who states that some members of the group were virtually orthodox from the start but disliked the adjective "homoousios" while others had moved in that direction after the out-and-out Arians had come into the open.

The debates among these groups resulted in numerous synods, among them the <a href="Council%20of%20Sardica">Council of Sardica</a> in 343, the <a href="Council%20of%20Sirmium">Council of Sirmium</a> in 358 and the double <a href="Council%20of%20Rimini">Council of Rimini</a> and Seleucia in 359, and no fewer than fourteen further creed formulas between 340 and 360, leading the pagan observer <a href="Ammianus%20Marcellinus">Ammianus Marcellinus</a> to comment sarcastically: "The highways were covered with galloping bishops." None of these attempts were acceptable to the defenders of Nicene orthodoxy: writing about the latter councils, Saint <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> remarked that the world "awoke with a groan to find itself Arian."

After Constantius' death in 361, his successor <a href="Julian%20%28emperor%29">Julian</a>, a devotee of <a href="State%20religion%20of%20Rome">Rome's pagan gods</a>, declared that he would no longer attempt to favor one church faction over another, and allowed all exiled bishops to return; this resulted in further increasing dissension among Nicene Christians. The Emperor <a href="Valens">Valens</a>, however, revived Constantius' policy and supported the "Homoian" party, exiling bishops and often using force. During this persecution many bishops were exiled to the other ends of the Empire, (e.g., <a href="St%20Hilary%20of%20Poitiers">St Hilary of Poitiers</a> to the Eastern provinces). These contacts and the common plight subsequently led to a rapprochement between the Western supporters of the Nicene creed and the "homoousios" and the Eastern semi-Arians.

It was not until the co-reigns of Gratian and Theodosius that Arianism was effectively wiped out among the ruling class and elite of the Eastern Empire. Theodosius' wife St <a href="Aelia%20Flacilla">Flacilla</a> was instrumental in his campaign to end Arianism. Valens died in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Adrianople%20%28378%29">Battle of Adrianople</a> in 378 and was succeeded by <a href="Theodosius%20I">Theodosius I</a>, who adhered to the Nicene creed. This allowed for settling the dispute.

Two days after Theodosius arrived in Constantinople, 24 November 380, he expelled the <a href="Homoiousian">Homoiousian</a> bishop, <a href="Demophilus%20of%20Constantinople">Demophilus of Constantinople</a>, and surrendered the churches of that city to <a href="Gregory%20Nazianzus">Gregory Nazianzus</a>, the leader of the rather small Nicene community there, an act which provoked rioting. Theodosius had just been baptized, by bishop Acholius of Thessalonica, during a severe illness, as was common in the early Christian world. In February he and <a href="Gratian">Gratian</a> had published an edict that all their subjects should profess the faith of the bishops of Rome and Alexandria (i.e., the Nicene faith), or be handed over for punishment for not doing so.

Although much of the church hierarchy in the East had opposed the Nicene creed in the decades leading up to Theodosius' accession, he managed to achieve unity on the basis of the Nicene creed. In 381, at the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Constantinople">Second Ecumenical Council</a> in Constantinople, a group of mainly Eastern bishops assembled and accepted the <a href="Nicene-Constantinopolitan%20Creed">Nicene Creed of 381</a>, which was supplemented in regard to the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>, as well as some other changes: see <a href="Comparison%20of%20Nicene%20Creeds%20of%20325%20and%20381">Comparison between Creed of 325 and Creed of 381</a>. This is generally considered the end of the dispute about the Trinity and the end of Arianism among the Roman, non-Germanic peoples.

During the time of Arianism's flowering in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, the Gothic convert <a href="Ulfilas">Ulfilas</a> (later the subject of the letter of Auxentius cited above) was sent as a missionary to the Gothic barbarians across the <a href="Danube%20River">Danube</a>, a mission favored for political reasons by emperor Constantius II. Ulfilas' initial success in converting this Germanic people to an Arian form of Christianity was strengthened by later events. When the Germanic peoples entered the provinces of the <a href="Western%20Roman%20Empire">Western Roman Empire</a> and began founding their own kingdoms there, most had been Arian Christians for more than a century.

The conflict in the 4th century AD had seen Arian and Nicene factions struggling for control of the Church. In contrast, among the Arian German kingdoms established in the collapsing Western Empire in the 5th century, there were entirely separate Arian and Nicene Churches with parallel hierarchies, each serving different sets of believers. The Germanic elites were Arians, and the Romance majority population was Nicene.

Most Germanic tribes were generally tolerant of the Nicene beliefs of their subjects. However, the Vandals tried for several decades to force their Arian beliefs on their North African Nicene subjects, exiling Nicene clergy, dissolving monasteries, and exercising heavy pressure on non-conforming Nicene Christians.

The apparent resurgence of Arianism after Nicaea was more an anti-Nicene reaction exploited by Arian sympathizers than a pro-Arian development. By the end of the 4th century it had surrendered its remaining ground to <a href="Trinitarianism">Trinitarianism</a>. In western Europe, Arianism, which had been taught by <a href="Ulfilas">Ulfilas</a>, the Arian missionary to the barbarian Germanic tribes, was dominant among the <a href="Goths">Goths</a>, <a href="Lombards">Lombards</a> and <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a>. By the 8th century it had ceased to be the tribes' mainstream belief as the tribal rulers gradually came to adopt Nicene orthodoxy. This trend began in 496 with Clovis I of the Franks, then <a href="Reccared%20I">Reccared I</a> of the <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> in 587 and <a href="Aripert%20I">Aripert I</a> of the <a href="Lombards">Lombards</a> in 653.

The <a href="Franks">Franks</a> and the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> were unlike the other Germanic peoples in that they entered the empire as pagans and converted to <a href="Chalcedonian%20Christianity">Chalcedonian Christianity</a> directly, guided by their kings, <a href="Clovis%20I">Clovis</a> and <a href="%C3%86thelberht%20of%20Kent">Æthelberht of Kent</a>. The remaining tribes – the Vandals and the Ostrogoths – did not convert as a people nor did they maintain territorial cohesion. Having been militarily defeated by the armies of <a href="Emperor%20Justinian%20I">Emperor Justinian I</a>, the remnants were dispersed to the fringes of the empire and became lost to history. The <a href="Vandalic%20War">Vandalic War</a> of 533–534 dispersed the defeated Vandals. Following their final defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mons%20Lactarius">Battle of Mons Lactarius</a> in 553, the <a href="Ostrogoths">Ostrogoths</a> went back north and (re)settled in south Austria.
Much of south-eastern Europe and <a href="central%20Europe">central Europe</a>, including many of the <a href="Goths">Goths</a> and <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a> respectively, had embraced Arianism (the <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> converted to Arian Christianity in 376), which led to Arianism being a religious factor in various wars in the Roman Empire. In the west, organized Arianism survived in <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, in Hispania, and parts of Italy until it was finally suppressed in the 6th and 7th centuries. <a href="Grimoald%20I%20of%20Benevento">Grimwald</a>, <a href="King%20of%20the%20Lombards">King of the Lombards</a> (662–671), and his young son and successor <a href="Garibald">Garibald</a> (671), were the last Arian kings in Europe.

Following the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> from 1517, it did not take long for Arian and other <a href="non-trinitarian">non-trinitarian</a> views to resurface. The first recorded English <a href="antitrinitarian">antitrinitarian</a> was <a href="John%20Assheton">John Assheton</a> who was forced to recant before <a href="Thomas%20Cranmer">Thomas Cranmer</a> in 1548. At the <a href="Anabaptist">Anabaptist</a> <a href="Council%20of%20Venice">Council of Venice</a> 1550, the early Italian instigators of the <a href="Radical%20Reformation">Radical Reformation</a> committed to the views of <a href="Servetus">Miguel Servetus</a> (burned alive by <a href="John%20Calvin">Calvin</a> in 1553), and these were promulgated by <a href="Giorgio%20Biandrata">Giorgio Biandrata</a> and others into Poland and Transylvania.

The antitrinitarian wing of the Polish Reformation separated from the <a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> "ecclesia maior" to form the "ecclesia minor" or <a href="Polish%20Brethren">Polish Brethren</a>. These were commonly referred to as "Arians" due to their rejection of the Trinity, though in fact the <a href="Socinians">Socinians</a>, as they were later known, went further than Arius to the position of <a href="Photinus">Photinus</a>. The epithet "Arian" was also applied to the early <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarians</a> such as <a href="John%20Biddle%20%28Unitarian%29">John Biddle</a> though in denial of the <a href="pre-existence%20of%20Christ">pre-existence of Christ</a> they were again largely Socinians not Arians.

In the 18th century the "dominant trend" in Britain, particularly in <a href="Latitudinarianism">Latitudinarianism</a>, was towards Arianism, with which the names of <a href="Samuel%20Clarke">Samuel Clarke</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20Hoadly">Benjamin Hoadly</a>, <a href="William%20Whiston">William Whiston</a> and <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a> are associated. To quote the "Encyclopædia Britannica" article on Arianism: "In modern times some <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarians</a> are virtually Arians in that they are unwilling either to reduce Christ to a mere human being or to attribute to him a divine nature identical with that of the Father." However, their doctrines cannot be considered representative of traditional Arian doctrines or vice versa.

A similar view was held by the ancient anti-Nicene <a href="Pneumatomachi">Pneumatomachi</a> (<a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>: , "breath" or "spirit" and "fighters", combining as "fighters against the spirit"), so called because they opposed the deifying of the Nicene Holy Ghost. However, the Pneumatomachi were adherents of <a href="Macedonianism">Macedonianism</a>, and though their beliefs were somewhat reminiscent of Arianism, they were distinct enough to be distinguishably different.

The <a href="Iglesia%20ni%20Cristo">Iglesia ni Cristo</a> is one of the largest groups that teaches a similar doctrine, though they are really closer to Socinianism, believing the Word in John 1:1 is God's plan of salvation, not Christ. So Christ did not preexist.

<a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> are often referred to as "modern-day Arians" or they are sometimes referred to as "<a href="Semi-Arians">Semi-Arians</a>", usually by their opponents. While there are some significant similarities in theology and doctrine, the Witnesses differ from Arians by saying that the Son can fully know the Father (something which Arius himself denied), and by their denial of personality to the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>. The original Arians also generally prayed directly to Jesus, whereas the Witnesses pray to God, through Jesus as a mediator.

The teachings of the first two ecumenical councils – which entirely reject Arianism – are held by the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>, the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>, the <a href="Oriental%20Orthodox%20Churches">Oriental Orthodox Churches</a>, the <a href="Assyrian%20Church%20of%20the%20East">Assyrian Church of the East</a> and all churches founded during the <a href="Reformation">Reformation</a> in the 16th century or influenced by it (<a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a>, <a href="Calvinism">Reformed</a>/<a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a>, and <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a>). Also, nearly all <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a> groups (such as <a href="Methodism">Methodists</a>, <a href="Baptists">Baptists</a>, and most <a href="Pentecostalism">Pentecostals</a>) entirely reject the teachings associated with Arianism. Modern groups which currently appear to embrace some of the principles of Arianism include <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarians</a> and <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a>. Although the origins of their beliefs are not necessarily attributed to the teachings of Arius, many of the core beliefs of Unitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses are entirely similar to them.

The <a href="Church%20of%20God%20%287th%20day%29%20-%20Salem%20Conference">Church of God (7th day) - Salem Conference</a> can be considered Arian:
Other groups which oppose the belief in the Trinity are not necessarily Arian.

Antoninus Pius

Antoninus Pius (; 19 September 867 March 161), also known as Antoninus, was <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a> from 138 to 161. He was one of the <a href="Five%20Good%20Emperors">Five Good Emperors</a> in the <a href="Nerva%E2%80%93Antonine%20dynasty">Nerva–Antonine dynasty</a> and the <a href="Aurelia%20%28gens%29">Aurelii</a>.

Born into a senatorial family, Antoninus held various offices during the reign of emperor <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>, acquiring favour which saw him adopted as Hadrian's son and successor shortly before Hadrian's death. He acquired the <a href="cognomen">name</a> <a href="Pius">Pius</a> after his accession to the throne, either because he compelled the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Senate</a> to <a href="Imperial%20cult%20%28ancient%20Rome%29">deify</a> his adoptive father <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>, or because he had saved senators sentenced to death by Hadrian in his later years.

His reign is notable for the peaceful state of the Empire, with no major revolts or military incursions during this time, and for his governing without ever leaving Italy. A successful military campaign in southern Scotland early in his reign resulted in the construction of the <a href="Antonine%20Wall">Antonine Wall</a>. Antoninus was an effective administrator, leaving his successors a large surplus in the treasury, expanding free access to drinking water throughout the Empire, encouraging legal conformity, and facilitating the enfranchisement of freed slaves.

He died of illness in 161 and was succeeded by his adopted sons <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a> and <a href="Lucius%20Verus">Lucius Verus</a> as co-emperors. He was the last Roman emperor to have been born in the first century AD.

He was born as the only child of <a href="Titus%20Aurelius%20Fulvus">Titus Aurelius Fulvus</a>, <a href="consul">consul</a> in 89 whose family came from <a href="Nemausus">Nemausus</a> (modern <a href="N%C3%AEmes">Nîmes</a>). Titus Aurelius Fulvius was the son of a senator of the same name, who, as legate of <a href="Legio%20III%20Gallica">Legio III Gallica</a>, had supported <a href="Vespasian">Vespasian</a> in his bid to the Imperial office and been rewarded with a suffect consulship, plus an ordinary one under <a href="Domitian">Domitian</a> in 85. The Aurelii Fulvii were therefore a relatively new senatorial family from <a href="Gallia%20Narbonensis">Gallia Narbonensis</a> whose rise to prominence was supported by the <a href="Flavian%20dynasty">Flavians</a>. The link between Antoninus' family and their home province explains the increasing importance of the post of <a href="Proconsul">Proconsul</a> of Gallia Narbonensis during the late Second Century.

Antoninus was born near <a href="Lanuvium">Lanuvium</a> and his mother was Arria Fadilla. Antoninus’ father died shortly after his 89 ordinary consulship, his son being raised by his maternal grandfather <a href="Gnaeus%20Arrius%20Antoninus">Gnaeus Arrius Antoninus</a>, reputed by contemporaries to be a man of integrity and culture and a friend of <a href="Pliny%20the%20Younger">Pliny the Younger</a>. The Arrii Antoninii were an older senatorial family from Italy, very influential during <a href="Nerva">Nerva</a>'s reign. Arria Fadilla, Antoninus' mother, married afterwards Publius Julius Lupus, a man of consular rank, suffect consul in 98, and two daughters, Arria Lupula and Julia Fadilla, were born from that union.

Some time between 110 and 115, Antoninus married Annia Galeria <a href="Faustina%20the%20Elder">Faustina the Elder</a>. They are believed to have enjoyed a happy marriage. Faustina was the daughter of consul <a href="Marcus%20Annius%20Verus">Marcus Annius Verus</a> and <a href="Rupilia">Rupilia</a> Faustina (a half-sister to Roman Empress <a href="Vibia%20Sabina">Vibia Sabina</a>). Faustina was a beautiful woman, and despite (basically unproven) rumours about her character, it is clear that Antoninus cared for her deeply.

Faustina bore Antoninus four children, two sons and two daughters. They were:

When Faustina died in 141, Antoninus was greatly distressed. In honour of her memory, he asked the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Senate</a> to deify her as a goddess, and authorised the construction of a temple to be built in the <a href="Roman%20Forum">Roman Forum</a> in her name, with priestesses serving in her temple. He had various coins with her portrait struck in her honor. These coins were scripted ‘DIVA FAUSTINA’ and were elaborately decorated. He further created a charity which he founded and called it "Puellae Faustinianae" or "Girls of Faustina", which assisted destitute girls of good family. Finally, Antoninus created a new "alimenta" (see <a href="Grain%20supply%20to%20the%20city%20of%20Rome">Grain supply to the city of Rome</a>).

The emperor never remarried. Instead, he lived with Galena Lysistrata, one of Faustina's freed women. <a href="Concubinage">Concubinage</a> was a form of female companionship sometimes chosen by powerful men in Ancient Rome, especially widowers like Vespasian, and Marcus Aurelius. Their union could not produce any legitimate offspring who could threaten any heirs, such as those of Antoninus. Also, as one could not have a wife and an official concubine (or two concubines) at the same time, Antoninus avoided being pressed into a marriage with a noblewoman from another family (Later, Marcus Aurelius would also reject the advances of his former fiancee Ceionia Fabia, Lucius Verus's sister, on the grounds of protecting his children from a stepmother, and took a concubine instead).

Having filled the offices of <a href="quaestor">quaestor</a> and <a href="praetor">praetor</a> with more than usual success, he obtained the consulship in 120. He was next appointed by the Emperor <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a> as one of the four <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a>s to administer <a href="Italia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Italia</a>, then greatly increased his reputation by his conduct as <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a> of <a href="Asia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Asia</a>, probably during 134–135.

He acquired much favor with the Emperor Hadrian, who adopted him as his son and successor on 25 February 138, after the death of his first adopted son <a href="Lucius%20Aelius">Lucius Aelius</a>, on the condition that Antoninus would in turn adopt Marcus Annius Verus, the son of his wife's brother, and Lucius, son of Lucius Aelius, who afterwards became the emperors <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a> and <a href="Lucius%20Verus">Lucius Verus</a>.

By this scheme, Verus, who was already Hadrian's adoptive grandson through his natural father, remained Hadrian's adoptive grandson through his new father. The adoption of Marcus Aurelius was probably a suggestion of Antoninus himself, since the former was the nephew of the latter's wife and would be his favorite son.

On his accession, Antoninus' name and style became "<a href="Imperator">Imperator</a> <a href="Caesar%20%28title%29">Caesar</a> Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus <a href="Augustus%20%28honorific%29">Augustus</a> <a href="Pontifex%20Maximus">Pontifex Maximus</a>". One of his first acts as Emperor was to persuade the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Senate</a> to grant divine honours to Hadrian, which they had at first refused; his efforts to persuade the Senate to grant these honours is the most likely reason given for his title of "Pius" (dutiful in affection; compare "<a href="pietas">pietas</a>"). Two other reasons for this title are that he would support his aged father-in-law with his hand at Senate meetings, and that he had saved those men that Hadrian, during his period of ill-health, had condemned to death.

Immediately after Hadrian's death, Antoninus approached Marcus and requested that his marriage arrangements be amended: Marcus' betrothal to Ceionia Fabia would be annulled, and he would be betrothed to Faustina, Antoninus' daughter, instead. Faustina's betrothal to Ceionia's brother Lucius Commodus would also have to be annulled. Marcus consented to Antoninus' proposal.

Antoninus built temples, theaters, and mausoleums, promoted the arts and sciences, and bestowed honours and financial rewards upon the teachers of <a href="rhetoric">rhetoric</a> and <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>. Antoninus made few initial changes when he became emperor, leaving intact as far as possible the arrangements instituted by Hadrian. Epigraphical and prosopographical research has revealed that Antoninus' imperial ruling team centered around a group of closely knit senatorial families, most of them members of the priestly congregation for the cult of Hadrian, the "sodales Hadrianales". According to the German historian <a href="Hans-Georg%20Pflaum">H.G. Pflaum</a>, prosopographical research of Antoninus' ruling team allows us to grasp the deeply conservative character of the ruling senatorial <a href="caste">caste</a>

There are no records of any military related acts in his time in which he participated. One modern scholar has written "It is almost certain not only that at no time in his life did he ever see, let alone command, a Roman army, but that, throughout the twenty-three years of his reign, he never went within five hundred miles of a legion".

His reign was the most peaceful in the entire history of the <a href="Principate">Principate</a>; notwithstanding the fact that there were several military disturbances throughout the Empire in his time. Such disturbances happened in <a href="Mauretania">Mauretania</a> – where a senator was named as governor of <a href="Mauretania%20Tingitana">Mauretania Tingitana</a> in place of the usual equestrian procurator and cavalry reinforcements from Panonnia were brought in, towns such as <a href="Sala%20Colonia">Sala</a> and <a href="Tipasa">Tipasa</a> being fortified. Similar disturbances took place in <a href="Iudaea%20Province">Iudaea</a>, and amongst the <a href="Brigantes">Brigantes</a> in <a href="Roman%20Britain">Britannia</a>, none of them being considered serious. It was however in Britain that Antoninus decided to follow a new, more aggressive path, with the appointment of a new governor in 139, <a href="Quintus%20Lollius%20Urbicus">Quintus Lollius Urbicus</a> a native of <a href="Numidia">Numidia</a> and previously governor of <a href="Germania%20Inferior">Germania Inferior</a>.

Under instructions from the emperor, Lollius undertook an invasion of southern <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, winning some significant victories, and constructing the <a href="Antonine%20Wall">Antonine Wall</a> from the <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a> to the <a href="Firth%20of%20Clyde">Firth of Clyde</a>. The wall, however, was soon gradually decommissioned during the mid-150s and eventually abandoned late during the reign (early 160s), for reasons that are still not quite clear. Antonine's Wall is mentioned in just one literary source, Antoninus' biography in the <a href="Historia%20Augusta">Historia Augusta</a>. <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> makes a brief and confused mention of a war in Britain. In one inscription honoring Antoninus, erected by <a href="Legio%20II%20Augusta">Legio II Augusta</a>, which participated in the building of the Wall, a <a href="The%20Bridgeness%20Slab">relief</a> showing four naked prisoners, one of them beheaded, seems to stand for some actual warfare.

Although Antonine's Wall was, in principle, much shorter and at first sight more defensible than Hadrian's Wall, the additional area that it enclosed within the Empire was barren, with the effect that supply lines to it were strained enough that the costs from maintaining the additional territory outweighed the benefits of doing so. It has been therefore speculated that the invasion of Lowland Scotland and the building of the wall had to do mostly with internal politics, that is, offering Antoninus an opportunity to gain some modicum of necessary military prestige at the start of his reign. Actually, the campaign in Britannia was followed by an Imperial salutation – that is, by Antoninus formally taking for the second (and last) time the title of <a href="Imperator">Imperator</a> – in 142. The fact that around the same time coins were struck announcing a victory in Britain points to Antoninus' need to publicize his achievements. The orator <a href="Marcus%20Cornelius%20Fronto">Fronto</a> was later to say that, although Antoninus bestowed the direction of the British campaign to others, he should be regarded as the helmsman who directed the voyage, whose glory, therefore, belonged to him.

That this quest for some military achievement responded to an actual need, is proved by the fact that, although generally peaceful, Antoninus' reign was not free from attempts of usurpation: <a href="Historia%20Augusta">Historia Augusta</a> mentions two, made by senators Cornelius Priscianus (by the way, Lollius Urbicus' successor as governor of Britain) and Atilius Rufius Titianus – both confirmed by the <a href="Fasti%20Ostienses">Fasti Ostienses</a> as well as by the erasing of Priscianus' name from an inscription In both cases, Antoninus was not in formal charge of the ensuing repression: Priscianus committed suicide and Titianus was found guilty by the Senate, with Antoninus abstaining from sequestering their families' properties

There were also some troubles in <a href="Dacia%20Inferior">Dacia Inferior</a> which required the granting of additional powers to the <a href="Procurator%20%28Roman%29">procurator</a> governor and the dispatchment of additional soldiers to the province. On the Northern <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> coast, the Greek city of <a href="Olbia%2C%20Ukraine">Olbia</a> was held against the <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a>. Also during his reign the governor of <a href="Upper%20Germany">Upper Germany</a>, probably Caius Popillius Carus Pedo, built new fortifications in the <a href="Agri%20Decumates">Agri Decumates</a>, advancing the <a href="Limes%20Germanicus">Limes Germanicus</a> fifteen miles forward in his province and neighboring <a href="Raetia">Raetia</a>. In the East, Roman suzerainty over <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> was retained by the 140 choosing of <a href="Arsacid%20dynasty%20of%20Armenia">Arsacid</a> scion <a href="Sohaemus%20of%20Armenia">Sohaemus</a> as client king.

Nevertheless, Antoninus was virtually unique among emperors in that he dealt with these crises without leaving Italy once during his reign, but instead dealt with provincial matters of war and peace through their governors or through imperial letters to the cities such as Ephesus (of which some were publicly displayed). This style of government was highly praised by his contemporaries and by later generations.

Antoninus was the last Roman Emperor recognised by the Indian Kingdoms. Raoul McLaughlin quotes Aurelius Victor as saying " The Indians, the Bactrians and the Hyrcanians all sent ambassadors to Antoninus. They had all heard about the spirit of justice held by this great emperor, justice that was heightened by his handsome and grave countenance, and his slim and vigorous figure." Due to the outbreak of the Antonine epidemic and wars against northern Germanic tribes, the reign of Marcus Aurelius was forced to alter the focus of foreign policies and matters of the Far East was increasingly abandoned in favour of those directly concerning the Empire's survival.

Antoninus was regarded as a skilled administrator and as a builder. In spite of an extensive building directive – the free access of the people of Rome to drinking water was expanded with the construction of aqueducts, not only in Rome but throughout the Empire, as well as bridges and roads – the emperor still managed to leave behind a sizable public treasury of around two and a half million <a href="Sestertius">sesterces</a> (Rome would not witness another Emperor leaving his successor with a surplus for a long time.) But this treasury was depleted almost immediately after Antoninus's reign due to the plague brought back by soldiers after the Parthian victory).

The Emperor also famously suspended the collection of taxes from cities affected by natural disasters, such as when fires struck Rome and Narbona, and earthquakes affected <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a> and the <a href="Province%20of%20Asia">Province of Asia</a>. He offered hefty financial grants for rebuilding and recovery of various Greek cities after two serious earthquakes: the first, "circa" 140, which affected mostly Rhodes and other islands; the second, in 152, which hit <a href="Cyzicus">Cyzicus</a> – where the huge and newly built Temple to Hadrian was destroyed – <a href="Ephesus">Ephesus</a> and <a href="Smyrna">Smyrna</a>. Antoninus' financial help earned him praise by Greek writers such as <a href="Aelius%20Aristides">Aelius Aristides</a> and Pausanias. These cities received from Antoninus the usual honorific accolades, such as when he commended that all governors of Asia should enter the province, when taking office, by way of Ephesus. Ephesus was specially favoured by Antoninus, who confirmed and upheld its first place in the list of imperial honor titles, as opposed to Smyrna and <a href="Pergamon">Pergamon</a>.

In his dealings with Greek-speaking cities, Antoninus followed the policy adopted by Hadrian of ingratiating himself with local elites, specially with local intellectuals: philosophers, teachers of literature, rhetoricians and physicians were explicitly exempted from any duties involving private spending for civic purposes – a privilege granted by Hadrian that Antoninus confirmed by means of an edict preserved in the <a href="Digest%20%28Roman%20law%29">Digest</a> (27.1.6.8). Antoninus also created a chair for the teaching of rhetoric in <a href="Athens">Athens</a>.

Antoninus was known as an avid observer of rites of religion and of formal celebrations – both Roman and foreign. He is known for having increasingly formalized the official cult offered to the <a href="Cybele">Great Mother</a>, which from his reign onwards included a bull sacrifice, a <a href="taurobolium">taurobolium</a>, formerly only a private ritual, now being also performed for the sake of the Emperor's welfare. Antoninus also offered patronage to the worship of <a href="Mithraism">Mithras</a>, to whom he erected a temple in <a href="Ostia%20Antica">Ostia</a>. In 148, he presided over the celebrations of the 900th anniversary of the founding of Rome.

Antoninus tried to portray himself as a magistrate of the "res publica", no matter how extended and ill-defined his competences were. He is credited with the splitting of the imperial treasury, the <a href="Fiscus">Fiscus</a>. This splitting had to do with the division of imperial properties into two parts: firstly, the fiscus itself – or "patrimonium", meaning the properties of the "Crown", the hereditary properties of each succeeding person that sat on the throne, transmitted to his successors in office, regardless of their being members of the imperial family or not; secondly, the "res privata", the "private" properties tied to the personal maintenance of the Emperor and his family. An anecdote in the <a href="Historia%20Augusta">Historia Augusta</a> biography, where Antoninus replies to Faustina – who complained about his stinginess – that "we have gained an empire [and] lost even what we had before" possibly relates to Antoninus' actual concerns at the creation of the "res privata". While still a private citizen, Antoninus had increased his personal fortune greatly by mean of various legacies, the consequence – we are told – of his caring scrupulously for his relatives.

The "res privata" lands could be sold and/or given away, while the "patrimonium" properties were regarded as public. It was a way of pretending that the Imperial function – and most properties attached to it – was a public one, formally subject to the authority of the Senate and the Roman people. That the distinction played no part in subsequent political history – that the "personal" power of the princeps absorbed his role as office-holder – proves that the autocratic logic of the imperial order had already subsumed the old republican institutions.

Of the public transactions of this period there is only the scantiest of information, but, to judge by what is extant, those twenty-two years were not remarkably eventful in comparison to those before and after the reign. However, Antoninus did take a great interest in the revision and practice of the law throughout the empire. One of his chief concerns was to having local communities conform their legal procedures to existing Roman norms: in a case concerning repression of banditry by local police officers ("irenarchs") in Asia Minor, Antoninus ordered that these officers should not treat suspects as already condemned, and also keep a detailed copy of their interrogations, to be used in the possibility of an appeal to the Roman governor. Also, although Antoninus was not an innovator, he would not always follow the absolute letter of the law; rather he was driven by concerns over humanity and equality, and introduced into <a href="Roman%20law">Roman law</a> many important new principles based upon this notion.

In this, the emperor was assisted by five chief lawyers: L. Fulvius Aburnius Valens, an author of legal treatises; L. Ulpius Marcellus, a prolific writer; and three others . These last three included L. Volusius Maecianus, a former military officer turned by Antoninus into a civil procurator, and who, in view of his subsequent career (discovered on the basis of epigraphical and prosopographical research) was the Emperor's most important legal adviser. Maecianus would eventually be chosen to occupy various prefectures (see below) as well as to conduct the legal studies of Marcus Aurelius. He was also the author of a large work on Fidei Commissa (Testamentary Trusts). As a hallmark of the increased connection between jurists and the imperial government, Antoninus' reign also saw the appearance of the "Institutes of Gaius", an elementary legal manual for beginners (see <a href="Gaius%20%28jurist%29">Gaius (jurist)</a>).

Antoninus passed measures to facilitate the <a href="enfranchisement">enfranchisement</a> of <a href="slavery">slaves</a>. Mostly, he favoured the principle of "favor libertatis", giving the putative freedman the benefit of the doubt when the claim to freedom was not clearcut. Also, he punished the killing of a slave by his/her master without previous trial and determined that slaves could be forcibly sold to another master by a <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a> in cases of consistent mistreatment. Antoninus upheld the enforcement of contracts for selling of female slaves forbidding their further employment in prostitution. In criminal law, Antoninus introduced the important principle that accused persons are <a href="Presumption%20of%20innocence">not to be treated as guilty before trial</a> – as in the case of the irenarchs (see above). He also asserted the principle that the trial was to be held, and the punishment inflicted, in the place where the crime had been committed. He mitigated the use of <a href="torture">torture</a> in examining slaves by certain limitations. Thus he prohibited the application of torture to children under fourteen years, though this rule had exceptions. However, it must be stressed that Antoninus "extended", by means of a <a href="rescript">rescript</a>, the use of torture as a means of obtaining evidence to pecuniary cases, when it had been applied up until then only in criminal cases. Also, already at the time torture of free men of low status ("humiliores") had become legal, as proved by the fact that Antoninus exempted town councillors expressly from it, and also free men of high rank ("honestiores") in general.

One highlight during his reign occurred in 148, with the nine-hundredth anniversary of the foundation of <a href="Rome">Rome</a> being celebrated by the hosting of magnificent games in Rome. It lasted a number of days, and a host of exotic animals were killed, including elephants, giraffes, tigers, rhinoceroses, crocodiles and hippopotami. While this increased Antoninus’s popularity, the frugal emperor had to debase the <a href="Roman%20currency">Roman currency</a>. He decreased the silver purity of the denarius from 89% to 83.5% — the actual silver weight dropping from 2.88 grams to 2.68 grams.

Scholars place Antoninus Pius as the leading candidate for fulfilling the role as a friend of Rabbi <a href="Judah%20haNasi">Judah the Prince</a>. According to the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> (Avodah Zarah 10a-b), Rabbi Judah was very wealthy and greatly revered in Rome. He had a close friendship with "Antoninus", possibly Antoninus Pius, who would consult Rabbi Judah on various worldly and spiritual matters.

In 156, Antoninus Pius turned 70. He found it difficult to keep himself upright without <a href="corset">stays</a>. He started nibbling on dry bread to give him the strength to stay awake through his morning receptions. Marcus Aurelius had already been created consul with Antoninus in 140, receiving the title of <a href="Caesar%20%28title%29">Caesar</a> – i.e., heir apparent. As Antoninus aged, Marcus would take on more administrative duties, more still after the deathin 156 or 157of one of Antoninus' most trusted advisers, Gavius Maximus, who had been <a href="praetorian%20prefect">praetorian prefect</a> (an office that was as much secretarial as military) for twenty years. Gavius Maximus, who had been one of the most important members of Antoninus' "team" of long standing advisers, had been awarded with the consular insignia and to the honors due to a senator. He had left behind himself the reputation of being a most strict disciplinarian ("vir severissimus", according to "Historia Augusta") as well as some lasting grudges among fellow equestrian procurators – one of them, by predeceasing Gavius and vilifying him in his will, created a serious embarrassment to one of the heirs, the orator Fronto. Gavius Maximus' death offered the opportunity to a welcome change in the ruling team, and it has been speculated that it was the legal adviser Volusius Maecianus – who, after a brief spell as Praefect of Egypt, took the office of <a href="Praefectus%20annonae">Praefectus annonae</a> in Rome – who assumed the role of <a href="%C3%89minence%20grise">grey eminence</a> precisely in order to prepare the incoming – and altogether new – joint succession. In 160, Marcus and Lucius were designated joint consuls for the following year. Perhaps Antoninus was already ill; in any case, he died before the year was out.

Two days before his death, the biographer reports, Antoninus was at his ancestral estate at <a href="Lorium">Lorium</a>, in <a href="Etruria">Etruria</a>, about twelve miles (19 km) from Rome. He ate Alpine <a href="Gruyere">Gruyere</a> cheese at dinner quite greedily. In the night he vomited; he had a fever the next day. The day after that, 7 March 161, he summoned the imperial council, and passed the state and his daughter to Marcus. The emperor gave the keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered was when the <a href="tribune">tribune</a> of the night-watch came to ask the password he then responded "aequanimitas" (equanimity). He then turned over, as if going to sleep, and died. His death closed out the longest reign since Augustus (surpassing <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a> by a couple of months). His record for the second-longest reign would be unbeaten for 168 years, until 329 when it was surpassed by <a href="Constantine%20the%20Great">Constantine the Great</a>.

Antoninus Pius' funeral ceremonies were, in the words of the biographer, "elaborate". If his funeral followed the pattern of past funerals, his body would have been incinerated on a pyre at the <a href="Campus%20Martius">Campus Martius</a>, while his spirit would rise to the gods' home in the heavens. However, it seems that this was not the case: according to his <a href="Historia%20Augusta">Historia Augusta</a> biography (which seems to reproduce an earlier, detailed report) Antoninus' body (and not his ashes) was buried in <a href="Castel%20Sant%27Angelo">Hadrian's mausoleum</a>. After a seven-day interval ("justitium"), Marcus and Lucius nominated their father for deification. In contrast to their behavior during Antoninus' campaign to deify Hadrian, the senate did not oppose the emperors' wishes. A "<a href="flamen">flamen</a>", or cultic priest, was appointed to minister the cult of the deified Antoninus, now "Divus Antoninus".

A <a href="Column%20of%20Antoninus%20Pius">column</a> was dedicated to Antoninus on the <a href="Campus%20Martius">Campus Martius</a>, and the <a href="Temple%20of%20Antoninus%20and%20Faustina">temple</a> he had built in the Forum in 141 to his deified wife Faustina was rededicated to the deified Faustina and the deified Antoninus. It survives as the church of San Lorenzo in Miranda.

The first group of people claiming to be an ambassadorial mission of Romans to China was recorded in 166 AD by the "<a href="Hou%20Hanshu">Hou Hanshu</a>". The embassy came to <a href="Emperor%20Huan%20of%20Han">Emperor Huan</a> of <a href="Han%20China">Han China</a> from "Andun" (; Emperor Antoninus Pius), "king of <a href="Daqin">Daqin</a>" (Rome). As Antoninus Pius died in 161, leaving the empire to his adoptive son <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius (Antoninus)</a>, and the envoy arrived in 166, confusion remains about who sent the mission given that both Emperors were named 'Antoninus'. The Roman mission came from the south (therefore probably by <a href="sea">sea</a>), entering China by the frontier province of <a href="Jiaozhi">Jiaozhi</a> at <a href="Rinan">Rinan</a> or <a href="Tonkin">Tonkin</a> (present-day northern <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>). It brought presents of <a href="rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a> <a href="horn%20%28anatomy%29">horn</a>s, <a href="ivory">ivory</a>, and <a href="tortoise">tortoise</a> <a href="Animal%20shell">shell</a>, probably acquired in <a href="Southern%20Asia">Southern Asia</a>. The text specifically states that it was the first time there had been direct contact between the two countries.

Furthermore, a <a href="Roman%20Republic">Republican</a>-era <a href="Roman%20glass">Roman glass</a>ware has been found at a <a href="Western%20Han">Western Han</a> tomb in <a href="Guangzhou">Guangzhou</a> along the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a>, dated to the early 1st century BC. Roman golden medallions made during the reign of Antoninus Pius and perhaps even Marcus Aurelius have been found at <a href="%C3%93c%20Eo">Óc Eo</a> in southern Vietnam, then part of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Funan">Kingdom of Funan</a> near the Chinese province of Jiaozhi. This may have been the port city of <a href="Kattigara">Kattigara</a>, described by <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> (c. 150) as being visited by a Greek sailor named Alexander and laying beyond the <a href="Golden%20Chersonese">Golden Chersonese</a> (i.e. <a href="Malay%20Peninsula">Malay Peninsula</a>). Roman coins from the reigns of <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a> to <a href="Aurelian">Aurelian</a> have been discovered in <a href="Xi%27an">Xi'an</a>, China (site of the Han capital <a href="Chang%27an">Chang'an</a>), although the significantly greater amount of <a href="Indo-Roman%20trade%20relations">Roman coins unearthed in India</a> suggest the Roman maritime trade for <a href="History%20of%20silk">purchasing Chinese silk</a> was centered there, not in China or even the overland <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> running through ancient Iran.

The only intact account of his life handed down to us is that of the "<a href="Augustan%20History">Augustan History</a>", an unreliable and mostly fabricated work. Nevertheless, it still contains information that is considered reasonably sound – for instance, it is the only source that mentions the erection of the Antonine Wall in Britain. Antoninus is unique among Roman emperors in that he has no other biographies. 

Antoninus in many ways was the ideal of the landed gentleman praised not only by ancient Romans, but also by later scholars of classical history, such as <a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Edward Gibbon</a> or the author of the article on Antoninus Pius in the <a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica%20Eleventh%20Edition">"Encyclopædia Britannica" Eleventh Edition</a>.
Some historians have a less positive view of his reign. According to the historian <a href="J.%20B.%20Bury">J. B. Bury</a>, 

German historian <a href="Ernst%20Kornemann">Ernst Kornemann</a> has had it in his "Römische Geschichte" [2 vols., ed. by H. Bengtson, Stuttgart 1954] that the reign of Antoninus comprised "a succession of grossly wasted opportunities," given the upheavals that were to come. There is more to this argument, given that the Parthians in the East were themselves soon to make no small amount of mischief after Antoninus' passing. Kornemann's brief is that Antoninus might have waged preventive wars to head off these outsiders. <a href="Michael%20Grant%20%28classicist%29">Michael Grant</a> agrees that it is possible that had Antoninus acted decisively sooner (it appears on his death bed, he was preparing a large scale action against the Parthians), the Parthians might have been unable to choose their own time, but current evidences are not conclusive. Grant opines that Antoninus and his officers did act in a resolute manner dealing with frontier disturbances of his time, although conditions for long lasting peace were not created. On the whole, according to Grant, Marcus Aurelius' eulogistic picture of Antoninus seems deserved, and Antonius appears to have been a conservative and nationalistic (although he respected and followed Hadrian's example of Philhellenism moderately) Emperor who was not tainted by the blood of either citizen or foe, combined and maintained Numa Pompilius' good fortune, pacific dutifulness and religious scrupulousness, and whose laws removed anomalies and softened harshnesses.

Krzysztof Ulanowski argues that the claims of military inability is exaggerated, considering that although the sources praise Antoninus' love for peace and his efforts 'rather to defend, than enlarge the provinces', he could hardly be considered a pacifist, as shown by the conquest of the Lowlands, the building of the Antonine Wall and the expansion of Germania Superior. Ulianowski also praises Antoninus for being successful in deterrence by diplomatic means.

Although only one of his four children survived to adulthood, Antoninus came to be ancestor to generations of prominent Roman statesmen and socialites, including at least one empress consort and as the maternal grandfather of the Emperor <a href="Commodus">Commodus</a>. The family of Antoninus Pius and <a href="Faustina%20the%20Elder">Faustina the Elder</a> also represents one of the few periods in ancient Roman history where the position of Emperor passed smoothly from father to son. Direct descendants of Antoninus and Faustina were confirmed to exist at least into the fifth century AD.

Advanced Encryption Standard

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name Rijndael (), is a specification for the <a href="encryption">encryption</a> of electronic data <a href="Advanced%20Encryption%20Standard%20process">established</a> by the U.S. <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) in 2001.

AES is a subset of the Rijndael <a href="cipher">cipher</a> developed by two <a href="Belgium">Belgian</a> cryptographers, <a href="Vincent%20Rijmen">Vincent Rijmen</a> and <a href="Joan%20Daemen">Joan Daemen</a>, who submitted a proposal to NIST during the AES selection process. Rijndael is a family of ciphers with different key and block sizes.

For AES, NIST selected three members of the Rijndael family, each with a block size of 128 bits, but three different key lengths: 128, 192 and 256 bits.

AES has been adopted by the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. government</a> and is now used worldwide. It supersedes the <a href="Data%20Encryption%20Standard">Data Encryption Standard</a> (DES), which was published in 1977. The algorithm described by AES is a <a href="symmetric-key%20algorithm">symmetric-key algorithm</a>, meaning the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data.

In the United States, AES was announced by the NIST as U.S. <a href="Federal%20Information%20Processing%20Standard">FIPS</a> PUB 197 (FIPS 197) on November 26, 2001. This announcement followed a five-year standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were presented and evaluated, before the Rijndael cipher was selected as the most suitable (see <a href="Advanced%20Encryption%20Standard%20process">Advanced Encryption Standard process</a> for more details).

AES became effective as a federal government standard on May 26, 2002, after approval by the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Commerce">Secretary of Commerce</a>. AES is included in the ISO/IEC 18033-3 standard. AES is available in many different encryption packages, and is the first (and only) publicly accessible <a href="cipher">cipher</a> approved by the <a href="National%20Security%20Agency">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) for <a href="Classified%20information">top secret</a> information when used in an NSA approved cryptographic module (see <a href="Advanced%20Encryption%20Standard%23Security">Security of AES</a>, below).

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is defined in each of:


AES is based on a design principle known as a <a href="substitution-permutation%20network">substitution-permutation network</a>, a combination of both substitution and permutation, and is fast in both software and hardware. Unlike its predecessor DES, AES does not use a <a href="Feistel%20network">Feistel network</a>. AES is a variant of Rijndael which has a fixed <a href="block%20size%20%28cryptography%29">block size</a> of 128 <a href="bit">bit</a>s, and a <a href="key%20size">key size</a> of 128, 192, or 256 bits. By contrast, the Rijndael specification "per se" is specified with block and key sizes that may be any multiple of 32 bits, with a minimum of 128 and a maximum of 256 bits.

AES operates on a 4 × 4 <a href="column-major%20order">column-major order</a> matrix of bytes, termed the "state", although some versions of Rijndael have a larger block size and have additional columns in the state. Most AES calculations are done in a particular <a href="Finite%20field%20arithmetic">finite field</a>.

For instance, if there are 16 bytes, formula_1, these bytes are represented as this matrix:

The key size used for an AES cipher specifies the number of repetitions of transformation rounds that convert the input, called the plaintext, into the final output, called the ciphertext. The number of cycles of repetition are as follows:


Each round consists of several processing steps, each containing four similar but different stages, including one that depends on the encryption key itself. A set of reverse rounds are applied to transform ciphertext back into the original plaintext using the same encryption key.


In the SubBytes step, each byte formula_3 in the "state" matrix is replaced with a SubByte formula_4 using an 8-bit <a href="substitution%20box">substitution box</a>, the <a href="Rijndael%20S-box">Rijndael S-box</a>. This operation provides the non-linearity in the <a href="cipher">cipher</a>. The S-box used is derived from the <a href="multiplicative%20inverse">multiplicative inverse</a> over , known to have good non-linearity properties. To avoid attacks based on simple algebraic properties, the S-box is constructed by combining the inverse function with an invertible <a href="affine%20transformation">affine transformation</a>. The S-box is also chosen to avoid any fixed points (and so is a <a href="derangement">derangement</a>), i.e., formula_5, and also any opposite fixed points, i.e., formula_6.
While performing the decryption, the InvSubBytes step (the inverse of SubBytes) is used, which requires first taking the inverse of the affine transformation and then finding the multiplicative inverse.

The ShiftRows step operates on the rows of the state; it cyclically shifts the bytes in each row by a certain <a href="Offset%20%28computer%20science%29">offset</a>. For AES, the first row is left unchanged. Each byte of the second row is shifted one to the left. Similarly, the third and fourth rows are shifted by offsets of two and three respectively. For blocks of sizes 128 bits and 192 bits, the shifting pattern is the same. Row formula_7 is shifted left circular by formula_8 bytes. In this way, each column of the output state of the ShiftRows step is composed of bytes from each column of the input state. (Rijndael variants with a larger block size have slightly different offsets). For a 256-bit block, the first row is unchanged and the shifting for the second, third and fourth row is 1 byte, 3 bytes and 4 bytes respectively—this change only applies for the Rijndael cipher when used with a 256-bit block, as AES does not use 256-bit blocks. The importance of this step is to avoid the columns being encrypted independently, in which case AES degenerates into four independent block ciphers.

In the MixColumns step, the four bytes of each column of the state are combined using an invertible <a href="linear%20transformation">linear transformation</a>. The MixColumns function takes four bytes as input and outputs four bytes, where each input byte affects all four output bytes. Together with ShiftRows, MixColumns provides <a href="diffusion%20%28cryptography%29">diffusion</a> in the cipher.

During this operation, each column is transformed using a fixed matrix (matrix left-multiplied by column gives new value of column in the state):

Matrix multiplication is composed of multiplication and addition of the entries. Entries are 8 bit bytes treated as coefficients of polynomial of order formula_10. Addition is simply XOR. Multiplication is modulo irreducible polynomial formula_11. If processed bit by bit then after shifting a conditional <a href="Exclusive%20or">XOR</a> with 1B should be performed if the shifted value is larger than FF (overflow must be corrected by subtraction of generating polynomial). These are special cases of the usual multiplication in formula_12.

In more general sense, each column is treated as a polynomial over formula_12 and is then multiplied modulo formula_14 with a fixed polynomial formula_15. The coefficients are displayed in their <a href="hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> equivalent of the binary representation of bit polynomials from formula_16. The MixColumns step can also be viewed as a multiplication by the shown particular <a href="MDS%20matrix">MDS matrix</a> in the <a href="finite%20field">finite field</a> formula_12. This process is described further in the article <a href="Rijndael%20MixColumns">Rijndael MixColumns</a>.

In the AddRoundKey step, the subkey is combined with the state. For each round, a subkey is derived from the main <a href="key%20%28cryptography%29">key</a> using <a href="Rijndael%20key%20schedule">Rijndael's key schedule</a>; each subkey is the same size as the state. The subkey is added by combining each byte of the state with the corresponding byte of the subkey using bitwise <a href="Exclusive%20or">XOR</a>.

On systems with 32-bit or larger words, it is possible to speed up execution of this cipher by combining the SubBytes and ShiftRows steps with the MixColumns step by transforming them into a sequence of table lookups. This requires four 256-entry 32-bit tables (together occupying 4096 bytes). A round can then be performed with 16 table lookup operations and 12 32-bit exclusive-or operations, followed by four 32-bit exclusive-or operations in the AddRoundKey step. Alternatively, the table lookup operation can be performed with a single 256-entry 32-bit table (occupying 1024 bytes) followed by circular rotation operations.

Using a byte-oriented approach, it is possible to combine the SubBytes, ShiftRows, and MixColumns steps into a single round operation.

Until May 2009, the only successful published attacks against the full AES were <a href="side-channel%20attack">side-channel attack</a>s on some specific implementations. The <a href="National%20Security%20Agency">National Security Agency</a> (NSA) reviewed all the AES finalists, including Rijndael, and stated that all of them were secure enough for U.S. Government non-classified data. In June 2003, the U.S. Government announced that AES could be used to protect <a href="classified%20information">classified information</a>:
The design and strength of all key lengths of the AES algorithm (i.e., 128, 192 and 256) are sufficient to protect classified information up to the SECRET level. TOP SECRET information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key lengths. The implementation of AES in products intended to protect national security systems and/or information must be reviewed and certified by NSA prior to their acquisition and use.

AES has 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys.

By 2006, the best known attacks were on 7 rounds for 128-bit keys, 8 rounds for 192-bit keys, and 9 rounds for 256-bit keys.

For cryptographers, a <a href="cryptanalysis">cryptographic</a> "break" is anything faster than a <a href="brute-force%20attack">brute-force attack</a> – i.e., performing one trial decryption for each possible key in sequence (see <a href="Cryptanalysis%23Computational%20resources%20required">Cryptanalysis</a>). A break can thus include results that are infeasible with current technology. Despite being impractical, theoretical breaks can sometimes provide insight into vulnerability patterns. The largest successful publicly known <a href="brute-force%20attack">brute-force attack</a> against a widely implemented block-cipher encryption algorithm was against a 64-bit <a href="RC5">RC5</a> key by <a href="distributed.net">distributed.net</a> in 2006.

The key space increases by a factor of 2 for each additional bit of key length, and if every possible value of the key is equiprobable, this translates into a doubling of the average brute-force key search time. This implies that the effort of a brute-force search increases exponentially with key length. Key length in itself does not imply security against attacks, since there are ciphers with very long keys that have been found to be vulnerable.

AES has a fairly simple algebraic framework. In 2002, a theoretical attack, named the "<a href="XSL%20attack">XSL attack</a>", was announced by <a href="Nicolas%20Courtois">Nicolas Courtois</a> and <a href="Josef%20Pieprzyk">Josef Pieprzyk</a>, purporting to show a weakness in the AES algorithm, partially due to the low complexity of its nonlinear components. Since then, other papers have shown that the attack, as originally presented, is unworkable; see <a href="XSL%20attack%23Application%20to%20block%20ciphers">XSL attack on block ciphers</a>.

During the AES selection process, developers of competing algorithms wrote of Rijndael's algorithm "...we are concerned about [its] use ... in security-critical applications." In October 2000, however, at the end of the AES selection process, <a href="Bruce%20Schneier">Bruce Schneier</a>, a developer of the competing algorithm <a href="Twofish">Twofish</a>, wrote that while he thought successful academic attacks on Rijndael would be developed someday, he did not "believe that anyone will ever discover an attack that will allow someone to read Rijndael traffic".

In 2009, a new attack was discovered that exploits the simplicity of AES's key schedule and has a complexity of 2. In December 2009 it was improved to 2. This is a follow-up to an attack discovered earlier in 2009 by Alex Biryukov, Dmitry Khovratovich, and Ivica Nikolić, with a complexity of 2 for one out of every 2 keys. However, related-key attacks are not of concern in any properly designed cryptographic protocol, as a properly designed protocol (i.e., implementational software) will take care not to allow related keys, essentially by <a href="Related-key%20attack%23Preventing%20related-key%20attacks">constraining</a> an attacker's means of selecting keys for relatedness.

Another attack was blogged by Bruce Schneier
on July 30, 2009, and released as a preprint
on August 3, 2009. This new attack, by Alex Biryukov, Orr Dunkelman, Nathan Keller, Dmitry Khovratovich, and <a href="Adi%20Shamir">Adi Shamir</a>, is against AES-256 that uses only two related keys and 2 time to recover the complete 256-bit key of a 9-round version, or 2 time for a 10-round version with a stronger type of related subkey attack, or 2 time for an 11-round version. 256-bit AES uses 14 rounds, so these attacks aren't effective against full AES.

The practicality of these attacks with stronger related keys has been criticized, for instance, by the paper on "chosen-key-relations-in-the-middle" attacks on AES-128 authored by Vincent Rijmen in 2010.

In November 2009, the first <a href="known-key%20distinguishing%20attack">known-key distinguishing attack</a> against a reduced 8-round version of AES-128 was released as a preprint.
This known-key distinguishing attack is an improvement of the rebound, or the start-from-the-middle attack, against AES-like permutations, which view two consecutive rounds of permutation as the application of a so-called Super-Sbox. It works on the 8-round version of AES-128, with a time complexity of 2, and a memory complexity of 2. 128-bit AES uses 10 rounds, so this attack isn't effective against full AES-128.

The first <a href="key-recovery%20attack">key-recovery attack</a>s on full AES were due to Andrey Bogdanov, Dmitry Khovratovich, and Christian Rechberger, and were published in 2011. The attack is a <a href="biclique%20attack">biclique attack</a> and is faster than brute force by a factor of about four. It requires 2 operations to recover an AES-128 key. For AES-192 and AES-256, 2 and 2 operations are needed, respectively. This result has been further improved to 2 for AES-128, 2 for AES-192 and 2 for AES-256, which are the current best results in key recovery attack against AES.

This is a very small gain, as a 126-bit key (instead of 128-bits) would still take billions of years to brute force on current and foreseeable hardware. Also, the authors calculate the best attack using their technique on AES with a 128 bit key requires storing 2 bits of data (though this has later been improved to 2, which is 9 petabytes). That works out to about 38 trillion terabytes of data, which is more than all the data stored on all the computers on the planet in 2016. As such this is a seriously impractical attack which has no practical implication on AES security.

According to the <a href="Edward%20Snowden%23Global%20surveillance%20disclosures">Snowden documents</a>, the NSA is doing research on whether a cryptographic attack based on <a href="Kendall%20tau%20rank%20correlation%20coefficient">tau statistic</a> may help to break AES.

At present, there is no known practical attack that would allow someone without knowledge of the key to read data encrypted by AES when correctly implemented.

<a href="Side-channel%20attacks">Side-channel attacks</a> do not attack the cipher as a <a href="black%20box">black box</a>, and thus are not related to cipher security as defined in the classical context, but are important in practice. They attack implementations of the cipher on hardware or software systems that inadvertently leak data. There are several such known attacks on various implementations of AES.

In April 2005, <a href="Daniel%20J.%20Bernstein">D.J. Bernstein</a> announced a cache-timing attack that he used to break a custom server that used <a href="OpenSSL">OpenSSL</a>'s AES encryption. The attack required over 200 million chosen plaintexts. The custom server was designed to give out as much timing information as possible (the server reports back the number of machine cycles taken by the encryption operation); however, as Bernstein pointed out, "reducing the precision of the server's timestamps, or eliminating them from the server's responses, does not stop the attack: the client simply uses round-trip timings based on its local clock, and compensates for the increased noise by averaging over a larger number of samples."

In October 2005, Dag Arne Osvik, <a href="Adi%20Shamir">Adi Shamir</a> and Eran Tromer presented a paper demonstrating several cache-timing attacks against AES. One attack was able to obtain an entire AES key after only 800 operations triggering encryptions, in a total of 65 milliseconds. This attack requires the attacker to be able to run programs on the same system or platform that is performing AES.

In December 2009 an attack on some hardware implementations was published that used <a href="differential%20fault%20analysis">differential fault analysis</a> and allows recovery of a key with a complexity of 2.

In November 2010 Endre Bangerter, David Gullasch and Stephan Krenn published a paper which described a practical approach to a "near real time" recovery of secret keys from AES-128 without the need for either cipher text or plaintext. The approach also works on AES-128 implementations that use compression tables, such as OpenSSL. Like some earlier attacks this one requires the ability to run unprivileged code on the system performing the AES encryption, which may be achieved by malware infection far more easily than commandeering the root account.

In March 2016, Ashokkumar C., Ravi Prakash Giri and Bernard Menezes presented a very efficient side-channel attack on AES that can recover the complete 128-bit AES key in just 6–7 blocks of plaintext/ciphertext which is a substantial improvement over previous works that require between 100 and a million encryptions. The proposed attack require standard user privilege as previous attacks and key-retrieval algorithms run under a minute.

Many modern CPUs have built-in <a href="AES%20instruction%20set">hardware instructions for AES</a>, which would protect against timing-related side-channel attacks.

The <a href="CMVP">Cryptographic Module Validation Program</a> (CMVP) is operated jointly by the United States Government's <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) Computer Security Division and the <a href="Communications%20Security%20Establishment">Communications Security Establishment</a> (CSE) of the Government of Canada. The use of cryptographic modules validated to NIST <a href="FIPS%20140-2">FIPS 140-2</a> is required by the United States Government for encryption of all data that has a classification of Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) or above. From NSTISSP #11, National Policy Governing the Acquisition of Information Assurance: "Encryption products for protecting classified information will be certified by NSA, and encryption products intended for protecting sensitive information will be certified in accordance with NIST FIPS 140-2."

The Government of Canada also recommends the use of <a href="FIPS%20140">FIPS 140</a> validated cryptographic modules in unclassified applications of its departments.

Although NIST publication 197 ("FIPS 197") is the unique document that covers the AES algorithm, vendors typically approach the CMVP under FIPS 140 and ask to have several algorithms (such as <a href="Triple%20DES">Triple DES</a> or <a href="SHA1">SHA1</a>) validated at the same time. Therefore, it is rare to find cryptographic modules that are uniquely FIPS 197 validated and NIST itself does not generally take the time to list FIPS 197 validated modules separately on its public web site. Instead, FIPS 197 validation is typically just listed as an "FIPS approved: AES" notation (with a specific FIPS 197 certificate number) in the current list of FIPS 140 validated cryptographic modules.

The Cryptographic Algorithm Validation Program (CAVP) allows for independent validation of the correct implementation of the AES algorithm at a reasonable cost. Successful validation results in being listed on the NIST validations page. This testing is a pre-requisite for the FIPS 140-2 module validation described below. However, successful CAVP validation in no way implies that the cryptographic module implementing the algorithm is secure. A cryptographic module lacking FIPS 140-2 validation or specific approval by the NSA is not deemed secure by the US Government and cannot be used to protect government data.

FIPS 140-2 validation is challenging to achieve both technically and fiscally. There is a standardized battery of tests as well as an element of source code review that must be passed over a period of a few weeks. The cost to perform these tests through an approved laboratory can be significant (e.g., well over $30,000 US) and does not include the time it takes to write, test, document and prepare a module for validation. After validation, modules must be re-submitted and re-evaluated if they are changed in any way. This can vary from simple paperwork updates if the security functionality did not change to a more substantial set of re-testing if the security functionality was impacted by the change.

Test vectors are a set of known ciphers for a given input and key. <a href="NIST">NIST</a> distributes the reference of AES test vectors as <a href="http%3A//csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/aes/KAT_AES.zip">AES Known Answer Test (KAT) Vectors (in ZIP format)</a>.

High speed and low RAM requirements were criteria of the AES selection process. As the chosen algorithm, AES performed well on a wide variety of hardware, from 8-bit <a href="smart%20card">smart card</a>s to high-performance computers.

On a <a href="Pentium%20Pro">Pentium Pro</a>, AES encryption requires 18 clock cycles per byte, equivalent to a throughput of about 11 MB/s for a 200 MHz processor. On a 1.7 GHz <a href="Pentium%20M">Pentium M</a> throughput is about 60 MB/s.

On Intel <a href="Core%20i3">Core i3</a>/<a href="Core%20i5">i5</a>/<a href="Core%20i7">i7</a> and <a href="AMD%20APU">AMD APU</a> and <a href="AMD%20FX">FX</a> CPUs supporting <a href="AES%20instruction%20set">AES-NI instruction set</a> extensions, throughput can be over 700 MB/s.

Argot

An argot (; from <a href="French%20language">French</a> "argot" '<a href="slang">slang</a>') is a <a href="Cant%20%28language%29">secret language</a> used by various groups—e.g., schoolmates, outlaws, colleagues, among many others—to prevent outsiders from understanding their conversations. The term "argot" is also used to refer to the informal specialized vocabulary from a particular field of study, occupation, or hobby, in which <a href="word%20sense">sense</a> it overlaps with <a href="jargon">jargon</a>.

Author <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a> was one of the first to research argot extensively. He describes it in his 1862 novel "<a href="Les%20Mis%C3%A9rables">Les Misérables</a>" as the language of the dark; at one point, he says, "What is argot; properly speaking? Argot is the language of misery."

The earliest known record of the term "argot" in this context was in a 1628 document. The word was probably derived from the contemporary name "les argotiers", given to a group of thieves at that time.

Under the strictest definition, an "argot" is a proper language with its own grammar and style. But such complete secret languages are rare because the speakers usually have some public language in common, on which the argot is largely based. Such argots are mainly versions of another language, with a part of its vocabulary replaced by words unknown to the larger public; "argot" used in this <a href="word%20sense">sense</a> is <a href="synonym">synonym</a>ous with "<a href="cant%20%28language%29">cant</a>". For example, "argot" in this sense is used for systems such as "<a href="verlan">verlan</a>" and "<a href="louch%C3%A9bem">louchébem</a>", which retain French syntax and apply transformations only to individual words (and often only to a certain subset of words, such as nouns, or semantic content words). Such systems are examples of "argots à clef", or "coded argots."

Specific words can go from argot into common speech or the other way. For example, modern <a href="French%20language">French</a> "<a href="wikt%3Aloufoque">loufoque</a>" 'crazy, goofy', now common usage, originates in the "<a href="louch%C3%A9bem">louchébem</a>" transformation of Fr. "<a href="wikt%3Afou">fou</a>" 'crazy'.

"Piaf" is a Parisian argot word for "bird, <a href="sparrow">sparrow</a>". It was taken up by singer <a href="Edith%20Piaf">Edith Piaf</a> as her stage name.

<doc id="1264" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1264" title="Anisotropy">
Anisotropy

Anisotropy , is the property of being directionally dependent, which implies different properties in different directions, as opposed to <a href="isotropy">isotropy</a>. It can be defined as a difference, when measured along different axes, in a material's <a href="Physical%20property">physical</a> or <a href="List%20of%20materials%20properties%23Mechanical%20properties">mechanical properties</a> (<a href="absorbance">absorbance</a>, <a href="refractive%20index">refractive index</a>, <a href="Electrical%20resistivity%20and%20conductivity">conductivity</a>, <a href="tensile%20strength">tensile strength</a>, etc.) An example of anisotropy is the light coming through a <a href="polarizer">polarizer</a>. Another is <a href="wood">wood</a>, which is easier to split along its <a href="wood%20grain">grain</a> than against it.

In the field of <a href="computer%20graphics">computer graphics</a>, an anisotropic surface changes in appearance as it rotates about its <a href="Normal%20%28geometry%29">geometric normal</a>, as is the case with <a href="velvet">velvet</a>.

<a href="Anisotropic%20filtering">Anisotropic filtering</a> (AF) is a method of enhancing the image quality of textures on surfaces that are far away and steeply angled with respect to the point of view. Older techniques, such as <a href="bilinear%20filtering">bilinear</a> and <a href="trilinear%20filtering">trilinear filtering</a>, do not take into account the angle a surface is viewed from, which can result in <a href="aliasing">aliasing</a> or blurring of textures. By reducing detail in one direction more than another, these effects can be reduced.

A chemical anisotropic <a href="filter%20%28chemistry%29">filter</a>, as used to filter particles, is a filter with increasingly smaller interstitial spaces in the direction of filtration so that the <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Proximal%20and%20distal">proximal</a> <a href="region">region</a>s filter out larger particles and <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Proximal%20and%20distal">distal</a> regions increasingly remove smaller particles, resulting in greater flow-through and more efficient filtration.

In <a href="Nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance%20spectroscopy">NMR spectroscopy</a>, the orientation of nuclei with respect to the applied magnetic field determines their <a href="chemical%20shift">chemical shift</a>. In this context, anisotropic systems refer to the electron distribution of molecules with abnormally high electron density, like the pi system of <a href="benzene">benzene</a>. This abnormal electron density affects the applied magnetic field and causes the observed chemical shift to change.

In <a href="fluorescence%20spectroscopy">fluorescence spectroscopy</a>, the <a href="fluorescence%20anisotropy">fluorescence anisotropy</a>, calculated from the <a href="polarization%20%28waves%29">polarization</a> properties of fluorescence from samples excited with plane-polarized light, is used, e.g., to determine the shape of a macromolecule.
Anisotropy measurements reveal the average angular displacement of the fluorophore that occurs between absorption and subsequent emission of a photon.

Images of a gravity-bound or man-made environment are particularly anisotropic in the orientation domain, with more image structure located at orientations parallel with or orthogonal to the direction of gravity (vertical and horizontal).

<a href="Physicists">Physicists</a> from <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> reported about their detection of the cosine anisotropy in <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> in 1977. Their experiment demonstrated the <a href="Doppler%20shift">Doppler shift</a> caused by the movement of the earth with respect to the <a href="Big%20Bang">early Universe matter</a>, the source of the radiation. Cosmic anisotropy has also been seen in the alignment of galaxies' rotation axes and polarisation angles of quasars.

Physicists use the term anisotropy to describe direction-dependent properties of materials. <a href="Magnetic%20anisotropy">Magnetic anisotropy</a>, for example, may occur in a <a href="plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a>, so that its magnetic field is oriented in a preferred direction. Plasmas may also show "filamentation" (such as that seen in <a href="lightning">lightning</a> or a <a href="plasma%20globe">plasma globe</a>) that is directional.

An "anisotropic liquid" has the fluidity of a normal liquid, but has an average structural order relative to each other along the molecular axis, unlike water or <a href="chloroform">chloroform</a>, which contain no structural ordering of the molecules. <a href="Liquid%20crystals">Liquid crystals</a> are examples of anisotropic liquids.

Some materials <a href="heat%20conduction">conduct heat</a> in a way that is isotropic, that is independent of spatial orientation around the heat source. Heat conduction is more commonly anisotropic, which implies that detailed geometric modeling of typically diverse materials being thermally managed is required. The materials used to transfer and reject heat from the heat source in <a href="electronics">electronics</a> are often anisotropic.

Many <a href="crystal">crystal</a>s are anisotropic to <a href="light">light</a> ("optical anisotropy"), and exhibit properties such as <a href="birefringence">birefringence</a>. <a href="Crystal%20optics">Crystal optics</a> describes light propagation in these media. An "axis of anisotropy" is defined as the axis along which isotropy is broken (or an axis of symmetry, such as normal to crystalline layers). Some materials can have multiple such <a href="optical%20axis">optical axes</a>.

<a href="Seismic%20anisotropy">Seismic anisotropy</a> is the variation of seismic wavespeed with direction. Seismic anisotropy is an indicator of long range order in a material, where features smaller than the seismic <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> (e.g., crystals, cracks, pores, layers or inclusions) have a dominant alignment. This alignment leads to a directional variation of <a href="Elasticity%20%28physics%29">elasticity</a> wavespeed. Measuring the effects of anisotropy in seismic data can provide important information about processes and mineralogy in the Earth; indeed, significant seismic anisotropy has been detected in the Earth's <a href="Crust%20%28geology%29">crust</a>, <a href="mantle%20%28geology%29">mantle</a> and <a href="inner%20core">inner core</a>.

<a href="Geological">Geological</a> formations with distinct layers of <a href="sedimentary">sedimentary</a> material can exhibit electrical anisotropy; <a href="electrical%20conductivity">electrical conductivity</a> in one direction (e.g. parallel to a layer), is different from that in another (e.g. perpendicular to a layer). This property is used in the gas and <a href="oil%20exploration">oil exploration</a> industry to identify <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a>-bearing sands in sequences of <a href="sand">sand</a> and <a href="shale">shale</a>. Sand-bearing hydrocarbon assets have high <a href="resistivity">resistivity</a> (low conductivity), whereas shales have lower resistivity. <a href="Formation%20evaluation">Formation evaluation</a> instruments measure this conductivity/resistivity and the results are used to help find oil and gas in wells.

The <a href="hydraulic%20conductivity">hydraulic conductivity</a> of <a href="aquifer">aquifer</a>s is often anisotropic for the same reason. When calculating groundwater flow to <a href="drainage">drains</a> or to <a href="Water%20well">wells</a>, the difference between horizontal and vertical permeability must be taken into account, otherwise the results may be subject to error.

Most common rock-forming <a href="mineral">mineral</a>s are anisotropic, including <a href="quartz">quartz</a> and <a href="feldspar">feldspar</a>. Anisotropy in minerals is most reliably seen in their <a href="optical%20mineralogy">optical properties</a>. An example of an isotropic mineral is <a href="garnet">garnet</a>.

Anisotropy is also a well-known property in medical ultrasound imaging describing a different resulting <a href="echogenicity">echogenicity</a> of soft tissues, such as tendons, when the angle of the transducer is changed. Tendon fibers appear hyperechoic (bright) when the transducer is perpendicular to the tendon, but can appear hypoechoic (darker) when the transducer is angled obliquely. This can be a source of interpretation error for inexperienced practitioners.

Anisotropy, in Material Science, is a material’s directional dependence of a physical property. Most materials exhibit anisotropic behavior. An example would be the dependence of <a href="Young%27s%20modulus">Young's modulus</a> on the direction of load.
Anisotropy in polycrystalline materials can also be due to certain <a href="Texture%20%28crystalline%29">texture</a> patterns often produced during manufacturing of the material. In the case of rolling, "stringers" of texture are produced in the direction of rolling, which can lead to vastly different properties in the rolling and transverse directions.
Some materials, such as wood and fibre-reinforced <a href="composite%20material">composites</a> are very anisotropic, being much stronger along the grain/fibre than across it. Metals and alloys tend to be more isotropic, though they can sometimes exhibit significant anisotropic behaviour. This is especially important in processes such as <a href="Deep%20drawing">deep-drawing</a>.

Wood is a naturally anisotropic (but often simplified to be <a href="transversely%20isotropic">transversely isotropic</a>) material. Its properties vary widely when measured with or against the growth grain. For example, wood's strength and hardness is different for the same sample measured in different orientations.

In the Mechanics of Continuum Materials isotropy and anisotropy are rigorously described through the symmetry group of the constitutive relation.

Anisotropic etching techniques (such as <a href="deep%20reactive%20ion%20etching">deep reactive ion etching</a>) are used in microfabrication processes to create well defined microscopic features with a high <a href="aspect%20ratio">aspect ratio</a>. These features are commonly used in <a href="microelectromechanical%20systems">MEMS</a> and <a href="microfluidic">microfluidic</a> devices, where the anisotropy of the features is needed to impart desired optical, electrical, or physical properties to the device. Anisotropic etching can also refer to certain chemical etchants used to etch a certain material preferentially over certain crystallographic planes (e.g., KOH etching of <a href="silicon">silicon</a> [100] produces pyramid-like structures)

<a href="Diffusion%20tensor%20imaging">Diffusion tensor imaging</a> is an <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">MRI</a> technique that involves measuring the fractional anisotropy of the random motion (<a href="Brownian%20motion">Brownian motion</a>) of water molecules in the brain. Water molecules located in <a href="White%20matter">fiber tracts</a> are more likely to be anisotropic, since they are restricted in their movement (they move more in the dimension parallel to the fiber tract rather than in the two dimensions orthogonal to it), whereas water molecules dispersed in the rest of the brain have less restricted movement and therefore display more isotropy. This difference in fractional anisotropy is exploited to create a map of the fiber tracts in the brains of the individual.

<a href="Radiance">Radiance</a> fields (see <a href="BRDF">BRDF</a>) from a reflective surface are often not isotropic in nature. This makes calculations of the total energy being reflected from any scene a difficult quantity to calculate. In <a href="remote%20sensing">remote sensing</a> applications, anisotropy functions can be derived for specific scenes, immensely simplifying the calculation of the net reflectance or (thereby) the net <a href="irradiance">irradiance</a> of a scene.
For example, let the <a href="BRDF">BRDF</a> be formula_1 where 'i' denotes incident direction and 'v' denotes viewing direction (as if from a satellite or other instrument). And let P be the Planar Albedo, which represents the total reflectance from the scene.

It is of interest because, with knowledge of the anisotropy function as defined, a measurement of the <a href="BRDF">BRDF</a> from a single viewing direction (say, formula_4) yields a measure of the total scene reflectance (Planar Albedo) for that specific incident geometry (say, formula_5).

Alpha decay

Alpha decay or α-decay is a type of <a href="radioactivity">radioactive decay</a> in which an <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a> emits an <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a> (helium nucleus) and thereby transforms or 'decays' into an atom with a <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a> that is reduced by four and an <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> that is reduced by two. An alpha particle is identical to the nucleus of a <a href="helium-4">helium-4</a> atom, which consists of two <a href="proton">proton</a>s and two <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s. It has a charge of +2e and a mass of 4u. For example, <a href="uranium-238">uranium-238</a> decays to form <a href="thorium-234">thorium-234</a>. Alpha particles have a <a href="electric%20charge">charge</a> +2, but as a nuclear equation describes a nuclear reaction without considering the electrons – a convention that does not imply that the nuclei necessarily occur in neutral atoms – the charge is not usually shown.

Alpha decay typically occurs in the heaviest nuclides. Theoretically, it can occur only in nuclei somewhat heavier than <a href="nickel">nickel</a> (element 28), where the overall <a href="binding%20energy">binding energy</a> per <a href="nucleon">nucleon</a> is no longer a minimum and the nuclides are therefore unstable toward spontaneous fission-type processes. In practice, this mode of decay has only been observed in nuclides considerably heavier than nickel, with the lightest known alpha emitters being the lightest <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s (mass numbers 106–110) of <a href="tellurium">tellurium</a> (element 52). Exceptionally, however, <a href="Isotopes%20of%20beryllium">beryllium-8</a> decays to two alpha particles.

Alpha decay is by far the most common form of <a href="cluster%20decay">cluster decay</a>, where the parent <a href="atom">atom</a> ejects a defined <a href="decay%20product">daughter</a> collection of nucleons, leaving another defined product behind. It is the most common form because of the combined extremely high <a href="binding%20energy">binding energy</a> and relatively small mass of the alpha particle. Like other cluster decays, alpha decay is fundamentally a <a href="quantum%20tunneling">quantum tunneling</a> process. Unlike <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>, it is governed by the interplay between both the <a href="nuclear%20force">nuclear force</a> and the <a href="electromagnetic%20force">electromagnetic force</a>.

<a href="Alpha%20particle">Alpha particle</a>s have a typical kinetic energy of 5 MeV (or ≈ 0.13% of their total energy, 110 TJ/kg) and have a speed of about 15,000,000 m/s, or 5% of the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a>. There is surprisingly small variation around this energy, due to the heavy dependence of the half-life of this process on the energy produced (see equations in the <a href="Geiger%E2%80%93Nuttall%20law">Geiger–Nuttall law</a>). Because of their relatively large mass, +2 electric charge and relatively low velocity, alpha particles are very likely to interact with other atoms and lose their energy, and their forward motion can be stopped by a few centimeters of <a href="air">air</a>. Approximately 99% of the <a href="helium">helium</a> produced on <a href="Earth">Earth</a> is the result of the alpha decay of underground deposits of <a href="mineral">mineral</a>s containing <a href="uranium">uranium</a> or <a href="thorium">thorium</a>. The helium is brought to the surface as a by-product of <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a> production.

Alpha particles were first described in the investigations of radioactivity by <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> in 1899, and by 1907 they were identified as He ions.

By 1928, <a href="George%20Gamow">George Gamow</a> had solved the theory of alpha decay via tunneling. The alpha particle is trapped in a <a href="potential%20well">potential well</a> by the nucleus. Classically, it is forbidden to escape, but according to the (then) newly discovered principles of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>, it has a tiny (but non-zero) probability of "<a href="quantum%20tunnelling">tunneling</a>" through the <a href="potential%20barrier">barrier</a> and appearing on the other side to escape the nucleus. Gamow solved a model potential for the nucleus and derived, from first principles, a relationship between the <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of the decay, and the energy of the emission, which had been previously discovered empirically, and was known as the <a href="Geiger%E2%80%93Nuttall%20law">Geiger–Nuttall law</a>.

The <a href="nuclear%20force">nuclear force</a> holding an atomic nucleus together is very strong, in general much stronger than the repulsive <a href="electromagnetic%20force">electromagnetic force</a>s between the protons. However, the nuclear force is also short range, dropping quickly in strength beyond about 1 <a href="femtometre">femtometre</a>, while the electromagnetic force has unlimited range. The strength of the attractive nuclear force keeping a nucleus together is thus proportional to the number of nucleons, but the total disruptive electromagnetic force trying to break the nucleus apart is roughly proportional to the square of its atomic number. A nucleus with 210 or more nucleons is so large that the strong nuclear force holding it together can just barely counterbalance the electromagnetic repulsion between the protons it contains. Alpha decay occurs in such nuclei as a means of increasing stability by reducing size.

One curiosity is why alpha particles, helium nuclei, should be preferentially emitted as opposed to other particles like a single <a href="proton%20emission">proton</a> or <a href="neutron%20emission">neutron</a> or <a href="cluster%20decay">other atomic nuclei</a>. Part of the answer comes from <a href="conservation%20of%20wave%20function%20symmetry">conservation of wave function symmetry</a>, which prevents a particle from spontaneously changing from exhibiting <a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20statistics">Bose–Einstein statistics</a> (if it had an even number of nucleons) to <a href="Fermi%E2%80%93Dirac%20statistics">Fermi–Dirac statistics</a> (if it had an odd number of nucleons) or vice versa. Single proton emission, or the emission of any particle with an odd number of nucleons would violate this conservation law. The rest of the answer comes from the very high <a href="binding%20energy">binding energy</a> of the alpha particle. Computing the total disintegration energy given by the equation:
Where formula_2 is the initial mass of the nucleus, formula_3 is the mass of the nucleus after particle emission, and formula_4 is the mass of the emitted particle, shows that alpha particle emission will usually be possible just with energy from the nucleus itself, while other decay modes will require additional energy. For example, performing the calculation for <a href="uranium-232">uranium-232</a> shows that alpha particle emission would need only 5.4 MeV, while a single proton emission would require 6.1 MeV. Most of this disintegration energy becomes the <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a> of the alpha particle itself, although to preserve <a href="conservation%20of%20momentum">conservation of momentum</a> part of this energy becomes the recoil of the nucleus itself. However, since the mass numbers of most alpha emitting radioisotopes exceed 210, far greater than the mass number of the alpha particle (4) the part of the energy going to the recoil of the nucleus is generally quite small.

These disintegration energies however are substantially smaller than the <a href="potential%20barrier">potential barrier</a> provided by the nuclear force, which prevents the alpha particle from escaping. The energy needed is generally in the range of about 25 MeV, the amount of work that must be done against electromagnetic repulsion to bring an alpha particle from infinity to a point near the nucleus just outside the range of the nuclear force's influence. An alpha particle can be thought of as being inside a potential barrier whose walls are 25 MeV. However, decay alpha particles only have kinetic energies of 4 MeV to about 9 MeV, far less than the energy needed to escape.

Quantum mechanics, however, provides a ready explanation, via the mechanism of quantum tunnelling. The quantum tunnelling theory of alpha decay, independently developed by George Gamow and <a href="Ronald%20Wilfred%20Gurney">Ronald Wilfred Gurney</a> and <a href="Edward%20Condon">Edward Condon</a> in 1928, was hailed as a very striking confirmation of quantum theory. Essentially, the alpha particle escapes from the nucleus by quantum tunnelling its way out. Gurney and Condon made the following observation in their paper on it:
It has hitherto been necessary to postulate some special arbitrary ‘instability’ of the nucleus; but in the following note it is pointed out that disintegration is a natural consequence of the laws of quantum mechanics without any special hypothesis... Much has been written of the explosive violence with which the α-particle is hurled from its place in the nucleus. But from the process pictured above, one would rather say that the α-particle almost slips away unnoticed.
The theory makes the assumptions that the alpha particle can be considered an independent particle within a nucleus that is in constant motion, but held within the nucleus by nuclear forces. There is, in addition, a very small but decidedly non-zero probability that it will tunnel its way out. An alpha particle with a speed of 1.5×10 m/s within a nuclear diameter of approximately 10 m will thus collide against the potential barrier of the nuclear force more than 10 times per second, and yet for some radioisotopes it will need to keep doing this for as long as 13 billion years before managing to escape, so the probability of escape is extremely low.

Working out the details of the theory leads to an equation relating the half-life of a radioisotope to the decay energy of its alpha particles, a theoretical derivation of the empirical <a href="Geiger%E2%80%93Nuttall%20law">Geiger–Nuttall law</a>.

<a href="Americium-241">Americium-241</a>, an <a href="alpha%20emitter">alpha emitter</a>, is used in <a href="smoke%20detector">smoke detector</a>s. The alpha particles <a href="Ionization">ionize</a> air in an open <a href="ion%20chamber">ion chamber</a> and a small <a href="Electric%20current">current</a> flows through the ionized air. Smoke particles from fire that enter the chamber reduce the current, triggering the smoke detector's alarm.

Alpha decay can provide a safe power source for <a href="radioisotope%20thermoelectric%20generator">radioisotope thermoelectric generator</a>s used for <a href="space%20probe">space probe</a>s and were used for <a href="Artificial%20pacemaker">artificial heart pacemakers</a>. Alpha decay is much more easily shielded against than other forms of radioactive decay.

<a href="Static%20eliminator">Static eliminator</a>s typically use <a href="polonium-210">polonium-210</a>, an alpha emitter, to ionize air, allowing the 'static cling' to dissipate more rapidly.

Highly charged and heavy, alpha particles lose their several <a href="MeV">MeV</a> of energy within a small volume of material, along a very short <a href="mean%20free%20path">mean free path</a>. This increases the chance of <a href="double-strand%20break">double-strand break</a>s to the DNA in cases of internal contamination, when ingested, inhaled, injected or introduced through the skin. Otherwise, touching an alpha source is typically not harmful, as alpha particles are effectively shielded by a few centimeters of air, a piece of paper, or the thin layer of dead skin cells that make up the <a href="epidermis%20%28skin%29">epidermis</a>; however, many alpha sources are also accompanied by <a href="beta%20decay">beta-emitting</a> radio daughters, and both are often accompanied by gamma photon emission.

RBE <a href="relative%20biological%20effectiveness">relative biological effectiveness</a> quantifies the ability of radiation to cause certain biological effects, notably either <a href="cancer">cancer</a> or <a href="necrosis">cell-death</a>, for equivalent radiation exposure. Alpha radiation has high <a href="linear%20energy%20transfer">linear energy transfer</a> (LET) coefficient, which is about one ionization of a molecule/atom for every <a href="angstrom">angstrom</a> of travel by the alpha particle. The RBE has been set at the value of 20 for alpha radiation by various government regulations. The RBE is set at 10 for <a href="neutron">neutron</a> irradiation, and at 1 for <a href="Beta%20decay">beta radiation</a> and ionizing photons.

However, the <a href="recoil">recoil</a> of the parent nucleus (alpha recoil) gives it a significant amount of energy, which also causes ionization damage (see <a href="ionizing%20radiation">ionizing radiation</a>). This energy is roughly the weight of the alpha (4 <a href="Atomic%20mass%20unit">u</a>) divided by the weight of the parent (typically about 200 u) times the total energy of the alpha. By some estimates, this might account for most of the internal radiation damage, as the recoil nucleus is part of an atom that is much larger than an alpha particle, and causes a very dense trail of ionization; the atom is typically a <a href="heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metal</a>, which preferentially collect on the <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s. In some studies, this has resulted in an RBE approaching 1,000 instead of the value used in governmental regulations.

The largest natural contributor to public radiation dose is <a href="radon">radon</a>, a naturally occurring, radioactive gas found in soil and rock. If the gas is inhaled, some of the radon particles may attach to the inner lining of the lung. These particles continue to decay, emitting alpha particles, which can damage cells in the lung tissue. The death of <a href="Marie%20Curie">Marie Curie</a> at age 66 from <a href="aplastic%20anemia">aplastic anemia</a> was probably caused by prolonged exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation, but it is not clear if this was due to alpha radiation or X-rays. Curie worked extensively with radium, which decays into radon, along with other radioactive materials that emit <a href="beta%20decay">beta</a> and <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s. However, Curie also worked with unshielded X-ray tubes during World War I, and analysis of her skeleton during a reburial showed a relatively low level of radioisotope burden.

The Russian dissident <a href="Alexander%20Litvinenko">Alexander Litvinenko</a>'s 2006 murder by <a href="radiation%20poisoning">radiation poisoning</a> is thought to have been carried out with <a href="polonium-210">polonium-210</a>, an alpha emitter.

Extreme poverty

Extreme poverty, absolute poverty, destitution, or penury, was originally defined by the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> in 1995 as "a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information. It depends not only on income but also on access to services." In 2008, "extreme poverty" widely refers to earning below the international poverty line of $1.25/day (in 2005 prices), set by the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a>. This measure is the equivalent to earning $1.00 a day in 1996 US prices, hence the widely used expression, living on "less than a dollar a day." The vast majority of those in extreme poverty – 96% – reside in <a href="South%20Asia">South Asia</a>, <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>, <a href="Caribbean">The West Indies</a>, <a href="Asia-Pacific">East Asia and the Pacific</a>; nearly half live in India and China alone.

The reduction of extreme poverty and hunger was the first <a href="Millennium%20Development%20Goal">Millennium Development Goal</a> (MDG1), as set by 189 United Nations Member States in 2000. Specifically, MDG1 set a target of reducing the extreme poverty rate in half by 2015, a goal that was met 5 years ahead of schedule. This goal was created to end poverty in all its forms everywhere, and the international community, including the <a href="UN">UN</a>, the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> and the United States, has set a target of ending extreme poverty by 2030.

Extreme poverty is defined by the International Community as earning less than a $1.25 a day, as measured in 2005 international prices. Originally, the international poverty line was set at earning a $1 a day when the Millennium Development Goals were first published. However, in 2008, the World Bank pushed the line to $1.25 to recognize higher price levels in several developing countries than previously estimated.

As of September 2010 (the most recent, reliable date), according to the UN, roughly 1.2 billion people remain in extreme poverty based on this metric. Despite the significant number of individuals still earning below the international poverty line, this figure represents significant progress for the international community, as this number is 700 million fewer than the number living in extreme poverty in 1990 – 1.9 billion. As highlighted in the next section, though there are many criticisms of a purely income-based approach to measuring extreme poverty, the $1.25/day line remains the most widely used metric as it is easily accessible to the public at large and "draws attention to those in the direst need."

On September 23, 2015, the <a href="United%20Kingdom">UK</a>-based <a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a> reported that the World Bank intends to revise its income-based benchmark upward, to $1.90 a day based on 2011 prices. As differences in the cost of living across the world evolve, the global poverty line has to be periodically updated to reflect these changes. The new global poverty line uses updated price data to paint a more accurate picture of the costs of basic food, clothing, and shelter needs around the world. In other words, the real value of $1.90 in 2011’s prices is the same as $1.25 was in 2005.

Though widely used by most international organizations, the $1.25/day extreme poverty line has come under scrutiny from a variety of factors. For example, when used to measure headcount ratio (i.e. the percentage of people living below the line), the $1.25/day line is unable to capture other important measures such as depth of poverty, relative poverty and how people view their own financial situation (known as the "socially subjective poverty line"). Moreover, the calculation of the poverty line relies on several debatable assumptions about purchasing power parity, homogeneity of household size and makeup, and consumer prices used to determine a basket of essential goods. Not to mention the fact that there may be missing data from the poorest and most fragile countries which may muddle the picture even further.

To address these problems, several alternative instruments for measuring extreme poverty have been suggested which incorporate other factors such as malnutrition and lack of access to a basic education. Thus, the 2010 Human Development Report introduced the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI), which measures not only income, but also basic needs. Using this tool, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimated that roughly 1.5 billion people remained in extreme poverty as opposed to the conventional figure of 1.2 billion. As this figure is considered more "holistic," it may shed new light on relative deprivation within a country. For example, in Ethiopia, 39% of the population is considered extremely poor under conventional measures, but 90% are in multidimensional poverty.

Another version of the MPI, known as the Alkire-Foster Method, created by Sabina Alkire and James Foster of the <a href="Oxford%20Poverty%20%26amp%3B%20Human%20Development%20Initiative">Oxford Poverty & Human Development Initiative</a> (OPHI), can be broken down to reflect both the incidence and the intensity of poverty. This tool is useful as development officials, using the "M0 measure" of the method (which is calculated by multiplying "the proportion of people who are poor by the percentage of dimensions in which they are deprived"), can determine the most likely causes of poverty within a region. For example, in the <a href="Gaza%20Strip">Gaza Strip</a> of Palestine, using the M0 measure of the Alkire-Foster method reveals that poverty in the region is primarily caused by a lack of access to electricity and drinking water, in addition to widespread overcrowding. In contrast, data from the <a href="Chhukha%20District">Chhukha District</a> of Bhutan reveals that income is a much larger contributor to poverty as opposed to other dimensions within the region.

Using the World Bank definition of $1.25/day, as of September 2013, roughly 1.3 billion people remain in extreme poverty (or roughly 1 in 6 people) (of ~7.1 billion people in same time frame). Nearly half live in India and China, with more than 85% living in just 20 countries. Since the mid-1990s, there has been a steady decline in both the worldwide poverty rate and the total number of extreme poor. In 1990, the percentage of the global population living in extreme poverty was 43%, but in 2011, that percentage had dropped down to 21%. This halving of the extreme poverty rate falls in line with the first millennium development goal (MDG1) proposed by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who called on the international community at the turn of the century to "halv[e] the proportion of people living in extreme poverty…by 2015."

This reduction in extreme poverty took place most notably in China, Indonesia, India, Pakistan and Vietnam. These five countries accounted for the alleviation of 715 million people out of extreme poverty between 1990 and 2010 – more than the global net total of roughly 700 million. This statistical oddity can be explained by the fact that the number of people living in extreme poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa rose from 290 million to 414 million over the same period. However, there have been many positive signs for extensive, global poverty reduction as well. Since 1999, the total number of extreme poor has declined by 50 million per year, on average. Moreover, in 2005, for the first time in recorded history, poverty rates began to fall in every region of the world, including Africa. Although this is largely due to a change in the 2000 UN Millennium Declaration, extending the plan period backward to 1990, it was previously 1996. Changing the date took advantage of rapid population growth and a huge poverty reduction in China during the 1990s.

As aforementioned, the number of people living in extreme poverty has reduced from 1.9 billion to 1.2 billion over the span of the last 20–25 years. If we remain on our current trajectory, many economists predict we could reach global "zero" by 2030–2035, thus "ending" extreme poverty. Global zero entails a world in which fewer than 3% of the global population lives in extreme poverty (projected under most optimistic scenarios to be fewer than 200 million people). This "zero" figure is set at 3% in recognition of the fact that some amount of "frictional" poverty will continue to exist, whether it is caused by political conflict or unexpected economic fluctuations, at least for the foreseeable future. However, the <a href="Brookings%20Institution">Brookings Institution</a> notes that any projection about poverty more than a few years into the future runs the risk of being highly uncertain. This is because changes in consumption and distribution throughout the developing world over the next two decades could result in monumental shifts in global poverty, for better or worse.

Others are more pessimistic about this possibility, with many predicting a range of 193 million to 660 million people living in extreme poverty by 2035. Additionally, some believe the rate of poverty reduction will slow down in the developing world, especially in Africa, and as such it will take closer to five decades to reach global "zero." Despite these reservations, several prominent international and national organizations, including the UN, the World Bank and the United States Federal Government (via USAID), have set a target of reaching global zero by the end of 2030.

There are a variety of factors that may reinforce or instigate the existence of extreme poverty, such as weak institutions, cycles of violence and a low level of growth. Recent World Bank research shows that some countries can get caught in a "fragility trap," in which the above factors prevent the poorest nations from emerging from low-level equilibrium in the long run. Moreover, most of the reduction in extreme poverty over the past twenty years has taken place in countries that have not experienced a civil conflict or have had governing institutions with a strong capacity to actually govern. Thus, to end extreme poverty, it is also important to focus on the interrelated problems of fragility and conflict.

USAID defines fragility as a government's lack of both legitimacy (the perception the government is adequate at doing its job) and effectiveness (how good the government is at maintaining law and order, in an equitable manner). As fragile nations are unable to equitably and effectively perform the functions of a state, these countries are much more prone to violent unrest and mass inequality. Additionally, in countries with high levels of inequality (a common problem in countries with inadequate governing institutions), much higher growth rates are needed to reduce the rate of poverty when compared with other nations. Not to mention, after removing China and India from the equation, up to 70% of the world's poor live in fragile states by some definitions of fragility. Looking further, some analysts project extreme poverty will be increasingly concentrated in fragile, low-income states like Haiti, Yemen and the Central African Republic over the coming years. However, some academics, such as <a href="Andy%20Sumner">Andy Sumner</a>, assert that extreme poverty will be increasingly found concentrated in Middle Income Countries, creating a "poverty paradox" – as the World's poor don't actually live in the poorest countries.

Despite this debate, addressing the problem of fragility remains a very real issue. To help low-income, fragile states make the transition towards peace and prosperity, the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States, endorsed by roughly forty countries and multilateral institutions, was created in 2011. This "New Deal," represents an important step towards redressing the problem of fragility as it was originally articulated by self-identified fragile states who called on the international community to not only "do things differently," but to also "do different things."

On the other hand, civil conflict also remains a prime cause for the perpetuation of poverty throughout the developing world. Armed conflict can have severe effects on economic growth for a plethora of reasons – it destroys assets, creates unwanted mass migration, destroys livelihoods and diverts public resources towards war fighting. Significantly, a country that experienced major violence during 1981–2005 had extreme poverty rates 21 percentage points higher than a country with no violence. On average, a civil conflict will also cost a country roughly 30 years of GDP growth. Therefore, a renewed commitment from the international community to address the deteriorating situation in highly fragile states is necessary to both prevent the mass loss of life, but to also prevent the vicious cycle of extreme poverty.

In 2013, a prevalent finding in a report by the World Bank was that extreme poverty is most prevalent in what they call low income countries. In these countries the World Bank found that progress in poverty reduction is slowest, the poor live under terrible conditions and the most affected persons are children age 12 and under.

In September 2000, world leaders gathered at the <a href="Millennium%20Summit">Millennium Summit</a> held in New York, launching the <a href="United%20Nations%20Millennium%20Project">United Nations Millennium Project</a> suggested by then UN Secretary-General <a href="Kofi%20Annan">Kofi Annan</a>. Prior to the launch of the conference, the office of Secretary-General Annan released a report entitled We The Peoples: The Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century. In this document, now widely known as the Millennium Report, Kofi Annan called on the international community "to adopt the target of halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, and so lifting more than 1 billion people out of it, by 2015." Citing studies that show "an almost perfect correlation between growth and poverty reduction in poor countries," Annan urged international leaders to indiscriminately target the problem of extreme poverty across every region. In charge of managing the project was Jeffrey Sachs, a noted development economist, who in 2005 released a plan for action called "Investing in Development: A Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals."

The <a href="2005%20World%20Summit">2005 World Summit</a>, held in September and was organized to measure international progress towards fulfilling the <a href="Millennium%20Development%20Goals">Millennium Development Goals</a> (MDGs). Notably, the conference brought together more than 170 Heads of State. While world leaders at the summit were encouraged by the reduction of poverty in some nations, they were concerned by the uneven decline of poverty within and among different regions of the globe. However, at the end of the summit, the conference attendees reaffirmed the UN's commitment to achieve the MDGs by 2015 and urged all supranational, national and non-governmental organizations to follow suit.

With the expiration of the Millennium Development Goals approaching in 2015, the international community is focused on accelerating efforts to achieve the goals laid out in the original MDGs. Overall, there has been significant progress towards reducing extreme poverty, with the MDG 1 target of reducing extreme poverty rates by half, met "five years ahead of the 2015 deadline…700 million fewer people lived in conditions of extreme poverty in 2010 than in 1990. However, at the global level 1.2 billion people [were] still living in extreme poverty." One notable exception to this trend was in Sub-Saharan Africa, the only region where the number of people living in extreme poverty rose from 290 million in 1990 to 414 million in 2010, comprising more than a third of those living in extreme poverty worldwide.

With the aforementioned in mind, the UN convened a High Level Panel (HLP) of Eminent Persons, to advise on a <a href="Post-2015%20Development%20Agenda">Post-2015 Development Agenda</a>. The HLP report, entitled A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform Economies Through Sustainable Development, was published in May 2013. In the report, the HLP wrote that:

Thus, the report determined that a central goal of the Post-Millennium Development agenda is to "eradicate extreme poverty…by 2030." However, the report also emphasized that the MDGs were not enough, as they did not "focus on the devastating effects of conflict and violence on development…the importance to development of good governance and institution…nor the need for inclusive growth..." Consequently, there now exists synergy between the policy position papers put forward by the United States (through USAID), the World Bank and the UN itself in terms of viewing fragility and a lack of good governance as exacerbating extreme poverty. However, in a departure from the views of other organizations, the commission also proposed that the UN focus not only on extreme poverty (a line drawn at $1.25), but also on a higher target, such as $2. The report notes this change could be made to reflect the fact that escaping extreme poverty is "only a start."

In addition to the UN, a host of other supranational and national actors such as the European Union and the African Union have published their own positions or recommendations on what should be incorporated in the Post-2015 agenda. The European Commission's communication, published in A decent Life for all: from vision to collective action, affirmed the UN's commitment to "eradicate extreme poverty in our lifetime and put the world on a sustainable path to ensure a decent life for all by 2030." A unique vision of the report was the Commission's environmental focus (in addition to a plethora of other goals such as combating hunger and gender inequality). Specifically, the Commission argued, "long-term poverty reduction…requires inclusive and sustainable growth. Growth should create decent jobs, take place with resource efficiency and within planetary boundaries, and should support efforts to mitigate climate change." The African Union's report, entitled Common African Position (CAP) on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, likewise encouraged the international community to focus on eradicating the twin problems of "poverty and exclusion" in our lifetime. Moreover, the CAP pledged that it would "commit to ensure that no person – regardless of ethnicity, gender, geography, disability, race or other status – is denied universal human rights and basic economic opportunities."

The UN <a href="Least%20Developed%20Country">Least Developed Country</a> (LDC) conferences were a series of summits organized by the UN over the past few decades, which sought to promote the substantial and even development of so-called "third-world" countries.

1st UN LDC Conference

Held between September 1 and September 14, 1981, in Paris, the first UN LDC Conference was organized to finalize the UN's "Substantial New Programme of Action" for the 1980s in Least Developed Countries. This program, which was unanimously adopted by the conference attendees, argued for internal reforms in LDCs (meant to encourage economic growth) to be complemented by strong international measures. However, despite the major economic and policy reforms initiated many of these LDCs, in addition to strong international aid, the economic situation of these countries worsened as a whole in the 1980s. This prompted the organization of a 2nd UN LDC conference almost a decade later.

2nd UN LDC Conference

Held between September 3 and September 14, 1990, once again in Paris, the second UN LDC Conference was convened to measure the progress made by the LDCs towards fulfilling their development goals during the 1980s. Recognizing the problems that plagued the LDCs over the past decade, the conference formulated a new set of national and international policies to accelerate the growth rates of the poorest nations. These new principles were embodied in the "Paris Declaration and Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s."

4th UN LDC Conference

The most recent conference, held in May 2011 in Istanbul, recognized that the nature of development had fundamentally changed since the 1st conference held almost 30 years earlier. In the 21st century, the capital flow into emerging economies has increasingly become dominated by foreign direct investment and remittances, as opposed to bilateral and multilateral assistance. Moreover, since the 80s, significant structural changes have taken place on the international stage. With the creation of the G-20 conference of the largest economic powers, including many nations in the Global South, formerly "undeveloped" nations are now able to have a much larger say in international relations. Furthermore, the conference recognized that in the midst of a deep global recession, coupled with multiple crises (energy, climate, food, etc.), the international community would have fewer resources to aid the LDCs. Thus, the UN considered the participation of a wide range of stakeholders (not least the LDCs themselves), crucial to the formulation of the conference.

In 2013, the Board of Governors of the <a href="World%20Bank%20Group">World Bank Group</a> (WBG) set two overriding goals for the WBG to commit itself to in the future. First, to end extreme poverty by 2030, an objective that echoes the sentiments of the UN and the Obama administration. Additionally, the WBG set an interim target of reducing extreme poverty to below 9 percent by 2020. Second, to focus on growth among the bottom 40 percent of people, as opposed to standard GDP growth. This commitment ensures that the growth of the developing world lifts people out of poverty, rather than exacerbating inequality.

As the World Bank's primary focus is on delivering economic growth to enable equitable prosperity, its developments programs are primarily commercial-based in nature, as opposed to the UN. Since the World Bank recognizes better jobs will result in higher income and thus, less poverty, the WBG seeks to support employment training initiatives, small business development programs and strong labor protection laws. However, since much of the growth in the developing world has been inequitable, the World Bank has also begun teaming with client states to map out trends in inequality and to propose public policy changes that can level the playing field.

Moreover, the World Bank engages in a variety of nutritional, transfer payments and transport-based initiatives. Children who experience under-nutrition from conception to two years of age have a much higher risk of physical and mental disability. Thus, they are often trapped in poverty and are unable to make a full contribution to the social and economic development of their communities as adults. The WBG estimates that as much as 3% of GDP can be lost as a result of under-nutrition among the poorest nations. To combat undernutrition, the WBG has partnered with UNICEF and the WHO to ensure all small children are fully fed. The WBG also offers conditional cash transfers to poor households who meet certain requirements such as maintaining children's healthcare or ensuring school attendance. Finally, the WBG understands investment in public transportation and better roads is key to breaking rural isolation, improving access to healthcare and providing better job opportunities for the World's poor.

1. OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs)

The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (<a href="OCHA">OCHA</a>) of the United Nations works to synchronize the disparate international, national and non-governmental efforts to contest poverty. The OCHA seeks to prevent "confusion" in relief operations and to ensure that the humanitarian response to disaster situations has greater accountability and predictability. To do so, OCHA has begun deploying Humanitarian Coordinators and Country Teams to provide a solid architecture for the international community to work through.

2. UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund)

The United Nation's Children's Fund (<a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a>) was created by the UN to provide food, clothing and healthcare to European children facing famine and disease in the immediate aftermath of World War II. After the UN General Assembly extended UNICEF's mandate indefinitely in 1953, it actively worked to help children in extreme poverty in more than 190 countries and territories to overcome the obstacles that poverty, violence, disease and discrimination place in a child's path. Its current focus areas are 1) Child survival & development 2) Basic education & gender equality 3) Children and HIV/AIDS and 4) Child protection.

3. UNHCR (The UN Refugee Agency)

The UN Refugee Agency (<a href="UNHCR">UNHCR</a>) is mandated to lead and coordinate international action to protect refugees worldwide. Its primary purpose is to safeguard the rights of refugees by ensuring anyone can exercise the right to seek asylum in another state, with the option to return home voluntarily, integrate locally or resettle in a third country. The UNHCR operates in over 125 countries, helping approximately 33.9 million persons.

4. WFP (World Food Program)

The World Food Program (<a href="WFP">WFP</a>) is the largest agency dedicated to fighting hunger worldwide. On average, WFP brings food assistance to more than 90 million people in 75 countries. The WFP not only strives to prevent hunger in the present, but also in the future by developing stronger communities which will make food even more secure on their own. The WFP has a range of expertise from Food Security Analysis, Nutrition, Food Procurement and Logistics.

5. WHO (World Health Organization)

The World Health Organization (<a href="WHO">WHO</a>) is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, articulating evidence-based policy decisions and combating diseases that are induced from poverty, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Moreover, the WHO deals with pressing issues ranging from managing water safety, to dealing with maternal and newborn health.

The U.S. Agency for International Development (<a href="USAID">USAID</a>) is the lead U.S. government agency dedicated to ending extreme poverty. Currently the largest bilateral donor in the world, the United States channels the majority of its "development" assistance through USAID and the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">U.S. Department of State</a>. In President Obama's 2013 <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union">State of the Union</a> address, he declared "So the United States will join with our allies to eradicate such extreme poverty in the next two decades...which is within our reach." In response to Obama's call to action, USAID has made ending extreme poverty central to its mission statement. Under its New Model of Development, USAID seeks to eradicate extreme poverty through the use of innovation in science and technology, by putting a greater emphasis on evidence based decision-making, and through leveraging the ingenuity of the private sector and global citizens.

A major initiative of the Obama Administration is Power Africa, which aims to bring energy to 20 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa. By reaching out to its international partners, whether commercial or public, the US has leveraged over $14 billion in outside commitments after investing only $7 billion USD of its own. To ensure that Power Africa reaches the region's poorest, the initiative engages in a transaction based approach to create systematic change. This includes expanding access to electricity to more than 20,000 additional households which already live without power.

In terms of specific programming, USAID works in a variety of fields from preventing hunger, reducing HIV/AIDS, providing general health assistance and democracy assistance, as well as dealing with gender issues. To deal with <a href="food%20security">food security</a>, which affects roughly 842 million people (who go to bed hungry each night), USAID coordinates the <a href="Feed%20the%20Future%20Initiative">Feed the Future Initiative</a> (FtF). FtF aims to reduce poverty and undernutrition each by 20 percent over five years. Thanks to the <a href="President%27s%20Emergency%20Plan%20for%20AIDS%20Relief">President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief</a> (PEPFAR) and a variety of congruent actors, the incidence of AIDS and HIV, which used to ravage Africa, has reduced in scope and intensity. Through PEPFAR, the United States has ensured over five million people have received life-saving antiviral drugs, a significant proportion of the eight million people receiving treatment in relatively poor nations.

In terms of general health assistance, USAID has worked to reduce maternal mortality by 30 percent, under-five child mortality by 35 percent, and has accomplished a host of other goals. USAID also supports the gamut of democratic initiatives, from promoting human rights and accountable, fair governance, to supporting free and fair elections and the rule of law. In pursuit of these goals, USAID has increased global political participation by training more than 9,800 domestic election observers and providing civic education to more than 6.5 million people. Since 2012, the Agency has begun integrating critical gender perspectives across all aspects of its programming to ensure all USAID initiatives work to eliminate gender disparities. To do so, USAID seeks to increase the capability of women and girls to realize their rights and determine their own life outcomes. Moreover, USAID supports additional programs to improve women's access to capital and markets, builds theirs skills in agriculture, and supports women's desire to own businesses.

The <a href="Department%20for%20International%20Development">Department for International Development</a> (DfID) is the UK's lead agency for eradicating extreme poverty. To do so, DfID focuses on the creation of jobs, empowering women and rapidly responding to humanitarian emergencies.

Some specific examples of DfID projects include governance assistance, educational initiatives, and funding cutting-edge research. In 2014 alone, DfID will support "freer and fairer" elections in 13 countries. DfID will also help provide 10 million women with access to justice through strengthened judicial systems and will help 40 million people make their authorities more accountable. By 2015, DfID will have helped 9 million children attend primary school, at least half of which will be girls. Furthermore, through the Research4Development (R4D) project, DfID has funded over 35,000 projects in the name of creating new technologies to help the world's poorest. These technologies include: vaccines for diseases of African cattle, better diagnostic methods for tuberculosis, new drugs for combating malaria, and developing flood-resistant rice. In addition to technological research, the R4D is also used to fund projects that seek to understand what, specifically, about governance structures can be changed to help the world's poorest.

A multitude of non-governmental organizations operate in the field of extreme poverty, actively working to alleviate the poorest of the poor of their deprivation. To name but a few notable organizations: <a href="Save%20the%20Children">Save the Children</a>, The <a href="Overseas%20Development%20Institute">Overseas Development Institute</a>, <a href="Concern%20Worldwide">Concern Worldwide</a>, <a href="ONE%20Campaign">ONE</a>, trickleUP and <a href="Oxfam">Oxfam</a> have all done a considerable amount of work in extreme poverty.

Save the Children is the leading international organization dedicated to helping the World's indigent children. In 2013 alone, Save the Children reached over 143 million children through their work, including over 52 million children directly. Save the Children also recently released their own report titled "Getting to Zero", in which they argued the international community could feasibly do more than lift the world's poor above $1.25/day. The <a href="Overseas%20Development%20Institute">Overseas Development Institute</a> (ODI) is the premier UK based think tank on international development and humanitarian issues. ODI is dedicated to alleviating the suffering of the world's poor by providing high-quality research and practical policy advice to the World's development officials. ODI also recently released a paper entitled, "The Chronic Poverty Report 2014–2015: The road to zero extreme poverty]", in which its authors assert that though the international communities' goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030 is laudable, much more targeted resources will be necessary to reach said target. The report states that "To eradicate extreme poverty, massive global investment is required in social assistance, education and pro-poorest economic growth".

Concern Worldwide is an international humanitarian organization whose mission is to end extreme poverty by influencing decision makers at all levels of government (local -> international). Concern has also produced a report on extreme poverty in which they explain their own conception of extreme poverty from a NGO's standpoint. In this paper, named "How Concern Understands Extreme Poverty]", the report's creators write that extreme poverty entails more than just living under $1.25/day, it also includes having a small number of assets and being vulnerable to severe negative shocks (whether natural or man made).

ONE, the organization cofounded by <a href="Bono">Bono</a>, is a non-profit organization funded almost entirely by foundations, individual philanthropists and corporations. ONE's goals include raising public awareness and working with political leaders to fight preventable diseases, increase government accountability and increase investment in nutrition. Finally, trickleUp is a microenterprise development program targeted at those living on under $1.25/day, which provides the indigent with resources to build a sustainable livelihood through both direct financing and considerable training efforts.

Another NGO that works to end extreme poverty is Oxfam. This non-governmental organization works prominently in Africa; their mission is to improve local community organizations and it works to reduce impediments to the development of the country. Oxfam helps families suffering from poverty receive food and healthcare to survive. There are many children in Africa experiencing growth stunting, and this is one example of an issue that Oxfam targets and aims to resolve.

Analytical Engine

The Analytical Engine was a proposed mechanical <a href="general-purpose%20computer">general-purpose computer</a> designed by English mathematician and computer pioneer <a href="Charles%20Babbage">Charles Babbage</a>. It was first described in 1837 as the successor to Babbage's <a href="difference%20engine">difference engine</a>, a design for a mechanical computer. The Analytical Engine incorporated an <a href="arithmetic%20logic%20unit">arithmetic logic unit</a>, <a href="control%20flow">control flow</a> in the form of <a href="conditional%20branching">conditional branching</a> and <a href="program%20loop%23Loops">loops</a>, and integrated <a href="computer%20memory">memory</a>, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as <a href="Turing-complete">Turing-complete</a>. In other words, the logical structure of the Analytical Engine was essentially the same as that which has dominated computer design in the electronic era.

Babbage was never able to complete construction of any of his machines due to conflicts with his chief engineer and inadequate funding. It was not until the 1940s that <a href="history%20of%20computing%20hardware%23Electronic%20digital%20computation">the first general-purpose computers</a> were actually built, more than a century after Babbage had proposed the pioneering Analytical Engine in 1837.

Babbage's first attempt at a mechanical computing device, the <a href="Difference%20Engine">Difference Engine</a>, was a special-purpose machine designed to tabulate <a href="logarithm">logarithm</a>s and <a href="trigonometric%20function">trigonometric function</a>s by evaluating <a href="finite%20difference">finite difference</a>s to create approximating <a href="polynomial">polynomial</a>s. Construction of this machine was never completed; Babbage had conflicts with his chief engineer, <a href="Joseph%20Clement">Joseph Clement</a>, and ultimately the British government withdrew its funding for the project.

During this project, he realized that a much more general design, the Analytical Engine, was possible. The work on the design of the Analytical Engine started in c. 1833.

The input, consisting of programs and data ("formulae" and "data") was to be provided to the machine via <a href="punched%20card">punched card</a>s, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical <a href="loom">loom</a>s such as the <a href="Jacquard%20loom">Jacquard loom</a>. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. It employed ordinary <a href="base-10">base-10</a> fixed-point arithmetic.

There was to be a store (that is, a memory) capable of holding 1,000 numbers of 40 decimal digits each (ca. 16.2 <a href="Kilobyte">kB</a>). An <a href="Arithmetic%20logic%20unit">arithmetical unit</a> (the "mill") would be able to perform all four <a href="arithmetic%20operations">arithmetic operations</a>, plus comparisons and optionally <a href="square%20root">square root</a>s. Initially (1838) it was conceived as a <a href="difference%20engine">difference engine</a> curved back upon itself, in a generally circular layout, with the long store exiting off to one side. Later drawings (1858) depict a regularized grid layout. Like the <a href="central%20processing%20unit">central processing unit</a> (CPU) in a modern computer, the mill would rely upon its <a href="Microcode">own internal procedures</a>, to be stored in the form of pegs inserted into rotating drums called "barrels", to carry out some of the more complex instructions the user's program might specify.

The programming language to be employed by users was akin to modern day <a href="assembly%20language">assembly language</a>s. Loops and conditional branching were possible, and so the language as conceived would have been <a href="Turing-complete">Turing-complete</a> as later defined by <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a>. Three different types of punch cards were used: one for arithmetical operations, one for numerical constants, and one for load and store operations, transferring numbers from the store to the arithmetical unit or back. There were three separate readers for the three types of cards. Babbage developed some two dozen programs for the Analytical Engine between 1837 and 1840, and one program later. These programs treat polynomials, iterative formulas, <a href="Gaussian%20elimination">Gaussian elimination</a>, and <a href="Bernoulli%20numbers">Bernoulli numbers</a>.

In 1842, the Italian mathematician <a href="Luigi%20Federico%20Menabrea">Luigi Federico Menabrea</a> published a description of the engine based on a lecture by Babbage in French. In 1843, the description was translated into English and extensively annotated by <a href="Ada%20Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>, who had become interested in the engine eight years earlier. In recognition of her additions to Menabrea's paper, which included a way to calculate Bernoulli numbers using the machine, she has been described as the first <a href="computer%20programmer">computer programmer</a>.

Late in his life, Babbage sought ways to build a simplified version of the machine, and assembled a small part of it before his death in 1871.

In 1878, a committee of the <a href="British%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Science">British Association for the Advancement of Science</a> described the Analytical Engine as "a marvel of mechanical ingenuity", but recommended against constructing it. The committee acknowledged the usefulness and value of the machine, but could not estimate the cost of building it, and were unsure whether the machine would function correctly after being built.

In 1906 Babbage's son Henry Prevost Babbage constructed a part of the mill and the printing apparatus, and calculated a (faulty) list of multiples of <a href="pi">pi</a> (published in 1910). This constituted only a small part of the whole engine; it was not programmable and had no storage. (Popular images of this section have sometimes been mislabelled, implying that it was the entire mill or even the entire engine.) Henry Babbage's "Analytical Engine Mill" is on display at the Science Museum in London. Henry also proposed building a demonstration version of the full engine, with a smaller storage capacity: "perhaps for a first machine ten (columns) would do, with fifteen wheels in each". Such a version could manipulate 20 numbers of 25 digits each, and what it could be told to do with those numbers could still be impressive. "It is only a question of cards and time", wrote Henry Babbage in 1888, "... and there is no reason why (twenty thousand) cards should not be used if necessary, in an Analytical Engine for the purposes of the mathematician".

In 1991, the <a href="London%20Science%20Museum">London Science Museum</a> built a complete and working specimen of Babbage's <a href="Difference%20Engine%20No.%202">Difference Engine No. 2</a>, a design that incorporated refinements Babbage discovered during the development of the Analytical Engine. This machine was built using materials and <a href="engineering%20tolerance">engineering tolerance</a>s that would have been available to Babbage, quelling the suggestion that Babbage's designs could not have been produced using the manufacturing technology of his time.

In October 2010, <a href="John%20Graham-Cumming">John Graham-Cumming</a> started a "Plan 28" campaign to raise funds by "public subscription" to enable serious historical and academic study of Babbage's plans, with a view to then build and test a fully working virtual design which will then in turn enable construction of the physical Analytical Engine. As of May 2016, actual construction had not been attempted, since no consistent understanding could yet be obtained from Babbage’s original design drawings. By 2017, the "Plan 28" effort reported that a searchable database of all catalogued material was available, and an initial review of Babbage’s voluminous Scribbling Books had been completed.

Babbage is not known to have written down an explicit set of instructions for the engine in the manner of a modern processor manual. Instead he showed his programs as lists of states during their execution, showing what operator was run at each step with little indication of how the control flow would be guided.

<a href="Allan%20G.%20Bromley">Allan G. Bromley</a> has assumed that the card deck could be read in forwards and backwards directions as a function of conditional branching after testing for conditions, which would make the engine Turing-complete:

...the cards could be ordered to move forward and reverse (and hence to loop)...

The introduction for the first time, in 1845, of user operations for a variety of service functions including, most importantly, an effective system for user control of looping in user programs.

There is no indication how the direction of turning of the operation and variable cards is specified. In the absence of other evidence I have had to adopt the minimal default assumption that both the operation and variable cards can only be turned backward as is necessary to implement the loops used in Babbage’s sample programs. There would be no mechanical or microprogramming difficulty in placing the direction of motion under the control of the user.

In their emulator of the engine, <a href="Fourmilab">Fourmilab</a> say:

The Engine's Card Reader is not constrained to simply process the cards in a chain one after another from start to finish. It can, in addition, directed by the very cards it reads and advised by the whether the Mill's run-up lever is activated, either advance the card chain forward, skipping the intervening cards, or backward, causing previously-read cards to be processed once again.

This emulator does provide a written symbolic instruction set, though this has been constructed by its authors rather than based on Babbage's original works. For example, a factorial program would be written as:

where the CB is the conditional branch instruction or "combination card' used to make the control flow jump, in this case backwards by 11 cards.

Babbage understood that the existence of an automatic computer would kindle interest in the field now known as <a href="algorithmic%20efficiency">algorithmic efficiency</a>, writing in his "Passages from the Life of a Philosopher", "As soon as an Analytical Engine exists, it will necessarily guide the future course of the science. Whenever any result is sought by its aid, the question will then arise—By what course of calculation can these results be arrived at by the machine in the "shortest time"?"

The incomplete Analytical Engine was put on display to the public at the <a href="1862%20International%20Exhibition">1862 International Exhibition</a> in <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>, <a href="London">London</a>.

Swedish engineers <a href="Per%20Georg%20Scheutz">Georg and Edvard Scheutz</a>, inspired by a description of the difference engine, created a mechanical calculation device based on the design in 1853. Table-sized instead of room-sized, the device was capable of calculating tables, but imperfectly.

From 1872 Henry continued diligently with his father's work and then intermittently in retirement in 1875. <a href="Percy%20Ludgate">Percy Ludgate</a> wrote about the engine in 1915 and even designed his own Analytical Engine (it was drawn up in detail, but never built) about 1909. Ludgate's engine would be much smaller than Babbage's of about 8 cubic feet (230 L), and hypothetically would be capable of multiplying two 20-decimal-digit numbers in about six seconds.

Despite this groundwork, Babbage's work fell into historical obscurity, and the Analytical Engine was unknown to builders of electro-mechanical and electronic computing machines in the 1930s and 1940s when they began their work, resulting in the need to re-invent many of the architectural innovations Babbage had proposed. <a href="Howard%20Aiken">Howard Aiken</a>, who built the quickly-obsoleted electromechanical calculator, the <a href="Harvard%20Mark%20I">Harvard Mark I</a>, between 1937 and 1945, praised Babbage's work likely as a way of enhancing his own stature, but knew nothing of the Analytical Engine's architecture during the construction of the Mark I, and considered his visit to the constructed portion of the Analytical Engine "the greatest disappointment of my life". The Mark I showed no influence from the Analytical Engine and lacked the Analytical Engine's most prescient architectural feature, <a href="conditional%20branching">conditional branching</a>. <a href="J.%20Presper%20Eckert">J. Presper Eckert</a> and <a href="John%20W.%20Mauchly">John W. Mauchly</a> similarly were not aware of the details of Babbage's Analytical Engine work prior to the completion of their design for the first electronic general-purpose computer, the <a href="ENIAC">ENIAC</a>.

If the Analytical Engine had been built, it would have been <a href="Digital%20data">digital</a>, <a href="Computer%20program">programmable</a> and <a href="Turing%20completeness">Turing-complete</a>. It would, however, have been very slow. Luigi Federico Menabrea reported in "Sketch of the Analytical Engine": "Mr. Babbage believes he can, by his engine, form the product of two numbers, each containing twenty figures, in three minutes".
By comparison the <a href="Harvard%20Mark%20I">Harvard Mark I</a> could perform the same task in just six seconds. A modern PC can do the same thing in well under a millionth of a second.

Augustus

Augustus (; 23 September 63 BC – 19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the Roman <a href="Principate">Principate</a> and considered the first <a href="Roman%20emperor">Roman emperor</a>, controlling the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. He was born Gaius Octavius into an old and wealthy <a href="equites">equestrian branch</a> of the <a href="plebs">plebeian</a> <a href="Octavia%20%28gens%29">"gens" Octavia</a>. His maternal great-uncle <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> was <a href="assassination%20of%20Julius%20Caesar">assassinated</a> in 44 BC, and Octavius was named in Caesar's will as his <a href="Adoption%20in%20ancient%20Rome">adopted</a> son and heir, then known as Octavianus (<a href="Anglicisation">Anglicized</a> as Octavian). He, <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a>, and <a href="Marcus%20Aemilius%20Lepidus%20%28triumvir%29">Marcus Lepidus</a> formed the <a href="Second%20Triumvirate">Second Triumvirate</a> to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Philippi">Battle of Philippi</a>, the Triumvirate divided the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a> among themselves and ruled as <a href="military%20dictatorship">military dictators</a>. The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart by the competing ambitions of its members. Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Actium">Battle of Actium</a> by Octavian in 31 BC.

After the demise of the Second Triumvirate, Augustus restored the outward façade of the free Republic, with governmental power vested in the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a>, the <a href="Roman%20magistrate">executive magistrates</a>, and the <a href="Roman%20assemblies">legislative assemblies</a>. In reality, however, he retained his autocratic power over the Republic as a military dictator. By law, Augustus held a collection of powers granted to him for life by the Senate, including <a href="commander-in-chief">supreme military command</a>, and those of <a href="tribune">tribune</a> and <a href="Roman%20censor">censor</a>. It took several years for Augustus to develop the framework within which a formally republican state could be led under his sole rule. He rejected monarchical titles, and instead called himself "<a href="Princeps">Princeps</a> Civitatis" ("First Citizen of the State"). The resulting <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire">constitutional framework</a> became known as the <a href="Principate">Principate</a>, the first phase of the Roman Empire.

The reign of Augustus initiated an era of relative peace known as the "<a href="Pax%20Romana">Pax Romana</a>" ("The Roman Peace"). The Roman world was largely free from large-scale conflict for more than two centuries, despite continuous wars of imperial expansion on the Empire's frontiers and the year-long civil war known as the "<a href="Year%20of%20the%20Four%20Emperors">Year of the Four Emperors</a>" over the imperial succession. Augustus dramatically enlarged the Empire, annexing <a href="Egypt%20%28Roman%20province%29">Egypt</a>, <a href="Dalmatia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Dalmatia</a>, <a href="Pannonia">Pannonia</a>, <a href="Noricum">Noricum</a>, and <a href="Raetia">Raetia</a>; expanding possessions in <a href="Africa%20%28Roman%20province%29">Africa</a>; expanding into <a href="Germania">Germania</a>; and completing the conquest of <a href="Hispania">Hispania</a>. Beyond the frontiers, he secured the Empire with a buffer region of <a href="client%20state">client state</a>s and made peace with the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian Empire</a> through diplomacy. He reformed the Roman system of taxation, developed <a href="Roman%20roads">networks of roads</a> with an official <a href="courier">courier</a> system, established a standing army, established the <a href="Praetorian%20Guard">Praetorian Guard</a>, created official <a href="cohortes%20urbanae">police</a> and <a href="vigiles">fire-fighting services</a> for Rome, and rebuilt much of the city during his reign.

Augustus died in AD 14 at the age of 75. He probably died from natural causes, although there were unconfirmed rumors that his wife <a href="Livia">Livia</a> poisoned him. He was succeeded as Emperor by his adopted son (also stepson and former son-in-law) <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius</a>.

Augustus (;
) was known by many names throughout his life:

While his paternal family was from the town of <a href="Velletri">Velletri</a>, approximately from Rome, Augustus was born in the city of Rome on 23 September 63 BC. He was born at Ox Head, a small property on the <a href="Palatine%20Hill">Palatine Hill</a>, very close to the <a href="Roman%20Forum">Roman Forum</a>. He was given the name Gaius Octavius Thurinus, his <a href="cognomen">cognomen</a> possibly commemorating his father's victory at <a href="Thurii">Thurii</a> over a rebellious band of <a href="Slavery%20in%20ancient%20Rome">slaves</a>.

Due to the crowded nature of Rome at the time, Octavius was taken to his father's home village at Velletri to be raised. Octavius only mentions his father's <a href="equestrian%20%28Roman%29">equestrian</a> family briefly in his memoirs. His paternal great-grandfather <a href="Gaius%20Octavius%20%28tribune%20216%20BC%29">Gaius Octavius</a> was a military tribune in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> during the <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second Punic War</a>. His grandfather had served in several local political offices. His father, also named <a href="Gaius%20Octavius%20%28proconsul%29">Gaius Octavius</a>, had been <a href="Roman%20governor">governor</a> of <a href="Macedonia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Macedonia</a>. His mother, <a href="Atia%20Balba%20Caesonia">Atia</a>, was the niece of Julius Caesar.
In 59 BC, when he was four years old, his father died. His mother married a former governor of Syria, <a href="Lucius%20Marcius%20Philippus%20%28consul%2056%20BC%29">Lucius Marcius Philippus</a>. Philippus claimed descent from <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, and was elected <a href="Roman%20consul">consul</a> in 56 BC. Philippus never had much of an interest in young Octavius. Because of this, Octavius was raised by his grandmother, <a href="Julia%20Minor%20%28sister%20of%20Caesar%29">Julia</a>, the sister of Julius Caesar.

Julia died in 52 or 51 BC, and Octavius delivered the funeral oration for his grandmother. From this point, his mother and stepfather took a more active role in raising him. He donned the "<a href="toga%20virilis">toga virilis</a>" four years later, and was elected to the <a href="College%20of%20Pontiffs">College of Pontiffs</a> in 47 BC. The following year he was put in charge of the <a href="Ancient%20Olympic%20Games">Greek games</a> that were staged in honor of the <a href="Temple%20of%20Venus%20Genetrix">Temple of Venus Genetrix</a>, built by Julius Caesar. According to <a href="Nicolaus%20of%20Damascus">Nicolaus of Damascus</a>, Octavius wished to join Caesar's staff for his campaign in <a href="Africa%20%28province%29">Africa</a>, but gave way when his mother protested. In 46 BC, she consented for him to join Caesar in Hispania, where he planned to fight the forces of <a href="Pompey">Pompey</a>, Caesar's late enemy, but Octavius fell ill and was unable to travel.

When he had recovered, he sailed to the front, but was shipwrecked; after coming ashore with a handful of companions, he crossed hostile territory to Caesar's camp, which impressed his great-uncle considerably. <a href="Marcus%20Velleius%20Paterculus">Velleius Paterculus</a> reports that after that time, Caesar allowed the young man to share his carriage. When back in Rome, Caesar deposited a new will with the <a href="Vestal%20Virgins">Vestal Virgins</a>, naming Octavius as the prime beneficiary.

Octavius was studying and undergoing military training in <a href="Apollonia%20%28Illyria%29">Apollonia</a>, <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a>, when Julius <a href="Assassination%20of%20Julius%20Caesar">Caesar was killed</a> on the <a href="Ides%20of%20March">Ides of March</a> (15 March) 44 BC. He rejected the advice of some army officers to take refuge with the troops in Macedonia and sailed to <a href="Italia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Italy</a> to ascertain whether he had any potential political fortunes or security. Caesar had no living legitimate children under Roman law, and so had <a href="adoption%20in%20Rome">adopted</a> Octavius, his grand-nephew, making him his primary heir. Mark Antony later charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favours, though <a href="Suetonius">Suetonius</a> describes Antony's accusation as political slander. After landing at Lupiae near <a href="Brundisium">Brundisium</a>, Octavius learned the contents of Caesar's will, and only then did he decide to become Caesar's political heir as well as heir to two-thirds of his estate.

Upon his adoption, Octavius assumed his great-uncle's name Gaius Julius Caesar. Roman citizens adopted into a new family usually retained their old <a href="Roman%20naming%20conventions">nomen</a> in cognomen form (e.g., "Octavianus" for one who had been an Octavius, "Aemilianus" for one who had been an Aemilius, etc.). However, though some of his contemporaries did, there is no evidence that Octavius ever himself officially used the name "Octavianus", as it would have made his modest origins too obvious. Historians usually refer to the new Caesar as "Octavian" during the time between his adoption and his assumption of the name Augustus in 27 BC in order to avoid confusing the dead dictator with his heir.

Octavian could not rely on his limited funds to make a successful entry into the upper echelons of the Roman political hierarchy. After a warm welcome by Caesar's soldiers at Brundisium, Octavian demanded a portion of the funds that were allotted by Caesar for the intended war against <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a> in the Middle East. This amounted to 700 million <a href="sestertius">sesterces</a> stored at Brundisium, the staging ground in Italy for military operations in the east.

A later senatorial investigation into the disappearance of the public funds took no action against Octavian, since he subsequently used that money to raise troops against the Senate's arch enemy Mark Antony. Octavian made another bold move in 44 BC when, without official permission, he appropriated the annual tribute that had been sent from Rome's <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a>ern province to Italy.

Octavian began to bolster his personal forces with Caesar's veteran legionaries and with troops designated for the Parthian war, gathering support by emphasizing his status as heir to Caesar. On his march to Rome through Italy, Octavian's presence and newly acquired funds attracted many, winning over Caesar's former veterans stationed in <a href="Campania">Campania</a>. By June, he had gathered an army of 3,000 loyal veterans, paying each a salary of 500 <a href="denarius">denarii</a>.

Arriving in Rome on 6 May 44 BC, Octavian found consul Mark Antony, Caesar's former colleague, in an uneasy truce with the dictator's assassins. They had been granted a general amnesty on 17 March, yet Antony succeeded in driving most of them out of Rome. This was due to his "inflammatory" eulogy given at Caesar's funeral, mounting public opinion against the assassins.

Mark Antony was amassing political support, but Octavian still had opportunity to rival him as the leading member of the faction supporting Caesar. Mark Antony had lost the support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he initially opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status. Octavian failed to persuade Antony to relinquish Caesar's money to him. During the summer, he managed to win support from Caesarian sympathizers, however, who saw the younger heir as the lesser evil and hoped to manipulate him, or to bear with him during their efforts to get rid of Antony.

Octavian began to make common cause with the <a href="Optimates">Optimates</a>, the former enemies of Caesar. In September, the leading Optimate orator <a href="Cicero">Marcus Tullius Cicero</a> began to attack Antony in a <a href="Philippicae">series of speeches</a> portraying him as a threat to the Republican order. With opinion in Rome turning against him and his year of consular power nearing its end, Antony attempted to pass laws that would lend him control over <a href="Cisalpine%20Gaul">Cisalpine Gaul</a>, which had been assigned as part of his province, from <a href="Decimus%20Junius%20Brutus%20Albinus">Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus</a>, one of Caesar's assassins.

Octavian meanwhile built up a private army in Italy by recruiting Caesarian veterans and, on 28 November, he won over two of Antony's legions with the enticing offer of monetary gain. In the face of Octavian's large and capable force, Antony saw the danger of staying in Rome and, to the relief of the <a href="Roman%20senate">Senate</a>, he fled to Cisalpine Gaul, which was to be handed to him on 1 January.

Decimus Brutus refused to give up Cisalpine Gaul, so Antony besieged him at <a href="Mutina">Mutina</a>. Antony rejected the resolutions passed by the Senate to stop the violence, as the Senate had no army of its own to challenge him. This provided an opportunity for Octavian, who already was known to have armed forces. Cicero also defended Octavian against Antony's taunts about Octavian's lack of noble lineage and aping of Julius Caesar's name, stating "we have no more brilliant example of traditional piety among our youth."

At the urging of Cicero, the Senate inducted Octavian as senator on 1 January 43 BC, yet he also was given the power to vote alongside the former consuls. In addition, Octavian was granted "<a href="propraetor">propraetor</a>" "<a href="imperium">imperium</a>" (commanding power) which legalized his command of troops, sending him to relieve the siege along with <a href="Aulus%20Hirtius">Hirtius</a> and <a href="Gaius%20Vibius%20Pansa%20Caetronianus">Pansa</a> (the consuls for 43 BC). In April 43 BC, Antony's forces were defeated at the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Forum%20Gallorum">Forum Gallorum</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Mutina">Mutina</a>, forcing Antony to retreat to <a href="Transalpine%20Gaul">Transalpine Gaul</a>. Both consuls were killed, however, leaving Octavian in sole command of their armies.

The senate heaped many more rewards on Decimus Brutus than on Octavian for defeating Antony, then attempted to give command of the consular legions to Decimus Brutus—yet Octavian decided not to cooperate. Instead, Octavian stayed in the <a href="Po%20Valley">Po Valley</a> and refused to aid any further offensive against Antony. In July, an embassy of <a href="centurion">centurion</a>s sent by Octavian entered Rome and demanded that he receive the consulship left vacant by Hirtius and Pansa.

Octavian also demanded that the decree should be rescinded which declared Antony a public enemy. When this was refused, he marched on the city with eight legions. He encountered no military opposition in Rome, and on 19 August 43 BC was elected consul with his relative <a href="Quintus%20Pedius">Quintus Pedius</a> as co-consul. Meanwhile, Antony formed an alliance with <a href="Marcus%20Aemilius%20Lepidus%20%28triumvir%29">Marcus Aemilius Lepidus</a>, another leading Caesarian.

In a meeting near <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a> in October 43 BC, Octavian, Antony, and Lepidus formed a <a href="Military%20dictatorship">junta</a> called the <a href="Second%20Triumvirate">Second Triumvirate</a>. This explicit arrogation of special powers lasting five years was then supported by law passed by the <a href="plebs">plebs</a>, unlike the unofficial <a href="First%20Triumvirate">First Triumvirate</a> formed by <a href="Gnaeus%20Pompeius%20Magnus">Pompey</a>, Julius Caesar, and <a href="Marcus%20Licinius%20Crassus">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a>. The triumvirs then set in motion <a href="proscription">proscription</a>s in which 300 senators and 2,000 "<a href="Equestrian%20%28Roman%29">equites</a>" allegedly were branded as <a href="outlaw">outlaw</a>s and deprived of their property and, for those who failed to escape, their lives.

The estimation that 300 senators were proscribed was presented by <a href="Appian">Appian</a>, although his earlier contemporary <a href="Livy">Livy</a> asserted that only 130 senators had been proscribed. This decree issued by the triumvirate was motivated in part by a need to raise money to pay the salaries of their troops for the upcoming conflict against Caesar's assassins, <a href="Marcus%20Junius%20Brutus%20the%20Younger">Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger</a> and <a href="Gaius%20Cassius%20Longinus">Gaius Cassius Longinus</a>. Rewards for their arrest gave incentive for Romans to capture those proscribed, while the assets and properties of those arrested were seized by the triumvirs.

Contemporary Roman historians provide conflicting reports as to which triumvir was more responsible for the proscriptions and killing. However, the sources agree that enacting the proscriptions was a means by all three factions to eliminate political enemies. <a href="Marcus%20Velleius%20Paterculus">Marcus Velleius Paterculus</a> asserted that Octavian tried to avoid proscribing officials whereas Lepidus and Antony were to blame for initiating them. <a href="Cassius%20Dio">Cassius Dio</a> defended Octavian as trying to spare as many as possible, whereas Antony and Lepidus, being older and involved in politics longer, had many more enemies to deal with.

This claim was rejected by Appian, who maintained that Octavian shared an equal interest with Lepidus and Antony in eradicating his enemies. Suetonius said that Octavian was reluctant to proscribe officials, but did pursue his enemies with more rigor than the other triumvirs. <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> described the proscriptions as a ruthless and cutthroat swapping of friends and family among Antony, Lepidus, and Octavian. For example, Octavian allowed the proscription of his ally Cicero, Antony the proscription of his maternal uncle <a href="Lucius%20Julius%20Caesar%20%28consul%2064%20BC%29">Lucius Julius Caesar</a> (the consul of 64 BC), and Lepidus his brother <a href="Lucius%20Aemilius%20Lepidus%20Paullus">Paullus</a>.

On 1 January 42 BC, the Senate posthumously recognized Julius Caesar as a divinity of the Roman state, "<a href="Divus%20Iulius">Divus Iulius</a>". Octavian was able to further his cause by emphasizing the fact that he was "<a href="Divi%20filius">Divi filius</a>", "Son of God". Antony and Octavian then sent 28 <a href="Roman%20legions">legions</a> by sea to face the armies of Brutus and Cassius, who had built their base of power in Greece. After two <a href="Battle%20of%20Philippi">battles at Philippi</a> in Macedonia in October 42, the Caesarian army was victorious and <a href="Marcus%20Junius%20Brutus">Brutus</a> and <a href="Gaius%20Cassius%20Longinus">Cassius</a> committed <a href="suicide">suicide</a>. Mark Antony later used the examples of these battles as a means to belittle Octavian, as both battles were decisively won with the use of Antony's forces. In addition to claiming responsibility for both victories, Antony also branded Octavian as a coward for handing over his direct military control to <a href="Marcus%20Vipsanius%20Agrippa">Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa</a> instead.

After Philippi, a new territorial arrangement was made among the members of the Second Triumvirate. <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a> and the provinces of Hispania and Italia were placed in the hands of Octavian. Antony traveled east to <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> where he allied himself with Queen <a href="Cleopatra%20VII%20of%20Egypt">Cleopatra VII</a>, the former lover of Julius Caesar and mother of Caesar's infant son <a href="Caesarion">Caesarion</a>. Lepidus was left with the <a href="Africa%20Province">province of Africa</a>, stymied by Antony, who conceded Hispania to Octavian instead.

Octavian was left to decide where in Italy to settle the tens of thousands of veterans of the Macedonian campaign, whom the triumvirs had promised to discharge. The tens of thousands who had fought on the republican side with Brutus and Cassius could easily ally with a political opponent of Octavian if not appeased, and they also required land. There was no more government-controlled land to allot as settlements for their soldiers, so Octavian had to choose one of two options: alienating many Roman citizens by confiscating their land, or alienating many Roman soldiers who could mount a considerable opposition against him in the Roman heartland. Octavian chose the former. There were as many as eighteen Roman towns affected by the new settlements, with entire populations driven out or at least given partial evictions.

There was widespread dissatisfaction with Octavian over these settlements of his soldiers, and this encouraged many to rally at the side of <a href="Lucius%20Antonius%20%28brother%20of%20Mark%20Antony%29">Lucius Antonius</a>, who was brother of Mark Antony and supported by a majority in the Senate. Meanwhile, Octavian asked for a divorce from <a href="Clodia%20Pulchra">Clodia Pulchra</a>, the daughter of <a href="Fulvia">Fulvia</a> (Mark Antony's wife) and her first husband <a href="Publius%20Clodius%20Pulcher">Publius Clodius Pulcher</a>. He returned Clodia to her mother, claiming that their marriage had never been consummated. Fulvia decided to take action. Together with Lucius Antonius, she raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian. Lucius and Fulvia took a political and martial gamble in opposing Octavian, however, since the Roman army still depended on the triumvirs for their salaries. Lucius and his allies ended up in a defensive siege at <a href="Perusia">Perusia</a> (modern <a href="Perugia">Perugia</a>), where Octavian forced them into surrender in early 40 BC.

Lucius and his army were spared, due to his kinship with Antony, the strongman of the East, while Fulvia was exiled to <a href="Sicyon">Sicyon</a>. Octavian showed no mercy, however, for the mass of allies loyal to Lucius; on 15 March, the anniversary of Julius Caesar's assassination, he had 300 Roman senators and equestrians executed for allying with Lucius. Perusia also was pillaged and burned as a warning for others. This bloody event sullied Octavian's reputation and was criticized by many, such as Augustan poet <a href="Sextus%20Propertius">Sextus Propertius</a>.
<a href="Sextus%20Pompeius">Sextus Pompeius</a> was the son of First Triumvir Pompey and still a renegade general following Julius Caesar's victory over his father. He was established in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> and <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a> as part of an agreement reached with the Second Triumvirate in 39 BC. Both Antony and Octavian were vying for an alliance with Pompeius, who was a member of the republican party, ironically, not the Caesarian faction. Octavian succeeded in a temporary alliance in 40 BC when he married <a href="Scribonia">Scribonia</a>, a daughter of <a href="Lucius%20Scribonius%20Libo">Lucius Scribonius Libo</a> who was a follower of Sextus Pompeius as well as his father-in-law. Scribonia gave birth to Octavian's only natural child, <a href="Julia%20the%20Elder">Julia</a>, who was born the same day that he divorced her to marry <a href="Livia">Livia Drusilla</a>, little more than a year after their marriage.

While in Egypt, Antony had been engaged in an affair with <a href="Cleopatra%20VII">Cleopatra</a> and had fathered three children with her. Aware of his deteriorating relationship with Octavian, Antony left Cleopatra; he sailed to Italy in 40 BC with a large force to oppose Octavian, laying siege to Brundisium. This new conflict proved untenable for both Octavian and Antony, however. Their centurions, who had become important figures politically, refused to fight due to their Caesarian cause, while the legions under their command followed suit. Meanwhile, in Sicyon, Antony's wife Fulvia died of a sudden illness while Antony was en route to meet her. Fulvia's death and the mutiny of their centurions allowed the two remaining triumvirs to effect a reconciliation.

In the autumn of 40, Octavian and Antony approved the Treaty of Brundisium, by which Lepidus would remain in Africa, Antony in the East, Octavian in the West. The Italian peninsula was left open to all for the recruitment of soldiers, but in reality, this provision was useless for Antony in the East. To further cement relations of alliance with Mark Antony, Octavian gave his sister, <a href="Octavia%20Minor">Octavia Minor</a>, in marriage to Antony in late 40 BC. During their marriage, Octavia gave birth to two daughters (known as <a href="Antonia%20the%20Elder">Antonia the Elder</a> and <a href="Antonia%20Minor">Antonia Minor</a>).

Sextus Pompeius threatened Octavian in Italy by denying shipments of grain through the Mediterranean to the peninsula. Pompeius' own son was put in charge as naval commander in the effort to cause widespread famine in Italy. Pompeius' control over the sea prompted him to take on the name "Neptuni filius", "son of <a href="Neptune%20%28mythology%29">Neptune</a>". A temporary peace agreement was reached in 39 BC with the <a href="treaty%20of%20Misenum">treaty of Misenum</a>; the blockade on Italy was lifted once Octavian granted Pompeius Sardinia, <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a>, Sicily, and the <a href="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>, and ensured him a future position as consul for 35 BC.

The territorial agreement between the triumvirate and Sextus Pompeius began to crumble once Octavian divorced Scribonia and married Livia on 17 January 38 BC. One of Pompeius' naval commanders betrayed him and handed over Corsica and Sardinia to Octavian. Octavian lacked the resources to confront Pompeius alone, however, so an agreement was reached with the Second Triumvirate's extension for another five-year period beginning in 37 BC.

In supporting Octavian, Antony expected to gain support for his own campaign against Parthia, desiring to avenge Rome's <a href="Battle%20of%20Carrhae">defeat at Carrhae</a> in 53 BC. In an agreement reached at <a href="Taranto">Tarentum</a>, Antony provided 120 ships for Octavian to use against Pompeius, while Octavian was to send 20,000 <a href="Legionary">legionaries</a> to Antony for use against Parthia. Octavian sent only a tenth of those promised, however, which Antony viewed as an intentional provocation.

Octavian and Lepidus launched a joint operation against Sextus in Sicily in 36 BC. Despite setbacks for Octavian, the naval fleet of Sextus Pompeius was almost entirely destroyed on 3 September by general Agrippa at the naval <a href="Battle%20of%20Naulochus">Battle of Naulochus</a>. Sextus fled to the east with his remaining forces, where he was captured and executed in <a href="Miletus">Miletus</a> by one of Antony's generals the following year. As Lepidus and Octavian accepted the surrender of Pompeius' troops, Lepidus attempted to claim Sicily for himself, ordering Octavian to leave. Lepidus' troops deserted him, however, and defected to Octavian since they were weary of fighting and were enticed by Octavian's promises of money.

Lepidus surrendered to Octavian and was permitted to retain the office of "<a href="Pontifex%20Maximus">Pontifex Maximus</a>" (head of the college of priests), but was ejected from the Triumvirate, his public career at an end, and effectively was exiled to a <a href="villa">villa</a> at Cape Circei in Italy. The Roman dominions were now divided between Octavian in the West and Antony in the East. Octavian ensured Rome's citizens of their rights to property in order to maintain peace and stability in his portion of the Empire. This time, he settled his discharged soldiers outside of Italy, while also returning 30,000 slaves to their former Roman owners—slaves who had fled to join Pompeius' army and navy. Octavian had the Senate grant him, his wife, and his sister <a href="tribune%20of%20the%20plebs">tribunal</a> <a href="Sovereign%20immunity">immunity</a>, or "<a href="sacrosanct">sacrosanct</a>itas", in order to ensure his own safety and that of Livia and Octavia once he returned to Rome.

Meanwhile, Antony's campaign turned disastrous against Parthia, tarnishing his image as a leader, and the mere 2,000 legionaries sent by Octavian to Antony were hardly enough to replenish his forces. On the other hand, Cleopatra could restore his army to full strength; he already was engaged in a romantic affair with her, so he decided to send Octavia back to Rome. Octavian used this to spread <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> implying that Antony was becoming less than Roman because he rejected a legitimate Roman spouse for an "Oriental <a href="Intimate%20relationship">paramour</a>". In 36 BC, Octavian used a political ploy to make himself look less autocratic and Antony more the villain by proclaiming that the civil wars were coming to an end, and that he would step down as triumvir—if only Antony would do the same. Antony refused.

Roman troops captured the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28antiquity%29">Kingdom of Armenia</a> in 34 BC, and Antony made his son Alexander Helios the ruler of Armenia. He also awarded the title "Queen of Kings" to Cleopatra, acts that Octavian used to convince the Roman Senate that Antony had ambitions to diminish the preeminence of Rome. Octavian became consul once again on 1 January 33 BC, and he opened the following session in the Senate with a vehement attack on Antony's grants of titles and territories to his relatives and to his queen.

The breach between Antony and Octavian prompted a large portion of the Senators, as well as both of that year's consuls, to leave Rome and defect to Antony. However, Octavian received two key deserters from Antony in the autumn of 32 BC: Munatius Plancus and Marcus Titius. These defectors gave Octavian the information that he needed to confirm with the Senate all the accusations that he made against Antony.

Octavian forcibly entered the <a href="Temple%20of%20Vesta">temple of the Vestal Virgins</a> and seized Antony's secret will, which he promptly publicized. The will would have given away Roman-conquered territories as kingdoms for his sons to rule, and designated <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> as the site for a tomb for him and his queen. In late 32 BC, the Senate officially revoked Antony's powers as consul and declared war on Cleopatra's regime in Egypt.
In early 31 BC, Antony and Cleopatra were temporarily stationed in Greece when Octavian gained a preliminary victory: the navy successfully ferried troops across the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> under the command of Agrippa. Agrippa cut off Antony and Cleopatra's main force from their supply routes at sea, while Octavian landed on the mainland opposite the island of Corcyra (modern <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a>) and marched south. Trapped on land and sea, deserters of Antony's army fled to Octavian's side daily while Octavian's forces were comfortable enough to make preparations.

Antony's fleet sailed through the bay of <a href="Actium">Actium</a> on the western coast of Greece in a desperate attempt to break free of the <a href="Blockade">naval blockade</a>. It was there that Antony's fleet faced the much larger fleet of smaller, more maneuverable ships under commanders Agrippa and <a href="Gaius%20Sosius">Gaius Sosius</a> in the battle of Actium on 2 September 31 BC. Antony and his remaining forces were spared only due to a last-ditch effort by Cleopatra's fleet that had been waiting nearby.

Octavian pursued them and defeated their forces in Alexandria on 1 August 30 BC—after which Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide. Antony fell on his own sword and was taken by his soldiers back to Alexandria where he died in Cleopatra's arms. Cleopatra died soon after, reputedly by the venomous bite of an <a href="asp%20%28reptile%29">asp</a> or by poison. Octavian had exploited his position as Caesar's heir to further his own political career, and he was well aware of the dangers in allowing another person to do so the same. He, therefore, followed the advice of <a href="Arius%20Didymus">Arius Didymus</a> that "two Caesars are one too many", ordering Caesarion to be killed (Julius Caesar's son by Cleopatra), while sparing Cleopatra's children by Antony, with the exception of Antony's <a href="Marcus%20Antonius%20Antyllus">older son</a>.

Octavian had previously shown little mercy to surrendered enemies and acted in ways that had proven unpopular with the Roman people, yet he was given credit for pardoning many of his opponents after the Battle of Actium.

After Actium and the defeat of Antony and Cleopatra, Octavian was in a position to rule the entire Republic under an unofficial <a href="principate">principate</a>—but he had to achieve this through incremental power gains. He did so by courting the Senate and the people while upholding the republican traditions of Rome, appearing that he was not aspiring to dictatorship or monarchy. Marching into Rome, Octavian and <a href="Marcus%20Vipsanius%20Agrippa">Marcus Agrippa</a> were elected as dual <a href="Roman%20consul">consuls</a> by the Senate.

Years of civil war had left Rome in a state of near lawlessness, but the Republic was not prepared to accept the control of Octavian as a despot. At the same time, Octavian could not simply give up his authority without risking further civil wars among the Roman generals and, even if he desired no position of authority whatsoever, his position demanded that he look to the well-being of the city of Rome and the <a href="Roman%20province">Roman province</a>s. Octavian's aims from this point forward were to return Rome to a state of stability, traditional legality, and civility by lifting the overt political pressure imposed on the courts of law and ensuring free elections—in name at least.

In 27 BC, Octavian made a show of returning full power to the Roman Senate and relinquishing his control of the Roman provinces and their armies. Under his consulship, however, the Senate had little power in initiating legislation by introducing <a href="Bill%20%28proposed%20law%29">bills</a> for senatorial debate. Octavian was no longer in direct control of the provinces and their armies, but he retained the loyalty of active duty soldiers and veterans alike. The careers of many clients and adherents depended on his patronage, as his financial power was unrivaled in the Roman Republic. Historian <a href="Werner%20Eck">Werner Eck</a> states:

To a large extent, the public were aware of the vast financial resources that Augustus commanded. He failed to encourage enough senators to finance the building and maintenance of networks of roads in Italy in 20 BC, but he undertook direct responsibility for them. This was publicized on the Roman currency issued in 16 BC, after he donated vast amounts of money to the "<a href="aerarium%20Saturni">aerarium Saturni</a>", the public treasury.

According to H. H. Scullard, however, Augustus's power was based on the exercise of "a predominant military power and ... the ultimate sanction of his authority was force, however much the fact was disguised."

The Senate proposed to Octavian, the victor of Rome's civil wars, that he once again assume command of the provinces. The Senate's proposal was a ratification of Octavian's extra-constitutional power. Through the Senate, Octavian was able to continue the appearance of a still-functional <a href="constitution%20of%20the%20Roman%20Republic">constitution</a>. Feigning reluctance, he accepted a ten-year responsibility of overseeing provinces that were considered chaotic.

The provinces ceded to him for that ten-year period comprised much of the conquered Roman world, including all of Hispania and Gaul, <a href="Syria%20%28Roman%20province%29">Syria</a>, <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>, <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>, and <a href="%C3%86gyptus">Egypt</a>. Moreover, command of these provinces provided Octavian with control over the majority of Rome's legions.

While Octavian acted as consul in Rome, he dispatched senators to the provinces under his command as his representatives to manage provincial affairs and ensure that his orders were carried out. The provinces not under Octavian's control were overseen by governors chosen by the Roman Senate. Octavian became the most powerful political figure in the city of Rome and in most of its provinces, but he did not have sole monopoly on political and martial power.

The Senate still controlled North Africa, an important regional <a href="Roman%20agriculture">producer of grain</a>, as well as <a href="Illyria">Illyria</a> and Macedonia, two martially strategic regions with several legions. However, the Senate had control of only five or six legions distributed among three senatorial proconsuls, compared to the twenty legions under the control of Augustus, and their control of these regions did not amount to any political or military challenge to Octavian.

The Senate's control over some of the Roman provinces helped maintain a republican façade for the autocratic Principate. Also, Octavian's control of entire provinces followed Republican-era precedents for the objective of securing peace and creating stability, in which such prominent Romans as Pompey had been granted similar military powers in times of crisis and instability.
On 16 January 27 BC the Senate gave Octavian the new titles of "<a href="Augustus%20%28honorific%29">Augustus</a>" and "<a href="Princeps">Princeps</a>". "Augustus" is from the Latin word "Augere" (meaning to increase) and can be translated as "the illustrious one". It was a title of religious authority rather than political authority. According to Roman religious beliefs, the title symbolized a stamp of authority over humanity—and in fact nature—that went beyond any constitutional definition of his status. After the harsh methods employed in consolidating his control, the change in name served to demarcate his benign reign as Augustus from his reign of terror as Octavian.

His new title of Augustus was also more favorable than "Romulus", the previous one which he styled for himself in reference to the story of <a href="Romulus">the legendary founder of Rome</a>, which symbolized a second founding of Rome. The title of "Romulus" was associated too strongly with notions of monarchy and kingship, an image that Octavian tried to avoid. "Princeps" comes from the Latin phrase "primum caput", "the first head", originally meaning the oldest or most distinguished senator whose name would appear first on the senatorial <a href="Schedule%20%28workplace%29">roster</a>. In the case of Augustus, however, it became an almost regnal title for a leader who was first in charge. "Princeps" had also been a title under the Republic for those who had served the state well; for example, Pompey had held the title.

Augustus also styled himself as "Imperator Caesar divi filius", "Commander Caesar son of the deified one". With this title, he boasted his familial link to deified Julius Caesar, and the use of "<a href="Imperator">Imperator</a>" signified a permanent link to the Roman tradition of victory. The word "Caesar" was merely a cognomen for one branch of the <a href="Julius">Julian family</a>, yet Augustus transformed "Caesar" into a new family line that began with him.

Augustus was granted the right to hang the "<a href="corona%20civica">corona civica</a>" above his door, the "civic crown" made from oak, and to have laurels drape his doorposts. This crown was usually held above the head of a Roman general during a <a href="Roman%20triumph">triumph</a>, with the individual holding the crown charged to continually repeat to the general ""<a href="memento%20mori">memento mori</a>"", or "Remember that you are mortal". Additionally, laurel wreaths were important in several state ceremonies, and crowns of laurel were rewarded to champions of athletic, racing, and dramatic contests. Thus, both the laurel and the oak were integral symbols of Roman religion and statecraft; placing them on Augustus' doorposts was tantamount to declaring his home the capital.

However, Augustus renounced flaunting insignia of power such as holding a <a href="scepter">scepter</a>, wearing a <a href="diadem%20%28personal%20wear%29">diadem</a>, or wearing the golden crown and purple <a href="toga">toga</a> of his predecessor Julius Caesar. If he refused to symbolize his power by donning and bearing these items on his person, the Senate nonetheless awarded him with a golden shield displayed in the meeting hall of the <a href="Curia">Curia</a>, bearing the inscription "virtus", "pietas", "clementia", "iustitia"—"valor, piety, clemency, and justice."

By 23 BC, some of the un-Republican implications were becoming apparent concerning the settlement of 27 BC. Augustus' retention of an annual consulate drew attention to his "de facto" dominance over the Roman political system, and cut in half the opportunities for others to achieve what was still nominally the preeminent position in the Roman state. Further, he was causing political problems by desiring to have his nephew <a href="Marcus%20Claudius%20Marcellus%20%28Julio-Claudian%20dynasty%29">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a> follow in his footsteps and eventually assume the Principate in his turn, alienating his three greatest supporters – Agrippa, <a href="Maecenas">Maecenas</a>, and Livia. Feeling pressure from his core group of adherents, Augustus turned to the Senate for help.

He appointed noted Republican <a href="Gnaeus%20Calpurnius%20Piso%20%28consul%2023%20BC%29">Calpurnius Piso</a> as co-consul in 23 BC, after his choice <a href="Aulus%20Terentius%20Varro%20Murena">Aulus Terentius Varro Murena</a> (who had fought against Julius Caesar and supported Cassius and Brutus) was executed in consequence of his involvement in the Marcus Primus affair, with an eye to bolstering his support among the Republicans.

In the late spring Augustus suffered a severe illness, and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure the continuation of the Principate in some form, while allaying senators' suspicions of his anti-republicanism. Augustus prepared to hand down his <a href="Seal%20%28device%29%23Signet%20rings">signet ring</a> to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus' supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed. This was a surprise to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.

Augustus bestowed only properties and possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy. With regards to the Principate, it was obvious to Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position; nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they should continue to obey Agrippa.
Soon after his bout of illness subsided, Augustus gave up his consulship. The only other times Augustus would serve as consul would be in the years 5 and 2 BC, both times to introduce his grandsons into public life. This was a clever ploy by Augustus; ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to attain the consular position, while allowing Augustus to exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class. Although Augustus had resigned as consul, he desired to retain his consular "<a href="imperium">imperium</a>" not just in his provinces but throughout the empire. This desire, as well as the Marcus Primus Affair, led to a second compromise between him and the Senate known as the Second Settlement.

The primary reasons for the Second Settlement were as follows. First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, he was no longer in an official position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a>. When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary. When he relinquished his annual consulship, he legally lost this power because his proconsular powers applied only to his imperial provinces. Augustus wanted to keep this power.

A second problem later arose showing the need for the Second Settlement in what became known as the "Marcus Primus Affair". In late 24 or early 23 BC, charges were brought against Marcus Primus, the former proconsul (governor) of Macedonia, for waging a war without prior approval of the Senate on the <a href="Odrysian">Odrysian</a> kingdom of <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, whose king was a Roman ally. He was defended by <a href="Lucius%20Lucinius%20Varro%20Murena">Lucius Lucinius Varro Murena</a>, who told the trial that his client had received specific instructions from Augustus, ordering him to attack the client state. Later, Primus testified that the orders came from the recently deceased Marcellus. Such orders, had they been given, would have been considered a breach of the Senate's prerogative under the Constitutional settlement of 27 BC and its aftermath—i.e., before Augustus was granted "imperium proconsulare maius"—as Macedonia was a Senatorial province under the Senate's jurisdiction, not an imperial province under the authority of Augustus. Such an action would have ripped away the veneer of Republican restoration as promoted by Augustus, and exposed his fraud of merely being the first citizen, a first among equals. Even worse, the involvement of Marcellus provided some measure of proof that Augustus's policy was to have the youth take his place as Princeps, instituting a form of monarchy – accusations that had already played out.
The situation was so serious that Augustus himself appeared at the trial, even though he had not been called as a witness. Under oath, Augustus declared that he gave no such order. Murena disbelieved Augustus's testimony and resented his attempt to subvert the trial by using his "<a href="auctoritas">auctoritas</a>". He rudely demanded to know why Augustus had turned up to a trial to which he had not been called; Augustus replied that he came in the public interest. Although Primus was found guilty, some jurors voted to acquit, meaning that not everybody believed Augustus's testimony, an insult to the 'August One'.

The Second Constitutional Settlement was completed in part to allay confusion and formalize Augustus' legal authority to intervene in Senatorial provinces. The Senate granted Augustus a form of general "imperium proconsulare", or proconsular imperium (power) that applied throughout the empire, not solely to his provinces. Moreover, the Senate augmented Augustus' proconsular imperium into "imperium proconsulare maius", or proconsular imperium applicable throughout the empire that was more (maius) or greater than that held by the other proconsuls. This in effect gave Augustus constitutional power superior to all other proconsuls in the empire. Augustus stayed in Rome during the renewal process and provided veterans with lavish donations to gain their support, thereby ensuring that his status of proconsular imperium maius was renewed in 13 BC.

During the second settlement, Augustus was also granted the power of a <a href="tribune%20of%20the%20plebs">tribune</a> ("tribunicia potestas") for life, though not the official title of tribune. For some years, Augustus had been awarded "tribunicia sacrosanctitas", the immunity given to a <a href="tribune%20of%20the%20plebs">Tribune of the Plebeians</a>. Now he decided to assume the full powers of the magistracy, renewed annually, in perpetuity. Legally, it was closed to <a href="Patrician%20%28Ancient%20Rome%29">patricians</a>, a status that Augustus had acquired some years earlier when adopted by Julius Caesar. This power allowed him to convene the Senate and people at will and lay business before them, to veto the actions of either the Assembly or the Senate, to preside over elections, and to speak first at any meeting. Also included in Augustus' tribunician authority were powers usually reserved for the <a href="Roman%20censor">Roman censor</a>; these included the right to supervise public morals and scrutinize laws to ensure that they were in the public interest, as well as the ability to hold a <a href="census">census</a> and determine the membership of the Senate.

With the powers of a censor, Augustus appealed to virtues of Roman patriotism by banning all attire but the classic toga while entering the Forum. There was no precedent within the Roman system for combining the powers of the tribune and the censor into a single position, nor was Augustus ever elected to the office of censor. Julius Caesar had been granted similar powers, wherein he was charged with supervising the morals of the state. However, this position did not extend to the censor's ability to hold a census and determine the Senate's roster. The office of the "tribunus plebis" began to lose its prestige due to Augustus' amassing of tribunal powers, so he revived its importance by making it a mandatory appointment for any plebeian desiring the <a href="praetor">praetor</a>ship.
Augustus was granted sole "imperium" within the city of Rome itself, in addition to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular "imperium" when they crossed the Pomerium – the sacred boundary of Rome – and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that, when he was in the city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or "auctoritas", his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.

In addition, the credit was given to Augustus for each subsequent Roman military victory after this time, because the majority of Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the <a href="legatus">legatus</a> who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces. Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus' proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (or credit for) any major military victory. This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph, a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general. <a href="Lucius%20Cornelius%20Balbus%20the%20Younger">Lucius Cornelius Balbus</a> was the last man outside Augustus' family to receive this award, in 19 BC. (Balbus was the nephew of Julius Caesar's great agent, who was governor of Africa and conqueror of the <a href="Garamantes">Garamantes</a>.) Tiberius, Augustus' eldest son by marriage to Livia, was the only other general to receive a triumph—for victories in Germania in 7 BC.

Many of the political subtleties of the Second Settlement seem to have evaded the comprehension of the Plebeian class, who were Augustus' greatest supporters and clientele. This caused them to insist upon Augustus' participation in imperial affairs from time to time. Augustus failed to stand for election as consul in 22 BC, and fears arose once again that he was being forced from power by the aristocratic Senate. In 22, 21, and 19 BC, the people rioted in response, and only allowed a single consul to be elected for each of those years, ostensibly to leave the other position open for Augustus. Likewise, there was a food shortage in Rome in 22 BC which sparked panic, while many urban plebs called for Augustus to take on dictatorial powers to personally oversee the crisis. After a theatrical display of refusal before the Senate, Augustus finally accepted authority over Rome's grain supply "by virtue of his proconsular "imperium"", and ended the crisis almost immediately. It was not until AD 8 that a food crisis of this sort prompted Augustus to establish a "praefectus annonae", a permanent prefect who was in charge of procuring food supplies for Rome.
Nevertheless, there were some who were concerned by the expansion of powers granted to Augustus by the Second Settlement, and this came to a head with the apparent conspiracy of Fannius Caepio. Some time prior to 1 September 22 BC, a certain Castricius provided Augustus with information about a conspiracy led by Fannius Caepio. <a href="Lucius%20Lucinius%20Varro%20Murena">Murena</a> was named among the conspirators, the outspoken Consul who defended Primus in the Marcus Primus Affair. The conspirators were tried in absentia with Tiberius acting as prosecutor; the jury found them guilty, but it was not a unanimous verdict. All the accused were sentenced to death for treason and executed as soon as they were captured—without ever giving testimony in their defence. Augustus ensured that the facade of Republican government continued with an effective cover-up of the events.

In 19 BC, the Senate granted Augustus a form of 'general consular imperium', which was probably 'imperium consulare maius', like the proconsular powers that he received in 23 BC. Like his tribune authority, the consular powers were another instance of gaining power from offices that he did not actually hold. In addition, Augustus was allowed to wear the consul's insignia in public and before the Senate, as well as to sit in the symbolic chair between the two consuls and hold the <a href="fasces">fasces</a>, an emblem of consular authority. This seems to have assuaged the populace; regardless of whether or not Augustus was a consul, the importance was that he both appeared as one before the people and could exercise consular power if necessary. On 6 March 12 BC, after the death of <a href="Marcus%20Aemilius%20Lepidus%20%28triumvir%29">Lepidus</a>, he additionally took up the position of pontifex maximus, the high priest of the college of the Pontiffs, the most important position in Roman religion. On 5 February 2 BC, Augustus was also given the title "<a href="pater%20patriae">pater patriae</a>", or "father of the country".

A final reason for the Second Settlement was to give the Principate constitutional stability and staying power in case something happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread of the life of one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life. If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid in the minds of many citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon <a href="Marcus%20Vipsanius%20Agrippa">Agrippa</a> for five years, similar to Augustus' power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.

Augustus' powers were now complete. In fact, he dated his 'reign' from the completion of the Second Settlement, July 1, 23 BC. Almost as importantly, the Principate now had constitutional stability. Later Roman Emperors were generally limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus, though often newly appointed Emperors would decline one or more of the honorifics given to Augustus in order to display humility. Just as often, as their reign progressed, Emperors would appropriate all of the titles, regardless of whether they had been granted them by the Senate. Later Emperors took to wearing the civic crown, consular insignia, and the purple robes of a Triumphant general ("<a href="toga%20picta">toga picta</a>"), which became the imperial insignia well into the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> era.

Augustus chose "Imperator" ("victorious commander") to be his first name, since he wanted to make an emphatically clear connection between himself and the notion of victory, and consequently became known as "Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus" By the year 13, Augustus boasted 21 occasions where his troops proclaimed "imperator" as his title after a successful battle. Almost the entire fourth chapter in his publicly released memoirs of achievements known as the "Res Gestae" was devoted to his military victories and honors.

Augustus also promoted the ideal of a superior Roman civilization with a task of ruling the world (to the extent to which the Romans knew it), a sentiment embodied in words that the contemporary poet <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a> attributes to a legendary ancestor of Augustus: "tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento"—"Roman, remember by your strength to rule the Earth's peoples!" The impulse for <a href="expansionism">expansionism</a> was apparently prominent among all classes at Rome, and it is accorded divine sanction by Virgil's Jupiter in Book 1 of the "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>", where Jupiter promises Rome "imperium sine fine", "sovereignty without end".

By the end of his reign, the armies of Augustus had conquered northern Hispania (modern <a href="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>) and the <a href="Alps">Alpine</a> regions of <a href="Raetia">Raetia</a> and <a href="Noricum">Noricum</a> (modern Switzerland, Bavaria, Austria, Slovenia), <a href="Illyricum%20%28Roman%20province%29">Illyricum</a> and <a href="Pannonia">Pannonia</a> (modern Albania, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, etc.), and had extended the borders of the <a href="Africa%20Province">Africa Province</a> to the east and south.
<a href="Iudaea%20Province">Judea</a> was added to the <a href="Syria%20%28Roman%20province%29">province of Syria</a> when Augustus deposed <a href="Herod%20Archelaus">Herod Archelaus</a>, successor to <a href="client%20state">client king</a> <a href="Herod%20the%20Great">Herod the Great</a> (73–4 BC). Syria (like Egypt after Antony) was governed by a high prefect of the equestrian class rather than by a proconsul or legate of Augustus.

Again, no military effort was needed in 25 BC when <a href="Galatia">Galatia</a> (modern Turkey) was converted to a Roman province shortly after <a href="Amyntas%20of%20Galatia">Amyntas of Galatia</a> was killed by an avenging widow of a slain prince from Homonada. The rebellious tribes of <a href="Asturias">Asturias</a> and <a href="Cantabria">Cantabria</a> in modern-day Spain were <a href="Cantabrian%20Wars">finally quelled in 19 BC</a>, and the territory fell under the provinces of Hispania and <a href="Lusitania">Lusitania</a>. This region proved to be a major asset in funding Augustus' future military campaigns, as it was rich in mineral deposits that could be fostered in Roman <a href="mining">mining</a> projects, especially the very rich <a href="gold">gold</a> deposits at <a href="Las%20Medulas">Las Medulas</a>.

Conquering the peoples of the Alps in 16 BC was another important victory for Rome, since it provided a large territorial buffer between the Roman citizens of Italy and Rome's enemies in Germania to the north. <a href="Horace">Horace</a> dedicated an ode to the victory, while the monument <a href="Trophy%20of%20Augustus">Trophy of Augustus</a> near <a href="Monaco">Monaco</a> was built to honor the occasion. The capture of the Alpine region also served the next offensive in 12 BC, when Tiberius began the offensive against the Pannonian tribes of Illyricum, and his brother <a href="Nero%20Claudius%20Drusus">Nero Claudius Drusus</a> moved against the Germanic tribes of the eastern <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a>. Both campaigns were successful, as Drusus' forces reached the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> River by 9 BC—though he died shortly after by falling off his horse. It was recorded that the pious Tiberius walked in front of his brother's body all the way back to Rome.

To protect Rome's eastern territories from the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian Empire</a>, Augustus relied on the <a href="client%20state">client state</a>s of the east to act as territorial <a href="Buffer%20state">buffers</a> and areas that could raise their own troops for defense. To ensure security of the Empire's eastern flank, Augustus stationed a Roman army in Syria, while his skilled stepson Tiberius negotiated with the Parthians as Rome's diplomat to the East. Tiberius was responsible for restoring <a href="Tigranes%20V%20of%20Armenia">Tigranes V</a> to the throne of the Kingdom of Armenia.
Yet arguably his greatest diplomatic achievement was negotiating with <a href="Phraates%20IV%20of%20Parthia">Phraates IV of Parthia</a> (37–2 BC) in 20 BC for the return of the <a href="Vexilloid">battle standards</a> lost by <a href="Crassus">Crassus</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Carrhae">Battle of Carrhae</a>, a symbolic victory and great boost of morale for Rome. Werner Eck claims that this was a great disappointment for Romans seeking to avenge Crassus' defeat by military means. However, Maria Brosius explains that Augustus used the return of the standards as <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> symbolizing the submission of Parthia to Rome. The event was celebrated in art such as the breastplate design on the statue <a href="Augustus%20of%20Prima%20Porta">Augustus of Prima Porta</a> and in monuments such as the <a href="Forum%20of%20Augustus">Temple of Mars Ultor</a> ('<a href="Mars%20%28mythology%29">Mars the Avenger</a>') built to house the standards.

Parthia had always posed a threat to Rome in the east, but the real battlefront was along the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> and <a href="Danube">Danube</a> rivers. Before the final fight with Antony, Octavian's campaigns against the tribes in <a href="Dalmatia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Dalmatia</a> were the first step in expanding Roman dominions to the Danube. Victory in battle was not always a permanent success, as newly conquered territories were constantly retaken by Rome's enemies in Germania.

A prime example of Roman loss in battle was the <a href="Battle%20of%20Teutoburg%20Forest">Battle of Teutoburg Forest</a> in AD 9, where three entire legions led by <a href="Publius%20Quinctilius%20Varus">Publius Quinctilius Varus</a> were destroyed by <a href="Arminius">Arminius</a>, leader of the <a href="Cherusci">Cherusci</a>, an apparent Roman ally. Augustus retaliated by dispatching Tiberius and Drusus to the Rhineland to pacify it, which had some success although the battle of AD 9 brought the end to Roman expansion into Germany. Roman general <a href="Germanicus">Germanicus</a> took advantage of a Cherusci civil war between Arminius and <a href="Segestes">Segestes</a>; they defeated Arminius, who fled that battle but was killed later in 21 due to treachery.

The illness of Augustus in 23 BC brought the problem of succession to the forefront of political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed Augustus' unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.

Some Augustan historians argue that indications pointed toward his sister's son <a href="Marcus%20Claudius%20Marcellus%20%28Julio-Claudian%20dynasty%29">Marcellus</a>, who had been quickly married to Augustus' daughter <a href="Julia%20the%20Elder">Julia the Elder</a>. Other historians dispute this due to Augustus' will read aloud to the Senate while he was seriously ill in 23 BC, instead indicating a preference for Marcus Agrippa, who was Augustus' second in charge and arguably the only one of his associates who could have controlled the legions and held the Empire together.

After the death of Marcellus in 23 BC, Augustus married his daughter to Agrippa. This union produced five children, three sons and two daughters: <a href="Gaius%20Caesar">Gaius Caesar</a>, <a href="Lucius%20Caesar">Lucius Caesar</a>, <a href="Vipsania%20Julia">Vipsania Julia</a>, <a href="Agrippina%20the%20Elder">Agrippina the Elder</a>, and <a href="Agrippa%20Postumus">Postumus Agrippa</a>, so named because he was born after Marcus Agrippa died. Shortly after the Second Settlement, Agrippa was granted a five-year term of administering the eastern half of the Empire with the "imperium" of a proconsul and the same "tribunicia potestas" granted to Augustus (although not trumping Augustus' authority), his seat of governance stationed at <a href="Samos">Samos</a> in the eastern <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a>. This granting of power showed Augustus' favor for Agrippa, but it was also a measure to please members of his Caesarian party by allowing one of their members to share a considerable amount of power with him.
Augustus' intent became apparent to make Gaius and Lucius Caesar his heirs when he adopted them as his own children. He took the consulship in 5 and 2 BC so that he could personally usher them into their political careers, and they were nominated for the consulships of AD 1 and 4. Augustus also showed favor to his stepsons, Livia's children from her first marriage <a href="Nero%20Claudius%20Drusus%20Germanicus">Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus</a> (henceforth referred to as Drusus) and <a href="Tiberius">Tiberius Claudius</a> (henceforth Tiberius), granting them military commands and public office, though seeming to favor Drusus. After Agrippa died in 12 BC, Tiberius was ordered to divorce his own wife <a href="Vipsania%20Agrippina">Vipsania Agrippina</a> and marry Agrippa's widow, Augustus' daughter Julia—as soon as a period of mourning for Agrippa had ended. Drusus' marriage to <a href="Antonia%20Minor">Antonia Minor</a> was considered an unbreakable affair, whereas Vipsania was "only" the daughter of the late Agrippa from his first marriage.

Tiberius shared in Augustus' tribune powers as of 6 BC, but shortly thereafter went into retirement, reportedly wanting no further role in politics while he exiled himself to <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>. No specific reason is known for his departure, though it could have been a combination of reasons, including a failing marriage with Julia, as well as a sense of envy and exclusion over Augustus' apparent favouring of his young grandchildren-turned-sons Gaius and Lucius. (Gaius and Lucius joined the college of priests at an early age, were presented to spectators in a more favorable light, and were introduced to the army in Gaul.)

After the early deaths of both Lucius and Gaius in AD 2 and 4 respectively, and the earlier death of his brother Drusus (9 BC), Tiberius was recalled to Rome in June AD 4, where he was adopted by Augustus on the condition that he, in turn, adopt his nephew <a href="Germanicus">Germanicus</a>. This continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of heirs. In that year, Tiberius was also granted the powers of a tribune and proconsul, emissaries from foreign kings had to pay their respects to him, and by AD 13 was awarded with his second triumph and equal level of "imperium" with that of Augustus.
The only other possible claimant as heir was Postumus Agrippa, who had been exiled by Augustus in AD 7, his banishment made permanent by senatorial decree, and Augustus officially disowned him. He certainly fell out of Augustus' favor as an heir; the historian Erich S. Gruen notes various contemporary sources that state Postumus Agrippa was a "vulgar young man, brutal and brutish, and of depraved character". Postumus Agrippa was murdered at his place of exile either shortly before or after the death of Augustus.

On 19 August AD 14, Augustus died while visiting <a href="Nola">Nola</a> where his father had died. Both Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that Livia was rumored to have brought about Augustus' death by poisoning fresh figs. This element features in many modern works of historical fiction pertaining to Augustus' life, but some historians view it as likely to have been a salacious fabrication made by those who had favoured Postumus as heir, or other of Tiberius' political enemies. Livia had long been the target of similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son, most or all of which are unlikely to have been true.

Alternatively, it is possible that Livia did supply a poisoned fig (she did cultivate a variety of fig named for her that Augustus is said to have enjoyed), but did so as a means of assisted suicide rather than murder. Augustus' health had been in decline in the months immediately before his death, and he had made significant preparations for a smooth transition in power, having at last reluctantly settled on Tiberius as his choice of heir. It is likely that Augustus was not expected to return alive from Nola, but it seems that his health improved once there; it has therefore been speculated that Augustus and Livia conspired to end his life at the anticipated time, having committed all political process to accepting Tiberius, in order to not endanger that transition.

Augustus' famous last words were, "Have I played the part well? Then applaud as I exit"—referring to the play-acting and regal authority that he had put on as emperor. Publicly, though, his last words were, "Behold, I found Rome of clay, and leave her to you of marble." An enormous funerary procession of mourners traveled with Augustus' body from Nola to Rome, and on the day of his burial all public and private businesses closed for the day. Tiberius and his son Drusus delivered the eulogy while standing atop two "<a href="rostra">rostra</a>". Augustus' body was coffin-bound and cremated on a pyre close to <a href="Mausoleum%20of%20Augustus">his mausoleum</a>. It was proclaimed that Augustus joined the company of the gods as a member of the Roman <a href="pantheon%20%28gods%29">pantheon</a>. The mausoleum was despoiled by the Goths in 410 during the <a href="Sack%20of%20Rome%20%28410%29">Sack of Rome</a>, and his ashes were scattered.

Historian D. C. A. Shotter states that Augustus' policy of favoring the Julian family line over the Claudian might have afforded Tiberius sufficient cause to show open disdain for Augustus after the latter's death; instead, Tiberius was always quick to rebuke those who criticized Augustus. Shotter suggests that Augustus' deification obliged Tiberius to suppress any open resentment that he might have harbored, coupled with Tiberius' "extremely conservative" attitude towards religion.

Also, historian R. Shaw-Smith points to letters of Augustus to Tiberius which display affection towards Tiberius and high regard for his military merits. Shotter states that Tiberius focused his anger and criticism on <a href="Gaius%20Asinius%20Gallus">Gaius Asinius Gallus</a> (for marrying Vipsania after Augustus forced Tiberius to divorce her), as well as toward the two young Caesars, Gaius and Lucius—instead of Augustus, the real architect of his divorce and imperial demotion.

Augustus' reign laid the foundations of a regime that lasted, in one form or another, for nearly fifteen hundred years through the ultimate <a href="decline%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire">decline of the Western Roman Empire</a> and until the <a href="Fall%20of%20Constantinople">Fall of Constantinople</a> in 1453. Both his adoptive surname, Caesar, and his title "Augustus" became the permanent titles of the rulers of the Roman Empire for fourteen centuries after his death, in use both at <a href="Rome">Old Rome</a> and at <a href="Constantinople">New Rome</a>. In many languages, "Caesar" became the word for "Emperor", as in the German "<a href="Kaiser">Kaiser</a>" and in the Bulgarian and subsequently Russian "<a href="Tsar">Tsar</a>". The cult of "Divus Augustus" continued until the state religion of the Empire was changed to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> in 391 by <a href="Theodosius%20I">Theodosius I</a>. Consequently, there are many excellent statues and busts of the first emperor. He had composed an account of his achievements, the "<a href="Res%20Gestae%20Divi%20Augusti">Res Gestae Divi Augusti</a>", to be inscribed in bronze in front of <a href="Mausoleum%20of%20Augustus">his mausoleum</a>. Copies of the text were inscribed throughout the Empire upon his death. The inscriptions in Latin featured translations in Greek beside it, and were inscribed on many public edifices, such as the temple in <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a> dubbed the "Monumentum Ancyranum", called the "queen of inscriptions" by historian <a href="Theodor%20Mommsen">Theodor Mommsen</a>.

There are a few known written works by Augustus that have survived such as his poems "Sicily", "Epiphanus", and "Ajax", an autobiography of 13 books, a philosophical treatise, and his written rebuttal to Brutus' "Eulogy of Cato". Historians are able to analyze existing letters penned by Augustus to others for additional facts or clues about his personal life.

Many consider Augustus to be Rome's greatest emperor; his policies certainly extended the Empire's life span and initiated the celebrated "Pax Romana" or "Pax Augusta". The Roman Senate wished subsequent emperors to "<a href="Felicior%20Augusto%2C%20melior%20Traiano">be more fortunate than Augustus and better than Trajan</a>". Augustus was intelligent, decisive, and a shrewd politician, but he was not perhaps as charismatic as Julius Caesar, and was influenced on occasion by his third wife, Livia (sometimes for the worse). Nevertheless, his legacy proved more enduring. The city of Rome was utterly transformed under Augustus, with Rome's first institutionalized <a href="History%20of%20criminal%20justice">police force</a>, <a href="fire%20fighting">fire fighting</a> force, and the establishment of the municipal <a href="prefect">prefect</a> as a permanent office. The police force was divided into cohorts of 500 men each, while the units of firemen ranged from 500 to 1,000 men each, with 7 units assigned to 14 divided city sectors.

A "<a href="praefectus%20vigilum">praefectus vigilum</a>", or "Prefect of the Watch" was put in charge of the <a href="vigiles">vigiles</a>, Rome's fire brigade and police. With Rome's civil wars at an end, Augustus was also able to create a <a href="standing%20army">standing army</a> for the Roman Empire, fixed at a size of 28 legions of about 170,000 soldiers. This was supported by numerous <a href="auxiliaries%20%28Roman%20military%29">auxiliary</a> units of 500 soldiers each, often recruited from recently conquered areas.

With his finances securing the maintenance of roads throughout Italy, Augustus also installed an official <a href="courier">courier</a> system of relay stations overseen by a military officer known as the "praefectus vehiculorum". Besides the advent of swifter communication among Italian polities, his extensive building of roads throughout Italy also allowed Rome's armies to march swiftly and at an unprecedented pace across the country. In the year 6 Augustus established the "<a href="aerarium%20militare">aerarium militare</a>", donating 170 million sesterces to the new military treasury that provided for both active and retired soldiers.

One of the most enduring institutions of Augustus was the establishment of the Praetorian Guard in 27 BC, originally a personal bodyguard unit on the battlefield that evolved into an imperial guard as well as an important political force in Rome. They had the power to intimidate the Senate, install new emperors, and depose ones they disliked; the last emperor they served was <a href="Maxentius">Maxentius</a>, as it was <a href="Constantine%20I">Constantine I</a> who disbanded them in the early 4th century and destroyed their barracks, the <a href="Castra%20Praetoria">Castra Praetoria</a>.
Although the most powerful individual in the Roman Empire, Augustus wished to embody the spirit of Republican virtue and norms. He also wanted to relate to and connect with the concerns of the plebs and lay people. He achieved this through various means of generosity and a cutting back of lavish excess. In the year 29 BC, Augustus paid 400 sesterces each to 250,000 citizens, 1,000 sesterces each to 120,000 veterans in the colonies, and spent 700 million sesterces in purchasing land for his soldiers to settle upon. He also restored 82 different temples to display his care for the <a href="Roman%20mythology">Roman pantheon</a> of deities. In 28 BC, he melted down 80 silver statues erected in his likeness and in honor of him, an attempt of his to appear frugal and modest.

The longevity of Augustus' reign and its legacy to the Roman world should not be overlooked as a key factor in its success. As <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate. Had Augustus died earlier (in 23 BC, for instance), matters might have turned out differently. The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a <a href="de%20facto">de facto</a> monarchy in these years. Augustus' own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus' ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title. The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.

However, for his rule of Rome and establishing the principate, Augustus has also been subjected to criticism throughout the ages. The contemporary Roman jurist <a href="Marcus%20Antistius%20Labeo">Marcus Antistius Labeo</a> (d. AD 10/11), fond of the days of pre-Augustan republican <a href="liberty">liberty</a> in which he had been born, openly criticized the Augustan regime. In the beginning of his "<a href="Annals%20%28Tacitus%29">Annals</a>", the Roman historian <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> (c. 56–c.117) wrote that Augustus had cunningly subverted Republican Rome into a position of slavery. He continued to say that, with Augustus' death and swearing of loyalty to Tiberius, the people of Rome simply traded one slaveholder for another. Tacitus, however, records two contradictory but common views of Augustus:

According to the second opposing opinion:
In a recent biography on Augustus, <a href="Anthony%20Everitt">Anthony Everitt</a> asserts that through the centuries, judgments on Augustus' reign have oscillated between these two extremes but stresses that:

Tacitus was of the belief that <a href="Nerva">Nerva</a> (r. 96–98) successfully "mingled two formerly alien ideas, principate and liberty". The 3rd-century historian Cassius Dio acknowledged Augustus as a benign, moderate ruler, yet like most other historians after the death of Augustus, Dio viewed Augustus as an <a href="Autocracy">autocrat</a>. The poet <a href="Marcus%20Annaeus%20Lucanus">Marcus Annaeus Lucanus</a> (AD 39–65) was of the opinion that Caesar's victory over Pompey and the fall of <a href="Cato%20the%20Younger">Cato the Younger</a> (95 BC–46 BC) marked the end of traditional liberty in Rome; historian Chester G. Starr, Jr. writes of his avoidance of criticizing Augustus, "perhaps Augustus was too sacred a figure to accuse directly."

The <a href="Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> writer <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a> (1667–1745), in his "Discourse on the Contests and Dissentions in Athens and Rome", criticized Augustus for installing tyranny over Rome, and likened what he believed <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>'s virtuous <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> to Rome's moral Republic of the 2nd century BC. In his criticism of Augustus, the admiral and historian <a href="Thomas%20Gordon%20%28Royal%20Scots%20Navy%20officer%29">Thomas Gordon</a> (1658–1741) compared Augustus to the puritanical tyrant <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> (1599–1658). Thomas Gordon and the <a href="France">French</a> political philosopher <a href="Charles%20de%20Secondat%2C%20baron%20de%20Montesquieu">Montesquieu</a> (1689–1755) both remarked that Augustus was a coward in battle. In his "Memoirs of the Court of Augustus", the <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a> scholar <a href="Thomas%20Blackwell%20%28scholar%29">Thomas Blackwell</a> (1701–1757) deemed Augustus a <a href="Machiavellianism">Machiavellian ruler</a>, "a bloodthirsty vindicative usurper", "wicked and worthless", "a mean spirit", and a "tyrant".

Augustus' public <a href="revenue">revenue</a> reforms had a great impact on the subsequent success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, direct taxation from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus' predecessors had done. This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.

The measures of taxation in the reign of Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province. Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces. Indirect taxes included a 4% tax on the price of slaves, a 1% tax on goods sold at auction, and a 5% tax on the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the <a href="next%20of%20kin">next of kin</a>.

An equally important reform was the abolition of private <a href="tax%20farming">tax farming</a>, which was replaced by salaried civil service tax collectors. Private contractors who collected taxes for the State were the norm in the Republican era. Some of them were powerful enough to influence the number of votes for men running for offices in Rome. Theese tax farmers called publicans were infamous for their depredations, great private wealth, and the right to tax local areas.

Rome's revenue equaled the amount of the successful bids to farm the taxes. The tax farmers' profits consisted of additional amounts they could forcibly wring from the populace with Rome's blessing or turning a blind eye. Lack of effective supervision, combined with tax farmers' desire to maximize their profits, produced a system of arbitrary exactions regarded quite rightly as barbarously cruel to taxpayers, unfair, and very harmful to investment and the economy.
The use of Egypt's immense land rents to finance the Empire's operations resulted from Augustus' conquest of Egypt and the shift to a Roman form of government. As it was effectively considered Augustus' private property rather than a province of the Empire, it became part of each succeeding emperor's patrimonium. Instead of a legate or proconsul, Augustus installed a prefect from the equestrian class to administer Egypt and maintain its lucrative seaports; this position became the highest political achievement for any equestrian besides becoming <a href="Praetorian%20prefect">Prefect of the Praetorian Guard</a>. The highly productive agricultural land of Egypt yielded enormous revenues that were available to Augustus and his successors to pay for public works and military expeditions, as well as <a href="bread%20and%20circuses">bread and circuses</a> for the population of Rome.

During his reign the <a href="Venatio">circus games</a> resulted in the killing of 3,500 <a href="North%20African%20elephant">elephants</a>.

The month of August (Latin: "Augustus") is named after Augustus; until his time it was called <a href="Sextilis">Sextilis</a> (named so because it had been the sixth month of the original <a href="Roman%20calendar">Roman calendar</a> and the Latin word for six is "sex"). Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Julius Caesar's July, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar <a href="Johannes%20de%20Sacrobosco">Johannes de Sacrobosco</a>. Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length (see <a href="Julian%20calendar">Julian calendar</a>). According to a "senatus consultum" quoted by <a href="Macrobius%20Ambrosius%20Theodosius">Macrobius</a>, Sextilis was renamed to honor Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, fell in that month.

On his deathbed, Augustus boasted "I found a Rome of bricks; I leave to you one of marble." Although there is some truth in the literal meaning of this, Cassius Dio asserts that it was a metaphor for the Empire's strength. <a href="Marble">Marble</a> could be found in buildings of Rome before Augustus, but it was not extensively used as a building material until the reign of Augustus.

Although this did not apply to the <a href="Subura">Subura</a> slums, which were still as rickety and fire-prone as ever, he did leave a mark on the monumental topography of the centre and of the <a href="Campus%20Martius">Campus Martius</a>, with the <a href="Ara%20Pacis">Ara Pacis</a> (Altar of Peace) and monumental sundial, whose central <a href="gnomon">gnomon</a> was an <a href="obelisks%20of%20Rome">obelisk</a> taken from Egypt. The <a href="relief">relief</a> sculptures decorating the Ara Pacis visually augmented the written record of Augustus' triumphs in the "Res Gestae". Its reliefs depicted the imperial pageants of the <a href="praetor">praetor</a>ians, the Vestals, and the citizenry of Rome.

He also built the <a href="Temple%20of%20Caesar">Temple of Caesar</a>, the <a href="Baths%20of%20Agrippa">Baths of Agrippa</a>, and the <a href="Forum%20of%20Augustus">Forum of Augustus</a> with its <a href="Temple%20of%20Mars%20Ultor">Temple of Mars Ultor</a>. Other projects were either encouraged by him, such as the <a href="Lucius%20Cornelius%20Balbus%20%28minor%29">Theatre of Balbus</a>, and Agrippa's construction of the <a href="Pantheon%2C%20Rome">Pantheon</a>, or funded by him in the name of others, often relations (e.g. <a href="Porticus%20Octaviae">Portico of Octavia</a>, <a href="Theatre%20of%20Marcellus">Theatre of Marcellus</a>). Even his <a href="Mausoleum%20of%20Augustus">Mausoleum of Augustus</a> was built before his death to house members of his family.

To celebrate his victory at the Battle of Actium, the <a href="Arch%20of%20Augustus%2C%20Rome">Arch of Augustus</a> was built in 29 BC near the entrance of the <a href="Temple%20of%20Castor%20and%20Pollux">Temple of Castor and Pollux</a>, and widened in 19 BC to include a triple-arch design. There are also many buildings outside of the city of Rome that bear Augustus' name and legacy, such as the <a href="M%C3%A9rida%2C%20Spain">Theatre of Mérida</a> in modern Spain, the <a href="Maison%20Carr%C3%A9e">Maison Carrée</a> built at <a href="N%C3%AEmes">Nîmes</a> in today's southern France, as well as the <a href="Trophy%20of%20Augustus">Trophy of Augustus</a> at <a href="La%20Turbie">La Turbie</a>, located near <a href="Monaco">Monaco</a>.
After the death of Agrippa in 12 BC, a solution had to be found in maintaining Rome's water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense. In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply and to ensure that Rome's aqueducts did not fall into disrepair.

In the late Augustan era, the commission of five senators called the "curatores locorum publicorum iudicandorum" (translated as "Supervisors of Public Property") was put in charge of maintaining public buildings and temples of the state cult. Augustus created the senatorial group of the "curatores viarum" (translated as "Supervisors for Roads") for the upkeep of roads; this senatorial commission worked with local officials and contractors to organize regular repairs.

The <a href="Corinthian%20order">Corinthian order</a> of architectural style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural style in the age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome. Suetonius once commented that Rome was unworthy of its status as an imperial capital, yet Augustus and Agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance of Rome upon the classical Greek model.

His biographer Suetonius, writing about a century after Augustus' death, described his appearance as: "... unusually handsome and exceedingly graceful at all periods of his life, though he cared nothing for personal adornment. He was so far from being particular about the dressing of his hair, that he would have several barbers working in a hurry at the same time, and as for his beard he now had it clipped and now shaved, while at the very same time he would either be reading or writing something ... He had clear, bright eyes ... His teeth were wide apart, small, and ill-kept; his hair was slightly curly and inclined to golden; his eyebrows met. His ears were of moderate size, and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent ever so slightly inward. His complexion was between dark and fair. He was short of stature, although Julius Marathus, his freedman and keeper of his records, says that he was five feet and nine inches (just under 5 ft. 7 in., or 1.70 meters, in modern height measurements), but this was concealed by the fine proportion and symmetry of his figure, and was noticeable only by comparison with some taller person standing beside him...", adding that "his shoes [were] somewhat high-soled, to make him look taller than he really was"

His official images were very tightly controlled and idealized, drawing from a tradition of <a href="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> royal portraiture rather than the tradition of realism in <a href="Roman%20portraiture">Roman portraiture</a>. He first appeared on <a href="Ancient%20Roman%20coinage">coins</a> at the age of 19, and from about 29 BC "the explosion in the number of Augustan portraits attests a concerted propaganda campaign aimed at dominating all aspects of civil, religious, economic and military life with Augustus' person." The early images did indeed depict a young man, but although there were gradual changes his images remained youthful until he died in his seventies, by which time they had "a distanced air of ageless majesty". Among the best known of many surviving portraits are the <a href="Augustus%20of%20Prima%20Porta">Augustus of Prima Porta</a>, the image on the Ara Pacis, and the <a href="Via%20Labicana%20Augustus">Via Labicana Augustus</a>, which shows him as a priest. Several <a href="engraved%20gem">cameo portraits</a> include the <a href="Blacas%20Cameo">Blacas Cameo</a> and "<a href="Gemma%20Augustea">Gemma Augustea</a>".

Augustus' only biological (non-adopted) child was his daughter.

Geography of Antarctica

The geography of Antarctica is dominated by its <a href="polar%20region">south polar location</a> and, thus, by <a href="ice">ice</a>. The <a href="Antarctica">Antarctic</a> <a href="continent">continent</a>, located in the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s <a href="southern%20hemisphere">southern hemisphere</a>, is centered asymmetrically around the <a href="South%20Pole">South Pole</a> and largely south of the <a href="Antarctic%20Circle">Antarctic Circle</a>. It is washed by the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern (or Antarctic) Ocean</a> or, depending on definition, the southern <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>, <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a>, and <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>s. It has an area of more than 14 million km².

Some 98% of Antarctica is covered by the <a href="Antarctic%20ice%20sheet">Antarctic ice sheet</a>, the world's largest <a href="ice%20sheet">ice sheet</a> and also its largest reservoir of <a href="fresh%20water">fresh water</a>. Averaging at least 1.6 km thick, the ice is so massive that it has <a href="post-glacial%20rebound">depressed the continental bedrock</a> in some areas more than 2.5 km below sea level; subglacial lakes of liquid water also occur (e.g., <a href="Lake%20Vostok">Lake Vostok</a>). <a href="Ice%20shelf">Ice shelves</a> and <a href="ice%20rise">rises</a> populate the ice sheet on the periphery.

Physically, Antarctica is divided in two by <a href="Transantarctic%20Mountains">Transantarctic Mountains</a> close to the neck between the <a href="Ross%20Sea">Ross Sea</a> and the <a href="Weddell%20Sea">Weddell Sea</a>. <a href="Western%20Antarctica">Western Antarctica</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Antarctica">Eastern Antarctica</a> correspond roughly to the eastern and western hemispheres relative to the <a href="Prime%20Meridian">Greenwich meridian</a>. This usage has been regarded as <a href="Eurocentrism">Eurocentric</a> by some, and the alternative terms Lesser Antarctica and Greater Antarctica (respectively) are sometimes preferred.

Lesser Antarctica is covered by the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. There has been some concern about this <a href="ice%20sheet">ice sheet</a>, because there is a small chance that it will collapse. If it does, ocean levels would rise by a few metres in a very short period of time.

There are four volcanoes on the mainland of Antarctica that are
considered to be active on the basis of observed fumarolic activity or 
"recent" tephra deposits: 
<a href="Mount%20Melbourne">Mount Melbourne</a> (2,730 m) (74°21'S., 164°42'E.), a stratovolcano; 
<a href="Mount%20Berlin">Mount Berlin</a> (3,500 m) (76°03'S., 135°52'W.), a stratovolcano; 
Mount Kauffman (2,365 m) (75°37'S., 132°25'W.), a stratovolcano; and 
<a href="Mount%20Hampton">Mount Hampton</a> (3,325 m) (76°29'S., 125°48'W.), a volcanic caldera.
Several volcanoes on offshore islands have records of historic activity.
<a href="Mount%20Erebus">Mount Erebus</a> (3,795 m), a stratovolcano on
<a href="Ross%20Island">Ross Island</a> with 10 known eruptions and 1 suspected eruption.
On the opposite side of the continent, 
<a href="Deception%20Island">Deception Island</a>
(62°57'S., 60°38'W.), a volcanic caldera with 10 known
and 4 suspected eruptions, have been the most active.
<a href="Buckle%20Island">Buckle Island</a> in the <a href="Balleny%20Islands">Balleny Islands</a> (66°50'S., 163°12'E.), 
<a href="Penguin%20Island%20%28South%20Shetland%20Islands%29">Penguin Island</a> (62°06'S., 57°54'W.), 
<a href="Paulet%20Island">Paulet Island</a> (63°35'S., 55°47'W.), and 
<a href="Lindenberg%20Island">Lindenberg Island</a> (64°55'S., 59°40'W.) are also 
considered to be active. In 2017, the researchers of <a href="Edinburgh%20University">Edinburgh University</a> discovered 91 underwater volcanoes under <a href="West%20Antarctica">West Antarctica</a>.

Transport in Antarctica

Transport in Antarctica has transformed from explorers crossing the isolated remote area of <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> by foot to a more open area due to human technologies enabling more convenient and faster transport, predominantly by air and water, as well as land. 
Transportation technologies on a remote area like Antarctica need to be able to deal with extremely low temperatures and continuous winds to ensure the travelers' safety. Due to the fragility of the Antarctic environment, only a limited amount of transport movements can take place and sustainable transportation technologies have to be used to reduce the <a href="ecological%20footprint">ecological footprint</a>.
The infrastructure of land, water and air transport needs to be safe and sustainable. 
Currently thousands of tourists and hundreds of scientists a year rely on the Antarctic transportation system.

Winds continuously blow snow on roads in Antarctica. 

The <a href="South%20Pole%20Traverse">South Pole Traverse</a> (McMurdo–South Pole highway) is approximately long and links the United States' <a href="McMurdo%20Station">McMurdo Station</a> on the coast to the <a href="Amundsen%E2%80%93Scott%20South%20Pole%20Station">Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station</a>. It was constructed by leveling snow and filling in <a href="crevasse">crevasse</a>s, but is not <a href="Road%20surface">paved</a>. There are flags to mark the route.

Also, the <a href="United%20States%20Antarctic%20Program">United States Antarctic Program</a> maintains two ice roads during the austral summer. One provides access to <a href="Pegasus%20Field">Pegasus Field</a> on the <a href="Ross%20Ice%20Shelf">Ross Ice Shelf</a>. The ice road between <a href="Pegasus%20Field">Pegasus Field</a> and <a href="McMurdo%20Station">McMurdo Station</a> is about 14 miles. The other road provides access to the <a href="Ice%20Runway">Ice Runway</a>, which is on <a href="sea%20ice">sea ice</a>. The road between the <a href="Ice%20Runway">Ice Runway</a> and <a href="McMurdo%20Station">McMurdo Station</a> varies in length from year to year depending on many factors, including ice stability. These roads are critical for resuppling <a href="McMurdo%20Station">McMurdo Station</a>, <a href="Scott%20Base">Scott Base</a>, and <a href="Amundsen%E2%80%93Scott%20South%20Pole%20Station">Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station</a>.

The scarcity and poor quality of road infrastructure limits land transportation by conventional vehicles. 

A normal car on tires has very limited capability for Antarctic conditions. Scientific bases are often built on snow free areas (oases) close to the
ocean. Around these stations and on a hard packed snow or ice, tire based vehicles can drive but on deeper and softer snow, a normal tire based vehicle cannot travel. Due to these limitation vehicles on belts have been the preferred option in Antarctica. In 1997 two specialized cars with very large tires running tire pressure as low as 1.5psi/0.1bar travelled onto the high Antarctica Plateau, giving strong indication that tire based vehicles could be an option for efficient travelling in Antarctica.

<a href="Mawson%20Station">Mawson Station</a> started using classic <a href="Volkswagen%20Beetle">Volkswagen Beetle</a>s, the first production cars to be used in Antarctica. The first of these was named "Antarctica 1".

In December 1997 into February 1998 two AT44, 4x4 cars (built in Iceland by Arctic Trucks with tire size of 44-inch tall) joined an expedition by the Swedish Polar Institution (SWEA). The cars got used to transport people and supplies from the Ice shelf to WASA station, to perform scanning of the snow and support a drilling expedition to on the Antarctica Plateau 76°S 8°03'W. This is the first time tire based vehicles successfully travel on the Antarctica high plateau.

In 2006 a team of six people took part in the <a href="Ice%20Challenger%20Expedition">Ice Challenger Expedition</a>. Travelling in a specially designed six wheel drive vehicle, the team completed the journey from the <a href="Antarctic">Antarctic</a> coast at Patriot Hills to the geographic <a href="South%20Pole">South Pole</a> in 69 hours. In doing so they easily beat the previous record of 24 days. They arrived at the South Pole on December 12, 2005.

The team members on that expedition were <a href="Andrew%20Regan">Andrew Regan</a>, <a href="Jason%20De%20Carteret">Jason De Carteret</a>, Andrew Moon, Richard Griffiths, Gunnar Egilsson and Andrew Miles. The expedition successfully showed that wheeled transport on the continent is not only possible but also often more practical. The expedition also hoped to raise awareness about global warming and climate change.

From start of December 2008 into February 2009, four AT44, 4x4 cars were used to support a ski race by Amundsen Omega 3, from S82° 41' E17° 43' to South Pole. A film was made of this race by BBC called "On Thin Ice" with Ben Fogle and James Cracknell. The cars started from Novo airbase at S70° 49' E11° 38', establish a route onto the plateau through the crevasse areas in the Shcherbakov Mountain Range driving nearly 1500 km to the start line of the ski race. For the return journey each car covered between 5400 and 5800 km with one fuel depot on the way.

From 2008 to date (Dec 2015) tire based cars, AT44 4x4 and AT44 6x6 have been used every season to support various NGO and scientific expedition/projects, supporting flights, fuel drops, filming, skiers, biker, a tractor, collecting snow samples and more. The combined distance covered on the Antarctica Plateau is over 220 thousand km and even though towing capacity is much lower than for most belt based vehicles, the tire based cars multiply the travel speed and use only a fraction of the fuel making this an option for some expeditions/projects.

A second expedition led by Andrew Regan and Andrew Moon departed in November 2010. The Moon-Regan Trans Antarctic Expedition this time traversed the entire continent twice, using two six-wheel-drive vehicles and a Concept Ice Vehicle designed by Lotus. This time the team used the expedition to raise awareness about the global environmental importance of the Antarctic region and to show that <a href="biofuel">biofuel</a> can be a viable and environmentally friendly option.

Antarctica's only harbour is at <a href="McMurdo%20Station">McMurdo Station</a>. Most coastal stations have offshore anchorages, and supplies are transferred from ship to shore by small boats, barges, and helicopters. A few stations have a basic wharf facility. All ships at port are subject to inspection in accordance with Article 7, <a href="Antarctic%20Treaty">Antarctic Treaty</a>. Offshore anchorage is sparse and intermittent, but poses no problem to sailboats designed for the ice, typically with lifting keels and long shorelines.
<a href="McMurdo%20Station">McMurdo Station</a> (), <a href="Palmer%20Station">Palmer Station</a> (); government use only except by permit (see Permit Office under "Legal System"). A number of tour boats, ranging from large motorized vessels to small sailing yachts, visit the Antarctic Peninsula during the summer months (January–March). Most are based in <a href="Ushuaia">Ushuaia</a>, Argentina.

Transport in Antarctica takes place by air, using fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters.
Runways and helicopter pads have to be kept snow free to ensure safe take off and landing conditions.

Antarctica has <a href="List%20of%20airports%20in%20Antarctica">20 airports</a>, but there are no developed public-access airports or landing facilities. Thirty stations, operated by 16 national governments party to the <a href="Antarctic%20Treaty">Antarctic Treaty</a>, have landing facilities for either helicopters and/or fixed-wing aircraft; commercial enterprises operate two additional air facilities.

Helicopter pads are available at 27 stations; runways at 15 locations are gravel, sea-ice, blue-ice, or compacted snow suitable for landing wheeled, fixed-wing aircraft; of these, one is greater than 3 km in length, six are between 2 km and 3 km in length, 3 are between 1 km and 2 km in length, three are less than 1 km in length, and two are of unknown length; snow surface skiways, limited to use by ski-equipped, fixed-wing aircraft, are available at another 15 locations; of these, four are greater than 3 km in length, three are between 2 km and 3 km in length, two are between 1 km and 2 km in length, two are less than 1 km in length, and data is unavailable for the remaining four.

Antarctic airports are subject to severe restrictions and limitations resulting from extreme seasonal and geographic conditions; they do not meet <a href="ICAO">ICAO</a> standards, and advance approval from the respective governmental or nongovernmental operating organization is required for landing (1999 est.) Flights to the continent in the permanent darkness of the winter are normally only undertaken in an emergency, with burning barrels of fuel to outline a runway. On September 11, 2008, a United States Air Force <a href="C-17%20Globemaster%20III">C-17 Globemaster III</a> successfully completed the first landing in Antarctica using <a href="night-vision%20goggles">night-vision goggles</a> at <a href="Pegasus%20Field">Pegasus Field</a>.

In April 2001 an emergency evacuation of Dr. Ronald Shemenski was needed from <a href="Amundsen%E2%80%93Scott%20South%20Pole%20Station">Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station</a> when he contracted <a href="pancreatitis">pancreatitis</a>. Three <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">C-130 Hercules</a> were called back before their final leg because of weather. Organizers then called on <a href="Kenn%20Borek%20Air">Kenn Borek Air</a> based in <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a>. Two <a href="de%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-6%20Twin%20Otter">de Havilland Twin Otters</a> were dispatched out of Calgary with one being back-up. Twin Otters are specifically designed for the Canadian north and Kenn Borek Air's motto is "Anywhere, Anytime, World-Wide". The mission was a success but not without difficulties and drawbacks. Ground crews needed to create a 2 km runway with tracked equipment not designed to operate in the low temperatures at that time of year, the aircraft controls had to be "jerry-rigged" when the flaps were frozen in position after landing, and instruments were not reliable because of the cold. When they saw a "faint pink line on the horizon" they knew they were going in the right direction. This was the first rescue from the South Pole during polar winter. Canada honoured the Otter crew for bravery.

Geography of Alabama

This article will go through a wide range of topics of the geography of the state of <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>. It is 30th in size and borders four <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a>s: Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, and Florida. It also borders the Gulf of Mexico.

Extending entirely across the state of Alabama for about northern boundary, and in the middle stretching farther south, is the <a href="Cumberland%20Plateau">Cumberland Plateau</a>, or <a href="Tennessee%20Valley">Tennessee Valley</a> region, broken into broad tablelands by the dissection of rivers. In the northern part of this plateau, west of <a href="Jackson%20County%2C%20Alabama">Jackson county</a>, there are about of level highlands from above sea level. South of these highlands, occupying a narrow strip on each side of the <a href="Tennessee%20River">Tennessee River</a>, is a country of gentle rolling lowlands varying in elevation from . To the northeast of these highlands and lowlands is a rugged section with steep mountain-sides, deep narrow coves and valleys, and flat mountain-tops. Its elevations range from . In the remainder of this region, the southern portion, the most prominent feature is "Little Mountain", extending about from east to west between two valleys, and rising precipitously on the north side above them or above the sea.

Adjoining the Cumberland Plateau region on the southeast is the <a href="Ridge-and-Valley%20Appalachians">Appalachian Valley</a> (locally known as Coosa Valley) region, which is the southern extremity of the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a>, and occupies an area within the state of about . This is a <a href="limestone">limestone</a> belt with parallel hard rock ridges left standing by erosion to form mountains. Although the general direction of the mountains, ridges, and valleys is northeast and southwest, irregularity is one of the most prominent characteristics. In the northeast are several flat-topped mountains, of which Raccoon and <a href="Lookout%20Mountain">Lookout</a> are the most prominent, having a maximum elevation near the <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> line of little more than and gradually decreasing in height toward the southwest, where <a href="Sand%20Mountain%20%28Alabama%29">Sand Mountain</a> is a continuation of Raccoon. South of these the mountains are marked by steep northwest sides, sharp crests and gently sloping southeast sides.

Southeast of the Appalachian Valley region, the <a href="Piedmont%20%28United%20States%29">Piedmont Plateau</a> also crosses the Alabama border from the N.E. and occupies a small triangular-shaped section of which <a href="Randolph%20County%2C%20Alabama">Randolph</a> and <a href="Clay%20County%2C%20Alabama">Clay</a> counties, together with the northern part of <a href="Tallapoosa%20County%2C%20Alabama">Tallapoosa</a> and <a href="Chambers%20County%2C%20Alabama">Chambers</a>, form the principal portion. Its surface is gently undulating and has an elevation of about above sea level. The Piedmont Plateau is a lowland worn down by erosion on hard crystalline rocks, then uplifted to form a plateau.

The remainder of the state is occupied by the "Coastal Plain". This is crossed by foot-hills and rolling prairies in the central part of the state, where it has a mean elevation of about , becomes lower and more level toward the southwest, and in the extreme south is flat and but slightly elevated above the sea.
The Cumberland Plateau region is drained to the west-northwest by the <a href="Tennessee%20River">Tennessee River</a> and its tributaries; all other parts of the state are drained to the southwest. In the Appalachian Valley region the <a href="Coosa%20River">Coosa River</a> is the principal river; and in the Piedmont Plateau, the <a href="Tallapoosa%20River">Tallapoosa River</a>. In the Coastal Plain are the <a href="Tombigbee%20River">Tombigbee River</a> in the west, the <a href="Alabama%20River">Alabama River</a> (formed by the Coosa and Tallapoosa) in the western central, and in the east the <a href="Chattahoochee%20River">Chattahoochee River</a>, which forms almost half of the Georgia boundary. The Tombigbee and Alabama rivers unite near the southwest corner of the state, their waters discharging into <a href="Mobile%20Bay">Mobile Bay</a> by the <a href="Mobile%20River">Mobile</a> and Tensas rivers. The <a href="Black%20Warrior%20River">Black Warrior River</a> is a considerable stream which joins the Tombigbee from the east.

The valleys in the north and northeast are usually deep and narrow, but in the Coastal Plain they are broad and in most cases rise in three successive terraces above the stream. The harbour of Mobile was formed by the drowning of the lower part of the valley of the Alabama and Tombigbee rivers as a result of the sinking of the land here, such sinking having occurred on other parts of the Gulf coast.

The fauna and flora of Alabama are similar to those of the Gulf states in general and have no distinctive characteristics. However, the <a href="Mobile%20River">Mobile River</a> system has a high incidence of endemism among freshwater mollusks and biodiversity is high.

In Alabama, vast forests of <a href="pine">pine</a> constitute the largest proportion of the state's forest growth. There is also an abundance of <a href="Taxodium">cypress</a>, <a href="hickory">hickory</a>, <a href="oak">oak</a>, <a href="populus">populus</a>, and <a href="juniperus%20virginiana">eastern redcedar</a> trees. In other areas, <a href="conium">hemlock</a> growths in the north and <a href="chamaecyparis%20thyoides">southern white cedar</a> in the southwest. Other native trees include <a href="ash%20tree">ash</a>, <a href="celtis">hackberry</a>, and <a href="holly">holly</a>. In the Gulf region of the state grow various species of <a href="Arecaceae">palmetto</a> and <a href="arecaceae">palm</a>. In Alabama there are more than 150 <a href="shrub">shrub</a>s, including <a href="kalmia%20latifolia">mountain laurel</a> and <a href="rhododendron">rhododendron</a>. Among cultivated plants are <a href="wisteria">wisteria</a> and <a href="camellia">camellia</a>.

While in the past the state enjoyed a variety of mammals such as <a href="plains%20bison">plains bison</a>, <a href="eastern%20elk">eastern elk</a>, <a href="North%20American%20cougar">North American cougar</a>, <a href="bear">bear</a>, and <a href="deer">deer</a>, only the <a href="white-tailed%20deer">white-tailed deer</a> remains abundant. Still fairly common are the <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>, <a href="American%20beaver">American beaver</a>, <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>, <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>, <a href="Virginia%20opossum">Virginia opossum</a>, <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>, <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>, <a href="red%20fox">red</a> and <a href="gray%20fox">gray fox</a>es, and <a href="long-tailed%20weasel">long-tailed weasel</a>. <a href="Coypu">Coypu</a> and <a href="nine-banded%20armadillo">nine-banded armadillo</a> have been introduced to the state and now also common.

The <a href="climate">climate</a> of Alabama is <a href="humid%20subtropical%20climate">humid subtropical</a>.

The heat of summer is tempered in the south by the winds from the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, and in the north by the elevation above the sea. The average annual temperature is highest in the southwest along the coast, and lowest in the northeast among the highlands. Thus at Mobile the annual mean is 67 °F (19 °C), the mean for the summer 81 °F (27 °C), and for the winter 52 °F (11 °C); and at Valley Head, in De Kalb county, the annual mean is 59 °F (15 °C), the mean for the summer 75 °F (24 °C), and for the winter 41 °F (5 °C). At Montgomery, in the central region, the average annual temperature is 66 °F (19 °C), with a winter average of 49 °F (9 °C), and a summer average of 81 °F (27 °C). The average winter minimum for the entire state is 35 °F (2 °C), and there is an average of 35 days in each year in which the thermometer falls below the freezing-point. At extremely rare intervals the thermometer has fallen below zero (-18 °C), as was the case in the remarkable cold wave of the 12th-13 February 1899, when an absolute minimum of -17 °F (-29 °C) was registered at <a href="Valley%20Head%2C%20Alabama">Valley Head</a>. The highest temperature ever recorded was 109 °F (43 °C) in <a href="Talladega%20County%2C%20Alabama">Talladega</a> county in 1902.

The amount of precipitation is greatest along the coast (62 inches/1,574 mm) and evenly distributed through the rest of the state (about 52 inches/1,320 mm). During each winter there is usually one fall of snow in the south and two in the north; but the snow quickly disappears, and sometimes, during an entire winter, the ground is not covered with snow. Heavy snowfall can occur, such as during the <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve%201963%20snowstorm">New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm</a> and the <a href="1993%20Storm%20of%20the%20Century">1993 Storm of the Century</a>. <a href="Hail">Hail</a>storms occur occasionally in the spring and summer, but are seldom destructive. Heavy <a href="fog">fog</a>s are rare, and are confined chiefly to the coast. <a href="Thunderstorm">Thunderstorm</a>s occur throughout the year - they are most common in the summer, but most severe in the spring and fall, when destructive winds and <a href="tornado">tornado</a>es occasionally occur. The prevailing winds are from the news. <a href="Tropical%20cyclone">Hurricanes</a> are quite common in the state, especially in the southern part, and major hurricanes occasionally strike the coast which can be very destructive.

As regards its soil, Alabama may be divided into four regions. Extending from the Gulf northward for about 150 miles (240 km) is the outer belt of the Coastal Plain, also called the "Timber Belt," whose soil is sandy and poor, but responds well to fertilization. North of this is the inner lowland of the Coastal Plain, or the "Black Prairie," which includes some and seventeen counties. It receives its name from its soil (weathered from the weak underlying limestone), which is black in colour, almost destitute of sand and loam, and rich in limestone and marl formations, especially adapted to the production of cotton; hence the region is also called the "Cotton Belt." Between the "Cotton Belt" and the <a href="Tennessee%20Valley">Tennessee Valley</a> is the <a href="mineral">mineral</a> region, the "Old Land" area—a region of resistant rocks—whose soils, also derived from weathering in silu, are of varied fertility, the best coming from the granites, sandstones and limestones, the poorest from the gneisses, schists and slates. North of the mineral region is the "Cereal Belt," embracing the Tennessee Valley and the counties beyond, whose richest soils are the red clays and dark loams of the river valley; north of which are less fertile soils, produced by siliceous and sandstone formations.

Wetumpka is the home of "Alabama's greatest natural disaster." A -wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago. The hills just east of downtown showcase the eroded remains of the five mile (8 km) wide impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the <a href="Wetumpka%20crater">Wetumpka crater</a> or astrobleme ("star-wound") for the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock can be found beneath the surface. In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as an internationally recognized impact crater.

Alabama includes several types of public use lands. These include four national forests and one national preserve within state borders that provide over 25% of the state's public recreation land.

List of Governors of Alabama

The Governor of Alabama is the <a href="Head%20of%20government">chief executive</a> of the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>. The <a href="Governor%20%28United%20States%29">governor</a> is the head of the <a href="executive%20branch">executive branch</a> of <a href="Government%20of%20Alabama">Alabama's state government</a> and is charged with enforcing state laws. The governor has the power to either approve or <a href="veto">veto</a> bills passed by the <a href="Alabama%20Legislature">Alabama Legislature</a>, to convene the legislature, and to grant <a href="pardon">pardon</a>s, except in cases of <a href="impeachment">impeachment</a>. The governor is also the <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> of the <a href="U.S.%20state">state's</a> <a href="Alabama%20National%20Guard">military forces</a>.

There have officially been 54 governors of the state of Alabama; this official numbering skips acting and military governors. The first governor, <a href="William%20Wyatt%20Bibb">William Wyatt Bibb</a>, served as the only governor of the <a href="Alabama%20Territory">Alabama Territory</a>. Five people have served as acting governor, bringing the total number of people serving as governor to 59, spread over 63 distinct terms. Four governors have served multiple non-consecutive terms: <a href="Bibb%20Graves">Bibb Graves</a>, <a href="Jim%20Folsom">Jim Folsom</a>, and <a href="Fob%20James">Fob James</a> each served two, and <a href="George%20Wallace">George Wallace</a> served three non-consecutive periods. Officially, these non-consecutive terms are numbered only with the number of their first term. <a href="William%20D.%20Jelks">William D. Jelks</a> also served non-consecutive terms, but his first term was in an acting capacity.

The longest-serving governor was George Wallace, who served 16 years over four terms. The shortest term for a non-acting governor was that of <a href="Hugh%20McVay">Hugh McVay</a>, who served four and a half months after replacing the resigning <a href="Clement%20Comer%20Clay">Clement Comer Clay</a>. <a href="Lurleen%20Wallace">Lurleen Wallace</a>, wife of George Wallace, was the first woman to serve as governor of Alabama, and the third woman to serve as governor of any state. The current governor is Republican <a href="Kay%20Ivey">Kay Ivey</a>, who took office on April 10, 2017. She is the second female governor of Alabama.

<a href="Alabama%20Territory">Alabama Territory</a> was formed on March 3, 1817, from <a href="Mississippi%20Territory">Mississippi Territory</a>. It had only one governor appointed by the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a> before it became a state; he became the first state governor.

Alabama was <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20by%20date%20of%20statehood">admitted to the Union</a> on December 14, 1819. It seceded from the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> on January 11, 1861, and was a founding member of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a> on February 4, 1861. Following the end of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, Alabama during <a href="Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a> was part of the <a href="Third%20Military%20District">Third Military District</a>, which exerted some control over governor appointments and elections. Alabama was readmitted to the Union on July 14, 1868.

The first <a href="Alabama%20Constitution">Alabama Constitution</a>, ratified in 1819, provided that a governor be elected every two years, limited to serve no more than four out of every six years. This limit remained in place until the constitution of 1868, which simply allowed governors to serve terms of two years. The current constitution of 1901 increased terms to four years, but prohibited governors from succeeding themselves. Amendment 282 to the constitution, passed in 1968, allowed governors to succeed themselves once; a governor serves two consecutive terms can run again after waiting out the next term. The constitution had no set date for the commencement of a governor's term until 1901, when it was set at the first Monday after the second Tuesday in the January following an election.

The office of <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Alabama">lieutenant governor</a> was created in 1868, abolished in 1875, and recreated in 1901. According to the current constitution, should the governor be out of the state for more than 20 days, the lieutenant governor becomes <a href="acting%20governor">acting governor</a>, and if the office of governor becomes vacant the lieutenant governor ascends to the governorship. Earlier constitutions said the powers of the governor devolved upon the successor, rather than them necessarily becoming governor, but the official listing includes these as full governors. The governor and lieutenant governor are not elected on the same <a href="ticket%20%28election%29">ticket</a>.

Alabama was a strongly <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> state before the Civil War, electing only candidates from the <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party">Democratic-Republican</a> and Democratic parties. It had two <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> governors following Reconstruction, but after the Democratic Party re-established control, 112 years passed before voters chose another Republican.

<doc id="1288" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1288" title="Apocrypha">
Apocrypha

Apocrypha are works, usually written, of unknown authorship or of doubtful origin. <a href="Biblical%20apocrypha">Biblical apocrypha</a> is a set of texts included in the <a href="Latin%20Vulgate">Latin Vulgate</a> and <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> but not in the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>. While Catholic tradition considers the texts to be <a href="deuterocanonical%20books">deuterocanonical</a>, Protestants consider them apocryphal. Thus, Protestant bibles do not include the books within the Old Testament but have often included them in a separate section. Other non-canonical apocryphal texts are generally called <a href="pseudepigrapha">pseudepigrapha</a>, a term that means "false writings".

The word's origin is the <a href="Medieval%20Latin">Medieval Latin</a> adjective "apocryphus", "secret, or non-canonical", from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> adjective ("apokryphos"), "obscure", from the verb ("apokryptein"), "to hide away".

Apocrypha is commonly applied in Christian religious contexts involving certain disagreements about <a href="biblical%20canon">biblical canon</a>icity. Apocryphal writings are a class of documents rejected by some as being either pseudepigraphical and/or unworthy to be properly called Scripture, though, as with other writings, they may sometimes be referenced for support, such as the Book of Jasher. While writings that are now accepted by Christians as Scripture were recognized as being such by various believers early on, the establishment of a largely settled uniform canon was a process of centuries, and what the term "canon" (as well as "apocrypha") precisely meant also saw development. The canonical process took place with believers recognizing writings as being inspired by God from known or accepted origins, subsequently being followed by official affirmation of what had become largely established through the study and debate of the writings. The Roman Catholic church provided its first dogmatic definition of her entire canon in 1546, which put a stop to doubts and disagreements about the status of the Apocrypha, as well as certain other books, which had continued from the beginning of the NT church. The leader of the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>, like the Catholic church father <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> (and certain others), favored the <a href="Masoretic">Masoretic</a> canon for the Old Testament, excluding apocryphal books in his non-binding canon as being worthy to properly be called Scripture, but included most of them in a separate section, as per Jerome. Luther also doubted the canonicity of four New Testament books (Hebrews, James and Jude, and Revelation), which judgment Protestantism did not follow, but he did not title them Apocrypha.

Explaining the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> Church's canon is made difficult because of differences of perspective with the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> church in the interpretation of how it was done. Today Orthodox accept a few more books than appear in the Catholic canon.

The word "apocryphal" () was first applied to writings which were kept secret because they were the vehicles of <a href="esoteric">esoteric</a> knowledge considered too profound or too sacred to be disclosed to anyone other than the initiated. For example, the <a href="Apprenticeship">disciples</a> of the <a href="Gnostic">Gnostic</a> <a href="Prodicus">Prodicus</a> boasted that they possessed the secret () books of <a href="Zoroaster">Zoroaster</a>. The term in general enjoyed high consideration among the <a href="Gnostics">Gnostics</a> (see <a href="Acts%20of%20Thomas">Acts of Thomas</a>, pp. 10, 27, 44).

Sinologist <a href="Anna%20Seidel">Anna Seidel</a> refers to texts and even items produced by ancient Chinese sages as apocryphal and studied their uses during <a href="Six%20Dynasties">Six Dynasties</a> China (A.D. 220 to 589). These artifacts were used as symbols legitimizing and guaranteeing the Emperor's <a href="Mandate%20of%20Heaven">Heavenly Mandate</a>. Examples of these include talismans, charts, writs, tallies, and registers. The first examples were stones, jade pieces, bronze vessels and weapons, but came to include talismans and magic diagrams. From their roots in <a href="Zhou%20Dynasty">Zhou</a> era China (1066 to 256 B.C.) these items came to be surpassed in value by texts by the <a href="Han%20dynasty">Han dynasty</a> (206 B.C. to A.D. 220). Most of these texts have been destroyed as Emperors, particularly during the Han dynasty, collected these legitimizing objects and proscribed, forbade and burnt nearly all of them to prevent them from falling into the hands of political rivals. It is therefore fitting with the Greek root of the word, as these texts were obviously hidden away to protect the ruling Emperor from challenges to his status as Heaven's choice as sovereign.

"Apocrypha" was also applied to writings that were hidden not because of their divinity but because of their questionable value to the church. Many in <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> traditions cite Revelation 22:18–19 as a potential curse for those who attach any canonical authority to extra-biblical writings such as the Apocrypha. However, a strict explanation of this text would indicate it was meant for only the <a href="Book%20of%20Revelation">Book of Revelation</a>. Rv.22:18–19f. (KJV) states: "For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book." In this case, if one holds to a strict <a href="hermeneutic">hermeneutic</a>, the "words of the <a href="prophecy">prophecy</a>" do not refer to the Bible as a whole but to Jesus' "Revelation" to John. The early Christian theologian <a href="Origen">Origen</a>, in his "Commentaries on Matthew", distinguishes between writings which were read by the churches and apocryphal writings: ("writing not found on the common and published books in one hand, actually found on the secret ones on the other"). The meaning of αποκρυφος is here practically equivalent to "excluded from the public use of the church", and prepares the way for an even less favourable use of the word.

In general use, the word "apocrypha" came to mean "false, spurious, bad, or heretical." This meaning also appears in Origen's prologue to his commentary on the <a href="Song%20of%20Songs">Song of Songs</a>, of which only the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> translation survives: "De scripturis his, quae appellantur apocryphae, pro eo quod multa in iis corrupta et contra fidem veram inveniuntur a majoribus tradita non placuit iis dari locum nec admitti ad auctoritatem." "Concerning these scriptures, which are called apocryphal, for the reason that many things are found in them corrupt and against the true faith handed down by the elders, it has pleased them that they not be given a place nor be admitted to authority."

Other uses of "apocrypha" developed over the history of Western Christianity. The <a href="Gelasian%20Decree">Gelasian Decree</a> (generally held now as being the work of an anonymous scholar between 519 and 553) refers to religious works by <a href="church%20fathers">church fathers</a> <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>, <a href="Tertullian">Tertullian</a> and <a href="Clement%20of%20Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</a> as apocrypha. <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine</a> defined the word as meaning simply "obscurity of origin," implying that any book of unknown authorship or questionable authenticity would be considered apocryphal. On the other hand, <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> (in "Protogus Galeatus") declared that all books outside the Hebrew canon were apocryphal. In practice, Jerome treated some books outside the Hebrew canon as if they were canonical, and the Western Church did not accept Jerome's definition of apocrypha, instead retaining the word's prior meaning ("see: <a href="Deuterocanon">Deuterocanon</a>"). As a result, various church authorities labeled different books as apocrypha, treating them with varying levels of regard.
<a href="Origen">Origen</a> (who stated that "the canonical books, as the Hebrews have handed them down, are twenty-two"), <a href="Clement%20of%20Alexandria">Clement</a> and others cited some apocryphal books as "scripture," "divine scripture," "inspired," and the like. On the other hand, teachers connected with <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a> and familiar with the <a href="protocanonical%20books">Hebrew canon</a> excluded from the canon all of the Old Testament not found there. This view is reflected in the canon of <a href="Melito%20of%20Sardis">Melito of Sardis</a>, and in the prefaces and letters of Jerome. A third view was that the books were not as valuable as the canonical scriptures of the <a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> collection, but were of value for moral uses, as introductory texts for new converts from <a href="paganism">paganism</a>, and to be read in congregations. They were referred to as "<a href="ecclesiastical">ecclesiastical</a>" works by <a href="Tyrannius%20Rufinus">Rufinus</a>.

These three opinions regarding the apocryphal books prevailed until the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, when the idea of what constitutes canon became a matter of primary concern for <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>s and <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a>s alike. In 1546 the Catholic <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a> reconfirmed the canon of Augustine, dating to the second and third centuries, declaring "He is also to be anathema who does not receive these entire books, with all their parts, as they have been accustomed to be read in the Catholic Church, and are found in the ancient editions of the Latin <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a>, as sacred and canonical." The whole of the books in question, with the exception of <a href="1%20Esdras">1 Esdras</a> and <a href="2%20Esdras">2 Esdras</a> and the <a href="Prayer%20of%20Manasseh">Prayer of Manasseh</a>, were declared canonical at Trent. The Protestants, in comparison, were diverse in their opinion of the deuterocanon early on. Some considered them divinely inspired, others rejected them. Anglicans took a position between the Catholic Church and the Protestant Churches; they kept them as Christian intertestamental readings and a part of the Bible, but no doctrine should be based on them. <a href="John%20Wycliffe">John Wycliffe</a>, a 14th-century Christian Humanist, had declared in his biblical translation that "whatever book is in the Old Testament besides these twenty-five shall be set among the apocrypha, that is, without authority or belief." Nevertheless, his translation of the Bible included the <a href="Biblical%20apocrypha">apocrypha</a> and the <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Laodiceans">Epistle of the Laodiceans</a>.

Martin Luther did not class apocryphal books as being Scripture, but in both the <a href="Luther%20Bible">German</a> (1534) translation of the Bible, the apocrypha are published in a separate section from the other books, although the Lutheran and Anglican lists are different. In some editions (like the Westminster), readers were warned that these books were not "to be any otherwise approved or made use of than other human writings." A milder distinction was expressed elsewhere, such as in the "argument" introducing them in the <a href="Geneva%20Bible">Geneva Bible</a>, and in the Sixth Article of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, where it is said that "the other books the church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners," though not to establish doctrine. Among some other Protestants, the term "apocryphal" began to take on extra or altered connotations: not just of dubious authenticity, but having spurious or false content, not just obscure but having hidden or suspect motives. Protestants were (and are) not unanimous in adopting those meanings. The <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> agreed, and that view continues today throughout the <a href="Lutheran%20Church">Lutheran Church</a>, the worldwide <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a>, and many other denominations. Whichever implied meaning is intended, "Apocrypha" was (and is) used primarily by Protestants, in reference to the books of questioned canonicity. <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Catholics</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox">Orthodox</a> sometimes avoid using the term in contexts where it might be disputatious or be misconstrued as yielding on the point of canonicity. Thus the respect accorded to apocryphal books varied between Protestant denominations. Most Protestant published Bibles that include the apocryphal books will relocate them into a separate section (rather like an appendix), so as not to intermingle them with their canonical books.

According to the <a href="Orthodox%20Anglican%20Church">Orthodox Anglican Church</a>:
With few exceptions, the 66 book Protestantism canon (such as listed in the <a href="Westminster%20Confession">Westminster Confession</a> of 1646) has been well established for centuries, and with many today contending against the Apocrypha using various arguments.

The adjective "apocryphal" is commonly used in modern English to refer to any text or story considered to be of dubious veracity or authority, although it may contain some moral truth. In this broader metaphorical sense, the word suggests a claim that is in the nature of <a href="folklore">folklore</a>, <a href="factoid">factoid</a> or <a href="urban%20legend">urban legend</a>.

Although <a href="Orthodox%20Jews">Orthodox Jews</a> believe in the exclusive canonization of the current 24 books in the <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>, they also consider the <a href="Oral%20Torah">Oral Torah</a> to be authoritative, which they believe was handed down from <a href="Moses">Moses</a>. The <a href="Sadducees">Sadducees</a>—unlike the <a href="Pharisees">Pharisees</a> but like the <a href="Samaritans">Samaritans</a>—seem to have maintained an earlier and smaller number of texts as canonical, preferring to hold to only what was written in the Law of Moses (making most of the presently accepted canon, both Jewish and Christian, "apocryphal" in their eyes). Certain circles in Judaism, such as the <a href="Essene">Essene</a>s in Judea and the <a href="Therapeutae">Therapeutae</a> in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, were said to have a secret literature (see <a href="Dead%20Sea%20scrolls">Dead Sea scrolls</a>). Other traditions maintained different customs regarding canonicity. The Ethiopic Jews, for instance, seem to have retained a spread of canonical texts similar to the <a href="Ethiopian%20Orthodoxy">Ethiopian Orthodox Christians</a>, cf "Encyclopaedia Judaica", Vol 6, p 1147.

During the <a href="Apostolic%20Age">birth of Christianity</a>, some of the Jewish apocrypha that dealt with the coming of the Messianic kingdom became popular in the rising <a href="Jewish%20Christian">Jewish Christian</a> communities. Occasionally these writings were changed or added to, but on the whole it was found sufficient to reinterpret them as conforming to a <a href="New%20Covenant">Christian viewpoint</a>. Christianity eventually gave birth to new apocalyptic works, some of which were derived from traditional Jewish sources. Some of the Jewish apocrypha were part of the ordinary religious literature of the <a href="Early%20Christians">Early Christians</a>. This was strange, as the large majority of Old Testament references in the New Testament are taken from the Greek <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, which is the source of the <a href="deuterocanonical%20books">deuterocanonical books</a> as well as most of the other biblical apocrypha.

Slightly varying collections of additional Books (called deuterocanonical by the Roman Catholic Church) form part of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a>, <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> and <a href="Oriental%20Orthodox%20Church">Oriental Orthodox</a> canons. See <a href="Development%20of%20the%20Old%20Testament%20canon">Development of the Old Testament canon</a>.

The <a href="Book%20of%20Enoch">Book of Enoch</a> is included in the biblical canon only of the <a href="Oriental%20Orthodox">Oriental Orthodox</a> churches of Ethiopia and Eritrea. The <a href="Epistle%20of%20Jude">Epistle of Jude</a> quotes the book of Enoch, and some believe the use of this book also appears in the four gospels and <a href="1%20Peter">1 Peter</a>. The genuineness and inspiration of Enoch were believed in by the writer of the <a href="Epistle%20of%20Barnabas">Epistle of Barnabas</a>, <a href="Irenaeus">Irenaeus</a>, <a href="Tertullian">Tertullian</a> and <a href="Clement%20of%20Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</a> and much of the early church. The epistles of Paul and the gospels also show influences from the <a href="Book%20of%20Jubilees">Book of Jubilees</a>, which is part of the Ethiopian canon, as well as the <a href="Assumption%20of%20Moses">Assumption of Moses</a> and the <a href="Testaments%20of%20the%20Twelve%20Patriarchs">Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs</a>, which are included in no biblical canon.

The high position which some apocryphal books occupied in the first two centuries was undermined by a variety of influences in the Christian church. All claims to the possession of a secret tradition (as held by many <a href="Gnostic">Gnostic</a> sects) were denied by the influential theologians like <a href="Irenaeus">Irenaeus</a> and <a href="Tertullian">Tertullian</a>, which modern historians refer to as the <a href="Proto-orthodox%20Christianity">Proto-orthodox</a>, the timeframe of true inspiration was limited to the apostolic age, and universal acceptance by the church was required as proof of apostolic authorship. As these principles gained currency, books deemed apocryphal tended to become regarded as spurious and heretical writings, though books now considered deuterocanonical have been used in liturgy and theology from the first century to the present.

The actual status of the books which the Catholic church terms "Deuterocanonicals" (second canon) and Protestantism refers to as "Apocrypha" has been an issue of disagreement which preceded the Reformation. Many believe that the pre-Christian-era Jewish translation (into Greek) of holy scriptures known as the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, a Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures originally compiled around 280 B.C., originally included the apocryphal writings in dispute, with little distinction made between them and the rest of the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>. Others argue that the Septuagint of the first century did not contain these books but were added later by Christians, The earliest extant manuscripts of the Septuagint are from the fourth century, and suffer greatly from a lack of uniformity as regards containing apocryphal books, and some also contain books classed as <a href="Pseudepigrapha">Pseudepigrapha</a>, from which texts were cited by some early writers in the second and later centuries as being Scripture.

While a few scholars conclude that the Jewish canon was the achievement of the Hasmonean dynasty, it is generally considered to not have been finalized until about 100 A.D. or somewhat later, at which time considerations of Greek language and beginnings of Christian acceptance of the Septuagint weighed against some of the texts. Some were not accepted by the Jews as part of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> canon and the Apocrypha is not part of the historical Jewish canon.

Early church fathers such as <a href="Athanasius">Athanasius</a>, <a href="Melito">Melito</a>, <a href="Origen">Origen</a>, and <a href="Cyril%20of%20Jerusalem">Cyril of Jerusalem</a>, spoke against the canonicity of much or all of the apocrypha, but the most weighty opposition was the fourth century Catholic scholar <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> who preferred the Hebrew canon, whereas Augustine and others preferred the wider (Greek) canon, with both having followers in the generations that followed. The "Catholic Encyclopedia" states as regards the Middle Ages,

The wider Christian canon accepted by Augustine became the more established canon in the western Church after being promulgated for use in the Easter Letter of Athanasius (circa 372 A.D., though in the same letter he denied all apocryphal books as being Scripture, except for Baruch, while excluding Esther). the Synod of Rome (382 A.D., but its <a href="Decretum%20Gelasianum">Decretum Gelasianum</a> is generally considered to be a much later addition ) and the local councils of Carthage and Hippo in north Africa (391 and 393 A.D). Nevertheless, none of these constituted indisputable definitions, and significant scholarly doubts and disagreements about the nature of the Apocrypha continued for centuries and even into Trent, which provided the first infallible definition of the Catholic canon in 1546. This canon came to see appropriately 1,000 years of nearly uniform use by the majority, even after the 11th-century schism that separated the church into the branches known as the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> churches.

In the 16th century, the Protestant reformers challenged the canonicity of the books and partial-books found in the surviving Septuagint but not in the <a href="Masoretic%20Text">Masoretic Text</a>. In response to this challenge, after the death of Martin Luther (February 8, 1546) the ecumenical <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a> officially ("infallibly") declared these books (called "deuterocanonical" by Catholics) to be part of the canon in April, 1546 A.D. While the Protestant Reformers rejected the parts of the canon that were not part of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, they included the four New Testament books Luther held as doubtful canonicity along with the Apocrypha in his non-binding canon (though most were separately included in his bible, as they were in some editions of the KJV bible until 1947). Protestantism therefore established a 66 book canon with the 39 books based on the ancient Hebrew canon, along with the traditional 27 books of the New Testament. Protestants also rejected the Catholic term "deuterocanonical" for these writings, preferring to apply the term "apocryphal" which was already in use for other early and disputed writings. As today (but along with others reasons), various reformers argued that those books contained doctrinal or other errors and thus should not have been added to the canon for that reason. The differences between canons can be seen under <a href="Biblical%20canon%23Old%20Testament">Biblical canon</a> and <a href="Development%20of%20the%20Christian%20biblical%20canon">Development of the Christian biblical canon</a>. 
Explaining the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> Church's canon is made difficult because of differences of perspective with the <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> church in the interpretation of how it was done. Those differences (in matters of jurisdictional authority) were contributing factors in the <a href="East-West%20Schism">separation of the Roman Catholics and Orthodox</a> around 1054, but the formation of the canon which Trent would later officially definitively settle was largely complete by the fifth century, in not settled, six centuries before the separation. In the eastern part of the church, it took much of the fifth century also to come to agreement, but in the end it was accomplished. The canonical books thus established by the undivided church became the predominate canon for what was later to become Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox alike. The East did already differ from the West in not considering every question of canon yet settled, and it subsequently adopted a few more books into its Old Testament. It also allowed consideration of yet a few more to continue not fully decided, which led in some cases to adoption in one or more jurisdictions, but not all. Thus, there are today a few remaining differences of canon among Orthodox, and all Orthodox accept a few more books than appear in the Catholic canon. The <a href="Psalms%20of%20Solomon">Psalms of Solomon</a>, <a href="3%20Maccabees">3 Maccabees</a>, <a href="4%20Maccabees">4 Maccabees</a>, the <a href="Epistle%20of%20Jeremiah">Epistle of Jeremiah</a> the <a href="Book%20of%20Odes%20%28Bible%29">Book of Odes</a>, the <a href="Prayer%20of%20Manasseh">Prayer of Manasseh</a> and <a href="Psalm%20151">Psalm 151</a> are included in some copies of the Septuagint, some of which are accepted as canonical by Eastern Orthodox and some other churches. Protestants accept none of these additional books as canon either, but see them having roughly the same status as the other Apocrypha.

New Testament apocrypha—books similar to those in the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> but almost universally rejected by Catholics, Orthodox and Protestants—include several gospels and lives of apostles. Some were written by early Jewish Christians (see the <a href="Gospel%20according%20to%20the%20Hebrews">Gospel according to the Hebrews</a>). Others of these were produced by <a href="Gnosticism">Gnostic</a> authors or members of other groups later defined as <a href="Heterodoxy">heterodox</a>. Many texts believed lost for centuries were unearthed in the 19th and 20th centuries, producing lively speculation about their importance in early <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> among religious scholars, while many others survive only in the form of quotations from them in other writings; for some, no more than the title is known. Artists and theologians have drawn upon the New Testament apocrypha for such matters as the names of <a href="Dismas">Dismas</a> and <a href="Gestas">Gestas</a> and details about the <a href="Three%20Wise%20Men">Three Wise Men</a>. The first explicit mention of the <a href="perpetual%20virginity%20of%20Mary">perpetual virginity of Mary</a> is found in the <a href="pseudepigraphical">pseudepigraphical</a> <a href="Infancy%20Gospel%20of%20James">Infancy Gospel of James</a>.

Before the fifth century, the Christian writings that were then under discussion for inclusion in the canon but had not yet been accepted were classified in a group known as the ancient <a href="antilegomena">antilegomena</a>e. These were all candidates for the New Testament and included several books which were eventually accepted, such as: <a href="The%20Epistle%20to%20the%20Hebrews">The Epistle to the Hebrews</a>, <a href="2%20Peter">2 Peter</a>, <a href="3%20John">3 John</a> and the <a href="Revelation%20of%20John">Revelation of John</a> (Apocalypse). None of those accepted books can be considered Apocryphal now, since all Christendom accepts them as canonical. Of the uncanonized ones, the Early Church considered some heretical but viewed others quite well. Some Christians, in an extension of the meaning, might also consider the non-heretical books to be "apocryphal" along the manner of Martin Luther: not canon, but useful to read. This category includes books such as the <a href="Epistle%20of%20Barnabas">Epistle of Barnabas</a>, the <a href="Didache">Didache</a>, and <a href="The%20Shepherd%20of%20Hermas">The Shepherd of Hermas</a> which are sometimes referred to as the <a href="Apostolic%20Fathers">Apostolic Fathers</a>.
The <a href="Gnosticism">Gnostic tradition</a> was a prolific source of apocryphal gospels. While these writings borrowed the characteristic poetic features of apocalyptic literature from Judaism, Gnostic sects largely insisted on allegorical interpretations based on a secret apostolic tradition. With them, these apocryphal books were highly esteemed. A well-known Gnostic apocryphal book is the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Thomas">Gospel of Thomas</a>, the only complete text of which was found in the Egyptian town of <a href="Nag%20Hammadi">Nag Hammadi</a> in 1945. The <a href="Gospel%20of%20Judas">Gospel of Judas</a>, a Gnostic gospel, also received much media attention when it was reconstructed in 2006.

Roman Catholics and Orthodox Christians as well as Protestants generally agree on the canon of the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>, see <a href="Development%20of%20the%20New%20Testament%20canon">Development of the New Testament canon</a>. The <a href="Ethiopian%20Orthodox">Ethiopian Orthodox</a> have in the past also included <a href="Epistles%20of%20Clement%20%28disambiguation%29">I & II Clement</a> and <a href="Shepherd%20of%20Hermas">Shepherd of Hermas</a> in their <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> canon.

The List of Sixty, dating to around the 7th century, lists the sixty books of the Bible. The unknown author also lists several apocryphal books that are not included amongst the sixty. These books are:
Prophetic texts called the "Ch'an-wei" () were written by <a href="Han%20Dynasty">Han Dynasty</a> (206 BCE to 220 CE) Taoist priests to legitimize as well as curb imperial power. They deal with treasure objects that were part of the <a href="Zhou%20dynasty">Zhou</a> (1066 to 256 BCE) royal treasures. Emerging from the instability of the <a href="Warring%20States%20period">Warring States period</a> (476–221 BCE), ancient Chinese scholars saw the centralized rule of the Zhou as an ideal model for the new Han empire to emulate. The "Ch'an-wei" are therefore texts written by Han scholars about the Zhou royal treasures, only they were not written to record history for its own sake, but for legitimizing the current imperial reign. These texts took the form of stories about texts and objects being conferred upon the Emperors by Heaven and comprising these ancient sage-king's (this is how the Zhou emperors were referred to by this time, about 500 years after their peak) royal regalia. The desired effect was to confirm the Han emperor's <a href="Mandate%20of%20Heaven">Heavenly Mandate</a> through the continuity offered by his possession of these same sacred talismans. It is because of this politicized recording of their history that it is difficult to retrace the exact origins of these objects. What is known is that these texts were most likely produced by a class of literati called the "<a href="fangshi">fangshi</a>". These were a class of nobles who were not part of the state administration; they were considered specialists or occultists, for example diviners, astrologers, alchemists or healers. It is from this class of nobles that the first <a href="Taoist">Taoist</a> priests are believed to have emerged. <a href="Seidel%2C%20Anna">Seidel</a> points out however that the scarcity of sources relating to the formation of early <a href="Taoism">Taoism</a> make the exact link between the apocryphal texts and the Taoist beliefs unclear.

Apocryphal <a href="Jataka%20tales">Jatakas</a> of the <a href="Pali">Pali</a> Buddhist canon, such as those belonging to the Paññāsajātaka collection, have been adapted to fit local culture in certain <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>n countries and have been retold with amendments to the plots to better reflect Buddhist morals.

Within the Pali tradition, the apocryphal Jatakas of later composition (some dated even to the 19th century) are treated as a separate category of literature from the "Official" Jataka stories that have been more-or-less formally canonized from at least the 5th century—as attested to in ample epigraphic and archaeological evidence, such as extant illustrations in <a href="bas%20relief">bas relief</a> from ancient temple walls.

Antarctic Treaty System

The Antarctic Treaty and related agreements, collectively known as the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), regulate <a href="international%20relations">international relations</a> with respect to <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, Earth's only continent without a native human population. For the purposes of the treaty system, Antarctica is defined as all of the land and <a href="ice%20shelf">ice shelves</a> south of <a href="60th%20parallel%20south">60°S latitude</a>. The treaty, entering into force in 1961 and having 53 parties as of 2016, sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, establishes freedom of scientific investigation and bans <a href="Military%20activity%20in%20the%20Antarctic">military activity on that continent</a>. The treaty was the first <a href="arms%20control">arms control</a> agreement established during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. The <a href="Antarctic%20Treaty%20Secretariat">Antarctic Treaty Secretariat</a> headquarters have been located in <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, Argentina, since September 2004.

The main treaty was opened for signature on December 1, 1959, and officially entered into force on June 23, 1961. The original signatories were the 12 countries active in Antarctica during the <a href="International%20Geophysical%20Year">International Geophysical Year</a> (IGY) of 1957–58. The twelve countries that had significant interests in Antarctica at the time were: <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. These countries had established over 50 <a href="Research%20stations%20in%20Antarctica">Antarctic stations</a> for the IGY. The treaty was a diplomatic expression of the operational and scientific cooperation that had been achieved "on the ice".


The main objective of the ATS is to ensure in the interests of all humankind that Antarctica shall continue forever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and shall not become the scene or object of international discord. Pursuant to Article 1, the treaty forbids any measures of a military nature, but not the presence of military personnel or equipment for the purposes of scientific research.

Other agreements — some 200 recommendations adopted at treaty consultative meetings and ratified by governments — include:


The Antarctic Treaty System's yearly "Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCM)" are the international forum for the administration and management of the region. Only 29 of the 53 parties to the agreements have the right to participate in decision-making at these meetings, though the other 24 are still allowed to attend. The decision-making participants are the "Consultative Parties" and, in addition to the 12 original signatories, include 17 countries that have demonstrated their interest in Antarctica by carrying out substantial scientific activity there.

As of 2015, there are 53 states party to the treaty, 29 of which, including all 12 original signatories to the treaty, have consultative (voting) status. Consultative members include the seven nations that claim portions of Antarctica as national territory. The 46 non-claimant nations either do not recognize the claims of others, or have not stated their positions.
Note: The table can be sorted alphabetically or chronologically using the icon.

The "Antarctic Treaty Secretariat" was established in Buenos Aires, Argentina in September 2004 by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM). Jan Huber (Netherlands) served as the first Executive Secretary for five years until August 31, 2009. He was succeeded on September 1, 2009, by Manfred Reinke (Germany).

The tasks of the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat can be divided into the following areas:

Antarctica currently has no permanent population and therefore it has no citizenship nor government. All personnel present on Antarctica at any time are citizens or nationals of some sovereignty outside Antarctica, as there is no Antarctic sovereignty. The majority of Antarctica is claimed by one or more countries, but most countries do not explicitly recognize those claims. The area on the mainland between <a href="90th%20meridian%20west">90 degrees west</a> and <a href="150th%20meridian%20west">150 degrees west</a> is the only major land on Earth not claimed by any country. Until 2015 the interior of the Norwegian Sector, the extent of which had never been officially defined, was considered to be unclaimed. That year, Norway formally laid claim to the area between its <a href="Queen%20Maud%20Land">Queen Maud Land</a> and the South Pole.

Governments that are party to the Antarctic Treaty and its Protocol on Environmental Protection implement the articles of these agreements, and decisions taken under them, through national laws. These laws generally apply only to their own citizens, wherever they are in Antarctica, and serve to enforce the consensus decisions of the consultative parties: about which activities are acceptable, which areas require permits to enter, what processes of environmental impact assessment must precede activities, and so on. The Antarctic Treaty is often considered to represent an example of the <a href="common%20heritage%20of%20mankind">common heritage of mankind</a> principle.

According to Argentine regulations, any crime committed within 50 kilometers of any Argentine base is to be judged in <a href="Ushuaia%2C%20Tierra%20del%20Fuego">Ushuaia</a> (as capital of <a href="Tierra%20del%20Fuego%20Province%20%28Argentina%29">Tierra del Fuego, Antarctica, and South Atlantic Islands</a>). In the part of <a href="Argentine%20Antarctica">Argentine Antarctica</a> that is also claimed by Chile and UK, the person to be judged can ask to be transferred there.

Since the designation of the <a href="Australian%20Antarctic%20Territory">Australian Antarctic Territory</a> pre-dated the signing of the Antarctic Treaty, Australian laws that relate to Antarctica date from more than two decades before the Antarctic Treaty era. In terms of criminal law, the laws that apply to the <a href="Jervis%20Bay%20Territory">Jervis Bay Territory</a> (which follows the laws of the <a href="Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Australian Capital Territory</a>) apply to the Australian Antarctic Territory. Key Australian legislation applying Antarctic Treaty System decisions include the "Antarctic Treaty Act 1960", the "Antarctic Treaty (Environment Protection) Act 1980" and the "Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act 1981".

The <a href="law%20of%20the%20United%20States">law of the United States</a>, including certain criminal offences by or against U.S. nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under jurisdiction of other countries. To this end, the United States now stations special deputy <a href="United%20States%20Marshal">U.S. Marshals</a> in Antarctica to provide a law enforcement presence.

Some U.S. laws directly apply to Antarctica. For example, the <a href="Antarctic%20Conservation%20Act">Antarctic Conservation Act</a>, Public Law 95-541, "et seq.", provides civil and criminal penalties for the following activities, unless authorized by regulation or <a href="statute">statute</a>:

Violation of the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to US$10,000 in fines and one year in prison. The Departments of <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">the Treasury</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Commerce">Commerce</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Transportation</a>, and <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">the Interior</a> share enforcement responsibilities. The Act requires expeditions from the U.S. to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the <a href="Office%20of%20Oceans%20and%20Polar%20Affairs">Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">State Department</a>, which reports such plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty. Further information is provided by the <a href="Office%20of%20Polar%20Programs">Office of Polar Programs</a> of the <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a>.

In 2006, the New Zealand police reported that jurisdictional issues prevented them issuing warrants for potential American witnesses who were reluctant to testify during the Christchurch Coroner's investigation into the death by poisoning of Australian astrophysicist <a href="Rodney%20Marks%20%28astrophysicist%29">Rodney Marks</a> at the <a href="South%20Pole">South Pole</a> base in May 2000. Dr. Marks died while wintering over at the United States' <a href="Amundsen%26amp%3Bndash%3BScott%20South%20Pole%20Station">Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station</a> located at the geographic <a href="South%20Pole">South Pole</a>. Prior to autopsy, the death was attributed to natural causes by the <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a> and the contractor administering the base. However, an autopsy in New Zealand revealed that Dr. Marks died from <a href="methanol">methanol</a> poisoning. The <a href="New%20Zealand%20Police">New Zealand Police</a> launched an investigation. In 2006, frustrated by lack of progress, the <a href="Christchurch">Christchurch</a> Coroner said that it was unlikely that Dr. Marks ingested the methanol knowingly, although there is no certainty that he died as the direct result of the act of another person. During media interviews, the police detective in charge of the investigation criticized the National Science Foundation and contractor <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a> for failing to co-operate with the investigation.

South African law applies to all South African citizens in <a href="SANAE%20IV">Antarctica</a>, and they are subject to the jurisdiction of the <a href="magistrate%27s%20court%20%28South%20Africa%29">magistrate's court</a> in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>. In regard to violations of the Antarctic Treaty and related agreements, South Africa also asserts jurisdiction over South African residents and members of expeditions organised in South Africa.

Alfred Lawson

Alfred William Lawson (March 24, 1869 – November 29, 1954) was a professional <a href="baseball%23History">baseball</a> player, manager, and league promoter from 1887 through 1916 and went on to play a pioneering role in the U.S. aircraft industry. He published two early aviation trade journals.

He is frequently cited as the inventor of the <a href="airliner">airliner</a> and was awarded several of the first air mail contracts, which he ultimately could not fulfill. He founded the Lawson Aircraft Company in <a href="Green%20Bay%2C%20Wisconsin">Green Bay, Wisconsin</a>, to build military training aircraft and later the <a href="Lawson%20Airplane%20Company-Continental%20Faience%20and%20Tile%20Company">Lawson Airplane Company</a> in <a href="South%20Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin">South Milwaukee, Wisconsin</a>, to build airliners.

The crash of his ambitious <a href="Lawson%20L-4">Lawson L-4</a> "Midnight Liner" during its trial flight takeoff on May 8, 1921, ended his best chance for commercial aviation success.

In 1904, he wrote a novel, "Born Again", which he used to develop his theory of "Lawsonomy."

He made one start for the <a href="Boston%20Beaneaters">Boston Beaneaters</a> and two for the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Alleghenys">Pittsburgh Alleghenys</a> during the 1890 season. His minor league playing career lasted through 1895. He later managed in the minors from 1905 to 1907.

In 1908 he started a new professional baseball league known as the <a href="Union%20Professional%20League">Union Professional League</a>. The league took the field in April but folded one month later owing to financial difficulties.

An early advocate or rather evangelist of aviation, in October 1908 Mr. Lawson started the magazine "Fly" to stimulate public interest and educate readers in the fundamentals of the new science of aviation. It sold for 10 cents a copy from newsstands across the country. In 1910, moving to New York City, he renamed the magazine "Aircraft" and published it until 1914. The magazine chronicled the technical developments of the early aviation pioneers. He was the first advocate for commercial air travel, coining the term "airline." He also advocated for a strong American flying force, lobbying Congress in 1913 to expand its appropriations for Army aircraft.

In early 1913, he learned to fly the Sloan-Deperdussin and the <a href="Bl%C3%A9riot%20XI">Moisant-Bleriot</a> monoplanes, becoming an accomplished pilot. Later that year he bought a Thomas flying boat and became the first air commuter regularly flying from his country house in Seidler's Beach NJ to the foot of 75th Street in NYC (about 35 miles). In 1917, utilizing the knowledge gained from 10 years advocating aviation, he built his first airplane, the Lawson Military Tractor 1 (MT-1) trainer, and founded the Lawson Aircraft Corporation. The company's plant was sited at Green Bay, Wisconsin. There he secured a contract and built the Lawson MT-2. He also designed the steel fuselage Lawson Armored Battler, which never got beyond the drafting board, given doubts within the Army aviation community and the signing of the armistice.
After the war, in 1919 Lawson started a project to build America's first airline. He secured financial backing, and in five months he had built and demonstrated in flight his biplane airliner, the 18-passenger <a href="Lawson%20L-2">Lawson L-2</a>. He demonstrated its capabilities in a 2000-mile multi-city tour from Milwaukee to Chicago-Toledo-Cleveland-Buffalo-Syracuse-New york City-Washington, D.C.-Collinsville-Dayton-Chicago and back to Milwaukee, creating a buzz of positive press. The publicity allowed him to secure an additional $1 million to build the 26-passenger <a href="Lawson%20L-4">Midnight Liner</a>. The aircraft crashed on takeoff on its maiden flight. In late 1920, he secured government contracts for three airmail routes and to deliver 10 war planes, but owing to the fall 1920 recession, he could not secure the necessary $100,000 in cash reserves called for in the contracts and had to decline them. In 1926 he started his last airliner, the 56-seat, two-tier Lawson super airliner.
In this phase of his life, he was considered one of the leading thinkers in the budding American commercial aviation community, but his troubles with getting financial backing for his ideas led him to turn to economics, philosophy, and organization.

In the 1920s, he promoted health practices, including <a href="vegetarianism">vegetarianism</a>, and claimed to have found the secret of living to 200. He also developed his own highly unusual theories of physics, according to which such concepts as "penetrability", "suction and pressure" and "zig-zag-and-swirl" were discoveries on par with <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Einstein</a>'s <a href="Theory%20of%20Relativity">Theory of Relativity</a>. He published numerous books on these concepts, all set in a distinctive typography. Lawson repeatedly predicted the worldwide adoption of Lawsonian principles by the year 2000.

He later propounded his own philosophy, Lawsonomy, and the <a href="Lawsonian%20religion">Lawsonian religion</a>. He also developed, during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, the <a href="Populism">populist</a> economic theory of "<a href="Direct%20Credit">Direct Credit</a>s", according to which banks are the cause of all economic woes, the oppressors of both capital and labour. Lawson believed that the government should replace banks as the provider of loans to business and workers. His rallies and lectures attracted thousands of listeners in the early 1930s, mainly in the upper Midwest, but by the late 1930s the crowds had dwindled.

In 1943, he founded the <a href="University%20of%20Lawsonomy">University of Lawsonomy</a> in <a href="Des%20Moines%2C%20Iowa">Des Moines</a> to spread his teachings and offer the degree of "Knowledgian", but after various IRS and other investigations it was closed and finally sold in 1954, the year of Lawson's death. Lawson's financial arrangements remain mysterious to this day, and in later years he seems to have owned little property, moving from city to city as a guest of his farflung acolytes. In 1952, he was brought before a <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a> investigative committee on allegations that his organization had bought war surplus machines and then sold them for a profit, despite claiming <a href="non-profit">non-profit</a> status. His attempt to explain Lawsonomy to the senators ended in mutual frustration and bafflement.

A farm near <a href="Racine%2C%20Wisconsin">Racine, Wisconsin</a>, is the only remaining university facility, although a tiny handful of churches may yet survive in places such as <a href="Wichita%2C%20Kansas">Wichita, Kansas</a>. The large sign, formerly reading "University of Lawsonomy", was a familiar landmark for motorists in the region for many years and was visible from <a href="Interstate%2094">Interstate 94</a> about north of the <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> state line, on the east side of the highway. Although the sign still exists, the "of" has now been replaced by the <a href="Uniform%20Resource%20Locator">URL</a> of the Lawsonomy website. A storm in the spring of 2009 destroyed the sign, although the supporting posts are still visible. On the northbound side of Interstate 94, a sign on the roof of the building nearest the freeway said "Study Natural Law" until being shingled over in October 2014.

Lawson's brother, George H. Lawson, founded the <a href="United%20States%20Baseball%20League">United States League</a> in 1910. The new professional baseball league had the intent to racially integrate. The league lasted less than a season, but it was revived for one season by George Lawson's associates in 1912.

Ames is the only town in Iowa with a population of greater than 50,000 that does not have a state highway serving it. , Ames does not have any <a href="roundabout">roundabout</a>s, though a project to create three roundabouts is planned.

Ames was serviced by the Fort Dodge, Des Moines and Southern Railroad via a branch from <a href="Kelley%2C%20Iowa">Kelley</a> to Iowa State University and to downtown Ames. The tracks were removed in the 1960s. The <a href="Chicago%20and%20North%20Western%20Transportation%20Company">Chicago and North Western Transportation Company</a> twin mainline runs east and west bisecting the town and running just south of the downtown business district. The <a href="C%26amp%3BNW">C&NW</a> used to operate a branch to <a href="Des%20Moines%2C%20Iowa">Des Moines</a>. This line was removed in the 1980s when the Spine Line through <a href="Nevada%2C%20Iowa">Nevada</a> was purchased from the <a href="Rock%20Island%20Railroad">Rock Island Railroad</a> after its bankruptcy. The <a href="Union%20Pacific">Union Pacific</a>, successor to the C&NW, still runs 60–70 trains a day through Ames on twin mainlines, which leads to some traffic delays. There is also a branch to <a href="Eagle%20Grove%2C%20Iowa">Eagle Grove</a> that leaves Ames to the north. The Union Pacific maintains a small yard called Ames Yard east of Ames between Ames and Nevada. Ames has been testing automatic train horns at several of its crossings. These directional horns which are focused down the streets are activated when the crossing signals turn on and are shut off after the train crosses the crossing. This system cancels out the need for the trains to blow their horns. Train noise had been a problem in the residential areas to the west and northwest of downtown.

<a href="Ames%20Municipal%20Airport">Ames Municipal Airport</a> is located southeast of the city. The current (and only) <a href="Fixed-Base%20Operation">FBO</a> is Hap's Air Service, a company which has been based at the airport since 1975. The airport has two runways – 01/19, which is , and 13/31, which is .

The City of Ames offers a transit system throughout town, called <a href="CyRide">CyRide</a>, that is funded jointly by Iowa State University, the ISU Government of the Student Body, and the City of Ames. Rider fares are subsidized through this funding, and are free for children under five. Students pay a set cost as part of their tuition.

Ames has the headquarters of the <a href="Iowa%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Iowa Department of Transportation</a>.

Ames is served by <a href="Mary%20Greeley%20Medical%20Center">Mary Greeley Medical Center</a>, a 220-bed regional referral hospital which is adjacent to McFarland Clinic PC, central Iowa's largest physician-owned multi-specialty clinic, and also Iowa Heart Center.

Iowa is a political "<a href="battleground%20state">battleground state</a>" that has trended slightly <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> in recent years, and Ames, like <a href="Iowa%20City">Iowa City</a>, also trends Democratic. Because Iowa is the first caucus state and Ames is a <a href="college%20town">college town</a>, it is the site of many political appearances, debates and events, especially during election years.

From 1979 through 2011, Ames was the location of the <a href="Ames%20Straw%20Poll">Ames Straw Poll</a>, which was held every August prior to a presidential election year in which the Republican presidential nomination was undecided (meaning there was no Republican president running for re-election—as in 2011, 2007, 1999, 1995, 1987, and 1979). The poll would gauge support for the various Republican candidates amongst attendees of a <a href="fundraising">fundraising</a> dinner benefiting the <a href="Republican%20Party%20of%20Iowa">Iowa Republican Party</a>. The straw poll was frequently seen by national media and party insiders as a first test of organizational strength in Iowa. In 2015, the straw poll was to be moved to nearby Boone before the Iowa Republican Party eventually decided to cancel it altogether.

"<a href="Haliotis%20asinina">Haliotis asinina</a>" has a somewhat different shape, as it is more elongated and distended. The shell of "Haliotis cracherodii cracherodii" is also unusual as it has an <a href="wikt%3Aovate">ovate</a> form, is <a href="wikt%3Aimperforate">imperforate</a>, shows an <a href="wikt%3Aexsert">exserted</a> spire, and has prickly ribs.

A <a href="mantle%20%28mollusc%29">mantle</a> cleft in the shell impresses a groove in the shell, in which are the row of holes characteristic of the genus. These holes are respiratory apertures for venting water from the gills and for releasing sperm and eggs into the water column. They make up what is known as the <a href="selenizone">selenizone</a> which forms as the shell grows. This series of 8 to 38 holes is near the anterior margin. Only a small number are generally open. The older holes are gradually sealed up as the shell grows and new holes form. Each species has a typical number of open holes, between four and ten, in the selenizone. An abalone has no <a href="Operculum%20%28gastropod%29">operculum</a>. The <a href="Aperture%20%28mollusc%29">aperture</a> of the shell is very wide and <a href="wikt%3Anacreous">nacreous</a>.

The exterior of the shell is striated and dull. The color of the shell is very variable from species to species which may reflect the animal's diet. The iridescent <a href="nacre">nacre</a> that lines the inside of the shell varies in color from silvery white, to pink, red and green-red to deep blue, green to purple.

The animal has <a href="wikt%3Afimbriated">fimbriated</a> head-lobes and side-lobes which are fimbriated and <a href="Cirrus%20%28biology%29">cirrated</a>. The <a href="radula">radula</a> has small median teeth, and the lateral teeth are single and beam-like. There are about 70 <a href="uncini">uncini</a>, with <a href="wikt%3Adenticulated">denticulated</a> hooks, the first four very large. The rounded foot is very large in comparison to most molluscs. The soft body is coiled around the <a href="Columella%20%28gastropod%29">columellar muscle</a>, and its insertion, instead of being on the columella, is on the middle of the inner wall of the shell. The <a href="gill">gill</a>s are symmetrical and both well developed.

These snails cling solidly with their broad, muscular foot to rocky surfaces at <a href="Sublittoral%20zone">sublittoral</a> depths, although some species such as "<a href="Haliotis%20cracherodii">Haliotis cracherodii</a>" used to be common in the <a href="intertidal%20zone">intertidal zone</a>. Abalones reach maturity at a relatively small size. Their <a href="fecundity">fecundity</a> is high and increases with their size, laying from 10,000 to 11 million eggs at a time. The <a href="spermatozoa">spermatozoa</a> are <a href="wikt%3Afiliform">filiform</a> and pointed at one end, and the anterior end is a rounded head.

The adults provide no further assistance to the <a href="larva">larva</a>e and they are described as <a href="Marine%20larval%20ecology%23Larval%20development%20strategies">lecithotrophic</a>. The adults are <a href="herbivorous">herbivorous</a> and feed with their <a href="Radula%23The%20seven%20basic%20types">rhipidoglossan</a> <a href="radula">radula</a> on <a href="macroalgae">macroalgae</a>, preferring red or brown algae.

The haliotid family has a worldwide distribution, along the coastal waters of every continent, except the Pacific coast of South America, the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East Coast of the United States</a>, the <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a>, and <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. The majority of abalone species are found in cold waters, such as off the coasts of New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, Western North America, and Japan.

The shell of the abalone is exceptionally strong and is made of microscopic <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> tiles stacked like bricks. Between the layers of tiles is a clingy protein substance. When the abalone shell is struck, the tiles slide instead of shattering and the protein stretches to absorb the energy of the blow. <a href="Material%20science">Material scientists</a> around the world are studying this tiled structure for insight into stronger ceramic products such as <a href="body%20armor">body armor</a>. The dust created by grinding and cutting abalone shell is dangerous; appropriate safeguards must be taken to protect people from inhaling these particles. 

Abalones are subject to various diseases. The <a href="Department%20of%20Primary%20Industries%20%28Victoria%29">Victorian Department of Primary Industries</a> said in 2007 that <a href="abalone%20viral%20ganglioneuritis">ganglioneuritis</a> killed up to 90% of stock in affected regions. Abalone are also severe <a href="hemophiliacs">hemophiliacs</a> as their fluids will not clot in the case of a laceration or puncture wound. Members of the <a href="Spionidae">Spionidae</a> family of the <a href="Polychaeta">polychaetes</a> are known as pests of abalone.

The meat (foot muscle) of abalone is used for food, and the shells of abalone are used as decorative items and as a source of <a href="mother%20of%20pearl">mother of pearl</a> for jewelry, buttons, buckles, and inlay. Abalone shells have been found in archaeological sites around the world, ranging from 75,000-year-old deposits at Blombos Cave in South Africa to historic Chinese abalone middens on California's Northern Channel Islands. On the Channel Islands, where abalones were harvested by Native Americans for at least 12,000 years, the size of red abalone shells found in middens declines significantly after about 4000 years ago, probably due to human predation. Worldwide, abalone pearls have also been collected for centuries.

Farming of abalone began in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Japan and China. Since the mid-1990s, there have been many increasingly successful endeavors to commercially farm abalone for the purpose of consumption. Overfishing and poaching have reduced wild populations to such an extent that farmed abalone now supplies most of the abalone meat consumed. The principal abalone farming regions are China, Taiwan, Japan, and Korea. Abalone is also farmed in Australia, Canada, Chile, France, <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, Ireland, Mexico, <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, and the United States.

After trials in 2012, a commercial "sea ranch" was set up in <a href="Flinders%20Bay">Flinders Bay</a>, Western Australia to raise abalone. The ranch is based on an artificial reef made up of 5000 () separate concrete units called "abitats" (abalone habitats). The abitats can host 400 abalone each. The reef is seeded with young abalone from an onshore hatchery.

The abalone feed on seaweed that has grown naturally on the habitats; with the ecosystem enrichment of the bay also resulting in growing numbers of dhufish, pink snapper, wrasse, Samson fish among other species.

Brad Adams, from the company, has emphasised the similarity to wild abalone and the difference from shore based aquaculture. "We're not aquaculture, we're ranching, because once they're in the water they look after themselves."

Abalones have long been a valuable food source for humans in every area of the world where a species is abundant. The meat of this mollusc is considered a <a href="delicacy">delicacy</a> in certain parts of <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a> (especially <a href="Chile">Chile</a>), France, New Zealand, <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, and <a href="East%20Asia">East Asia</a> (especially in China, Vietnam, Japan, and Korea). In Chinese-speaking regions, abalone is commonly known as "<a href="bao%20yu">bao yu</a>", and sometimes forms part of a Chinese banquet. In the same way as <a href="shark%20fin%20soup">shark fin soup</a> or <a href="bird%27s%20nest%20soup">bird's nest soup</a>, abalone is considered a <a href="luxury%20item">luxury item</a>, and is traditionally reserved for special occasions such as weddings and other celebrations. However, the availability of commercially farmed abalone has allowed more common consumption of this once rare delicacy.

Abalone started to become popular after the <a href="Panama%E2%80%93Pacific%20International%20Exposition">Panama–Pacific International Exposition</a> in 1915.

As abalone became more popular and less common, the prices adjusted accordingly. In the 1920s, a restaurant-served portion of abalone, about 4 ounces, would cost (in inflation adjusted dollars) about $7; by 2004, the price had risen to $75. In America, prior to this time, abalone was predominantly eaten, gathered, and prepared by Chinese immigrants. Before that, abalone were collected to be eaten, and used for other purposes by Native American tribes. By 1900, laws were passed in California to outlaw the taking of abalone above the intertidal zone. This forced the Chinese out of the market and the Japanese perfected diving, with or without gear, to enter the market. By the time of the exposition, Americans were starting to discover abalone. The popularity of abalone, along with many other fish and shellfish, increased as the exposition exhibited 365 varieties of fish with cooking demonstrations, and a 1300-seat dining hall.

In Japan, live and raw abalones are used in awabi sushi, or served steamed, salted, boiled, chopped, or simmered in <a href="soy%20sauce">soy sauce</a>. Salted, fermented abalone entrails are the main component of "tottsuru", a local dish from Honshū. "Tottsuru" is mainly enjoyed with sake.

In California, abalone meat can be found on pizza, sautéed with caramelized mango, or in steak form dusted with cracker meal and flour.

<a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> supplies about 25% of the yearly world abalone harvest. Around 12,500 Tasmanians recreationally fish for <a href="Haliotis%20rubra">blacklip</a> and <a href="Haliotis%20laevigata">greenlip</a> abalone. For blacklip abalone, the size limit varies between for the southern end of the state and for the northern end of the state. Greenlip abalones have a minimum size of , except for an area around <a href="Perkins%20Bay">Perkins Bay</a> in the north of the state where the minimum size is . With a recreational abalone licence, the bag limit is 10 per day, with a total possession limit of 20. <a href="Scuba%20diving">Scuba diving</a> for abalone is allowed, and has a rich history in Australia. (Scuba diving for abalone in the states of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> is illegal; a <a href="free-diving">free-diving</a> catch limit of two is allowed).

<a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> has had an active abalone fishery since the late 1950s. The state is sectioned into three fishing zones, Eastern, Central and Western, with each fisher required a zone-allocated licence. Harvesting is performed by divers using surface-supplied air "hookah" systems operating from runabout-style, outboard-powered boats. While the diver seeks out colonies of abalone amongst the reef beds, the deckhand operates the boat, known as working "live" and stays above where the diver is working. Bags of abalone pried from the rocks are brought to the surface by the diver or by way of "shot line", where the deckhand drops a weighted rope for the catch bag to be connected then retrieved. Divers measure each abalone before removing from the reef and the deckhand remeasures each abalone and removes excess weed growth from the shell. Since 2002, the Victorian industry has seen a significant decline in catches, with the total allowable catch reduced from 1440 to 787 tonnes for the 2011/12 fishing year, due to dwindling stocks and most notably the abalone virus <a href="ganglioneuritis">ganglioneuritis</a>, which is fast-spreading and lethal to abalone stocks.

Sport harvesting of <a href="red%20abalone">red abalone</a> is permitted with a California fishing license and an abalone stamp card. In 2008, the abalone card also came with a set of 24 tags. This was reduced to 18 abalone per year in 2014, and as of 2017 the limit has been reduced to 12, only nine of which may be taken south of <a href="Mendocino%20County%2C%20California">Mendocino County</a>. Legal-size abalone must be tagged immediately. Abalone may only be taken using breath-hold techniques or shorepicking; scuba diving for abalone is strictly prohibited. Taking of abalone is not permitted south of the mouth of the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>. A size minimum of measured across the shell is in place. A person may be in possession of only three abalone at any given time.

As of 2017, Abalone season is May to October, excluding July. Transportation of abalone may only legally occur while the abalone is still attached in the shell. Sale of sport-obtained abalone is illegal, including the shell. Only red abalone may be taken, as <a href="Black%20abalone">black</a>, <a href="White%20abalone">white</a>, <a href="Haliotis%20corrugata">pink</a>, <a href="Haliotis%20walallensis">flat</a>, <a href="Green%20abalone">green</a>, and <a href="Northern%20abalone">pinto</a> abalone are protected by law.

An abalone diver is normally equipped with a thick <a href="wetsuit">wetsuit</a>, including a hood, <a href="Wetsuit%20boots">bootee</a>s, and gloves, and usually also a mask, <a href="Snorkeling">snorkel</a>, <a href="Diving%20weighting%20system%23Weight%20belt">weight belt</a>, abalone iron, and abalone gauge. Alternatively, the rock picker can feel underneath rocks at low tides for abalone. Abalone are mostly taken in depths from a few inches up to ; less common are freedivers who can work deeper than . Abalone are normally found on rocks near food sources such as <a href="kelp">kelp</a>. An abalone iron is used to pry the abalone from the rock before it has time to fully clamp down. Divers dive from boats, kayaks, tube floats, or directly off the shore.

The largest abalone recorded in California is , caught by John Pepper somewhere off the coast of <a href="San%20Mateo%20County%2C%20California">San Mateo County</a> in September 1993.

The mollusc "<a href="Concholepas%20concholepas">Concholepas concholepas</a>" is often sold in the United States under the name "Chilean abalone", though it is not an abalone, but a <a href="Muricidae">muricid</a>.

In New Zealand, abalone is called "pāua" (, from the <a href="M%C4%81ori%20language">Māori language</a>). "Haliotis iris" (or blackfoot "pāua") is the ubiquitous New Zealand "pāua", the highly polished nacre of which is extremely popular as souvenirs with its striking blue, green, and purple iridescence. "<a href="Haliotis%20australis">Haliotis australis</a>" and "<a href="Haliotis%20virginea">Haliotis virginea</a>" are also found in New Zealand waters, but are less popular than "H. iris".

Like all New Zealand shellfish, recreational harvesting of "pāua" does not require a permit provided catch limits, size restrictions, and seasonal and local restrictions set by the <a href="Ministry%20for%20Primary%20Industries%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Ministry for Primary Industries</a> (MPI) are followed. The legal recreational daily limit is 10 per diver, with a minimum shell length of for "H. iris" and for "H. australis". In addition, no person may be in possession, even on land, of more than 20 "pāua" or more than of "pāua" meat at any one time. "Pāua" can only be caught by free-diving; it is illegal to catch them using scuba gear.

An extensive global black market exists in collecting and exporting abalone meat. This can be a particularly awkward problem where the right to harvest "pāua" can be granted legally under <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> customary rights. When such permits to harvest are abused, it is frequently difficult to police. The limit is strictly enforced by roving <a href="Ministry%20for%20Primary%20Industries%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Ministry for Primary Industries</a> fishery officers with the backing of the New Zealand Police. <a href="Poaching">Poaching</a> is a major industry in New Zealand with many thousands being taken illegally, often undersized. Convictions have resulted in seizure of diving gear, boats, and motor vehicles and fines and in rare cases, imprisonment. The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Fisheries%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Ministry of Fisheries</a> expects in the year 2004/05, nearly 1,000 tons of "pāua" will be poached, with 75% of that being undersized.

The largest abalone in South Africa, "<a href="Haliotis%20midae">Haliotis midae</a>", occurs along roughly two-thirds of the country’s coastline. Abalone-diving has been a recreational activity for many years, but stocks are currently being threatened by illegal commercial harvesting. In South Africa, all persons harvesting this shellfish need permits that are issued annually, and no abalone may be harvested using scuba gear.

For the last few years, however, no permits have been issued for collecting abalone, but commercial harvesting still continues as does illegal collection by <a href="Criminal%20organization">syndicates</a>.
In 2007, because of widespread <a href="poaching">poaching</a> of abalone, the South African government listed abalone as an endangered species according to the <a href="CITES">CITES</a> section III appendix, which requests member governments to monitor the trade in this species. This listing was removed from CITES in June 2010 by the South African government and South African abalone is no longer subject to CITES trade controls. Export permits are still required, however.
The abalone meat from South Africa is prohibited for sale in the country to help reduce poaching; however, much of the illegally harvested meat is sold in Asian countries. As of early 2008, the wholesale price for abalone meat was approximately US$40.00 per kilogram. There is an active trade in the shells, which sell for more than US$1,400 per metric tonne.

Ormers ("<a href="Green%20ormer">Haliotis tuberculata</a>") are considered a delicacy in the British <a href="Channel%20Islands">Channel Islands</a> as well as in adjacent areas of <a href="France">France</a>, and are pursued with great alacrity by the locals. This, and a recent lethal bacterial disease, has led to a dramatic depletion in numbers since the latter half of the 19th century, and "ormering" is now strictly regulated in order to preserve stocks. The gathering of ormers is now restricted to a number of 'ormering tides', from January 1 to April 30, which occur on the full or new moon and two days following. No ormers may be taken from the beach that are under in shell length. Gatherers are not allowed to wear wetsuits or even put their heads underwater. Any breach of these laws is a criminal offense and can lead to fine of up to £5,000 or six months in prison. The demand for ormers is such that they led to the world's first underwater arrest, when Mr. Kempthorne-Leigh of Guernsey was arrested by a police officer in full diving gear when illegally diving for ormers.

The highly iridescent inner nacre layer of the shell of abalone has traditionally been used as a decorative item, in <a href="jewelry">jewelry</a>, buttons, and as inlay in furniture and in musical instruments such as guitars, etc.

Abalone pearl jewelry is very popular in New Zealand and Australia, in no minor part due to the marketing and farming efforts of pearl companies. Unlike the Oriental Natural, the Akoya pearl, and the South Sea and Tahitian cultured pearls, abalone pearls are not primarily judged by their roundness. The inner shell of the abalone is an iridescent swirl of intense colours, ranging from deep cobalt blue and peacock green to purples, creams and pinks. Therefore, each pearl, natural or cultured, will have its own unique collage of colours.

The shells of abalone are occasionally used in New Age <a href="smudging">smudging</a> ceremonies to catch falling ash. They have also been used as incense burners.

Abalone has been an important staple in native cultures around the world, specifically in Africa and on the North American West coast. The meat was used as food, and the shell was used as currency for many tribes.

Abalones have been identified as one of the many classes of organism threatened with extinction due to overfishing, <a href="ocean%20acidification">acidification of oceans</a> from <a href="human%20impact%20on%20the%20environment">anthropogenic</a> <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, as reduced pH erodes their shells. It is predicted that abalones will become extinct in the wild within 200 years at current rates of carbon dioxide production. Currently the white, pink, and green abalone are on the federal endangered species list, and possible restoration sites have been proposed for the San Clemente Island and Santa Barbara Island areas. The possibility of farming abalone to be reintroduced into the wild has also been proposed, with these abalone having special tags to help track the population.

The number of species that are recognized within the genus "Haliotis" has fluctuated over time, and depends on the source that is consulted. The number of recognized species range from 30 to 130. This list finds a compromise using the "WoRMS database", plus some species that have been added, for a total of 57. The majority of abalone have not been rated for conservation status. Those that have been reviewed tend to show that the abalone in general is an animal that is declining in numbers, and will need protection throughout the globe.

Abbess

In Christianity, an abbess (<a href="Latin">Latin</a> "abbatissa", <a href="Grammatical%20gender">feminine form</a> of "abbas," <a href="abbot">abbot</a>) is the female <a href="Superior%20%28hierarchy%29">superior</a> of a community of <a href="nun">nun</a>s, which is often an <a href="abbey">abbey</a>.

In the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> (both the <a href="Latin%20Church">Latin Church</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Catholic%20Churches">Eastern Catholic</a>), <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a>, <a href="Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Alexandria">Coptic</a> and <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> abbeys, the mode of election, position, rights, and authority of an abbess correspond generally with those of an <a href="abbot">abbot</a>. She must be at least 40 years old and have been a nun for 10 years. The age requirement in the Catholic Church has evolved over time, ranging from 30 to 60. The requirement of 10 years as a nun is only 8 in Catholicism. In the rare case of there not being a nun with the qualifications, the requirements may be lowered to 30 years of age and 5 of those in an "upright manner", as determined by the superior. A woman who is of illegitimate birth, is not a virgin, has undergone non-salutory public penance, is a widow, or is blind or deaf, is typically disqualified for the position, saving by permission of the Holy See. The office is elective, the choice being by the secret votes of the nuns belonging to the community. Like an abbot, after being confirmed in her office by the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a>, an abbess is solemnly admitted to her office by a formal blessing, conferred by the bishop in whose territory the monastery is located, or by an abbot or another <a href="bishop">bishop</a> with appropriate permission. Unlike the abbot, the abbess receives only the ring, the <a href="crosier">crosier</a>, and a copy of the rule of the order. She does not receive a <a href="mitre">mitre</a> as part of the ceremony. The abbess also traditionally adds a <a href="pectoral%20cross">pectoral cross</a> to the outside of her habit as a symbol of office, though she continues to wear a modified form of her religious habit or dress, as she is unordained—females cannot be ordained—and so does not vest or use choir dress in the liturgy. An abbess serves for life, except in <a href="Italy">Italy</a> and some adjacent islands.

Abbesses are, like abbots, major superiors according to <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a>, the equivalents of abbots or bishops (the ordained male members of the church hierarchy who have, by right of their own office, executive jurisdiction over a building, diocesan territory, or a communal or non-communal group of persons—juridical entities under church law). They receive the vows of the nuns of the abbey; they may admit candidates to their order's novitiate; they may send them to study; and they may send them to do pastoral or missionary, or to work or assist—to the extent allowed by canon and civil law—in the administration and ministry of a parish or diocese (these activities could be inside or outside the community's territory). They have full authority in its administration. However, there are significant limitations. They may not administer the sacraments, whose celebration is reserved to bishops, <a href="priest">priest</a>s, <a href="deacon">deacon</a>s (clerics), namely, those in <a href="Holy%20Orders">Holy Orders</a>. They may make provision for an ordained cleric to help train and to admit some of their members, if needed, as altar servers, extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion, or lectors—all ministries which are now open to the non-ordained. They may not serve as a witness to a marriage except by special rescript. They may not administer Penance (Reconciliation), Anointing of the Sick (<a href="Extreme%20Unction">Extreme Unction</a>), or function as an ordained celebrant or concelebrant of the <a href="Mass">Mass</a> (by virtue of their office and their training and institution, they may act, if the need arises, as altar servers, lectors, ushers, porters, or extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion, and if need be, the Host). They may preside the <a href="Liturgy%20of%20the%20Hours">Liturgy of the Hours</a> which they are obliged to say with their community, speak about Scripture to their community, and give certain types of blessings not reserved to the clergy. On the other hand, they may not ordinarily give a homily or read the Gospel during a Mass. As they do not receive episcopal ordination in the Catholic, Orthodox and Oriental Churches, they do not possess the ability to ordain others, nor do they exercise the authority they do possess under canon law over any territories outside of their monastery and its territory (though non-cloistered, non-contemplative female religious members who are based in a convent or monastery but who participate in external affairs may assist as needed by the diocesan bishop and local secular clergy and laity, in certain pastoral ministries and administrative and non-administrative functions not requiring ordained ministry or status as a male cleric in those churches or programs). There are exigent circumstances, where due to Apostolical privilege, certain Abbesses have been granted rights and responsibilities above the normal, such as the Abbess of the <a href="Cistercian%20Monastery">Cistercian Monastery</a> of <a href="Abbey%20of%20Santa%20Mar%C3%ADa%20la%20Real%20de%20Las%20Huelgas">Santa Maria la Real de las Huelgas</a> near <a href="Burgos">Burgos</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. Also granted exceptional rights was the Abbess of the Cistercian order in <a href="Conversano">Conversano</a> <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. She was granted the ability to appoint her own vicar-general, select and approve the confessors, along with the practice of receiving the public homage of her clergy. This practice continued until some of the duties were modified due to an appeal by the clergy to Rome. Finally in 1750, the public homage was abolished.

Historically, in some <a href="Celtic%20Christianity">Celtic</a> monasteries abbesses presided over joint-houses of monks and nuns, the most famous example being Saint <a href="Brigid%20of%20Kildare">Brigid of Kildare's</a> leadership in the founding of the monastery at <a href="Kildare">Kildare</a> in <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>. This custom accompanied Celtic monastic missions to <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, and even to <a href="Rome">Rome</a> itself. In 1115, Robert, the founder of <a href="Fontevraud%20Abbey">Fontevraud Abbey</a> near <a href="Chinon">Chinon</a> and <a href="Saumur">Saumur</a>, France, committed the government of the whole order, men as well as women, to a female superior.

In <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> churches, the title of abbess (German "Äbtissin") has in some cases (e.g. ) survived to designate the heads of abbeys which since the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> have continued as monasteries or convents (German "<a href="Stift">Stift</a>e"). These positions continued merely changing from Catholic to Lutheran. The first to make this change was the <a href="Quedlinburg%20Abbey">Abbey of Quedlinburg</a>, whose last Catholic Abbess died in 1514. These are collegiate foundations, which provide a home and an income for unmarried ladies, generally of noble birth, called canonesses (German "Kanonissinen") or more usually "Stiftsdamen" or "Kapitularinnen". The office of abbess is of considerable social dignity, and in the past, was sometimes filled by princesses of the reigning houses. Until the dissolution of <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and <a href="German%20Mediatisation">mediatisation</a> of smaller imperial fiefs by Napoleon, the evangelical Abbess of <a href="Quedlinburg%20Abbey">Quedlinburg</a> was also per officio the head of that "<a href="reichsunmittelbar">reichsunmittelbar</a>" state. The last such ruling abbess was <a href="Sofia%20Albertina%2C%20Princess%20of%20Sweden">Sofia Albertina, Princess of Sweden</a>.

In the <a href="Hrad%C4%8Dany">Hradčany</a> of <a href="Prague">Prague</a> is a Catholic institute whose mistress is titled an Abbess. It was founded in 1755 by the <a href="Empress%20Maria%20Theresa">Empress Maria Theresa</a>, and traditionally was responsible for the coronation of the <a href="Queen%20of%20Bohemia">Queen of Bohemia</a>. The Abbess is required to be an Austrian Archduchess.

During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> abbesses were known to attempt usurpation of the spiritual power forbidden them. Attempts were made to bless, give penance, make the sign of the cross on the foreheads of men, even administer the sacrament. The pope has categorized these forays into the forbidden as "unheard of, most indecorous, and highly preposterous," adding that "these Abbesses had evidently overrated theor spiritual powers a trifle." The Roman Catholic Church has around 200 abbesses at present. The oldest women's abbey in Germany being <a href="St.%20Marienthal%20Abbey">St. Marienthal Abbey</a> of <a href="Cistercian%20nuns">Cistercian nuns</a>, near <a href="Ostritz">Ostritz</a>, established during the early 13th-century.

Abdominal surgery

The term abdominal surgery broadly covers surgical procedures that involve opening the <a href="abdomen">abdomen</a>. Surgery of each abdominal organ is dealt with separately in connection with the description of that organ (see <a href="stomach">stomach</a>, <a href="kidney">kidney</a>, <a href="liver">liver</a>, etc.) Diseases affecting the abdominal cavity are dealt with generally under their own names (e.g. <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a>).

The most common abdominal surgeries are described below.


Complications of abdominal surgery include, but are not limited to:

Sterile technique, <a href="aseptic">aseptic</a> post-operative care, <a href="antibiotics">antibiotics</a>, use of the <a href="WHO%20Surgical%20Safety%20Checklist">WHO Surgical Safety Checklist</a>, and vigilant post-operative monitoring greatly reduce the risk of these complications. Planned surgery performed under sterile conditions is much less risky than that performed under emergency or unsterile conditions. The contents of the bowel are unsterile, and thus leakage of bowel contents, as from trauma, substantially increases the risk of infection.

Globally, there are few studies comparing <a href="perioperative%20mortality">perioperative mortality</a> following abdominal surgery across different health systems. One major prospective study of 10,745 adult patients undergoing emergency <a href="laparotomy">laparotomy</a> from 357 centres in 58 high-, middle-, and low-income countries found that mortality is three times higher in low- compared with high-HDI countries even when adjusted for prognostic factors. In this study the overall global mortality rate was 1·6 per cent at 24 hours (high 1·1 per cent, middle 1·9 per cent, low 3·4 per cent; P < 0·001), increasing to 5·4 per cent by 30 days (high 4·5 per cent, middle 6·0 per cent, low 8·6 per cent; P < 0·001). Of the 578 patients who died, 404 (69·9 per cent) did so between 24 h and 30 days following surgery (high 74·2 per cent, middle 68·8 per cent, low 60·5 per cent). Patient safety factors were suggested to play an important role, with use of the <a href="WHO%20Surgical%20Safety%20Checklist">WHO Surgical Safety Checklist</a> associated with reduced mortality at 30 days.

Taking a similar approach, a unique global study of 1,409 children undergoing emergency <a href="laparotomy">laparotomy</a> from 253 centres in 43 countries showed that adjusted mortality in children following surgery may be as high as 7 times greater in low-HDI and middle-HDI countries compared with high-HDI countries, translating to 40 excess deaths per 1000 procedures performed in these settings. Internationally, the most common operations performed were <a href="appendectomy">appendectomy</a>, <a href="small%20bowel%20resection">small bowel resection</a>, <a href="pyloromyotomy">pyloromyotomy</a> and correction of <a href="Intussusception%20%28medical%20disorder%29">intussusception</a>. After adjustment for patient and hospital risk factors, child mortality at 30 days was significantly higher in low-HDI (adjusted OR 7.14 (95% CI 2.52 to 20.23), p<0.001) and middle-HDI (4.42 (1.44 to 13.56), p=0.009) countries compared with high-HDI countries.

Abensberg

Abensberg () is a town in the <a href="Lower%20Bavaria">Lower Bavaria</a>n <a href="Districts%20of%20Germany">district</a> of <a href="Kelheim%20%28district%29">Kelheim</a>, in <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, lying around 30 km southwest of <a href="Regensburg">Regensburg</a>, 40 km east of <a href="Ingolstadt">Ingolstadt</a>, 50 northwest of <a href="Landshut">Landshut</a> and 100 km north of <a href="Munich">Munich</a>. It is situated on the <a href="Abens">Abens</a> river, a tributary of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>.

The town lies on the <a href="Abens">Abens</a> river, a tributary of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a>, around eight kilometres from the river's source. The area around Abensberg is characterized by the narrow valley of the Danube, where the <a href="Weltenburg%20Abbey">Weltenburg Abbey</a> stands, the valley of the <a href="Altm%C3%BChl">Altmühl</a> in the north, a left tributary of the Danube, and the famous <a href="Hallertau">Hallertau</a> <a href="Humulus">hops-planting</a> region in the south. The town is divided into the municipalities of Abensberg, Arnhofen, Holzharlanden, Hörlbach, Offenstetten, Pullach and Sandharland.

Since the administrative reforms in Bavaria in the 1970s, the town also encompasses the following "<a href="Quarter%20%28country%20subdivision%29">Ortsteile</a>":

There had been settlement on this part of the <a href="Abens">Abens</a> river since long before the <a href="High%20Middle%20Ages">High Middle Ages</a>, dating back to <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> times. Of particular interest and national importance are the Neolithic flint mines at Arnhofen, where, around 7,000 years ago, <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a> people made flint, which was fashioned into drills, blades and arrowheads, and was regarded as the steel of the Stone Age. Traces of over 20,000 individuals were found on this site. The modern history of Abensberg, which is often incorrectly compared with that of the 3rd century Roman <a href="castra">castra</a> (military outpost) of Abusina, begins with Gebhard, who was the first to mention Abensberg as a town, in the middle of the 12th century. The earliest written reference to the town, under the name of "Habensperch", came from this time, in around 1138. Gebhard was from the Babonen clan.

In 1256, the <a href="castrum">castrum</a> of "Abensprech" was first mentioned, and on 12 June 1348, Margrave Ludwig of <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a>, and his brother, Duke Stephen of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, raised Abensberg to the status of a city, giving it the right to operate lower courts, enclose itself with a wall and hold markets. The wall was built by Count Ulrich III of <a href="County%20of%20Abensberg">Abensberg</a>. Some of the thirty-two round towers and eight turrets are still preserved to this day.

In the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the people of Abensberg enjoyed a level of autonomy above their lord. They elected a city council, although only a small number of rich families were eligible for election.

In around 1390, the Carmelite Monastery of Our Lady of Abensberg was founded by Count John II and his wife, Agnes. Although Abensberg was an autonomous city, it remained dependent on the powerful <a href="List%20of%20rulers%20of%20Bavaria">Dukes of Bavaria</a>. The last Lord of Abensberg, <a href="Niclas%2C%20Graf%20von%20Abensberg">Niclas, Graf von Abensberg</a>, supposedly named after his godfather, <a href="Nicholas%20of%20Kues">Nicholas of Kues</a>, a Catholic cardinal, was murdered in 1485 by Christopher, a <a href="Herzog">Duke</a> of <a href="Bavaria-Munich">Bavaria-Munich</a>. The year before, Niclas had unchivalrously taken Christopher captive as he bathed before a tournament in Munich. Although Christopher renounced his claim for revenge, he lay in wait for Niclas in Freising. When the latter arrived, he was killed by Seitz von Frauenberg. He is buried in the former convent of Abensberg. 

Abensberg then lost its independence and became a part of the Duchy of Bavaria, and from then on was administered by a ducal official, the so-called caretaker. The castle of Abensberg was destroyed during the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>, although the city had bought a guarantee of protection from the Swedish general, <a href="Carl%20Gustaf%20Wrangel">Carl Gustaf Wrangel</a>. During the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a> emperor <a href="Leopold%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Leopold I</a>, who had occupied Bavaria, granted the fief of Abensberg to count Ernst von <a href="Abensberg-Traun">Abensperg und Traun</a> (1608–1668) from an Austrian noble family named Traun that now received the name of the former counts of Abensberg (who were believed to be distant relatives). After the occupation ended, he was however dispossessed. 

<a href="Johannes%20Aventinus">Johannes Aventinus</a> (1477–1534) is the city's most famous son, the founder of the study of history in Bavaria. Aventinus, whose name was real name is Johann or Johannes Turmair ("Aventinus" being the Latin name of his birthplace) wrote the "Annals of Bavaria", a valuable record of the early history of Germany and the first major written work on the subject. He is commemorated in the <a href="Walhalla%20temple">Walhalla temple</a>, a monument near <a href="Regensburg">Regensburg</a> to the distinguished figures of German history. Until 1800, Abensberg was a municipality belonging to the <a href="Straubing">Straubing</a> district of the <a href="Electorate%20of%20Bavaria">Electorate of Bavaria</a>. Abensberg also contained a magistrates' court. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Abensberg">Battle of Abensberg</a> on 19–20 April 1809, <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon</a> gained a significant victory over the Austrians under Archduke <a href="Archduke%20Louis%20of%20Austria">Ludwig</a> of <a href="Archduchy%20of%20Austria">Austria</a> and General <a href="Johann%20von%20Hiller">Johann von Hiller</a>.

The arms of the city are divided into two halves. On the left are the blue and white rhombuses of Bavaria, while the right half is split into two silver and black triangles. Two diagonally-crossed silver swords with golden handles rest on top.

The town has had a coat of arms since 1338, that of the Counts of Abensberg. With the death of the last Count, Nicholas of Abensberg, in 1485, the estates fell to the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Bavaria-Munich">Duchy of Bavaria-Munich</a>, meaning that henceforth only the Bavarian coat of arms was ever used.

On 31 December 1809, a decree of <a href="Maximilian%20I%20Joseph%20of%20Bavaria">King Maximilian</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria">Bavaria</a> granted the city a new coat of arms, as a recognition of their (mainly humanitarian and logistic) services in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Abensberg">Battle of Abensberg</a> the same year. The diagonally divided field in silver and black came from the old crest of the Counts of Abensberg, while the white and blue diamonds came from that of the <a href="House%20of%20Wittelsbach">House of Wittelsbach</a>, the rulers of Bavaria. The swords recall the Battle of Abensberg.

The district of Offenstetten previously possessed its own coat of arms.


The area around Abensberg, the so-called sand belt between <a href="Siegburg">Siegburg</a>, <a href="Neustadt%20an%20der%20Donau">Neustadt an der Donau</a>, Abensberg and <a href="Langquaid">Langquaid</a>, is used for the intensive farming of <a href="asparagus">asparagus</a>, due to the optimal soil condition and climate. 212 hectares of land can produce ninety-four asparagus plants. Abensberg asparagus enjoys a reputation among connoisseurs as a particular delicacy. In addition to asparagus, the production of hops plays a major role locally, the region having its own label, and there are still three independent breweries in the area. The town of Abensberg marks the start of the "Deutsche Hopfenstraße" ("German Hops Road"), a nickname given to the <a href="Bundesstra%C3%9Fe">Bundesstraße</a> 301, a German federal highway which runs through the heartland of Germany's hops-growing industry, ending in <a href="Freising">Freising</a>.

The Abensberg railway station is located on the <a href="Danube%20Valley%20Railway%20%28Bavaria%29">Danube Valley Railway</a> from <a href="Regensburg%20Hauptbahnhof">Regensburg</a> to <a href="Ingolstadt%20Hauptbahnhof">Ingolstadt</a>. The city can be reached via the A-93 Holledau-Regensburg road (exit Abensberg). Three <a href="Bundesstra%C3%9Fe">Bundesstraße</a> (German federal highways) cross south of Abensberg: <a href="Bundesstra%C3%9Fe%2016">B 16</a>, <a href="Bundesstra%C3%9Fe%20299">B 299</a> and B 301.

Abensberg has a Grundschule (primary school) and <a href="Hauptschule">Hauptschule</a> (open admission secondary school), and the Johann-Turmair-<a href="Realschule">Realschule</a>(secondary modern school). There is also a College of Agriculture and Home Economics. Since 2007, the Kelheim Berufsschule has had a campus in Abensberg, and outside the state sector is the St. Francis Vocational Training Centre, run by a Catholic youth organisation.

In 2008, a former <a href="goods%20shed">goods shed</a> by the main railway station of Abensberg was converted into a theatre by local volunteers. The "Theater am Bahnhof" ("Theatre at the Railway Station") is mostly used by the "Theatergruppe Lampenfieber" and was opened on 19 October 2008.

Abensberg has a long tradition of museums. In the nineteenth century, Nicholas Stark und Peter Paul Dollinger began a collection based on local history. This collection and the collection of the "Heimatverein" (local history society) were united in 1963 into the <a href="Johannes%20Aventinus">Aventinus</a> Museum, in the cloister of the former Carmelite monastery. On 7 July 2006, the new Town Museum of Abensberg was opened in the former duke's castle in the town.

Two blocks west of the Old Town is the Kuchlbauer Brewery and beer garden featuring the <a href="Kuchlbauer%20Tower">Kuchlbauer Tower</a>, a colorful and unconventional observation tower designed by Viennese architect <a href="Friedensreich%20Hundertwasser">Friedensreich Hundertwasser</a>. The brewery and tower are open to the public.

Up until the 1950s, Abensberg and the surrounding villages contained a number of graves of victims of a <a href="Death%20marches%20%28Holocaust%29">Death March</a> in the Spring of 1945 from the Hersbruck sub-camp of the <a href="Dachau%20concentration%20camp">Dachau concentration camp</a>, who were either murdered by the <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> or died of exhaustion. They were originally buried where they died, but were later moved on the orders of the US military government to the cemeteries of their previous homes. At the cemetery in what is now the district of <a href="Pullach">Pullach</a> stood a memorial stone which was mentioned as recently as 1967, but which is no longer at the site. The suffering of ten unknown victims of the camp was recorded on the stone.

Arminianism

Arminianism is based on <a href="Christian%20theology">theological</a> ideas of the <a href="Dutch%20Reformed">Dutch Reformed</a> theologian <a href="Jacobus%20Arminius">Jacobus Arminius</a> (1560–1609) and his historic supporters known as <a href="Remonstrants">Remonstrants</a>. His teachings held to the <a href="five%20solae">five solae</a> of the Reformation, but they were distinct from particular teachings of <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>, <a href="Huldrych%20Zwingli">Huldrych Zwingli</a>, <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>, and other <a href="Protestant%20Reformers">Protestant Reformers</a>. Jacobus Arminius (Jakob Harmenszoon) was a student of <a href="Theodore%20Beza">Theodore Beza</a> (Calvin's successor) at the Theological University of Geneva. Arminianism is known to some as a <a href="soteriological">soteriological</a> diversification of <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a href="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>. However, to others, Arminianism is a reclamation of early Church theological consensus.

Dutch Arminianism was originally articulated in the Remonstrance (1610), a theological statement signed by 45 ministers and submitted to the <a href="States%20General%20of%20the%20Netherlands">States General of the Netherlands</a>. The <a href="Synod%20of%20Dort">Synod of Dort</a> (1618–19) was called by the States General to consider the <a href="Five%20Articles%20of%20Remonstrance">Five Articles of Remonstrance</a>. These articles asserted that


"These points", note Keith D. Stanglin and Thomas H. McCall, "are consistent with the views of Arminius; indeed, some come verbatim from his "Declaration of Sentiments". Those who signed this remonstrance and others who supported its theology have since been known as <a href="Remonstrants">Remonstrants</a>."

Many Christian denominations have been influenced by Arminian views on the will of man being freed by grace prior to regeneration, notably the <a href="Baptists">Baptists</a> in the 16th century, the <a href="Methodists">Methodists</a> in the 18th century and the <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a> in the 19th century. Some falsely assert that <a href="Universalists">Universalists</a> and <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarians</a> in the 18th and 19th centuries were theologically linked with Arminianism. Denominations such as the <a href="Anabaptists">Anabaptists</a> (beginning in 1525), <a href="Waldensians">Waldensians</a> (pre-Reformation), and other groups prior to the Reformation have also affirmed that each person may choose the contingent response of either resisting God's grace or yielding to it.

The original beliefs of Jacobus Arminius himself are commonly defined as Arminianism, but more broadly, the term may embrace the teachings of <a href="Hugo%20Grotius">Hugo Grotius</a>, <a href="John%20Wesley">John Wesley</a>, and others as well. <a href="Arminianism%23Classical%20Arminianism">Classical Arminianism</a>, to which Arminius is the main contributor, and <a href="Arminianism%23Wesleyan%20Arminianism">Wesleyan Arminianism</a>, to which John Wesley is the main contributor, are the two main schools of thought. Wesleyan Arminianism is often identical with Methodism. Some schools of thought, notably <a href="Semipelagianism">Semipelagianism</a>—which teaches that the first step of salvation is by human will,—are confused as being Arminian in nature. But classical Arminianism holds that the first step of salvation is solely the grace of God. Historically, the <a href="Council%20of%20Orange%20%28529%29">Council of Orange (529)</a> condemned semi-Pelagian thought (as well as <a href="Supralapsarian">Supralapsarian</a> Calvinism), and is accepted by some as a document which can be understood as teaching a doctrine between <a href="Augustinian">Augustinian</a> thought and semi-Pelagian thought, relegating Arminianism to the orthodoxy of the early Church fathers.

The two systems of Calvinism and Arminianism share both history and many doctrines, and the <a href="History%20of%20Christianity">history of Christian theology</a>. Arminianism is related to <a href="Calvinism">Calvinism</a> historically. However, because of their differences over the doctrines of divine <a href="predestination">predestination</a> and election, many people view these schools of thought as opposed to each other. The distinction is whether God allows His desire to save all to be resisted by an individual's will (in the Arminian doctrine) or if God's grace is irresistible and limited to only some (in Calvinism). Put another way, is God's sovereignty shown, in part, through His allowance of free decisions? Some Calvinists assert that the Arminian perspective presents a synergistic system of Salvation and therefore is not only by grace, while Arminians firmly reject this conclusion. Many consider the theological differences to be crucial differences in doctrine, while others find them to be relatively minor.

Jacobus Arminius was a Dutch pastor and theologian in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. He was taught by <a href="Theodore%20Beza">Theodore Beza</a>, <a href="John%20Calvin">Calvin's</a> hand-picked successor, but after examination of the scriptures, he rejected his teacher's theology that it is God who unconditionally elects some for salvation. Instead Arminius proposed that the election of God was "of believers", thereby making it <a href="Conditional%20election">conditional on faith</a>. Arminius's views were challenged by the Dutch Calvinists, especially <a href="Franciscus%20Gomarus">Franciscus Gomarus</a>, but Arminius died before a national synod could occur.

Arminius's followers, not wanting to adopt their leader's name, called themselves the <a href="Remonstrants">Remonstrants</a>. When Arminius died before he could satisfy Holland's State General's request for a 14-page paper outlining his views, the Remonstrants replied in his stead crafting the <a href="Five%20articles%20of%20Remonstrance">Five articles of Remonstrance</a>. After some political maneuvering, the Dutch Calvinists were able to convince <a href="Maurice%20de%20Nassau">Prince Maurice of Nassau</a> to deal with the situation. Maurice systematically removed Arminian magistrates from office and called a national synod at Dordrecht. This <a href="Synod%20of%20Dort">Synod of Dort</a> was open primarily to Dutch Calvinists (Arminians were excluded) with Calvinist representatives from other countries, and in 1618 published a condemnation of Arminius and his followers as heretics. Part of this publication was the famous <a href="Five%20points%20of%20Calvinism">Five points of Calvinism</a> in response to the five articles of Remonstrance.

Arminians across Holland were removed from office, imprisoned, banished, and sworn to silence. Twelve years later Holland officially granted Arminianism protection as a religion, although animosity between Arminians and Calvinists continued.
The debate between Calvin's followers and Arminius's followers is distinctive of post-Reformation church history. The emerging Baptist movement in 17th-century England, for example, was a microcosm of the historic debate between Calvinists and Arminians. The first Baptists–called "<a href="General%20Baptists">General Baptists</a>" because of their confession of a "general" or unlimited atonement, were Arminians. The Baptist movement originated with <a href="Thomas%20Helwys">Thomas Helwys</a>, who left his mentor John Smyth (who had moved into shared belief and other distinctives of the Dutch Waterlander Mennonites of Amsterdam) and returned to London to start the first English Baptist Church in 1611. Later General Baptists such as John Griffith, Samuel Loveday, and <a href="Thomas%20Grantham%20%28Baptist%29">Thomas Grantham</a> defended a Reformed Arminian theology that reflected more the Arminianism of Arminius than that of the later Remonstrants or the English Arminianism of Arminian <a href="Puritans">Puritans</a> like John Goodwin or Anglican Arminians such as <a href="Jeremy%20Taylor">Jeremy Taylor</a> and <a href="Henry%20Hammond">Henry Hammond</a>. The General Baptists encapsulated their Arminian views in numerous confessions, the most influential of which was the Standard Confession of 1660. In the 1640s the Particular Baptists were formed, diverging strongly from Arminian doctrine and embracing the strong Calvinism of the Presbyterians and Independents. Their robust Calvinism was publicized in such confessions as the London Baptist Confession of 1644 and the Second London Confession of 1689. Interestingly, the London Confession of 1689 was later used by Calvinistic Baptists in America (called the Philadelphia Baptist Confession), whereas the Standard Confession of 1660 was used by the American heirs of the English General Baptists, who soon came to be known as <a href="Free%20Will%20Baptists">Free Will Baptists</a>.
This same dynamic between Arminianism and <a href="Calvinism">Calvinism</a> can be seen in the heated discussions between friends and fellow <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> ministers <a href="John%20Wesley">John Wesley</a> and <a href="George%20Whitefield">George Whitefield</a>. Wesley was a champion of Arminian teachings, defending his <a href="soteriology">soteriology</a> in a periodical titled "The Arminian" and writing articles such as "Predestination Calmly Considered". He defended Arminianism against charges of <a href="semi-Pelagianism">semi-Pelagianism</a>, holding strongly to beliefs in <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a> and total depravity. At the same time, Wesley attacked the <a href="determinism">determinism</a> that he claimed characterized unconditional election and maintained a belief in the <a href="Conditional%20Preservation%20of%20the%20Saints">ability to lose salvation</a>. Wesley also clarified the doctrine of <a href="prevenient%20grace">prevenient grace</a> and preached the ability of Christians to attain to <a href="Christian%20perfection">perfection</a> (fully mature, not "sinlessness"). While Wesley freely made use of the term "Arminian," he did not self-consciously root his soteriology in the theology of Arminius but was highly influenced by 17th-century English Arminianism and thinkers such as <a href="John%20Goodwin%20%28preacher%29">John Goodwin</a>, <a href="Jeremy%20Taylor">Jeremy Taylor</a> and <a href="Henry%20Hammond">Henry Hammond</a> of the Anglican "Holy Living" school, and the Remonstrant <a href="Hugo%20Grotius">Hugo Grotius</a>.

Advocates of both Arminianism and Calvinism find a home in many Protestant denominations, and sometimes both exist within the same denomination. Faiths leaning at least in part in the Arminian direction include <a href="Methodism">Methodists</a>, <a href="Free%20Will%20Baptist">Free Will Baptist</a>s, <a href="Christian%20Churches%20and%20Churches%20of%20Christ">Christian Churches and Churches of Christ</a>, <a href="General%20Baptist">General Baptist</a>s, the <a href="Seventh-day%20Adventist%20Church">Seventh-day Adventist Church</a>, <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Nazarene">Church of the Nazarene</a>, <a href="The%20Wesleyan%20Church">The Wesleyan Church</a>, <a href="The%20Salvation%20Army">The Salvation Army</a>, <a href="Conservative%20Mennonites">Conservative Mennonites</a>, <a href="Old%20Order%20Mennonites">Old Order Mennonites</a>, <a href="Amish">Amish</a> and <a href="Charismatic%20Christianity">Charismatics</a>. Denominations leaning in the Calvinist direction are grouped as the <a href="Reformed%20churches">Reformed churches</a> and include <a href="Particular%20Baptist">Particular Baptist</a>s, <a href="Reformed%20Baptist">Reformed Baptist</a>s, <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a>s, and <a href="Congregational%20church">Congregationalists</a>. The majority of <a href="Southern%20Baptists">Southern Baptists</a>, including <a href="Billy%20Graham%20%28evangelist%29">Billy Graham</a>, accept Arminianism with an exception allowing for a doctrine of <a href="perseverance%20of%20the%20saints">perseverance of the saints</a> ("eternal security"). Many see Calvinism as growing in acceptance, and some prominent Reformed Baptists, such as <a href="Albert%20Mohler">Albert Mohler</a> and <a href="Mark%20Dever">Mark Dever</a>, have been pushing for the <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a> to adopt a more Calvinistic orientation (it should be noted, however, that no Baptist church is bound by any resolution adopted by the Southern Baptist Convention). <a href="Lutheranism">Lutherans</a> espouse a view of salvation and election distinct from both the Calvinist and Arminian schools of <a href="soteriology">soteriology</a>.

The current scholarly support for Arminianism is wide and varied. One particular thrust is a return to the teachings of Arminius. F. Leroy Forlines, Robert Picirilli, Stephen Ashby and Matthew Pinson (see citations) are four of the more prominent supporters. Forlines has referred to this type of Arminianism as "Classical Arminianism," while Picirilli, Pinson, and Ashby have termed it "Reformation Arminianism" or "Reformed Arminianism." Through <a href="Methodism">Methodism</a>, Wesley's teachings also inspire a large scholarly following, with vocal proponents including <a href="J.%20Kenneth%20Grider">J. Kenneth Grider</a>, <a href="Stanley%20Hauerwas">Stanley Hauerwas</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Oden">Thomas Oden</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Jay%20Oord">Thomas Jay Oord</a>, and <a href="William%20Willimon">William Willimon</a>.

Recent influence of the <a href="New%20Perspective%20on%20Paul">New Perspective on Paul</a> movement has also reached Arminianism — primarily through a view of corporate election. The New Perspective scholars propose that the 1st-century <a href="Second%20Temple%20Judaism">Second Temple Judaism</a> understood election primarily as national (<a href="Israelites">Israelites</a>) and racial (<a href="Jews">Jews</a>), not as individual. Their conclusion is thus that Paul's writings on election should be interpreted in a similar corporate light.

Arminian theology usually falls into one of two groups — Classical Arminianism, drawn from the teaching of Jacobus Arminius — and Wesleyan Arminian, drawing primarily from Wesley. Both groups overlap substantially.

Classical Arminianism is the theological system that was presented by <a href="Jacobus%20Arminius">Jacobus Arminius</a> and maintained by some of the <a href="Remonstrants">Remonstrants</a>; its influence serves as the foundation for all Arminian systems. A list of beliefs is given below:


On whether a believer could commit apostasy (i.e., desert Christ by cleaving again to this evil world, losing a good conscience, or by failing to hold on to sound doctrine), Arminius declared that this matter required further study in the Scriptures. Nevertheless, Arminius believed the Scriptures taught that believers are graciously empowered by Christ and the Holy Spirit "to fight against Satan, sin, the world and their own flesh, and to gain the victory over these enemies." Furthermore, Christ and the Spirit are ever present to aid and assist believers through various temptations. But this security was not unconditional but conditional—"provided they [believers] stand prepared for the battle, implore his help, and be not wanting to themselves, Christ preserves them from falling." Arminius goes on to say, "I never taught that a true believer can, either totally or finally fall away from the faith, and perish; yet I will not conceal, that there are passages of scripture which seem to me to wear this aspect; and those answers to them which I have been permitted to see, are not of such a kind as to approve themselves on all points to my understanding."

After the death of Arminius in 1609, the Remonstrants maintained their leader's view on conditional security and his uncertainty regarding the possibility of believers committing apostasy. This is evidenced in the fifth article drafted by its leaders in 1610. However, sometime between 1610, and the official proceeding of the Synod of Dort (1618), the <a href="Remonstrants">Remonstrants</a> became fully persuaded in their minds that the Scriptures taught that a true believer was capable of falling away from faith and perishing eternally as an unbeliever. They formalized their views in "The Opinion of the Remonstrants" (1618).

Picirilli remarks: "Ever since that early period, then, when the issue was being examined again, Arminians have taught that those who are truly saved need to be warned against apostasy as a real and possible danger."

The core beliefs of Jacobus Arminius and the Remonstrants are summarized as such by theologian Stephen Ashby:


John Wesley has historically been the most influential advocate for the teachings of Arminian soteriology. Wesley thoroughly agreed with the vast majority of what Arminius himself taught, maintaining strong doctrines of original sin, total depravity, conditional election, prevenient grace, unlimited atonement, and possibly of apostasy.

Wesley departs from Classical Arminianism primarily on three issues:

Since the time of Arminius, his name has come to represent a very large variety of beliefs. Some of these beliefs, such as Pelagianism and semi-Pelagianism (see <a href="Arminianism%23Pelagianism">below</a>) are not considered to be within Arminian orthodoxy and are dealt with elsewhere. Some doctrines, however, do adhere to the Arminian foundation and, while minority views, are highlighted below.

The doctrine of open theism states that God is omnipresent, omnipotent, and omniscient, but differs on the nature of the future. Open theists claim that the future is not completely determined (or "settled") because people have not made their free decisions yet. God therefore knows the future partially in possibilities (human free actions) rather than solely certainties (divinely determined events). As such, open theists resolve the issue of human <a href="free%20will">free will</a> and God's sovereignty by claiming that God is sovereign because he does not ordain each human choice, but rather works in cooperation with his creation to bring about his will. This notion of sovereignty and freedom is foundational to their understanding of <a href="love">love</a> since open theists believe that love is not genuine unless it is freely chosen. The power of choice under this definition has the potential for as much harm as it does good, and open theists see free will as the best answer to the <a href="problem%20of%20evil">problem of evil</a>. Well-known proponents of this theology are <a href="Gregory%20A.%20Boyd">Greg Boyd</a>, <a href="Clark%20Pinnock">Clark Pinnock</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Jay%20Oord">Thomas Jay Oord</a>, <a href="William%20Hasker">William Hasker</a>, and <a href="John%20E.%20Sanders">John E. Sanders</a>.

Some Arminians, such as professor and theologian Robert Picirilli, reject the doctrine of open theism as a "deformed Arminianism". Joseph Dongell stated that "open theism actually moves beyond classical Arminianism towards <a href="process%20theology">process theology</a>." There are also some Arminians, like Roger Olson, who believe Open theism to be an alternative view that a Christian can have. The majority Arminian view accepts <a href="Classical%20Theism">classical theism</a> – the belief that God's power, knowledge, and presence have no external limitations, that is, outside of his divine nature. Most Arminians reconcile human free will with God's sovereignty and foreknowledge by holding three points:

The majority Arminian view is that election is individual and based on God's foreknowledge of faith, but a second perspective deserves mention. These Arminians reject the concept of individual election entirely, preferring to understand the doctrine in corporate terms. According to this corporate election, God never chose individuals to elect to salvation, but rather He chose to elect the believing church to salvation. Dutch Reformed theologian Herman Ridderbos says "[The certainty of salvation] does not rest on the fact that the church belongs to a certain "number", but that it belongs to Christ, from before the foundation of the world. Fixity does not lie in a hidden decree, therefore, but in corporate unity of the Church with Christ, whom it has come to know in the gospel and has learned to embrace in faith."

Corporate election draws support from a similar concept of corporate election found in the Old Testament and Jewish law. Indeed most biblical scholarship is in agreement that Judeo-Greco-Roman thought in the 1st century was opposite of the Western world's "individual first" mantra – it was very collectivist or communitarian in nature. Identity stemmed from membership in a group more than individuality. According to Romans 9–11, supporters claim, Jewish election as the chosen people ceased with their national rejection of Jesus as Messiah. As a result of the new covenant, God's chosen people are now the corporate body of Christ, the church (sometimes called "spiritual Israel" – see also <a href="Covenant%20theology">Covenant theology</a>). The pastor and theologian Brian Abasciano claims "What Paul says about Jews, Gentiles, and Christians, whether of their place in God’s plan, or their election, or their salvation, or how they should think or behave, he says from a corporate perspective which views the group as primary and those he speaks about as embedded in the group. These individuals act as members of the group to which they belong, and what happens to them happens by virtue of their membership in the group."

These scholars also maintain that Jesus was the only human ever elected and that individuals must be "in Christ" (Eph 1:3–4) through faith to be part of the elect. This was, in fact, Swiss Reformed theologian, <a href="Karl%20Barth">Karl Barth</a>'s, understanding of the doctrine of election. Joseph Dongell, professor at Asbury Theological Seminary, states "the most conspicuous feature of Ephesians 1:3–2:10 is the phrase 'in Christ', which occurs twelve times in Ephesians 1:3–14 alone...this means that Jesus Christ himself is the chosen one, the predestined one. Whenever one is incorporated into him by grace through faith, one comes to share in Jesus' special status as chosen of God." Markus Barth illustrates the inter-connectedness: "Election in Christ must be understood as the election of God's people. Only as members of that community do individuals share in the benefits of God's gracious choice."

Understanding Arminianism is aided by understanding the theological alternatives: <a href="Pelagianism">Pelagianism</a>, <a href="Semi-Pelagianism">Semi-Pelagianism</a>, <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a>, and <a href="Calvinism">Calvinism</a>. Arminianism, like any major belief system, is frequently misunderstood both by critics and would-be supporters.

Arminian beliefs compared to other Protestants.


Many Calvinist critics of Arminianism, both historically and currently, claim that Arminianism condones, accepts, or even explicitly supports Pelagianism or Semi-Pelagianism. Arminius referred to Pelagianism as "the grand falsehood" and stated that he "must confess that I detest, from my heart, the consequences [of that theology]." David Pawson, a British pastor, decries this association as "libelous" when attributed to Arminius' or Wesley's doctrine. Indeed, most Arminians reject all accusations of Pelagianism; nonetheless, primarily due to Calvinist opponents, the two terms remain intertwined in popular usage.


Ever since Arminius and his followers revolted against Calvinism in the early 17th century, Protestant soteriology has been largely divided between Calvinism and Arminianism. The extreme of Calvinism is <a href="hyper-Calvinism">hyper-Calvinism</a>, which insists that signs of election must be sought before evangelization of the unregenerate takes place and that the eternally damned have no obligation to repent and believe, and on the extreme of Arminianism is <a href="Pelagianism">Pelagianism</a>, which rejects the doctrine of original sin on grounds of moral accountability; but the overwhelming majority of <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a>, <a href="Evangelicalism">evangelical</a> pastors and theologians hold to one of these two systems or somewhere in between.

The Alan Parsons Project

The Alan Parsons Project was the collective reference to several lineups of a British <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> team, active between 1975 and 1990, whose rosters consisted of <a href="Alan%20Parsons">Alan Parsons</a> and <a href="Eric%20Woolfson">Eric Woolfson</a> surrounded by a varying number of session musicians and some relatively consistent band members such as guitarist <a href="Ian%20Bairnson">Ian Bairnson</a>, arranger <a href="Andrew%20Powell">Andrew Powell</a>, bassist and vocalist <a href="David%20Paton">David Paton</a>, drummer <a href="Stuart%20Elliott%20%28drummer%29">Stuart Elliott</a>, and vocalist <a href="Lenny%20Zakatek">Lenny Zakatek</a>.

Behind the revolving line-up and the regular sidemen, the true core of the Project was the duo of Parsons and Woolfson. Parsons was an audio engineer and producer by profession, but also a musician and a composer. A songwriter by profession, Woolfson was also a composer, a pianist, and a singer. Almost all songs on the Project's albums are credited to "Woolfson/Parsons".

<a href="Alan%20Parsons">Alan Parsons</a> met <a href="Eric%20Woolfson">Eric Woolfson</a> in the <a href="Canteen%20%28place%29">canteen</a> of <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a> in the summer of 1974. Parsons had already acted as Assistant Engineer on <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>' albums "<a href="Abbey%20Road">Abbey Road</a>" (1969) and "<a href="Let%20It%20Be%20%28The%20Beatles%20album%29">Let It Be</a>" (1970), had recently engineered <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s "<a href="The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a>" (1973), and had produced several acts for <a href="EMI%20Records">EMI Records</a>. Woolfson, a songwriter and composer, was working as a session pianist; he had also composed material for a concept album idea based on the work of <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>.

When Parsons asked Woolfson to become his manager, he accepted and subsequently managed Parsons's career as a producer and engineer through a string of successes, including <a href="Pilot%20%28band%29">Pilot</a>, <a href="Steve%20Harley">Steve Harley</a>, <a href="Cockney%20Rebel">Cockney Rebel</a>, <a href="John%20Miles%20%28musician%29">John Miles</a>, <a href="Al%20Stewart">Al Stewart</a>, <a href="Ambrosia%20%28band%29">Ambrosia</a>, and <a href="the%20Hollies">the Hollies</a>. Parsons commented at the time that he felt frustrated in having to accommodate the views of some of the musicians, which he felt interfered with his production. Woolfson came up with the idea of making an album based on developments in the <a href="film%20industry">film industry</a>, where directors, such as <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> and <a href="Stanley%20Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>, were the focal point of the film's promotion, rather than individual film stars. If the film industry was becoming a director's medium, Woolfson felt the music business might well become a producer's medium.

Recalling his earlier Edgar Allan Poe material, Woolfson saw a way to combine his and Parsons's respective talents. Parsons would produce and engineer songs written and composed by the two, and the first Alan Parsons Project was begun. The Project's first album, "<a href="Tales%20of%20Mystery%20and%20Imagination%20%28Alan%20Parsons%20Project%20album%29">Tales of Mystery and Imagination</a>" (1976), which was released by <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox%20Records">20th Century Fox Records</a> and included major contributions by all members of <a href="Pilot%20%28band%29">Pilot</a> and <a href="Ambrosia%20%28band%29">Ambrosia</a>, was a success, reaching the <a href="Top%2040">Top 40</a> in the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> <a href="record%20chart">chart</a>. The song "<a href="The%20Raven%20%28song%29">The Raven</a>" featured lead vocals by the actor <a href="Leonard%20Whiting">Leonard Whiting</a>, and, according to the 2007 remastered album liner notes, was the first rock song to use a <a href="Digital%20data">digital</a> <a href="vocoder">vocoder</a>, with Alan Parsons speaking <a href="lyrics">lyrics</a> through it.

An unauthorised history of the Alan Parsons Projects was released as an English language book in December 2016, when "The Alan Parsons Project — The Eye in the Sky", written by Francesco Ferrua, was published by Arcana. It is a translation of the book, from the same author, originally published in March 2015 in the Italian language.

<a href="Arista%20Records">Arista Records</a> then signed the Alan Parsons Project participants for further albums. Through the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Project's popularity continued to grow. (However, the Project was always more popular in North America, Ibero-America, and <a href="Continental%20Europe">Continental Europe</a> than in Parsons's home country, never achieving a UK Top 40 single or Top 20 album). The <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a> "<a href="I%20Wouldn%27t%20Want%20to%20Be%20Like%20You">I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You</a>", "<a href="Games%20People%20Play%20%28Alan%20Parsons%20Project%20song%29">Games People Play</a>", "Damned If I Do", "Time", the first single to feature Woolfson's lead vocal, and "<a href="Eye%20in%20the%20Sky%20%28song%29">Eye in the Sky</a>" had a notable impact on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>. "<a href="Don%27t%20Answer%20Me">Don't Answer Me</a>" became the Project's last successful single in the United States; it reached the top 15 on the American charts in 1984. After those successes, however, the Project began to fade from view. There were fewer hit singles, and declining album sales. 1987's "<a href="Gaudi%20%28The%20Alan%20Parsons%20Project%20album%29">Gaudi</a>" would be the Project's final release, though it had planned to record an album called "<a href="Freudiana">Freudiana</a>" (1990) next.

Even though the studio version of "Freudiana" was produced by Parsons (and featured the regular Project backing musicians, making it an 'unofficial' Project album), it was primarily Woolfson's idea to turn it into a musical. This eventually led to a rift between the two artists. While Parsons pursued his own solo career and took many members of the Project on the road for the first time in a successful worldwide tour, Woolfson went on to produce musical plays influenced by the Project's music. "<a href="Freudiana">Freudiana</a>", "Gaudi", and "Gambler" were three musicals that included some Project songs like "Eye in the Sky", "Time", "Inside Looking Out", and "Limelight". The live music from "Gambler" was only distributed at the performance site in <a href="M%C3%B6nchengladbach">Mönchengladbach</a>, Germany.

In 1981, Parsons, Woolfson, and their <a href="record%20label">record label</a> Arista, had been stalled in contract renegotiations when on March 5, the two submitted an all-instrumental album tentatively titled 'The Sicilian Defence', named after an <a href="Sicilian%20Defence">aggressive opening move</a> in chess, arguably to get out of their <a href="recording%20contract">recording contract</a>. Arista's refusal to release the album had two known effects: the negotiations led to a renewed contract, and the album was not released at that time.

In interviews he gave before his death in 2009, Woolfson said he planned to release one track from the "Sicilian" album, which in 2008 appeared as a bonus track on a CD re-issue of the "<a href="Eve%20%28The%20Alan%20Parsons%20Project%20album%29">Eve</a>" album. Sometime later, after he had relocated the original tapes, Parsons had changed his mind about the album and announced that it would finally be released on an upcoming Project box set called "The Complete Albums Collection" in 2014 for the first time as a bonus disc.

Parsons released titles under his name; these were "<a href="Try%20Anything%20Once">Try Anything Once</a>" (1993), "<a href="On%20Air%20%28Alan%20Parsons%20album%29">On Air</a>" (1996), "<a href="The%20Time%20Machine%20%28Alan%20Parsons%20album%29">The Time Machine</a>" (1999), and "<a href="A%20Valid%20Path">A Valid Path</a>" (2004). Meanwhile, Woolfson made <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a>s titled "<a href="Freudiana">Freudiana</a>" (1990), about <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>'s work on <a href="psychology">psychology</a>, and "" (2003); this continued from the Alan Parsons Project's first album about Edgar Allan Poe's literature.

"Tales of Mystery and Imagination" (1976) was first <a href="remix">remix</a>ed in 1987 for release on CD, and included narration by <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a> which had been recorded in 1975, but arrived too late to be included on the original album. On the 2007 deluxe edition release, it is revealed that parts of this tape were used for the 1976 Griffith Park Planetarium launch of the original album, the 1987 remix, and various radio spots, all of which were included as bonus material.

Most of the Project's titles, especially the early work, share common traits; these were likely influenced by <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s "<a href="The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a>" (1973), on which Parsons was the <a href="audio%20engineer">audio engineer</a> in 1973. They were <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a>s and typically began with an <a href="instrumental">instrumental</a> introduction, which faded into the first song, often had an instrumental piece in the middle of the second <a href="gramophone%20record">LP</a> side, and concluded with a quiet, melancholic, or powerful song. The opening instrumental was largely done away with by 1980; no later Project album except "<a href="Eye%20in%20the%20Sky%20%28album%29">Eye in the Sky</a>" (1982) featured one, though every album includes at least one instrumental somewhere in the running order. The instrumental on that album, "<a href="Sirius%20%28instrumental%29">Sirius</a>", eventually became the best-known, or, at least, the most frequently heard, of all Parsons instrumentals. It was used as entrance music by various American sports teams, most notably by the <a href="Chicago%20Bulls">Chicago Bulls</a> during their 1990s <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">NBA</a> <a href="dynasty%20%28sports%29">dynasty</a>. It was also used as the entrance theme for <a href="Ricky%20Steamboat">Ricky Steamboat</a> in pro wrestling of the mid-1980s. In addition, "Sirius" has been played in a variety of TV shows and movies including the episode "Vanishing Act" of "" and the 2009 film "<a href="Cloudy%20with%20a%20Chance%20of%20Meatballs%20%28film%29">Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs</a>".

The group was notable for using several vocal performers instead of having a single lead vocalist. Lead vocal duties were shared by guest vocalists chosen by their vocal style to complement each song. In later years, Woolfson sang lead on many of the group's hits, including "Time", "Eye in the Sky", and "Don't Answer Me"; however, he did not sing any lead vocals on the band's first four albums and appeared as vocalist only sporadically thereafter. When the Woolfson-sung songs became significant hits, the record company pressured Parsons to use him more. However, Parsons preferred to use more technically polished and proficient singers, which Woolfson admitted he was not. In addition to Woolfson, vocalists <a href="Chris%20Rainbow">Chris Rainbow</a>, <a href="Lenny%20Zakatek">Lenny Zakatek</a>, <a href="John%20Miles%20%28musician%29">John Miles</a>, <a href="David%20Paton">David Paton</a>, and <a href="the%20Zombies">the Zombies</a>'s <a href="Colin%20Blunstone">Colin Blunstone</a> made regular appearances. Other singers, such as <a href="Arthur%20Brown%20%28musician%29">Arthur Brown</a>, Steve Harley, <a href="Procol%20Harum">Procol Harum</a>'s <a href="Gary%20Brooker">Gary Brooker</a>, <a href="Elmer%20Gantry%E2%80%99s%20Velvet%20Opera">Dave Terry a.k.a. Elmer Gantry</a>, <a href="Vitamin%20Z">Vitamin Z</a>'s Geoff Barradale, and <a href="Marmalade%20%28band%29">Marmalade</a>'s Dean Ford, have recorded only once or twice with the Project. Parsons himself only sang lead on one song ("<a href="The%20Raven%20%28song%29">The Raven</a>") through a <a href="vocoder">vocoder</a> and can be heard singing backing vocals on a few others, including "To One in Paradise". Both of those songs appeared on "<a href="Tales%20of%20Mystery%20and%20Imagination%20%28Alan%20Parsons%20Project%20album%29">Tales of Mystery and Imagination</a>" (1976).

Although the vocalists varied, a small number of musicians worked with the Alan Parsons Project regularly. These core musicians contributed to the recognisable style of a Project song in spite of the varied singer line-up. Together with Parsons and Woolfson, the Project originally consisted of the group <a href="Pilot%20%28band%29">Pilot</a>, with <a href="Ian%20Bairnson">Ian Bairnson</a> (guitar), <a href="David%20Paton">David Paton</a> (bass) and <a href="Stuart%20Tosh">Stuart Tosh</a> (drums). Pilot's keyboardist <a href="Billy%20Lyall">Billy Lyall</a> also contributed. From "<a href="Pyramid%20%28The%20Alan%20Parsons%20Project%20album%29">Pyramid</a>" (1978) onwards, Tosh was replaced by <a href="Stuart%20Elliott%20%28drummer%29">Stuart Elliott</a> of <a href="Cockney%20Rebel">Cockney Rebel</a>. Bairnson played on all albums, and Paton stayed almost until the end. <a href="Andrew%20Powell">Andrew Powell</a> appeared as arranger of orchestra (and often choirs) on all albums except "<a href="Vulture%20Culture">Vulture Culture</a>" (1984), when he was composing the <a href="film%20score">score</a> of <a href="Richard%20Donner">Richard Donner</a>'s film "<a href="Ladyhawke%20%28film%29">Ladyhawke</a>" (1985). This score was partly in the Project style, recorded by most of the Project regulars, and produced and engineered by Parsons. Powell also composed some material for the first two Project albums. From "Vulture Culture" onwards, Richard Cottle played as a regular member on synthesizers and saxophone.
Except for one occasion, the Project never played live during its original incarnation. This was because Woolfson and Parsons saw themselves mainly in the roles of writing and production, and also because of the technical difficulties of reproducing on stage the complex instrumentation used in the studio. In the 1990s things changed with the technology of <a href="digital%20sampler">digital sampler</a>s. The one occasion where the band was introduced as 'The Alan Parsons Project' in a live performance was at <a href="Night%20of%20the%20Proms">Night of the Proms</a> 1990 (at the time of the group's break-up), featuring all Project regulars except Woolfson who was present but behind the scenes, while Parsons stayed at the mixer except during the last song, where he played acoustic guitar.

Since 1993, a new version of the band has toured, with Parsons performing live acoustic guitar, keyboards and vocals, with various line-ups. This latest incarnation was called Alan Parsons, eventually renaming as the Alan Parsons Live Project, the name distinct from 'The Alan Parsons Project', due to founder Parsons' break-up with Woolfson. The band currently features lead singer P.J.

Almost all

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, the phrase "almost all" has a number of specialised uses which extend its intuitive meaning.

Referring to a subset of an infinite set, "almost all" is sometimes used synonymously with "all but [except] <a href="finite%20set">finite</a>ly many" (that is, it is a <a href="cofinite">cofinite</a> subset). A simple example is that almost all prime numbers are odd, which is based on the fact that all but one prime number are odd. (The exception is the number 2, which is prime but not odd.)

Referring to a subset of an uncountable set, "almost all" is sometimes used to mean all the elements except for a <a href="countable%20set">countable set</a>" (that is, it is a <a href="cocountable">cocountable</a> subset).

When speaking about the <a href="real%20number">reals</a>, sometimes it means "all reals but a set of <a href="Lebesgue%20measure">Lebesgue measure</a> zero" (formally, <a href="almost%20everywhere">almost everywhere</a>). In this sense almost all reals are not a member of the <a href="Cantor%20set">Cantor set</a> even though the Cantor set is <a href="Uncountable%20set">uncountable</a>.

More generally, "almost all" is sometimes used in the sense of "<a href="almost%20everywhere">almost everywhere</a>" in <a href="measure%20theory">measure theory</a>, or in the closely related sense of "<a href="almost%20surely">almost surely</a>" in <a href="probability%20theory">probability theory</a>.

In <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>, if "P"("n") is a property of <a href="positive%20integers">positive integers</a>, and if "p"("N") denotes the number of positive integers "n" less than "N" for which "P"("n") holds, and if

(see <a href="Limit%20of%20a%20sequence">limit</a>), then we say that ""P"("n") holds for almost all positive integers "n"" (formally, <a href="asymptotically%20almost%20surely">asymptotically almost surely</a>).

For example, the <a href="prime%20number%20theorem">prime number theorem</a> states that the number of <a href="prime%20numbers">prime numbers</a> less than or equal to "N" is asymptotically equal to "N"/ln "N". Therefore, the proportion of prime integers is roughly 1/ln "N", which tends to 0. Thus, "almost all" positive integers are <a href="composite%20number">composite</a> (not prime), however there are still an infinite number of primes.

Aromatic hydrocarbon

An aromatic hydrocarbon or arene (or sometimes aryl hydrocarbon) is a <a href="hydrocarbon">hydrocarbon</a> with <a href="sigma%20bond">sigma bond</a>s and delocalized <a href="pi%20electron">pi electron</a>s between carbon atoms forming a circle. In contrast, <a href="Aliphatic%20compound">aliphatic</a> hydrocarbons lack this delocalization. The term 'aromatic' was assigned before the physical mechanism determining <a href="aromaticity">aromaticity</a> was discovered; the term was coined as such simply because many of the compounds have a sweet or pleasant odour. The configuration of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is known as a benzene ring, after the simplest possible such hydrocarbon, <a href="benzene">benzene</a>. Aromatic hydrocarbons can be "monocyclic" (MAH) or "polycyclic" (PAH).

Some non-benzene-based compounds called heteroarenes, which follow <a href="H%C3%BCckel%27s%20rule">Hückel's rule</a> (for monocyclic rings: when the number of its π-electrons equals 4"n" + 2, where "n" = 0, 1, 2, 3,…), are also called aromatic compounds. In these compounds, at least one carbon atom is replaced by one of the <a href="heteroatom">heteroatom</a>s <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, or <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>. Examples of non-benzene compounds with aromatic properties are <a href="furan">furan</a>, a heterocyclic compound with a five-membered ring that includes a single oxygen atom, and <a href="pyridine">pyridine</a>, a heterocyclic compound with a six-membered ring containing one nitrogen atom.

<a href="Benzene">Benzene</a>, CH, is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon, and it was the first one named as such. The nature of its bonding was first recognized by <a href="August%20Kekul%C3%A9">August Kekulé</a> in the 19th century. Each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share. One goes to the hydrogen atom, and one each to the two neighbouring carbons. This leaves one electron to share with one of the same two neighbouring carbon atoms, thus creating a double bond with one carbon and leaving a single bond with the other, which is why the benzene molecule is drawn with alternating single and double bonds around the hexagon.

The structure is alternatively illustrated as a circle around the inside of the ring to show six electrons floating around in delocalized molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself. This depiction represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon–carbon bonds all of <a href="bond%20order">bond order</a> 1.5; the equivalency is explained by <a href="Resonance%20%28chemistry%29">resonance form</a>s. The electrons are visualized as floating above and below the ring with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat.

General properties of aromatic hydrocarbons:

The circle symbol for aromaticity was introduced by <a href="Robert%20Robinson%20%28organic%20chemist%29">Sir Robert Robinson</a> and his student James Armit in 1925 and popularized starting in 1959 by the Morrison & Boyd textbook on organic chemistry. The proper use of the symbol is debated; it is used to describe any cyclic π system in some publications, or only those π systems that obey <a href="H%C3%BCckel%27s%20rule">Hückel's rule</a> in others. Jensen argues that, in line with Robinson's original proposal, the use of the circle symbol should be limited to monocyclic 6 π-electron systems. In this way the circle symbol for a six-center six-electron bond can be compared to the Y symbol for a <a href="three-center%20two-electron%20bond">three-center two-electron bond</a>.

A reaction that forms an arene compound from an unsaturated or partially unsaturated cyclic precursor is simply called an <a href="aromatization">aromatization</a>. Many laboratory methods exist for the <a href="organic%20synthesis">organic synthesis</a> of arenes from non-arene precursors. Many methods rely on <a href="cycloaddition">cycloaddition</a> reactions. <a href="Alkyne%20trimerization">Alkyne trimerization</a> describes the [2+2+2] cyclization of three alkynes, in the <a href="D%C3%B6tz%20reaction">Dötz reaction</a> an alkyne, carbon monoxide and a chromium carbene complex are the reactants. <a href="Diels%E2%80%93Alder%20reaction">Diels–Alder reaction</a>s of <a href="alkyne">alkyne</a>s with <a href="pyrone">pyrone</a> or <a href="cyclopentadienone">cyclopentadienone</a> with expulsion of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> or carbon monoxide also form arene compounds. In <a href="Bergman%20cyclization">Bergman cyclization</a> the reactants are an <a href="enyne">enyne</a> plus a hydrogen donor.

Another set of methods is the aromatization of <a href="cyclohexane">cyclohexane</a>s and other aliphatic rings: reagents are catalysts used in <a href="hydrogenation">hydrogenation</a> such as platinum, palladium and nickel (reverse hydrogenation), <a href="quinone">quinone</a>s and the elements <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> and <a href="selenium">selenium</a>.

Arenes are reactants in many organic reactions.

In aromatic substitution one <a href="substituent">substituent</a> on the arene ring, usually hydrogen, is replaced by another substituent. The two main types are <a href="electrophilic%20aromatic%20substitution">electrophilic aromatic substitution</a> when the active reagent is an electrophile and <a href="nucleophilic%20aromatic%20substitution">nucleophilic aromatic substitution</a> when the reagent is a nucleophile. In <a href="radical-nucleophilic%20aromatic%20substitution">radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution</a> the active reagent is a radical. An example of electrophilic aromatic substitution is the nitration of <a href="salicylic%20acid">salicylic acid</a>:

In <a href="coupling%20reaction">coupling reaction</a>s a metal catalyses a coupling between two formal radical fragments. Common coupling reactions with arenes result in the formation of new <a href="carbon%E2%80%93carbon%20bond">carbon–carbon bond</a>s e.g., alkylarenes, vinyl arenes, biraryls, new <a href="carbon%E2%80%93nitrogen%20bond">carbon–nitrogen bond</a>s (anilines) or new <a href="carbon%E2%80%93oxygen%20bond">carbon–oxygen bond</a>s (aryloxy compounds). An example is the direct arylation of <a href="perfluorobenzenes">perfluorobenzenes</a> 

<a href="Hydrogenation">Hydrogenation</a> of arenes create saturated rings. The compound <a href="1-naphthol">1-naphthol</a> is completely reduced to a mixture of <a href="decalin">decalin</a>-ol <a href="isomer">isomer</a>s.
The compound <a href="resorcinol">resorcinol</a>, hydrogenated with <a href="Raney%20nickel">Raney nickel</a> in presence of aqueous <a href="sodium%20hydroxide">sodium hydroxide</a> forms an <a href="enolate">enolate</a> which is alkylated with <a href="methyl%20iodide">methyl iodide</a> to 2-methyl-1,3-cyclohexandione:

<a href="Cycloaddition">Cycloaddition</a> reaction are not common. Unusual thermal Diels–Alder reactivity of arenes can be found in the <a href="Wagner-Jauregg%20reaction">Wagner-Jauregg reaction</a>. Other photochemical cycloaddition reactions with alkenes occur through <a href="excimer">excimer</a>s.

Benzene derivatives have from one to six <a href="substituent">substituent</a>s attached to the central benzene core. Examples of benzene compounds with just one substituent are <a href="phenol">phenol</a>, which carries a <a href="hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a> group, and <a href="toluene">toluene</a> with a <a href="methyl">methyl</a> group. When there is more than one substituent present on the ring, their spatial relationship becomes important for which the <a href="arene%20substitution%20patterns">arene substitution patterns</a> "ortho", "meta", and "para" are devised. For example, three <a href="isomer">isomer</a>s exist for <a href="cresol">cresol</a> because the methyl group and the hydroxyl group can be placed next to each other ("ortho"), one position removed from each other ("meta"), or two positions removed from each other ("para"). <a href="Xylenol">Xylenol</a> has two methyl groups in addition to the hydroxyl group, and, for this structure, 6 isomers exist.

The arene ring has an ability to stabilize charges. This is seen in, for example, phenol (CH–OH), which is <a href="acidic">acidic</a> at the hydroxyl (OH), since a charge on this oxygen (alkoxide –O) is partially delocalized into the benzene ring.

<a href="Polycyclic%20aromatic%20hydrocarbon">Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon</a>s (PAHs) are aromatic hydrocarbons that consist of fused <a href="aromatic">aromatic</a> <a href="simple%20aromatic%20ring">rings</a> and do not contain <a href="heteroatom">heteroatom</a>s or carry <a href="substituent">substituent</a>s. <a href="Naphthalene">Naphthalene</a> is the simplest example of a PAH. PAHs occur in <a href="oil">oil</a>, <a href="coal">coal</a>, and <a href="tar">tar</a> deposits, and are produced as byproducts of fuel burning (whether fossil fuel or biomass). As pollutants, they are of concern because some compounds have been identified as <a href="carcinogen">carcinogen</a>ic, <a href="mutagen">mutagen</a>ic, and <a href="teratogen">teratogen</a>ic. PAHs are also found in cooked foods. Studies have shown that high levels of PAHs are found, for example, in meat cooked at high temperatures such as grilling or barbecuing, and in smoked fish.

They are also found in the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a>, in <a href="comet">comet</a>s, and in <a href="meteorite">meteorite</a>s and are a <a href="PAH%20world%20hypothesis">candidate molecule to act as a basis for the earliest forms of life</a>. In <a href="graphene">graphene</a> the PAH motif is extended to large 2D sheets.

Abbey

An abbey is a complex of buildings used by members of a religious order under the governance of an <a href="abbot">abbot</a> or <a href="abbess">abbess</a>. It provides a place for religious activities, work and housing of <a href="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="monk">monk</a>s and <a href="nun">nun</a>s. The concept of the abbey has developed over many centuries from the early monastic ways of religious men and women where they would live isolated from the lay community about them. Religious life in an abbey may be monastic. An abbey may be the home of an <a href="enclosed%20religious%20order">enclosed religious order</a> or may be open to visitors. The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order. Abbeys are often self-sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy, refuge to the persecuted or education to the young. Some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking <a href="retreat%20%28spiritual%29">spiritual retreat</a>. There are many famous abbeys across <a href="Europe">Europe</a>.

The earliest known Christian monasteries were groups of huts built near the residence of a famous <a href="ascetic">ascetic</a> or other holy person. Disciples wished to be close to their holy man or woman in order to study their doctrine or imitate their way of life.

In the earliest times of Christian monasticism, ascetics would live in social isolation but near a village church. They would subsist whilst donating any excess produce to the poor. However, increasing religious fervor about the ascetic's ways and or persecution of them would drive them further away from their community and further into solitude. For instance, the cells and huts of <a href="anchorite">anchorite</a>s (religious recluses) have been found in the deserts of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>.

In 312 AD, <a href="Anthony%20the%20Great">Anthony the Great</a> retired to the <a href="Thebaid">Thebaid</a> region of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> to escape the persecution of the Emperor <a href="Maximian">Maximian</a>. Anthony was the best known of the anchorites of his time due to his degree of austerity, sanctity and his powers of <a href="exorcism">exorcism</a>. The deeper he withdrew into the wilderness, the more numerous his disciples became. They refused to be separated from him and built their cells close to him. This became a first true monastic community. Anthony, according to <a href="Johann%20August%20Wilhelm%20Neander">Johann August Wilhelm Neander</a>, inadvertently became the founder of a new mode of living in common, <a href="Cenobitic">Coenobitism</a>.

At Tabennae on the <a href="Nile">Nile</a>, in <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper Egypt</a>, Saint <a href="Pachomius">Pachomius</a> laid the foundations for the coenobitical life by arranging everything in an organized manner. He built several monasteries, each with about 1,600 separate cells laid out in lines. These cells formed an encampment where the <a href="monk">monk</a>s slept and performed some of their manual tasks. There were nearby large halls such as the church, refectory, kitchen, infirmary, and guest house for the monk's common needs. An enclosure protecting all these buildings gave the settlement the appearance of a walled village. This layout, known as the "laurae" (lanes), became popular throughout <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>.

As well as the "laurae", communities known as "caenobia" developed. These were monasteries where monks lived a common life together. The monks were not permitted to retire to the cells of a laurae before they had undergone a lengthy period of training. In time, this form of common life superseded that of the older laurae.

In the late 300s AD, <a href="Palladius%20of%20Galatia">Palladius</a> visited the Egyptian monasteries. He described three hundred members of the coenobium of <a href="Panopolis">Panopolis</a>. There were fifteen tailors, seven smiths, four carpenters, twelve camel-drivers and fifteen tanners. These people were divided into subgroups, each with its own "<a href="oeconomus">oeconomus</a>". A chief steward was at the head of the monastery.

The produce of the monastery was brought to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> for sale. The moneys raised were used to purchase stores for the monastery or were given away as charity. Twice in the year, the superiors of several <a href="Cenobitic%20monasticism">coenobia</a> met at the chief monastery, under the presidency of an "<a href="archimandrite">archimandrite</a>" (the "chief of the fold" from the word, "miandra" (a sheepfold)) in order to make their reports. <a href="Chrysostom">Chrysostom</a> recorded the workings of a coenobia in the vicinity of <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>. The monks lived in separate huts ("kalbbia") which formed a religious hamlet on the mountainside. They were subject to an abbot, and observed a common rule.

The layout of the monastic coenobium was influenced by a number of factors. These included a need for defence, economy of space, and convenience of access. The layout of buildings became compact and orderly. Larger buildings were erected and defence was provided by strong outside walls. Within the walls, the buildings were arranged around one or more open courts surrounded by <a href="cloister">cloister</a>s. The usual arrangement for monasteries of the <a href="Eastern%20world">Eastern world</a> is exemplified in the plan of the convent of the <a href="Great%20Lavra">Great Lavra</a> at <a href="Mount%20Athos">Mount Athos</a>.

With reference to the diagram, right, the convent of the <a href="Great%20Lavra">Great Lavra</a> is enclosed within a strong and lofty blank stone wall. The area within the wall is between three and four acres (12,000 and 16,000 m²). The longer side is about in length. There is only one entrance, which is located on the north side (A), defended by three iron doors. Near the entrance is a large tower (M), a constant feature in the monasteries of the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> (Eastern <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> area). There is a small <a href="postern">postern</a> gate at L.

The <a href="enceinte">enceinte</a> comprises two large open courts, surrounded with buildings connected with cloister galleries of wood or stone. The outer court, which is the larger by far, contains the <a href="granary">granaries</a> and storehouses (K), the kitchen (H) and other offices connected with the <a href="refectory">refectory</a> (G). Immediately adjacent to the gateway is a two-storied guest-house, entered from a cloister (C). The inner court is surrounded by a cloister (EE) from which one enters the monks' cells (II).

In the centre of this court stands the <a href="katholikon">katholikon</a> or conventual church, a square building with an <a href="apse">apse</a> of the cruciform domical <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> type, approached by a domed <a href="narthex">narthex</a>. In front of the church stands a marble fountain (F), covered by a dome supported on columns.

Opening from the western side of the cloister, but actually standing in the outer court, is the refectory (G), a large cruciform (cross shaped) building, about square, decorated within with <a href="fresco">fresco</a>es of saints. At the upper end is a semicircular recess, similar to the <a href="triclinium">triclinium</a> of the <a href="Lateran%20Palace">Lateran Palace</a> in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, in which is placed the seat of the <a href="hegumenos">hegumenos</a> or abbot. This apartment is chiefly used as a meeting place, with the monks usually taking their meals in their separate cells.

Monasticism in the <a href="Western%20world">West</a> began with the activities of <a href="Benedict%20of%20Nursia">Benedict of Nursia</a> (born 480 AD). Near <a href="Nursia">Nursia</a>, a town in <a href="Perugia">Perugia</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, a first abbey was established at <a href="Monte%20Cassino">Monte Cassino</a> (529 AD). Between 520 and 700 AD, monasteries were built which were spacious and splendid. All the <a href="city%20state">city state</a>s of <a href="Italy">Italy</a> hosted a <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> convent as did the cities of <a href="England">England</a>, <a href="France">France</a> and <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. By 1415 AD, the time of the <a href="Council%20of%20Constance">Council of Constance</a>, 15,070 Benedictine monasteries had been established.

The early Benedictine monasteries, including the first at Monte Cassino, were constructed on the plan of the <a href="Roman%20villa">Roman villa</a>. The layout of the Roman villa was quite consistent throughout the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> and where possible, the monks reused available villas in sound repair. This was done at Monte Cassino.

However, over time, changes to the common villa lay out occurred. The monks required buildings which suited their religious and day-to-day activities. No overriding specification was demanded of the monks but the similarity of their needs resulted in uniformity of design of abbeys across Europe. Eventually, the buildings of a Benedictine abbey were built in a uniform lay out, modified where necessary, to accommodate local circumstances.

The plan of the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Saint%20Gall">Abbey of Saint Gall</a> (719 AD) indicates the general arrangement of a <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> monastery of its day. According to the architect <a href="Robert%20Willis%20%28architect%29">Robert Willis (architect)</a> (1800–1875) the Abbey's lay out is that of a town of individual houses with streets running between them. The abbey was planned in compliance with the Benedictine rule that, if possible, a monastery should be self-contained. For instance, there was a mill, a <a href="bakehouse">bakehouse</a>, <a href="stable">stable</a>s, and <a href="cattle">cattle</a> stalls. In all, there were thirty-three separate structures; mostly one level wooden buildings.

The Abbey church occupied the centre of a quadrangular area, about square. On the eastern side of the north transept of the church was the "<a href="scriptorium">scriptorium</a>" or writing-room, with a library above.

The church and nearby buildings ranged about the <a href="cloister">cloister</a>, a court about which there was a covered arcade which allowed sheltered movement between the buildings. The <a href="nave">nave</a> of the church was on the north boundary of the cloister.

On the east side of the cloister, on the ground floor, was the "<a href="pisalis">pisalis</a>" or "<a href="calefactory">calefactory</a>". This was a common room, warmed by flues beneath the floor. Above the common room was the <a href="dormitory">dormitory</a>. The dormitory opened onto the cloister and also onto the south transept of the church. This enabled the monks to attend nocturnal services. A passage at the other end of the dormitory lead to the "<a href="necessarium">necessarium</a>" (latrines).

On the south side of the cloister was the refectory. The kitchen, at the west end of the refectory was accessed via an anteroom and a long passage. Nearby were the bake house, brew house and the sleeping-rooms of the servants. The upper story of the refectory was called the "vestiarium" (a room where the ordinary clothes of the monks were stored).

On the western side of the cloister was another two-story building with a <a href="Semi-basement">cellar</a> on the ground floor and the <a href="larder">larder</a> and store-room on the upper floor. Between this building and the church was a parlour for receiving visitors. One door of the parlour led to the cloisters and the other led to the outer part of the Abbey.

Against the outer wall of the church was a school and headmaster's house. The school consisted of a large schoolroom divided in the middle by a screen or partition, and surrounded by fourteen little rooms, the "dwellings of the scholars". The abbott's home was near the school.

To the north of the church and to the right of the main entrance to the Abbey, was a residence for distinguished guests. To the left of the main entrance was a building to house poor travellers and <a href="pilgrim">pilgrim</a>s. There was also a building to receive visiting monks. These "<a href="hospitia">hospitia</a>" had a large common room or refectory surrounded by bed rooms. Each hospitium had its own brewhouse and bakehouse, and the building for more prestigious travellers had a kitchen and storeroom, with bedrooms for the guests' servants and stables for their horses. The monks of the Abbey lived in a house built against the north wall of the church.

The whole of the southern and western areas of the Abbey were devoted to workshops, stables and farm-buildings including stables, ox-sheds, goatstables, piggeries, and sheep-folds, as well as the servants' and labourers' quarters.

In the eastern part of the Abbey there was a group of buildings representing in layout, two complete miniature monasteries. That is, each had a covered cloister surrounded by the usual buildings such as the church, the refectory, the dormitory and so on. A detached building belonging to each contained a bathroom and a kitchen.

One of the miniature complexes was called the "oblati". These were the buildings for the novices. The other complex was a hospital or infirmary for the care of sick monks. This infirmary complex included a physician's residence, a <a href="physic%20garden">physic garden</a>, a drug store, and a chamber for the critically ill. There was also a room for bloodletting and purging. The physic garden occupied the north east corner of the Abbey.

In the southern most area of the abbey was the workshop containing utilities for <a href="shoemaker">shoemaker</a>s, saddlers (or shoemakers, sellarii), cutlers and grinders, <a href="Trencher%20%28tableware%29">trencher</a>-makers, <a href="Tanner%20%28occupation%29">tanners</a>, curriers, fullers, <a href="Smith%20%28metalwork%29">smiths</a> and <a href="goldsmith">goldsmith</a>s. The tradesmen's living quarters were at the rear of the workshop. Here, there were also farm buildings, a large granary and threshing-floor, mills, and malthouse. At the south-east corner of the Abbey were hen and duck houses, a poultry-yard, and the dwelling of the keeper. Nearby was the kitchen garden which complemented the physic garden and a cemetery <a href="orchard">orchard</a>.

Every large monastery had <a href="priory">priories</a>. A priory was a smaller structure or entities which depended on the monastery. Some were small monasteries accommodating five or ten monks. Others were no more than a single building serving as residence or a farm offices. The outlying farming establishments belonging to the monastic foundations were known as "villae" or "granges". They were usually staffed by <a href="lay-brothers">lay-brothers</a>, sometimes under the supervision of a monk.

Many of today's <a href="cathedral">cathedral</a>s in <a href="England">England</a> were originally Benedictine monasteries.

<a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> was founded in the tenth century by <a href="St.%20Dunstan">St. Dunstan</a> who established a community of <a href="Benedictine">Benedictine</a> monks. The only traces of St. Dunstan's monastery remaining are round arches and massive supporting columns of the <a href="undercroft">undercroft</a> and the Pyx Chamber.

The cloister and buildings lie directly to the south of the church. Parallel to the nave, on the south side of the cloister, was a refectory, with a lavatory at the door. On the eastern side, there was a dormitory, raised on a vaulted substructure and communicating with the south transept and a <a href="chapter%20house">chapter house</a> (meeting room). A small cloister lay to the south-east of the large cloister. Beyond that was an infirmary with a table hall and a refectory for those who were able to leave their chambers. At the west entrance to the Abbey, there was a house and a small courtyard for the abbott. 

In 1055, <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Abbey%2C%20York">St Mary's Abbey, York</a> was built in England's north by the <a href="Order%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Order of Saint Benedict</a>. It followed the common plan. The entrance to the abbey was through a strong gate on the northern side. Close to the entrance was a chapel. This was for visitors arriving at the Abbey to make their <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20devotions">devotions</a>. Near the gate was the <a href="hospitium">hospitium</a> (guest hall). The buildings are completely ruined, but the walls of the nave and the cloisters are still visible on the grounds of the <a href="Yorkshire%20Museum">Yorkshire Museum</a>.

The Abbey was surrounded by fortified walls on three sides. The <a href="River%20Ouse%2C%20Yorkshire">River Ouse</a> bordered the fourth side. The stone walls remain as an excellent example of English abbey walls.

The <a href="Abbey%20of%20Cluny">Abbey of Cluny</a> was founded by <a href="William%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Aquitaine">William I, Duke of Aquitaine</a> in 910 AD at <a href="Cluny">Cluny</a>, <a href="Sa%C3%B4ne-et-Loire">Saône-et-Loire</a>, <a href="France">France</a>. The Abbey was built in the <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> style. The Abbey was noted for its strict observance of the <a href="Rule%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Rule of Saint Benedict</a>. However, reforms resulted in many departures from this precedent. The <a href="Cluniac%20reforms">Cluniac reforms</a> brought focus to the traditions of monastic life, encouraging art and the caring of the poor. The Cluniac reforms quickly spread by the founding of new abbey complexes and also by adoption of the reforms by existing abbeys. By the twelfth century, the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Cluny">Abbey of Cluny</a> was the head of an order consisting of 314 monasteries.

The church at the Abbey was commenced in 1089 AD by <a href="St.%20Hugh">St. Hugh</a>, the sixth abbot. It was finished and consecrated by <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20II">Pope Innocent II</a> around 1132 AD. The church was regarded as one of the wonders of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. At in length, it was the largest church in <a href="Christendom">Christendom</a> until the completion of <a href="St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">St. Peter's Basilica</a> at Rome. The church consisted of five naves, a <a href="narthex">narthex</a> (ante-church) which was added in 1220 AD, and several towers. Together with the conventual buildings, it covered an area of twenty-five acres.

In the <a href="Dechristianization%20of%20France%20during%20the%20French%20Revolution">Dechristianization of France during the French Revolution</a> in 1790 AD, the Abbey church was bought by the town and almost entirely destroyed.

The first English house of the Cluniac order was built at <a href="Lewes">Lewes</a>, <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>. It was founded by <a href="William%20de%20Warenne%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Surrey">William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey</a> in about 1077 AD. All but one of the <a href="Cluniac%20houses%20in%20Britain">Cluniac houses in Britain</a> were known as <a href="Priory">priories</a>, symbolizing their subordination to the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Cluny">Abbey of Cluny</a>. All the Cluniac houses in England and Scotland were French colonies, governed by French priors who travelled to the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Cluny">Abbey of Cluny</a> to consult or be consulted (unless the abbot of Cluny chose to come to Britain, which happened rarely). The priory at <a href="Paisley%2C%20Renfrewshire">Paisley</a> was an exception. In 1245 AD it was raised to the status of an abbey, answerable only to the Pope.

The Austin <a href="canon%20%28priest%29">canons</a> were an order of <a href="regular%20clergy">regular clergy</a> within the hierarchy of the <a href="Catholic%20church">Catholic church</a>. They held a position between monks and secular canons. They were known as "Black canons" because of the colour of their <a href="habit">habit</a>s. In 1105 AD, the first house of the order was established at <a href="St.%20Botolph%27s%20Priory">St. Botolph's Priory</a>, <a href="Colchester%2C%20England">Colchester</a>, <a href="Essex">Essex</a>.

The canons built very long <a href="nave">nave</a>s to accommodate large congregations. The choirs were also long. Sometimes, as at <a href="Llanthony%20Priory">Llanthony</a> and <a href="Christchurch%2C%20Dorset">Christchurch, Dorset</a>(Twynham), the choir was closed from the aisles. At other abbeys of the order, such as <a href="Bolton%20Abbey">Bolton</a> or <a href="Kirkham%20Priory">Kirkham</a>, there were no aisles. The nave in the northern houses of the order often had only a north aisle (this is the case at Bolton, <a href="Brinkburn%20Priory">Brinkburn</a> and <a href="Lanercost%20Priory">Lanercost</a>). The arrangement of the monastic buildings followed the ordinary plan. The prior's lodge was usually attached to the southwest angle of the nave.

The Austin canons' house at <a href="Thornton%2C%20Lincolnshire">Thornton, Lincolnshire</a> had a large and magnificent <a href="gatehouse">gatehouse</a>. The upper floors of the gatehouse formed the guest-house. The chapter-house was octagonal in shape.

The plan of the Abbey of <a href="Augustinians">St Augustine's</a> at <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> (now the <a href="Bristol%20Cathedral">Bristol Cathedral</a>) demonstrates the arrangement of the buildings by this order. The plan departs very little from the ordinary Benedictine type.

The Premonstratensian regular canons, or "White canons", were of an order founded in 1119 AD by <a href="Norbert%20of%20Xanten">Norbert of Xanten</a>.The order was a reformed branch of the <a href="Augustinians">Augustinian canons</a>. From a marshy area in the Forest of Coucy in the <a href="diocese%20of%20Laon">diocese of Laon</a>, the order spread widely. Even in Norbert's lifetime, the order had built abbeys in <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Jerusalem">Kingdom of Jerusalem</a>. Of the Abbey of Saint Samuel, Denys Pringle wrote, "The Premonstatensian abbey of Saint Samuel was a daughter house of Prémontré itself. Its abbot had the status of a <a href="suffragan">suffragan</a> of the <a href="Latin%20Patriarch%20of%20Jerusalem">patriarch of Jerusalem</a>, with the right to a cross, but not to a <a href="mitre">mitre</a> nor a ring." It long maintained its rigid austerity, though in later years the abbey grew wealthier, and its members indulged in more frequent luxuries.

Just after 1140 AD, the Premonstratensians were brought to England. Their first settlement was at <a href="Newsham%20Abbey">Newhouse</a>, <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, near the <a href="Humber">Humber</a> tidal estuary. There were as many as thirty-five Premonstratensian abbeys in England. The head abbey in England was at <a href="Welbeck%20Abbey">Welbeck</a> but the best preserved are <a href="Easby%20Abbey">Easby Abbey</a> in <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, and <a href="Bayham%20Old%20Abbey">Bayham Old Abbey</a> in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>.

The lay out of <a href="Easby%20Abbey">Easby Abbey</a> is irregular due to its position on the edge of a steep river bank. The cloister is duly placed on the south side of the church, and the chief buildings occupy their usual positions around it. However, the cloister garth (quadrangle), as at <a href="Chichester">Chichester</a>, is not rectangular, and thus, all the surrounding buildings are positioned in an awkward fashion. The church follows the plan adopted by the Austin canons in their northern abbeys, and has only one aisle to the north of the nave, while the choir is long, narrow and without an aisle. Each transept has an aisle to the east, forming three chapels.

The church at <a href="Bayham%20Old%20Abbey">Bayham Old Abbey</a> had no aisles in the nave or the choir. The latter terminated in a three-sided apse. The church is remarkable for its extreme narrowness in proportion to its length. While the building is long, it is not more than wide. Premonstratensian canons did not care to have congregations nor possessions. Therefore, they built their churches in the shape of a long room.

The <a href="Cistercians">Cistercians</a>, a Benedictine reform group, were established at <a href="C%C3%AEteaux%20Abbey">Cîteaux</a> in 1098 AD by <a href="Robert%20of%20Molesme">Robert of Molesme</a>, Abbot of Molesme, for the purpose of restoring, as far as possible, the literal observance of the <a href="Rule%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Rule of Saint Benedict</a>. La Ferté, <a href="Pontigny%20Abbey">Pontigny</a>, <a href="Clairvaux%20Abbey">Clairvaux</a>, and <a href="Morimond%20Abbey">Morimond</a> were the first four abbeys to follow Cîteaux's example and others followed. The monks of Cîteaux created the well known vineyards of <a href="Clos%20de%20Vougeot">Clos-Vougeot</a> and <a href="Roman%C3%A9e-Saint-Vivant">Romanée</a> in <a href="Burgundy">Burgundy</a>.

The Cistercian principle of rigid <a href="Self-denial">self-abnegation</a> carried over to the design of the order's churches and buildings. The defining architectural characteristic of the Cistercian abbeys was extreme simplicity and plainness. Only a single, central tower was permitted, and that was usually very low. Unnecessary pinnacles and turrets were prohibited. The <a href="triforium">triforium</a> was omitted. The windows were usually plain and undivided, and it was forbidden to decorate them with stained glass. All needless ornament was proscribed. The crosses were made of wood and the candlesticks of iron.

The same principle governed the choice of site for Cistercian abbeys in that a most dismal site might be improved by the building of an abbey. The Cistercian monasteries were founded in deep, well-watered valleys, always standing at a stream's edge. The building might extend over the water as is the case at <a href="Fountains%20Abbey">Fountains Abbey</a>. These valleys, now rich and productive, had a very different appearance when the brethren first chose them as their place of retreat. Wide swamps, deep morasses, tangled thickets, and wild, impassable forests were their prevailing features. Clara Vallis of St Bernard, now the "bright valley" was originally, the "Valley of Wormwood". It was an infamous den of robbers.

Annales School

The "Annales" School () is a group of historians associated with a style of <a href="historiography">historiography</a> developed by French <a href="historians">historians</a> in the 20th century to stress long-term social history. It is named after its scholarly journal "<a href="Annales%20d%27histoire%20%C3%A9conomique%20et%20sociale">Annales d'histoire économique et sociale</a>", which remains the main source of scholarship, along with many books and monographs. The school has been highly influential in setting the agenda for historiography in France and numerous other countries, especially regarding the use of <a href="social%20science">social scientific</a> methods by historians, emphasizing social rather than political or diplomatic themes, and for being generally hostile to the class analysis of <a href="Marxist%20historiography">Marxist historiography</a>.

The school deals primarily with late medieval and early modern Europe (before the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>), with little interest in later topics. It has dominated French social history and influenced historiography in Europe and Latin America. Prominent leaders include co-founders <a href="Lucien%20Febvre">Lucien Febvre</a> (1878–1956), <a href="Henri%20Hauser">Henri Hauser</a> (1866-1946) and <a href="Marc%20Bloch">Marc Bloch</a> (1886–1944). The second generation was led by <a href="Fernand%20Braudel">Fernand Braudel</a> (1902–1985) and included <a href="Georges%20Duby">Georges Duby</a> (1919–1996), <a href="Pierre%20Goubert">Pierre Goubert</a> (1915–2012), <a href="Robert%20Mandrou">Robert Mandrou</a> (1921–1984), <a href="Pierre%20Chaunu">Pierre Chaunu</a> (1923–2009), <a href="Jacques%20Le%20Goff">Jacques Le Goff</a> (1924–2014), and <a href="Ernest%20Labrousse">Ernest Labrousse</a> (1895–1988). Institutionally it is based on the "Annales" journal, the SEVPEN publishing house, the (FMSH), and especially the 6th Section of the <a href="%C3%89cole%20pratique%20des%20hautes%20%C3%A9tudes">École pratique des hautes études</a>, all based in Paris. A third generation was led by <a href="Emmanuel%20Le%20Roy%20Ladurie">Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie</a> (1929– ) and includes Jacques Revel, and <a href="Philippe%20Ari%C3%A8s">Philippe Ariès</a> (1914–1984), who joined the group in 1978. The third generation stressed <a href="History%20of%20mentalities">history from the point of view of mentalities</a>, or "mentalités". The fourth generation of Annales historians, led by <a href="Roger%20Chartier">Roger Chartier</a> (1945– ), clearly distanced itself from the mentalities approach, replaced by the <a href="Cultural%20turn">cultural</a> and <a href="linguistic%20turn">linguistic turn</a>, which emphasize analysis of the social history of cultural practices.
The main scholarly outlet has been the journal "Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale" ("Annals of economic and social history"), founded in 1929 by Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, which broke radically with traditional historiography by insisting on the importance of taking all levels of society into consideration and emphasized the collective nature of mentalities. Its contributors viewed events as less fundamental than the mental frameworks that shaped decisions and practices.

Braudel was editor of "Annales" from 1956 to 1968, followed by the medievalist Jacques Le Goff. However, Braudel's informal successor as head of the school was Le Roy Ladurie. Noting the political upheavals in Europe and especially in France in 1968, <a href="Eric%20Hobsbawm">Eric Hobsbawm</a> argues that "in France the virtual hegemony of Braudelian history and the "Annales" came to an end after 1968, and the international influence of the journal dropped steeply." Multiple responses were attempted by the school. Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence indeed spread out from Paris, but few new ideas came in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history. However, the Annales ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political and demographic research. An attempt to require an "Annales"-written textbook for French schools was rejected by the government. By 1980 <a href="postmodern">postmodern</a> sensibilities undercut confidence in overarching metanarratives. As <a href="Jacques%20Revel">Jacques Revel</a> notes, the success of the Annales School, especially its use of social structures as explanatory forces, contained the seeds of its own downfall, for there is "no longer any implicit consensus on which to base the unity of the social, identified with the real." The Annales School kept its infrastructure, but lost its "mentalités".

The journal began in Strasbourg as "Annales d'histoire économique et sociale"; it moved to Paris and kept the same name from 1929 to 1939. It was successively renamed "Annales d'histoire sociale" (1939–1942, 1945), "Mélanges d'histoire sociale" (1942–1944), "Annales. Economies, sociétés, civilisations" (1946–1994), and "Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales" (1994– ).

In 1962 Braudel and Gaston Berger used Ford Foundation money and government funds to create a new independent foundation, the (FMSH), which Braudel directed from 1970 until his death. In 1970 the 6th Section and the "Annales" relocated to the FMSH building. FMSH set up elaborate international networks to spread the "Annales" gospel across Europe and the world. In 2013 it began publication of an English language edition, with all the articles translated.

The scope of topics covered by the journal is vast and experimental—there is a search for total history and new approaches. The emphasis is on social history, and very long-term trends, often using quantification and paying special attention to geography and to the intellectual world view of common people, or "mentality" ("mentalité"). Little attention is paid to political, diplomatic, or military history, or to biographies of famous men. Instead the "Annales" focused attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.

The "Annales" was founded and edited by <a href="Marc%20Bloch">Marc Bloch</a> and <a href="Lucien%20Febvre">Lucien Febvre</a> in 1929, while they were teaching at the <a href="University%20of%20Strasbourg">University of Strasbourg</a> and later in Paris. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive "Annales" approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the "<a href="Ann%C3%A9e%20Sociologique">Année Sociologique</a>" (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians whom Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures ("la <a href="longue%20dur%C3%A9e">longue durée</a>") over events and political transformations. Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called "mentalités," or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study. The goal of the Annales was to undo the work of the Sorbonnistes, to turn French historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history.

Co-founder <a href="Marc%20Bloch">Marc Bloch</a> (1886–1944) was a quintessential modernist who studied at the elite École Normale Supérieure, and in Germany, serving as a professor at the University of Strasbourg until he was called to the Sorbonne in Paris in 1936 as professor of economic history. Bloch's interests were highly interdisciplinary, influenced by the geography of <a href="Paul%20Vidal%20de%20la%20Blache">Paul Vidal de la Blache</a> (1845–1918) and the sociology of <a href="%C3%89mile%20Durkheim">Émile Durkheim</a> (1858–1917). His own ideas, especially those expressed in his masterworks, "French Rural History" ("Les caractères originaux de l'histoire rurale française," 1931) and "Feudal Society", were incorporated by the second-generation Annalistes, led by <a href="Fernand%20Braudel">Fernand Braudel</a>.

<a href="Georges%20Duby">Georges Duby</a>, a leader of the school, wrote that the history he taught:
The Annalistes, especially <a href="Lucien%20Febvre">Lucien Febvre</a>, advocated a "histoire totale", or "histoire tout court", a complete study of a historic problem.

Bloch was shot by the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> during the German occupation of France in World War II for his active membership of the <a href="French%20Resistance">French Resistance</a>, and Febvre carried on the "Annales" approach in the 1940s and 1950s. It was during this time that he mentored Braudel, who would become one of the best-known exponents of this school. Braudel's work came to define a "second" era of "Annales" historiography and was very influential throughout the 1960s and 1970s, especially for his work on the Mediterranean region in the era of <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II of Spain</a>. 
Braudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: "l'histoire quasi immobile" (the quasi motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures ("la <a href="longue%20dur%C3%A9e">longue durée</a>"), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures.

While authors such as <a href="Emmanuel%20Le%20Roy%20Ladurie">Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie</a>, <a href="Marc%20Ferro">Marc Ferro</a> and <a href="Jacques%20Le%20Goff">Jacques Le Goff</a> continue to carry the "Annales" banner, today the "Annales" approach has been less distinctive as more and more historians do work in <a href="cultural%20history">cultural history</a>, <a href="political%20history">political history</a> and <a href="economic%20history">economic history</a>.

Bloch's "Les Rois Thaumaturges" (1924) looked at the long-standing folk belief that the king could cure <a href="scrofula">scrofula</a> by his <a href="royal%20touch">thaumaturgic touch</a>. The kings of France and England indeed regularly practiced the ritual. Bloch was not concerned with the effectiveness of the royal touch—he acted instead like an anthropologist in asking why people believed it and how it shaped relations between king and commoner. The book was highly influential in introducing comparative studies (in this case France and England), as well as long durations ("longue durée") studies spanning several centuries, even up to a thousand years, downplaying short-term events. Bloch's revolutionary charting of mentalities, or "mentalités", resonated with scholars who were reading Freud and Proust. In the 1960s, <a href="Robert%20Mandrou">Robert Mandrou</a> and <a href="Georges%20Duby">Georges Duby</a> harmonized the concept of "mentalité" history with <a href="Fernand%20Braudel">Fernand Braudel</a>'s structures of historical time and linked mentalities with changing social conditions. A flood of "mentalité" studies based on these approaches appeared during the 1970s and 1980s. By the 1990s, however, "mentalité" history had become interdisciplinary to the point of fragmentation, but still lacked a solid theoretical basis. While not explicitly rejecting "mentalité" history, younger historians increasingly turned to other approaches.

Fernand Braudel became the leader of the second generation after 1945. He obtained funding from the Rockefeller Foundation in New York and founded the 6th Section of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, which was devoted to the study of history and the social sciences. It became an independent degree-granting institution in 1975 under the name <a href="School%20for%20Advanced%20Studies%20in%20the%20Social%20Sciences">École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales</a> (EHESS). Braudel's followers admired his use of the longue durée approach to stress slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past. The "Annales" historians, after living through two world wars and incredible political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress inertia and the longue durée. Special attention was paid to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They believed the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries. They rejected the Marxist idea that history should be used as a tool to foment and foster revolutions. In turn the Marxists called them conservatives.

Braudel's first book, "La Méditerranée et le Monde Méditerranéen à l'Epoque de Philippe II" (1949) ("The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II") was his most influential. This vast panoramic view used ideas from other social sciences, employed effectively the technique of the longue durée, and downplayed the importance of specific events and individuals. It stressed geography but not "mentalité". It was widely admired, but most historians did not try to replicate it and instead focused on their specialized monographs. The book dramatically raised the worldwide profile of the Annales School.

Before "Annales," French history supposedly happened in Paris. Febvre broke decisively with this paradigm in 1912, with his sweeping doctoral thesis on "Philippe II et la <a href="Franche-Comt%C3%A9">Franche-Comté</a>." The geography and social structure of this region overwhelmed and shaped the king's policies set in Paris.

The "Annales" historians did not try to replicate Braudel's vast geographical scope in "La Méditerranée." Instead they focused on regions in France over long stretches of time. The most important was the study of the "Peasants of Languedoc" by Braudel's star pupil and successor Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie. The regionalist tradition flourished especially in the 1960s and 1970s in the work of Pierre Goubert in 1960 on Beauvais and René Baehrel on Basse-Provence. "Annales" historians in the 1970s and 1980s turned to urban regions, including Pierre Deyon (Amiens), Maurice Garden (Lyon), Jean-Pierre Bardet (Rouen), Georges Freche (Toulouse), and Jean-Claude Perrot (Caen). By the 1970s the shift was underway from the earlier economic history to cultural history and the history of mentalities.

The "Annales" school systematically reached out to create an impact on other countries. Its success varied widely. The "Annales" approach was especially well received in Italy and Poland. <a href="Franciszek%20Bujak">Franciszek Bujak</a> (1875–1953) and <a href="Jan%20Rutkowski">Jan Rutkowski</a> (1886–1949), the founders of modern economic history in Poland and of the journal "Roczniki Dziejów Spolecznych i Gospodarczych" (1931– ), were attracted to the innovations of the Annales school. Rutkowski was in contact with Bloch and others, and published in the "Annales." After the Communists took control in the 1940s Polish scholars were safer working on the Middle Ages and the early modern era rather than contemporary history. After the "<a href="Polish%20October">Polish October</a>" of 1956 the Sixth Section in Paris welcomed Polish historians and exchanges between the circle of the "Annales" and Polish scholars continued until the early 1980s. The reciprocal influence between the French school and Polish historiography was particularly evident in studies on the Middle Ages and the early modern era studied by Braudel.

In South America the "Annales" approach became popular. From the 1950s <a href="Federico%20Brito%20Figueroa">Federico Brito Figueroa</a> was the founder of a new Venezuelan historiography based largely on the ideas of the Annales School. Brito Figueroa carried his conception of the field to all levels of university study, emphasizing a systematic and scientific approach to history and placing it squarely in the social sciences. Spanish historiography was influenced by the "Annales School" starting in 1950 with Jaime Vincens Vives (1910–1960). In Mexico, exiled Republican intellectuals extended the Annales approach, particularly from the Center for Historical Studies of El Colegio de México, the leading graduate studies institution of Latin America.

British historians, apart from a few Marxists, were generally hostile. Academic historians decidedly sided with <a href="Geoffrey%20Elton">Geoffrey Elton</a>'s "The Practice of History" against <a href="Edward%20Hallett%20Carr">Edward Hallett Carr</a>'s "<a href="What%20Is%20History%3F">What Is History?</a>". One of the few British historians who was sympathetic towards the work of the "Annales" school was <a href="Hugh%20Trevor-Roper">Hugh Trevor-Roper</a>. American, German, Indian, Russian and Japanese scholars generally ignored the school. The Americans developed their own form of "new social history" from entirely different roots. Both the American and the "Annales" historians picked up important family reconstitution techniques from French demographer Louis Henry.

The <a href="Wageningen%20University%20and%20Research%20Centre">Wageningen</a> school centered on <a href="Bernard%20Slicher%20van%20Bath">Bernard Slicher van Bath</a> was viewed internationally as a Dutch counterpart of the Annales school, although Slicher van Bath himself vehemently rejected the idea of a quantitative "school" of historiography.

Has been cited as a key influence in the development of <a href="World%20Systems%20Theory">World Systems Theory</a> by sociologist <a href="Immanuel%20Wallerstein">Immanuel Wallerstein</a>.

The current leader is <a href="Roger%20Chartier">Roger Chartier</a>, who is Directeur d'Études at the <a href="School%20for%20Advanced%20Studies%20in%20the%20Social%20Sciences">École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales</a> in Paris, Professeur in the <a href="Coll%C3%A8ge%20de%20France">Collège de France</a>, and Annenberg Visiting Professor of History at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>. He frequently lectures and teaches in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. His work in Early Modern European History focuses on the history of education, the history of the book and the history of reading. Recently, he has been concerned with the relationship between written culture as a whole and literature (particularly theatrical plays) for France, England and Spain. His work in this specific field (based on the criss-crossing between literary criticism, bibliography, and sociocultural history) is connected to broader historiographical and methodological interests which deal with the relation between history and other disciplines: philosophy, sociology, anthropology.

Chartier's typical undergraduate course focuses upon the making, remaking, dissemination, and reading of texts in early modern Europe and America. Under the heading of "practices," his class considers how readers read and marked up their books, forms of note-taking, and the interrelation between reading and writing from copying and translating to composing new texts. Under the heading of "materials," his class examines the relations between different kinds of writing surfaces (including stone, wax, parchment, paper, walls, textiles, the body, and the heart), writing implements (including styluses, pens, pencils, needles, and brushes), and material forms (including scrolls, erasable tables, codices, broadsides and printed forms and books). Under the heading of "places," his class explores where texts were made, read, and listened to, including monasteries, schools and universities, offices of the state, the shops of merchants and booksellers, printing houses, theaters, libraries, studies, and closets. The texts for his course include the "Bible", translations of Ovid, "Hamlet", "Don Quixote", Montaigne's essays, Pepys's diary, Richardson's "Pamela", and Franklin's autobiography.

Antimatter

In modern <a href="physics">physics</a>, antimatter is defined as a <a href="material">material</a> composed of the <a href="antiparticle">antiparticle</a> (or "partners") to the corresponding <a href="subatomic%20particle">particle</a>s of ordinary <a href="matter">matter</a>.

A particle and its anti-particle have -in theory- the same mass as one another, but opposite <a href="electric%20charge">electric charge</a>, and other differences in <a href="quantum%20number">quantum number</a>s. For example, a proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge. A collision between any particle and its anti-particle partner is known to lead to their "mutual <a href="annihilation">annihilation</a>", giving rise to various proportions of intense <a href="photon">photon</a>s (<a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s), <a href="neutrino">neutrino</a>s, and sometimes less-massive particle–antiparticle pairs.

Annihilation usually results in a release of energy that becomes available for heat or work. The amount of the released energy is usually proportional to the total mass of the collided matter and antimatter, in accord with the <a href="mass%E2%80%93energy%20equivalence">mass–energy equivalence</a> equation, .

Antimatter particles bind with one another to form antimatter, just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter. For example, a <a href="positron">positron</a> (the antiparticle of the <a href="electron">electron</a>) and an <a href="antiproton">antiproton</a> (the antiparticle of the <a href="proton">proton</a>) can form an <a href="antihydrogen">antihydrogen</a> atom. Physical principles indicate that complex antimatter atomic nuclei are possible, as well as anti-atoms corresponding to the known chemical elements.

There is considerable speculation as to why the <a href="observable%20universe">observable universe</a> is composed almost entirely of ordinary matter, as opposed to an equal mixture of matter and antimatter. This <a href="baryon%20asymmetry">asymmetry of matter and antimatter</a> in the <a href="visible%20universe">visible universe</a> is one of the great <a href="unsolved%20problems%20in%20physics">unsolved problems in physics</a>. The process by which this inequality between matter and antimatter particles developed is called <a href="baryogenesis">baryogenesis</a>.

Antimatter in the form of anti-atoms is one of the most difficult materials to produce. Individual antimatter particles, however, are commonly produced by <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a>s and in some types of <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive decay</a>. The nuclei of <a href="%23Antihelium">antihelium</a> have been artificially produced with difficulty. These are the most complex anti-nuclei so far observed.
Formally, antimatter particles can be defined by their negative <a href="baryon%20number">baryon number</a> or <a href="lepton%20number">lepton number</a>, while "normal" (non-antimatter) matter particles have a positive baryon or lepton number. These two classes of particles are the antiparticle partners of one another.

The idea of <a href="negative%20matter">negative matter</a> appears in past theories of matter that have now been abandoned. Using the once popular <a href="vortex%20theory%20of%20gravity">vortex theory of gravity</a>, the possibility of matter with negative gravity was discussed by <a href="William%20Mitchinson%20Hicks">William Hicks</a> in the 1880s. Between the 1880s and the 1890s, <a href="Karl%20Pearson">Karl Pearson</a> proposed the existence of "squirts" and sinks of the flow of <a href="Luminiferous%20aether">aether</a>. The squirts represented normal matter and the sinks represented negative matter. Pearson's theory required a fourth dimension for the aether to flow from and into.

The term antimatter was first used by <a href="Arthur%20Schuster">Arthur Schuster</a> in two rather whimsical letters to "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" in 1898, in which he coined the term. He hypothesized antiatoms, as well as whole antimatter solar systems, and discussed the possibility of matter and antimatter annihilating each other. Schuster's ideas were not a serious theoretical proposal, merely speculation, and like the previous ideas, differed from the modern concept of antimatter in that it possessed <a href="antigravity">negative gravity</a>.

The modern theory of antimatter began in 1928, with a paper by <a href="Paul%20Dirac">Paul Dirac</a>. Dirac realised that his <a href="Dirac%20equation">relativistic version</a> of the <a href="Schr%C3%B6dinger%20equation">Schrödinger wave equation</a> for electrons predicted the possibility of <a href="antielectron">antielectron</a>s. These were discovered by <a href="Carl%20David%20Anderson">Carl D. Anderson</a> in 1932 and named <a href="positron">positron</a>s (a <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of "positive electron"). Although Dirac did not himself use the term antimatter, its use follows on naturally enough from antielectrons, antiprotons, etc. A complete <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a> of antimatter was envisaged by <a href="Charles%20Janet">Charles Janet</a> in 1929.

The <a href="Feynman%E2%80%93Stueckelberg%20interpretation">Feynman–Stueckelberg interpretation</a> states that antimatter and <a href="antiparticles">antiparticles</a> are regular particles traveling backward in time.

One way to denote an <a href="antiparticle">antiparticle</a> is by adding a bar over the particle's symbol. For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as and , respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of <a href="quark">quark</a>s, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from <a href="antiquark">antiquark</a>s. Another convention is to distinguish particles by their <a href="electric%20charge">electric charge</a>. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as and respectively. However, to prevent confusion, the two conventions are never mixed.

There are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that, aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges (such as electric charge and spin), matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties. This means a particle and its corresponding antiparticle must have identical masses and decay lifetimes (if unstable). It also implies that, for example, a star made up of antimatter (an "antistar") will shine just like an ordinary star. This idea was tested experimentally in 2016 by the <a href="Antiproton%20Decelerator%23ALPHA">ALPHA</a> experiment, which measured the transition between the two lowest energy states of <a href="antihydrogen">antihydrogen</a>. The results, which are identical to that of hydrogen, confirmed the validity of quantum mechanics for antimatter.

Almost all matter observable from the Earth seems to be made of matter rather than antimatter. If antimatter-dominated regions of space existed, the gamma rays produced in annihilation reactions along the boundary between matter and antimatter regions would be detectable.

Antiparticles are created everywhere in the <a href="universe">universe</a> where high-energy particle collisions take place. High-energy <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a>s impacting <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a> (or any other matter in the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>) produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting <a href="particle%20jet">particle jet</a>s, which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter. They may similarly be produced in regions like the <a href="Galactic%20Center">center</a> of the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of <a href="relativistic%20jet">relativistic jet</a>s with the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a>). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s produced every time <a href="positron">positron</a>s annihilate with nearby matter. The <a href="frequency">frequency</a> and <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> of the gamma rays indicate that each carries 511 <a href="electronvolt">keV</a> of energy (i.e., the <a href="rest%20mass">rest mass</a> of an <a href="electron">electron</a> multiplied by "<a href="speed%20of%20light">c</a>").

Observations by the <a href="European%20Space%20Agency">European Space Agency</a>'s <a href="INTEGRAL">INTEGRAL satellite</a> may explain the origin of a giant antimatter cloud surrounding the galactic center. The observations show that the cloud is asymmetrical and matches the pattern of <a href="X-ray%20binaries">X-ray binaries</a> (binary star systems containing black holes or neutron stars), mostly on one side of the galactic center. While the mechanism is not fully understood, it is likely to involve the production of electron–positron pairs, as ordinary matter gains kinetic energy while falling into a <a href="stellar%20remnant">stellar remnant</a>.

Antimatter may exist in relatively large amounts in far-away galaxies due to <a href="cosmic%20inflation">cosmic inflation</a> in the primordial time of the universe. Antimatter galaxies, if they exist, are expected to have the same chemistry and <a href="spectroscopy">absorption and emission spectra</a> as normal-matter galaxies, and their <a href="astronomical%20object">astronomical object</a>s would be observationally identical, making them difficult to distinguish. <a href="NASA">NASA</a> is trying to determine if such galaxies exist by looking for X-ray and gamma-ray signatures of annihilation events in <a href="colliding%20galaxy">colliding</a> <a href="supercluster">supercluster</a>s.

Positrons are produced naturally in β decays of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes (for example, <a href="potassium-40">potassium-40</a>) and in interactions of gamma quanta (emitted by radioactive nuclei) with matter. <a href="Antineutrino">Antineutrino</a>s are another kind of antiparticle created by natural radioactivity (β decay). Many different kinds of antiparticles are also produced by (and contained in) <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a>s. In January 2011, research by the <a href="American%20Astronomical%20Society">American Astronomical Society</a> discovered antimatter (positrons) originating above <a href="thunderstorm">thunderstorm</a> clouds; positrons are produced in gamma-ray flashes created by electrons accelerated by strong electric fields in the clouds. Antiprotons have also been found to exist in the <a href="Van%20Allen%20Belt">Van Allen Belt</a>s around the Earth by the <a href="Payload%20for%20Antimatter%20Matter%20Exploration%20and%20Light-nuclei%20Astrophysics%23Results">PAMELA module</a>.

Antiparticles are also produced in any environment with a sufficiently high temperature (mean particle energy greater than the <a href="pair%20production">pair production</a> threshold). It is hypothesized that during the period of baryogenesis, when the universe was extremely hot and dense, matter and antimatter were continually produced and annihilated. The presence of remaining matter, and absence of detectable remaining antimatter, is called <a href="baryon%20asymmetry">baryon asymmetry</a>. The exact mechanism which produced this asymmetry during baryogenesis remains an unsolved problem. One of the <a href="Sakharov%20conditions">necessary conditions</a> for this asymmetry is the <a href="CP%20violation">violation of CP symmetry</a>, which has been experimentally observed in the <a href="weak%20interaction">weak interaction</a>.

Recent observations indicate black holes and neutron stars produce vast amounts of positron-electron plasma via the jets.

Satellite experiments have found evidence of <a href="positron">positron</a>s and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays, amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays. This antimatter cannot all have been created in the Big Bang, but is instead attributed to have been produced by cyclic processes at high energies. For instance, electron-positron pairs may be formed in <a href="pulsar">pulsar</a>s, as a magnetized neutron star rotation cycle shears electron-positron pairs from the star surface. Therein the antimatter forms a wind which crashes upon the ejecta of the progenitor supernovae. This weathering takes place as "the cold, magnetized relativistic wind launched by the star hits the non-relativistically expanding ejecta, a shock wave system forms in the impact: the outer one propagates in the ejecta, while a reverse shock propagates back towards the star." The former ejection of matter in the outer shock wave and the latter production of antimatter in the reverse shock wave are steps in a space weather cycle.

Preliminary results from the presently operating <a href="Alpha%20Magnetic%20Spectrometer">Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer</a> ("AMS-02") on board the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a> show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality, and with energies that range from 10 to 250 GeV. In September, 2014, new results with almost twice as much data were presented in a talk at CERN and published in Physical Review Letters. A new measurement of positron fraction up to 500 GeV was reported, showing that positron fraction peaks at a maximum of about 16% of total electron+positron events, around an energy of 275 ± 32 GeV. At higher energies, up to 500 GeV, the ratio of positrons to electrons begins to fall again. The absolute flux of positrons also begins to fall before 500 GeV, but peaks at energies far higher than electron energies, which peak about 10 GeV. These results on interpretation have been suggested to be due to positron production in annihilation events of massive <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a> particles.

Cosmic ray antiprotons also have a much higher energy than their normal-matter counterparts (protons). They arrive at Earth with a characteristic energy maximum of 2 GeV, indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons, which on average have only one-sixth of the energy.

There is no evidence of complex antimatter atomic nuclei, such as <a href="%23Antihelium">antihelium</a> nuclei (i.e., anti-alpha particles), in cosmic rays. These are actively being searched for, because the detection of natural antihelium implies the existence of large antimatter structures such as an antistar. A prototype of the "AMS-02" designated "AMS-01", was flown into space aboard the on <a href="STS-91">STS-91</a> in June 1998. By not detecting any <a href="%23Antihelium">antihelium</a> at all, the "AMS-01" established an upper limit of 1.1×10 for the antihelium to helium <a href="flux">flux</a> ratio.

Positrons were reported in November 2008 to have been generated by <a href="Lawrence%20Livermore%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> in larger numbers than by any previous synthetic process. A <a href="laser">laser</a> drove <a href="electrons">electrons</a> through a <a href="gold">gold</a> target's <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nuclei</a>, which caused the incoming electrons to emit <a href="energy">energy</a> <a href="quantum">quanta</a> that decayed into both matter and antimatter. Positrons were detected at a higher rate and in greater density than ever previously detected in a laboratory. Previous experiments made smaller quantities of positrons using lasers and paper-thin targets; however, new simulations showed that short, ultra-intense lasers and millimeter-thick gold are a far more effective source.

The existence of the antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955 by <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a> <a href="physicist">physicist</a>s <a href="Emilio%20Segr%C3%A8">Emilio Segrè</a> and <a href="Owen%20Chamberlain">Owen Chamberlain</a>, for which they were awarded the 1959 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a>. An antiproton consists of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark (). The properties of the antiproton that have been measured all match the corresponding properties of the proton, with the exception of the antiproton having opposite electric charge and magnetic moment from the proton. Shortly afterwards, in 1956, the antineutron was discovered in proton–proton collisions at the <a href="Bevatron">Bevatron</a> (<a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>) by <a href="Bruce%20Cork">Bruce Cork</a> and colleagues.

In addition to anti<a href="baryon">baryon</a>s, anti-nuclei consisting of multiple bound antiprotons and antineutrons have been created. These are typically produced at energies far too high to form antimatter atoms (with bound positrons in place of electrons). In 1965, a group of researchers led by <a href="Antonino%20Zichichi">Antonino Zichichi</a> reported production of nuclei of antideuterium at the Proton Synchrotron at <a href="CERN">CERN</a>. At roughly the same time, observations of antideuterium nuclei were reported by a group of American physicists at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at <a href="Brookhaven%20National%20Laboratory">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a>.

In 1995, <a href="CERN">CERN</a> announced that it had successfully brought into existence nine hot antihydrogen atoms by implementing the <a href="SLAC">SLAC</a>/<a href="Fermilab">Fermilab</a> concept during the <a href="PS210%20experiment">PS210 experiment</a>. The experiment was performed using the <a href="Low%20Energy%20Antiproton%20Ring">Low Energy Antiproton Ring</a> (LEAR), and was led by Walter Oelert and Mario Macri. Fermilab soon confirmed the CERN findings by producing approximately 100 antihydrogen atoms at their facilities. The antihydrogen atoms created during PS210 and subsequent experiments (at both CERN and Fermilab) were extremely energetic and were not well suited to study. To resolve this hurdle, and to gain a better understanding of antihydrogen, two collaborations were formed in the late 1990s, namely, <a href="ATHENA">ATHENA</a> and <a href="ATRAP">ATRAP</a>.

In 1999, CERN activated the <a href="Antiproton%20Decelerator">Antiproton Decelerator</a>, a device capable of decelerating antiprotons from to — still too "hot" to produce study-effective antihydrogen, but a huge leap forward. In late 2002 the ATHENA project announced that they had created the world's first "cold" antihydrogen. The ATRAP project released similar results very shortly thereafter. The antiprotons used in these experiments were cooled by decelerating them with the Antiproton Decelerator, passing them through a thin sheet of foil, and finally capturing them in a Penning–Malmberg trap. The overall cooling process is workable, but highly inefficient; approximately 25 million antiprotons leave the Antiproton Decelerator and roughly 25,000 make it to the Penning–Malmberg trap, which is about or 0.1% of the original amount.

The antiprotons are still hot when initially trapped. To cool them further, they are mixed into an electron plasma. The electrons in this plasma cool via cyclotron radiation, and then sympathetically cool the antiprotons via <a href="Coulomb%20potential">Coulomb</a> collisions. Eventually, the electrons are removed by the application of short-duration electric fields, leaving the antiprotons with energies less than . While the antiprotons are being cooled in the first trap, a small cloud of positrons is captured from <a href="radioactive">radioactive</a> <a href="sodium">sodium</a> in a Surko-style positron accumulator. This cloud is then recaptured in a second trap near the antiprotons. Manipulations of the trap electrodes then tip the antiprotons into the positron plasma, where some combine with antiprotons to form antihydrogen. This neutral antihydrogen is unaffected by the electric and magnetic fields used to trap the charged positrons and antiprotons, and within a few microseconds the antihydrogen hits the trap walls, where it annihilates. Some hundreds of millions of antihydrogen atoms have been made in this fashion.

In 2005, ATHENA disbanded and some of the former members (along with others) formed the <a href="ALPHA%20Collaboration">ALPHA Collaboration</a>, which is also based at CERN. The primary goal of these collaborations is the creation of less energetic ("cold") antihydrogen, better suited to study.

In 2016 a new antiproton decelerator and cooler called ELENA (E Low ENergy Antiproton decelerator) was built. It takes the antiprotons from the antiproton decelerator and cools them to 90 keV which is "cold" enough to study. More than a hundred antiprotons can be captured per second, a huge improvement, but it would still take several thousand years to make a <a href="nanogram">nanogram</a> of antimatter.

Most of the sought-after high-precision tests of the properties of antihydrogen could only be performed if the antihydrogen were trapped, that is, held in place for a relatively long time. While antihydrogen atoms are electrically neutral, the <a href="spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a>s of their component particles produce a <a href="magnetic%20moment">magnetic moment</a>. These magnetic moments can interact with an inhomogeneous magnetic field; some of the antihydrogen atoms can be attracted to a magnetic minimum. Such a minimum can be created by a combination of mirror and multipole fields.
Antihydrogen can be trapped in such a magnetic minimum (minimum-B) trap; in November 2010, the ALPHA collaboration announced that they had so trapped 38 antihydrogen atoms for about a sixth of a second. This was the first time that neutral antimatter had been trapped.

On 26 April 2011, ALPHA announced that they had trapped 309 antihydrogen atoms, some for as long as 1,000 seconds (about 17 minutes). This was longer than neutral antimatter had ever been trapped before.
ALPHA has used these trapped atoms to initiate research into the spectral properties of the antihydrogen.

The biggest limiting factor in the large-scale production of antimatter is the availability of antiprotons. Recent data released by CERN states that, when fully operational, their facilities are capable of producing ten million antiprotons per minute. Assuming a 100% conversion of antiprotons to antihydrogen, it would take 100 billion years to produce 1 gram or 1 <a href="Mole%20%28unit%29">mole</a> of antihydrogen (approximately atoms of anti-hydrogen).

Antihelium-3 nuclei () were first observed in the 1970s in proton–nucleus collision experiments at the Institute for High Energy Physics by Y. Prockoshkin's group (Protvino near Moscow, USSR)
and later created in nucleus–nucleus collision experiments. Nucleus–nucleus collisions produce antinuclei through the coalescense of antiprotons and antineutrons created in these reactions. In 2011, the <a href="STAR%20detector">STAR detector</a> reported the observation of artificially created antihelium-4 nuclei (anti-alpha particles) () from such collisions.

Antimatter cannot be stored in a container made of ordinary matter because antimatter reacts with any matter it touches, annihilating itself and an equal amount of the container. Antimatter in the form of <a href="charged%20particle">charged particle</a>s can be contained by a combination of <a href="electric%20field">electric</a> and <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic</a> fields, in a device called a <a href="Penning%20trap">Penning trap</a>. This device cannot, however, contain antimatter that consists of uncharged particles, for which <a href="atomic%20trap">atomic trap</a>s are used. In particular, such a trap may use the <a href="dipole">dipole</a> moment (<a href="Electric%20dipole%20moment">electric</a> or <a href="Magnetic%20moment">magnetic</a>) of the trapped particles. At high <a href="vacuum">vacuum</a>, the matter or antimatter particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off-resonant laser radiation using a <a href="magneto-optical%20trap">magneto-optical trap</a> or <a href="Magnetic%20trap%20%28atoms%29">magnetic trap</a>. Small particles can also be suspended with <a href="optical%20tweezers">optical tweezers</a>, using a highly focused laser beam.

In 2011, <a href="CERN">CERN</a> scientists were able to preserve antihydrogen for approximately 17 minutes.

Scientists claim that antimatter is the costliest material to make. In 2006, Gerald Smith estimated $250 million could produce 10 milligrams of positrons (equivalent to $25 billion per gram); in 1999, NASA gave a figure of $62.5 trillion per gram of antihydrogen. This is because production is difficult (only very few antiprotons are produced in reactions in particle accelerators), and because there is higher demand for other uses of <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a>s. According to CERN, it has cost a few hundred million <a href="Swiss%20franc">Swiss franc</a>s to produce about 1 billionth of a gram (the amount used so far for particle/antiparticle collisions). In comparison, to produce the first atomic weapon, the cost of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> was estimated at $23 billion with inflation during 2007.

Several studies funded by the <a href="NASA%20Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Concepts">NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts</a> are exploring whether it might be possible to use magnetic scoops to collect the antimatter that occurs naturally in the <a href="Van%20Allen%20belt">Van Allen belt</a> of the Earth, and ultimately, the belts of gas giants, like <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, hopefully at a lower cost per gram.

Matter–antimatter reactions have practical applications in medical imaging, such as <a href="positron%20emission%20tomography">positron emission tomography</a> (PET). In positive <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>, a <a href="nuclide">nuclide</a> loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron (in the same event, a proton becomes a neutron, and a <a href="neutrino">neutrino</a> is also emitted). Nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a> and are widely generated for medical use. Antiprotons have also been shown within laboratory experiments to have the potential to treat certain cancers, in a similar method currently used for ion (proton) therapy.

Isolated and stored anti-matter could be used as a <a href="fuel">fuel</a> for <a href="interplanetary%20spaceflight">interplanetary</a> or <a href="interstellar%20travel">interstellar travel</a> as part of an <a href="antimatter%20catalyzed%20nuclear%20pulse%20propulsion">antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion</a> or other <a href="antimatter%20rocket">antimatter rocket</a>ry, such as the <a href="redshift%20rocket">redshift rocket</a>. Since the energy density of antimatter is higher than that of conventional fuels, an antimatter-fueled spacecraft would have a higher <a href="thrust-to-weight%20ratio">thrust-to-weight ratio</a> than a conventional spacecraft.

If matter–antimatter collisions resulted only in <a href="photon">photon</a> emission, the entire <a href="rest%20mass">rest mass</a> of the particles would be converted to <a href="kinetic%20energy">kinetic energy</a>. The <a href="energy%20density">energy per unit mass</a> () is about 10 <a href="order%20of%20magnitude">orders of magnitude</a> greater than <a href="chemical%20energy">chemical energies</a>, and about 3 orders of magnitude greater than the <a href="nuclear%20potential%20energy">nuclear potential energy</a> that can be liberated, today, using <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a> (about per fission reaction or ), and about 2 orders of magnitude greater than the best possible results expected from <a href="nuclear%20fusion">fusion</a> (about for the <a href="proton%E2%80%93proton%20chain%20reaction">proton–proton chain</a>). The reaction of of antimatter with of matter would produce (180 petajoules) of energy (by the <a href="mass%E2%80%93energy%20equivalence">mass–energy equivalence</a> formula, ), or the rough equivalent of 43 megatons of TNT – slightly less than the yield of the 27,000 kg <a href="Tsar%20Bomba">Tsar Bomba</a>, the largest <a href="thermonuclear%20weapon">thermonuclear weapon</a> ever detonated.

Not all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic propulsion technology because of the nature of the annihilation products. While electron–positron reactions result in gamma ray photons, these are difficult to direct and use for thrust. In reactions between protons and antiprotons, their energy is converted largely into relativistic neutral and charged <a href="pion">pion</a>s. The <a href="Pion%23Neutral%20pion%20decays">neutral pions</a> decay almost immediately (with a lifetime of 85 <a href="attoseconds">attoseconds</a>) into high-energy photons, but the <a href="Pion%23Charged%20pion%20decays">charged pions</a> decay more slowly (with a lifetime of 26 nanoseconds) and can be <a href="Antimatter%20rocket%23Direct%20use%20of%20reaction%20products">deflected magnetically to produce thrust</a>.

Charged pions ultimately decay into a combination of <a href="neutrino">neutrino</a>s (carrying about 22% of the energy of the charged pions) and unstable charged <a href="muon">muon</a>s (carrying about 78% of the charged pion energy), with the muons then decaying into a combination of electrons, positrons and neutrinos (cf. <a href="muon%20decay">muon decay</a>; the neutrinos from this decay carry about 2/3 of the energy of the muons, meaning that from the original charged pions, the total fraction of their energy converted to neutrinos by one route or another would be about ).
Antimatter has been considered as a trigger mechanism for nuclear weapons. A major obstacle is the difficulty of producing antimatter in large enough quantities, and there is no evidence that it will ever be feasible. However, the U.S. Air Force funded studies of the physics of antimatter in the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, and began considering its possible use in weapons, not just as a trigger, but as the explosive itself.

Casa Batlló

Casa Batlló () is a renowned building located in the center of <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and is one of <a href="Antoni%20Gaud%C3%AD">Antoni Gaudí</a>’s masterpieces. A remodel of a previously built house, it was redesigned in 1904 by Gaudí and has been refurbished several times after that. Gaudí's assistants <a href="Dom%C3%A8nec%20Sugra%C3%B1es%20i%20Gras">Domènec Sugrañes i Gras</a>, Josep Canaleta and <a href="Joan%20Rubi%C3%B3">Joan Rubió</a> also contributed to the renovation project. The local name for the building is "Casa dels ossos" (House of Bones), as it has a <a href="viscera">viscera</a>l, <a href="skeleton">skeletal</a> organic quality.

Like everything Gaudí designed, it is only identifiable as <a href="Modernisme">Modernisme</a> or <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> in the broadest sense. The ground floor, in particular, has unusual <a href="tracery">tracery</a>, irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work. There are few straight lines, and much of the <a href="fa%C3%A7ade">façade</a> is decorated with a colorful <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a> made of broken ceramic tiles (<a href="trencad%C3%ADs">trencadís</a>). The roof is <a href="arch">arch</a>ed and was likened to the back of a <a href="European%20dragon">dragon</a> or <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>. A common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre, terminating at the top in a turret and cross, represents the lance of <a href="Saint%20George">Saint George</a> (patron saint of <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, Gaudí's home), which has been plunged into the back of the dragon.

The building that is now Casa Batlló was built in 1877, commissioned by Lluís Sala Sánchez. It was a classical building without remarkable characteristics within the <a href="eclecticism">eclecticism</a> traditional by the end of the 19th century. The building had a basement, a ground floor, four other floors and a garden in the back.

The house was bought by Josep Batlló in 1900. The design of the house made the home undesirable to buyers but the Batlló family decided to buy the place due to its centralized location. It is located in the middle of <a href="Passeig%20de%20Gracia">Passeig de Gracia</a>, which in the early 20th century was known as a very prestigious and fashionable area. It was an area where the prestigious family could draw attention to themselves.

In 1906 Josep Batlló still owned the home. The Batlló family was very well known in Barcelona for its contribution to the textile industry in the city. Mr. Josep Batlló I Casanovas was a textile industrialist who owned a few factories in the city. Mr. Batlló married Amalia Godo Belaunzaran, from the family that founded the newspaper La Vanguardia. Josep wanted an architect that would design a house that was like no other and stood out as being audacious and creative. Both Josep and his wife were open to anything and they decided not to limit Gaudí. Josep did not want his house to resemble any of the houses of the rest of the Batlló family, such as Casa Pía, built by the Josep Vilaseca. He chose the architect who had designed <a href="Park%20G%C3%BCell">Park Güell</a> because he wanted him to come up with a risky plan. The family lived on the Noble Floor of Casa Batlló until the middle of the 1950s.

In 1904 Josep Batlló hired Gaudí to design his home; at first his plans were to tear down the building and construct a completely new house. Gaudí convinced Josep that a renovation was sufficient and was also able to submit the planning application the same year. The building was completed and refurbished in 1906. He completely changed the main apartment which became the residence for the Batlló family. He expanded the central well in order to supply light to the whole building and also added new floors. In the same year the Barcelona City Council selected the house as a candidate for that year’s best building award. The award was given to another architect that year despite Gaudí’s design.

Josep Batlló died in 1934 and the house was kept in order by the wife until her death in 1940 . After the death of the two parents, the house was kept and managed by the children until 1954. In 1954 an insurance company named Seguros Iberia acquired Casa Batlló and set up offices there. In 1970, the first refurbishment occurred mainly in several of the interior rooms of the house. In 1983, the exterior balconies were restored to their original colour and a year later the exterior façade was illuminated in the ceremony of <a href="La%20Merc%C3%A8">La Mercè</a>.

In 1993, the current owners of Casa Batlló bought the home and continued refurbishments throughout the whole building. Two years later, in 1995, Casa Batlló began to hire out its facilities for different events. More than 2,500 square meters of rooms within the building were rented out for many different functions. Due to the building's location and the beauty of the facilities being rented, the rooms of Casa Batlló were in very high demand and hosted many important events for the city.

The local name for the building is "Casa dels ossos" (House of Bones), as it has a <a href="viscera">viscera</a>l, <a href="skeleton">skeletal</a> organic quality. The building looks very remarkable — like everything Gaudí designed, only identifiable as <a href="Modernisme">Modernisme</a> or <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> in the broadest sense. The ground floor, in particular, is rather astonishing with tracery, irregular oval windows and flowing sculpted stone work.

It seems that the goal of the designer was to avoid straight lines completely. Much of the <a href="fa%C3%A7ade">façade</a> is decorated with a <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a> made of broken ceramic tiles (<a href="trencad%C3%ADs">trencadís</a>) that starts in shades of golden orange moving into greenish blues. The roof is <a href="arch">arch</a>ed and was likened to the back of a <a href="European%20dragon">dragon</a> or <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>. A common theory about the building is that the rounded feature to the left of centre, terminating at the top in a turret and cross, represents the lance of <a href="Saint%20George">Saint George</a> (patron saint of <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, Gaudí's home), which has been plunged into the back of the dragon.

The loft is considered to be one of the most unusual spaces. It was formerly a service area for the tenants of the different apartments in the building which contained laundry rooms and storage areas. It is known for its simplicity of shapes and its Mediterranean influence through the use of white on the walls. It contains a series of sixty <a href="catenary%20arch">catenary arch</a>es that creates a space which represents the ribcage of an animal. Some people believe that the “ribcage” design of the arches is a ribcage for the dragon’s spine that is represented in the roof.

The noble floor is larger than seven-hundred square meters. It is the main floor of the building. The noble floor is accessed through a private entrance hall that utilizes skylights resembling tortoise shells and vaulted walls in curving shapes. On the noble floor, there is a spacious landing with direct views to the blue tiling of the building well. On the Passeig de Gracia side is Mr. Batlló’s study, a dining room, and a secluded spot for courting couples, decorated with a mushroom-shaped fireplace. The elaborate and animal-like décor continues throughout the whole noble floor.

In 2002, the house opened its doors to the public, and people were allowed to visit the noble floor. The building was opened to the public as part of the celebration of the International Year of Gaudí. Casa Batlló met with very much unanticipated success, and visitors became eager to see the rest of the house. Two years later, in celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of the beginning of work on Casa Batlló the fifth floor was restored, and the house extended its visit to the loft and the well. In 2005, Casa Batlló became a <a href="Unesco%20World%20Heritage%20Site">Unesco World Heritage Site</a>.

The roof terrace is one of the most popular features of the entire house due to its famous dragon back design. Gaudí represents an animal’s spine by using tiles of different colors on one side. The roof is decorated with four chimney stacks, that are designed to prevent backdraughts.

The facade has three distinct sections which are harmoniously integrated. The lower ground floor with the main floor and two first-floor galleries are contained in a structure of <a href="Montju%C3%AFc">Montjuïc</a> sandstone with undulating lines. The central part, which reaches the last floor, is a multicolored section with protruding balconies. The top of the building is a crown, like a huge gable, which is at the same level as the roof and helps to conceal the room where there used to be water tanks. This room is currently empty. The top displays a <a href="Molding%20%28decorative%29">trim</a> with ceramic pieces that has attracted multiple interpretations.


The roof's arched profile recalls the spine of a dragon with ceramic tiles for scales, and a small triangular window towards the right of the structure simulates the eye. Legend has it that it was once possible to see the Sagrada Familia through this window, which was being built simultaneously. The view of the <a href="Sagrada%20Familia">Sagrada Familia</a> is now blocked from this vantage point by newer buildings. The tiles were given a metallic sheen to simulate the varying scales of the monster, with the color grading from green on the right side, where the head begins, to deep blue and violet in the center, to red and pink on the left side of the building.

One of the highlights of the facade is a tower topped with a cross of four arms oriented to the cardinal directions. It is a bulbous, root-like structure that evokes plant life. There is a second bulb-shaped structure similarly reminiscent of a thalamus flower, which is represented by a cross with arms that are actually buds announcing the next flowering. The tower is decorated with monograms of Jesus (JHS), Maria (M with the ducal crown) and Joseph (JHP), made of ceramic pieces that stand out golden on the green background that covers the facade. These symbols show the deep religiosity of Gaudi, who was inspired by the contemporaneous construction of his basilica to choose the theme of the holy family.

The bulb was broken when it was delivered, perhaps during transportation. Although the manufacturer committed to re-do the broken parts, Gaudí liked the aesthetic of the broken masonry and asked that the pieces be stuck to the main structure with lime mortar and held in with a brass ring.


The central part of the facade evokes the surface of a lake with water lilies, reminiscent of <a href="Monet">Monet</a>'s Nymphéas, with gentle ripples and reflections caused by the glass and ceramic mosaic. It is a great undulating surface covered with plaster fragments of colored glass discs combined with 330 rounds of polychrome pottery. The discs were designed by Gaudí and Jujol between tests during their stay in Majorca, while working on the restoration of the Cathedral of Palma.

Finally, above the central part of the facade is a smaller balcony, also iron, with a different exterior aesthetic, closer to a local type of lily. Two iron arms were installed here to support a pulley to raise and lower furniture.

The facade of the main floor, made entirely in sandstone, and is supported by two columns. The design is complemented by joinery windows set with multicolored stained glass. In front of the large windows, as if they were pillars that support the complex stone structure, there are six fine columns that seem to simulate the bones of a limb, with an apparent central articulation; in fact, this is a floral decoration. The rounded shapes of the gaps and the lip-like edges carved into the stone surrounding them create a semblance of a fully open mouth, for which the Casa Batlló has been nicknamed the "house of yawns." The structure repeats on the first floor and in the design of two windows at the ends forming galleries, but on the large central window there are two balconies as described above.

Park Güell

The Park Güell ( ) is a public park system composed of gardens and architectonic elements located on <a href="Carmel%20Hill">Carmel Hill</a>, in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> (<a href="Spain">Spain</a>). Carmel Hill belongs to the mountain range of <a href="Collserola">Collserola</a> – the <a href="Parc%20del%20Carmel">Parc del Carmel</a> is located on the northern face. Park Güell is located in <a href="La%20Salut">La Salut</a>, a neighborhood in the <a href="Gr%C3%A0cia%20district">Gràcia district</a> of Barcelona. With urbanization in mind, <a href="Eusebi%20G%C3%BCell">Eusebi Güell</a> assigned the design of the park to <a href="Antoni%20Gaud%C3%AD">Antoni Gaudí</a>, a renowned architect and the face of <a href="Catalan%20modernism">Catalan modernism</a>. The park was built between 1900 and 1914 and was officially opened as a public park in 1926. In 1984, <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> declared the park a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> under "<a href="Works%20of%20Antoni%20Gaud%C3%AD">Works of Antoni Gaudí</a>".

Park Güell is the reflection of Gaudí's artistic plenitude, which belongs to his <a href="naturalist">naturalist</a> phase (first decade of the 20th century). During this period, the architect perfected his personal style through inspiration from organic shapes. He put into practice a series of new structural solutions rooted in the analysis of geometry. To that, the Catalan artist adds creative liberty and an imaginative, ornamental creation. Starting from a sort of baroquism, his works acquire a structural richness of forms and volumes, free of the rational rigidity or any sort of classic premises. In the design of Park Güell, Gaudí unleashed all his architectonic genius and put to practice much of his innovative structural solutions that would become the symbol of his organic style and that would culminate in the creation of the <a href="Basilica%20and%20Expiatory%20Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Family">Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family</a> (Catalan: <a href="Sagrada%20Familia">Sagrada Familia</a>).

Güell and Gaudí conceived this park, situated within a natural park. They imagined an organized grouping of high-quality homes, decked out with all the latest technological advancements to ensure maximum comfort, finished off with an artistic touch. They also envisioned a community strongly influenced by <a href="symbolism%20%28arts%29">symbolism</a>, since, in the common elements of the park, they were trying to synthesize many of the political and religious ideals shared by patron and architect: therefore there are noticeable concepts originating from political <a href="Catalanism">Catalanism</a> – especially in the entrance stairway where the <a href="Catalan%20countries">Catalan countries</a> are represented – and from <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> – the <a href="Monumento%20al%20Calvario">Monumento al Calvario</a>, originally designed to be a <a href="chapel">chapel</a>. The <a href="mythological">mythological</a> elements are so important: apparently Güell and Gaudí's conception of the park was also inspired by the <a href="Temple%20of%20Apollo%20%28Delphi%29">Temple of Apollo</a> of <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a>.

On the other hand, many experts have tried to link the park to various symbols because of the complex <a href="iconography">iconography</a> that Gaudí applied to the urban project. Such references go from political vindication to <a href="religious">religious</a> exaltation, passing through <a href="mythology">mythology</a>, <a href="history">history</a> and <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>. Specifically, many studies claim to see references to <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a>, despite the deep religious beliefs of both Gaudí and <a href="Count%20G%C3%BCell">Count Güell</a>. These references have not been proven in the <a href="historiography">historiography</a> of the modern architect. The multiplicity of symbols found in the Park Güell is, as previously mentioned, associated to political and religious signs, with a touch of mystery according to the preferences of that time for enigmas and <a href="puzzles">puzzles</a>.

The park was originally part of a commercially unsuccessful housing site, the idea of Count <a href="Eusebi%20G%C3%BCell">Eusebi Güell</a>, after whom the park was named. It was inspired by the English <a href="garden%20city%20movement">garden city movement</a>; hence the original English name "Park" (in <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a> the name is "Parc Güell"). The site was a rocky hill with little vegetation and few trees, called "Muntanya Pelada" (Bare Mountain). It already included a large country house called Larrard House or Muntaner de Dalt House, and was next to a neighborhood of upper class houses called "La Salut" (The Health). The intention was to exploit the fresh air (well away from smoky factories) and beautiful views from the site, with sixty triangular lots being provided for luxury houses. Count Eusebi Güell added to the prestige of the development by moving in 1906 to live in Larrard House. Ultimately, only two houses were built, neither designed by Gaudí. One was intended to be a show house, but on being completed in 1904 was put up for sale, and as no buyers came forward, Gaudí, at Güell's suggestion, bought it with his savings and moved in with his family and his father in 1906. This house, where Gaudí lived from 1906 to 1926, was built by Francesc Berenguer in 1904. It contains original works by Gaudí and several of his collaborators. It is now the <a href="Gaudi%20House%20Museum">Gaudi House Museum</a> (Casa Museu Gaudí) since 1963. In 1969 it was declared a historical artistic monument of national interest.

It has since been converted into a municipal garden. It can be reached by underground railway (although the stations are at a distance from the Park and at a much lower level below the hill), by city buses, or by commercial tourist buses. Since October 2013 there is an entrance fee to visit the Monumental Zone (main entrance, terrace, and the parts containing mosaics), but the entrance to the Park remains free. Gaudí's house, "la Torre Rosa," – containing furniture that he designed – can be only visited for another entrance fee. There is a reduced rate for those wishing to see both Gaudí's house and the <a href="Sagrada%20Fam%C3%ADlia">Sagrada Família</a> Church.

Park Güell is designed and composed to bring the peace and calm that one would expect from a park. The buildings flanking the entrance, though very original and remarkable with fantastically shaped roofs with unusual pinnacles, fit in well with the use of the park as pleasure gardens and seem relatively inconspicuous in the landscape when one considers the flamboyance of other buildings designed by Gaudí. One of these buildings houses a permanent exhibition of the <a href="Barcelona%20City%20History%20Museum">Barcelona City History Museum</a> MUHBA focused on the building itself, the park and the city.

The focal point of the park is the main terrace, surrounded by a long bench in the form of a <a href="sea%20serpent">sea serpent</a>. The curves of the serpent bench form a number of enclaves, creating a more social atmosphere. Gaudí incorporated many motifs of <a href="Catalonia">Catalan</a> nationalism, and elements from religious mysticism and ancient poetry, into the Park. Much of the design of the benches was the work not of Gaudí but of his often overlooked collaborator <a href="Josep%20Maria%20Jujol">Josep Maria Jujol</a>.

Roadways around the park to service the intended houses were designed by Gaudí as structures jutting out from the steep hillside or running on viaducts, with separate footpaths in arcades formed under these structures. This minimized the intrusion of the roads, and Gaudí designed them using local stone in a way that integrates them closely into the landscape. His structures echo natural forms, with columns like tree trunks supporting branching <a href="vault%20%28architecture%29">vaulting</a> under the roadway, and the curves of vaulting and alignment of sloping columns designed in a similar way to his <a href="Church%20of%20Col%C3%B2nia%20G%C3%BCell">Church of Colònia Güell</a> so that the <a href="Inverted%20catenary">inverted catenary arch</a> shapes form perfect compression structures.

The large cross at the park's high-point offers the most complete view of Barcelona and the bay. It is possible to view the main city in panorama, with the Sagrada Família and the <a href="Montju%C3%AFc">Montjuïc</a> area visible at a distance.

The park supports a wide variety of wildlife, notably several of the non-native species of <a href="parrot">parrot</a> found in the Barcelona area. Other birds can be seen from the park, with records including <a href="Short-toed%20snake%20eagle">short-toed eagle</a>. The park also supports a population of <a href="Macroglossum%20stellatarum">hummingbird hawk moths</a>.

Casa Milà

Casa Milà (, ), popularly known as "La Pedrera" or "open quarry", a reference to its unconventional rough-hewn appearance, is a <a href="Catalan%20modernism">modernist</a> building in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>, <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, Spain. It was the last private residence designed by architect <a href="Antoni%20Gaud%C3%AD">Antoni Gaudí</a> and was built between 1906 and 1910.

The building was commissioned in 1906 by businessman and his wife . At the time, it was controversial because of its undulating stone facade, twisting <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> balconies and windows designed by <a href="Josep%20Maria%20Jujol">Josep Maria Jujol</a>. Several structural innovations include a self-supporting stone front, columns and floors free of load-bearing walls, an underground garage and sculptural elements on the roof.

In 1984, it was declared a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> by <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>. It is currently the headquarters of the which manages exhibitions and other activities at Casa Milà.

The Casa Milà was built for Roser Segimon and her husband Pere Milà. Segimon was the wealthy widow of Josep Guardiola, an "Indiano," as Spaniards returning from the American colonies with a fortune were known. Her second husband Milà was a developer known for his flamboyant lifestyle.

In June 1905, Milà bought a house on the corner of <a href="Passeig%20de%20Gr%C3%A0cia%2C%20Barcelona">Passeig de Gràcia</a> and ; Gaudí was hired in September to design a new home, and on February 2, 1906, the project was approved by the city council. It was decided to demolish the existing building rather than rebuilding it, as had been done in the case of the <a href="Casa%20Batll%C3%B3">Casa Batlló</a>. The building was completed in December 1910, and in October 1911 the Milàs moved in. On October 31, 1912, the other floors of the building were ready to be rented out.

Gaudí, a Catholic and a devotee of the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a>, planned for the Casa Milà to be a spiritual symbol. Overt religious elements include an excerpt from the <a href="Rosary">Rosary</a> on the cornice and planned statues of Mary, specifically <a href="Our%20Lady%20of%20the%20Rosary">Our Lady of the Rosary</a>, and two <a href="archangels">archangels</a>, <a href="St.%20Michael">St. Michael</a> and <a href="St.%20Gabriel">St. Gabriel</a>.

However, the Casa Milà was not built entirely to Gaudí's specifications. The local government ordered the demolition of elements that exceeded the height standard for the city, and fined the Milàs for many infractions of <a href="building%20code">building code</a>s. After <a href="Tragic%20Week%20%28Catalonia%29">Semana Trágica</a>, an outbreak of <a href="anticlericalism">anticlericalism</a> in the city, Milà prudently decided to forgo the religious statues. Gaudí contemplated abandoning the project but a priest persuaded him to continue.

In 1940, Milà died. Segimon sold the property in 1946 for 18 million pesetas to Josep Ballvé i Pellisé, known for his department stores on , in partnership with the family of Pío Rubert Laporta. The Compañía Inmobiliaria Provenza, SA (CIPSA) was founded to administer the building. Roser Segimon continued to live on the main floor until her death in 1964.
The new owners divided the first floor facing into five apartments instead of the original two. In 1953, they commissioned to convert 13 rubbish-filled attic laundry rooms to street-facing apartments, leaving a communal hallway on the side facing the courtyards. Some of these two or three room apartments had a <a href="loft">loft</a> and were designed and furnished in a typical early 1950s style using brick, ceramic and wood. Items of furniture, such as the , were reminiscent of <a href="Eero%20Saarinen">Eero Saarinen</a>'s work.

The insurance company Northern took over the main floor in 1966. By then, Casa Milà had housed a <a href="bingo%20hall">bingo hall</a>, an academy and the offices of Cementos Molins and Inoxcrom among others. Maintenance costs were high and the owners had allowed the building to become dilapidated, causing stones to loosen in 1971. Josep Anton Comas made some emergency repairs, especially to the paintings in the courtyards, while respecting the original design.

Gaudí's work was designated a historic and artistic <a href="monument">monument</a> on July 24, 1969. Casa Milà was in poor condition in the early 1980s. It had been painted a dreary brown and many of its interior color schemes had been abandoned or allowed to deteriorate, but it has been restored since and many of the original colors revived.

In 1984 the building became part of a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> encompassing some of Gaudí's works. The Barcelonan city council tried to rent the main floor as an office for the <a href="1992%20Summer%20Olympics">1992 Olympic</a> bid. Finally, the day before <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> 1986, <a href="Caixa%20Catalunya">Caixa Catalunya</a> bought La Pedrera for 900 million pesetas. On February 19, 1987, urgently needed work began on the restoration and cleaning of the façade. The work was done by the architects Joseph Emilio Hernández-Cross and Rafael Vila. The renovated main floor opened in 1990 as part of the <a href="Cultural%20Olympiad">Cultural Olympiad</a> of Barcelona. The floor became an exhibition room with an example of <a href="modernism">modernism</a> in the <a href="Eixample">Eixample</a>.

The building is 1,323 m per floor on a plot of 1,620 m. Gaudí made the first sketches in his workshop in the <a href="Sagrada%20Fam%C3%ADlia">Sagrada Família</a>. He designed the house as a constant curve, both outside and inside, incorporating <a href="ruled%20surface">ruled geometry</a> and naturalistic elements.

Casa Milà consists of two buildings, which are structured around two courtyards that provide light to the nine storeys: basement, ground floor, mezzanine, main (or noble) floor, four upper floors, and an attic. The basement was intended to be the garage, the main floor the residence of the Milàs (a flat of all 1,323 m), and the rest distributed over 20 apartments. The resulting layout is shaped like an asymmetrical "8" because of the different shapes and sizes of the courtyards. The attic housed the laundry and drying areas, forming an insulating space for the building and simultaneously determining the levels of the roof.

One of the most notable elements of the building is the roof, crowned with skylights, staircase exits, fans, and chimneys. All of these elements, constructed out of brick covered with lime, <a href="trencad%C3%ADs">broken marble, or glass</a> have a specific architectural function but are also real sculptures integrated into the building.

The apartments feature plastered ceilings with dynamic reliefs, handcrafted wooden doors, windows, and furniture, as well as <a href="hydraulic%20tile">hydraulic tile</a>s and various ornamental elements.

The stairways were intended as service entries, with the main access to the apartments by elevator except for the noble floor, where Gaudí added a prominent interior staircase. Gaudí wanted the people who lived in the flats to all know each other. Therefore, there were only elevators on every other floor, so people on different floors would meet one another.

Casa Milà is characterized by its self-supporting stone facade, meaning that it is free of load-bearing walls. The facade connects to the internal structure of each floor by means of curved iron beams surrounding the perimeter of each floor. This construction system allows, on one hand, large openings in the facade which give light to the homes, and on the other, free structuring of the different levels, so that internal walls can be added and demolished without affecting the stability of the building. This allows the owners to change their minds at will and to modify, without problems, the interior layout of the homes.

The facade is composed of large blocks of <a href="limestone">limestone</a> from the <a href="Garraf%20Massif">Garraf Massif</a> on the first floor and from the <a href="Villefranche-de-Conflent">Villefranche</a> quarry for the higher levels. The blocks were cut to follow the plot of the projection of the model, then raised to their location and adjusted to align in a continuous curve to the pieces around them.

Viewed from the outside the building has three parts: the main body of the six-storey blocks with winding stone floors, two floors set a block back with a different curve, similar to waves, a smoother texture and whiter color, and with small holes that look like <a href="embrasure">embrasure</a>s, and finally the body of the roof.

Gaudí's original facade had some of its lower-level ironwork removed. In 1928, the tailor Mosella opened the first store in La Pedrera, and he eliminated the bars. This did not concern anyone, because in the middle of twentieth century, wrought ironwork had little importance. The ironwork was lost until a few years later, when Americans donated one of them to the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art%20in%20New%20York">MoMa</a>, where it is on display.

With restoration initiatives launched in 1987, the facade was rejoined to some pieces of stone that had fallen. In order to respect the fidelity of the original, material was obtained from the Villefranche quarry, even though by then it was no longer operating.

The building uses a completely original solution to solve the issue of a lobby being too closed and dark. Its open and airy courtyards provide a place of transit and are directly visible to those accessing the building. There are two patios on the side of the Passeig de Gracia and of the street Provence.


Patios, structurally, are key as supporting loads of interior facades. The floor of the courtyard is supported by pillars of <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a>. In the courtyard, there are traditional elliptical beams and girders but Gaudí applied an ingenious solution of using two concentric cylindrical beams with stretched radial beams, like the spokes of a bicycle. They form a point outside of the beam to two points above and below, making the function of the central girder a <a href="Keystone%20%28architecture%29">keystone</a> and working in tension and compression simultaneously. This supported structure is twelve feet in diameter and is considered "the soul of the building" with a clear resemblance to Gothic crypts. The centerpiece was built in a shipyard by <a href="Josep%20Maria%20Carandell">Josep Maria Carandell</a> who copied a steering wheel, interpreting Gaudí's intent as to represent the helm of the ship of life.


Access is protected by a massive <a href="iron">iron</a> gate with a design attributed to Jujol. It was originally used by both people and cars, as access to the garage is in the basement, now an <a href="auditorium">auditorium</a>.

The two halls are fully polychrome with oil <a href="Mural%20paintings%20in%20the%20lobby%20of%20the%20Casa%20Mila">paintings</a> on the plaster surfaces, with <a href="eclecticism">eclectic</a> references to <a href="mythology">mythology</a> and flowers.

During construction there was a problem including a basement as a garage for cars, the new invention that was thrilling the bourgeois at the time. The future neighbor Felix Anthony Meadows, owner of Industrial Linera, requested a change because his <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Motor%20Cars">Rolls Royce</a> could not access it. Gaudí agreed to remove a pillar on the ramp that led into the garage so that Felix, who was establishing sales and factory in <a href="Walls%20of%20Valles">Walls of Valles</a>, could go to both places with his car from La Pedrera. 

For the floors of Casa Milà, Gaudí used a model of <a href="floor">floor</a> forms of square timbers with two colors, and the <a href="hydraulic%20pavement">hydraulic pavement</a> hexagonal pieces of blue and sea motifs that had originally been designed for the Batllo house. The wax was designed in gray by John Bertrand under the supervision of Gaudí who "touched up with their own fingers," in the words of the manufacturer <a href="Josep%20Bay">Josep Bay</a>.

Like in <a href="Casa%20Batll%C3%B3">Casa Batlló</a>, Gaudí shows the application of the <a href="catenary%20arch">catenary arch</a> as a support structure for the roof, a form which he had already used shortly after graduating in the wood frameworks of <a href="Matar%C3%B3">Mataró</a>'s cooperative known as "L'Obrera Mataronense." In this case, Gaudí used the Catalan technique of <a href="Catalan%20vault">timbrel</a>, imported from <a href="Italy">Italy</a> in the fourteenth century.

The attic, where the laundry rooms were located, was a clear room under a <a href="Catalan%20vault">Catalan vault</a> roof supported by 270 <a href="parabolic%20vault">parabolic vault</a>s of different heights and spaced by about 80 cm. The roof resembles both the ribs of a huge animal and a palm, giving the roof-deck a very unconventional shape similar to a landscape of hills and valleys. The shape and location of the courtyards makes the arches higher when the space is narrowed and lower when the space expands.

The builder Bayó explained its construction: "First the face of a wide wall was filled with mortar and plastered. Then <a href="Josep%20Canaleta%20i%20Cuadras">Canaleta</a> indicated the opening of each arch and Bayó put a nail at each starting point of the arch at the top of the wall. From these nails was dangled a chain so that the lowest point coincided with the deflection of the arch. Then the profile displayed on the wall by the chain was drawn and on this profile the carpenter marked and placed the corresponding centering, and the timbrel vault was started with three rows of plane bricks. Gaudí wanted to add a longitudinal axis of bricks connecting all vaults at their keystones".

The work of Gaudí on the rooftop of La Pedrera brought his experience at <a href="Palau%20G%C3%BCell">Palau Güell</a> together with solutions that were clearly more innovative – this time creating shapes and volumes with more body, more prominence, and less polychromasia. <Permanyer, either 1996 or 2008>

On the rooftop there are six skylights/staircase exits (four of which were covered with broken pottery and some that ended in a double cross typical of Gaudí), twenty-eight chimneys in several groupings, two half-hidden vents whose function is to renew the air in the building, and four domes that discharged to the facade. The staircases also house the water tanks; some of which are snail-shaped.

The stepped roof of La Pedrera, called "the garden of warriors" by the poet <a href="Pere%20Gimferrer">Pere Gimferrer</a> because the chimneys appear to be protecting the skylights, has undergone a radical restoration, removing chimneys added in interventions after Gaudí, television antennas, and other elements that degraded the space. The restoration brought back the splendor to the chimneys and the skylights that were covered with fragments of <a href="marble">marble</a> and broken <a href="tile%20Valencia">Valencia tiles</a>. One of the chimneys was topped with glass pieces – it was said that Gaudí did that the day after the inauguration of the building, taking advantage of the empty bottles from the party. It was restored with the bases of champagne bottles from the early twentieth century. The repair work has enabled the restoration of the original impact of the overhangs made of stone from <a href="Ulldecona">Ulldecona</a> with fragments of tiles. This whole set is more colorful than the facade, although here the creamy tones are dominant.

Gaudí, as he had done in Casa Batlló, designed furniture specifically for the main floor. This was part of the concept artwork itself integral to <a href="modernism">modernism</a> in which the architect assumed responsibility for global issues such as the structure and the facade, as well as every detail of the decor, designing furniture and accessories such as lamps, planters, floors or ceilings.

This was another point of friction with Segimon, who complained that there was no straight wall to place her Steinway piano. Gaudí's response was blunt: "So play the violin." The result of these disagreements has been the loss of the decorative legacy of Gaudí, as most of the furniture was removed due to climate change and the changes she made to the main floor when Gaudí died. Some remain in private collections, including a curtain made of <a href="oak">oak</a> 4 m. long by 1.96 m. high in the Museum of Catalan Modernism; and a chair and desktop of Milà.

Gaudí carved oak doors similar to what he had done for the Casa y Bardes, but these were only included on two floors as when Segimon discovered the price, she decided there would be no more at that quality.

"Casa Milà" is part of the <a href="UNESCO%20World%20Heritage%20Site">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a> "Works of <a href="Antoni%20Gaud%C3%AD">Antoni Gaudí</a>". It was a predecessor of some buildings with a similar <a href="biomorphism">biomorphic</a> appearance:

Free exhibitions often are held on the first floor, which also provides some opportunity to see the interior design. There is a charge for entrance to the apartment on the fourth floor and the roof. The other floors are not open to visitors.

Gaudí's La Pedrera was inspired by a mountain, but there is no agreement as to which mountain was the reference model. Joan Bergós thought it was the rocks of Fray Guerau in <a href="Prades%20mountains">Prades mountains</a>. Joan Matamala thought that the model could have been St. Miquel del Fai, while the sculptor Vicente Vilarubias believed it was inspired by the cliffs Torrent Pareis in <a href="Menorca">Menorca</a>. Other options include the mountains of Uçhisar in <a href="Cappadocia">Cappadocia</a>, suggested by Juan Goytisolo, or Mola Gallifa, suggested by Louis Permanyer, based on the fact that Gaudí visited the area in 1885, fleeing an outbreak of cholera in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>.

Some people say that the interior layout of La Pedrera comes from studies that Gaudí made of medieval fortresses. This image is reinforced by the seeming appearance of the rooftop chimneys as "sentinels" with great helmets. The structure of the iron door in the lobby does not follow any symmetry, straight or repetitive pattern. Rather, it evokes bubbles of <a href="soap">soap</a> that are formed between the hands or the structures of a plant cell.

The building's unconventional style made it the subject of much criticism. It was given the nickname "La Pedrera", meaning "the quarry". Casa Milà appeared in many satirical magazines. <a href="Joan%20Junceda">Joan Junceda</a> presented it as a traditional "Easter cake" by means of cartoons in "<a href="Patufet">Patufet</a>". Joaquim Garcia made a joke about the difficulty of setting the damask wrought iron balconies in his magazine. Homeowners in <a href="Passeig%20de%20Gracia">Passeig de Gracia</a> became angry with Milà and ceased to greet him, arguing that the weird building by Gaudí would lower the price of land in the area.

Casa Milà also caused some administrative problems. In December 1907 the <a href="City%20Council">City Hall</a> stopped work on the building because of a pillar which occupied part of the sidewalk, not respecting the alignment of facades. Again on August 17, 1908, more problems occurred when the building surpassed the predicted height and borders of its construction site by . The Council called for a fine of 100,000 <a href="Spanish%20peseta">peseta</a>s (approximately 25% of the cost of work) or for the demolition of the attic and roof. The dispute was resolved a year and a half later, December 28, 1909, when the Commission certified that it was a monumental building and thus not required to have a 'strict compliance' with the bylaws.

The owner entered La Pedrera in the annual sponsored by the Barcelona City Council ("<a href="Ayuntamiento%20%28Spain%29">Ayuntament</a>"). Other entries in the competition included two works by <a href="Enric%20Sagnier">Sagnier</a> (Calle Mallorca 264, and one on Corsica and <a href="Avinguda%20Diagonal">Av. Diagonal</a>), the by architect , and the , designed by . Although the most dramatic and clear favorite was Casa Milà, the jury opined that even though the facades were complete, "there's still a lot left to do before it's fully completed, finalized and in a perfect state of appreciation." The winner in 1910 was Samanillo Perez, for his building which now houses the headquarters of the <a href="http%3A//guiadenoticias.net/2017/04/21/gustavo-mirabal-le-da-valor-a-la-hipica-espanola/"></a> <a href="http%3A//guiadenoticias.net/2017/04/21/gustavo-mirabal-le-da-valor-a-la-hipica-espanola/">Circulo Ecuestre</a>.

Gaudí's relations with Segimon deteriorated during the construction and decoration of the house. There were many disagreements between them, one example was the monumental bronze virgin del Rosario, which Gaudí wanted as the statute on the front of the building in homage to the name of the owner, that the artist Carles Mani i Roig was to sculpt. The statue was not made although the words "Ave gratia" M" full Dominus tecum" were written at the top of the facade. Continuing disagreements led Gaudí to take Milà to court over his fees. The lawsuit was won by Gaudí in 1916, and he gave the 105,000 pesetas he won in the case to charity, stating that "the principles mattered more than money." Milà was having to pay the mortgage.

After Gaudí's death in 1926, Segimon got rid of most of the furniture that Gaudí had designed and covered over parts of Gaudí's designs with new decorations in the style of <a href="Louis%20XVI">Louis XVI</a>. La Pedrera was acquired in 1986 by and when restoration was done four years later, some of the original decorations re-emerged.

When the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> broke out in July 1936, the Milàs were on vacation. Part of the building was collectivized by the <a href="Unified%20Socialist%20Party%20of%20Catalonia">Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia</a>; the Milàs fled the area with some artwork.

Antiparticle

In <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a>, corresponding to most kinds of <a href="particle%20physics">particles</a> there is an associated antiparticle with the same <a href="mass">mass</a> and opposite <a href="charge%20%28physics%29">charge</a> (including <a href="electric%20charge">electric charge</a>). For example, the antiparticle of the <a href="electron">electron</a> is the <a href="positron">positron (antielectron)</a>, which has positive charge and is produced naturally in certain types of <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive decay</a>. The opposite is also true: the antiparticle of the positron is the electron.

Some particles, such as the <a href="photon">photon</a>, are their own antiparticle. Otherwise, for each pair of antiparticle partners, one is designated as normal matter (the kind we are made of), and the other (usually given the prefix "anti-") as in "<a href="antimatter">antimatter</a>".

Particle–antiparticle pairs can <a href="particle%20annihilation">annihilate</a> each other, producing <a href="photon">photon</a>s; since the charges of the particle and antiparticle are opposite, total charge is conserved. For example, the positrons produced in natural radioactive decay quickly annihilate themselves with electrons, producing pairs of <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s, a process exploited in <a href="positron%20emission%20tomography">positron emission tomography</a>.

The laws of nature are very nearly symmetrical with respect to particles and antiparticles. For example, an <a href="antiproton">antiproton</a> and a <a href="positron">positron</a> can form an <a href="antihydrogen">antihydrogen</a> <a href="atom">atom</a>, which is believed to have the same properties as a <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> atom. This leads to the question of why the <a href="baryogenesis">formation of matter after the Big Bang</a> resulted in a universe consisting almost entirely of matter, rather than being a half-and-half mixture of matter and <a href="antimatter">antimatter</a>. The discovery of <a href="CP%20violation">Charge Parity violation</a> helped to shed light on this problem by showing that this symmetry, originally thought to be perfect, was only approximate.

Antiparticles are produced naturally in <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>, and in the interaction of <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a>s in the Earth's atmosphere.
Because charge is conserved, it is not possible to create an antiparticle without either destroying a particle of the same charge (as in <a href="Beta%20decay%23%CE%B2%2B%20decay"> decay</a>, when a proton (positive charge) is destroyed, a neutron created and a positron (positive charge, antiparticle) is also created and emitted) or by creating a particle of the opposite charge. The latter is seen in many processes in which both a particle and its antiparticle are created simultaneously, as in <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a>s. This is the inverse of the <a href="particle%E2%80%93antiparticle%20annihilation">particle–antiparticle annihilation</a> process.

Although particles and their antiparticles have opposite charges, electrically neutral particles need not be identical to their antiparticles. The neutron, for example, is made out of <a href="quark">quark</a>s, the <a href="antineutron">antineutron</a> from <a href="Quark%23Antiquarks">antiquarks</a>, and they are distinguishable from one another because neutrons and antineutrons annihilate each other upon contact. However, other neutral particles are their own antiparticles, such as <a href="photon">photon</a>s, <a href="W%20and%20Z%20bosons%23Z%20boson">Z bosons</a>, <a href="Pi%20meson"></a> <a href="meson">meson</a>s, and hypothetical <a href="graviton">graviton</a>s and some hypothetical <a href="Weakly%20interacting%20massive%20particle">WIMP</a>s.

In 1932, soon after the prediction of <a href="positron">positron</a>s by <a href="Paul%20Dirac">Paul Dirac</a>, <a href="Carl%20D.%20Anderson">Carl D. Anderson</a> found that cosmic-ray collisions produced these particles in a <a href="cloud%20chamber">cloud chamber</a>— a <a href="particle%20detector">particle detector</a> in which moving <a href="electron">electron</a>s (or positrons) leave behind trails as they move through the gas. The electric charge-to-mass ratio of a particle can be measured by observing the radius of curling of its cloud-chamber track in a <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>. Positrons, because of the direction that their paths curled, were at first mistaken for electrons travelling in the opposite direction. Positron paths in a cloud-chamber trace the same helical path as an electron but rotate in the opposite direction with respect to the magnetic field direction due to their having the same magnitude of charge-to-mass ratio but with opposite charge and, therefore, opposite signed charge-to-mass ratios.

The <a href="antiproton">antiproton</a> and <a href="antineutron">antineutron</a> were found by <a href="Emilio%20Segr%C3%A8">Emilio Segrè</a> and <a href="Owen%20Chamberlain">Owen Chamberlain</a> in 1955 at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>. Since then, the antiparticles of many other subatomic particles have been created in particle accelerator experiments. In recent years, complete atoms of <a href="antimatter">antimatter</a> have been assembled out of antiprotons and positrons, collected in electromagnetic traps.

Solutions of the <a href="Dirac%20equation">Dirac equation</a> contained negative energy quantum states. As a result, an electron could always radiate energy and fall into a negative energy state. Even worse, it could keep radiating infinite amounts of energy because there were infinitely many negative energy states available. To prevent this unphysical situation from happening, Dirac proposed that a "sea" of negative-energy electrons fills the universe, already occupying all of the lower-energy states so that, due to the <a href="Pauli%20exclusion%20principle">Pauli exclusion principle</a>, no other electron could fall into them. Sometimes, however, one of these negative-energy particles could be lifted out of this <a href="Dirac%20sea">Dirac sea</a> to become a positive-energy particle. But, when lifted out, it would leave behind a "<a href="electron%20hole">hole</a>" in the sea that would act exactly like a positive-energy electron with a reversed charge. These he interpreted as "negative-energy electrons" and attempted to identify them with <a href="proton">proton</a>s in his 1930 paper "A Theory of Electrons and Protons" However, these "negative-energy electrons" turned out to be <a href="positron">positron</a>s, and not <a href="proton">proton</a>s.

This picture implied an infinite negative charge for the universe—a problem of which Dirac was aware. Dirac tried to argue that we would perceive this as the normal state of zero charge. Another difficulty was the difference in masses of the electron and the proton. Dirac tried to argue that this was due to the electromagnetic interactions with the sea, until <a href="Hermann%20Weyl">Hermann Weyl</a> proved that hole theory was completely symmetric between negative and positive charges. Dirac also predicted a reaction  +  →  + , where an electron and a proton annihilate to give two photons. <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a> and <a href="Igor%20Tamm">Igor Tamm</a> proved that this would cause ordinary matter to disappear too fast. A year later, in 1931, Dirac modified his theory and postulated the positron, a new particle of the same mass as the electron. The discovery of this particle the next year removed the last two objections to his theory.

However, the problem of infinite charge of the universe remains. Also, as we now know, <a href="bosons">bosons</a> also have antiparticles, but since bosons do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle (only <a href="fermion">fermion</a>s do), hole theory does not work for them. A unified interpretation of antiparticles is now available in <a href="quantum%20field%20theory">quantum field theory</a>, which solves both these problems.

If a particle and antiparticle are in the appropriate quantum states, then they can annihilate each other and produce other particles. Reactions such as  +  →   +  (the two-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair) are an example. The single-photon annihilation of an electron-positron pair,  +  → , cannot occur in free space because it is impossible to conserve energy and <a href="momentum">momentum</a> together in this process. However, in the Coulomb field of a nucleus the <a href="translational%20invariance">translational invariance</a> is broken and single-photon annihilation may occur. The reverse reaction (in free space, without an atomic nucleus) is also impossible for this reason. In quantum field theory, this process is allowed only as an intermediate quantum state for times short enough that the violation of energy conservation can be accommodated by the <a href="uncertainty%20principle">uncertainty principle</a>. This opens the way for virtual pair production or annihilation in which a one particle quantum state may "fluctuate" into a two particle state and back. These processes are important in the <a href="vacuum%20state">vacuum state</a> and <a href="renormalization">renormalization</a> of a quantum field theory. It also opens the way for neutral particle mixing through processes such as the one pictured here, which is a complicated example of <a href="mass%20renormalization">mass renormalization</a>.

<a href="Quantum%20state">Quantum state</a>s of a particle and an antiparticle can be interchanged by applying the <a href="C-symmetry">charge conjugation</a> (C), <a href="P-symmetry">parity</a> (P), and <a href="T-symmetry">time reversal</a> (T) operators. If formula_1 denotes the quantum state of a particle (n) with momentum p, spin J whose component in the z-direction is σ, then one has
where n denotes the charge conjugate state, that is, the antiparticle. This behaviour under <a href="CPT%20symmetry">CPT symmetry</a> is the same as the statement that the particle and its antiparticle lie in the same <a href="irreducible%20representation">irreducible representation</a> of the <a href="Poincar%C3%A9%20group">Poincaré group</a>. Properties of antiparticles can be related to those of particles through this. If T is a good symmetry of the dynamics, then
where the proportionality sign indicates that there might be a phase on the right hand side. In other words, particle and antiparticle must have

One may try to quantize an electron <a href="field%20%28physics%29">field</a> without mixing the annihilation and creation operators by writing

where we use the symbol "k" to denote the quantum numbers "p" and σ of the previous section and the sign of the energy, "E(k)", and "a" denotes the corresponding annihilation operators. Of course, since we are dealing with <a href="fermion">fermion</a>s, we have to have the operators satisfy canonical anti-commutation relations. However, if one now writes down the <a href="Hamiltonian%20%28quantum%20mechanics%29">Hamiltonian</a>

then one sees immediately that the expectation value of "H" need not be positive. This is because "E(k)" can have any sign whatsoever, and the combination of creation and annihilation operators has expectation value 1 or 0.

So one has to introduce the charge conjugate "antiparticle" field, with its own creation and annihilation operators satisfying the relations

where "k" has the same "p", and opposite σ and sign of the energy. Then one can rewrite the field in the form

where the first sum is over positive energy states and the second over those of negative energy. The energy becomes

where "E" is an infinite negative constant. The <a href="vacuum%20state">vacuum state</a> is defined as the state with no particle or antiparticle, "i.e.", formula_11 and formula_12. Then the energy of the vacuum is exactly "E". Since all energies are measured relative to the vacuum, H is positive definite. Analysis of the properties of "a" and "b" shows that one is the annihilation operator for particles and the other for antiparticles. This is the case of a <a href="fermion">fermion</a>.

This approach is due to <a href="Vladimir%20Fock">Vladimir Fock</a>, <a href="Wendell%20Furry">Wendell Furry</a> and <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a>. If one quantizes a real <a href="Scalar%20field%20theory">scalar field</a>, then one finds that there is only one kind of annihilation operator; therefore, real scalar fields describe neutral bosons. Since complex scalar fields admit two different kinds of annihilation operators, which are related by conjugation, such fields describe charged bosons.

By considering the propagation of the negative energy modes of the electron field backward in time, <a href="Ernst%20Stueckelberg">Ernst Stueckelberg</a> reached a pictorial understanding of the fact that the particle and antiparticle have equal mass m and spin J but opposite charges q. This allowed him to rewrite <a href="perturbation%20theory%20%28quantum%20mechanics%29">perturbation theory</a> precisely in the form of diagrams. <a href="Richard%20Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> later gave an independent systematic derivation of these diagrams from a particle formalism, and they are now called <a href="Feynman%20diagram">Feynman diagram</a>s. Each line of a diagram represents a particle propagating either backward or forward in time. This technique is the most widespread method of computing amplitudes in quantum field theory today.

Since this picture was first developed by Stueckelberg, and acquired its modern form in Feynman's work, it is called the Feynman–Stueckelberg interpretation of antiparticles to honor both scientists.

As a consequence of this interpretation, <a href="Massimo%20Villata">Villata</a> argued that the assumption of antimatter as CPT-transformed matter would imply that the <a href="Gravitational%20interaction%20of%20antimatter">gravitational interaction between matter and antimatter</a> is repulsive.

In 1986, he was a founding member of <a href="N.W.A">N.W.A</a> but when fellow member <a href="Ice%20Cube">Ice Cube</a> came back from the Phoenix Institute of Technology in 1988, Arabian Prince soon after left over royalty and contract disagreements—<a href="Eazy-E">Eazy-E</a>, Ice Cube and <a href="MC%20Ren">MC Ren</a> were the main performers, <a href="DJ%20Yella">DJ Yella</a> was the <a href="turntablist">turntablist</a> and <a href="Dr.%20Dre">Dr. Dre</a> was the main producer.

After leaving N.W.A, Arabian Prince began a solo career. His first album, "<a href="Brother%20Arab">Brother Arab</a>", was released in 1989; "<a href="Where%27s%20My%20Bytches">Where's My Bytches</a>" followed in 1993.

In the mid-2000s, he started releasing music again, with his Professor X project on the Dutch label Clone Records. In 2007 he performed as a DJ on the 2K Sports Holiday Bounce Tour with artists from the <a href="Stones%20Throw">Stones Throw</a> label. In 2008, Stones Throw released a compilation of his electro-rap material from the 1980s. One of his songs was included on the 2007 video game, "<a href="College%20Hoops%202K8">College Hoops 2K8</a>".

Associative property

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, the associative property is a property of some <a href="binary%20operation">binary operation</a>s. In <a href="propositional%20logic">propositional logic</a>, associativity is a <a href="validity">valid</a> <a href="rule%20of%20replacement">rule of replacement</a> for <a href="well-formed%20formula">expressions</a> in <a href="Formal%20proof">logical proofs</a>.

Within an expression containing two or more occurrences in a row of the same associative operator, the order in which the <a href="Operation%20%28mathematics%29">operations</a> are performed does not matter as long as the sequence of the <a href="operand">operand</a>s is not changed. That is, rearranging the <a href="parentheses">parentheses</a> in such an expression will not change its value. Consider the following equations:

Even though the parentheses were rearranged on each line, the values of the expressions were not altered. Since this holds true when performing addition and multiplication on any <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s, it can be said that "addition and multiplication of real numbers are associative operations".

Associativity is not the same as <a href="commutativity">commutativity</a>, which addresses whether or not the order of two <a href="operand">operand</a>s changes the result. For example, the order doesn't matter in the multiplication of real numbers, that is, , so we say that the multiplication of real numbers is a commutative operation.

Associative operations are abundant in mathematics; in fact, many <a href="algebraic%20structure">algebraic structure</a>s (such as <a href="semigroup%20%28mathematics%29">semigroups</a> and <a href="category%20%28mathematics%29">categories</a>) explicitly require their binary operations to be associative.

However, many important and interesting operations are non-associative; some examples include <a href="subtraction">subtraction</a>, <a href="exponentiation">exponentiation</a>, and the <a href="vector%20cross%20product">vector cross product</a>. In contrast to the theoretical properties of real numbers, the addition of <a href="floating%20point">floating point</a> numbers in computer science is not associative, and the choice of how to associate an expression can have a significant effect on rounding error.

Formally, a <a href="binary%20operation">binary operation</a> ∗ on a <a href="Set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a> "S" is called associative if it satisfies the associative law:

Here, ∗ is used to replace the symbol of the operation, which may be any symbol, and even the absence of symbol (<a href="wikt%3Ajuxtaposition">juxtaposition</a>) as for <a href="multiplication">multiplication</a>.

The associative law can also be expressed in functional notation thus: .

If a binary operation is associative, repeated application of the operation produces the same result regardless how valid pairs of parenthesis are inserted in the expression. This is called the generalized associative law. For instance, a product of four elements may be written in five possible ways:


If the product operation is associative, the generalized associative law says that all these formulas will yield the same result, making the parenthesis unnecessary. Thus "the" product can be written unambiguously as

As the number of elements increases, the <a href="Catalan%20number%23Applications%20in%20combinatorics">number of possible ways to insert parentheses</a> grows quickly, but they remain unnecessary for disambiguation.

Some examples of associative operations include the following.




In standard truth-functional propositional logic, "association", or "associativity" are two <a href="validity">valid</a> <a href="rule%20of%20replacement">rules of replacement</a>. The rules allow one to move parentheses in <a href="well-formed%20formula">logical expressions</a> in <a href="formal%20proof">logical proofs</a>. The rules are:
and
where "formula_10" is a <a href="metalogic">metalogic</a>al <a href="Symbol%20%28formal%29">symbol</a> representing "can be replaced in a <a href="Formal%20proof">proof</a> with."

"Associativity" is a property of some <a href="logical%20connective">logical connective</a>s of truth-functional <a href="propositional%20logic">propositional logic</a>. The following <a href="logical%20equivalence">logical equivalence</a>s demonstrate that associativity is a property of particular connectives. The following are truth-functional <a href="tautology%20%28logic%29">tautologies</a>.

Associativity of disjunction:
Associativity of conjunction:
Associativity of equivalence:

A binary operation formula_17 on a set "S" that does not satisfy the associative law is called non-associative. Symbolically,

For such an operation the order of evaluation "does" matter. For example:
Also note that infinite sums are not generally associative, for example:
whereas

The study of non-associative structures arises from reasons somewhat different from the mainstream of classical algebra. One area within <a href="non-associative%20algebra">non-associative algebra</a> that has grown very large is that of <a href="Lie%20algebra">Lie algebra</a>s. There the associative law is replaced by the <a href="Jacobi%20identity">Jacobi identity</a>. Lie algebras abstract the essential nature of <a href="infinitesimal%20transformation">infinitesimal transformation</a>s, and have become ubiquitous in mathematics.

There are other specific types of non-associative structures that have been studied in depth; these tend to come from some specific applications or areas such as <a href="combinatorial%20mathematics">combinatorial mathematics</a>. Other examples are <a href="Quasigroup">Quasigroup</a>, <a href="Quasifield">Quasifield</a>, <a href="Non-associative%20ring">Non-associative ring</a>, <a href="Non-associative%20algebra">Non-associative algebra</a> and <a href="Commutative%20non-associative%20magmas">Commutative non-associative magmas</a>.

In mathematics, addition and multiplication of real numbers is associative. By contrast, in computer science, the addition and multiplication of <a href="floating%20point">floating point</a> numbers is "not" associative, as rounding errors are introduced when dissimilar-sized values are joined together.

To illustrate this, consider a floating point representation with a 4-bit mantissa:
(1.000×2 +
1.000×2) +
1.000×2 =
1.000×2 +
1.000×2 =
1.00×2
1.000×2 +
(1.000×2 +
1.000×2) =
1.000×2 +
1.00×2 =
1.00×2

Even though most computers compute with a 24 or 53 bits of mantissa, this is an important source of rounding error, and approaches such as the <a href="Kahan%20summation%20algorithm">Kahan summation algorithm</a> are ways to minimise the errors. It can be especially problematic in parallel computing.

In general, parentheses must be used to indicate the <a href="order%20of%20operations">order of evaluation</a> if a non-associative operation appears more than once in an expression. However, <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a>s agree on a particular order of evaluation for several common non-associative operations. This is simply a notational convention to avoid parentheses.

A left-associative operation is a non-associative operation that is conventionally evaluated from left to right, i.e.,
while a right-associative operation is conventionally evaluated from right to left:
Both left-associative and right-associative operations occur. Left-associative operations include the following:

Right-associative operations include the following:



Non-associative operations for which no conventional evaluation order is defined include the following.

Apache Software Foundation

The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is an American <a href="non-profit%20corporation">non-profit corporation</a> (classified as <a href="501%28c%29%23501%28c%29%283%29">501(c)(3)</a> in the United States) to support Apache software projects, including the <a href="Apache%20HTTP%20Server">Apache HTTP Server</a>. The ASF was formed from the Apache Group and incorporated in <a href="Delaware%20corporation">Delaware</a>, U.S., in June 1999.

The Apache Software Foundation is a decentralized open source community of developers. The software they produce is distributed under the terms of the <a href="Apache%20License">Apache License</a> and is <a href="free%20and%20open-source%20software">free and open-source software</a> (FOSS). The Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based development process and an open and pragmatic software license. Each project is managed by a self-selected team of technical experts who are active contributors to the project. The ASF is a <a href="meritocracy">meritocracy</a>, implying that membership of the foundation is granted only to volunteers who have actively contributed to Apache projects. The ASF is considered a second generation open-source organization, in that commercial support is provided without the risk of <a href="platform%20lock-in">platform lock-in</a>.

Among the ASF's objectives are: to provide legal protection to volunteers working on Apache projects; to prevent the "Apache" brand name from being used by other organizations without permission.

The ASF also holds several ApacheCon conferences each year, highlighting Apache projects and related technology.

The history of the Apache Software Foundation is linked to the Apache HTTP Server, development beginning in February 1993. A group of eight developers started working on enhancing the <a href="NCSA%20HTTPd">NCSA HTTPd</a> <a href="Daemon%20%28computing%29">daemon</a>. They came to be known as the Apache Group. On March 25, 1999, the Apache Software Foundation was formed. The first official meeting of the Apache Software Foundation was held on April 13, 1999, and by general consent that the initial membership list of the Apache Software Foundation, would be: <a href="Brian%20Behlendorf">Brian Behlendorf</a>, <a href="Ken%20Coar">Ken Coar</a>, Miguel Gonzales, Mark Cox, <a href="Lars%20Eilebrecht">Lars Eilebrecht</a>, Ralf S. Engelschall, <a href="Roy%20Fielding">Roy T. Fielding</a>, Dean Gaudet, Ben Hyde, <a href="Jim%20Jagielski">Jim Jagielski</a>, Alexei Kosut, Martin Kraemer, <a href="Ben%20Laurie">Ben Laurie</a>, Doug MacEachern, Aram Mirzadeh, <a href="Sameer%20Parekh">Sameer Parekh</a>, Cliff Skolnick, Marc Slemko, William (Bill) Stoddard, Paul Sutton, <a href="Randy%20Terbush">Randy Terbush</a> and <a href="Dirk-Willem%20van%20Gulik">Dirk-Willem van Gulik</a>. After a series of additional meetings to elect board members and resolve other legal matters regarding incorporation, the effective incorporation date of the Apache Software Foundation was set to June 1, 1999.

The <a href="Apache%20HTTP%20Server%23Name">name 'Apache'</a> was chosen from respect for the Native American <a href="Apache">Apache</a> Nation, well known for their superior skills in warfare strategy and their inexhaustible endurance. It also makes a pun on "a patchy web server"—a server made from a series of patches—but this was not its origin. The group of developers who released this new software soon started to call themselves the "Apache Group".

Apache divides its <a href="software%20development">software development</a> activities into separate semi-autonomous areas called "top-level projects" (formally known as a "Project Management Committee" in the bylaws), some of which have a number of sub-projects. Unlike some other organizations that host <a href="Free%20and%20open-source%20software">FOSS</a> projects, before a project is hosted at Apache it has to be licensed to the ASF with a grant or contributor agreement. In this way, the ASF gains the necessary intellectual property rights for the development and distribution of all its projects.

The ASF board of directors has responsibility for overseeing the ASF's activities and acting as a central point of contact and communication for its projects. The board assigns corporate issues, assigning resources to projects, and manages corporate services, including funds and legal issues. It does not make technical decisions about individual projects; these are made by the individual Project Management Committees. The board is elected annually by members of the foundation and, after the March 2017 Annual Members Meeting, it consists of:


In the 2010–11 fiscal year, the Foundation took in $539,410, almost entirely from grants and contributions with $12,349 from two ApacheCons. With no employees and 2,663 volunteers, it spent $270,846 on infrastructure, $92,364 on public relations, and $17,891 on two ApacheCons.

Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990

The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 () is a <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> law that prohibits <a href="discrimination">discrimination</a> based on <a href="disability">disability</a>. It affords similar protections against discrimination to <a href="Americans%20with%20disabilities">Americans with disabilities</a> as the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>, which made discrimination based on <a href="Race%20%28classification%20of%20human%20beings%29">race</a>, <a href="religion">religion</a>, <a href="gender">sex</a>, national origin, and other characteristics illegal. In addition, unlike the Civil Rights Act, the ADA also requires covered employers to provide <a href="reasonable%20accommodation">reasonable accommodation</a>s to employees with disabilities, and imposes <a href="accessibility">accessibility</a> requirements on public accommodations.

In 1986, the <a href="National%20Council%20on%20Disability">National Council on Disability</a> had recommended enactment of an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and drafted the first version of the bill which was introduced in the House and Senate in 1988. The final version of the bill was <a href="signed%20into%20law">signed into law</a> on July 26, 1990, by President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>. It was later <a href="ADA%20Amendments%20Act%20of%202008">amended in 2008</a> and signed by President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> with changes effective as of January 1, 2009.

ADA disabilities include both mental and physical medical conditions. A condition does not need to be severe or permanent to be a disability. <a href="Equal%20Employment%20Opportunity%20Commission">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> regulations provide a list of conditions that should easily be concluded to be disabilities: deafness, blindness, an intellectual disability (formerly termed mental retardation), partially or completely missing limbs or mobility impairments requiring the use of a wheelchair, autism, cancer, cerebral palsy, diabetes, epilepsy, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. Other mental or physical health conditions also may be disabilities, depending on what the individual's symptoms would be in the absence of "mitigating measures" (medication, therapy, assistive devices, or other means of restoring function), during an "active episode" of the condition (if the condition is episodic).

Certain specific conditions that are widely considered <a href="anti-social%20behavior">anti-social</a>, or tend to result in illegal activity, such as kleptomania, pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, etc. are excluded under the definition of "disability" in order to prevent abuse of the statute's purpose. Additionally, other specific conditions, such as gender identity disorders, are also excluded under the definition of "disability".

The ADA states that a "covered entity" shall not discriminate against "a qualified individual with a disability". This applies to <a href="application%20for%20employment">job application</a> procedures, hiring, advancement and discharge of employees, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. "Covered entities" include employers with 15 or more employees, as well as <a href="employment%20agencies">employment agencies</a>, <a href="labor%20organizations">labor organizations</a>, and joint <a href="Industrial%20relations">labor-management</a> committees. There are strict limitations on when a covered entity can ask job applicants or employees disability-related questions or require them to undergo medical examination, and all medical information must be kept confidential.

Prohibited discrimination may include, among other things, firing or refusing to hire someone based on a real or perceived disability, segregation, and harassment based on a disability. Covered entities are also required to provide <a href="reasonable%20accommodation">reasonable accommodation</a>s to job applicants and employees with disabilities. A reasonable accommodation is a change in the way things are typically done that the person needs because of a disability, and can include, among other things, special equipment that allows the person to perform the job, scheduling changes, and changes to the way work assignments are chosen or communicated. An employer is not required to provide an accommodation that would involve undue hardship (significant difficulty or expense), and the individual who receives the accommodation must still perform the essential functions of the job and meet the normal performance requirements. An employee or applicant who currently engages in the illegal use of drugs is not considered qualified when a covered entity takes adverse action based on such use.

There are many ways to discriminate against people based on disabilities, including psychological ones. Anyone known to have a history of mental disorders can be considered disabled. Employers with more than 15 employees must take care to treat all employees fairly and with any accommodations needed. Even when an employee is doing a job exceptionally well, she or he is not necessarily no longer disabled; employers must continue to follow all policies for the disabled.

Part of Title I was found unconstitutional by the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">United States Supreme Court</a> as it pertains to states in the case of "<a href="Board%20of%20Trustees%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Alabama%20v.%20Garrett">Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett</a>" as violating the <a href="sovereign%20immunity">sovereign immunity</a> rights of the several states as specified by the <a href="Eleventh%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution</a>. The Court determined that state employees cannot sue their employer for violating ADA rules. State employees can, however, file complaints at the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Department of Justice</a> or the <a href="Equal%20Employment%20Opportunity%20Commission">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a>, who can sue on their behalf.

Title II prohibits disability discrimination by all public entities at the local level, "e.g.", school district, municipal, city, or county, and at state level. Public entities must comply with Title II regulations by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">U.S. Department of Justice</a>. These regulations cover access to all programs and services offered by the entity. Access includes physical access described in the ADA Standards for Accessible Design and programmatic access that might be obstructed by discriminatory policies or procedures of the entity.

Title II applies to public transportation provided by public entities through regulations by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Transportation">U.S. Department of Transportation</a>. It includes the <a href="Amtrak">National Railroad Passenger Corporation</a> (Amtrak), along with all other commuter authorities. This section requires the provision of paratransit services by public entities that provide fixed route services. ADA also sets minimum requirements for space layout in order to facilitate wheelchair securement on public transport.

Title II also applies to all state and local public housing, housing assistance, and housing referrals. The <a href="Office%20of%20Fair%20Housing%20and%20Equal%20Opportunity">Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity</a> is charged with enforcing this provision.

Under Title III, no individual may be discriminated against on the basis of disability with regards to the full and equal <a href="enjoyment">enjoyment</a> of the goods, services, facilities, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases, or operates a place of public accommodation. Public accommodations include most places of lodging (such as inns and hotels), recreation, transportation, education, and dining, along with stores, care providers, and places of public displays.

Under Title III of the ADA, all new construction (construction, modification or alterations) after the effective date of the ADA (approximately July 1992) must be fully compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) found in the <a href="Code%20of%20Federal%20Regulations">Code of Federal Regulations</a> at 28 C.F.R., Part 36, Appendix "A".

Title III also has application to existing facilities. One of the definitions of "discrimination" under Title III of the ADA is a "failure to remove" architectural barriers in existing facilities. See . This means that even facilities that have not been modified or altered in any way after the ADA was passed still have obligations. The standard is whether "removing barriers" (typically defined as bringing a condition into compliance with the ADAAG) is "readily achievable", defined as "...easily accomplished without much difficulty or expense".

The statutory definition of "readily achievable" calls for a <a href="balancing%20test">balancing test</a> between the cost of the proposed "fix" and the wherewithal of the business and/or owners of the business. Thus, what might be "readily achievable" for a sophisticated and financially capable corporation might not be readily achievable for a small or local business.

There are exceptions to this title; many private clubs and religious organizations may not be bound by Title III. With regard to historic properties (those properties that are listed or that are eligible for listing in the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>, or properties designated as historic under state or local law), those facilities must still comply with the provisions of Title III of the ADA to the "maximum extent feasible" but if following the usual standards would "threaten to destroy the historic significance of a feature of the building" then alternative standards may be used.

Under 2010 revisions of Department of Justice regulations, newly constructed or altered swimming pools, wading pools, and spas must have an accessible means of entrance and exit to pools for disabled people. However, the requirement is conditioned on whether providing access through a fixed lift is "readily achievable". Other requirements exist, based on pool size, include providing a certain number of accessible means of entry and exit, which are outlined in Section 242 of the standards. However, businesses are free to consider the differences in application of the rules depending on whether the pool is new or altered, or whether the swimming pool was in existence before the effective date of the new rule. Full compliance may not be required for existing facilities; Section 242 and 1009 of the 2010 Standards outline such exceptions.

The ADA provides explicit coverage for service animals. Guidelines have been developed not only to protect persons with disabilities, but also to indemnify businesses from damages related to granting access to service animals on their premises. Businesses are allowed to ask if the animal is a service animal and ask what tasks it is trained to perform, but they are not allowed to ask the service animal to perform the task nor ask for a special ID of the animal. They can not ask what the person's disabilities are. A person with a disability can not be removed from the premises unless either of two things happen: the animal is out of control and its owner can not get it under control (e.g. a dog barking uncontrollably in a restaurant), or the animal is a direct threat to people's health and safety. Allergies and fear of animal would not be considered a threat to people's health and safety so it would not be a valid reason to deny access to people with service animals. Businesses that prepare or serve food must allow service animals and their owners on the premises even if state or local health laws otherwise prohibit animals on the premise. In this case, businesses that prepare or serve food are not required to provide care or food for service animals nor do they have to provide a designated area for the service animal to use the bathroom. Lastly, people that require service dogs can not be charged an extra fee for their service dog or be treated unfairly. For example, being isolated from people at a restaurant. People with disabilities can not be treated less than other customers. However, if a business normally charges for damages caused by the person to property, the customer with a disability will be charged for his/her service animal's damages to the property.

Title IV of the ADA amended the landmark <a href="Communications%20Act%20of%201934">Communications Act of 1934</a> primarily by adding section . This section requires that all telecommunications companies in the U.S. take steps to ensure functionally equivalent services for consumers with disabilities, notably those who are deaf or hard of hearing and those with speech impairments. When Title IV took effect in the early 1990s, it led to the installation of public <a href="teletypewriter">teletypewriter</a> (TTY) machines and other TDD (<a href="Telecommunications%20Device%20for%20the%20Deaf">telecommunications devices for the deaf</a>). Title IV also led to the creation, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, of what were then called dual-party relay services and now are known as <a href="Telecommunications%20Relay%20Services">Telecommunications Relay Services</a> (TRS), such as <a href="STS%20relay">STS relay</a>. Today, many TRS-mediated calls are made over the Internet by consumers who use broadband connections. Some are <a href="Video%20Relay%20Service">Video Relay Service</a> (VRS) calls, while others are text calls. In either variation, communication assistants translate between the signed or typed words of a consumer and the spoken words of others. In 2006, according to the <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC), VRS calls averaged two million minutes a month.

Title V includes technical provisions. It discusses, for example, the fact that nothing in the ADA amends, overrides or cancels anything in <a href="Section%20504">Section 504</a>. Additionally, Title V includes an anti-retaliation or coercion provision. The "Technical Assistance Manual" for the ADA explains it: "III-3.6000 Retaliation or coercion. Individuals who exercise their rights under the ADA, or assist others in exercising their rights, are protected from retaliation. The prohibition against retaliation or coercion applies broadly to any individual or entity that seeks to prevent an individual from exercising his or her rights or to retaliate against him or her for having exercised those rights ... Any form of retaliation or coercion, including threats, intimidation, or interference, is prohibited if it is intended to interfere.

The ADA has roots in <a href="Section%20504%20of%20the%20Rehabilitation%20Act">Section 504</a> of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.

The idea of federal legislation enhancing and extending civil rights legislation to millions of Americans with disabilities gained bipartisan support in late 1988 and early 1989. In early 1989 both Congress and the newly-inaugurated Bush White House worked separately, then jointly, to write legislation capable of expanding civil rights without imposing undue harm or costs on those already in compliance with existing rules and laws.

Over the years, key activists and advocates played an important role in lobbying Members of the U.S. Congress to develop and pass the ADA, including <a href="Justin%20Whitlock%20Dart%2C%20Jr.">Justin Whitlock Dart, Jr.</a>, <a href="Patrisha%20Wright">Patrisha Wright</a> and others.

Ms. Wright is known as "the General" for her work in coordinating the campaign to enact the ADA. She is widely considered the main force behind the campaign lobbying for the ADA.

About the importance of making employment opportunities inclusive, Shirley Davis, director of global diversity and inclusion at the <a href="Society%20for%20Human%20Resource%20Management">Society for Human Resource Management</a>, said: "People with disabilities represent a critical talent pool that is underserved and underutilized".

The debate over the Americans with Disabilities Act led some religious groups to take opposite positions. The <a href="Association%20of%20Christian%20Schools%20International">Association of Christian Schools International</a>, opposed the ADA in its original form. primarily because the ADA labeled religious institutions "public accommodations", and thus would have required churches to make costly structural changes to ensure access for all. The cost argument advanced by ACSI and others prevailed in keeping religious institutions from being labeled as "public accommodations".

Church groups such as the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Evangelicals">National Association of Evangelicals</a> testified against the ADA's Title I employment provisions on grounds of religious liberty. The NAE believed the regulation of the internal employment of churches was "... an improper intrusion [of] the federal government."

Many members of the business community opposed the Americans with Disabilities Act. Testifying before Congress, <a href="Greyhound%20Bus%20Lines">Greyhound Bus Lines</a> stated that the act had the potential to "deprive millions of people of affordable intercity public transportation and thousands of rural communities of their only link to the outside world." The <a href="US%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce">US Chamber of Commerce</a> argued that the costs of the ADA would be "enormous" and have "a disastrous impact on many small businesses struggling to survive." The <a href="National%20Federation%20of%20Independent%20Businesses">National Federation of Independent Businesses</a>, an organization that lobbies for small businesses, called the ADA "a disaster for small business." Pro-business conservative commentators joined in opposition, writing that the Americans with Disabilities Act was "an expensive headache to millions" that would not necessarily improve the lives of people with disabilities.

Shortly before the act was passed, <a href="disability%20rights">disability rights</a> activists with <a href="physical%20disability">physical disabilities</a> coalesced in front of the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">Capitol Building</a>, shed their crutches, <a href="wheelchair">wheelchair</a>s, <a href="powerchair">powerchair</a>s and other <a href="assistive%20device">assistive device</a>s, and immediately proceeded to crawl and pull their bodies up all 100 of the Capitol's front steps, without warning. As the activists did so, many of them chanted "ADA now", and "Vote, Now". Some activists who remained at the bottom of the steps held signs and yelled words of encouragement at the "Capitol Crawlers". Jennifer Keelan, a second grader with <a href="cerebral%20palsy">cerebral palsy</a>, was videotaped as she pulled herself up the steps, using mostly her hands and arms, saying "I'll take all night if I have to." This <a href="direct%20action">direct action</a> is reported to have "inconvenienced" several senators and to have pushed them to approve the act. While there are those who do not attribute much overall importance to this action, the "Capitol Crawl" of 1990 is seen by some present-day disability activists in the United States as a central act for encouraging the ADA into law.

Senator <a href="Tom%20Harkin">Tom Harkin</a> (<a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">D</a>-<a href="Iowa">IA</a>) authored what became the final bill and was its chief sponsor in the Senate. Harkin delivered part of his introduction speech in sign language, saying it was so his deaf brother could understand.

On signing the measure, <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> said: 
The ADA defines a covered disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a history of having such an impairment, or being regarded as having such an impairment. The <a href="Equal%20Employment%20Opportunity%20Commission">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a> (EEOC) was charged with interpreting the 1990 law with regard to discrimination in employment. The EEOC developed regulations limiting an individual’s impairment to one that "severely or significantly restricts" a major life activity. The ADAAA directed the EEOC to amend its regulations and replace "severely or significantly" with "substantially limits", a more lenient standard.

On September 25, 2008, President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> signed the <a href="ADA%20Amendments%20Act%20of%202008">ADA Amendments Act of 2008</a> (ADAAA) into law. The amendment broadened the definition of "disability", thereby extending the ADA's protections to a greater number of people. The ADAAA also added to the ADA examples of "major life activities" including, but not limited to, "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working" as well as the operation of several specified "major bodily functions". The act overturned a 1999 US Supreme Court case that held that an employee was not disabled if the impairment could be corrected by mitigating measures; it specifically provides that such impairment must be determined without considering such ameliorative measures. It also overturned the court restriction that an impairment which substantially limits one major life activity must also limit others to be considered a disability.
In 2008, the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Education%20and%20Labor">United States House Committee on Education and Labor</a> stated that the amendment "makes it absolutely clear that the ADA is intended to provide broad coverage to protect anyone who faces discrimination on the basis of disability." Thus the ADAAA led to broader coverage of impaired employees.

 the ADA had improved access to public services, the built environment (e.g., crosswalks with curb cuts and accessible pedestrian signals), understanding of the abilities of people with disabilities, established a right to equal access to public services and has demonstrated the contributions which people with disabilities can make to the economy. Disparities have remained in employment, earned income, Internet access, transportation, housing, and educational attainment and the disabled remain at a disadvantage with respect to health and health care.

The ADA has been criticized on the grounds that it decreases the employment rate for people with disabilities and raises the cost of doing business for employers, in large part due to the additional legal risks, which employers avoid by quietly avoiding hiring people with disabilities. Some researchers believe that the law has been ineffectual. Between 1991 (after the enactment of the ADA) and 1995, the employment rate of men with disabilities dropped by 7.8% regardless of age, educational level, or type of disability, with the most affected being young, less-educated and mentally disabled men. Despite the many criticisms, a causal link between the ADA and declining disabled employment over much of the 1990s has not been definitively identified.

In 2001, for men of all working ages and women under 40, <a href="Current%20Population%20Survey">Current Population Survey</a> data showed a sharp drop in the employment of disabled workers, leading at least two economists to attribute the cause to the Act. By contrast, a study in 2003 found that while the Act may have led to short term reactions by employers, in the long term, there were either positive or neutral consequences for wages and employment. In 2005 the rate of employment among disabled people increased to 45% of the population of disabled people.

Since enforcement of the act began in July 1992, it has quickly become a major component of employment law. The ADA allows private plaintiffs to receive only <a href="injunctive%20relief">injunctive relief</a> (a court order requiring the public accommodation to remedy violations of the accessibility regulations) and attorneys' fees, and does not provide monetary rewards to private plaintiffs who sue non-compliant businesses. Unless a state law, such as the California <a href="Unruh%20Civil%20Rights%20Act">Unruh Civil Rights Act</a>, provides for monetary damages to private plaintiffs, persons with disabilities do not obtain direct financial benefits from suing businesses that violate the ADA.

The attorneys' fees provision of Title III does provide incentive for lawyers to specialize and engage in serial ADA litigation, but a disabled plaintiff does not obtain financial reward from attorneys' fees unless they act as their own attorney, or as mentioned above, a disabled plaintiff resides in a state that provides for minimum compensation and court fees in lawsuits. Moreover, there may be a benefit to these "private attorneys general" who identify and compel the correction of illegal conditions: they may increase the number of public accommodations accessible to persons with disabilities. "Civil rights law depends heavily on private enforcement. Moreover, the inclusion of penalties and damages is the driving force that facilitates voluntary compliance with the ADA." Courts have noted: "As a result, most ADA suits are brought by a small number of private plaintiffs who view themselves as champions of the disabled. For the ADA to yield its promise of equal access for the disabled, it may indeed be necessary and desirable for committed individuals to bring serial litigation advancing the time when public accommodations will be compliant with the ADA."

However, in states that have enacted laws that allow private individuals to win monetary awards from non-compliant businesses (as of 2008, these include California, Florida, Hawaii, and Illinois), "professional plaintiffs" are typically found. At least one of these plaintiffs in California has been barred by courts from filing lawsuits unless he receives prior court permission. Through the end of fiscal year 1998, 86% of the 106,988 ADA charges filed with and resolved by the <a href="Equal%20Employment%20Opportunity%20Commission">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</a>, were either dropped or investigated and dismissed by EEOC but not without imposing opportunity costs and legal fees on employers.

There have been some notable cases regarding the ADA. For example, two major hotel room marketers (Expedia.com and Hotels.com) with their business presence on the Internet were sued because its customers with disabilities could not reserve hotel rooms, through their websites without substantial extra efforts that persons without disabilities were not required to perform. These represent a major potential expansion of the ADA in that this, and other similar suits (known as "bricks vs. clicks"), seeks to expand the ADA's authority to <a href="cyberspace">cyberspace</a>, where entities may not have actual physical facilities that are required to comply.

"<a href="National%20Federation%20of%20the%20Blind%20v.%20Target%20Corporation">National Federation of the Blind v. Target Corporation</a>" was a case where a major retailer, <a href="Target%20Corp.">Target Corp.</a>, was sued because their web designers failed to design its website to enable persons with low or no vision to use it.

"<a href="Board%20of%20Trustees%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Alabama%20v.%20Garrett">Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett</a>", 531 U.S. 356 (2001), was a <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> case about <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress's</a> <a href="congressional%20power%20of%20enforcement">enforcement powers</a> under the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> to the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</a>. It decided that Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act was unconstitutional insofar as it allowed private citizens to sue states for <a href="money%20damages">money damages</a>.

"Barden v. The City of Sacramento", filed in March 1999, claimed that the City of Sacramento failed to comply with the ADA when, while making public street improvements, it did not bring its sidewalks into compliance with the ADA. Certain issues were resolved in Federal Court. One issue, whether sidewalks were covered by the ADA, was appealed to the <a href="9th%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals">9th Circuit Court of Appeals</a>, which ruled that sidewalks were a "program" under ADA and must be made accessible to persons with disabilities. The ruling was later appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case, letting stand the ruling of the 9th Circuit Court.

"Bates v. UPS" (begun in 1999) was the first <a href="equal%20opportunity%20employment">equal opportunity employment</a> class action brought on behalf of Deaf and Hard of Hearing (d/Deaf/HoH) workers throughout the country concerning workplace discrimination. It established legal precedence for d/Deaf/HoH Employees and Customers to be fully covered under the ADA. Key findings included
The outcome was that UPS agreed to pay a $5.8 million award and agreed to a comprehensive accommodations program that was implemented in their facilities throughout the country.

"<a href="Spector%20v.%20Norwegian%20Cruise%20Line%20Ltd.">Spector v. Norwegian Cruise Line Ltd.</a>" was a case that was decided by the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">United States Supreme Court</a> in 2005. The defendant argued that as a vessel flying the flag of a foreign nation it was exempt from the requirements of the ADA. This argument was accepted by a federal court in Florida and, subsequently, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. However, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the ruling of the lower courts on the basis that Norwegian Cruise Lines was a business headquartered in the United States whose clients were predominantly Americans and, more importantly, operated out of port facilities throughout the United States.

"<a href="Olmstead%20v.%20L.C.">Olmstead v. L.C.</a>" was a case before the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">United States Supreme Court</a> in 1999. The two plaintiffs L.C. and E.W. were institutionalized in Georgia for diagnosed mental retardation and schizophrenia. Clinical assessments by the state determined that the plaintiffs could be appropriately treated in a community setting rather than the state institution. The plaintiffs sued the state of Georgia and the institution for being inappropriately treated and housed in the institutional setting rather than being treated in one of the state's community based treatment facilities.

The Supreme Court decided under Title II of the ADA that mental illness is a form of disability and therefore covered under the ADA, and that unjustified institutional isolation of a person with a disability is a form of discrimination because it "...perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of participating in community life." The court added, "Confinement in an institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, work options, economic independence, educational advancement, and cultural enrichment."

Therefore, under Title II no person with a disability can be unjustly excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of services, programs or activities of any public entity.

This was a case filed before The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan Southern Division on behalf of the Michigan <a href="Paralyzed%20Veterans%20of%20America">Paralyzed Veterans of America</a> against University of Michigan – Michigan Stadium claiming that <a href="Michigan%20Stadium">Michigan Stadium</a> violated the Americans with Disabilities Act in its $226-million renovation by failing to add enough seats for disabled fans or accommodate the needs for disabled restrooms, concessions and parking. Additionally, the distribution of the accessible seating was at issue, with nearly all the seats being provided in the end-zone areas. The U.S. Department of Justice assisted in the suit filed by attorney Richard Bernstein of <a href="The%20Law%20Offices%20of%20Sam%20Bernstein">The Law Offices of Sam Bernstein</a> in Farmington Hills, Michigan, which was settled in March 2008. The settlement required the stadium to add 329 wheelchair seats throughout the stadium by 2010, and an additional 135 accessible seats in clubhouses to go along with the existing 88 wheelchair seats. This case was significant because it set a precedent for the uniform distribution of accessible seating and gave the DOJ the opportunity to clarify previously unclear rules. The agreement now is a blueprint for all stadiums and other public facilities regarding accessibility.

One of the first major ADA lawsuits, "Paralyzed Veterans of America (or "PVA") v. Ellerbe Becket Architects and Engineers" (1996) was focused on the wheelchair accessibility of a stadium project that was still in the design phase, MCI Center (now known as <a href="Verizon%20Center">Verizon Center</a>) in Washington, D.C. Previous to this case, which was filed only five years after the ADA was passed, the DOJ was unable or unwilling to provide clarification on the distribution requirements for accessible wheelchair locations in large assembly spaces. While Section 4.33.3 of ADAAG makes reference to lines of sight, no specific reference is made to seeing over standing patrons. The MCI Center, designed by Ellerbe Becket Architects & Engineers, was designed with too few wheelchair and companion seats, and the ones that were included did not provide sight lines that would enable the wheelchair user to view the playing area while the spectators in front of them were standing. This case and another related case established precedent on seat distribution and sight lines issues for ADA enforcement that continues to present day.

"<a href="Toyota%20Motor%20Manufacturing%2C%20Kentucky%2C%20Inc.%20v.%20Williams">Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams</a>", <a href="Case%20citation">534 U.S. 184</a> (2002) was a case in which the Supreme Court interpreted the meaning of the phrase "substantially impairs" as used in the Americans with Disabilities Act. It reversed a Sixth Court of Appeals decision to grant a partial <a href="summary%20judgment">summary judgment</a> in favor of the respondent, Ella Williams that qualified her inability to perform manual job-related tasks as a disability. The Court held that the "major life activity" definition in evaluating the performance of manual tasks focuses the inquiry on whether Williams was unable to perform a range of tasks central to most people in carrying out the activities of daily living. The issue is not whether Williams was unable to perform her specific job tasks. Therefore, the determination of whether an impairment rises to the level of a disability is not limited to activities in the workplace solely, but rather to manual tasks in life in general. When the Supreme Court applied this standard, it found that the Court of Appeals had incorrectly determined the presence of a disability because it relied solely on her inability to perform specific manual work tasks, which was insufficient in proving the presence of a disability. The Court of Appeals should have taken into account the evidence presented that Williams retained the ability to do personal tasks and household chores, such activities being the nature of tasks most people do in their daily lives, and placed too much emphasis on her job disability. Since the evidence showed that Williams was performing normal daily tasks, it ruled that the Court of Appeals erred when it found that Williams was disabled. This ruling is now, however, no longer good law—it was invalidated by the ADAAA. In fact, Congress explicitly cited Toyota v. Williams in the text of the ADAAA itself as one of its driving influences for passing the ADAAA.

Decided by the US Supreme Court in 2002 this case held that even requests for accommodation that might seem reasonable on their face, e.g., a transfer to a different position, can be rendered unreasonable because it would require a violation of the company's seniority system. While the court held that in general a violation of a seniority system renders an otherwise reasonable accommodation unreasonable a plaintiff can present evidence that despite the seniority system the accommodation is reasonable in the specific case at hand, e.g., the plaintiff could offer evidence that the seniority system is so often disregarded that another exception wouldn't make a difference.

Importantly, the court held that the defendant need not provide proof that this particular application of the seniority system should prevail and that once the defendant showed that the accommodation violated the seniority system it fell to Barnett to show it was nevertheless reasonable.

In this case Barnett was a US Airways employee who injured his back rendering him physically unable to perform his cargo handling job. Invoking seniority he transferred to a less demanding mailroom job but this position later became open to seniority based bidding and was bid on by more senior employees. Barnett requested the accommodation of being allowed to stay on in the less demanding mailroom job. US Airways denied his request and he lost his job.

The Supreme Court decision invalidated both the approach of the district court which found that the mere presence and importance of the seniority system was enough to warrant a summary judgement in favor of US Airways as well as the circuit court's approach that interpreted 'reasonable accommodation' as 'effective accommodation.'

"<a href="Access%20Now%20v.%20Southwest%20Airlines">Access Now v. Southwest Airlines</a>" was a case where the <a href="United%20States%20district%20court">District Court</a> decided that the website of <a href="Southwest%20Airlines">Southwest Airlines</a> was not in violation of the Americans with Disability Act because the ADA is concerned with things with a physical existence and thus cannot be applied to cyberspace. Judge <a href="Patricia%20A.%20Seitz">Patricia A. Seitz</a> found that the "virtual ticket counter" of the website was a virtual construct, and hence not a "public place of accommodation." As such, "To expand the ADA to cover 'virtual' spaces would be to create new rights without well-defined standards."

"<a href="Ouellette%20v.%20Viacom%20International%20Inc.">Ouellette v. Viacom International Inc.</a>" followed in Access Now's footsteps by holding that a mere online presence does not subject a website to the ADA guidelines. Thus Myspace and YouTube were not liable for a dyslexic man's inability to navigate the site regardless of how impressive the "online theater" is.

"<a href="Authors%20Guild%20v.%20HathiTrust">Authors Guild v. HathiTrust</a>" was a case in which the District Court decided that the <a href="HathiTrust">HathiTrust</a> digital library was a transformative, fair use of copyrighted works, making a large number of written text available to those with <a href="print%20disability">print disability</a>.

Zamora-Quezada v. HealthTexas Medical Group (begun in 1998) was the first time this act was used against <a href="Health%20maintenance%20organization">HMO's</a> when a novel lawsuit was filed by <a href="Texas">Texas</a> attorney <a href="Robert%20Provan">Robert Provan</a> against five HMO's for their practice of revoking the contracts of doctors treating disabled patients.

Apple I

Apple Computer 1, also known later as the Apple I, or Apple-1, is a <a href="desktop%20computer">desktop computer</a> released by the Apple Computer Company (now <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple Inc.</a>) in 1976. It was designed and <a href="Handicraft">hand-built</a> by <a href="Steve%20Wozniak">Steve Wozniak</a>. Wozniak's friend <a href="Steve%20Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> had the idea of selling the computer. The Apple I was <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a>'s first product, and to finance its creation, Jobs sold his only motorized means of transportation, a <a href="Volkswagen%20Type%202">VW Microbus</a>, for a few hundred dollars, and Wozniak sold his <a href="HP-65">HP-65</a> calculator for $500; however, Wozniak said that Jobs planned to use his bicycle if necessary. It was demonstrated in July 1976 at the <a href="Homebrew%20Computer%20Club">Homebrew Computer Club</a> in <a href="Palo%20Alto%2C%20California">Palo Alto, California</a>.

Production was discontinued on September 30, 1977, after the June 10, 1977, introduction of its successor, the <a href="Apple%20II">Apple II</a>, which <a href="Byte%20%28magazine%29">"Byte" magazine</a> referred to as part of the "1977 Trinity" of personal computing (along with the <a href="PET%202001">PET 2001</a> and the <a href="TRS-80">TRS-80</a>).

On March 5, 1975, Steve Wozniak attended the first meeting of the <a href="Homebrew%20Computer%20Club">Homebrew Computer Club</a> in Gordon French's garage. He was so inspired that he immediately set to work on what would become the Apple I computer. After building it for himself and showing it at the Club, he and Steve Jobs gave out schematics (technical designs) for the computer to interested club members and even helped some of them build and test out copies. Then, Steve Jobs suggested that they design and sell a single etched and silkscreened circuit board—just the bare board, no electronic parts—that people could use to build the computers. Wozniak calculated that having the board design laid out would cost $1,000 and manufacturing would cost another $20 per board; he hoped to recoup his costs if 50 people bought the boards for $40 each. To fund this small venture, their first company, Jobs sold his van and Wozniak sold his <a href="HP-65">HP-65</a> calculator. Very soon after, Steve Jobs arranged to sell "something like 50" completely built computers to the <a href="Paul%20Terrell">Byte Shop</a> (a computer store in Mountain View, California) at $500 each. To fulfill the $25,000 order, they obtained $20,000 in parts at <a href="Net%20D">30 days net</a> and delivered the finished product in 10 days.

The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 at a price of , because Wozniak "liked repeating digits" and because of a one-third markup on the $500 wholesale price.

The first unit produced was used in a high school math class, and donated to <a href="Liza%20Loop">Liza Loop</a>'s public access computer center. About 200 units were produced and all but 25 were sold during nine or ten months.

The Apple I's built-in <a href="computer%20terminal">computer terminal</a> circuitry was distinctive. All one needed was a <a href="Keyboard%20%28computing%29">keyboard</a> and a <a href="television%20set">television set</a>. Competing machines such as the <a href="Altair%208800">Altair 8800</a> generally were programmed with front-mounted toggle switches and used indicator lights (red <a href="light-emitting%20diode">LEDs</a>, most commonly) for output, and had to be extended with separate hardware to allow connection to a computer terminal or a <a href="Teletype%20Model%2033">teletypewriter machine</a>. This made the Apple I an innovative machine for its day. In April 1977, the price was dropped to $475. It continued to be sold through August 1977, despite the introduction of the <a href="Apple%20II">Apple II</a> in April 1977, which began shipping in June of that year. In October 1977, the Apple I was officially discontinued and removed from Apple's price list. As Wozniak was the only person who could answer most customer support questions about the computer, the company offered Apple I owners discounts and trade-ins for Apple IIs to persuade them to return their computers. These recovered boards were then destroyed by Apple, contributing to their rarity today.

As of 2013, at least 63 Apple I computers have been confirmed to exist. Only six have been verified to be in working condition.


Both Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak have stated that Apple did not assign serial numbers to the Apple l. Several boards have been found with numbered stickers affixed to them, which appear to be inspection stickers from the PCB manufacturer/assembler. A batch of boards is known to have numbers hand-written in black permanent marker on the back; these usually appear as "01-00##" and anecdotal evidence suggests they are inventory control numbers added by the Byte Shop to the batch Apple sold them. These Byte Shop numbers have often erroneously been described as serial numbers by auction houses and in related press coverage.


Several Apple I clones and replicas have been released in recent years. These are all created by hobbyists and marketed to the hobbyist/collector community. Availability is usually limited to small runs in response to demand.
