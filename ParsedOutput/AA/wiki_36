Beagle

The Beagle is a <a href="Dog%20breed">breed</a> of small <a href="hound">hound</a>, similar in appearance to the much larger <a href="foxhound">foxhound</a>. The beagle is a <a href="scent%20hound">scent hound</a>, developed primarily for <a href="Tracking%20%28hunting%29">hunting</a> <a href="hare">hare</a>. With a great sense of smell and superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as <a href="detection%20dog">detection dog</a> for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in <a href="quarantine">quarantine</a> around the world. The beagle is intelligent but single-minded. It is a popular <a href="Companion%20dog">pet</a> due to its size, good temper, and lack of <a href="Dog%20health%23Genetic%20diseases">inherited health problems</a>.

Although beagle-type dogs have existed for 2,500 years, the modern breed was developed in <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> around the 1830s from several breeds, including the <a href="Talbot%20%28dog%29">Talbot Hound</a>, the <a href="North%20Country%20Beagle">North Country Beagle</a>, the <a href="Southern%20Hound">Southern Hound</a>, and possibly the <a href="Harrier%20%28dog%29">Harrier</a>.

Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since <a href="Elizabethan%20era">Elizabethan</a> times in literature and paintings, and more recently in film, television, and comic books. <a href="Snoopy">Snoopy</a> of the <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a> "<a href="Peanuts">Peanuts</a>" has been called "the world's most famous beagle".

Dogs of similar size and purpose to the modern beagle can be traced in <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a>
back to around the 5th century BC. <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a>, born around 430 BC, in his "Treatise on Hunting" or "<a href="Cynegeticus">Cynegeticus</a>" refers to a <a href="hound">hound</a> that hunted hares by scent and was followed on foot. Small hounds are mentioned in the Forest Laws of <a href="Canute%20the%20Great">Canute</a> which exempted them from the ordinance which commanded that all dogs capable of running down a <a href="Deer">stag</a> should have one foot mutilated. If genuine, these laws would confirm that beagle-type dogs were present in England before 1016, but it is likely the laws were written in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> to give a sense of antiquity and tradition to Forest Law.

In the 11th century, <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William the Conqueror</a> brought the <a href="Talbot%20%28dog%29">Talbot hound</a> to Britain. The Talbot was a predominantly white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound derived from the <a href="St.%20Hubert%20Hound">St. Hubert Hound</a> which had been developed in the 8th century. At some point the English Talbots were crossed with <a href="Greyhound">Greyhound</a>s to give them an extra turn of speed. Long extinct, the Talbot strain probably gave rise to the Southern Hound which, in turn, is thought to be an ancestor of the modern-day beagle.

From medieval times, "beagle" was used as a generic description for the smaller hounds, though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed. Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of <a href="Edward%20II%20of%20England">Edward II</a> and <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII</a>, who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove, and <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth I</a> kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood at the shoulder. Small enough to fit in a "pocket" or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt. The larger hounds would run the prey to ground, then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush. Elizabeth I referred to the dogs as her "singing beagles" and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups. 19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and it is possible that the two names refer to the same small variety. In George Jesse's "Researches into the History of the British Dog" from 1866, the early 17th-century poet and writer <a href="Gervase%20Markham">Gervase Markham</a> is quoted referring to the beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the: Standards for the Pocket Beagle were drawn up as late as 1901; these genetic lines are now extinct, although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety.

By the 18th century two breeds had been developed for hunting hare and rabbit: the <a href="Southern%20Hound">Southern Hound</a> and the <a href="North%20Country%20Beagle">North Country Beagle</a> (or Northern Hound). The Southern Hound, a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long, soft ears, was common from south of the <a href="River%20Trent">River Trent</a> and probably closely related to the <a href="Talbot%20%28dog%29">Talbot Hound</a>. Though slow, it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability. The North Country Beagle, possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot stock and a Greyhound, was bred chiefly in <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> and was common in the northern counties. It was smaller than the Southern Hound, less heavy-set and with a more pointed muzzle. It was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well developed. As <a href="fox%20hunting">fox hunting</a> became increasingly popular, numbers of both types of hound diminished. The beagle-type dogs were crossed with larger breeds such as Stag Hounds to produce the modern <a href="English%20Foxhound">Foxhound</a>. The beagle-size varieties came close to extinction but some farmers in the South ensured the survival of the prototype breeds by maintaining small <a href="rabbit-hunting">rabbit-hunting</a> packs.

Reverend Phillip Honeywood established a beagle pack in <a href="Essex">Essex</a> in the 1830s and it is believed that this pack formed the basis for the modern breed. Although details of the pack's lineage are not recorded it is thought that North Country Beagles and Southern Hounds were strongly represented; <a href="William%20Youatt">William Youatt</a> suspected that <a href="Harrier%20%28dog%29">Harriers</a> formed a good majority of the beagle's bloodline, but the origin of the Harrier is itself obscure. Honeywood's Beagles were small, standing at about at the shoulder, and pure white according to John Mills (writing in "The Sportsman's Library" in 1845). <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a> and <a href="Edward%20Turnour%2C%204th%20Earl%20Winterton">Lord Winterton</a> also had Beagle packs around this time, and royal favour no doubt led to some revival of interest in the breed, but Honeywood's pack was regarded as the finest of the three.

Although credited with the development of the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard beagle bloodline.

In the 1840s, a standard beagle type was beginning to develop; the distinction between the North Country Beagle and Southern Hound had been lost, but there was still a large variation in size, character, and reliability among the emerging packs. In 1856, "Stonehenge" (the pseudonym of <a href="John%20Henry%20Walsh">John Henry Walsh</a>), writing in the "Manual of British Rural Sports", was still dividing beagles into four varieties: the medium beagle; the dwarf or lapdog beagle; the fox beagle (a smaller, slower version of the Foxhound); and the rough-coated or terrier beagle, which he classified as a cross between any of the other varieties and one of the Scottish <a href="terrier">terrier</a> breeds. Stonehenge also gives the start of a standard description:

By 1887 the threat of extinction was on the wane: there were 18 beagle packs in England. The Beagle Club was formed in 1890 and the first standard drawn up at the same time. The following year the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles was formed. Both organisations aimed to further the best interests of the breed, and both were keen to produce a standard type of beagle. By 1902, the number of packs had risen to 44.

Beagles were in the United States by the 1840s at the latest, but the first dogs were imported strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged <a href="Dachshund">Dachshund</a>s with weak heads has little resemblance to the standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline began in the early 1870s when General <a href="Richard%20Rowett">Richard Rowett</a> from <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887. The beagle was accepted as a breed by the <a href="American%20Kennel%20Club">American Kennel Club</a> (AKC) in 1885. In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.

On its formation, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles took over the running of a regular show at <a href="Peterborough">Peterborough</a> that had started in 1889, and the Beagle Club in the UK held its first show in 1896. The regular showing of the breed led to the development of a uniform type, and the beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> when all shows were suspended. After the war, the breed was again struggling for survival in the UK: the last of the Pocket Beagles was probably lost during this time, and registrations fell to an all-time low. A few breeders (notably Reynalton Kennels) managed to revive interest in the dog and by <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the breed was once again doing well. Registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered.

As purebred dogs, beagles have always been more popular in the United States and Canada than in their native country England. The National Beagle Club of America was formed in 1888 and by 1901 a beagle had won a Best in Show title. As in the UK, activity during World War I was minimal, but the breed showed a much stronger revival in the U.S. when hostilities ceased. In 1928 it won a number of prizes at the <a href="Westminster%20Kennel%20Club">Westminster Kennel Club</a>'s show and by 1939 a beagle – Champion Meadowlark Draughtsman – had captured the title of top-winning American-bred dog for the year. On 12 February 2008, a beagle, <a href="K-Run%27s%20Park%20Me%20In%20First">K-Run's Park Me In First (Uno)</a>, won the Best In Show category at the Westminster Kennel Club show for the first time in the competition's history. In North America they have been consistently in the top-ten most-popular breeds for over 30 years. From 1953 to 1959 the beagle was ranked No. 1 on the list of the <a href="American%20Kennel%20Club">American Kennel Club</a>'s registered breeds; in 2005 and 2006 it ranked 5th out of the 155 breeds registered. In the UK they are not quite so popular, placing 28th and 30th in the rankings of registrations with the Kennel Club in 2005 and 2006 respectively. In the United States the beagle ranked 4th most popular breed in 2012 and 2013, behind the <a href="Labrador%20Retriever">Labrador Retriever</a> (#1), <a href="German%20Shepherd">German Shepherd</a> (#2) and <a href="Golden%20Retriever">Golden Retriever</a> (#3) breeds.

According to the <a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>, the first mention of the beagle by name in English literature dates from c. 1475 in "<a href="The%20Squire%20of%20Low%20Degree">The Squire of Low Degree</a>". The origin of the word "beagle" is uncertain, although it has been suggested that the word derives from the French "begueule". 

It is not known why the black and tan <a href="Kerry%20Beagle">Kerry Beagle</a>, present in Ireland since <a href="Celt">Celt</a>ic times, has the "beagle" description, since at it is significantly taller than the modern day beagle, and in earlier times was even larger. Some writers suggest that the beagle's scenting ability may have come from cross-breeding earlier strains with the Kerry Beagle. Originally used for hunting stags, it is today used for hare and <a href="drag%20hunting">drag hunting</a>.

The general appearance of the beagle resembles a miniature <a href="Foxhound">Foxhound</a>, but the head is broader and the muzzle shorter, the expression completely different and the legs shorter in proportion to the body. They are generally between high at the <a href="withers">withers</a> and weigh between , with females being slightly smaller than males on average.

They have a smooth, somewhat domed <a href="skull">skull</a> with a medium-length, square-cut <a href="snout">muzzle</a> and a black (or occasionally liver) gumdrop nose. The jaw is strong and the teeth scissor together with the upper teeth fitting perfectly over the lower teeth and both sets aligned square to the jaw. The eyes are large, hazel or brown, with a mild hound-like pleading look. The large ears are long, soft and low-set, turning towards the cheeks slightly and rounded at the tips. Beagles have a strong, medium-length neck (which is long enough for them to easily bend to the ground to pick up a scent), with little folding in the skin but some evidence of a <a href="dewlap">dewlap</a>; a broad chest narrowing to a tapered <a href="abdomen">abdomen</a> and waist and a long, slightly curved tail (known as the "stern") tipped with white. The white tip, known as the flag has been selectively bred for, as it allows the dog to be easily seen when its head is down following a scent. The tail does not curl over the back, but is held upright when the dog is active. The beagle has a muscular body and a medium-length, smooth, hard coat. The front legs are straight and carried under the body while the rear legs are muscular and well bent at the <a href="Stifle%20joint">stifles</a>.

The tricolored beaglewhite with large black areas and light brown shadingis the most common. Tricolored beagles occur in a number of shades, from the "Classic Tri" with a jet black saddle (also known as "Blackback"), to the "Dark Tri" (where faint brown markings are intermingled with more prominent black markings), to the "Faded Tri" (where faint black markings are intermingled with more prominent brown markings). Some tricolored dogs have a broken pattern, sometimes referred to as "pied". These dogs have mostly white coats with patches of black and brown hair. Tricolor beagles are almost always born black and white. The white areas are typically set by eight weeks, but the black areas may fade to brown as the puppy matures. (The brown may take between one and two years to fully develop.) Some beagles gradually change color during their lives, and may lose their black markings entirely.

Two-color varieties always have a white base color with areas of the second color. Tan and white is the most common two-color variety, but there is a wide range of other colors including lemon, a very light tan; red, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black. Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with yellow eyes. Ticked or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different colored flecks ("ticking"), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue color, similar to the coloring of the <a href="Bluetick%20Coonhound">Bluetick Coonhound</a>. Some tricolor beagles also have ticking of various colors in their white areas.

Alongside the <a href="Bloodhound">Bloodhound</a> and <a href="Basset%20Hound">Basset Hound</a>, the beagle has one of the best developed senses of smell of any dog. In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-<a href="acre">acre</a> field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute, while <a href="Fox%20Terrier">Fox Terrier</a>s took 15 minutes and <a href="Scottish%20Terrier">Scottish Terrier</a>s failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most <a href="mountain%20rescue">mountain rescue</a> teams in favor of <a href="collie">collie</a>s, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable. The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.

The <a href="American%20Kennel%20Club">American Kennel Club</a> recognizes two separate varieties of beagle: the 13-inch for hounds less than , and the 15-inch for those between . The <a href="Canadian%20Kennel%20Club">Canadian Kennel Club</a> recognizes a single type, with a height not exceeding . The <a href="Kennel%20Club%20%28UK%29">Kennel Club (UK)</a> and <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Cynologique%20Internationale">FCI</a> affiliated clubs recognize a single type, with a height of between .

English and American varieties are sometimes mentioned. However, there is no official recognition from any Kennel Club for this distinction. beagles fitting the American Kennel Club standard – which disallows animals over – are smaller on average than those fitting the Kennel Club standard which allows heights up to .

Pocket Beagles are sometimes advertised for sale but while the UK Kennel Club originally specified a standard for the Pocket Beagle in 1901, the variety is not now recognized by any Kennel Club.
A strain known as Patch Hounds was developed by Willet Randall and his family from 1896 specifically for their rabbit hunting ability. They trace their bloodline back to Field Champion Patch, but do not necessarily have a patchwork marking.

In the 1850s, Stonehenge recommended a cross between a Beagle and a <a href="Scottish%20Terrier">Scottish Terrier</a> as a retriever. He found the <a href="crossbreed">crossbreed</a> to be a good worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it was small and could barely carry a hare.

More recently the trend has been for "<a href="dog%20crossbreeds">designer dogs</a>" and one of the most popular has been the Beagle/<a href="Pug">Pug</a> cross known as a <a href="Puggle">Puggle</a>. Some puppies of this cross are less excitable than a Beagle and with a lower exercise requirement, similar to the Pug parent; but many are highly excitable and require vigorous exercise.

The beagle has an even temper and gentle disposition. Described in several breed standards as "merry", they are amiable and typically neither aggressive nor timid, although this depends on the individual. They enjoy company, and although they may initially be standoffish with strangers, they are easily won over. They make poor <a href="guard%20dogs">guard dogs</a> for this reason, although their tendency to bark or howl when confronted with the unfamiliar makes them good watch dogs. In a 1985 study conducted by Ben and Lynette Hart, the beagle was given the highest excitability rating, along with the <a href="Yorkshire%20Terrier">Yorkshire Terrier</a>, <a href="Cairn%20Terrier">Cairn Terrier</a>, <a href="Miniature%20Schnauzer">Miniature Schnauzer</a>, <a href="West%20Highland%20White%20Terrier">West Highland White Terrier</a>, and <a href="Fox%20Terrier">Fox Terrier</a>.

Beagles are intelligent but, as a result of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in <a href="Stanley%20Coren">Stanley Coren</a>'s "<a href="The%20Intelligence%20of%20Dogs">The Intelligence of Dogs</a>", as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.

Beagles are excellent with children and this is one of the reasons they have become popular family pets, but they are pack animals, and are prone to <a href="separation%20anxiety%20in%20dogs">separation anxiety</a>, a condition which causes them to destroy things when left unattended. Not all beagles will howl, but most will bark when confronted with strange situations, and some will bay (also referred to as "speaking", "giving tongue", or "opening") when they catch the scent of potential quarry. They also generally get along well with other dogs. They are not too demanding with regard to exercise; their inbred stamina means they do not easily tire when exercised, but they also do not need to be worked to exhaustion before they will rest. Regular exercise helps ward off the weight gain to which the breed is prone.

The typical longevity of beagles is 12–15 years, which is a common lifespan for dogs of their size.

Beagles may be prone to <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a>, but this can often be controlled with medication. <a href="Hypothyroidism">Hypothyroidism</a> and a number of types of <a href="dwarfism">dwarfism</a> occur in beagles. Two conditions in particular are unique to the breed: "Funny Puppy", in which the puppy is slow to develop and eventually develops weak legs, a crooked back and although normally healthy, is prone to a range of illnesses; <a href="Hip%20dysplasia%20%28canine%29">Hip dysplasia</a>, common in Harriers and in some larger breeds, is rarely considered a problem in beagles. Beagles are considered a <a href="chondrodystrophy">chondrodystrophic</a> breed, meaning that they are prone to types of disk diseases.

In rare cases, beagles may develop <a href="immune%20mediated%20polygenic%20arthritis">immune mediated polygenic arthritis</a> (where the immune system attacks the joints) even at a young age. The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by <a href="Corticosteroid%23Uses">steroid</a> treatments. Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal <a href="Cerebellar%20abiotrophy">cerebellar cortical degeneration</a>. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.

Their long floppy ears can mean that the inner ear does not receive a substantial air flow or that moist air becomes trapped, and this can lead to ear infections. Beagles may also be affected by a range of eye problems; two common ophthalmic conditions in beagles are <a href="Canine%20glaucoma">glaucoma</a> and <a href="Corneal%20dystrophies%20in%20dogs">corneal dystrophy</a>. "<a href="Cherry%20eye">Cherry eye</a>", a prolapse of the gland of the <a href="third%20eyelid">third eyelid</a>, and <a href="distichiasis">distichiasis</a>, a condition in which eyelashes grow into the eye causing irritation, sometimes exist; both these conditions can be corrected with surgery. They can suffer from several types of <a href="retinal%20atrophy">retinal atrophy</a>. Failure of the nasolacrimal drainage system can cause dry eye or leakage of tears onto the face.

As field dogs they are prone to minor injuries such as cuts and sprains, and, if inactive, obesity is a common problem as they will eat whenever food is available and rely on their owners to regulate their weight. When working or running free they are also likely to pick up parasites such as <a href="flea">flea</a>s, <a href="tick">tick</a>s, <a href="harvest%20mite">harvest mite</a>s, and <a href="tapeworm">tapeworm</a>s, and irritants such as grass seeds can become trapped in their eyes, soft ears, or paws.

Beagles may exhibit a behaviour known as <a href="reverse%20sneezing">reverse sneezing</a>, in which they sound as if they are choking or gasping for breath, but are actually drawing air in through the mouth and nose. The exact cause of this behaviour is not known, but it can be a common occurrence and is not harmful to the dog.

Beagles were developed primarily for hunting hare, an activity known as <a href="beagling">beagling</a>. They were seen as ideal hunting companions for the elderly who could follow on horseback without exerting themselves, for young hunters who could keep up with them on ponies, and for the poorer hunters who could not afford to maintain a stable of good hunting horses. Before the advent of the fashion for foxhunting in the 19th century, hunting was an all day event where the enjoyment was derived from the chase rather than the kill. In this setting the tiny beagle was well matched to the hare, as unlike Harriers they would not quickly finish the hunt, but because of their excellent scent-tracking skills and stamina they were almost guaranteed to eventually catch the hare. The beagle packs would run closely together ("so close that they might be covered with a sheet") which was useful in a long hunt, as it prevented stray dogs from obscuring the trail. In thick undergrowth they were also preferred to <a href="spaniel">spaniel</a>s when hunting <a href="pheasant">pheasant</a>.

With the fashion for faster hunts, the beagle fell out of favour for chasing hare, but was still employed for rabbit hunting. In "Anecdotes of Dogs" (1846), <a href="Edward%20Jesse">Edward Jesse</a> says:

In the United States they appear to have been employed chiefly for hunting rabbits from the earliest imports.
Hunting hare with beagles became popular again in Britain in the mid-19th century and continued until it was made illegal in Scotland by the <a href="Protection%20of%20Wild%20Mammals%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%202002">Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002</a> and in England and Wales by the <a href="Hunting%20Act%202004">Hunting Act 2004</a>. Under this legislation beagles may still pursue rabbits with the <a href="landowner">landowner</a>'s permission. <a href="Drag%20hunting">Drag hunting</a> is popular where hunting is no longer permitted or for those owners who do not wish to participate in hunting a live animal, but still wish to exercise their dog's innate skills.

The traditional foot pack consists of up to 40 beagles, marshaled by a Huntsman who directs the pack and who is assisted by a variable number of whippers-in whose job is to return straying hounds to the pack. The Master of the Hunt is in overall day-to-day charge of the pack, and may or may not take on the role of Huntsman on the day of the hunt.

As hunting with beagles was seen as ideal for young people, many of the British <a href="Independent%20school%20%28UK%29">public schools</a> traditionally maintained beagle packs. Protests were lodged against <a href="Eton%20College">Eton's</a> use of beagles for hunting as early as 1902 but the pack is still in existence today, and a pack used by <a href="Wye%20College">Imperial College</a> in <a href="Wye%2C%20Kent">Wye, Kent</a> was stolen by the <a href="Animal%20Liberation%20Front">Animal Liberation Front</a> in 2001. School and university packs are still maintained by Eton, <a href="Marlborough%20College">Marlborough</a>, Wye, <a href="Radley%20College">Radley</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Agricultural%20University">Royal Agricultural University</a> and <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a>.

In addition to organized beagling, beagles have been used for hunting or flushing to guns (often in pairs) a wide range of game including <a href="snowshoe%20hare">snowshoe hare</a>, <a href="cottontail%20rabbit">cottontail rabbit</a>s, <a href="game%20bird">game bird</a>s, <a href="roe%20deer">roe deer</a>, <a href="red%20deer">red deer</a>, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>, <a href="coyote">coyote</a>, <a href="wild%20boar">wild boar</a> and foxes, and have even been recorded as being used to hunt <a href="stoat">stoat</a>. In most of these cases, the beagle is employed as a gun dog, flushing game for hunter's guns.

Beagles are used as detection dogs in the <a href="Beagle%20Brigade">Beagle Brigade</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a>. These dogs are used to detect food items in luggage being taken into the United States. After trialling several breeds, beagles were chosen because they are relatively small and unintimidating for people who are uncomfortable around dogs, easy to care for, intelligent and work well for rewards. They are also used for this purpose in a number of other countries including by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Agriculture%20and%20Forestry%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry</a> in New Zealand, the <a href="Australian%20Quarantine%20and%20Inspection%20Service">Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service</a>, and in Canada, Japan and the People's Republic of China. Larger breeds are generally used for detection of explosives as this often involves climbing over luggage and on large conveyor belts, work for which the smaller Beagle is not suited.

Beagles are the dog breed most often used in <a href="animal%20testing">animal testing</a>, due to their size and passive nature. Beagles are used in a range of research procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or the environment. Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%). In the UK, the <a href="Animals%20%28Scientific%20Procedures%29%20Act%201986">Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986</a> gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved. In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%). Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as <a href="Harlan%20%28company%29">Harlan</a>. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.
Testing of cosmetic products on animals is banned in the member states of European Community, although France protested the ban and has made efforts to have it lifted. It is permitted in the United States but is not mandatory if safety can be ascertained by other methods, and the test species is not specified by the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA). When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and some drugs and chemicals the FDA uses beagles and <a href="miniature%20pig">miniature pig</a>s as surrogates for direct human testing. Minnesota was the first state to enact a Beagle freedom adoption law in 2014, mandating that dogs and cats are allowed to be adopted once they have completed with research testing.

Anti-<a href="Animal%20testing">vivisection</a> groups have reported on abuse of animals inside testing facilities. In 1997 footage secretly filmed by a freelance journalist inside <a href="Huntingdon%20Life%20Sciences">Huntingdon Life Sciences</a> in the UK showed staff punching and screaming at beagles. <a href="Consort%20Kennels">Consort Kennels</a>, a UK-based breeder of beagles for testing, closed down in 1997 after pressure from animal rights groups.

Although bred for hunting, Beagles are versatile and are nowadays employed for various other roles in detection, therapy, and as family pets.

Beagles are used as sniffer dogs for <a href="termite">termite</a> detection in Australia, and have been mentioned as possible candidates for drug and explosive detection. Because of their gentle nature and unimposing build, they are also frequently used in <a href="pet%20therapy">pet therapy</a>, visiting the sick and elderly in hospital. In June 2006, a trained Beagle assistance dog was credited with saving the life of its owner after using her owner's mobile phone to dial an emergency number. In the aftermath of the <a href="2010%20Haiti%20earthquake">2010 Haiti earthquake</a>, a Beagle <a href="search%20and%20rescue%20dog">search and rescue dog</a> with a Colombian rescue squad was credited with locating the owner of the <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20Montana">Hôtel Montana</a>, who was subsequently rescued after spending 100 hours buried in the rubble. Beagles were hired by New York City to help with bedbug detection, while the role of such dogs in this type of detection may have doubts.

Beagles have been featured across a wide range of media. References to the dog appear before the 19th century in works by such writers as <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, <a href="John%20Webster">John Webster</a>, <a href="John%20Dryden">John Dryden</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Tickell">Thomas Tickell</a>, <a href="Henry%20Fielding">Henry Fielding</a>, and <a href="William%20Cowper">William Cowper</a>, as well as in <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a>'s translation of <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>". Beagles appeared in <a href="funny%20animal">funny animal</a> <a href="comic%20strips">comic strips</a> and <a href="animated%20cartoons">animated cartoons</a> from the 1950s with <a href="Courage%20the%20Cowardly%20Dog">Courage the Cowardly Dog</a> and the "<a href="Peanuts">Peanuts</a>" character <a href="Snoopy">Snoopy</a> billed as "the world's most famous Beagle".

Former US President <a href="Lyndon%20Baines%20Johnson">Lyndon Baines Johnson</a> had several beagles, and caused an outcry when he picked up one of them by its ears during an official greeting on the White House lawn. The ship on which <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> made <a href="Second%20voyage%20of%20HMS%20Beagle">the voyage</a> which provided much of the inspiration for "<a href="On%20the%20Origin%20of%20Species">On the Origin of Species</a>" was named <a href="HMS%20Beagle">HMS "Beagle"</a> after the breed, and, in turn, lent its name to the ill-fated British <a href="Mars">Martian</a> lander "<a href="Beagle%202">Beagle 2</a>". A Canadian bred 15 inch female Beagle with the registered name of Gr Ch <a href="Tashtins%20Lookin%20For%20Trouble">Tashtins Lookin For Trouble</a> and the pet name of "Miss P" won the 2015 <a href="Westminster%20Kennel%20Club%20Dog%20Show">Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show</a>.

Buffer overflow

In <a href="computer%20security">computer security</a> and <a href="computer%20programming">programming</a>, a buffer overflow, or buffer overrun, is an <a href="anomaly%20in%20software">anomaly</a> where a <a href="computer%20program">program</a>, while writing <a href="Data%20%28computing%29">data</a> to a <a href="buffer%20%28computer%20science%29">buffer</a>, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent <a href="Main%20memory">memory</a> locations.

Buffers are areas of memory set aside to hold data, often while moving it from one section of a program to another, or between programs. Buffer overflows can often be triggered by malformed inputs; if one assumes all inputs will be smaller than a certain size and the buffer is created to be that size, then an anomalous transaction that produces more data could cause it to write past the end of the buffer. If this overwrites adjacent data or executable code, this may result in erratic program behavior, including memory access errors, incorrect results, and <a href="crash%20%28computing%29">crashes</a>.

Exploiting the behavior of a buffer overflow is a well-known <a href="exploit%20%28computer%20security%29">security exploit</a>. On many systems, the memory layout of a program, or the system as a whole, is well defined. By sending in data designed to cause a buffer overflow, it is possible to write into areas known to hold <a href="execution%20%28computing%29">executable code</a>, and replace it with malicious code. Buffers are widespread in <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> (OS) code, so it is possible to make attacks that perform <a href="privilege%20escalation">privilege escalation</a> and gain unlimited access to the computer's resources. The famed <a href="Morris%20worm">Morris worm</a> used this as one of its attack techniques.

<a href="Programming%20language">Programming language</a>s commonly associated with buffer overflows include <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a> and <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a>, which provide no built-in protection against accessing or overwriting data in any part of memory and do not automatically check that data written to an <a href="Array%20data%20structure">array</a> (the built-in buffer type) is within the boundaries of that array. <a href="Bounds%20checking">Bounds checking</a> can prevent buffer overflows, but requires additional code and processing time. Modern operating systems use a variety of techniques to combat malicious buffer overflows, notably by <a href="Address%20space%20layout%20randomization">randomizing the layout of memory</a>, or deliberately leaving space between buffers and looking for actions that write into those areas ("canaries").

A buffer overflow occurs when <a href="data">data</a> written to a buffer also corrupts data values in <a href="memory%20address">memory address</a>es adjacent to the destination buffer due to insufficient <a href="bounds%20checking">bounds checking</a>. This can occur when copying data from one buffer to another without first checking that the data fits within the destination buffer.

In the following example expressed in <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a>, a program has two variables which are adjacent in memory: an 8-byte-long string buffer, A, and a two-byte <a href="endianness">big-endian</a> integer, B.

Initially, A contains nothing but zero bytes, and B contains the number 1979.

Now, the program attempts to store the <a href="null-terminated%20string">null-terminated string</a> with <a href="ASCII">ASCII</a> encoding in the A buffer.

B's value has now been inadvertently replaced by a number formed from part of the character string. In this example "e" followed by a zero byte would become 25856.

Writing data past the end of allocated memory can sometimes be detected by the operating system to generate a <a href="segmentation%20fault">segmentation fault</a> error that terminates the process.

To prevent the buffer overflow from happening in this example, the call to <a href="strcpy">strcpy</a> could be replaced with <a href="strncpy">strncpy</a>, which takes the maximum capacity of A as an additional parameter and ensures that no more than this amount of data is written to A:

Note that the above code is not free from problems either; while a buffer overrun has been prevented this time, the <a href="strncpy">strncpy</a> library function does not null-terminate the destination buffer if the source string's length is greater than or equal to the size of the buffer (the third argument passed to the function), therefore A is, in this case, not null-terminated and cannot be treated as a valid C-style string.

The techniques to <a href="exploit%20%28computer%20security%29">exploit</a> a buffer overflow vulnerability vary by <a href="computer%20architecture">architecture</a>, by <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> and by memory region. For example, exploitation on the <a href="heap%20memory">heap</a> (used for dynamically allocated memory), differs markedly from exploitation on the <a href="call%20stack">call stack</a>.

A technically inclined user may exploit stack-based buffer overflows to manipulate the program to their advantage in one of several ways:


If the address of the user-supplied data used to effect the stack buffer overflow is unpredictable, exploiting a stack buffer overflow to cause remote code execution becomes much more difficult. One technique that can be used to exploit such a buffer overflow is called "trampolining". In that technique, an attacker will find a pointer to the vulnerable stack buffer, and compute the location of their <a href="shellcode">shellcode</a> relative to that pointer. Then, they will use the overwrite to jump to an <a href="Opcode">instruction</a> already in memory which will make a second jump, this time relative to the pointer; that second jump will branch execution into the shellcode. Suitable instructions are often present in large code. The <a href="Metasploit%20Project">Metasploit Project</a>, for example, maintains a database of suitable opcodes, though it lists only those found in the <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> operating system.

A buffer overflow occurring in the heap data area is referred to as a heap overflow and is exploitable in a manner different from that of stack-based overflows. Memory on the heap is dynamically allocated by the application at run-time and typically contains program data. Exploitation is performed by corrupting this data in specific ways to cause the application to overwrite internal structures such as linked list pointers. The canonical heap overflow technique overwrites dynamic memory allocation linkage (such as <a href="malloc">malloc</a> meta data) and uses the resulting pointer exchange to overwrite a program function pointer.

<a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s <a href="Graphics%20Device%20Interface">GDI+</a> vulnerability in handling <a href="JPEG">JPEG</a>s is an example of the danger a heap overflow can present.

Manipulation of the buffer, which occurs before it is read or executed, may lead to the failure of an exploitation attempt. These manipulations can mitigate the threat of exploitation, but may not make it impossible. Manipulations could include conversion to upper or lower case, removal of <a href="metacharacter">metacharacter</a>s and filtering out of non-<a href="alphanumeric">alphanumeric</a> strings. However, techniques exist to bypass these filters and manipulations; <a href="alphanumeric%20code">alphanumeric code</a>, <a href="polymorphic%20code">polymorphic code</a>, <a href="self-modifying%20code">self-modifying code</a> and <a href="return-to-libc%20attack">return-to-libc attack</a>s. The same methods can be used to avoid detection by <a href="intrusion%20detection%20system">intrusion detection system</a>s. In some cases, including where code is converted into unicode, the threat of the vulnerability has been misrepresented by the disclosers as only Denial of Service when in fact the remote execution of arbitrary code is possible.

In real-world exploits there are a variety of challenges which need to be overcome for exploits to operate reliably. These factors include null bytes in addresses, variability in the location of shellcode, differences between environments and various counter-measures in operation.

A NOP-sled is the oldest and most widely known technique for successfully exploiting a stack buffer overflow. It solves the problem of finding the exact address of the buffer by effectively increasing the size of the target area. To do this, much larger sections of the stack are corrupted with the <a href="no-op">no-op</a> machine instruction. At the end of the attacker-supplied data, after the no-op instructions, the attacker places an instruction to perform a relative jump to the top of the buffer where the <a href="shellcode">shellcode</a> is located. This collection of no-ops is referred to as the "NOP-sled" because if the return address is overwritten with any address within the no-op region of the buffer, the execution will "slide" down the no-ops until it is redirected to the actual malicious code by the jump at the end. This technique requires the attacker to guess where on the stack the NOP-sled is instead of the comparatively small shellcode.

Because of the popularity of this technique, many vendors of <a href="intrusion%20prevention%20system">intrusion prevention system</a>s will search for this pattern of no-op machine instructions in an attempt to detect shellcode in use. It is important to note that a NOP-sled does not necessarily contain only traditional no-op machine instructions; any instruction that does not corrupt the machine state to a point where the shellcode will not run can be used in place of the hardware assisted no-op. As a result, it has become common practice for exploit writers to compose the no-op sled with randomly chosen instructions which will have no real effect on the shellcode execution.

While this method greatly improves the chances that an attack will be successful, it is not without problems. Exploits using this technique still must rely on some amount of luck that they will guess offsets on the stack that are within the NOP-sled region. An incorrect guess will usually result in the target program crashing and could alert the <a href="system%20administrator">system administrator</a> to the attacker's activities. Another problem is that the NOP-sled requires a much larger amount of memory in which to hold a NOP-sled large enough to be of any use. This can be a problem when the allocated size of the affected buffer is too small and the current depth of the stack is shallow (i.e. there is not much space from the end of the current stack frame to the start of the stack). Despite its problems, the NOP-sled is often the only method that will work for a given platform, environment, or situation; as such it is still an important technique.

The "jump to register" technique allows for reliable exploitation of stack buffer overflows without the need for extra room for a NOP-sled and without having to guess stack offsets. The strategy is to overwrite the return pointer with something that will cause the program to jump to a known pointer stored within a register which points to the controlled buffer and thus the shellcode. For example, if register A contains a pointer to the start of a buffer then any jump or call taking that register as an operand can be used to gain control of the flow of execution. 

In practice a program may not intentionally contain instructions to jump to a particular register. The traditional solution is to find an unintentional instance of a suitable <a href="opcode">opcode</a> at a fixed location somewhere within the program memory. In figure on the left you can see an example of such an unintentional instance of the i386 codice_1 instruction. The opcode for this instruction is codice_2. This two-byte sequence can be found at a one-byte offset from the start of the instruction codice_3 at address codice_4. If an attacker overwrites the program return address with this address the program will first jump to codice_4, interpret the opcode codice_2 as the codice_1 instruction, and will then jump to the top of the stack and execute the attacker's code.

When this technique is possible the severity of the vulnerability increases considerably. This is because exploitation will work reliably enough to automate an attack with a virtual guarantee of success when it is run. For this reason, this is the technique most commonly used in <a href="Internet%20worm">Internet worm</a>s that exploit stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

This method also allows shellcode to be placed after the overwritten return address on the Windows platform. Since executables are mostly based at address codice_8 and x86 is a <a href="Little%20endian">Little Endian</a> architecture, the last byte of the return address must be a null, which terminates the buffer copy and nothing is written beyond that. This limits the size of the shellcode to the size of the buffer, which may be overly restrictive. DLLs are located in high memory (above codice_9) and so have addresses containing no null bytes, so this method can remove null bytes (or other disallowed characters) from the overwritten return address. Used in this way, the method is often referred to as "DLL Trampolining".

Various techniques have been used to detect or prevent buffer overflows, with various tradeoffs. The most reliable way to avoid or prevent buffer overflows is to use automatic protection at the language level. This sort of protection, however, cannot be applied to <a href="legacy%20code">legacy code</a>, and often technical, business, or cultural constraints call for a vulnerable language. The following sections describe the choices and implementations available.

Assembly and C/C++ are popular programming languages that are vulnerable to buffer overflow, in part because they allow direct access to memory and are not strongly typed. C provides no built-in protection against accessing or overwriting data in any part of memory; more specifically, it does not check that data written to a buffer is within the boundaries of that buffer. The standard C++ libraries provide many ways of safely buffering data, and C++'s <a href="Standard%20Template%20Library">Standard Template Library</a> (STL) provides containers that can optionally perform bounds checking if the programmer explicitly calls for checks while accessing data. For example, a codice_10's member function codice_11 performs a bounds check and throws an codice_12 <a href="Exception%20handling">exception</a> if the bounds check fails. However, C++ behaves just like C if the bounds check is not explicitly called. Techniques to avoid buffer overflows also exist for C.

Languages that are strongly typed and don't allow direct memory access, such as COBOL, Java, Python, and others, prevent buffer overflow from occurring in most cases. Many programming languages other than C/C++ provide runtime checking and in some cases even compile-time checking which might send a warning or raise an exception when C or C++ would overwrite data and continue to execute further instructions until erroneous results are obtained which might or might not cause the program to crash. Examples of such languages include <a href="Ada%20%28programming%20language%29">Ada</a>, <a href="Eiffel%20%28programming%20language%29">Eiffel</a>, <a href="Lisp%20%28programming%20language%29">Lisp</a>, <a href="Modula-2">Modula-2</a>, <a href="Smalltalk">Smalltalk</a>, <a href="OCaml">OCaml</a> and such C-derivatives as <a href="Cyclone%20%28programming%20language%29">Cyclone</a>, <a href="Rust%20%28programming%20language%29">Rust</a> and <a href="D%20%28programming%20language%29">D</a>. The <a href="Java%20%28software%20platform%29">Java</a> and <a href=".NET%20Framework">.NET Framework</a> bytecode environments also require bounds checking on all arrays. Nearly every <a href="interpreted%20programming%20language">interpreted language</a> will protect against buffer overflows, signaling a well-defined error condition. Often where a language provides enough type information to do bounds checking an option is provided to enable or disable it. <a href="Static%20code%20analysis">Static code analysis</a> can remove many dynamic bound and type checks, but poor implementations and awkward cases can significantly decrease performance. Software engineers must carefully consider the tradeoffs of safety versus performance costs when deciding which language and compiler setting to use.

The problem of buffer overflows is common in the C and C++ languages because they expose low level representational details of buffers as containers for data types. Buffer overflows must thus be avoided by maintaining a high degree of correctness in code which performs buffer management. It has also long been recommended to avoid standard library functions which are not bounds checked, such as codice_13, codice_14 and codice_15. The <a href="Morris%20worm">Morris worm</a> exploited a codice_16 call in <a href="fingerd">fingerd</a>.

Well-written and tested abstract data type libraries which centralize and automatically perform buffer management, including bounds checking, can reduce the occurrence and impact of buffer overflows. The two main building-block data types in these languages in which buffer overflows commonly occur are strings and arrays; thus, libraries preventing buffer overflows in these data types can provide the vast majority of the necessary coverage. Still, failure to use these safe libraries correctly can result in buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities; and naturally, any bug in the library itself is a potential vulnerability. "Safe" library implementations include "The Better String Library", Vstr and Erwin. The <a href="OpenBSD">OpenBSD</a> operating system's <a href="C%20library">C library</a> provides the <a href="strlcpy">strlcpy</a> and <a href="strlcat">strlcat</a> functions, but these are more limited than full safe library implementations.

In September 2007, Technical Report 24731, prepared by the C standards committee, was published; it specifies a set of functions which are based on the standard C library's string and I/O functions, with additional buffer-size parameters. However, the efficacy of these functions for the purpose of reducing buffer overflows is disputable; it requires programmer intervention on a per function call basis that is equivalent to intervention that could make the analogous older standard library functions buffer overflow safe.

Buffer overflow protection is used to detect the most common buffer overflows by checking that the <a href="call%20stack">stack</a> has not been altered when a function returns. If it has been altered, the program exits with a <a href="segmentation%20fault">segmentation fault</a>. Three such systems are Libsafe, and the "<a href="StackGuard">StackGuard</a>" and "<a href="ProPolice">ProPolice</a>" <a href="GNU%20Compiler%20Collection">gcc</a> patches.

Microsoft's implementation of <a href="Data%20Execution%20Prevention">Data Execution Prevention</a> (DEP) mode explicitly protects the pointer to the <a href="Structured%20Exception%20Handler">Structured Exception Handler</a> (SEH) from being overwritten.

Stronger stack protection is possible by splitting the stack in two: one for data and one for function returns. This split is present in the <a href="Forth%20%28programming%20language%29">Forth language</a>, though it was not a security-based design decision. Regardless, this is not a complete solution to buffer overflows, as sensitive data other than the return address may still be overwritten.

Buffer overflows work by manipulating pointers (including stored addresses). PointGuard was proposed as a compiler-extension to prevent attackers from being able to reliably manipulate pointers and addresses. The approach works by having the compiler add code to automatically XOR-encode pointers before and after they are used. Because the attacker (theoretically) does not know what value will be used to encode/decode the pointer, he cannot predict what it will point to if he overwrites it with a new value. PointGuard was never released, but Microsoft implemented a similar approach beginning in Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 SP1. Rather than implement pointer protection as an automatic feature, Microsoft added an API routine that can be called at the discretion of the programmer. This allows for better performance (because it is not used all of the time), but places the burden on the programmer to know when it is necessary.

Because XOR is linear, an attacker may be able to manipulate an encoded pointer by overwriting only the lower bytes of an address. This can allow an attack to succeed if the attacker is able to attempt the exploit multiple times or is able to complete an attack by causing a pointer to point to one of several locations (such as any location within a NOP sled). Microsoft added a random rotation to their encoding scheme to address this weakness to partial overwrites.

Executable space protection is an approach to buffer overflow protection which prevents execution of code on the stack or the heap. An attacker may use buffer overflows to insert arbitrary code into the memory of a program, but with executable space protection, any attempt to execute that code will cause an exception.

Some CPUs support a feature called <a href="NX%20bit">NX</a> ("No eXecute") or <a href="XD%20bit">XD</a> ("eXecute Disabled") bit, which in conjunction with software, can be used to mark <a href="paging">pages of data</a> (such as those containing the stack and the heap) as readable and writeable but not executable.

Some Unix operating systems (e.g. <a href="OpenBSD">OpenBSD</a>, <a href="macOS">macOS</a>) ship with executable space protection (e.g. <a href="W%5EX">W^X</a>). Some optional packages include:


Newer variants of Microsoft Windows also support executable space protection, called <a href="Data%20Execution%20Prevention">Data Execution Prevention</a>. <a href="proprietary%20software">Proprietary</a> add-ons include:


Executable space protection does not generally protect against <a href="return-to-libc%20attack">return-to-libc attack</a>s, or any other attack which does not rely on the execution of the attackers code. However, on <a href="64-bit">64-bit</a> systems using <a href="ASLR">ASLR</a>, as described below, executable space protection makes it far more difficult to execute such attacks.

Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is a computer security feature which involves arranging the positions of key data areas, usually including the base of the executable and position of libraries, heap, and stack, randomly in a process' address space.

Randomization of the <a href="virtual%20memory">virtual memory</a> addresses at which functions and variables can be found can make exploitation of a buffer overflow more difficult, but not impossible. It also forces the attacker to tailor the exploitation attempt to the individual system, which foils the attempts of <a href="internet%20worm">internet worm</a>s. A similar but less effective method is to <a href="rebasing">rebase</a> processes and libraries in the virtual address space.

The use of deep packet inspection (DPI) can detect, at the network perimeter, very basic remote attempts to exploit buffer overflows by use of attack signatures and <a href="heuristic%20%28computer%20science%29">heuristics</a>. These are able to block packets which have the signature of a known attack, or if a long series of No-Operation instructions (known as a NOP-sled) is detected, these were once used when the location of the exploit's <a href="payload%20%28software%29">payload</a> is slightly variable.

Packet scanning is not an effective method since it can only prevent known attacks and there are many ways that a NOP-sled can be encoded. <a href="Shellcode">Shellcode</a> used by attackers can be made <a href="alphanumeric%20code">alphanumeric</a>, <a href="metamorphic%20code">metamorphic</a>, or <a href="self-modifying%20code">self-modifying</a> to evade detection by heuristic packet scanners and <a href="intrusion%20detection%20system">intrusion detection system</a>s.

Checking for buffer overflows and patching the bugs that cause them naturally helps prevent buffer overflows. One common automated technique for discovering them is <a href="fuzzer">fuzzing</a>. Edge case testing can also uncover buffer overflows, as can static analysis. Once a potential buffer overflow is detected, it must be patched; this makes the testing approach useful for software that is in development, but less useful for legacy software that is no longer maintained or supported.

Buffer overflows were understood and partially publicly documented as early as 1972, when the Computer Security Technology Planning Study laid out the technique: "The code performing this function does not check the source and destination addresses properly, permitting portions of the monitor to be overlaid by the user. This can be used to inject code into the monitor that will permit the user to seize control of the machine." (Page 61) Today, the monitor would be referred to as the kernel.

The earliest documented hostile exploitation of a buffer overflow was in 1988. It was one of several exploits used by the <a href="Morris%20worm">Morris worm</a> to propagate itself over the Internet. The program exploited was a <a href="service%20%28computing%29">service</a> on <a href="Unix">Unix</a> called <a href="Finger%20protocol">finger</a>. Later, in 1995, Thomas Lopatic independently rediscovered the buffer overflow and published his findings on the <a href="Bugtraq">Bugtraq</a> security mailing list. A year later, in 1996, <a href="Elias%20Levy">Elias Levy</a> (also known as Aleph One) published in "<a href="Phrack">Phrack</a>" magazine the paper "Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit", a step-by-step introduction to exploiting stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

Since then, at least two major internet worms have exploited buffer overflows to compromise a large number of systems. In 2001, the <a href="Code%20Red%20worm">Code Red worm</a> exploited a buffer overflow in Microsoft's <a href="Internet%20Information%20Services">Internet Information Services</a> (IIS) 5.0 and in 2003 the <a href="SQL%20Slammer">SQL Slammer</a> worm compromised machines running <a href="Microsoft%20SQL%20Server%202000">Microsoft SQL Server 2000</a>.

In 2003, buffer overflows present in licensed <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> games have been exploited to allow unlicensed software, including <a href="homebrew%20%28video%20games%29">homebrew games</a>, to run on the console without the need for hardware modifications, known as <a href="modchip">modchip</a>s. The <a href="PS2%20Independence%20Exploit">PS2 Independence Exploit</a> also used a buffer overflow to achieve the same for the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>. The Twilight hack accomplished the same with the <a href="Wii">Wii</a>, using a buffer overflow in "".

Barry Bonds

Barry Lamar Bonds (born July 24, 1964) is an American former <a href="professional%20baseball">professional baseball</a> <a href="left%20fielder">left fielder</a> who played 22 seasons in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) with the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> and <a href="San%20Francisco%20Giants">San Francisco Giants</a>. Bonds received seven <a href="National%20League">NL</a> <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">MVP</a> awards and 14 <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star</a> selections, and is considered to be one of the greatest baseball players of all time.

Bonds was regarded as an exceptional <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hitter</a>: he led MLB in <a href="on-base%20plus%20slugging">on-base plus slugging</a> six times, and placed within the top five hitters in 12 of his 17 <a href="Batting%20average%23Qualifications%20for%20the%20batting%20title">qualifying</a> seasons. He holds many MLB hitting records, including most career <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s, most home runs in a single season (73, set in 2001) and most career walks. He also received eight <a href="Rawlings%20Gold%20Glove%20Award">Gold Gloves</a> for his defense in the <a href="outfield">outfield</a>. He is ranked second in career <a href="Wins%20Above%20Replacement">Wins Above Replacement</a> among all major league <a href="position%20player">position player</a>s by both <a href="Fangraphs">Fangraphs</a> and <a href="Baseball-Reference.com">Baseball-Reference.com</a>, behind only <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>.

Bonds led a controversial career, notably as a central figure in baseball's <a href="Banned%20substances%20in%20baseball%20in%20the%20United%20States">steroids scandal</a>. In 2007, he was indicted on charges of <a href="perjury">perjury</a> and <a href="obstruction%20of%20justice">obstruction of justice</a> for allegedly lying to the grand jury during the federal government's investigation of <a href="Bay%20Area%20Laboratory%20Co-Operative">BALCO</a>. The perjury charges against Bonds were dropped and an initial obstruction of justice conviction was overturned in 2015.

Bonds has not been elected into the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in his first five years of eligibility.

Bonds served as the hitting coach for the <a href="Miami%20Marlins">Miami Marlins</a> in 2016, and was let go at the end of the season.

Born in <a href="Riverside%2C%20California">Riverside, California</a> to Patricia (née Howard) and former major leaguer <a href="Bobby%20Bonds">Bobby Bonds</a>, Bonds grew up in <a href="San%20Carlos%2C%20California">San Carlos</a> and attended <a href="Jun%C3%ADpero%20Serra%20High%20School%20%28San%20Mateo%2C%20California%29">Junípero Serra High School</a> in <a href="San%20Mateo%2C%20California">San Mateo</a>, where he excelled in <a href="baseball">baseball</a>, <a href="basketball">basketball</a>, and <a href="American%20football">football</a>. He played on the <a href="junior%20varsity%20team">junior varsity team</a> during his freshman year and the remainder of his high school career on the <a href="varsity%20team">varsity team</a>. He batted for a .467 <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> his senior year, and was named prep <a href="All-America">All-America</a>n. The Giants drafted Bonds in the second round of the <a href="1982%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft">1982 MLB draft</a> as a high school senior, but the Giants and Bonds were unable to agree on contract terms when <a href="Tom%20Haller">Tom Haller</a>'s maximum offer was $70,000 ($ today) and Bond's minimum to go pro was $75,000, so Bonds instead decided to attend college.

Bonds attended <a href="Arizona%20State%20University">Arizona State University</a>, hitting .347 with 45 home runs and 175 <a href="runs%20batted%20in">runs batted in</a> (RBI). In 1984 he batted .360 and had 30 <a href="stolen%20base">stolen base</a>s. In 1985, he hit 23 home runs with 66 RBIs and a .368 batting average. He was a <a href="Sporting%20News">Sporting News</a> All-American selection that year. He tied the <a href="NCAA">NCAA</a> record with seven consecutive hits in the <a href="College%20World%20Series">College World Series</a> as sophomore and was named to All-Time College World Series Team in 1996. He graduated from Arizona State in 1986 with a degree in <a href="criminology">criminology</a>. He was named ASU On Deck Circle Most Valuable Player; other winners include <a href="Dustin%20Pedroia">Dustin Pedroia</a>, <a href="Willie%20Bloomquist">Willie Bloomquist</a>, <a href="Paul%20Lo%20Duca">Paul Lo Duca</a>, and <a href="Ike%20Davis">Ike Davis</a>. During college, he played part of one summer in the amateur <a href="Alaska%20Baseball%20League">Alaska Baseball League</a> with the <a href="Alaska%20Goldpanners">Alaska Goldpanners</a>.

The <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> drafted Bonds as the sixth overall pick of the <a href="1985%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft">1985 Major League Baseball draft</a>. He joined the <a href="Potomac%20Nationals">Prince William Pirates</a> of the <a href="Carolina%20League">Carolina League</a> and was named July 1985 Player of the Month for the league. In 1986, he hit .311 in 44 games for the <a href="Hawaii%20Islanders">Hawaii Islanders</a> of the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a>.

Before Bonds made it to the major leagues in Pittsburgh, Pirate fan attendance was low, with 1984 and 1985 attendance below 10,000 per game for the 81-game home schedule. Bonds made his major league debut on May 30, 1986. In 1986, Bonds led <a href="National%20League">National League</a> (NL) rookies with 16 home runs, 48 RBI, 36 stolen bases and 65 walks, but he finished 6th in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">Rookie of the Year</a> voting. He played <a href="Center%20fielder">center field</a> in 1986, but switched to <a href="left%20field">left field</a> with the arrival of centerfielder <a href="Andy%20Van%20Slyke">Andy Van Slyke</a> in 1987.

In his early years, Bonds batted as the <a href="leadoff%20hitter">leadoff hitter</a>. With Van Slyke also in the outfield, the Pirates had a venerable defensive tandem that worked together to cover a lot of ground on the field although they were not close off the field. The Pirates experienced a surge in fan enthusiasm with Bonds on the team and set the club attendance record of 52,119 in the 1987 home opener. That year, he hit 25 home runs in his second season, along with 32 stolen bases and 59 RBIs.

Bonds improved in 1988, hitting .283 with 24 home runs. The Pirates broke the record set the previous year with 54,089 attending the home opener. Bonds now fit into a highly respected lineup featuring <a href="Bobby%20Bonilla">Bobby Bonilla</a>, Van Slyke and <a href="Jay%20Bell">Jay Bell</a>. He finished with 19 homers, 58 RBIs, and 14 outfield <a href="assist%20%28baseball%29">assists</a> in 1989, which was second in the NL. Following the season, rumors that he would be traded to the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> for <a href="Jeff%20Hamilton%20%28baseball%29">Jeff Hamilton</a> and <a href="John%20Wetteland">John Wetteland</a>, but the team denied the rumors and no such trade occurred.

Bonds won his first <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">MVP Award</a> in 1990, hitting .301 with 33 home runs and 114 RBIs. He also stole 52 bases, which were third in the league, to become a first-time member of the <a href="30%E2%80%9330%20club">30–30 club</a>. He won his first <a href="Gold%20Glove%20Award">Gold Glove Award</a> and <a href="Silver%20Slugger%20Award">Silver Slugger Award</a>. That year, the Pirates won the <a href="National%20League%20East">National League East</a> title for their first postseason berth since winning the <a href="1979%20World%20Series">1979 World Series</a>. However, the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> (whose last post-season berth had also been in 1979; they lost to the Pirates in <a href="1979%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">that year's NLCS</a>) defeated the Pirates in the <a href="1990%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">NLCS</a> en route to winning the <a href="1990%20World%20Series">World Championship</a>.

In 1991, Bonds also put up great numbers, hitting 25 homers and driving in 116 runs, and obtained another Gold Glove and Silver Slugger. He finished second to the <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a>' <a href="Terry%20Pendleton">Terry Pendleton</a> (the NL batting champion) in the MVP voting. The Pirates slugging outfield of Bonds, Bonilla and Van Slyke performed miserably in the 1990 and 1991 playoffs hitting .190 in 1990 (12 for 63) and .200 in 1991 (15 for 75).

In March 1992, Pirates general manager <a href="Ted%20Simmons">Ted Simmons</a> agreed to a deal with Atlanta Braves counterpart <a href="John%20Schuerholz">John Schuerholz</a> to trade Bonds, in exchange for <a href="Alejandro%20Pe%C3%B1a">Alejandro Peña</a>, <a href="Keith%20Mitchell%20%28baseball%29">Keith Mitchell</a>, and a player to be named later. Pirates manager <a href="Jim%20Leyland">Jim Leyland</a> opposed the trade vehemently, and the proposal was rescinded. Bonds stayed with Pittsburgh and won his second MVP award that season. While hitting .311 with 34 homers and 103 RBIs, he propelled the Pirates to their third straight <a href="National%20League%20East">National League East</a> division title. However, Pittsburgh was defeated by the Braves in a seven-game <a href="1992%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">National League Championship Series</a>. Bonds participated in the final play of <a href="1992%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series%20Game%207">Game 7</a> of the NLCS, whereby he fielded a base hit by <a href="Francisco%20Cabrera%20%28baseball%29">Francisco Cabrera</a> and attempted to throw out <a href="Sid%20Bream">Sid Bream</a> at home plate. But the throw to Pirates catcher <a href="Mike%20LaValliere">Mike LaValliere</a> was late and Bream scored the winning run. For the third consecutive season, the NL East Champion Pirates were denied a trip to the World Series. Following the loss, Bonds and star teammate <a href="Doug%20Drabek">Doug Drabek</a> were expected to command salaries too high for Pittsburgh to again sign them.

In 1993, Bonds left the Pirates to sign a lucrative <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a> contract worth a then-record $43.75 million ($ million today) over six years with the Giants, with whom his father had spent the first seven years of his career, and with whom his godfather <a href="Willie%20Mays">Willie Mays</a> played 22 of his 24 Major League seasons. The deal was at that time the largest in baseball history, in terms of both total value and average annual salary.

Once he signed with the Giants, Bonds had intended to wear 24, his number during most of his stay with the Pirates, and after receiving Mays' blessing the Giants were willing to unretire it until the public commotion from fans and media became too much. To honor his father, Bonds switched his jersey number to 25, as it had been Bobby's number in San Francisco.

Bonds hit .336 in 1993, leading the league with 46 home runs and 123 RBI en route to his second consecutive MVP award, and third overall. As good as the Giants were (winning 103 games), the <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a> won 104 in what some call the last great pennant race (because the <a href="Wild%20card%20%28sports%29%23Major%20League%20Baseball">wild card</a> was instituted shortly thereafter).

In the lockout-shortened season of 1994, Bonds hit .312 with 37 home runs and a league-leading 74 walks, and he finished 4th in MVP voting.

In 1995, Bonds hit 33 homers and drove in 104 runs, hitting .294 but finished only 12th in MVP voting. In 1994, he appeared in a small role as himself in the television film "<a href="Jane%27s%20House">Jane's House</a>", starring <a href="James%20Woods">James Woods</a> and <a href="Anne%20Archer">Anne Archer</a>.

In 1996, Bonds became the first National League player and second (of the current list of four) major league player(s) to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in the same season. The other members of the <a href="40%E2%80%9340%20club">40–40 club</a> are <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Canseco">José Canseco</a>–1988, <a href="Alex%20Rodriguez">Alex Rodriguez</a>–1998, and <a href="Alfonso%20Soriano">Alfonso Soriano</a>–2006; his father Bobby Bonds was one home run short in 1973 when he hit 39 home runs and stole 43 bases.

Bonds hit his 300th and 301st home runs off the <a href="Florida%20Marlins">Florida Marlins</a>' <a href="John%20Burkett">John Burkett</a> on April 27. He became the fourth player in history to join the 300–300 club with 300 stolen bases and 300 home runs for a career, joining <a href="Willie%20Mays">Willie Mays</a>, <a href="Andre%20Dawson">Andre Dawson</a>, and his father. Bonds's totals for the season included 129 runs driven in, a .308 average and a then-National League record 151 walks. He finished fifth in the MVP balloting.

In 1997, Bonds hit .291, his lowest average since 1989. He hit 40 home runs for the second straight year and drove in 101 runs, leading the league in walks again with 145. He tied his father in 1997 for having the most 30/30 seasons, and he again placed fifth in the MVP balloting.

With two outs in the 9th inning of a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 28, 1998, Bonds became only the fifth player in baseball history to be given an <a href="intentional%20walk">intentional walk</a> with the bases loaded. <a href="Nap%20Lajoie">Nap Lajoie</a> (1901), <a href="Del%20Bissonette">Del Bissonette</a> (1928) and <a href="Bill%20Nicholson%20%28baseball%29">Bill Nicholson</a> (1944) were three others in the 20th century who received that rare honor. The first to receive one was <a href="Abner%20Dalrymple">Abner Dalrymple</a> in 1881. During a game against the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> on August 2, Bonds was hit by a pitch thrown by <a href="Ricky%20Bottalico">Ricky Bottalico</a>, leading to Bonds charging the mound and triggering a <a href="bench-clearing%20brawl">bench-clearing brawl</a>.

On August 23, Bonds hit his 400th career home run. By doing so, he became the first player ever to enter the 400–400 club by having career totals of 400 home runs and 400 stolen bases. The milestone home run came off <a href="Kirt%20Ojala">Kirt Ojala</a>, who, like Burkett, was pitching for the Marlins. For the season, he hit .303 with 37 home runs and drove in 122 runs, winning his eighth Gold Glove, He finished 8th in the MVP voting.

<a href="Bill%20James">Bill James</a> ranked Bonds as the best player of the 1990s. He added that the decade's second-best player, <a href="Craig%20Biggio">Craig Biggio</a>, had been closer in production to the decade's 10th-best player than to Bonds. In 1999, with statistics through 1997 being considered, Bonds ranked Number 34 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, making him the highest-ranking active player.

When the Sporting News list was redone in 2005, Bonds was ranked 6th behind Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a>, <a href="Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a>, and <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Hank Aaron</a>. Bonds was omitted from 1999's Major League Baseball All-Century Team, to which <a href="Ken%20Griffey%2C%20Jr.">Ken Griffey, Jr.</a> was elected. James wrote of Bonds, "Certainly the most unappreciated superstar of my lifetime. ... Griffey has always been more popular, but Bonds has been a far, far greater player." In 1999, he rated Bonds as the 16th-best player of all time. "When people begin to take in all of his accomplishments", he predicted, "Bonds may well be rated among the five greatest players in the history of the game."

In 2000, the following year, Bonds hit .306 with career bests through that time in both slugging percentage (.688) and home runs (49) in just 143 games. He also drew a league-leading 117 walks.

The next year, Bonds's offensive production reached even higher levels, breaking not only his own personal records but several major league records. In the Giants' first 50 games in 2001, he hit 28 home runs, including 17 in May—a career high. This early stretch included his 500th home run hit on April 17 against <a href="Terry%20Adams%20%28baseball%29">Terry Adams</a> of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>. He also hit 39 home runs by the All-star break (a major league record), drew a major league record 177 walks, and had a .515 on-base average, a feat not seen since Mickey Mantle and Ted Williams over forty years earlier. Bonds's slugging percentage was a major league record .863 (411 total bases in 476 at-bats), and, most impressively, he ended the season with a major league record 73 home runs.

On October 4, Bonds tied the previous record of 70 set by <a href="Mark%20McGwire">Mark McGwire</a> – which McGwire set in the 162nd game in 1998 – by homering off <a href="Wilfredo%20Rodr%C3%ADguez">Wilfredo Rodríguez</a> in the 159th game of the season. He then hit numbers 71 and 72 the following night off <a href="Chan%20Ho%20Park">Chan Ho Park</a>. Bonds added his 73rd off <a href="Dennis%20Springer">Dennis Springer</a> on October 7. The ball was later sold to toy manufacturer Todd McFarlane for $450,000. He previously bought Mark McGwire's 70th home run ball from 1998. Bonds received the <a href="Babe%20Ruth%20Home%20Run%20Award">Babe Ruth Home Run Award</a> for leading MLB in homers that season.

Bonds re-signed with the Giants for a five-year, $90 million contract in January 2002. He hit five home runs in the Giants' first four games of the season, tying <a href="Lou%20Brock">Lou Brock</a>'s 35-year record for most home runs after four games. He won the NL batting title with a career-high .370 average and struck out only 47 times. He hit 46 home runs in 403 at-bats.

Despite playing in nine fewer games than the previous season, he drew 198 walks, a major-league record; 68 of them were intentional walks, surpassing <a href="Willie%20McCovey">Willie McCovey</a>'s 45 in 1969 for another Major League record. He slugged .799, then the fourth-highest total all time. Bonds broke Ted Williams' major league record for on-base average with .582. Bonds also hit his 600th home run, less than a year and a half after hitting his 500th. The home run came on August 9 at home against <a href="Kip%20Wells">Kip Wells</a> of the Pirates.

Bonds batted .322 with 8 home runs, 16 RBI, and 27 walks in the postseason en route to the <a href="2002%20World%20Series">2002 World Series</a>, which the Giants lost 4–3 to the <a href="Anaheim%20Angels">Anaheim Angels</a>.

In 2003, Bonds played in just 130 games. He hit 45 home runs in just 390 at-bats, along with a .341 batting average. He slugged .749, walked 148 times, and had an on-base average well over .500 (.529) for the third straight year. He also became the only member of the career 500 home run/500 stolen base club by stealing second base on June 23 off of pitcher <a href="%C3%89ric%20Gagn%C3%A9">Éric Gagné</a> in the 11th inning of a tied ball game against the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> (against whom Bonds had tallied his 500th home run). Bonds scored the game-winning run later that inning.

In 2004, Bonds had perhaps his best season. He hit .362 en route to his second National League batting title, and broke his own record by walking 232 times. He slugged .812, which was fourth-highest of all time, and broke his on-base percentage record with a .609 average. Bonds passed Mays on the career home run list by hitting his 661st off of <a href="Ben%20Ford%20%28baseball%29">Ben Ford</a> on April 13, He then hit his 700th off of <a href="Jake%20Peavy">Jake Peavy</a> on September 17. Bonds hit 45 home runs in 373 at-bats, and struck out just 41 times, putting himself in elite company, as few major leaguers have ever had more home runs than strikeouts in a season. Bonds would win his fourth consecutive MVP award and his seventh overall. His seven MVP awards are four more than any other player in history. In addition, no other player from either league has been awarded the MVP four times in a row. (The MVP award was first given in 1931). The 40-year-old Bonds also broke <a href="Willie%20Stargell">Willie Stargell</a>'s 25-year record as the oldest player to win a Most Valuable Player Award (Stargell, at 39 years, 8 months, was National League co-MVP with <a href="Keith%20Hernandez">Keith Hernandez</a> in 1979). On July 4, he tied and passed <a href="Rickey%20Henderson">Rickey Henderson</a>'s career bases on balls record with his 2190th and 2191st career walks.

As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron was called on for his opinion of Bonds. He clarified that he was a fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk for Bonds's alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans. As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with <a href="Pete%20Rose">Pete Rose</a> could be emphasized less. In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games. Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.

Bonds's salary for the 2005 season was $22 million, the second-highest salary in Major League Baseball (the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">Yankees</a>' <a href="Alex%20Rodriguez">Alex Rodriguez</a> earned the highest, $25.2 million).
Bonds endured a knee injury, multiple surgeries, and rehabilitation. He was activated on September 12 and started in left field. In his return against the <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres">San Diego Padres</a>, he nearly hit a home run in his first at-bat. Bonds finished the night 1-for-4. Upon his return, Bonds resumed his high-caliber performance at the plate, hitting home runs in four consecutive games from September 18 to 21 and finishing with five homers in only 14 games.

In 2006, Bonds earned $20 million (not including bonuses), the fourth highest salary in baseball. Through the 2006 season he had earned approximately $172 million during his then 21-year career, making him baseball's all-time highest paid player. Bonds hit under .200 for his first 10 games of the season and did not hit a home run until April 22. This 10-game stretch was his longest home run slump since the 1998 season. On May 7, Bonds drew within one home run of tying Babe Ruth for second place on the all-time list, hitting his 713th career home run into the second level of <a href="Citizens%20Bank%20Park">Citizens Bank Park</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, off pitcher <a href="Jon%20Lieber">Jon Lieber</a> in a game in which the Giants lost to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a>. The towering home run—one of the longest in Citizens Bank Park's two-season history, traveling an estimated 450 feet (140 m)—hit off the facade of the third deck in right field.

On May 20, Bonds tied Ruth, hitting his 714th career home run to deep right field to lead off the top of the 2nd inning. The home run came off left-handed pitcher <a href="Brad%20Halsey">Brad Halsey</a> of the <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Oakland A's</a>, in an <a href="interleague%20play">interleague</a> game played in <a href="Oakland%2C%20California">Oakland, California</a>. Since this was an interleague game at an American League stadium, Bonds was batting as the <a href="designated%20hitter">designated hitter</a> in the lineup for the Giants. Bonds was quoted after the game as being "glad it's over with" and stated that more attention could be focused on <a href="Albert%20Pujols">Albert Pujols</a>, who was on a very rapid home run pace in early 2006.
On May 28, Bonds passed Ruth, hitting his 715th career home run to center field off <a href="Colorado%20Rockies">Colorado Rockies</a> pitcher <a href="Byung-hyun%20Kim">Byung-hyun Kim</a>. The ball was hit an estimated 445 feet (140 m) into center field where it went through the hands of several fans but then fell onto an elevated platform in center field. Then it rolled off the platform where Andrew Morbitzer, a 38-year-old San Francisco resident, caught the ball while he was in line at a concession stand. Mysteriously, radio broadcaster <a href="Dave%20Flemming">Dave Flemming</a>'s radio play-by-play of the home run went silent just as the ball was hit, apparently from a microphone failure. But the televised version, called by Giants broadcaster <a href="Duane%20Kuiper">Duane Kuiper</a>, was not affected.
On September 22, Bonds tied Henry Aaron's National League career home run record of 733. The home run came in the top of the 6th inning of a high-scoring game against the Milwaukee Brewers, at <a href="Miller%20Park%20%28Milwaukee%29">Miller Park</a> in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The achievement was notable for its occurrence in the very city where Aaron began (with the Milwaukee Braves) and concluded (with the Brewers, then in the American League) his career. With the Giants trailing 10–8, Bonds hit a blast to deep center field on a 2–0 pitch off the Brewers' <a href="Chris%20Spurling">Chris Spurling</a> with runners on first and second and one out. Though the Giants were at the time clinging to only a slim chance of making the playoffs, Bonds's home run provided the additional drama of giving the Giants an 11–10 lead late in a critical game in the final days of a pennant race. The Brewers eventually won the game, 13–12, though Bonds went 3 for 5, with 2 doubles, the record-tying home run, and 6 runs batted in.

On September 23, Bonds surpassed Aaron for the NL career home run record. Hit in Milwaukee like the previous one, this was a solo home run off <a href="Chris%20Capuano">Chris Capuano</a> of the Brewers. This was the last home run Bonds hit in 2006. In 2006, Bonds recorded his lowest <a href="slugging%20percentage">slugging percentage</a> (a statistic that he has historically ranked among league leaders season after season) since 1991 with the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>.

In January 2007, the "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>" reported that Bonds had tested positive for <a href="amphetamine">amphetamine</a>s. Under baseball's amphetamine policy, which had been in effect for one season, players testing positive were to submit to six additional tests and undergo treatment and counseling. The policy also stated that players were not to be identified for a first positive test, but the "New York Daily News" leaked the test's results. When the Players Association informed Bonds of the test results, he initially attributed it to a substance he had taken from the locker of Giants teammate <a href="Mark%20Sweeney">Mark Sweeney</a>, but would later retract this claim and publicly apologize to Sweeney.

On January 29, 2007, the Giants finalized a contract with Bonds for the 2007 season. After the commissioner's office rejected Bonds's one-year, $15.8 million deal because it contained a personal-appearance provision, the team sent revised documents to his agent, <a href="Jeff%20Borris">Jeff Borris</a>, who stated that "At this time, Barry is not signing the new documents." Bonds signed a revised one-year, $15.8 million contract on February 15 and reported to the Giants' Spring training camp on time.

Bonds resumed his march to the all-time record early in the 2007 season. After an opening game in which all he had was a first-inning single past third base against a right-shifted infield (immediately followed by a stolen base and then a base-running misjudgment that got him thrown out at home) and a deep out to left field late in the game, Bonds returned the next day, April 4, with another mission. In his first at-bat of the season's second game at the Giants' AT&T Park, Bonds hit a <a href="Chris%20Young%20%28pitcher%29">Chris Young</a> (of the San Diego Padres) pitch just over the wall to the left of straightaway center field for career home run 735. This home run put Bonds past the midway point between Ruth and Aaron.

Bonds did not homer again until April 13, when he hit two (736 and 737) in a 3 for 3 night that included 4 RBI against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Bonds splashed a pitch by <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> pitcher <a href="Ryan%20Franklin">Ryan Franklin</a> into <a href="McCovey%20Cove">McCovey Cove</a> on April 18 for home run 738. Home runs number 739 and 740 came in back to back games on April 21 and 22 against the Arizona Diamondbacks.

The hype surrounding Bonds's pursuit of the home run record escalated on May 14. On this day, Sports Auction for Heritage (a Dallas-based auction house) offered US$1 million to the fan who would catch Bonds's record-breaking 756th-career home run. The million dollar offer was rescinded on June 11 out of concern of fan safety. Home run 748 came on Father's Day, June 17, in the final game of a 3-game road series against the Boston Red Sox at <a href="Fenway%20Park">Fenway Park</a>, where Bonds had never previously played. With this homer, Fenway Park became the 36th major league ballpark in which Bonds had hit a home run. He hit a <a href="Tim%20Wakefield">Tim Wakefield</a> knuckleball just over the low fence into the Giant's bullpen in right field. It was his first home run off his former Pittsburgh Pirate teammate, who became the 441st different pitcher to surrender a four-bagger to Bonds. The 750th career home run, hit on June 29, also came off a former teammate: <a href="Liv%C3%A1n%20Hern%C3%A1ndez">Liván Hernández</a>. The blast came in the 8th inning and at that point tied the game at 3–3.

On July 19, after a 21 at-bat hitless streak, Bonds hit 2 home runs, numbers 752 and 753, against the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>. He went 3–3 with 2 home runs, 6 RBIs, and a walk on that day. The struggling last place Giants still lost the game, 9–8. On July 27, Bonds hit home run 754 against <a href="Florida%20Marlins">Florida Marlins</a> pitcher <a href="Rick%20VandenHurk">Rick VandenHurk</a>. Bonds was then walked his next 4 at-bats in the game, but a 2-run shot helped the Giants win the game 12–10. It marked the first time since he had hit #747 that Bonds had homered in a game the Giants won. On August 4, Bonds hit a 382 foot (116 m) home run against <a href="Clay%20Hensley">Clay Hensley</a> of the <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres">San Diego Padres</a> for home run number 755, tying Hank Aaron's all-time record. Bonds greeted his son, Nikolai, with an extended bear hug after crossing home plate. Bonds greeted his teammates and then his wife, Liz Watson, and daughter Aisha Lynn behind the backstop. Hensley was the 445th different pitcher to give up a home run to Bonds. Ironically, given the cloud of suspicion that surrounded Bonds, the tying home run was hit off a pitcher who had been suspended by baseball in 2005 for steroid use. He was walked in his next at bat and eventually scored on a fielder's choice.

On August 7 at 8:51 PM <a href="Pacific%20time%20zone">PDT</a>, at the Giants home AT&T Park in San Francisco, Bonds hit a 435 foot (133 m) home run, his 756th, off a pitch from <a href="Mike%20Bacsik%20%28left-handed%20pitcher%29">Mike Bacsik</a> of the <a href="Washington%20Nationals">Washington Nationals</a>, breaking the all-time career home run record, formerly held by <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Hank Aaron</a>. Coincidentally, Bacsik's father had faced Aaron (as a pitcher for the <a href="Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29">Texas Rangers</a>) after Aaron had hit his 755th home run. On August 23, 1976, Michael J. Bacsik held Aaron to a single and a fly out to right field. The younger Bacsik commented later, "If my dad had been gracious enough to let Hank Aaron hit a home run, we both would have given up 756." After hitting the home run, Bonds gave Bacsik an autographed bat.

The pitch, the seventh of the at-bat, was a 3–2 pitch which Bonds hit into the right-center field bleachers. The fan who ended up with the ball, 22-year-old Matt Murphy from <a href="Queens">Queens</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> (and a <a href="New%20York%20Mets">Mets fan</a>), was promptly protected and escorted away from the mayhem by a group of San Francisco police officers. After Bonds finished his home run trot, a ten-minute delay followed, including a brief video by Aaron congratulating Bonds on breaking the record Aaron had held for 33 years, and expressing the hope that "the achievement of this record will inspire others to chase their own dreams." Bonds made an impromptu emotional statement on the field, with Willie Mays, his godfather, at his side and thanked his teammates, family and his late father. Bonds sat out the rest of the game.
The commissioner, <a href="Bud%20Selig">Bud Selig</a>, was not in attendance in this game but was represented by the Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations, <a href="Jimmie%20Lee%20Solomon">Jimmie Lee Solomon</a>. Selig called Bonds later that night to congratulate him on breaking the record. President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> also called Bonds the next day to congratulate him. On August 24, San Francisco honored and celebrated Bonds's career accomplishments and breaking the home run record with a large rally in <a href="Justin%20Herman%20Plaza">Justin Herman Plaza</a>. The rally included video messages from <a href="Lou%20Brock">Lou Brock</a>, <a href="Ernie%20Banks">Ernie Banks</a>, <a href="Ozzie%20Smith">Ozzie Smith</a>, <a href="Joe%20Montana">Joe Montana</a>, <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> and <a href="Michael%20Jordan">Michael Jordan</a>. Speeches were made by Willie Mays, Giants teammates <a href="Omar%20Vizquel">Omar Vizquel</a> and <a href="Rich%20Aurilia">Rich Aurilia</a>, and Giants owner <a href="Peter%20Magowan">Peter Magowan</a>. Mayor <a href="Gavin%20Newsom">Gavin Newsom</a> presented Bonds the key to the <a href="San%20Francisco">City and County of San Francisco</a> and Giants vice president Larry Baer gave Bonds the home plate he touched after hitting his 756th career home run.

The record-setting ball was consigned to an auction house on August 21. Bidding began on August 28 and closed with a winning bid of US$752,467 on September 15 after a three phase <a href="online%20auction">online auction</a>. The high bidder, <a href="fashion%20designer">fashion designer</a> <a href="Marc%20Ecko">Marc Ecko</a>, created a website to let fans decide its fate. Subsequently, Ben Padnos, who submitted the (US) $186,750 winning bid on Bonds's record-tying 755th home run ball also set up a website to let fans decide its fate. Of Ecko's plans, Bonds said "He spent $750,000 on the ball and that's what he's doing with it? What he's doing is stupid." 10 million voters helped Ecko decide to brand the ball with an asterisk and send it to the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum</a>. Padnos sold 5-year ads on a website, www.endthedebate.com, where people voted by a two-to-one margin to smash the ball.

Bonds concluded the 2007 season with a .276 batting average, 28 home runs, and 66 RBIs in 126 games and 340 at bats. At the age of 43, he led both leagues in walks with 132.

On September 21, 2007, the San Francisco Giants confirmed that they would not re-sign Bonds for the 2008 season. The story was first announced on Bonds's own web site earlier that day. Bonds officially filed for <a href="free%20agent">free agency</a> on October 29, 2007. His agent <a href="Jeff%20Borris">Jeff Borris</a> said: "I'm anticipating widespread interest from every Major League team."

There was much speculation before the 2008 season about where Bonds might play. However, no one signed him during the 2008 or 2009 seasons. If he had returned to Major League Baseball, Bonds would have been within close range of several significant hitting milestones: needing just 65 hits to reach 3,000, 4 runs batted in to reach 2,000, and 38 home runs to reach 800. He would have needed 69 more <a href="runs%20scored">runs scored</a> to move past <a href="Rickey%20Henderson">Rickey Henderson</a> as the all-time runs champion, and 37 <a href="extra%20base%20hit">extra base hit</a>s to move past <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Hank Aaron</a> as the all-time extra base hits champion.

As of November 13, 2009, Borris maintained that Bonds was still not retired. On December 9, however, Borris told the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" that Bonds had played his last major league game. Bonds announced on April 11, 2010, that he was proud of McGwire for admitting his use of steroids. Bonds said that it was not the time to retire, but he noted that he was not in shape to play immediately if an interested club called him. In May 2015, Bonds filed a grievance against Major League Baseball through the players' union arguing that the league colluded in not signing him after the 2007 season. In August 2015, an arbitrator ruled in favor of MLB and against Bonds in his collusion case.

Bonds has not had a jersey number retired by either the Pirates or Giants, although there have been calls by fans of both teams to retire their respective <a href="Uniform%20number%20%28Major%20League%20Baseball%29">uniform numbers</a> held by Bonds. His number 24 with the Pirates remains in circulation, most prominently worn by <a href="Brian%20Giles">Brian Giles</a> from 1999 to 2003 and by <a href="Pedro%20Alvarez%20%28baseball%29">Pedro Alvarez</a> from 2011 to 2015. The Giants have not reissued Bonds's number 25.

On December 15, 2011, Bonds was sentenced to 30 days of house arrest, two years of probation and 250 hours of community service, for an obstruction of justice conviction stemming from a grand jury appearance in 2003. However, U.S. District Judge <a href="Susan%20Illston">Susan Illston</a> then delayed the sentence pending an appeal. In 2013 his conviction was upheld on appeal by a three judge panel of the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Ninth%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a>. However, the full court later granted Bonds an <a href="en%20banc">en banc</a> rehearing, and on April 22, 2015, an 11-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit voted 10-1 to overturn his conviction.

On March 10, 2014, Bonds began a seven-day stint as a roving <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> instructor for the <a href="2014%20San%20Francisco%20Giants%20season">Giants</a>. On December 4, 2015, he was announced as the new hitting coach for the <a href="2016%20Miami%20Marlins%20season">Miami Marlins</a>, but was <a href="Dismissal%20%28employment%29">relieved of his duties</a> on October 3, 2016, after just one season. He followed up with a public thank-you letter, acknowledging <a href="List%20of%20Miami%20Marlins%20owners%20and%20executives">owner</a> <a href="Jeffrey%20Loria">Jeffrey Loria</a>, and the opportunity as "one of the most rewarding experiences of my baseball career." In 2017, Bonds officially rejoined the Giants organization as a special advisor to the CEO. On July 8, 2017, Bonds was added to the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Giants%23San%20Francisco%20Giants%20Wall%20of%20Famers">Giants Wall of Fame</a>.

In his first five years of eligibility for induction to the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Baseball Hall of Fame</a>, Bonds received 36.2%, 34.7%, 36.8%, 44.3%, and 53.8% of the vote, all short of the 75% needed for induction.

During his playing career, Bonds was frequently described as a difficult person, surly, standoffish and ungrateful, among other unflattering adjectives. However, in one interview with <a href="Terence%20Moore">Terence Moore</a> in 2016, he acknowledged regret over the persona which he had created. He attributed it to a response to the pressure he felt to perform as a young player with the Pirates. Remarked Bonds,

For a short time during his playing days with the Giants, Bonds temporarily changed his demeanor at the behest of a group of teammates, resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant demeanor. Shortly thereafter, in the midst of a slump, the same group of teammates pleaded that he revert, having seemingly lost his competitive edge, and causing the team lose more. In spite of his protest that they would not appreciate the results, his teammates insisted, and Bonds complied, maintaining that familiar standoffish edge the rest of his playing career.

Following his retirement from playing, Bonds became much more gregarious and engaging with the public, quick to flash what started to become a more-and-more familiar smile.

Since 2003, Bonds has been a key figure in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (<a href="Bay%20Area%20Laboratory%20Co-operative">BALCO</a>) scandal. BALCO marketed <a href="tetrahydrogestrinone">tetrahydrogestrinone</a> ("the Clear"), a performance-enhancing <a href="anabolic%20steroid">steroid</a> that was undetectable by doping tests. He was under investigation by a federal <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> regarding his testimony in the BALCO case, and was indicted on <a href="perjury">perjury</a> and <a href="obstruction%20of%20justice">obstruction of justice</a> charges on November 15, 2007. The indictment alleges that Bonds lied while under oath about his alleged use of <a href="steroids">steroids</a>.

In 2003, Bonds first became embroiled in a scandal when <a href="Greg%20Anderson%20%28trainer%29">Greg Anderson</a> of the <a href="BALCO">Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative</a> (BALCO), Bonds's trainer since 2000, was indicted by a federal <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20California">United States District Court for the Northern District of California</a> and charged with supplying <a href="anabolic%20steroids">anabolic steroids</a> to athletes, including a number of baseball players. This led to speculation that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs during a time when there was no mandatory testing in Major League Baseball. Bonds declared his innocence, attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of bodybuilding, diet, and legitimate supplements.

During grand jury testimony on December 4, 2003, Bonds said that he used a clear substance and a cream that he received from his personal strength trainer, Greg Anderson, who told him they were the nutritional supplement flaxseed oil and a rubbing balm for arthritis. This testimony, as reported by <a href="Lance%20Williams%20and%20Mark%20Fainaru-Wada">Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada</a>, has frequently been misrepresented. Later reports on Bonds's leaked grand-jury testimony contend that he admitted to unknowingly using "<a href="the%20cream">the cream</a>" and "<a href="Tetrahydrogestrinone">the clear</a>".

In July 2005, all four defendants in the BALCO steroid scandal trial, including Anderson, struck deals with federal prosecutors that did not require them to reveal names of athletes who may have used banned drugs.

On November 15, 2007, Bonds was indicted on four counts of <a href="perjury">perjury</a> and one count of <a href="obstruction%20of%20justice">obstruction of justice</a> as it relates to the government investigation of BALCO.

On February 14, 2008 a <a href="typo">typo</a> in court papers filed by Federal prosecutors erroneously alleged that Bonds tested positive for steroids in November 2001, a month after hitting his record 73rd home run. The reference was meant instead to refer to a November 2000 test that had already been disclosed and previously reported. The typo sparked a brief media frenzy.

His trial for obstruction of justice was to have begun on March 2, 2009, but jury selection was postponed by 11th-hour appeals by the prosecution. The trial commenced on March 21, 2011, in U. S. District Court, Northern District of California, with Judge Susan Illston presiding. He was convicted on April 13, 2011 on the obstruction of justice charge, for giving an evasive answer to a question under oath. His sentence did not include prison. The conviction was initially upheld by a three judge panel of the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Ninth%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit</a> in 2013, but a larger panel of the court voted 10-1 to overturn the conviction on April 22, 2015.

Bonds withdrew from the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Players%20Association">MLB Players Association</a>'s (MLBPA) <a href="license">licensing</a> agreement because he felt independent marketing deals would be more lucrative for him. Bonds is the first player in the thirty-year history of the licensing program not to sign. Because of this withdrawal, his name and likeness are not usable in any merchandise licensed by the MLBPA. In order to use his name or likeness, a company must deal directly with Bonds. For this reason he does not appear in some baseball <a href="video%20games">video games</a>, forcing game-makers to create generic athletes to replace him. For example, Bonds is replaced by "<a href="Jon%20Dowd">Jon Dowd</a>" in "<a href="MVP%20Baseball%202005">MVP Baseball 2005</a>." 

In March 2006 the book "<a href="Game%20of%20Shadows">Game of Shadows</a>", written by <a href="Lance%20Williams%20and%20Mark%20Fainaru-Wada">Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada</a>, was released amid a storm of media publicity including the cover of "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>". Initially small excerpts of the book were released by the authors in the issue of "Sports Illustrated". The book alleges Bonds used <a href="stanozolol">stanozolol</a> and a host of other steroids, and is perhaps most responsible for the change in public opinion regarding Bonds's steroid use.

The book contained excerpts of grand jury testimony that is supposed to be sealed and confidential by law. The authors have been steadfast in their refusal to divulge their sources and at one point faced jail time. On February 14, 2007, Troy Ellerman, one of <a href="Victor%20Conte">Victor Conte</a>'s lawyers, pleaded guilty to leaking grand jury testimony. Through the plea agreement, he will spend two and a half years in jail.

In May 2006, former "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" writer <a href="Jeff%20Pearlman">Jeff Pearlman</a> released a revealing biography of Bonds entitled "Love Me, Hate Me: Barry Bonds and the Making of an Anti-Hero." The book also contained many allegations against Bonds. The book, which describes Bonds as a polarizing insufferable braggart with a legendary ego and staggering ability, relied on over five hundred interviews, except with Bonds himself.

In April 2006 and May 2006, <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> aired a few episodes of a 10-part <a href="reality%20TV">reality TV</a> (unscripted, <a href="documentary%20film">documentary</a>-style) series starring Bonds. The show, titled "<a href="Shows%20on%20ESPN%23Original%20Series">Bonds on Bonds</a>", focused on Bonds's chase of <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>'s and <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Hank Aaron</a>'s <a href="home%20run">home run</a> records. Some felt the show should be put on hiatus until baseball investigated Bonds's steroid use allegations. The series was canceled in June 2006, ESPN and producer Tollin/Robbins Productions citing "creative control" issues with Bonds and his representatives.

Bonds met Susann ("Sun") Margreth Branco, the mother of his first two children (Nikolai and Shikari), in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> in August 1987. They eloped to <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Valley">Las Vegas</a> February 5, 1988. The couple separated in June 1994, divorced in December 1994, and had their marriage <a href="annulment">annulled</a> in 1997 by the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a>. The divorce was a media affair because Bonds had his Swedish spouse sign a <a href="prenuptial%20agreement">prenuptial agreement</a> in which she "waived her right to a share of his present and future earnings" and which was upheld. Bonds had been providing his wife $20,000/month in child support and $10,000 in spousal support at the time of the ruling. During the hearings to set permanent support levels, allegations of abuse came from both parties. The trial dragged on for months, but Bonds was awarded both houses and reduced support. On August 21, 2000, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20California">Supreme Court of California</a>, in an opinion signed by Chief Justice <a href="Ronald%20M.%20George">Ronald M. George</a>, unanimously held that "substantial evidence supports the determination of the trial court that the [prenuptial] agreement in the present case was entered into voluntarily." In reaction to the decision, significant changes in California law relating to the validity and enforceability of premarital agreements soon followed.

In 2010, Bonds's son Nikolai, who served as a Giants <a href="batboy">batboy</a> during his father's years playing in San Francisco and always sat next to his dad in the dugout during games, was charged with five <a href="misdemeanor">misdemeanor</a>s resulting from a confrontation with his mother, Sun. Barry accompanied him to San Mateo County Superior Court.

After the end of his first marriage, Bonds had an extensive intimate relationship with Kimberly Bell from 1994 through May 2003. Bonds purchased a home in <a href="Scottsdale%2C%20Arizona">Scottsdale, Arizona</a> for Kimberly.

On January 10, 1998, Bonds married his second wife, Liz Watson, at the San Francisco <a href="Ritz-Carlton">Ritz-Carlton</a> Hotel in front of 240 guests. The couple lived in <a href="Los%20Altos%20Hills%2C%20California">Los Altos Hills, California</a>, with their daughter Aisha during their ten-and-a-half years of marriage before Watson filed for legal separation on June 9, 2009, citing <a href="irreconcilable%20differences">irreconcilable differences</a>. On July 21, 2009, just six weeks later, Watson announced that she was withdrawing her Legal Separation action. The couple were reconciled for seven months before Watson formally filed for divorce in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> on February 26, 2010. On June 6, 2011, Bonds and Watson filed a legal agreement not to take the divorce to trial and instead settle it in an "uncontested manner", effectively agreeing to take the proceedings out of the public eye and end the marriage privately at an unspecified later date without further court involvement.

Several of Bonds's family and extended family members have been involved in athletics as either a career or a notable pastime. Bonds has a younger brother, <a href="Bobby%20Bonds%2C%20Jr.">Bobby, Jr.</a>, who was also a professional baseball player. His paternal aunt, <a href="Rosie%20Bonds">Rosie Bonds</a>, is a former American record holder in the 80 meter <a href="hurdles">hurdles</a>, and competed in the 1964 Olympics. In addition, he is a distant cousin of Hall of Famer <a href="Reggie%20Jackson">Reggie Jackson</a>.

Among Bonds's many real estate properties is a home he owns in the exclusive gated community of <a href="Beverly%20Park">Beverly Park</a> in <a href="Beverly%20Hills">Beverly Hills</a>, California.

An avid <a href="cyclist">cyclist</a>, the activity became one of Bonds's primary means of keeping in shape and great passion since his playing career. Because knee surgeries, back surgeries, and hip surgeries made it much more difficult to run, cycling has allowed him to engage in sufficient cardiovascular activity to help keep in shape. As a result of the cycling, he has lost 25 pounds from his final playing weight of 240 pounds.

Besides holding Major League career records in home runs (762), walks (2,558), and intentional walks (688), at the time of his retirement, Bonds also led all active players in RBI (1,996), <a href="on-base%20percentage">on-base percentage</a> (.444), runs (2,227), games (2,986), extra-base hits (1,440), at-bats per home run (12.92), and <a href="total%20bases">total bases</a> (5,976). He is 2nd in doubles (601), slugging percentage (.607), stolen bases (514), at-bats (9,847), and hits (2,935), and 6th in triples (77), 8th in sacrifice flies (91), and 9th in <a href="strikeout">strikeout</a>s (1,539), through September 26, 2007.

Bonds is the lone member of the 500–500 club, which means he has hit at least 500 home runs (762) and stolen at least 500 bases (514). He is also one of only four baseball players all-time to be in the 40–40 club (1996), which means he hit 40 home runs (42) and stole 40 bases (40) in the same season; the other members are <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Canseco">José Canseco</a>, <a href="Alex%20Rodriguez">Alex Rodriguez</a>, and <a href="Alfonso%20Soriano">Alfonso Soriano</a>.

Book of Numbers

The Book of Numbers (from <a href="Biblical%20Greek">Greek</a> Ἀριθμοί, "Arithmoi"; , Bəmiḏbar, "In the desert [of]") is the fourth book of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, and the fourth of five books of the Jewish <a href="Torah">Torah</a>. The book has a long and complex history, but its final form is probably due to a <a href="Priestly%20source">Priestly</a> redaction (i.e., editing) of a <a href="Yahwist">Yahwist</a>ic source made some time in the early <a href="Yehud%20medinata">Persian period</a> (5th century BCE). The name of the book comes from the two censuses taken of the Israelites.

Numbers begins at <a href="Mount%20Sinai">Mount Sinai</a>, where the <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a> have received their <a href="Covenant%20%28biblical%29">laws and covenant from God</a> and God has taken up residence among them in the <a href="Tabernacle">sanctuary</a>. The task before them is to take possession of the <a href="Promised%20Land">Promised Land</a>. The people are numbered and preparations are made for resuming their march. The Israelites begin the journey, but they "murmur" at the hardships along the way, and about the authority of <a href="Moses">Moses</a> and <a href="Aaron">Aaron</a>. For these acts, God destroys approximately 15,000 of them through various means. They arrive at the borders of <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a> and send spies into the land. Upon hearing the spies' fearful report concerning the conditions in Canaan, the Israelites refuse to take possession of it. God condemns them to death in the wilderness until a new generation can grow up and carry out the task. The book ends with the new generation of Israelites in the <a href="Moab%23Geography">Plain of Moab</a> ready for the crossing of the <a href="Jordan%20River">Jordan River</a>.

Numbers is the culmination of the story of <a href="The%20Exodus">Israel's exodus from oppression in Egypt</a> and their <a href="Conquest%20of%20Canaan">journey to take possession of the land God promised their fathers</a>. As such it draws to a conclusion the themes introduced in <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Genesis</a> and played out in <a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Exodus</a> and <a href="Book%20of%20Leviticus">Leviticus</a>: God has promised the Israelites that they shall become a great (i.e. numerous) nation, that they will have a special relationship with <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a> their god, and that they shall take possession of the land of <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>. Numbers also demonstrates the importance of holiness, faithfulness and trust: despite God's presence and <a href="Kohen">his priests</a>, Israel lacks faith and the possession of the land is left to a new generation.

Most commentators divide Numbers into three sections based on locale (<a href="Mount%20Sinai">Mount Sinai</a>, <a href="Kadesh-Barnea">Kadesh-Barnea</a> and the plains of Moab), linked by two travel sections; an alternative is to see it as structured around the two generations of those condemned to die in the wilderness and the new generation who will enter Canaan, making a theological distinction between the disobedience of the first generation and the obedience of the second.

God orders Moses, in the wilderness of Sinai, to number those able to bear arms—of all the men "from twenty years old and upward," and to appoint princes over each tribe. A total of 603,550 Israelites are found to be fit for military service. The <a href="Levite">tribe of Levi</a> is exempted from military service and therefore not included in the census. Moses consecrates the Levites for the service of the Tabernacle in the place of the first-born sons, who hitherto had performed that service. The Levites are divided into three families, the Gershonites, the Kohathites, and the Merarites, each under a chief. The Kohathites were headed by <a href="Eleazar">Eleazar</a>, son of <a href="Aaron">Aaron</a>, while the Gershonites and Merarites were headed by Aaron's other son, Ithamar. Preparations are then made for resuming the march to the <a href="Promised%20Land">Promised Land</a>. Various ordinances and laws are decreed.

The Israelites set out from Sinai. The people murmur against God and are punished by fire; Moses complains of their stubbornness and is ordered to choose seventy elders to assist him in the government of the people. Miriam and Aaron insult Moses at Hazeroth, which angers God; Miriam is punished with <a href="leprosy">leprosy</a> and is shut out of camp for seven days, at the end of which the Israelites proceed to the <a href="desert%20of%20Paran">desert of Paran</a> on the border of Canaan. <a href="The%20Twelve%20Spies">Twelve spies</a> are sent out into Canaan and come back to report to Moses. <a href="Joshua">Joshua</a> and <a href="Caleb">Caleb</a>, two of the spies, report that the land is abundant and is "flowing with milk and honey", but the other spies say that it is inhabited by giants, and the Israelites refuse to enter the land. Yahweh decrees that the Israelites will be punished for their loss of <a href="faith">faith</a> by having to wander in the wilderness for 40 years.

Moses is ordered by God to make plates to cover the altar. The children of Israel murmur against Moses and Aaron on account of the destruction of Korah's men and are stricken with the plague, with 14,700 perishing. Aaron and his family are declared by God to be responsible for any iniquity committed in connection with the sanctuary. The Levites are again appointed to help in the keeping of the Tabernacle. The Levites are ordered to surrender to the priests a part of the tithes taken to them.

Miriam dies at Kadesh Barnea and the Israelites set out for Moab, on Canaan's eastern border. The Israelites blame Moses for the lack of water. Moses is ordered by God to speak to a rock but initially disobeys, and is punished by the announcement that he shall not enter Canaan. The king of Edom refuses permission to pass through his land and they go around it. Aaron dies on Mount Hor. The Israelites are bitten by <a href="Fiery%20flying%20serpent">Fiery flying serpent</a>s for speaking against God and Moses. A <a href="Nehushtan">brazen serpent</a> is made to ward off these serpents.

The Israelites arrive on the plains of Moab. A new census gives the total number of males from twenty years and upward as 601,730, and the number of the Levites from the age of one month and upward as 23,000. The land shall be divided by lot. The daughters of <a href="Zelophehad">Zelophehad</a>, their father having no sons, are to share in the allotment. Moses is ordered to appoint <a href="Joshua">Joshua</a> as his successor. Prescriptions for the observance of the feasts and the offerings for different occasions are enumerated. Moses orders the Israelites to massacre the people of <a href="Midian">Midian</a>. The Reubenites and the Gadites request Moses to assign them the land east of the Jordan. Moses grants their request after they promise to help in the conquest of the land west of the Jordan. The land <a href="Transjordan%20%28Bible%29">east of the Jordan</a> is divided among the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. Moses recalls the stations at which the Israelites halted during their forty years' wanderings and instructs the Israelites to exterminate the Canaanites and destroy their idols. The boundaries of the land are spelled out; the land is to be divided under the supervision of <a href="Eleazar">Eleazar</a>, Joshua, and twelve princes, one of each tribe.

The majority of modern biblical scholars believe that the <a href="Torah">Torah</a> (the books of <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Genesis</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Exodus">Exodus</a>, <a href="Leviticus">Leviticus</a>, Numbers, and <a href="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a>) reached its present form in the <a href="Second%20Temple%20Judaism">post-Exilic period</a> (i.e., after c.520 BCE), based on pre-existing written and oral traditions and "contemporary geographical and demographic details but even more importantly from contemporary political realities". The five books are often described as being drawn from four "sources" - schools of writers rather than individuals - the <a href="Yahwist">Yahwist</a> and the <a href="Elohist">Elohist</a> (frequently treated as a single source), the <a href="Priestly%20source">Priestly source</a> and the <a href="Deuteronomist">Deuteronomist</a>. There is ongoing dispute over the origins of the non-Priestly source(s), but it is generally agreed that the Priestly source is post-exilic. 

David A. Clines, in his influential "The Themes of the Pentateuch" (1978), identified the overarching <a href="Theme%20%28literature%29">theme</a> of the five books as the partial fulfilment of a promise made by God to the patriarchs, <a href="Abraham">Abraham</a>, <a href="Isaac">Isaac</a> and <a href="Jacob">Jacob</a>. The promise has three elements: posterity (i.e., descendants – Abraham is told that his descendants will be as innumerable as the stars), divine-human relationship (Israel is to be God's chosen people), and land (the land of Canaan, cursed by Noah immediately after the Deluge).

The theme of the divine-human relationship is expressed, or managed, through a series of <a href="Covenant%20%28biblical%29">covenant</a>s (meaning treaties, legally binding agreements) stretching from Genesis to Deuteronomy and beyond. The first is the covenant between God and Noah immediately after the Deluge in which God agrees never again to destroy the Earth with water. The next is between God and Abraham, and the third between God and all Israel at Mount Sinai. In this third covenant, unlike the first two, God hands down an elaborate set of laws (scattered through Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers), which the Israelites are to observe; they are also to remain faithful to Yahweh, the god of Israel, meaning, among other things, that they must put their trust in his help.

The theme of descendants marks the first event in Numbers, the census of Israel's fighting men: the huge number which results (over 600,000) demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham of innumerable descendants, as well as serving as God's guarantee of victory in Canaan. As chapters 1–10 progress, the theme of God's presence with Israel comes to the fore: these chapters describe how Israel is to be organised around the Sanctuary, God's dwelling-place in their midst, under the charge of the Levites and priests, in preparation for the conquest of the land.

The Israelites then set out to conquer the land, but almost immediately they refuse to enter it, and Yahweh condemns the whole generation who left Egypt to die in the wilderness. The message is clear: failure was not due to any fault in the preparation, because Yahweh had foreseen everything, but to Israel's sin of unfaithfulness. In the final section, the Israelites of the new generation follow Yahweh's instructions as given through Moses and are successful in all they attempt. The last five chapters are exclusively concerned with land: instructions for the extermination of the Canaanites, the demarcation of the boundaries of the land, how the land is to be divided, holy cities for the Levites and "cities of refuge", the problem of pollution of the land by blood, and regulations for inheritance when a male heir is lacking.

Book of Judges

The Book of Judges (<a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>: "Sefer Shoftim" ספר שופטים) is the seventh book of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> and the Christian <a href="Bible">Bible</a>. It contains the history of the <a href="Biblical%20judges">Biblical judges</a>, the divinely inspired leaders whose direct knowledge of <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a> allows them to act as champions for the <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a> against oppression by foreign rulers, and models of the wise and faithful behaviour required of them by their God Yahweh following the <a href="The%20Exodus">exodus from Egypt</a> and the <a href="conquest%20of%20Canaan">conquest of Canaan</a>. The stories follow a consistent pattern: the people are unfaithful to Yahweh and he therefore delivers them into the hands of their enemies; the people repent and entreat Yahweh for mercy, which he sends in the form of a leader or champion (a "judge"); the judge delivers the Israelites from oppression and they prosper, but soon they fall again into unfaithfulness and the cycle is repeated. Scholars consider many of the stories in "Judges" to be the oldest in the <a href="Deuteronomistic%20history">Deuteronomistic history</a>, with their major redaction dated to the 8th century BCE and with materials such as the <a href="Deborah%23The%20Song%20of%20Deborah">Song of Deborah</a> dating from much earlier, perhaps close to the period the book depicts.

"Judges" can be divided into three major sections: a double prologue (chapters 1:1–3:6), a main body (3:7–16:31), and a double epilogue (17–21).

The book opens with the Israelites in the land which God has promised to them but worshiping "foreign gods" instead of <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a>, the God of Israel, and with the <a href="Canaanites">Canaanites</a> still present everywhere. Chapters 1:1–2:5 are thus a confession of failure while chapters 2:6–3:6 are a major summary and reflection from the Deuteronomists.

The opening thus sets out the pattern which the stories in the main text will follow:

Once peace was regained, for a time Israel does right and receives Yahweh's blessings, only to relapse later into doing evil and repeating the pattern set forth above.

"Judges" follows on from the <a href="Book%20of%20Joshua">Book of Joshua</a> and opens with reference to <a href="Joshua">Joshua</a>'s death (; cf. ). The <a href="Cambridge%20Bible%20for%20Schools%20and%20Colleges">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a> suggests that "the death of Joshua may be regarded as marking the division between the period of conquest and the period of occupation", the latter being the focus of the Book of Judges. The Israelites meet, most likely at the sanctuary at <a href="Gilgal">Gilgal</a> or at <a href="Shechem">Shechem</a> (following on from ) and ask the Lord who should be first (in order of time, not of rank) to secure the land they are to occupy.

Next comes the main text (), six accounts each concerning a major judge and their struggles against the oppressive kings of surrounding nations, plus the story of Abimelech, an Israelite who oppresses his own people. The cyclic pattern set out in the prologue is readily apparent at the beginning, but as the stories progress it begins to disintegrate, mirroring the disintegration of the world of the Israelites. The stories are not presented in chronological order, but the judges <a href="Fabula%20and%20syuzhet">as they appear in the text</a> are:

There are also brief glosses on six minor judges: <a href="Shamgar">Shamgar</a> (3:31), <a href="Tola%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Tola</a> and <a href="Jair">Jair</a> (10:1–5), <a href="Ibzan">Ibzan</a>, <a href="Elon">Elon</a>, and <a href="Abdon%20%28Judges%29">Abdon</a> (12:8–15). Some scholars have inferred that the minor judges were actual adjudicators, whereas the major judges were leaders and didn't actually make legal judgements. The only time a major judge is said to have made legal judgments was Deborah (4:4).

By the end of Judges, the Israelites are in a worse condition than they were at the beginning, with Yahweh's treasures used to make idolatrous images, the Levites (priests) corrupted, the <a href="tribe%20of%20Dan">tribe of Dan</a> conquering a remote village instead of the Canaanite cities, and the <a href="tribes%20of%20Israel">tribes of Israel</a> making war on the <a href="tribe%20of%20Benjamin">tribe of Benjamin</a>, their own brothers. The book concludes with two appendices (), stories which do not feature a specific judge:
Despite their appearance at the end of the book, certain characters (like <a href="Jonathan%20%28Judges%29">Jonathan</a>, the grandson of <a href="Moses">Moses</a>) and idioms present in the epilogue show that the events therein "must have taken place ... early in the period of the judges."

Judges contains a chronology of its events. It is overtly schematic and, according to biblical scholar Jeremy Hughes, shows signs of having been introduced at a later period.

The basic source for Judges was a collection of loosely connected stories about tribal heroes who saved the people in battle. This original "book of saviours" made up of the stories of <a href="Ehud">Ehud</a>, <a href="Jael">Jael</a> and parts of <a href="Gideon">Gideon</a>, had already been enlarged and transformed into "wars of Yahweh" before being given the final Deuteronomistic revision. In the 20th century the first part of the prologue (chapters 1:1–2:5) and the two parts of the epilogue (17–21) were commonly seen as miscellaneous collections of fragments tacked onto the main text, and the second part of the prologue (2:6–3:6) as an introduction composed expressly for the book. More recently, this view has been challenged, and there is an increasing willingness to see Judges as the work of a single individual, working by carefully selecting, reworking and positioning his source material to introduce and conclude his themes.

A statement repeated throughout the book, "In those days there was no king in Israel" (, , , and ) implies a date in the monarchy for the redaction editing) of Judges. Twice this statement is accompanied with the statement that "every man did that which was right in his own eyes", implying that the redactor is pro-monarchy, ( and ) and the epilogue, in which the <a href="tribe%20of%20Judah">tribe of Judah</a> is assigned a leadership role, implies that this redaction took place in Judah.

Since the second half of the 20th century most scholars have agreed with <a href="Martin%20Noth">Martin Noth</a>'s thesis that the books of <a href="Book%20of%20Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Joshua">Joshua</a>, Judges, <a href="Books%20of%20Samuel">Samuel</a> and <a href="Books%20of%20Kings">Kings</a> form parts of a single work. Noth maintained that the history was written in the early <a href="Babylonian%20captivity">Exilic period</a> (6th century BCE) in order to demonstrate how Israel's history was worked out in accordance with the theology expressed in the book of Deuteronomy (which thus provides the name "Deuteronomistic"). Noth believed that this history was the work of a single author, living in the mid-6th century BCE, selecting, editing and composing from his sources to produce a coherent work. Frank Moore Cross later proposed that an early version of the history was composed in Jerusalem in <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a>'s time (late 7th century BCE); this first version, Dtr1, was then revised and expanded to create a second edition, that identified by Noth, and which Cross labelled Dtr2.

Scholars agree that the Deuteronomists' hand can be seen in "Judges" through the book's cyclical nature: the Israelites fall into idolatry, God punishes them for their sins with oppression by foreign peoples, the Israelites cry out to God for help, and God sends a judge to deliver them from the foreign oppression. After a period of peace, the cycle recurs. Scholars also suggest that the Deuteronomists also included the humorous and sometimes disparaging commentary found in the book such as the story of the <a href="tribe%20of%20Ephraim">tribe of Ephraim</a> who could not pronounce the word ""<a href="shibboleth">shibboleth</a>"" correctly (12:5–6).

The essence of Deuteronomistic theology is that Israel has entered into a <a href="covenant%20%28biblical%29">covenant</a> (a treaty, a binding agreement) with the God Yahweh, under which they agree to accept Yahweh as their god (hence the phrase "God of Israel") and Yahweh promises them a land where they can live in peace and prosperity. Deuteronomy contains the laws by which Israel is to live in the promised land, Joshua chronicles the conquest of <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>, the promised land, and its allotment among the tribes, Judges describes the settlement of the land, Samuel the consolidation of the land and people under <a href="David">David</a>, and Kings the destruction of kingship and loss of the land. The final tragedy described in Kings is the result of Israel's failure to uphold its part of the covenant: faithfulness to Yahweh brings success, economic, military and political, but unfaithfulness brings defeat and oppression.

This is the theme played out in Judges: the people are unfaithful to Yahweh and he therefore delivers them into the hands of their enemies; the people then repent and entreat Yahweh for mercy, which he sends in the form of a judge; the judge delivers the Israelites from oppression, but after a while they fall into unfaithfulness again and the cycle is repeated.

Further themes are also present: the "sovereign freedom of Yahweh" (God does not always do what is expected of him); the "<a href="satire">satirisation</a> of foreign kings" (who consistently underestimate Israel and Yahweh); the concept of the "flawed agent" (judges who are not adequate to the task before them) and the disunity of the Israelite community (which gathers pace as the stories succeed one another).

The book is as intriguing for the themes it leaves out as for what it includes: the <a href="Ark%20of%20the%20Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a>, which is given so much importance in the stories of <a href="Moses">Moses</a> and <a href="Joshua">Joshua</a>, is almost entirely missing, cooperation between the various tribes is limited, and there is no mention of a central shrine for worship and only limited reference to a <a href="High%20Priest%20of%20Israel">High Priest of Israel</a> (the office to which <a href="Aaron">Aaron</a> was appointed at the end of <a href="the%20Exodus">the Exodus</a> story).

Although "Judges" probably had a monarchist redaction (see above), the book contains passages and themes that represent anti-monarchist views. One of the major themes of the book is Yahweh's sovereignty and the importance of being loyal to Him and His laws above all other gods and sovereigns. Indeed, the authority of the judges comes not through prominent dynasties nor through elections or appointments, but rather through the spirit of God. Anti-monarchist theology is most apparent toward the end of the Gideon cycle in which the Israelites beg Gideon to create a dynastic monarchy over them and Gideon refuses. The rest of Gideon's lifetime saw peace in the land, but after Gideon's death, his son Abimelech ruled <a href="Shechem">Shechem</a> as a <a href="Machiavellianism">Machiavellian</a> tyrant guilty for much bloodshed (see chapters 8 and 9). However, the last few chapters of "Judges" (specifically, the stories of Samson, Micah, and Gibeah) highlight the violence and <a href="anarchy">anarchy</a> of decentralized rule.

"Judges" is remarkable for the number of female characters who "play significant roles, active and passive, in the narratives." Rabbi <a href="Joseph%20Telushkin">Joseph Telushkin</a> wrote,

Books of Samuel

The Books of Samuel, "1 Samuel" and "2 Samuel", form part of the narrative history of <a href="Ancient%20Israel">Israel</a> in the <a href="Nevi%27im">Nevi'im</a> or "prophets" section of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>/<a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>, and are considered by many biblical scholars to belong to the <a href="Deuteronomistic%20history">Deuteronomistic history</a>, a series of books (<a href="Book%20of%20Joshua">Joshua</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Judges">Judges</a>, Samuel and <a href="Books%20of%20Kings">Kings</a>) which constitute a theological history of the <a href="Israelites">Israelites</a> and aim to explain <a href="Torah">God's law for Israel</a> under the guidance of the prophets. According to Jewish tradition, the book was written by <a href="Samuel">Samuel</a>, with additions by the prophets <a href="Gad%20%28prophet%29">Gad</a> and <a href="Nathan%20%28prophet%29">Nathan</a>; modern scholarly thinking is that the entire Deuteronomistic history was composed in the period c. 630–540 BC by combining a number of independent texts of various ages.

Samuel begins with the prophet <a href="Samuel">Samuel</a>'s birth and <a href="Yahweh">God</a>'s call to him as a boy. The story of the <a href="Ark%20of%20the%20Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a> that follows tells of Israel's oppression by the <a href="Philistines">Philistines</a>, which brought about Samuel's anointing of <a href="Saul">Saul</a> as Israel's first king. But Saul proved unworthy and God's choice turned to <a href="David">David</a>, who defeated Israel's enemies and brought the Ark to Jerusalem. God then promised David and his successors an everlasting dynasty.

The childless <a href="Hannah%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Hannah</a> vows to <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh of hosts</a> that if she has a son, he will be dedicated to him. <a href="Eli%20%28Bible%29">Eli</a>, the priest of <a href="Shiloh%20%28biblical%20city%29">Shiloh</a> (where the <a href="Ark%20of%20the%20Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a> is located), blesses her, and a child named <a href="Samuel%20%28Bible%29">Samuel</a> is born. Samuel is dedicated to the Lord as a <a href="Nazirite">Nazirite</a> – the only one beside <a href="Samson">Samson</a> to be identified in the Bible. Eli's sons, <a href="Hophni%20and%20Phinehas">Hophni and Phinehas</a>, prove unworthy of the priesthood and are killed in battle during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aphek">Battle of Aphek</a>, but the child Samuel grows up "in the presence of the Lord."

The <a href="Philistines">Philistines</a> <a href="Philistine%20captivity%20of%20the%20Ark">capture the Ark of the Covenant</a> from Shiloh and take it to the temple of their god <a href="Dagon">Dagon</a>, who recognises the supremacy of Yahweh. The Philistines are afflicted with plagues and return the ark to the Israelites, but to the territory of the <a href="tribe%20of%20Benjamin">tribe of Benjamin</a> rather than to Shiloh. The Philistines attack the Israelites gathered at <a href="Mizpah%20in%20Gilead%20%28Judges%29">Mizpah</a> in Benjamin. Samuel appeals to Yahweh, the Philistines are decisively beaten, and the Israelites reclaim their lost territory.

In Samuel's old age, he appoints his sons <a href="Joel%20%28son%20of%20Samuel%29">Joel</a> and <a href="Abijah">Abijah</a> as judges, but they are unworthy, and so the people clamour for a king. God directs Samuel to grant them a king despite his concerns, and gives them <a href="Saul">Saul</a> of the tribe of Benjamin. Saul defeats the enemies of the Israelites, but sins against Yahweh.

Yahweh tells Samuel to anoint <a href="David">David</a> of <a href="Bethlehem">Bethlehem</a> as king, and David enters Saul's court as his <a href="Squire">armour-bearer</a> and <a href="harp">harp</a>ist. Saul's son and heir <a href="Jonathan%20%281%20Samuel%29">Jonathan</a> befriends David and recognises him as rightful king. Saul plots David's death, but David flees into the wilderness, where he becomes a champion of the Hebrews. David joins the Philistines, but continues secretly to champion his own people, until Saul and Jonathan are killed in battle at <a href="Mount%20Gilboa">Mount Gilboa</a>. At this point, David offers a majestic eulogy, where he praises the bravery and magnificence of both his friend Jonathan and King Saul.

The elders of Judah anoint David as king, but in the north Saul's son <a href="Ish-bosheth">Ish-bosheth</a>, or Ishbaal, rules over the northern tribes. After a long war, Ishbaal is murdered by <a href="Rechab">Rechab</a> and <a href="Baanah">Baanah</a>, two of his captains who hope for a reward from David; but David has them killed for killing God's anointed. David is then anointed King of all Israel. David captures Jerusalem and brings the Ark there. David wishes to build a temple, but <a href="Nathan%20%28Prophet%29">Nathan</a> tells him that one of his sons will be the one to build the temple. David defeats the enemies of Israel, slaughtering Philistines, <a href="Moab">Moab</a>ites, <a href="Edom">Edom</a>ites, Syrians and <a href="Arameans">Arameans</a>.

David commits adultery with <a href="Bathsheba">Bathsheba</a> and plots the death of her husband, <a href="Uriah%20the%20Hittite">Uriah the Hittite</a>; for this <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a> sends disasters against his house. Nathan tells David that the sword shall never depart from his house. For the remainder of his reign there are problems. <a href="Amnon">Amnon</a> (one of David's sons) rapes his half-sister <a href="Tamar%20%28daughter%20of%20David%29">Tamar</a> (one of David's daughters). <a href="Absalom">Absalom</a> (another son of David) kills Amnon, rebels against his father, and David flees from Jerusalem. Absalom is killed following the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Wood%20of%20Ephraim">Battle of the Wood of Ephraim</a>, David is restored as king, and he returns to his palace. Finally only two contenders for the succession remain, <a href="Adonijah">Adonijah</a> and Bathsheba's son <a href="Solomon">Solomon</a>.

The Second Book of Samuel concludes with four chapters (chapters 21 to 24) which lie outside the chronological narrative of Saul and David. The narrative is resumed with the <a href="first%20Book%20of%20Kings">first Book of Kings</a>, which relates how, as David lies dying, Bathsheba and Nathan ensure Solomon's elevation to the throne.

The four supplementary chapters cover a great famine during David's reign, the execution of seven of Saul's remaining descendants, only <a href="Mephibosheth">Mephibosheth</a> being saved, David's <a href="2%20Samuel%2022">song of thanksgiving</a>, which is almost identical to <a href="Psalm%2018">Psalm 18</a>, his last words, a list of David's "<a href="David%27s%20Mighty%20Warriors">mighty warriors</a>", an offering made by David using water from the well of Bethlehem, David's sinful <a href="Census%23Ancient%20Israel">census</a>, a plague over Israel which David opted for as preferable to either famine or oppression, and the construction of an altar on land he purchased from <a href="Araunah%20the%20Jebusite">Araunah the Jebusite</a>.

What it is now commonly known as 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel are called by <a href="the%20Vulgate">the Vulgate</a>, in imitation of <a href="Septuagint">the Septuagint</a>, 1 Kings and 2 Kings respectively.

Then, what it is now commonly known as 1 Kings and 2 Kings would be 3 Kings and 4 Kings in old Bibles before the year 1516 such as the Vulgate and the Septuagint respectively. It was in 1517 that use of the division we know now today used by Protestant Bibles and adopted by Catholics began. Some Bibles still preserve the old denomination, for example, <a href="Douay%20Rheims%20bible">Douay Rheims bible</a>.

1 and 2 Samuel were originally (and, in some Jewish bibles, still are ) a single book, but <a href="Septuagint">the first Greek translation</a>, produced around the second century BCE, divided it into two; this was adopted by the Latin translations used in the early Christian church of the West, and finally introduced into Jewish bibles around the early 16th century. The modern Hebrew text, called the <a href="Masoretic%20text">Masoretic text</a>, differs considerably from the Greek, and scholars are still working at finding the best solutions to the many problems this presents.

According to passages 14b and 15a of the <a href="Bava%20Basra">Bava Basra</a> tractate of the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a>, the book was written by <a href="Samuel">Samuel</a> up until 1 Samuel 25, which notes the death of Samuel, and the remainder by the prophets <a href="Gad%20%28prophet%29">Gad</a> and <a href="Nathan%20%28prophet%29">Nathan</a>. Critical scholars from the 19th century onward have rejected this idea. <a href="Martin%20Noth">Martin Noth</a> in 1943 theorized that Samuel was composed by a single author as part of a history of Israel: the <a href="Deuteronomistic%20history">Deuteronomistic history</a> (made up of <a href="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Joshua">Joshua</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Judges">Judges</a>, Samuel and <a href="Books%20of%20Kings">Kings</a>). Although Noth's belief that the entire history was composed by a single individual has been largely abandoned, his theory in its broad outline has been adopted by most scholars.

The most common view today is that an early version of the history was composed in the time of king <a href="Hezekiah">Hezekiah</a> (8th century BC); the bulk of the first edition dates from his grandson <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a> at the end of the 7th BC, with further sections added during the <a href="Babylonian%20exile">Babylonian exile</a> (6th century BC) and the work was substantially complete by about 550 BC. Further editing was apparently done even after then: for example, the silver quarter-shekel which Saul's servant offers to Samuel in 1 Samuel 9 almost certainly fixes the date of this story in the Persian or <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a>s.

The 6th century BC authors and editors responsible for the bulk of the history drew on many earlier sources, including (but not limited to) an "ark narrative" (1 Samuel 4:1–7:1 and perhaps part of 2 Samuel 6), a "Saul cycle" (parts of 1 Samuel 9–11 and 13–14), the "history of David's rise" (1 Samuel 16:14-2 Samuel 5:10), and the "succession narrative" (2 Samuel 9–20 and 1 Kings 1–2). The oldest of these, the "ark narrative," may even predate the Davidic era.

The sources used to construct 1 and 2 Samuel are believed to include the following:

The Book of Samuel is a theological evaluation of kingship in general and of dynastic kingship and <a href="David">David</a> in particular. The main themes of the book are introduced in the opening poem (the "<a href="Song%20of%20Hannah">Song of Hannah</a>"): (1), the sovereignty of <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a>, God of Israel; (2), the reversal of human fortunes; and (3), kingship. These themes are played out in the stories of the three main characters, <a href="Samuel">Samuel</a>, <a href="Saul">Saul</a> and <a href="David">David</a>.

Samuel answers the description of the "prophet like Moses" predicted in Deuteronomy 18:15–22: like Moses, he has direct contact with <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a>, acts as a judge, and is a perfect leader who never makes mistakes. Samuel's successful defence of the Israelites against their enemies demonstrates that they have no need for a king (who will, moreover, introduce inequality), yet despite this the people demand a king. But the king they are given is Yahweh's gift, and Samuel explains that kingship can be a blessing rather than a curse if they remain faithful to their God. On the other hand, total destruction of both king and people will result if they turn to wickedness.

Saul is the chosen one, tall, handsome and "goodly", a king appointed by Yahweh, and anointed by Samuel, Yahweh's prophet, and yet he is ultimately rejected. Saul has two faults which make him unfit for the office of king: he carries out a sacrifice in place of Samuel (1 Samuel 13:8–14), and he fails to complete the genocide of the <a href="Amalekites">Amalekites</a> as God has ordered (1 Samuel 15).

One of the main units within Samuel is the "History of David's Rise", the purpose of which is to justify David as the legitimate successor to Saul. The narrative stresses that he gained the throne lawfully, always respecting "the Lord's anointed" (i.e. Saul) and never taking any of his numerous chances to seize the throne by violence. As God's chosen king over Israel, David is also the son of God ("I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me..." – 2 Samuel 7:14). God enters into an eternal covenant (treaty) with David and his line, promising divine protection of the dynasty and of Jerusalem through all time.

2 Samuel 23 contains a prophetic statement described as the "last words of <a href="David">David</a>" (verses 1-7) and details of the 37 "<a href="David%27s%20mighty%20men">mighty men</a>" who were David's chief warriors (verses 8-38). The <a href="Jerusalem%20Bible">Jerusalem Bible</a> states that last words were attributed to David in the style of <a href="Jacob">Jacob</a> (see <a href="Jacob%27s%20Blessing">Jacob's Blessing</a>, Genesis 49) and <a href="Moses">Moses</a> (see <a href="Blessing%20of%20Moses">Blessing of Moses</a>, Deuteronomy 33). Its editors note that "the text has suffered considerably and reconstructions are conjectural".

Book of Revelation

The Book of Revelation, often called the Revelation to John, the Apocalypse of John, The Revelation, or simply Revelation or Apocalypse, is a book of the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> that occupies a central place in <a href="Christian%20eschatology">Christian eschatology</a>. Its title is derived from the <a href="Incipit">first word</a> of the text, written in <a href="Koine%20Greek">Koine Greek</a>: "apokalypsis", meaning "unveiling" or "revelation" (before title pages and titles, books were commonly known by their first words, as is also the case of the Hebrew <a href="Five%20Books%20of%20Moses">Five Books of Moses</a> (<a href="Torah">Torah</a>)). The Book of Revelation is the only apocalyptic document in the New Testament <a href="Biblical%20canon">canon</a> (although there are short apocalyptic passages in various places in <a href="the%20Gospels">the Gospels</a> and the <a href="Epistles">Epistles</a>).

The author names himself in the text as "John", but his precise identity remains a point of academic debate. Second century Christian writers such as <a href="Justin%20Martyr">Justin Martyr</a>, <a href="Irenaeus">Irenaeus</a>, <a href="Melito">Melito</a> the bishop of Sardis, and <a href="Clement%20of%20Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</a> and the author of the <a href="Muratorian%20fragment">Muratorian fragment</a> identify <a href="John%20the%20Apostle">John the Apostle</a> as the "John" of Revelation. Modern scholarship generally takes a different view, and many consider that nothing can be known about the author except that he was a Christian prophet. Some modern scholars characterise Revelation's author as a putative figure whom they call "<a href="John%20of%20Patmos">John of Patmos</a>". The bulk of traditional sources date the book to the reign of the emperor <a href="Domitian">Domitian</a> (AD 81–96), and the evidence tends to confirm this.

The book spans three literary genres: the <a href="letter%20%28message%29">epistolary</a>, the <a href="Apocalyptic%20literature">apocalyptic</a>, and the <a href="prophetic">prophetic</a>. It begins with John, on the island of <a href="Patmos">Patmos</a> in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a>, addressing a letter to the "<a href="seven%20churches%20of%20Asia">Seven Churches of Asia</a>". He then describes a series of prophetic <a href="Vision%20%28spirituality%29">visions</a>, including figures such as the <a href="Whore%20of%20Babylon">Whore of Babylon</a> and <a href="The%20Beast%20%28Revelation%29">the Beast</a>, culminating in the <a href="Second%20Coming">Second Coming</a> of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>.

The obscure and extravagant imagery has led to a wide variety of Christian interpretations: <a href="Historicism%20%28Christianity%29">historicist</a> interpretations see in Revelation a broad view of history; <a href="preterist">preterist</a> interpretations treat Revelation as mostly referring to the events of the <a href="Apostolic%20Age">apostolic era (1st century)</a>, or, at the latest, the fall of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>; <a href="Futurism%20%28Christianity%29">futurists</a> believe that Revelation describes future events; and <a href="Idealism%20%28Christian%20eschatology%29">idealist or symbolic</a> interpretations consider that Revelation does not refer to actual people or events, but is an <a href="allegory">allegory</a> of the spiritual path and the ongoing struggle between good and evil.

The title is taken from the first word of the book in <a href="Koine%20Greek">Koine Greek</a>: ἀποκάλυψις "apokalypsis", which means "unveiling" or "revelation". The author names himself as "John", but it is currently considered unlikely that the author of Revelation was also the author of the <a href="Gospel%20of%20John">Gospel of John</a>. Some of the evidence for this was set out as early as the second half of the 3rd century by <a href="Pope%20Dionysius%20of%20Alexandria">Pope Dionysius of Alexandria</a>, who noted that the gospel and the epistles attributed to John, unlike Revelation, do not name their author, and that the Greek of the gospel is correct and elegant while that of Revelation is neither; some later scholars believe that the two books also have radical differences in theological perspective.

Tradition links him to <a href="John%20the%20Apostle">John the Apostle</a>, but it is unlikely that the apostle could have lived into the most likely time for the book's composition, the reign of Domitian, and the author never states that he knew Jesus. All that is known is that this John was a <a href="Jewish%20Christian">Jewish Christian</a> prophet, probably belonging to a group of such prophets, and was accepted as such by the congregations to whom he addresses his letter. His precise identity remains unknown, and modern scholarship commonly refers to him as <a href="John%20of%20Patmos">John of Patmos</a>. 

Early Church tradition dates the book to end of the emperor <a href="Domitian">Domitian</a> (reigned AD 81–96), and most modern scholars agree, although the author may have written a first version under <a href="Vespasian">Vespasian</a> (AD 69–79) and updated it under <a href="Domitian">Domitian</a>. The beast with seven heads and the number 666 seem to allude directly to the emperor <a href="Nero">Nero</a> (reigned AD 54–68), but this does not require that Revelation was written in the 60s, as there was a widespread belief in later decades that Nero would return.

In her volume in the original <a href="Anchor%20Bible%20Series">Anchor Bible</a>, J. Massyngberde Ford argues that the core of Revelation, chapters 4-11, was written by <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a> and later surrounded with a Christian beginning and ending, although this view is not held by the large majority of scholars. 70 AD is the likely date of writing according to Martha Himmelfarb in the recently published Blackwell series.

Revelation is an <a href="apocalypse">apocalyptic</a> prophecy with an epistolary introduction addressed to seven churches in the Roman province of Asia. "Apocalypse" means the revealing of divine mysteries; John is to write down what is revealed (what he sees in his vision) and send it to the seven churches. The entire book constitutes the letter—the letters to the seven individual churches are introductions to the rest of the book, which is addressed to all seven. While the dominant genre is apocalyptic, the author sees himself as a Christian prophet: Revelation uses the word in various forms twenty-one times, more than any other <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> book.

The predominant view is that Revelation alludes to the Old Testament although it is difficult among scholars to agree on the exact number of allusions or the allusions themselves. Revelation rarely quotes directly from the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>, almost every verse alludes to or echoes older scriptures. Over half of the references stem from <a href="Book%20of%20Daniel">Daniel</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Psalms">Psalms</a>, and <a href="Book%20of%20Isaiah">Isaiah</a>, with Daniel providing the largest number in proportion to length and Ezekiel standing out as the most influential. Because these references appear as allusions rather than as quotes, it is difficult to know whether the author used the Hebrew or the Greek version of the Hebrew scriptures, but he was clearly often influenced by the Greek. He very frequently combines multiple references, and again the allusional style makes it impossible to be certain to what extent he did so consciously.

Conventional understanding until recently was that Revelation was written to comfort beleaguered Christians as they underwent persecution at the hands of a <a href="megalomania">megalomania</a>cal Roman emperor, but much of this has now been jettisoned: <a href="Emperor%20Domitian">Domitian</a> is no longer viewed as a despot imposing an imperial cult, and it is no longer believed that there was any systematic empire-wide persecution of Christians in his time.

The current view is that Revelation was composed in the context of a conflict within the Christian community of Asia Minor over whether to engage with, or withdraw from, the far larger non-Christian community: Revelation chastises those Christians who wanted to reach an accommodation with the Roman cult of empire. This is not to say that Christians in Roman Asia were not suffering, for withdrawal from, and defiance against, the wider Roman society imposed very real penalties; Revelation offered a victory over this reality by offering an apocalyptic hope: in the words of professor Adela Yarbro Collins, "What ought to be was experienced as a present reality."

Revelation was the last book accepted into the <a href="Christian%20biblical%20canons">Christian biblical canon</a>, and to the present day some <a href="Nestorianism">"Nestorian"</a> churches such as the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20East">Church of the East</a> reject it.
It was considered tainted because the heretical sect of the <a href="Montanism">Montanists</a> relied on it and doubts were raised over its Jewishness and authorship.

<a href="Pope%20Dionysius%20of%20Alexandria">Dionysius</a> (248 AD), bishop of Alexandria, disciple of <a href="Origen">Origen</a> wrote that the Book of Revelation could have been written by <a href="Cerinthus">Cerinthus</a> although he himself did not adopt the view that Cerinthus was the writer. He regarded the Apocalypse as the work of an inspired man but not of an Apostle "(Eusebius, Church History VII.25)".

<a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>, in his <a href="Church%20History%20%28Eusebius%29">Church History</a> (c. 330 AD) mentioned that the Apocalypse of John was accepted as a Canonical book and rejected at the same time:

The Apocalypse of John, also called Revelation, is counted as both accepted (Kirsopp. Lake translation: "Recognized") and disputed, which has caused some confusion over what exactly Eusebius meant by doing so. The disputation perhaps attributed to Origen.

<a href="Cyril%20of%20Jerusalem">Cyril of Jerusalem</a> (348 AD) does not name it among the canonical books (Catechesis IV.33–36).

<a href="Athanasius%20of%20Alexandria">Athanasius</a> (367 AD) listed the Book of Revelation as a Canonical book.

The monk <a href="Tyrannius%20Rufinus">Tyrannius Rufinus</a> (c. 400 AD) named as a Canonical book the Revelation of John.

<a href="Pope%20Innocent%20I">Pope Innocent I</a> (405 AD) in a letter to the bishop of Toulouse listed as Canonical book the Book of Revelation.

<a href="John%20of%20Damascus">John of Damascus</a> (about 730) wrote in "An Exposition of the Orthodox Faith (Book IV:7)" that "the Revelation of <a href="John%20the%20Evangelist">John the Evangelist</a>" was a canonical book.

The <a href="Council%20of%20Laodicea">Council of Laodicea</a> (363) omits it as a canonical book.

The <a href="Synod%20of%20Hippo">Synod of Hippo</a> (in 393), followed by the <a href="Council%20of%20Carthage%20%28397%29">Council of Carthage (397)</a> and the <a href="Council%20of%20Carthage%20%28419%29">Council of Carthage (419)</a>, classified it as a canonical book.

<a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a> (c. 397 AD) confirms in his book "<a href="De%20doctrina%20christiana">On Christian Doctrine</a>" (Book II, Chapter 8) its canonicity.

The "<a href="Decretum%20Gelasianum">Decretum Gelasianum</a>", which is a work written by an anonymous scholar between 519 and 553, contains a list of books of scripture presented as having been reckoned as canonical by the <a href="Council%20of%20Rome">Council of Rome</a> under <a href="Pope%20Damasus%20I">Pope Damasus I</a> (366–383). This list mentions it as a part of the New Testament canon.

The <a href="Canons%20of%20the%20Apostles">Apostolic Canons</a>, approved by the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> <a href="Quinisext%20Council">Council in Trullo</a> in 692, omit it.

Doubts resurfaced during the <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a href="Reformation">Reformation</a>. <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> called it "neither apostolic nor prophetic" in the 1522 preface to his translation of the New Testament (he revised his position with <a href="http%3A//beggarsallreformation.blogspot.com/2016/01/luther-on-revelation-i-feel-aversion-to.html">a much more favorable assessment in 1530</a>), and it was the only New Testament book on which <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a> did not write a commentary. it remains the only New Testament work not read in the <a href="Divine%20Liturgy">Divine Liturgy</a> of the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>, though Catholic and Protestant liturgies include it.

There are approximately 300 Greek manuscripts of Revelation. While the <a href="Codex%20Vaticanus">Codex Vaticanus</a> does not include it, the other major manuscripts that do are the <a href="Codex%20Sinaiticus">Codex Sinaiticus</a> (4th century), <a href="Codex%20Alexandrinus">Codex Alexandrinus</a> (5th century), and <a href="Codex%20Ephraemi%20Rescriptus">Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus</a> (5th century). In addition, there are numerous <a href="Papyrus">papyri</a>, especially that of "p" (3rd century); the <a href="Greek%20minuscule">minuscule</a>s (8th to 10th century), plus fragmentary quotations in the Church fathers of the 2nd to 5th centuries and the 6th century Greek commentary on Revelation by Andreas.

Divisions in the book seem to be marked by the repetition of key phrases, by the arrangement of subject matter into blocks, and around its Christological passages, and much use is made of significant numbers, especially the number seven, which represented perfection according to ancient numerology. Nevertheless, there is a "complete lack of consensus" among scholars about the structure of Revelation. The following is therefore an outline of the book's contents rather than of its structure.


Revelation has a wide variety of interpretations, ranging from the simple message that we should have faith that God will prevail ("symbolic interpretation"), to complex end time scenarios ("futurist interpretation"), to the views of critics who deny any spiritual value to Revelation at all.

Most Christian interpretations fall into one or more of the following categories:

<a href="%60Abdu%27l-Bah%C3%A1">`Abdu'l-Bahá</a> has given some interpretations about the 11th and 12th chapters of Revelation in "<a href="Some%20Answered%20Questions">Some Answered Questions</a>". The 1,260 days spoken of in the forms: one thousand two hundred and sixty days, forty-two months, refers to the 1,260 years in the <a href="Islamic%20Calendar">Islamic Calendar</a> (AH 1260 or 1844 CE). The "two witnesses" spoken of are <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> and <a href="Ali">Ali</a>. Also, the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> reads, "And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads". The seven heads of the dragon are symbolic of the seven provinces dominated by the Umayyads: Damascus, Persia, Arabia, Egypt, Africa, Andalusia, and Transoxania. The ten horns represent the ten names of the leaders of the Umayyad dynasty: Abu Sufyan, Muawiya, Yazid, Marwan, Abd al-Malik, Walid, Sulayman, Umar, Hisham, and Ibrahim. Some names were re-used, as in the case of Yazid II and Yazid III and the like, which were not counted for this interpretation.

<a href="Eastern%20Orthodoxy">Eastern Orthodoxy</a> treats the text as simultaneously describing contemporaneous events (events occurring at the same time) and as prophecy of events to come, for which the contemporaneous events were a form of foreshadow. It rejects attempts to determine, before the fact, if the events of Revelation are occurring by mapping them onto present-day events, taking to heart the Scriptural warning against those who proclaim "He is here!" prematurely. Instead, the book is seen as a warning to be spiritually and morally ready for the end times, whenever they may come ("as a thief in the night"), but they will come at the time of God's choosing, not something that can be precipitated nor trivially deduced by mortals. This view is also held by many Catholics, although there is a diversity of opinion about the nature of the Apocalypse within Catholicism.

Book of Revelation is the only book of the New Testament that is not read during services by the Byzantine Rite Churches although in the <a href="Western%20Rite%20Orthodoxy">Western Rite Orthodox Parishes</a>, which are under the same bishops as the Byzantine Rite, it is read.

Christian Gnostics, however, are unlikely to be attracted to the teaching of Revelation because the doctrine of salvation through the sacrificed Lamb, which is central to Revelation, is repugnant to Gnostics. Christian Gnostics "believed in the Forgiveness of Sins, but in no vicarious sacrifice for sin ... they accepted Christ in the full realisation of the word; his life, not his death, was the keynote of their doctrine and their practice."

<a href="James%20Morgan%20Pryse">James Morgan Pryse</a> was an esoteric gnostic who saw Revelation as a western version of the Hindu theory of the <a href="Chakra">Chakra</a>. He began his work, "The purpose of this book is to show that the Apocalypse is a manual of spiritual development and not, as conventionally interpreted, a cryptic history or prophecy." Such diverse theories have failed to command widespread acceptance. But Christopher Rowland argues: "there are always going to be loose threads which refuse to be woven into the fabric as a whole. The presence of the threads which stubbornly refuse to be incorporated into the neat tapestry of our world-view does not usually totally undermine that view."

"Also known as the Apocalypse, a Greek word meaning revealed or uncovered. The message of Revelation is the same as that of all scripture: there will be an eventual triumph on this earth of God over the devil; a permanent victory of good over evil, of the Saints over their persecutors, of the kingdom of God over the kingdoms of men and of Satan. This is the subject on which Amos, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Paul, Peter, and all the prophets have written. They spoke of a day of victory that would come, and that the end would be better (more glorious) than the beginning. The victory would be achieved through Jesus Christ."

"Such is the theme of the Revelation. The details about the beasts, the wars, the angels, the men, etc., contribute to the development of this theme. By a little study, the theme can be perceived even if the details are not completely identified. It may be in this sense that the Prophet <a href="Joseph%20Smith">Joseph Smith</a> said that Revelation was 'one of the plainest books God ever caused to be written' (<a href="History%20of%20the%20Church%20%28Joseph%20Smith%29">History of the Church</a> 5:342). However, the more fully the details are understood, the greater will be the appreciation of the theme. If we fail to catch a glimpse of the theme, we fail in our comprehension, no matter how many details we are able to understand."

The Book of Mormon confirms that <a href="John%20the%20Apostle">John the Apostle</a> is the author of Revelation and that he was foreordained by God to write it.

Latter-day revelation through the Prophet Joseph Smith contained in the Doctrine and Covenants, section 77, provides answers to specific questions regarding the symbolism contained in the Book of Revelation. Topics include: the sea of glass, the four beasts and their appearance, the 24 elders, the book with seven seals, certain angels, the sealing of the 144,000, the little book eaten by John, and the two witnesses in Chapter 11.

Latter-day Saints believe that the warning contained in Revelation 22:18-19 does not refer to the biblical canon as a whole. Rather, an open and ongoing dialogue between God and the modern-day Prophet and Apostles of the LDS faith constitute an open canon of scripture.

In the <a href="Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church%20of%20Alexandria">Coptic Orthodox Church</a> the whole Book of Revelation is read during Apocalypse Night or <a href="Bright%20Saturday">Bright Saturday</a> (6 days after Pascha).

This interpretation, which has found expression among both Catholic and Protestant theologians, considers the liturgical worship, particularly the <a href="Easter">Easter</a> rites, of early Christianity as background and context for understanding the Book of Revelation's structure and significance. This perspective is explained in "The Paschal Liturgy and the Apocalypse" (new edition, 2004) by <a href="Massey%20H.%20Shepherd">Massey H. Shepherd</a>, an Episcopal scholar, and in <a href="Scott%20Hahn">Scott Hahn</a>'s "The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth" (1999), in which he states that Revelation in form is structured after creation, fall, judgment and redemption. Those who hold this view say that the Temple's destruction (AD 70) had a profound effect on the Jewish people, not only in Jerusalem but among the Greek-speaking Jews of the Mediterranean.

They believe the Book of Revelation provides insight into the early Eucharist, saying that it is the new Temple worship in the New Heaven and Earth. The idea of the Eucharist as a foretaste of the heavenly banquet is also explored by British Methodist Geoffrey Wainwright in his book "Eucharist and Eschatology" (Oxford University Press, 1980). According to <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> some of the images of Revelation should be understood in the context of the dramatic suffering and persecution of the churches of Asia in the 1st century.

Accordingly, the Book of Revelation should not be read as an enigmatic warning, but as an encouraging vision of Christ's definitive victory over evil.

The radical discipleship interpretation asserts that the Book of Revelation is best understood as a handbook for radical discipleship; i. e., how to remain faithful to the spirit and teachings of Jesus and avoid simply assimilating to surrounding society. In this interpretation the primary agenda of the book is to expose as impostors the worldly powers that seek to oppose the ways of God and God's Kingdom. The chief temptation for Christians in the 1st century, and today, is to fail to hold fast to the non-violent teachings and example of Jesus and instead be lured into unquestioning adoption and assimilation of worldly, national or cultural values – <a href="imperialism">imperialism</a>, <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a>, and <a href="civil%20religion">civil religion</a> being the most dangerous and insidious.

This perspective (closely related to <a href="liberation%20theology">liberation theology</a>) draws on the approach of Bible scholars such as <a href="Ched%20Myers">Ched Myers</a>, <a href="William%20Stringfellow">William Stringfellow</a>, <a href="Richard%20Horsley">Richard Horsley</a>, <a href="Daniel%20Berrigan">Daniel Berrigan</a>, Wes Howard-Brook, and Joerg Rieger. Various <a href="Christian%20anarchism">Christian anarchists</a>, such as <a href="Jacques%20Ellul">Jacques Ellul</a>, have identified the <a href="State%20%28polity%29">State</a> and <a href="political%20power">political power</a> as <a href="The%20Beast%20%28Bible%29">the Beast</a>.

Adventists maintain a historicist interpretation of the Bible's predictions of the apocalypse.

Seventh-day Adventists believe the Book of Revelation is especially relevant to believers in the days preceding the second coming of Jesus Christ. "The universal church is composed of all who truly believe in Christ, but in the last days, a time of widespread apostasy, a remnant has been called out to keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus." "Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus." As participatory agents in the work of salvation for all humankind, "This remnant announces the arrival of the judgment hour, proclaims salvation through Christ, and heralds the approach of His second advent." 

Many literary writers and theorists have contributed to a wide range of theories about the origins and purpose of the Book of Revelation. Some of these writers have no connection with established Christian faiths but, nevertheless, found in Revelation a source of inspiration. Revelation has been approached from Hindu philosophy and Jewish <a href="Midrash">Midrash</a>. Others have pointed to aspects of composition which have been ignored such as the similarities of prophetic inspiration to modern poetic inspiration, or the parallels with <a href="Theatre%20of%20ancient%20Greece">Greek drama</a>. In recent years, theories have arisen which concentrate upon how readers and texts interact to create meaning and which are less interested in what the original author intended.

<a href="Charles%20Cutler%20Torrey">Charles Cutler Torrey</a> taught <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic languages</a> at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a>. His lasting contribution has been to show how much more meaningful prophets, such as the scribe of Revelation, are when treated as poets first and foremost. He thought this was a point often lost sight of because most English bibles render everything in prose. Poetry was also the reason John never directly quoted the older prophets. Had he done so, he would have had to use their (Hebrew) poetry whereas he wanted to write his own. Torrey insisted Revelation had originally been written in Aramaic.

This was why the surviving Greek translation was written in such a strange idiom. It was a literal translation that had to comply with the warning at Revelation 22:18 that the text must not be corrupted in any way. According to Torrey, the story is that "The Fourth Gospel was brought to Ephesus by a Christian fugitive from Palestine soon after the middle of the first century. It was written in Aramaic." Later, the Ephesians claimed this fugitive had actually been the beloved disciple himself. Subsequently, this John was banished by Nero and died on Patmos after writing Revelation. Torrey argued that until AD 80, when Christians were expelled from the synagogues, the Christian message was always first heard in the synagogue and, for cultural reasons, the evangelist would have spoken in Aramaic, else "he would have had no hearing." Torrey showed how the three major songs in Revelation (the new song, the song of Moses and the Lamb and the chorus at 19: 6–8) each fall naturally into four regular metrical lines plus a coda. Other dramatic moments in Revelation, such as 6:16 where the terrified people cry out to be hidden, behave in a similar way.

<a href="Christina%20Rossetti">Christina Rossetti</a> was a Victorian poet who believed the sensual excitement of the natural world found its meaningful purpose in death and in God. Her "The Face of the Deep" is a meditation upon the Apocalypse. In her view, what Revelation has to teach is patience. Patience is the closest to perfection the human condition allows. Her book, which is largely written in prose, frequently breaks into poetry or jubilation, much like Revelation itself. The relevance of John's visions belongs to Christians of all times as a continuous present meditation. Such matters are eternal and outside of normal human reckoning. "That winter which will be the death of Time has no promise of termination. Winter that returns not to spring ... – who can bear it?" She dealt deftly with the vengeful aspects of John's message. "A few are charged to do judgment; everyone without exception is charged to show mercy." Her conclusion is that Christians should see John as "representative of all his brethren" so they should "hope as he hoped, love as he loved."

Recently, aesthetic and literary modes of interpretation have developed, which focus on Revelation as a work of art and imagination, viewing the imagery as symbolic depictions of timeless truths and the victory of good over evil. <a href="Elisabeth%20Sch%C3%BCssler%20Fiorenza">Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza</a> wrote "Revelation: Vision of a Just World" from the viewpoint of rhetoric. Accordingly, Revelation's meaning is partially determined by the way John goes about saying things, partially by the context in which readers receive the message and partially by its appeal to something beyond logic.

Professor Schuessler Fiorenza believes that Revelation has particular relevance today as a liberating message to disadvantaged groups. John's book is a vision of a just world, not a vengeful threat of world-destruction. Her view that Revelation's message is not gender-based has caused dissent. She says we are to look behind the symbols rather than make a fetish out of them. In contrast, Tina Pippin states that John writes "<a href="Horror%20fiction">horror literature</a>" and "the <a href="misogyny">misogyny</a> which underlies the narrative is extreme."

<a href="D.%20H.%20Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a> took an opposing, pessimistic view of Revelation in the final book he wrote, "Apocalypse". He saw the language which Revelation used as being bleak and destructive; a 'death-product'. Instead, he wanted to champion a public-spirited individualism (which he identified with the historical Jesus supplemented by an ill-defined cosmic consciousness) against its two natural enemies. One of these he called "the sovereignty of the intellect" which he saw in a technology-based totalitarian society. The other enemy he styled "vulgarity" and that was what he found in Revelation. "It is very nice if you are poor and not humble ... to bring your enemies down to utter destruction, while you yourself rise up to grandeur. And nowhere does this happen so splendiferously than in Revelation."

His specific aesthetic objections to Revelation were that its imagery was unnatural and that phrases like "the wrath of the Lamb" were "ridiculous." He saw Revelation as comprising two discordant halves. In the first, there was a scheme of cosmic renewal in "great Chaldean sky-spaces", which he quite liked. After that, Lawrence thought, the book became preoccupied with the birth of the baby messiah and "flamboyant hate and simple lust ... for the end of the world." Lawrence coined the term "Patmossers" to describe those Christians who could only be happy in paradise if they knew their enemies were suffering in hell.

Modern biblical scholarship attempts to understand Revelation in its 1st century historical context within the genre of Jewish and Christian apocalyptic literature. This approach considers the text as an address to seven historical communities in Asia Minor. Under this interpretation, assertions that "the time is near" are to be taken literally by those communities. Consequently, the work is viewed as a warning to not conform to contemporary Greco-Roman society which John "unveils" as beastly, demonic, and subject to divine judgment. There is further information on these topics in the entries on <a href="higher%20criticism">higher criticism</a> and <a href="Apocalypticism">apocalyptic literature</a>.

Although the acceptance of Revelation into the <a href="Biblical%20canon">canon</a> has from the beginning been controversial, it has been essentially similar to the career of other texts. The eventual exclusion of other contemporary apocalyptic literature from the canon may throw light on the unfolding historical processes of what was officially considered orthodox, what was <a href="heterodox">heterodox</a>, and what was even heretical. Interpretation of meanings and imagery are anchored in what the historical author intended and what his contemporary audience inferred; a message to Christians not to assimilate into the Roman imperial culture was John's central message. Thus, his letter (written in the apocalyptic genre) is pastoral in nature (its purpose is offering hope to the downtrodden), and the symbolism of Revelation is to be understood entirely within its historical, literary, and social context. Critics study the conventions of apocalyptic literature and events of the 1st century to make sense of what the author may have intended.

Much of Revelation employs ancient sources, primarily but not exclusively the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>. For example, Howard-Brook and Gwyther regard the <a href="Book%20of%20Enoch">Book of Enoch</a> (1 Enoch) as an equally significant but contextually different source. "Enoch's journey has no close parallel in the Hebrew scriptures." Revelation, in one section, forms an inverted parallel (<a href="chiasmus">chiasmus</a>) with the book of Enoch in which 1 En 100:1-3 has a river of blood deep enough to submerge a chariot and in Rev 14:20 has a river of blood up to the horse's bridle. There is an angel ascending in both accounts (1 En 100:4; Rev 14:14-19) and both accounts have three messages (1 En 100:7-9; Rev 14:6-12).

Academics showed little interest in this topic until recently. This was not, however, the case with popular writers from non-conforming backgrounds, who interspersed the text of Revelation with the prophecy they thought was being promised. For example, an anonymous Scottish commentary of 1871 prefaces Revelation 4 with the Little Apocalypse of Mark 13, places Malachi 4:5 ("Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord") within Revelation 11 and writes Revelation 12:7 side-by-side with the role of "the Satan" in the <a href="Book%20of%20Job">Book of Job</a>. The message is that everything in Revelation will happen in its previously appointed time.

Steve Moyise uses the index of the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament to show that "Revelation contains more Old Testament <a href="allusion">allusion</a>s than any other New Testament book, but it does not record a single quotation." Perhaps significantly, Revelation chooses different sources than other New Testament books. Revelation concentrates on Isaiah, Psalms, and Ezekiel, while neglecting, comparatively speaking, the books of the Pentateuch that are the dominant sources for other New Testament writers. Methodological objections have been made to this course as each allusion may not have an equal significance. To counter this, G. K. Beale sought to develop a system that distinguished 'clear', 'probable', and 'possible' allusions. A clear allusion is one with almost the same wording as its source, the same general meaning, and which could not reasonably have been drawn from elsewhere. A probable allusion contains an idea which is uniquely traceable to its source. Possible allusions are described as mere echoes of their putative sources.

Yet, with Revelation, the problems might be judged more fundamental. The author seems to be using his sources in a completely different way to the originals. For example, he borrows the 'new temple' imagery of Ezekiel 40–48 but uses it to describe a New Jerusalem which, quite pointedly, no longer needs a temple because it is God's dwelling. Ian Boxall writes that Revelation "is no montage of biblical quotations (that is not John's way) but a wealth of allusions and evocations rewoven into something new and creative." In trying to identify this "something new", Boxall argues that Ezekiel provides the 'backbone' for Revelation. He sets out a comparative table listing the chapters of Revelation in sequence and linking most of them to the structurally corresponding chapter in Ezekiel. The interesting point is that the order is not the same. John, on this theory, rearranges Ezekiel to suit his own purposes.

Some commentators argue that it is these purposes – and not the structure – that really matter. G. K. Beale believes that, however much John makes use of Ezekiel, his ultimate purpose is to present Revelation as a fulfillment of <a href="Daniel%207">Daniel 7</a>.

One theory, Revelation Draft Hypothesis, sees the book of Revelation constructed by forming parallels with several texts in the Old Testament such as Ezekiel, Isaiah, Zechariah, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Exodus, and Daniel. For example, Ezekiel's encounter with God is in reverse order as John's encounter with God (Ezek 1:5-28; Rev 4:2-7; note both accounts have beings with faces of a lion, ox or calf, man, and eagle (Ezek 1:10; Rev 4:7), both accounts have an expanse before the throne (Ezek 1:22; Rev 4:6). The chariot's horses in Zechariah's are the same colors as the four horses in Revelation (Zech 6:1-8; Rev 6:1-8). The nesting of the seven marches around Jericho by Joshua is reenacted by Jesus nesting the seven trumpets within the seventh seal (Josh 6:8-10; Rev 6:1-17; 8:1-9:21; 11:15-19). The description of the beast in Revelation is taken directly out of Daniel (see Dan 7:2-8; Rev 13:1-7). The method that John used allowed him to use the Hebrew Scriptures as the source and also use basic techniques of parallel formation, thereby alluding to the Hebrew Scriptures.

Books of Kings

The two Books of Kings, originally a single book, are the eleventh and twelfth books of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> or <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>. They conclude the <a href="Deuteronomistic%20history">Deuteronomistic history</a>, a history of Israel also comprising the books of <a href="Book%20of%20Joshua">Joshua</a> and <a href="Book%20of%20Judges">Judges</a> and the two <a href="Books%20of%20Samuel">Books of Samuel</a>, which <a href="biblical%20commentator">biblical commentator</a>s believe was written to provide a <a href="Theology">theological</a> explanation for the <a href="Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%28587%20BC%29">destruction of the Kingdom of Judah</a> by Babylon in c. 586 BCE and a foundation for a return from <a href="Babylonian%20captivity">exile</a>. The two books of Kings present a <a href="history%20of%20ancient%20Israel%20and%20Judah">history of ancient Israel and Judah</a> from the death of King <a href="David">David</a> to the release of <a href="Jehoiachin">Jehoiachin</a> from imprisonment in Babylon, a period of some 400 years ().

In David's old age, <a href="Adonijah">Adonijah</a> proclaims himself his successor but <a href="Solomon">Solomon</a>'s supporters arrange for David to proclaim Solomon as his successor, and so he comes to the throne after David's death. At the beginning of his reign he assumes God's promises to David and brings splendour to Israel and peace and prosperity to his people. The centrepiece of Solomon's reign is the building of the <a href="Temple%20of%20Solomon">First Temple</a>: the claim that this took place 480 years after <a href="the%20Exodus">the Exodus</a> from Egypt marks it as a key event in Israel's history. At the end, however, he follows other gods and oppresses Israel.

As a consequence of Solomon's failure to stamp out the worship of gods other than <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a>, the kingdom of David is split in two in the reign of his own son <a href="Rehoboam">Rehoboam</a>, who becomes the first to reign over the <a href="kingdom%20of%20Judah">kingdom of Judah</a>. The kings who follow Rehoboam in Jerusalem continue the royal line of David (i.e., they inherit the promise to David); in the north, however, dynasties follow each other in rapid succession, and the kings are uniformly bad (meaning that they fail to follow Yahweh alone). At length God brings the <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>ns to destroy the northern kingdom, leaving Judah as the sole custodian of the promise.

<a href="Hezekiah">Hezekiah</a>, the 14th king of Judah, does "what was right in the eyes of the Lord" and institutes a far reaching religious reform, centralising sacrifice at the temple at Jerusalem and destroying the images of other gods. Yahweh saves Jerusalem and the kingdom from an invasion by Assyria. But <a href="Manasseh%20of%20Judah">Manasseh</a>, the next king, reverses the reforms, and God announces that he will destroy Jerusalem because of this apostasy by the king. Manasseh's righteous grandson <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a> reinstitutes the reforms of Hezekiah, but it is too late: God, speaking through the prophetess <a href="Huldah">Huldah</a>, affirms that Jerusalem is to be destroyed.

God brings the <a href="Neo-Babylonian%20Empire">Babylonians</a> against Jerusalem; Yahweh deserts his people, Jerusalem is razed and the Temple destroyed, and the priests, prophets and royal court are led into captivity. The final verses record how <a href="Jehoiachin">Jehoiachin</a>, the last king, is set free and given honour by the king of Babylon.

In the original Hebrew Bible (the Bible used by Jews), First and Second Kings are a single book, as are the First and Second <a href="Books%20of%20Samuel">Books of Samuel</a>. When this was translated into <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> in the last few centuries BCE, Kings was joined with Samuel in a four-part work called the <a href="Books%20of%20the%20Kingdoms">Book of Kingdoms</a>. The <a href="Greek%20Orthodox">Greek Orthodox</a> branch of Christianity continues to use the Greek translation (the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>), but when a Latin translation (called the <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a>) was made for the Western church, Kingdoms was first retitled the Book of Kings, parts One to Four, and eventually both Kings and Samuel were separated into two books each.

Then, what it is now commonly known as 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel are called by <a href="the%20Vulgate">the Vulgate</a>, in imitation of <a href="Septuagint">the Septuagint</a>, 1 Kings and 2 Kings respectively. What it is now commonly known as 1 Kings and 2 Kings would be 3 Kings and 4 Kings in old Bibles before the year 1516 such as the Vulgate and the Septuagint respectively. The division we know today, used by Protestant Bibles and adopted by Catholics, came into use in 1517. Some Bibles still preserve the old denomination, for example, <a href="Douay%20Rheims%20bible">Douay Rheims bible</a>.

According to Jewish tradition the author of Kings was <a href="Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>, who would have been alive during the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BCE. The most common view today accepts <a href="Martin%20Noth">Martin Noth</a>'s thesis that Kings concludes a unified series of books which reflect the language and theology of the <a href="Book%20of%20Deuteronomy">Book of Deuteronomy</a>, and which biblical scholars therefore call the <a href="Deuteronomistic%20history">Deuteronomistic history</a>. Noth argued that the History was the work of a single individual living in the 6th century BCE, but scholars today tend to treat it as made up of at least two layers, a first edition from the time of <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a> (late 7th century BCE), promoting Josiah's religious reforms and the need for repentance, and (2) a second and final edition from the mid 6th century BCE. Further levels of editing have also been proposed, including: a late 8th century BCE edition pointing to <a href="Hezekiah">Hezekiah</a> of Judah as the model for kingship; an earlier 8th century BCE version with a similar message but identifying <a href="Jehu">Jehu</a> of Israel as the ideal king; and an even earlier version promoting the House of David as the key to national well-being.

The editors/authors of the Deuteronomistic history cite a number of sources, including (for example) a "<a href="Acts%20of%20Solomon">Book of the Acts of Solomon</a>" and, frequently, the "<a href="Chronicles%20of%20the%20Kings%20of%20Judah">Annals of the Kings of Judah</a>" and a separate book, "<a href="Chronicles%20of%20the%20Kings%20of%20Israel">Chronicles of the Kings of Israel</a>". The "Deuteronomic" perspective (that of the book of Deuteronomy) is particularly evident in prayers and speeches spoken by key figures at major transition points: Solomon's speech at the dedication of the Temple is a key example. The sources have been heavily edited to meet the Deuteronomistic agenda, but in the broadest sense they appear to have been:


Kings is "history-like" rather than history in the modern sense, mixing legends, folktales, miracle stories and "fictional constructions" in with the annals, and its primary explanation for all that happens is God's offended sense of what is right; it is therefore more fruitful to read it as theological literature in the form of history. The theological bias is seen in the way it judges each king of Israel on the basis of whether he recognises the authority of the <a href="Temple%20in%20Jerusalem">Temple in Jerusalem</a> (none do, and therefore all are "evil"), and each king of Judah on the basis of whether he destroys the "<a href="high%20place">high place</a>s" (rivals to the Temple in Jerusalem); it gives only passing mention to important and successful kings like <a href="Omri">Omri</a> and <a href="Jeroboam%20II">Jeroboam II</a> and totally ignores one of the most significant events in ancient Israel's history, the <a href="battle%20of%20Qarqar">battle of Qarqar</a>.

The major themes of Kings are God's promise, the recurrent apostasy of the kings, and the judgement this brings on Israel:

Another and related theme is that of prophecy. The main point of the prophetic stories is that God's prophecies are always fulfilled, so that any not yet fulfilled will be so in the future. The implication, the release of Jehoiachin and his restoration to a place of honour in Babylon in the closing scenes of the book, is that the promise of an eternal Davidic dynasty is still in effect, and that the Davidic line will be restored.

The standard Hebrew text of Kings presents an impossible chronology. To take just a single example, <a href="Omri">Omri</a>'s accession to the throne of Israel in the 31st year of <a href="Asa%20of%20Judah">Asa of Judah</a> (1 Kings 16:23) cannot follow the death of his predecessor <a href="Zimri%20%28king%29">Zimri</a> in the 27th year of Asa (1 Kings 16:15). The Greek text corrects the impossibilities but does not seem to represent an earlier version. A large number of scholars have claimed to solve the difficulties, but the results differ, sometimes widely, and none has achieved consensus status.

<a href="2%20Chronicles">2 Chronicles</a> covers much the same time-period as Kings, but it ignores the northern <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28Samaria%29">Kingdom of Israel</a> almost completely, David is given a major role in planning the Temple, <a href="Hezekiah">Hezekiah</a> is given a much more far-reaching program of reform, and <a href="Manasseh%20of%20Judah">Manasseh of Judah</a> is given an opportunity to repent of his sins, apparently to account for his long reign. It is usually assumed that the author of Chronicles used Kings as a source and re-wrote history as he would have liked it to have been.

Book of Ruth

The Book of Ruth (, <a href="Ashkenazi%20Hebrew">Ashkenazi pronunciation</a>: , "Megilath Ruth", "the Scroll of Ruth", one of the <a href="Five%20Megillot">Five Megillot</a>) is included in the third division, or the Writings (<a href="Ketuvim">Ketuvim</a>), of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>; in most <a href="Old%20Testament">Christian canons</a> it is treated as a history book and placed between <a href="Book%20of%20Judges">Judges</a> and <a href="1%20Samuel">1 Samuel</a>, as it is set "in the days when the judges judged", although the <a href="Peshitto">Syriac Christian tradition</a> places it later, between <a href="Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</a> and the <a href="Song%20of%20Songs">Song of Songs</a>. It is named after its central figure, <a href="Ruth%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Ruth</a> the <a href="Moab">Moab</a>itess, the great-grandmother of <a href="David">David</a>.

The book tells of Ruth's accepting the God of the Israelites as her God and the Israelite people as her own. In Ruth 1:16-17, Ruth tells <a href="Naomi%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Naomi</a>, her Israelite <a href="Parent-in-law%23Mothers-in-law">mother-in-law</a>, "Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me." The book is held in esteem by Jews who fall under the category of <a href="Conversion%20to%20Judaism">Jews-by-choice</a>, as is evidenced by the considerable presence of <a href="Boaz">Boaz</a> in rabbinic literature. The Book of Ruth also functions liturgically, as it is read during the <a href="Jewish%20holiday">Jewish holiday</a> of <a href="Shavuot">Shavuot</a> ("Weeks").

The book is structured in four chapters:

Act 1: Prologue and Problem: Death and Emptiness (1:1–22)

Act 2: Ruth Meets Boaz, Naomi's Relative, on the Harvest Field (2:1–23)

Act 3: Naomi Sends Ruth to Boaz on the Threshing Floor (3:1–18)

Act 4: Resolution and Epilogue: Life and Fullness (4:1–22)

Genealogical appendix (4:18–22)

During the time of the <a href="Biblical%20judges">Judges</a> when there was a famine, an Israelite family from <a href="Bethlehem">Bethlehem</a> – Elimelech, his wife <a href="Naomi%20%28Bible%29">Naomi</a>, and their sons <a href="Mahlon%20and%20Chilion">Mahlon and Chilion</a> – emigrated to the nearby country of <a href="Moab">Moab</a>. Elimelech died, and the sons married two Moabite women: Mahlon married <a href="Ruth%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Ruth</a> and Chilion married <a href="Orpah">Orpah</a>.

After about ten years, the two sons of Naomi also died in Moab (<a href="Ruth%201%23Verse%204">1:4</a>). Naomi decided to return to Bethlehem. She told her daughters-in-law to return to their own mothers and remarry. Orpah reluctantly left; however, Ruth said, "Intreat me not to leave thee, "[or]" to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people "[shall be]" my people, and thy God my God: Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the do so to me, and more also, "[if aught]" but death part thee and me." (Ruth 1:16–17 KJV)

The two women returned to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest, and in order to support her mother-in-law and herself, Ruth went to the fields to <a href="gleaning">glean</a>. As it happened, the field she went to belonged to a man named <a href="Boaz">Boaz</a>, who was kind to her because he had heard of her loyalty to her mother-in-law. Ruth told Naomi of Boaz's kindness, and she gleaned in his field through the remainder of barley and wheat harvest.

Boaz was a close relative of Naomi's husband's family. He was therefore obliged by the <a href="Yibbum">Levirate</a> law to marry Mahlon's widow, Ruth, in order to carry on his family's inheritance. Naomi sent Ruth to the threshing floor at night and told her to go where he slept, and "uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do" (<a href="Ruth%203%23Verse%204">3:4</a>). Ruth did so. Boaz asked her who she was, and she replied: "I "[am]" Ruth thine handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou "[art]" a near kinsman." (3:9) Boaz blessed her and agreed to do all that is required, and he noted that, "all the city of my people doth know that thou "[art]" a virtuous woman." (3:11) He then acknowledged that he was a close relative, but that there was one who was closer, and she remained in submission at his feet until she returned into the city in the morning.

Early that day, Boaz went to the city gate to meet with the other male relative before the town elders. The relative is not named: Boaz addresses him as "Friend", "<a href="Ploni%20Almoni">ploni almoni</a>", literally "so and so". The Expanded Bible's editors comment that "the man is not named, perhaps ironically because he refused to preserve Naomi’s family name".

The unnamed relative was unwilling to jeopardize the inheritance of his own estate by marrying Ruth, and so relinquished his right of redemption, thus allowing Boaz to marry Ruth. They transferred the property and redeemed it, ratified by the nearer kinsman taking off his shoe and handing it over to Boaz. <a href="Ruth%204%23Verse%207">Ruth 4:7</a> notes for later generations that:

Boaz and Ruth were then married and have a son. The women of the city celebrate Naomi's joy, for Naomi found a redeemer for her family name, and Naomi takes the child and places it in her bosom.

The child is named <a href="Obed%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Obed</a>, who we discover is "the father of Jesse, the father of David" (Ruth 4:13–17), that is, the grandfather of <a href="King%20David">King David</a>.

The book concludes with an appendix which traces the Davidic genealogy all the way back from <a href="Perez%20%28son%20of%20Judah%29">Perez</a>, "whom <a href="Tamar%20%28Genesis%29">Tamar</a> bore to <a href="Judah%20%28son%20of%20Jacob%29">Judah</a>", through to Obed, down to David.

The book does not name its author. It is traditionally ascribed to the prophet <a href="Samuel">Samuel</a>, but Ruth's identity as a non-Israelite and the stress on the need for an inclusive attitude towards foreigners suggests an origin in the fifth century BCE, when <a href="Exogamy">intermarriage</a> had become controversial (as seen in <a href="Ezra-Nehemiah">Ezra</a> 9:1 and <a href="book%20of%20Nehemiah">Nehemiah</a> 13:1). A substantial number of scholars therefore date it to the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian period</a> (6th–4th centuries BC). The genealogy that concludes the book is believed to be a post-exilic <a href="Priestly%20source">Priestly</a> addition, as it adds nothing to the plot; nevertheless, it is carefully crafted and integrates the book into the <a href="history%20of%20Israel">history of Israel</a> running from Genesis to Kings.

 refers to a time when <a href="Midianite">Midianite</a> hostilities destroyed the Israelites' crops. Sinker, writing in his "Introduction to the Book of Ruth" in <a href="Charles%20Ellicott">Ellicott</a>'s "Commentary for Modern Readers" suggests that the attempt "to connect the famine with the ravages of the Midianites" and other attempts to specify the timing of the story "involve mere guesses, and rest on too uncertain grounds".

The Book of Ruth illustrates the difficulty of trying to use laws given in books such as <a href="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a> as evidence of actual practice. Naomi plans to provide security for herself and Ruth by arranging a <a href="Levirate%20marriage">Levirate marriage</a> with Boaz. Her plan is overtly sexual: Ruth is to go to the threshing floor (a place associated with sexual activity), wait until Boaz has finished eating and drinking (a possible allusion to the story of <a href="Lot%20%28biblical%20person%29">Lot</a> and <a href="Lot%27s%20daughters">his daughters</a>, ancestors through incest of the Moabites), and to lie at his uncovered "feet" (a <a href="euphemism">euphemism</a> for genitals). Since there was no heir to inherit Elimelech's land, custom required a close relative (usually the dead man's brother) to marry the widow of the deceased in order to continue his family line (<a href="Deuteronomy">Deuteronomy</a> 25:5–10). This relative was called the <a href="go%27el">go'el</a>, the "kinsman-redeemer". As Boaz is not Elimelech's brother, nor is Ruth his widow, scholars refer to the arrangement here as "Levirate-like". A complication arises in the story: another man is a closer relative to Elimelech than Boaz and has first claim on Ruth. It is resolved through the custom that required land to stay in the family: a family could mortgage land to ward off poverty, but the law required a kinsman to purchase it back into the family (Leviticus 25:25ff). Boaz meets the near kinsman at the city gate (the place where contracts are settled); the kinsman first says he will purchase Elimelech's (now Naomi's) land, but, upon hearing he must also take Ruth as his wife, withdraws his offer. Boaz thus becomes Ruth and Naomi's "kinsman-redeemer."

The book can be read as a political parable relating to issues around the time of <a href="Ezra">Ezra</a> and <a href="Nehemiah">Nehemiah</a> (the 4th century BCE). The fictional nature of the story is established from the start through the names of the participants: the husband and father is Elimelech, meaning "My God is King", and his wife is Naomi, "Pleasing", but after the deaths of her sons Mahlon, "Sickness", and Chilion, "Wasting", she asks to be called Mara, "Bitter". The reference to <a href="Moab">Moab</a> raises questions, since in the rest of the biblical literature it is associated with hostility to Israel, sexual perversity, and <a href="idolatry">idolatry</a>, and excluded an Ammonite or a Moabite from "the congregation of the ; even to their tenth generation". Despite this, Ruth the Moabitess married a Judahite and even after his death still regarded herself a member of his family; she then married another Judahite and bore him a son who became an ancestor of <a href="David">David</a>. Contrary to the message of <a href="Ezra-Nehemiah">Ezra-Nehemiah</a>, where marriages between Jewish men and non-Jewish women were broken up, Ruth teaches that foreigners who convert to Judaism can become good Jews, foreign wives can become exemplary followers of Jewish law, and there is no reason to exclude them or their offspring from the community.

Scholars have increasingly explored Ruth in ways which allow it to address contemporary issues. <a href="feminism">Feminists</a>, for example, have recast the story as one of the <a href="dignity%20of%20labour">dignity of labour</a> and female self-sufficiency, and even as a model for <a href="lesbianism">lesbian</a> relations, while others have seen in it a celebration of the relationship between strong and resourceful women. Others have criticised it for its underlying, and potentially exploitative, acceptance of a system of patriarchy in which a woman's worth can only be measured through marriage and child-bearing. Others again have seen it as a book that champions outcast and oppressed peoples.

Book of Esther

The Book of Esther, also known in <a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> as "the Scroll" ("Megillah"), is a book in the third section ("<a href="Ketuvim">Ketuvim</a>", "Writings") of the <a href="Judaism">Jewish</a> "<a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>" (the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>) and in the Christian <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>. It relates the story of a <a href="Israelites">Hebrew</a> woman in <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persia</a>, born as Hadassah but known as <a href="Esther">Esther</a>, who becomes queen of Persia and thwarts a <a href="genocide">genocide</a> of her people. The story forms the core of the <a href="Jewish%20festival">Jewish festival</a> of <a href="Purim">Purim</a>, during which it is read aloud twice: once in the evening and again the following morning. Esther is the only book in the Bible that does not explicitly mention <a href="God%20in%20Judaism">God</a>.

The biblical Book of Esther is set in the Persian <a href="Capital%20city">capital</a> of <a href="Susa">Susa</a> ("Shushan") in the third year of the reign of the <a href="King%20of%20Persia">Persian king</a> <a href="Ahasuerus%23Book%20of%20Esther">Ahasuerus</a>. The name "Ahasuerus" is equivalent to "Xerxes" (both deriving from the <a href="Old%20Persian">Persian</a> "Khshayārsha"), and Ahasuerus is usually identified in modern sources as <a href="Xerxes%20I">Xerxes I</a>, who ruled between 486 and 465 BC, as it is to this monarch that the events described in Esther are thought to fit the most closely.

However, classical sources such as <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a>, the Jewish commentary "<a href="Esther%20Rabbah">Esther Rabbah</a>" and the <a href="Christian%20theologian">Christian theologian</a> <a href="Bar-Hebraeus">Bar-Hebraeus</a>, as well as the <a href="Koine%20Greek">Greek</a> <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> translation of Esther, instead identify Ahasuerus as either <a href="Artaxerxes%20I">Artaxerxes I</a> (reigned 465 to 424 BCE) or <a href="Artaxerxes%20II%20of%20Persia">Artaxerxes II</a> (reigned 404 to 358 BCE).

Assuming that Ahasuerus is indeed Xerxes I, the events described in Esther began around the years 483–482 BCE, and concluded in March 473 BCE.

The Book of Esther consists of an introduction (or <a href="exposition%20%28narrative%29">exposition</a>) in chapters 1 and 2; the main action (complication and resolution) in chapters 3 to 9:19; and a conclusion in 9:20–10:3.

The plot is structured around banquets ("mishteh"), a word that occurs twenty times in Esther and only 24 times in the rest of the Hebrew bible. This is appropriate given that Esther describes the origin of a Jewish feast, the feast of <a href="Purim">Purim</a>, but Purim itself is not the subject and no individual feast in the book is commemorated by Purim. The book's theme, rather, is the reversal of destiny through a sudden and unexpected turn of events: the Jews seem destined to be destroyed, but instead are saved. In literary criticism such a reversal is termed "peripety", and while on one level its use in Esther is simply a literary or aesthetic device, on another it is structural to the author's theme, suggesting that the power of God is at work behind human events.

The story begins with Ahasuerus, ruler of the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian Empire</a>, holding a lavish banquet, initially for his court and dignitaries and afterwards for all inhabitants of the capital city, <a href="Susa">Shushan</a>. On the seventh day, Ahasuerus orders the queen, <a href="Vashti">Vashti</a>, to come and display her beauty before the guests by wearing only her crown. She refuses. Furious, Ahasuerus has her removed from her position and makes arrangements to choose a new queen from a selection of beautiful young women from throughout the empire.

Among these women is the Jewish <a href="orphan">orphan</a>, <a href="Esther">Esther</a>. After the death of her parents, she was fostered by her cousin or uncle, <a href="Mordecai">Mordecai</a>. She finds favour in the King's eyes, and is crowned his new queen. Shortly afterwards, Mordecai discovers a plot by two courtiers, <a href="Bigthan%20and%20Teresh">Bigthan and Teresh</a>, to assassinate Ahasuerus. The conspirators are apprehended and hanged, and Mordecai's service to the King is duly recorded.

Ahasuerus appoints <a href="Haman">Haman</a> as his <a href="viceroy">viceroy</a>. Mordecai, who sits at the palace gates, falls into Haman's disfavour, as he refuses to bow down to him. Having discovered that Mordecai is Jewish, Haman plans to kill not just Mordecai, but all the Jews in the empire. He duly obtains Ahasuerus' permission to execute this plan, against payment of ten thousand <a href="talent%20%28measurement%29">talent</a>s of silver, and casts lots to choose the date on which to do this—the thirteenth of the month of <a href="Adar">Adar</a>.

When Mordecai finds out about the plan, he implores Esther to try and intercede with the King; but she is afraid to break the law and present herself to the King unsummoned, as this was punishable by death. She orders Mordecai to have all Jews fast for three days together with her, and on the third day she goes to Ahasuerus, who stretches out his sceptre to her to indicate that she is not to be punished. She invites him to a feast in the company of Haman. During the feast, she asks them to attend a further feast the next evening. Meanwhile, Haman is again offended by Mordecai and, at his wife's suggestion, has a <a href="gallows">gallows</a> built to hang him.

That night, King Ahasuerus suffers <a href="insomnia">insomnia</a>, and when he orders the court records be read to him in order to help him sleep, he is reminded of the services rendered by Mordecai in the previous plot against his life. Ahasuerus is informed that Mordecai never received any recognition for this.

Just then, Haman appears, to request the King's permission to hang Mordecai, but before he can make this request, King Ahasuerus asks Haman what should be done for the man that the King wishes to honor. Assuming that the man that the King is referring to is himself, Haman suggests that the man be dressed in the King's royal robes and led around on the King's royal horse, while a <a href="herald">herald</a> calls: "See how the King honours a man he wishes to reward!" To his surprise and horror, the King instructs Haman to do so to Mordecai.

Immediately after, Ahasuerus and Haman attend Esther's second banquet, at which she reveals that she is Jewish and that Haman is planning to exterminate her people, including her. Overcome by rage, Ahasuerus leaves the room; meanwhile Haman stays behind and begs Esther for his life, falling upon her in desperation. The King returns in at this very moment and thinks Haman is assaulting the queen; this makes him angrier than before and he orders Haman hanged on the gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordecai.

Unable to annul a formal royal decree, the King instead adds to it, permitting the Jews to arm and defend themselves on that day. On 13 Adar, Haman's ten sons and 500 other men are killed in Shushan. Upon hearing of this Esther requests it be repeated the next day, whereupon 300 more men are killed. Over 75,000 <a href="Persian%20people">Persian people</a> are slaughtered by the Jews, who are careful to take no plunder. Esther sends a letter instituting an annual commemoration of the Jewish people's redemption, in a holiday called <a href="Purim">Purim</a> (lots). Ahasuerus remains very powerful and continues his reign, with Mordecai assuming a prominent position in his court.

The "Megillat Esther" (Book of Esther) became the last of the 24 books of the <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> to be canonized by the Sages of the <a href="Great%20Assembly">Great Assembly</a>. According to the Talmud, it was a <a href="redaction">redaction</a> by the Great Assembly of an original text by Mordecai. It is usually dated to the 4th century BCE. <a href="Shemaryahu%20Talmon">Shemaryahu Talmon</a>, however, suggests that "the traditional setting of the book in the days of Xerxes I cannot be wide off the mark."

The Greek book of Esther, included in the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, is a retelling of the events of the Hebrew Book of Esther rather than a translation and records <a href="%23Additions%20to%20Esther">additional traditions</a> which do not appear in original Hebrew version, in particular the identification of Ahasuerus with <a href="Artaxerxes%20II%20of%20Persia">Artaxerxes</a> and details of various letters. It is dated around the late 2nd to early 1st century BCE. The Coptic and Ethiopic versions of Esther are translations of the Greek rather than the Hebrew Esther.

A Latin version of Esther was produced by <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> for the <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a>. It translates the Hebrew Esther but interpolates translations of the Greek Esther where the latter provides additional material.

Several Aramaic <a href="targum">targum</a>s of Esther were produced in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> of which two survive – the "<a href="Targum%20Rishon">Targum Rishon</a>" ("First Targum") and "<a href="Targum%20Sheni">Targum Sheni</a>" ("Second Targum") dated c. 500–1000 CE. These were not targums ("translations") in the true sense but like the Greek Esther are retellings of events and include additional legends relating to Purim. There is also a 16th-century recension of the "Targum Rishon", sometimes counted as "Targum Shelishi" ("Third Targum").

The book of Esther falls under the category of <a href="Ketuvim">Ketuvim</a>, one of three parts of the Jewish canon. According to some sources, it is a <a href="historical%20novel">historical novel</a>la, written to <a href="Myth%20of%20origins">explain the origin</a> of the Jewish holiday of Purim.

As noted by biblical scholar <a href="Michael%20D.%20Coogan">Michael D. Coogan</a>, the book contains specific details regarding certain subject matter (for example, Persian rule) which are historically inaccurate. For example, Coogan discusses an apparent inaccuracy regarding the age of Esther's cousin (or, according to others, uncle) <a href="Mordecai">Mordecai</a>. In Esther 2:5–6, either Mordecai or his great-grandfather Kish is identified as having been exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon by King <a href="Nebuchadnezzar%20II">Nebuchadnezzar II</a> in 597 BCE: "Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, among those taken captive with <a href="Jeconiah">Jeconiah</a> king of Judah". If this refers to Mordecai, he would have had to live over a century to have witnessed the events described in the Book of Esther. However, the verse may be read as referring not to Mordecai's exile to Babylon, but to his great-grandfather Kish's exile.

In her article "The Book of Esther and Ancient Storytelling", biblical scholar <a href="Adele%20Berlin">Adele Berlin</a> discusses the reasoning behind scholarly concern about the historicity of Esther. Much of this debate relates to the importance of distinguishing history and fiction within biblical texts, as Berlin argues, in order to gain a more accurate understanding of the history of the Israelite people. Berlin quotes a series of scholars who suggest that the author of Esther did not mean for the book to be considered as a historical writing, but intentionally wrote it to be a historical novella. The genre of novellas under which Esther falls was common during both the Persian and <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a>s to which scholars have dated the book of Esther.

There are certain elements of the book of Esther that are historically accurate. The story told in the book of Esther takes place during the rule of Ahasuerus, who has been identified as the 5th-century Persian king <a href="Xerxes%20I">Xerxes I</a> (reigned 486–465 BCE). The author also displays an accurate knowledge of Persian customs and palaces. However, according to Coogan, considerable historical inaccuracies remain throughout the text, supporting the view that the book of Esther is to be read as a historical novella which tells a story describing historical events but is not necessarily historical fact. <a href="Edwin%20M.%20Yamauchi">Edwin M. Yamauchi</a> has questioned the reliability of other historical sources, such as <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a>, to which Esther has been compared. Yamauchi wrote, "[Herodotus] was, however, the victim of unreliable informants and was not infallible." The reason for questioning the historical accuracy of such ancient writers as Herodotus is that he is one of the primary sources of knowledge for this time period, and it has been frequently assumed that his account may be more accurate than Esther's account.

Those arguing in favour of a historical reading of Esther most commonly identify Ahasuerus with <a href="Artaxerxes%20II">Artaxerxes II</a> (ruled 405–359 BCE), although in the past it was often assumed that he was <a href="Xerxes%20I">Xerxes I</a> (ruled 486–465 BCE). The <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> "Ahasuerus" ("ʔaḥašwērōš") is most likely derived from <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> "Xšayārša", the origin of the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "Xerxes". The Greek historian <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> wrote that Xerxes sought his <a href="Harem%20%28household%29">harem</a> after being defeated in the <a href="Greco-Persian%20Wars">Greco-Persian Wars</a>. He makes no reference to individual members of the harem except for a domineering <a href="Queen%20consort">Queen consort</a> named <a href="Amestris">Amestris</a>, whose father, <a href="Otanes">Otanes</a>, was one of Xerxes's generals. (In contrast, the Greek historian <a href="Ctesias">Ctesias</a> refers to a similar father-in-law/general figure named Onaphas.) Amestris has often been identified with <a href="Vashti">Vashti</a>, but this identification is problematic, as Amestris remained a powerful figure well into the reign of her son, <a href="Artaxerxes%20I">Artaxerxes I</a>, whereas Vashti is portrayed as dismissed in the early part of Xerxes's reign. Alternative attempts have been made to identify her with <a href="Esther">Esther</a>, although Esther is an orphan whose father was a Jew named Abihail.

As for the identity of Mordecai, the similar names "Marduka" and "Marduku" have been found as the name of officials in the Persian court in over thirty texts from the period of Xerxes I and his father <a href="Darius%20I">Darius I</a>, and may refer to up to four individuals, one of which might after all be Mordecai.

The "Old Greek" Septuagint version of Esther translates the name Ahasuerus as "Artaxerxes", a Greek name derived from the <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> "Artaxšaϑra". <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a> too relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks, and the <a href="Midrash">Midrash</a>ic text, "Esther Rabba" also makes the identification. <a href="Bar-Hebraeus">Bar-Hebraeus</a> identified Ahasuerus explicitly as <a href="Artaxerxes%20II%20of%20Persia">Artaxerxes II</a>; however, the names are not necessarily equivalent: Hebrew has a form of the name "Artaxerxes" distinct from "Ahasuerus", and a direct Greek rendering of "Ahasuerus" is used by both Josephus and the Septuagint for occurrences of the name outside the Book of Esther. Instead, the Hebrew name Ahasuerus accords with an inscription of the time that notes that Artaxerxes II was named also "Aršu", understood as a shortening of "Aḫšiyaršu" the Babylonian rendering of the Persian "Xšayārša" (Xerxes), through which the Hebrew "ʔaḥašwērōš" (Ahasuerus) is derived. <a href="Ctesias">Ctesias</a> related that Artaxerxes II was also called "Arsicas" which is understood as a similar shortening with the Persian suffix "-ke" that is applied to shortened names. <a href="Deinon">Deinon</a> related that Artaxerxes II was also called "Oarses" which is also understood to be derived from "Xšayārša".

Another view attempts to identify him instead with <a href="Artaxerxes%20I%20of%20Persia">Artaxerxes I</a> (ruled 465–424 BCE), whose Babylonian concubine, <a href="Kosmartydene">Kosmartydene</a>, was the mother of his son <a href="Darius%20II%20of%20Persia">Darius II</a> (ruled 424–405 BCE). Jewish tradition relates that Esther was the mother of a King Darius and so some try to identify Ahasuerus with Artaxerxes I and Esther with Kosmartydene.

Based on the view that the Ahasuerus of the <a href="Book%20of%20Tobit">Book of Tobit</a> is identical with that of the Book of Esther, some have also identified him as Nebuchadnezzar's ally <a href="Cyaxares">Cyaxares</a> (ruled 625–585 BCE). In certain manuscripts of Tobit, the former is called "Achiachar", which, like the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "Cyaxares", is thought to be derived from <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> "Huwaxšaϑra". Depending on the interpretation of Esther 2:5–6, Mordecai or his great-grandfather Kish was carried away from <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> with <a href="Jeconiah">Jeconiah</a> by <a href="Nebuchadnezzar%20II%20of%20Babylon">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, in 597 BCE. The view that it was Mordecai would be consistent with the identification of Ahasuerus with Cyaxares. Identifications with other Persian monarchs have also been suggested.

Jacob Hoschander has argued that evidence of the historicity of Haman and his father Hamedatha is seen in "Omanus" and "Anadatus" mentioned by <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> as being honoured with Anahita in the city of <a href="Zile">Zela</a>. Hoschander argues that these were not deities as Strabo supposed but garbled forms of "Haman" and "Hamedatha" who were being worshipped as martyrs. The names are indeed unattested in Persian texts as gods, however the Talmud ("Sanhedrin" 61b) and <a href="Rashi">Rashi</a> both record a practice of deifying Haman and Josephus speaks of him being worshipped. Attempts have been made to connect both "Omanus" and "Haman" with the Zoroastrian term <a href="Vohu%20Mana">Vohu Mana</a>; however this denotes the principle of "Good Thoughts" and is not the name of a deity.)

<a href="Christine%20Hayes">Christine Hayes</a> contrasts the Book of Esther with <a href="Apocalyptic%20literature">apocalyptic writings</a>, the <a href="Book%20of%20Daniel">Book of Daniel</a> in particular: both Esther and Daniel depict an existential threat to the Jewish people, but while Daniel commends the Jews to wait faithfully for God to resolve the crisis, in Esther the crisis is resolved entirely through human action and national solidarity. God, in fact, is not mentioned, Esther is portrayed as <a href="cultural%20assimilation">assimilated</a> to Persian culture, and Jewish identity in the book is an <a href="Jewish%20peoplehood">ethnic category</a> rather than a <a href="Judaism">religious one</a>.

This contrasts with traditional Jewish commentaries, such as the commentary of the <a href="Vilna%20Gaon">Vilna Gaon</a>, which states "But in every verse it discusses the great miracle. However, this miracle was in a hidden form, occurring through apparently natural processes, not like the Exodus from Egypt, which openly revealed the might of God." This follows the approach of the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a>, which states that "(The Book of) Esther is referenced in the Torah in the verse 'And I shall surely hide (in Hebrew, 'haster astir,' related to 'Esther') My Face from them on that day.

An additional six chapters appear interspersed in Esther in the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, the Greek translation of the Bible. This was noted by <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> in compiling the Latin <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a>. Additionally, the Greek text contains many small changes in the meaning of the main text. Jerome recognized the former as additions not present in the <a href="Tanakh">Hebrew Text</a> and placed them at the end of his Latin translation as chapters 10:4–16:24. This placement and numbering system is used in Catholic Bible translations based primarily on the Vulgate, such as the <a href="Douay%E2%80%93Rheims%20Bible">Douay–Rheims Bible</a> and the <a href="Knox%20Bible">Knox Bible</a>. In contrast, the 1979 revision of the Vulgate, the <a href="Nova%20Vulgata">Nova Vulgata</a>, incorporates the additions to Esther directly into the narrative itself, as do most modern Catholic English translations based on the original Hebrew and Greek (e.g., <a href="Revised%20Standard%20Version%20Catholic%20Edition">Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition</a>, <a href="New%20American%20Bible">New American Bible</a>, <a href="New%20Revised%20Standard%20Version%20Catholic%20Edition">New Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition</a>). The numbering system for the additions differs with each translation. The Nova Vulgata accounts for the additional verses by numbering them as extensions of the verses immediately following or preceding them (e.g., Esther 11:2–12 in the old Vulgate becomes Esther 1:1a–1k in the Nova Vulgata), while the NAB and its successor, the NABRE, assign letters of the alphabet as chapter headings for the additions (e.g., Esther 11:2–12:6 in the Vulgate becomes Esther A:1–17). The RSVCE and the NRSVCE place the additional material into the narrative, but retain the chapter and verse numbering of the old Vulgate.

These additions include:
By the time Esther was written, the foreign power visible on the horizon as a future threat to Judah was the <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>ians of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, who defeated the Persian empire about 150 years after the time of the story of Esther; the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> version noticeably calls Haman a "Bougaion" (βουγαῖον) where the Hebrew text describes him as an <a href="Agagite">Agagite</a>.

The canonicity of these Greek additions has been a subject of scholarly disagreement practically since their first appearance in the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>— <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>, being perhaps the most vocal <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a>-era critic of the work, considered even the original Hebrew version to be of very doubtful value. Luther's complaints against the book carried past the point of scholarly critique and may reflect Luther's antisemitism, which is disputed, such as in the biography of Luther by Derek Wilson, which points out that Luther's anger at the Jews was not at their race but at their theology.

The <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a>, the summation of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="Counter-Reformation">Counter-Reformation</a>, reconfirmed the entire book, both Hebrew text and Greek additions, as canonical. The Book of Esther is used twice in commonly used sections of the Catholic <a href="Lectionary">Lectionary</a>. In both cases, the text used is not only taken from a Greek addition, the readings also are the prayer of <a href="Mordecai">Mordecai</a>, and nothing of <a href="Esther">Esther</a>'s own words is ever used. The <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> uses the Septuagint version of Esther, as it does for all of the Old Testament. The additions are specifically listed in the <a href="Thirty-Nine%20Articles">Thirty-Nine Articles</a>, Article VI, of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>: "The rest of the Book of Esther".

Rail transport in Great Britain

The railway system in Great Britain is the oldest in the world: the world's first locomotive-hauled public railway opened in 1825. Most of the railway track is managed by <a href="Network%20Rail">Network Rail</a>, which in 2016 had a network of of <a href="standard-gauge">standard-gauge</a> lines, of which were <a href="Railway%20electrification%20in%20Great%20Britain">electrified</a>. These lines range from <a href="single%20track%20%28rail%29">single</a> to <a href="quadruple%20track">quadruple track</a> or more. In addition, some cities have separate rail-based mass transit systems (including the extensive and historic <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>). There are also several <a href="List%20of%20British%20heritage%20and%20private%20railways">private railways</a> (some of them <a href="British%20narrow%20gauge%20railways">narrow-gauge</a>), which are primarily short tourist lines. The British railway network is connected with that of <a href="continental%20Europe">continental Europe</a> by an undersea rail link, the <a href="Channel%20Tunnel">Channel Tunnel</a>, opened in 1994.

The United Kingdom is a member of the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Railways">International Union of Railways</a> (UIC). The <a href="UIC%20Country%20Code">UIC Country Code</a> for United Kingdom is 70. The UK has the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20rail%20transport%20network%20size">17th largest railway network in the world</a>; despite many lines having closed in the 20th century it remains one of the densest rail networks. It is <a href="Rail%20usage%20statistics%20by%20country">one of the busiest railways</a> in Europe, with 20% more train services than France, 60% more than Italy, and more than Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Portugal and Norway combined, as well as representing more than 20% of all passenger journeys in Europe.

In 2016, there were 1.718 billion journeys on the <a href="National%20Rail">National Rail</a> network, making the British network the <a href="List%20of%20countries%20by%20rail%20usage">fifth most used in the world</a> (Great Britain ranks 23rd in world population). Unlike a number of other countries, rail travel in the United Kingdom has enjoyed a renaissance in recent years, with passenger numbers reaching their highest ever level (see usage figures below). This has coincided with the <a href="privatisation%20of%20British%20Rail">privatisation of British Rail</a>, but the <a href="Impact%20of%20the%20privatisation%20of%20British%20Rail">effect of this is disputed</a>. The growth is partly attributed to a shift away from private motoring due to growing road congestion and increasing petrol prices, but also to the overall increase in travel due to affluence. However passenger journeys have grown much more quickly than in comparable countries such as France and Germany.

To cope with increasing passenger numbers, there is a large ongoing <a href="History%20of%20rail%20transport%20in%20Great%20Britain%201995%20to%20date%23Timeline%20of%20improvements">programme of upgrades</a> to the network, including <a href="Thameslink%20Programme">Thameslink</a>, <a href="Crossrail">Crossrail</a>, <a href="Railway%20electrification%20in%20Great%20Britain">electrification of lines</a>, <a href="European%20Rail%20Traffic%20Management%20System%20in%20Great%20Britain">in-cab signalling</a>, new <a href="Intercity%20Express%20Programme">inter-city trains</a> and a new <a href="HS2">high-speed line</a>.

The early railways were a patchwork of local lines operated by small private railway companies. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained (see <a href="railway%20mania">railway mania</a>). The entire network was brought under government control during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were revealed. However, the government resisted calls for the <a href="nationalisation">nationalisation</a> of the network (first proposed by 19th century <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a> as early as the 1830s). Instead, from 1 January 1923, almost all the remaining companies were <a href="Railways%20Act%201921">grouped</a> into the "big four": the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a>, the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a>, the <a href="London%2C%20Midland%20and%20Scottish%20Railway">London, Midland and Scottish Railway</a> and the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28UK%29">Southern Railway</a> companies (there were also a number of other <a href="joint%20railway">joint railway</a>s such as the <a href="Midland%20and%20Great%20Northern%20Joint%20Railway">Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway</a> and the <a href="Cheshire%20Lines%20Committee">Cheshire Lines Committee</a> as well as special joint railways such as the <a href="Forth%20Bridge">Forth Bridge</a> Railway, <a href="Ryde%20Pier">Ryde Pier</a> Railway and at one time the <a href="East%20London%20Railway">East London Railway</a>). The "Big Four" were joint-stock public companies and they continued to run the railway system until 31 December 1947.

The growth in road transport during the 1920s and 1930s greatly reduced revenue for the rail companies. Rail companies accused the government of favouring road haulage through the subsidised construction of roads. The railways entered a slow decline owing to a lack of investment and changes in transport policy and lifestyles. During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> the companies' managements joined together, effectively forming one company. A maintenance backlog developed during the war and the private sector only had two years to deal with this after the war ended. After 1945, for both practical and ideological reasons, the government decided to bring the rail service into the <a href="public%20sector">public sector</a>.

From the start of 1948, the "big four" were <a href="nationalised">nationalised</a> to form <a href="British%20Railways">British Railways</a> (latterly "British Rail") under the control of the <a href="British%20Transport%20Commission">British Transport Commission</a>. Although BR was a single entity, it was divided into six (later five) regional authorities in accordance with the existing areas of operation. Though there were few initial changes to the service, usage increased and the network became profitable. Regeneration of track and railway stations was completed by 1954. In the same year, changes to the British Transport Commission, including the privatisation of road haulage, ended the coordination of transport in Great Britain. Rail revenue fell and in 1955 the network again ceased to be profitable. The mid-1950s saw the rapid introduction of diesel and electric rolling stock, but the expected transfer back from road to rail did not occur and losses began to mount.

The desire for profitability led to a major reduction in the network during the mid-1960s, with <a href="Imperial%20Chemical%20Industries">ICI</a> manager Dr. <a href="Richard%20Beeching">Richard Beeching</a> commissioned by the government under <a href="Ernest%20Marples">Ernest Marples</a> with reorganising the railways. Many branch lines (and a number of main lines) were closed because they were deemed uneconomic ("the <a href="Beeching%20Axe">Beeching Axe</a>" of 1963), removing much feeder traffic from main line passenger services. In the second Beeching report of 1965, only the "major trunk routes" were selected for large-scale investment, leading many to speculate the rest of the network would eventually be closed. This was never implemented by BR.

Passenger services experienced a renaissance with the introduction of the <a href="InterCity%20125">InterCity 125</a> trains in the 1970s. Passenger levels fluctuated since then, increasing during periods of economic growth and falling during recessions. The 1980s saw severe cuts in government funding and above-<a href="inflation">inflation</a> increases in fares, and the service became more cost-effective. In the early 1990s, the five geographical Regions were replaced by a Sectored organisation, in which passenger services were organised into <a href="InterCity%20%28British%20Rail%29">InterCity</a>, <a href="Network%20SouthEast">Network SouthEast</a> and <a href="Regional%20Railways">Regional Railways</a> sectors.

<a href="Privatisation%20of%20British%20Rail">British Rail operations were privatised</a> during 1994–1997. Ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to <a href="Railtrack">Railtrack</a>, whilst passenger operations were franchised to individual private sector operators (originally there were 25 franchises) and the goods services sold outright (six companies were set up, but five of these were sold to the same buyer). The government said privatisation would see an improvement in passenger services and satisfaction (according to the National Rail Passenger survey) has indeed gone up from 76% in 1999 (when the survey started) to 83% in 2013 and the number of passengers not satisfied with their journey dropped from 10% to 6%. Since privatisation, passenger levels have more than doubled, and have surpassed their level in the late 1940s. Train fares cost 2.7% more than under British Rail in real terms on average. However, while the price of anytime and off-peak tickets has increased, the price of Advance tickets has dramatically decreased in real terms: the average Advance ticket in 1995 cost £9.14 (in 2014 prices) compared to £5.17 in 2014.
<a href="Rail%20subsidies">Rail subsidies</a> have increased from £bn in 1992-93 to £bn in 2015-16 (in current prices), although subsidy per journey has fallen from £ per journey to £ per journey. However, this masks great regional variation, as in 2014-15 funding varied from "£1.41 per passenger journey in England to £6.51 per journey in Scotland and £8.34 per journey in Wales."
The public image of rail travel was severely damaged by a series of significant accidents after privatisation. These included the <a href="Hatfield%20rail%20crash">Hatfield accident</a>, caused by a rail fragmenting due to the development of microscopic cracks. Following this, the rail infrastructure company Railtrack imposed over 1,200 emergency speed restrictions across its network and instigated an extremely costly nationwide track replacement programme. The consequent severe operational disruption to the national network and the company's spiralling costs set in motion a series of events which resulted in the collapse of the company and its replacement with <a href="Network%20Rail">Network Rail</a>, a state-owned, not-for-profit company. According to the <a href="European%20Railway%20Agency">European Railway Agency</a>, in 2013 Britain had the safest railways in Europe based on the number of train safety incidents.

At the end of September 2003, the first part of <a href="High%20Speed%201">High Speed 1</a>, a high-speed link to the <a href="Channel%20Tunnel">Channel Tunnel</a> and onward to <a href="France">France</a> and <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, was completed, significantly adding to the rail infrastructure of the country. The rest of the link, from north Kent to <a href="St%20Pancras%20railway%20station">St Pancras railway station</a> in London, opened in 2007. A major programme of remedial work on the <a href="West%20Coast%20Main%20Line">West Coast Main Line</a> started in 1997 and finished in 2009.

In the 2010s, many upgrades are under way, such as the <a href="Thameslink%20Programme">Thameslink Programme</a>, <a href="Crossrail">Crossrail</a>, the <a href="Northern%20Hub">Northern Hub</a> and electrification of the <a href="Great%20Western%20Main%20Line">Great Western Main Line</a>. Electrification plans for the <a href="Midland%20Main%20Line">Midland Main Line</a> and the cross-Pennine line between Manchester and Leeds have been paused with the start of work on these projects postponed to some indefinite date(s)in the 2020s. Planning for <a href="HS2">High Speed 2</a> is underway, with a projected completion date of 2026 for Phase 1 (London to Birmingham) and 2033 for Phase 2.

Passenger services in Great Britain are divided into regional franchises and run by private (that is, non-state owned) <a href="train%20operating%20company">train operating companies</a>. These companies bid for seven- to eight-year contracts to run individual franchises. Most contracts are awarded by the <a href="Department%20for%20Transport">Department for Transport</a> (DfT), with the exception of <a href="Merseyrail">Merseyrail</a>, where the franchise is awarded by <a href="Merseyside%20Passenger%20Transport%20Executive">Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive</a>, and <a href="ScotRail%20%28brand%29">ScotRail</a>, where the DfT awards on the advice of the <a href="Scottish%20Government">Scottish Government</a>. Initially, there were 25 franchises, but the number of different operating companies is smaller as some firms, including <a href="FirstGroup">FirstGroup</a> and <a href="Stagecoach%20Group">Stagecoach Group</a>, run more than one franchise. In addition, some franchises have since been combined. There are also a number of local or specialised rail services operated on an 'open access' basis outside the franchise arrangements. Examples include <a href="Heathrow%20Express">Heathrow Express</a> and <a href="Hull%20Trains">Hull Trains</a>.

In the 2015–16 operating year, franchised services provided 1,718 million journeys totalling (64.7 billion billion passenger km) of travel, an increase over 1994–5 of 117% in journeys (from 761 million) and just over doubling the passenger miles. The passenger-miles figure, after being flat from 1965 to 1995, surpassed the 1947 figure for the first time in 1998 and continues to rise steeply.

The key index used to assess passenger train performance is the <a href="Public%20Performance%20Measure">Public Performance Measure</a>, which combines figures for punctuality and reliability. From a base of 90% of trains arriving on time in 1998, the measure dipped to 75% in mid-2001 due to stringent safety restrictions put in place after the <a href="Hatfield%20rail%20crash">Hatfield crash</a> in October 2000. However, in June 2015 the PPM stood at 91.2% after a period of steady increases in the annual moving average since 2003 until around 2012 when the improvements levelled off.

Train fares cost 2.7% more than under <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a> in real terms on average. For some years, Britain has been said to have the highest rail fares in Europe, with peak-time and season tickets considerably higher than other countries, partly because <a href="rail%20transport%20in%20Europe%23Subsidies">rail subsidies in Europe</a> are higher. However, they are also able to obtain some of the cheapest fares in Europe if they book in advance or travel at off-peak times.

UK rail operators point out rail fare increases have been at a substantially lower rate than petrol prices for private motoring. The difference in price has also been blamed on the fact Britain has the most restrictive <a href="loading%20gauge">loading gauge</a> (maximum width and height of trains that can fit through tunnels, bridges etc.) in the world which means any trains must be significantly narrower and less tall than those used elsewhere. This means British trains cannot be bought "off-the-shelf" and must be specially built to fit British standards.

Average rolling-stock age fell slightly from the third quarter of 2001–2 to the fourth quarter of 2013–4, from 20.7 years old to 19.4 years old.

Although passengers rarely have cause to refer to either document, all travel is subject to the <a href="National%20Rail%20Conditions%20of%20Carriage">National Rail Conditions of Carriage</a> and all tickets are valid subject to the rules set out in a number of so-called <a href="UK%20railway%20technical%20manuals">technical manuals</a>, which are centrally produced for the network.

Below are the total number of passengers using heavy rail transport in Britain. The numbers are calculated from September to August. (This table does not include Eurostar, Heathrow Express, Heathrow Connect or "<a href="open%20access%20operator">open access operator</a>s" such as <a href="Grand%20Central%20Railway">Grand Central</a> and <a href="Hull%20Trains">Hull Trains</a>)
The following table is according to the Office of Rail and Road and includes "<a href="open%20access%20operator">open access operator</a>s" such as <a href="Grand%20Central%20Railway">Grand Central</a> and <a href="Hull%20Trains">Hull Trains</a>.

There are 2,563 passenger <a href="railway%20station">railway station</a>s on the Network Rail network. This does not include the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>, nor other systems which are not part of the national network, such as heritage railways. Most date from the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> and a number are in or on the edge of <a href="town%20centre">town</a> and <a href="city%20centre">city centre</a>s. Major stations lie for the most part in large cities, with the largest conurbations (e.g. Liverpool, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Manchester) typically having more than one main station. London is a major hub of the network, with 12 main-line termini forming a "ring" around <a href="central%20London">central London</a>. Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Glasgow, Bristol and <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a> are major interchanges for many cross-country journeys that do not involve London. However, some important railway junction stations lie in smaller cities and towns, for example <a href="York%20railway%20station">York</a>, <a href="Crewe%20railway%20station">Crewe</a> and <a href="Ely%20railway%20station">Ely</a>. Some other places expanded into towns and cities because of the railway network. <a href="Swindon">Swindon</a>, for example, was little more than a village before the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> chose to site its locomotive works there. In many instances geography, politics or military considerations originally caused stations to be sited further from the towns they served until, with time, these issues could be overcome (for example, <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> had its original station at <a href="Gosport">Gosport</a>).

High-speed rail (above ) was first introduced in Great Britain in the 1970s by British Rail. BR had pursued two development projects in parallel, the development of a <a href="tilting%20train">tilting train</a> technology, the '<a href="Advanced%20Passenger%20Train">Advanced Passenger Train</a>' (APT), and development of a conventional high-speed diesel train, the 'High Speed Train' (HST). The APT project was abandoned, but the HST design entered service as the <a href="British%20Rail%20Classes%20253%2C%20254%20and%20255">British Rail Classes 253, 254 and 255</a> trains. The prototype HST, the <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%20252">British Rail Class 252</a>, reached a world speed record for diesel trains of 143.2 mph, while the main fleet entered service limited to a service speed of 125 mph, and were introduced progressively on main lines across the country, with a rebranding of their services as the "<a href="InterCity%20125">InterCity 125</a>". With electrification of the <a href="East%20Coast%20Main%20Line">East Coast Main Line</a>, high-speed rail in Great Britain was augmented with the introduction of the <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%2091">British Rail Class 91</a>, intended for passenger service at up to 140 mph (225 km/h), and thus branded as the "<a href="InterCity%20225">InterCity 225</a>". The Class 91 units were designed for a maximum service speed of 140 mph, and running at this speed was trialled with a 'flashing green' signal aspect under the <a href="UK%20railway%20signalling">British signalling system</a>. The trains were eventually limited to the same speed as the HST, to 125 mph, with higher speeds deemed to require <a href="cab%20signalling">cab signalling</a>, which as of 2010 was not in place on the normal British railway network (but was used on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link). A final attempt by the nationalised British Rail at High Speed Rail was the cancelled <a href="InterCity%20250">InterCity 250</a> project in the 1990s for the West Coast Main Line.

Post privatisation, a plan to upgrade the <a href="West%20Coast%20Main%20Line">West Coast Main Line</a> to speeds of up to 140 mph with infrastructure improvements were finally abandoned, although the tilting train <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%20390">Class 390</a> "Pendolino" fleet designed for this maximum speed of service were still built and entered service in 2002, and operates limited to 125 mph. Other routes in the UK were upgraded with trains capable of top speeds of up to 125 mph running with the introduction between 2000 and 2005 of <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%20180">Class 180</a> "Adelante" DMUs and the <a href="Bombardier%20Voyager%20family">Bombardier Voyager family</a> of DEMUs (Classes 220, 221 and 222).

The first implementation of high-speed rail up to 186 mph in regular passenger service in Great Britain was the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (now known as High Speed 1), when its first phase opened in 2003 linking the British end of the <a href="Channel%20Tunnel">Channel Tunnel</a> at Folkestone with <a href="Fawkham%20Junction">Fawkham Junction</a> in Kent. This is used by international only passenger trains for the <a href="Eurostar">Eurostar</a> service, using <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%20373">British Rail Class 373</a> trains. The line was later extended all the way into <a href="London%20St%20Pancras">London St Pancras</a> in 2007.

After the building of the first of a new <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%20395">British Rail Class 395</a> train fleet for use partly on High Speed 1 and parts of the rest of the UK rail network, the first domestic high-speed running over 125 mph (to about 140 mph) began in December 2009, including a special Olympic Javelin shuttle for the <a href="2012%20Olympics">2012 Olympics</a>. These services are operated by the <a href="Southeastern%20%28train%20operating%20company%29">Southeastern</a> franchise.

For replacement of the domestic fleet of Intercity 125 and 225 trains on the existing national network, the Intercity Express Programme was announced. In 2009 it was announced the preferred rolling stock option for this project was the <a href="Hitachi%20Super%20Express">Hitachi Super Express</a> family of multiple units, and they are expected to enter service from 2017 on the Great Western Main Line and 2018 on the East Coast Main Line. The trains will be capable of a maximum speed of 140 mph with "minor modifications", with the necessary signalling modifications required of the <a href="Network%20Rail">Network Rail</a> infrastructure in Britain likely to come from the phased roll out of the Europe-wide <a href="European%20Rail%20Traffic%20Management%20System">European Rail Traffic Management System</a> (ERTMS).

Following several studies and consultations on high-speed rail, in 2009 the UK Government formally announced the <a href="High%20Speed%202">High Speed 2</a> project, establishing a company to produce a feasibility study to examine route options and financing for a new high-speed railway in the UK. This study began on the assumption the route would be a new purpose-built high-speed line, from London to the <a href="West%20Midlands%20%28region%29">West Midlands</a>, via <a href="London%20Heathrow">London Heathrow</a>, relieving traffic on the <a href="West%20Coast%20Main%20Line">West Coast Main Line</a>, and would use conventional high-speed rail technology as opposed to <a href="Maglev%20%28transport%29">Maglev</a>. The rolling stock would be capable of travelling on the existing <a href="Network%20Rail">Network Rail</a> infrastructure if required, and the route will intersect with the existing West Coast Main Line (WCML). A second phase of the project is planned to reach further north to Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds, as well as linking into the WCML, the <a href="Midland%20Main%20Line">Midland Main Line</a> and the <a href="East%20Coast%20Main%20Line">East Coast Main Line</a>.

In June 2014, <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, <a href="George%20Osborne">George Osborne</a> proposed a high-speed rail link <a href="High%20Speed%203">High Speed 3</a> (HS3) between Liverpool and Newcastle/Sheffield/Hull. The line would utilise the existing route between Liverpool and Newcastle/Hull and a new route from to Sheffield will follow the same route to Manchester Victoria and then a new line from Victoria to Sheffield, with additional tunnels and other infrastructure.

In August 2009 the speeds of the fastest trains operating in Great Britain capable of a top speed of over 125 mph were as follows:

In 2011 the fastest timetabled start-to-stop run by a UK domestic train service was the Hull Trains 07.30 King's Cross to Hull, which covered the 125.4 km (78 miles) from Stevenage to Grantham in 42 minutes at an average speed of 179.1 km/h (111.4 mph). This is operated by a <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%20180">Class 180</a> diesel unit running "under the wires" on this East Coast route. This was matched by several Leeds to London <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%2091">Class 91</a>-operated <a href="East%20Coast%20%28train%20operating%20company%29">East Coast</a> trains if their two-minute recovery allowance for this section is excluded from the public timetable.

A number of towns and cities have <a href="rapid%20transit">rapid transit</a> systems. Heavy rail underground technology is used in the <a href="London%20Underground">London</a> and <a href="Glasgow%20subway">Glasgow</a> Underground systems. Light and heavy rail with underground sections in the city centre exist in <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> on the <a href="Tyne%20and%20Wear%20Metro">Tyne and Wear Metro</a>, <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> on the <a href="Merseyrail">Merseyrail</a> system, and in the <a href="Docklands%20Light%20Railway">London Docklands</a>. The light rail systems in <a href="Nottingham%20Express%20Transit">Nottingham</a>, <a href="Sheffield%20Supertram">Sheffield</a>, <a href="Manchester%20Metrolink">Manchester</a>, <a href="Tramlink">Croydon</a>, <a href="Midland%20Metro">Birmingham/Black Country</a> and <a href="Edinburgh%20Trams">Edinburgh</a> use a combination of street running in the city centres and, where available, reserved right of way or former conventional rail lines in some suburbs. <a href="Blackpool%20tramway">Blackpool</a> has the one remaining traditional tram system. Monorails, heritage tramways, miniature railways and funiculars also exist in several places. In addition, there are a number of heritage (mainly steam) standard and narrow gauge railways, and a few industrial railways and tramways. Some lines which appear to be heritage operations sometimes claim to be part of the public transport network; the <a href="Romney%2C%20Hythe%20and%20Dymchurch%20Railway">Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway</a> in Kent regularly transports schoolchildren.

Most major cities have some form of <a href="Commuter%20rail%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">commuter rail network</a>. These include <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a>, <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>, <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>, Liverpool, London, <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> and <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>.

There are four main <a href="Freight%20rail%20transport">goods</a> operating companies in the UK, the largest of which is <a href="DB%20Cargo%20UK">DB Cargo UK</a> (formerly DB Schenker formerly English Welsh & Scottish (EWS)). There are also several smaller independent operators including <a href="Mendip%20Rail">Mendip Rail</a>. Types of freight carried include "<a href="intermodal%20freight%20transport">intermodal</a>" — in essence containerised freight — and coal, metals, oil, and construction material. The Beeching Cuts, in contrast to passenger services, greatly modernised the goods sector, replacing inefficient wagons with containerised regional hubs. Freight services had been in steady decline since the 1930s, initially because of the loss of manufacturing and then road haulage's cost advantage in combination with higher wages. Since 1995, however, the amount of <a href="freight">freight</a> carried on the railways has increased sharply due to increased reliability and competition, as well as international services. The <a href="Department%20for%20Transport">Department for Transport</a>'s "Transport Ten Year Plan" calls for an 80% increase in rail freight measured from a 2000–1 base.

Statistics on freight are specified in terms of the weight of freight lifted, and the "net tonne kilometre", being freight weight multiplied by distance carried. 116.6 million tonnes of freight was lifted in the 2013–4 period, against 138 million tonnes in 1986–7, a decrease of 16%. However, a record 22.7 billion net tonne kilometres (14 billion net ton miles) of freight movement were recorded in 2013-4, against 16.6 billion (10.1 billion) in 1986–7, an increase of 38%. Coal makes up 36% of the total "net tonne kilometre", though its share is declining. Rail freight has increased its market share since privatisation (by net tonne kilometres) from 7.4% in 1998 to 11.1% in 2013. Recent growth is partly due to more international services including the Channel Tunnel and <a href="Port%20of%20Felixstowe">Port of Felixstowe</a>, which is containerised. Nevertheless, network bottlenecks and insufficient investment in catering for 9' 6" high shipping containers restrict growth.

A symbolic loss to the rail freight industry in Great Britain was the custom of the <a href="Royal%20Mail">Royal Mail</a>, which from 2004 discontinued use of its 49-train fleet, and switching to road haulage after a near 170-year-preference for trains. <a href="Travelling%20Post%20Office">Mail trains</a> had long been part of the tradition of the railways in Great Britain, famously celebrated in the film "<a href="Night%20Mail">Night Mail</a>", for which <a href="W.%20H.%20Auden">W. H. Auden</a> wrote the poem of the same name. Although Royal Mail suspended the <a href="Travelling%20Post%20Office">Mail train</a> in January 2004, this decision was reversed in December of the same year, and <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%20325">Class 325s</a> are now used on some routes including between London, Warrington and Scotland.

At the time of privatisation, the rolling stock of <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a> was sold to the new operators, as in the case of the freight companies, or to the three ROSCOs (<a href="rolling%20stock%20operating%20company">rolling stock operating companies</a>) which lease or hire stock to passenger and freight train operators. Leasing is relatively commonplace in transport, since it enables operating companies to avoid the complication associated with raising sufficient capital to purchase assets; instead, assets are leased and paid for from ongoing revenue. Since 1994 there has been a growth in smaller spot-hire companies that provide rolling stock on short-term contracts. Many of these have grown thanks to the major selling-off of locomotives by the large freight operators, especially EWS.

Unlike other major players in the privatised railway system of Great Britain, the ROSCOs are not subject to close regulation by the economic regulatory authority. They were expected to compete with one another, and they do, although not in all respects.

Since privatisation in 1995, the ROSCOs have faced criticism from several quarters - including passenger train operating companies such as GNER, Arriva and FirstGroup - on the basis they are acting as an <a href="oligopoly">oligopoly</a> to keep lease prices higher than they would be in a competitive market. In 1998, <a href="Deputy%20Prime%20Minister">Deputy Prime Minister</a> <a href="John%20Prescott">John Prescott</a> asked <a href="Rail%20Regulator">Rail Regulator</a> <a href="John%20Swift%20QC">John Swift QC</a> to investigate the market's operation and make recommendations. Many believed Prescott favoured much closer regulation of the ROSCOs, perhaps bringing them into the net of contract-specific regulation, i.e., requiring every rolling stock lease to be approved by the Rail Regulator before it could be valid. Swift's report did not find major problems with the operation of what was then an infant market, and instead recommended the ROSCOs sign up to voluntary, non-binding codes of practice in relation to their future behaviour. Prescott did not like this, but he did not have the legislative time allocation to do much about it. Swift's successor as Rail Regulator, <a href="Tom%20Winsor">Tom Winsor</a>, agreed with Swift and the ROSCOs were happy to go along with codes of practice, coupled with the Rail Regulator's new powers to deal with abuse of dominance and anti-competitive behaviour under the <a href="Competition%20Act%201998">Competition Act 1998</a>. In establishing these codes, the Rail Regulator made it clear he expected the ROSCOs to adhere to their letter and spirit. The codes of practice were duly put in place and for the next five years the Rail Regulator received no complaints about ROSCO behaviour.

In July 2004, the Department for Transport's White Paper on the future of the railways contained a statement it was dissatisfied with the operation of the rolling stock leasing market and believed there may have been excessive pricing on the part of the ROSCOs.

In June 2006, <a href="Gwyneth%20Dunwoody">Gwyneth Dunwoody</a>, the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> <a href="Transport%20Committee">Transport Committee</a> chair, called for an investigation into the companies. Transport commentator <a href="Christian%20Wolmar">Christian Wolmar</a> has asserted the high cost of leasing is due to the way the franchises are distributed to the train operating companies. While the TOCs are negotiating for a franchise they have some freedom to propose different rolling stock options. It is only once they have won the franchise, however, they start negotiating with the ROSCOs. The ROSCO will know the TOC's requirements and also knows the TOC has to obtain a fixed mix of rolling stock which puts the train operating company at a disadvantage in its negotiations with the ROSCO. However, Wolmar considers it a mistake to blame the ROSCOs who are simply behaving as commercial companies always behave. Ultimately the problem for Wolmar is the system – and that is down to the government, who he believes are not prepared to seek a more workable solution.

On 29 November 2006, following a June 2006 complaint by the <a href="Department%20for%20Transport">Department for Transport</a> alleging excessive pricing by the ROSCOs, the <a href="Office%20of%20Rail%20and%20Road">Office of Rail Regulation</a> (as it was then called) announced it was minded to refer the operation of the market for passenger rolling stock to the <a href="Competition%20Commission">Competition Commission</a>, citing, amongst other factors, problems in the DfT's own franchising policy as responsible for what may be regarded as a dysfunctional market. ORR said it will consult the industry and the public on what to do, and will publish its decision in April 2007. If the ORR does refer the market to the Competition Commission, there may well be a hiatus in investment in new rolling stock whilst the ROSCOs and their parent companies wait to hear what return they will be allowed to make on their train fleets. This could have the <a href="unintended%20consequence">unintended consequence</a> of intensifying the problem of overcrowding on some routes because TOCs will be unable to lengthen their trains or acquire new ones if they need the ROSCOs to co-operate in their acquisition or financing. Some commentators have suggested that such an outcome would be detrimental to the public interest. This is especially striking since the <a href="National%20Audit%20Office%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Audit Office</a>, in its November 2006 report on the renewal and upgrade of the <a href="West%20Coast%20main%20line">West Coast main line</a>, said that the capacity of the trains and the network will be full in the next few years and advocated train lengthening as an important measure to cope with sharply higher passenger numbers.

The Competition Commission conducted an investigation and published provisional findings on 7 August 2008. The report was published on 7 April 2009. A press release


Three companies took over <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a>'s rolling stock on privatisation:

A number of other companies have since entered the leasing market:

Spot-hire companies provide short-term leasing of rolling stock.

Railways in Great Britain are in the private sector, but they are subject to control by central government, and to economic and safety regulation by arms of government.

In 2006, using powers in the <a href="Railways%20Act%202005">Railways Act 2005</a>, the <a href="Department%20for%20Transport">Department for Transport</a> took over most of the functions of the now wound up <a href="Strategic%20Rail%20Authority">Strategic Rail Authority</a>. The DfT now itself runs competitions for the award of passenger rail franchises, and, once awarded, monitors and enforces the contracts with the private sector franchisees. Franchises specify the passenger rail services which are to be run and the quality and other conditions (for example, the cleanliness of trains, station facilities and opening hours, the punctuality and reliability of trains) which the operators have to meet. Some franchises receive a subsidy from the DfT for doing so, and some are cash-positive, which means the franchisee pays the DfT for the contract. Some franchises start life as subsidised and, over their life, move to being cash-positive.

The other regulatory authority for the privatised railway is the <a href="Office%20of%20Rail%20and%20Road">Office of Rail and Road</a> (previously the Office of Rail Regulation), which, following the Railways Act 2005, is the combined economic and safety regulator. It replaced the <a href="Rail%20Regulator">Rail Regulator</a> on 5 July 2004. The <a href="Rail%20Safety%20and%20Standards%20Board">Rail Safety and Standards Board</a> still exists, however; established in 2003 on the recommendations of a public inquiry, it leads the industry's progress in health and safety matters.

The principal modern railway statutes are:





The railways are one of the most heavily unionised industrial sectors in the UK.

This is only the earliest of the main line openings: for a more comprehensive list of the hundreds of early railways see <a href="List%20of%20early%20British%20railway%20companies">List of early British railway companies</a>

Many lines closed by British Railways, including many closed during the <a href="Beeching%20cuts">Beeching cuts</a>, have been restored and reopened as <a href="heritage%20railway">heritage railway</a>s. A few have been relaid as narrow-gauge but the majority are standard-gauge. Most use both steam and diesel locomotives for haulage. Most heritage railways are operated as tourist attractions and do not provide regular year-round train services.

Several pressure groups are campaigning for the re-opening of closed railway lines in Great Britain. These include:


From 1995 until 2009, 27 new lines (totalling 199 track miles) and 68 stations were opened, with 65 further new station sites identified by <a href="Network%20Rail">Network Rail</a> or government for possible construction.
On 15 June 2009 the <a href="Association%20of%20Train%20Operating%20Companies">Association of Train Operating Companies</a> (ATOC) published the report "", detailing schemes around England where it believed there was a commercial business case for passenger network expansion. The published proposals involved the re-opening or new construction of 40 stations, serving communities with populations of over 15,000, including 14 schemes involving the re-opening or reconstruction of rail lines for passenger services. These would be short-lead-time local projects, to be completed in timescales ranging from 2 years 9 months to 6 years, once approved by <a href="Local%20government%20in%20England">local</a> and <a href="Regions%20of%20England">regional</a> governments, Network Rail and the <a href="Department%20for%20Transport">Department for Transport</a>, complementing existing long-term national projects.

British Rail

British Railways (BR), which from 1965 traded as British Rail, was the state-owned company that operated most of the <a href="rail%20transport%20in%20Great%20Britain">rail transport in Great Britain</a> between 1948 and 1997. It was formed from the <a href="nationalisation">nationalisation</a> of the <a href="Big%20Four%20%28British%20railway%20companies%29">"Big Four" British railway companies</a> and lasted until the gradual <a href="privatisation%20of%20British%20Rail">privatisation of British Rail</a>, in stages between 1994 and 1997. Originally a trading brand of the Railway Executive of the <a href="British%20Transport%20Commission">British Transport Commission</a>, it became an independent <a href="statutory%20corporation">statutory corporation</a> in 1962 designated as the <a href="British%20Railways%20Board">British Railways Board</a>.

The period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes in the national railway network. A process of <a href="dieselisation">dieselisation</a> and <a href="Railway%20electrification%20in%20Great%20Britain">electrification</a> took place, and by 1968 steam locomotion had been entirely replaced by diesel and electric traction, except for one narrow-gauge tourist line. <a href="Passenger%20train">Passengers</a> replaced <a href="freight%20train">freight</a> as the main source of business, and one-third of the network was closed by the <a href="Beeching%20Axe">Beeching Axe</a> of the 1960s in an effort to reduce <a href="rail%20subsidies">rail subsidies</a>.

On privatisation, responsibility for track, signalling and stations was transferred to <a href="Railtrack">Railtrack</a> (which was later brought under public control as <a href="Network%20Rail">Network Rail</a>) and that for trains to the <a href="train%20operating%20companies">train operating companies</a>.

The British Rail "double arrow" logo is formed of two interlocked arrows showing the direction of travel on a <a href="double%20track">double track</a> railway and was nicknamed "the arrow of indecision". It is now employed as a generic symbol on street signs in Great Britain denoting railway stations, and as part of the <a href="Rail%20Delivery%20Group">Rail Delivery Group</a>'s (RDG) jointly-managed <a href="National%20Rail">National Rail</a> brand is still being printed on railway tickets.

The rail transport system in Great Britain developed during the 19th century. After the grouping of 1923 under the <a href="Railways%20Act%201921">Railways Act 1921</a>, there were four large railway companies, each dominating its own geographic area: the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> (GWR), the <a href="London%2C%20Midland%20and%20Scottish%20Railway">London, Midland and Scottish Railway</a> (LMS), the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a> (LNER) and the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28UK%29">Southern Railway</a> (SR). During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> the railways were under state control, which continued until 1921. Complete <a href="nationalisation">nationalisation</a> had been considered, and the <a href="Railways%20Act%201921">Railways Act 1921</a> is sometimes considered as a precursor to that, but the concept was rejected. Nationalisation was subsequently carried out after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, under the <a href="Transport%20Act%201947">Transport Act 1947</a>. This Act made provision for the nationalisation of the network, as part of a policy of nationalising public services by <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a>'s <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> Government. British Railways came into existence as the <a href="business%20name">business name</a> of the <a href="Railway%20Executive">Railway Executive</a> of the <a href="British%20Transport%20Commission">British Transport Commission</a> (BTC) on 1 January 1948 when it took over the assets of the Big Four.

There were also <a href="joint%20railway">joint railway</a>s between the Big Four and a few light railways to consider (see <a href="list%20of%20constituents%20of%20British%20Railways">list of constituents of British Railways</a>). Excluded from nationalisation were industrial lines like the <a href="Oxfordshire%20Ironstone%20Railway">Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway</a>. The <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> – publicly owned since 1933 – was also nationalised, becoming the <a href="London%20Transport%20Executive">London Transport Executive</a> of the British Transport Commission. The <a href="Bicester%20Military%20Railway">Bicester Military Railway</a> was already run by the government. The electric <a href="Liverpool%20Overhead%20Railway">Liverpool Overhead Railway</a> was also excluded from nationalisation. 

The Railway Executive was conscious that some lines on the (then very dense) network were unprofitable and hard to justify socially, and a programme of closures began almost immediately after nationalisation. However, the general financial position of BR became gradually poorer, until an operating loss was recorded in 1955. The Executive itself had been abolished in 1953 by the Conservative government, and control of BR transferred to the parent Commission. Other changes to the British Transport Commission at the same time included the return of road haulage to the private sector.

British Railways was divided into regions which were initially based on the areas the former Big Four operated in; later, several lines were transferred between regions. Notably, these included the former <a href="Great%20Central%20Railway">Great Central</a> lines from the Eastern Region to the London Midland Region, and the <a href="West%20of%20England%20Main%20Line">West of England Main Line</a> from the Southern Region to Western Region

The North Eastern Region was merged with the Eastern Region in 1967. In the 1980s, the regions were abolished and replaced by "business sectors", a process known as <a href="sectorisation">sectorisation</a>.

The Anglia Region was created in late 1987, its first General Manager being John Edmonds, who began his appointment on 19 October 1987. Full separation from the Eastern Region – apart from engineering design needs – occurred on 29 April 1988. It handled the services from and , its western boundary being , and .

The report, latterly known as the "Modernisation Plan", was published in January 1955. It was intended to bring the railway system into the 20th century. A government <a href="White%20Paper">White Paper</a> produced in 1956 stated that modernisation would help eliminate BR's financial deficit by 1962, but the figures in both this and the original plan were produced for political reasons and not based on detailed analysis. The aim was to increase speed, reliability, safety, and line capacity through a series of measures that would make services more attractive to passengers and freight operators, thus recovering traffic lost to the roads. Important areas included:

The government appeared to endorse the 1955 programme (costing £1.2 billion), but did so largely for political reasons. This included the withdrawal of steam traction and its replacement by diesel (and some electric) locomotives. Not all the modernisations would be effective at reducing costs. The dieselisation programme gave contracts primarily to British suppliers, who had limited experience of diesel locomotive manufacture, and rushed commissioning based on an expectation of rapid electrification resulted in numbers of locomotives with poor designs, and a lack of standardisation. At the same time containerised freight was being developed. The marshalling yard building programme was a failure, being based on a belief in the continued viability of wagon load traffic in the face of increasingly effective road competition, and lacking effective forward planning or realistic assessments of future freight.

During the late 1950s, railway finances continued to worsen, whilst passenger numbers grew after restoring many services reduced during the war, and in 1959 the government stepped in, limiting the amount the BTC could spend without ministerial authority. A White Paper proposing reorganisation was published in the following year, and a new structure was brought into effect by the Transport Act 1962. This abolished the Commission and replaced it by several separate Boards. These included a British Railways Board, which took over on 1 January 1963. 
Following semi-secret discussions on railway finances by the government-appointed Stedeford Committee in 1961, one of its members, <a href="Richard%20Beeching%2C%20Baron%20Beeching">Dr Richard Beeching</a>, was offered the post of chairing the BTC while it lasted, and then becoming the first Chairman of the British Railways Board.

A major traffic census in April 1961, which lasted one week, was used in the compilation of a report on the future of the network. This report—"The Reshaping of British Railways"—was published by the BRB in March 1963. The proposals, which became known as the "<a href="Beeching%20Axe">Beeching Axe</a>", were dramatic. A third of all passenger services and more than 4,000 of the 7,000 stations would close. Beeching, who is thought to have been the author of most of the report, set out some dire figures. One-third of the network was carrying just 1% of the traffic. Of the 18,000 passenger coaches, 6,000 were said to be used only 18 times a year or less. Although maintaining them cost between £3m and £4m a year, they earned only about £0.5m.

Most of the closures were carried out between 1963 and 1970 (including some which were not listed in the report) while other suggested closures were not carried out. The closures were heavily criticised at the time, and continue to be controversial. A small number of stations and lines closed under the Beeching programme have been reopened, with further reopenings proposed.

A second Beeching report, "The Development of the Major Trunk Routes", followed in 1965. This did not recommend closures as such, but outlined a "network for development". The fate of the rest of the network was not discussed in the report.

The basis for calculating passenger fares changed in 1964. In future, fares on some routes—such as rural, holiday and commuter services—would be set at a higher level than on other routes; previously, fares had been calculated using a simple rate for the distance travelled, which at the time was 3d per mile second class, and 4½d per mile first class (equivalent to £ and £ respectively, in ).

Passenger levels decreased steadily from 1962 to the late 1970s,and reached a low in 1982. Network improvements included completing electrification of the <a href="Great%20Eastern%20Main%20Line">Great Eastern Main Line</a> from London to Norwich between 1976 and 1986 and the <a href="East%20Coast%20Main%20Line">East Coast Main Line</a> from London to Edinburgh between 1985 and 1990. A main line route closure during this period of relative network stability was the 1500V DC-electrified <a href="Woodhead%20Line">Woodhead Line</a> between Manchester and Sheffield: passenger service ceased in 1970 and goods in 1981.

The 1980s and 1990s saw the closure of some railways which had survived the Beeching Axe a generation earlier, but which had seen passenger services withdrawn. This included the bulk of the <a href="Chester%20and%20Connah%27s%20Quay%20Railway">Chester and Connah's Quay Railway</a> in 1992, the <a href="Brierley%20Hill">Brierley Hill</a> to <a href="Walsall">Walsall</a> section of the <a href="South%20Staffordshire%20Line">South Staffordshire Line</a> in 1993, while the <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> to <a href="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a> section of the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> was closed in three phases between 1972 and 1992.

A further British Rail report, from a committee chaired by Sir David Serpell, was published in 1983. The <a href="Serpell%20Report">Serpell Report</a> made no recommendations as such, but did set out various options for the network including, at their most extreme, a skeletal system of less than 2000 route km. This report was not welcomed, and the government decided to quietly leave it on the shelf. Meanwhile, BR was gradually reorganised, with the regional structure finally being abolished and replaced with business-led sectors. This process, known as "sectorisation", led to far greater customer focus, but was cut short in 1994 with the splitting up of BR for privatisation.
Upon sectorisation in 1982, three passenger sectors were created: <a href="InterCity%20%28British%20Rail%29">InterCity</a>, operating principal express services; London & South East (renamed <a href="Network%20SouthEast">Network SouthEast</a> in 1986) operating commuter services in the London area; and Provincial (renamed <a href="Regional%20Railways">Regional Railways</a> in 1989) responsible for all other passenger services. In the <a href="metropolitan%20county">metropolitan counties</a> local services were managed by the <a href="Passenger%20Transport%20Executive">Passenger Transport Executive</a>s. Provincial was the most subsidised (per passenger km) of the three sectors; upon formation, its costs were four times its <a href="revenue">revenue</a>.

Because British Railways was such a large operation, running not just railways but also ferries, steamships and hotels, it has been considered difficult to analyse the effects of nationalisation. During the 1980s British Rail ran the <a href="Rail%20Riders">Rail Riders</a> membership club aimed at 5–15 year olds.

Prices rose quickly in this period, rising 108% in real terms from 1979 to 1994, as prices rose by 262% but RPI only increased by 154% in the same time.

Following nationalisation in 1948, British Railways began to adapt the corporate liveries on the rolling stock it had inherited from its predecessor railway companies. Initially, a <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">GWR</a>-style <a href="Brunswick%20green">Brunswick green</a> was used on passenger locomotives, and <a href="London%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">LNWR</a>-style lined black for mixed-traffic locomotives, but later green was more widely adopted.

Development of a corporate identity for the organisation was hampered by the competing ambitions of the <a href="British%20Transport%20Commission">British Transport Commission</a> and the <a href="Railway%20Executive">Railway Executive</a>. The Executive attempted to introduce a modern, curved logo which could also serve as the standard for station signage totems. Due to its similarity to a <a href="hot%20dog">hot dog</a>, it became known as the "flying sausage". BR eventually adopted the common branding of the BTC as its first corporate logo, an <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a>-style motif of a <a href="Lion%20%28heraldry%29">lion</a> astride a spoked wheel, designed for the BTC by <a href="Cecil%20Thomas%20%28sculptor%29">Cecil Thomas</a>; on the bar overlaid across the wheel, the BTC's name was replaced with the words "British Railways". This logo, nicknamed the "Cycling Lion", was applied from 1948–1956 to the sides of locomotives, while the sausage logo was adopted for station signs across Great Britain, each coloured according to the appropriate BR region.

In 1956, the BTC was granted a <a href="Achievement%20%28heraldry%29">heraldic achievement</a> by the <a href="College%20of%20Arms">College of Arms</a> and the <a href="Lord%20Lyon">Lord Lyon</a>, and then BTC chairman <a href="Brian%20Robertson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Robertson%20of%20Oakridge">Brian Robertson</a> wanted a grander logo for the railways. BR's second corporate logo (1956–1965), designed in consultation with <a href="Charles%20Franklyn">Charles Franklyn</a>, adapted the original, depicting a rampant lion emerging from a <a href="Crown%20%28heraldry%29">heraldic crown</a> and holding a spoked wheel, all enclosed in a roundel with the "British Railways" name displayed across a bar on either side. This emblem soon acquired the nickname of the "Ferret and Dartboard". A variant of the logo with the name in a circle was also used on locomotives.

The zeal for modernisation in the Beeching era drove the next rebranding exercise, and BR management wished to divest the organisation of anachronistic, heraldic motifs and develop a corporate identity to rival that of <a href="London%20Transport%20Board">London Transport</a>. BR's design panel set up a working party led by <a href="Milner%20Gray%20%28designer%29">Milner Gray</a> of the <a href="Design%20Research%20Unit">Design Research Unit</a>. They drew up <a href="British%20Rail%20Corporate%20Identity%20Manual">a Corporate Identity Manual</a> which established a coherent brand and design standard for the whole organisation, specifying <a href="Rail%20Blue">Rail Blue</a> and pearl grey as the standard colour scheme for all rolling stock; <a href="Rail%20Alphabet">Rail Alphabet</a> as the standard corporate typeface, designed by <a href="Jock%20Kinneir">Jock Kinneir</a> and <a href="Margaret%20Calvert">Margaret Calvert</a>; and introducing the now-iconic Corporate Identity Symbol of the "Double Arrow" logo. Designed by Gerald Barney (also of the DRU), this arrow device was formed of two interlocked arrows across two parallel lines, symbolising a double track railway. It was likened to a bolt of <a href="lightning">lightning</a> or <a href="barbed%20wire">barbed wire</a>, and also acquired a nickname: "the arrow of indecision". A mirror image of the double arrow was used on the <a href="port%20side">port side</a> of BR-owned <a href="Sealink">Sealink</a> ferry funnels. The new BR corporate identity and Double Arrow were rolled out in 1965, and the brand name of the organisation was truncated to "British Rail".

The uniformity of BR branding continued until the process of <a href="sectorisation">sectorisation</a> was introduced in the 1980s. Certain BR operations such as Inter-City, Network SouthEast or Railfreight began to adopt their own identities, introducing logos and colour schemes which were essentially variants of the British Rail brand. Eventually, as sectorisation developed into a prelude to privatisation, the unified British Rail brand disappeared, with the notable exception of the Double Arrow symbol, which has survived to this day and serves as a <a href="generic%20trademark">generic trademark</a> to denote railway services across Great Britain. The BR Corporate Identity Manual is noted as a piece of British <a href="design%20history">design history</a> and there are plans for it to be re-published.

Despite its nationalisation in 1947 "as one of the 'commanding heights' of the economy", according to some sources British Rail was not profitable for most (if not all) of its history. Newspapers reported that as recently as the 1990s, public <a href="rail%20subsidy">rail subsidy</a> was counted as profit; as early as 1961, British Railways were losing £300,000 a day.

It was thought that most of the nationalised railways (excluding some freight services) would cease to operate like other unprofitable privatised businesses in the UK, and British Rail's profitability was questioned. Although the company was considered the sole public-transport option in many rural areas, the <a href="Beeching%20cuts">Beeching cuts</a> made buses the only public transport available in some rural areas. Despite increases in traffic congestion and automotive fuel prices beginning to rise in the 1990s, British Rail remained unprofitable. Following sectorisation, InterCity became profitable. This sector became the first long distance passenger railway in the UK to go into profit. InterCity became one of Britain’s top 150 companies with civilised city centre to city centre travel across the nation from <a href="Aberdeen%20railway%20station">Aberdeen</a> and <a href="Inverness%20railway%20station">Inverness</a> in the north to <a href="Poole%20railway%20station">Poole</a> and <a href="Penzance%20railway%20station">Penzance</a> in the south.

In 1988, the line to <a href="Aberdare">Aberdare</a> was reopened. A British Rail advertisement ("Britain's Railway", directed by <a href="Hugh%20Hudson">Hugh Hudson</a>) featured some of the most iconic railway structures in Britain, including the <a href="Forth%20Rail%20Bridge">Forth Rail Bridge</a>, <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Bridge">Royal Albert Bridge</a>, <a href="Glenfinnan%20Viaduct">Glenfinnan Viaduct</a> and <a href="London%20Paddington%20station">London Paddington station</a>. The <a href="London%20Liverpool%20Street">London Liverpool Street</a> station was rebuilt, opened by <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, and a new station was constructed at <a href="Stansted%20Airport%20railway%20station">Stansted Airport</a> in 1991. The following year, the <a href="Maesteg%20Line">Maesteg Line</a> was reopened and the line to <a href="King%27s%20Lynn%20railway%20station">King's Lynn</a> electrified.

Between 1994 and 1997, British Rail was privatised. Ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to <a href="Railtrack">Railtrack</a> on 1 April 1994. Passenger operations were later <a href="Franchising">franchised</a> to 25 private-sector operators and the freight services were sold to six companies, five of whom were owned by the same buyer.
The <a href="Waterloo%20%26amp%3B%20City%20line">Waterloo & City line</a>, part of BR Network SouthEast, was not included in the privatisation and was transferred to <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> in December 1994. The remaining obligations of British Rail were transferred to <a href="BRB%20%28Residuary%29%20Limited">BRB (Residuary) Limited</a>.

The privatisation, proposed by the Conservative government in 1992, was opposed by the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> and the rail unions. Although Labour initially proposed to reverse privatisation, the <a href="New%20Labour">New Labour</a> manifesto of 1997 instead opposed Conservative plans to privatise the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>. Rail unions have historically opposed privatisation, but former <a href="Associated%20Society%20of%20Locomotive%20Engineers%20and%20Firemen">Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen</a> general secretary <a href="Lew%20Adams">Lew Adams</a> moved to work for <a href="Virgin%20Trains">Virgin Trains</a>, and said on a 2004 radio phone-in programme: "All the time it was in the public sector, all we got were cuts, cuts, cuts. And today there are more members in the trade union, more train drivers, and more trains running. The reality is that it worked, we’ve protected jobs, and we got more jobs."

The former BR network, with the trunk routes of the <a href="West%20Coast%20Main%20Line">West Coast Main Line</a>, <a href="East%20Coast%20Main%20Line">East Coast Main Line</a>, <a href="Great%20Western%20Main%20Line">Great Western Main Line</a>, <a href="Great%20Eastern%20Main%20Line">Great Eastern Main Line</a> and <a href="Midland%20Main%20Line">Midland Main Line</a>, remains mostly unchanged since privatisation. Several lines have reopened and more are proposed, particularly in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="Wales">Wales</a> where the control of railway passenger services is devolved from central government. However, in England passenger trains have returned to Mansfield, <a href="Corby%20railway%20station">Corby</a>, <a href="Chandlers%20Ford%20railway%20station">Chandlers Ford</a>, the reopened line to <a href="Aylesbury%20Vale%20Parkway%20railway%20station">Aylesbury Vale Parkway</a> and there are numerous other proposals to restore services, such as Oxford-Milton Keynes/Aylesbury, <a href="Wealden%20Line">Lewes-Uckfield</a>, Bristol-Portishead and Plymouth-Tavistock. In London, Tyne and Wear, Greater Manchester, the West Midlands and Nottingham urban light-rail systems have taken over the routes of some former BR routes.

In Wales, the Welsh Assembly Government successfully supported the reopening to passenger services, of the <a href="Vale%20of%20Glamorgan%20Line">Vale of Glamorgan Line</a> between Barry and Bridgend in 2005. In 2008 the <a href="Ebbw%20Valley%20Railway">Ebbw Valley Railway</a> reopened between <a href="Ebbw%20Vale%20Parkway%20railway%20station">Ebbw Vale Parkway</a> and <a href="Cardiff%20Central%20railway%20station">Cardiff</a>, with services to Newport scheduled to commence by 2011. (The Barry-Bridgend route was included in the closures proposed in the Beeching report of March 1963 and its services were duly withdrawn in June 1964, but Ebbw Vale had already been closed to passengers before the report was published.)

In Scotland, the Scottish Government have reinstated the lines between <a href="Argyle%20Line%23Extensions">Hamilton and Larkhall</a>, <a href="Stirling-Alloa-Kincardine%20rail%20link">Stirling and Alloa</a>, and <a href="Airdrie-Bathgate%20Rail%20Link">Airdrie to Bathgate</a>. The biggest line reinstatement project was the rebuilding of part of the former <a href="Waverley%20Route">Waverley Route</a> from Edinburgh to Carlisle as the <a href="Borders%20Railway">Borders Railway</a>.

On its creation, British Railways' assets included the narrow gauge <a href="Vale%20of%20Rheidol%20Railway">Vale of Rheidol Railway</a> in Ceredigion, Wales. Although built as a working railway, this line was by that time already principally a tourist asset. British Rail continued to operate the line, using steam locomotives, well beyond the withdrawal of standard gauge steam. The line's three steam locomotives became the only steam engines to receive <a href="TOPS">TOPS</a> serial numbers, and the only steam engines to be painted in BR Rail Blue livery and carry the double arrow logo. The Vale of Rheidol Railway was privatised in 1989 and continues to operate as a private heritage railway.

Other preserved lines, or <a href="heritage%20railways">heritage railways</a>, have reopened some lines previously closed by British Rail. These range from picturesque rural branch lines like the <a href="Keighley%20and%20Worth%20Valley%20Railway">Keighley and Worth Valley Railway</a> to sections of mainline such as the <a href="Great%20Central%20Railway">Great Central Railway</a>. Many have links to the National Rail network, both at station interchanges, for example the <a href="Severn%20Valley%20Railway">Severn Valley Railway</a> between and <a href="Kidderminster%20Town">Kidderminster Town</a>, and physical rail connections like the <a href="Watercress%20Line">Watercress Line</a> at .

Although most are operated solely as leisure amenities some also provide educational resources, and a few have ambitions to restore commercial services over routes abandoned by the nationalised industry.

British Railways operated ships from its formation in 1948 on several routes. Many ships were acquired on nationalisation, and others were built for operation by British Railways or its later subsidiary, <a href="Sealink">Sealink</a>. Those ships capable of carrying rail vehicles were classed under <a href="TOPS">TOPS</a> as <a href="British%20Rail%20Class%2099">Class 99</a>.

Sealink was a ferry company based in the United Kingdom from 1970 to 1984, operating services to France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Channel Islands, Isle of Wight and Ireland.

The joint <a href="hovercraft">hovercraft</a> services of British Rail (under British Rail Hovercraft Limited) in association with the French <a href="SNCF">SNCF</a>. British Rail Hovercraft Limited was established in 1965, under authority given to it by the British Railways Act 1967 and started its first service in 1966. Seaspeed started cross-Channel services from <a href="Dover">Dover</a>, <a href="England">England</a> to <a href="Calais">Calais</a> and <a href="Boulogne-sur-Mer">Boulogne-sur-Mer</a>, <a href="France">France</a> using <a href="SR-N4">SR-N4</a> hovercraft in August 1968.

The Advanced Passenger Train (APT) was an experimental <a href="tilting%20train">tilting</a> <a href="high%20speed%20train">high speed train</a> developed by British Rail during the 1970s and early 1980s, for use on the <a href="West%20Coast%20Main%20Line">West Coast Main Line</a>, which contained a lot of curves. Notable among numerous technical advancements was the active tilting system, which the APT pioneered and has since appeared on other designs around the world.

Under the process of British Rail's privatisation, operations were split into more than 100 companies. The ownership and operation of the infrastructure of the railway system was taken over by <a href="Railtrack">Railtrack</a>. The Telecomms infrastructure and <a href="British%20Rail%20Telecommunications">British Rail Telecommunications</a> was sold to <a href="Racal">Racal</a>, which in turn was sold to <a href="Global%20Crossing">Global Crossing</a> and merged with <a href="Thales%20Group">Thales Group</a>. The rolling stock was transferred to three private <a href="rolling%20stock%20operating%20company">ROSCO</a>s (rolling stock companies). Passenger services were divided into 25 operating companies, which were let on a franchise basis for a set period, whilst goods services were sold off completely. Dozens of smaller engineering and maintenance companies were also created and sold off.

British Rail's passenger services came to an end upon the franchising of <a href="ScotRail%20%28British%20Rail%29">ScotRail</a>; the final train that the company operated was a <a href="Railfreight%20Distribution">Railfreight Distribution</a> goods train in autumn 1997. The British Railways Board continued in existence as a corporation until early 2001, when it was replaced with the <a href="Strategic%20Rail%20Authority">Strategic Rail Authority</a>.

Since privatisation, the structure of the rail industry and number of companies has changed several times as franchises have been re-let and the areas covered by franchises restructured. Franchise-based companies that took over passenger rail services include:


Since privatisation, many groups have campaigned for the renationalisation of British Rail, most notably 'Bring Back British Rail'. Various interested parties also have views on the <a href="privatisation%20of%20British%20Rail">privatisation of British Rail</a>.

The renationalisation of the railways of Britain continue to have popular support. A poll in 2012 showed 70% support for renationalisation.

Due to <a href="Rail%20franchising%20in%20Great%20Britain">rail franchises</a> lasting sometimes over a decade, full renationalisation would take years unless compensation was paid to terminate contracts early. 

When the infrastructure owning company <a href="Railtrack">Railtrack</a> ceased trading in 2002, the <a href="Blair%20ministry">Labour government</a> set up the not-for-dividend company <a href="Network%20Rail">Network Rail</a> to take over the duties rather than renationalise this part of the network. However On 1 September 2014, Network Rail was reclassified as a central government body, adding around £34 billion to public sector net debt. This reclassification had been requested by the <a href="Office%20for%20Budget%20Responsibility">Office for Budget Responsibility</a> to comply with <a href="European%20System%20of%20Accounts">pan-European accounting standard</a> ESA10.

Under <a href="Jeremy%20Corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> has pledged to gradually renationalise British Rail franchises if elected, as and when their private contracts expire, creating a "People's Railway". The policy is popular with the British public, with polls showing approximately two-thirds of voters support the idea. It also echoes the positions defended by the RMT - the biggest trade union within the railway industry. It has recently stepped up its campaigning under the presidency of Sean Hoyle for a nationalized railway.

In 1989, the <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20Network%29">ITV</a> Sketch Show "<a href="Spitting%20Image">Spitting Image</a>" made a parody of Hudson's "British Rail" advert on the plans of the <a href="Conservative">Conservative</a> <a href="British%20Government">British Government</a> to privatise the railways featuring many of the show's puppets (including the show's portrayal of <a href="List%20of%20Prime%20Ministers%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">former Prime Minister</a> <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>), numerous BR trains and landmarks and even a cardboard cutout of <a href="Thomas%20the%20Tank%20Engine">Thomas the Tank Engine</a>.

In the 1990 film <a href="Die%20Hard%202">Die Hard 2</a> just before the fictional Windsor Air Flight 114 crashes into the runway, a Stewardess can be heard remarking "Oh, hey. We're just like British Rail, luv, we may be late but we get you there"

Book of Job

The Book of Job (; Hebrew: אִיוֹב "Iyov") is a book in the <a href="Ketuvim">Ketuvim</a> ("Writings") section of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> (<a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>), and the first poetic book in the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> of the <a href="Christian%20Bible">Christian Bible</a>. Addressing the problem of <a href="theodicy">theodicy</a> – the vindication of the justice of God in the light of humanity's suffering – it is a rich theological work setting out a variety of perspectives. It has been widely and often extravagantly praised for its literary qualities, with <a href="Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a> calling it "the greatest poem of ancient and modern times".

The Book of Job consists of a prose prologue and epilogue narrative framing poetic dialogues and monologues. It is common to view the narrative frame as the original core of the book, enlarged later by the poetic dialogues and discourses, and sections of the book such as the Elihu speeches and the wisdom poem of chapter 28 as late insertions, but recent trends have tended to concentrate on the book's underlying editorial unity.

1. "Prologue" in two scenes, the first on earth, the second in heaven ()

2. "Job's opening monologue" ( – seen by some scholars as a bridge between the prologue and the dialogues and by others as the beginning of the dialogues), and three cycles of "dialogues between Job and his three friends" ( – the third cycle is not complete, the expected speech of Zophar being replaced by the wisdom poem of chapter 28)

3. Three monologues:

4. Two "speeches by God" (chapters 38:1–40:2 and 40:6–41:34, 42:7–8), with "Job's responses"

5. "Epilogue" – Job's restoration (chapters 42:9–17).

The prologue on earth shows the righteous <a href="Job%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Job</a> blessed with wealth and sons and daughters. The scene shifts to heaven, where God asks <a href="Satan">Satan</a> ("ha-satan", literally "the accuser") for his opinion of Job's piety. Satan answers that Job is pious only because God has blessed him; if God were to take away everything that Job had, then he would surely curse God. God gives Satan permission to take Job's wealth and kill all of his children and servants, but Job nonetheless praises God: "Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return: the Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord." God allows Satan to afflict his body with boils. Job sits in ashes, and his wife prompts him to "curse God, and die," but Job answers: "Shall we receive good from God and shall we not receive evil?"

Job laments the day of his birth; he would like to die, but even that is denied to him. His three friends Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, console him. The friends do not waver in their belief that Job's suffering is a punishment for sin, for God causes no one to suffer innocently, and they advise him to repent and seek God's mercy. Job responds with scorn: a just God would not treat him so harshly, patience in suffering is impossible, and the Creator should not take his creatures so lightly, to come against them with such force.

The dialogues of Job and his friends are followed by a poem (the "hymn to wisdom") on the inaccessibility of wisdom: "Where is wisdom to be found?" it asks, and concludes that it has been hidden from man (chapter 28). Job contrasts his previous fortune with his present plight, an outcast, mocked and in pain. He protests his innocence, lists the principles he has lived by, and demands that God answer him. <a href="Elihu%20%28Job%29">Elihu</a> (a character not previously mentioned) intervenes to state that wisdom comes from God, who reveals it through dreams and visions to those who will then declare their knowledge.

God speaks from a whirlwind. His speeches neither explain Job's suffering, nor defend divine justice, nor enter into the courtroom confrontation that Job has demanded, nor respond to his oath of innocence. Instead they contrast Job's weakness with divine wisdom and omnipotence: "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?" Job makes a brief response, but God's monologue resumes, never addressing Job directly. In 42:1–6 Job makes his final response, confessing God's power and his own lack of knowledge "of things beyond me which I did not know". Previously he has only heard, but now his eyes have seen God, and "therefore I retract/ And repent in dust and ashes."

God tells Eliphaz that he and his two friends "have not spoken of me what is right as my servant Job has done". The three (Elihu is not mentioned) are told to make <a href="Burnt%20offering%20%28Judaism%29">a burnt offering</a> with Job as their intercessor, "for only to him will I show favour". Job is restored to health, riches and family, and lives to see his children to the fourth generation.

Rabbinic tradition ascribes the authorship of Job to <a href="Moses">Moses</a>. However, scholars generally agree that it was written between the 7th and 4th centuries BCE, with the 6th century BCE as the most likely period for various reasons. The anonymous author was almost certainly an Israelite, although he has set his story outside Israel, in southern <a href="Edom">Edom</a> or northern Arabia, and makes allusion to places as far apart as <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> and Egypt. According to the 6th-century BCE prophet <a href="book%20of%20Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a>, Job was a man of antiquity renowned for his righteousness, and the book's author has chosen this legendary hero for his <a href="parable">parable</a>.

The language of Job stands out for its conservative spelling and for its exceptionally large number of words and forms not found elsewhere in the Bible. The 12th century Jewish scholar <a href="Abraham%20ibn%20Ezra">Ibn Ezra</a> concluded that the book must have been written in some other language and translated into Hebrew, and many later scholars down to the 20th century looked for an <a href="Aramaic">Aramaic</a>, <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> or <a href="Edomite%20language">Edomite</a> original, but a close analysis suggests that the foreign words and foreign-looking forms are literary affectations designed to lend authenticity to the book's distant setting.

Job exists in a number of forms: the Hebrew <a href="Masoretic%20Text">Masoretic Text</a>, which underlies many modern Bible translations; the Greek <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> made in Egypt in the last centuries BCE; and Aramaic and Hebrew manuscripts found among the <a href="Dead%20Sea%20Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a>.

Job, <a href="Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</a> and the <a href="Book%20of%20Proverbs">Book of Proverbs</a> belong to the genre of <a href="wisdom%20literature">wisdom literature</a>, sharing a perspective that they themselves call the "way of wisdom". Wisdom means both a way of thinking and a body of knowledge gained through such thinking, as well as the ability to apply it to life. It is attainable in part through human effort and in part as a gift from God, but never in its entirety – except by God. The three books share attitudes and assumptions but differ in their conclusions: Proverbs makes confident statements about the world and its workings that are flatly contradicted by Job and Ecclesiastes. Wisdom literature from Sumeria and Babylonia can be dated to the second millennium BCE. Several texts from ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt offer parallels to Job, and while it is impossible to tell whether the author of Job was influenced by any of them, their existence suggests that he was the recipient of a long tradition of reflection on the existence of inexplicable suffering.

Job is an investigation of the problem of divine justice. This problem, known in theology as <a href="theodicy">theodicy</a>, can be rephrased as a question: "Why do the righteous suffer?" The conventional answer in ancient Israel was that God rewards virtue and punishes sin (the principle known as "retributive justice"). This assumes a world in which human choices and actions are morally significant, but experience demonstrates that suffering cannot be sensibly understood as a consequence of bad choices and actions, and unmerited suffering requires theological candour.

The biblical concept of righteousness was rooted in the covenant-making God who had ordered creation for communal well-being, and the righteous were those who invested in the community, showing special concern for the poor and needy (see Job's description of his life in chapter 31). Their antithesis were the wicked, who were selfish and greedy. Satan raises the question of whether there is such a thing as disinterested righteousness: if God rewards righteousness with prosperity, will men not act righteously from selfish motives? He asks God to test this by removing the prosperity of Job, the most righteous of all God's servants.

The book begins with the frame narrative, giving the reader an omniscient "God's eye perspective" which introduces Job as a man of exemplary faith and piety, "blameless and upright", who "fears God" and "shuns evil". God is seen initiating the discussion with Satan and approving Job's suffering, a device which serves three purposes: the usual explanations for suffering, that the sufferer has committed some sin of which he is unaware or that God's actions are inscrutable, are eliminated; it makes clear that it is not Job who is on trial, but God's policy of retribution; and the reader sees that God himself bears responsibility for Job's suffering. The contrast between the frame and the poetic dialogues and monologues, in which Job never learns of the opening scenes in heaven or of the reason for his suffering, creates a sense of contradictory juxtaposition between the divine and human views of Job's suffering.

In the poetic dialogues Job's friends see his suffering and assume he must be guilty, since God is just. Job, knowing he is innocent, concludes that God must be unjust. He retains his piety throughout the story (belying Satan's suspicion that his righteousness is due to the expectation of reward), but makes clear from his first speech that he agrees with his friends that God should and does reward righteousness. Elihu rejects the arguments of both parties: Job is wrong to accuse God of injustice, as God is greater than human beings, and nor are the friends correct; for suffering, far from being a punishment, may "rescue the afflicted from their affliction" and make them more amenable to revelation – literally, "open their ears" (36:15).

Chapter 28, the Hymn to Wisdom, introduces another theme, divine wisdom. The hymn does not place any emphasis on retributive justice, stressing instead the inaccessibility of wisdom. Wisdom cannot be discovered or purchased, it says; God alone knows the meaning of the world, and he grants it only to those who live in reverence before him. God possesses wisdom because he grasps the complexities of the world (Job 28:24–26) – a theme which looks forward to God's speech in chapters 38–41 with its repeated refrain "Where were you when...?"

When God finally speaks he neither explains the reason for Job's suffering (revealed to the reader in the prologue in heaven) nor defends his justice. The first speech focuses on his role in maintaining order in the universe: the list of things that God does and Job cannot do demonstrates divine wisdom because order is the heart of wisdom. Job then confesses his lack of wisdom, meaning his lack of understanding of the workings of the cosmos and of the ability to maintain it. The second speech concerns God's role in controlling <a href="behemoth">behemoth</a> and <a href="leviathan">leviathan</a>, sometimes translated as the hippopotamus and crocodile, but more probably representing primeval cosmic creatures, in either case demonstrating God's wisdom and power. Job's reply to God's final speech is longer than his first and more complicated. The usual view is that he admits to being wrong to challenge God and now repents "in dust and ashes" (42:6), but the Hebrew is difficult, and an alternative understanding is that Job says he was wrong to repent and mourn and does not retract any of his arguments. In the concluding part of the frame narrative God restores and increases his prosperity, indicating that the divine policy on retributive justice remains unchanged.

In the <a href="Second%20Temple">Second Temple</a> period (500 BCE – 70 CE) Job began being transformed into something more patient and steadfast, with his suffering a test of virtue and a vindication of righteousness for the glory of God. The process of "sanctifying" Job began with the Greek <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> translation (c. 200 BCE) and was furthered in the <a href="Testament%20of%20Job">Testament of Job</a> (1st century BCE – 1st century CE), which makes him the hero of patience. This reading pays little attention to the Job of the dialogue sections of the book, but it was the tradition taken up by the <a href="Epistle%20of%20James">Epistle of James</a> in the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>, which presents Job as one whose patience and endurance should be emulated by believers (James 5:7–11).

Jewish interpretation of Job was initially positive. He was seen as a righteous Gentile who acknowledged God. Very early, however, Christianity began interpreting Job 19:23–29 (verses concerning a "redeemer" whom Job hopes can save him from God) as a prophecy of Christ, although the major view among scholars is that Job's "redeemer" is either an angelic being or God himself. With Job viewed by Christians as a witness to the coming Christ, the predominant Jewish view became "Job the blasphemer", with some rabbis even saying that he was rightly punished by God because he had stood by while Pharaoh massacred the innocent Jewish infants.

<a href="Saint%20Augustine">Saint Augustine</a> recorded that Job had prophesied the coming of Christ, and <a href="Gregory%20the%20Great">Gregory the Great</a> offered him as a model of right living worthy of respect. The medieval Jewish scholar <a href="Maimonides">Maimonides</a> declared his story a parable, and the medieval Christian <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a> wrote a detailed commentary declaring it true history. In the Reformation <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> explained how Job's confession of sinfulness and worthlessness underlay his saintliness, and <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>'s Job demonstrated the doctrine of the resurrection and the ultimate certainty of divine justice.

The contemporary movement known as creation theology, an <a href="Environmental%20theology">ecological theology</a> valuing the needs of all creation, interprets God's speeches in Job 38–41 to imply that his interests and actions are not exclusively focused on humankind.

Jewish liturgy does not use readings from the Book of Job in the manner of the <a href="Torah">Pentateuch</a>, <a href="Nevi%27im">Prophets</a>, or <a href="Five%20Megillot">Five Megillot</a>, although it is quoted at funerals and times of mourning. However, there are some Jews, particularly the <a href="Spanish%20and%20Portuguese%20Jews">Spanish and Portuguese Jews</a>, who do hold public readings of Job on the <a href="Tisha%20B%27Av">Tisha B'Av</a> fast (a day of mourning over the destruction of the <a href="Solomon%27s%20Temple">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Temple">Second</a> <a href="Temple%20in%20Jerusalem">Temples</a> and other tragedies). The <a href="cantillation">cantillation</a> signs for the large poetic section in the middle of the Book of Job differ from those of most of the biblical books, using a system shared with it only by <a href="Psalms">Psalms</a> and <a href="Book%20of%20Proverbs">Proverbs</a>.

The <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a> reads from Job and Exodus during <a href="Holy%20Week">Holy Week</a>. Exodus prepares for the understanding of Christ's exodus to his Father, of his fulfillment of the whole history of salvation; Job, the sufferer, is the Old Testament icon of Christ. The <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> reads from Job during <a href="Matins">Matins</a> in the first two weeks of September and in the Office of the Dead, and in the revised <a href="Liturgy%20of%20the%20Hours">Liturgy of the Hours</a> Job is read during the Eighth and Ninth Weeks in <a href="Ordinary%20Time">Ordinary Time</a>.

The Book of Job has been deeply influential in Western culture, to such an extent that no list could be more than representative. Musical settings from Job include <a href="Orlande%20de%20Lassus">Orlande de Lassus</a>'s 1565 cycle of motets, the "Sacrae Lectiones Novem ex Propheta Job", and <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a>'s use of Job 19:25 ("I know that my redeemer liveth") as an aria in his 1741 oratorio "<a href="Messiah%20%28Handel%29">Messiah</a>". Modern works based on the book include <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>'s "", French composer <a href="Darius%20Milhaud">Darius Milhaud</a>'s "Cantata From Job", and Joseph Stein's Broadway interpretation "<a href="The%20Fiddler%20on%20the%20Roof">The Fiddler on the Roof</a>", based on an earlier Yiddish memoir by Sholem Alchem in 1894. Neil Simon wrote "<a href="God%27s%20Favorite">God's Favorite</a>" which is a modern retelling of the Book of Job. Breughel and <a href="Georges%20de%20la%20Tour">Georges de la Tour</a> depicted Job visited by his wife, and <a href="William%20Blake%27s%20Illustrations%20of%20the%20Book%20of%20Job">William Blake produced an entire cycle of illustrations for the book</a>. Writers Job has inspired or influenced include <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a> ("<a href="Samson%20Agonistes">Samson Agonistes</a>"), Dostoevsky ("<a href="The%20Brothers%20Karamazov">The Brothers Karamazov</a>"), Franz Kafka ("<a href="The%20Trial">The Trial</a>"), <a href="Carl%20Jung">Carl Jung</a> ("<a href="Answer%20to%20Job">Answer to Job</a>"), <a href="Joseph%20Roth">Joseph Roth</a> ("<a href="Job%20%28novel%29">Job</a>"), and Bernard Malamud. Archibald MacLeish's drama, "<a href="J.B.%20%28play%29">JB</a>", one of the most prominent uses of the Book of Job in modern literature, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1959. Job's influence can also be seen in the <a href="Coen%20brothers">Coen brothers</a>' 2009 film, "<a href="A%20Serious%20Man">A Serious Man</a>", which was nominated for two <a href="Oscars">Oscars</a>. <a href="Terrence%20Malick">Terrence Malick</a>'s 2011 film "<a href="The%20Tree%20of%20Life%20%28film%29">The Tree of Life</a>", which won the <a href="Palme%20d%27Or">Palme d'Or</a>, is heavily influenced by the themes of the Book of Job, as the film starts with a quote from the beginning of God's speech to Job. A 2014 Malayalam film called "<a href="Iyobinte%20Pusthakam">Iyobinte Pusthakam</a>" tells the story of a man who is losing everything in his life and also has parallels with Dostoevsky's ("<a href="The%20Brothers%20Karamazov">The Brothers Karamazov</a>"). The Russian film "<a href="Leviathan%20%282014%20film%29">Leviathan</a>" also draws themes from the Book of Job. The 2015 critically acclaimed novel, "The Suffering of Innocents", by Marc Zirogiannis is loosely based on the Book of Job and asks the question, "Why Do the Righteous Suffer?". In 2015 two Ukrainian composers Roman Grygoriv and Illia Razumeiko created opera-requiem <a href="IYOV">IYOV</a>. The premiere of the opera was held on 21 September 2015 on the main stage of the international multidisciplinary festival <a href="Gogolfest">Gogolfest</a>

Job (Arabic Ayyub ايوب) is one of the 25 prophets mentioned by name in the <a href="Quran">Quran</a>, where he is lauded as a steadfast and upright worshiper (Q.38:44). His story has the same basic outline as in the Bible, although the three friends are replaced by his brothers, and his wife stays by his side. In <a href="Palestinian%20folklore">Palestinian folklore</a> Job's place of trial is <a href="Joura">Al-Joura</a>, a village outside the town of Al Majdal (<a href="Ashkelon">Ashkelon</a>). It was there that God rewarded him with a <a href="Fountain%20of%20Youth">Fountain of Youth</a> that removed whatever illnesses he had and restored his youth. Al-Joura was a place of annual festivities (four days in all) when people of many faiths gathered and bathed in a natural spring. In Lebanon the Muwahideen (or <a href="Druze">Druze</a>) community have a shrine built in the Shouf area that allegedly contains Job's tomb. In <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, Job is known as "Eyüp", and he is supposed to have lived in <a href="%C5%9Eanl%C4%B1urfa">Şanlıurfa</a>. There is also a tomb of Job outside the city of <a href="Salalah">Salalah</a> in Oman.

Book of Proverbs

The Book of Proverbs (<a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a>: מִשְלֵי, "Míshlê (Shlomoh)", "Proverbs (of <a href="Solomon">Solomon</a>)") is the second book of the third section (called Writings) of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> and a book of the <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>. When translated into <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> and <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, the title took on different forms: in the Greek <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> (LXX) it became Παροιμίαι "Paroimiai" ("Proverbs"); in the Latin <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> the title was "Proverbia", from which the English name is derived.

Proverbs is not merely an anthology but a "collection of collections" relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium. It is an example of the Biblical <a href="wisdom%20tradition">wisdom tradition</a>, and raises questions of values, moral behaviour, the meaning of human life, and right conduct. The repeated theme is that "the fear of God (meaning submission to the will of God) is the beginning of wisdom". Wisdom is praised for her role in creation; God acquired her before all else, and through her he gave order to chaos; and since humans have life and prosperity by conforming to the order of creation, seeking wisdom is the essence and goal of the religious life.

The superscriptions divide the collections as follows:

"Proverbs" translates the Hebrew word "mashal", but "mashal" has a wider range of meaning than the short catchy sayings implied by the English word. Thus, while roughly half the book is made up of "sayings" of this type, the other half is made up of longer poetic units of various types. These include "instructions" formulated as advice from a teacher or parent addressed to a student or child, dramatic personifications of both Wisdom and Folly, and the "words of the wise" sayings, longer than the Solomonic "sayings" but shorter and more diverse than the "instructions".

The first section (chapters 1–9) consists of an initial invitation to young men to take up the course of wisdom, ten "instructions", and five poems on personified Woman Wisdom. Proverbs 10:1–22:16, with 375 sayings, consists of two parts, the first contrasting the wise man and the fool (or the righteous and the wicked), the second addressing wise and foolish speech. Chapters 25–29, attributed to editorial activity of "the men of <a href="Hezekiah">Hezekiah</a>," contrasts the just and the wicked and broaches the topic of rich and poor. Chapter 30:1–4, the "sayings of Agur", introduces creation, divine power, and human ignorance.

It is impossible to offer precise dates for the sayings in Proverbs, a "collection of collections" relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium. The phrase conventionally used for the title is taken from chapter 1:1, "mishley shelomoh", Proverbs of Solomon (the phrase is repeated at 10:1 and 25:1), is likely more concerned with labeling the material than ascribing authorship.

The book is an anthology made up of six discrete units. The first, chapters 1–9, was probably the last to be composed, in the Persian or Hellenistic periods. This section has parallels to prior cuneiform writings. The second, chapters 10–22:16, carries the superscription "the proverbs of Solomon", which may have encouraged its inclusion in the Hebrew canon. The third unit is headed "bend your ear and hear the words of the wise": a large part of it is a recasting of a second-millennium BCE Egyptian work, the <a href="Instruction%20of%20Amenemope">Instruction of Amenemope</a>, and may have reached the Hebrew author(s) through an Aramaic translation. Chapter 24:23 begins a new section and source with the declaration, "these too are from the wise." The next section at chapter 25:1 has a superscription to the effect that the following proverbs were transcribed "by the men of <a href="Hezekiah">Hezekiah</a>", indicating at face value that they were collected in the reign of Hezekiah in the late 8th century BCE. Chapters 30 and 31 (the "words of Agur," the "words of Lemuel," and the description of the ideal woman) are a set of appendices, quite different in style and emphasis from the previous chapters.

The "wisdom" genre was widespread throughout the <a href="ancient%20Near%20East">ancient Near East</a>, and reading Proverbs alongside the examples recovered from Egypt and Mesopotamia reveals the common ground shared by international wisdom. The wisdom literature of Israel may have been developed in the family, the royal court, and houses of learning and instruction; nevertheless, the overwhelming impression is of instruction within the family in small villages.

Along with the other examples of the Biblical <a href="wisdom%20tradition">wisdom tradition</a> – <a href="Book%20of%20Job">Job</a> and <a href="Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</a> and some other writings – Proverbs raises questions of values, moral behavior, the meaning of human life, and righteous conduct. The three retain an ongoing relevance for both religious and secular readers, Job and Ecclesiastes through the boldness of their dissent from received tradition, Proverbs in its worldliness and satiric shrewdness. Wisdom is as close as Biblical literature comes to Greek philosophy, of which it was a contemporary; it shares with the Greeks an inquiry into values and reflections on the human condition, although there is no discussion of <a href="ontology">ontology</a>, <a href="epistemology">epistemology</a>, <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>, and the other abstract issues raised by the Greeks.

Proverbs was almost excluded from the Bible because of its contradictions (the result of the book's origins as not just an anthology but an anthology of anthologies). The reader is told, for example, both to "not answer a fool according to his folly", according to 26:4, and to "answer a fool according to his folly", as 26:5 advises. More pervasively, the recurring theme of the initial unit (chapters 1–9) is that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, but the following units are much less theological, presenting wisdom as a transmissible human craft, until with 30:1–14, the "words of Agur," we return once more to the idea that God alone possesses wisdom.

"The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom" (Proverbs 9:10 – the phrase implies submission to God's will). Wisdom is praised for her role in creation ("God by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens" – Proverbs 3:19). God acquired her before all else, and through her he gave order to chaos ("When [God] established the heavens...when he drew a circle on then face of the <a href="Tehom">Deeps</a>...when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then I was beside him" – Proverbs 8:27–31). Since humans have life and prosperity by conforming to the order of creation, seeking wisdom is the essence and goal of the religious life. Wisdom, or the wise person, is compared and contrasted with foolishness or the fool, meaning one who is lacking in wisdom and uninterested in instruction, not one who is merely silly or playful (though see the words of Agur for a "fool" who has wisdom, and could be seen as playful).

For the most part Proverbs offers a simplistic view of life with few grey areas: life lived according to the rules brings reward, life in violation of them is certain to bring disaster. In contrast, <a href="Book%20of%20Job">Job</a> and <a href="Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</a> appear to be direct contradictions of the simplicities of Proverbs, each in its own way all but dismissing the assumptions of the "wise". Noteworthy also is the fact that the "mighty acts of God" (<a href="the%20Exodus">the Exodus</a>, the giving of the <a href="Torah">Torah</a> at Sinai, the Covenant between God and Israel, etc.) which make up Israel's history are completely or almost completely absent from Proverbs and the other Wisdom books: in contrast to the other books of the Hebrew bible, which appeal to divine revelation for their authority ("Thus says the Lord!"), wisdom appeals to human reason and observation.

The pre-Exilic (i.e. pre-586 BCE) Old Testament allowed no equals to YHWH in heaven, despite the continued existence of an <a href="Heavenly%20host">assembly of subordinate servant-deities</a>. The post-Exilic writers of the Wisdom tradition developed the idea that Wisdom existed before creation and was used by God to create the universe: "Present from the beginning, Wisdom assumes the role of master builder while God establishes the heavens, restricts the chaotic waters, and shapes the mountains and fields." Borrowing ideas from Greek philosophers who held that reason bound the universe together, the Wisdom tradition taught that God's Wisdom, Word and Spirit were the ground of cosmic unity. Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and applied them to Jesus: the <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Colossians">Epistle to the Colossians</a> calls Jesus "...image of the invisible God, first-born of all creation...", while the <a href="Gospel%20of%20John">Gospel of John</a> identifies him with the creative word ("In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God").

In the 4th century, when Christianity was caught up in heresies and still developing the creeds which would define its beliefs, was used both to support and refute the claims of the <a href="Arian%20controversy">Arians</a>. The Arians, assuming that Christ could be equated with the "Wisdom of God" (), argued that the Son, like Wisdom, was "created" (Proverbs 8:22), and therefore subordinate to the Creator; their opponents, who argued that the relevant Hebrew word should be translated as "begot", won the debate, and the <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Nicene Creed</a> declared that the Son was "begotten, not made", meaning that God and Christ were <a href="Consubstantiality">consubstantial</a>.

Book of Lamentations

The Book of Lamentations (, "‘Êykhôh", from its <a href="incipit">incipit</a> meaning "how") is a collection of poetic <a href="laments">laments</a> for the <a href="Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%28587%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BBC%29">destruction of Jerusalem</a>. In the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> it appears in the <a href="Ketuvim">Ketuvim</a> ("Writings"), beside the <a href="Song%20of%20Songs">Song of Songs</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Ruth">Book of Ruth</a>, <a href="Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</a> and the <a href="Book%20of%20Esther">Book of Esther</a> (the <a href="Megilloth">Megilloth</a> or "Five Scrolls"), although there is no set order; in the Christian <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> it follows the <a href="Book%20of%20Jeremiah">Book of Jeremiah</a>, as the prophet <a href="Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a> is its traditional author. Jeremiah's authorship is no longer generally accepted, although it is generally accepted that the destruction of Jerusalem by Babylon in 586 BCE forms the background to the poems. The book is partly a traditional "city lament" mourning the desertion of the city by God, its destruction, and the ultimate return of the divinity, and partly a funeral dirge in which the bereaved bewails and addresses the dead. The tone is bleak: God does not speak, the degree of suffering is presented as undeserved, and expectations of future redemption are minimal.

The book is traditionally recited on the fast day of <a href="Tisha%20B%27Av">Tisha B'Av</a> ("Ninth of Av"), mourning the destruction of both the <a href="First%20Temple">First Temple</a> and the <a href="Second%20Temple">Second</a>; in <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> it is traditionally read during <a href="Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> of the <a href="Holy%20Triduum">Holy Triduum</a>.

Lamentations consists of five distinct poems, corresponding to its five chapters. The first four are written as <a href="acrostic">acrostic</a>s – chapters 1, 2, and 4 each have 22 verses, corresponding to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, the first lines beginning with the first letter of the alphabet, the second with the second letter, and so on. Chapter 3 has 66 verses, so that each letter begins three lines, and the fifth poem is not acrostic but still has 22 lines. The purpose or function of this form is unknown.

The book consists of five separate poems. In the first (chapter 1), the city sits as a desolate weeping widow overcome with miseries. In Chapter 2 these miseries are described in connection with national sins and acts of God. Chapter 3 speaks of hope for the people of God: the chastisement would only be for their good; a better day would dawn for them. Chapter 4 laments the ruin and desolation of the city and temple, but traces it to the people's sins. Chapter 5 is a prayer that Zion's reproach may be taken away in the repentance and recovery of the people. The five chapters can be seen as the five truths.

Lamentations has traditionally been ascribed to <a href="Book%20of%20Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>, probably on the grounds of the reference in 2 Chronicles 35:25 to the prophet composing a lament on the death of King <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a>, but there is no reference to Josiah in the book and no reason to connect it to Jeremiah. 
The language fits an <a href="Babylonian%20Exile">Exilic</a> date (586–520 BCE), and the poems probably originated from Judeans who remained in the land. Scholars are divided over whether they are the work of one or multiple authors. One clue pointing to multiple authors is that the gender and situation of the first-person witness changes – the narration is feminine in the first and second lamentation, and masculine in the third, while the fourth and fifth are eyewitness reports of Jerusalem's destruction; conversely, the similarities of style, vocabulary, and theological outlook, as well as the uniform historical setting, are arguments for one author.

Lamentations combines elements of the "qinah", a funeral dirge for the loss of the city, and the "communal lament" pleading for the restoration of its people. It reflects the view, traceable to <a href="Sumer">Sumer</a>ian literature of a thousand years earlier, that the destruction of the holy city was a punishment by God for the communal sin of its people.

Beginning with the reality of disaster, Lamentations concludes with the bitter possibility that God may have finally rejected Israel (chapter 5:22). Sufferers in the face of grief are not urged to a confidence in the goodness of God; in fact God is accountable for the disaster. The poet acknowledges that this suffering is a just punishment, still God is held to have had choice over whether to act in this way and at this time. Hope arises from a recollection of God's past goodness, but although this justifies a cry to God to act in deliverance, there is no guarantee that he will. Repentance will not persuade God to be gracious, since he is free to give or withhold grace as he chooses. In the end, the possibility is that God has finally rejected his people and may not again deliver them: if God is predictable, then God is just a tool of humans. Nevertheless, it also affirms confidence that the mercies of Yahweh (the God of Israel) never end, but are new every morning (3:22–33).

The Book of Lamentations is recited annually by Jews on Tisha b'Av (Ninth of Av), the anniversary of the destruction of both of the Jewish Temples.

In <a href="Western%20Christianity">Western Christianity</a>, readings, chantings, and choral settings of the book are used in the <a href="Lent">Lent</a>en religious service known as the <a href="Tenebrae%20%28Maundy%29">Tenebrae</a> (Latin for "darkness"). In the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, readings are used at <a href="Morning%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Morning</a> and <a href="Evening%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Evening Prayer</a> on the <a href="Holy%20Monday">Monday</a> and <a href="Holy%20Tuesday">Tuesday</a> of <a href="Holy%20Week">Holy Week</a>, and at Evening Prayer on <a href="Good%20Friday">Good Friday</a>.

In the <a href="Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church">Coptic Orthodox Church</a>, the book's third chapter is chanted on the twelfth hour of the Good Friday service, that commemorates the burial of Jesus.

Book of Ezekiel

The Book of Ezekiel is the third of the <a href="Nevi%27im%23Latter%20Prophets">Latter Prophets</a> in the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Tanakh</a> and one of the <a href="Major%20Prophets">major prophetic</a> books in the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>, following <a href="Book%20of%20Isaiah">Isaiah</a> and <a href="book%20of%20Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>. According to the book itself, it records six visions of the prophet <a href="Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a>, exiled in Babylon, during the 22 years 593–571 BCE, although it is the product of a long and complex history and does not necessarily preserve the very words of the prophet.

The visions, and the book, are structured around three themes: (1) Judgment on Israel (chapters 1–24); (2) Judgment on the nations (chapters 25–32); and (3) Future blessings for Israel (chapters 33–48). Its themes include the concepts of the presence of God, purity, Israel as a divine community, and individual responsibility to God. Its later influence has included the development of mystical and apocalyptic traditions in <a href="Second%20Temple%20Judaism">Second Temple</a> and <a href="rabbinic%20Judaism">rabbinic Judaism</a> and Christianity.

Ezekiel has the broad three-fold structure found in a number of the prophetic books: oracles of woe against the prophet's own people, followed by oracles against Israel's neighbours, ending in prophecies of hope and salvation:

The book opens with a vision of <a href="Tetragrammaton">YHWH</a> (), one of the <a href="Names%20of%20God%20in%20Judaism">Names of God</a>; moves on to anticipate the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple, explains this as God's punishment, and closes with the promise of a new beginning and a <a href="Third%20Temple">new Temple</a>.

Some of the highlights include:


The Book of Ezekiel describes itself as the words of the <a href="Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a> ben-Buzi, a priest living in exile in the city of <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a> between 593 and 571 BCE. Most scholars today accept the basic authenticity of the book, but see in it significant additions by a "school" of later followers of the original prophet. While the book exhibits considerable unity and probably reflects much of the historic Ezekiel, it is the product of a long and complex history and does not necessarily preserve the very words of the prophet.

According to the book that bears his name, Ezekiel ben-Buzi was born into a priestly family of Jerusalem c.623 BCE, during the reign of the reforming king <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a>. Prior to this time, Judah had been a vassal of the <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>n empire, but the rapid decline of Assyria after c. 630 led Josiah to assert his independence and institute a religious reform stressing loyalty to <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a>, the national God of Israel. Josiah was killed in 609 and Judah became a vassal of the new regional power, the <a href="Neo-Babylonian%20empire">Neo-Babylonian empire</a>. In 597, following a rebellion against Babylon, Ezekiel was among the large group of Judeans taken into captivity by the Babylonians. He appears to have spent the rest of his life in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. A further deportation of Jews from Jerusalem to Babylon occurred in 586 when a second unsuccessful rebellion resulted in the destruction of the city and its Temple and the exile of the remaining elements of the royal court, including the last scribes and priests. The various dates given in the book suggest that Ezekiel was 25 when he went into exile, 30 when he received his prophetic call, and 52 at the time of the last vision c.571.

The Jewish scriptures were translated into Greek in the two centuries immediately before the birth of Christ. The Greek version of these books is called the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>. The Jewish Bible in Hebrew is called the <a href="Masoretic%20text">Masoretic text</a> (meaning "passing down" after a Hebrew word "Masorah"; for Jewish scholars and rabbis curated and commented on the text). The Greek (Septuagint) version of Ezekiel differs considerably from the Hebrew (Masoretic) version – it is shorter and possibly represents an early interpretation of the book we have today (according to the masoretic tradition) – while other ancient manuscript fragments differ from both.

The first half of the 20th century saw several attempts to deny the authorship and authenticity of the book, with scholars such as <a href="Charles%20Cutler%20Torrey">C.C. Torrey</a> (1863–1956) and <a href="Morton%20Smith">Morton Smith</a> placing it variously in the 3rd century BCE and in the 8th/7th. The pendulum swung back in the <a href="post-war%20period">post-war period</a>, with an increasing acceptance of the book's essential unity and historical placement in the Exile. The most influential modern scholarly work on Ezekiel, <a href="Walther%20Zimmerli">Walther Zimmerli</a>'s two-volume commentary, appeared in German in 1969 and in English in 1979 and 1983. Zimmerli traces the process by which Ezekiel's oracles were delivered orally and transformed into a written text by the prophet and his followers through a process of ongoing re-writing and re-interpretation. He isolates the oracles and speeches behind the present text, and traces Ezekiel's interaction with a mass of mythological, legendary and literary material as he developed his insights into Yahweh's purposes during the period of destruction and exile.

As a priest, Ezekiel is fundamentally concerned with the "<a href="K-B-D">Kavod YHWH</a>", a technical phrase meaning the presence (shekhinah) of <a href="YHWH">YHWH</a> (i.e., one of the <a href="Names%20of%20God%20in%20Judaism">Names of God</a>) among the people, in the Tabernacle, and in the Temple, and normally translated as "glory of God". In Ezekiel the phrase describes God mounted on his throne-chariot as he departs from the Temple in chapters 1–11 and returns to what Marvin Sweeney describes as a portrayal of "the establishment of the new temple in Zion as YHWH returns to the temple, which then serves as the center for a new creation with the tribes of Israel arrayed around it" in chapters 40–48. The vision in chapters 1:4–28 reflects common mythological/Biblical themes and the imagery of the Temple: God appears in a cloud from the north – the north being the usual home of God/the gods in ancient mythology and Biblical literature – with four living creatures corresponding to the two <a href="cherubim">cherubim</a> above the Mercy Seat of the Ark of the Covenant and the two in the Holy of Holies, the innermost chamber of the Temple; the burning coals of fire between the creatures perhaps represents the fire on the sacrificial altar, and the famous "wheel within a wheel" may represent the rings by which the Levites carried the Ark, or the wheels of the cart.

Ezekiel depicts the destruction of Jerusalem as a purificatory sacrifice upon the altar, made necessary by the "abominations" in the Temple (the presence of idols and the worship of the god <a href="Tammuz%20%28deity%29">Tammuz</a>) described in chapter 8. The process of purification begins, God prepares to leave, and a priest lights the sacrificial fire to the city. Nevertheless, the prophet announces that a small remnant will remain true to Yahweh in exile, and will return to the purified city. The image of the valley of dry bones returning to life in chapter 37 signifies the restoration of the purified Israel.

Previous prophets had used "Israel" to mean the northern kingdom and its tribes; when Ezekiel speaks of Israel he is addressing the deported remnant of Judah; at the same time, however, he can use this term to mean the glorious future destiny of a truly comprehensive "Israel". In sum, the book describes God's promise that the people of Israel will maintain their covenant with God when they are purified and receive a "new heart" (another of the book's images) which will enable them to observe God's commandments and live in the land in a proper relationship with Yahweh.

The theology of Ezekiel is notable for its contribution to the emerging notion of individual responsibility to God – each man would be held responsible only for his own sins. This is in marked contrast to the <a href="Deuteronomist">Deuteronomist</a>ic writers, who held that the sins of the nation would be held against all, without regard for an individual's personal guilt. Nonetheless, Ezekiel shared many ideas in common with the Deuteronomists, notably the notion that God works according to the principle of <a href="retributive%20justice">retributive justice</a> and an ambivalence towards kingship (although the Deuteronomists reserved their scorn for individual kings rather than for the office itself). As a priest, Ezekiel praises the <a href="Zadokite">Zadokite</a>s over the <a href="Levite">Levite</a>s (lower level temple functionaries), whom he largely blames for the destruction and exile. He is clearly connected with the <a href="Holiness%20Code">Holiness Code</a> and its vision of a future dependent on keeping the Laws of God and maintaining ritual purity. Notably, Ezekiel blames the Babylonian exile not on the people's failure to keep the Law, but on their worship of gods other than Yahweh and their injustice: these, says Ezekiel in chapters 8–11, are the reasons God's <a href="Shekhinah">Shekhinah</a> left his city and his people.

Ezekiel's imagery provided much of the basis for the <a href="Second%20Temple">Second Temple</a> mystical tradition in which the visionary ascended through the <a href="Seven%20Heavens">Seven Heavens</a> in order to experience the presence of God and understand his actions and intentions. The book's literary influence can be seen in the later <a href="Apocalyptic%20literature">apocalyptic</a> writings of Daniel and Zechariah. He is specifically mentioned by Ben Sirah (a writer of the Hellenistic period who listed the "great sages" of Israel) and 4 Maccabees (1st century CE). In the 1st century CE the historian <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a> said that the prophet wrote two books: he may have had in mind the <a href="Apocryphon%20of%20Ezekiel">Apocryphon of Ezekiel</a>, a 1st-century BCE text that expands on the doctrine of resurrection. Ezekiel appears only briefly in the <a href="Dead%20Sea%20Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a>, but his influence there was profound, most notably in the <a href="Temple%20Scroll">Temple Scroll</a> with its temple plans, and the defence of the <a href="Zadok">Zadok</a>ite priesthood in the <a href="Damascus%20Document">Damascus Document</a>. There was apparently some question concerning the inclusion of Ezekiel in the canon of scripture, since it is frequently at odds with the <a href="Torah">Torah</a> (the five "Books of Moses" which are foundational to Judaism).

Ezekiel is referenced more in the <a href="Book%20of%20Revelation">Book of Revelation</a> than in any other New Testament writing. To take just two well-known passages, the famous <a href="Gog%20and%20Magog">Gog and Magog</a> prophecy in Revelation 20:8 refers back to Ezekiel 38–39, and in Revelation 21–22, as in the closing visions of Ezekiel, the prophet is transported to a high mountain where a heavenly messenger measures the symmetrical new Jerusalem, complete with high walls and twelve gates, the dwelling-place of God where his people will enjoy a state of perfect well-being. Apart from Revelation, however, where Ezekiel is a major source, there is very little allusion to the prophet in the New Testament; the reasons for this are unclear, but it can be assumed that not every Christian or <a href="Hellenistic%20Judaism">Hellenistic Jewish</a> community in the 1st century would have had a complete set of (Hebrew) scripture scrolls, and in any case Ezekiel was under suspicion of encouraging dangerous mystical speculation, as well as being sometimes obscure, incoherent, and pornographic.

Big Brother (franchise)

Big Brother is a <a href="Reality%20television%23Reality%20competition/game%20shows">reality game show</a> franchise created by <a href="John%20de%20Mol%20Jr.">John de Mol Jr.</a>, originally broadcast in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and subsequently <a href="Broadcast%20syndication">syndicated</a> internationally. , there have been 387 seasons of "Big Brother" in over 54 franchise countries and regions.

In the show, contestants called "housemates" (or "house guests") live together in a specially-constructed house that is isolated from the outside world. Housemates are voted out (usually on a weekly basis) until only one remains and wins the cash prize. During their stay in the house, contestants are continuously monitored by live television cameras as well as personal audio microphones.

English-language editions of the program are often referred to as "BB". Many Spanish-language editions of the program are called "Gran Hermano" (GH).
At regular intervals, the housemates privately nominate a number of their fellow housemates whom they wish to be evicted from the house. The housemates with the most nominations are then announced, and viewers are given the opportunity to <a href="televoting">vote via telephone</a> for the nominee they wish to be evicted. The last person remaining is declared the winner.

Some more recent editions have since included additional methods of voting, such as voting through social media and smartphone applications. Occasionally, non-standard votes occur, where two houseguests are evicted at once or no one is voted out. In the earlier series of "Big Brother", there were 10 contestants with evictions every two weeks. However, the UK version introduced a larger number of contestants with weekly evictions. Most versions of "Big Brother" follow the weekly eviction format, broadcast over approximately three months for 16 contestants.

The contestants are required to do housework and are assigned tasks by the producers of the show (who communicate with the housemates via the omnipresent authority figure known to them only as "Big Brother"). The tasks are designed to test their teamwork abilities and community spirit. In some countries, the housemates' shopping budget or weekly allowance (to buy food and other essentials) depends on the outcome of assigned tasks.

The term "Big Brother" originates from <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell's</a> novel "<a href="Nineteen%20Eighty-Four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a>," with its theme of continuous oppressive surveillance. The program also relies on other techniques, such as a stripped back-to-basic environment, evictions, weekly tasks and competitions set by "Big Brother", and the "Diary Room" (or "Confession Room") where housemates convey their private thoughts to the camera and reveal their nominees for eviction.

The first version of "Big Brother" was broadcast in 1999 on <a href="Veronica%20%28TV%20channel%29">Veronica</a> in the <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Netherlands%29">Netherlands</a>. In the first season of "Big Brother", the house was very basic. Although essential amenities such as running water, furniture and a limited ration of food were provided, luxury items were often forbidden. This added a <a href="survivalist">survivalist</a> element to the show, increasing the potential for social tension. Nearly all later series provide a modern house for the contest with a jacuzzi, sauna, VIP suite, <a href="loft">loft</a> and other luxuries.

The format has become an international TV franchise. While each country or region has its own variation, the common theme is that the contestants are confined to the house and have their every action recorded by cameras and microphones, and that no contact with the outside world is permitted.

Most international versions of the show remain quite similar to each other: their main format remains true to the original <a href="fly%20on%20the%20wall">fly on the wall</a> observational style with the emphasis on human relationships, to the extent that contestants usually are forbidden from discussing nominations or voting strategy. In 2001, the <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">US version</a> adopted a different format during its second season, where the contestants are encouraged to strategize to advance in the game; in this format the contestants themselves vote to evict each other. In 2011, the <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">UK version</a> controversially adapted the discussion of nominations before reversing this rule after a poll by "Big Brother" broadcaster <a href="Channel%205%20%28UK%29">Channel 5</a>.

From a sociological and demographic perspective, "Big Brother" allows an analysis of how people react when forced into close confinement with people outside of their <a href="comfort%20zone">comfort zone</a> (having different opinions or ideals, or from a different socioeconomic group). The viewer has the opportunity to see how a person reacts from the outside (through the constant recording of their actions) and the inside (in the Diary or Confession Room). The Diary Room is where contestants can privately express their feelings about the game, strategy and the other contestants. The results range from violent or angry confrontations to genuine and tender connections (often including romantic interludes).

The show is notable for involving the <a href="Internet">Internet</a>. Although the show typically broadcasts daily updates during the evening (sometimes criticized by viewers and former contestants for heavy editing by producers), viewers can also watch a continuous feed from multiple cameras on the Web in most countries. These websites were successful, even after some national series began charging for access to the video stream. In some countries, Internet broadcasting was supplemented by updates via email, <a href="Wireless%20Application%20Protocol">WAP</a> and <a href="Text%20messaging">SMS</a>. The house is shown live on <a href="satellite%20television">satellite television</a>, although in some countries there is a 10–15 minute delay to allow libelous or unacceptable content (such as references to people not participating in the program who have not consented to having personal information broadcast) to be removed.

Contestants occasionally develop sexual relationships; the level of sexual explicitness allowed to be shown in broadcast and Internet-feed varies according to the country's broadcasting standards.

"Big Brother" contestants are isolated in the house, without access to television, radio or the Internet. They are not permitted routine communication with the outside world. This was an important issue for most earlier series of the show. In more-recent series, contestants are occasionally allowed to view televised events (usually as a reward for winning at a task). In most versions of the program, books and writing materials are also forbidden, although exceptions are sometimes made for religious materials such as the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>, <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> or the <a href="Qur%27an">Qur'an</a>. Some versions ban all writing implements, even items that can be used to write (such as lipstick or eyeliner). Despite the housemates' isolation, some contestants are occasionally allowed to leave the house as part of tasks. Contestants are permitted to leave the house in an emergency.

Contestants have regularly-scheduled interactions with the show's host on eviction nights. Throughout each day, the program's producer, in the "Big Brother" voice, issues directives and commands to contestants. Some versions of the show allow private counseling sessions with a psychologist. These are allowed at any time, and are often conducted by telephone from the Diary Room.

Due to the intelligibility of certain languages across several nations, it has been possible to make regional versions of "Big Brother". All of these follow the normal "Big Brother" rules, except that contestants must come from each of the countries in the region where it airs: "<a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Albanian%20TV%20series%29">Big Brother Albania</a>" of <a href="Albania">Albania</a> and <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>, "<a href="Big%20Brother%20Angola%20%26amp%3B%20Mozambique">Big Brother Angola e Moçambique</a>" of <a href="Angola">Angola</a> and <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, "<a href="Big%20Brother%20Africa">Big Brother Africa</a>" of Africa (includes Angola, <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a>, <a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>, <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>, <a href="Malawi">Malawi</a>, Mozambique, <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>, <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, <a href="Rwanda">Rwanda</a>, <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>, <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a> and <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>), of the Middle East (includes <a href="Bahrain">Bahrain</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>, <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>, <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, <a href="Oman">Oman</a>, <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>), "<a href="Gran%20Hermano%20%28Pacific%29">Gran Hermano del Pacífico</a>" of South America (includes <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> and <a href="Peru">Peru</a>), "<a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Sweden%20and%20Norway%29">Big Brother</a>" of Scandinavia (includes <a href="Norway">Norway</a> and <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>) and "<a href="Veliki%20brat%202011">Veliki brat</a>" of the Balkans (includes <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>, <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and <a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Macedonia</a>). The British version of the show accepts Irish applicants and was available between 2000 and 2010 as Channel 4 was available; the show returned to Irish screens as TV3 bought the rights from UK broadcaster Channel 5 to air the show.

On the other hand, some countries have multiple franchises based on language. India has Hindi, Telugu, Bengali, Tamil and Kannada language versions; Canada has French- and English-language versions; and the United States has English- and Spanish-language versions of the show.

In 2001, "<a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Netherlands%29%23Season%203">Big Brother 3</a>" of the Netherlands introduced the "Rich and Poor" concept, wherein the house is separated into a luxurious half and a poor half and two teams of housemates compete for a place in the luxurious half. The Dutch version continued this concept until its <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Netherlands%29%23Season%204">fourth season</a>. Other versions later followed and introduced a similar concept, of which some have their own twists: <a href="Big%20Brother%20Africa">Africa</a> (in <a href="Big%20Brother%20Africa%205">2010</a>, <a href="Big%20Brother%20Africa%206">2011</a>, <a href="Big%20Brother%20Africa%207">2012</a> and <a href="Big%20Brother%20Africa%208">2013</a>), <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Albania%29">Albania</a> (in <a href="Big%20Brother%203%20%28Albania%29">2010</a>), <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Australian%20TV%20series%29">Australia</a> (in <a href="Big%20Brother%203%20%28Australia%29">2003</a> and <a href="Big%20Brother%2010%20%28Australia%29">2013</a>), <a href="Veliki%20Brat">Balkan States</a> (in <a href="Veliki%20Brat%20VIP%204">VIP 2010</a> and <a href="Veliki%20brat%202011">2011</a>), <a href="Big%20Brother%20Brasil">Brazil</a> (in <a href="Big%20Brother%20Brasil%209">2009</a>, <a href="Big%20Brother%20Brasil%2010">2010</a>, <a href="Big%20Brother%20Brasil%2011">2011</a>, <a href="Big%20Brother%20Brasil%2013">2013</a> and <a href="Big%20Brother%20Brasil%2014">2014</a>), <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Canada%29">Canada</a> (<a href="Big%20Brother%201%20%28Canada%29">2013</a>–present), <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Denmark%29">Denmark</a> (in <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Denmark%29%23Big%20Brother%203">2003</a>), <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Finland%29">Finland</a> (in <a href="Big%20Brother%202009%20%28Finland%29">2009</a> and <a href="Big%20Brother%202014%20%28Finland%29">2014</a>), <a href="France">France</a> (in <a href="Secret%20Story%203%20%28France%29">2009</a>, <a href="Secret%20Story%205%20%28France%29">2011</a>–present), <a href="Big%20Brother%20Germany">Germany</a> (in <a href="Big%20Brother%20Germany%20%28Season%204%29">2003</a>, <a href="Big%20Brother%20Germany%20%28Season%205%29">2004–05</a>, <a href="Big%20Brother%20Germany%20%28Season%206%29">2005–06</a>, <a href="Big%20Brother%20Germany%20%28Season%208%29">2008</a> and <a href="Big%20Brother%20Germany%20%28Season%209%29">2008–09</a>), <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Greece%29">Greece</a> (in <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Greece%29%23Season%203">2003</a>), <a href="Bigg%20Boss">India</a> (in <a href="Bigg%20Boss%206">2012</a> and <a href="Bigg%20Boss%207">2013</a>), <a href="HaAh%20HaGadol">Israel</a> (in <a href="HaAh%20HaGadol%202">2009</a>), <a href="Grande%20Fratello">Italy</a> (in <a href="Grande%20Fratello%20Season%206">2006</a> and <a href="Grande%20Fratello%20Season%207">2007</a>), <a href="Big%20Brother%20Norway">Norway</a> (in <a href="Big%20Brother%20Norway%23Big%20Brother%203%20-%20Next%20Generation">2003</a>), <a href="Pinoy%20Big%20Brother">Philippines</a> (in , and ), <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Poland%29">Poland</a> (in <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Poland%29%23Season%203">2002</a>), <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Portugal%29">Portugal</a> (in <a href="Big%20Brother%20VIP%20%28Portugal%29">VIP 2013</a> and <a href="Secret%20Story%206%20%28Portugal%29">2016</a>), <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Slovakia%29">Slovakia</a> (in <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Slovakia%29">2005</a>), <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Slovenia%29">Slovenia</a> (in <a href="Big%20Brother%20Slovenia%20Season%202">2008</a>, <a href="Big%20Brother%203%20%28Slovenia%29">2015</a> and <a href="Big%20Brother%204%20%28Slovenia%29">2016</a>), <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Sweden%20and%20Norway%29">Scandinavia</a> (in <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Sweden%20and%20Norway%29%23Season%20one">2005</a>), <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28South%20Africa%29">South Africa</a> (in <a href="Big%20Brother%20Mzansi%203%20%28South%20Africa%29">2014</a>), <a href="Gran%20Hermano%20%28Spain%29">Spain</a> (in <a href="Gran%20Hermano%20Spain%20%28VIP%20Season%201%29">VIP 2004</a>, <a href="Gran%20Hermano%20Spain%20%28Season%2010%29">2008</a>, <a href="Gran%20Hermano%20Spain%20%28Season%2011%29">2009–10</a> and <a href="Gran%20Hermano%20Spain%20%28Season%2012%29">2010</a>), <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28UK%29">United Kingdom</a> (in <a href="Big%20Brother%203%20%28UK%29">2002</a>, <a href="Celebrity%20Big%20Brother%205%20%28UK%29">Celebrity 2007</a>, <a href="Big%20Brother%209%20%28UK%29">2008</a>, <a href="Celebrity%20Big%20Brother%2011%20%28UK%29">Celebrity 2013</a> and <a href="Big%20Brother%2017%20%28UK%29">2016</a>) and <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28U.S.%29">United States</a> (<a href="Big%20Brother%2011%20%28U.S.%29">2009</a>–present).

In 2011–12, the <a href="Gran%20Hermano%20Argentina%20%28season%207%29">seventh Argentine series</a> added "La Casa de al Lado" ("The House Next Door"), a smaller, more luxurious house which served multiple functions. The first week it hosted 4 potential housemates, and the public voted for two of them to enter the main house. The second week, two pairs of twins competed in the same fashion, with only one pair allowed in. Later, the 3rd, 4th and 5th evicted contestants were given the choice of staying on their way out and they competed for the public's vote to reenter the house. Months later, after one of the contestants left the house voluntarily, the House Next Door reopened for four contestants who wanted to reenter and had not been in such a playoff before. The House Next Door was also used in other occasions to accommodate contestants from the main house for limited periods of time, especially to have more privacy (which of course could be seen by the public).

The <a href="Big%20Brother%20Brasil%209">ninth Brazilian season</a> featured the "Bubble": a glass house in a <a href="shopping%20mall">shopping mall</a> in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> where four potential housemates lived for a week. Later in the season a bubble was built inside the Big Brother house, with another two housemates living in it for a week until they were voted in and the glass house dismantled. The Glass House was reused in the <a href="Big%20Brother%20Brasil%2011">eleventh season</a>, featuring five evicted housemates competing for a chance to join the house again, and in the <a href="Big%20Brother%20Brasil%2013">thirteenth season</a>, with six potential housemates competing for two places in the main house. A dividing wall from the ninth season was reused in the <a href="Big%20Brother%20Brasil%2014">fourteenth Brazilian season</a>, when mothers and aunts of the housemates entered for <a href="International%20Women%27s%20Day">International Women's Day</a> and stayed in the house for 6 days, though they could not be seen by the housemates.

In the <a href="Big%20Brother%20Canada%20%28season%204%29">fourth English-Canadian season</a>, two house guests were evicted and moved into a special suite where they were able to watch the remaining house guests. A week later, the house guests were required to unanimously decide which of them to bring back into the house.

In 2004, the <a href="Big%20Brother%205%20%28UK%29">fifth UK series</a> introduced an villainous Big Brother with harsher punishments, such as taking away prize money, more difficult tasks and secret tricks. This concept has also been used in Australia, <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a href="Finland">Finland</a>, Germany, <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>, Spain, <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> and <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>.

In 2004, the <a href="Big%20Brother%205%20%28U.S.%29">fifth US season</a> introduced twins who were tasked with secretly switching back and forth in the house; they were allowed to play the game as individual house guests after succeeding at the deception for five weeks. This twist was reused in the <a href="Big%20Brother%2017%20%28U.S.%29">seventeenth US season</a> with an easier task of successfully changing places for five weeks without being "evicted".

This twin or triplet twist was used in several countries. Some made modifications to this twist; others have had twins in the house together without this element of secrecy. The following are the countries that have featured twins or triplets: Australia (in <a href="Big%20Brother%205%20%28Australia%29">2005</a>), Germany (in <a href="Big%20Brother%20Germany%20%28Season%206%29">2005–06</a>), Bulgaria (in <a href="Big%20Brother%203%20%28Bulgaria%29">2006</a>, <a href="Big%20Brother%20All%20Stars%202012%20%28Bulgaria%29">2012</a> and <a href="VIP%20Brother%209">VIP 2017</a>), United Kingdom (in <a href="Big%20Brother%208%20%28UK%29">2007</a>, <a href="Celebrity%20Big%20Brother%208%20%28UK%29">Celebrity 2011</a>, <a href="Celebrity%20Big%20Brother%209%20%28UK%29">Celebrity 2012</a>, <a href="Big%20Brother%2014%20%28UK%29">2013</a>, <a href="Big%20Brother%2016%20%28UK%29">2015</a>, <a href="Big%20Brother%2017%20%28UK%29">2016</a> and <a href="Celebrity%20Big%20Brother%2019%20%28UK%29">Celebrity 2017</a>), France (in <a href="Secret%20Story%202007%20%28France%29">2007</a>, <a href="Secret%20Story%202011%20%28France%29">2011</a>, <a href="Secret%20Story%207%20%28France%29">2013</a>, <a href="Secret%20Story%209%20%28France%29">2015</a> and <a href="Secret%20Story%2010%20%28France%29">2016</a>), Spain (in <a href="Gran%20Hermano%20Spain%20%28season%209%29">2007</a> and <a href="Gran%20Hermano%2014%20%28Spain%29">2013</a>), Poland (in <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Poland%29%23Season%204">2007</a>), India (in <a href="Bigg%20Boss%20%28Season%202%29%23Sana%20Wadiwala">2008</a>), Africa (in <a href="Big%20Brother%20Africa%204">2009</a>), Balkan Region (in <a href="Veliki%20brat%202009">2009</a> and <a href="Veliki%20Brat%20VIP%205">2013</a>), Philippines (in , and ), Portugal (in <a href="Secret%20Story%202010%20%28Portugal%29">2010</a> and <a href="Secret%20Story%203%20%28Portugal%29">2012</a>), Israel (in <a href="HaAh%20HaGadol%203">2011</a>), Ukraine (in <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Ukraine%29">2011</a>), Argentina (in <a href="Gran%20Hermano%20Argentina%20%28season%207%29">2011</a> and <a href="Gran%20Hermano%20Argentina%20%28season%209%29">2016</a>) and Albania (in <a href="Big%20Brother%206%20%28Albania%29">2013</a>).

During the tenth week of the <a href="Big%20Brother%207%20%28UK%29">seventh UK series</a>, the housemates were paired with their "best friend" in the house and had to nominate and face eviction as couples. The <a href="Big%20Brother%209%20%28U.S.%29">ninth US season</a> added a romantic theme by pairing up the housemates and having them compete as couples. In the of the Philippine version, two housemates related by profession or family played as one, while on their , The second season of the also featured the parents or guardians of the teens staying in the house; if a teen housemate was evicted, the coinciding parent or guardian would also be evicted. The <a href="Big%20Brother%2013%20%28U.S.%29">thirteenth US season</a> introduced Dynamic Duos, where contestants formed pairs that would be nominated together; the nominee not evicted would be immune from further nomination until the final 10 when pairs were dissolved. The <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Greece%29%23Season%204%20%282005%29">fourth Greek season</a> was dubbed "Big Mother", and featured nine housemates accompanied by their mothers. In the ninth season of Indian "Bigg Boss: Double Trouble", contestants entered the house tied up in pairs by the waist. They had joint chairs, beds, spoons, and even mugs. In the <a href="Big%20Brother%209%20%28Albania%29">ninth Albania series</a> all the housemates where in couples and for the first time in the history of "Big Brother" the winner will be only a couple and that couple was Danjel Dedndreaj & Fotini Derxho.

Secret missions are a common element of the show since their introduction during the <a href="Big%20Brother%206%20%28UK%29">sixth UK series</a>. During these missions, one or more housemates are set a task from Big Brother with the reward of luxuries for the household and/or a personal reward if the task is successful. Some versions of Big Brother have secret tasks presented by another character who lives in plain sight of the housemate. Such characters include Marsha the Moose (from BB Canada) and Surly the Fish (from BB Australia).

The <a href="Big%20Brother%208%20%28U.S.%29">eighth US season</a> introduced "America's Player", where a selected house guest must complete various tasks (determined by public vote) in secret for the duration of their stay in the house in exchange for a cash reward. It was repeated in the <a href="Big%20Brother%2010%20%28U.S.%29">tenth US season</a> for a week. The <a href="Big%20Brother%2011%20%28U.S.%29">eleventh US season</a> featured Pandora's Box, in which the winning head of household was tempted to open a box, with unintended consequences for the house. The <a href="Big%20Brother%2012%20%28U.S.%29">twelfth US season</a> featured a saboteur, who entered the house to wreak havoc with tasks suggested by viewers. The <a href="Big%20Brother%2016%20%28U.S.%29">sixteenth US season</a> featured "Team America", in which 3 houseguests were selected to work as a team to complete tasks (determined by public voting) for a cash reward; this continued for the entire season despite the eviction of a team member.

The <a href="Gran%20Hermano%20Argentina%23Season%204">fourth Argentine series</a> added a telephone in the living room. This telephone rang once a week for ten seconds, and the person to pick up the receiver was given an order or news from Big Brother (which typically no other housemate could hear). The order could be beneficial or detrimental, but a refused order resulted in nomination for eviction. If nobody picked up the call, the whole house would be nominated for eviction.

Since "<a href="Big%20Brother%202%20%28UK%29">Big Brother 2</a>", the <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28UK%29">UK series</a> has opened with a twist. This has included having three finalists ("Big Brother 2"); public voting for least-favourite housemates, with the housemates choosing between two nominees to evict ("Big Brother 3"); first-night nominations ("<a href="Big%20Brother%204%20%28UK%29">Big Brother 4</a>"); suitcase nominations ("Big Brother 5"); Unlucky Housemate 13 ("Big Brother 6"); Big Brother Hood ("<a href="Big%20Brother%207%20%28UK%29">Big Brother 7</a>"); an all-female house and a set of twins as contestants ("<a href="Big%20Brother%202007%20%28UK%29">Big Brother 8</a>"); a couple entering as housemates, who must hide their relationship ("<a href="Big%20Brother%209%20%28UK%29">Big Brother 9</a>"); housemates having to earn housemate status ("<a href="Big%20Brother%2010%20%28UK%29">Big Brother 10</a>"); a <a href="Mole%20%28espionage%29">mole</a> entering the house with an impossible task ("<a href="Big%20Brother%2011%20%28UK%29">Big Brother 11</a>"); <a href="Pamela%20Anderson">Pamela Anderson</a> entering as a guest for 5 days (<a href="Big%20Brother%2012%20%28UK%29">Big Brother 12</a>); first-night nominations and a public vote for a wildcard to become a housemate (<a href="Big%20Brother%2013%20%28UK%29">Big Brother 13</a>); a professional actor posing as a housemate and a mother and daughter as contestants (<a href="Big%20Brother%2014%20%28UK%29">Big Brother 14</a>); one contestant gets a pass to the final (<a href="Big%20Brother%2015%20%28UK%29">Big Brother 15</a>); first night eviction (<a href="Big%20Brother%2016%20%28UK%29">Big Brother 16</a>); two houses with "the other house" featuring enemies from the main house housemates past (<a href="Big%20Brother%2017%20%28UK%29">Big Brother 17</a>); <a href="Jackie%20Stallone">Jackie Stallone</a> entering a house containing her son's ex-wife <a href="Brigitte%20Nielsen">Brigitte Nielsen</a> ("<a href="Celebrity%20Big%20Brother%203%20%28UK%29">Celebrity Big Brother 3</a>"); a non-celebrity in a celebrity edition ("<a href="Celebrity%20Big%20Brother%204%20%28UK%29">Celebrity Big Brother 4</a>"); a visit from <a href="Jade%20Goody">Jade Goody</a>'s family ("<a href="Celebrity%20Big%20Brother%205%20%28UK%29">Celebrity Big Brother 5</a>") and unlocked bedrooms allowing housemates to immediately claim beds with the last housemate becoming the Head of House ("<a href="Celebrity%20Big%20Brother%206%20%28UK%29">Celebrity Big Brother 6</a>").

A common opening twist is to only introduce cast of a single sex on the premiere of the show while having members of the opposite sex introduced over the next few days. The <a href="Big%20Brother%208%20%28UK%29">eighth UK series</a> first used this twist with an initial all-female house, adding a male housemate two days later. The same twist was used in the (<a href="Big%20Brother%204%20%28Bulgaria%29">fourth Bulgarian series</a>), and an all-male premiere was used on "<a href="Big%20Brother%20Africa%204">Big Brother Africa 4</a>".

The fifth UK series introduced fake evictions, where one or two housemates are "evicted". In the eighth UK series one housemate was evicted, interviewed and sent back into the house.

In the , four housemates were fake-evicted and stayed in a place called "bodega".

In the <a href="Big%20Brother%2010%20%28Australia%29">tenth Australian season</a>, Benjamin Zabel was fake-evicted for 24 hours before being returned to the house with immunity from eviction for that week. In the <a href="Big%20Brother%2011%20%28Australia%29">eleventh Australian season</a> Travis Lunardi was fake-evicted and received advice from Benjamin Zabel for 24 hours; Travis returned to the house after a 3-day absence with immunity from eviction for that week.

In the <a href="Big%20Brother%20Brasil%2013">thirteenth Brazilian series</a>, Anamara Barreira was fake-evicted. She was removed and put into a small private apartment without the other housemates knowing she was still in the house. After 24 hours, she returned to the house as Head of Household and with immunity from eviction that week. In the <a href="Big%20Brother%20Brasil%2016">sixteenth Brazilian series</a>, Ana Paula Renault was similarly fake-evicted, put into a small private apartment, and returned after 48 hours with immunity from eviction that week.

In the <a href="Big%20Brother%20T%C3%BCrkiye">first Turkish series</a>, there is a fake eviction in week 10.

<a href="Big%20Brother%2014%20%28U.S.%29">The fourteenth US season</a> had four house guests from past seasons return to coach twelve new house guests, playing for a separate prize of $100,000. However, in a reset twist, they opted to join the normal game alongside the other house guests.

The seventh Argentine series incorporated a red button into the Confession Room, which would sound an alarm throughout the house. This button was to be used when a contestant wanted to leave the house voluntarily, and the contestant would be given five minutes to leave the house. A red button is also used in "<a href="Secret%20Story%20%28France%29">Secret Story</a>" series, however in this case whoever presses the button will try to guess someone's secret.

In "", evicted housemates were given the opportunity to choose if a "ninja" delivered good or bad gifts to the house. Later that year, the <a href="Big%20Brother%208%20%28Australia%29">eighth Australian series</a> introduced the Housemate Hand Grenade, where an evicted housemate decided which remaining housemate received a penalty. A similar punishment used on "<a href="Big%20Brother%20Africa">Big Brother Africa</a>" was called the Molotov Cocktail, Dagger or Fuse.

The <a href="Big%20Brother%2015%20%28U.S.%29">fifteenth US season</a> allowed viewers to vote for a house guest to be made M.V.P., who then secretly nominates a third house guest for eviction (in addition to the two selected by the Head of Household). In a further twist, the viewers themselves decided who the third nominee would be. Like many such twists, this was ended halfway into the season as the pool of contestants shrank.

The <a href="Big%20Brother%2016%20%28U.S.%29">sixteenth US season</a> and <a href="Big%20Brother%2017%20%28U.S.%29">seventeenth US season</a> featured two Heads of Household every week and had four house guests nominated for eviction. There was also a "Battle of the Block" competition where the two sets of nominees competed to save themselves; the winning pair not only saved themselves but dethroned the Head of Household who nominated them, who was then vulnerable as a replacement nominee if a veto was used. It was also used on Big Brother Brasil 16 and Big Brother Brasil 17 where the HOH's had to nominate one person and they had to choose between 10 thousand dollars or immunity

In 2011, "<a href="Big%20Brother%20Africa%206">Big Brother Africa 6</a>" was the first season of Big Brother to have two winners, each getting US$200,000. In 2015, the , also had two winners; one from the teens and one from the regular adults. Each of which received PHP1,000,000.
Bigg Boss 8 (India) ended with a twist, where the top five contestants were crowned 'champions' . The season was extended by 35 days (total 135) .. as a spin off called Bigg Boss:Halla Bol, where ex contestants from previous seasons entered the house to compete with the five champions.

In 2016, on season 4 of <a href="Big%20Brother%20Canada">Big Brother Canada</a> brothers Nick and Phil Paquette won the season, playing together as one.

The introduced reserved housemates, short-listed auditioners who were given a chance to be a housemate by completing tasks assigned by Big Brother. This was also done in Argentina's <a href="Gran%20Hermano%20Argentina%20%28season%207%29">seventh season</a> and Brazil's <a href="Big%20Brother%20Brasil%209">ninth season</a>.

There were occasions that a former housemate from one franchise participated and competed in a different franchise: Daniela Martins of France (SS3) competed in Portugal (SS1); Daniel Mkongo of France (SS5) competed in Italy (GF12); <a href="Brigitte%20Nielsen">Brigitte Nielsen</a> of Denmark (BB VIP) competed in the United Kingdom (CBB3); <a href="Jade%20Goody">Jade Goody</a> of the United Kingdom (BB3, BB Panto, and CCB5) competed in India (<a href="Bigg%20Boss%202">BB2</a>); Sava Radović of Germany (BB4) competed in the <a href="Balkan%20States">Balkan States</a> (VB1); Nikola Nasteski of the Balkan States (VB4) competed in Bulgaria (BB All-Stars 1); Žarko Stojanović of France (<a href="Secret%20Story%205%20%28France%29">SS5</a>) competed in the Balkan States (<a href="Veliki%20Brat%20VIP%205">VB VIP5</a>); Željko Stojanović of France (<a href="Secret%20Story%205%20%28France%29">SS5</a>) competed in the Balkan States (<a href="Veliki%20Brat%20VIP%205">VB VIP5</a>); Kelly Baron of Brazil (<a href="Big%20Brother%20Brasil%2013">BBB13</a>) competed in Portugal (<a href="Big%20Brother%20VIP%20%28Portugal%29">BB VIP</a>); <a href="Lucy%20Diakovska">Lucy Diakovska</a> of Bulgaria (<a href="VIP%20Brother%204">VIP B4</a>) competed in Germany (<a href="Promi%20Big%20Brother%20%28season%201%29">PBB1</a>); Leila Ben Khalifa of Italy (<a href="Grande%20Fratello%20%28season%206%29">GF6</a>) competed in France (<a href="Secret%20Story%208%20%28France%29">SS8</a>); Priya Malik of Australia (<a href="Big%20Brother%2011%20%28Australia%29">BB11</a>) competed in India (<a href="Bigg%20Boss%209">BB9</a>); Tim Dormer of Australia (<a href="Big%20Brother%2010%20%28Australia%29">BB10</a>) and <a href="Nikki%20Grahame">Nikki Grahame</a> of the United Kingdom (<a href="Big%20Brother%207%20%28UK%29">BB7</a>, <a href="Ultimate%20Big%20Brother">UBB</a>) competed in Canada (<a href="Big%20Brother%20Canada%20%28season%204%29">BB4</a>); Leonel Estevao-Luto of Africa (<a href="Big%20Brother%20Africa%204">BB4</a>) competed in Angola & Mozambique (<a href="Big%20Brother%20Angola%20%26amp%3B%20Mozambique">BB3</a>); <a href="Frankie%20Grande">Frankie Grande</a> of the United States (<a href="Big%20Brother%2016%20%28U.S.%29">BB16</a>) competed in the United Kingdom (<a href="Celebrity%20Big%20Brother%2018%20%28UK%29">CBB18</a>); Fanny Rodrigues of Portugal (<a href="Secret%20Story%202%20%28Portugal%29">SS2</a>) competed in France (<a href="Secret%20Story%2010%20%28France%29">SS10</a>); and Tucha Anita of Angola (<a href="Big%20Brother%20Angola%20%26amp%3B%20Mozambique">BB3</a>); Amor Romeira of Spain (<a href="Gran%20Hermano%20Spain%20%28season%209%29">GH9</a>) competed in Portugal (<a href="Secret%20Story%206%20%28Portugal%29">SS6</a>) and Alain Rochette of Spain (<a href="Gran%20Hermano%2017%20%28Spain%29">GH17</a>) competed in France (<a href="Secret%20Story%2011%20%28France%29">SS11</a>).

The "Big Brother" format has been adapted in some countries; the housemates are local celebrities, and the shows are called "<a href="Celebrity%20Big%20Brother">Celebrity Big Brother</a>" or "Big Brother VIP". In some countries, the prize money normally awarded to the winning housemate is donated to a charity, and all celebrities are paid to appear in the show as long as they do not voluntarily leave before their eviction or the end of the series. The rest of the rules are nearly the same as those of the original version. The celebrity version has become particularly popular in the UK, causing UK broadcaster Channel 5 to extend its deal with Endemol enabling them to air two celebrity series in addition to the civilian version every year from 2012. the UK has aired 20 celebrity series with the current "<a href="Celebrity%20Big%20Brother%2020%20%28UK%29">Celebrity Big Brother</a>" from 1 August 2017. The sure is due to stay on air until at less 2018. In August 2017 the U.K Celebrity series celebrated it's 20th series. In Bulgaria, "<a href="VIP%20Brother">VIP Brother</a>" has replaced the original format of the show and more seasons of the celebrity edition have been produced than the regular one. Due to the show's popularity there, it lasts for two months unlike most countries where it only airs for a month.

The 2006 Netherlands series was entitled "Hotel Big Brother". This variation introduced a group of celebrity hoteliers and a Big Boss, who run a hotel and collect money for charity without nominations, evictions or a winner.

Another variation appeared in the UK in early 2008, entitled "". Instead of being housemates the celebrities became Big Brother himself, creating tasks and holding nominations with the help of Big Brother. The housemates were considered by the producers "Britain's most exceptional and extraordinary" 18- to 21-year-olds. The prize for the winner of the series was £50,000.

In 2009, "<a href="VIP%20Brother%203">VIP Brother 3 Bulgaria</a>" introduced the concept of celebrities competing for charitable causes, which changed each week. Housemates were sometimes allowed to leave the house to raise money for the charity. 
9 out of 10 seasons of "Bigg Boss" (the Indian version of "Big Brother") have been celebrity-only seasons. The 10th season of "Big Boss" had celebrities put up against commoners, where a commoner ultimately won.

The US and Canadian versions of "Big Brother" differ from most global versions of the series. The US series began in 2000 with the original Dutch format—i.e., housemates, or HouseGuests, as they are styled in the US, nominating each other for eviction and the public voting on evictions and the eventual winner. But due to both poor ratings and the concurrent popularity of "<a href="Survivor%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Survivor</a>", a gameplay-oriented format was introduced in the <a href="Big%20Brother%202%20%28U.S.%29">second season</a>, with HouseGuests encouraged to openly strategize and form alliances.

In this format, HouseGuests vote each other out and choose the winner. Each week, one HouseGuest is chosen (usually by competition) as the Head of Household (HoH), who sleeps in a luxurious bedroom and nominates two fellow HouseGuests for eviction in a formal ceremony. HoH also chooses Haves, who enjoy luxury foods and other special privileges, and Have-Nots, who must eat "slop" (a fortified oatmeal), sleep in designated uncomfortable beds, and take cold showers. Before the sixteenth US season, HouseGuests competed in a Have/Have-Not challenge similar to the shopping tasks on Big Brother UK and other international editions.

The winner of the Power of Veto (PoV), introduced in the third US season, has the option to save one nominee (including him/herself) from eviction, forcing the HoH to nominate another HouseGuest in the former nominee's place. The HouseGuests then vote to evict one of the nominees. When only two contestants remain, a jury of the most recently evicted HouseGuests (generally seven or nine) decides which of the two finalists wins the grand prize. Beginning in the fourth (2003) US season, jury members were sequestered off-site so that they would not be privy to the day-to-day goings-on in the house.

In 2013, English-speaking Canada introduced its own version of the show on the cable channel <a href="Slice%20%28TV%20channel%29">Slice</a>; the series moved to <a href="Global%20TV">Global TV</a> for its third (2015) season. The show followed the US format, but with more elaborate twists and greater viewer participation in the game. Secret tasks were introduced, usually presented by the show's mascot, "Marsha the Moose"; also, as in most global franchises, Big Brother was a distinct character who interacted with the HouseGuests. In 2017, Global announced that Big Brother Canada was going "on hiatus." However, Arisa Cox announced that there would be a sixth season of "BBCAN". The <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Quebecer%20TV%20series%29">French Canadian version</a> mostly followed the US/Anglophone Canadian format, but the public could evict a housemate on some occasions and decided the winner.

<a href="Big%20Brother%20Brasil">Big Brother Brasil</a> combines the US/Canada and international formats. Brazil votes on evictions and the winner, but housemates compete for HoH, Power of Immunity, and Haves/Have-Nots. HoH nominates one housemate for eviction, while the rest of the house nominates a second housemate. Power of Immunity is similar to the US/Canada PoV, with the winner getting to choose not only someone to "take off the block" but also someone to punish.

The pilot for <a href="Big%20Brother%20China">Big Brother China</a>, which premiered exclusively online in 2015, had housemates voting on evictions but the public voting for the winner. The same format was used for , an online-only spinoff of the US series that ran in 2016.

The "Big Brother" format has been otherwise modified in some countries:

There are also "test runs", with a group of celebrities (or journalists) living in the house for several days to test it. There are occasions where people who have auditioned for the show are also put in the house, most notably in the British edition, where many housemates claim to have met before. These series have been televised in <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, Bulgaria, the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>, Germany, Mexico, the Pacific region, the Philippines and Spain. In some cases, it is not broadcast, but in others, such as the US edition, it is used as a promotional tool.

As of 30 September 2017, "Big Brother" has produced 411 winners in over 54 franchises. The most recent winner is Nafeez <a href="Arav">Arav</a> Kizar from .

In April 2000, Castaway, an independent production company, filed a lawsuit against John de Mol and Endemol for stealing the concepts of their own show called "<a href="Survivor%20%28TV%20series%29">Survive!</a>", a reality television show where contestants are placed on a deserted island and have to take care of themselves alone. These contestants were also filmed by cameras around them. The court later dismissed the lawsuit filed by Castaway against de Mol and Endemol. The "Survive!" reality television format was later turned into "<a href="Survivor%20%28TV%20series%29">Survivor</a>".

In 2000, the estate of George Orwell sued CBS Television and Endemol for copyright and trademark infringement, claiming that the program infringed on the Orwell novel "Nineteen Eighty-Four" and its trademarks. After a series of court rulings adverse to the defendants (CBS and Endemol), the case was settled for an undisclosed amount of money on the eve of trial.

There have been two documented occurrences of possible rape happening during the show. In "Big Brother South Africa", a male housemate was accused of assaulting a fellow housemate while she was asleep. The pair were filmed kissing and cuddling in bed before the cameras moved away and the male housemate reportedly claimed to housemates the next day that he had intercourse with the contestant. However, the female housemate was apparently shocked by the claims and informed female housemates that she had not consented to having sex with him. (Under South African law, this act would be constituted as rape.) This male housemate was expelled immediately after the allegations surfaced, while the female housemate was removed from the house for her own protection and counselling.

In "Big Brother Brasil", many viewers reported that they watched a male housemate allegedly force himself on a female housemate while she was passed-out drunk after a "boozy party". As a result, the male housemate was later escorted out of the Big Brother house by <a href="Law%20enforcement%20in%20Brazil">the federal police</a>.

Bristol City F.C.

Bristol City Football Club is a professional <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club based in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, England. Their ground is <a href="Ashton%20Gate%20Stadium">Ashton Gate</a>, located in the southwest of the city. They currently play in the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Championship</a>, the second tier of English football, after winning League One during the 2014–15 season. In sealing the League One title, Bristol City became only the second team to win both the third-tier championship and <a href="Football%20League%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> double during the same season.

Bristol City won the <a href="Welsh%20Cup">Welsh Cup</a> – despite being an English club – in 1934. In 1907 they finished runners-up in Football League Division One, which is their highest ever final position. In 1909 they lost the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> final to <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, their only final. Since relegation in 1911, however, they only returned to the top division from 1976 to 1980 and did not contend for any honours then. In 1982, Bristol City became the first English club to suffer three consecutive relegations. They were promoted to the Football League Championship in the 2006–07 season after finishing second in League One but failed to make a second consecutive promotion to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> after they were defeated by <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a> in the <a href="2008%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20Final">2008 Football League Championship play-off Final</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>. With victories in <a href="1986%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">1986</a>, <a href="2003%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">2003</a> and <a href="2015%20Football%20League%20Trophy%20Final">2015</a>, Bristol City are now the most successful team in the <a href="Football%20League%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a>.

The club's nickname is "The Robins", and a <a href="European%20robin">robin</a> featured on the club's <a href="badge">badge</a> from 1976 to 1994. Official club merchandise, including replica kits, still has a label showing a robin. An attempt by the club to alter the badge was abandoned after it was criticised fiercely by fans. The team's main rivals are <a href="Bristol%20Rovers">Bristol Rovers</a> in the <a href="Bristol%20derby">Bristol derby</a> and <a href="Cardiff%20City">Cardiff City</a> in the <a href="Severnside%20derby">Severnside derby</a>, along with other regional teams in the <a href="West%20Country%20derby">West Country derby</a>.

Bristol City's current manager is <a href="Lee%20Johnson%20%28footballer%29">Lee Johnson</a>; a former Bristol City player who made 199 appearances for the club. His father, <a href="Gary%20Johnson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201955%29">Gary</a>, also managed the club and took City to the Championship play-off final in 2008, where they eventually lost 1–0 to <a href="Hull%20City%20F.C.">Hull City</a>.

The club was founded in 1894 as Bristol South End and changed their name to Bristol City on adopting professionalism three years later when they were admitted into the Southern League. Finishing as runners-up in three of the first four seasons, in 1900 the club amalgamated with local Southern League rivals <a href="Bedminster%20F.C.">Bedminster F.C.</a>, who had been founded as Southville in 1887. City joined the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in 1901 when they became only the third club south of Birmingham (following in the footsteps of <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Woolwich Arsenal</a> and <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a>) to perform in the competition. Their first game in the Football League was on 7 September 1901 at <a href="Bloomfield%20Road">Bloomfield Road</a>, when <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a> were beaten 2–0.
Winning the Second Division Championship with a record number of points when they became the first club in Football League history to win 30 games as well as equaling Manchester United's achievement of the previous season in winning 14 consecutive games (still a record today, which was also accomplished by Preston in 1950–51). Nicknamed the Bristol Babe at this time, they finished as runners-up in their inaugural First Division campaign (the only southern club to finish in the top two prior to World War 1). Three years later they won through to their only FA Cup Final, though they were somewhat fortunate that a last gasp spot-kick saved them from defeat in the semi-final versus Derby County at Stamford Bridge. Unfortunately, there was no such similar award to help them in the Final at the Crystal Palace (now the National Sports Centre) as Manchester United took the honours 1–0. After a five-season stay in the top flight, despite winning 1–0 at Newcastle at the start of the 1910–11 campaign, failure to beat Everton in the season's finale brought City's first ever taste of relegation and it was to be 65 years before top flight status would be regained.

The 1920s were a rocky time as City bounced between the Second Division and the Southern Section of the Third Division. By the 1930s they had slumped into the lower division, and stayed that way until the Second World War. <a href="Harry%20Dolman">Harry Dolman</a> became chairman in 1949, a post he would hold for over 30 years. An engineer who had bought out the firm he worked for, he designed the first set of floodlights installed at Ashton Gate in the early 1950s. The late 1950s were a better time for City, with a five-year stay in the Second Division, a league they returned to for a further spell in 1965.

In 1967, <a href="Alan%20Dicks">Alan Dicks</a> was appointed manager, and things gradually began to improve, with promotion to the First Division in 1976, ending a 65-year exile from the top flight.

Between 1975 and 1981 City were regular participants in the <a href="Anglo-Scottish%20Cup">Anglo-Scottish Cup</a>, winning the trophy in 1977–78, beating Hibernian in the semi-finals, and winning 3–2 on aggregate in the final against St Mirren (managed at the time by a relatively new manager, Alex Ferguson). St Mirren had their revenge two seasons later, with an aggregate 5–1 victory over City to become the only Scottish team to win the trophy.

City's second stint in the top flight was less successful than the club's first, with thirteenth position in 1979 being their highest finish during this era. Stars of this era included <a href="Peter%20Cormack">Peter Cormack</a>, <a href="Geoff%20Merrick">Geoff Merrick</a>, <a href="Tom%20Ritchie">Tom Ritchie</a>, <a href="Clive%20Whitehead">Clive Whitehead</a>, <a href="Gerry%20Gow">Gerry Gow</a>, <a href="Trevor%20Tainton">Trevor Tainton</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Mann%20%28footballer%29">Jimmy Mann</a>.

In 1980, the City team went back to the Second Division in the first of three relegations, their debt mounted and their financial losses increased, with two successive relegations following. Thus, in 1982, they fell into the <a href="Football%20League%20Fourth%20Division">Fourth Division</a>, and were declared bankrupt. BCFC (1982) Ltd acquired the club's player contracts, and the highly paid senior players Julian Marshall, <a href="Chris%20Garland">Chris Garland</a>, <a href="Jimmy%20Mann%20%28footballer%29">Jimmy Mann</a>, <a href="Peter%20Aitken">Peter Aitken</a>, <a href="Geoff%20Merrick">Geoff Merrick</a>, <a href="David%20Rodgers">David Rodgers</a>, <a href="Gerry%20Sweeney">Gerry Sweeney</a> and <a href="Trevor%20Tainton">Trevor Tainton</a>, who became known as the 'Ashton Gate Eight', each accepted termination of his contract for half the amount due. The club failed to pay its debts to many local businesses which left the new formed club difficulty in obtaining credit because of bad feeling toward them.

City spent two seasons in the Fourth Division before winning promotion under <a href="Terry%20Cooper%20%28footballer%20born%201944%29">Terry Cooper</a> in 1984. They consolidated themselves in the Third Division during the latter part of the 1980s, and in 1990 Cooper's successor <a href="Joe%20Jordan%20%28footballer%29">Joe Jordan</a> achieved promotion as Third Division runners-up to local rivals Bristol Rovers.

There was a tragedy for the club, however, in that promotion campaign. In March 1990, two months before the club sealed promotion, striker <a href="Dean%20Horrix">Dean Horrix</a> was killed in a car crash barely two weeks after joining the club, and having played three league games for them.

Jordan moved to <a href="Heart%20of%20Midlothian%20F.C.">Heart of Midlothian</a> in September 1990, and his successor <a href="Jimmy%20Lumsden">Jimmy Lumsden</a> remained in charge for 18 months before making way for <a href="Denis%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201947%29">Denis Smith</a>. Smith's first signing was the 20-year-old <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> striker <a href="Andy%20Cole">Andy Cole</a>, who was an instant hit with fans. He was sold to Newcastle United in February 1993 and later established himself as a world class goalscorer, most prominently with Manchester United, where he collected five <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> titles, two <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>s and the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>.

Meanwhile, City remained in the new <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Division One</a> (no longer the Second Division after the creation of the Premier League in 1992) and Smith moved to <a href="Oxford%20United%20F.C.">Oxford United</a> in November 1993. His successor <a href="Russell%20Osman">Russell Osman</a> was sacked within a year, being an unpopular figure with fans. One of Osman's few successful moments with City came in January 1994 when he led them to a shock 1–0 victory over <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a> in a third round replay in the FA Cup, a result that would cause the Liverpool manager at the time, <a href="Graeme%20Souness">Graeme Souness</a>, to resign.

Joe Jordan was brought back to <a href="Ashton%20Gate%20stadium">Ashton Gate</a> in September 1994, but was unable to prevent relegation to Division Two.

Jordan remained at the helm for two seasons after City's relegation, but left in March 1997 after failing to get them back into Division One. Former Bristol Rovers manager <a href="John%20Ward%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201951%29">John Ward</a> took over, and achieved promotion in 1998 as Division Two runners-up. But City struggled back in Division One, and Ward stepped down in October 1998 to be succeeded by <a href="Benny%20Lennartsson">Benny Lennartsson</a>. City were relegated in bottom place and Lennartsson was dismissed in favour of <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham</a>'s <a href="Tony%20Pulis">Tony Pulis</a>, who lasted six months before leaving to take over at Portsmouth. During his time at Ashton Gate he was manager of perhaps the worst City side since the one that completed a hat-trick of successive relegations almost 20 years earlier.

Coach Tony Fawthrop took over until the end of the season, when <a href="Danny%20Wilson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201960%29">Danny Wilson</a> was appointed. Wilson was arguably the most prominent manager to take charge of a City side since <a href="Denis%20Smith%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201947%29">Denis Smith</a>, as he had guided <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a> to promotion to the Premier League in 1997 and <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a> to a 12th-place finish in 1999.

City were regular Division Two playoff contenders during Wilson's spell as manager. City failed to reach them in 2002, although Wilson almost took them to automatic promotion, and winning the <a href="Football%20League%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a> in Cardiff in 2003. The taste of the play-offs was bitter though, losing to rivals <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> 1–0 on aggregate in the semi-final. In his final year – 2004 – they reached the final, but lost to <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton & Hove Albion</a>. He was sacked within days and replaced by veteran player <a href="Brian%20Tinnion">Brian Tinnion</a>.

City just failed to make the playoffs in <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20in%20English%20football">Tinnion's first season</a> as manager, finishing seventh, and he stepped down in September 2005 after a poor start to the season culminating in a 7–1 defeat at the hands of <a href="Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.">Swansea City</a>. City's form had slumped despite the addition of high-profile players, including <a href="Marcus%20Stewart">Marcus Stewart</a> and <a href="Michael%20Bridges">Michael Bridges</a>. <a href="Yeovil%20Town%20F.C.">Yeovil Town</a> manager <a href="Gary%20Johnson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201955%29">Gary Johnson</a> was recruited as his successor.

Johnson arrived in September 2005, making the move from Yeovil Town, with whom he had gained two promotions. His first game in charge (only hours after meeting the squad) saw City win away at Brentford 3–2. After a short spell of decent results, City were plunged into the relegation mire, enduring a club record of nine successive defeats, leaving them at the foot of League One. Much criticism was aimed at Gary Johnson at this time; the Chairman of Bristol City Supporters Club labelled him a 'Conference Manager' and contended that he was 'totally out of his depth'. The run was brought to an end with a 2–0 victory at home to Huddersfield on 10 December. City then lost just three of their next 16 games, and this fine run of form was capped with a 6–0 win over Gillingham, in which defender <a href="Louis%20Carey">Louis Carey</a> scored a brace. This was City's most emphatic league win since beating Charlton by the same score in September 1969, and was an encouraging sign of things to come, although they did not quite make playoffs in 2006.

Despite a slow start to the 2006–07 season, which saw a vocal minority of fans calling for Johnson to be sacked after a 4–2 home defeat by <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a> (who were eventually also promoted), City were in the top six of <a href="Football%20League%20One">League One</a> by November and at the end of the month began an 11-match unbeaten run which drove them to the top of the division. They also hit the headlines with an impressive <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> run, being knocked out in the 4th round on penalties after a replay in which they held Premiership side <a href="Middlesbrough%20F.C.">Middlesbrough</a> to a 2–2 draw in both ties. They knocked out <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Championship</a> side <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a> in the 3rd round. They also reached the Southern Area Final of the Football League Trophy, but were knocked out over two legs by local rivals Bristol Rovers after a 0–0 draw at Ashton Gate and a Rickie Lambert goal condemned the Robins to a 1–0 aggregate defeat in the second leg.

Promotion to the Championship was confirmed on the final day of the season with a 3–1 win against already relegated <a href="Rotherham%20United%20F.C.">Rotherham United</a>. <a href="David%20Noble%20%28English%20footballer%29">David Noble</a> scored two goals and <a href="Alex%20Russell%20%28footballer%20born%201973%29">Alex Russell</a> scored once, securing the runners-up place in the division and resulting in automatic promotion and joyous scenes of celebration in the city and even more so on the pitch at the full-time whistle. 2007–08 was the first season in almost a decade that would see Bristol City playing at this level of English football.

In the summer between City's promotion and the start of the Championship season, Gary Johnson made a number of signings. However their pre-season form did not start well, losing 4–2 to <a href="Forest%20Green%20Rovers%20F.C.">Forest Green Rovers</a>. However, City got off to a good start going unbeaten for a number of matches and briefly topping the Championship after beating Coventry City 3–0. City then suffered a slight blip after losing 3–0 to <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a> before beating a variety of big name teams including <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> live on <a href="Sky%20Sports">Sky Sports</a> and <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>. In November, City's form dipped and they endured a run of four games without a win, including a 6–0 thrashing at the hands of <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>. In December, City's form picked up again and went unbeaten all the way to <a href="Boxing%20Day">Boxing Day</a> when they lost to <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a> 4–1.

After a stop start run of form including victories over Blackpool and Coventry City and losses to <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a> and Crystal Palace, City went top of the Championship on 1 March, after a 2–1 home victory over <a href="Hull%20City%20A.F.C.">Hull City</a>. After some indifferent results City went back to the top after a last gasp winner from <a href="Steve%20Brooker">Steve Brooker</a>, who was just returning from injury, in a 2–1 win over Norwich City. However, a poor run ended City's chances of an automatic <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> place. On 4 May 2008, a 3–0 home win against <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a> on the final day of the league season ensured a play-off place and a semi-final fixture against Crystal Palace. On 13 May 2008, the second leg of a 4–2 aggregate win over Crystal Palace with goals from <a href="Lee%20Trundle">Lee Trundle</a> and <a href="Michael%20McIndoe">Michael McIndoe</a> confirmed City's trip to <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley</a>, where they were beaten 1–0 by Hull City after <a href="Dean%20Windass">Dean Windass</a>' 18 yard strike beat <a href="Adriano%20Basso">Adriano Basso</a> in the 38th minute.

After a poor start in the first half of the 2008–09 season, City recovered after Christmas. After winning 4–2 away at <a href="Watford%20F.C.">Watford</a> on Boxing Day, they took 13 points from five games in early 2009 to reach eighth place in the league by early February. City had a memorable away victory against <a href="Reading%20F.C.">Reading</a> which saw them jump up to their highest position of the season to fourth. After a lot of draws, the season eventually petered out and City finished the season in tenth place.

The <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20in%20English%20football">2009–10 season</a> saw some good results in the autumn, but heavy defeats by <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a> (0–6) and <a href="Doncaster%20Rovers%20F.C.">Doncaster Rovers</a> (2–5) in early 2010 lead to much dissatisfaction amongst fans. On 18 March 2010, the club issued a statement that Johnson had "left his post as manager of Bristol City by mutual consent". Assistant manager <a href="Keith%20Millen">Keith Millen</a> took charge as caretaker manager, starting well with a draw against title favourites Newcastle United and a 5–3 win against Barnsley. After that, City beat <a href="Peterborough%20United%20F.C.">Peterborough United</a> 1–0, which was the first time they had gone three matches unbeaten in the league since the end of October.

In a brief press conference on 22 April 2010, it was announced that former Reading manager <a href="Steve%20Coppell">Steve Coppell</a> would become the new City manager at the end of the 2009–10 campaign, when he would start a 12-month rolling contract, and that Keith Millen, who had guided the club to Championship safety in his brief spell as caretaker manager, would remain at the club as his assistant. Coppell's first game in charge was a 1–1 friendly draw with Swedish side <a href="IFK%20Gothenburg">IFK Gothenburg</a>. His first win as manager was an 11–1 win against Swedish fourth division side Vallens IF on the same pre-season tour.

It was announced on 12 August 2010 that Coppell had resigned as manager with immediate effect saying that he would retire from football management altogether citing a lack of passion for the job. This followed his only two competitive games at the club, a 0–3 home defeat by <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a> in the opening game of the 2010–11 <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Football League Championship</a> and a 2–3 loss at <a href="Football%20League%20Two">League Two</a> <a href="Southend%20United%20F.C.">Southend United</a> in the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Football League Cup</a>.

<a href="Keith%20Millen">Keith Millen</a> was announced as manager of Bristol City on a three-year deal after Coppell stepped down.

Bristol City parted company with manager Keith Millen on 3 October 2011. City struggled to find form at the start of the <a href="2011-12%20Football%20League%20Championship">2011–12 Championship season</a> picking up just 6 points from 10 games. His sacking came after their 5–0 defeat by <a href="Blackpool%20F.C.">Blackpool</a> on 1 October 2011. Millen's last game in charge was his heaviest loss since his appointment the previous year. The club installed Steve Wigley as caretaker manager following Millen's exit and stated that they would take their time in finding a new manager.

On Wednesday, 19 October 2011, Scotsman <a href="Derek%20McInnes">Derek McInnes</a> was appointed Bristol City manager after Keith Millen's departure. The 40-year-old joined from Scottish Premier League side <a href="St%20Johnstone%20F.C.">St Johnstone</a> on a contract until the summer of 2014. McInnes was highly respected at St Johnstone after his 2008/09 season triumph when St Johnstone finished at the top of the First Division taking them up into the SPL; McInnes arrived at Ashton Gate with a 40 per cent win percentage, with 53 victories, 41 draws and 38 defeats in his 130 games in charge at McDiarmid Park.

On 29 November 2011, the club announced a loss of £11.45 million.

After a promising start with only a single loss in seven games and a goalless draw at West Ham, City, between 3 December 2011 and 3 March 2012, managed only three wins, scored nine goals in total and lost eleven games including an FA Cup tie with then-League Two club Crawley Town; a 3–2 home win against Leicester City served only as a break in City's fall into the relegation zone. Punctuating the period was a David James own-goal from a botched punch during a home loss to Watford, an action that served to be the final straw as he did not feature until City's last game of 2011–12 away at Burnley – a game he only played one quarter of due to injury.

The Watford loss, however, was the final one of the season as – partly due to Dean Gerken's return and the loan signings of Andre Amougou (Burnley) and Hogan Ephraim (QPR) – City resurged and came out of the Easter weekend with two victories over Nottingham Forest – City's first win at Forest's City Ground since 1956 – and Coventry City, putting themselves four points distant of the relegation zone. The second draw against West Ham of the season effectively ended the latter club's automatic promotion hopes, and losses by Coventry and Portsmouth put Bristol City further out of reach before a 2–0 home win against Barnsley on 21 April 2012 secured safety for City and relegation for their rivals.

After a poor start to the 2012/13 campaign, which included only three home wins, McInnes was sacked on 12 January 2013 after a 4–0 home defeat by Leicester City, which left them in bottom place in the Championship.

After the sacking of <a href="Derek%20McInnes">Derek McInnes</a> on 12 January 2013, former <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> manager <a href="Sean%20O%27Driscoll">Sean O'Driscoll</a> was appointed head coach on a 12-month rolling contract. On 16 April 2013, City were relegated to League One after suffering a 1–0 defeat to Ex-Premier League club <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> who sealed the Robins' fate. For City it ended a six-year stay in the Championship, the second longest behind fellow relegation contenders <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a>. <a href="Sean%20O%27Driscoll">Sean O'Driscoll</a> left Ashton Gate with the team 22nd in the League One table, having managed only two wins in 18 matches this season – although he did oversee a Johnstone's Paint Trophy win over arch-local rivals Bristol Rovers.

After the sacking of <a href="Sean%20O%27Driscoll">Sean O'Driscoll</a> on 28 November 2013, former <a href="Nottingham%20Forest">Nottingham Forest</a> and <a href="Cheltenham%20Town">Cheltenham Town</a> manager <a href="Steve%20Cotterill">Steve Cotterill</a> was appointed on a three and a half year contract. When he joined the club were bottom of the table and 5 points away from safety with a −7 goal difference. Cotterill made a huge impact and guided the club to safety and finished the season 12th, 11 points from the relegation zone with a goal difference of +3. This was the first time the club managed a positive goal difference since the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Football%20League%20Championship">2007–08 Football League Championship</a>. Had the season started when Steve Cotterill joined the club, Bristol City would have finished 5th.

Bristol City were promoted back to Championship for <a href="2015%E2%80%9316%20Football%20League%20Championship">2015–16 season</a> after securing a top spot in <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Football%20League%20One">2014–15 Football League One</a> on 14 April 2015. They were crowned League One champions at home to Coventry City on Saturday 18 April, the club's first league title since 1955. In their last home game, against Walsall, they finished the season in style, winning 8–2 including a hat-trick by centre back Aden Flint. In the same season, they also won the 2015 Johnstone's Paint Trophy after a win over Walsall, which finished 2–0 and their third league trophy, a record held by the club for having the most wins in that competition.

Steve Cotterill was relieved of his duties on 14 January 2016 after a poor run of form which had seen Bristol City slip to 22nd in the Championship table with just 4 wins in 28 games.

<a href="Lee%20Johnson%20%28footballer%29">Lee Johnson</a> was appointed as Bristol City's new head coach on 6 February 2016. Johnson's club at the time, <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a>, released a statement via their website & social media accounts that they had given permission for Bristol City to make contact with him over their vacancy. Later that day, <a href="Lee%20Johnson%20%28footballer%29">Johnson's</a> appointment was formally announced just before Bristol City's away match against <a href="Charlton%20Athletic">Charlton Athletic</a>. He had been the bookies' favourite for a number of days leading up to his appointment. Prior to joining the club as head coach, Johnson played 199 games for Bristol City as a midfielder between 2006 and 2012, scoring 11 goals. He is also the son of former Bristol City manager, <a href="Gary%20Johnson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201955%29">Gary Johnson</a>, whom he played under for 4 years at City and who took City to the Championship play-off final in 2008, where they eventually lost to <a href="Hull%20City%20F.C.">Hull City</a>. Johnson successfully guided Bristol City to an 18th-place finish at the end of the 2015–16 season, meaning that City avoided relegation back to League One.

Despite star striker <a href="Jonathan%20Kodjia">Jonathan Kodjia</a> leaving to <a href="Aston%20Villa">Aston Villa</a>, Bristol City started the 2016–17 season well, and after 11 games they were 5th in the league table. This was in part due to loan star <a href="Tammy%20Abraham">Tammy Abraham</a> scoring 8 goals in 8 games. City also appeared in the Last 16 of the <a href="League%20Cup">League Cup</a> for the first time since the 1988–89 season, however they were beaten 1–2 by <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> side Hull City. However, a sharp downturn in fortunes followed, and going into January they were 18th with 27 points, only 3 points clear of the relegation zone. The signings of <a href="Jens%20Hegeler">Jens Hegeler</a>, <a href="Bailey%20Wright">Bailey Wright</a>, <a href="Fabian%20Giefer">Fabian Giefer</a>, <a href="Matty%20Taylor%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201990%29">Matty Taylor</a> (signed from local rivals Bristol Rovers) and <a href="David%20Cotterill">David Cotterill</a> did not inspire an upturn in form, and, despite beating relegation rivals <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a> 1–0 and promotion hopefuls <a href="Huddersfield%20Town%20A.F.C.">Huddersfield Town</a> 4–0, they lost 2–0 to <a href="Brentford%20F.C.">Brentford</a> and 5–0 to <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a>, putting them only one point above the relegation zone with 6 games to go. However, an upturn in form followed, as they then beat <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolves</a>, <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">QPR</a>, drew against <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> before finally beating <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley F.C.</a> and already promoted <a href="Brighton%20%26amp%3B%20Hove%20Albion%20F.C.">Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.</a> to secure another season in the Championship.

Bristol City have played in red and white since the 1890s, occasionally also including black.

About halfway through the 2007–08 season Bristol City manager <a href="Gary%20Johnson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201955%29">Gary Johnson</a> said in an interview that he hoped the team could get the whole ground bouncing. City supporters took this rallying cry on board and began to sing "Johnson says bounce around the ground" to the tune of <a href="Yellow%20Submarine%20%28song%29">Yellow Submarine</a>, while continually bouncing up and down. The first game at which it was sung was in an away match against <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a> at <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Stadium">St Mary's Stadium</a>, and it was also sung at away at <a href="Queen%27s%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queen's Park Rangers</a> in February. When Bristol City fans travelled to London to play <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a> on 4 March 2008, the visiting fans, using the rail network to return home, adapted the song to "Bounce Around the Train". Since then, it has become an often used chant at <a href="Ashton%20Gate%20stadium">Ashton Gate stadium</a> by the fans, and City manager Gary Johnson has even joined in with the bouncing himself.
It was also sometimes used by supporters of Gary Johnson's former side <a href="Northampton%20Town%20F.C.">Northampton Town</a>, primarily at away matches.
When Gary Johnson's son, <a href="Lee%20Johnson%20%28footballer%29">Lee Johnson</a> returned to his former club in 2016 as their new manager, he stated that he wished to inherit the chant and keep the fans singing it.

Bristol City's traditional rivals are <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Bristol Rovers</a>. The clubs have met 105 times, with the first meeting in 1897. Bristol City have the most wins on 43. However, the clubs have not been in the same league for a number of years; they were last in the same division in the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20Football%20League">2000–01 Season</a>. Since then, they have only met three times; in the two-legged southern final of the 2006–07 <a href="Football%20League%20Trophy">Football League Trophy</a>, which Rovers won 1–0 on aggregate, and in the first round of the 2013–14 Johnstone's Paint Trophy, which City won 2–1 at Ashton Gate.

City's other main rivals are <a href="Cardiff%20City%20F.C.">Cardiff City</a>, who play in nearby <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a>. Despite being a local derby, it crosses the <a href="Wales-England%20border">Wales-England border</a>, making it one of the few international derbies in the United Kingdom. Both clubs have been at similar levels over the past 10 years, except between 2003 and 2007 when Cardiff were a division above, in the 2013/14 season the clubs were two divisions apart however, following Cardiff's promotion to the Premiership and subsequent relegation in the same season to the Championship they are just one division apart. This has meant frequent meetings in the league including in the semi-finals of the <a href="Football%20League%20One%20play-offs%232003">2003 Second Division play-offs</a>. Cardiff City 'did the double' over Bristol City during the 2016/17 season, beating them 2–1 at <a href="Cardiff%20City%20Stadium">The Cardiff City Stadium</a> and 3–2 at Ashton Gate.

Other clubs have been seen as 'third rivals' by the fans and media. <a href="Swindon%20Town%20F.C.">Swindon Town</a> are seen by many as rivals, being nicknamed 'Swindle' by City fans. <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth Argyle</a> have also been considered rivals despite a distance of over 100 miles. The rivalry has developed in recent years as the two clubs were the highest ranking <a href="West%20Country">West Country</a> clubs for a number of years, and meetings were seen as a decider of the 'Best in the west'. <a href="Swansea%20City%20A.F.C.">Swansea City</a> and even <a href="Yeovil%20Town%20F.C.">Yeovil Town</a> have previously been mentioned as rivals, but very rarely.

Bristol City have played at <a href="Ashton%20Gate%20stadium">Ashton Gate</a> in the south-west of Bristol, just south of the <a href="River%20Avon%2C%20Bristol">River Avon</a>, since moving from <a href="St%20John%27s%20Lane">St John's Lane</a> in 1904. The ground currently has an all-seated capacity of 27,000. It was the home of <a href="Bedminster%20F.C.">Bedminster</a> until the 1900 merger, and the merged team played some games there the following season, but it did not become the permanent home of Bristol City until 1904.

In the past plans were considered for expansion work to be carried out at Ashton Gate. There were also proposals to build a new 36,000-seat stadium at <a href="Hengrove">Hengrove Park</a>. This was turned down in a local referendum in December 2000. In 2002, the local council was looking at possible sites for a new 40,000-seat stadium which would house both City, <a href="Bristol%20Rovers%20F.C.">Rovers</a> and <a href="Bristol%20Rugby">Bristol Rugby</a>, but these plans were scrapped and it is widely accepted that this would not have been welcomed by the majority of supporters from all clubs. Ashton Gate's current capacity is an average size for <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Championship</a> grounds, however in November 2007 the club announced plans to relocate to a new 30,000 capacity <a href="Bristol%20City%20Stadium">stadium</a> in <a href="Ashton%20Vale">Ashton Vale</a> plans were also in place to increase capacity to 42,000 had the England 2018 World Cup bid been successful.

The South stand opened for the 2015/16 season, with the existing Williams stand being demolished and replaced by the Lansdown stand in 2016. A new partly-artificial Desso pitch was laid and the current Dolman stand refurbished. There is still no decision on the club's request to provide a "safe standing" area, similar to those used in Germany.

The women's team was formed in 1990 supported by the club's community officer, Shaun Parker. Their greatest achievement was reaching the semi-finals of the <a href="FA%20Women%27s%20Cup">FA Women's Cup</a> in 1994 and winning promotion to the <a href="FA%20Women%27s%20Premier%20League%20National%20Division">Premier League</a> under Manager Jack Edgar in 2004. Following the decision by the FA to fund only one centre of excellence in Bristol, the two senior teams were disbanded in June 2008 and the girls' youth side merged with the <a href="South%20Gloucestershire%20and%20Stroud%20College">Bristol Academy W.F.C.</a>. The majority of the senior players, with coach Will Roberts, moved to the <a href="University%20of%20Bath">University of Bath</a> in summer 2008 and now play as AFC TeamBath Ladies in the <a href="South%20West%20Combination%20Women%27s%20Football%20League">South West Combination Women's Football League</a>.

Bioterrorism

Bioterrorism is <a href="terrorism">terrorism</a> involving the intentional release or dissemination of <a href="biological%20agent">biological agent</a>s. These agents are <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, <a href="virus">virus</a>es, fungi, or <a href="toxin">toxin</a>s, and may be in a naturally occurring or a human-modified form, in much the same way in <a href="biological%20warfare">biological warfare</a>.

According to the U.S. <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> "bioterrorism" is the deliberate release of viruses, bacteria, toxins or other harmful agents to cause illness or death in people, animals, or plants. These agents are typically found in nature, but could be mutated or altered to increase their ability to cause disease, make them resistant to current medicines, or to increase their ability to be spread into the environment. Biological agents can be spread through the air, water, or in food. Terrorists tend to use biological agents because they are extremely difficult to detect and do not cause illness for several hours to several days. Some bioterrorism agents, like the <a href="smallpox%20virus">smallpox virus</a>, can be spread from person to person and some, like <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a>, cannot.

Bioterrorism is an attractive weapon because biological agents are relatively easy and inexpensive to obtain, can be easily disseminated, and can cause widespread fear and panic beyond the actual physical damage. Military leaders, however, have learned that, as a military asset, bioterrorism has some important limitations; it is difficult to employ a bioweapon in a way that only affects the enemy and not friendly forces. A biological weapon is useful to <a href="terrorists">terrorists</a> mainly as a method of creating mass panic and disruption to a state or a country. However, technologists such as <a href="Bill%20Joy">Bill Joy</a> have warned of the potential power which genetic engineering might place in the hands of future bio-terrorists.

The use of agents that do not cause harm to humans but disrupt the economy have been discussed. A highly relevant pathogen in this context is the <a href="foot-and-mouth%20disease">foot-and-mouth disease</a> (FMD) virus, which is capable of causing widespread economic damage and public concern (as witnessed in the <a href="2001%20United%20Kingdom%20foot-and-mouth%20outbreak">2001</a> and <a href="2007%20United%20Kingdom%20foot-and-mouth%20outbreak">2007</a> FMD outbreaks in the UK), whilst having almost no capacity to infect humans.

By the time <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> began, attempts to use <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a> were directed at animal populations. This generally proved to be ineffective. 

Shortly after the start of World War I, Germany launched a biological sabotage campaign in the United States, Russia, Romania, and France. At that time, <a href="Anton%20Dilger">Anton Dilger</a> lived in Germany, but in 1915 he was sent to the United States carrying cultures of <a href="glanders">glanders</a>, a virulent disease of horses and mules. Dilger set up a laboratory in his home in <a href="Chevy%20Chase%2C%20Maryland">Chevy Chase</a>, Maryland. He used <a href="stevedore">stevedore</a>s working the docks in Baltimore to infect horses with <a href="glanders">glanders</a> while they were waiting to be shipped to Britain. Dilger was under suspicion as being a German agent, but was never arrested. Dilger eventually fled to Madrid, Spain, where he died during the <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">Influenza Pandemic of 1918</a>. In 1916, the Russians arrested a German agent with similar intentions. Germany and its allies infected French cavalry horses and many of Russia’s mules and horses on the Eastern Front. These actions hindered artillery and troop movements, as well as supply convoys.
In 1972 police in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> arrested two college students, Allen Schwander and Stephen Pera, who had planned to poison the city's water supply with <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a> and other bacteria. Schwander had founded a terrorist group, "R.I.S.E.", while Pera collected and grew cultures from the hospital where he worked. The two men fled to <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> after being released on bail. Schwander died of natural causes in 1974, while Pera returned to the U.S. in 1975 and was put on probation.

In 1980 the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the eradication of <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, a highly contagious and incurable disease. Although the disease has been eliminated in the wild, frozen stocks of smallpox virus are still maintained by the governments of the United States and Russia. Disastrous consequences are feared if rogue politicians or terrorists were to get hold of the smallpox strains. Since vaccination programs are now terminated, the world population is more susceptible to smallpox than ever before.

In <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> in 1984, followers of the <a href="Rajneesh">Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh</a> attempted to control a local <a href="election">election</a> by <a href="1984%20Rajneeshee%20bioterror%20attack">incapacitating the local population</a>. This was done by infecting <a href="salad">salad</a> bars in 11 restaurants, produce in grocery stores, doorknobs, and other public domains with "<a href="Salmonella%20typhimurium">Salmonella typhimurium</a>" bacteria in the city of <a href="The%20Dalles">The Dalles</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>. The attack infected 751 people with severe <a href="food%20poisoning">food poisoning</a>. There were no fatalities. This incident was the first known bioterrorist attack in the United States in the 20th century. It was also the single largest bioterrorism attack on U.S. soil.
In June 1993, the religious group <a href="Aum%20Shinrikyo">Aum Shinrikyo</a> released <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a> in Tokyo. Eyewitnesses reported a foul odor. The attack was a total failure, infecting not a single person. The reason for this is that the group used the vaccine strain of the bacterium. The spores recovered from the attack showed that they were identical to an anthrax vaccine strain given to animals at the time. These vaccine strains are missing the genes that cause a symptomatic response.

In September and October 2001, several cases of <a href="2001%20anthrax%20attacks">anthrax broke out</a> in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, apparently caused deliberately. Letters laced with infectious anthrax were concurrently delivered to news media offices and the U.S Congress, alongside an <a href="2001%20anthrax%20attacks%23Anthrax%20letter%20to%20Chile">ambiguously related case</a> in <a href="Chile">Chile</a>. The letters killed 5.

Under current <a href="United%20States%20law">United States law</a>, <a href="bio-agents">bio-agents</a> which have been declared by the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Human%20Services">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a> or the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">U.S. Department of Agriculture</a> to have the "potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety" are officially defined as "<a href="select%20agents">select agents</a>". The CDC categorizes these agents (A, B or C) and administers the <a href="Select%20Agent%20Program">Select Agent Program</a>, which regulates the laboratories which may possess, use, or transfer select agents within the United States. As with US attempts to categorize harmful recreational drugs, designer viruses are not yet categorized and avian H5N1 has been shown to achieve high mortality and human-communication in a laboratory setting.

These high-priority agents pose a risk to national security, can be easily transmitted and disseminated, result in high mortality, have potential major public health impact, may cause public panic, or require special action for public health preparedness.


Category B agents are moderately easy to disseminate and have low mortality rates.


Category C agents are emerging <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s that might be <a href="genetic%20engineering">engineered</a> for mass dissemination because of their availability, ease of production and dissemination, high mortality rate, or ability to cause a major health impact.


Planning may involve the development of biological identification systems. Until recently in the United States, most biological defense strategies have been geared to protecting soldiers on the battlefield rather than ordinary people in cities. Financial cutbacks have limited the tracking of disease outbreaks. Some outbreaks, such as food poisoning due to "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a>" or "<a href="Salmonella">Salmonella</a>", could be of either natural or deliberate origin.

Biological agents are relatively easy to obtain by terrorists and are becoming more threatening in the U.S., and laboratories are working on advanced detection systems to provide early warning, identify <a href="contamination">contaminated areas</a> and populations at risk, and to facilitate prompt treatment. Methods for predicting the use of biological agents in urban areas as well as assessing the area for the hazards associated with a biological attack are being established in major cities. In addition, <a href="forensic">forensic</a> technologies are working on identifying biological agents, their geographical origins and/or their initial source. Efforts include decontamination technologies to restore facilities without causing additional environmental concerns.

Early detection and rapid response to bioterrorism depend on close cooperation between <a href="public%20health">public health</a> authorities and law enforcement; however, such cooperation is currently lacking. National detection assets and vaccine stockpiles are not useful if local and state officials do not have access to them.

Aspects of protection against bioterrorism in the United States include,

On a CNN news broadcast in 2011, the CNN chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, weighed in on the American government’s recent approach to bioterrorist threats. He explains how, even though the United States would be better fending off bioterrorist attacks now than they would be a decade ago, the amount of money available to fight bioterrorism over the last three years has begun to decrease. Looking at a detailed report that examined the funding decrease for bioterrorism in fifty-one American cities, Dr. Gupta stated that the cities “wouldn’t be able to distribute vaccines as well” and “wouldn’t be able to track viruses”. He went on to say that movie portrayals of global pandemics, such as Contagion, were actually quite possible and may occur in the United States under the right conditions.

A news broadcast by MSNBC in 2010 also stressed the low levels of bioterrorism preparedness in the United States. The broadcast stated that a bipartisan report gave the Obama administration a failing grade for its efforts to respond to a bioterrorist attack. The news broadcast invited the former New York City police commissioner, Howard Safir, to explain how the government would fare in combating such an attack. He said how “biological and chemical weapons are probable and relatively easy to disperse”. Furthermore, Safir thought that efficiency in bioterrorism preparedness is not necessarily a question of money, but is instead dependent on putting resources in the right places. The broadcast suggested that the nation was not ready for something more serious.

In a September 2016 interview conducted by Homeland Preparedness News, Daniel Gerstein, a senior policy researcher for the RAND Corporation, stresses the importance in preparing for potential bioterrorist attacks on the nation. He implored the U.S. government to take the proper and necessary actions to implement a strategic plan of action to save as many lives as possible and to safeguard against potential chaos and confusion. He believes that because there have been no significant instances of bioterrorism since the anthrax attacks in 2001, the government has allowed itself to become complacent making the country that much more vulnerable to unsuspecting attacks, thereby further endangering the lives of U.S. citizens.

Gerstein formerly served in the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security from 2011 to 2014. He claims there has not been a serious plan of action since 2004 during George W. Bush's presidency, in which he issued a Homeland Security directive delegating responsibilities among various federal agencies. He also stated that the blatant mishandling of the Ebola virus outbreak in 2014 attested to the government's lack of preparation. This past May, legislation that would create a national defense strategy was introduced in the Senate, coinciding with the timing of ISIS-affiliated terrorist groups get closer to weaponizing biological agents. Last August, Kenyan officials apprehended two members of an Islamic extremist group in motion to set off a biological bomb containing anthrax. Mohammed Abdi Ali, the believed leader of the group, who was a medical intern, was arrested along with his wife, a medical student. The two were caught just before carrying out their plan. The Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, which comprises a group of experts on national security and government officials, in which Gerstein had previously testified to, submitted its National Blueprint for Biodefense to Congress in October 2015 listing their recommendations for devising an effective plan.

Bill Gates said in a February 18 "Business Insider" op-ed (published near the time of his Munich Security Conference speech) that it is possible for an airborne pathogen to kill at least 30 million people over the course of a year. In a "New York Times" report, the <a href="Bill%20%26amp%3B%20Melinda%20Gates%20Foundation">Gates Foundation</a> predicted that a modern outbreak similar to the <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">Spanish Influenza pandemic</a> (which killed between 50 million and 100 million people) could end up killing more than 360 million people worldwide, even considering widespread availability of vaccines and other healthcare tools. The report cited increased <a href="globalization">globalization</a>, rapid international air travel, and <a href="urbanization">urbanization</a> as increased reasons for concern. In a March 9, 2017 interview with CNBC, former U.S. Senator <a href="Joe%20Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a>, who was co-chair of the bipartisan <a href="Blue%20Ribbon%20Study%20Panel%20on%20Biodefense">Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense</a>, said a worldwide pandemic could end the lives of more people than a nuclear war. Lieberman also expressed worry that a terrorist group like ISIS could develop a synthetic influenza strain and introduce it to the world to kill civilians. In July 2017, Robert C. Hutchinson, former agent at the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Homeland%20Security">Department of Homeland Security</a>, called for a "whole-of-government" response to the next global health threat, which he described as including strict security procedures at our borders and proper execution of government preparedness plans.

Also, novel approaches in biotechnology, such as synthetic biology, could be used in the future to design new types of biological warfare agents. Special attention has to be laid on future experiments (of concern) that:
Most of the biosecurity concerns in synthetic biology, however, are focused on the role of DNA synthesis and the risk of producing genetic material of lethal viruses (e.g. 1918 Spanish flu, polio) in the lab. Recently, the CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as a promising technique for gene editing. It was hailed by The Washington Post as "the most important innovation in the synthetic biology space in nearly 30 years." While other methods take months or years to edit gene sequences, CRISPR speeds that time up to weeks. However, due to its ease of use and accessibility, it has raised a number of ethical concerns, especially surrounding its use in the biohacking space.

In 1999, the <a href="University%20of%20Pittsburgh">University of Pittsburgh</a>'s Center for <a href="Biomedical">Biomedical</a> Informatics deployed the first automated bioterrorism detection system, called <a href="Real-Time%20Outbreak%20Disease%20Surveillance">RODS (Real-Time Outbreak Disease Surveillance)</a>. RODS is designed to draw collect data from many data sources and use them to perform signal detection, that is, to detect a possible bioterrorism event at the earliest possible moment. RODS, and other systems like it, collect data from sources including clinic data, laboratory data, and data from over-the-counter drug sales. In 2000, Michael Wagner, the codirector of the RODS laboratory, and <a href="Ron%20Aryel">Ron Aryel</a>, a subcontractor, conceived the idea of obtaining live data feeds from "non-traditional" (non-health-care) data sources. The RODS laboratory's first efforts eventually led to the establishment of the National Retail Data Monitor, a system which collects data from 20,000 retail locations nationwide.

On February 5, 2002, <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> visited the RODS laboratory and used it as a model for a <a href="USD">$</a>300 million spending proposal to equip all 50 states with biosurveillance systems. In a speech delivered at the nearby <a href="Masonic%20temple">Masonic temple</a>, Bush compared the RODS system to a modern "<a href="DEW">DEW</a>" line (referring to the Cold War ballistic missile early warning system).

The principles and practices of biosurveillance, a new interdisciplinary science, were defined and described in the "Handbook of Biosurveillance", edited by Michael Wagner, Andrew Moore and Ron Aryel, and published in 2006. Biosurveillance is the science of real-time disease outbreak detection. Its principles apply to both natural and man-made epidemics (bioterrorism).

Data which potentially could assist in early detection of a bioterrorism event include many categories of information. Health-related data such as that from hospital computer systems, clinical laboratories, electronic <a href="health%20record%20systems">health record systems</a>, medical examiner record-keeping systems, 911 call center computers, and veterinary medical record systems could be of help; researchers are also considering the utility of data generated by <a href="ranching">ranching</a> and <a href="feedlot">feedlot</a> operations, food processors, <a href="drinking%20water">drinking water</a> systems, school attendance recording, and physiologic monitors, among others. Intuitively, one would expect systems which collect more than one type of data to be more useful than systems which collect only one type of information (such as single-purpose laboratory or 911 call-center based systems), and be less prone to <a href="false%20alarms">false alarms</a>, and this appears to be the case.

In <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, disease surveillance is beginning to be organized on the continent-wide scale needed to track a biological emergency. The system not only monitors infected persons, but attempts to discern the origin of the outbreak.

Researchers are experimenting with devices to detect the existence of a threat:


New research shows that ultraviolet <a href="avalanche%20photodiodes">avalanche photodiodes</a> offer the high gain, reliability and robustness needed to detect anthrax and other bioterrorism agents in the air. The fabrication methods and device characteristics were described at the 50th Electronic Materials Conference in Santa Barbara on June 25, 2008. Details of the photodiodes were also published in the February 14, 2008 issue of the journal Electronics Letters and the November 2007 issue of the journal IEEE Photonics Technology Letters.

The United States Department of Defense conducts global biosurveillance through several programs, including the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System.

Another powerful tool developed within New York City for use in countering bioterrorism is the development of the New York City <a href="Syndromic%20Surveillance">Syndromic Surveillance</a> System. This system is essentially a way of tracking disease progression throughout New York City, and was developed by the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Department%20of%20Health%20and%20Mental%20Hygiene">New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene</a> (NYC DOHMH) in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The system works by tracking the symptoms of those taken into the emergency department—based on the location of the hospital to which they are taken and their home address—and assessing any patterns in symptoms. These established trends can then be observed by medical epidemiologists to determine if there are any disease outbreaks in any particular locales; maps of disease prevalence can then be created rather easily. This is an obviously beneficial tool in fighting bioterrorism as it provides a means through which such attacks could be discovered in their nascence; assuming bioterrorist attacks result in similar symptoms across the board, this strategy allows New York City to respond immediately to any bioterrorist threats that they may face with some level of alacrity.

Government agencies which would be called on to respond to a bioterrorism incident would include law enforcement, hazardous materials/decontamination units and emergency medical units, if they exist.

The US military has specialized units, which can respond to a bioterrorism event; among them are the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a>' <a href="Chemical%20Biological%20Incident%20Response%20Force">Chemical Biological Incident Response Force</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a>'s <a href="20th%20Support%20Command%20%28CBRNE%29">20th Support Command (CBRNE)</a>, which can detect, identify, and neutralize threats, and <a href="decontamination">decontaminate</a> victims exposed to bioterror agents. US response would include the <a href="Center%20for%20Disease%20Control">Center for Disease Control</a>.

Historically, governments and authorities have relied on quarantines to protect their populations. International bodies such as the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a> already devote some of their resources to monitoring epidemics and have served clearing-house roles in historical epidemics.

Media attention toward the seriousness of biological attacks increased in 2013-2014. In July 2013, "Forbes" published an article with the title "Bioterrorism: A Dirty Little Threat With Huge Potential Consequences." In November 2013, Fox News reported on a new strain of botulism, saying that the Centers for Disease and Control lists botulism as one of two agents that have “the highest risks of mortality and morbidity”, noting that there is no antidote for botulism. USA Today reported that the U.S. military in November was trying to develop a vaccine for troops from the bacteria that cause the disease Q fever, an agent the military once used as a biological weapon. In February 2014, the former special assistant and senior director for biodefense policy to President George W. Bush called the bioterrorism risk imminent and uncertain and Congressman <a href="Bill%20Pascrell">Bill Pascrell</a> called for increasing federal measures against bioterrorism as a “matter of life or death.” The "New York Times" wrote a story saying the United States would spend $40 million to help certain low and middle-income countries deal with the threats of bioterrorism and infectious diseases.

<a href="Bill%20Gates">Bill Gates</a> has warned that bioterrorism could kill more people than nuclear war.

President Donald Trump promoted his first budget around keeping America safe. However, one aspect of defense would receive less money: "protecting the nation from deadly pathogens, man-made or natural," according to the "New York Times". Agencies tasked with <a href="biosecurity">biosecurity</a> get a decrease in funding under the Administration's budget proposal.

For example:
“The next <a href="weapon%20of%20mass%20destruction">weapon of mass destruction</a> may not be a bomb," Lawrence O. Gostin, the director of the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center on Public Health Law and Human Rights, told the "New York Times". “It may be a tiny pathogen that you can’t see, smell or taste, and by the time we discover it, it’ll be too late."

Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit

The Northrop (later Northrop Grumman) B-2 Spirit, also known as the Stealth Bomber, is an American <a href="Heavy%20bomber">heavy</a> <a href="Penetrator%20%28aircraft%29">penetration</a> <a href="strategic%20bomber">strategic bomber</a>, featuring low observable <a href="stealth%20aircraft">stealth</a> technology designed for penetrating dense <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft defenses</a>; it is a <a href="flying%20wing">flying wing</a> design with a crew of two. The bomber can deploy both <a href="conventional%20weapon">conventional</a> and <a href="thermonuclear%20weapon">thermonuclear weapon</a>s, such as eighty -class (<a href="Mark%2082%20bomb">Mk 82</a>) <a href="Joint%20Direct%20Attack%20Munition">JDAM</a> <a href="Global%20Positioning%20System">Global Positioning System</a>-guided bombs, or sixteen <a href="B83%20nuclear%20bomb">B83 nuclear bomb</a>s. The B-2 is the only acknowledged aircraft that can carry large <a href="air-to-surface%20missile">air-to-surface</a> <a href="Standoff%20missile">standoff weapon</a>s in a stealth configuration.

Development originally started under the "Advanced Technology Bomber" (ATB) project during the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Jimmy%20Carter">Carter administration</a>; its expected performance was one of his reasons for the cancellation of the supersonic <a href="Rockwell%20B-1%20Lancer%23B-1A%20program">B-1A bomber</a>. The ATB project continued during the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Ronald%20Reagan">Reagan administration</a>, but worries about delays in its introduction led to the reinstatement of the B-1 program, as well. Program costs rose throughout development. Designed and manufactured by <a href="Northrop%20Corporation">Northrop</a>, later <a href="Northrop%20Grumman">Northrop Grumman</a>, the cost of each aircraft averaged US$737 million (in 1997 dollars). Total <a href="procurement">procurement</a> costs averaged $929 million per aircraft, which includes spare parts, equipment, retrofitting, and software support. The total program cost including development, engineering and testing, averaged $2.1 billion per aircraft in 1997.

Because of its considerable <a href="Capital%20cost">capital</a> and <a href="Operating%20cost">operating</a> costs, the <a href="megaproject">project</a> was controversial in the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> and among the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>. The winding-down of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> in the latter portion of the 1980s dramatically reduced the need for the aircraft, which was designed with the intention of penetrating Soviet airspace and attacking high-value targets. During the late 1980s and 1990s, Congress slashed plans to purchase 132 bombers to 21. In 2008, a B-2 was destroyed in <a href="2008%20Andersen%20Air%20Force%20Base%20B-2%20accident">a crash shortly after takeoff</a>, though the crew ejected safely. There are 20 B-2s in service with the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a>, which plans to operate the B-2 until 2058.
The B-2 is capable of all-altitude attack missions up to , with a range of more than on internal fuel and over with one <a href="aerial%20refueling">midair refueling</a>. It entered service in 1997 as the second aircraft designed to have advanced stealth technology after the <a href="Lockheed%20F-117%20Nighthawk">Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk</a> attack aircraft. Though designed originally as primarily a nuclear bomber, the B-2 was first used in combat, dropping conventional, non-nuclear <a href="aircraft%20ordnance">ordnance</a> in the <a href="Kosovo%20War">Kosovo War</a> in 1999. It later served in <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq</a>, <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">Afghanistan</a>, and <a href="Libyan%20Civil%20War%20%282011%29">Libya</a>.

By the mid-1970s, military aircraft designers had learned of a new method to avoid missiles and interceptors, known today as "<a href="Stealth%20aircraft">stealth</a>". The concept was to build an aircraft with an airframe that deflected or absorbed radar signals so that little was reflected back to the radar unit. An aircraft having stealth characteristics would be able to fly nearly undetected and could be attacked only by weapons and systems not relying on radar. Although other detection measures existed, such as human observation, their relatively short detection range allowed most aircraft to fly undetected by defenses, especially at night.

In 1974, <a href="DARPA">DARPA</a> requested information from U.S. aviation firms about the largest <a href="radar%20cross-section">radar cross-section</a> of an aircraft that would remain effectively invisible to radars. Initially, <a href="Northrop%20Corporation">Northrop</a> and <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas">McDonnell Douglas</a> were selected for further development. <a href="Lockheed%20Corporation">Lockheed</a> had experience in this field due to developing the <a href="Lockheed%20A-12">Lockheed A-12</a> and <a href="Lockheed%20SR-71%20Blackbird">SR-71</a>, which included a number of stealthy features, notably its canted vertical stabilizers, the use of composite materials in key locations, and the overall surface finish in <a href="Radar-absorbent%20material">radar-absorbing paint</a>. A key improvement was the introduction of computer models used to predict the radar reflections from flat surfaces where collected data drove the design of a "faceted" aircraft. Development of the first such designs started in 1975 with "the hopeless diamond", a model Lockheed built to test the concept.

Plans were well advanced by the summer of 1975, when DARPA started the Experimental Survivability Testbed (XST) project. Northrop and Lockheed were awarded contracts in the first round of testing. Lockheed received the sole award for the second test round in April 1976 leading to the <a href="Have%20Blue">Have Blue</a> program and eventually the <a href="F-117">F-117</a> stealth attack aircraft. Northrop also had a classified technology demonstration aircraft, the <a href="Tacit%20Blue">Tacit Blue</a> in development in 1979 at <a href="Area%2051">Area 51</a>. It developed stealth technology, LO (low observables), <a href="fly-by-wire">fly-by-wire</a>, curved surfaces, composite materials, electronic intelligence (ELINT), and Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft Experimental (BSAX). "The stealth technology developed from the program was later incorporated into other operational aircraft designs, including the B-2 stealth bomber".

By 1976, these programs progressed to where a long-range strategic stealth bomber appeared viable. President Carter was aware of these developments during 1977, and it appears to have been one of the major reasons the B-1 was canceled. Further studies were ordered in early 1978, by which point the Have Blue platform had flown and proven the concepts. During the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201980">1980 presidential election</a> campaign in 1979, <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> repeatedly stated that Carter was weak on defense, and used the B-1 as a prime example. In return, on 22 August 1980, the <a href="Carter%20administration">Carter administration</a> publicly disclosed that the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">United States Department of Defense</a> was working to develop stealth aircraft, including a bomber.

The Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB) program began in 1979. Full development of the <a href="black%20project">black project</a> followed, and was funded under the code name "<a href="Aurora%20%28aircraft%29">Aurora</a>". After the evaluations of the companies' proposals, the ATB competition was narrowed to the <a href="Northrop%20Corporation">Northrop</a>/<a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> and <a href="Lockheed%20Corporation">Lockheed</a>/<a href="Rockwell%20International">Rockwell</a> teams with each receiving a study contract for further work. Both teams used flying wing designs. The Northrop proposal was code named "Senior Ice" and the Lockheed proposal code named "<a href="Lockheed%20Senior%20Peg">Senior Peg</a>". Northrop had prior experience developing the <a href="Northrop%20YB-35">YB-35</a> and <a href="Northrop%20YB-49">YB-49</a> flying wing aircraft. The Northrop design was larger while the Lockheed design included a small tail. In 1979, designer <a href="Hal%20Markarian">Hal Markarian</a> produced a sketch of the aircraft, that bore considerable similarities to the final design. The Air Force originally planned to procure 165 of the ATB bomber.

The Northrop team's ATB design was selected over the Lockheed/Rockwell design on 20 October 1981. The Northrop design received the designation B-2 and the name "Spirit". The bomber's design was changed in the mid-1980s when the mission profile was changed from high-altitude to low-altitude, terrain-following. The redesign delayed the B-2's first flight by two years and added about US$1 billion to the program's cost. An estimated US$23 billion was secretly spent for <a href="research%20and%20development">research and development</a> on the B-2 by 1989. <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">MIT</a> engineers and scientists helped assess the mission effectiveness of the aircraft under a five-year <a href="Classified%20information">classified</a> contract during the 1980s.

During its design and development, the Northrop B-2 program was a gray project before its revelation to the public. Unlike the <a href="Lockheed%20F-117">Lockheed F-117</a> program, which was a <a href="black%20project">black project</a>, the type of military project of which very few people knew even existed while it was being designed and developed, more people within the United States federal government knew about the B-2 and more information about the project was available. Both during development and in service, there has been considerable importance placed to the security of the B-2 and its technologies. Staff working on the B-2 in most, if not all, capacities have to achieve a level of special-access clearance, and undergo extensive background checks carried out by a special branch of the Air Force.

For the manufacturing, a former Ford automobile assembly plant in <a href="Pico%20Rivera%2C%20California">Pico Rivera, California</a>, was acquired and heavily rebuilt; the plant's employees were sworn to complete secrecy regarding their work. To avoid the possibility of suspicion, components were typically purchased through <a href="front%20company">front companies</a>, military officials would visit out of uniform, and staff members were routinely subjected to <a href="polygraph">polygraph</a> examinations. The secrecy extended so far that access to nearly all information on the program by both <a href="Government%20Accountability%20Office">Government Accountability Office</a> (GAO) and virtually all members of Congress itself was severely limited until the mid-1980s. Northrop (now Northrop Grumman) was the B-2's prime contractor; major subcontractors included <a href="Boeing%20Integrated%20Defense%20Systems">Boeing</a>, <a href="Hughes%20Aircraft">Hughes Aircraft</a> (now <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a>), <a href="GE%20Aviation">GE</a>, and <a href="Vought%20Aircraft%20Industries">Vought Aircraft</a>.

In 1984, a <a href="Northrop%20Corporation">Northrop</a> employee, <a href="Thomas%20Patrick%20Cavanaugh">Thomas Cavanaugh</a> was arrested for attempting to sell <a href="classified%20information">classified information</a> to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>; the information was taken from Northrop's Pico Rivera, California factory. Cavanaugh was eventually sentenced to life in prison and released on parole in 2001.

The B-2 was first publicly displayed on 22 November 1988 at <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force%20Plant%2042">United States Air Force Plant 42</a> in <a href="Palmdale%2C%20California">Palmdale, California</a>, where it was assembled. This viewing was heavily restricted, and guests were not allowed to see the rear of the B-2. However, "<a href="Aviation%20Week%20%26amp%3B%20Space%20Technology">Aviation Week</a>" editors found that there were no airspace restrictions above the presentation area and took photographs of the aircraft's then-secret rear section with suppressed engine exhausts from the air, to the USAF's disappointment. The B-2's (s/n 82-1066 / AV-1) first public flight was on 17 July 1989 from Palmdale to Edwards AFB.

In October 2005, <a href="Noshir%20Gowadia">Noshir Gowadia</a>, a design engineer who worked on the B-2's propulsion system, was arrested for selling B-2 related classified information to foreign countries. Gowadia was convicted and sentenced to 32 years in prison for his actions.

A procurement of 132 aircraft was planned in the mid-1980s, but was later reduced to 75. By the early 1990s, the Soviet Union dissolved, effectively eliminating the Spirit's primary Cold War mission. Under budgetary pressures and Congressional opposition, in his 1992 <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union%20Address">State of the Union Address</a>, President <a href="George%20H.W.%20Bush">George H.W. Bush</a> announced B-2 production would be limited to 20 aircraft. In 1996, however, the Clinton administration, though originally committed to ending production of the bombers at 20 aircraft, authorized the conversion of a 21st bomber, a <a href="prototype">prototype</a> test model, to Block 30 fully operational status at a cost of nearly $500 million.

In 1995, Northrop made a proposal to the USAF to build 20 additional aircraft with a <a href="flyaway%20cost">flyaway cost</a> of $566 million each.

The program was the subject of public controversy for its cost to American taxpayers. In 1996, the <a href="Government%20Accountability%20Office">General Accounting Office</a> (GAO) disclosed that the USAF's B-2 bombers "will be, by far, the most costly bombers to operate on a per aircraft basis", costing over three times as much as the <a href="Rockwell%20B-1%20Lancer">B-1B</a> (US$9.6 million annually) and over four times as much as the B-52H (US$6.8 million annually). In September 1997, each hour of B-2 flight necessitated 119 hours of maintenance in turn. Comparable maintenance needs for the B-52 and the B-1B are 53 and 60 hours respectively for each hour of flight. A key reason for this cost is the provision of air-conditioned hangars large enough for the bomber's wingspan, which are needed to maintain the aircraft's stealthy properties, particularly its "low-observable" stealthy skins. Maintenance costs are about $3.4 million a month for each aircraft.

The total "military construction" cost related to the program was projected to be US$553.6 million in 1997 dollars. The cost to procure each B-2 was US$737 million in 1997 dollars, based only on a fleet cost of US$15.48 billion. The procurement cost per aircraft as detailed in GAO reports, which include spare parts and software support, was $929 million per aircraft in 1997 dollars.

The total program cost projected through 2004 was US$44.75 billion in 1997 dollars. This includes development, procurement, facilities, construction, and spare parts. The total program cost averaged US$2.13 billion per aircraft. The B-2 may cost up to $135,000 per flight hour to operate in 2010, which is about twice that of the B-52 and B-1.

In its consideration of the fiscal year 1990 defense budget, the House Armed Services Committee trimmed $800 million from the B-2 <a href="research%20and%20development">research and development</a> budget, while at the same time staving off a motion to end the project. Opposition in committee and in Congress was mostly broad and bipartisan, with Congressmen <a href="Ron%20Dellums">Ron Dellums</a> (D-CA), <a href="John%20Kasich">John Kasich</a> (R-OH), and <a href="John%20G.%20Rowland">John G. Rowland</a> (R-CT) authorizing the motion to end the project—as well as others in the Senate, including <a href="Jim%20Exon">Jim Exon</a> (D-NE) and <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a> (R-AZ) also opposing the project.

The escalating cost of the B-2 program and evidence of flaws in the aircraft's ability to elude detection by radar were among factors that drove opposition to continue the program. At the peak production period specified in 1989, the schedule called for spending US$7 billion to $8 billion per year in 1989 dollars, something Committee Chair <a href="Les%20Aspin">Les Aspin</a> (D-WI) said "won't fly financially." In 1990, the Department of Defense accused Northrop of using faulty components in the <a href="Aircraft%20flight%20control%20system">flight control system</a>; the threat posed by bird ingestion potentially damaging engine fan blades also required redesigning.

In time, a number of prominent members of Congress began to oppose the program's expansion, including later Democratic presidential nominee <a href="John%20Kerry">John Kerry</a>, who cast votes against the B-2 in 1989, 1991 and 1992 while a U.S. Senator, representing <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. By 1992, Republican President <a href="George%20H.W.%20Bush">George H.W. Bush</a> called for the cancellation of the B-2 and promised to cut military spending by 30% in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union. In October 1995, former <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force</a>, <a href="Michael%20E.%20Ryan">General Mike Ryan</a>, and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General <a href="John%20Shalikashvili">John Shalikashvili</a>, strongly recommended against Congressional action to fund the purchase of any additional B-2s, arguing that to do so would require unacceptable cuts in existing conventional and nuclear-capable aircraft, and that the military had greater priorities in spending a limited budget.

Some B-2 advocates argued that procuring twenty additional aircraft would save money because B-2s would be able to deeply penetrate anti-aircraft defenses and use low-cost, short-range attack weapons rather than expensive standoff weapons. However, in 1995, the <a href="Congressional%20Budget%20Office">Congressional Budget Office</a> (CBO), and its Director of National Security Analysis, found that additional B-2s would reduce the cost of expended munitions by less than US$2 billion in 1995 dollars during the first two weeks of a conflict, in which the Air Force predicted bombers would make their greatest contribution; a small fraction of the US$26.8 billion (in 1995 dollars) life cycle cost that the CBO projected for an additional 20 B-2s.

In 1997, as <a href="Ranking%20Member">Ranking Member</a> of the <a href="U.S.%20House%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">House Armed Services Committee</a> and National Security Committee, Congressman <a href="Ron%20Dellums">Ron Dellums</a> (D-CA), a long-time opponent of the bomber, cited five independent studies and offered an amendment to that year's defense authorization bill to cap production of the bombers to the existing 21 aircraft; the amendment was narrowly defeated. Nonetheless, Congress did not approve funding for the purchase of any additional B-2 bombers.

A number of upgrade packages have been applied to the B-2. In July 2008, the B-2's onboard computing architecture was extensively redesigned; it now incorporates a new integrated processing unit (IPU) that communicates with systems throughout the aircraft via a newly installed <a href="fiber%20optic">fiber optic</a> network; a new version of the operational flight program software was also developed, with legacy code converted from the <a href="JOVIAL">JOVIAL</a> programming language to standard <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a>. Updates were also made to the weapon control systems to enable strikes upon moving targets, such as ground vehicles.
On 29 December 2008, Air Force officials awarded a US$468 million contract to Northrop Grumman to modernize the B-2 fleet's radars. Changing the radar's frequency was required as the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Commerce">U.S. Department of Commerce</a> had sold that radio spectrum to another operator. In July 2009, it was reported that the B-2 had successfully passed a major USAF audit. In 2010, it was made public that the <a href="Air%20Force%20Research%20Laboratory">Air Force Research Laboratory</a> had developed a new material to be used on the part of the wing trailing edge subject to engine exhaust, replacing existing material that quickly degraded.

In July 2010, political analyst <a href="Rebecca%20Grant%20%28political%20expert%29">Rebecca Grant</a> speculated that when the B-2 becomes unable to reliably penetrate enemy defenses, the <a href="Lockheed%20Martin%20F-35%20Lightning%20II">Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II</a> may take on its strike/<a href="Air%20interdiction">interdiction</a> mission, carrying <a href="B61%20nuclear%20bomb">B61 nuclear bomb</a>s as a tactical bomber. However, in March 2012, the Pentagon announced that a $2 billion, 10-year-long modernization of the B-2 fleet was to begin. The main area of improvement would be replacement of outdated avionics and equipment.

It was reported in 2011 that the Pentagon was evaluating an unmanned stealth bomber, characterized as a "mini-B-2", as a potential replacement in the near future. In 2012, Air Force Chief of Staff General Norton Schwartz stated the B-2's 1980s-era stealth would make it less survivable in future contested airspaces, so the USAF is to proceed with the <a href="Next-Generation%20Bomber">Next-Generation Bomber</a> despite overall budget cuts. The Next-Generation Bomber was estimated, in 2012, to have a projected overall cost of $55 billion.

In 2013, the USAF contracted for the Defensive Management System Modernization program to replace the antenna system and other electronics to increase the B-2's frequency awareness. The Common Very Low Frequency Receiver upgrade will allow the B-2s to use the same <a href="very%20low%20frequency">very low frequency</a> transmissions as the <a href="Ohio-class%20submarine">"Ohio"-class submarine</a>s so as to continue in the nuclear mission until the <a href="Mobile%20User%20Objective%20System">Mobile User Objective System</a> is fielded.

In 2014, the USAF outlined a series of upgrades including nuclear war fighting, a new integrated processing unit, the ability to carry cruise missiles, and threat warning improvements.

The B-2 Spirit was developed to take over the USAF's vital penetration missions, able to travel deep into enemy territory to deploy their <a href="aircraft%20ordnance">ordnance</a>, which could include <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s. The B-2 is a <a href="flying%20wing">flying wing</a> aircraft, meaning it has no fuselage or tail. The blending of low-observable technologies with high aerodynamic efficiency and large payload gives the B-2 significant advantages over previous bombers. Low observability provides a greater freedom of action at high altitudes, thus increasing both range and field of view for onboard sensors. The U.S. Air Force reports its range as approximately . At cruising altitude the B-2 <a href="aerial%20refueling">refuels</a> every six hours, taking on up to of fuel at a time.

Due to the aircraft's complex flight characteristics and design requirements to maintain very-low visibility to multiple means of detection, both the development and construction of the B-2 required pioneering use of <a href="computer-aided%20design">computer-aided design</a> and <a href="computer-aided%20manufacturing">manufacturing</a> technologies. The B-2 bears a resemblance to earlier Northrop aircraft: the <a href="Northrop%20YB-35">YB-35</a> and <a href="Northrop%20YB-49">YB-49</a> were both flying wing bombers that had been canceled in development in the early 1950s, allegedly for political reasons. The resemblance goes as far as B-2 and YB-49 having the same wingspan.

The B-2, in the envisaged Cold War scenario, was to perform deep-penetrating nuclear strike missions, making use of its stealthy capabilities to avoid detection and interception throughout missions. There are two internal bomb bays in which munitions are stored either on a rotary launcher or two bomb-racks; the carriage of the weapons loadouts internally results in less radar visibility than external mounting of munitions. The B-2 is capable of carrying of ordnance. Nuclear ordnance includes the <a href="B61%20nuclear%20bomb">B61</a> and <a href="B83%20nuclear%20bomb">B83 nuclear bomb</a>s; the <a href="AGM-129%20ACM">AGM-129 ACM</a> cruise missile was also intended for use on the B-2 platform.

It was decided, in light of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, to equip the B-2 for conventional precision attacks as well as for the strategic role of nuclear-strike. The B-2 features a sophisticated GPS-Aided Targeting System (GATS) that uses the aircraft's <a href="APQ-181%20radar">APQ-181</a> <a href="synthetic%20aperture%20radar">synthetic aperture radar</a> to map out targets prior to deployment of <a href="Global%20Positioning%20System">GPS</a>-aided bombs (<a href="GBU-37">GAMs</a>), later superseded by the <a href="Joint%20Direct%20Attack%20Munition">Joint Direct Attack Munition</a> (JDAM). In the B-2's original configuration, up to 16 GAMs or JDAMs could be deployed; an upgrade program in 2004 raised the maximum carriable capacity to 80 JDAMs.

The B-2 has various conventional weapons in its arsenal, able to equip <a href="Mark%2082%20bomb">Mark 82</a> and <a href="Mark%2084%20bomb">Mark 84 bomb</a>s, <a href="CBU-87%20Combined%20Effects%20Munition">CBU-87 Combined Effects Munition</a>s, <a href="GATOR%20mine%20system">GATOR mine</a>s, and the <a href="CBU-97%20Sensor%20Fuzed%20Weapon">CBU-97 Sensor Fuzed Weapon</a>. In July 2009, Northrop Grumman reported the B-2 was compatible with the equipment necessary to deploy the <a href="Massive%20Ordnance%20Penetrator">Massive Ordnance Penetrator</a> (MOP), which is intended to attack reinforced <a href="bunker">bunker</a>s; up to two MOPs could be equipped in the B-2's bomb bays, the B-2 is the only platform compatible with the MOP as of 2012. As of 2011, the <a href="AGM-158%20JASSM">AGM-158 JASSM</a> <a href="cruise%20missile">cruise missile</a> is an upcoming standoff munition to be deployed on the B-2 and other platforms. This is to be followed by the <a href="Long%20Range%20Standoff%20Weapon">Long Range Standoff Weapon</a> which may give the B-2 a standoff nuclear capability for the first time.

In order to make the B-2 more effective than previous bombers, many advanced and modern avionics systems were integrated into its design; these have been modified and improved following a switch to conventional warfare missions. One system is the <a href="low%20probability%20of%20intercept">low probability of intercept</a> <a href="AN/APQ-181">AN/APQ-181</a> multi-mode radar, a fully digital navigation system that is integrated with <a href="terrain-following%20radar">terrain-following radar</a> and <a href="Global%20Positioning%20System">Global Positioning System</a> (GPS) guidance, NAS-26 <a href="astro-inertial%20navigation%20system">astro-inertial navigation system</a> (first such system tested on the Northrop <a href="SM-62%20Snark">SM-62 Snark</a> cruise missile) and a Defensive Management System (DMS) to inform the flight crew of possible threats. The onboard DMS is capable of automatically assessing the detection capabilities of identified threats and indicated targets. The DMS will be upgraded by 2021 to detect radar emissions from air defenses to allow changes to the auto-router's mission planning information while in-flight so it can receive new data quickly to plan a route that minimizes exposure to dangers.
For safety and fault-detection purposes, an on-board test system is linked with the majority of avionics on the B-2 to continuously monitor the performance and status of thousands of components and consumables; it also provides post-mission servicing instructions for ground crews. In 2008, many of the 136 standalone distributed computers on board the B-2, including the primary flight management computer, were being replaced by a single integrated system. The avionics are controlled by 13 <a href="Electromagnetic%20pulse">EMP</a>-resistant <a href="MIL-STD-1750A">MIL-STD-1750A</a> computers, which are interconnected through 26 <a href="MIL-STD-1553">MIL-STD-1553</a>B-<a href="bus%20%28computing%29">busses</a>; other system elements are connected via <a href="optical%20fiber">optical fiber</a>.

In addition to periodic software upgrades and the introduction of new radar-absorbent materials across the fleet, the B-2 has had several major upgrades to its avionics and combat systems. For battlefield communications, both <a href="Link-16">Link-16</a> and a high frequency satellite link have been installed, compatibility with various new munitions has been undertaken, and the AN/APQ-181 radar's operational frequency was shifted in order to avoid interference with other operator's equipment. The arrays of the upgraded radar features were entirely replaced to make the AN/APQ-181 into an <a href="active%20electronically%20scanned%20array">active electronically scanned array</a> (AESA) radar.

In order to address the inherent flight instability of a <a href="flying%20wing">flying wing</a> aircraft, the B-2 uses a complex quadruplex computer-controlled <a href="fly-by-wire">fly-by-wire</a> flight control system, that can automatically manipulate flight surfaces and settings without direct pilot inputs in order to maintain aircraft stability. The flight computer receives information on external conditions such as the aircraft's current air speed and angle of attack via <a href="pitot%20tube">pitot</a>-static sensing plates, as opposed to traditional <a href="pitot%20tube">pitot tube</a>s which would negatively affect the aircraft's stealth capabilities. The flight actuation system incorporates both hydraulic and electrical servoactuated components, and it was designed with a high level of redundancy and fault-diagnostic capabilities.

Northrop had investigated several means of applying directional control that would least infringe on the aircraft's radar profile, eventually settling on a combination of split brake-rudders and differential thrust. Engine thrust became a key element of the B-2's aerodynamic design process early on; thrust not only affects drag and lift but pitching and rolling motions as well. Four pairs of control surfaces are located along the wing's trailing edge; while most surfaces are used throughout the aircraft's flight envelope, the inner elevons are normally only in use at slow speeds, such as landing. To avoid potential contact damage during takeoff and to provide a nose-down pitching attitude, all of the elevons remain drooped during takeoff until a high enough airspeed has been attained.

The B-2's low-observable, or "<a href="stealth%20technology">stealth</a>", characteristics enable the undetected penetration of sophisticated anti-aircraft defenses and to attack even heavily defended targets. This stealth comes from a combination of reduced <a href="Acoustic%20signature">acoustic</a>, <a href="Infrared%20signature">infrared</a>, <a href="Aircraft%20camouflage">visual</a> and <a href="Radar%20cross-section">radar signature</a>s (<a href="multi-spectral%20camouflage">multi-spectral camouflage</a>) to evade the various detection systems that could be used to detect and be used to direct attacks against an aircraft. The B-2's stealth enables the reduction of supporting aircraft that are required to provide air cover, <a href="Suppression%20of%20Enemy%20Air%20Defenses">Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses</a> and <a href="electronic%20countermeasure">electronic countermeasure</a>s, making the bomber a "<a href="force%20multiplier">force multiplier</a>". , there have been no instances of a missile being launched at a B-2.

To reduce optical visibility during daylight flights, the B-2 is painted in an <a href="aircraft%20camouflage">anti-reflective paint</a>. The undersides are dark because it flies at high altitudes (), and at that altitude a dark grey painting blends well into the sky. It is speculated to have an upward-facing <a href="Photodetector">light sensor</a> which alerts the pilot to increase or reduce altitude to match the changing illuminance of the sky. The original design had tanks for a <a href="contrail">contrail</a>-inhibiting chemical, but this was replaced in production aircraft by a contrail sensor that alerts the crew when they should change altitude. The B-2 is vulnerable to visual interception at ranges of or less.

Reportedly, the B-2 has a <a href="radar%20cross-section">radar cross-section</a> (RCS) of about . The bomber does not always fly stealthily; when nearing air defenses pilots "stealth up" the B-2, a manoeuvre whose details are secret. The aircraft is stealthy, except briefly when the bomb bay opens. The B-2's clean, low-drag <a href="flying%20wing">flying wing</a> configuration not only provides exceptional range but is also beneficial to reducing its radar profile. The flying wing design most closely resembles a so-called infinite flat plate (as vertical control surfaces dramatically increase RCS), the perfect stealth shape, as it would lack angles to reflect back radar waves (initially, the shape of the Northrop ATB concept was flatter; it gradually increased in volume according to specific military requirements).
RCS reduction as a result of shape had already been observed on the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>'s <a href="Avro%20Vulcan">Avro Vulcan</a> strategic bomber, and the USAF's <a href="Lockheed%20F-117%20Nighthawk">F-117 Nighthawk</a>. The F-117 used flat surfaces (<a href="faceting">faceting</a> technique) for controlling radar returns as during its development (see <a href="Lockheed%20Have%20Blue">Lockheed Have Blue</a>) in the early 1970s, technology only allowed for the simulation of radar reflections on simple, flat surfaces; computing advances in the 1980s made it possible to simulate radar returns on more complex curved surfaces. The B-2 is composed of many curved and rounded surfaces across its exposed airframe to deflect radar beams. This technique, known as "continuous curvature", was made possible by advances in <a href="computational%20fluid%20dynamics">computational fluid dynamics</a>, and first tested on the <a href="Northrop%20Tacit%20Blue">Northrop Tacit Blue</a>.

Some analysts claim <a href="infra-red%20search%20and%20track">infra-red search and track</a> systems (IRSTs) can be deployed against stealth aircraft, because any aircraft surface heats up due to air friction and with a two channel IRST is a CO2 (4.3 µm absorption maxima) detection possible, through difference comparing between the low and high channel.

Burying engines deep inside the fuselage also minimizes the thermal visibility or <a href="infrared%20signature">infrared signature</a> of the exhaust. At the engine intake, cold air from the <a href="boundary%20layer">boundary layer</a> below the main inlet enters the fuselage (<a href="boundary%20layer%20suction">boundary layer suction</a>, first tested on the <a href="Northrop%20X-21">Northrop X-21</a>) and is mixed with hot exhaust air just before the <a href="nozzle">nozzle</a>s (similar to the <a href="Ryan%20AQM-91%20Firefly">Ryan AQM-91 Firefly</a>). According to the <a href="Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann%20law">Stefan–Boltzmann law</a>, this results in less energy (<a href="thermal%20radiation">thermal radiation</a> in the infrared spectrum) being released and thus a reduced heat signature. The resulting cooler air is conducted over a surface composed of heat resistant <a href="carbon-fiber-reinforced%20polymer">carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer</a> and <a href="titanium%20alloy">titanium alloy</a> elements, which disperse the air laterally, in order to accelerate its cooling. The B-2 lacks <a href="afterburner">afterburner</a>s as the hot exhaust would increase the infrared footprint; breaking the <a href="sound%20barrier">sound barrier</a> would produce an obvious <a href="sonic%20boom">sonic boom</a> as well as <a href="aerodynamic%20heating">aerodynamic heating</a> of the <a href="aircraft%20skin">aircraft skin</a> which would also increase the infrared footprint.

According to the <a href="Huygens%E2%80%93Fresnel%20principle">Huygens–Fresnel principle</a>, even a very flat plate would still reflect radar waves, though much less than when a signal is bouncing at a right angle. Additional reduction in its radar signature was achieved by the use of various <a href="radar-absorbent%20material">radar-absorbent material</a>s (RAM) to absorb and neutralize radar beams. The majority of the B-2 is made out of a <a href="carbon">carbon</a>-<a href="graphite">graphite</a> <a href="composite%20material">composite material</a> that is stronger than steel, lighter than aluminum, and absorbs a significant amount of radar energy.

The B-2 is assembled with unusually tight <a href="engineering%20tolerance">engineering tolerance</a>s to avoid leaks as they could increase its radar signature. Innovations such as alternate <a href="high%20frequency">high frequency</a> material (AHFM) and automated material application methods were also incorporated to improve the aircraft's radar-absorbent properties and reduce maintenance requirements. In early 2004, Northrop Grumman began applying a newly developed AHFM to operational B-2s. In order to protect the operational integrity of its sophisticated radar absorbent material and coatings, each B-2 is kept inside a climate-controlled hangar (Extra Large Deployable Aircraft Hangar System) large enough to accommodate its wingspan.

The first operational aircraft, christened "Spirit of Missouri", was delivered to <a href="Whiteman%20Air%20Force%20Base">Whiteman Air Force Base</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, where the fleet is based, on 17 December 1993. The B-2 reached initial operational capability (IOC) on 1 January 1997. Depot maintenance for the B-2 is accomplished by U.S. Air Force contractor support and managed at <a href="Oklahoma%20City%20Air%20Logistics%20Center">Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center</a> at <a href="Tinker%20Air%20Force%20Base">Tinker Air Force Base</a>. Originally designed to deliver nuclear weapons, modern usage has shifted towards a flexible role with conventional and nuclear capability.

The B-2's combat debut was in 1999, during the <a href="Kosovo%20War">Kosovo War</a>. It was responsible for destroying 33% of selected Serbian bombing <a href="Bullseye%20%28target%29">targets</a> in the first eight weeks of U.S. involvement in the War. During this war, six B-2s flew non-stop to Kosovo from their home base in Missouri and back, totalling 30 hours. Although the bombers accounted 50 sorties out of a total of 34,000 NATO sorties, they dropped 11 percent of all bombs. The B-2 was the first aircraft to deploy GPS satellite-guided <a href="Joint%20Direct%20Attack%20Munition">JDAM "smart bombs"</a> in combat use in Kosovo. The use of JDAMs and precision-guided munitions effectively replaced the controversial tactic of <a href="Carpet%20bombing">carpet-bombing</a>, which had been harshly criticized due to it causing indiscriminate civilian casualties in prior conflicts, such as the <a href="1991%20Gulf%20War">1991 Gulf War</a>. On 7 May 1999, a B-2 <a href="U.S.%20bombing%20of%20the%20Chinese%20embassy%20in%20Belgrade">dropped five JDAMs on the Chinese Embassy</a>, killing several staff. By then, the B-2 had dropped 500 bombs in Kosovo.

The B-2 saw service in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, striking ground targets in support of <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">Operation Enduring Freedom</a>. With aerial refueling support, the B-2 flew one of its longest missions to date from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri to Afghanistan and back. B-2s would be stationed in the Middle East as a part of a US military buildup in the region from 2003.

The B-2's combat use preceded a U.S. Air Force declaration of "full operational capability" in December 2003. The Pentagon's Operational Test and Evaluation 2003 Annual Report noted that the B-2's serviceability for Fiscal Year 2003 was still inadequate, mainly due to the maintainability of the B-2's low observable coatings. The evaluation also noted that the Defensive Avionics suite had shortcomings with "pop-up threats".

During the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a> (Operation Iraqi Freedom), B-2s operated from <a href="Diego%20Garcia">Diego Garcia</a> and an undisclosed "forward operating location". Other <a href="sortie">sortie</a>s in Iraq have launched from Whiteman AFB. the longest combat mission has been 44.3 hours. "Forward operating locations" have been previously designated as <a href="Andersen%20Air%20Force%20Base">Andersen Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Guam">Guam</a> and <a href="RAF%20Fairford">RAF Fairford</a> in the United Kingdom, where new climate controlled hangars have been constructed. B-2s have conducted 27 sorties from Whiteman AFB and 22 sorties from a forward operating location, releasing more than of munitions, including 583 JDAM "smart bombs" in 2003.

In response to organizational issues and high-profile mistakes made within the Air Force, all of the B-2s, along with the nuclear-capable B-52s and the Air Force's <a href="intercontinental%20ballistic%20missile">intercontinental ballistic missile</a>s (ICBMs), were transferred to the newly formed <a href="Air%20Force%20Global%20Strike%20Command">Air Force Global Strike Command</a> on 1 February 2010.

In March 2011, B-2s were the first U.S. aircraft into action in <a href="Operation%20Odyssey%20Dawn">Operation Odyssey Dawn</a>, the UN mandated enforcement of the <a href="Libyan%20no-fly%20zone">Libyan no-fly zone</a>. Three B-2s dropped 40 bombs on a Libyan airfield in support of the UN no-fly zone. The B-2s flew directly from the U.S. mainland across the Atlantic Ocean to Libya; a B-2 was refueled by allied tanker aircraft four times during each round trip mission.

In August 2011, "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" reported that prior to the May 2011 U.S. Special Operations raid into <a href="Abbottabad">Abbottabad</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> that resulted in the <a href="death%20of%20Osama%20bin%20Laden">death of Osama bin Laden</a>, U.S. officials had considered an airstrike by one or more B-2s as an alternative; an airstrike was rejected because of damage to civilian buildings in the area from using a <a href="bunker%20buster">bunker busting</a> bomb. There were also concerns an airstrike would make it difficult to positively identify Bin Laden's remains and so concluding he was in fact dead would be problematic.

On 28 March 2013, two B-2s flew a round trip of from Whiteman Air Force base in Missouri to South Korea, dropping dummy ordnance on the Jik Do target range. The mission, part of the annual South Korean–United States military exercises, was the first time that B-2s overflew the Korean peninsula. Tensions between North and South Korea were high during; after the exercise North Korea protested against the participation of the B-2s and made threats of retaliatory nuclear strikes against South Korea and the United States.

On 18 January 2017, two B-2s flew sorties over ISIS training camps in <a href="Sirte%2C%20Libya">Sirte, Libya</a>, killing nearly 100 militants. The B-2s together dropped about a hundred 500-pound precision-guided bombs, or <a href="Joint%20Direct%20Attack%20Munitions">Joint Direct Attack Munitions</a> (JDAMs). These strikes were followed with an <a href="General%20Atomics%20MQ-9%20Reaper">MQ-9 Reaper</a> unmanned aerial vehicle firing Hellfire missiles. Each B-2 flew a 34-hour, round-trip mission from Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri with 15 refuelings during the trip.

<a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (20 aircraft in active inventory)

On 23 February 2008, B-2 "AV-12" "Spirit of Kansas" crashed on the runway shortly after takeoff from <a href="Andersen%20Air%20Force%20Base">Andersen Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Guam">Guam</a>. "Spirit of Kansas" had been operated by the <a href="393rd%20Bomb%20Squadron">393rd Bomb Squadron</a>, <a href="509th%20Bomb%20Wing">509th Bomb Wing</a>, <a href="Whiteman%20Air%20Force%20Base">Whiteman Air Force Base</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>, and had logged 5,176 flight hours. The two person crew ejected safely from the aircraft and survived the crash. The aircraft was completely destroyed, a <a href="hull%20loss">hull loss</a> valued at US$1.4 billion. After the accident, the Air Force took the B-2 fleet off operational status until clearing the fleet for flight status 53 days later on 15 April 2008. The cause of the crash was later determined to be moisture in the aircraft's Port Transducer Units during air data calibration, which distorted the information being sent to the bomber's air data system. As a result, the flight control computers calculated an inaccurate airspeed, and a negative angle of attack, causing the aircraft to pitch upward 30 degrees during takeoff. This was the first crash of a B-2 and the only loss .

In February 2010, another serious incident involving a B-2 occurred at Andersen AFB. The aircraft involved was AV-11 "Spirit of Washington". The aircraft was severely damaged by fire while on the ground and underwent 18 months of repairs in order to enable it to fly back to the mainland for more comprehensive repairs. "Spirit of Washington" was repaired and returned to service in December 2013. At the time of the accident the USAF had no training to deal with tailpipe fires on the B-2s.

No operational B-2s have been retired by the Air Force to be put on display. B-2s have made periodic appearances on ground display at various <a href="air%20show">air show</a>s.

B-2 test article (s/n AT-1000), the second of two built without engines or instruments for static testing, was placed on display in 2004 at the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Air%20Force">National Museum of the United States Air Force</a> near <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>. The test article passed all structural testing requirements before the airframe failed. The museum's restoration team spent over a year reassembling the fractured airframe. The display airframe is marked to resemble "The Spirit of Ohio" (S/N 82-1070), the B-2 used to test the design's ability to withstand extreme heat and cold. The exhibit features "Spirit of Ohio"s nose wheel door, with its "Fire and Ice" artwork, which was painted and signed by the technicians who performed the temperature testing. The restored test aircraft is on display in the museum's "Cold War Gallery".

Beaver

The beaver (<a href="genus">genus</a> Castor) is a large, primarily <a href="nocturnal%20animal">nocturnal</a>, <a href="List%20of%20semiaquatic%20tetrapods">semiaquatic</a> <a href="rodent">rodent</a>. "Castor" includes two <a href="extant%20taxon">extant</a> species, the <a href="North%20American%20beaver">North American beaver</a> ("Castor canadensis") (native to North America) and <a href="Eurasian%20beaver">Eurasian beaver</a> ("Castor fiber") (<a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>). Beavers are known for building dams, canals, and lodges (homes). They are the second-largest rodent in the world (after the <a href="capybara">capybara</a>). Their colonies create one or more dams to provide still, deep water to protect against predators, and to float food and building material. The North American beaver population was once more than 60 million, but as of 1988 was 6–12 million. This population decline is the result of extensive hunting for fur, for glands used as medicine and perfume, and because the beavers' harvesting of trees and flooding of waterways may interfere with other land uses.

Beavers, along with <a href="Geomyidae">pocket gophers</a> and <a href="Heteromyidae">kangaroo rats</a>, are <a href="Castorimorpha">castorimorph</a> rodents, a suborder of rodents mostly restricted to North America. Although just two closely related species exist today, beavers have a long fossil history in the Northern Hemisphere beginning in the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a>, and many species of giant beaver existed until quite recently, such as "<a href="Trogontherium">Trogontherium</a>" in Europe, and "<a href="Castoroides">Castoroides</a>" in North America.

Beavers are known for their natural trait of building dams on rivers and streams, and building their homes (known as "lodges") in the resulting pond. Beavers also build canals to float building materials that are difficult to haul over land. They use powerful front teeth to cut trees and other plants that they use both for building and for food. In the absence of existing ponds, beavers must construct dams before building their lodges. First they place vertical poles, then fill between the poles with a crisscross of horizontally placed branches. They fill in the gaps between the branches with a combination of weeds and mud until the dam impounds sufficient water to surround the lodge.

They are known for their alarm signal: when startled or frightened, a swimming beaver will rapidly dive while forcefully slapping the water with its broad tail, audible over great distances above and below water. This serves as a warning to beavers in the area. Once a beaver has sounded the alarm, nearby beavers will dive and may not reemerge for some time. Beavers are slow on land, but are good swimmers, and can stay under water for as long as 15 minutes.

Beavers are herbivores, and prefer the wood of <a href="quaking%20aspen">quaking aspen</a>, <a href="Populus%20sect.%20Aigeiros">cottonwood</a>, <a href="willow">willow</a>, <a href="alder">alder</a>, <a href="birch">birch</a>, <a href="maple">maple</a> and <a href="cherry">cherry</a> trees. They also eat <a href="sedges">sedges</a>, <a href="pondweed">pondweed</a>, and <a href="Nymphaeaceae">water lilies</a>.

Beavers do not hibernate, but store sticks and logs in a pile in their ponds, eating the underbark. Some of the pile is generally above water and accumulates snow in the winter. This insulation of snow often keeps the water from freezing in and around the food pile, providing a location where beavers can breathe when outside their lodge.

Beavers have webbed hind-feet, and a broad, scaly tail. They have poor eyesight, but keen senses of hearing, smell, and touch. A beaver's teeth grow continuously so that they will not be worn down by chewing on wood. Their four incisors are composed of hard orange enamel on the front and a softer <a href="dentin">dentin</a> on the back. The chisel-like ends of incisors are maintained by their self-sharpening wear pattern. The enamel in a beaver's incisors contains iron and is more resistant to acid than enamel in the teeth of other mammals.

Beavers continue to grow throughout their lives. Adult specimens weighing over are not uncommon. Females are as large as or larger than males of the same age, which is uncommon among <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s. Beavers live up to 24 years of age in the wild.

The English word "beaver" comes from the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> word "beofor" or "befer" (recorded earlier as "bebr"), which in turn sprang from the <a href="Proto-Germanic%20language">Proto-Germanic</a> root "*bebruz". <a href="Cognate">Cognate</a>s in other <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic languages</a> include the <a href="Old%20Saxon">Old Saxon</a> "bibar", the <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> "bjorr", the <a href="Middle%20Dutch">Middle Dutch</a> and <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> "bever", the <a href="Low%20German">Low German</a> "bever", the <a href="Old%20High%20German">Old High German</a> "bibar" and the <a href="German%20language">Modern German</a> "Biber". The Proto-Germanic word in turn came from the <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> (PIE) word "*bhebhrus", a reduplication of the PIE root "*bher-", meaning "brown" or "bright", whose own descendants now include the <a href="Lithuanian%20language">Lithuanian</a> "bebras", the <a href="Czech%20language">Czech</a> "bobr" and the <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a> "befer", as well as the Germanic forms.

The North American and Eurasian beavers are the only <a href="extant%20taxon">extant</a> members of the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Castoridae">Castoridae</a>, contained in a single <a href="genus">genus</a>, Castor. <a href="genetics">Genetic</a> research has shown the modern European and North American beaver populations to be distinct species and that <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrid</a>ization is unlikely. Although superficially similar to each other, there are several important differences between the two species. Eurasian beavers tend to be slightly larger, with larger, less rounded heads, longer, narrower muzzles, thinner, shorter and lighter underfur, narrower, less oval-shaped tails and shorter shin bones, making them less capable of bipedal locomotion than the North American species. Eurasian beavers have longer nasal bones than their North American cousins, with the widest point being at the end of the snout for the former, and in the middle for the latter. The nasal opening for the Eurasian species is triangular, unlike that of the North American race, which is square. The "<a href="foramen%20magnum">foramen magnum</a>" is rounded in the Eurasian beaver and triangular in the North American. The <a href="anal%20gland">anal gland</a>s of the Eurasian beaver are larger and thin-walled with a large internal volume compared to that of the North American species. The guard hairs of the Eurasian beaver have a longer hollow medulla at their tips. Fur colour is also different. Overall, 66% of Eurasian beavers have pale brown or beige fur, 20% have reddish brown, nearly 8% are brown and only 4% have blackish coats. In North American beavers, 50% have pale brown fur, 25% are reddish brown, 20% are brown and 6% are blackish.

The two species are not genetically compatible. North American beavers have 40 <a href="chromosomes">chromosomes</a>, while Eurasian beavers have 48. More than 27 attempts were made in Russia to hybridize the two species, with one breeding between a male North American beaver and a female European resulting in a single stillborn kit. These factors make interspecific breeding unlikely in areas where the two species' ranges overlap.

The Eurasian beaver ("Castor fiber") was nearly hunted to <a href="extinction">extinction</a> in Europe, both for fur and for "<a href="castoreum">castoreum</a>", a secretion from its scent gland believed to have medicinal properties. However, the beaver is now being re-introduced throughout Europe. Several thousand live on the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> and the <a href="Rh%C3%B4ne">Rhône</a> and in parts of <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>. A thriving community lives in northeast Poland, and the Eurasian beaver also returned to the <a href="Morava%20%28river%29">Morava River</a> banks in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. They have been <a href="reintroduction">reintroduced</a> in Scotland (<a href="Knapdale">Knapdale</a>), <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, Austria, Netherlands, Serbia (<a href="Zasavica%20%28bog%29">Zasavica</a> bog), Denmark (West <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a>) and Bulgaria and are spreading to new locations. The beaver became extinct in Great Britain in the sixteenth century: <a href="Giraldus%20Cambrensis">Giraldus Cambrensis</a> reported in 1188 ("Itinerarium" ii.iii) that it was to be found only in the <a href="Teifi">Teifi</a> in Wales and in one river in Scotland, though his observations are clearly second hand. In 2001, <a href="Kent%20Wildlife%20Trust">Kent Wildlife Trust</a> successfully introduced a family of beavers at Ham Fen, the last remaining ancient fenland in the county close to the town of <a href="Sandwich%2C%20Kent">Sandwich</a>; these are now established and are breeding. In October 2005, six Eurasian beavers were reintroduced to Britain in Lower Mill Estate in <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>; in July 2007 a colony of four Eurasian beavers was established at <a href="Martin%20Mere">Martin Mere</a> in Lancashire, and a small population of probably Eurasian beavers is being monitored in Devon. A trial re-introduction occurred in Scotland in May 2009. Feasibility studies for a reintroduction to Wales are at an advanced stage and a preliminary study for a reintroduction of beavers to the wild in England has recently been published.

The North American beaver ("Castor canadensis"), also called the Canadian beaver (which is also the name of a subspecies), American beaver, or simply beaver in North America, is native to Canada, much of the United States and parts of northern Mexico. This species was introduced to the Argentine and Chilean Tierra del Fuego, as well as Finland, France, Poland and Russia.

The North American beavers prefer the (inner) bark of aspen and poplar but will also take birch, maple, willow, alder, black cherry, red oak, beech, ash, hornbeam and occasionally pine and spruce. They will also eat <a href="cattails">cattails</a>, <a href="Nymphaeaceae">water lilies</a> and other aquatic vegetation, especially in the early spring (and contrary to widespread belief, they do not eat fish).

These animals are often trapped for their fur. During the early 19th century, trapping eliminated this animal from large portions of its original range. Beaver furs were used to make clothing and top-hats. Much of the early exploration of North America was driven by the quest for this animal's fur.

Native peoples and early settlers also ate this animal's meat. Through trap and transfer and <a href="habitat%20conservation">habitat conservation</a>, beavers made a nearly complete recovery by the 1940s. The current beaver population has been estimated to be 10 to 15 million; one estimate claims that there may at one time have been as many as 90 million.

The habitat of the beaver is the <a href="riparian%20zone">riparian zone</a>, inclusive of stream bed. The actions of beavers for hundreds of thousands of years in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a> have kept these watery systems healthy and in good repair.

The beaver works as a <a href="keystone%20species">keystone species</a> in an <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a> by creating <a href="wetlands">wetlands</a> that are used by many other species. Next to humans, no other extant animal appears to do more to shape its landscape. Beavers potentially even affect <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>.

Beavers fell trees for several reasons. They fell large mature trees, usually in strategic locations, to form the basis of a dam, but European beavers tend to use small diameter (<10 cm) trees for this purpose. Beavers fell small trees, especially young second-growth trees, for food.

Broadleaved trees re-grow as a <a href="coppice">coppice</a>, providing easy-to-reach stems and leaves for food in subsequent years. Ponds created by beavers can also kill some tree species by drowning, but this creates standing dead wood, which is very important for a wide range of animals and plants.

Beaver dams are created as a protection against predators, such as coyotes, wolves and bears, and to provide easy access to food during winter. Beavers always work at night and are prolific builders, carrying mud and stones with their fore-paws and timber between their teeth. Because of this, destroying a beaver dam without removing the beavers is difficult, especially if the dam is downstream of an active lodge. Beavers can rebuild such primary dams overnight, though they may not defend secondary dams as vigorously. Beavers may create a series of dams along a river.

The ponds created by well-maintained dams help isolate the beavers' homes, which are called "lodges". These are created from severed branches and mud. The beavers cover their lodges late each autumn with fresh mud, which freezes when frosts arrive. The mud becomes almost as hard as stone, thereby preventing <a href="gray%20wolf">wolves</a> and <a href="wolverine">wolverine</a>s from penetrating the lodge.
The lodge has underwater entrances, which makes entry nearly impossible for any other animal, although <a href="muskrats">muskrats</a> have been seen living inside beaver lodges with the beavers who made them. Only a small amount of the lodge is actually used as a living area. Beavers dig out their dens with underwater entrances after they finish building the dams and lodge structures. There are typically two dens within the lodge, one for drying off after exiting the water and another, drier one, in which the family lives.

Beaver lodges are constructed with the same materials as the dams, with little order or regularity of structure. They seldom house more than four adults and six or eight juveniles. Some larger lodges have one or more partitions, but these are only posts of the main building left by the builders to support the roof. Usually, the dens have no connection with each other except by water.

When the ice breaks up in spring, beavers usually leave their lodges and roam until just before autumn, when they return to their old lodges and gather their winter stock of wood. They seldom begin to repair the lodges until the frost sets in, and rarely finish the outer coating until the cold becomes severe. When they erect a new lodge, they fell the wood early in summer but seldom begin building until nearly the end of August.

Beaver ponds, and the wetlands that succeed them, remove sediments and pollutants from waterways, including total suspended solids, total nitrogen, phosphates, carbon and silicates.

The term "beaver fever" is a misnomer coined by the American press in the 1970s, following findings that the parasite "<a href="Giardia%20lamblia">Giardia lamblia</a>", which causes <a href="Giardiasis">Giardiasis</a>, is carried by beavers. However, further research has shown that many animals and birds carry this parasite, and the major source of water contamination is by other humans. Norway has many beavers but has not historically had giardia, and New Zealand has giardia but no beaver. Recent concerns point to domestic animals as a significant vector of giardia, with young calves in dairy herds testing as high as 100% positive for giardia. In addition, fecal coliform and streptococci bacteria excreted into streams by grazing cattle have been shown to be reduced by beaver ponds, where the bacteria are trapped in bottom sediments.

Beavers were trapped to near <a href="Local%20extinction">extirpation</a> and had not been seen in New York City since the early 1800s. After 200 years, a beaver has returned to New York City, making its home along the <a href="Bronx%20River">Bronx River</a>.

In Chicago, several beavers have returned and made a home near the <a href="Lincoln%20Park">Lincoln Park</a>'s North Pond. The "<a href="Lincoln%20Park%20beaver">Lincoln Park beaver</a>" has not been as well received by the <a href="Chicago%20Park%20District">Chicago Park District</a> and the <a href="Lincoln%20Park">Lincoln Park</a> Conservancy, which was concerned over damage to trees in the area. In March 2009, they hired an exterminator to remove a beaver family using live traps, and accidentally killed the mother when she got caught in a snare and drowned.

Outside San Francisco, in downtown <a href="Martinez%2C%20California">Martinez, California</a>, a male and female beaver arrived in <a href="Alhambra%20Creek">Alhambra Creek</a> in 2006. The <a href="Martinez%20beavers">Martinez beavers</a> built a dam 30 feet wide and at one time 6 feet high, and chewed through half the willows and other creekside landscaping the city planted as part of its $9.7 million 1999 flood-improvement project. When the city council wanted to remove the beavers because of fears of flooding, local residents organized to protect them, forming an organization called "Worth a Dam".

In the 1940s, beavers were brought from northern Manitoba in Canada to the island of <a href="Tierra%20Del%20Fuego">Tierra Del Fuego</a> in southern <a href="Chile">Chile</a> and <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, for commercial fur production. However, the project failed and the beavers, ten pairs, were released into the wild. Having no natural predators in their new environment, they quickly spread throughout the island, and to other islands in the region, reaching a number of 100,000 individuals within just 50 years. They are now considered a serious <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a> in the region, due to their massive destruction of forest trees, and efforts are being made for their eradication. The drastically different ecosystem has led to substantial environmental damage, as the ponds created by the beavers have no ecological purpose (wetlands do not form there as they do in the beavers' native territory) and there are no native, large predators. They have also been found to cross salt water to islands northward; a possible encroachment on the mainland has naturalists highly concerned.

In contrast, areas with introduced beaver were associated with increased populations of native <a href="Common%20galaxias">puye</a> fish ("Galaxias maculatus"), whereas the exotic <a href="brook%20trout">brook trout</a> ("Salvelinus fontinalis") and <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow trout</a> ("Oncorhynchus mykiss") had negative effects on native stream fishes in the <a href="Cape%20Horn%20Biosphere%20Reserve">Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve</a>, Chile.

Beavers are classed as a "prohibited new organism" under New Zealand's <a href="Hazardous%20Substances%20and%20New%20Organisms%20Act%201996">Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996</a>, preventing them from legally being imported into the country.

The basic units of beaver social organization are families consisting of an adult male and adult female in a monogamous pair and their kits and yearlings. Beaver families can have as many as ten members in addition to the monogamous pair. Groups this size or close to this size build more lodges to live in while smaller families usually need only one. However, large families in the Northern Hemisphere have been recorded living in one lodge. Beaver pairs mate for life; however, if a beaver's mate dies, it will partner with another one. Extra-pair copulations also occur. In addition to being monogamous, both the male and female take part in raising offspring. They also both mark and defend the territory and build and repair the dam and lodge. When young are born, they spend their first month in the lodge and their mother is the primary caretaker while their father maintains the territory. In the time after they leave the lodge for the first time, yearlings will help their parents build food caches in the fall and repair dams and lodges. Still, adults do the majority of the work and young beavers help their parents for reasons based on natural selection rather than kin selection. They are dependent on them for food and for learning life skills. Young beavers spend most of their time playing but also copy their parents' behavior. However, while copying behavior helps imprint life skills in young beavers, it is not necessarily immediately beneficial for parents as the young beaver do not perform the tasks as well as the parents.

Older offspring, which are around two years old, may also live in families and help their parents. In addition to helping build food caches and repairing the dam, two-year-olds will also help in feeding, grooming and guarding younger offspring. Beavers also practice <a href="Alloparenting">alloparental care</a>, in which an older sibling may take over the parenting duties if the original parents die or are otherwise separated from them. This behavior is common and is seen in many other animal species, such as the elephant and <a href="fathead%20minnow">fathead minnow</a>. While these helping two-year-olds help increase the chance of survival for younger offspring, they are not essential for the family, and two-year-olds only stay and help their families if there is a shortage of resources in times of food shortage, high population density, or drought. When beavers leave their natal territories, they usually do not settle far. Beavers can recognize their kin by detecting differences in anal gland secretion composition using their keen sense of smell. Related beavers share more features in their anal gland secretion profile than unrelated beavers. Being able to recognize kin is important for beaver social behavior, and it causes more tolerant behavior among neighboring beavers.

Beavers maintain and defend territories, which are areas for feeding, nesting and mating. They invest much energy in their territories, building their dams and becoming familiar with the area. Beavers mark their territories by constructing scent mounts made of mud, debris and castoreum, a urine based substance excreted through the beavers <a href="castor%20sac">castor sac</a>s between the pelvis and base of the tail. These scent mounts are established on the border of the territory. Once a beaver detects another scent in its territory, finding the intruder takes priority, even over food.
Because they invest so much energy in their territories, beavers are intolerant of intruders and the holder of the territory is more likely to escalate an aggressive encounter. These encounters are often violent. To avoid such situations, a beaver marks its territory with as many scent mounds as possible, signaling to intruders that the territory holder has enough energy to maintain its territory and is thus able to put up a good defense. As such, territories with more scent mounts are avoided more often than ones with fewer mounts. Scent marking increases in August during the dispersal of yearlings, in an attempt to prevent them from intruding on territories. Beavers also exhibit a behavior known as the "<a href="dear%20enemy%20effect">dear enemy effect</a>". A territory-holding beaver will investigate and become familiar with the scents of its neighbors. As such they respond less aggressively to intrusions by their territorial neighbours than those made by non-territorial floaters or "strangers".

Occurrences of beaver aggression, however, have been reported. In April 2013, an <a href="Angling">angler</a>, near Minkovichi in the <a href="Brest%2C%20Belarus">Brest region</a> of <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>, died after being bitten twice on the leg by a wild Eurasian beaver.

Both beaver <a href="testicles">testicles</a> and <a href="castoreum">castoreum</a>, a bitter-tasting secretion with a slightly fetid odor contained in the castor sacs of male or female beaver, have been articles of trade for use in traditional medicine. <a href="Yupik%20peoples">Yupik</a> medicine used dried beaver testicles like willow bark to relieve pain. Dried beaver testicles were also used as contraception. Beaver testicles were used as medicine in Iraq and Iran during the tenth to nineteenth century. <a href="Aesop">Aesop</a>'s "Fables" comically describes beavers chewing off their testicles to preserve themselves from hunters, which is not possible because the beaver's testicles are inside its body. This belief, also recorded by <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, persisted in medieval <a href="bestiary">bestiaries</a>.

European beavers ("<a href="Castor%20fiber">Castor fiber</a>") were eventually hunted nearly to extinction in part for the production of castoreum, which was used as an <a href="analgesic">analgesic</a>, <a href="anti-inflammatory">anti-inflammatory</a>, and <a href="antipyretic">antipyretic</a>. Castoreum was described in the 1911 <a href="British%20Pharmaceutical%20Codex">British Pharmaceutical Codex</a> for use in <a href="dysmenorrhea">dysmenorrhea</a> and <a href="hysteria">hysterical</a> conditions (i.e. pertaining to the womb), for raising <a href="blood%20pressure">blood pressure</a> and increasing <a href="cardiac%20output">cardiac output</a>. The activity of castoreum has been credited to the accumulation of <a href="salicin">salicin</a> from willow trees in the beaver's diet, which is transformed to <a href="salicylic%20acid">salicylic acid</a> and has an action very similar to aspirin. Castoreum continues to be used in perfume production.

Castoreum can be used as an enhancer of vanilla, strawberry and raspberry flavorings. It is sometimes added to frozen dairy, gelatins, candy, and fruit beverages. Due to the difficulty and expense in obtaining castoreum, it is only very rarely used in common food products.

Much of the early European exploration and trade of Canada was based on the quest for beaver. The most valuable part of the beaver is its inner fur whose many minute barbs make it excellent for <a href="felt">felt</a>ing, especially for hats. In Canada a 'made beaver' or "castor gras" that a <a href="Aboriginal%20peoples%20in%20Canada">native</a> had worn or slept on was more valuable than a fresh skin since this tended to wear off the outer guard hairs.

Beavers have been <a href="animal%20trapping">trapped</a> for millennia, and this continues to this day. Beaver <a href="fur">pelts</a> were used for <a href="barter%20%28economics%29">barter</a> by <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native Americans</a> in the 17th century to gain European goods. They were then shipped back to Great Britain and France where they were made into clothing items. Widespread hunting and trapping of beavers led to their <a href="endangered%20species">endangerment</a>. Eventually, the <a href="fur%20trade">fur trade</a> declined due to decreasing demand in Europe and the takeover of trapping grounds to support the growing agriculture sector. A small resurgence in beaver trapping has occurred in some areas where there is an over-population of beaver; trapping is done when the fur is of value, and the remainder of the animal may be used as feed. In the 1976/1977 season, 500,000 beaver pelts were harvested in North America. 

In wider culture, the beaver is famed for its industriousness and its building skills. The English verb "to beaver" means to work hard and constantly.

"<a href="Beverly%20%28disambiguation%29">Beverly</a>" or "Beverley", a placename found at various locations in the English-speaking world and also commonly used as a first name, derives from <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a>, combining the words "befer" ("beaver") and "leah" ("clearing").

The show "<a href="Happy%20Tree%20Friends">Happy Tree Friends</a>" features Toothy and Handy who are beavers.

The animated Nickelodeon show "<a href="The%20Angry%20Beavers">The Angry Beavers</a>" features Daggett and Norbert.

The anthropomorphic <a href="Mr.%20and%20Mrs.%20Beaver">Mr. and Mrs. Beaver</a> have an important role in the plot of "<a href="The%20Lion%2C%20the%20Witch%20and%20the%20Wardrobe">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>", first part of <a href="C.S.Lewis">C.S.Lewis</a>' "The Chronicles of Narnia".

The first "<a href="Redwall%20%28novel%29">Redwall</a>" book features an unnamed beaver who helps Constance the badger build a bow, the only one ever seen before the books shifted to focus on animals commonly native to the English Isles.

The importance of the beaver in the development of Canada through the fur trade led to its official designation as the <a href="List%20of%20national%20animals">national animal</a> in 1975. The animal has long been associated with Canada, appearing on the coat of arms of the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> in 1678. It is depicted on the <a href="Nickel%20%28Canadian%20coin%29">Canadian five-cent piece</a> and was on the first pictorial postage stamp issued in the <a href="British%20North%20America">Canadian colonies</a> in 1849 (the so-called "<a href="Postage%20stamps%20and%20postal%20history%20of%20Canada">Three-Penny Beaver</a>"). As a <a href="national%20symbol">national symbol</a>, the beaver was chosen to be the mascot of the <a href="1976%20Summer%20Olympics">1976 Summer Olympics</a> held in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> with the name "<a href="Amik">Amik</a>" ("beaver" in <a href="Ojibwe%20language">Ojibwe</a>). The beaver is also the symbol of many units and organizations within the <a href="Canadian%20Forces">Canadian Forces</a>, such as on the cap badges of the <a href="Royal%2022e%20R%C3%A9giment">Royal 22 Régiment</a>, the <a href="Calgary%20Highlanders">Calgary Highlanders</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Westminster%20Regiment">Royal Westminster Regiment</a> and the <a href="Canadian%20Military%20Engineers">Canadian Military Engineers</a>. <a href="Toronto%20Police%20Services">Toronto Police Services</a>, <a href="London%20Police%20Service">London Police Service</a>, <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway%20Police%20Service">Canadian Pacific Railway Police Service</a> and <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> bear the beaver on their crest or coat of arms.

Others who have used the beaver in their company or organizational symbol or as their mascot include:
In the 17th century, based on a question raised by the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Quebec">Bishop of Quebec</a>, the Roman Catholic Church ruled that the beaver was a fish (beaver flesh was a part of the indigenous peoples' diet, prior to the Europeans' arrival) for purposes of dietary law. Therefore, the general prohibition on the consumption of meat on Fridays did not apply to beaver meat. The legal basis for the decision probably rests with the "<a href="Summa%20Theologica">Summa Theologica</a>" of <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>, which bases animal classification as much on habit as anatomy. This is similar to the Church's classification of other semi-aquatic rodents, such as the <a href="capybara">capybara</a> and <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>.

Bear

Bears are <a href="carnivora">carnivora</a>n <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s of the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Ursidae. They are classified as <a href="caniformia">caniforms</a>, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight <a href="species">species</a> of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s throughout the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a> and partially in the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>. Bears are found on the <a href="continent">continent</a>s of <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, and <a href="Asia">Asia</a>. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, <a href="plantigrade">plantigrade</a> paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.

While the <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a> is mostly <a href="carnivore">carnivorous</a>, and the <a href="giant%20panda">giant panda</a> feeds almost entirely on <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a>, the remaining six species are <a href="omnivore">omnivorous</a> with varied diets. With the exception of <a href="courting">courting</a> individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically <a href="solitary%20animals">solitary animals</a>. They may be <a href="diurnality">diurnal</a> or <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a> and have an excellent <a href="olfaction">sense of smell</a>. Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers. Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of <a href="hibernation">hibernation</a>, up to 100 days.

Bears have been hunted since <a href="prehistoric">prehistoric</a> times for <a href="bear%20meat">their meat</a> and fur; they have been used for <a href="bear-baiting">bear-baiting</a> and other forms of entertainment, such as being <a href="tame%20bear">made to dance</a>. With their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in <a href="the%20arts">the arts</a>, <a href="mythology">mythology</a>, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian <a href="bile%20bear">bile bear</a> market. The <a href="World%20Conservation%20Union">IUCN</a> lists six bear species as <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a> or <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a>, and even <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> species, such as the <a href="brown%20bear">brown bear</a>, are at risk of <a href="Local%20extinction">extirpation</a> in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.

The English word "bear" comes from <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> ' and belongs to a family of names for the bear in <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic languages</a>, such as Swedish ', also used as a first name, that originate from an adjective meaning "brown".

Bear taxon names such as <a href="Arctoidea">Arctoidea</a> and "<a href="Helarctos">Helarctos</a>" come from the ancient Greek word ἄρκτος ("arktos"), meaning bear, as do the names "<a href="arctic">arctic</a>" and "<a href="antarctic">antarctic</a>", from the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> <a href="Ursa%20Major">Ursa Major</a>, the "Great Bear", prominent in the northern sky.

Bear taxon names such as Ursidae and "Ursus" come from Latin "Ursus/Ursa", he-bear/she-bear. The female first name "Ursula", originally derived from a Christian <a href="St.%20Ursula">saint</a>'s name, means "little she-bear" (diminutive of Latin "ursa"). In Switzerland, the male first name "Urs" is especially popular, while the name of the canton and city of <a href="Bern">Bern</a> is derived from "Bär", <a href="German%20language">German</a> for bear. The Germanic name <a href="Bernard">Bernard</a> (including Bernhardt and similar forms) means "bear-brave", "bear-hardy", or "bold bear". The Old English name <a href="Beowulf">Beowulf</a> is a <a href="kenning">kenning</a>, "bee-wolf", for bear, in turn meaning a brave warrior.

The family Ursidae is one of nine families in the suborder <a href="Caniformia">Caniformia</a>, or "doglike" carnivorans, within the <a href="Order%20%28biology%29">order</a> <a href="Carnivora">Carnivora</a>. Bears' closest living relatives are the <a href="pinniped">pinniped</a>s, <a href="Canidae">canids</a>, and <a href="musteloidea">musteloid</a>s. Modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies: <a href="Ailuropodinae">Ailuropodinae</a> (monotypic with the <a href="giant%20panda">giant panda</a>), <a href="Tremarctinae">Tremarctinae</a> (monotypic with the <a href="spectacled%20bear">spectacled bear</a>), and <a href="Ursinae">Ursinae</a> (containing six species divided into one to three genera, depending on the authority). Nuclear chromosome analysis show that the <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a> of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, with each having 74 <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s, whereas the giant panda has 42 chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52. These smaller numbers can be explained by the fusing of some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but differ from those of procyonids, which supports the inclusion of these two species in Ursidae rather than in <a href="Procyonidae">Procyonidae</a>, where they had been placed by some earlier authorities.

The earliest members of Ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily Amphicynodontinae, including "<a href="Parictis">Parictis</a>" (late <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> to early middle <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>, 38–18 <a href="Mya%20%28unit%29">Mya</a>) and the slightly younger "Allocyon" (early <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a>, 34–30 Mya), both from North America. These animals looked very different from today's bears, being small and raccoon-like in overall appearance, and diets perhaps more similar to that of a badger. "Parictis" does not appear in Eurasia and Africa until the Miocene. It is unclear whether late-Eocene ursids were also present in Eurasia, although faunal exchange across the <a href="Bering%20land%20bridge">Bering land bridge</a> may have been possible during a major sea level low stand as early as the late Eocene (about 37 Mya) and continuing into the early Oligocene. European genera morphologically are very similar to "Allocyon", and to the much younger American "<a href="Kolponomos">Kolponomos</a>" (about 18 Mya), are known from the Oligocene, including "Amphicticeps" and "<a href="Amphicynodon">Amphicynodon</a>".

The raccoon-sized, dog-like "<a href="Cephalogale">Cephalogale</a>" is the oldest-known member of the subfamily <a href="Hemicyoninae">Hemicyoninae</a>, which first appeared during the middle Oligocene in Eurasia about 30 Mya. The subfamily includes the younger genera "<a href="Phoberocyon">Phoberocyon</a>" (20–15 Mya), and "<a href="Plithocyon">Plithocyon</a>" (15–7 Mya). A "Cephalogale"-like species gave rise to the genus "<a href="Ursavus">Ursavus</a>" during the early Oligocene (30–28 Mya); this genus proliferated into many species in Asia and is ancestral to all living bears. Species of "Ursavus" subsequently entered North America, together with "Amphicynodon" and "Cephalogale", during the early Miocene (21–18 Mya). Members of the living lineages of bears diverged from "Ursavus" between 15 and 20 Mya, likely via the species "Ursavus elmensis". Based on genetic and morphological data, the Ailuropodinae (pandas) were the first to diverge from other living bears about 19 Mya, although no fossils of this group have been found before about 5 Mya.

The New World short-faced bears (Tremarctinae) differentiated from Ursinae following a dispersal event into North America during the mid-Miocene (about 13 Mya). They <a href="Great%20American%20Interchange">invaded South America</a> (≈1 Ma) following formation of the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Panama">Isthmus of Panama</a>. Their earliest fossil representative is "<a href="Plionarctos">Plionarctos</a>" in North America (~ 10–2 Ma). This genus is probably the direct ancestor to the <a href="Short-faced%20bear">North American short-faced bears</a> (genus "Arctodus"), the <a href="Arctotherium">South American short-faced bears</a> ("Arctotherium"), and the spectacled bears, "Tremarctos", represented by both an extinct North American species ("<a href="Tremarctos%20floridanus">T. floridanus</a>"), and the lone surviving representative of the Tremarctinae, the South American spectacled bear ("T. ornatus").
The subfamily Ursinae experienced a dramatic proliferation of taxa about 5.3–4.5 Mya, coincident with major environmental changes; the first members of the genus "<a href="Ursus%20%28genus%29">Ursus</a>" appeared around this time. The <a href="sloth%20bear">sloth bear</a> is a modern survivor of one of the earliest lineages to diverge during this radiation event (5.3 Mya); it took on its peculiar morphology, related to its diet of termites and ants, no later than by the early Pleistocene. By 3–4 Mya, the species "Ursus minimus" appears in the fossil record of Europe; apart from its size, it was nearly identical to today's <a href="Asian%20black%20bear">Asian black bear</a>. It is likely ancestral to all bears within Ursinae, perhaps aside from the sloth bear. Two lineages evolved from "U. minimus": the black bears (including the <a href="sun%20bear">sun bear</a>, the Asian black bear, and the <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a>); and the brown bears (which includes the <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a>). Modern <a href="brown%20bear">brown bear</a>s evolved from "U. minimus" via "<a href="Ursus%20etruscus">Ursus etruscus</a>", which itself is ancestral to the extinct <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> <a href="cave%20bear">cave bear</a>. Species of Ursinae have migrated repeatedly into North America from Eurasia as early as 4 Mya during the early Pliocene. The polar bear is the most recently evolved species and descended from the brown bear around 400,000 years ago.

The bears form a <a href="clade">clade</a> within the Carnivora. The <a href="red%20panda">red panda</a> is not a bear but a musteloid. 
The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> is based on <a href="molecular%20phylogeny">molecular phylogeny</a> of six genes in Flynn, 2005.

The <a href="Phylogenetic%20tree">phylogeny</a> of extant bear species is shown in a cladogram based on complete <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> sequences from Yu et al., 2007. The giant panda, followed by the spectacled bear are clearly the oldest species. The relationships of the other species are not very well resolved, though the polar bear and the brown bear form a close grouping.

Extant species are shown in bold, extinct taxa are marked †.


Bears include the most massive extant terrestrial members of the order Carnivora. Polar bears weigh up to . The smallest are the sun bears of Asia, which weigh up to .
Body weight varies throughout the year in bears of temperate and arctic climates, as they build up fat reserves in the summer and autumn and lose weight during the winter. Head-and-body length can range from in sun bears to in polar bears.

Bears are generally bulky and robust animals with short tails. They are <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a> with regard to size, with males typically being larger. Larger species tend to show increased levels of sexual dimorphism in comparison to smaller species. Relying as they do on strength rather than speed, bears have relatively short limbs with thick bones to support their bulk. The <a href="Scapula">shoulder blades</a> and the <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a> are correspondingly massive. The limbs are much straighter than those of the big cats as there is no need for them to flex in the same way due to the differences in their gait. The strong forelimbs are used to catch prey, to excavate dens, to dig out burrowing animals, to turn over rocks and logs to locate prey, and to club large creatures.
Unlike most other land carnivorans, bears are <a href="plantigrade">plantigrade</a>. They distribute their weight toward the hind feet, which makes them look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, and as a result mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a> shoots as the animals feed.

Most mammals have <a href="Agouti%20%28coloration%29">agouti</a> hair, with each individual hair shaft having bands of colour corresponding to two different types of <a href="melanin">melanin</a> pigment. Bears however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single colour throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. The coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-coloured skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the soles of their feet have a dense pad of fur. Other than the bold black-and-white pelage of the panda, bears tend to be uniform in colour, although some species may have markings on the chest or face.

Bears have small rounded ears so as to minimise heat loss, but neither their hearing or sight are particularly acute. Unlike many other carnivorans they have <a href="colour%20vision">colour vision</a>, perhaps to help them distinguish ripe nuts and fruits. They are unique among carnivorans in not having touch-sensitive <a href="whiskers">whiskers</a> on the muzzle; however, they have an excellent <a href="olfaction">sense of smell</a>, better than that of the <a href="dog">dog</a>, or possibly any other mammal. They use smell for signalling to each other (either to warn off rivals or detect mates) and for finding food. Smell is the principal sense used by bears to locate most of their food, and they have excellent memories which helps them to relocate places where they have found food before.

The <a href="skull">skull</a>s of bears are massive, providing anchorage for the powerful <a href="Masseter%20muscle">masseter</a> and <a href="temporal%20muscle">temporal</a> jaw muscles. The <a href="canine%20tooth">canine teeth</a> are large but mostly used for display, and the <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a> teeth flat and crushing. Unlike most other members of the Carnivora, bears have relatively undeveloped <a href="carnassial">carnassial</a> teeth, and their teeth are adapted for a diet that includes a significant amount of vegetable matter. Considerable variation occurs in <a href="dentition">dental formula</a> even within a given species. This may indicate bears are still in the process of evolving from a mainly meat-eating diet to a predominantly herbivorous one. Polar bears appear to have secondarily re-evolved carnassial-like cheek teeth, as their diets have switched back towards carnivory. Sloth bears lack lower central incisors and use their protusible lips for sucking up the termites on which they feed. The general dental formula for living bears is:
. The structure of the <a href="larynx">larynx</a> of bears appears to be the most <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> of the caniforms. They possess air pouches connected to the <a href="pharynx">pharynx</a> which may <a href="vocal%20resonance">amplify</a> their vocalisations.

Bears have a fairly simple digestive system typical for carnivorans, with a single stomach, short undifferentiated intestines and no <a href="cecum">cecum</a>. Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a> is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must spend much of their time feeding in order to gain enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.

Extant bears are found in sixty countries primarily in the Northern Hemisphere and are concentrated in Asia, North America, and Europe. An exception is the spectacled bear; native to South America, it inhabits the <a href="Andes">Andean region</a>. The sun bear's range extends below the equator in Southeast Asia. The <a href="Atlas%20bear">Atlas bear</a>, a subspecies of the brown bear was distributed in North Africa from Morocco to Libya, but it became extinct around the 1870s.

The most widespread species is the brown bear, which occurs from Western Europe eastwards through Asia to the western areas of North America. The American black bear is restricted to North America, and the polar bear is restricted to the Arctic Sea. All the remaining species of bear are Asian. They occur in a range of habitats which include tropical lowland rainforest, both coniferous and broadleaf forests, prairies, steppes, montane grassland, alpine scree slopes, Arctic tundra and in the case of the polar bear, <a href="Drift%20ice">ice floes</a>. Bears may dig their dens in hillsides or use caves, hollow logs and dense vegetation for shelter.

Brown and American black bears are generally <a href="diurnality">diurnal</a>, meaning that they are active for the most part during the day, though they may forage substantially by night. Other species may be <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a>, active at night, though female sloth bears with cubs may feed more at daytime to avoid competition from conspecifics and nocturnal predators. Bears are overwhelmingly solitary and are considered to be the most asocial of all the Carnivora. The only times bears are encountered in small groups are mothers with young or occasional seasonal bounties of rich food (such as salmon runs). Fights between males can occur and older individuals may have extensive <a href="scar">scar</a>ring, which suggests that maintaining <a href="Dominance%20%28ethology%29">dominance</a> can be intense. With their acute sense of smell, bears can locate carcasses from several kilometres away. They use <a href="olfaction">olfaction</a> to locate other foods, encounter mates, avoid rivals and recognise their cubs. 

Most bears are opportunistic <a href="omnivore">omnivore</a>s and consume more plant than animal matter. They eat anything from leaves, roots, and <a href="berries">berries</a> to <a href="insect">insect</a>s, <a href="carrion">carrion</a>, fresh meat, and fish, and have digestive systems and teeth adapted to such a diet. At the extremes are the almost entirely herbivorous giant panda and the mostly carnivorous polar bear. However, all bears feed on any food source that becomes seasonally available. For example, Asiatic black bears in <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> consume large numbers of <a href="acorn">acorn</a>s when these are most common, and switch to <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a>s at other times of the year.

When foraging for plants, bears choose to eat them at the stage when they are at their most nutritious and digestible, typically avoiding older <a href="grass">grass</a>es, <a href="sedge">sedge</a>s and leaves. Hence, in more northern temperate areas, browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted. Knowing when plants are ripe for eating is a learned behaviour. Berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees, and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage. In autumn, some bear species forage large amounts of naturally <a href="fermentation">fermented</a> fruits, which affects their behaviour. Smaller bears climb trees to obtain <a href="mast%20%28botany%29">mast</a> (edible reproductive parts, such as acorns). Such masts can be very important to the diets of these species, and mast failures may result in long-range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources. Brown bears, with their powerful digging abilities, commonly eat roots. The panda's diet is over 99% bamboo, of 30 different species. Its strong jaws are adapted for crushing the tough stems of these plants, though they prefer to eat the more nutritious leaves. <a href="Bromeliad">Bromeliad</a>s can make up to 50% of the diet of the spectacled bear, which also has strong jaws to bite them open.

The sloth bear, though not as specialised as polar bears and the panda, has lost several front teeth usually seen in bears, and developed a long, suctioning tongue to feed on the <a href="ant">ant</a>s, <a href="termite">termite</a>s, and other burrowing insects they favour. At certain times of the year, these insects can make up 90% of their diets. Some species may raid the nests of <a href="wasp">wasp</a>s and <a href="bee">bee</a>s for the <a href="honey">honey</a> and immature insects, in spite of stinging from the adults. Sun bears use their long tongues to lick up both insects and honey. Fish are an important source of food for some species, and brown bears in particular gather in large numbers at <a href="salmon%20run">salmon run</a>s. Typically, a bear plunges into the water and seizes a fish with its jaws or front paws. The preferred parts to eat are the brain and eggs. Small burrowing mammals like <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s may be dug out and eaten.

The brown bear and both species of black bears sometimes take large ungulates, such as <a href="deer">deer</a> and <a href="bovid">bovid</a>s, mostly the young and weak. These animals may be taken by a short rush and ambush, though hiding young may be stiffed out and pounced on. The polar bear mainly preys on seals, stalking them from the ice or breaking into their dens. They primarily eat the highly digestible blubber. Large mammalian prey is typically killed by a bite to the head or neck, or (in the case of young) simply pinned down and mauled. Predatory behaviour in bears is typically taught to the young by the mother.

Bears are prolific <a href="scavenger">scavenger</a>s and <a href="kleptoparasite">kleptoparasite</a>s, stealing food <a href="Hoarding%20%28animal%20behavior%29">caches</a> from rodents, and carcasses from other predators. For hibernating species, weight gain is important as it provides nourishment during winter dormancy. A brown bear can eat of food and gain of fat a day prior to entering its den.

Bears produce a number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, grunting or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.

Bears sometimes communicate with visual displays such as <a href="bipedalism">standing upright</a>, which exaggerates the individual's size. The chest markings of some species may add to this intimidating display. Staring is an aggressive act and the facial markings of spectacled bears and giant pandas may help draw attention to the eyes during <a href="Agonistic%20behavior">agonistic</a> encounters. Individuals may approach each other by stiff-legged walking with the head lowered. Dominance between bears is asserted by making a frontal orientation, showing the <a href="canine%20teeth">canine teeth</a>, muzzle twisting and neck stretching. A subordinate may respond with a lateral orientation, by turning away and dropping the head and by sitting or lying down. 

Bears may mark territory by rubbing against trees and other objects which may serve to spread their scent. This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object. Bark may be spread around to draw attention to the marking post. Pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands. Polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.

The mating system of bears has variously been described as a form of <a href="Polygyny%20in%20animals">polygyny</a>, <a href="promiscuity">promiscuity</a> and <a href="serial%20monogamy">serial monogamy</a>. During the breeding season, males take notice of females in their vicinity and females become more tolerant of males. A male bear may visit a female continuously over a period of several days or weeks, depending on the species, to test her reproductive state. During this time period, males try to prevent rivals from interacting with their mate. Courtship may be brief, although in some Asian species, courting pairs may engage in wrestling, hugging, mock fighting and vocalising. <a href="Induced%20ovulation%20%28animals%29">Ovulation is induced by mating</a>, which can last up to 30 minutes depending on the species.

<a href="Gestation">Gestation</a> typically lasts 6–9 months, including <a href="delayed%20implantation">delayed implantation</a>, and litter size numbers up to four cubs. Giant pandas may give birth to twins but they can only suckle one young and the other is left to die. In northern living species, birth takes place during winter dormancy. Cubs are born blind and helpless with at most a thin layer of hair, relying on their mother for warmth. The milk of the female bear is rich in fat and antibodies and cubs may suckle for up to a year after they are born. By 2–3 months, cubs can follow their mother outside the den. They usually follow her on foot, but sloth bear cubs may ride on their mother's back. Male bears play no role in raising young. <a href="Infanticide%20%28zoology%29">Infanticide</a>, where an adult male kills the cubs of another, has been recorded in polar bears, brown bears and American black bears but not in other species. Males kill young to bring the female into <a href="oestrus">oestrus</a>. Cubs may flee and the mother defends them even at the cost of her life. 

In some species, offspring may become independent around the next spring, through some may stay until the female successfully mates again. Bears reach <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> shortly after they disperse; at around 3–6 years depending on the species. Male Alaskan brown bears and polar bears may continue to grow until they are 11 years old. Lifespan may also vary between species. The brown bear can live an average of 25 years.

Bears of northern regions, including the <a href="American%20black%20bear%23Hibernation">American black bear</a> and the <a href="Grizzly%20bear%23Hibernation">grizzly bear</a>, hibernate in the winter. During hibernation, the bear's metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. Bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. A <a href="fecal%20plug">fecal plug</a> is formed in the colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. If they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste <a href="urea">urea</a>. Female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.

As animals at the summit of the food chain, bears do not have many predators. The most important are humans, and as they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came in conflict with the bears that raided them. Since the invention of firearms, people have been able to kill bears with greater ease. The <a href="tiger">tiger</a> is the only four-legged predator that regularly preys on adult bears, including brown bears, sloth bears, Asiatic black bears, and sun bears.

Bears are parasitized by eighty species of parasites, including single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan "<a href="Sarcocystis">Sarcocystis</a>", the parasitic worm "<a href="Diphyllobothrium%20mansonoides">Diphyllobothrium mansonoides</a>", and the nematodes "<a href="Dirofilaria%20immitis">Dirofilaria immitis</a>", "<a href="Capillaria%20aerophila">Capillaria aerophila</a>", "<a href="Physaloptera">Physaloptera</a>" sp., "<a href="Strongyloides">Strongyloides</a>" sp. and others. Of these, "D. mansonoides" and adult "C. aerophila" were causing pathological symptoms. By contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style is such that few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan "<a href="Toxoplasma%20gondii">Toxoplasma gondii</a>" has been found in polar bears, and the nematode "<a href="Trichinella%20nativa">Trichinella nativa</a>" can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears. Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a "<a href="Morbillivirus">Morbillivirus</a>" similar to the <a href="Canine%20distemper">canine distemper virus</a>. They are susceptible to <a href="infectious%20canine%20hepatitis">infectious canine hepatitis</a> (CAV-1), with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.

In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the <a href="Asia">Asia</a>n <a href="bile%20bear">bile bear</a> market, though hunting is now banned, largely replaced by farming. The <a href="World%20Conservation%20Union">IUCN</a> lists six bear species as <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>; even the two <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> species, the brown bear and the American black bear, are at risk of <a href="Local%20extinction">extirpation</a> in certain areas. In general these two species inhabit remote areas with little interaction with humans, and the main non-natural causes of mortality are hunting, trapping, road-kill and depredation.

Laws have been passed in many areas of the world <a href="bear%20conservation">to protect bears</a> from <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a>. Public perception of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance. Support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies. Where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans. In poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.

Several bear species are <a href="bear%20danger">dangerous to humans</a>, especially in areas where they have become used to people; elsewhere, they generally avoid humans. <a href="Bear%20attack">Injuries caused by bears</a> are rare, but are widely reported. Bears may attack humans in response to being startled, in defense of young or food, or even for predatory reasons.

Bears in captivity have for centuries been used for entertainment. They have been trained to <a href="dancing%20bear">dance</a>, and were kept for <a href="Bear-baiting">baiting</a> in Europe at least since the 16th century. There were five bear-baiting gardens in <a href="Southwark">Southwark</a>, London at that time; archaeological remains of three of these have survived. Across Europe, <a href="nomad">nomad</a>ic <a href="Romani%20people">Romani</a> bear handlers called <a href="Ursari">Ursari</a> lived by busking with their bears from the 12th century.
<a href="Bear%20hunting">Bears have been hunted</a> for sport, food, and <a href="folk%20medicine">folk medicine</a>. Their meat is dark and stringy, like a tough cut of beef. In <a href="Cantonese%20cuisine">Cantonese cuisine</a>, bear paws are considered a delicacy. Bear meat should be cooked thoroughly, as it can be infected with the parasite "<a href="Trichinella%20spiralis">Trichinella spiralis</a>".

The peoples of eastern Asia use bears' body parts and secretions (notably their gallbladders and bile) as part of <a href="traditional%20Chinese%20medicine">traditional Chinese medicine</a>. More than 12,000 bears are thought to be kept on farms in China, Vietnam, and South Korea for the production of bile. Trade in bear products is prohibited under <a href="CITES">CITES</a>, but bear bile has been detected in shampoos, wine and herbal medicines sold in Canada, the United States and Australia.

There is evidence of prehistoric <a href="bear%20worship">bear worship</a>, though this is disputed by archaeologists. The prehistoric <a href="Finns">Finns</a>, <a href="Siberian%20peoples">Siberian peoples</a> and more recently <a href="Korean%20mythology">Koreans</a> considered the bear as the spirit of their forefathers. There is evidence of bear worship in early Chinese and <a href="Ainu%20religion">Ainu culture</a>s. In many <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> cultures, the bear is a symbol of rebirth because of its hibernation and re-emergence. The image of the mother bear was prevalent throughout societies in North America and Eurasia, based on the female's devotion and protection of her cubs. <a href="Japanese%20folklore">Japanese folklore</a> features the <a href="Onikuma">Onikuma</a>, a "demon bear" that walks upright. The <a href="Ainu%20people">Ainu</a> of northern Japan, a different people from the Japanese, saw the bear instead as sacred; Hirasawa Byozan painted a scene in documentary style of a bear sacrifice in an Ainu temple, complete with offerings to the dead animal's spirit.

In <a href="Korea">Korea</a>n mythology, a tiger and a bear prayed to <a href="Hwanung">Hwanung</a>, the son of the Lord of Heaven, that they might become human. Upon hearing their prayers, Hwanung gave them 20 cloves of garlic and a bundle of <a href="mugwort">mugwort</a>, ordering them to eat only this sacred food and remain out of the sunlight for 100 days. The tiger gave up after about twenty days and left the cave. However, the bear persevered and was transformed into a woman. The bear and the tiger are said to represent two tribes that sought the favor of the heavenly prince.
The bear-woman (<a href="Ungnyeo">Ungnyeo</a>; 웅녀/) was grateful and made offerings to Hwanung. However, she lacked a husband, and soon became sad and prayed beneath a "divine <a href="birch">birch</a>" tree () to be blessed with a child. Hwanung, moved by her prayers, took her for his wife and soon she gave birth to a son named <a href="Dangun%20Wanggeom">Dangun Wanggeom</a> - who was the legendary founder of <a href="Gojoseon">Gojoseon</a>, the first ever <a href="Korea">Korea</a>n kingdom.
<a href="Artio">Artio</a> ("Dea Artio" in the <a href="Gallo-Roman%20religion">Gallo-Roman religion</a>) was a <a href="Celts">Celtic</a> bear goddess. Evidence of her worship has notably been found at <a href="Bern">Bern</a>, itself named for the bear. Her name is derived from the Celtic word for "bear", "artos". In ancient Greece, archaic cult of <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> in bear form survived into Classical times at <a href="Brauron">Brauron</a>, where young Athenian girls passed an initiation right as "arktai" "she bears". For Artemis and one of her <a href="nymph">nymph</a>s as a she-bear, see the myth of <a href="Callisto%20%28mythology%29">Callisto</a>.

The constellations of Ursa Major and <a href="Ursa%20Minor">Ursa Minor</a>, the great and little bears, are named for their supposed resemblance to bears, from the time of <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>. The nearby star <a href="Arcturus">Arcturus</a> means "guardian of the bear", as if it were watching the two constellations. Ursa Major has been associated with a bear for as much as 13,000 years since <a href="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> times, in the widespread <a href="Cosmic%20Hunt">Cosmic Hunt</a> myths. These are found on both sides of the <a href="Beringia">Bering land bridge</a>, which was lost to the sea some 11,000 years ago.

<a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>'s "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Natural History</a>" (1st century AD) claims that "when first born, [bears] are shapeless masses of white flesh, a little larger than mice; their claws alone being prominent. The mother then licks them gradually into proper shape." This belief was echoed by authors of <a href="bestiary">bestiaries</a> throughout the medieval period.

Bears are mentioned in the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>; the <a href="Second%20Book%20of%20Kings">Second Book of Kings</a> relates the story of the prophet <a href="Elisha">Elisha</a> calling on them to eat the youths who taunted him. Legends of <a href="saint">saint</a>s taming bears are common in the Alpine zone. In the arms of the bishopric of <a href="Freising">Freising</a>, the bear is the dangerous totem animal tamed by St. <a href="Corbinian">Corbinian</a> and made to carry his civilised baggage over the mountains. Bears similarly feature in the legends of St. <a href="Romedius">Romedius</a>, <a href="Saint%20Gall">Saint Gall</a> and <a href="Saint%20Columbanus">Saint Columbanus</a>. This recurrent motif was used by the Church as a symbol of the victory of Christianity over paganism. In the Norse settlements of northern England during the 10th century, a type of "hogback" grave cover of a long narrow block of stone, with a shaped apex like the roof beam of a long house, is carved with a muzzled, thus Christianised, bear clasping each gable end, as in the church at <a href="Brompton%2C%20Hambleton">Brompton, North Yorkshire</a> and across the British Isles.
<a href="L%C4%81%C4%8Dpl%C4%93sis">Lāčplēsis</a>, meaning "Bear-slayer", is a <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a>n legendary hero who is said to have killed a bear by ripping its jaws apart with his bare hands. However, as revealed in the end of the long epic describing his life, Lāčplēsis' own mother had been a she-bear, and his superhuman strength resided in his bear ears. The modern Latvian military award <a href="Order%20of%20L%C4%81%C4%8Dpl%C4%93sis">Order of Lāčplēsis</a>, called for the hero, is also known as "The Order of the Bear-Slayer". 

Bears are popular in children's stories, including <a href="Winnie%20the%20Pooh">Winnie the Pooh</a>, <a href="Paddington%20Bear">Paddington Bear</a>, <a href="Gentle%20Ben">Gentle Ben</a> and "<a href="The%20Brown%20Bear%20of%20Norway">The Brown Bear of Norway</a>". An early version of "<a href="Goldilocks%20and%20the%20Three%20Bears">Goldilocks and the Three Bears</a>", was published as "The Three Bears" in 1837 by <a href="Robert%20Southey">Robert Southey</a>, many times retold, and illustrated in 1918 by <a href="Arthur%20Rackham">Arthur Rackham</a>.
The <a href="cartoon">cartoon</a> character <a href="Yogi%20Bear">Yogi Bear</a> has appeared in numerous comic books, <a href="cartoon%20series">animated television show</a>s and films. The <a href="Care%20Bears">Care Bears</a> began as greeting cards in 1982, and were featured as toys, on clothing and in film. Around the world, many children—and some adults—have <a href="teddy%20bear">teddy bear</a>s, <a href="stuffed%20toy">stuffed toy</a>s in the form of bears, named after the American statesman <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> when in 1902 he had refused to shoot an American black bear tied to a tree.
Bears, like other animals, may symbolize nations. In 1911, the British satirical magazine <a href="Punch%20magazine">"Punch"</a> published a cartoon about the <a href="Anglo-Russian%20Entente">Anglo-Russian Entente</a> by <a href="Leonard%20Raven-Hill">Leonard Raven-Hill</a> in which the British lion watches as the Russian bear sits on the tail of the Persian cat. The <a href="Russian%20Bear">Russian Bear</a> has been a common <a href="national%20personification">national personification</a> for Russia from the 16th century onwards. <a href="Smokey%20Bear">Smokey Bear</a> has become a part of American culture since his introduction in 1944, with his message "Only you can prevent forest fires".

Bald eagle

The bald eagle ("Haliaeetus leucocephalus", from Greek "hali" "sea", "aiētos" "<a href="eagle">eagle</a>", "leuco" "white", "cephalos" "head") is a <a href="bird%20of%20prey">bird of prey</a> found in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. A <a href="sea%20eagle">sea eagle</a>, it has two known subspecies and forms a <a href="Species%20complex">species pair</a> with the <a href="white-tailed%20eagle">white-tailed eagle</a> ("Haliaeetus albicilla"). Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous United States</a>, and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.

The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on <a href="fish">fish</a>, which it swoops down and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest <a href="bird%20nest">nest</a> of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to deep, wide, and in weight. <a href="Sexual%20maturity">Sexual maturity</a> is attained at the age of four to five years.

Bald eagles are not actually <a href="bald">bald</a>; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, "white headed". The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, but females are about 25 percent larger than males. The <a href="beak">beak</a> is large and hooked. The plumage of the immature is brown.

The bald eagle is both the <a href="List%20of%20national%20birds">national bird</a> and <a href="List%20of%20national%20animals">national animal</a> of the <a href="United%20States">United States of America</a>. The bald eagle appears on its <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20the%20United%20States">seal</a>. In the late 20th century it was on the brink of <a href="local%20extinction">extirpation</a> in the contiguous United States. Populations have since recovered and the species was removed from the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. government</a>'s list of <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> on July 12, 1995 and transferred to the list of <a href="threatened%20species">threatened species</a>. It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the <a href="Continental%20United%20States">Lower 48</a> States on June 28, 2007.

The <a href="plumage">plumage</a> of an adult bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> is evident in the species, in that females are 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a> are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The <a href="beak">beak</a> is large and hooked, with a yellow <a href="cere">cere</a>. The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related <a href="African%20fish%20eagle">African fish eagle</a> ("H. vocifer") (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body, white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.

The plumage of the immature is a dark brown overlaid with messy white streaking until the fifth (rarely fourth, very rarely third) year, when it reaches sexual maturity. Immature bald eagles are distinguishable from the <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a> ("Aquila chrysaetos"), the only other very large, non-vulturine bird in North America, in that the former has a larger, more protruding head with a larger <a href="beak">beak</a>, straighter edged wings which are held flat (not slightly raised) and with a stiffer wing beat and feathers which do not completely cover the legs. When seen well, the golden eagle is distinctive in plumage with a more solid warm brown color than an immature bald eagle, with a reddish-golden patch to its <a href="nape">nape</a> and (in immature birds) a highly contrasting set of white squares on the wing. Another distinguishing feature of the immature bald eagle over the mature bird is its black, yellow-tipped beak; the mature eagle has a fully yellow beak.

The bald eagle has sometimes been considered the largest true raptor (<a href="Accipitriformes">accipitrid</a>) in North America. The only larger species of raptor-like bird is the <a href="California%20condor">California condor</a> ("Gymnogyps californianus"), a <a href="New%20World%20vulture">New World vulture</a> which today is not generally considered a taxonomic ally of true accipitrids. However, the <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>, averaging and in <a href="Wing%20chord%20%28biology%29">wing chord length</a> in its American race ("A. c. canadensis"), is merely lighter in mean body mass and exceeds the bald eagle in mean wing chord length by around . Additionally, the bald eagle's close cousins, the relatively longer-winged but shorter-tailed <a href="white-tailed%20eagle">white-tailed eagle</a> and the overall larger <a href="Steller%27s%20sea%20eagle">Steller's sea eagle</a> ("H. pelagicus"), may, rarely, wander to coastal Alaska from Asia.
The bald eagle has a body length of . Typical wingspan is between and mass is normally between . Females are about 25% larger than males, averaging , and against the males' average weight of . The size of the bird varies by location and generally corresponds with <a href="Bergmann%27s%20rule">Bergmann's rule</a>, since the species increases in size further away from the Equator and the tropics. For example, eagles from <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> average in mass and in wingspan, smaller than their northern counterparts. The largest eagles are from <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, where large females may weigh up to and span across the wings. A survey of adult weights in Alaska showed that females weighed on average and males weighed . Among standard linear measurements, the <a href="Wing%20chord%20%28biology%29">wing chord</a> is , the <a href="tail">tail</a> is long, and the <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> is . The <a href="Culmen%20%28bird%29">culmen</a> reportedly ranges from , while the measurement from the <a href="gape">gape</a> to the tip of the bill is .

The call consists of weak staccato, chirping whistles, "kleek kik ik ik ik", somewhat similar in cadence to a <a href="gull">gull</a>'s call. The calls of young birds tend to be more harsh and shrill than those of adults.

The bald eagle placed in the genus "Haliaeetus" (<a href="sea%20eagle">sea eagle</a>s) which gets both its common and specific scientific names from the distinctive appearance of the adult's head. "Bald" in the <a href="English%20language">English</a> name is derived from the word "<a href="piebald">piebald</a>", and refers to the white head and tail feathers and their contrast with the darker body. The scientific name is derived from "Haliaeetus", <a href="New%20Latin">New Latin</a> for "sea eagle" (from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "haliaetos"), and "leucocephalus", Latinized Ancient Greek for "white head," from λευκος "leukos" ("white") and κεφαλη "kephale" ("head").

The bald eagle was one of the many species originally described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his 18th century work "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>", under the name "Falco leucocephalus".

There are two recognized <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of bald eagle:

The bald eagle forms a <a href="species%20pair">species pair</a> with the <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>n white-tailed eagle. This species pair consists of a white-headed and a tan-headed species of roughly equal size; the white-tailed eagle also has overall somewhat paler brown body plumage. The two species fill the same <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a> in their respective ranges. The pair diverged from other sea eagles at the beginning of the Early <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> (c. 10 <a href="Ma%20%28unit%29">Ma BP</a>) at the latest, but possibly as early as the Early/Middle <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a>, 28 Ma BP, if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to this <a href="genus">genus</a>.

The bald eagle's natural range covers most of North America, including most of <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, all of the <a href="continental%20United%20States">continental United States</a>, and northern <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. It is the only sea eagle <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to North America. Occupying varied habitats from the <a href="bayou">bayou</a>s of <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> to the <a href="Sonoran%20Desert">Sonoran Desert</a> and the eastern deciduous forests of <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> and <a href="New%20England">New England</a>, northern birds are <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>, northern and eastern Canada, and <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. Today, they are much more common (almost attaining their peak numbers pre-colonization in North America), and nest in every continental state and province in the United States and Canada.

Bald eagles will also congregate in certain locations in winter. From November until February, one to two thousand birds winter in <a href="Squamish%2C%20British%20Columbia">Squamish, British Columbia</a>, about halfway between <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> and <a href="Whistler%2C%20British%20Columbia">Whistler</a>. The birds primarily gather along the <a href="Squamish%20River">Squamish</a> and <a href="Cheakamus%20River">Cheakamus</a> Rivers, attracted by the <a href="salmon">salmon</a> spawning in the area.

It has occurred as a <a href="vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> twice in Ireland; a juvenile was shot illegally in <a href="Fermanagh">Fermanagh</a> on January 11, 1973 (misidentified at first as a white-tailed eagle), and an exhausted juvenile was captured in <a href="County%20Kerry">Kerry</a> on November 15, 1987.

The bald eagle occurs during its breeding season in virtually any kind of American <a href="wetland">wetland</a> habitat such as <a href="Coast">seacoasts</a>, <a href="river">river</a>s, large <a href="lake">lake</a>s or <a href="marsh">marsh</a>es or other large bodies of open water with an abundance of fish. Studies have shown a preference for bodies of water with a circumference greater than , and lakes with an area greater than are optimal for breeding bald eagles.

The bald eagle typically requires old-growth and mature stands of <a href="pinophyta">coniferous</a> or <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a> trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Tree species reportedly is less important to the eagle pair than the tree's height, composition and location. Perhaps of paramount importance for this species is an abundance of comparatively large trees surrounding the body of water. Selected trees must have good visibility, be over tall, an open structure, and proximity to prey. If nesting trees are in standing water such as in a mangrove swamp, the nest can be located fairly low, at as low above the ground. In a more typical tree standing on dry ground, nests may be located from in height. In <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>, nesting trees averaged in diameter and in total height, while in Florida, the average nesting tree stands high and is in diameter. Trees used for nesting in the <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Greater Yellowstone area</a> average high. Trees or forest used for nesting should have a canopy cover of no more than 60%, and no less than 20%, and be in close proximity to water. Most nests have been found within of open water. The greatest distance from open water recorded for a bald eagle nest was over , in <a href="Florida">Florida</a>.

Bald eagle nests are often very large in order to compensate for size of the birds. The largest recorded nest was found in Florida in 1963, and was measured at nearly 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep.

In Florida, nesting habitats often consist of <a href="Mangrove">mangrove swamps</a>, the shorelines of lakes and rivers, <a href="pine">pine</a>lands, seasonally flooded <a href="flatwoods">flatwoods</a>, <a href="Swamp">hardwood swamps</a>, and open <a href="prairie">prairie</a>s and <a href="pasture">pasture</a>land with scattered tall trees. Favored nesting trees in Florida are <a href="Pinus%20elliottii">slash pines</a> ("Pinus elliottii"), <a href="Pinus%20palustris">longleaf pines</a> ("P. palustris"), <a href="Pinus%20taeda">loblolly pines</a> ("P. taeda") and <a href="Cupressaceae">cypress trees</a>, but for the southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used. In <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, groves of mature <a href="Populus%20sect.%20Aigeiros">cottonwoods</a> or tall pines found along streams and rivers are typical bald eagle nesting habitats. Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of <a href="Pinus%20ponderosa">ponderosa pines</a> ("Pinus ponderosa") to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland. In <a href="Southeast%20Alaska">Southeast Alaska</a>, <a href="Picea%20sitchensis">Sitka spruce</a> ("Picea sitchensis") provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by <a href="Tsuga">hemlocks</a> ("Tsuga") at 20%. Increasingly, eagles nest in man-made reservoirs stocked with fish.
The bald eagle is usually quite sensitive to human activity while nesting, and is found most commonly in areas with minimal human disturbance. It chooses sites more than from low-density human disturbance and more than from medium- to high-density human disturbance. However, bald eagles will occasionally venture into large estuaries or secluded groves within major cities, such as Hardtack Island on the <a href="Willamette%20River">Willamette River</a> in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> or <a href="John%20Heinz%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge%20at%20Tinicum">John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, which are surrounded by a great quantity of human activity. Even more contrary to the usual sensitivity to disturbance, a family of bald eagles moved to the <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a> neighborhood in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> in 2010.

While wintering, bald eagles tend to be less habitat and disturbance sensitive. They will commonly congregate at spots with plentiful perches and waters with plentiful prey and (in Northern climes) partially unfrozen waters. Alternately, non-breeding or wintering bald eagles, particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance, spend their time in various upland, terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways. In the northern half of North America (especially the interior portion), this terrestrial inhabitance by bald eagles tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not be accessible. Upland wintering habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium-sized mammals, such as <a href="prairie">prairie</a>s, <a href="meadow">meadow</a>s or <a href="tundra">tundra</a>, or open forests with regular carrion access.

The bald eagle is a powerful flier, and soars on <a href="thermal">thermal convection currents</a>. It reaches speeds of when gliding and flapping, and about while carrying fish. Its dive speed is between , though it seldom dives vertically. It is partially migratory, depending on location. If its territory has access to open water, it remains there year-round, but if the body of water freezes during the winter, making it impossible to obtain food, it migrates to the south or to the coast. A number of populations are subject to post-breeding dispersal, mainly in juveniles; Florida eagles, for example, will disperse northwards in the summer. The bald eagle selects migration routes which take advantage of <a href="thermal">thermal</a>s, <a href="updraft">updraft</a>s, and food resources. During migration, it may ascend in a thermal and then glide down, or may ascend in updrafts created by the wind against a cliff or other terrain. Migration generally takes place during the daytime, usually between the local hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., when thermals are produced by the sun.

The bald eagle is an opportunistic carnivore with the capacity to consume a great variety of prey. Throughout their range, <a href="fish">fish</a> often comprise the majority of the eagle's diet. In 20 food habit studies across the species' range, fish comprised 56% of the diet of nesting eagles, birds 28%, mammals 14% and other prey 2%. In <a href="Southeast%20Alaska">Southeast Alaska</a>, fish comprise approximately 66% of the year-around diet of bald eagles and 78% of the prey brought to the nest by the parents. Eagles living in the <a href="Columbia%20River%20Estuary">Columbia River Estuary</a> in <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> were found to rely on fish for 90% of their dietary intake. In the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>, spawning <a href="trout">trout</a> and <a href="salmon">salmon</a> provide most of the bald eagles' diet from late summer throughout fall. Southeast Alaskan eagles largely prey on <a href="pink%20salmon">pink salmon</a> ("Oncorhynchus gorbuscha"), <a href="coho%20salmon">coho salmon</a> ("O. kisutch") and, more locally, <a href="sockeye%20salmon">sockeye salmon</a> ("O. nerka"), with <a href="chinook%20salmon">chinook salmon</a> ("O. tshawytscha"), due to their large size ( average adult size) probably being taken only as carrion. Also important in the estuaries and shallow coastlines of southern Alaska are <a href="Pacific%20herring">Pacific herring</a> ("Clupea pallasii"), <a href="sand%20lance">Pacific sand lance</a> ("Ammodytes hexapterus") and <a href="eulachon">eulachon</a> ("Thaleichthys pacificus"). In Oregon's Columbia River Estuary, the most significant prey species were <a href="largescale%20sucker">largescale sucker</a>s ("Catostomus macrocheilus") (17.3% of the prey selected there), <a href="American%20shad">American shad</a> ("Alosa sapidissima"; 13%) and <a href="common%20carp">common carp</a> ("Cyprinus carpio"; 10.8%). Eagles living in the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> in <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> were found to subsist largely on <a href="American%20gizzard%20shad">American gizzard shad</a> ("Dorosoma cepedianum"), <a href="threadfin%20shad">threadfin shad</a> ("D. petenense") and <a href="white%20bass">white bass</a> ("Morone chrysops"). Floridian eagles have been reported to prey on <a href="catfish">catfish</a>, mostly prevalently the <a href="brown%20bullhead">brown bullhead</a> ("Ameiurus nebulosus") and any species in the "<a href="Ictalurus">Ictalurus</a>" genus as well as <a href="mullet%20%28fish%29">mullet</a>, <a href="trout">trout</a>, <a href="needlefish">needlefish</a>, and <a href="eel">eel</a>s. Wintering eagles on the <a href="Platte%20River">Platte River</a> in <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a> preyed mainly on American gizzard shads and common carp. From observation in the Columbia River, 58% of the fish were caught live by the eagle, 24% were scavenged as carcasses and 18% were pirated away from other animals.

Even eagles living in relatively arid regions still typically rely primarily on fish as prey. In <a href="Sonora">Sonora</a> (<a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>) and <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, 77% and over 73%, respectively, of prey remains at the nests were from fish, largely various catfish and <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow trout</a> ("Oncorhynchus mykiss"). Prey fish targeted by bald eagles are often quite large. When experimenters offered fish of different sizes in the breeding season around <a href="Lake%20Britton">Lake Britton</a> in <a href="California">California</a>, fish measuring were taken 71.8% of the time by parent eagles while fish measuring were chosen only 25% of the time. At nests around <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a>, the remains of fish (mostly <a href="Catostomus">suckers</a>) were found to average in total length. In the Columbia River estuary, most preyed on by eagles were estimated to measure between in length, and carp flown with (laboriously) were up to in length.
<a href="Benthic%20zone">Benthic fishes</a> such as catfish are usually consumed after they die and float to the surface, though while temporarily swimming in the open may be more vulnerable to predation than most fish since their eyes focus downwards. Bald eagles also regularly exploit water turbines which produce battered, stunned or dead fish easily consumed. Predators who leave behind scraps of dead fish that they kill, such as <a href="brown%20bear">brown bear</a>s ("Ursus arctos"), <a href="Gray%20wolf">gray wolves</a> ("Canis lupus") and <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>es ("Vulpes vulpes"), may be habitually followed in order to scavenge the kills secondarily. Once North Pacific salmon die off after spawning, usually local bald eagles eat salmon carcasses almost exclusively. Eagles in <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> need to consume of fish each day for survival, with adults generally consuming more than juveniles and thus reducing potential energy deficiency and increasing survival during winter.

Behind fish, the next most significant prey base for bald eagles are other <a href="Water%20bird">waterbirds</a>. The contribution of such birds to the eagle's diet is variable, depending on the quantity and availability of fish near the water's surface. Waterbirds can seasonally comprise from 7% to 80% of the prey selection for eagles in certain localities. Exceptionally, in the <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Greater Yellowstone area</a>, birds were eaten as regularly as fish year-around, with both prey groups comprising 43% of the studied dietary intake. Preferred avian prey includes <a href="grebe">grebe</a>s, <a href="alcid">alcid</a>s, <a href="duck">duck</a>s, <a href="gull">gull</a>s, <a href="coot">coot</a>s, <a href="heron">heron</a>s, <a href="egret">egret</a>s, and <a href="geese">geese</a>. Bird species most preferred as prey by eagles tend to be medium-sized, such as <a href="western%20grebe">western grebe</a>s ("Aechmophorus occidentalis"), <a href="mallard">mallard</a>s ("Anas platyrhynchos") and <a href="American%20coot">American coot</a>s ("Fulica americana") as such prey is relatively easy for the much larger eagles to catch and fly with. <a href="American%20herring%20gull">American herring gull</a> ("Larus smithsonianus") are the favored avian prey species for eagles living around Lake Superior. Larger waterbirds are occasionally prey as well, with wintering <a href="Emperor%20goose">emperor geese</a> ("Chen canagica") and <a href="snow%20goose">snow geese</a> ("C. caerulescens"), which gather in large groups, sometimes becoming regular prey. Other large waterbirds hunted at least occasionally by bald eagles have included <a href="common%20loon">common loon</a>s ("Gavis immer"), <a href="great%20black-backed%20gull">great black-backed gull</a>s ("Larus marinus"), <a href="sandhill%20crane">sandhill crane</a>s ("Grus canadensis"), <a href="great%20blue%20heron">great blue heron</a>s ("Ardea herodias"), <a href="Canada%20goose">Canada geese</a> ("Branta canadensis"), <a href="brown%20pelican">brown pelican</a>s ("Pelecanus occidentalis"), and fledging <a href="American%20white%20pelican">American white pelican</a>s ("P. erythrorhynchos"). Colony nesting <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s, such as <a href="Alcidae">alcids</a>, <a href="storm%20petrel">storm petrel</a>s, <a href="cormorant">cormorant</a>s, <a href="northern%20gannet">northern gannet</a>s ("Morus bassanus"), <a href="tern">tern</a>s and <a href="gull">gull</a>s, may be especially vulnerable to predation. Due to easy accessibility and lack of formidable nest defense by such species, bald eagles are capable of preying on such seabirds at all ages, from eggs to mature adults, and can effectively cull large portions of a colony.

Along some portions of the <a href="North%20Pacific">North Pacific</a> coastline, bald eagles which had historically preyed mainly <a href="kelp">kelp</a>-dwelling fish and supplementally <a href="sea%20otter">sea otter</a> ("Enhydra lutris") pups are now preying mainly on seabird colonies since both the fish (possibly due to overfishing) and otters (cause unknown) have had precipitous population declines, causing concern for seabird conservation. Because of this more extensive predation, some biologist have expressed concern that <a href="murre">murre</a>s are heading for a "conservation collision" due to heavy eagle predation. Eagles have been confirmed to attack nocturnally active, burrow-nesting seabird species such as <a href="storm%20petrel">storm petrel</a>s and <a href="shearwater">shearwater</a>s by digging out their burrows and feeding on all animals they find inside. If a bald eagle flies close by, waterbirds will often fly away en masse, though in other cases they may seemingly ignore a perched eagle. If the said birds are on a colony, this exposed their unprotected eggs and nestlings to scavengers such as <a href="gull">gull</a>s. Bird prey may occasionally be attacked in flight, with prey up to the size of <a href="Canada%20goose">Canada geese</a> attacked and killed in mid-air. Unprecedented photographs of a bald eagle unsuccessfully attempting to prey on a much larger adult <a href="trumpeter%20swan">trumpeter swan</a> ("Cygnus buccinator") in mid-flight were taken recently. While adults often actively prey on waterbirds, congregated wintering waterfowl are frequently exploited for carcasses to scavenge by immature eagles in harsh winter weather. Bald eagles have been recorded as killing other <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">raptors</a> on occasion. In some cases, these may be attacks of competition or <a href="kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasitism</a> on rival species but ended with the consumption of the victim. Raptorial birds reported to be hunted by these eagles have included large adults of species such as <a href="red-tailed%20hawk">red-tailed hawk</a>s ("Buteo jamaicensis"), <a href="osprey">osprey</a>s ("Pandion haliaetus") and <a href="Black%20vulture">black</a> ("Coragyps atratus") and <a href="turkey%20vulture">turkey vulture</a>s ("Cathartes aura").

<a href="Mammal">Mammal</a>ian prey includes <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s, <a href="hare">hare</a>s, <a href="ground%20squirrel">ground squirrel</a>s, <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s ("Procyon lotor"), <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>s ("Ondatra zibethicus"), <a href="North%20American%20beaver">beavers</a> ("Castor canadensis"), and <a href="deer">deer</a> fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> area, bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons. Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On <a href="Protection%20Island%20%28Washington%20state%29">Protection Island</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, they commonly feed on <a href="harbor%20seal">harbor seal</a> ("Phoca vitulina") afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. On <a href="San%20Juan%20Island">San Juan Island</a> in <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, introduced <a href="European%20rabbit">European rabbit</a>s ("Oryctolagus cuniculus"), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles. In landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals that occur in colonies or local concentrations, such as <a href="prairie%20dog">prairie dog</a>s ("Cynomys") and <a href="jackrabbit">jackrabbit</a>s ("Lepus"). Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially <a href="sheep">sheep</a> ("Ovis aries"). There are a handful of proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens weighing up to , by bald eagles but they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods. There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over , is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.

Supplemental prey are readily taken given the opportunity. In some areas <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s may become regular prey, especially warm areas such as <a href="Florida">Florida</a> where reptile diversity is high. <a href="Turtle">Turtle</a>s are perhaps the most regularly hunted type of reptile. In coastal <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, 14 of 20 studied eagle nests included remains of turtles. The main species found were <a href="Sternotherus%20odoratus">common musk turtles</a> ("Sternotherus odoratus"), <a href="diamondback%20terrapin">diamondback terrapin</a> ("Malaclemys terrapin") and juvenile <a href="common%20snapping%20turtle">common snapping turtle</a>s ("Chelydra serpentina"). In these New Jersey nests, mainly subadult and small adults were taken, ranging in carapace length from . <a href="Snake">Snake</a>s are also taken occasionally, especially partially aquatic ones, as are <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s and <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s (largely <a href="crayfish">crayfish</a> and <a href="crab">crab</a>s).

To hunt fish, the eagle swoops down over the water and snatches the fish out of the water with its <a href="talons">talons</a>. They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other. Eagles have structures on their toes called spicules that allow them to grasp fish. <a href="Osprey">Osprey</a> also have this adaptation. Bald eagles have powerful talons and have been recorded flying with a <a href="mule%20deer">mule deer</a> ("Odocoileus hemionus") fawn. This feat is the record for the heaviest load carrying ever verified for a flying bird. It has been estimated that the gripping power (pounds by square inch) of the bald eagle is ten times greater than that of a human. Bald eagles can fly with fish at least equal to their own weight, but if the fish is too heavy to lift, the eagle may be dragged into the water. It may swim to safety, in some cases pulling the catch along to the shore as it swims, but some eagles drown or succumb to <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a>. Many sources claim that bald eagles, like all large eagles, cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions. On numerous occasions, when large prey such as mature salmon or geese are attacked, eagles have been seen to make contact and then drag the prey in a strenuously labored, low flight over the water to a bank, where they then finish off and dismember the prey. When food is abundant, an eagle can gorge itself by storing up to of food in a pouch in the throat called a crop. Gorging allows the bird to fast for several days if food becomes unavailable. Occasionally, bald eagles may hunt cooperatively when confronting prey, especially relatively large prey such as jackrabbits or herons, with one bird distracting potential prey, while the other comes behind it in order to ambush it. While hunting waterfowl, bald eagles repeatedly fly at a target and cause it to dive repeatedly, hoping to exhaust the victim so it can be caught (white-tailed eagles have been recorded hunting waterfowl in the same way). When hunting concentrated prey, a successful catch which often results in the hunting eagle being pursued by other eagles and needing to find an isolated perch for consumption if it is able to carry it away successfully.

Unlike some other eagle species, bald eagles rarely take on evasive or dangerous prey on their own. The species mainly target prey which is much smaller than themselves, with most live fish caught weighing and most waterbirds preyed weighing . They obtain much of their food as <a href="carrion">carrion</a> or via a practice known as <a href="kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasitism</a>, by which they steal prey away from other predators. Due to their dietary habits, bald eagles are frequently viewed in a negative light by humans. Thanks to their superior foraging ability and experience, adults are generally more likely to hunt live prey than immature eagles, which often obtain their food from scavenging. They are not very selective about the condition or origin, whether provided by humans, other animals, auto accidents or natural causes, of a carcass's presence, but will avoid eating carrion where disturbances from humans are a regular occurrence. They will scavenge carcasses up to the size of <a href="whale">whale</a>s, though carcasses of <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a>s and large <a href="fish">fish</a> are seemingly preferred. Bald eagles also may sometimes feed on material scavenged or stolen from campsites and picnics, as well as garbage dumps (dump usage is habitual mainly in Alaska).

When competing for food, eagles will usually dominate other fish-eaters and scavengers, aggressively displacing <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s such as <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s ("Canis latrans") and <a href="fox">fox</a>es, and birds such as <a href="corvid">corvid</a>s, <a href="gull">gull</a>s, <a href="vulture">vulture</a>s and other <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">raptor</a>s. Occasionally, coyotes, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s ("Lynx rufus") and <a href="Dog">domestic dogs</a> ("Canis lupus familiaris") can displace eagles from carrion, usually less confident immature birds, as has been recorded in Maine. Bald eagles are less active, bold predators than golden eagles and get relatively more of their food as carrion and from kleptoparasitism (although it is now generally thought that golden eagles eat more carrion than was previously assumed). However, the two species are roughly equal in size, aggressiveness and physical strength and so competitions can go either way. Neither species is known to be dominant, and the outcome depends on the size and disposition of the individual eagles involved. The bald eagle is thought to be much more numerous in North America than the golden eagle, with the bald species estimated to number at least 150,000 individuals, about twice as many golden eagles there are estimated to live in North America. Due to this, bald eagles often outnumber golden eagles at attractive food sources. Despite the potential for contention between these animals, in <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> during winter, a golden eagle and numerous bald eagles were observed to hunt <a href="snow%20geese">snow geese</a> alongside each other without conflict. Similarly, both eagle species have been recorded, via video-monitoring, to feed on gut pills and carcasses of <a href="white-tailed%20deer">white-tailed deer</a> ("Odocoileus virginianus") in remote forest clearings in the eastern <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> without apparent conflict. Many bald eagles are habitual kleptoparasites, especially in winters when fish are harder to come by. They have been recorded stealing fish from other predators such as <a href="osprey">osprey</a>s, <a href="heron">heron</a>s and even <a href="otter">otter</a>s. They have also been recorded opportunistically pirating birds from <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>s ("Falco peregrinus"), prairie dogs from <a href="ferruginous%20hawk">ferruginous hawk</a>s ("Buteo regalis") and even jackrabbits from <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>s. When they approach scavengers like dogs, gulls or vultures at carrion sites, they often aggressively attack them and try to force them to disgorge their food. Healthy adult bald eagles are not preyed on in the wild and are thus considered <a href="apex%20predator">apex predator</a>s.

Bald eagles are sexually mature at four or five years of age. When they are old enough to breed, they often return to the area where they were born. It is thought that bald eagles <a href="mate%20for%20life">mate for life</a>. However, if one member of a pair dies or disappears, the survivor will choose a new mate. A pair which has repeatedly failed in breeding attempts may split and look for new mates. Bald eagle courtship involves elaborate, spectacular calls and flight displays. The flight includes swoops, chases, and cartwheels, in which they fly high, lock talons, and free fall, separating just before hitting the ground. Usually, a territory defended by a mature pair will be of waterside habitat.

Compared to most other raptors which mostly nest in April or May, bald eagles are early breeders: nest building or reinforcing is often by mid-February, egg laying is often late February (sometimes during deep snow in the North), and incubation is usually mid-March and early May. Eggs hatch from mid April to early May, and the young fledge late June to early July. The nest is the largest of any bird in North America; it is used repeatedly over many years and with new material added each year may eventually be as large as deep, across and weigh ; one nest in Florida was found to be deep, across, and to weigh . This nest is on record as the largest tree nest ever recorded for any animal. Usually nests are used for under five years or so, as they either collapse in storms or break the branches supporting them by their sheer weight. However, one nest in the <a href="Midwest">Midwest</a> was occupied continuously for at least 34 years. The nest is built out of branches, usually in large trees found near water. When breeding where there are no trees, the bald eagle will nest on the ground, as has been recorded largely in areas largely isolated from terrestrial predators, such as Amchitka Island in Alaska. In <a href="Sonora">Sonora</a>, <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, eagles have been observed nesting on top of <a href="Pachycereus%20pecten-aboriginum">Hecho catcuses</a> ("Pachycereus pectinaboriginum"). Nests located on cliffs and rock pinnacles have been reported historically in <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> and <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, but currently are only verified to occur only in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>. The eggs average about long, ranging from , and have a breadth of , ranging from . Eggs in Alaska averaged in mass, while in <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> they averaged . As with their ultimate body size, egg size tends to increase further away from the Equator. Eagles produce between one and three eggs per year, two being typical. Rarely, four eggs have been found in nests but these may be exceptional cases of <a href="polygyny">polygyny</a>. Eagles in captivity have been capable of producing up to seven eggs. it is rare for all three chicks to successfully reach the fledging stage. The oldest chick often bears the advantage of larger size and louder voice, which tends to draw the parents attention towards it. Occasionally, as is recorded in many large raptorial birds, the oldest sibling sometimes attacks and kills its younger sibling(s), especially early in the nesting period when their sizes are most different. However, nearly half of known bald eagle produce two fledgings (more rarely three), unlike in some other "eagle" species such as some in the "Aquila" genus, in which a second fledging is typically observed in less than 20% of nests, despite two eggs typically being laid. Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs, but the female does most of the sitting. The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting material during this stage. For the first two to three weeks of the nestling period, at least one adult is at the nest almost 100% of the time. After five to six weeks, the attendance of parents usually drops off considerably (with the parents often perching in trees nearby). A young eaglet can gain up to a day, the fastest growth rate of any North American bird. The young eaglets pick up and manipulate sticks, play tug of war with each other, practice holding things in their talons, and stretch and flap their wings. By eight weeks, the eaglets are strong enough to flap their wings, lift their feet off the nest platform, and rise up in the air. The young fledge at anywhere from 8 to 14 weeks of age, though will remain close to the nest and attended to by their parents for a further 6 weeks. Juvenile eagles first start dispersing away from their parents about 8 weeks after they fledge. Variability in departure date related to effects of sex and hatching order on growth and development. For the next four years, immature eagles wander widely in search of food until they attain adult plumage and are eligible to reproduce. Additionally, as shown by a pair of eagles in Shoal Harbor Migratory Bird Sanctuary located near Sydney, British Columbia on June 9, 2017, bald eagles have been recently recorded to occasionally adopt other raptor fledglings into their nests. The pair of eagles in question were recorded carrying a juvenile <a href="red-tailed%20hawk">red-tailed hawk</a> back to their nest, whereupon the chick was accepted into the family by both the parents and the eagles' three fledgelings. Whether or not the chick survived remained to be seen at the time, as bald eagles are known for committing fratricide amongst their siblings. However, the aggression of the red-tailed hawk may ensure its survival, as the hawks are well-known for their ability to successfully defend against an eagle attack. Six weeks after however, it was discovered that the hawk, nicknamed "Spunky" by biologists monitoring the nest, had grown to fledgeling size and was learning how to hunt, indicating that it successfully survived.

The average lifespan of bald eagles in the wild is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 38 years of age. In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population appears to be influenced by its location and access to prey. As they are no longer heavily persecuted, adult mortality is quite low. In one study of Florida eagles, adult bald eagles reportedly had 100% annual survival rate. In <a href="Prince%20William%20Sound">Prince William Sound</a> in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, adults had an annual survival rate of 88% even after the <a href="Exxon%20Valdez%20oil%20spill">Exxon Valdez oil spill</a> adversely affected eagles in the area. Of 1,428 individuals from across the range necropsied by National Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984, 329 (23%) eagles died from trauma, primarily impact with wires and vehicles; 309 (22%) died from gunshot; 158 (11%) died from poisoning; 130 (9%) died from electrocution; 68 (5%) died from trapping; 110 (8%) from emaciation; and 31 (2%) from disease; cause of death was undetermined in 293 (20%) of cases. In this study, 68% of mortality was human-caused. Today eagle-shooting is believed to be considerably reduced due to the species protected status. In one case, an adult eagle investigating a peregrine falcon nest for prey items sustained a concussion from a swooping parent peregrine, and ultimately died days later from it. An early natural history video depicting a <a href="cougar">cougar</a> ("Puma concolor") ambushing and killing an immature bald eagle feeding at a rabbit carcass is viewable online although this film may have been staged.

Most non-human-related mortality involves nestlings or eggs. Around 50% of eagles survive their first year. However, in the Chesapeake Bay area, 100% of 39 radio-tagged nestlings survived to their first year. Occasionally, nestling or egg fatalities are due to nest collapses, starvation, sibling aggression or inclement weather. Another significant cause of egg and nestling mortality is predation. These have been verified to be preyed by large <a href="gull">gull</a>s, <a href="corvid">corvid</a>s (including <a href="raven">raven</a>s, <a href="Corvus%20%28genus%29">crow</a>s and <a href="magpie">magpie</a>s), <a href="wolverine">wolverine</a>s ("Gulo gulo"), <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s, <a href="owl">owl</a>s, <a href="eagle">eagle</a>s, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s ("Lynx rufus"), <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a>s ("Ursus americanus") and <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s. If food access is low, parental attendance at the nest may be lower because both parents may have to forage thus resulting in less protection. Nestlings are usually exempt from predation by terrestrial carnivores that are poor tree-climbers, but <a href="Arctic%20fox">Arctic fox</a>es ("Vulpes lagopus") occasionally snatched nestlings from ground nests on Amchitka Island in Alaska before they were extirpated from the island. The bald eagle will defend its nest fiercely from all comers and has even repelled attacks from bears, having been recorded knocking a black bear out of a tree when the latter tried to climb a tree holding nestlings.

Once a common sight in much of the continent, the bald eagle was severely affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide <a href="DDT">DDT</a>. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to <a href="biomagnification">biomagnification</a>. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's <a href="calcium">calcium</a> metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch. It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the bald eagle population was 300,000–500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 <a href="Contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous states</a> of the US.
Other factors in bald eagle population reductions were a widespread loss of suitable habitat, as well as both legal and illegal shooting. In 1930 a New York City ornithologist wrote that in the state of Alaska in the previous 12 years approximately 70,000 bald eagles had been shot. Many of the hunters killed the bald eagles under the long-held beliefs that bald eagles grabbed young lambs and even children with their talons, yet the birds were innocent of most of these alleged acts of predation (lamb predation is rare, human predation is thought to be non-existent). Later illegal shooting was described as "the leading cause of direct mortality in both adult and immature bald eagles," according to a 1978 report in the Endangered Species Technical Bulletin. In 1984, the <a href="National%20Wildlife%20Federation">National Wildlife Federation</a> listed hunting, power-line electrocution, and collisions in flight as the leading causes of eagle deaths. Bald eagles have also been killed by oil, lead, and mercury pollution, and by human and predator intrusion at nests.

The species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the <a href="Migratory%20Bird%20Treaty%20Act%20of%201918">1918 Migratory Bird Treaty</a>, later extended to all of North America. The <a href="Bald%20and%20Golden%20Eagle%20Protection%20Act">Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act</a>, approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the bald eagle and the <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>, prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Perhaps most significant in the species' recovery, in 1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States due to the fact that it inhibited the reproduction of many birds. DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.
With regulations in place and DDT banned, the eagle population rebounded. The bald eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada, particularly near large bodies of water. In the early 1980s, the estimated total population was 100,000 individuals, with 110,000–115,000 by 1992; the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> with the largest resident population is <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, with about 40,000–50,000, with the next highest population the <a href="Provinces%20and%20territories%20of%20Canada">Canadian province</a> of <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> with 20,000–30,000 in 1992. Obtaining a precise count of bald eagles population is extremely difficult. The most recent data submitted by individual states was in 2006, when 9789 breeding pairs were reported. For some time, the stronghold breeding population of bald eagles in the lower 48 states was in <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, where over a thousand pairs have held on while populations in other states were significantly reduced by DDT use. Today, the <a href="Contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous state</a> with the largest number of breeding pairs of eagles is <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> with an estimated 1,312 pairs, surpassing Florida's most recent count of 1,166 pairs. 23, or nearly half, of the 48 contiguous states now have at least 100 breeding pairs of bald eagles. In Washington State, there were only 105 occupied nests in 1980. That number increased by about 30 per year, so that by 2005 there were 840 occupied nests. 2005 was the last year that the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife counted occupied nest. Further population increases in Washington may be limited by the availability of late winter food, particularly salmon.

The bald eagle was officially removed from the U.S. federal government's list of endangered species on July 12, 1995, by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, when it was reclassified from "Endangered" to "Threatened." On July 6, 1999, a proposal was initiated "To Remove the Bald Eagle in the Lower 48 States From the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife." It was de-listed on June 28, 2007. It has also been assigned a risk level of <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a> category on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. In the <a href="Exxon%20Valdez%20Oil%20Spill">Exxon Valdez Oil Spill</a> of 1989 an estimated 247 were killed in <a href="Prince%20William%20Sound">Prince William Sound</a>, though the local population returned to its pre-spill level by 1995. In some areas, the population has increased such that the eagles are a pest.

In December 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed quadrupling to 4,200 per year the amount of bald eagles that can be killed by the wind electric generation industry without paying a penalty. If issued, the permits would last 30 years, six times the current 5-year permits.

<a href="License">Permits</a> are required to keep bald eagles in captivity in the United States. Permits are primarily issued to public educational institutions, and the eagles which they show are permanently injured individuals which cannot be released to the wild. The facilities where eagles are kept must be equipped with adequate caging and facilities, as well as workers experienced in the handling and care of eagles. Bald eagles cannot legally be kept for <a href="falconry">falconry</a> in the United States. As a rule, the bald eagle is a poor choice for public shows, being timid, prone to becoming highly stressed, and unpredictable in nature. Native American tribes can obtain a "Native American Religious Use" permit to keep non-releasable eagles as well. They use their naturally molted feathers for religious and cultural ceremonies. The bald eagle can be long-lived in captivity if well cared for, but does not breed well even under the best conditions. In Canada, a license is required to keep bald eagles for <a href="falconry">falconry</a>.

The bald eagle is important in various <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> cultures and, as the <a href="national%20symbol">national bird</a> of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, is prominent in seals and logos, coinage, postage stamps, and other items relating to the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. federal government</a>.

The bald eagle is a sacred bird in some North American cultures, and its feathers, like those of the <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>, are central to many religious and <a href="Native%20American%20mythology">spiritual</a> customs among <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native Americans</a>. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures. Many <a href="pow%20wow">pow wow</a> dancers use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. In the <a href="Navajo%20people">Navajo</a> Tradition an Eagle feather is represented to be a Protector, along with the Feather Navajo Medicine Man use the leg and wing bones for ceremonial whistles. The <a href="Lakota%20people">Lakota</a>, for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college. The <a href="Pawnee%20people">Pawnee</a> considered eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young. The <a href="Choctaw">Choctaw</a> considered the bald eagle, who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun, as a symbol of peace.
During the <a href="Sun%20Dance">Sun Dance</a>, which is practiced by many <a href="Plains%20Indian">Plains Indian</a> tribes, the eagle is represented in several ways. The eagle nest is represented by the fork of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used during the course of the dance. Also during the dance, a <a href="medicine%20man">medicine man</a> may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.

Current <a href="eagle%20feather%20law">eagle feather law</a> stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain or possess bald or golden eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use. The constitutionality of these laws has been questioned by Native American groups on the basis that it violates the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a> by affecting ability to practice their religion freely.

The <a href="National%20Eagle%20Repository">National Eagle Repository</a>, a division of the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">FWS</a>, exists as a means to receive, process, and store bald and <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>s which are found dead, and to distribute the eagles, their parts and feathers, to <a href="List%20of%20federally%20recognized%20tribes">federally recognized</a> Native American tribes for use in religious ceremonies.

The bald eagle is the national bird of the <a href="United%20States">United States of America</a>. The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a>, in which eagle imagery (usually involving the golden eagle) was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the <a href="Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a> adopted the design for the <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20the%20United%20States">Great Seal of the United States</a> depicting a bald eagle grasping 13 <a href="arrow">arrow</a>s and an <a href="olive%20branch">olive branch</a> with its talons.

The bald eagle appears on most official seals of the U.S. government, including the <a href="Seal%20of%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">presidential seal</a>, the <a href="Flag%20of%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">presidential flag</a>, and in the <a href="logo">logo</a>s of many U.S. federal agencies. Between 1916 and 1945, the presidential flag (but not the seal) showed an eagle facing to its left (the viewer's right), which gave rise to the <a href="urban%20legend">urban legend</a> that the flag is changed to have the eagle face towards the olive branch in peace, and towards the arrows in wartime.

Contrary to popular legend, there is no evidence that <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> ever publicly supported the <a href="wild%20turkey">wild turkey</a> ("Meleagris gallopavo"), rather than the bald eagle, as a symbol of the United States. However, in a letter written to his daughter in 1784 from Paris, criticizing the <a href="Society%20of%20the%20Cincinnati">Society of the Cincinnati</a>, he stated his personal distaste for the bald eagle's behavior. In the letter Franklin states:

Franklin opposed the creation of the Society because he viewed it, with its hereditary membership, as a <a href="order%20%28honour%29">noble order</a> unwelcome in the newly independent <a href="Republic">Republic</a>, contrary to the ideals of <a href="Lucius%20Quinctius%20Cincinnatus">Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus</a>, for whom the Society was named; his reference to the two kinds of birds is interpreted as a satirical comparison between the Society of the Cincinnati and Cincinnatus.

Brown bear

The brown bear ("Ursus arctos") is a large <a href="bear">bear</a> with the widest distribution of any living <a href="ursidae">ursid</a>. The species is distributed across much of northern <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> and <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. It is one of the two largest terrestrial <a href="carnivoran">carnivoran</a>s alive today, rivaled in body size only by its close cousin, the <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a> ("Ursus maritimus"), which is much less variable in size and averages larger due to this. There are several recognized subspecies, many of which are quite well-known within their native ranges, found in the brown bear species.

The brown bear's principal range includes parts of <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>, <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> (mostly <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>), <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, and the <a href="Carpathian">Carpathian</a> region (especially <a href="Romania">Romania</a>), <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>, and <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a>. The brown bear is recognized as a national and state animal in several European countries.

While the brown bear's range has shrunk and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> species by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) with a total population of approximately 200,000. As of 2012, this and the <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a> are the only bear species not classified as threatened by the IUCN. However, the <a href="California%20grizzly%20bear">Californian</a>, <a href="Atlas%20bear">North African (Atlas bear)</a>, and <a href="Mexican%20grizzly%20bear">Mexican</a> subspecies were hunted to extinction in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and many of the southern Asian subspecies are highly endangered. One of the smaller-bodied subspecies, the <a href="Himalayan%20brown%20bear">Himalayan brown bear</a>, is critically endangered, occupying only 2% of its former range and threatened by uncontrolled poaching for its parts. The <a href="Marsican%20brown%20bear">Marsican brown bear</a>, one of several currently isolated populations of the main Eurasian brown bear race, in central <a href="Italy">Italy</a> is believed to have a population of just 30 to 40 bears.

The brown bear is sometimes referred to as the "bruin", from <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a>. This name originated in the fable, "History of <a href="Reynard%20the%20Fox">Reynard the Fox</a>", translated by <a href="William%20Caxton">William Caxton</a>, from <a href="Middle%20Dutch">Middle Dutch</a> "bruun" or "bruyn", meaning "<a href="brown">brown</a>" (the color). In the mid-19th century United States, the brown bear was termed "Old Ephraim" and sometimes as "Moccasin Joe".

The scientific name of the brown bear, "Ursus arctos", comes from the Latin "<a href="Bear%23Etymology">ursus</a>", meaning "bear", and Άρκτος "arctos", from the Greek word for bear.

Brown bears are thought to have evolved from "<a href="Ursus%20etruscus">Ursus etruscus</a>" in Asia. The brown bear, per Kurten (1976), has been stated as "clearly derived from the Asian population of "Ursus savini" about 800,000 years ago; spread into Europe, to the New World." A genetic analysis indicated that the brown bear lineage diverged from the <a href="cave%20bear">cave bear</a> species complex approximately 1.2-1.4 million years ago but did not clarify if "U. savini" persisted as a <a href="paraspecies">paraspecies</a> for the brown bear before perishing. The oldest fossils positively identified as from this species occur in China from about 0.5 <a href="mya%20%28unit%29">million years ago</a>. Brown bears entered Europe about 250,000 years ago, and North Africa shortly after. Brown bear remains from the Pleistocene period are common in the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>, where it is thought they might have outcompeted <a href="cave%20bear">cave bear</a>s ("Ursus spelaeus"). The species entered Alaska 100,000 years ago, though they did not move south until 13,000 years ago. It is speculated that brown bears were unable to migrate south until the extinction of the much larger "<a href="Short-faced%20bear">Arctodus simus</a>".

Several paleontologists suggest the possibility of two separate brown bear migrations: inland brown bears, also known as <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzlies</a>, are thought to stem from narrow-skulled bears which migrated from northern Siberia to central Alaska and the rest of the continent, while Kodiak bears descend from broad-skulled bears from Kamchatka, which colonized the Alaskan peninsula. Brown bear fossils discovered in Ontario, Ohio, Kentucky and Labrador show the species occurred farther east than indicated in historic records. In North America, two types of the subspecies "Ursus arctos horribilis" are generally recognized—the coastal brown bear and the inland <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a>; these two types broadly define the range of sizes of all brown bear subspecies.

There are many methods used by scientists to define bear <a href="species">species</a> and <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> as no one method is always effective. Brown bear taxonomy and subspecies classification has been described as "formidable and confusing" with few authorities listing the same specific set of subspecies. Genetic testing is now perhaps the most important way to scientifically define brown bear relationships and names. Generally genetic testing uses the word <a href="clade">clade</a> rather than species because a genetic test alone cannot define a <a href="biological%20species">biological species</a>. Most genetic studies report on how closely related the bears are (or their <a href="Genetic%20distance">Genetic distance</a>). There are hundreds of obsolete brown bear subspecies, each with its own name, and this can become confusing; Hall (1981) lists 86 different types and even as many as 90 have been proposed. However, recent DNA analysis has identified as few as five main clades which contain all extant brown bears. As of 2005, 16 extant or recently extinct subspecies are recognized by the general scientific community.

As well as the exact number of overall brown bear subspecies, its precise relationship to the <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a> also remains in debate. The polar bear is a recent offshoot of the brown bear. The point at which the polar bear diverged from the brown bear is unclear with estimations based on genetics and fossils ranging from 400,000 to 70,000 years ago, but most recent analysis has indicated that the polar split somewhere between 250,000 and 130,000 years ago. Under some definitions, the brown bear can be construed as the <a href="paraspecies">paraspecies</a> for the polar bear. DNA analysis recently revealed that the brown bears in North America are genetically quite homogeneous except for the one subspecies <a href="Kodiak%20bear">Kodiak bear</a> and the enigmatic <a href="ABC%20Islands%20bears">ABC Islands bears</a> that have the <a href="mtDNA">mtDNA</a> of the <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a> ("Ursus maritimus").

The subspecies have been listed as follows:

A grizzly–polar bear hybrid (known as a "pizzly bear" or "grolar bear") is a rare <a href="ursid%20hybrid">ursid hybrid</a> resulting from a union of a brown bear and a <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a>. It has occurred both in captivity and in the wild. In 2006, the occurrence of this hybrid in nature was confirmed by testing the <a href="DNA">DNA</a> of a strange-looking bear that had been shot in the <a href="Canada">Canadian</a> <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a>. Previously, the hybrid had been produced in <a href="zoo">zoo</a>s, and was considered a "<a href="Cryptozoology">cryptid</a>" (a hypothesized animal for which there is no scientific proof of existence in the wild).

Analyses of the genomes of bears have recovered multiple instances of introgressive hybridization between various bear species, including introgression of polar bear DNA intro brown bears during the Pleistocene.

Brown bears are often not fully brown. Brown bears have long, thick fur, with a moderately long mane at the back of the neck which varies somewhat across the races. In India, brown bears can be reddish with silver tips, while in China, brown bears are bicolored with a yellow-brown or whitish cape across the neck, chest, and shoulders. North American grizzlies can be dark brown (almost black) to cream (almost white) or yellowish brown and often have darker colored legs. The common name grizzly stems from their typical coloration, with the hairs on their back usually being brownish-black at the base and whitish-cream at the tips, giving them their distinctive "grizzled" color. The winter fur is very thick and long, especially in northern subspecies, and can reach at the <a href="withers">withers</a>. The winter hairs are thin, yet rough to the touch. The summer fur is much shorter and sparser, and its length and density varies geographically.

Brown bears have very large and curved claws, those present on the forelimbs being longer than those on the hind limbs. They may reach and may measure along the curve. They are generally dark with a light tip, with some forms having completely light claws. Brown bear claws are longer and straighter than those of <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a>s ("Ursus americanus"). The claws are blunt, while those of a black bear are sharp. Due to their claw structure, in addition to their excessive weight, adult brown bears cannot typically climb trees as can both species of black bear, although in rare cases adult female brown bears have been seen in trees. The claws of a polar bear are also quite different, being notably shorter but broader with a strong curve and sharper point, presumably both as an aid to traveling over ice (sometimes nearly vertically) and procuring active prey. The paws of the brown bear are quite large. The rear feet of adult bears have been found to typically measure long, while the forefeet tend to measure about 40% less in length. All four feet in average sized brown bears tend to be about in width. In large coastal or Kodiak bear males, the hindfoot may measure up to in length, in width, while outsized Kodiak bears having had confirmed measurements of up to along their rear foot. Brown bears are the only extant bears with a hump at the top of their shoulder, which are made entirely of muscle, this feature having developed presumably for imparting more force in digging, which is habitual during foraging for most bears of the species and also used heavily in den construction prior to hibernation.

Adults have massive, heavily built <a href="wikt%3Aconcave">concave</a> skulls, which are large in proportion to the body. The forehead is high and rises steeply. The projections of the skull are well developed when compared to those of <a href="Asian%20black%20bear">Asian black bear</a>s ("Ursus thibetanus"): the latter have <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a>s not exceeding more than 19–20% of the total length of the skull, while the former have sagittal crests comprising up to 40–41% of the skull's length. Skull projections are more weakly developed in females than in males. The <a href="braincase">braincase</a> is relatively small and elongated. There is a great deal of geographical variation in the skull, and presents itself chiefly in dimensions. Grizzlies, for example, tend to have flatter profiles than European and coastal American brown bears. Skull lengths of Russian bears tend to be for males, and for females. The width of the <a href="zygomatic%20arch">zygomatic arch</a>es in males is , and in females. Brown bears have very strong teeth: the <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s are relatively big and the <a href="canine%20teeth">canine teeth</a> are large, the lower ones being strongly curved. The first three molars of the upper jaw are underdeveloped and single crowned with one root. The second upper molar is smaller than the others, and is usually absent in adults. It is usually lost at an early age, leaving no trace of the alveolus in the jaw. The first three molars of the lower jaw are very weak, and are often lost at an early age. The teeth of brown bears reflect their dietary plasticity and are broadly similar to other bears excluding the two most herbivorous living bears, the <a href="giant%20panda">giant panda</a> ("Ailuropoda melanoleuca") and <a href="spectacled%20bear">spectacled bear</a> ("Tremarctos ornatus"), which have blunt, small premolars (ideal for grinding down fibrous plants) compared to the jagged premolars of ursid bears that at least seasonally often rely on flesh as a food source. The teeth are reliably larger than <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a>s but average smaller in molar length than <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a>s. Brown bears have the broadest skull of any extant ursine bear, only the afforementioned most herbivorous living bears exceed them in relative breadth of the skull. Another extant ursine bear, the <a href="sloth%20bear">sloth bear</a> ("Melursus ursinus"), has a proportionately longer skull than the brown bear and can match the skull length of even large brown bear races, presumably as an aid for foraging heavily on insect colonies for which a long muzzle is helpful as an evolved feature in several unrelated mammalian groups.

The size of brown bears is the most variable of modern bears. The typical size depends upon which population it is from, and most accepted races vary widely in size. This is in part due to <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, as male brown bears average at least 30% larger in most races. Individual bears also vary in size seasonally, weighing the least in spring due to lack of foraging during hibernation, and the most in late fall, after a period of hyperphagia to put on additional weight to prepare for hibernation. Therefore, a bear may need to be weighed in both spring and fall to get an idea of its mean annual weight.

The normal range of physical dimensions for a brown bear is a head-and-body length of and a shoulder height of . The tail is relatively short, as in all bears, ranging from in length. The smallest brown bears, females during spring among barren-ground populations, can weigh so little as to roughly match the body mass of males of the smallest living bear species, the <a href="sun%20bear">sun bear</a> ("Helarctos malayanus"), while the largest coastal races attain sizes broadly similar to those of the largest living bear species, the <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a>. Interior brown bears are generally smaller than is often perceived, being around the same weight as an average <a href="Southern%20Africa">Southern Africa</a>n <a href="lion">lion</a> (<a href="Kalahari%20lion">Kalahari</a>, <a href="Southwest%20African%20lion">Katanga</a> or <a href="Transvaal%20lion">Transvaal lion</a>), at an estimate average of in males and in females, whereas adults of the coastal races weigh about twice as much. The average weight of adult male bears from 19 populations, from around the world and various subspecies (including both large and small bodied subspecies), was found to while adult females from 24 populations were found to average .

Brown bear size, most often measured in body mass, is highly variable and is correlated to extent of food access. Therefore, bears who range in ecozones that include have access to openings, cover and moisture or water tend to average larger whereas those bears that range into ecozones with enclosed forested areas or arid, sparsely vegetated regions, both of which tend to be sub-optimal foraging habitat for brown bears, average smaller. The brown bear in northern Europe (i.e. <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, <a href="eastern%20Europe">eastern Europe</a>, <a href="western%20Russia">western Russia</a>), <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> or interior <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> seasonally weigh on average between , from mean low adult female weights in spring to male bear mean high weights in fall. Bears from the <a href="Yukon%20Delta">Yukon Delta</a>, interior <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, <a href="Jasper%20National%20Park">Jasper National Park</a> and southern Europe (i.e. <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a>) can weigh from on average. These mass variations represent only two widespread subspecies, the <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a> in North America, and the <a href="Eurasian%20brown%20bear">Eurasian brown bear</a> in Europe. Due to the lack of genetic variation within subspecies, the environmental conditions in a given area likely plays the largest part in such weight variations.

The grizzly is especially variable in size, as grizzlies from the largest populations, i.e. interior <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, with the heaviest weights recorded in <a href="Nelchina">Nelchina</a>, <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, nearly three times heavier in males than the smallest grizzlies from <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>'s <a href="Jasper%20National%20Park">Jasper National Park</a>. Between the sexes, the grizzlies of Nelchina average around , whereas the Jasper grizzlies averaged about . The enclosed <a href="taiga">taiga</a> habitat of Jasper presumably is sub-optimal foraging habitat for grizzlies, requiring them to range widely and feed sparsely, thus reducing body weights and putting bears at risk of starvation, while in surfaces areas in the <a href="tundra">tundra</a> and <a href="prairie">prairie</a> are apparently ideal for feeding. Even elsewhere in the <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a> province, weights averaging more than twice those of Jasper grizzlies have been recorded. A gradual diminishment in body size is noted in grizzly bears from the <a href="sub-Arctic">sub-Arctic</a> zone, from the <a href="Brooks%20Range">Brooks Range</a> to the <a href="Mackenzie%20Mountains">Mackenzie Mountains</a>, presumably because food becomes much sparser in such regions, although perhaps the most northerly recorded grizzly bears ever, in the <a href="Northwest%20Territories">Northwest Territories</a>, was a large and healthy male weighing , more than twice as much as an average male weighs near the Arctic Circle. Data from Eurasia similarly indicates a diminished body mass in sub-Arctic brown bears, based on the weights of bears from northern <a href="Finland">Finland</a> and <a href="Yakutia">Yakutia</a>.

Head-and-body length in grizzly bears averages from while in Eurasian brown bears it similarly averages from . Adult shoulder height averaged in <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Yellowstone</a> (for any bear measured five or more years old) and a median of (for adults only 10 or more years old) in <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>. Standing on its hindlegs, a posture only assumed occasionally, typically sized brown bears can reportedly range from in standing height. Exceptionally large inland specimens have been reported in several parts of North America, Europe, Russia and even Hokkaido. The largest recorded grizzlies from <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Yellowstone</a> and <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington state</a> both weighed approximately and eastern European bears have been weighed in <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a> and <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> of up to , about double the average weight for male bears in these regions. Among the grizzly and Eurasian brown bear subspecies, the largest reportedly shot from each being and , respectively. The latter bear, from <a href="western%20Russia">western Russia</a>, reportedly measured just under in head-and-body length.
In <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, the size of bears roughly increases from the west to the east, with the largest bears there native to eastern <a href="Russia">Russia</a>. Even in the <a href="Eurasian%20brown%20bear">nominate subspecies</a> size increases in the eastern limits, with mature male bears in <a href="Arkhangelsk%20Oblast">Arkhangelsk Oblast</a> and <a href="Bashkortostan">Bashkortostan</a> commonly exceeding . Other bears of intermediate size may occur in inland races of <a href="Russia">Russia</a>. Much like the grizzly and Eurasian brown bear, populations of the <a href="Ussuri%20brown%20bear">Ussuri brown bear</a> ("U. a. lasiotus") and the <a href="East%20Siberian%20brown%20bear">East Siberian brown bear</a> ("U. a. collaris") may vary widely in size. In some cases, the big adult males of these races may have matched the Kodiak bear in size. <a href="East%20Siberian%20brown%20bear">East Siberian brown bear</a>s from outside the sub-Arctic and mainland <a href="Ussuri%20brown%20bear">Ussuri brown bear</a>s average about the same size as the largest-bodied populations of grizzly bear, i.e. those of similar latitude in Alaska, and have been credited with weights ranging from throughout the seasons. On the other hand, the <a href="Ussuri%20brown%20bear">Ussuri brown bear</a>s found in the insular population of <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> are usually quite small, usually weighing less than , exactly half the weight reported for male Ussuri brown bears from <a href="Khabarovsk%20Krai">Khabarovsk Krai</a>. This is due presumably to the enclosed mixed forest habitat of <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a>. A similarly diminished size has been reported in <a href="east%20Siberian%20brown%20bear">east Siberian brown bear</a>s from <a href="Yakutia">Yakutia</a>, as even adult males average around , thus about 40% less than the average weight of male bears of this race from <a href="Siberian%20Federal%20District">central Siberia</a> and the <a href="Chukchi%20Peninsula">Chukchi Peninsula</a>.

In linear measurements and mean body mass, several subspecies may vie for the title of smallest race, although thus far their reported body masses broadly overlaps with those of the smaller-bodied populations of Eurasian brown and grizzly bears. Leopold (1959) described the now extinct <a href="Mexican%20grizzly">Mexican grizzly</a> that, according to Rausch (1963), as the smallest race of grizzly bear in North America although the exact parameters of its body size are not known today. Bears from the <a href="Syrian%20brown%20bear">Syrian</a> ("U. a. syriacus") subspecies will reportedly weigh around in adulthood. The <a href="Himalayan%20brown%20bear">Himalayan race</a> ("U. a. isabellinus") is another rival for smallest subspecies, in <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> this race averages about in females and in males. Himalayan brown bear females were cited with an average head-and-body length of merely . Brown bears of the compact <a href="Gobi%20bear">Gobi Desert</a> population, which is not usually listed as a distinct subspecies in recent decades, weigh around between the sexes so are similar in weight to bears from the Himalayas and even heavier than grizzlies from <a href="Jasper%20National%20Park">Jasper National Park</a>. However, the Gobi bear has been reported to measure as small as in head-and-body length, which if accurate would make them the smallest known brown bear in linear dimensions. These smallest brown bear races are characteristically found in "barren ground" type habitats, i.e. <a href="Semi-arid%20climate">sub-desert</a> in bears from the Syrian and Gobi races and <a href="Alpine%20tundra">arid alpine meadow</a> in Himalayan bears.
The largest subspecies are the <a href="Kodiak%20bear">Kodiak bear</a> ("U. a. middendorffi") and the questionably distinct <a href="Alaska%20Peninsula%20brown%20bear">peninsular or coastal brown bear</a> ("U. a. gyas"). Also the extinct <a href="California%20grizzly">California grizzly</a> ("U. a. californicus") was rather large. Once mature, the typical female Kodiak bear can range in body mass from and while from sexual maturity onward male ranges from . According to <a href="Guinness%20Book%20of%20World%20Records">Guinness Records</a> the average male Kodiak bear is in total length (head-to-tail) and has a shoulder height of . When averaged between their spring low and fall high weights from both localities, males from Kodiak island and coastal Alaska weighed from with a mean body mass of while the same figures in females were with a mean body mass of . By the time they reach or exceed eight to nine years of age, male Kodiak bears tend to be much larger than newly mature 6-year-old males, potentially tripling their average weight within three years’ time, and can expect to average between . The reported mean adult body masses for both sexes of <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a> are very similar to the peninsular and Kodiak bears. Due to their roughly corresponding body sizes, the two races and the species can both legitimately be considered the largest living member of the bear family <a href="Ursidae">Ursidae</a> and largest extant terrestrial carnivores.

The largest variety of brown bear from Eurasia is the <a href="Kamchatka%20brown%20bear">Kamchatka brown bear</a> ("U. a. beringianus"). In the <a href="Kamchatka%20brown%20bear">Kamchatka brown bear</a> in past decades, old males have been known to reach body mass of by fall, putting the race well within Kodiak bear sizes and leading it to be considered the largest of the extant Russian races. However, a diminishment in body size of "U.a. berigianus" has been noted, mostly likely in correlation with overhunting. In the 1960s and 1970s, most adult Kamchatka brown bears weighed merely between , however mean weights of mature male bears has been reported as averaging in 2005.

Brown bears were once native to much of <a href="Asia">Asia</a>, some parts of the <a href="Atlas%20Mountains">Atlas Mountains</a> of <a href="Africa">Africa</a> and perhaps most of <a href="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, but are now <a href="extinct">extinct</a> in some areas, and their populations have greatly decreased in other areas. There are approximately 200,000 brown bears left in the world. The largest populations are in Russia with 120,000, the United States with 32,500, and Canada with around 25,000.The brown bear currently occurs in the countries of <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, <a href="Albania">Albania</a>, <a href="Andorra">Andorra</a> (recently reoccupied), <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>, <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>, <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a> (possibly extinct), <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="China">China</a>, <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a> (possibly only vagrants), <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a>, <a href="Finland">Finland</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a>, <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="India">India</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a>, <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a> (extinct before World War II; possibly vagrants from Estonia or Russia after World War II), <a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a>, <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>, <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="Romania">Romania</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>, <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>, <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, <a href="Tajikistan">Tajikistan</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a>, <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, and <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>.

The brown bear is usually called the grizzly bear in North America. It once ranged throughout much of the continent.

As many as 20,000 brown bears range throughout the <a href="Yukon">Yukon</a>, <a href="Northwest%20Territories">Northwest Territories</a>, and <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, and in the majority of <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>. Canada has one of the most stable brown bear populations today. They reach their current eastern limits of their distribution in North America in a majority of <a href="Nunavut">Nunavut</a>, northeastern <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> and northern <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>, where they range as far east as the west coast of the <a href="Hudson%20Bay">Hudson Bay</a> from around <a href="Rankin%20Inlet">Rankin Inlet</a> south to <a href="Southern%20Indian%20Lake">Southern Indian Lake</a>.

The brown bear has lost 98% of its habitat in the lower 48 states. About 95% of the brown bear population in the United States is in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, though in the lower 48 states, they are repopulating gradually but steadily along the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rockies</a> and the western <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a>. The Alaskan population is estimated at 32,000 individuals. The largest populations of brown bears in the lower 48 states are found in the 23,300-km2 <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem</a> and the 24,800-km2 Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem. The <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem</a> of northwest <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> is estimated to hold about 674–839 grizzly bears, followed slightly the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem of northwest <a href="Montana">Montana</a> with about 765 animals, the Cabinet-Yaak Ecosystem of northwest Montana and northeast <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> with about 42-65 bears of the species, the Selkirk Ecosystem of northeast <a href="Washington%20state">Washington</a> and northwest Idaho with only about 40–50 animals and even less the North Cascades Ecosystem of northcentral Washington with about 5–10 grizzlies. These five ecosystems combine for a total of a maximum 1,729 wild grizzlies still persisting in the contiguous United States. Unfortunately, these populations are isolated from each other, inhibiting any genetic flow between ecosystems and creating low genetic diversity in remaining populations which can have negative long-time effects. This isolation poses one of the greatest threats to the future survival of the grizzly bear in the contiguous United States. Although there is no record of their existence in the United States east of the Rocky Mountain and Great Plain regions in human history, fossil records from <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> and the <a href="Ungava%20Peninsula">Ungava Peninsula</a> do in fact show that grizzly bears once roamed in eastern North America.

Although many people hold the belief some brown bears may be present in <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> they are almost certainly extinct. The last Mexican grizzly bear was shot in 1976. None had been seen since 1960 prior.

In <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, there are 14,000 brown bears in ten fragmented populations. They are extinct in the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>, extremely threatened in France and Spain, and in trouble over most of <a href="Central%20Europe">Central Europe</a>.

Brown bears reach their western limits in <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. In the <a href="Cantabrian%20mountains">Cantabrian mountains</a> of northwest Spain, some 210 bears were found to dwell in <a href="Asturias">Asturias</a>, <a href="Cantabria">Cantabria</a>, <a href="Galicia%20%28Spain%29">Galicia</a> and <a href="Province%20of%20Le%C3%B3n">León</a>, in the <a href="Picos%20de%20Europa">Picos de Europa</a> and adjacent areas in 2013. As of 2015, this population was estimated at around 250 individuals, but only due it being a more extensive survey and their numbers may be declining rather than increasing. However the population of brown bears in the Pyrenees mountains, in a range shared between <a href="France">France</a>, Spain and <a href="Andorra">Andorra</a>, is much lower, estimated at 14 to 25, with a shortage of breeding females. Their rarity in this area has led biologists to release bears, mostly female, from <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a> in spring 2006 to reduce the imbalance and preserve the species' presence in the area. The bears were released despite protests from French farmers. By 2017 the bears in the Pyrenean region had increased to 39 including 10 cubs.

A small population of brown bears (formerly assigned to the race "<a href="Ursus%20arctos%20marsicanus">Ursus arctos marsicanus</a>" which is now considered part of the nominate race) still lives in central Italy (<a href="Apennine%20Mountains">Apennine Mountains</a>, <a href="Abruzzo">Abruzzo</a> and <a href="Latium">Latium</a>), with no more than 70 individuals, protected by strong laws, but endangered by the human presence in the area.

In eastern and northern Europe, the range of brown bear currently extends more broadly. Among the most populous countries for brown bears in the eastern region are <a href="Romania">Romania</a> which has approximately 4,000–5,000 brown bears, <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> with 900–1,200, <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a> at about 600–800 bears, <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a> at approximately 500–700 animals and Greece holds about 200 animals in the south. The Carpathian brown bear population of <a href="Romania">Romania</a> is the largest in Europe outside of Russia. Despite the relatively large size of the country's bear population, the species’ numbers there were declining alarmingly due to overhunting before Romania's EU membership (which also depended on the protection of the brown bear in the country). In July 2017 the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Environment%20and%20Climate%20Change%20%28Romania%29">Romanian Ministry of Environment</a> released an order for the hunting of 175 bears that year because of either increasing bear population or changes in animal behavior because of destruction of habitat by deforestation causing an increase in attacks on humans and damage caused by bears to local communities. There is also a smaller brown bear population in the Carpathian Mountains in <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> (estimated at about 200 in 2005), Slovakia and <a href="Poland">Poland</a> (estimated at about 100 in 2009 in the latter country). The total Carpathian population is estimated at about 8,000.

<a href="Northern%20Europe">Northern Europe</a> is home to a large bear population, with an estimated 2,500 (range 2,350–2,900) in Sweden, about 1,600 in Finland, about 700 in <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a> and 70 in <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, totaling to nearly 5,000 individuals in the wild. Another large and relatively stable population of brown bears in Europe, consisting of 2,500–3,000 individuals, is the Dinaric-Pindos (Balkans) population, with contiguous distribution in northeast <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>, <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a>, <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>, <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Macedonia</a>, <a href="Albania">Albania</a>, <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> and <a href="Greece">Greece</a>. Brown bears inhabited the mountains of <a href="Austria">Austria</a> until as recently as 2011, after a reintroduction effort failed and the species became extinct again. There is currently no effort to reintroduce the species into Austria. The entire alpine population of brown bears includes about 50 individuals, most of them living in the <a href="Adamello-Presanella%20Alps">Adamello Brento nature park</a> in <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. Reintroduction of 10 Slovenian brown bears to the <a href="Trentino">Trentino</a> area in 1998 and 2002 produced occasional visitors to the <a href="South%20Tirol">South Tirol</a>, the Swiss <a href="Geography%20of%20the%20Alps">Eastern Alp</a>s, <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> and isolated sightings in the <a href="Geography%20of%20the%20Alps">Central Alp</a>s. The small group of bears living in the <a href="Carinthian-Slovenian%20Alps">Slovenian Alps</a> is connected to the larger Dinaric-Pindos population.

In this part of the world, the brown bear occurs from <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a>, <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> and <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a> southbound spottily through <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, northernmost <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, western and northern <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, thence discontinuously in northeastern <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, southeastern <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a> and north to <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a>. The populations in these countries are generally very small and fragmented, thus at high risk of genetic isolation, and they occupy only small segments of their former range here. At least 20-30 were present in northern Iran as of 2015.

In Asia, brown bears are found in nearly every part of <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, thence to the southeast in a small area of <a href="Northeast%20China">Northeast China</a>, <a href="western%20China">western China</a>, and parts of <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>. Further west, they reach the southern limits of their worldwide distribution, dwelling spottily in northern <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and the northernmost point of <a href="India">India</a>, i.e. <a href="Jammu%20and%20Kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir</a>. They possibly persist in northern <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>, northern <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a> and northern <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> but are not confirmed residents today in these nations.

Three distinct lineages of the Hokkaido brown bear ("Ursus arctos yesoensis L.") can also be found on the <a href="Japan">Japan</a>ese island of <a href="Hokkaid%C5%8D">Hokkaidō</a>. Hokkaido has the largest number of non-Russian brown bears in eastern Asia with about 2,000–3,000 animals, although, in 2015, the Biodiversity Division of the Hokkaido government estimated the population as being as high as 10,600.

Many people hold the belief some brown bears may be present in the <a href="Atlas%20Mountains">Atlas Mountains</a> of <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> but there have been none sighted in the last century. In addition to the native <a href="Atlas%20bear">Atlas bear</a> the Romans apparently imported bears from Spain for spectacles with some escaping and founding a population in Africa, though it is doubtful that they still persist today.

This species inhabits the broadest range of habitats of any living bear species. They seem to have no altitudinal preferences and have been recorded from sea-level to an elevation of (the latter in the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>). In most of their range, brown bears generally seems to prefer semiopen country, with a scattering of vegetation that can allow them a resting spot during the day. However, they have been recorded as inhabiting every variety of northern <a href="temperate%20forest">temperate forest</a> known to occur. North American brown bears, or <a href="grizzly%20bears">grizzly bears</a>, generally seem to prefer open or semi-open landscapes, with the species once having been common on the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a> and continues to occur in sizeable numbers in <a href="tundra">tundra</a> and <a href="Estuary">coastal estuaries</a> and <a href="island">island</a>s. Variable numbers still occur in <a href="prairie">prairie</a> areas of the northern <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> (mostly in Canada but some in the contiguous United States). Where continuous and protected, such as the <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem</a>, the prairie is near ideal interior habitat for the species.

In western Eurasia, they inhabit mostly mountainous woodlands, in ranges such as the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>, the Pyrenees and the <a href="Caucasus%20Mountains">Caucasus</a>, though they may have been driven into more wooded, precipitous habitats due to the prior extensive persecution of the species in some regions.

In <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>, human disturbances are minimal as this area has a harsher environment and is more sparsely populated. In this part of the world, bears may be found in <a href="steppe">steppe</a>, which is sparser and more desert-like than grassland habitats in North America that occur at similar latitudes, and some bears may live out their lives even in <a href="Desert">desert edge</a>, such as those that live in the Middle East (<a href="Syrian%20brown%20bear">Syrian bears</a>) and the rare <a href="Gobi%20bear">Gobi bear</a> which is native only to the Chinese-Mongolian <a href="Gobi%20desert">desert of its name</a> and isolated from other populations. <a href="Alpine%20tundra">Alpine meadows</a> are the typical habitat in the Himalayan and Tibetan populations of brown bear. In <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, the species seems well-adapted to living in almost all parts of the extensive <a href="Taiga">pine forests</a>, usually coming to waterways or poorly drained openings and bogs while feeding and sheltering in broad roots and trunks in the interior. Eastern Russian forests hold arguably the largest number of brown bears in the world outside of possibly Alaska and northwestern Canada. The brown bears of <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> are also largely forest dwelling, but dwell in <a href="Temperate%20broadleaf%20and%20mixed%20forest">mixed forests dominated by broadleaf trees</a> such as <a href="beech">beech</a>.

It is thought the Eurasian bears which colonized America were <a href="tundra">tundra</a>-adapted (as are many grizzlies are today in North America) and the species is sometimes found around sub-Arctic <a href="ice%20field">ice field</a>s. This is indicated by brown bears in the <a href="Chukotka%20Peninsula">Chukotka Peninsula</a> on the Asian side of <a href="Bering%20Strait">Bering Strait</a>, which are the only Asian brown bears to live year-round in lowland tundra like their North American cousins. Genetics relay that two separate radiations led to today's North American brown bears one a coastal form that lead to <a href="Kodiak%20bear">Kodiak bear</a> (from "U. a. beringianus" or a common ancestor) and one an interior form that lead to the <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a> (from "U. a. lasiotus" or a common ancestor). In <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> areas, the potential habitat of the brown bear is increasing. The <a href="global%20warming">warming of that region</a> has allowed the species to move farther north into what was once exclusively the domain of the <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a> (potentially another offshoot of a radiation of coastal brown bears). In non-Arctic areas, habitat loss is blamed as the leading cause of endangerment, followed by hunting.

While the brown bear's range has shrunk and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> species by the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> with a total population of approximately 200,000. As of 2012, this and the <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a> are the only bear species not classified as threatened by the IUCN. However, the <a href="California%20golden%20bear">Californian</a>, <a href="Atlas%20bear">North African (Atlas bear)</a>, and <a href="Mexican%20grizzly%20bear">Mexican</a> subspecies, as well as brown bear populations in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> were hunted to extinction in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and many of the southern Asian subspecies are highly endangered. The <a href="Syrian%20brown%20bear">Syrian brown bear</a> ("Ursus arctos syriacus") is very rare and it has been extirpated from more than half of its historic range. One of the smallest-bodied subspecies, the <a href="Himalayan%20brown%20bear">Himalayan brown bear</a>, is critically endangered, occupying only 2% of its former range and threatened by uncontrolled poaching for its parts. The <a href="Marsican%20brown%20bear">Marsican brown bear</a> in central <a href="Italy">Italy</a> is believed to have a population of just 30 to 40 bears.

The brown bear is <a href="extinct">extinct</a> in: <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, Belgium, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>; <a href="Germany">Germany</a>; <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a>; <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="Israel">Israel</a>; <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a>, <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>; <a href="Liechtenstein">Liechtenstein</a>; <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>, <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>, <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>; <a href="Moldova">Moldova</a>; <a href="Monaco">Monaco</a>, <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>; <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>; <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>; <a href="San%20Marino">San Marino</a>; <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>; <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="Vatican%20City">Vatican</a> and possibly extinct in <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>.

The brown bear is often described as <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a>. However, it frequently seems to peak in activity in the morning and early evening hours.<ref name="Brown / Grizzly Bear Facts"></ref> Studies have shown that activity throughout the range can occur at nearly any time of night or day, with bears who dwell in areas with more extensive human contact being more likely to be fully nocturnal. Furthermore, yearling and newly independent bears are more likely to be active diurnally and many adult bears in low-disturbance areas are largely <a href="crepuscular">crepuscular</a>. In summer through autumn, a brown bear can double its weight from the spring, gaining up to of <a href="fat">fat</a>, on which it relies to make it through winter, when it becomes very lethargic. Although they are not full <a href="hibernation">hibernators</a> and can be woken easily, both sexes like to <a href="maternity%20den">den</a> in a protected spot during the winter months. Hibernation dens may consist of any spot that provides cover from the elements and that can accommodate their bodies, such as a <a href="cave">cave</a>, crevice, cavernous tree roots, or hollow logs.

Brown bears have one of the largest brains of any extant carnivoran relative to their body size and have been shown to engage in tool-use (e.g. using a barnacle-covered rock to scratch its neck), which requires advanced cognitive abilities. This species is mostly solitary, although bears may gather in large numbers at major food sources (e.g., <a href="moth">moth</a> colonies, open garbage dumps or rivers holding spawning <a href="salmon">salmon</a>) and form social hierarchies based on age and size. Adult male bears are particularly aggressive and are avoided by adolescent and subadult males both at concentrated feeding opportunities and chance encounters. Female bears with cubs rival adult males in aggression, and are much more intolerant of other bears than single females. Young adolescent males tend to be least aggressive, and have been observed in nonantagonistic interactions with each other. <a href="Dominance%20%28ethology%29">Dominance</a> between bears is asserted by making a frontal orientation, showing off canines, muzzle twisting and neck stretching to which a subordinate will respond with a lateral orientation, by turning away and dropping the head and by sitting or lying down. During combat, bears use their paws to strike their opponents in the chest or shoulders and bite the head or neck. In his "Great Bear Almanac", Gary Brown lists 11 different sounds bears produce in 9 different contexts. Sounds expressing anger or aggravation include growls, roars, woofs, champs and smacks, while sounds expressing nervousness or pain include woofs, grunts, and bawls. Sows will bleat or hum when communicating with their cubs.

Brown bears usually occur over vast home ranges, however they are not highly territorial. Several adult bears often roam freely over the same vicinity without issue unless rights to a fertile female or food sources are being contested. Males always cover more area than females each year. Despite their lack of traditional territorial behavior, adult males can seem to have a "personal zone" in which other bears are not tolerated if they are seen. Males always wander further than females due to both increasing access to females and food sources while females are advantaged by smaller territories in part since it decreases the likelihood of encounters with male bears who may endanger their cubs. In areas where food is abundant and concentrated, such as coastal Alaska, home ranges for females are up to and for males are up to . Similarly, in <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, bears of the two sexes travel relatively compact home ranges of and . In <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>, home ranges for females are up to and up to for males. In the central Arctic of Canada, where food sources are quite sparse, home ranges range up to in females and in males.

A study of male-inherited <a href="Y%20chromosome">Y chromosome</a> <a href="DNA">DNA</a> sequence found that brown bears, over the past few 10,000 years, have shown strong <a href="Inbreeding%20avoidance">male-biased dispersal</a> That study found surprisingly similar Y chromosomes in brown bear populations as far apart as Norway and coastal Alaska, indicating extensive <a href="gene%20flow">gene flow</a> across <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> and <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. Notably, this contrasts with genetic signals from female-inherited <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> (mtDNA), where brown bears of different geographic regions typically show strong differences in their mtDNA, a result of female <a href="philopatry">philopatry</a>.

The <a href="mating%20season">mating season</a> is from mid-May to early July, shifting later the further north the bears are found. Being <a href="serially%20monogamous">serially monogamous</a>, brown bears remain with the same mate from a couple of days to a couple of weeks. Outside of this narrow time frame, adult male and female brown bears show no sexual interest in each other. Females mature sexually between the age of 4 and 8 years of age, with an average age at sexual maturity of 5.2-5.5 years old, while males first mate about a year later on average, when they are large and strong enough to successfully compete with other males for mating rights. Males will try to mate with as many females as they can, usually a successful one mates with two females in a span of one to three weeks. The adult female brown bear is similarly promiscuous, mating with up to four, rarely even eight, males while in heat and potentially breeding with two males in a single day. Females come into oestrus on average every three to four years, with a full range of 2.4 to 5.7 years. The urine markings of a female in oestrus can attract several males via scent. Paternity DNA tests have shown that up to 29% of cubs in a litter will be from two to three different males. Dominant males may try to sequester a female for her entire oestrus period of approximately two weeks but usually are unable to retain her for the entire time. Copulation is vigorous and prolonged and can last up to an hour, although the mean time is about 23–24 minutes.
Males take no part in raising their cubs – parenting is left entirely to the females. Through the process of <a href="delayed%20implantation">delayed implantation</a>, a female's fertilized egg divides and floats freely in the uterus for six months. During winter dormancy, the fetus attaches to the <a href="uterus">uterine</a> wall. The cubs are born eight weeks later, while the mother sleeps. If the mother does not gain enough weight to survive through the winter, the embryo does not implant and is reabsorbed into the body. There have been cases of bears with as many as six cubs, although the average litter size is 1-3, with more than four being considered uncommon. There are records of females sometimes adopting stray cubs or even trading or kidnapping cubs when they emerge from hibernation (a larger female may claim cubs away from a smaller one). Older and larger females within a population tend to give birth to larger litters The size of a litter also depends on factors such as geographic location and food supply. At birth, the cubs are blind, toothless, hairless, and may weigh from , again reportedly based on the age and condition of the mother. They feed on their mother's milk until spring or even early summer, depending on climate conditions. At this time, the cubs weigh and have developed enough to follow her over long distances and begin to forage for solid food.
The cubs are fully dependent on the mother and a close bond is formed. During the dependency stage, the cubs learn (rather than inherit as instincts from birth) survival techniques, such as which foods have the highest nutritional value and where to obtain them; how to hunt, fish, and defend themselves; and where to den. Increased brain size in large carnivores has been positively linked to whether a given species is solitary, as is the brown bear, or raises their offspring communally, thus female brown bears have relatively large, well-developed brains presumably key in teaching behavior. The cubs learn by following and imitating their mother's actions during the period they are with her. Cubs remain with their mother for an average of 2.5 years in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, uncommonly being independent as early as 1.5 years of age or as late as 4.5 years of age. The stage at which independence is attained may generally be earlier in some parts of <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, as the latest date which mother cubs were together was 2.3 years and most families separated in under two years in a study from <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> and in <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> most cubs on their own were still yearlings. Brown bears practice <a href="infanticide%20%28zoology%29">infanticide</a>, as an adult male bear may kill the cubs of another bear. When adult male brown bears kill a cub it is usually because he is bringing the female into oestrus, as she will enter that state within 2–4 days after the death of her cubs. Cubs flee up a tree, if available, when they see a strange male bear, and the mother often successfully defends them, even though the male may be twice as heavy as she, although females have been known to lose their lives in these confrontations.

The brown bear is a naturally long-lived animal. Wild females have been observed reproducing up to 28 years of age, which is the oldest known age for reproduction of any <a href="bear">ursid</a> in the wild. The peak reproductive age for females ranges from 4 to 20 years old. The lifespan of brown bears of both sexes within minimally hunted populations is estimated at an average of 25 years. The oldest wild brown bear on record was nearly 37 years old. The oldest recorded female in captivity was nearly 40 years old, while males in captivity have been verified to live up to 47 years, with one captive male possibly attaining 50 years of age.

While male bears potentially live longer in captivity, female grizzly bears have a greater annual survival rate than males within wild populations per a study done in the <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem</a>. Annual mortality for bears of any age is estimated at around 10% in most protected areas; however, the average annual mortality rate rises to an estimated 38% in hunted populations. Around 13% to 44% of cubs die within their first year even in well-protected areas. Mortality rates of 75-100% among the cubs of any given year are not uncommon. Beyond predation by large predators including <a href="Gray%20wolf">wolves</a>, <a href="Siberian%20tiger">Siberian tiger</a>s ("Panthera tigris altaica") and other brown bears, starvation and accidents also claim the lives of cubs. Studies have indicated that the most prevalent source of mortality for first-year cubs is malnutrition. By the second and third years of their lives, the annual mortality rate among cubs in the care of their mothers drops to 10-15%.

Even in populations living in protected areas, humans are still the leading cause of mortality for brown bears. The largest amount of legalized brown bear hunting occurs in Canada, Finland, Russia, Slovakia and Alaska. Hunting is unregulated in many areas within the range of the brown bear. Even where hunting is legally permitted most biologists feel that the numbers hunted are excessive considering the low reproduction rate and sparse distribution of the species. Brown bears are also killed in collisions with automobiles, which is a significant cause of mortality in the United States and Europe.

The brown bear is one of the most <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a> animals in the world and has been recorded consuming the greatest variety of foods of any bear. Throughout life, this species is regularly curious about the potential of eating virtually any organism or object that they encounter. Certainly no other animal in their given ecosystems, short perhaps of other bear species and humans, can claim to feed on as broad a range of dietary opportunities. Food that is both abundant and easily obtained is preferred. Their jaw structure has evolved to fit their dietary habits. Their diet varies enormously throughout their differing areas based on opportunity. In spring, winter-provided carrion, grasses, shoots, sedges and forbs are the dietary mainstays for brown bears from almost every part of their distribution. Fruits, including berries, become increasingly important during summer and early autumn. Roots and bulbs become critical in autumn for some inland bear populations if fruit crops are poor. The dietary variability is illustrated in the western <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, as meat made up 51% of the average year-around diet for grizzly bears from <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a> while it made up only 11% of the year-around diet for grizzlies from <a href="Glacier%20National%20Park%20%28U.S.%29">Glacier National Park</a> a few hundred miles to the north.

Despite their reputation, most brown bears are not highly carnivorous, as they derive up to 90% of their dietary <a href="food%20energy">food energy</a> from vegetable matter. Brown bears often feed on a variety of plant life, including <a href="Berry">berries</a>, <a href="grass">grass</a>es, <a href="flower">flower</a>s, <a href="acorn">acorn</a>s ("Quercus" ssp.) and <a href="pine%20cone">pine cone</a>s as well as <a href="moss">moss</a>es and <a href="Fungus">fungi</a> such as <a href="mushroom">mushroom</a>s. In total, over 200 plant species have been identified in their foods. Arguably the most herbivorous diets have come from the warmer temperate parts of <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> as more than 90% of the diet may be herbivorous. These include countries and regions such as <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="Slovakia">Slovakia</a>, most of the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> including <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>, and presumably the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. In many inland portions of North America, the diet of grizzly bears is between 80 and 90% plant-based but animal meat can be much more important in some areas. It has been found that being restricted to a largely vegetarian diet puts constraints on the growth and size of bears who live off of them, largely because their digestive systems do not process plants as well as animal fats and proteins.

Among all living bears, brown bears are uniquely equipped to dig for tough foods such as <a href="root">root</a>s and <a href="shoot">shoot</a>s. They use their long, strong claws to dig out earth to reach the roots and their powerful jaws to bite through them. For the most part, the consumed plant life in spring, predominantly <a href="root">root</a>s immediately post-hibernation and <a href="Poaceae">grasses</a> later in spring, is not highly nutritious for bears and mainly staves off hunger and starvation until more nutritious food is available. Brown bears have difficulty digesting large quantities of tough, fibrous foods. <a href="Hedysarum">Hedysarum</a> roots are among the most commonly eaten foods from throughout the range and can become important substitutes if stable foods such as fruits become unavailable. <a href="Corm">Corm</a>s and <a href="bulb">bulb</a>s are important when available as they are one of the greater sources of protein in plant life as are <a href="Mast%20%28botany%29">hard masts</a> such as <a href="acorn">acorn</a>s. Brown bears are restricted in their access to hard masts compared to black bears because of the limited climbing abilities of grown bears and therefore are confined largely to masts fallen to the ground, pirated from other creatures or within a reach of about that the bears can stretch to with their paws extended and standing on their hindlegs. Hard masts can become the most important food (although consumed mainly in late summer and fall) where available in large quantities such as on <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a> and <a href="Spain">Spain</a>. One of the most important foods in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States is the <a href="Pinus%20albicaulis">Whitebark pine nut</a> ("Pinus albicaulis"), which is attained perhaps a majority of the time by raiding the once abundant caches of <a href="American%20red%20squirrel">American red squirrel</a>s ("Tamiasciurus hudsonicus") rather than direct foraging. The decline of whitebark pine nut due to the inadvertent introduction by man of the invasive, virulent fungi "<a href="Cronartium%20ribicola">Cronartium ribicola</a>" has in turn required grizzlies to seek alternate food sources, many of which are carnivorous. In a Greek food study, soft mast were found to outrank hard masts as a food source, with about a quarter of the year-around diet consisting of the <a href="legume">legume</a> "<a href="Medicago">Medicago</a>".
<a href="Fruit">Fruit</a>s and berries are indispensable for brown bears in most areas as a high-energy food stuff for bears which is necessary to survive the hibernation cycle. The variety of fruits consumed is high, with most of the well-known, wild fruiting plants in temperate North America and Eurasia attracting brown bears in late summer and fall. Among the most prominent fruits found in their foods from through the range include many "<a href="Prunus">Prunus</a>" species including <a href="prune">prune</a>s and <a href="Prunus%20avium">cherries</a>, <a href="crowberry">crowberries</a> ("Empetrum nigrum"), <a href="pear">pear</a>s ("Pyrus" ssp.), <a href="Malus">crabapple</a>s ("Malus" ssp.), <a href="Rubus%20fruticosus">bramble</a>s ("Rubus fruticosus"), <a href="Rubus%20idaeus">raspberries</a> ("Rubus idaeus"), <a href="Bearberry">bearberries</a> ("Arctostaphylos" ssp.) (reportedly named for bears’ fondness for them), <a href="Blueberry">blueberries</a> ("Vaccinium" ssp.), <a href="Vaccinium%20vitis-idaea">lingonberries</a> ("Vaccinium vitis-idaea") and <a href="Vaccinium%20parvifolium">huckleberries</a> ("Vaccinium parvifolium"). Fruit appears to become more secondary in the diet in areas where hard masts and animal protein are abundant in late summer and fall, as these more protein-rich foods appear to be more nutritious for bears than carbohydrate-rich fruits are, despite their fondness for fruit. Even where fruit are commonly eaten, other foods must be eaten to meet nutritional requirements. It is estimated that a small female brown bear may need to eat nearly 30,000 berries each day in late summer/fall in order to subsist on a purely fruit-based diet.

Brown bears will also commonly consume animal matter, which in summer and autumn may regularly be in the form of <a href="insect">insect</a>s, <a href="larvae">larvae</a> and <a href="Larva">grubs</a>, including <a href="beehive">beehive</a>s. Most insects eaten are of the highly social variety found in colonial nests, which provide a likely greater quantity of food, although they will also tear apart rotten logs on the forest floor, turn over rocks or simply dig in soft earth in attempts to consume individual invertebrates such as <a href="Hemiptera">bugs</a>, <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s and <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s. <a href="Honey%20bee">Honey bee</a>s and <a href="wasp">wasp</a>s are important supplemental foods in Eurasia from the furthest west of their range, in <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, to the furthest east, in <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a>. Bears in <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Yellowstone</a> and <a href="Montana">Montana</a> eat an enormous number of <a href="moth">moth</a>s during the summer, sometimes consuming as many as 40,000 <a href="Army%20cutworm">army cutworm moths</a> ("Euxoa auxiliaris") in a single day, and may derive up to half of their annual food energy from these insects. In <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, a variety of species of ants have been found to factor heavily into the diet in some areas such as <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> and <a href="eastern%20Europe">eastern Europe</a>. In <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>, for example, up to 25% of the dry mass consumed by bears was ants. Locally heavy consumption of ants has been reported in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> as well, as in west-central <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, 49% of scat contained ants. This species mainly feed on ants with a passive response to the colony being dug out and low levels of formic acid, therefore <a href="carpenter%20ant">carpenter ant</a>s ("Camponotus" ssp.), which are accessed through rotten logs rather than underground colonies, are preferred where available. Other important insect aggregations that brown bears feed heavily on in some regions include <a href="Coccinellidae">ladybirds</a> and <a href="caddisfly">caddisfly</a>. Brown bears living near coastal regions will regularly eat <a href="crab">crab</a>s and <a href="clam">clam</a>s. In Alaska's <a href="Katmai%20National%20Park%20and%20Preserve">Katmai National Park and Preserve</a>, bears along the beaches of estuaries regularly dig through the sand for <a href="soft-shell%20clam">soft-shell clam</a> ("Mya arenaria") and <a href="Pacific%20razor%20clam">Pacific razor clam</a> ("Siliqua patula"), providing a more nutritious source of dietary energy in spring than plant life before fish become available there. The zarigani ("<a href="Cambaroides%20japonicus">Cambaroides japonicus</a>"), a type of <a href="crayfish">crayfish</a>, of <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a> is also an important, protein-rich dietary supplement for bears there.

By far the closest dietary relationship between brown bears and fish occurs between the salmon and trout of the "<a href="Oncorhynchus">Oncorhynchus</a>" genus, particularly in coastal areas but also in some inland areas of <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. In the Kamchatka peninsula and several parts of coastal Alaska, including <a href="Kodiak%20Island">Kodiak Island</a>, brown bears feed largely on spawning <a href="salmon">salmon</a>, whose nutrition and abundance explain the enormous size of the bears in these areas. <a href="Sockeye%20salmon">Sockeye salmon</a> ("O. nerka") and <a href="pink%20salmon">pink salmon</a> ("O. gorbuscha") are the two most commonly predated, but many <a href="Coho%20salmon">coho</a> ("O. kisutch"), <a href="Chinook%20salmon">Chinook</a> ("O. tshawytscha"), <a href="Oncorhynchus%20masou">masu</a> ("O. masou") and <a href="chum%20salmon">chum salmon</a> ("O. keta") are also taken. Even in the coastal ranges of the Pacific, a diverse omnivorous diet is eaten, with the salmon spawning reliably providing food only in late summer and early fall. Exceptionally, salmon may come to inland rivers as early as June in the <a href="Katmai%20National%20Park%20and%20Preserve">Brooks River</a> when other coastal Alaskan bears are in their dietary "lean period" and provide food for bears sooner than normal. On Kodiak island, it appears the availability of alternate food sources is high, as berry crops are often profuse, marine organisms often wash up and ungulates both wild and domesticated are available. The fishing techniques of bears are well-documented. They often congregate around falls when the salmon are forced to breach the water, at which point the bears will try to catch the fish in mid-air (often with their mouths). They will also wade into shallow waters, hoping to pin a slippery salmon with their claws. While they may eat almost all the parts of the fish, bears at the peak of spawning, when there is usually a glut of fish to feed on, may eat only the most nutritious parts of the salmon (including the eggs and head) and then indifferently leave the rest of the carcass to scavengers, which can include <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>es ("Vulpes vulpes"), <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a>s ("Haliaeetus leucocephalus"), <a href="common%20raven">common raven</a>s ("Corvus corax") and <a href="gull">gull</a>s. Despite their normally solitary habits, Brown bears will gather rather closely in numbers at good spawning sites. The largest and most powerful males claim the most fruitful fishing spots and bears (especially males) will sometimes fight over the rights to a prime fishing spot. Despite their aggressive defensive abilities, female brown bears usually select sub-optimal fishing spots to avoid male bears that could potentially threaten their cubs.

One other key relationship occurs between brown bears and "Oncorhynchus" species occurs with the grizzly bear and the <a href="cutthroat%20trout">cutthroat trout</a> ("O. clarki") in the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rockies</a> such as around <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Yellowstone</a>. Here this species was consumed in considerable numbers although, like the whitebark pine nut, this food source has declined due to invasive species introduced by man, i.e. invasive trout which are outcompeting cutthroat trout. The now extinct <a href="California%20grizzly%20bear">California grizzly bear</a> was also a fairly specialized "Onocorhynchus" predator in California's mountain streams and rivers, principally of <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow trout</a> ("O. mykiss"). Outside of Pacific-based salmonids, predatory relationships between brown bears and fish are uncommon. Predation on <a href="broad%20whitefish">broad whitefish</a> ("Coregonus nasus") and <a href="longnose%20sucker">longnose sucker</a>s ("Catostomus catostomus") has been reported in sub-Arctic Canada and <a href="northern%20pike">northern pike</a> ("Esox lucius") and <a href="Grayling%20%28species%29">grayling</a> ("Thymallus thymallus") in Siberia, plus other older records of brown bears hunting miscellaneous freshwater fish in Eurasia.

Beyond the regular predation of salmon, most brown bears are not particularly active predators. Nonetheless, brown bears are capable of obtaining practically all forms of the mammals that they encounter: from mouse-like rodents to those as fearsome as a <a href="tiger">tiger</a> or as large as a <a href="bison">bison</a>. Over 100 species of mammal have been recorded either in the scats of brown bears or have been observed as being killed or consumed by the species, although much of this consumption probably represents merely scavenging on carrion.
A perhaps surprisingly high balance of mammalian foods consists of <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s or similar smallish <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s, as about half of the species consumed by brown bears weigh less than on average. These may include <a href="hare">hare</a>s ("Lepus" ssp.), <a href="pika">pika</a>s ("Ochotona" ssp.) <a href="marmot">marmot</a>s ("Marmota" ssp.), <a href="ground%20squirrel">ground squirrel</a>s, <a href="chipmunk">chipmunk</a>s, <a href="Mouse">mice</a>, <a href="rat">rat</a>s, <a href="lemming">lemming</a>s and <a href="vole">vole</a>s. Due to their propensity for digging, brown bears are able to smell out active subterranean burrows of these small mammals and either wait quietly or furiously dig away until the animals are either displaced and lunged at or are cornered in their burrows. Not only do they consume the small mammals, but they also feed on their caches, as has been recorded in grizzly bears attacking <a href="vole">vole</a>s and <a href="northern%20pocket%20gopher">northern pocket gopher</a>s ("Thomomys talpoides"). In some areas, caches may be the primary target when bears dig at these animal's burrows, as may be the case with <a href="Siberian%20chipmunk">Siberian chipmunk</a>s ("Eutamias sibiricus"), whose hoards can contain up to of food, with the chipmunks themselves only being caught occasionally. With particular regularity, tundra-dwelling grizzlies will wait at burrows of <a href="Arctic%20ground%20squirrel">Arctic ground squirrel</a>s ("Spermophilus parryii") hoping to pick off a few of the rodents. Ground squirrel hunting is most successful in September and October, when early snow may impede the rodents’ rocky escape routes. In <a href="Denali%20National%20Park">Denali National Park</a>, Arctic ground squirrels represent about 8% of the year-round diet of grizzly bears and are the most consistent source of animal protein for grizzlies there. An even more important dietary relationship with a small mammal occurs in the <a href="Tibetan%20blue%20bear">Tibetan blue bear</a>, which is apparently the most completely carnivorous brown bear race, foraging most regularly for <a href="plateau%20pika">plateau pika</a>s ("Ochotona curzoniae"), a species about one-sixth the weight of an Arctic ground squirrel. As many as 25 pikas have been found in a single bear's stomach and in <a href="Changtang">Changtang</a>, 60% of the diet consisted of pikas. Where plateau pikas are absent, as in the <a href="Upper%20Mustang">Mustang region</a> of <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>, <a href="Himalayan%20marmot">Himalayan marmot</a>s ("Marmota himalayana") become the dietary staple of the bear, occurring in about half of nearly a thousand scats. Large rodents such as <a href="beaver">beaver</a>s ("Castor" spp.) and <a href="North%20American%20porcupine">North American porcupine</a>s ("Erethizon dorsatum") are rare prey items, mostly due to differing habitat preferences, as well as the obvious defenses of the latter. Up to five species of <a href="cetacean">cetacean</a> have been recorded as a food source in the coastal regions of <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, the <a href="Central%20Arctic">Central Arctic</a> and (formerly) <a href="California">California</a> when beached.

In most of their range, brown bears regularly feed on ungulates. In many cases, this important food source is obtained as carrion. Carrion is mostly eaten in spring, when winter snow and ice conditions (including snow-slides) and starvation claim many ungulate lives. As carcasses are often solidly frozen when encountered, brown bears may sit on them to thaw them sufficiently for consumption. While perhaps a majority of bears of the species will charge at <a href="ungulates">ungulates</a> at some point in their lives, many predation attempts start with the bear clumsily and half-heartedly pursuing the prey, and end with the prey escaping alive. On the other hand, some brown bears are quite self-assured predators who habitually pursue and catch large prey items which are mainly ungulates. Such bears are usually taught how to hunt by their mothers from an early age. They are the most regular predator of ungulates among extant bear species. The extent of hunting behavior differs by region. For example, in <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>, ungulate meat was four times more likely to be obtained as carrion than through hunting, while on the contrary in east-central <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, live hunting of ungulates was four times more likely than scavenging of carrion. The extent of carnivory in brown bears has been proven to increase at northern latitudes. When brown bears attack these large animals, they usually target young or infirm ones, as they are easier to catch. Successful hunts usually occur after a short rush and ambush but they may chase down prey in the open and will try to separate mother and young. Prey is usually killed when the bear grabs the rib cage over the back and delivers a bite to the back of the head, neck, face or nose. The bear may also pin its prey (usually young) to the ground and then immediately tear and eat it alive. Despite being characterized as unskilled predators with minimally-refined hunting skills, most individual bears who are routine ungulate predators have shown the ability to vary their hunting strategy and have hunting success rates comparable to other large, solitary carnivorans. Brown bears will on occasion bite or swipe at some prey in order to stun it enough to knock it over for consumption. To pick out young or infirm individuals, bears will charge at herds so the slower-moving and more vulnerable individuals will be made apparent. Brown bears may also ambush young animals by finding them via scent. Despite being characterized as a danger primarily to young, spring neonatal ungulates in the first couple of days of life, when they have undeveloped legs and cannot run at full speed, young ungulates may be pursued well into summer or fall after they have developed running abilities. Most attacks on adult ungulates occur when the prey has some variety of physical disadvantage. When emerging from hibernation, brown bears, whose broad paws allow them to walk over most ice and snow, may pursue large prey such as moose, whose hooves cannot support them on encrusted snow. Similarly, predatory attacks on large prey sometimes occur at riverbeds, when it is more difficult for the prey specimen to run away due to muddy or slippery soil. On rare occasions, most importantly when confronting unusually large, fully-grown and dangerous prey, bears kill them by hitting with their powerful forearms, which can break the necks and backs of large creatures such as adult moose and adult bison.
The leading ungulate prey for brown bears is normally deer. Up to a dozen species have been eaten by brown bears but the main prey species are the larger species they encounter: <a href="elk">elk</a> ("Cervus canadensis"), <a href="moose">moose</a> ("Alces alces") and <a href="Caribou%20%28North%20America%29">caribou</a> ("Rangifer tarandus"). Larger deer are preferred because they tend to be less agile and swift than small or medium-sized deer (although a caribou can handily outpace a grizzly bear in the open), they are found in large quantities in several areas inhabited by brown bears and provide a larger meal per carcass. Moose may be preferred where found in large numbers because of their solitary habits and tendency to dwell in wooded areas, both of which makes them easier to ambush. Despite its diminished reputation as a predator, the brown bear is the most dangerous solitary predator of moose, with only packs of wolves a more regular predator; even <a href="Siberian%20tiger">Siberian tiger</a>s take other prey, primarily (<a href="elk">elk</a> and <a href="Wild%20boar">boar</a>), in areas where they co-exist with the giant deer. Brown bears normally avoid the potential risks of hunting large deer, which can potentially fight back but usually escape bears by running, by picking out young calves or sickly adults from deer herds. In northeastern <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, it was found that moose were the most important single food item (present in up to 45% of scats and locally comprising more than 70% of the bear's dietary energy) for local brown bears and several local bears appear to be specialized moose hunters, most often picking off sickly yearling moose and pregnant but healthy cows. In <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>, grizzly bears who derived much of their food energy from ungulates were studied, and 30% of the ungulates consumed were through predation, the remaining amount from scavenging of carcasses. Elk, bison and moose (the three largest native ungulates in the region) each constituted nearly a quarter of the overall ungulate diet. 13% of the total of ungulates actively hunted and killed per that study in Yellowstone were elk calves, while 8% of the actively and successfully hunted prey there were adult cow elk. Despite their lack of preference for smaller deer, other species including <a href="red%20deer">red deer</a> ("Cervus elaphus"), <a href="sika%20deer">sika deer</a> ("Cervus nippon" ), <a href="axis%20deer">axis deer</a> ("Axis axis"), <a href="roe%20deer">European roe deer</a> ("Capreolus capreolus"), <a href="Siberian%20roe%20deer">Siberian roe deer</a> ("Capreolus pygargus"), <a href="fallow%20deer">fallow deer</a> ("Dama dama"), <a href="mule%20deer">mule deer</a> ("Odocoileus hemionus") and <a href="white-tailed%20deer">white-tailed deer</a> ("Odocoileus virginianus") have turned up in their diet.

As many as 20 species of <a href="bovid">bovid</a>s are also potential prey, including various <a href="ovis">sheep</a>, <a href="capra%20%28genus%29">goat</a>s, <a href="antelope">antelope</a>, <a href="bison">bison</a> ("Bison" ssp.) and <a href="muskoxen">muskoxen</a> ("Ovibos moschatus"). Bovids are mostly taken in random encounters when bears come across a vulnerable, usually young or sickly individual, as smaller species are extremely agile (and often live in rocky environments) and larger varieties are potentially dangerous, especially if aware of the bear's presence. In some parts of <a href="eastern%20Europe">eastern Europe</a> and <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="wild%20boar">wild boar</a> ("Sus scrofa") may be taken in surprisingly large quantities considering the mostly herbivorous reputation of bears in these regions. One study from the <a href="Amur%20Oblast">Amur territory</a> of <a href="Russia">Russia</a> found that brown bears were actually more prolific killers of wild boars than both tigers and gray wolves, but these results are probably biased due to the scarcity of tigers in the region because of overhunting of the big cat. In rare cases, brown bears are capable of killing bulls of the largest ungulates in regions they inhabit, reportedly including <a href="moose">moose</a>, <a href="muskox">muskox</a>, <a href="yak">yak</a> ("Bos grunniens") and both <a href="American%20bison">American</a> and <a href="European%20bison">European bison</a> ("Bison bison" & "bonasus"). Remarkably, such attacks are sometimes carried out by bears that were not particularly large, including interior sow grizzlies or small-bodied bears from the <a href="Central%20Arctic">Central Arctic</a>, and some exceptional ungulates taken may be up to two to three times the weight of the attacking bear. However, most of the bears who took adult moose in east-central <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> were large, mature males.

This species may eat <a href="bird">bird</a>s and their <a href="Egg%20%28biology%29">egg</a>s, including almost entirely ground- or rock-nesting species. Although not typically able to capture a healthy grown bird, eggs, nestlings and fledglings of large bird species can be very attractive to brown bears. Species attacked have ranged can be any size available from <a href="Aleutian%20tern">Aleutian tern</a>s ("Onychoprion aleuticus") to <a href="Trumpeter%20swan">trumpeter</a> and <a href="whooper%20swan">whooper swan</a>s ("Cygnus buccinator" & "cygnus"). Most recorded avian prey have consisted of <a href="geese">geese</a> and <a href="Merginae">sea duck</a>s nesting in the lower Arctic Circle, followed by coveys of <a href="Galliformes">galliforms</a>, as these birds place their nests in shallow water and on the ground as well as raise their chicks in such areas, so are relatively more vulnerable. Large birds of prey including <a href="sea%20eagle">sea eagle</a>s, <a href="gyrfalcon">gyrfalcon</a>s ("Falco rusticolus") and <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>s ("Aquila chrysaetos") are sometimes exploited as prey if nesting in rock formations accessible on foot and eagles and falcons may furiously dive at bears near their nests. Due to their inhabitance of cooler temperate areas, <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s and <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s are rarely a food source and have been verified as prey only in a few cases: <a href="Common%20frog">frog</a>s in the <a href="Italian%20Alps">Italian Alps</a>, <a href="Japanese%20rat%20snake">rat snake</a>s in <a href="Hokkaido">Hokkaido</a>, <a href="Takydromus">grass lizard</a>s in the <a href="Amur%20Oblast">Amur territory</a> and <a href="Hermann%27s%20tortoise">tortoise</a>s in <a href="Greece">Greece</a>.

When forced to live in close proximity with humans and their domesticated animals, bears may potentially predate any type of domestic animal. Most type of livestock have been domesticated for millennia and have little to no anti-predator defenses. Therefore, brown bears are somewhat more likely to attack healthy adults than they are of healthy adult wild animals. Among domestic and farm animals, domestic <a href="cattle">cattle</a> ("Bos primigenius taurus") are sometimes exploited as prey. Cattle are bitten on the neck, back or head and then the abdominal cavity is opened for eating. In <a href="Norway">Norway</a>, free-ranging <a href="domestic%20sheep">domestic sheep</a> ("Ovis aries") are numerous and the local brown bears derive 65–87% of their dietary energy in late summer from sheep. Because of the aforementioned vulnerability, examination of Norwegian sheep remains suggest many of the sheep consumed there are adults that were killed by the bears rather than merely scavenged, and thus some local farmers received partial compensation for their stock losses. In nearby northern Sweden, free-ranging sheep are not present and the bear derive their food predominantly from natural sources. <a href="Horse">Horse</a>s ("Equus ferus caballus"), <a href="goat">goat</a>s ("Capra aegagrus hircus"), <a href="pig">pig</a>s ("Sus scrofa domesticus"), <a href="chicken">chicken</a>s ("Gallus gallus domesticus") and <a href="dog">dog</a>s ("Canis lupus familaris") may be opportunistically killed in several parts of the brown bear's range as well. Plants and fruit farmed by humans are readily consumed as well, including <a href="Maize">corn</a> ("Zea mays "), <a href="wheat">wheat</a> ("Triticum" spp.), <a href="apple">apple</a> ("Malus pumila"), <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a> ("Sorghum" ssp.), <a href="melon">melon</a>s and any form of <a href="Berry">berries</a>. They will also feed at domestic <a href="Beekeeping">bee farms</a>, readily consuming both honey and the contents of the <a href="honey%20bee">honey bee</a> ("Apis mellifera") colony. Human foods and trash or refuse is eaten when possible. When an open garbage dump was kept in Yellowstone, brown bears were one of the most voracious and regular scavengers. The dump was closed after both brown and American black bears came to associate humans with food and lost their natural fear of them. In other areas, such as <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, dumps may continue to be an attractant for brown bears.

While feeding on <a href="carrion">carrion</a>, brown bears use their size to intimidate other predators, such as <a href="wolf">wolves</a>, <a href="cougar">cougar</a>s ("Puma concolor"), <a href="tiger">tiger</a>s ("Panthera tigris") and <a href="American%20black%20bear">black bear</a>s from their kills. Owing to their formidable size and aggressive disposition, predation by wild animals outside of their own species is rare for brown bears of any age, even cubs are often safe due to their watchful mother. There are two records of <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>s ("Aquila chrysaetos") predating brown bear cubs.

Adult bears are generally immune to predatory attacks except from tigers and other bears. <a href="Siberian%20tiger">Siberian tiger</a>s ("Panthera tigris altaica") prefer preying on young bears but smaller, fully grown adult female brown bears outside their dens may also be taken. Successful predatory attacks by tigers on adult brown bears are usually on females, with or without cubs, in their dens. Of 44 recorded encounters between the two predators, 20 resulted in confrontations; in 50% of these, the bears in general (not necessarily brown bears) were killed, in 27% the tigers were killed, and 23% of the cases ended with both animals surviving and parting ways despite injuries sustained in the conflict. Some bears emerging from hibernation seek out tigers in order to steal their kills. Despite the possibility of tiger predation, some large brown bears may actually benefit from the tiger's presence by appropriating tiger kills that the bears may not be able to successfully hunt themselves, and follow tiger tracks. Geptner et al. (1972) stated that bears are generally afraid of tigers and change their path after coming across tiger trails. In the winters of 1970–1973, Yudakov and Nikolaev recorded 1 case of a brown bear showing no fear of the tigers and another case of a brown bear changing path upon crossing tiger tracks. Other researchers have observed bears following tiger tracks to scavenge tigers' kills or to prey on tigers. Bears frequently track down tigers to usurp their kills, with occasional fatal outcomes for the tiger. A report from 1973 describes twelve known cases of brown bears killing tigers, including adult males; in all cases the tigers were subsequently eaten by the bears. There are reports of brown bears specifically targeting <a href="Amur%20leopard">Amur leopard</a>s and tigers to appropriate their kills. In the Sikhote-Alin reserve, 35% of tiger kills were stolen by bears, with the tigers either departing entirely or leaving part of the kill for the bear.
Brown bears regularly intimidate <a href="Gray%20wolf">gray wolves</a> ("Canis lupus") away from their kills, with wolves occurring in most of the brown bear's worldwide distribution. In <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>, brown bears pirate wolf kills so often, Yellowstone's Wolf Project director Doug Smith wrote, "It's not a matter of if the bears will come calling after a kill, but when." Similarly, in <a href="Denali%20National%20Park">Denali National Park</a>, grizzly bears routinely rob wolf packs of their kills. On the contrary, in <a href="Katmai%20National%20Park%20and%20Preserve">Katmai National Park and Preserve</a>, wolves, even lone wolves, may manage to displace brown bears at carrion sites. Despite the high animosity between the two species, most confrontations at kill sites or large carcasses end without bloodshed on either side. Though conflict over carcasses is common, on rare occasions the two predators tolerate each other on the same kill. To date, there are only a few cases of fully-grown wolves being killed by brown bears and none of wolves killing healthy adult brown bears. Given the opportunity, however, both species will prey on the other's cubs. Conclusively, the individual power of the bear against the collective strength of the wolf pack usually results in a long battle for kills or domination.

In some areas, the grizzly bear also regularly displaces <a href="cougar">cougar</a>s ("Puma concolor") from their kills with some estimates showing cougars locally lose up to a third of their dietary energy to grizzly bears. Cougars kill small bear cubs on rare occasions, but there was one report of a bear killing a cougar of unknown age and condition between 1993 and 1996. <a href="Eurasian%20lynx">Eurasian lynx</a> ("Lynx lynx"), the largest type of lynx and the only one to regularly take large prey, is similarly an habitual victim of kleptoparasitism to brown bears throughout Eurasia. Brown bears also co-exist with <a href="leopard">leopard</a>s ("Panthera pardus") (in very small remnant wild parts of the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, <a href="Jammu%20and%20Kashmir">Jammu and Kashmir</a>, northeastern <a href="China">China</a> and <a href="Primorsky%20Krai">Primorsky Krai</a>) and <a href="snow%20leopard">snow leopard</a>s ("Panthera uncia"), in several areas of northern <a href="central%20Asia">central Asia</a> and the <a href="Tibetan%20Plateau">Tibetan Plateau</a>). Although the brown bears’ interactions with these big cats are little known, they probably have similar relationships as grizzly bears do with cougars in North America. Snow leopards and Tibetan blue bears are verified, however, to be a threat to one another's cubs.

Smaller carnivorous animals are dominated by brown bears and generally avoid direct interactions with them, unless attempting to <a href="Kleptoparasitism">steal</a> scraps of food. Species which utilize underground or rock dens tend to be more vulnerable to predatory attacks by brown bears. Several <a href="mustelid">mustelid</a>s, including <a href="badger">badger</a>s, are not infrequently preyed upon, and seemingly even arboreal <a href="marten">marten</a>s may be attacked (especially if unhealthy or caught in furbearer traps). In North America, both species of otter have been known to be ambushed by brown bears when on land. On the contrary, <a href="wolverine">wolverine</a>s ("Gulo gulo") are known to have been persistent enough to fend off a grizzly bear as much as ten times their weight from a kill. In some rare cases, wolverines have lost their lives to grizzly bears, and wolverines in <a href="Denali%20National%20Park">Denali National Park</a> will reportedly try to avoid encounters with grizzlies. Beyond wolves, other canids may occasionally be killed around their den, most likely pups or kits, or adults if overly incautious near a carrion site, including <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s ("Canis latrans"), multiple species of <a href="fox">fox</a> and <a href="raccoon%20dog">raccoon dog</a>s ("Nyctereutes procyonoides"). Medium-sized cats may also be rarely killed by brown bears. <a href="Pinniped">Seal</a>s are on rare occasions killed by brown bears, including eye-witness accounts of Russian bears ambushing <a href="Spotted%20seal">spotted</a> ("Phoca largha") and <a href="harbor%20seal">harbor seal</a>s ("Phoca vitulina"). Consumption of <a href="Ringed%20seal">ringed</a> ("Pusa hispida" ) and <a href="bearded%20seal">bearded seal</a> ("Erignathus barbatus") has been reported in the <a href="Mackenzie%20River">Mackenzie river delta</a>, presumably via predation or scavenging of polar bear kills, as pinnipeds are not usually encountered as carrion from land.

Brown bears usually dominate other bear species in areas where they coexist. Due to their smaller size, <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a>s are at a competitive disadvantage to brown bears in open, unforested areas. Although displacement of black bears by brown bears has been documented, actual interspecific killing of black bears by brown bears has only occasionally been reported. Confrontation is mostly avoided due to the black bear's diurnal habits and preference for heavily forested areas, as opposed to the brown bear's largely nocturnal habits and preference for open spaces. Where they do not live in close proximity to grizzly bears, and especially where found near human habitations, American black bears may become to a larger extent nocturnal. Brown bears may also kill <a href="Asian%20black%20bear">Asian black bear</a>s, though the latter species probably largely avoids conflicts with the brown bear due to similar habits and habitat preferences to the American black species. Brown bears will eat the fruit dropped from trees by the Asian black bear, as they themselves are too large and cumbersome to climb. Improbably, in the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>, brown bears are reportedly intimidated by Asian black bears in confrontations. However, the Himalayan black bears are reportedly more aggressive towards humans than the region's Himalayan brown bear, and the latter is one of the smaller races of brown bear, though still somewhat larger than the black bear. In <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, the opposite is true, and black bears are not known to attack people, but brown bears are. Both black bears seem to be most vulnerable to predatory attacks by brown bears when the latter species leaves hibernation sooner in early spring and ambushes the smaller ursids in their dens.

There has been a recent increase in interactions between brown bears and <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a>s, theorized to be caused by <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>. Brown bears have been seen moving increasingly northward into territories formerly claimed by polar bears. Despite averaging somewhat smaller sizes, brown bears tend to dominate polar bears in disputes over carcasses, and dead polar bear cubs have been found in brown bear dens.

Large herbivores, such as <a href="moose">moose</a>, <a href="Bison">buffalo</a> and <a href="muskox">muskox</a> may have an intolerance of brown bears due to their possible threat to vulnerable members of their herds or themselves; moose regularly charge grizzly bears in their calf's defense, but seldom are the bears killed. <a href="Bison">Bison</a> have been known to fatally injure lone grizzly bears in battles, and even a <a href="mountain%20goat">mountain goat</a> ("Oreamnos americanus") was observed to do so with its horns, although herbivores are rarely a serious danger to brown bears.

In the roughly 0.9 million years of its existence, brown bears have had to contend with multiple competing species, a majority of which went extinct at the end of the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> era. In its much longer history in <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, brown bears diverged from the two species of cave bear, the <a href="Cave%20bear">giant</a> ("U. spelaeus") and <a href="Ursus%20rossicus">small cave bear</a>s ("U. rossicus"), two species that it existed alongside in what is now <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, for the larger form, and <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a> and <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> for the smaller cave bear. The cave bears were similar in size to the larger forms of brown bear and polar bear alive today in terms of length, but were bulkier, with much higher-density skeletal remains, and presumably rather heavier than the modern brown bear, with the giant cave bear about the same length as a modern Kodiak bear but projected to be some 30% heavier. Pleistocene-era brown bears appear to have been somewhat larger and more carnivorous than most modern forms based on skull dimensions. The cave bears are usually deemed to have been highly herbivorous, to a greater extent than the brown bear, based on examinations of stable isotopes and dental morphology. Recent studies, however, have shown that cave bears could have opportunistically adapted to a fairly omnivorous diet and consumed many herbivore carcasses. Despite this, the dietary differences and differing habitat preferences (caves of course being much more habitually used in the cave species than the brown bear) allowed the three "Ursus" to persist at the same time in different parts of Eurasia.

A more dangerous competitor was encountered by brown bears upon crossing the <a href="Bering%20Land%20Bridge">Bering Land Bridge</a> about 100,000 years ago in the form of the <a href="short-faced%20bear">short-faced bear</a>, a long-legged bear that was estimated to have weighed about twice as much on average than a modern Kodiak bear. Although at one time deemed a hyper-carnivorous predator that used its long legs to run down large prey, more recent studies have indicated that, like the modern brown bear, it was an omnivorous opportunist that probably scavenged many meals and presumably used its size and great height to intimidate large predators from kills. Until it declined along with its food sources, dwindling into extinction, the short-faced bear presumably prevented the brown bear from spreading south, mainly through competition but also, to some extent, predation. A single fossil <a href="ulna">ulna</a> some 70,000-years-old found in <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>, deemed to come from an extremely large sub-adult <a href="Ursus%20maritimus%20tyrannus">Pleistocene polar bear</a> ("Ursus maritimus tyrannus"), was projected to be the largest known form of the "Ursus" genus. However, this cannot be ruled out as an extinct population of brown bear, based on the inconclusiveness of the only known fossil. Other carnivorans during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> that, based on their large size, were possibly occasional predators of early brown bears (at least females and cubs) were primarily big cats, including the <a href="Panthera%20leo%20spelaea">cave lion</a> ("Panthera leo spelaea") and the saber-toothed "<a href="Machairodus">Machairodus</a>" in <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> and, perhaps rarely in southern <a href="Beringia">Beringia</a>, the <a href="American%20lion">American lion</a> ("Panthera leo atrox") and the saber-toothed "<a href="Smilodon">Smilodon</a>" and, in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, "<a href="Homotherium">Homotherium</a>". Interactions with these large cats were probably not highly disparate from those that continue today between brown bears and the Siberian tiger. Unlike most of these species, the brown bear was able to survive the <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event">Quaternary extinction event</a> that concluded the ice age. Presumably, this was due to its greater dietary and habitat plasticity and its adoption of a more extensively herbivorous diet, as most temperate-zone herbivores that may have provided meals for more specialized large land carnivores went extinct as the warming climate killed off their food source.

It is likely that humans have caused the extinction and fragmentation of bear populations and their habitats since prehistorical times. It has been shown, for instance, that bear populations from the <a href="Greater%20Caucasus">Greater Caucasus</a> and the <a href="Lesser%20Caucasus">Lesser Caucasus</a> Mountains, separated by the densely populated Transcaucasian Depression, have been matrilineally isolated since the early Holocene era, i.e., after permanent human settlements appeared throughout the area. While hunting by early humans was a (previously underestimated) factor in many of the Quartenary extinction events, a perhaps stronger factor in the survival of this species compared to many other northern Pleistocene bears is the brown bear's stronger genetic diversity. In comparison, the giant cave bear appeared to enter a genetic bottleneck that started a population decline some 25,000 years before the species’ extinction.

Brown bears usually avoid areas where extensive development or urbanization has occurred, unlike the smaller, more inoffensive <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a> which can adapt to <a href="Peri-urbanisation">peri-urban regions</a>. Under many circumstances, extensive human development may cause brown bears to alter their home ranges. However, bears can easily lose their natural cautiousness upon being attracted to human-created food sources, such as garbage dumps, litter bins, and dumpsters. Brown bears may even venture into human dwellings or <a href="barn">barn</a>s in search of food as humans encroach into bear habitats. In different parts of their distribution, brown bears sometimes kill and eat domesticated animals. The saying "a fed bear is a dead bear" has come into use to popularize the idea that allowing bears to scavenge human garbage, such as trash cans and campers' backpacks, <a href="pet%20food">pet food</a>, or other food sources that draw the bear into contact with humans, can result in a bear's death. Where attractive bear food and concentrated human settlements overlap, human-bear conflict can create an <a href="ecological%20trap">ecological trap</a> resulting in a lower apparent survival rate for brown bears caught in the trap, as well as attracting additional bears and thereby causing an overall population decline in the area, based on a 20062013 study performed in a southeastern British Columbian valley.

When bears come to associate human activity with a "food reward", they are likely to continue to become emboldened; the likelihood of human-bear encounters increases, as they may return to the same location despite relocation. Relocation of the bear has been used to separate the bear from the human environment, but it does not address the problem of the bear's newly learned association of humans with food or the environmental situations which created the human-habituated bear. "Placing a bear in habitat used by other bears may lead to competition and social conflict, and result in the injury or death of the less dominant bear." <a href="Yellowstone%20National%20Park">Yellowstone National Park</a>, a reserve located in the western United States, contains prime habitat for the grizzly bear ("Ursus arctos horribilis"), and due to the enormous number of visitors, human-bear encounters are common. The scenic beauty of the area has led to an influx of people moving into the area. In addition, because there are so many bear relocations to the same remote areas of Yellowstone, and because male bears tend to dominate the center of the relocation zone, female bears tend to be pushed to the boundaries of the region and beyond. As a result, a large proportion of repeat offenders, bears that are killed for public safety, are females. This creates a further depressive effect on an already endangered species. The grizzly bear is officially described as "threatened" in the U.S. Though the problem is most significant with regard to grizzlies, these issues affect the other types of brown bears as well.

In Europe, part of the problem lies with <a href="shepherd">shepherd</a>s; over the past two centuries, many sheep and goat herders have gradually abandoned the more traditional practice of using <a href="dog">dog</a>s to guard flocks, which have concurrently grown larger. Typically, they allow the herds to graze freely over sizeable tracts of land. As bears reclaim parts of their range, they may eat livestock as sheep and goat are relatively easy for a bear to kill. In some cases, the shepherds shoot the bear, thinking their livelihood is under threat. Many are now better informed about the ample compensation available, and will make a claim when they lose livestock to a bear. Another issue in several parts of their range in <a href="Europe">Europe</a> is supplemental feeding stations where various kind of animal carrion is offered, which are set up mainly in <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> and <a href="eastern%20Europe">eastern Europe</a> both to support the locally threatened species and so humans can enjoy watching bears that may otherwise prove evasive. Despite that most stations were cautiously set in remote areas far from human habitations, some brown bears in such areas have become conditioned to associate humans with food and become excessively bold "problem bears". Also supplemental feeding appears to cause no decrease in livestock predation.

<a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> tribes sympatric with brown bears often view them with a mixture of awe and fear. North American brown bears have at times been so feared by the natives, that they were rarely hunted, especially alone. At traditional grizzly hunts in some western tribes such as the <a href="Gwich%E2%80%99in">Gwich’in</a> the expedition was conducted with the same preparation and ceremoniality as intertribal warfare, and was never done except with a company of 4–10 warriors. The tribe members who dealt the killing blow were highly esteemed among their compatriots. Californian natives actively avoided prime bear habitat, and would not allow their young men to hunt alone, for fear of bear attacks. During the Spanish colonial period, some tribes, instead of hunting grizzlies themselves, would seek aid from European colonists to deal with problem bears. Many authors in the American west wrote of natives or <a href="voyageurs">voyageurs</a> with lacerated faces and missing noses or eyes due to attacks from grizzlies.

Many Native American tribes both respect and fear the brown bear. In <a href="Kwakiutl">Kwakiutl</a> mythology, black and brown bears became enemies when Grizzly Bear Woman killed Black Bear Woman for being lazy. Black Bear Woman's children, in turn, killed Grizzly Bear Woman's own cubs. <a href="Sleeping%20Bear%20Dunes%20National%20Lakeshore">Sleeping Bear Dunes</a> is named after a Native American legend, where a female bear and her cub swam across Lake Michigan. Exhausted from their journey, the bears rested on the shoreline and fell sound asleep. Over the years, the sand covered them up, creating a huge sand dune.

There are an average of two fatal attacks by bears per year in North America. In <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, there are only four known cases since 1902 of bear encounters which have resulted in death. The two most common causes for bear attack are surprise and curiosity. Some types of bears, such as polar bears, are more likely to attack humans when searching for food, while <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a>s are much less likely to attack. Despite their boldness and potential for predation if the bear is hungry, polar bears rarely attack humans because they are infrequently encountered in the <a href="Arctic%20ocean">Arctic sea</a>.

The Alaska Science Center ranks the following as the most likely reasons for bear attacks:

Aggressive behavior in brown bears is favored by numerous selection variables. Unlike the smaller black bears, adult brown bears are too large and have improperly shaped claws to escape danger by climbing trees, so they respond to danger by standing their ground and warding off their attackers. Increased aggressiveness also assists female brown bears in better ensuring the survival of their young to reproductive age. Mothers defending cubs are the most prone to attacking, being responsible for 70% of brown bear-caused human fatalities in North America.

Brown bears seldom attack humans on sight, and usually avoid people. In <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, it estimated that one in a thousand on-foot encounters with brown bears results in attack. They are, however, unpredictable in temperament, and may attack if they are surprised or feel threatened. Despite the low rate of attack, they appear to be the most dangerous northern carnivoran to humans, attacking more people on average annually than <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a>s or northern races of <a href="Asian%20black%20bear">Asian black bear</a> and <a href="Siberian%20tiger">Siberian tiger</a>s, <a href="cougar">cougar</a>s or <a href="gray%20wolves">gray wolves</a>. Several large carnivorans from tropical regions of <a href="Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="Asia">Asia</a> may be more dangerous to humans than brown bears, including other ursids such as the <a href="sloth%20bear">sloth bear</a> and Indian races of the <a href="Asian%20black%20bear">Asian black bear</a>. Each of the latter species of bear may kill up to a dozen people annually in certain Indian districts, about as many in a relatively small area as all of the world's brown bears combined. The high levels of human-directed aggression in these ursine bears is reportedly their evolution with once large numbers of predatory <a href="Bengal%20tiger">Bengal tiger</a>s (arguably itself the world's most dangerous carnivoran to humans even with its extreme decline in modern times, being statistically much more likely to attack than their northern Siberian cousins) and a very large human population, increasing the risk of surprising and angering a defensive black or sloth bear, the latter species often charging aggressively rather than fleeing if a surprise encounter occurs as do most other bear species.

Sows with cubs account for many attacks on humans by brown bears in North America. <a href="Habituation">Habituated</a> or food-conditioned bears can also be dangerous, as their long-term exposure to humans causes them to lose their natural shyness, and, in some cases, to associate humans with food. Small parties of one or two people are more often attacked by brown bears than large groups, with only one known case of an attack on a group of six or more. In that instance, it is thought that due to surprise, the grizzly bear may not have recognized the size of the group. In the majority of attacks resulting in injury, brown bears precede the attack with a growl or huffing sound. In contrast to injuries caused by American black bears, which are usually minor, brown bear attacks more often tend to result in serious injury and, in some cases, death. Brown bears seem to confront humans as they would when fighting other bears: they rise up on their hind legs, and attempt to "disarm" their victims by biting and holding on to the lower jaw to avoid being bitten in turn. Due to the bears' enormous physical strength, even a single bite or swipe can be deadly, as in tigers, with some human victims having had their heads completely crushed by a bear bite. Most attacks occur in the months of July, August, and September, the time when the number of outdoor recreationalists, such as hikers or hunters, is higher. People who assert their presence through noises tend to be less vulnerable, as they alert bears to their presence. In direct confrontations, people who run are statistically more likely to be attacked than those who stand their ground. Violent encounters with brown bears usually last only a few minutes, though they can be prolonged if the victims fight back. In <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, two common behaviors by human hunters, imitating the calls of deer to attract them and carrying ungulate carcasses, seem to court aggressive behavior and lead to a higher rate of attack from grizzly bears.

Attacks on humans are considered extremely rare in the <a href="former%20Soviet%20Union">former Soviet Union</a>, though exceptions exist in districts where they are not as often pursued by hunters. Siberian bears, for example, tend to be much bolder toward humans than their shyer, more persecuted European counterparts. The delineation in Eurasia between areas where aggressiveness of bears tends to increase is the <a href="Ural%20Mountains">Ural Mountains</a>, although the bears of <a href="eastern%20Europe">eastern Europe</a> are somewhat more aggressive than those of <a href="western%20Europe">western Europe</a>. In 2008, a <a href="platinum">platinum</a> mining compound in the Olyotorsky district of northern Kamchatka was besieged by a group of 30 bears, who killed two guards and prevented workers from leaving their homes. Ten people a year on average are killed by brown bears in Russia, more than all the other parts of brown bear's international range combined, although Russia also holds more brown bears than all other parts of the world combined. In Scandinavia, only three fatal attacks were recorded in the 20th century.
In Japan, a large brown bear nicknamed ""Kesagake"" (袈裟懸け, "<a href="Kesa%20%28clothing%29">kesa</a>-style slasher") made history for causing the <a href="Sankebetsu%20brown%20bear%20incident">worst bear attack in Japanese history</a> at <a href="Tomamae%2C%20Hokkaid%C5%8D">Tomamae, Hokkaidō</a> during numerous encounters during December 1915. It killed seven people and wounded three others (with possibly another three previous fatalities to its credit) before being gunned down after a large-scale beast-hunt. Today, there is still a shrine at Rokusensawa (六線沢), where the event took place, in memory of the victims of the incident.

Within Yellowstone National Park, injuries caused by grizzly attacks in developed areas averaged approximately one per year during the 1930s through to the 1950s, though it increased to four per year during the 1960s. They then decreased to one injury every two years during the 1970s. Between 1980 and 2002, there have been only two human injuries caused by grizzly bears in a developed area. Though grizzly attacks were rare in the backcountry before 1970, the number of attacks increased to an average of approximately one per year during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. In <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, from 1960 to 1998, the number of attacks by grizzly bears ending in injury were nearly three times more common than attacks ending in injury by <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a>s despite the black bear being an estimated 38 times more numerous in the province than grizzlies.

A study by US and Canadian researchers has found <a href="pepper%20spray">pepper spray</a> to be more effective at stopping aggressive bear behavior than guns, working in 92% of studied incidents versus 67% for guns. Carrying pepper spray is highly recommended by many authorities when traveling in bear country; however, carrying two means of deterrent, one of which is a large caliber gun, is also advised. Solid shotgun slugs, or three buckshot rounds, or a pistol of .44 caliber or more is suggested if a heavy hunting rifle is not available. Guns remain a viable, last resort option to be used in defense of life from aggressive bears. Too often, people do not carry a proper caliber weapon to neutralize the bear. According to the Alaska Science Center, a <a href="gauge%20%28bore%20diameter%29">12 gauge</a> <a href="shotgun">shotgun</a> with <a href="slug%20%28projectile%29">slugs</a> has been the most effective weapon. There have been fewer injuries as a result of only carrying lethal loads in the shotgun, as opposed to deterrent rounds. State of Alaska Defense of Life or Property (DLP) laws require one to report the kill to authorities, and salvage the hide, skull, and claws. A page at the State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources website offers information about how to "select a gun that will stop a bear (12-gauge shotgun or .300 mag rifle)."

Campers are often told to wear bright colored red ribbons and bells, and carry whistles to ward off bears. They are told to look for grizzly scat in camping areas, and be careful to carry the bells and whistles in those areas. Grizzly scat is difficult to differentiate from black bear scat, as diet is in a constant state of flux depending on the availability of seasonal food items. If a bear is killed near camp, the bear's carcass must be adequately disposed of, including entrails and blood, if possible. Failure to move the carcass has often resulted in it attracting other bears and further exacerbating a bad situation. Moving camps immediately is another recommended method.

Brown bears often figure into the literature of Europe and North America, in particular that which is written for children. "<a href="The%20Brown%20Bear%20of%20Norway">The Brown Bear of Norway</a>" is a <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a> <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a> telling the adventures of a girl who married a prince magically turned into a bear, and who managed to get him back into a human form by the force of her love and after many trials and difficulties. With "<a href="Goldilocks%20and%20the%20Three%20Bears">Goldilocks and the Three Bears</a>", a story from England, the three bears are usually depicted as brown bears. In German speaking countries, children are often told the fairytale of <a href="Snow%20White%20and%20Rose%20Red">Snow White and Rose Red</a>; the handsome prince in this tale has been transfigured into a brown bear. In the United States, parents often read their preschool age children the book <a href="Brown%20Bear%2C%20Brown%20Bear%2C%20What%20Do%20You%20See%3F">Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</a> to teach them their colors and how they are associated with different animals.

The <a href="Russian%20bear">Russian bear</a> is a common <a href="national%20personification">national personification</a> for Russia (as well as the former <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>) despite the country having no appointed national animal. The brown bear is Finland's national animal.

The <a href="grizzly%20bear">grizzly bear</a> is the state animal of <a href="Montana">Montana</a>. The California golden bear is the state animal of <a href="California">California</a>. Both animals are sub-species of the brown bear, and the species was extirpated from the latter state.

The coat of arms of <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> depicts a bear reaching up into a "madroño" or <a href="Arbutus%20unedo">strawberry tree</a> ("Arbutus unedo") to eat some of its fruit, whereas the Swiss city of <a href="Bern">Bern</a>'s coat of arms also depicts a bear and the city's name is popularly thought to derive from the German word for bear. The brown bear is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 5 <a href="Croatian%20kuna">kuna</a> coin, minted since 1993.
The <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> club <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> has a brown bear mascot named Berni. The <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL) franchise in Chicago, Illinois, is named the <a href="Chicago%20Bears">Bears</a>. In this context, no differentiation between black and brown bears is needed.

In the town of <a href="Prats%20de%20Moll%C3%B3">Prats de Molló</a>, in <a href="Vallespir">Vallespir</a>, southern France, a "bear festival" ("festa de l'ós") is celebrated annually at the beginning of spring, in which the locals dress up as bears, cover themselves with soot or coal and oil, and "attack" the onlookers, attempting to get everyone dirty. The festival ends with the "ball de l'os" (bear dance).

BCS theory

BCS theory or Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theory (named after <a href="John%20Bardeen">John Bardeen</a>, <a href="Leon%20Cooper">Leon Cooper</a>, and <a href="John%20Robert%20Schrieffer">John Robert Schrieffer</a>) is the first <a href="microscopic%20theory">microscopic theory</a> of <a href="superconductivity">superconductivity</a> since <a href="Heike%20Kamerlingh%20Onnes">Heike Kamerlingh Onnes's</a> 1911 discovery. The theory describes superconductivity as a microscopic effect caused by a condensation of <a href="Cooper%20pair">Cooper pair</a>s into a <a href="boson">boson</a>-like state. The theory is also used in <a href="nuclear%20physics">nuclear physics</a> to describe the pairing interaction between <a href="nucleon">nucleon</a>s in an <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a>.

It was proposed by Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer in 1957; they received the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> for this theory in 1972.

Rapid progress in understanding superconductivity gained momentum in the mid-1950s. It began with the 1948 paper, "On the Problem of the Molecular Theory of Superconductivity", where <a href="Fritz%20London">Fritz London</a> proposed that the <a href="Phenomenology%20%28particle%20physics%29">phenomenological</a> <a href="London%20equations">London equations</a> may be consequences of the <a href="quantum%20coherence">coherence</a> of a <a href="quantum%20state">quantum state</a>. In 1953, <a href="Brian%20Pippard">Brian Pippard</a>, motivated by penetration experiments, proposed that this would modify the London equations via a new scale parameter called the <a href="Superconducting%20coherence%20length">coherence length</a>. John Bardeen then argued in the 1955 paper, "Theory of the Meissner Effect in Superconductors", that such a modification naturally occurs in a theory with an energy gap. The key ingredient was Leon Neil Cooper's calculation of the bound states of electrons subject to an attractive force in his 1956 paper, "Bound Electron Pairs in a Degenerate Fermi Gas".

In 1957 Bardeen and Cooper assembled these ingredients and constructed such a theory, the BCS theory, with Robert Schrieffer. The theory was first published in April 1957 in the letter, "Microscopic theory of superconductivity". The demonstration that the phase transition is second order, that it reproduces the <a href="Meissner%20effect">Meissner effect</a> and the calculations of <a href="specific%20heat">specific heat</a>s and penetration depths appeared in the December 1957 article, "Theory of superconductivity". They received the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1972 for this theory.

In 1986, <a href="high-temperature%20superconductivity">high-temperature superconductivity</a> was discovered in some materials at temperatures up to about 130 K, considerably above the previous limit of about 30 <a href="Kelvin">K</a>. It is believed that BCS theory alone cannot explain this phenomenon and that other effects are in play. These effects are still not yet fully understood; it is possible that they even control superconductivity at low temperatures for some materials.

At sufficiently low temperatures, electrons near the <a href="Fermi%20surface">Fermi surface</a> become unstable against the formation of <a href="Cooper%20pair">Cooper pair</a>s. Cooper showed such binding will occur in the presence of an attractive potential, no matter how weak. In conventional superconductors, an attraction is generally attributed to an electron-lattice interaction. The BCS theory, however, requires only that the potential be attractive, regardless of its origin. In the BCS framework, superconductivity is a macroscopic effect which results from the condensation of Cooper pairs. These have some bosonic properties, and bosons, at sufficiently low temperature, can form a large <a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20condensate">Bose–Einstein condensate</a>. Superconductivity was simultaneously explained by <a href="Nikolay%20Bogolyubov">Nikolay Bogolyubov</a>, by means of the <a href="Bogoliubov%20transformation">Bogoliubov transformation</a>s.

In many superconductors, the attractive interaction between electrons (necessary for pairing) is brought about indirectly by the interaction between the electrons and the vibrating crystal lattice (the <a href="phonon">phonon</a>s). Roughly speaking the picture is the following:

An electron moving through a conductor will attract nearby positive charges in the lattice. This deformation of the lattice causes another electron, with opposite spin, to move into the region of higher positive charge density. The two electrons then become correlated. Because there are a lot of such electron pairs in a superconductor, these pairs overlap very strongly and form a highly collective condensate. In this "condensed" state, the breaking of one pair will change the energy of the entire condensate - not just a single electron, or a single pair. Thus, the energy required to break any single pair is related to the energy required to break "all" of the pairs (or more than just two electrons). Because the pairing increases this energy barrier, kicks from oscillating atoms in the conductor (which are small at sufficiently low temperatures) are not enough to affect the condensate as a whole, or any individual "member pair" within the condensate. Thus the electrons stay paired together and resist all kicks, and the electron flow as a whole (the current through the superconductor) will not experience resistance. Thus, the collective behavior of the condensate is a crucial ingredient necessary for superconductivity.

BCS theory starts from the assumption that there is some attraction between electrons, which can overcome the <a href="Coulomb%20repulsion">Coulomb repulsion</a>. In most materials (in low temperature superconductors), this attraction is brought about indirectly by the coupling of electrons to the <a href="crystal%20lattice">crystal lattice</a> (as explained above). However, the results of BCS theory do "not" depend on the origin of the attractive interaction. For instance, Cooper pairs have been observed in <a href="Ultracold%20atom">ultracold gases</a> of <a href="fermion">fermion</a>s where a homogeneous <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a> has been tuned to their <a href="Feshbach%20resonance">Feshbach resonance</a>. The original results of BCS (discussed below) described an <a href="Atomic%20orbital">s-wave</a> superconducting state, which is the rule among low-temperature superconductors but is not realized in many unconventional superconductors such as the <a href="Atomic%20orbital">d-wave</a> high-temperature superconductors.

Extensions of BCS theory exist to describe these other cases, although they are insufficient to completely describe the observed features of high-temperature superconductivity.

BCS is able to give an approximation for the quantum-mechanical many-body state of the system of (attractively interacting) electrons inside the metal. This state is
now known as the BCS state. In the normal state of a metal, electrons move independently, whereas in the BCS state, they are bound into Cooper pairs by the attractive interaction. The BCS formalism is based on the reduced potential for the electrons' attraction. Within this potential, a variational <a href="ansatz">ansatz</a> for the wave function is proposed. This ansatz was later shown to be exact in the dense limit of pairs. Note that the continuous crossover between the dilute and dense regimes of attracting pairs of fermions is still an open problem, which now attracts a lot of attention within the field of ultracold gases.

The hyperphysics website pages at <a href="Georgia%20State%20University">Georgia State University</a> summarize some key background to BCS theory as follows:


BCS derived several important theoretical predictions that are independent of the details of the interaction, since the quantitative predictions mentioned below hold for any sufficiently weak attraction between the electrons and this last condition is fulfilled for many low temperature superconductors - the so-called weak-coupling case. These have been confirmed in numerous experiments:

<doc id="4405" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4405" title="Biathlon">
Biathlon

The biathlon is a <a href="winter%20sport">winter sport</a> that combines <a href="cross-country%20skiing%20%28sport%29">cross-country skiing</a> and <a href="shooting%20sport">rifle shooting</a>.

According to "<a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>", the biathlon "is rooted in the skiing traditions of Scandinavia, where early inhabitants revered the <a href="Ullr">Norse god Ullr</a> as both the ski god and the hunting god".
In modern times, the activity that developed into this sport was an exercise for <a href="Norway">Norwegian</a> people that was an alternative training for the <a href="army">military</a>. Norwegian skiing regiments organized military skiing contests in the 18th century, divided in four classes: shooting at mark while skiing at top speed, downhill race among trees, downhill race on big hills without falling, and a long race on flat ground while carrying rifle and military pack. In modern terminology these military contests included downhill, slalom, biathlon, and cross-country skiing. One of the world's first known ski clubs, the Trysil Rifle and Ski Club, was formed in Norway in 1861 to promote national defense at the local level. 20th century variants include (the military contest) – a 17 km cross-country race with shooting, and the military cross-country race at 30 km including marksmanship. The modern biathlon is a civilian variant of the old military combined exercise. In Norway, the biathlon was until 1984 a branch of "Det frivillige Skyttervesen", an organization set up by the government to promote civilian marksmanship in support of national defense. In Norwegian, the biathlon is called "skiskyting" (literally "ski shooting"). In Norway there are still separate contests in "skifeltskyting", a cross-country race at 12 km with large-caliber rifle shooting at various targets with unknown range.

Called <a href="military%20patrol">military patrol</a>, the combination of skiing and shooting was contested at the <a href="Winter%20Olympic%20Games">Winter Olympic Games</a> in <a href="Military%20patrol%20at%20the%201924%20Winter%20Olympics">1924</a>, and then <a href="Demonstration%20sport">demonstrated</a> in <a href="Military%20patrol%20at%20the%201928%20Winter%20Olympics">1928</a>, <a href="Military%20patrol%20at%20the%201936%20Winter%20Olympics">1936</a>, and <a href="Military%20patrol%20at%20the%201948%20Winter%20Olympics">1948</a>, but did not regain Olympic recognition then because the small number of competing countries disagreed on the rules. During the mid-1950s, however, the biathlon was introduced into the Soviet and Swedish winter sport circuits and was widely enjoyed by the public. This newfound popularity aided the effort of having the biathlon gain entry into the Winter Olympics.

The first <a href="Biathlon%20World%20Championship">Biathlon World Championship</a> was held in 1958 in <a href="Austria">Austria</a>, and in 1960 the sport was finally included in the <a href="1960%20Winter%20Olympics">Olympic Games</a>. At <a href="1992%20Winter%20Olympics">Albertville</a> in 1992, women were first allowed in the Olympic biathlon.

The competitions from 1958 to 1965 used high-power <a href="centerfire">centerfire</a> <a href="cartridge%20%28firearms%29">cartridges</a>, such as the <a href=".30-06%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BSpringfield">.30-06 Springfield</a> and the <a href="7.62%C3%9751mm%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BNATO">7.62×51mm NATO</a>, before the <a href=".22%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BLong%20Rifle">.22 Long Rifle</a> <a href="Rimfire%20ammunition">rimfire</a> cartridge was standardized in 1978. The ammunition was carried in a belt worn around the competitor's waist. The sole event was the men's individual, encompassing four separate ranges and firing distances of , , , and . The target distance was reduced to with the addition of the relay in 1966. The shooting range was further reduced to in 1978 with the mechanical targets making their debut at the <a href="1980%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BWinter%20Olympics">1980 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Lake%20Placid%2C%20New%20York">Lake Placid</a>.

In 1948, the "Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne et Biathlon" (UIPMB) was founded, to standardise the rules for the biathlon and the <a href="modern%20pentathlon">modern pentathlon</a>. In 1993, the biathlon branch of the UIPMB created the <a href="International%20Biathlon%20Union">International Biathlon Union</a> (IBU), which officially separated from the UIPMB in 1998.

Presidents of the UIPMB/IBU:

The following articles list major international biathlon events and medalists. Contrary to the Olympics and World Championships (BWCH), the World Cup (BWC) is an entire winter season of (mostly) weekly races, where the medalists are those with the highest sums of World Cup points at the end of the season.

The complete rules of the biathlon are given in the official IBU rule books.

A biathlon competition consists of a race in which contestants ski through a cross-country trail system whose total distance is divided into either two or four shooting rounds, half in prone position, the other half standing. Depending on the shooting performance, extra distance or time is added to the contestant's total running distance/time. The contestant with the shortest total time wins.

For each shooting round, the biathlete must hit five targets and receives a penalty for each missed target, which varies according to the competition rules, as follows:

In order to keep track of the contestants' progress and relative standing throughout a race, <a href="Fully%20automatic%20time">split time</a>s (intermediate times) are taken at several points along the skiing track and upon finishing each shooting round. The large display screens commonly set up at biathlon arenas, as well as the information graphics shown as part of the TV picture, will typically list the split time of the fastest contestant at each intermediate point and the times and time differences to the closest runners-up.

All cross-country skiing techniques are permitted in the biathlon, which means that the <a href="Cross-country%20skiing%23Skate%20skiing">free technique</a> is usually the preferred one, being the fastest. No equipment other than skis and ski poles may be used to move along the track. The minimum ski length is the height of the skier less . The rifle has to be carried by the skier during the race at all times.

The biathlete carries a small-bore rifle, which weighs at least , excluding ammunition and magazines. The rifles use <a href=".22%20Long%20Rifle">.22 LR</a> ammunition and are <a href="bolt%20action">bolt action</a> or <a href="Bolt%20action%23Straight-pull">Fortner</a> (straight-pull bolt) action.

The target range shooting distance is . There are five circular targets to be hit in each shooting round. When shooting in the <a href="prone%20position">prone position</a>, the target diameter is ; when shooting in the standing position, the target diameter is . On all modern biathlon ranges, the targets are self-indicating, in that they flip from black to white when hit, giving the biathlete, as well as the spectators, instant visual feedback for each shot fired.

The individual race ( for women) is the oldest biathlon event; the distance is skied over five laps. The biathlete shoots four times at any shooting lane, in the order of prone, standing, prone, standing, totaling 20 targets. For each missed target a fixed penalty time, usually one minute, is added to the skiing time of the biathlete. Competitors' starts are staggered, normally by 30 seconds.

The sprint is for men and for women; the distance is skied over three laps. The biathlete shoots twice at any shooting lane, once prone and once standing, for a total of 10 shots. For each miss, a penalty loop of must be skied before the race can be continued. As in the individual competition, the biathletes start in intervals.

In a pursuit, biathletes' starts are separated by their time differences from a previous race, most commonly a sprint. The contestant crossing the finish line first is the winner. The distance is for men and for women, skied over five laps; there are four shooting bouts (two prone, two standing, in that order), and each miss means a penalty loop of . To prevent awkward and/or dangerous crowding of the skiing loops, and overcapacity at the shooting range, World Cup Pursuits are held with only the 60 top ranking biathletes after the preceding race. The biathletes shoot on a first-come, first-served basis at the lane corresponding to the position they arrived for all shooting bouts.

In the mass start, all biathletes start at the same time and the first across the finish line wins. In this for men or for women competition, the distance is skied over five laps; there are four bouts of shooting (two prone, two standing, in that order) with the first shooting bout being at the lane corresponding to the competitor's bib number (Bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race), with the rest of the shooting bouts being on a first-come, first-served basis (If a competitor arrives at the lane in fifth place, they shoot at lane 5). As in sprint and pursuit, competitors must ski one penalty loop for each miss. Here again, to avoid unwanted congestion, World Cup Mass starts are held with only the 30 top ranking athletes on the start line (half that of the Pursuit as here all contestants start simultaneously).

The relay teams consist of four biathletes, who each ski (men) or (women), each leg skied over three laps, with two shooting rounds; one prone, one standing. For every round of five targets there are eight bullets available, though the last three can only be single-loaded manually one at a time from spare round holders or bullets deposited by the competitor into trays or onto the mat at the firing line. If after eight bullets there are still misses, one 150 m (490 ft) penalty loop must be taken for each missed target remaining. The first-leg participants start all at the same time, and as in cross-country skiing relays, every athlete of a team must touch the team's next-leg participant to perform a valid changeover. On the first shooting stage of the first leg, the participant must shoot in the lane corresponding to their bib number (Bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race), then for the remainder of the relay, the relay team shoots on a first-come, first-served basis (arrive at the range in fifth place, shoot at lane 5).

The most recent addition to the number of biathlon competition variants, the mixed relay is similar to the ordinary relay but the teams are composed of two women and two men. Legs 1 and 2 are done by the women, legs 3 and 4 by the men. The women's legs are and men's legs are as in ordinary relay competitions.

In 2014, single mixed relay was introduced by the IBU. Each team has a man and a woman, and each runs two legs, except the last leg where the man completes for a total .

A team consists of four biathletes, but unlike the relay competition, all team members start at the same time. Two athletes must shoot in the prone shooting round, the other two in the standing round. In case of a miss, the two non-shooting biathletes must ski a penalty loop of 150 m (490 ft). The skiers must enter the shooting area together, and must also finish within 15 seconds of each other; otherwise a time penalty of one minute is added to the total time. Since 2004, this race format has been obsolete at the World Cup level.

Biathlon events are broadcast most regularly where the sport enjoys its greatest popularity, namely Germany (<a href="Das%20Erste">ARD</a>, <a href="ZDF">ZDF</a>), Austria (<a href="ORF%20%28broadcaster%29">ORF</a>), Norway (<a href="Norsk%20Rikskringkasting">NRK</a>), France (<a href="L%27%C3%89quipe%20%28TV%20channel%29">L'Équipe 21</a>), Finland (<a href="Yleisradio">YLE</a>), <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a> (<a href="ETV%20%28Estonia%29">ETV</a>), <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a> (<a href="LTV%207">LTV</a>), <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> (<a href="Lithuanian%20National%20Radio%20and%20Television">LRT</a>), <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a> (<a href="Hrvatska%20radiotelevizija">HRT</a>), Poland (<a href="Polsat">Polsat</a>), Sweden (<a href="Sveriges%20Television">SVT</a>), Russia (<a href="Russia-2">Russia-2</a>, <a href="Channel%20One%20Russia">Channel One</a>), <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a> (<a href="TVR%20%28Belarus%29">TVR</a>), <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a> (<a href="RTV%20Slovenia">RTV</a>), <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> (<a href="Radio-televizija%20Bosne%20i%20Hercegovine">BHRT</a>), <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> (<a href="Bulgarian%20National%20Television">BNT</a>), and <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> (<a href="Korean%20Broadcasting%20System">KBS</a>); it is broadcast on European-wide <a href="Eurosport">Eurosport</a>, which also broadcasts to the Asia-Pacific region.

The broadcast distribution being one indicator, the constellation of a sport's main <a href="sponsor%20%28commercial%29">sponsors</a> usually gives a similar, and correlated, indication of popularity: for biathlon, these are the Germany-based companies <a href="E.ON">E.ON Ruhrgas</a> (energy), <a href="Krombacher">Krombacher</a> (beer), and <a href="Viessmann">Viessmann</a> (boilers and other heating systems).

Buddy Holly

Charles Hardin Holley (September 7, 1936 – February 3, 1959), known as Buddy Holly, was an American musician and singer-songwriter who was a central figure of mid-1950s <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a>. He was born in <a href="Lubbock%2C%20Texas">Lubbock, Texas</a>, to a musical family during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, and learned to play guitar and sing alongside his siblings. His style was influenced by <a href="gospel%20music">gospel music</a>, <a href="country%20music">country music</a>, and <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a> acts, and he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school. He made his first appearance on local television in 1952, and the following year he formed the group "Buddy and Bob" with his friend <a href="Bob%20Montgomery%20%28songwriter%29">Bob Montgomery</a>. In 1955, after opening for <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>, he decided to pursue a career in music. He opened for Presley three times that year; his band's style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll. In October that year, when he opened for <a href="Bill%20Haley%20%26amp%3B%20His%20Comets">Bill Haley & His Comets</a>, he was spotted by <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a> scout Eddie Crandall, who helped him get a contract with <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca Records</a>.

Holly's recording sessions at Decca were produced by <a href="Owen%20Bradley">Owen Bradley</a>. Unhappy with Bradley's control in the studio and with the sound he achieved there, he went to producer <a href="Norman%20Petty">Norman Petty</a> in <a href="Clovis%2C%20New%20Mexico">Clovis, New Mexico</a>, and recorded a demo of "<a href="That%27ll%20Be%20the%20Day">That'll Be the Day</a>", among other songs. Petty became the band's manager and sent the demo to <a href="Brunswick%20Records">Brunswick Records</a>, which released it as a single credited to "<a href="The%20Crickets">The Crickets</a>", which became the name of Holly's band. In September 1957, as the band toured, "That'll Be the Day" topped the <a href="List%20of%20Billboard%20number-one%20singles%20of%201957">US "Best Sellers in Stores"</a> chart and the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>. Its success was followed in October by another major hit, "<a href="Peggy%20Sue">Peggy Sue</a>".

The album "<a href="The%20%26quot%3BChirping%26quot%3B%20Crickets">Chirping Crickets</a>", released in November 1957, reached number five on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>. Holly made his second appearance on "<a href="The%20Ed%20Sullivan%20Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a>" in January 1958 and soon after, toured Australia and then the UK. In early 1959, he assembled a new band, consisting of future country music star <a href="Waylon%20Jennings">Waylon Jennings</a> (bass), famed session musician <a href="Tommy%20Allsup">Tommy Allsup</a> (guitar), and <a href="Carl%20Bunch">Carl Bunch</a> (drums), and embarked on a tour of the midwestern U.S. After a show in <a href="Clear%20Lake%2C%20Iowa">Clear Lake, Iowa</a>, he chartered an airplane to travel to his next show, in <a href="Moorhead%2C%20Minnesota">Moorhead, Minnesota</a>. Soon after takeoff, the plane crashed, killing him, <a href="Ritchie%20Valens">Ritchie Valens</a>, <a href="The%20Big%20Bopper">The Big Bopper</a>, and pilot Roger Peterson in a tragedy later referred to by <a href="Don%20McLean">Don McLean</a> as "<a href="The%20Day%20the%20Music%20Died">The Day the Music Died</a>".

During his short career, Holly wrote, recorded, and produced his own material. He is often regarded as the artist who defined the traditional rock-and-roll lineup of two guitars, bass, and drums. He was a major influence on later <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> artists, including <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>, <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>, and <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>. He was among the first artists inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>, in 1986. "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine ranked him number 13 in its list of "100 Greatest Artists".

'Buddy Holly' was born Charles Hardin Holley on September 7, 1936, in <a href="Lubbock%2C%20Texas">Lubbock, Texas</a>, at 3:30 pm; he was the fourth child of Lawrence Odell "L.O." Holley (1901–1985) and Ella Pauline Drake (1902–1990). His elder siblings were Larry (born in 1925), Travis (1927–2016), and Patricia Lou (1929–2008). From early childhood, he was nicknamed "Buddy". During the Great Depression, the Holleys frequently moved residence within Lubbock; L.O. changed jobs several times. Buddy Holly was baptized a <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a>, and the family were members of the <a href="Tabernacle%20Baptist%20Church">Tabernacle Baptist Church</a>.

The Holleys had an interest in music; all the family members except L.O. were able to play an instrument or sing. The elder Holley brothers performed in local talent shows; on one occasion, Buddy joined them on violin. Since he could not play it, his brother Larry greased the strings so it would not make any sound. The brothers won the contest. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Larry and Travis were called to military service. Upon his return, Larry brought with him a guitar he had bought from a shipmate while serving in the Pacific. At age 11, Buddy took piano lessons, but abandoned them after nine months. He switched to guitar after he saw a classmate playing and singing on the school bus. Buddy's parents initially bought him a <a href="steel%20guitar">steel guitar</a>, but he insisted that he wanted a guitar like his brother's. His parents bought the guitar from a pawnshop, and Travis taught him to play it.

During his early childhood, Buddy was influenced by the music of <a href="Hank%20Williams">Hank Williams</a>, <a href="Jimmie%20Rodgers%20%28country%20singer%29">Jimmie Rodgers</a>, <a href="Hank%20Snow">Hank Snow</a>, <a href="Bob%20Wills">Bob Wills</a>, and the <a href="Carter%20Family">Carter Family</a>. At Roscoe Wilson Elementary, he became friends with <a href="Bob%20Montgomery%20%28songwriter%29">Bob Montgomery</a>, and the two played together, practising with songs by the <a href="Louvin%20Brothers">Louvin Brothers</a> and <a href="Johnnie%20%26amp%3B%20Jack">Johnnie & Jack</a>. They both listened to the radio programs "<a href="Grand%20Ole%20Opry">Grand Ole Opry</a>" on <a href="WSM%20%28AM%29">WSM</a> , "<a href="Louisiana%20Hayride">Louisiana Hayride</a>" on <a href="KWKH">KWKH</a>, and "<a href="Big%20D%20Jamboree">Big D Jamboree</a>". At the same time, Holley played with other musicians he met in high school, including <a href="Sonny%20Curtis">Sonny Curtis</a> and <a href="Jerry%20Allison">Jerry Allison</a>. In 1952, Holley and Jack Neal participated as a duo billed as "Buddy and Jack" in a talent contest on a local television show. After Neal left, he was replaced by Montgomery and they were billed as "Buddy and Bob". The two soon started performing on the "Sunday Party" show on <a href="KDAV">KDAV</a> in 1953 and performed live gigs in Lubbock. At that time, Holley was influenced by late-night radio stations that played <a href="blues">blues</a> and <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a> (R&B). Holley would sit in his car with Curtis and tune to distant radio stations that could only be received at night, when local transmissions ceased. Holley then modified his music by blending his earlier country and western (C&W) influence with R & B.

By 1955, after graduating from high school, Holley decided to pursue a full-time career in music. He was further encouraged after seeing Elvis Presley performing live in Lubbock, whose act was booked by Pappy Dave Stone of KDAV. In February, Holley opened for Presley at the Fair Park Coliseum, in April at the Cotton Club, and again in June at the Coliseum. By that time, he had incorporated into his band Larry Welborn on the stand-up bass and Allison on drums, as his style shifted from C&W to <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a>. In October, Stone booked Bill Haley & His Comets and placed Holley as the opening act to be seen by <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a> scout Eddie Crandall. Impressed, Crandall persuaded Grand Ole Opry manager Jim Denny to seek a recording contract for Holley. Stone sent a demo tape, which Denny forwarded to <a href="Paul%20Cohen%20%28record%20producer%29">Paul Cohen</a>, who signed the band to <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca Records</a> in February 1956. In the contract, Decca misspelled Holley's last name as "Holly"; from then on, he was known as "Buddy Holly".

On January 26, 1956, Holly attended his first formal recording session, which was produced by <a href="Owen%20Bradley">Owen Bradley</a>. He attended two more sessions in Nashville, but with the producer selecting the session musicians and arrangements, Holly became increasingly frustrated by his lack of creative control. In April 1956, Decca released "<a href="Blue%20Days%2C%20Black%20Nights">Blue Days, Black Nights</a>" as a single, with "Love Me" on the B-side. Denny included Holly on a tour as the opening act for <a href="Faron%20Young">Faron Young</a>. During the tour, they were promoted as "Buddy Holly and the Two Tones", while later Decca called them "Buddy Holly and the Three Tunes". The label later released Holly's second single "Modern Don Juan", backed with "You Are My One Desire". Neither single made an impression. On January 22, 1957, Decca informed Holly his contract would not be renewed, but insisted he could not record the same songs for anyone else for five years.

Holly was unhappy with the results of his time with Decca; he was inspired by the success of <a href="Buddy%20Knox">Buddy Knox</a>'s "<a href="Party%20Doll">Party Doll</a>" and <a href="Jimmy%20Bowen">Jimmy Bowen</a>'s "<a href="I%27m%20Stickin%27%20with%20You">I'm Stickin' with You</a>", and visited <a href="Norman%20Petty">Norman Petty</a>, who had produced and promoted both records. Together with Allison, bassist <a href="Joe%20B.%20Mauldin">Joe B. Mauldin</a>, and rhythm guitarist <a href="Niki%20Sullivan">Niki Sullivan</a>, he went to Petty's studio in <a href="Clovis%2C%20New%20Mexico">Clovis, New Mexico</a>. The group recorded a demo of "<a href="That%27ll%20Be%20the%20Day">That'll Be the Day</a>", a song they had previously recorded in Nashville. Now playing lead guitar, Holly achieved the sound he desired. Petty became his manager and sent the record to <a href="Brunswick%20Records">Brunswick Records</a> in New York City. Holly, still under contract with Decca, could not release the record under his name, so a band name was used; Allison proposed the name "Crickets". Brunswick gave Holly a basic agreement to release "That'll Be the Day", leaving him with both artistic control and financial responsibility for future recordings. Impressed with the demo, the label's executives released it without recording a new version. "I'm Looking for Someone to Love" was the B-side; the single was credited to the <a href="The%20Crickets">Crickets</a>. Petty and Holly later learned that Brunswick was a subsidiary of Decca, which legally cleared future recordings under the name Buddy Holly. Recordings credited to the Crickets would be released on Brunswick, while the recordings under Holly's name were released on another subsidiary label, <a href="Coral%20Records">Coral Records</a>. Holly concurrently held a recording contract with both labels.

"That'll Be the Day" was released on May 27, 1957. Petty booked Holly and the Crickets for a tour with <a href="Irvin%20Feld">Irvin Feld</a>, who had noticed the band after "That'll Be the Day" appeared on the R&B chart. He booked them for appearances in Washington, DC, <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, and New York City. The band was booked to play at New York's <a href="Apollo%20Theater">Apollo Theater</a> on August 16–22. During the opening performances, the group did not impress the audience, but they were accepted after they included "<a href="Bo%20Diddley%20%28Bo%20Diddley%20song%29">Bo Diddley</a>" in their shows. By the end of their run at the Apollo, "That'll Be the Day" was climbing the charts. Encouraged by the single's success, Petty started to prepare two album releases; a solo album for Holly and another for the Crickets. Holly appeared on "<a href="American%20Bandstand">American Bandstand</a>", hosted by <a href="Dick%20Clark">Dick Clark</a> on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a>, on August 26. Before leaving New York, the band befriended the <a href="Everly%20Brothers">Everly Brothers</a>.

"That'll Be the Day" topped the <a href="Number-one%20hits%20of%201957%20%28United%20States%29">US "Best Sellers in Stores"</a> chart on September 23 and was number one on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in November. On September 20, Coral released "<a href="Peggy%20Sue">Peggy Sue</a>", backed with "<a href="Everyday%20%28Buddy%20Holly%20song%29">Everyday</a>", with Holly credited as the performer. By October, "Peggy Sue" had reached number three on "Billboard"'s pop chart and number two on the R&B chart; it peaked at number six on the UK Singles chart. As the success of the song grew, it brought more attention to Holly, with the band at the time being billed as "Buddy Holly and the Crickets".

In the last week of September, the band members flew to Lubbock to visit their families. Holly's high school girlfriend, Echo McGuire, had left him for a fellow student. Aside from McGuire, Holly had a relationship with Lubbock fan June Clark. After Clark ended their relationship, Holly realized the importance of his relationship with McGuire and considered his with Clark a temporary one. Meanwhile, for their return to recording, Petty arranged a session in <a href="Oklahoma%20City">Oklahoma City</a>, where he was performing with his own band. While the band drove to the location, the producer set up a makeshift studio. The rest of the songs needed for an album and singles were recorded; Petty later dubbed the material in Clovis. The resulting album, "<a href="The%20%26quot%3BChirping%26quot%3B%20Crickets">The "Chirping" Crickets</a>", was released on November 27, 1957. It reached number five on the UK Albums Chart. In October, Brunswick released the second single by the Crickets, "<a href="Oh%2C%20Boy%21%20%28The%20Crickets%20song%29">Oh, Boy!</a>", with "<a href="Not%20Fade%20Away%20%28song%29">Not Fade Away</a>" on the B-side. The single reached number 10 on the pop chart and 13 on the R&B chart. Holly and the Crickets performed "That'll Be the Day" and "Peggy Sue" on "The Ed Sullivan Show" on December 1, 1957. Following the appearance, Niki Sullivan left the group because of the intensive touring. On December 29, Holly and the Crickets performed "Peggy Sue" on "<a href="The%20Arthur%20Murray%20Party">The Arthur Murray Party</a>".

On January 8, 1958, Holly and the Crickets joined "America's Greatest Teenage Recording Stars" tour. On January 25, Holly recorded "<a href="Rave%20On">Rave On</a>"; the next day, he made his second appearance on "The Ed Sullivan Show", singing "Oh, Boy!" He departed to perform in <a href="Honolulu%2C%20Hawaii">Honolulu, Hawaii</a>, on January 27, and then started a week-long tour of Australia. In March, the band toured the United Kingdom, playing 50 shows in 25 days. The same month, his debut solo album, "<a href="Buddy%20Holly%20%28album%29">Buddy Holly</a>", was released. Upon their return to the United States, Holly and the Crickets joined Alan Freed's "Big Beat Show" tour for 41 dates. In April, Decca released "<a href="That%27ll%20Be%20the%20Day%20%28album%29">That'll Be the Day</a>", featuring the songs recorded with Bradley during his early Nashville sessions.

A new recording session in Clovis was arranged in May; Holly hired <a href="Tommy%20Allsup">Tommy Allsup</a> to play lead guitar. The session produced the recordings of "<a href="It%27s%20So%20Easy%21%20%28The%20Crickets%20song%29">It's So Easy</a>" and "<a href="Heartbeat%20%28Buddy%20Holly%20song%29">Heartbeat</a>". Holly was impressed by Allsup and invited him to join the Crickets. In June, Holly traveled alone to New York for a solo recording session. Without the Crickets, he chose to be backed by a jazz and R&B band, recording "Now We're One" and <a href="Bobby%20Darin">Bobby Darin</a>'s "<a href="Early%20in%20the%20Morning%20%28Bobby%20Darin%20song%29">Early in the Morning</a>".

During a visit to the offices of <a href="Peermusic">Peer-South</a>, Holly met <a href="Mar%C3%ADa%20Elena%20Santiago">María Elena Santiago</a>. He asked her out on their first meeting and proposed marriage to her on their first date. The wedding took place on August 15. Petty disapproved of the marriage and advised Holly to keep it secret to avoid upsetting Holly's female fans. Petty's reaction created friction with Holly, who had also started to question Petty's bookkeeping. The Crickets, frustrated because he controlled all of the proceeds from the band, were also in conflict with Petty.

Holly and Santiago frequented many of New York's music venues, including the <a href="The%20Village%20Gate">Village Gate</a>, Blue Note, <a href="Village%20Vanguard">Village Vanguard</a>, and Johnny Johnson's. Santiago later said that Holly was keen to learn fingerstyle flamenco guitar and that he would often visit her aunt's home to play the piano there. Holly planned collaborations between soul singers and rock and roll. He wanted to make an album with <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a> and <a href="Mahalia%20Jackson">Mahalia Jackson</a>. He also had ambitions to work in film and registered for acting classes with Lee Strasburg's <a href="Actors%20Studio">Actors Studio</a>.

Santiago accompanied Holly on tours. To hide her marriage to Holly, she was presented as the Crickets' secretary. She took care of the laundry and equipment set-up and collected the concert revenues. Santiago kept the money for the band instead of their habitual transfer to Petty in New Mexico. She and her aunt Provi Garcia, executive of the Latin American music department at <a href="Peer-Southern">Peer-Southern</a>, convinced Holly that Petty was paying the band's royalties from Coral-Brunswick into his own company's account. Holly planned to retrieve his royalties from Petty and to later fire him as manager and producer. At the recommendation of the Everly Brothers, Holly hired lawyer Harold Orenstein to negotiate his royalties. The problems with Petty were triggered after he was unable to pay Holly. At the time, New York promoter Manny Greenfield reclaimed a large part of Holly's earnings; Greenfield had booked Holly for shows during previous tours. The two had a verbal agreement; Greenfield would obtain 5% of the booking earnings. Greenfield later felt he was also acting as Holly's manager and deserved a higher payment, which Holly refused. Greenfield then sued Holly. Under New York law, because Holly's royalties originated in New York and were directed out of the state, the payments were frozen until the dispute was settled. Petty then could not complete the transfers to Holly, who considered him responsible for the missing profit.

In September, Holly returned to Clovis for a new recording session, which yielded "Reminiscing" and "Come Back Baby". During the session, he ventured into producing by recording Lubbock DJ <a href="Waylon%20Jennings">Waylon Jennings</a>. Holly produced the single "Jole Blon" and "When Sin Stops (Love Begins)" for Jennings. Holly became increasingly interested in the New York music, recording, and publishing scene. Santiago and he settled in Apartment 4H of the Brevoort Apartments, at 11 Fifth Avenue in <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, where he recorded a series of acoustic songs, including "<a href="Crying%2C%20Waiting%2C%20Hoping">Crying, Waiting, Hoping</a>" and "What to Do". The inspiration to record the songs is sometimes attributed to the ending of his relationship with McGuire. In October, Holly recorded tracks for Coral; these were backed by saxophonist <a href="Boomie%20Richman">Boomie Richman</a> and an 18-piece orchestra composed of former members of the <a href="NBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">NBC Symphony Orchestra</a>. The three-and-a-half-hour session produced "<a href="It%20Doesn%27t%20Matter%20Anymore">It Doesn't Matter Anymore</a>", "<a href="Raining%20in%20My%20Heart">Raining in My Heart</a>", "<a href="Moondreams%20%28Norman%20Petty%20song%29">Moondreams</a>" (written by Petty), and "<a href="True%20Love%20Ways">True Love Ways</a>".

Holly ended his association with Petty in December 1958. His band members kept Petty as their manager, and Holly also split from the Crickets. Petty was still holding the money from the royalties, forcing Holly to form a new band and return to touring.

Holly vacationed with his wife in Lubbock and visited Jennings' radio station in December 1958. For the start of the <a href="Winter%20Dance%20Party">Winter Dance Party</a> tour, he assembled a band consisting of Waylon Jennings (electric bass), Tommy Allsup (guitar), and <a href="Carl%20Bunch">Carl Bunch</a> (drums). Holly and Jennings left for New York City, arriving on January 15, 1959. Jennings stayed at Holly's apartment by <a href="Washington%20Square%20Park">Washington Square Park</a> on the days prior to a meeting scheduled at the headquarters of the <a href="General%20Amusement%20Corporation">General Artists Corporation</a>, which organized the tour. They then traveled by train to Chicago to join the rest of the band.

The Winter Dance Party tour began in <a href="Milwaukee%2C%20Wisconsin">Milwaukee, Wisconsin</a>, on January 23, 1959. The amount of travel involved created logistical problems, as the distance between venues had not been considered when scheduling performances. Adding to the problem, the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, with dire consequences. Holly's drummer Carl Bunch was hospitalized for <a href="frostbite">frostbite</a> to his toes (suffered while aboard the bus), so Holly decided to seek other transportation. Before their appearance in <a href="Clear%20Lake%2C%20Iowa">Clear Lake, Iowa</a>, on February 2, Holly chartered a four-seat <a href="Beechcraft%20Bonanza">Beechcraft Bonanza</a> airplane from Dwyer Flying Service in <a href="Mason%20City%2C%20Iowa">Mason City, Iowa</a>, for Jennings, Allsup, and himself. Holly's idea was to depart following the show at the <a href="Surf%20Ballroom">Surf Ballroom</a> in Clear Lake and fly to their next venue, in <a href="Moorhead%2C%20Minnesota">Moorhead, Minnesota</a>, via <a href="Fargo%2C%20North%20Dakota">Fargo, North Dakota</a>, allowing them time to rest and launder their clothes and avoid a rigorous bus journey. Immediately after the Clear Lake show (which ended just before midnight), Allsup lost a coin toss and gave up his seat on the plane to <a href="Ritchie%20Valens">Ritchie Valens</a>, while Waylon Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to <a href="The%20Big%20Bopper">J. P. Richardson (the Big Bopper)</a>, who had influenza and complained that the tour bus was too cold and uncomfortable for a man of his size.

In the dressing room after the Clear Lake show, Allsup agreed to flip a coin for the seat with Valens. Allsup took out a brand new half-dollar, and Ritchie called heads. Heads it was. "That's the first time I've ever won anything in my life," Valens reportedly said. Allsup later opened a restaurant in <a href="Fort%20Worth%2C%20Texas">Fort Worth, Texas</a> called Heads Up.

The pilot, <a href="Roger%20Peterson%20%28pilot%29">Roger Peterson</a>, took off in inclement weather, although he was not certified to fly by <a href="instrument%20flight%20rules">instruments only</a>. Shortly after 1:00 am on February 3, 1959, Holly, Valens, Richardson, and Peterson were killed instantly when their plane crashed into a cornfield five miles northwest of the Mason City, Iowa airport shortly after take-off. The bodies of the entertainers were all ejected from the plane on impact, while Peterson's body remained entangled in the wreckage. Holly had sustained fatal trauma to his head and chest and numerous lacerations and fractures of his arms and legs.

Holly's funeral was held on February 7, 1959, at the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Lubbock. The service was officiated by Ben D. Johnson, who had presided at the Holly's wedding just months earlier. The pallbearers were Jerry Allison, Joe B. Mauldin, Niki Sullivan, Bob Montgomery, Sonny Curtis, and <a href="Phil%20Everly">Phil Everly</a>. Waylon Jennings was unable to attend, because of his commitment to the still-touring Winter Dance Party. Holly's body was interred in the City of Lubbock Cemetery, in the eastern part of the city. His headstone carries the correct spelling of his surname (Holley) and a carving of his <a href="Fender%20Stratocaster">Fender Stratocaster</a> guitar.

Maria Elena watched the first reports of Holly's death on television. The following day, she claimed, she miscarried although there is no independent source for this. Holly's mother, who heard the news on the radio in Lubbock, Texas, collapsed. Because of Maria Elena's miscarriage, in the months following the accident, the authorities implemented a policy against announcing victims' names until after families are informed. Santiago did not attend the funeral and has never visited the grave site. She later told the "Avalanche-Journal", "In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn't with him. And I blame myself because I know that, if only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane."

Holly's singing style was characterized by his vocal hiccups and his alternation between his <a href="Modal%20voice">regular voice</a> and <a href="falsetto">falsetto</a>. His "stuttering vocals" were complemented by his <a href="Percussive%20fingerstyle">percussive guitar playing</a>, solos, <a href="Double%20stop">stops</a>, <a href="bent%20note">bent note</a>s, and rhythm and blues <a href="chord%20progression">chord progression</a>s. He often strummed <a href="Downpicking">downstrokes</a> that were accompanied by Allison's "driving" percussion.

Holly bought his first Fender Stratocaster, which became his signature guitar, at Harrod Music in Lubbock for US$249.50. Fender Stratocasters were popular with country musicians; Holly chose it for its loud sound. His "innovative" playing style was characterized by its blending of "chunky rhythm" and "high string lead work". He played his first Stratocaster, a 1954 model, until it was stolen during a tour stop in <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> in 1957. To replace it, he purchased a 1957 model before a show in Detroit. Holly owned four or five Stratocasters during his career.

At the beginning of their music careers, Holly and his band wore business suits. Upon meeting the Everly Brothers, Don Everly took the band to Phil's men's shop in New York City and introduced them to <a href="Ivy%20League%20%28clothes%29">Ivy League clothes</a>. The brothers advised Holly to replace his old-fashioned glasses with <a href="horn-rimmed%20glasses">horn-rimmed glasses</a>, which had been popularized by <a href="Steve%20Allen">Steve Allen</a>. Holly bought a pair of glasses made in Mexico from Lubbock optometrist Dr. J. Davis Armistead. Teenagers in the United States started to request this style of glasses, which were later popularly known as "Buddy Holly glasses".

When the plane crashed, the wreckage was strewn across many yards of snow-covered ground. While his other belongings were recovered immediately, there was no record of his signature glasses being found. They were presumed lost until, in March 1980, they were discovered in a Cerro Gordo County courthouse storage area by Sheriff Gerald Allen. They had been found in the spring of 1959, after the snow had melted, and had been given to the sheriff's office. They were placed in an envelope dated April 7, 1959, along with the Big Bopper's watch, a lighter, two pairs of dice and part of another watch, and misplaced when the county moved courthouses. The glasses, missing their lenses, were returned to Maria Elena a year later, after a legal contest over them with his parents. They are now on display at the Buddy Holly Center in Lubbock, Texas.

"<a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>" stated that Holly "produced some of the most distinctive and influential work in rock music". <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> defined him as "the single most influential creative force in early rock and roll". "<a href="Rolling%20Stone%20%28magazine%29">Rolling Stone</a>" ranked him number 13 on its list of "100 Greatest Artists". The "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">Telegraph</a>" called him a "pioneer and a revolutionary [...] a multidimensional talent [...] (who) co-wrote and performed (songs that) remain as fresh and potent today".

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included Holly among its first class in 1986. On its entry, the Hall of Fame remarked upon the large quantity of material he produced during his short musical career, and said it "made a major and lasting impact on popular music". It called him an "innovator" for writing his own material, his experimentation with <a href="double%20tracking">double tracking</a> and the use of <a href="orchestration">orchestration</a>; he is also said to have "pioneered and popularized the now-standard" use of two guitars, bass, and drums by rock bands. <a href="The%20Songwriters%20Hall%20of%20Fame">The Songwriters Hall of Fame</a> also inducted Holly in 1986, and said his contributions "changed the face of Rock 'n' Roll". Holly developed in collaboration with Petty techniques of <a href="overdubbing">overdubbing</a> and <a href="reverberation">reverberation</a>, while he used innovative instrumentation later implemented by other artists. Holly became "one of the most influential pioneers of rock and roll" who had a "lasting influence" on genre performers of the 1960s.
In 1980, <a href="Grant%20Speed">Grant Speed</a> sculpted a statue of Holly playing his Fender guitar. This statue is the centerpiece of Lubbock's Walk of Fame, which honors notable people who contributed to Lubbock's musical history. Other memorials to Buddy Holly include a street named in his honor and the <a href="Buddy%20Holly%20Center">Buddy Holly Center</a>, which contains a museum of Holly memorabilia and fine arts gallery. The Center is located on Crickets Avenue, one street east of Buddy Holly Avenue, in a building that previously housed the Fort Worth and Denver South Plains Railway Depot. In 1997, the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Recording%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences</a> gave Holly the <a href="Grammy%20Lifetime%20Achievement%20Award">Lifetime Achievement Award</a>. Holly was inducted into the <a href="Iowa%20Rock%20%27n%27%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Iowa Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 2000. In 2010, Grant Speed's statue was taken down for refurbishment and construction of a new Walk of Fame began. On May 9, 2011, the City of Lubbock held a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the Buddy and Maria Elena Holly Plaza, the new home of the statue and the Walk of Fame. The same year, a star bearing Holly's name was placed on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>, commemorating his 75th birthday.

Groundbreaking will be held on April 20, 2017, for the construction of a new performing arts center in Lubbock, the Buddy Holly Hall of Arts and Sciences, a downtown $153 million project expected to be completed in late 2019. Thus far, the private group, the Lubbock Entertainment and Performing Arts Association, has raised or received pledges in the amount of $93 million to underwrite the project.
Teenagers <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a> and <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> saw Holly for the first time when he appeared on "<a href="Sunday%20Night%20at%20the%20London%20Palladium">Sunday Night at the London Palladium</a>". The two had recently met and begun their musical association. They studied Holly's records, learned his performance style and lyricism, and based their act around his persona. Inspired by Holly's insect-themed Crickets, they chose to name their band "<a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>". Lennon and McCartney later cited Holly as their main influence.

Lennon's band the <a href="The%20Quarrymen">Quarrymen</a> covered "That'll Be the Day" in their first recording session, in 1958. During breaks in the Beatles' first appearance on "The Ed Sullivan Show", on February 9, 1964, Lennon asked <a href="CBS">CBS</a> coordinator Vic Calandra about Holly's performances; Calandra said Lennon and McCartney repeatedly expressed their appreciation of Holly. The Beatles recorded a close cover of Holly's version of "<a href="Words%20of%20Love">Words of Love</a>", which was released on their 1964 album "<a href="Beatles%20for%20Sale">Beatles for Sale</a>" (in the U.S., in June 1965 on "<a href="Beatles%20VI">Beatles VI</a>"). During the January 1969 recording sessions for their album "<a href="Let%20It%20Be%20%28The%20Beatles%20album%29">Let It Be</a>", the Beatles played a slow, impromptu version of "Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues" – which Holly popularized but did not write – with Lennon mimicking Holly's vocal style. Lennon recorded a cover version of "Peggy Sue" on his 1975 album "<a href="Rock%20%27n%27%20Roll%20%28John%20Lennon%20album%29">Rock 'n' Roll</a>". McCartney owns the <a href="Music%20publisher%20%28popular%20music%29">publishing rights</a> to Holly's song catalogue.

Two nights before Holly's death, on January 31, 1959, 17-year-old <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> attended Holly's performance in Duluth. Dylan referred to this in his acceptance speech when he received the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Album%20of%20the%20Year">Grammy Award for Album of the Year</a> for "<a href="Time%20Out%20of%20Mind">Time Out of Mind</a>" in 1998: " ... when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at <a href="Duluth%20National%20Guard%20Armory">Duluth National Guard Armory</a> and I was three feet away from him ... and he looked at me. And I just have some sort of feeling that he was ... with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way".

<a href="Mick%20Jagger">Mick Jagger</a> saw Holly performing live in <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>, London, during a tour of England; Jagger particularly remembered Holly's performance of "Not Fade Away" – a song that also inspired <a href="Keith%20Richards">Keith Richards</a>, who modeled his early guitar playing on the track. The Rolling Stones had a hit version of the song in 1964. Richards later said, "[Holly] passed it on via the Beatles and via [the Rolling Stones] ... He's in everybody".

<a href="Don%20McLean">Don McLean</a>'s popular 1971 <a href="ballad%20%28music%29">ballad</a> "<a href="American%20Pie%20%28song%29">American Pie</a>" was inspired by Holly's death and the day of the plane crash. The song's lyric, which calls the incident "The Day the Music Died", became popularly associated with the crash. McLean's album "<a href="American%20Pie%20%28album%29">American Pie</a>" is dedicated to Holly. In 2015, McLean wrote, "Buddy Holly would have the same stature musically whether he would have lived or died, because of his accomplishments ... By the time he was 22 years old, he had recorded some 50 tracks, most of which he had written himself ... in my view and the view of many others, a hit ... Buddy Holly and the Crickets were the template for all the rock bands that followed".

<a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a> was musically influenced by Holly. At age 13, although he did not require them, John started wearing horn-rimmed glasses to imitate Holly. After eight months, the glasses diminished his vision and John had to start to wear prescription lenses on a regular basis. <a href="The%20Clash">The Clash</a> were also influenced by Holly, and referenced him in their song "Corner Soul" from the "<a href="Sandinista%21">Sandinista!</a>" album. "The Chirping Crickets" was the first album <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a> ever bought; he later saw Holly on "Sunday Night at the London Palladium". In his autobiography, Clapton recounted the first time he saw Holly and his Fender, saying, "I thought I'd died and gone to heaven ... it was like seeing an instrument from outer space and I said to myself: 'That's the future – that's what I want'".

The launch of <a href="Bobby%20Vee">Bobby Vee</a>'s successful musical career resulted from Holly's death; Vee was selected to replace Holly on the tour that continued after the plane crash. Holly's profound influence on Vee's singing style can be heard in the songs "<a href="Rubber%20Ball">Rubber Ball</a>" – the B-side of which was a cover of Holly's "Everyday" – and "Run to Him." The name of the British rock band <a href="the%20Hollies">the Hollies</a> is often claimed as a tribute to Holly; according to the band, they admired Holly, but their name was mainly inspired by sprigs of holly in evidence around Christmas 1962. In an August 24, 1978, interview with "Rolling Stone", <a href="Bruce%20Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> told <a href="Dave%20Marsh">Dave Marsh</a>, "I play Buddy Holly every night before I go on; that keeps me honest". The <a href="Grateful%20Dead">Grateful Dead</a> performed the song "Not Fade Away" in concerts.

In 2016, <a href="Richard%20Barone">Richard Barone</a> released his album "Sorrows & Promises: Greenwich Village in the 1960s", paying tribute to the new wave of singer-songwriters in the Village during that pivotal, post-Holly era. The album opens with Barone's version of "Learning the Game", one of the final songs written and recorded by Holly at his home in Greenwich Village, a week before his death.

Holly's life story inspired a Hollywood <a href="biographical%20film">biographical film</a>, "<a href="The%20Buddy%20Holly%20Story">The Buddy Holly Story</a>" (1978); its lead actor <a href="Gary%20Busey">Gary Busey</a> received a nomination for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a> for his portrayal of Holly. The film was widely criticized by the rock press, and by Holly's friends and family, for its inaccuracies. This led Paul McCartney (whose MPL Communications by then controlled the publishing rights to Buddy Holly's song catalog) to produce and host his own documentary about Holly in 1985, titled "The Real Buddy Holly Story". This video includes interviews with Keith Richards, Phil and Don Everly, Sonny Curtis, Jerry Allison, Holly's family, and McCartney, among others.

In 1987, musician <a href="Marshall%20Crenshaw">Marshall Crenshaw</a> portrayed Buddy Holly in the movie "<a href="La%20Bamba%20%28film%29">La Bamba</a>", which depicts him performing at the Surf Ballroom and boarding the fatal airplane with Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper. Crenshaw's version of "Crying, Waiting, Hoping" is featured on the "La Bamba" original motion picture soundtrack. "<a href="Buddy%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Buddy%20Holly%20Story">Buddy – The Buddy Holly Story</a>", a <a href="jukebox%20musical">jukebox musical</a> depicting Holly's life, is credited for being the first of its kind. It spawned the genre that later included "<a href="Mamma%20Mia%21">Mamma Mia!</a>" and "<a href="We%20Will%20Rock%20You%20%28musical%29">We Will Rock You</a>". The musical opened in the late 1980s and its most recent UK tour occurred in February 2011.

<a href="Steve%20Buscemi">Steve Buscemi</a> appeared as Holly in a brief cameo as a 1950s-themed restaurant employee in <a href="Quentin%20Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>'s 1994 film "<a href="Pulp%20Fiction">Pulp Fiction</a>", in which he takes Mia Wallace and Vincent Vega's orders (portrayed respectively by <a href="Uma%20Thurman">Uma Thurman</a> and <a href="John%20Travolta">John Travolta</a>).

Holly was depicted in an episode of the science-fiction television program "<a href="Quantum%20Leap">Quantum Leap</a>" titled "How the Tess Was Won"; Holly's identity is only revealed at the end of the episode. Dr. <a href="Sam%20Beckett">Sam Beckett</a> (<a href="Scott%20Bakula">Scott Bakula</a>) influences Buddy Holly to change his lyrics from "piggy, suey" to "Peggy Sue", setting up Holly's future hit song. Holly's follow up to that hit song is featured in the 1986 <a href="Francis%20Ford%20Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a> film "<a href="Peggy%20Sue%20Got%20Married">Peggy Sue Got Married</a>", in which a 43-year-old mother and housewife facing divorce played by <a href="Kathleen%20Turner">Kathleen Turner</a> is thrust back in time and given the chance to change the course of her life.

Brewing

Brewing is the production of <a href="beer">beer</a> by <a href="steeping">steeping</a> a <a href="starch">starch</a> source (commonly <a href="cereal">cereal</a> grains, the most popular of which is <a href="barley">barley</a>) in water and <a href="%23Fermenting">fermenting</a> the resulting sweet liquid with <a href="Yeast%23Beer">yeast</a>. It may be done in a <a href="brewery">brewery</a> by a commercial brewer, at home by a <a href="homebrewer">homebrewer</a>, or by a variety of traditional methods such as communally by the <a href="indigenous%20peoples%20in%20Brazil">indigenous peoples in Brazil</a> when making <a href="cauim">cauim</a>. Brewing has taken place since around the 6th millennium BC, and archaeological evidence suggests that emerging civilizations including <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a> and <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> brewed beer. Since the nineteenth century the <a href="%23brewing%20industry">brewing industry</a> has been part of most western economies.

The basic ingredients of beer are water and a <a href="Fermentation">fermentable</a> starch source such as <a href="malted%20barley">malted barley</a>. Most beer is fermented with a <a href="brewer%27s%20yeast">brewer's yeast</a> and flavoured with <a href="hops">hops</a>. Less widely used starch sources include <a href="millet">millet</a>, <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a> and <a href="cassava">cassava</a>. Secondary sources (<a href="adjuncts">adjuncts</a>), such as maize (corn), rice, or sugar, may also be used, sometimes to reduce cost, or to add a feature, such as adding wheat to aid in retaining the foamy head of the beer. The proportion of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the <a href="grain%20bill">grain bill</a>.

Steps in the brewing process include <a href="malting">malting</a>, <a href="Mill%20%28grinding%29">milling</a>, <a href="%23Mashing">mashing</a>, <a href="%23Lautering">lautering</a>, <a href="%23Boiling">boiling</a>, <a href="%23Fermenting">fermenting</a>, <a href="%23Conditioning">conditioning</a>, <a href="%23Filtering">filtering</a>, and <a href="%23Packaging">packaging</a>. There are three main fermentation methods, <a href="%23Warm%20fermenting">warm</a>, <a href="%23Cool%20fermenting">cool</a> and <a href="%23Spontaneous%20fermentation">spontaneous</a>. Fermentation may take place in an open or closed fermenting vessel; a secondary fermentation may also occur in the <a href="cask%20ale">cask</a> or <a href="%23Bottle%20conditioning">bottle</a>. There are several additional <a href="brewing%20methods">brewing methods</a>, such as barrel aging, double dropping, and Yorkshire Square.

Brewing has taken place since around the 6th millennium BC, and archaeological evidence suggests emerging civilizations including <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a> and <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> brewed beer. Descriptions of various beer recipes can be found in <a href="cuneiform">cuneiform</a> (the oldest known writing) from ancient <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. In Mesopotamia the brewer's craft was the only profession which derived social sanction and divine protection from female deities/goddesses, specifically: <a href="Ninkasi">Ninkasi</a>, who covered the production of beer, <a href="Siris%20%28goddess%29">Siris</a>, who was used in a metonymic way to refer to beer, and <a href="Siduri">Siduri</a>, who covered the enjoyment of beer. <a href="Ethnography">Ethnographic studies</a> and <a href="archaeological%20record">archaeological record</a>s indicate that brewing alcohol was primary an activity engaged in by <a href="Women%20in%20brewing">women</a>, until the industrialization of brewing began.

As almost any cereal containing certain sugars can undergo spontaneous <a href="Brewing%23Fermenting">fermentation</a> due to wild yeasts in the air, it is possible that beer-like beverages were independently developed throughout the world soon after a tribe or culture had domesticated cereal. Chemical tests of ancient pottery jars reveal that beer was produced as far back as about 7,000 years ago in what is today Iran. This discovery reveals one of the earliest known uses of fermentation and is the earliest evidence of brewing to date. In Mesopotamia, the oldest evidence of beer is believed to be a 6,000-year-old Sumerian tablet depicting people drinking a beverage through reed straws from a communal bowl. A 3900-year-old Sumerian poem honouring <a href="Ninkasi">Ninkasi</a>, the patron goddess of brewing, contains the oldest surviving beer recipe, describing the production of <a href="beer">beer</a> from barley via bread. The invention of bread and beer has been argued to be responsible for humanity's ability to develop technology and build civilization. The earliest chemically confirmed barley beer to date was discovered at <a href="Godin%20Tepe">Godin Tepe</a> in the central <a href="Zagros%20Mountains">Zagros Mountains</a> of Iran, where fragments of a jug, at least 5,000 years old was found to be coated with <a href="beerstone">beerstone</a>, a by-product of the brewing process. Beer may have been known in <a href="Neolithic%20Europe">Neolithic Europe</a> as far back as 5,000 years ago, and was mainly brewed on a domestic scale.

Ale produced before the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD beer was also being produced and sold by European <a href="monasteries">monasteries</a>. During the Industrial Revolution, the production of beer moved from <a href="artisan">artisan</a>al manufacture to <a href="Manufacturing">industrial manufacture</a>, and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the 19th century. The development of <a href="hydrometer">hydrometer</a>s and <a href="thermometer">thermometer</a>s changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process, and greater knowledge of the results. Today, the brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant <a href="Multinational%20corporation">multinational companies</a> and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from <a href="brewpub">brewpub</a>s to <a href="regional%20brewery">regional breweries</a>. More than 133 billion litres (35 billion gallons) are sold per year—producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (£147.7 billion) in 2006.

The basic ingredients of beer are water; a starch source, such as <a href="malt">malt</a>ed <a href="barley">barley</a>, able to be fermented (converted into alcohol); a <a href="brewer%27s%20yeast">brewer's yeast</a> to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring, such as <a href="hops">hops</a>, to offset the sweetness of the malt. A mixture of starch sources may be used, with a secondary saccharide, such as maize (corn), rice, or sugar, often being termed an <a href="adjunct%20%28beer%29">adjunct</a>, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for malted barley. Less widely used starch sources include <a href="millet">millet</a>, <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a>, and <a href="cassava">cassava</a> root in Africa, potato in Brazil, and <a href="agave">agave</a> in Mexico, among others. The amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the <a href="grain%20bill">grain bill</a>.

Beer is composed mostly of water. Regions have water with different mineral components; as a result, different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer, thus giving them a regional character. For example, <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> has <a href="hard%20water">hard water</a> well suited to making <a href="stout">stout</a>, such as <a href="Guinness">Guinness</a>; while <a href="Plze%C5%88">Pilsen</a> has soft water well suited to making <a href="pale%20lager">pale lager</a>, such as <a href="Pilsner%20Urquell">Pilsner Urquell</a>. The waters of <a href="Burton%20upon%20Trent%20brewing">Burton</a> in England contain <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a>, which benefits making <a href="pale%20ale">pale ale</a> to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as <a href="Burtonisation">Burtonisation</a>.


The starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin <a href="germination">germination</a>, and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that will allow conversion from starches in the grain into fermentable sugars during the mash process. Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.

Nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch. This is because of its fibrous husk, which is important not only in the sparging stage of brewing (in which water is washed over the <a href="Mashing">mashed</a> barley grains to form the <a href="Wort%20%28brewing%29">wort</a>) but also as a rich source of <a href="amylase">amylase</a>, a <a href="digestion">digestive</a> <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> that facilitates conversion of starch into sugars. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and <a href="rye">rye</a>, and, less frequently, maize (corn) and sorghum) may be used. In recent years, a few brewers have produced <a href="gluten-free%20beer">gluten-free beer</a> made with sorghum with no barley malt for people who cannot digest <a href="gluten">gluten</a>-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.


Hops are the female flower clusters or seed cones of the hop vine "<a href="Humulus%20lupulus">Humulus lupulus</a>", which are used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today. Hops had been used for medicinal and food flavouring purposes since Roman times; by the 7th century in <a href="Carolingian%20dynasty">Carolingian</a> monasteries in what is now Germany, beer was being made with hops, though it isn't until the thirteenth century that widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is recorded. Before the thirteenth century, beer was flavoured with plants such as <a href="Achillea%20millefolium">yarrow</a>, <a href="Rhododendron%20tomentosum">wild rosemary</a>, and <a href="Myrica%20gale">bog myrtle</a>, and other ingredients such as <a href="Juniper%20berry">juniper berries</a>, <a href="aniseed">aniseed</a> and <a href="ginger">ginger</a>, which would be combined into a mixture known as <a href="gruit">gruit</a> and used as hops are now used; between the thirteenth and the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer flavoured with gruit was known as ale, while beer flavoured with hops was known as beer. Some beers today, such as "Fraoch" by the Scottish <a href="Williams%20Bros%20Brewing%20Co">Heather Ales company</a> and "Cervoise Lancelot" by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for flavouring.

Hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer: they contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt; they provide floral, citrus, and herbal aromas and flavours; they have an <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a> effect that favours the activity of <a href="brewer%27s%20yeast">brewer's yeast</a> over less desirable microorganisms; and they aid in "head retention", the length of time that a <a href="Head%20%28beer%29">foamy head</a> will last. The preservative in hops comes from the lupulin glands which contain soft resins with alpha and beta acids. Though much studied, the preservative nature of the soft resins is not yet fully understood, though it has been observed that unless stored at a cool temperature, the preservative nature will decrease. Brewing is the sole major commercial use of hops.


Yeast is the <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a> that is responsible for fermentation in beer. Yeast <a href="metabolism">metabolises</a> the sugars extracted from grains, which produces <a href="Ethanol">alcohol</a> and <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, and thereby turns <a href="wort">wort</a> into beer. In addition to fermenting the beer, yeast influences the character and flavour.
The dominant types of yeast used to make beer are "<a href="Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a>", known as ale yeast, and "<a href="Saccharomyces%20pastorianus">Saccharomyces pastorianus</a>", known as lager yeast; "<a href="Brettanomyces">Brettanomyces</a>" ferments <a href="lambic">lambic</a>s, and "<a href="Torulaspora%20delbrueckii">Torulaspora delbrueckii</a>" ferments Bavarian <a href="weissbier">weissbier</a>. Before the role of yeast in fermentation was understood, fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts, and a few styles such as <a href="lambic">lambic</a>s still use this method today. <a href="Emil%20Christian%20Hansen">Emil Christian Hansen</a>, a Danish biochemist employed by the <a href="Carlsberg%20Laboratory">Carlsberg Laboratory</a>, developed pure yeast <a href="Microbiological%20culture">cultures</a> which were introduced into the Carlsberg brewery in 1883, and pure yeast strains are now the main fermenting source used worldwide.


Some brewers add one or more <a href="clarifying%20agent">clarifying agent</a>s to beer, which typically <a href="Precipitation%20%28chemistry%29">precipitate</a> (collect as a solid) out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product. This process makes the beer appear <a href="Bright%20beer">bright</a> and clean, rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as <a href="wheat%20beer">wheat beer</a>s.

Examples of clarifying agents include <a href="isinglass">isinglass</a>, obtained from <a href="swimbladder">swimbladder</a>s of fish; <a href="Chondrus%20crispus">Irish moss</a>, a seaweed; kappa <a href="carrageenan">carrageenan</a>, from the seaweed "<a href="Kappaphycus%20cottonii">Kappaphycus cottonii</a>"; <a href="Polyclar">Polyclar</a> (artificial); and <a href="gelatin">gelatin</a>. If a beer is marked "suitable for Vegans", it was generally clarified either with seaweed or with artificial agents, although the "Fast Cask" method invented by <a href="Marston%27s%20plc">Marston's</a> in 2009 may provide another method.

There are several steps in the brewing process, which may include malting, mashing, lautering, <a href="%23Boiling">boiling</a>, <a href="fermentation%20%28food%29">fermenting</a>, <a href="%23Conditioning">conditioning</a>, <a href="%23Filtering">filtering</a>, and <a href="%23Packaging">packaging</a>.

<a href="Malting">Malting</a> is the process where barley grain is made ready for brewing. Malting is broken down into three steps in order to help to release the starches in the barley. First, during steeping, the grain is added to a vat with water and allowed to soak for approximately 40 hours. During <a href="germination">germination</a>, the grain is spread out on the floor of the germination room for around 5 days. The final part of malting is kilning when the malt goes through a very high temperature drying in a kiln; with gradual temperature increase over several hours.

When kilning is complete, the grains are now termed <a href="malt">malt</a>, and they will be milled or crushed to break apart the kernels and expose the <a href="cotyledon">cotyledon</a>, which contains the majority of the carbohydrates and sugars; this makes it easier to extract the sugars during mashing. Milling also separates the seed from the <a href="husk">husk</a>. Care must be taken when milling to ensure that the starch reserves are sufficiently milled without damaging the husk and providing coarse enough grits that a good filter bed can be formed during lautering. Grains are typically dry-milled with <a href="roller%20mill">roller mill</a>s or <a href="hammer%20mill">hammer mill</a>s. Hammer mills, which produce a very fine mash, are often used when mash filters are going to be employed in the lautering process because the grain does not have to form its own filter bed. In modern plants, the grain is often conditioned with water before it is milled to make the husk more pliable, thus reducing breakage and improving lauter speed.

<a href="Mashing">Mashing</a> converts the starches released during the malting stage into sugars that can be fermented. The milled grain is mixed with hot water in a large vessel known as a <a href="mash%20tun">mash tun</a>. In this vessel, the grain and water are mixed together to create a cereal mash. During the mash, naturally occurring enzymes present in the malt convert the starches (long chain carbohydrates) in the grain into smaller molecules or simple sugars (mono-, di-, and tri-saccharides). This "conversion" is called <a href="saccharification">saccharification</a>. The result of the mashing process is a sugar-rich liquid or <a href="Wort%20%28brewing%29">"wort"</a>, which is then strained through the bottom of the mash tun in a process known as <a href="lautering">lautering</a>. Prior to lautering, the mash temperature may be raised to about (known as a mashout) to free up more starch and reduce mash viscosity. Additional water may be sprinkled on the grains to extract additional sugars (a process known as <a href="Sparging%20%28beer%29">sparging</a>).

The wort is moved into a large tank known as a "copper" or <a href="kettle">kettle</a> where it is boiled with <a href="hops">hops</a> and sometimes other ingredients such as herbs or sugars. This stage is where many chemical and technical reactions take place, and where important decisions about the flavour, colour, and aroma of the beer are made. The boiling process serves to terminate enzymatic processes, <a href="Precipitation%20%28chemistry%29">precipitate</a> proteins, <a href="isomerization">isomerize</a> hop <a href="resin">resin</a>s, and concentrate and <a href="sterilization%20%28microbiology%29">sterilize</a> the wort. Hops add flavour, <a href="odor">aroma</a> and <a href="Bitter%20%28taste%29">bitterness</a> to the beer. At the end of the boil, the hopped wort settles to clarify in a vessel called a "whirlpool", where the more solid particles in the wort are separated out.

After the whirlpool, the wort is drawn away from the compacted hop trub, and rapidly cooled via a <a href="heat%20exchanger">heat exchanger</a> to a temperature where yeast can be added. A variety of heat exchanger designs are used in breweries, with the most common a plate-style. Water or glycol run in channels in the opposite direction of the wort, causing a rapid drop in temperature. It is very important to quickly cool the wort to a level where yeast can be added safely as yeast is unable to grow in very high temperatures, and will start to die in temperatures above . After the wort goes through the heat exchanger, the cooled wort goes into a fermentation tank. A type of yeast is selected and added, or "pitched", to the fermentation tank. When the yeast is added to the wort, the fermenting process begins, where the sugars turn into alcohol, <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and other components. When the fermentation is complete the brewer may rack the beer into a new tank, called a conditioning tank. Conditioning of the beer is the process in which the beer ages, the flavour becomes smoother, and flavours that are unwanted dissipate. After conditioning for a week to several months, the beer may be <a href="Filtered%20beer">filtered</a> and <a href="carbonation">force carbonated</a> for bottling, or <a href="Finings">fined</a> in the <a href="Cask%20ale">cask</a>.

Mashing is the process of combining a mix of milled grain (typically <a href="malt">malt</a>ed <a href="barley">barley</a> with <a href="Adjuncts">supplementary grains</a> such as <a href="Maize">corn</a>, <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a>, <a href="rye">rye</a> or wheat), known as the "<a href="grain%20bill">grain bill</a>", and water, known as "liquor", and heating this mixture in a vessel called a "mash tun". Mashing is a form of steeping, and defines the act of brewing, such as with making tea, <a href="sake">sake</a>, and <a href="soy%20sauce">soy sauce</a>. Technically, wine, <a href="cider">cider</a> and <a href="mead">mead</a> are not brewed but rather <a href="vinified">vinified</a>, as there is no steeping process involving solids. Mashing allows the <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s in the malt to break down the <a href="starch">starch</a> in the grain into sugars, typically <a href="maltose">maltose</a> to create a malty liquid called <a href="wort">wort</a>. There are two main methods – <a href="infusion">infusion</a> mashing, in which the grains are heated in one vessel; and <a href="decoction">decoction</a> mashing, in which a proportion of the grains are boiled and then returned to the mash, raising the temperature. Mashing involves pauses at certain temperatures (notably ), and takes place in a "mash tun" – an insulated brewing vessel with a <a href="false%20bottom">false bottom</a>. The end product of mashing is called a "mash".

Mashing usually takes 1 to 2 hours, and during this time the various temperature rests activate different enzymes depending upon the type of malt being used, its modification level, and the intention of the brewer. The activity of these enzymes convert the starches of the grains to <a href="dextrin">dextrin</a>s and then to fermentable sugars such as <a href="maltose">maltose</a>. A mash rest from activates various <a href="protease">protease</a>s, which break down proteins that might otherwise cause the beer to be hazy. This rest is generally used only with undermodified (i.e. undermalted) malts which are decreasingly popular in Germany and the Czech Republic, or non-malted grains such as <a href="maize">corn</a> and rice, which are widely used in North American beers. A mash rest at activates β-<a href="glucanase">glucanase</a>, which breaks down gummy β-glucans in the mash, making the sugars flow out more freely later in the process. In the modern mashing process, commercial fungal based β-glucanase may be added as a supplement. Finally, a mash rest temperature of is used to convert the starches in the malt to sugar, which is then usable by the yeast later in the brewing process. Doing the latter rest at the lower end of the range favours <a href="%CE%B2-amylase">β-amylase</a> enzymes, producing more low-order sugars like <a href="maltotriose">maltotriose</a>, <a href="maltose">maltose</a>, and <a href="glucose">glucose</a> which are more fermentable by the <a href="yeast">yeast</a>. This in turn creates a beer lower in body and higher in alcohol. A rest closer to the higher end of the range favours <a href="%CE%B1-amylase">α-amylase</a> enzymes, creating more higher-order sugars and <a href="dextrin">dextrin</a>s which are less fermentable by the yeast, so a fuller-bodied beer with less alcohol is the result. Duration and <a href="pH">pH</a> variances also affect the sugar composition of the resulting wort.

Lautering is the separation of the <a href="Wort%20%28brewing%29">wort</a> (the liquid containing the sugar extracted during mashing) from the grains. This is done either in a mash tun outfitted with a false bottom, in a lauter tun, or in a mash filter. Most separation processes have two stages: first wort run-off, during which the extract is separated in an undiluted state from the spent grains, and <a href="Sparging%20%28beer%29">sparging</a>, in which extract which remains with the grains is rinsed off with hot water. The lauter tun is a tank with holes in the bottom small enough to hold back the large bits of grist and hulls. The bed of grist that settles on it is the actual filter. Some lauter tuns have provision for rotating <a href="mash%20rake">rakes</a> or knives to cut into the bed of grist to maintain good flow. The knives can be turned so they push the grain, a feature used to drive the spent grain out of the vessel. The mash filter is a plate-and-frame filter. The empty frames contain the mash, including the spent grains, and have a capacity of around one hectoliter. The plates contain a support structure for the filter cloth. The plates, frames, and filter cloths are arranged in a carrier frame like so: frame, cloth, plate, cloth, with plates at each end of the structure. Newer mash filters have bladders that can press the liquid out of the grains between spargings. The grain does not act like a filtration medium in a mash filter.

After mashing, the beer <a href="wort">wort</a> is boiled with <a href="hops">hops</a> (and other flavourings if used) in a large tank known as a "copper" or brew kettle – though historically the mash vessel was used and is still in some small breweries. The boiling process is where chemical and technical reactions take place, including <a href="sterilization%20%28microbiology%29">sterilization</a> of the wort to remove unwanted bacteria, releasing of hop flavours, bitterness and aroma compounds through <a href="isomerization">isomerization</a>, stopping of enzymatic processes, <a href="Precipitation%20%28chemistry%29">precipitation</a> of proteins, and concentration of the wort. Finally, the vapours produced during the boil volatilise <a href="off-flavours">off-flavours</a>, including <a href="dimethyl%20sulfide">dimethyl sulfide</a> precursors. The boil is conducted so that it is even and intense – a continuous "rolling boil". The boil on average lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, depending on its intensity, the hop addition schedule, and volume of water the brewer expects to evaporate. At the end of the boil, solid particles in the hopped wort are separated out, usually in a vessel called a "whirlpool".

Copper is the traditional material for the boiling vessel, because copper transfers heat quickly and evenly, and because the bubbles produced during boiling, and which would act as an insulator against the heat, do not cling to the surface of copper, so the wort is heated in a consistent manner. The simplest boil kettles are direct-fired, with a burner underneath. These can produce a vigorous and favourable boil, but are also apt to scorch the wort where the flame touches the kettle, causing caramelisation and making cleanup difficult. Most breweries use a steam-fired kettle, which uses steam jackets in the kettle to boil the wort. Breweries usually have a boiling unit either inside or outside of the kettle, usually a tall, thin cylinder with vertical tubes, called a calandria, through which wort is pumped.

At the end of the boil, solid particles in the hopped wort are separated out, usually in a vessel called a "whirlpool" or "settling tank". The whirlpool was devised by Henry Ranulph Hudston while working for the <a href="Molson%20Brewery">Molson Brewery</a> in 1960 to utilise the so-called <a href="tea%20leaf%20paradox">tea leaf paradox</a> to force the denser solids known as "trub" (coagulated proteins, vegetable matter from hops) into a cone in the centre of the whirlpool tank. Whirlpool systems vary: smaller breweries tend to use the brew kettle, larger breweries use a separate tank, and design will differ, with tank floors either flat, sloped, conical or with a cup in the centre. The principle in all is that by swirling the wort the <a href="centripetal%20force">centripetal force</a> will push the trub into a cone at the centre of the bottom of the tank, where it can be easily removed.

A hopback is a traditional additional chamber that acts as a sieve or filter by using whole <a href="hops">hops</a> to clear debris (or "<a href="Trub%20%28brewing%29">trub</a>") from the unfermented (or "green") <a href="wort">wort</a>, as the whirlpool does, and also to increase hop aroma in the finished beer. It is a chamber between the brewing kettle and wort chiller. Hops are added to the chamber, the hot wort from the kettle is run through it, and then immediately cooled in the wort chiller before entering the fermentation chamber. Hopbacks utilizing a sealed chamber facilitate maximum retention of volatile hop aroma compounds that would normally be driven off when the hops contact the hot wort. While a hopback has a similar filtering effect as a whirlpool, it operates differently: a whirlpool uses centrifugal forces, a hopback uses a layer of whole hops to act as a filter bed. Furthermore, while a whirlpool is useful only for the removal of pelleted hops (as flowers do not tend to separate as easily), in general hopbacks are used only for the removal of whole flower hops (as the particles left by pellets tend to make it through the hopback). The hopback has mainly been substituted in modern breweries by the whirlpool.

After the whirlpool, the wort must be brought down to fermentation temperatures before yeast is added. In modern breweries this is achieved through a plate <a href="heat%20exchanger">heat exchanger</a>. A plate heat exchanger has many ridged plates, which form two separate paths. The wort is pumped into the heat exchanger, and goes through every other gap between the plates. The cooling medium, usually water, goes through the other gaps. The ridges in the plates ensure turbulent flow. A good heat exchanger can drop wort to while warming the cooling medium from about to . The last few plates often use a cooling medium which can be cooled to below the <a href="freezing%20point">freezing point</a>, which allows a finer control over the wort-out temperature, and also enables cooling to around . After cooling, oxygen is often dissolved into the wort to revitalize the yeast and aid its reproduction.

While boiling, it is useful to recover some of the energy used to boil the wort. On its way out of the brewery, the steam created during the boil is passed over a coil through which unheated water flows. By adjusting the rate of flow, the output temperature of the water can be controlled. This is also often done using a plate heat exchanger. The water is then stored for later use in the next mash, in equipment cleaning, or wherever necessary. Another common method of energy recovery takes place during the wort cooling. When cold water is used to cool the wort in a heat exchanger, the water is significantly warmed. In an efficient brewery, cold water is passed through the heat exchanger at a rate set to maximize the water's temperature upon exiting. This now-hot water is then stored in a hot water tank.

<a href="Fermentation">Fermentation</a> takes place in fermentation vessels which come in various forms, from enormous cylindroconical vessels, through open stone vessels, to wooden vats. After the wort is cooled and <a href="aerated">aerated</a> – usually with <a href="Asepsis">sterile</a> air – yeast is added to it, and it begins to ferment. It is during this stage that sugars won from the <a href="malt">malt</a> are converted into alcohol and <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>, and the product can be called beer for the first time.

Most breweries today use cylindroconical vessels, or CCVs, which have a conical bottom and a cylindrical top. The cone's <a href="aperture">aperture</a> is typically around 60°, an angle that will allow the yeast to flow towards the cone's apex, but is not so steep as to take up too much vertical space. CCVs can handle both fermenting and conditioning in the same tank. At the end of fermentation, the yeast and other solids which have fallen to the cone's apex can be simply flushed out of a port at the apex. Open fermentation vessels are also used, often for show in brewpubs, and in Europe in wheat beer fermentation. These vessels have no tops, which makes harvesting top-fermenting yeasts very easy. The open tops of the vessels make the risk of infection greater, but with proper cleaning procedures and careful protocol about who enters fermentation chambers, the risk can be well controlled. Fermentation tanks are typically made of stainless steel. If they are simple cylindrical tanks with beveled ends, they are arranged vertically, as opposed to conditioning tanks which are usually laid out horizontally. Only a very few breweries still use wooden vats for fermentation as wood is difficult to keep clean and infection-free and must be repitched more or less yearly.

There are three main fermentation methods, <a href="%23Warm%20fermentation">warm</a>, <a href="%23Cool%20fermentation">cool</a> and <a href="%23Spontaneous%20fermentation">wild or spontaneous</a>. Fermentation may take place in open or closed vessels. There may be a secondary fermentation which can take place in the brewery, in the <a href="cask%20ale">cask</a> or in the <a href="%23Bottle%20conditioning">bottle</a>.

Brewing yeasts are traditionally classed as "top-cropping" (or "top-fermenting") and "bottom-cropping" (or "bottom-fermenting"). Yeast were termed top or bottom cropping, because in traditional brewing yeast was collected from the top or bottom of the fermenting wort to be reused for the next brew. This terminology is somewhat inappropriate in the modern era; after the widespread application of brewing mycology it was discovered that the two separate collecting methods involved two different yeast species that favoured different temperature regimes, namely "Saccharomyces cerevisiae" in top-cropping at warmer temperatures and "Saccharomyces pastorianus" in bottom-cropping at cooler temperatures. As brewing methods changed in the 20th century, cylindro-conical fermenting vessels became the norm and the collection of yeast for both "Saccharomyces" species is done from the bottom of the fermenter, thus the method of collection no longer implies a species association. There are a few remaining breweries who collect yeast in the top-cropping method, such as Samuel Smiths brewery in Yorkshire, Marstons in Staffordshire and several German hefeweizen producers.

For both types, yeast is fully distributed through the beer while it is fermenting, and both equally <a href="yeast%20flocculation">flocculate</a> (clump together and precipitate to the bottom of the vessel) when fermentation is finished. By no means do all top-cropping yeasts demonstrate this behaviour, but it features strongly in many English yeasts that may also exhibit chain forming (the failure of budded cells to break from the mother cell), which is in the technical sense different from true flocculation. The most common top-cropping brewer's yeast, "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", is the same species as the common baking yeast. However, baking and brewing yeasts typically belong to different strains, cultivated to favour different characteristics: baking yeast strains are more aggressive, in order to carbonate <a href="dough">dough</a> in the shortest amount of time; brewing yeast strains act slower, but tend to tolerate higher alcohol concentrations (normally 12–15% <a href="Alcohol%20by%20volume">abv</a> is the maximum, though under special treatment some ethanol-tolerant strains can be coaxed up to around 20%). Modern quantitative genomics has revealed the complexity of "Saccharomyces" species to the extent that yeasts involved in beer and wine production commonly involve hybrids of so-called pure species. As such, the yeasts involved in what has been typically called top-cropping or top-fermenting ale may be both "Saccharomyces cerevisiae" and complex hybrids of "Saccharomyces cerevisiae" and "Saccharomyces kudriavzevii". Three notable ales, <a href="Chimay%20Brewery">Chimay</a>, <a href="Orval%20Brewery%23Beers">Orval</a> and <a href="Westmalle%20Brewery">Westmalle</a>, are fermented with these hybrid strains, which are identical to wine yeasts from Switzerland.

In general, yeasts such as "<a href="Saccharomyces%20cerevisiae">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</a>" are fermented at warm temperatures between , occasionally as high as , while the yeast used by <a href="Dupont%20Brewery">Brasserie Dupont</a> for <a href="saison">saison</a> ferments even higher at . They generally form a foam on the surface of the fermenting beer, which is called <a href="barm">barm</a>, as during the fermentation process its <a href="hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a> surface causes the flocs to adhere to CO and rise; because of this, they are often referred to as "top-cropping" or "top-fermenting" – though this distinction is less clear in modern brewing with the use of cylindro-conical tanks. Generally, warm-fermented beers, which are usually termed <a href="ale">ale</a>, are ready to drink within three weeks after the beginning of fermentation, although some brewers will condition them for several months.

When a beer has been brewed using a cool fermentation of around , compared to typical warm fermentation temperatures of , then stored (or lagered) for typically several weeks (or months) at temperatures close to <a href="freezing">freezing</a> point, it is termed a "<a href="lager">lager</a>". During the lagering or storage phase several flavour components developed during fermentation dissipate, resulting in a "cleaner" flavour. Though it is the slow, cool fermentation and cold conditioning (or lagering) that defines the character of lager, the main technical difference is with the yeast generally used, which is "<a href="Saccharomyces%20pastorianus">Saccharomyces pastorianus</a>". Technical differences include the ability of lager yeast to metabolize <a href="melibiose">melibiose</a>, and the tendency to settle at the bottom of the fermenter (though ales yeasts can also become bottom settling by selection); though these technical differences are not considered by scientists to be influential in the character or flavour of the finished beer, brewers feel otherwise - sometimes cultivating their own yeast strains which may suit their brewing equipment or for a particular purpose, such as brewing beers with a high abv.

Brewers in <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> had for centuries been selecting cold-fermenting yeasts by storing ("lagern") their beers in cold alpine caves. The process of natural selection meant that the wild yeasts that were most cold tolerant would be the ones that would remain actively fermenting in the beer that was stored in the caves. A sample of these Bavarian yeasts was sent from the Spaten brewery in Munich to the Carlsberg brewery in Copenhagen in 1845 who began brewing with it. In 1883 Emile Hansen completed a study on pure yeast culture isolation and the pure strain obtained from Spaten went into industrial production in 1884 as Carlsberg yeast No 1. Another specialized pure yeast production plant was soon installed at the Heineken Brewery in Rotterdam the following year and together they began the supply of pure cultured yeast to brewers across Europe. This yeast strain was originally classified as "Saccharomyces carlsbergensis", a now defunct species name which has been superseded by the currently accepted taxonomic classification "Saccharomyces pastorianus".

<a href="Lambic">Lambic</a> beers are historically brewed in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> and the nearby <a href="Pajottenland">Pajottenland</a> region of Belgium without any yeast inoculation. They are fermented in oak barrels with the resident microbiota present in the wood and can take up to 2 years to come into condition for sale. However, with the advent of yeast banks and England's <a href="National%20Collection%20of%20Yeast%20Cultures">National Collection of Yeast Cultures</a>, brewing these beers – albeit not through spontaneous fermentation – is possible anywhere. Specific bacteria cultures are also available to reproduce certain styles. "<a href="Brettanomyces">Brettanomyces</a>" is a genus of yeast important in brewing <a href="lambic">lambic</a>, a beer produced not by the deliberate addition of brewer's yeasts, but by spontaneous fermentation with wild yeasts and bacteria.

After an initial or primary fermentation, beer is "conditioned", matured or aged, in one of several ways, which can take from 2 to 4 weeks, several months, or several years, depending on the brewer's intention for the beer. The beer is usually transferred into a second container, so that it is no longer exposed to the dead yeast and other debris (also known as "trub") that have settled to the bottom of the primary fermenter. This prevents the formation of unwanted flavours and harmful compounds such as <a href="acetylaldehyde">acetylaldehyde</a>.

Kräusening is a conditioning method in which fermenting <a href="wort">wort</a> is added to the finished beer. The active yeast will restart fermentation in the finished beer, and so introduce fresh carbon dioxide; the conditioning tank will be then sealed so that the carbon dioxide is dissolved into the beer producing a lively "condition" or level of carbonation. The kräusening method may also be used to condition bottled beer.

<a href="Lager">Lager</a>s are stored at near freezing temperatures for 1–6 months while still on the yeast. The process of storing, or conditioning, or maturing, or aging a beer at a low temperature for a long period is called "lagering", and while it is associated with lagers, the process may also be done with ales, with the same result – that of cleaning up various chemicals, acids and compounds.

During secondary fermentation, most of the remaining yeast will settle to the bottom of the second fermenter, yielding a less hazy product.

Some beers undergo an additional fermentation in the bottle giving natural carbonation. This may be a second or third fermentation. They are bottled with a viable yeast population in suspension. If there is no residual fermentable sugar left, sugar or <a href="wort%20%28brewing%29">wort</a> or both may be added in a process known as priming. The resulting fermentation generates <a href="carbon%20dioxide">CO</a> that is trapped in the bottle, remaining in solution and providing natural carbonation. Bottle-conditioned beers may be either filled unfiltered direct from the fermentation or conditioning tank, or filtered and then reseeded with yeast.

Cask ale or cask-conditioned beer is <a href="filtration">unfiltered</a> and <a href="pasteurization">unpasteurised</a> beer that is conditioned (including secondary fermentation) and served from a cask, either pumped up from a cellar via a <a href="beer%20engine">beer engine</a> (hand pump), or from a tap by gravity. Sometimes a <a href="cask%20breather">cask breather</a> is used to keep the beer fresh by allowing carbon dioxide to replace oxygen as the beer is drawn off the cask. The term "<a href="real%20ale">real ale</a>" as used by the <a href="Campaign%20for%20Real%20Ale">Campaign for Real Ale</a> (CAMRA) refers to beer "served without the use of <a href="carbonation">extraneous carbon dioxide</a>", which would disallow the use of a cask breather.

Filtering the beer stabilizes the flavour, and gives beer its polished shine and brilliance. Not all beer is filtered. When tax determination is required by local laws, it is typically done at this stage in a calibrated tank. There are several forms of filters, they may be in the form of sheets or "candles", or they may be a fine powder such as <a href="diatomaceous%20earth">diatomaceous earth</a>, also called kieselguhr. The powder is added to the beer and recirculated past screens to form a filtration bed.

Filters range from rough filters that remove much of the yeast and any solids (e.g., hops, grain particles) left in the beer, to filters tight enough to strain colour and body from the beer. Filtration ratings are divided into rough, fine, and sterile. Rough filtration leaves some cloudiness in the beer, but it is noticeably clearer than unfiltered beer. Fine filtration removes almost all cloudiness. Sterile filtration removes almost all microorganisms.

These filters use sheets that allow only particles smaller than a given size to pass through. The sheets are placed into a filtering frame, sanitized (with boiling water, for example) and then used to filter the beer. The sheets can be flushed if the filter becomes blocked. The sheets are usually disposable and are replaced between filtration sessions. Often the sheets contain powdered filtration media to aid in filtration.

Pre-made filters have two sides. One with loose holes, and the other with tight holes. Flow goes from the side with loose holes to the side with the tight holes, with the intent that large particles get stuck in the large holes while leaving enough room around the particles and filter medium for smaller particles to go through and get stuck in tighter holes.

Sheets are sold in nominal ratings, and typically 90% of particles larger than the nominal rating are caught by the sheet.
Filters that use a powder medium are considerably more complicated to operate, but can filter much more beer before regeneration. Common media include <a href="diatomaceous%20earth">diatomaceous earth</a> and <a href="perlite">perlite</a>.

Packaging is putting the beer into the containers in which it will leave the brewery. Typically, this means putting the beer into bottles, aluminium cans, <a href="keg">keg</a>s, or casks, but it may include putting the beer into bulk tanks for high-volume customers.

Brewing by-products are "spent grain" and the sediment (or "<a href="Sediment%23Dregs">dregs</a>") from the filtration process which may be dried and resold as "brewers dried yeast" for poultry feed, or made into <a href="yeast%20extract">yeast extract</a> which is used in brands such as <a href="Vegemite">Vegemite</a> and <a href="Marmite">Marmite</a>. The process of turning the yeast sediment into edible yeast extract was discovered by German scientist <a href="Justus%20Liebig">Justus Liebig</a>.

Brewer's spent grain (also called spent grain, brewer's grain or draff) is the main by-product of the brewing process, it consists of the residue of malt and grain which remains in the mash-kettle after the mashing and lautering process. It consists primarily of grain husks, <a href="pericarp">pericarp</a>, and fragments of <a href="endosperm">endosperm</a>. As it mainly consists of <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s and <a href="protein">protein</a>s, and is readily consumed by animals, spent grain is used in <a href="animal%20feed">animal feed</a>. Spent grains can also be used as <a href="fertilizer">fertilizer</a>, whole grains in bread, as well as in the production of <a href="biogas">biogas</a>. Spent grain is also an ideal medium for growing <a href="Edible%20mushroom">mushrooms</a>, such as <a href="shiitake">shiitake</a>, and already some breweries are either growing their own mushrooms or supplying spent grain to mushroom farms. Spent grains can be used in the production of red bricks, to improve the open porosity and reduce thermal conductivity of the ceramic mass.

The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant <a href="Multinational%20corporation">multinational companies</a> and many thousands of smaller producers known as <a href="microbrewery">microbreweries</a> or regional breweries depending on size and region. More than are sold per year—producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (£147.7 billion) as of 2006. <a href="SABMiller">SABMiller</a> became the largest brewing company in the world when it acquired Royal Grolsch, brewer of Dutch premium beer brand <a href="Grolsch">Grolsch</a>. <a href="InBev">InBev</a> was the second-largest beer-producing company in the world and <a href="Anheuser-Busch">Anheuser-Busch</a> held the third spot, but after the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch by InBev, the new <a href="Anheuser-Busch%20InBev">Anheuser-Busch InBev</a> company is currently the largest brewer in the world.

<a href="homebrewing">Brewing at home</a> is subject to regulation and prohibition in many countries. Restrictions on homebrewing were lifted in the UK in 1963, Australia followed suit in 1972, and the USA in 1978, though individual states were allowed to pass their own laws limiting production.

Breast reconstruction

Breast reconstruction is the rebuilding of a <a href="breast">breast</a>, usually in <a href="woman">women</a>. It involves using <a href="autologous">autologous</a> tissue or <a href="prosthesis">prosthetic</a> material to construct a natural-looking breast. Often this includes the reformation of a natural-looking <a href="areola">areola</a> and <a href="nipple">nipple</a>. This procedure involves the use of <a href="breast%20implant">implants</a> or tissue taken from other parts of the woman's body.

Generally, the aesthetic appearance is acceptable to the woman, but the reconstructed area is commonly completely numb afterwards, which results in loss of sexual function as well as the ability to perceive <a href="pain">pain</a> caused by <a href="burn">burn</a>s and other injuries.

The primary part of the procedure can often be carried out immediately following the <a href="mastectomy">mastectomy</a>. As with many other surgeries, patients with significant medical comorbidities (<a href="high%20blood%20pressure">high blood pressure</a>, <a href="obesity">obesity</a>, <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>) and <a href="Tobacco%20smoking">smokers</a> are higher-risk candidates. Surgeons may choose to perform delayed reconstruction to decrease this risk. There is little evidence available from randomised studies to favour immediate or delayed reconstruction. The infection rate may be higher with primary reconstruction (done at the same time as mastectomy), but there are psychologic and financial benefits to having a single primary reconstruction. Patients expected to receive <a href="radiation%20therapy">radiation therapy</a> as part of their adjuvant treatment are also commonly considered for delayed autologous reconstruction due to significantly higher complication rates with tissue expander-implant techniques in those patients. Waiting for six months to a year following may decrease the risk of complications, but this risk will always be higher in patients who have received radiation therapy.

Delayed breast reconstruction is considered more challenging than immediate reconstruction. Frequently not just breast volume, but also skin surface area needs to be restored. Many patients undergoing delayed breast reconstruction have been previously treated with radiation or have had a reconstruction failure with immediate breast reconstruction. In nearly all cases of delayed breast reconstruction tissue must be borrowed from another part of the body to make the new breast.

Breast reconstruction is a large undertaking that usually takes multiple operations. Sometimes these follow-up surgeries are spread out over weeks or months. If an implant is used, the individual runs the same risks and complications as those who use them for <a href="breast%20augmentation">breast augmentation</a> but has higher rates of <a href="capsular%20contracture">capsular contracture</a> (tightening or hardening of the scar tissue around the implant) and revisional surgeries.

There are many methods for breast reconstruction. The two most common are:



A <a href="Cochrane%20review">Cochrane review</a> published in 2016 concluded that implants for use in breast reconstructive surgery have not been adequately studied in good quality clinical trials. "These days - even after a few million women have had breasts reconstructed - surgeons cannot inform women about the risks and complications of different implant-based breast reconstructive options on the basis of results derived from <a href="Randomized%20Controlled%20Trial">Randomized Controlled Trial</a>s."

To restore the appearance of the breast with surgical reconstruction, there are a few options regarding the nipple and areola.

The typical outcome of breast reduction surgery is a breast mound with a pleasing aesthetic shape, with a texture similar to a natural breast, but which feels completely or mostly numb for the woman herself. This loss of sensation, called "<a href="somatosensory%20loss">somatosensory loss</a>" or the inability to perceive touch, heat, cold, and pain, sometimes results in women burning themselves or injuring themselves without noticing, or not noticing that their clothing has shifted to expose their breasts. "I can't even feel it when my kids hug me," said one mother, who had nipple-sparing breast reconstruction after a bilateral mastectomy. The loss of sensation has long-term medical consequences, because it makes the affected women unable to feel itchy rashes, infected sores, cuts, bruises, or situations that risk sunburns or frostbite on the affected areas.

More than half of women treated for breast cancer develop <a href="upper%20quarter%20dysfunction">upper quarter dysfunction</a>, including limits on how well they can move, pain in the breast, shoulder or arm, <a href="lymphedema">lymphedema</a>, loss of sensation, and impaired strength. The risk of dysfunction is higher among women who have breast reconstruction surgery.

Some methods have specific side effects. The <a href="transverse%20rectus%20abdominis%20myocutaneous">transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous</a> (TRAM) flap method results in weakness and loss of flexibility in the abdominal wall. Reconstruction with implants have a higher risk of long-term pain.

Outcomes-based research on quality of life improvements and psychosocial benefits associated with breast reconstruction served as the stimulus in the United States for the 1998 <a href="Women%27s%20Health%20and%20Cancer%20Rights%20Act">Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act</a>, which mandated that health care payer cover breast and nipple reconstruction, contralateral procedures to achieve symmetry, and treatment for the sequelae of mastectomy. This was followed in 2001 by additional legislation imposing penalties on noncompliant insurers. Similar provisions for coverage exist in most countries worldwide through national health care programs.

, BHRA was ordered to remove and fill in all trolley tracks on public streets by the DOT. The DOT revoked consent for the project to proceed or exist on city streets. Shortly thereafter, BHRA completely ceased operation. All the PCC trolleys except for No. 3303 were removed from Brooklyn.
The BHRA ran organized tours of the Cobble Hill Tunnel from time to time, but all tours are currently suspended.

<doc id="4427" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4427" title="Beta-lactam">
Beta-lactam

A beta-lactam (β-lactam) ring is a four-membered <a href="lactam">lactam</a>. (A lactam is a cyclic <a href="amide">amide</a>.) It is named as such because the nitrogen atom is attached to the <a href="%CE%92%20carbon">β-carbon</a> atom relative to the carbonyl. The simplest β-lactam possible is <a href="2-azetidinone">2-azetidinone</a>.

The β-lactam ring is part of the core structure of several <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a> families, the principal ones being the <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>s, <a href="cephalosporin">cephalosporin</a>s, <a href="carbapenem">carbapenem</a>s, and <a href="monobactam">monobactam</a>s, which are, therefore, also called <a href="%CE%B2-lactam%20antibiotic">β-lactam antibiotic</a>s. Nearly all of these antibiotics work by inhibiting bacterial <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a> biosynthesis. This has a lethal effect on <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, although any given bacteria population will typically contain a subgroup that is <a href="antibiotic%20resistance">resistant</a> to β-lactam antibiotics. <a href="antibiotic%20resistance">Bacterial resistance</a> occurs as a result of the expression of one of many <a href="beta-lactamase">β-lactamase</a> genes. More than 1,800 different β-lactamase enzymes have been documented in various species of bacteria. These enzymes vary widely in their chemical structure and catalytic efficiencies. When bacterial populations have these resistant subgroups, treatment with β-lactam can result in the resistant strain becoming more prevalent and therefore more virulent.

The first synthetic β-lactam was prepared by <a href="Hermann%20Staudinger">Hermann Staudinger</a> in 1907 by reaction of the <a href="Schiff%20base">Schiff base</a> of <a href="aniline">aniline</a> and <a href="benzaldehyde">benzaldehyde</a> with <a href="diphenylketene">diphenylketene</a> in a [2+2] <a href="cycloaddition">cycloaddition</a> (Ph indicates a phenyl functional group):

Up to 1970, most β-lactam research was concerned with the <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a> and <a href="cephalosporin">cephalosporin</a> groups, but since then, a wide variety of structures have been described.

The Breckpot Synthesis

Due to <a href="ring%20strain">ring strain</a>, β-lactams are more readily <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolyzed</a> than linear amides or larger lactams. This strain is further increased by fusion to a second ring, as found in most β-lactam antibiotics. This trend is due to the amide character of the β-lactam being reduced by the <a href="Plane%20%28geometry%29">aplanarity</a> of the system. The nitrogen atom of an ideal amide is <a href="Orbital%20hybridisation">sp-hybridized</a> due to <a href="Resonance%20%28chemistry%29">resonance</a>, and sp-hybridized atoms have <a href="Trigonal%20planar%20molecular%20geometry">trigonal planar bond geometry</a>. As a <a href="Pyramid%20%28geometry%29">pyramidal</a> bond geometry is forced upon the nitrogen atom by the ring strain, the resonance of the amide bond is reduced, and the carbonyl becomes more <a href="ketone">ketone</a>-like. <a href="Nobel%20laureate">Nobel laureate</a> <a href="Robert%20Burns%20Woodward">Robert Burns Woodward</a> described a parameter "h" as a measure of the height of the trigonal pyramid defined by the nitrogen (as the <a href="Apex%20%28geometry%29">apex</a>) and its three adjacent atoms. "h" corresponds to the strength of the β-lactam bond with lower numbers (more planar; more like ideal amides) being stronger and less reactive. Monobactams have "h" values between 0.05 and 0.10 <a href="angstrom">angstrom</a>s (Å). Cephems have "h" values in of 0.20–0.25 Å. Penams have values in the range 0.40–0.50 Å, while carbapenems and clavams have values of 0.50–0.60 Å, being the most reactive of the β-lactams toward hydrolysis.

A new study has suggested that β-lactams can undergo ring-opening <a href="polymerization">polymerization</a> to form amide bonds, to become nylon-3 polymers. The backbones of these polymers are identical to peptides, which offer them biofunctionality. These nylon-3 polymers can either mimic <a href="host%20defense%20peptides">host defense peptides</a> or act as signals to stimulate <a href="3T3%20cells">3T3</a> <a href="stem%20cell">stem cell</a> function.

<a href="Antiproliferative%20agent">Antiproliferative agent</a>s that target tubulin with β-lactams in their structure have also been reported.

Bishopric of Brandenburg

The Bishopric of Brandenburg ( or "Dioecesis Brandenburgensis") was a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> <a href="diocese">diocese</a> established by King <a href="Otto%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Otto I of Germany</a> in 948, in the territory of the "<a href="Marca%20Geronis">Marca Geronis</a>" (<a href="Saxon%20Eastern%20March">Saxon Eastern March</a>) east of the <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a> river. The bishopric was a <a href="suffragan%20diocese">suffragan diocese</a> of the <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Magdeburg">Archbishopric of Magdeburg</a>, its seat was <a href="Brandenburg%20an%20der%20Havel">Brandenburg an der Havel</a>. 

The <a href="Prince-bishop">Prince-bishop</a>ric of Brandenburg () was a <a href="Imperial%20State">state</a> of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> for some time, probably starting about 1161/1165. However, the Brandenburg bishops never managed to gain control over a significant territory, being overshadowed by the <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg">Margraviate of Brandenburg</a>, which was originally seated in the same city. Chapter and cathedral, surrounded by further ecclesiastical institutions, were located on the "Dominsel" (Cathedral Island), which formed a prince-episcopal <a href="Domfreiheit">cathedral immunity district</a> ("Domfreiheit"), distinct from the city of Brandenburg. Only in 1929 the - meanwhile former - immunity district was incorporated into the city itself.

The foundation charter of the Brandenburg diocese is dated 1 October 948, though the actual founding date remained disputed among historians. The medieval chronicler <a href="Thietmar%20of%20Merseburg">Thietmar of Merseburg</a> mentions the year 938; the bishopric may also have been established in the course of the partition of the vast "Marca Geronis" and the emergence of the <a href="Northern%20March">Northern March</a> after Margrave <a href="Gero">Gero</a>'s death in 965. With the foundation, King Otto (<a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> from 962) aimed at the <a href="Christianization">Christianization</a> of the <a href="Polabian%20Slavs">Polabian Slavs</a> (<a href="Wends">Wends</a>) and the incorporation of their territory into the <a href="East%20Francia">East Frankish</a> realm.

Brandenburg was originally a suffragan of the <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Mainz">Archbishopric of Mainz</a>, but in 968 it came under the jurisdiction of the Magdeburg archbishops. The <a href="Great%20Slav%20Rising">Great Slav Rising</a> of 983 practically annihilated it, when revolting <a href="Lutici">Lutici</a> tribes conquered Brandenburg and the neighbouring <a href="Bishopric%20of%20Havelberg">Bishopric of Havelberg</a>. Brandenburg bishops continued to be appointed, but they were merely titular, residing in Magdeburg or acting as <a href="auxiliary%20bishop">auxiliary bishop</a>s in the western territories of the Empire. Not until the final subjugation of the Wends in the 12th century by Margrave <a href="Albert%20the%20Bear">Albert the Bear</a>, the <a href="Ostsiedlung">German eastward settlement</a> ("Ostsiedlung") in the diocesan region revived the bishopric. 

Bishop Wigers of Brandenburg (acting 1138–60), an adherent of <a href="Norbert%20of%20Xanten">Norbert of Xanten</a>, was the first of a series of bishops of the <a href="Premonstratensians">Premonstratensian</a> Order, which chose the occupants of the <a href="episcopal%20see">episcopal see</a> until 1447; in that year a bull of <a href="Pope%20Nicholas%20V">Pope Nicholas V</a> gave the right of nomination to the Brandenburg <a href="Prince-elector">elector</a>, with whom the bishops stood in a close feudal relation. Bishop Wigers also established a Premonstratensian convent at <a href="Gommern">Leitzkau</a> (today part of Gommern, Saxony-Anhalt). Probably at the request of the <a href="Hevelli">Hevelli</a>an prince <a href="Pribislav-Henry">Pribislav-Henry</a>, he established another convent at the Slavic "Parduin" settlement in present-day Brandenburg an der Havel, which became the nucleus of the revived Brandenburg cathedral chapter. The incorporation into the Premonstratensian Order was confirmed by <a href="Pope%20Clement%20III">Pope Clement III</a> in 1188.
As rulers of <a href="imperial%20immediacy">imperial immediacy</a>, regnant in a, however, dispersed territory partitioned into the four bailiwicks () of Brandenburg/Havel, <a href="Ketzin">Ketzin</a>, <a href="Teltow">Teltow</a> and <a href="Ziesar">Ziesar</a>. The prince-bishops from the early 14th century onwards resided in their fortress in Ziesar on the road to <a href="Magdeburg">Magdeburg</a>. The last actual bishop was <a href="Matthias%20von%20Jagow">Matthias von Jagow</a> (d. 1544), who took the side of the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, married, and in every way furthered the undertakings of the <a href="House%20of%20Hohenzollern">Hohenzollern</a> elector <a href="Joachim%20II%20Hector%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">Joachim II</a>.

There were two more nominal bishops, but on the petition of the latter of these, the electoral prince <a href="John%20George%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">John George of Brandenburg</a> appointed in 1560, the secularisation of the bishopric was undertaken and finally accomplished in 1571, in spite of legal proceedings to reassert the imperial immediacy of the prince-bishopric within the Empire and so to likewise preserve the diocese, which dragged on into the 17th century.

Secularized and merged into Brandenburg.

In the U.S., BASE jumping is currently regarded by many as a fringe <a href="extreme%20sport">extreme sport</a> or <a href="stunt">stunt</a>. In some jurisdictions or locations, BASE jumping is prohibited or illegal; in some places, however, it is permitted, like <a href="Perrine%20Bridge">Perrine Bridge</a>, in Twin Falls, Idaho, United States. BASE jumping became known to the wider public by depictions of BASE jumping in a number of action movies and was featured in the 2014 documentary "Sunshine Superman".

The acronym "B.A.S.E." (now more commonly "BASE") was coined by filmmaker <a href="Carl%20Boenish">Carl Boenish</a>, his wife Jean Boenish, Phil Smith, and Phil Mayfield. Carl Boenish was the catalyst behind modern BASE jumping, and in 1978, he filmed the first BASE jumps to be made using ram-air parachutes and the <a href="Tracking%20%28freeflying%29">freefall tracking technique</a> (from <a href="El%20Capitan">El Capitan</a>, in <a href="Yosemite%20National%20Park">Yosemite National Park</a>). While BASE jumps had been made prior to that time, the El Capitan activity was the effective birth of what is now called BASE jumping.

BASE numbers are awarded to those who have made at least one jump from each of the four categories (buildings, antennas, spans and earth). When Phil Smith and Phil Mayfield jumped together from a Houston skyscraper on 18 January 1981, they became the first to attain the exclusive BASE numbers (BASE #1 and #2, respectively), having already jumped from an antenna, <a href="span%20%28architecture%29">spans</a>, and earthen objects. Jean and Carl Boenish qualified for BASE numbers 3 and 4 soon after. A separate "award" was soon enacted for Night BASE jumping when Mayfield completed each category at night, becoming Night BASE #1, with Smith qualifying a few weeks later.

<a href="Faust%20Vrancic">Faust Vrancic</a> is widely believed to have performed a parachute jumping experiment for real and, therefore, to be the first man to build and test a parachute: according to the story passed on, Veranzio, in 1617, then over sixty-five years old, implemented his design and tested the parachute by jumping from <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20Campanile">St Mark's Campanile</a> in Venice. This event was documented some 30 years later in a book "<a href="Mathematical%20Magick">Mathematical Magick or, the Wonders that may be Performed by Mechanical Geometry</a>" (London, 1648) written by <a href="John%20Wilkins">John Wilkins</a>, the secretary of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> in London.

However, these and other sporadic incidents were one-time experiments, not the systematic pursuit of a new form of parachuting. After 1978, the filmed jumps from El Capitan were repeated, not as a publicity exercise or as a movie stunt, but as a true recreational activity. It was this that popularized BASE jumping more widely among parachutists. Carl Boenish continued to publish films and informational magazines on BASE jumping until his death in 1984 after a BASE-jump off of the <a href="Troll%20Wall">Troll Wall</a>. By this time, the concept had spread among skydivers worldwide, with hundreds of participants making fixed-object jumps.

During the early eighties, nearly all BASE jumps were made using standard skydiving equipment, including two parachutes (main and reserve), and deployment components. Later on, specialized equipment and techniques were developed specifically for the unique needs of BASE jumping.
Upon completing a jump from all of the four object categories, a jumper may choose to apply for a "BASE number", awarded sequentially. The 1000th application for a BASE number was filed in March 2005 and BASE #1000 was awarded to Matt "Harley" Moilanen of Grand Rapids, Michigan. , over 2,000 BASE numbers have been issued.

"<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a>" first listed a BASE jumping record with <a href="Carl%20Boenish">Carl Boenish</a>'s 1984 leap from Trollveggen (<a href="Troll%20Wall">Troll Wall</a>) in Norway. It was described as the highest BASE jump. (The jump was made two days before Boenish's death at the same site.) This record category is still in the "Guinness" book and is currently held by Valery Rozov. On 5 October 2016, Russia’s Valery Rozov leapt from a height of around 7,700 m (25,262 ft) from Cho Oyu – the sixth-highest mountain in the Himalayas, located on the China/Nepal border. He fell for around 90 seconds before opening his parachute, landing on a glacier approximately two minutes later at an altitude of around 6,000 m (19,685 ft). On July 8, 2006 Captain Daniel G. Schilling set the Guinness World Record for the most BASE jumps in a twenty-four-hour period. Schilling jumped off the <a href="Perrine%20Bridge">Perrine Bridge</a> in Twin Falls, Idaho a record 201 times.

BASE competitions have been held since the early 1980s, with accurate landings or free fall aerobatics used as the judging criteria. Recent years have seen a formal competition held at the high <a href="Petronas%20Towers">Petronas Towers</a> in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, judged on landing accuracy.

In 2010 celebrated a world record with 53 Base jumpers jumping from a cliff.


BASE jumping is often featured in action movies. The 2002 <a href="Vin%20Diesel">Vin Diesel</a> film "<a href="XXX%20%282002%20film%29">XXX</a>" includes a scene where Diesel's character catapults himself off the <a href="Foresthill%20Bridge">Foresthill Bridge</a> in an open-topped car, landing safely as the car crashes on the ground. The movie "" includes a scene in which the main characters jump with <a href="wing%20suit">wing suit</a>s from the IFC Tower in <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> and fly over the Bank of China, finally opening their parachutes to land on a moving freighter. The stunt was done live, with no special effects, by base jumpers Martin Rosén and Per Eriksson, members of the Swedish "Team Bautasten". The scene was filmed by air-to-air camera man Mikael Nordqvist, from the same team. Since the 1976 <a href="Mount%20Asgard">Mount Asgard</a> jump featured in the pre-credits sequence to "<a href="The%20Spy%20Who%20Loved%20Me%20%28film%29">The Spy Who Loved Me</a>", James Bond movies have featured several BASE jumps, including one from the <a href="Eiffel%20Tower">Eiffel Tower</a> in 1985's "<a href="A%20View%20to%20a%20Kill">A View to a Kill</a>", the <a href="Rock%20of%20Gibraltar">Rock of Gibraltar</a> in 1987's "<a href="The%20Living%20Daylights">The Living Daylights</a>", and in "<a href="Die%20Another%20Day">Die Another Day</a>", 2002, <a href="Pierce%20Brosnan">Pierce Brosnan</a> as <a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a> jumps from a melting iceberg. Of the James Bond jumps only the Mt Asgard and Eiffel Tower jumps were filmed live; the rest were special effects. And in 2005's "<a href="Batman%20Begins">Batman Begins</a>", Bruce Wayne uses BASE jumping as inspiration for his memory cloth cape. A series of BASE jumps are featured in the video for a remix of <a href="M83%20%28band%29">M83</a>'s "Lower Your Eyelids to Die With the Sun".

In 1938, a Sierra Club film "Three On A Rope" (1938) ends with a climber jumping off Baldy Mountain rather than dealing with the hassle of rappelling to the horror of a climbing partner, only to deploy a parachute hidden in his pack.

The video game "Just Cause 3" also involves the main character, Rico Rodriguez, performing many dangerous stunts involving his wing suit and grappling hook. One example is when, in the first mission, he jumps off a cliff onto a bridge. This mechanic has led to many crazy stunts performed by players.

BASE jumping grew out of skydiving. BASE jumps are generally made from much lower altitudes than skydives, and a BASE jump takes place close to the object serving as the jump platform. Because BASE jumps generally entail slower airspeeds than typical skydives (due to the limited altitude), a BASE jumper does not always reach <a href="terminal%20velocity">terminal velocity</a>. Because higher airspeeds enable jumpers more aerodynamic control of their bodies, as well as more positive and quick parachute openings, the longer the delay, the better. BASE jumping is significantly more dangerous than similar sports such as <a href="skydiving">skydiving</a> from aircraft.

Skydivers use the air flow to stabilize their position, allowing the parachute to deploy cleanly. BASE jumpers, falling at lower speeds, have less aerodynamic control, and may tumble. The <a href="aircraft%20attitude">attitude</a> of the body at the moment of jumping determines the stability of flight in the first few seconds, before sufficient airspeed has built up to enable aerodynamic stability. On low BASE jumps, parachute deployment takes place during this early phase of flight, so if a poor "launch" leads into a tumble, the jumper may not be able to correct this before the opening. If the parachute is deployed while the jumper is tumbling, there is a high risk of entanglement or malfunction. The jumper may also not be facing the right direction. Such an off-heading opening is not as problematic in skydiving, but an off-heading opening that results in object strike has caused many serious injuries and deaths in BASE jumping.

At an altitude of , having been in free-fall for at least , a skydiver is falling at approximately , and is approximately 10.9 seconds from the ground. Most BASE jumps are made from less than . For example, a BASE jump from a object is about 5.6 seconds from the ground if the jumper remains in free fall. On a BASE jump, the parachute must open at about half the airspeed of a similar skydive, and more quickly (in a shorter distance fallen). Standard skydiving parachute systems are not designed for this situation, so BASE jumpers often use specially designed harnesses and parachute containers, with extra large pilot chutes, and many jump with only one parachute, since there would be little time to utilize a reserve parachute. In the early days of BASE jumping, people used modified skydiving gear, such as by removing the deployment bag and <a href="slider%20%28parachuting%29">slider</a>, stowing the lines in a tail pocket, and fitting a large pilot chute. However, modified skydiving gear is then prone to kinds of malfunction that are rare in normal skydiving (such as "line-overs" and broken lines). Modern purpose-built BASE jumping equipment is considered to be much safer and more reliable.

Another risk is that most BASE jumping venues have very small areas in which to land. A beginner skydiver, after parachute deployment, may have a three-minute or more parachute ride to the ground. A BASE jump from will have a parachute ride of only 10 to 15 seconds.

One way to make a parachute open very quickly is to use a <a href="static%20line">static line</a> or direct bag. These devices form an attachment between the parachute and the jump platform, which stretches out the parachute and suspension lines as the jumper falls, before separating and allowing the parachute to inflate. This method enables the very lowest jumps — below — to be made, although most BASE jumpers are more motivated to make higher jumps involving free fall. This method is similar to the <a href="paratrooper">paratrooper</a>'s deployment system, also called a PCA (Pilot Chute Assist).

Surreptitious BASE jumps are often made from tall buildings and antenna towers. Many such BASE jumps must be covert because the owners of these objects are generally reluctant to allow their object to be used as a platform. While BASE jumping itself is generally not illegal, making events such as the "Go Fast Games" at the <a href="Royal%20Gorge%20Bridge">Royal Gorge Bridge</a> possible, the covert nature of accessing objects usually necessitates trespassing on an object. Jumpers who are caught can expect to be charged with trespassing, as well as having charges like breaking and entering, reckless endangerment, vandalism, or other such charges pressed against them. Other people accompanying the jumper, such as ground crew, may also face charges. In some jurisdictions it may be permissible to use land until specifically told not to. <a href="Perrine%20Bridge">Perrine Bridge</a> in <a href="Twin%20Falls%2C%20Idaho">Twin Falls, Idaho</a>, is an example of a man-made structure in the United States where BASE jumping is allowed year-round without a permit.
Once a year, on the third Saturday in October ("<a href="Bridge%20Day">Bridge Day</a>"), permission to BASE jump has explicitly been granted at the <a href="New%20River%20Gorge%20Bridge">New River Gorge Bridge</a> in <a href="Fayetteville%2C%20West%20Virginia">Fayetteville, West Virginia</a>. The New River Gorge Bridge deck is 876 feet (267 m) above the river. This annual event attracts about 450 BASE jumpers and nearly 200,000 spectators. 1,100 jumps may occur during the six hours that it is legal provided good conditions. For many skydivers who would like to try BASE jumping, this bridge will be the only fixed object from which they ever jump. On 21 October 2006, veteran BASE jumper <a href="Brian%20Lee%20Schubert">Brian Lee Schubert</a> of <a href="Alta%20Loma%2C%20Rancho%20Cucamonga%2C%20California">Alta Loma, California</a> died while jumping from the New River Gorge Bridge during Bridge Day activities because his parachute opened late; he plummeted to his death in the waters below. Jumps continued after the recovery of his body. He and his friend <a href="Michael%20Pelkey">Michael Pelkey</a> were the first to make a BASE jump from <a href="El%20Capitan">El Capitan</a> in <a href="Yosemite%20National%20Park">Yosemite National Park</a> in 1966.

The <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> (NPS) has the authority to ban specific activities in <a href="US%20National%20Parks">US National Parks</a> and has done so for BASE jumping. The authority comes from 36 CFR 2.17(3), which prohibits, "Delivering or retrieving a person or object by parachute, helicopter, or other airborne means, except in emergencies involving public safety or serious property loss, or pursuant to the terms and conditions of a permit." Under that Regulation, BASE is not banned, but is allowable if a permit is issued by the Superintendent, which means that a mechanism to allow BASE in National Parks was always in place. The 2001 National Park Service Management Policies state that BASE "is not an appropriate public use activity within national park areas ..." (2001 Management Policy 8.2.2.7.) However, Policy 8.2.2.7 in the 2006 volume of National Park Service Management Policies, which superseded the 2001 edition, states "Parachuting (or BASE jumping), whether from an aircraft, structure, or natural feature, is generally prohibited by 36 CFR 2.17(a)(3). However, if determined through a park planning process to be an appropriate activity, it may be allowed pursuant to the terms and conditions of a permit."

During the early days of BASE jumping, the NPS issued permits that authorized jumps from <a href="El%20Capitan">El Capitan</a>. This program ran for three months in 1980 and then collapsed amid allegations of abuse by unauthorized jumpers. The NPS has since vigorously enforced the ban, charging jumpers with "aerial delivery into a National Park". One jumper drowned in the <a href="Merced%20River">Merced River</a> while evading arresting Park Rangers, having declared 'No way are they gonna get me. Let them chase me—I'll just laugh in their faces and jump in the river.' Despite incidents like this one, illegal jumps continue in Yosemite at a rate estimated at a few hundred per year, often at night or dawn. El Capitan, <a href="Half%20Dome">Half Dome</a> and <a href="Glacier%20Point">Glacier Point</a> have been used as jump sites.

Other US public land, including land controlled by the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Land%20Management">Bureau of Land Management</a>, does not ban air delivery, and there are numerous jumpable objects on BLM land.

The legal position is different at other sites and in other countries. For example, in Norway's <a href="Lysefjord">Lysefjord</a> (from the mountain <a href="Kjerag">Kjerag</a>), BASE jumpers are made welcome. Many sites in the European Alps, near <a href="Chamonix">Chamonix</a> and on the <a href="Eiger">Eiger</a>, are also open to jumpers. Some other Norwegian places, like the <a href="Troll%20Wall">Troll Wall</a>, are banned because of dangerous rescue missions in the past. In Austria, jumping from mountain cliffs is generally allowed, whereas the use of bridges (such as the <a href="Europabruecke">Europabruecke</a> near <a href="Innsbruck">Innsbruck</a>, <a href="Tirol%20%28state%29">Tirol</a>) or dams is generally prohibited. Australia has some of the toughest stances on BASE jumping: it specifically bans BASE jumping from certain objects, such as the <a href="Sydney%20Harbour%20Bridge">Sydney Harbour Bridge</a>.

BASE jumping as of 2006 has an overall fatality rate estimated at about one fatality per sixty participants. A study of 20,850 BASE jumps from the same site (the Kjerag Massif in Norway) reported 9 fatalities over the 11-year period from 1995 to 2005, or 1 in every 2,317 jumps. However, at that site, 1 in every 254 jumps over that period resulted in a nonfatal accident. BASE jumping is one of the most dangerous recreational activities in the world, with a fatality and injury rate 43 times as high as parachuting from a plane.

, the 'BASE Fatality List' maintained by Blincmagazine.com records 285 deaths for BASE jumping since April 1981.

American BASE jumper Ian Flanders died in <a href="Kemaliye">Kemaliye</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> on 21 July 2015, after his parachute became tangled in his feet, causing him to fall into the <a href="Karasu">Karasu</a> river at high speed. The jump was being aired live on a local television station.

Beauty

Beauty is a characteristic of an animal, <a href="idea">idea</a>, <a href="Object%20%28philosophy%29">object</a>, person or <a href="Location%20%28geography%29">place</a> that provides a <a href="perception">perceptual</a> experience of <a href="pleasure">pleasure</a> or <a href="Contentment">satisfaction</a>. Beauty is studied as part of <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a>, <a href="culture">culture</a>, <a href="social%20psychology">social psychology</a>, <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a> and <a href="sociology">sociology</a>. An "ideal beauty" is an entity which is admired, or possesses features widely attributed to beauty in a particular culture, for perfection.

<a href="Unattractiveness">Ugliness</a> is considered to be the opposite of beauty.

The experience of "beauty" often involves an interpretation of some entity as being in balance and <a href="harmony">harmony</a> with <a href="nature">nature</a>, which may lead to feelings of <a href="sexual%20attraction">attraction</a> and <a href="emotional%20well-being">emotional well-being</a>. Because this can be a <a href="Subjectivity">subjective</a> experience, it is often said that "beauty is in the eye of the beholder."

There is evidence that perceptions of beauty are evolutionary determined, that things, aspects of people and landscapes considered beautiful are typically found in situations likely to give enhanced survival of the perceiving human's genes.

The classical Greek noun that best translates to the English-language words "beauty" or "beautiful" was <a href="wikt%3A%CE%BA%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82">κάλλος</a>, "kallos", and the adjective was καλός, "kalos". However, "kalos" may and is also translated as ″good″ or ″of fine quality″ and thus has a broader meaning than mere physical or material beauty. Similarly, "kallos" was used differently from the English word beauty in that it first and foremost applied to humans and bears an erotic connotation.

The <a href="Koine%20Greek">Koine Greek</a> word for beautiful was ὡραῖος, "hōraios", an adjective etymologically coming from the word ὥρα, "hōra", meaning "hour". In Koine Greek, beauty was thus associated with "being of one's hour". Thus, a ripe fruit (of its time) was considered beautiful, whereas a young woman trying to appear older or an older woman trying to appear younger would not be considered beautiful. In Attic Greek, "hōraios" had many meanings, including "youthful" and "ripe old age".

The <a href="Beauty%20%28ancient%20thought%29">earliest Western theory of beauty</a> can be found in the works of early Greek philosophers from the <a href="pre-Socratic">pre-Socratic</a> period, such as <a href="Pythagoras">Pythagoras</a>. The Pythagorean school saw a strong connection between <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> and beauty. In particular, they noted that objects proportioned according to the <a href="golden%20ratio">golden ratio</a> seemed more attractive. <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20architecture">Ancient Greek architecture</a> is based on this view of symmetry and <a href="ratio">proportion</a>.

Plato considered beauty to be the Idea (Form) above all other Ideas. Aristotle saw a relationship between the beautiful ("to kalon") and virtue, arguing that "Virtue aims at the beautiful."

<a href="Classical%20philosophy">Classical philosophy</a> and sculptures of men and women produced according to the <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20philosophy">Greek philosophers</a>' tenets of ideal human beauty were rediscovered in <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> Europe, leading to a re-adoption of what became known as a "classical ideal". In terms of female human beauty, a woman whose <a href="human%20physical%20appearance">appearance</a> conforms to these tenets is still called a "classical beauty" or said to possess a "classical beauty", whilst the foundations laid by Greek and Roman artists have also supplied the standard for male beauty in western civilization. During the Gothic era, the classical aesthetical canon of beauty was rejected as sinful. Later, <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> and <a href="Humanism">Humanist</a> thinkers rejected this view, and considered beauty to be the product of rational order and harmonious proportions. Renaissance artists and architects (such as <a href="Giorgio%20Vasari">Giorgio Vasari</a> in his "Lives of Artists") criticised the Gothic period as irrational and barbarian. This point of view of <a href="Gothic%20art">Gothic art</a> lasted until Romanticism, in the 19th century.

The <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Reason</a> saw a rise in an interest in beauty as a philosophical subject. For example, Scottish philosopher <a href="Francis%20Hutcheson%20%28philosopher%29">Francis Hutcheson</a> argued that beauty is "unity in variety and variety in unity". The Romantic poets, too, became highly concerned with the <a href="nature%20%28philosophy%29">nature</a> of beauty, with <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a> arguing in "Ode on a Grecian Urn" that

In the Romantic period, <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a> postulated a difference between beauty in its classical meaning and the <a href="Sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublime</a>. The concept of the sublime, as explicated by Burke and <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Kant</a>, suggested viewing Gothic art and architecture, though not in accordance with the classical standard of beauty, as sublime.

The 20th century saw an increasing rejection of beauty by artists and philosophers alike, culminating in <a href="postmodernism">postmodernism</a>'s anti-aesthetics. This is despite beauty being a central concern of one of postmodernism's main influences, <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, who argued that the Will to Power was the Will to Beauty.

In the aftermath of postmodernism's rejection of beauty, thinkers have returned to beauty as an important value. American analytic philosopher <a href="Guy%20Sircello">Guy Sircello</a> proposed his New Theory of Beauty as an effort to reaffirm the status of beauty as an important philosophical concept. Elaine Scarry also argues that beauty is related to justice.

Beauty is also studied by psychologists and neuroscientists in the field of <a href="experimental%20aesthetics">experimental aesthetics</a> and <a href="neuroesthetics">neuroesthetics</a> respectively. Psychological theories see beauty as a form of <a href="pleasure">pleasure</a>. Correlational findings support the view that more beautiful objects are also more pleasing. Some studies suggest that higher experienced beauty is associated with activity in the medial <a href="orbitofrontal%20cortex">orbitofrontal cortex</a>. This approach of localizing the processing of beauty in one brain region has received criticism within the field.

The characterization of a person as “beautiful”, whether on an individual basis or by community consensus, is often based on some combination of "inner beauty", which includes psychological factors such as <a href="Personality%20type">personality</a>, <a href="intelligence">intelligence</a>, <a href="wiktionary%3Agrace">grace</a>, <a href="politeness">politeness</a>, <a href="charisma">charisma</a>, <a href="integrity">integrity</a>, <a href="wikt%3Acongruence">congruence</a> and <a href="elegance">elegance</a>, and "outer beauty" (i.e. <a href="physical%20attractiveness">physical attractiveness</a>) which includes physical attributes which are valued on an aesthetic basis.

Standards of beauty have changed over time, based on changing cultural values. Historically, paintings show a wide range of different standards for beauty. However, humans who are relatively young, with smooth skin, well-proportioned bodies, and regular features, have traditionally been considered the most beautiful throughout history.

A strong indicator of physical beauty is "<a href="averageness">averageness</a>". When images of human faces are averaged together to form a composite image, they become progressively closer to the "ideal" image and are perceived as more attractive. This was first noticed in 1883, when <a href="Francis%20Galton">Francis Galton</a>, cousin of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, overlaid photographic composite images of the faces of vegetarians and criminals to see if there was a typical facial appearance for each. When doing this, he noticed that the composite images were more attractive compared to any of the individual images. Researchers have replicated the result under more controlled conditions and found that the computer generated, mathematical average of a series of faces is rated more favorably than individual faces. It is argued that it is evolutionarily advantageous that sexual creatures are attracted to mates who possess predominantly common or average features, because it suggests the <a href="Koinophilia">absence of genetic or acquired defects</a>. There is also evidence that a preference for beautiful faces emerges early in infancy, and is probably innate, 
and that the rules by which attractiveness is established are similar across different genders and cultures.

A feature of beautiful women that has been explored by researchers is a <a href="waist%E2%80%93hip%20ratio">waist–hip ratio</a> of approximately 0.70. Physiologists have shown that women with <a href="Female%20body%20shape">hourglass figures</a> are more fertile than other women due to higher levels of certain female hormones, a fact that may subconsciously condition males choosing mates.

People are influenced by the images they see in the media to determine what is or is not beautiful. Some feminists and doctors have suggested that the very thin models featured in magazines promote <a href="eating%20disorder">eating disorder</a>s, and others have argued that the predominance of white women featured in movies and advertising leads to a <a href="Eurocentric">Eurocentric</a> concept of beauty, feelings of inferiority in women of color, and <a href="internalized%20racism">internalized racism</a>.

The <a href="black%20is%20beautiful">black is beautiful</a> cultural movement sought to dispel this notion.

<a href="Fatima%20Lodhi">Fatima Lodhi</a>, a young diversity and anti-colorism advocate from <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, claims that "Beauty comes in all shapes, shades and sizes".

The concept of beauty in men is known as '<a href="bish%C5%8Dnen">bishōnen</a>' in Japan. Bishōnen refers to males with distinctly <a href="Femininity">feminine</a> features, physical characteristics establishing the standard of beauty in Japan and typically exhibited in their <a href="popular%20culture">pop culture</a> <a href="Japanese%20idol">idols</a>. A multibillion-dollar industry of <a href="Japanese%20Aesthetic%20Salons">Japanese Aesthetic Salons</a> exists for this reason.

Beauty presents a standard of <a href="social%20comparison%20theory">comparison</a>, and it can cause resentment and dissatisfaction when not achieved. People who do not fit the "beauty ideal" may be ostracized within their communities. The television sitcom "<a href="Ugly%20Betty">Ugly Betty</a>" portrays the life of a girl faced with hardships due to society's unwelcoming attitudes toward those they deem unattractive. However, a person may also be targeted for harassment because of their beauty. In "<a href="Mal%C3%A8na">Malèna</a>", a strikingly beautiful Italian woman is forced into poverty by the women of the community who refuse to give her work for fear that she may "woo" their husbands. The documentary "<a href="Beauty%20in%20the%20Eyes%20of%20the%20Beheld">Beauty in the Eyes of the Beheld</a>" explores both the societal blessings and curses of female beauty through interviews of women considered beautiful.

Researchers have found that good looking students get higher grades from their teachers than students with an ordinary appearance. Some studies using mock criminal trials have shown that physically attractive "defendants" are less likely to be convicted—and if convicted are likely to receive lighter sentences—than less attractive ones (although the opposite effect was observed when the alleged crime was swindling, perhaps because jurors perceived the defendant's attractiveness as facilitating the crime). Studies among teens and young adults, such as those of psychiatrist and self-help author, <a href="Eva%20Ritvo">Eva Ritvo</a>, show that skin conditions have a profound effect on social behavior and opportunity.

How much money a person earns may also be influenced by physical beauty. One study found that people low in physical attractiveness earn 5 to 10 percent less than ordinary looking people, who in turn earn 3 to 8 percent less than those who are considered good looking. In the market for loans, the least attractive people are less likely to get approvals, although they are less likely to default. In the marriage market, women's looks are at a premium, but men's looks do not matter much.

Brownian motion

Brownian motion or pedesis (from "leaping") is the random motion of <a href="particle">particle</a>s suspended in a <a href="fluid">fluid</a> (a <a href="liquid">liquid</a> or a <a href="gas">gas</a>) resulting from their collision with the fast-moving <a href="atom">atom</a>s or <a href="molecule">molecule</a>s in the gas or liquid.

This <a href="transport%20phenomena">transport phenomenon</a> is named after the botanist <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a>. In 1827, while looking through a microscope at particles trapped in cavities inside pollen grains in water, he noted that the particles moved through the water; but he was not able to determine the mechanisms that caused this motion. <a href="Atomic%20theory">Atoms and molecules</a> had long been theorized as the constituents of matter, and <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> published <a href="%C3%9Cber%20die%20von%20der%20molekularkinetischen%20Theorie%20der%20W%C3%A4rme%20geforderte%20Bewegung%20von%20in%20ruhenden%20Fl%C3%BCssigkeiten%20suspendierten%20Teilchen">a paper in 1905</a> that explained in precise detail how the motion that Brown had observed was a result of the pollen being moved by individual water molecules. This explanation of Brownian motion served as convincing evidence that atoms and molecules exist, and was further verified experimentally by <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Perrin">Jean Perrin</a> in 1908. Perrin was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 1926 "for his work on the discontinuous structure of matter" (Einstein had received the award five years earlier "for his services to theoretical physics" with specific citation of <a href="photoelectric%20effect">different research</a>). The direction of the force of atomic bombardment is constantly changing, and at different times the particle is hit more on one side than another, leading to the seemingly random nature of the motion.

Brownian motion is among the simplest of the continuous-time <a href="stochastic%20process">stochastic (or probabilistic) processes</a>, and it is a <a href="limit%20%28mathematics%29">limit</a> of both simpler and more complicated stochastic processes (see <a href="random%20walk">random walk</a> and <a href="Donsker%27s%20theorem">Donsker's theorem</a>). This <a href="Universality%20%28dynamical%20systems%29">universality</a> is closely related to the universality of the <a href="normal%20distribution">normal distribution</a>. In both cases, it is often mathematical convenience, rather than the accuracy of the models, that motivates their use.

The Roman <a href="Lucretius">Lucretius</a>'s scientific poem "<a href="On%20the%20Nature%20of%20Things">On the Nature of Things</a>" (c. 60 BC) has a remarkable description of Brownian motion of dust particles in verses 113–140 from Book II. He uses this as a proof of the existence of atoms:

"Observe what happens when sunbeams are admitted into a building and shed light on its shadowy places. You will see a multitude of tiny particles mingling in a multitude of ways... their dancing is an actual indication of underlying movements of matter that are hidden from our sight... It originates with the atoms which move of themselves [i.e., spontaneously]. Then those small compound bodies that are least removed from the impetus of the atoms are set in motion by the impact of their invisible blows and in turn cannon against slightly larger bodies. So the movement mounts up from the atoms and gradually emerges to the level of our senses, so that those bodies are in motion that we see in sunbeams, moved by blows that remain invisible."

Although the mingling motion of dust particles is caused largely by air currents, the glittering, tumbling motion of small dust particles is, indeed, caused chiefly by true Brownian dynamics.

While <a href="Jan%20Ingenhousz">Jan Ingenhousz</a> described the irregular motion of <a href="coal">coal</a> <a href="dust">dust</a> particles on the surface of <a href="ethanol">alcohol</a> in 1785, the discovery of this phenomenon is often credited to the botanist <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> in 1827. Brown was studying <a href="pollen">pollen</a> grains of the plant "<a href="Clarkia%20pulchella">Clarkia pulchella</a>" suspended in water under a microscope when he observed minute particles, ejected by the pollen grains, executing a jittery motion. By repeating the experiment with particles of inorganic matter he was able to rule out that the motion was life-related, although its origin was yet to be explained.

The first person to describe the mathematics behind Brownian motion was <a href="Thorvald%20N.%20Thiele">Thorvald N. Thiele</a> in a paper on the method of <a href="least%20squares">least squares</a> published in 1880. This was followed independently by <a href="Louis%20Bachelier">Louis Bachelier</a> in 1900 in his PhD thesis "The theory of speculation", in which he presented a stochastic analysis of the stock and option markets. The Brownian motion model of the <a href="stock%20market">stock market</a> is often cited, but <a href="Benoit%20Mandelbrot">Benoit Mandelbrot</a> rejected its applicability to stock price movements in part because these are discontinuous.

<a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> (in one of his <a href="%C3%9Cber%20die%20von%20der%20molekularkinetischen%20Theorie%20der%20W%C3%A4rme%20geforderte%20Bewegung%20von%20in%20ruhenden%20Fl%C3%BCssigkeiten%20suspendierten%20Teilchen">1905 papers</a>) and <a href="Marian%20Smoluchowski">Marian Smoluchowski</a> (1906) brought the solution of the problem to the attention of physicists, and presented it as a way to indirectly confirm the existence of atoms and molecules. Their equations describing Brownian motion were subsequently verified by the experimental work of <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Perrin">Jean Baptiste Perrin</a> in 1908.

There are two parts to Einstein's theory: the first part consists in the formulation of a diffusion equation for Brownian particles, in which the diffusion coefficient is related to the <a href="mean%20squared%20displacement">mean squared displacement</a> of a Brownian particle, while the second part consists in relating the diffusion coefficient to measurable physical quantities. In this way Einstein was able to determine the size of atoms, and how many atoms there are in a mole, or the molecular weight in grams, of a gas. In accordance to <a href="Avogadro%27s%20law">Avogadro's law</a> this volume is the same for all ideal gases, which is 22.414 liters at standard temperature and pressure. The number of atoms contained in this volume is referred to as <a href="Avogadro%20constant">Avogadro's constant</a>, and the determination of this number is tantamount to the knowledge of the mass of an atom since the latter is obtained by dividing the mass of a mole of the gas by Avogadro's constant.

The first part of Einstein's argument was to determine how far a Brownian particle travels in a given time interval. Classical mechanics is unable to determine this distance because of the enormous number of bombardments a Brownian particle will undergo, roughly of the order of 10 collisions per second. Thus Einstein was led to consider the collective motion of Brownian particles.

He regarded the increment of particle positions in unrestricted one dimensional ("x") domain as a random variable (formula_1 or "x", under coordinate transformation so that the origin lies at the initial position of the particle) with some probability density function formula_2. Further, assuming conservation of particle number, he expanded the density (number of particles per unit volume) change in a Taylor series:

The integral in the first term is equal to one by the definition of probability, and the second and other even terms (i.e. first and other odd moments) vanish because of space symmetry. What is left gives rise to the following relation:

Where the coefficient before the Laplacian, the second moment of probability of displacement formula_1, is interpreted as <a href="mass%20diffusivity">mass diffusivity</a> "D":

Then the density of Brownian particles ρ at point "x" at time "t" satisfies the diffusion equation:

Assuming that N particles start from the origin at the initial time t=0, the diffusion equation has the solution

This expression (which is a <a href="normal%20distribution">normal distribution</a> with the mean formula_9 and variance formula_10 usually called Brownian motion formula_11) allowed Einstein to calculate the <a href="Moment%20%28mathematics%29">moments</a> directly. The first moment is seen to vanish, meaning that the Brownian particle is equally likely to move to the left as it is to move to the right. The second moment is, however, non-vanishing, being given by

This expresses the mean squared displacement in terms of the time elapsed and the diffusivity. From this expression Einstein argued that the displacement of a Brownian particle is not proportional to the elapsed time, but rather to its square root. His argument is based on a conceptual switch from the "ensemble" of Brownian particles to the "single" Brownian particle: we can speak of the relative number of particles at a single instant just as well as of the time it takes a Brownian particle to reach a given point.

The second part of Einstein's theory relates the diffusion constant to physically measurable quantities, such as the mean squared displacement of a particle in a given time interval. This result enables the experimental determination of Avogadro's number and therefore the size of molecules. Einstein analyzed a dynamic equilibrium being established between opposing forces. The beauty of his argument is that the final result does not depend upon which forces are involved in setting up the dynamic equilibrium.

In his original treatment, Einstein considered an osmotic pressure experiment, but the same conclusion can be reached in other ways.

Consider, for instance, particles suspended in a viscous fluid in a gravitational field. Gravity tends to make the particles settle, whereas diffusion acts to homogenize them, driving them into regions of smaller concentration. Under the action of gravity, a particle acquires a downward speed of "v" = μ"mg", where "m" is the mass of the particle, "g" is the acceleration due to gravity, and μ is the particle's <a href="Einstein%20relation%20%28kinetic%20theory%29">mobility</a> in the fluid. <a href="Sir%20George%20Stokes%2C%201st%20Baronet">George Stokes</a> had shown that the mobility for a spherical particle with radius "r" is formula_13, where η is the <a href="dynamic%20viscosity">dynamic viscosity</a> of the fluid. In a state of dynamic equilibrium, the particles are distributed according to the barometric distribution

where ρ−ρ is the difference in density of particles separated by a height difference of "h", "k" is <a href="Boltzmann%27s%20constant">Boltzmann's constant</a> (namely, the ratio of the <a href="universal%20gas%20constant">universal gas constant</a>, "R", to Avogadro's number, "N"), and "T" is the absolute temperature. It is Avogadro's number that is to be determined.
Dynamic equilibrium is established because the more that particles are pulled down by gravity, the greater is the tendency for the particles to migrate to regions of lower concentration. The flux is given by <a href="Fick%27s%20laws%20of%20diffusion">Fick's law</a>,

where "J" = ρ"v". Introducing the formula for ρ, we find that

In a state of dynamical equilibrium, this speed must also be equal to "v" = μ"mg". Notice that both expressions for "v" are proportional to "mg", reflecting how the derivation is independent of the type of forces considered. Equating these two expressions yields a formula for the diffusivity:

Here the first equality follows from the first part of Einstein's theory, the third equality follows from the definition of Boltzmann's constant as "k" = "R / N", and the fourth equality follows from Stokes' formula for the mobility. By measuring the mean squared displacement over a time interval along with the universal gas constant "R", the temperature "T", the viscosity η, and the particle radius "r", Avogadro's number "N" can be determined.

The type of dynamical equilibrium proposed by Einstein was not new. It had been pointed out previously by <a href="J.%20J.%20Thomson">J. J. Thomson</a> in his series of lectures at Yale University in May 1903 that the dynamic equilibrium between the velocity generated by a concentration gradient given by Fick's law and the velocity due to the variation of the partial pressure caused when ions are set in motion "gives us a method of determining Avogadro's Constant which is independent of any hypothesis as to the shape or size of molecules, or of the way in which they act upon each other".

An identical expression to Einstein's formula for the diffusion coefficient was also found by <a href="Walther%20Nernst">Walther Nernst</a> in 1888 in which he expressed the diffusion coefficient as the ratio of the osmotic pressure to the ratio of the frictional force and the velocity to which it gives rise. The former was equated to the <a href="Van%20%27t%20Hoff%20factor">law of van 't Hoff</a> while the latter was given by <a href="Stokes%27%20law">Stokes's law</a>. He writes formula_18 for the diffusion coefficient "k′", where formula_19 is the osmotic pressure and "k" is the ratio of the frictional force to the molecular viscosity which he assumes is given by Stokes's formula for the viscosity. Introducing the ideal gas law per unit volume for the osmotic pressure, the formula becomes identical to that of Einstein's. The use of Stokes's law in Nernst's case, as well as in Einstein and Smoluchowski, is not strictly applicable since it does not apply to the case where the radius of the sphere is small in comparison with the mean free path.

At first, the predictions of Einstein's formula were seemingly refuted by a series of experiments by Svedberg in 1906 and 1907, which gave displacements of the particles as 4 to 6 times the predicted value, and by Henri in 1908 who found displacements 3 times greater than Einstein's formula predicted. But Einstein's predictions were finally confirmed in a series of experiments carried out by Chaudesaigues in 1908 and Perrin in 1909. The confirmation of Einstein's theory constituted empirical progress for the kinetic theory of heat. In essence, Einstein showed that the motion can be predicted directly from the kinetic model of thermal equilibrium. The importance of the theory lay in the fact that it confirmed the kinetic theory's account of the second law of <a href="thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a> as being an essentially statistical law.

<a href="Marian%20Smoluchowski">Smoluchowski</a>'s theory of Brownian motion starts from the same premise as that of Einstein and derives the same probability distribution ρ("x", "t") for the displacement of a Brownian particle along the "x" in time "t". He therefore gets the same expression for the mean squared displacement: formula_20. However, when he relates it to a particle of mass "m" moving at a velocity "u" which is the result of a frictional force governed by Stokes's law, he finds
where μ is the viscosity coefficient, and "a" is the radius of the particle. Associating the kinetic energy formula_22 with the thermal energy "RT/N", the expression for the mean squared displacement is 64/27 times that found by Einstein. The fraction 27/64 was commented on by <a href="Arnold%20Sommerfeld">Arnold Sommerfeld</a> in his necrology on Smoluchowski: "The numerical coefficient of Einstein, which differs from Smoluchowski by 27/64 can only be put in doubt."

Smoluchowski attempts to answer the question of why a Brownian particle should be displaced by bombardments of smaller particles when the probabilities for striking it in the forward and rear directions are equal. In order to do so, he uses, unknowingly, the <a href="ballot%20theorem">ballot theorem</a>, first proved by <a href="William%20Allen%20Whitworth">W.A. Whitworth</a> in 1878. The ballot theorem states that if a candidate A scores "m" votes and candidate B scores "n" − "m" that the probability throughout the counting that A will have more votes than B is

no matter how large the total number of votes "n" may be. In other words, if one candidate has an edge on the other candidate he will tend to keep that edge even though there is nothing favoring either candidate on a ballot extraction.

If the probability of "m" gains and "n" − "m" losses follows a <a href="binomial%20distribution">binomial distribution</a>,

with equal "a priori" probabilities of 1/2, the mean total gain is

If "n" is large enough so that Stirling's approximation can be used in the form
then the expected total gain will be
showing that it increases as the square root of the total population.

Suppose that a Brownian particle of mass "M" is surrounded by lighter particles of mass "m" which are traveling at a speed "u". Then, reasons Smoluchowski, in any collision between a surrounding and Brownian particles, the velocity transmitted to the latter will be "mu"/"M". This ratio is of the order of 10 cm/s. But we also have to take into consideration that in a gas there will be more than 10 collisions in a second, and even greater in a liquid where we expect that there will be 10 collision in one second. Some of these collisions will tend to accelerate the Brownian particle; others will tend to decelerate it. If there is a mean excess of one kind of collision or the other to be of the order of 10 to 10 collisions in one second, then velocity of the Brownian particle may be anywhere between 10 and 1000 cm/s. Thus, even though there are equal probabilities for forward and backward collisions there will be a net tendency to keep the Brownian particle in motion, just as the ballot theorem predicts.

These orders of magnitude are not exact because they don't take into consideration the velocity of the Brownian particle, "U", which depends on the collisions that tend to accelerate and decelerate it. The larger "U" is, the greater will be the collisions that will retard it so that the velocity of a Brownian particle can never increase without limit. Could such a process occur, it would be tantamount to a perpetual motion of the second type. And since equipartition of energy applies, the kinetic energy of the Brownian particle, formula_28, will be equal, on the average, to the kinetic energy of the surrounding fluid particle, formula_29.

In 1906 Smoluchowski published a one-dimensional model to describe a particle undergoing Brownian motion. The model assumes collisions with "M" ≫ "m" where "M" is the test particle's mass and "m" the mass of one of the individual particles composing the fluid. It is assumed that the particle collisions are confined to one dimension and that it is equally probable for the test particle to be hit from the left as from the right. It is also assumed that every collision always imparts the same magnitude of Δ"V". If "N" is the number of collisions from the right and "N" the number of collisions from the left then after "N" collisions the particle's velocity will have changed by Δ"V"(2"N" − "N"). The <a href="multiplicity%20%28mathematics%29">multiplicity</a> is then simply given by:

and the total number of possible states is given by 2. Therefore, the probability of the particle being hit from the right "N" times is:

As a result of its simplicity, Smoluchowski's 1D model can only qualitatively describe Brownian motion. For a realistic particle undergoing Brownian motion in a fluid many of the assumptions cannot be made. For example, the assumption that on average there occurs an equal number of collisions from the right as from the left falls apart once the particle is in motion. Also, there would be a distribution of different possible Δ"V"s instead of always just one in a realistic situation.

The equations governing Brownian motion relate slightly differently to each of the two definitions of "Brownian motion" given at the start of this article.

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, Brownian motion is described by the Wiener process; a continuous-time <a href="stochastic%20process">stochastic process</a> named in honor of <a href="Norbert%20Wiener">Norbert Wiener</a>. It is one of the best known <a href="L%C3%A9vy%20process">Lévy process</a>es (<a href="c%C3%A0dl%C3%A0g">càdlàg</a> stochastic processes with <a href="stationary%20process">stationary</a> <a href="statistical%20independence">independent</a> increments) and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, <a href="economy">economics</a> and <a href="physics">physics</a>.

The Wiener process "W" is characterised by four facts:
formula_34 denotes the <a href="normal%20distribution">normal distribution</a> with <a href="expected%20value">expected value</a> μ and <a href="variance">variance</a> σ. The condition that it has independent increments means that if formula_35 then formula_36 and formula_37 are independent random variables.

An alternative characterisation of the Wiener process is the so-called "Lévy characterisation" that says that the Wiener process is an almost surely continuous <a href="martingale%20%28probability%20theory%29">martingale</a> with "W" = 0 and <a href="quadratic%20variation">quadratic variation</a> formula_38.

A third characterisation is that the Wiener process has a spectral representation as a sine series whose coefficients are independent formula_39 random variables. This representation can be obtained using the <a href="Karhunen%E2%80%93Lo%C3%A8ve%20theorem">Karhunen–Loève theorem</a>.

The Wiener process can be constructed as the <a href="scaling%20limit">scaling limit</a> of a <a href="random%20walk">random walk</a>, or other discrete-time stochastic processes with stationary independent increments. This is known as <a href="Donsker%27s%20theorem">Donsker's theorem</a>. Like the random walk, the Wiener process is recurrent in one or two dimensions (meaning that it returns almost surely to any fixed <a href="neighborhood%20%28mathematics%29">neighborhood</a> of the origin infinitely often) whereas it is not recurrent in dimensions three and higher. Unlike the random walk, it is <a href="scale%20invariance">scale invariant</a>.

The time evolution of the position of the Brownian particle itself can be described approximately by a <a href="Langevin%20equation">Langevin equation</a>, an equation which involves a random force field representing the effect of the <a href="thermal%20fluctuations">thermal fluctuations</a> of the solvent on the Brownian particle. On long timescales, the mathematical Brownian motion is well described by a Langevin equation. On small timescales, <a href="inertia">inertia</a>l effects are prevalent in the Langevin equation. However the mathematical "Brownian motion" is exempt of such inertial effects. Note that inertial effects have to be considered in the Langevin equation, otherwise the equation becomes singular. so that simply removing the <a href="inertia">inertia</a> term from this equation would not yield an exact description, but rather a singular behavior in which the particle doesn't move at all.

The <a href="diffusion%20equation">diffusion equation</a> yields an approximation of the time evolution of the <a href="probability%20density%20function">probability density function</a> associated to the position of the particle going under a Brownian movement under the physical definition. The approximation is valid on <a href="Langevin%20equation">short</a> timescales.

The time evolution of the position of the Brownian particle itself is best described using <a href="Langevin%20equation">Langevin equation</a>, an equation which involves a random force field representing the effect of the <a href="thermal%20fluctuations">thermal fluctuations</a> of the solvent on the particle.

The displacement of a particle undergoing Brownian motion is obtained by solving the <a href="diffusion%20equation">diffusion equation</a> under appropriate boundary conditions and finding the <a href="root%20mean%20square">rms</a> of the solution. This shows that the displacement varies as the square root of the time (not linearly), which explains why previous experimental results concerning the velocity of Brownian particles gave nonsensical results. A linear time dependence was incorrectly assumed.

At very short time scales, however, the motion of a particle is dominated by its inertia and its displacement will be linearly dependent on time: Δ"x" = "v"Δ"t". So the instantaneous velocity of the Brownian motion can be measured as "v" = Δ"x"/Δ"t", when Δ"t" « "τ", where "τ" is the momentum relaxation time. In 2010, the instantaneous velocity of a Brownian particle (a glass microsphere trapped in air with an optical tweezer) was measured successfully. The velocity data verified the <a href="Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann%20distribution">Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution</a>, and the equipartition theorem for a Brownian particle.

The Brownian motion can be modeled by a random walk. Random walks in porous media or fractals are anomalous.

In the general case, Brownian motion is a <a href="Markov%20process">non-Markov random process</a> and described by <a href="Stochastic%20calculus">stochastic integral equations</a>.

The French mathematician <a href="Paul%20L%C3%A9vy%20%28mathematician%29">Paul Lévy</a> proved the following theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a continuous R-valued stochastic process "X" to actually be "n"-dimensional Brownian motion. Hence, Lévy's condition can actually be used as an alternative definition of Brownian motion.

Let "X" = ("X", ..., "X") be a continuous stochastic process on a <a href="probability%20space">probability space</a> (Ω, Σ, P) taking values in R. Then the following are equivalent:


The <a href="Infinitesimal%20generator%20%28stochastic%20processes%29">infinitesimal generator</a> (and hence characteristic operator) of a Brownian motion on R is easily calculated to be ½Δ, where Δ denotes the <a href="Laplace%20operator">Laplace operator</a>. In <a href="image%20processing">image processing</a> and <a href="computer%20vision">computer vision</a>, the Laplacian operator has been used for various tasks such as blob and <a href="edge%20detection">edge detection</a>. This observation is useful in defining Brownian motion on an "m"-dimensional <a href="Riemannian%20manifold">Riemannian manifold</a> ("M", "g"): a Brownian motion on "M" is defined to be a diffusion on "M" whose characteristic operator formula_40 in local coordinates "x", 1 ≤ "i" ≤ "m", is given by ½Δ, where Δ is the <a href="Laplace%E2%80%93Beltrami%20operator">Laplace–Beltrami operator</a> given in local coordinates by

where ["g"] = ["g"] in the sense of <a href="Invertible%20matrix">the inverse of a square matrix</a>.

In <a href="stellar%20dynamics">stellar dynamics</a>, a massive body (star, <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>, etc.) can experience Brownian motion as it responds to <a href="gravitational">gravitational forces</a> from surrounding stars. The rms velocity "V" of the massive object, of mass "M", is related to the rms velocity formula_42 of the background stars by
where formula_44 is the mass of the background stars. The gravitational force from the massive object causes nearby stars to move faster than they otherwise would, increasing both formula_42 and "V". The Brownian velocity of <a href="Sagittarius%20A%2A">Sgr A*</a>, the <a href="supermassive%20black%20hole">supermassive black hole</a> at the center of the <a href="Milky%20Way%20galaxy">Milky Way galaxy</a>, is predicted from this formula to be less than 1 km "s".

The <a href="narrow%20escape%20problem">narrow escape problem</a> is a ubiquitous problem in biology, biophysics and cellular biology which has the following formulation: a Brownian particle (<a href="ion">ion</a>, <a href="molecule">molecule</a>, or <a href="protein">protein</a>) is confined to a bounded domain (a compartment or a cell) by a reflecting boundary, except for a small window through which it can escape. The narrow escape problem is that of calculating the mean escape time. This time diverges as the window shrinks, thus rendering the calculation a <a href="singular%20perturbation">singular perturbation</a> problem.
