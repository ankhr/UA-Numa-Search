Ahmed al-Nami

Ahmed bin Abdullah al-Nami (<a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>: أحمد بن عبد الله النعمي, ; also <a href="transliteration">transliterated</a> as Alnami; August 17, 1977 – September 11, 2001) was one of four <a href="Hijackers%20in%20the%20September%2011%20attacks">hijackers</a> of <a href="United%20Airlines%20Flight%2093">United Airlines Flight 93</a> as part of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>. 

Born in <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, Nami had served as a <a href="muezzin">muezzin</a> and was a college student. He left his family in 2000 to complete the <a href="Hajj">Hajj</a>, but later went to <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> bound for an <a href="al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> training camp where he befriended other future hijackers and would soon be chosen to participate in the attacks.

He arrived in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> in May 2001, on a tourist visa, where he would settle in <a href="Florida">Florida</a> up until the attacks. On September 11, 2001, Nami boarded <a href="United%20Airlines%20Flight%2093">United 93</a> and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which crashed into a field in rural <a href="Shanksville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Shanksville, Pennsylvania</a>, after a passenger uprising, due to the passengers receiving information from their families of the three other hijacked planes that hit the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973-2001%29">World Trade Center</a> and <a href="the%20Pentagon">the Pentagon</a>.

Nami, much like <a href="Abdulaziz%20al-Omari">Abdulaziz al-Omari</a>, <a href="Wail%20al-Shehri">Wail al-Shehri</a>, <a href="Waleed%20al-Shehri">Waleed al-Shehri</a> and <a href="Mohand%20al-Shehri">Mohand al-Shehri</a>, was born in the <a href="%27Asir%20Province">'Asir Province</a> in <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>. Born to the <a href="Quraysh%20%28tribe%29">Quraish</a> tribe of <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, Nami served as a <a href="muezzin">muezzin</a> at the Seqeley mosque after having reportedly become very religious sometime in early 1999. That autumn he left his family home in <a href="Khamis%20Mushayt">Khamis Mushayt</a> in the summer of 2000 to complete the <a href="Hajj">Hajj</a>, but never returned – instead travelling to the <a href="Al%20Farouq%20training%20camp">Al Farouq training camp</a> in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> where he met and befriended <a href="Waleed%20al-Shehri">Waleed</a> and <a href="Wail%20al-Shehri">Wail al-Shehri</a>, two brothers from Khamis Mushayt, and <a href="Saeed%20al-Ghamdi">Saeed al-Ghamdi</a>. The four reportedly pledged themselves to <a href="Jihad">Jihad</a> in the Spring of 2000, in a ceremony presided over by Wail – who had dubbed himself "Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi" after one of <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>'s companions. Dubbed "Abu Hashim", Nami was considered "gentle in manner" by his colleagues, and reported that he had a dream in which he rode a <a href="mare">mare</a> along with <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>, and that the prophet told him to dismount and fight his enemies to liberate his land.

During his time at al-Farooq, there is a curious mention under <a href="Mushabib%20al-Hamlan">Mushabib al-Hamlan</a>'s details that Nami had recently had <a href="laser%20eye%20surgery">laser eye surgery</a>, an uncited fact that does not reappear. 

By October he had taken a prospective hijacker <a href="Mushabib%20al-Hamlan">Mushabib al-Hamlan</a> from <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> to Saudi Arabia where they both procured B-1/B-2 tourist/business visas on October 28 – but Hamlan then decided not to proceed and is thought to have returned to his family. Nami's visa application has since been reviewed, and while he mentioned that Mushabib will be travelling with him, he listed his occupation as "student" but failed to provide an address for his school, and listed his intended address in the United States merely as <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> – in the end he never used this visa to enter the United States, and reported his <a href="passport">passport</a> (C115007, which showed evidence of travel to <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>) as "lost", and procured a new one from <a href="Jeddah">Jeddah</a> (C505363). He used the new passport to acquire a new B-1/B-2 visa in Jeddah on April 23, again recopying his answers from previously although crossing out the lines regarding Mushabib and previous attempts to acquire a visa. He was interviewed by a consular officer, who again approved his application. Records at the time only recorded past failures to procure a visa, so the officer had no way of realising that Nami had successfully received an earlier visa.

In mid-November 2000, the 9/11 Commission believes that Nami, <a href="Wail%20al-Shehri">Wail</a> and <a href="Waleed%20al-Shehri">Waleed al-Shehri</a>, all of whom had obtained their U.S. visas in late October, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a> and then onward to <a href="Iran">Iran</a> where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. This probably followed their return to Saudi Arabia to get "clean" passports. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence. 

While in the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>, Nami purchased <a href="traveler%27s%20cheque">traveler's cheque</a>s presumed to have been paid for by <a href="Mustafa%20al-Hawsawi">Mustafa al-Hawsawi</a>. Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including <a href="Majed%20Moqed">Majed Moqed</a>, <a href="Saeed%20al-Ghamdi">Saeed al-Ghamdi</a>, <a href="Hamza%20al-Ghamdi">Hamza al-Ghamdi</a>, <a href="Ahmed%20al-Haznawi">Ahmed al-Haznawi</a> and <a href="Wail%20al-Shehri">Wail al-Shehri</a>.

In March 2001, Ahmed al-Nami appeared in an <a href="al-Qaeda">al-Qaeda</a> farewell video showing 13 of the "muscle hijackers" before they left their training centre in <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a>; while he does not speak, he is seen studying maps and flight manuals.

On April 23, Nami was recorded obtaining a new US visa.

On May 28, Nami arrived in the United States from <a href="Dubai">Dubai</a> with fellow-hijackers <a href="Mohand%20al-Shehri">Mohand al-Shehri</a> and <a href="Hamza%20al-Ghamdi">Hamza al-Ghamdi</a>. By early June, Nami was living in apartment 1504 at the Delray Racquet Club condominiums with <a href="Saeed%20al-Ghamdi">Saeed al-Ghamdi</a> in <a href="Delray%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Delray Beach, Florida</a>. He <a href="telephone">telephone</a>d his family in 'Asir shortly after arriving in the country.

In June, he phoned his family for the last time.

He was one of 9 hijackers to open a <a href="SunTrust">SunTrust</a> bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001, and on June 29 received either a Florida State Identification Card or Drivers License. 

He may have been one of three hijackers that listed the Naval Air Station in <a href="Pensacola%2C%20Florida">Pensacola, Florida</a> as their permanent address on drivers' licenses, though other sources claim he listed the Delray condominium.

On August 28, Nami and <a href="Ahmed%20al-Haznawi">Ahmed al-Haznawi</a> reportedly bothered a <a href="Delray%20Beach">Delray Beach</a> resident, Maria Siscar Simpson, to let them through her apartment to retrieve a towel that had fallen off their balcony onto hers.

On September 5, Nami and <a href="Saeed%20al-Ghamdi">Saeed al-Ghamdi</a> purchased tickets for a September 7 flight to <a href="Newark%20Liberty%20International%20Airport">Newark</a> at Mile High Travel on Commercial Boulevard—paying cash for their tickets. <a href="Ziad%20Jarrah">Ziad Jarrah</a> and <a href="Ahmed%20al-Haznawi">Ahmed al-Haznawi</a> also purchased tickets for the same flight from Passage Tours.

On September 7, all four Flight 93 hijackers flew from <a href="Fort%20Lauderdale">Fort Lauderdale</a> to <a href="Newark%20International%20Airport">Newark International Airport</a> aboard <a href="Spirit%20Airlines">Spirit Airlines</a>.

On September 11, 2001, Nami arrived in Newark to board <a href="United%20Airlines%20Flight%2093">United Airlines Flight 93</a> along with <a href="Saeed%20al-Ghamdi">Saeed al-Ghamdi</a>, <a href="Ahmed%20al-Haznawi">Ahmed al-Haznawi</a> and <a href="Ziad%20Jarrah">Ziad Jarrah</a>. Some reports suggest Haznawi was pulled aside for screening while others claim there is no record of whether any of the four were screened; the lack of <a href="Closed-circuit%20television">CCTV</a> cameras at the time has compounded the problem. Nami boarded the plane between 7:39 am and 7:48 am; seated in First Class 3C, next to Saeed al-Ghamdi.

Due to the flight's routine delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings and were told to be on the alert, though within two minutes Jarrah had stormed the cockpit leaving the pilots dead or injured.

At least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas, which some have questioned may have signified an allegiance to the <a href="Egyptian%20Islamic%20Jihad">Egyptian Islamic Jihad</a>. The calls also indicated that one of the men had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside; it is not known which hijacker this was.

Passengers on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes, and organized a brief assault to retake the cockpit. The hijackers crashed the plane into the <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>n countryside rather than cede control of the plane. All aboard died.

After the attacks, an employee of <a href="Saudi%20Arabian%20Airlines">Saudi Arabian Airlines</a> named Ahmed al-Nami came forward to say that he feared his identity had been stolen, although he had never lost his passport.

He has been portrayed by British actor <a href="Jamie%20Harding">Jamie Harding</a> in the 2006 film "<a href="United%2093%20%28film%29">United 93</a>" and Asim Wali in the film "<a href="Flight%2093%20%282006%20film%29">Flight 93</a>".

Ahmed al-Haznawi

Ahmed Ibrahim al-Haznawi (, ) (October 11, 1980 – September 11, 2001) was one of four <a href="Organizers%20of%20the%20September%2011%20attacks">hijackers</a> of <a href="United%20Airlines%20Flight%2093">United Airlines Flight 93</a> as part of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>.

He left his family to fight in <a href="Chechnya">Chechnya</a> in 2000 but was probably sent to training camps in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. It was there he was chosen to participate in the 9/11 attacks. He arrived in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> in June 2001 under the direction of <a href="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a> for terrorist attacks, on a tourist visa. Once he was in the U.S., he settled in <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and helped plan out how the attacks would take place.

On September 11, 2001, Haznawi boarded <a href="United%20Airlines%20Flight%2093">United Airlines Flight 93</a> and assisted in the hijacking of the plane, which crashed into a field in <a href="Shanksville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Shanksville, Pennsylvania</a>, after a passenger uprising.

Ahmed al-Haznawi was the son of a Saudi <a href="Imam%20%28Sunni%20Islam%29">imam</a> from the <a href="Al-Bahah">Al-Bahah</a> province, a province in the south west of Saudi Arabia. Haznawi grew up in the village of Hazna, where his father was a cleric at the mosque in the central marketplace section of the village. Haznawi belonged to a family that was part of the larger, al-Ghamdi tribe, sharing the same tribal affiliation with fellow hijackers <a href="Saeed%20al-Ghamdi">Saeed al-Ghamdi</a>, <a href="Hamza%20al-Ghamdi">Hamza al-Ghamdi</a>, and <a href="Ahmed%20al-Ghamdi">Ahmed al-Ghamdi</a>. He memorised the <a href="Quran">Quran</a>, giving him the title <a href="Hafiz%20%28Qur%27an%29">Hafiz</a>.

This group is noted as being some of the more religiously observant of the hijackers, and they are thought to have met one another some time in 1999.

Alghamdi announced he was leaving his family in 1999 to <a href="Second%20Chechen%20War">fight in Chechnya</a>, although his father forbade him. His father and brother, Abdul Rahman al-Haznawi, reportedly last heard from him in late 2000, after he made references to <a href="Afghan%20training%20camp">training in Afghanistan</a>.

On November 12, 2000, Haznawi applied for and received a two-year U.S. <a href="B-1/B-2%20Visa">B-1/B-2
(tourist/business) visa</a> in <a href="Jeddah%2C%20Saudi%20Arabia">Jeddah, Saudi Arabia</a>.

From November 27, 2000, through December 27, 2000, Haznawi was in <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> for <a href="Ramadan">Ramadan</a>. It is theorized that during this trip, he may have initially told <a href="Saeed%20al-Ghamdi">Saeed</a> and <a href="Hamza%20al-Ghamdi">Hamza al-Ghamdi</a> about the operation.

Some time late in 2000, Haznawi traveled to the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>, where he purchased <a href="traveler%27s%20cheque">traveler's cheque</a>s presumed to have been paid for by <a href="Mustafa%20al-Hawsawi">Mustafa al-Hawsawi</a>. Five other hijackers also passed through the UAE and purchased travellers cheques, including <a href="Majed%20Moqed">Majed Moqed</a>, <a href="Saeed%20al-Ghamdi">Saeed al-Ghamdi</a>, <a href="Hamza%20al-Ghamdi">Hamza al-Ghamdi</a>, <a href="Wail%20al-Shehri">Wail al-Shehri</a> and <a href="Ahmed%20al-Nami">Ahmed al-Nami</a>.

He was one of four hijackers believed to be staying at a <a href="Kandahar">Kandahar</a> <a href="guest%20house%20%28lodging%29">guest house</a> in March 2001, where they were seen by <a href="Mohammed%20Jabarah">Mohammed Jabarah</a>. Jabarah remembered Haznawi specifically, saying that he was "very devout and could <a href="Hafiz%20%28Quran%29">recite the entire Koran from memory</a>."

On June 8, he arrived in <a href="Miami">Miami</a>, Florida, with fellow hijacker <a href="Wail%20al-Shehri">Wail al-Shehri</a>. He was one of 9 hijackers to open a <a href="SunTrust">SunTrust</a> bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001. He is believed to have moved in with <a href="Ziad%20Jarrah">Ziad Jarrah</a>, who got a new apartment on Bougainvilla Dr. in <a href="Lauderdale-by-the-Sea">Lauderdale-by-the-Sea</a>, after both men gave the landlord photocopies of their German passports, which he later turned over to the FBI.

On June 25, Jarrah took Haznawi to <a href="Holy%20Cross%20Hospital%20%28Fort%20Lauderdale%29">Holy Cross Hospital</a> in <a href="Fort%20Lauderdale">Fort Lauderdale</a> on advice of his landlord Charles Lisa. Haznawi was treated by Dr. Christos Tsonas, who gave him antibiotics for a small gash on his left calf. While he told staff that he had bumped into a suitcase, the media briefly reported it as a sign of <a href="anthrax">cutaneous anthrax</a> and a possible link to the <a href="2001%20anthrax%20attacks">2001 anthrax attacks</a>, although FBI later addressed the rumors stating that "Exhaustive testing did not support that anthrax was present anywhere the hijackers had been."

On July 10, Haznawi obtained a Florida driver's license, later obtaining another copy on September 7, 2001, by filling out a change-of-address form. Five other hijackers also received duplicate Florida licenses in 2001, and others had licenses from different states. Some have speculated that this was to allow multiple persons to use the same identity.

Jarrah and Haznawi both received their one-way tickets for United Airlines Flight 93, on September 5. On September 7, all four Flight 93 hijackers flew from <a href="Fort%20Lauderdale">Fort Lauderdale</a> to <a href="Newark%20International%20Airport">Newark International Airport</a> aboard <a href="Spirit%20Airlines">Spirit Airlines</a>.

On September 11, 2001, Haznawi arrived at <a href="Newark%20International%20Airport">Newark International Airport</a> to board Flight 93. Although he was selected for additional security by <a href="Computer%20Assisted%20Passenger%20Prescreening%20System">CAPPS</a> and screened, he was able to board the flight without incident, with only his checked bags requiring extra screening for explosives.

Due to the flight's delay, the pilot and crew were notified of the previous hijackings that day and were told to be on the alert. Within minutes, Flight 93 was hijacked as well.

At least two of the cellphone calls made by passengers indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas, which some believe may have signified an allegiance to the <a href="Egyptian%20Islamic%20Jihad">Egyptian Islamic Jihad</a>. The calls also indicated that one of the men had tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside – it is not known which hijacker this was. Some passengers expressed doubt that the bomb was real.

<a href="Passengers">Passengers</a> on the plane heard through phone calls the fates of the other hijacked planes. A passenger uprising soon took place. Hijacker-pilot, <a href="Ziad%20Jarrah">Ziad Jarrah</a>, crashed the plane into an empty field near <a href="Shanksville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Shanksville, Pennsylvania</a>, in order to prevent the passengers from gaining control of the plane. The crash killed everyone on board.

After the attacks, before the release of the FBI pictures of the hijackers, <a href="Arab%20News">Arab News</a> reported that Haznawi's brother Abdul Rahman had told al-Madinah newspaper that a photograph published by local newspapers bore no resemblance to his brother.

A videotape titled "The Wills of the New York and Washington Battle Martyrs" was aired on <a href="Al%20Jazeera">Al Jazeera</a> on April 16, 2002. While the name beneath the speaker read "al-Ghamdi", the image is of Haznawi speaking. Officials suggested that the name was merely a reference to his tribal affiliation. The film was thought to have been made in March 2001. In it, he talked about his plans to bring the "bloodied message" to America. In September 2002, a similar tape made by <a href="Abdulaziz%20al-Omari">Abdulaziz al-Omari</a> appeared.

He has been portrayed by actors <a href="Omar%20Berdouni">Omar Berdouni</a> in "<a href="United%2093%20%28film%29">United 93</a>", and Zak Santiago in "<a href="Flight%2093%20%28TV%20film%29">Flight 93</a>".

<doc id="3225" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3225" title="Athanasius of Alexandria">
Athanasius of Alexandria

Saint Athanasius of Alexandria (; ; c. 296–298 – 2 May 373), also called Athanasius the Great, Athanasius the Confessor or, primarily in the <a href="Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church">Coptic Orthodox Church</a>, Athanasius the Apostolic, was the 20th <a href="bishop%20of%20Alexandria">bishop of Alexandria</a> (as Athanasius I). His episcopate lasted 45 years (c. 8 June 328 – 2 May 373), of which over 17 were spent in five exiles ordered by four different <a href="Roman%20emperors">Roman emperors</a>. Athanasius was a <a href="Christian%20theologian">Christian theologian</a>, a <a href="Church%20Father">Church Father</a>, the chief defender of <a href="Trinitarianism">Trinitarianism</a> against <a href="Arianism">Arianism</a>, and a noted <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>ian leader of the fourth century.

Conflict with <a href="Arius">Arius</a> and Arianism as well as successive Roman emperors shaped Athanasius' career. In 325, at the age of 27, Athanasius began his leading role against the Arians as a deacon and assistant to Bishop <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20I%20of%20Alexandria">Alexander of Alexandria</a> during the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">First Council of Nicaea</a>. Roman emperor <a href="Constantine%20the%20Great">Constantine the Great</a> had convened the council in May–August 325 to address the Arian position that the <a href="Son%20of%20God">Son of God</a>, <a href="Jesus%20of%20Nazareth">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, is of a distinct substance from the Father. Three years after that council, Athanasius succeeded his mentor as archbishop of Alexandria. In addition to the conflict with the Arians (including powerful and influential Arian churchmen led by <a href="Eusebius%20of%20Nicomedia">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a>), he struggled against the Emperors Constantine, <a href="Constantius%20II">Constantius II</a>, <a href="Julian%20%28emperor%29">Julian the Apostate</a> and <a href="Valens">Valens</a>. He was known as "Athanasius Contra Mundum" (Latin for "Athanasius Against the World").

Nonetheless, within a few years after his death, <a href="Gregory%20of%20Nazianzus">Gregory of Nazianzus</a> called him the "Pillar of the Church". His writings were well regarded by all following Church fathers in the West and the East, who noted their rich devotion to the Word-become-man, great pastoral concern and profound interest in monasticism. Athanasius is counted as one of the four great Eastern <a href="Doctors%20of%20the%20Church">Doctors of the Church</a> in the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. In the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>, he is labeled as the "Father of Orthodoxy". Some Protestants label him as "Father of the Canon". Athanasius is venerated as a Christian <a href="saint">saint</a>, whose <a href="feast%20day">feast day</a> is 2 May in <a href="Western%20Christianity">Western Christianity</a>, 15 May in the <a href="Coptic%20Orthodox%20Church">Coptic Orthodox Church</a>, and 18 January in the other <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox Church</a>es. He is venerated by the Oriental and Eastern Orthodox Churches, the Roman Catholic Church, the Lutherans, and the Anglican Communion.

Athanasius was born to a Christian family in the city of <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> or possibly the nearby Nile Delta town of Damanhur sometime between the years 293 and 298. The earlier date is sometimes assigned due to the maturity revealed in his two earliest treatises "Contra Gentes" ("Against the Heathens") and "De Incarnatione" ("On the Incarnation"), which were admittedly written about the year 318 before Arianism had begun to make itself felt, as those writings do not show an awareness of Arianism.

However Cornelius Clifford places his birth no earlier than 296 and no later than 298, based on the fact that Athanasius indicates no first hand recollection of the <a href="Diocletianic%20Persecution">Maximian persecution</a> of 303, which he suggests Athanasius would have remembered if he had been ten years old at the time. Secondly, the "Festal Epistles" state that the Arians had accused Athanasius, among other charges, of not having yet attained the canonical age (30) and thus could not have been properly ordained as Patriarch of Alexandria in 328. The accusation must have seemed plausible. The Orthodox Church places his year of birth around 297.

His parents were wealthy enough to afford giving him a fine secular education. He was, nevertheless, clearly not a member of the Egyptian aristocracy. Some Western scholars consider his command of <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, in which he wrote most (if not all) of his surviving works, evidence that he may have been a <a href="Greek%20people">Greek</a> born in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. Historical evidence, however, indicates that he was fluent in <a href="Coptic%20language">Coptic</a> as well given the regions of Egypt where he was preached. Some surviving copies of his writings are in fact in Coptic, though scholars differ as to whether he himself wrote them in Coptic originally (which would make him the first patriarch to do so), or whether these were translations of writings originally in Greek.

<a href="Tyrannius%20Rufinus">Rufinus</a> relates a story that as Bishop <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20I%20of%20Alexandria">Alexander</a> stood by a window, he watched boys playing on the seashore below, imitating the ritual of Christian baptism. He sent for the children and discovered that one of the boys (Athanasius) had acted as bishop. After questioning Athanasius, Bishop Alexander informed him that the baptisms were genuine, as both the <a href="Sacramental%20matter%20and%20form">form and matter of the sacrament</a> had been performed through the recitation of the correct words and the administration of water, and that he must not continue to do this as those baptized had not been properly <a href="Catechesis">catechized</a>. He invited Athanasius and his playfellows to prepare for clerical careers.

<a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> was the most important trade center in the whole empire during Athanasius's boyhood. Intellectually, morally, and politically—it epitomized the ethnically diverse Graeco-Roman world, even more than Rome or Constantinople, Antioch or Marseilles. Its famous catechetical school, while sacrificing none of its famous passion for orthodoxy since the days of <a href="Pantaenus">Pantaenus</a>, <a href="Clement%20of%20Alexandria">Clement of Alexandria</a>, <a href="Origen%20of%20Alexandria">Origen of Alexandria</a>, <a href="Dionysius%20of%20Alexandria">Dionysius</a> and <a href="Theognostus">Theognostus</a>, had begun to take on an almost secular character in the comprehensiveness of its interests, and had counted influential pagans among its serious auditors.

Athanasius recounts being a student, as well as being educated by the Martyrs of the Great (tenth) and last persecution of Christianity by pagan Rome. This persecution was most severe in the East, particularly in Egypt and Palestine. <a href="Pope%20Peter%20I%20of%20Alexandria">Peter of Alexandria</a>, the 17th archbishop of Alexandria, was martyred in 311 in the closing days of that persecution, and may have been one of those teachers. His successor as bishop of Alexandria, <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20I%20of%20Alexandria">Alexander of Alexandria</a> (312–328) was an Origenist as well as a documented mentor of Athanasius. . According to <a href="Sozomen">Sozomen</a>; "the Bishop Alexander 'invited Athanasius to be his commensal and secretary. He had been well educated, and was versed in grammar and rhetoric, and had already, while still a young man, and before reaching the episcopate, given proof to those who dwelt with him of his wisdom and acumen' ".(Soz., II, xvii) 

Athanasius' earliest work, "Against the Heathen – On the Incarnation" (written before 319), bears traces of Origenist Alexandrian thought (such as repeatedly quoting <a href="Plato">Plato</a> and used a definition from <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s "Organon") but in an orthodox way. Athanasius was also familiar with the theories of various philosophical schools, and in particular with the developments of <a href="Neo-Platonism">Neo-Platonism</a>. Ultimately, Athanasius would modify the philosophical thought of the School of Alexandria away from the Origenist principles such as the "entirely allegorical interpretation of the text". Still, in later works, Athanasius quotes <a href="Homer">Homer</a> more than once ("Hist. Ar. 68, Orat. iv. 29"). In his letter to <a href="Constantius%20II">Emperor Constantius</a>, he presents a defense of himself bearing unmistakable traces of a study of <a href="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a> "de Corona".
Athanasius knew <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> and admitted not knowing <a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> [see, e.g., the 39th Festal Letter of St. Athan.]. The Old Testament passages he quotes frequently come from the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> Greek translation. Only rarely did he use other Greek versions (to <a href="Aquila%20of%20Sinope">Aquila</a> once in the "Ecthesis", to other versions once or twice on the Psalms), and his knowledge of the Old Testament was limited to the Septuagint. Nonetheless, during his later exile, with no access to a copy of the Scriptures, Athanasius could quote from memory every verse in the Old Testament with a supposed reference to the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a> without missing any. The combination of Scriptural study and of Greek learning was characteristic of the famous Alexandrian School.

Bishop (or Patriarch, the highest ecclesial rank in the Centre of the Church, in Alexandria) Alexander ordained Athanasius a deacon in 319. In 325, Athanasius served as Alexander's secretary at the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">First Council of Nicaea</a>. Already a recognized theologian and <a href="ascetic">ascetic</a>, he was the obvious choice to replace his aging mentor Alexander as the <a href="Patriarch%20of%20Alexandria">Patriarch of Alexandria</a>, despite the opposition of the followers of Arius and <a href="Meletius%20of%20Lycopolis">Meletius of Lycopolis</a>.

At length, in the Council of Nicaea, the term "consubstantial" (homoṏusion) was suggested by Athanasius: it was immediately adopted, and a formulary of faith embodying it was drawn up by <a href="Hosius%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Hosius of Córdoba</a>. From this time to the end of the Arian controversies the word "consubstantial" continued to be the test of Catholic orthodoxy. The formulary of faith drawn up by Hosius is known as the <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Nicene Creed</a>.. However, "he was not the originator of the famous 'homoṏusion'. The term had been proposed in a non-obvious and illegitimate sense by <a href="Paul%20of%20Samosata">Paul of Samosata</a> to the Fathers at Antioch, and had been rejected by them as savouring of materialistic conceptions of the Godhead."

While still a deacon under Alexander's care (or early in his patriarchate as discussed below) Athanasius may have also become acquainted with some of the solitaries of the Egyptian desert, and in particular <a href="Anthony%20the%20Great">Anthony the Great</a>, whose life he is said to have written.

In about 319, when Athanasius was a <a href="deacon">deacon</a>, a <a href="presbyter">presbyter</a> named <a href="Arius">Arius</a> came into a direct conflict with <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20I%20of%20Alexandria">Alexander of Alexandria</a>. It appears that Arius reproached Alexander for what he felt were misguided or heretical teachings being taught by the bishop. Arius' theological views appear to have been firmly rooted in Alexandrian Christianity, and his Christological views were certainly not radical at all. He embraced a subordinationist <a href="Christology">Christology</a> which taught that Christ was the divine Son (<a href="Logos%20%28Christianity%29">Logos</a>) of God, made, not begotten, heavily influenced by Alexandrian thinkers like <a href="Origen">Origen</a>, and which was a common Christological view in Alexandria at the time. Support for Arius from powerful bishops like <a href="Eusebius%20of%20Caesarea">Eusebius of Caesarea</a> and <a href="Eusebius%20of%20Nicomedia">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a>, further illustrate how Arius's subordinationist Christology was shared by other Christians in the Empire. Arius was subsequently excommunicated by Alexander, and he would begin to elicit the support of many bishops who agreed with his position.

Frances A. M. Forbes writes that when the Patriarch Alexander was on his death-bed he called Athanasius, who fled fearing he would be constrained to be made Bishop. "When the Bishops of the Church assembled to elect their new Patriarch, the whole Catholic population surrounded the church, holding up their hands to Heaven and crying; "Give us Athanasius!" The Bishops had nothing better. Athanasius was thus elected, as Gregory tells us..." (<a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Pope Gregory I</a>, would have full access to the Vatican Archives).

T. Gilmartin, (Professor of History, Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol. 1, Ch XVII: "On the death of Alexander, five months after the termination of the Council of Nicaea, Athanasius was unanimously elected to fill the vacant see. He was most unwilling to accept the dignity, for he clearly foresaw the difficulties in which it would involve him. The clergy and people were determined to have him as their bishop, Patriarch of Alexandria, and refused to accept any excuses. He at length consented to accept a responsibility that he sought in vain to escape, and was consecrated in 326, when he was about thirty years of age."

Athanasius' episcopate began on 9 May 328 as the <a href="Councils%20of%20Alexandria">Alexandrian Council</a> elected Athanasius to succeed the aged Alexander. That council also denounced various heresies and schisms, many of which continued to preoccupy his 45-year-long episcopate (c. 8 June 328 – 2 May 373). Patriarch Athanasius spent over 17 years in five exiles ordered by four different Roman Emperors, not counting approximately six more incidents in which Athanasius fled Alexandria to escape people seeking to take his life. This gave rise to the expression "Athanasius contra mundum" or "Athanasius against the world".

During his first years as bishop, Athanasius visited the churches of his territory, which at that time included all of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="Libya">Libya</a>. He established contacts with the hermits and monks of the desert, including <a href="Pachomius">Pachomius</a>, which proved very valuable to him over the years. Shortly thereafter, Athanasius became occupied with the theological disputes against <a href="Arianism">Arians</a> within the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> that would occupy much of his life.

Athanasius' first problem lay with <a href="Meletius%20of%20Lycopolis">Meletius of Lycopolis</a> and his followers, who had failed to abide by the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">First Council of Nicaea</a>. That council also <a href="anathematized">anathematized</a> Arius. Accused of mistreating Arians and Meletians, Athanasius answered those charges at a gathering of bishops in <a href="Tyre%2C%20Lebanon">Tyre</a>, the <a href="First%20Synod%20of%20Tyre">First Synod of Tyre</a>, in 335. There, <a href="Eusebius%20of%20Nicomedia">Eusebius of Nicomedia</a> and other supporters of Arius deposed Athanasius. On 6 November, both sides of the dispute met with Emperor <a href="Constantine%20I">Constantine I</a> in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. At that meeting, the Arians claimed Athanasius would try to cut off essential Egyptian grain supplies to Constantinople. He was found guilty, and sent into exile to <a href="Augusta%20Treverorum">Augusta Treverorum</a> in Gaul (now <a href="Trier">Trier</a> in Germany).

When Athanasius reached his destination in exile in 336, <a href="Maximinus%20of%20Trier">Maximinus of Trier</a> received him, but not as a disgraced person. Athanasius stayed with him for two years. <a href="Paul%20I%20of%20Constantinople">Paul I of Constantinople</a>, who was banished by the Emperor Constantius, also stayed with him. Maximinus cautioned the Emperor Constans against the Arians, revealing their plots.

When Emperor <a href="Constantine%20I">Constantine I</a> died, Athanasius was allowed to return to his <a href="Episcopal%20see">See</a> of Alexandria. Shortly thereafter, however, Constantine's son, the new <a href="List%20of%20Roman%20emperors">Roman Emperor</a> <a href="Constantius%20II">Constantius II</a>, renewed the order for Athanasius's banishment in 338. Athanasius went to Rome, where he was under the protection of <a href="Constans">Constans</a>, the Emperor of the West. During this time, <a href="Gregory%20of%20Cappadocia">Gregory of Cappadocia</a> was installed as the Patriarch of Alexandria, usurping the absent Athanasius. Athanasius did, however, remain in contact with his people through his annual "Festal Letters", in which he also announced on which date <a href="Easter">Easter</a> would be celebrated that year.

In 339 or 340, nearly one hundred bishops met at Alexandria, declared in favor of Athanasius, and vigorously rejected the criticisms of the Eusebian faction at Tyre. Plus, <a href="Pope%20Julius%20I">Pope Julius I</a> wrote to the supporters of Arius strongly urging Athanasius's reinstatement, but that effort proved in vain. Pope Julius I called a <a href="synod">synod</a> in Rome in 340 to address the matter, which proclaimed Athanasius the rightful bishop of Alexandria.

Early in the year 343 we find Athanasius had travelled, via Rome, from Alexandria, North Africa, to Gaul; nowadays Belgium / Holland and surrounding areas, where <a href="Hosius%20of%20C%C3%B3rdoba">Hosius of Córdoba</a> was Bishop, the great champion of orthodoxy in the West. Together they set out for Sardica, <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>. A full Council of the Church was convened / summoned there in deference to the Roman pontiff's wishes. The travel was a mammoth task in itself. At this great gathering of prelates, leaders of the Church, the case of Athanasius was taken up once more, that is, Athanasius was formally questioned over misdemeanours and even murder, (a man called Arsenius and using his body for magic, – an absurd charge. They even produced Arsenius' severed hand.).

The Council was convoked for the purpose of inquiring into the charges against Athanasius and other bishops, on account of which they were deposed from their sees by the Semi-Arian Synod of Antioch (341), and went into exile. It was called according to Socrates, (E. H. ii. 20) by the two Emperors, Constans and Constantius; but, according to Baronius by Pope Julius (337–352), (Ad an. 343). One hundred and seventy six attended. Eusebian bishops objected to the admission of Athanasius and other deposed bishops to the Council, except as accused persons to answer the charges brought against them. Their objections were overridden by the orthodox bishops, about a hundred were orthodox, who were the majority. The Eusebians, seeing they had no chance of having their views carried, retired to Philoppopolis in Thrace, <a href="Philippopolis%20%28Thracia%29">Philippopolis (Thracia)</a>, where they held an opposition council, under the presidency of the Patriarch of Antioch, and confirmed the decrees of the Synod of Antioch.

His innocence was reaffirmed at the <a href="Council%20of%20Sardica">Council of Sardica</a>. Two conciliar letters were prepared, one to the clergy and faithful of Alexandria, the other to the bishops of Egypt and Libya, in which the will of the Council was made known. Meanwhile, the Eusebian party had gone to Philippopolis, where they issued an anathema against Athanasius and his supporters. The persecution against the orthodox party broke out with renewed vigour, and Constantius was induced to prepare drastic measures against Athanasius and the priests who were devoted to him. Orders were given that if the Saint attempt to re-enter his see, he should be put to death. Athanasius, accordingly, withdrew from <a href="Sardica">Sardica</a> to <a href="Naissus">Naissus</a> in Mysia, where he celebrated the Easter festival of the year 344. It was Hosius who presided over the <a href="Council%20of%20Sardica">Council of Sardica</a>, as he did for the <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">First Council of Nicaea</a>, which like the 341 synod, found Athanasius innocent. &. He celebrated his last Easter in exile in <a href="Aquileia">Aquileia</a> in April 345, received by bishop Fortunatianus.

Eastern Bishop <a href="Gregory%20of%20Cappadocia">Gregory of Cappadocia</a> died, probably of violence in June of 345. (Gregory, an Arian bishop, had taken over the See of Alexandria.) The emissary to the Emperor Constantius sent by the bishops of the Sardica Council to report the finding of the Council, who had been met at first with most insulting treatment, now received a favourable hearing. Constantius was forced to reconsider his decision, owing to a threatening letter from his brother Constans and the uncertain conditions of affairs on the Persian border, and he accordingly made up his mind to yield. But three separate letters were needed to overcome the natural hesitation of Athanasius. He passed rapidly from <a href="Aquileia">Aquileia</a> to <a href="Treves">Treves</a>, from Treves to Rome and from Rome by way of the northern route to Adrianople, <a href="Edirne">Edirne</a>, and Antioch, <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a>, where he met Constantius. He was accorded a gracious interview by the Emperor, and sent back to his See in triumph, and began his memorable ten years of peace, which lasted to the third exile, 356.

Pope Julius died in April 352, and was succeeded by <a href="Pope%20Liberius">Liberius</a>. For two years Liberius had been favourable to the cause of Athanasius; but driven at last into exile, he was induced to sign an ambiguous formula, from which the great Nicene text, the "homoousion", had been studiously omitted. In 355 a council was held at Milan, where in spite of the vigorous opposition of a handful of loyal prelates among the Western bishops, a fourth condemnation of Athanasius was announced to the world. With his friends scattered, the saintly Hosius in exile, and Pope Liberius denounced as acquiescing in Arian formularies, Athanasius could hardly hope to escape. On the night of 8 February 356, while engaged in services in the Church of St. Thomas, a band of armed men burst in to secure his arrest. It was the beginning of his third exile.

T. Gilmartin, (Professor of History, Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol. 1, Ch XVII: By Constantius' order, the sole ruler of The Roman Empire at the death of his brother Constans, the <a href="Council%20of%20Arles">Council of Arles</a> in 353, was held, which was presided over by Vincent, Bishop of <a href="Capua">Capua</a>, in the name of Pope Liberius. The fathers terrified of the threats of the Emperor, an avowed Arian, they consented to the condemnation of Athanasius. The Pope refused to accept their decision, and requested the Emperor to hold another Council, in which the charges against Athanasius could be freely investigated. To this Constantius consented, for he felt able to control the Council in Milan.

Three hundred bishops assembled in Milan, most from the West, only a few from the East, in 355. They met in the Church of Milan. Shortly, the Emperor ordered them to a hall in the Imperial Palace, thus ending any free debate. He presented an Arian formula of faith for their acceptance. He threatened any who refused with exile and death. All, with the exception of <a href="Dionysius%20%28bishop%20of%20Milan%29">Dionysius (bishop of Milan)</a>, and the two Papal Legates, viz., <a href="Eusebius%20of%20Vercelli">Eusebius of Vercelli</a> and <a href="Lucifer%20of%20Cagliari">Lucifer of Cagliari</a>, consented to the Arian Creed and the condemnation of Athanasius. Those who refused were sent into exile. The decrees were forwarded to the Pope for approval, but were rejected, because of the violence to which the bishops were subjected.

Through the influence of the Eusebian faction at Constantinople, an Arian bishop, <a href="George%20of%20Cappadocia">George of Cappadocia</a>, was now appointed to rule the see of Alexandria. Athanasius, after remaining some days in the neighbourhood of the city, finally withdrew into the desert of <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper Egypt</a>, where he remained for a period of six years, living the life of the monks, devoting himself to the composition of a group of writings; "Apology to Constantius", the "Apology for his Flight", the "Letter to the Monks", and the "History of the Arians".

Constantius, renewing his previous policies favoring the Arians, banished Athanasius from Alexandria once again. This was followed, in 356, by an attempt to arrest Athanasius during a vigil service. Athanasius fled to <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper Egypt</a>, where he stayed in several monasteries and other houses. During this period, Athanasius completed his work "Four Orations against the Arians" and defended his own recent conduct in the "Apology to Constantius" and "Apology for His Flight". Constantius' persistence in his opposition to Athanasius, combined with reports Athanasius received about the persecution of non-Arians by the new Arian bishop <a href="George%20of%20Laodicea">George of Laodicea</a>, prompted Athanasius to write his more emotional "History of the Arians", in which he described Constantius as a precursor of the <a href="Antichrist">Antichrist</a>.

Constantius ordered Liberius into exile in 356 giving him three days to comply. He was ordered into banishment to <a href="Stara%20Zagora">Beroea</a>, in Thrace. He sent expensive presents if he were to accept the Arian position, which Liberius refused. He sent him five hundred pieces of gold "to bear his charges" which Liberius refused, saying he might bestow them on his flatters; as he did also a like present from the empress, bidding the messenger learn to believe in Christ, and not to persecute the Church of God. Attempts were made to leave the presents in The Church, but Liberius threw them out. Constantius hereupon sent for him under a strict guard to Milan, where in a conference recorded by Theodore, he boldly told Constantius that Athanasius had been acquitted at Sardica, and his enemies proved calumniators (see: "calumny") and impostors, and that it was unjust to condemn a person who could not be legally convicted of any crime. The emperor was reduced to silence on every article, but being the more out of patience, ordered him into banishment.

Liberius went into exile. Constantius, after two years went to Rome to celebrate the twentieth year of his reign. The ladies joined in a petition to him that he would restore Liberius. He assented, upon condition that he should comply with the bishops, then, at court. He subscribed the condemnation of Athanasius, and a confession or creed which had been framed by the Arians at <a href="Sirmium">Sirmium</a>. And he no sooner had recovered his see that he declared himself for the <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Creed of Niceae</a>, as Theodoret testifies. (<a href="Theodoret">Theodoret</a>, Hist. lib. ii. c. 17.). The Emperor knew what he wanted people to believe. So did the bishops at his court. Athanasius stuck by the orthodox creed. Constantius was an avowed Arian, became sole ruler in 350, at the death of his brother, Constans.

T. Gilmartin, (Professor of History, Maynooth, 1890), writes in Church History, Vol. 1, Ch XVII:
The Arians sought the approval of an Ecumenical Council. They sought to hold two councils. Constantius, summoned the bishops of the East to meet at <a href="Seleucia%20in%20Isauria">Seleucia in Isauria</a>, and those of the West to <a href="Rimini">Rimini</a> in Italy. A preliminary conference was held by the Arians at <a href="Sirmium">Sirmium</a>, to agree a formula of faith. A "Homoeon" creed was adopted, declaring The Son to be "like the Father". The two met in autumn of 359. At Seleucia, one hundred and fifty bishops, of which one hundred and five were semi-Arian. The semi-Arians refused to accept anything less than the "Homoiousion", (see: <a href="Homoiousian">Homoiousian</a>), formulary of faith. The Imperial Prefect was obliged to disband, without agreeing on any creed.

Acacius, the leader of the "Homoean" party went to Constantinople, where the Sirmian formulary of faith was approved by the "Home Synod", (consisted of those bishops who happened to be present at the Court for the time), and a decree of deposition issued against the leaders of the semi-Arians. At Rimini were over four hundred of which eighty were Arian, the rest were orthodox. The orthodox fathers refused to accept any creed but the Nicene, while the others were equally in favour of the Sirmian. Each party sent a deputation to the Emperor to say there was no probability to agreement, and asked for the bishops to return to their dioceses. For the purpose of wearing-down the orthodox bishops; (Sulpitius Severius says), Constantius delayed his answer for several months, and finally prevailed on them to accept the Sirmian creed. It was after this Council that <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a> said: " ...the whole world groaned in astonishment to find itself Arian."

The Arians no longer presented an unbroken front to their orthodox opponents. The Emperor Constantius, who had been the cause of so much trouble, died on 4 November 361 and was succeeded by <a href="Julian%20%28emperor%29">Julian</a>. The proclamation of the new prince's accession was the signal for a pagan outbreak against the still dominant Arian faction in Alexandria. George, the usurping Bishop, was flung into prison and murdered. An obscure presbyter of the name of Pistus was immediately chosen by the Arians to succeed him, when fresh news arrived that filled the orthodox party with hope. An edict had been put forth by Julian permitting the exiled bishops of the "Galileans" to return to their "towns and provinces". Athanasius received a summons from his own flock, and he accordingly re-entered his episcopal capitol on 22 February 362.

In 362 he convened a council at Alexandria, and presided over it with <a href="Eusebius%20of%20Vercelli">Eusebius of Vercelli</a>. Athanasius appealed for unity among all those who had faith in Christianity, even if they differed on matters of terminology. This prepared the groundwork for his definition of the orthodox doctrine of the <a href="Trinity">Trinity</a>. However, the council also was directed against those who denied the divinity of the Holy Spirit, the human soul of Christ, and Christ's divinity. Mild measures were agreed on for those heretic bishops who repented, but severe penance was decreed for the chief leaders of the major heresies.

With characteristic energy he set to work to re-establish the somewhat shattered fortunes of the orthodox party and to purge the theological atmosphere of uncertainty. To clear up the misunderstandings that had arisen in the course of the previous years, an attempt was made to determine still further the significance of the Nicene formularies. In the meanwhile, Julian, who seems to have become suddenly jealous of the influence that Athanasius was exercising at Alexandria, addressed an order to Ecdicius, the Prefect of Egypt, peremptorily commanding the expulsion of the restored primate, on the ground that he had never been included in the imperial act of clemency. The edict was communicated to the bishop by Pythicodorus Trico, who, though described in the "Chronicon Athanasianum" (XXXV) as a "philosopher", seems to have behaved with brutal insolence. On 23 October the people gathered about the proscribed bishop to protest against the emperor's decree; but Athanasius urged them to submit, consoling them with the promise that his absence would be of short duration.

In 362, the new Emperor <a href="Julian%20%28emperor%29">Julian</a>, noted for his opposition to Christianity, ordered Athanasius to leave Alexandria once again. Athanasius left for <a href="Upper%20Egypt">Upper Egypt</a>, remaining there with the <a href="Desert%20Fathers">Desert Fathers</a> until Julian's death on 26 June 363. Athanasius returned in secret to Alexandria, where he soon received a document from the new emperor, <a href="Jovian%20%28emperor%29">Jovian</a>, reinstating him once more in his episcopal functions.

His first act was to convene a council which reaffirmed the terms of the <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Nicene Creed</a>. Early in September 363 he set out for <a href="Antioch%20on%20the%20Orontes">Antioch on the Orontes</a>, bearing a synodal letter, in which the pronouncements of this council had been embodied. At Antioch he had an interview with the new emperor, who received him graciously and even asked him to prepare an exposition of the orthodox faith. The following February Jovian died; and in October, 364, Athanasius was once more an exile.

Two years later, the Emperor <a href="Valens">Valens</a>, who favored the Arian position, in his turn exiled Athanasius. This time Athanasius simply left for the outskirts of Alexandria, where he stayed for only a few months before the local authorities convinced Valens to retract his order of exile. Some early reports state that Athanasius spent this period of exile at his family's ancestral tomb in a Christian cemetery. It was during this period, the final exile, that he is said to have spent four months in hiding in his father's tomb. (Soz., "Hist. Eccl.", VI, xii; Soc., "Hist. Eccl.", IV, xii).

The accession of Valens gave a fresh lease of life to the Arian party. He issued a decree banishing the bishops who had been deposed by Constantius, but who had been permitted by Jovian to return to their sees. The news created the greatest consternation in the city of Alexandria itself, and the prefect, in order to prevent a serious outbreak, gave public assurance that the very special case of Athanasius would be laid before the emperor. But Athanasius seems to have divined what was preparing in secret against him. He quietly withdrew from Alexandria, 5 October, and took up his abode in a country house outside the city. Valens, who seems to have sincerely dreaded the possible consequences of another popular outbreak, within a few weeks issued orders allowing Athanasius to return to his <a href="episcopal%20see">episcopal see</a>.

In 366 Pope Liberius died and was succeeded by Pope Damasus, a man of strong character and holy life. Two years later, in a council of the Church, it was decreed that no Bishop should be consecrated unless he held the <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Creed of Nicea</a>. (F. A. Forbes).

After returning to Alexandria in early 366, Athanasius spent his final years repairing all the damage done during the earlier years of violence, dissent, and exile. He resumed writing and preaching undisturbed, and characteristically re-emphasized the view of the <a href="Incarnation%20%28Christianity%29">Incarnation</a> which had been defined at <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">Nicaea</a>. On 2 May 373, having consecrated <a href="Pope%20Peter%20II%20of%20Alexandria">Peter II</a>, one of his presbyters as his successor, Athanasius died peacefully in his own bed, surrounded by his clergy and faithful supporters.

In <a href="Coptic%20literature">Coptic literature</a>, Athanasius is the first patriarch of Alexandria to use <a href="Coptic%20language">Coptic</a> as well as Greek in his writings.

Athanasius was not a speculative theologian. As he stated in his "First Letters to Serapion", he held on to "the tradition, teaching, and faith proclaimed by the apostles and guarded by the fathers." He held that not only was the Son of God <a href="consubstantiality">consubstantial</a> with the Father, but so was the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>, which had a great deal of influence in the development of later doctrines regarding the Trinity.

Athanasius' ""Letter Concerning the Decrees of the Council of Nicaea"" ("De Decretis"), is an important historical as well as theological account of the proceedings of that council, and another letter from 367 is the first known listing of all those books now accepted as the New Testament. (<a href="Development%20of%20the%20New%20Testament%20canon">Earlier similar lists</a> vary by the omission or addition of a few books.)

Examples of Athanasius' polemical writings against his theological opponents include "Orations Against the Arians", his defence of the divinity of the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a> ("Letters to Serapion" in the 360s, and "On the Holy Spirit"), against <a href="Macedonians%20%28religious%20group%29">Macedonianism</a> and On the Incarnation.

Athanasius also wrote a two-part "Against the Heathen" and "The Incarnation of the Word of God". Completed probably early in his life, before the Arian controversy, they constitute the first classic work of developed Orthodox theology. In the first part, Athanasius attacks several pagan practices and beliefs. The second part presents teachings on the redemption. Also in these books, Athanasius put forward the belief, referencing , that the <a href="Son%20of%20God">Son of God</a>, the eternal Word (<a href="Logos%20%28Christianity%29">Logos</a>) through whom God created the world, entered that world in human form to lead men back into the harmony from which they had earlier fallen away.

His other important works include his "Letters to Serapion", which defends the <a href="divinity">divinity</a> of the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>. In a letter to Epictetus of Corinth, Athanasius anticipates future controversies in his defense of the humanity of Christ. Another of his letters, to Dracontius, urges that monk to leave the desert for the more active duties of a bishop.

Athanasius also wrote several works of <a href="Biblical%20exegesis">Biblical exegesis</a>, primarily on <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> materials. The most important of these is his "Epistle to Marcellinus" (PG 27:12–45) on how to incorporate Psalm saying into one's spiritual practice. Excerpts remain of his discussions concerning the <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Book of Genesis</a>, the <a href="Song%20of%20Solomon">Song of Solomon</a>, and <a href="Psalms">Psalms</a>.

Perhaps his most notable letter was his Festal Letter, written to his Church in Alexandria when he was in exile, as he could not be in their presence. This letter clearly shows his stand that accepting Jesus as the Divine Son of God is not optional but necessary: 

His biography of <a href="Anthony%20the%20Great">Anthony the Great</a> entitled "Life of Antony"(Βίος καὶ Πολιτεία Πατρὸς Ἀντωνίου, "Vita Antonii") became his most widely read work. Translated into several languages, it became something of a best seller in its day and played an important role in the spreading of the <a href="ascetic">ascetic</a> ideal in Eastern and Western Christianity. It depicted Anthony as an illiterate yet holy man who continuously engaged in spiritual exercises in the Egyptian desert and struggled against demonic powers. It later served as an inspiration to Christian <a href="monasticism">monastics</a> in both the East and the West.

Athanasius' works on ascetism also include a "Discourse on Virginity", a short work on "Love and Self-Control", and a treatise "On Sickness and Health" (of which only fragments remain).

There are several other works ascribed to him, although not necessarily generally accepted as being his own. These include the so-called <a href="Athanasian%20creed">Athanasian creed</a> (which is today generally seen as being of 5th-century Galician origin), and a complete "Expositions on the Psalms" (PG 27: 60–545).

Athanasius was originally buried in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, but his remains were later transferred to the <a href="Chiesa%20di%20San%20Zaccaria">Chiesa di San Zaccaria</a> in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, Italy. During <a href="Pope%20Shenouda%20III%20of%20Alexandria">Pope Shenouda III</a>'s visit to Rome from 4 to 10 May 1973, <a href="Pope%20Paul%20VI">Pope Paul VI</a> gave the <a href="Copt">Copt</a>ic Patriarch a <a href="relic">relic</a> of Athanasius, which he brought back to Egypt on 15 May. The relic is currently preserved under the new <a href="Saint%20Mark%27s%20Coptic%20Orthodox%20Cathedral%2C%20Cairo">Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral</a> in <a href="Cairo%2C%20Egypt">Cairo, Egypt</a>. However, the majority of Athanasius's corpse remains in the Venetian church.

All major Christian denominations which officially recognize saints venerate Athanasius. Western Christians observe his <a href="feast%20day">feast day</a> on 2 May, the anniversary of his death. The <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> considers Athanasius a <a href="Doctor%20of%20the%20Church">Doctor of the Church</a>. For Coptic Christians, his feast day is <a href="Pashons%207">Pashons 7</a> (now circa 15 May). Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendars remember Athanasius on 18 January.

<a href="Gregory%20of%20Nazianzus">Gregory of Nazianzus</a> (330–390, also a Doctor of the Church), said: "When I praise Athanasius, virtue itself is my theme: for I name every virtue as often as I mention him who was possessed of all virtues. He was the true pillar of the Church. His life and conduct were the rule of bishops, and his doctrine the rule of the orthodox faith."

Historian Cornelius Clifford said in his account: "Athanasius was the greatest champion of Catholic belief on the subject of the Incarnation that the Church has ever known and in his lifetime earned the characteristic title of "Father of Orthodoxy", by which he has been distinguished ever since." 

Bl. John Henry Newman described him as a "principal instrument, after the Apostles, by which the sacred truths of Christianity have been conveyed and secured to the world". [Letters..]

Historian Cornelius Clifford says: "His career almost personifies a crisis in the history of Christianity; and he may be said rather to have shaped the events in which he took part than to have been shaped by them." 

The greater majority of Church leaders and the emperors fell into support for Arianism, so much so that <a href="Jerome">Jerome</a>, 340–420, wrote of the period: "The whole world groaned and was amazed to find itself Arian". He, Athanasius, even suffered an unjust excommunication from <a href="Pope%20Liberius">Pope Liberius</a> (325–366) who was exiled and leant towards the Arians, until he was allowed back to the See of Rome. Athanasius stood virtually alone against the world. (..see: "Third Exile", above.)

It was the custom of the bishops of Alexandria to circulate a letter after Epiphany each year establishing the date of Easter, and therefore other moveable feasts. They also took the occasion to discuss other matters. Athanasius wrote forty-five festal letters. Athanasius' "39th Festal Letter", written in 367, is widely regarded as a milestone in the evolution of the <a href="Biblical%20canon%23Christian%20canons">canon of New Testament books</a>.

Athanasius is the first person to identify the same 27 books of the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> that are in use today. Up until then, various similar lists of works to be read in churches were in use. Athanasius compiled the list to resolve questions about such texts as "The Epistle of Barnabas". Athanasius includes the <a href="Book%20of%20Baruch">Book of Baruch</a> and the <a href="Letter%20of%20Jeremiah">Letter of Jeremiah</a> and places the <a href="Book%20of%20Esther">Book of Esther</a> among the "7 books not in the canon but to be read" along with the <a href="Book%20of%20Wisdom">Wisdom of Solomon</a>, <a href="Ben%20Sira">Sirach (Ecclesiasticus)</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Judith">Judith</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Tobit">Tobit</a>, the <a href="Didache">Didache</a>, and <a href="the%20Shepherd%20of%20Hermas">the Shepherd of Hermas</a>.

Athanasius' list is similar to the Codex Vaticanus in the Vatican Library, probably written in Rome, in 340 by Alexandrian scribes for Emperor Constans, during the period of Athanasius' seven-year exile in the city. The establishment of the canon was not a unilateral decision by a bishop in Alexandria, but the result of a process of careful investigation and deliberation, as documented in a codex of the Greek Bible and, twenty-seven years later, in his festal letter.

<a href="Pope%20Damasus%20I">Pope Damasus I</a>, the <a href="Bishop">Bishop</a> of <a href="diocese%20of%20Rome">Rome</a> in 382, promulgated a list of books which contained a New Testament canon identical to that of Athanasius. A <a href="Synod%20of%20Hippo">synod in Hippo</a> in 393 repeated Athanasius' and Damasus' New Testament list (without the <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Hebrews">Epistle to the Hebrews</a>), and the <a href="Council%20of%20Carthage%20%28397%29">Council of Carthage (397)</a> repeated Athanasius' and Damasus' complete New Testament list.

Scholars debate whether Athanasius' list in 367 formed the basis for later lists. Because Athanasius' Canon is the closest canon of any of the Church Fathers to the one used by Protestant churches today, many Protestants point to Athanasius as the Father of the Canon.

In the light of Mother F. A. Forbes' research and reference to Pope Saint Gregory's writings, it would appear that Athanasius was constrained to be Bishop: She writes that when the Patriarch Alexander was on his death-bed he called Athanasius, who fled fearing he would be constrained to be made Bishop. "When the Bishops of the Church assembled to elect their new Patriarch, the whole Catholic population surrounded the church, holding up their hands to Heaven and crying; "Give us Athanasius!" The Bishops had nothing better. Athanasius was thus elected, as Gregory tells us..." (<a href="Pope%20Gregory%20I">Pope Gregory I</a>, would have full access to the Vatican Archives).

Alban Butler, writes on the subject: "Five months after this great Council, Nicae, St Alexander lying on his death-bed, recommended to his clergy and people the choice of Athanasius for his successor, thrice repeating his name. In consequence of his recommendation, the bishops of all Egypt assembled at Alexandria, and finding the people and clergy unanimous in their choice of Athanasius for patriarch, they confirmed the election about the middle of year 326. He seems, then, to have been about thirty years of age."

Christian denominations worldwide revere Athanasius as a saint, teacher, and father. They cite his defense of the Christology described in the first chapter of the Gospel of St. John and his significant theological works (<a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a> calls "On the Incarnation of the Word of God" a "masterpiece") as evidence of his righteousness. They also emphasize his close relationship with <a href="Anthony%20the%20Great">Anthony the Great</a>, the ancient monk who was one of the founders of the Christian monastic movement.

The Gospel of St. John and particularly the first chapter demonstrates the Divinity of Jesus. This Gospel in itself is the greatest support of Athanasius' stand. The Gospel of St. John's first chapter began to be said at the end of Mass, we believe as a result of Athanasius, and his life's stand, but quietly. The Last Gospel of The Mass, The Eucharist, St. John, together with the prayer; "Placeat tibi", the Blessing, are all private devotions that have been gradually absorbed by the liturgical service. The beginning of John's Gospel was much used as an object of special devotion throughout the Middle Ages. Nevertheless, the practice of saying it at the altar grew; eventually <a href="Pius%20V">Pius V</a> made this practice universal for the Roman Rite in his edition of the Missal (1570). It became a firm custom with exceptions in using an other Gospel in use from 1920. So the Missals showed different last Gospel for certain Feast days. A Prayer Card for the St. John's Gospel. Also:

<a href="Gregory%20of%20Nazianzus">Gregory of Nazianzus</a> (330–390) begins Or. 21 with: "When I praise Athanasius, virtue itself is my theme: for I name every virtue as often as I mention him who was possessed of all virtues. He was the true pillar of the church. His life and conduct were the rule of bishops, and his doctrine the rule of the orthodox faith."

<a href="Cyril%20of%20Alexandria">Cyril of Alexandria</a> (370–444) in the first letter says: "Athanasius is one who can be trusted: he would not say anything that is not in accord with sacred scripture." (Ep 1).

Many modern historians point out that such a hostile attitude towards Athanasius is based on an unfair judgment of historical sources.

Saint <a href="Pope%20Pius%20X">Pope Pius X</a> said in a letter to philosopher-friend and correspondent in the closing years of his life, (Epist. lxxi, ad Max.): "Let what was confessed by the fathers of <a href="First%20Council%20of%20Nicaea">Nicaea</a> prevail".

Throughout most of his career, Athanasius had many detractors. Classics scholar <a href="Timothy%20Barnes">Timothy Barnes</a> recounts ancient allegations against Athanasius: from defiling an altar, to selling Church grain that had been meant to feed the poor for his own personal gain, and even violence and murder to suppress dissent. Athanasius used "Arian" to describe both followers of Arius, and as a derogatory polemical term for Christians who disagreed with his formulation of the Trinity. Athanasius called many of his opponents "Arian", except for <a href="Meletius%20of%20Antioch">Meletius</a> (Miletus).

Scholars now believe that the <a href="Arianism">Arian Party</a> was not monolithic, but held drastically different theological views that spanned the early Christian theological spectrum. They supported the tenets of <a href="Origenism">Origenist</a> thought and <a href="subordinationism">subordinationist</a> theology, but had little else in common. Moreover, many labelled "Arian" did not consider themselves followers of Arius. In addition, non-Homoousian bishops disagreed with being labeled as followers of Arius, since Arius was merely a presbyter, while they were fully ordained bishops. However, others point to the Council of Nicaea as proof in and of itself that Arianism was a real theological ideology.

The old allegations continue to be made against Athanasius however many centuries later. For example, <a href="Richard%20E.%20Rubenstein">Richard E. Rubenstein</a> suggests that Athanasius ascended to the rank of bishop in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> under questionable circumstances because some questioned whether he had reached the minimum age of 30 years, and further that Athanasius employed force when it suited his cause or personal interests. Thus, he argues that a small number of bishops who supported Athanasius held a private consecration to make him bishop.

A detailed depiction of Athanasius as a villain is given in the 2016 novel, "The Secular Gospel of Sophia", by Daniel G. Helton.

Azores

The Azores ( or ; , ), officially the Autonomous Region of the Azores (""), is one of the two <a href="autonomous%20regions%20of%20Portugal">autonomous regions of Portugal</a>, an <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a> composed of nine <a href="High%20island">volcanic island</a>s in the North Atlantic Ocean about west of continental <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>, about west of <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, in <a href="continental%20Portugal">continental Portugal</a>, about from the African coast, and about southeast of <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>.

Its main industries are agriculture, <a href="dairy%20farming">dairy farming</a>, livestock, <a href="fishing%20in%20Portugal">fishing</a>, and <a href="tourism%20in%20Portugal">tourism</a>, which is becoming the major service activity in the region. In addition, the government of the Azores employs a large percentage of the population directly or indirectly in the service and tertiary sectors. The main settlement of the Azores is <a href="Ponta%20Delgada">Ponta Delgada</a>.

There are nine major Azorean islands and an islet cluster, in three main groups. These are <a href="Flores%20%28Azores%29">Flores</a> and <a href="Corvo%20Island">Corvo</a>, to the west; <a href="Graciosa">Graciosa</a>, <a href="Terceira">Terceira</a>, <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Jorge%20Island">São Jorge</a>, <a href="Pico%20Island">Pico</a>, and <a href="Faial%20Island">Faial</a> in the centre; and <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Miguel%20Island">São Miguel</a>, <a href="Santa%20Maria%20Island">Santa Maria</a>, and the <a href="Formigas">Formigas Reef</a> to the east. They extend for more than and lie in a northwest-southeast direction.

All the islands have <a href="volcanic">volcanic</a> origins, although some, such as <a href="Santa%20Maria%20Island">Santa Maria</a>, have had no recorded activity since the islands were settled. <a href="Mount%20Pico">Mount Pico</a>, on the island of <a href="Pico%20Island">Pico</a>, is the highest point in Portugal, at . If measured from their base at the bottom of the ocean to their peaks, which thrust high above the surface of the Atlantic, the Azores are actually some of the tallest mountains on the planet.

The climate of the Azores is very mild for such a northerly location, being influenced by its distance from the continents and by the passing <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a>. Due to the marine influence, temperatures remain mild year-round. Daytime temperatures normally fluctuate between and depending on season. Temperatures above or below are unknown in the major population centres. It is also generally wet and cloudy.

The culture, dialect, cuisine, and traditions of the Azorean islands vary considerably, because these once-uninhabited and remote islands were settled sporadically over a span of two centuries.

A small number of alleged <a href="Hypogeum">hypogea</a>, earthen structures carved into rocks that were used for burials, have been identified on the islands of Corvo, Santa Maria and Terceira by Portuguese archaeologist Nuno Ribeiro, who speculated that they might date back 2000 years, alluding to a human presence on the island before the Portuguese. However, these kinds of structures have been used in the Azores to store cereals, and suggestions by Ribeiro that they might be burial sites are unconfirmed. Detailed examination and dating to authenticate the validity of these speculations is lacking. It is unclear whether these structures are natural or man-made and whether they predate the 15th-century Portuguese colonization of the Azores. Solid confirmation of a pre-Portuguese human presence in the archipelago has not yet been published.

The islands were known in the fourteenth century and parts of them appear in the <a href="Atlas%20Catalan">Atlas Catalan</a>. In 1427, a captain sailing for <a href="Henry%20the%20Navigator">Henry the Navigator</a>, possibly <a href="Gon%C3%A7alo%20Velho">Gonçalo Velho</a>, rediscovered the Azores, but this is not certain. In <a href="Thomas%20Ashe%20%28writer%29">Thomas Ashe</a>'s 1813 work, "A History of the Azores", the author identified a <a href="Flemish%20people">Fleming</a>, Joshua Vander Berg of <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a>, who made landfall in the archipelago during a storm on his way to <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>. He stated that the Portuguese explored the area and claimed it for Portugal. Other stories note the discovery of the first islands (<a href="S%C3%A3o%20Miguel%20Island">São Miguel Island</a>, <a href="Santa%20Maria%20Island">Santa Maria Island</a> and <a href="Terceira%20Island">Terceira Island</a>) by sailors in the service of <a href="Henry%20the%20Navigator">Henry the Navigator</a>, although there are few documents to support the claims.

Although it is commonly said that the archipelago received its name from the <a href="northern%20goshawk">goshawk</a> ( in Portuguese), a common bird at the time of discovery, it is unlikely that the bird nested or hunted in the islands.

There were no large animals on Santa Maria, so after its discovery and before settlement began, sheep were let loose on the island to supply future settlers with food. Settlement did not take place right away, however. There was not much interest among the Portuguese people in an isolated archipelago so far from civilization. However, <a href="Gon%C3%A7alo%20Velho%20Cabral">Gonçalo Velho Cabral</a> patiently gathered resources and settlers for the next three years (1433–1436) and sailed to establish colonies first on Santa Maria and then on São Miguel.

Settlers cleared bush and rocks to plant crops—grain, grape vines, <a href="sugar%20cane">sugar cane</a>, and other plants suitable for local use and of commercial value. They brought domesticated animals, such as chickens, rabbits, cattle, sheep, goats, and <a href="Domestic%20pig">pigs</a> and built houses and established villages.

The archipelago was largely settled from mainland Portugal. Portuguese settlers came from the provinces of <a href="Algarve">Algarve</a>, <a href="Minho%20Province">Minho</a>, <a href="Alentejo%20Province">Alentejo</a> and <a href="Ribatejo%20Province">Ribatejo</a> as well as <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>. São Miguel was first settled in 1444, the settlers – mainly from the <a href="Estremadura%20Province%20%28historical%29">Estremadura</a>, Alto Alentejo and Algarve areas of mainland Portugal, under the command of Gonçalo Velho Cabral – landed at the site of modern-day <a href="Povoa%C3%A7%C3%A3o">Povoação</a>. Many early settlers were Portuguese Sephardic Jews (New Christians - Jews who became Christian through forced conversion) who fled the pressures of inquisition in mainland Portugal. In 1522 <a href="Vila%20Franca%20do%20Campo">Vila Franca do Campo</a>, then the capital of the island, was devastated by an <a href="1522%20Vila%20Franca%20earthquake">earthquake and landslide</a> that killed about 5,000 people, and the capital was moved to <a href="Ponta%20Delgada">Ponta Delgada</a>. The town of Vila Franca do Campo was rebuilt on the original site and today is a thriving fishing and yachting port. Ponta Delgada received its city status in 1546. From the first settlement, the pioneers applied themselves to agriculture and by the 15th century Graciosa exported wheat, barley, wine and brandy. The goods were sent to Terceira largely because of the proximity of the island.

During the 18th and 19th century, Graciosa was host to many prominent figures, including <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Ren%C3%A9%20de%20Chateaubriand">Chateaubriand</a>, the French writer who passed through upon his escape to America during the French revolution; <a href="Almeida%20Garrett">Almeida Garrett</a>, the Portuguese poet who visited an uncle and wrote some poetry while there; and <a href="Albert%20I%2C%20Prince%20of%20Monaco">Prince Albert of Monaco</a>, the 19th century oceanographer who led several expeditions in the waters of the Azores. He arrived on his yacht "Hirondelle", and visited the "furna da caldeira", the noted hot springs grotto. In 1869, the author <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a> published "<a href="The%20Innocents%20Abroad">The Innocents Abroad</a>", a travel book, where he described his time in the Azores.

The first reference to the island of São Jorge was made in 1439 but the actual date of discovery is unknown. In 1443 the island was already inhabited but active settlement only began with the arrival of the noble Flemish native "Wilhelm Van der Haegen". Arriving at <a href="Topo%20%28Azores%29">Topo</a>, where he lived and died, he became known as "Guilherme da Silveira" to the islanders. <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Vaz%20Corte-Real">João Vaz Corte-Real</a> received the captaincy of the island in 1483. <a href="Velas">Velas</a> became a town before the end of the 15th century. By 1490, there were 2,000 Flemings living in the islands of Terceira, Pico, Faial, São Jorge and Flores. Because there was such a large Flemish settlement, the Azores became known as the Flemish Islands or the Isles of Flanders. Prince <a href="Henry%20the%20Navigator">Henry the Navigator</a> was responsible for this settlement. His sister, <a href="Infanta%20Isabel%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Burgundy">Isabel</a>, was married to <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Duke Philip of Burgundy</a> of which Flanders was a part. There was a revolt against Philip's rule and disease and hunger became rampant. Isabel appealed to Henry to allow some of the unruly Flemings to settle in the Azores. He granted this and supplied them with the necessary transportation and goods.

The <a href="Human%20settlement">settlement</a> of the then-unoccupied islands started in 1439 with people mainly from the continental provinces of Algarve and <a href="Alentejo">Alentejo</a>. In 1583, <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Spain">Philip II of Spain</a>, as <a href="List%20of%20Portuguese%20monarchs">king of Portugal</a>, sent his fleet to clear the Azores of a combined multinational force of adventurers, mercenaries, volunteers and soldiers who were attempting to establish the Azores as a staging post for a rival <a href="pretender">pretender</a> to the Portuguese throne. Following the success of his fleet at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ponta%20Delgada">Battle of Ponta Delgada</a>, the captured enemies were hanged from yardarms, as they were considered pirates by Philip II. This was added to the "<a href="Black%20Legend">Black Legend</a>" by his enemies. An English <a href="Azores%20Voyage%20of%201589">expedition to the Azores</a> in 1589 was met with success as a few of the islands along with the harbouring ships were plundered. Another English expedition against the Azores in 1597, the <a href="Islands%20Voyage">Islands Voyage</a>, however failed. Spain held the Azores in what is called The Babylonian captivity of 1580–1642. Into the late 16th century, the Azores as well as <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a> began to face problems of overpopulation. Spawning from that particular economic problem, some of the people began to emigrate to <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>.

Following the death of <a href="Henry%2C%20King%20of%20Portugal">Henry, the Cardinal-King of Portugal</a> the nation fell into a dynastic crisis with <a href="Portuguese%20succession%20crisis%20of%201580%23Claimants%20to%20the%20throne">various pretenders</a> to the Crown of Portugal. Following his proclamation in Santarém, <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%2C%20Prior%20of%20Crato">António, Prior of Crato</a> was acclaimed in the Azores in 1580 (through his envoy António da Costa), but was expelled from the continent following the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alc%C3%A2ntara%20%281580%29">Battle of Alcântara</a>. Yet, through the administration of Cipriano de Figueiredo, governor of Terceira (who continued to govern Terceira in the name of ill-fated, former-king <a href="Sebastian%20of%20Portugal">Sebastian of Portugal</a>), the Azoreans resisted attempts to conquer the islands (including specifically at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Salga">Battle of Salga</a>). It was Figueiredo and Violante do Canto who helped organize a resistance on Terceira that influenced some of the response of the other islands, even as internal politics and support for Philip's faction increased on the other islands (including specifically on São Miguel, where the Gonçalvez da Câmara family supported the Spanish pretender).

The Azores were the last part of the <a href="Portuguese%20Empire">Portuguese Empire</a> to resist Philip's reign over Portugal (<a href="Macau">Macau</a> resisted any official recognition) and were returned to Portuguese control with the end of the <a href="Iberian%20Union">Iberian Union</a> in 1640, not by the professional military, who were used in the <a href="Portuguese%20Restoration%20War">Restoration War</a> in the mainland, but by local people attacking a fortified <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Castilian</a> garrison.

The <a href="Liberal%20Wars">Portuguese Civil War</a> (1828–1834) had strong repercussions in the Azores. In 1829, in <a href="Praia%20da%20Vitoria">Praia da Vitória</a>, the Liberals won over the <a href="Political%20absolutism">absolutists</a>, making <a href="Terceira%20Island">Terceira Island</a> the main headquarters of the new Portuguese regime and also where the Council of Regency () of <a href="Maria%20II%20of%20Portugal">Maria II of Portugal</a> was established.

Beginning in 1868, Portugal issued its stamps overprinted with "" for use in the islands. Between 1892 and 1906, it also issued separate stamps for the three administrative districts of the time.

From 1836 to 1976, the archipelago was divided into three districts, equivalent (except in area) to those in the <a href="Administrative%20divisions%20of%20Portugal%23Districts">Portuguese mainland</a>. The division was arbitrary, and did not follow the natural island groups, rather reflecting the location of each district capital on the three main cities (none of which were on the western group).


In 1931 the Azores (together with Madeira and Portuguese Guinea) revolted against the <a href="Ditadura%20Nacional">Ditadura Nacional</a> and were held briefly by military rebels.

In 1943, during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the Portuguese ruler <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%20de%20Oliveira%20Salazar">António de Oliveira Salazar</a> leased air and naval bases in the Azores to the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. The occupation of these facilities in October 1943 was codenamed "<a href="Operation%20Alacrity">Operation Alacrity</a>" by the British.

This was a key turning point in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a>, enabling the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, the <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Air%20Forces">U.S. Army Air Forces</a>, and the U.S. Navy to provide aerial coverage in the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20gap">Mid-Atlantic gap</a>. This helped them to protect <a href="convoy">convoy</a>s and to hunt hostile <a href="Kriegsmarine">Kriegsmarine</a> <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s.

In 1944, the <a href="American%20armed%20forces">American armed forces</a> constructed a small and short-lived <a href="air%20base">air base</a> on the island of Santa Maria. In 1945, a new base was constructed on the island of <a href="Terceira">Terceira</a>, and it is named <a href="Lajes%20Field">Lajes Field</a>. This air base is in an area called Lajes, a broad, flat sea terrace that had been a large farm. Lajes Field is a plateau rising out of the sea on the northeast corner of the island. This air base is a joint American and Portuguese venture. Lajes Field continues to support the American and <a href="Portuguese%20Armed%20Forces">Portuguese Armed Forces</a>. During the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, <a href="U.S.%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> <a href="P-3%20Orion">P-3 Orion</a> <a href="antisubmarine%20warfare">antisubmarine warfare</a> squadrons patrolled the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Ocean">North Atlantic Ocean</a> for <a href="Soviet%20Navy">Soviet Navy</a> <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s and surface <a href="warship">warship</a>s. Since its opening, Lajes Field has been used for refuelling American <a href="cargo%20plane">cargo plane</a>s bound for <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, and the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. The U.S. Navy keeps a small <a href="squadron%20%28naval%29">squadron</a> of its ships at the harbor of <a href="Praia%20da%20Vit%C3%B3ria">Praia da Vitória</a>, southeast of Lajes Field.

The airfield also has a small commercial terminal handling scheduled and chartered passenger flights from the other islands in the Azores, Europe, Africa, and <a href="North%20America">North America</a>.

In 1976, the Azores became the Autonomous Region of the Azores (), one of the <a href="autonomous%20regions%20of%20Portugal">autonomous regions of Portugal</a>, and the subdistricts of the Azores were eliminated.

The <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a> of the Azores is located in the middle of the northern hemisphere of the Atlantic Ocean and extends along a west-northwest to east-southeast orientation (between 36.5°–40° North <a href="latitudes">latitudes</a> and 24.5°–31.5° West <a href="longitudes">longitudes</a>) in an area approximately wide. The islands of the Azores emerged from what is called the Azores Platform, a 5.8 million km region that is morphologically accented by a depth of .

From a geostructural perspective the Azores is located above an active <a href="triple%20junction">triple junction</a> between three of the world's large tectonic plates (the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American Plate</a>, the <a href="Eurasian%20Plate">Eurasian Plate</a> and the <a href="African%20Plate">African Plate</a>), a condition that has translated into the existence of many faults and fractures in this region of the Atlantic. The westernmost islands of the archipelago (<a href="Corvo%20Island">Corvo</a> and <a href="Flores%20Island%20%28Azores%29">Flores</a>) are located in the North American Plate, while the remaining islands are located within the boundary that divides the Eurasian and African Plates.
The principal tectonic structures that exist in the region of the Azores are the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20Ridge">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a>, the <a href="Terceira%20Rift">Terceira Rift</a>, the Azores Fracture Zone and the Glória Fault. The <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20Ridge">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a> is the main frontier between the American Plate and the African-Eurasian Plates that crosses the Azores Platform between the islands of <a href="Flores%20Island%20%28Azores%29">Flores</a> and <a href="Faial%20Island">Faial</a> from north to south then to the southwest; it is an extensive form crossed by many transform faults running perpendicular to its north-south orientation, that is seismically active and susceptible to volcanism. The Terceira Rift is a system of fractures that extends from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the Glória Fault that represents the main frontier between the Eurasian and African Plates. It is defined by a line of submarine volcanoes and island mounts that extend northwest to southeast for about , from the area west of <a href="Graciosa">Graciosa</a> until the islets of the <a href="Formigas">Formigas</a>, that includes the islands of Graciosa, Terceira and São Miguel. Its northwest limit connects to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, while the southeast section intersects the Gloria Fault southeast of the island of <a href="Santa%20Maria%20Island">Santa Maria</a>. The Azores Fracture Zone extends from the Glória Fault and encompasses a relatively inactive area to the south of the islands of the Central and Eastern groups north to the Terceira Rift, along a 45° angle. The Glória Fault, for its part, extends along a linear line from the Azores to the <a href="Azores%E2%80%93Gibraltar%20Transform%20Fault">Azores–Gibraltar Transform Fault</a>.

The island's volcanism is associated with the rifting along the <a href="Azores%20Triple%20Junction">Azores Triple Junction</a>; the spread of the crust along the existing faults and fractures has produced many of the active volcanic and seismic events, while supported by buoyant upwelling in the deeper mantle, some associate with an <a href="Azores%20hotspot">Azores hotspot</a>. Most of the volcanic activity has centered, primarily, along the <a href="Terceira%20Rift">Terceira Rift</a>. From the beginning of the island's settlement, around the 15th century, there have been 28 registered volcanic eruptions (15 terrestrial and 13 submarine). The last significant volcanic eruption, the <a href="Capelinhos">Capelinhos</a> volcano (), occurred off the coast of the island of Faial in 1957; the most recent volcanic activity occurred in the seamounts and submarine volcanoes off the coast of <a href="Serreta%20%28Azores%29">Serreta</a> and in the Pico-São Jorge Channel. The islands have many examples of volcano-built geomorphology including many of the caves and subterranean lava tubes (such as the <a href="Gruta%20das%20Torres">Gruta das Torres</a>, <a href="Algar%20do%20Carv%C3%A3o">Algar do Carvão</a>, <a href="Gruta%20do%20Natal">Gruta do Natal</a>, Gruta das Cinco Ribeiras), the coastal lava fields (like the coast of <a href="Feteiras">Feteiras</a>, <a href="Faial%20Island">Faial</a>, the Mistério of <a href="Prainha%20%28S%C3%A3o%20Roque%20do%20Pico%29">Prainha</a> or São João on <a href="Pico%20Island">Pico Island</a>) in addition to the currently inactive cones in central <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Miguel%20Island">São Miguel Island</a>, the aforementioned Capelinhos on Faial, the volcanic complexes of <a href="Terceira">Terceira</a> or <a href="Plinian">Plinian</a> caldeira of <a href="Corvo%20Island">Corvo Island</a>.

The islands of the archipelago were formed through volcanic and seismic activity during the <a href="Neogene">Neogene</a> Period; the first embryonic surfaces started to appear in the waters of Santa Maria during the <a href="Miocene%20epoch">Miocene epoch</a> (from circa 8 million years ago). The sequence of the island formation has been generally characterized as: Santa Maria (8.12 Ma), São Miguel (4.1 Ma), Terceira (3.52 Ma), Graciosa (2.5 Ma), Flores (2.16 Ma), Faial (0.7 Ma), São Jorge (0.55 Ma), Corvo (0.7 Ma) and the youngest, Pico (0.27 Ma). Although all islands have experienced volcanism during their geological history, within recorded "human settlement" history the islands of Santa Maria, Graciosa, Flores, and Corvo have not experienced any volcanic eruptions; in addition to active fumaroles and hot-springs, the remaining islands have had sporadic eruptions since the 14th century. Apart from the <a href="Capelinhos">Capelinhos</a> volcano in 1957–58, the last recorded instance of "island formation" occurred off the coast of São Miguel, when the island of <a href="Sabrina%20Island%20%28Azores%29">Sabrina</a> was briefly formed.

Owing to its geodynamic environment, the region has been center of intense seismic activity, particularly along its tectonic boundaries on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Terceira Rift. Seismic events although frequent, usually tectonic or vulco-tectonic in nature, but in general low to medium intensities, occasionally punctuated by events of level 5 or greater on the <a href="Richter%20magnitude%20scale">Richter magnitude scale</a>. The most severe earthquake was registered in 1757, near <a href="Calheta%20%28Azores%29">Calheta</a> on the island of <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Jorge%20Island">São Jorge</a>, which exceeded 7 on the Richter magnitude scale. In comparison, the 1522 earthquake that was mentioned by historian <a href="Gaspar%20Frutuoso">Gaspar Frutuoso</a> measured 6.8, but its effects were judged to be X ("Extreme") on the <a href="Mercalli%20intensity%20scale">Mercalli intensity scale</a>, and was responsible for the destruction of <a href="Vila%20Franca%20do%20Campo">Vila Franca do Campo</a> and landslides that may have killed less than 5,000 of the inhabitants.
The nine islands that compose the archipelago occupy a surface area of , that includes both the main islands and many islets located in their vicinities. Each of the islands have their own distinct geomorphological characteristics that make them unique: <a href="Corvo%20Island">Corvo</a> (the smallest island) is a crater of a major <a href="Plinian">Plinian</a> eruption; <a href="Flores%20Island%20%28Azores%29">Flores</a> (its neighbor on the <a href="North%20American%20Plate">North American Plate</a>) is a rugged island carved by many valleys and escarpments; <a href="Faial%20Island">Faial</a> characterized for its <a href="volcano%23Shield%20volcanoes">shield volcano</a> and caldera (<a href="Cabe%C3%A7o%20Gordo">Cabeço Gordo</a>); <a href="Pico%20Island">Pico</a>, is the highest point, at , in the Azores and continental Portugal; <a href="Graciosa%20Island">Graciosa</a> is known for its active Furnas do Enxofre and mixture of volcanic cones and plains; <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Jorge%20Island">São Jorge</a> is a long slender island, formed from <a href="Types%20of%20volcanic%20eruptions">fissural eruptions</a> over thousands of years; <a href="Terceira">Terceira</a>, almost circular, is the location of one of the largest craters in the region; <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Miguel%20Island">São Miguel</a> is the largest island, and is pitted with many large craters and fields of spatter cones; and <a href="Santa%20Maria%20Island">Santa Maria</a>, the oldest island, is heavily eroded, being one of the few places to encounter brown sandy beaches in the archipelago. They range in surface area from the largest, São Miguel, at to the smallest, Corvo, at approximately .

These islands can be divided into three recognizable groups located on the Azores Platform:
In addition, several sub-surface reefs (particularly the <a href="Dollabarat">Dollabarat</a> on the fringe of the Formigas), banks (specifically the <a href="Princess%20Alice%20Bank">Princess Alice Bank</a> and <a href="Dom%20Jo%C3%A3o%20de%20Castro%20Bank">D. João de Castro Bank</a>, as well as many <a href="Hydrothermal%20vents%20and%20seamounts%20of%20the%20Azores">hydrothermal vents and sea-mounts</a> are monitored by the regional authorities, owing to the complex geotectonic and socioeconomic significance within the economic exclusion zone of the archipelago.
The archipelago lies in the <a href="Palearctic%20ecozone">Palearctic ecozone</a>, forming a unique <a href="biome">biome</a> that includes the <a href="macaronesian">macaronesian</a> <a href="subtropical">subtropical</a> <a href="laurissilva">laurissilva</a>, with many <a href="endemic%20species">endemic species</a> of plants and animals. In total, there are at least, 6112 terrestrial species, of which about 411 are <a href="endemic">endemic</a>. The majority (75%) of these endemics are animals, mostly <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s and <a href="mollusk">mollusk</a>s. New species are found regularly in the Azores (e.g., 30 different new species of land snails were discovered circa 2013 ).

Even though the Azores look very green and sometimes wild, the vegetation has been extremely altered. A great part of it has been wiped out in the past 600 years for its valuable wood (for tools, buildings, boats, <a href="Wood%20fuel">fire wood</a>, and so on) and to clear land for <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>. As a result, it is estimated that more than half of <a href="insect">insect</a>s on the Graciosa island have disappeared or will become extinct. Many cultivated places (which are traditionally dedicated to pasture or to growing <a href="colocasia">colocasia</a>, <a href="potato">potato</a>es, <a href="maize">maize</a> and other crops) have now been abandoned, especially as a result of emigration. Consequently, some <a href="Invasive%20species">invasive</a> plants have filled these deserted and disturbed lands. <a href="Hydrangea">Hydrangea</a>s are another potential pest, but their threat is less serious. Notwithstanding the fact that hydrangeas were introduced from <a href="America">America</a> or <a href="Asia">Asia</a>, some locals consider them a symbol of the archipelago and propagate them along roadsides, helping the plants to escape into the wild. "<a href="Cryptomeria">Cryptomeria</a>", the Japanese cedar, is a <a href="conifer">conifer</a> extensively grown for its timber. The two most common of these alien species are "<a href="Pittosporum%20undulatum">Pittosporum undulatum</a>" and "<a href="Acacia%20melanoxylon">Acacia melanoxylon</a>". They are usually restricted to ancient agricultural land and only rarely penetrate into undisturbed native vegetation.

Reforestation efforts with native laurissilva vegetation have been done successfully in many parts of the Azores.

The Azores has two <a href="endemism">endemic</a> bird species. The <a href="Azores%20bullfinch">Azores bullfinch</a>, or "Priolo", is restricted to remnant laurisilva forest in the mountains at the eastern end of São Miguel and is classified by BirdLife International as <a href="endangered">endangered</a>. <a href="Monteiro%27s%20storm-petrel">Monteiro's storm-petrel</a>, described to science as recently as 2008, is known to breed in just two locations in the islands, but may occur more widely. An <a href="extinct">extinct</a> species of <a href="owl">owl</a>, the <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Miguel%20scops%20owl">São Miguel scops owl</a>, has also recently been described, which probably became extinct after human settlement due to habitat destruction and the introduction of alien species. The Azores also has an endemic <a href="bat">bat</a>, the <a href="Azores%20noctule">Azores noctule</a>, which is unusual in regularly feeding during the day.

The islets of the <a href="Formigas">Formigas</a> (the Portuguese word for "<a href="ant">ant</a>s"), including the area known as the <a href="Dollabarat">Dollabarat</a> Reef, have a rich environment of maritime species, such as <a href="black%20coral">black coral</a> and <a href="manta%20ray">manta ray</a>s, different species of <a href="shark">shark</a>s, <a href="whale">whale</a>s, and <a href="sea%20turtle">sea turtle</a>s. On São Miguel there are notable micro-habitats formed by hot springs that host <a href="extremophile">extremophile</a> microorganisms.

17 new marine reserves (with special conservation status) were added to the Azorean Marine Park (which covers currently around 900.000 km2)

The <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a> is spread out in the area between 37° N and the <a href="Circle%20of%20latitude">parallels of latitude</a> that pass through the <a href="Lisbon%23Climate">Lisbon</a> area (38° 43' / 38° 55' N), giving it generally a tepid, oceanic, subtropical climate, with mild annual oscillations. Daily maximum temperatures usually range between . The average annual rainfall increases from east to west, and it ranges from 700 to 1600 annual millimetres (27.6–63 in) on average, reaching on <a href="Mount%20Pico">Mount Pico</a>, the highest Portuguese mountain at . The <a href="Azores%20High">Azores High</a>, an area of high <a href="atmospheric%20pressure">atmospheric pressure</a>, is named after the islands. Under the Köppen climate classification, there are different local climates, one of it is "dry-summer subtropical", often referred to as "Mediterranean". Rivas Martinez data, presents several different bioclimatic zones for the Azores <a href="Seasonal%20lag">Seasonal lag</a> is extreme in the low-sun half of the year, with December being milder than April in terms of mean temperatures.
Azores have the warmest winters in Europe (still within the European continental plate). During summer the lag is somewhat lower, with August being the warmest month. There has never been a frost, snowfall or freeze ever recorded at sea level on any of the islands. The coldest weather in winter usually occurs in a north westerly airmass with its origins from <a href="Labrador">Labrador</a> in Canada, but even then due to its passage across the warmer Atlantic Ocean still allows temperatures by day even then to exceed 10C.

In addition, the <a href="Instituto%20de%20Meteorologia">Instituto de Meteorologia</a> has identified the following weather extremes:

The Azores are known for small hurricanes. A total of 14 <a href="Tropical%20cyclone">tropical</a> or <a href="subtropical%20cyclone">subtropical cyclone</a>s have affected the region in history. Most of them were either <a href="Extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical</a> or <a href="Tropical%20cyclone">tropical storms</a> when they impacted the region, although several <a href="Saffir-Simpson%20hurricane%20scale">Category 1 hurricanes</a> have reached the Azores. The following storms have impacted the region while at Category 1 strength: <a href="Hurricane%20Fran%20%281973%29">Hurricane Fran</a> in 1973, <a href="Hurricane%20Emmy">Hurricane Emmy</a> in 1976, <a href="Hurricane%20Gordon%20%282006%29">Hurricane Gordon</a> in 2006, <a href="Hurricane%20Gordon%20%282012%29">Hurricane Gordon</a> in 2012 and <a href="Hurricane%20Alex%20%282016%29">Hurricane Alex</a> in 2016. Several tropical storms have hit the region, including <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Irma%20%281978%29">Tropical Storm Irma</a> in 1978, <a href="Hurricane%20Bonnie%20%281992%29">Hurricane Bonnie</a> in 1992, <a href="1992%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season%23Hurricane%20Charley">Hurricane Charley</a> in 1992, <a href="Hurricane%20Erika%20%281997%29">Hurricane Erika</a> in 1997, and <a href="2016%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season%23Hurricane%20Gaston">Hurricane Gaston</a> in 2016. Storms that were extratropical when they impacted the region include <a href="Hurricane%20Tanya%20%281995%29">Hurricane Tanya</a> in 1995, <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Ana%20%282003%29">Tropical Storm Ana</a> in 2003 and <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Grace%20%282009%29">Tropical Storm Grace</a> in 2009. In addition, the <a href="2005%20Azores%20subtropical%20storm">2005 Azores subtropical storm</a> impacted the region in October 2005.

The Azores are divided into 19 municipalities (); each municipality is further divided into parishes (), of which there is a <a href="List%20of%20parishes%20of%20Portugal">total of 156</a> in all of the Azores. The municipalities, by island, are:
There are six cities (Portuguese: "cidades") in the Azores: <a href="Ponta%20Delgada">Ponta Delgada</a>, <a href="Lagoa%20%28Azores%29">Lagoa</a> and <a href="Ribeira%20Grande%2C%20S%C3%A3o%20Miguel">Ribeira Grande</a> on the island of São Miguel; <a href="Angra%20do%20Hero%C3%ADsmo">Angra do Heroísmo</a> and <a href="Praia%20da%20Vit%C3%B3ria">Praia da Vitória</a> on the island of Terceira, and <a href="Horta%20%28Azores%29">Horta</a> on Faial. Three of these, <a href="Ponta%20Delgada">Ponta Delgada</a>, <a href="Angra%20%28Azores%29">Angra</a> and <a href="Horta%20%28Azores%29">Horta</a> are considered <a href="Capital%20%28political%29">capital/administrative cities</a> to the regional government: homes to the President (Ponta Delgada), the Judiciary (Angra) and the Regional Assembly (Horta). Angra also serves as the ecclesiastical centre of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Angra">Roman Catholic Diocese of Angra</a>, the episcopal see of the Azores.

According to the 2011 Census, population in the Azores was 246,746 at a density of .

The Azores were uninhabited when Portuguese navigators arrived in the early 15th century; the settlement process was initiated in 1439 with individuals from various regions of mainland Portugal and from <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>. The islands were populated mainly by Portuguese descendants immigrants from <a href="Algarve">Algarve</a>, <a href="Alentejo">Alentejo</a>, and <a href="Minho%20%28province%29">Minho</a>; however, in an effort to escape the pressures of the Portuguese inquisition, many Portuguese Sephardic Jews, also known as the 'New Christians', (those who were forced to convert to Christianity during the Portuguese inquisition), settled on the islands in large numbers. Azorean Jews had surnames such as: Rodrigues, Oliveira, Pereira, Pimentel, Cardozo, Teixeira, etc. The islands were also settled by Moorish prisoners, and African slaves from Guinea, Cape Verde and São Tomé; Flemish, French and Galicians also contributed to the initial settlement. Thus the Azorean population received a significant contribution from people with genetic backgrounds other than Portuguese.

The nature of the economy dictated that <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">African slavery</a> never became common in the Azores because they were sent to Brazil and the Caribbean. Only a few remained in the Azores to help with domestic chores, although the islands sometimes served as a waypoint for ships carrying <a href="History%20of%20slavery">African slaves</a>.

Blacks, Moors, Jews, Scots, Germans, Italians, French, Spanish, Flemish and Portuguese all migrated to the Azores.

As in <a href="continental%20Portugal">continental Portugal</a>, the most frequent <a href="Human%20mitochondrial%20DNA%20haplogroup">mtDNA haplogroup</a> in the Azores is <a href="Haplogroup%20H%20%28mtDNA%29">H</a> (45.2%), followed by <a href="Haplogroup%20U%20%28mtDNA%29">U</a> (16.7%), <a href="Haplogroup%20T%20%28mtDNA%29">T</a> (10.1%), <a href="Haplogroup%20K%20%28mtDNA%29">K</a> (6.5%), <a href="Haplogroup%20pre-HV%20%28mtDNA%29">pre-HV</a> clades (5.6%) and a smaller sub-Saharan <a href="Haplogroup%20L1%20%28mtDNA%29">L haplogroups</a> frequency (3.4%) than in Madeira as the number of sub-Saharan slaves in the Açores never reached the proportions that took place in Madeira.

A multi generational inherited Y chromosomes of Asian or sub-Saharan origins may be held by European looking people as it does not show physical looks, but the origin of the patrilineage.

Inhabitants of the various islands have DNA of various origins.
So a minority on the islands has non European ancestry.

Since the 17th century, many Azoreans have emigrated, mainly to <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a> and Southeastern <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, especially the cities of <a href="New%20Bedford">New Bedford</a>, Bristol, Barrington, Pawtucket, Central Falls, West Warwick, Hudson, Marlborough, East Providence, River Point, Taunton and <a href="Fall%20River%2C%20Massachusetts">Fall River</a> have been, and remain, the primary destination for Azorean emigrants. Emigrants from the East coast returned to their homeland and taught the American dory fishing technique to the Portuguese who began catching <a href="cod">cod</a> again on the <a href="Grand%20Bank">Grand Bank</a> in the 19th century.
Northern <a href="California">California</a> was the final destination for many of the Massachusetts immigrants who then moved on to the <a href="San%20Joaquin%20Valley">San Joaquin Valley</a>, especially the city of <a href="Turlock%2C%20California">Turlock</a>, just south of Modesto. In the late 1800s many Azoreans emigrated to the <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>an islands. The <a href="tuna">tuna</a> fishing industry drew a significant number of Azoreans to the <a href="Point%20Loma">Point Loma</a> neighborhood of <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, in <a href="Southern%20California">Southern California</a>. From 1921 to 1977, about 250,000 Azoreans immigrated to
Rhode Island and Massachusetts.

Many Azoreans also moved to <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> and <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> (<a href="Portuguese%20immigration%20to%20Hawaii">Portuguese immigration to Hawaii</a>). <a href="Florian%C3%B3polis">Florianópolis</a> and <a href="Porto%20Alegre">Porto Alegre</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Region%2C%20Brazil">Southern Region</a> of Brazil were founded by Azoreans, who accounted for over half of <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a> and <a href="Santa%20Catarina%20%28state%29">Santa Catarina</a>'s population in the late 18th century. As late as 1960 mass immigration currents were registered to Brazil, and many were from the Azores.

Since 1976, the Azores is an autonomous region integrated within the framework of the Portuguese Republic. It has its own government and autonomous legislature within its own political-administrative statute and organic law. Its governmental organs include: the Legislative Assembly, a <a href="unicameral">unicameral</a> parliament composed of 52 elected deputies, elected by universal <a href="suffrage">suffrage</a> for a four-year term; the Regional Government and Presidency, with parliamentary legitimacy, composed of a President, a Vice-President and seven Regional Secretaries responsible for day-to-day operations. It is represented in the Council of Ministers by a representative appointed by the President of the Republic, which was created during the revision of the constitution of 2004 (which, among other things, removed the older Portuguese representative that was appointed by the President of the Republic, beholden to the Council of State and coincident with the President).

Since becoming a Portuguese autonomous region, the executive branch of the regional authority has been located in <a href="Ponta%20Delgada">Ponta Delgada</a>, the legislative branch in <a href="Horta%20%28Azores%29">Horta</a>, and the judicial branch in <a href="Angra%20do%20Hero%C3%ADsmo">Angra do Heroísmo</a>.

The islands of the archipelago do not have independent status in law, except in electoral law and are governed by 19 municipalities that subdivide the islands. In addition, until the administrative reform of the 19th century, the following civil parishes had municipal standing: Topo (today integrated into the municipality of <a href="Calheta%20%28Azores%29">Calheta</a>, São Jorge); <a href="Praia%20%28Santa%20Cruz%20da%20Graciosa%29">Praia</a> (today integrated into municipality of <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20da%20Graciosa">Santa Cruz da Graciosa</a>); <a href="Vila%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Sebasti%C3%A3o">São Sebastião</a> (today an integral part of the municipality of Angra do Heroísmo); Capelas (now part of the municipality of Ponta Delgada); and Água de Pau (now a civil parish in the municipality of Lagoa). These civil parishes still retain their titles of "vila" in name only; the populations of Capelas and neighbouring parish still protest the change and promote the restoration of their status. The municipalities are further subdivided into several civil parishes, with the exception of <a href="Corvo%20%28Azores%29">Corvo</a> (the only municipality by law without a civil parish, owing to its size).

Azorean politics is dominated by the two largest Portuguese political parties, the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Portugal%29">Social Democratic Party (PSD)</a> and the <a href="Socialist%20Party%20%28Portugal%29">Socialist Party (PS)</a>, the latter holding a majority in the Regional Legislative Assembly. The <a href="Democratic%20and%20Social%20Center%20/%20People%27s%20Party">Democratic and Social Center / People's Party</a> (CDS/PP), the <a href="Left%20Bloc">Left Bloc</a> (BE), the <a href="Unitarian%20Democratic%20Coalition">Unitarian Democratic Coalition</a> (CDU) and the <a href="People%27s%20Monarchist%20Party%20%28Portugal%29">People's Monarchist Party</a> (PPM) are also represented in the local parliament. Currently, , the Socialist Party (PS) and its leader, <a href="Carlos%20C%C3%A9sar">Carlos César</a> have a plurality of the seats in the Assembly, and operate the Regional Government. Although the PS dominates the regional politics, the PSD is traditionally popular in city and <a href="town%20council">town council</a> elections.

Each of the nine islands has an airfield, although the majority are airfields rather than airports. The commercial terminals in Ponta Delgada, Horta, Vila do Porto and Santa Cruz das Flores are operated by <a href="ANA%20%E2%80%93%20Aeroportos%20de%20Portugal">ANA – Aeroportos de Portugal</a>, a public entity that oversees the operations of airports across Portugal. The remaining, except for <a href="Lajes%20Field">Lajes Field</a>, are operated by the Regional Government. Lajes is a military airbase, as well as a commercial airport, and is operated by the Portuguese Armed Forces in conjunction with the United States.

The airports are:

The Azores has had a long history of water transport to overcome distances and establish inter-community contacts and trade. Consequently, the shipbuilding industry developed in many islands, from small fishing boats, to whaling sloops to larger passenger services. Passenger traffic to the main islands (São Miguel, Santa Maria, Terceira and Faial) began in the 17th century, and between the 18th–19th century, the "Pico Yacht" controlled the lucrative summer traffic season.

After 1871, the "Insulana Shipping Company" was the only entity responsible for regular traffic between the islands (except Corvo), Madeira and the United States. Yet, cargo and passenger transportation ceased in the 1970s, and the ships were sold or converted into tuna fishing boats. For the next 20 years, commercial maritime service between the islands ceased (except between Faial-Pico and Lajes das Flores-Vila do Corvo).

"<a href="Transma%C3%A7or">Transmaçor</a>" (Transportes Marítimos Açorianos, Lda.) was founded on 22 December 1987, resulting from the fusion of "Empresa das Lanchas do Pico, Ld", owners of the ships "Espalamaca" and "Calheta" (ships that had travelled the canal between Faial and Pico for several years); "Empresa Açoreana de Transportes Marítimos, Lda", which operated the ship "Terra Alta"; and "Transcanal (Transportes Marítimos do Canal, Lda.)" operator the traditional boats "Picaroto" and "Manuel José". In the Central Group, the shipping company operates four to six time daily connections between Horta and Madalena throughout the year, using its small fleet of ships ("<a href="MV%20Cruzeiro%20das%20Ilhas">Cruzeiro das Ilhas</a>", "<a href="MV%20Cruzeiro%20do%20Canal">Cruzeiro do Canal</a>", "Expresso das Ilhas" and "Expresso do Triângulo"), in addition to inter-island connections between Faial, Pico, São Jorge and Terceira during the summer months.

Meanwhile, new initiatives began in the late 1990s: the catamaran "Iapetos" began services, followed by "Lady of Mann" and "Golfinho Azul" (chartered by Açorline).

In 2005, "<a href="Atl%C3%A2nticoline">Atlânticoline</a>" was established, providing services with the ships "Ilha Azul" and , later adding the "Viking" in 2009. In 2009, Atlanticoline was involved in a controversial rejection of a 750-passenger, 150-vehicle ship ordered from the "Estaleiros de Viana do Castelo" ("Viana do Castelo Shipyards"). The "Atlantida", a 50 million Euro cruiser (as part of a two-ship deal with the other named "Anticiclone") was rejected in 2009 by Atlanticoline for the under-performance of the power-plant. Although it would only result in a five-minute delay between islands, the public company rejected the ship, and the contract was broken over the builder's inability to deliver the required ship on time. While, the ship was being shopped to other interested parties (<a href="Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez">Hugo Chávez</a> once considered purchasing the ferryboat in 2010), no interested buyers appeared, and ENVC decided to cede the "Atlantida" to Atlânticoline as part of the latter's open international competition to charter two ships in 2012.

On 20 June 2011, the Regional Government announced that it would purchase 60% of Transmaçor, equivalent to 500,000 Euro of the company's capital. With this transaction the Autonomous government of the Azores ceded control, of which it once had 88% of the capital. The signed memorandum of understanding concluded negotiations between the various parties involved, under which the liability of Transmaçor (worth a total of 8 million Euro) was divided equally between the Region and businessman <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Almeida">José Almeida</a>, who is now the holder of a majority stake in the company.

Similarly, the Regional Government approved the consolidation of the three individual port authorities (Administração dos Portos do Triângulo e Grupo Ocidental, Administração dos Portos da Terceira e Graciosa and the Administração dos Portos das Ilhas de São Miguel e Santa Maria) and regional Portos dos Açores into one entity that resulted in a 2.2 million Euro cost savings, in addition to a reduction from 11 to three administrators.

Azoreans have developed their own distinct regional identity and cultural traits, from a combination of continental Portuguese customs brought by various waves of immigration and local political and environmental factors.

Religious festivals, patron saints and traditional holidays mark the Azorean calendar. The most important religious events are tied with the festivals associated with the <a href="cult%20of%20the%20Holy%20Spirit">cult of the Holy Spirit</a>, commonly referred to as the festivals of the Holy Spirit (or "Espírito Santo"), rooted in millenarian dogma and held on all islands from May to September. These festivals are very important to the Azorean people, who are primarily Roman Catholic, and combine religious rituals with processions celebrating the benevolence and egalitarianism of neighbours. These events are centred around "treatros" or "impérios", small buildings that host the meals, adoration and charity of the participants, and used to store the artefacts associated with the events. On Terceira, for example, these impérios have grown into ornate buildings painted and cared for by the local brotherhoods in their respective parishes. The events focus on the members of local parishes, not tourists, but all are welcome, as sharing is one of the main principles of the festivals. Some limited events focus on tourists, including a public event that the city government of Ponta Delgada on the island of São Miguel holds, which attracts visitors and locals.
Another event, the Festival of the <a href="Cult%20of%20Senhor%20Santo%20Cristo%20dos%20Milagres">Lord Holy Christ of the Miracles</a> (or "Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres") in <a href="Ponta%20Delgada">Ponta Delgada</a> on the island of <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Miguel%20Island">São Miguel</a>, is the largest individual religious event in the Azores, and takes place on the fifth Sunday after Easter. Pilgrims from within the Portuguese diaspora normally travel to Ponta Delgada to participate in an afternoon procession behind the image of Christ along the flower-decorated streets of the city. Although the solemn procession is only held on one day, the events of the Festival of Senhor Santo Cristo occur over a period of a week and involve a ritual of moving the image between the main church and convent nightly, ultimately culminating in the procession, which is televised within the Azores and to the Portuguese diaspora.
The Sanjoaninas Festivities in <a href="Angra%20do%20Hero%C3%ADsmo">Angra do Heroísmo</a> on Terceira are held in June honoring <a href="Anthony%20of%20Padua">Saint Anthony</a>, <a href="Saint%20Peter">Saint Peter</a> and <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">Saint John the Baptist</a>, in a large religious celebration.
The festival of <a href="Our%20Lady%20of%20Lourdes">Our Lady of Lourdes</a> (or "Nossa Senhora de Lourdes"), <a href="patron%20saint">patron saint</a> of whalers, begins in Lajes on <a href="Pico%20Island">Pico Island</a> on the last Sunday of August and runs through the week—Whalers Week. It is marked by social and cultural events connected to the tradition of <a href="Whaling">whale hunting</a>. The Wine <a href="Harvest%20festival">Harvest Festival</a> (or "Festa das Vindimas"), takes place during the first week of September and is a century-old custom of the people of Pico.

On Corvo the people celebrate their patron saint Nossa Senhora dos Milagres (Our Lady of Miracles) on 15 August every year in addition to the festivals of the Divine Holy Spirit. The Festival da Maré de Agosto (August Sea Festival), takes place every year beginning on 15 August in Praia Formosa on Santa Maria. Also, the Semana do Mar (Sea Week), dedicated almost exclusively to <a href="Watersport">water sports</a>, takes place in August in the city of Horta, on Faial.

<a href="Carnival">Carnaval</a> is also celebrated in the Azores. Parades and pageants are the heart of the Carnaval festivities. There is lively music, colorful costumes, hand-made masks, and floats.
The traditional bullfights in the bullring are ongoing as is the running of bulls in the streets.

Outback

The Outback is the vast, remote interior of <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. The term "the Outback" is generally used to refer to locations that are comparatively more remote than those areas named "<a href="Australian%20bush">the bush</a>" which, colloquially, can refer to any lands outside the main <a href="urban%20area">urban area</a>s.

While often envisaged as being <a href="arid">arid</a>, the Outback regions extend from the northern to southern Australian coastlines, and encompass a number of climatic zones; including <a href="tropical%20climate">tropical</a> and monsoonal climates in northern areas, arid areas in the ‘red centre’ and <a href="semi-arid">semi-arid</a> and <a href="temperate%20climate">temperate</a> climates in southerly regions.

Geographically, the Outback is unified by a combination of factors, most notably a low human population density, a largely intact, natural environment and, in many places, low-intensity land uses such as <a href="pastoralism">pastoralism</a> (livestock grazing) in which production is reliant on the natural environment. 

Culturally, the Outback is deeply ingrained in Australian heritage, history and folklore. In 2009 as part of the <a href="Q150">Q150</a> celebrations, the Queensland Outback was announced as one of the <a href="Q150%20Icons">Q150 Icons</a> of Queensland for its role as a "natural attraction".
Indigenous Australians have lived in the Outback for approximately 50,000 years and occupied all Outback regions, including the driest deserts, when Europeans first entered central Australia in the 1800s. Many Indigenous Australians retain strong physical and cultural links to their traditional country and are legally recognised as the Traditional Owners of large parts of the Outback under Commonwealth <a href="Native%20title%20in%20Australia">Native Title</a> legislation.

Early European exploration of inland Australia was sporadic. More focus was on the more accessible and fertile coastal areas. The first party to successfully cross the <a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28Australia%29">Blue Mountains</a> just outside Sydney was led by <a href="Gregory%20Blaxland">Gregory Blaxland</a> in 1813, 25 years after the colony was established. People starting with <a href="John%20Oxley">John Oxley</a> in 1817, 1818 and 1821, followed by <a href="Charles%20Sturt">Charles Sturt</a> in 1829–1830 attempted to follow the westward-flowing rivers to find an "inland sea", but these were found to all flow into the <a href="Murray%20River">Murray River</a> and <a href="Darling%20River">Darling River</a> which turn south.
Over the period 1858 to 1861, <a href="John%20McDouall%20Stuart">John McDouall Stuart</a> led six expeditions north from Adelaide into the outback, culminating in successfully reaching the north coast of Australia and returning, without the loss of any of the party's members' lives. This contrasts with the ill-fated <a href="Burke%20and%20Wills%20expedition">Burke and Wills expedition</a> in 1860–61 which was much better funded, but resulted in the deaths of three of the members of the transcontinental party.

The <a href="Overland%20Telegraph">Overland Telegraph</a> line was constructed in the 1870s along the route identified by Stuart.

In 1865 the surveyor <a href="George%20Goyder">George Goyder</a>, using changes in vegetation patterns, mapped a <a href="Goyder%27s%20Line">line in South Australia</a>, north of which he considered rainfall to be too unreliable to support agriculture.

Exploration of the outback continued in the 1950s when <a href="Len%20Beadell">Len Beadell</a> explored, surveyed and built many roads in support of the <a href="Nuclear%20weapons%20tests%20in%20Australia">nuclear weapons tests</a> at <a href="Emu%20Field">Emu Field</a> and <a href="Maralinga%2C%20South%20Australia">Maralinga</a> and rocket testing on the <a href="Woomera%20Prohibited%20Area">Woomera Prohibited Area</a>. Mineral exploration continues as new mineral deposits are identified and developed.

While the early explorers used horses to cross the outback, the first woman to make the journey riding a horse was <a href="Anna%20Hingley">Anna Hingley</a>, who rode from <a href="Broome%2C%20Western%20Australia">Broome</a> to <a href="Cairns">Cairns</a> in 2006.

The paucity of industrial land use has led to the Outback being recognised globally as one of the largest remaining, intact natural areas on Earth. Global "Human Footprint" and wilderness reviews highlight the importance of Outback Australia as one of the world's large natural areas, along with the Boreal forests and Tundra regions in North America, the Sahara and Gobi deserts and the tropical forests of the Amazon and Congo Basins.
The savanna (or grassy woodlands) of northern Australia are the largest, intact <a href="savanna">savanna</a> regions in the world. In the south, the <a href="Great%20Western%20Woodlands">Great Western Woodlands</a>, which occupy , an area larger than all of England, are the largest remaining temperate woodland left on Earth.

Reflecting the wide climatic and geological variation, the Outback contains a wealth of distinctive and ecologically-rich ecosystems. Major land types include:

The <a href="Australian">Australian</a> Outback is full of very important well-adapted wildlife, although much of it may not be immediately visible to the casual observer. Many animals, such as <a href="red%20kangaroo">red kangaroo</a>s and <a href="dingo">dingo</a>es, hide in bushes to rest and keep cool during the heat of the day.

Birdlife is prolific, most often seen at waterholes at dawn and dusk. Huge flocks of <a href="budgerigars">budgerigars</a>, <a href="cockatoo">cockatoo</a>s, <a href="Corella%20%28bird%29">corellas</a> and <a href="galah">galah</a>s are often sighted. On bare ground or roads during the winter, various species of snakes and lizards bask in the sun, but they are rarely seen during the summer months.

Feral animals such as camels thrive in central Australia, brought to Australia by pastoralists and explorers, along with the early <a href="Afghan%20%28Australia%29">Afghan drivers</a>. Feral horses known as '<a href="brumby">brumbies</a>' are station horses that have run wild. Feral pigs, foxes, cats and rabbits are other imported animals that also degrade the environment, so time and money is spent eradicating them in an attempt to help protect fragile rangelands.

The Outback is home to a diverse set of animal species, such as the kangaroo, emu and dingo. The <a href="Dingo%20Fence">Dingo Fence</a> was built to restrict dingo movements into agricultural areas towards the south east of the continent. The marginally fertile parts are primarily utilised as rangelands and have been traditionally used for sheep or cattle grazing, on cattle stations which are leased from the Federal Government. While small areas of the outback consist of clay soils the majority has exceedingly infertile palaeosols. <a href="Australian%20Fossil%20Mammal%20Sites%20%28Riversleigh%29">Riversleigh</a>, in Queensland, is one of Australia's most renowned fossil sites and was recorded as a World Heritage site in 1994. The 100 km (39 sq mi) area contains fossil remains of ancient mammals, birds and reptiles of <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> and <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> age.

The largest industry across the Outback, in terms of the area occupied, is <a href="pastoralism">pastoralism</a>, in which cattle, sheep, and sometimes goats, are grazed in mostly intact, natural ecosystems. Widespread use of bore water, obtained from underground aquifers, including the <a href="Great%20Artesian%20Basin">Great Artesian Basin</a>, has enabled livestock to be grazed across vast areas in which no permanent surface water exists naturally.

Capitalizing on the lack of pasture improvement and absence of fertiliser and pesticide use, many Outback pastoral properties are certified as <a href="Organic%20farming">organic</a> livestock producers. In 2014, , most of which is in Outback Australia, was fully certified as organic farm production, making Australia the largest certified organic production area in the world.

"Nothing says Australia quite like our Outback," states the national tourism web site. Tourism is a major industry across the Outback, and commonwealth and state tourism agencies explicitly target Outback Australia as a desirable destination for domestic and international travellers. There is no breakdown of tourism revenues for the "Outback" "per se". However, regional tourism is a major component of national tourism incomes. <a href="Tourism%20Australia">Tourism Australia</a> explicitly markets nature-based and Indigenous-led experiences to tourists. In the 2015–2016 financial year, 815,000 visitors spent $988 million while on holidays in the Northern Territory alone.

There are many popular tourist attractions in the Outback. Some of the well known destinations include:

Other than agriculture and tourism, the main economic activity in this vast and sparsely settled area is mining. Owing to the almost complete absence of mountain building and glaciation since the <a href="Permian">Permian</a> (in many areas since the <a href="Cambrian">Cambrian</a>) ages, the outback is extremely rich in iron, aluminium, <a href="manganese">manganese</a> and uranium ores, and also contains major deposits of gold, nickel, copper, lead and zinc ores. Because of its size, the value of grazing and mining is considerable. Major mines and mining areas in the Outback include opals at <a href="Coober%20Pedy%2C%20South%20Australia">Coober Pedy</a>, <a href="Lightning%20Ridge%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Lightning Ridge</a> and <a href="White%20Cliffs%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">White Cliffs</a>, metals at <a href="Broken%20Hill%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Broken Hill</a>, <a href="Tennant%20Creek%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Tennant Creek</a>, <a href="Olympic%20Dam%2C%20South%20Australia">Olympic Dam</a> and the remote <a href="Challenger%20Mine">Challenger Mine</a>. Oil and gas are extracted in the <a href="Cooper%20Basin">Cooper Basin</a> around <a href="Moomba%2C%20South%20Australia">Moomba</a>.

In Western Australia the <a href="Argyle%20diamond%20mine">Argyle diamond mine</a> in the <a href="Kimberley%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Kimberley</a> is the world's biggest producer of natural diamonds and contributes approximately one-third of the world's natural supply. The <a href="Pilbara">Pilbara</a> region's economy is dominated by mining and petroleum industries. Most of Australia's <a href="iron%20ore">iron ore</a> is also mined in the Pilbara and it also has one of the world's major <a href="manganese">manganese</a> mines.
<a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Aboriginal</a> communities in outback regions, such as the <a href="Anangu%20Pitjantjatjara%20Yankunytjatjara">Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara</a> lands in northern South Australia, have not been displaced as they have been in areas of intensive agriculture and large cities, in coastal areas.

The total population of the Outback in Australia declined from 700,000 in 1996 to 690,000 in 2006. The largest decline was noted in the <a href="Central%20Australia">Outback Northern Territory</a>, while the Kimberley and Pilbara showed population increases during the same period. The sex ratio is 1040 males for 1000 females and 17% of the total population is indigenous.

The <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Doctor%20Service">Royal Flying Doctor Service</a> (RFDS) started service in 1928 and helps people who live in the outback of Australia. In former times, serious injuries or illnesses often meant death due to the lack of proper medical facilities and trained personnel.

In most outback communities, the number of children is too small for a conventional school to operate. Children are educated at home by the <a href="School%20of%20the%20Air">School of the Air</a>. Originally the teachers communicated with the children via radio, but now satellite telecommunication is used instead.
Some children attend boarding school, mostly only those in secondary school.

The concept of 'back' country, which initially meant land beyond the settled regions, was in existence in 1800. Crossing of the Blue Mountains and other exploration of the inland however gave a different dimension to the perception. The term "outback" was first used in print in 1869, when the writer clearly meant west of <a href="Wagga%20Wagga%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Wagga Wagga</a>, New South Wales.

It is colloquially said that 'the outback' is located "beyond the <a href="Black%20Stump">Black Stump</a>". The location of the black stump may be some hypothetical location or may vary depending on local custom and folklore. It has been suggested that the term comes from the "Black Stump Wine Saloon" that once stood about out of <a href="Coolah%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Coolah, New South Wales</a> on the Gunnedah Road. It is claimed that the saloon, named after the nearby Black Stump Run and Black Stump Creek, was an important staging post for traffic to north-west New South Wales and it became a marker by which people gauged their journeys.

"The <a href="Never%20Never%20%28Australian%20outback%29">Never-Never</a>" is a term referring to remoter parts of the Australian outback. The Outback can also be referred to as "back of beyond", "back o' <a href="Bourke%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bourke</a>" although these terms are more frequently used when referring to something a long way from anywhere, or a long way away. The well-watered north of the continent is often called the "<a href="Top%20End">Top End</a>" and the arid interior "The Red Centre", owing to its vast amounts of red soil and sparse greenery amongst its landscape.

The outback is criss-crossed by historic tracks. Most of the major highways have an excellent <a href="bitumen">bitumen</a> surface and other major roads are usually well-maintained dirt roads. Tracks in very sandy or exceedingly rocky areas may require high-clearance four wheel drives and spare fuel, tyres, food and water before attempting to travel them, however most outback roads are easily traversed in ordinary vehicles, provided care is taken. Drivers unused to dirt roads should be especially cautious – it is recommended that drivers reduce their speed, drive with extra care, and avoid driving at night because animals can stray onto roads. Travelling in remote areas in northern Australia is not advisable during the wet season (November to April), as heavy tropical downpours can quickly make dirt roads impassable. In the remotest parts of Australia fuel sellers are located hundreds of kilometres apart, so spare fuel must be carried or refuelling spots calculated carefully in order not to run out of fuel in between towns. In addition, multiple trailer trucks (known as <a href="Road%20Train">Road Train</a>s) traverse these roads and extreme care must be taken when around these vehicles, due to their weight, length (often three full trailers long) and amount of dust thrown up by over 46 tyres.

The <a href="Stuart%20Highway">Stuart Highway</a> runs from north to south through the centre of the continent, roughly paralleled by the <a href="Adelaide%E2%80%93Darwin%20railway">Adelaide–Darwin railway</a>. There is a proposal to develop some of the roads running from the south-west to the north-east to create an all-weather road named the <a href="Outback%20Highway">Outback Highway</a>, crossing the continent diagonally from <a href="Laverton%2C%20Western%20Australia">Laverton, Western Australia</a> (north of <a href="Kalgoorlie%2C%20Western%20Australia">Kalgoorlie</a>, through the Northern Territory to <a href="Winton%2C%20Queensland">Winton</a>, in Queensland.

Air transport is relied on for mail delivery in some areas, owing to sparse settlement and wet-season road closures. Most outback mines have an airstrip and many have a <a href="fly-in%20fly-out">fly-in fly-out</a> workforce. Most outback <a href="sheep%20station">sheep station</a>s and <a href="cattle%20station">cattle station</a>s have an airstrip and quite a few have their own light plane. Medical and ambulance services are provided by the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Doctor%20Service">Royal Flying Doctor Service</a>. The <a href="School%20of%20the%20Air">School of the Air</a> is a radio-based school using the RFDS radios.

Visitors to the outback often drive their own or rented vehicles, or take organised tours. Travel through remote areas on main roads is easily done and requires no planning. However travel through very remote areas, on isolated tracks, requires planning and a suitable, reliable vehicle (usually a <a href="four-wheel%20drive">four-wheel drive</a>). On very remote routes considerable supplies and equipment may be required; this can include prearranged caches. It is not advisable to travel into these especially remote areas with a single vehicle, unless fully equipped with good communication technology (e.g. a satellite phone, EPIRB etc.). Many visitors prefer to travel in these areas in a convoy. Deaths of tourists and locals becoming stranded on outback trips occasionally occur, sometimes because insufficient water and food supplies were taken, or because people have walked away from their vehicle in search of help. Travellers through very remote areas should always inform a reliable person of their route and expected destination arrival time, and remember that a vehicle is much easier to locate in an aerial search, than a person, so in the event of a breakdown, they must not leave their vehicle.

Absolute Infinite

The Absolute Infinite ("symbol": Ω) is an extension of the idea of <a href="infinity">infinity</a> proposed by <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> <a href="Georg%20Cantor">Georg Cantor</a>.

It can be thought as a number which is bigger than any conceivable or inconceivable quantity, either finite or <a href="transfinite%20number">transfinite</a>.

Cantor linked the Absolute Infinite with <a href="God">God</a>, and believed that it had various <a href="mathematical">mathematical</a> properties, including the <a href="reflection%20principle">reflection principle</a>: every property of the Absolute Infinite is also held by some smaller object.

Cantor said:

Cantor also mentioned the idea in his letters to <a href="Richard%20Dedekind">Richard Dedekind</a> (text in square brackets not present in original):

The idea that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot logically exist seems <a href="paradoxical">paradoxical</a> to many. This is related to <a href="Burali-Forti%20paradox">Cesare Burali-Forti's "paradox"</a> which states that there can be no greatest <a href="ordinal%20number">ordinal number</a>. All of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. However, as in Cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.

More generally, as noted by <a href="A.W.%20Moore%20%28mathematician%29">A.W. Moore</a>, there can be no end to the process of <a href="set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a> formation, and thus no such thing as the "totality of all sets", or the "set hierarchy". Any such totality would itself have to be a set, thus lying somewhere within the <a href="cumulative%20hierarchy">hierarchy</a> and thus failing to contain every set.

A standard solution to this problem is found in <a href="Zermelo%20set%20theory">Zermelo's set theory</a>, which does not allow the unrestricted formation of sets from arbitrary properties. Rather, we may form the set of all objects that have a given property "and lie in some given set" (Zermelo's <a href="Axiom%20schema%20of%20specification">Axiom of Separation</a>). This allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory.

While this solves the logical problem, one could argue that the philosophical problem remains. It seems natural that a set of individuals ought to exist, so long as the individuals exist. Indeed, <a href="naive%20set%20theory">naive set theory</a> might be said to be based on this notion. Although Zermelo's fix allows a <a href="Class%20%28set%20theory%29">class</a> to describe arbitrary (possibly "large") entities, these predicates of the <a href="meta-language">meta-language</a> may have no formal existence (i.e., as a set) within the theory.

Acceptance testing

In <a href="engineering">engineering</a> and its various <a href="fields%20of%20engineering">subdisciplines</a>, acceptance testing is a test conducted to determine if the requirements of a <a href="specification">specification</a> or <a href="contract">contract</a> are met. It may involve <a href="chemical%20test">chemical test</a>s, <a href="physical%20test">physical test</a>s, or <a href="Performance%20test%20%28assessment%29">performance test</a>s.

In <a href="systems%20engineering">systems engineering</a> it may involve <a href="black-box%20testing">black-box testing</a> performed on a <a href="system">system</a> (for example: a piece of <a href="software%20system">software</a>, lots of manufactured mechanical parts, or batches of chemical products) prior to its delivery.

In <a href="software%20testing">software testing</a> the <a href="International%20Software%20Testing%20Qualifications%20Board">ISTQB</a> defines "acceptance" as: formal testing with respect to user needs, requirements, and business processes conducted to determine whether a system satisfies the acceptance criteria and to enable the user, customers or other authorized entity to determine whether or not to accept the system. Acceptance testing is also known as user acceptance testing (UAT), end-user testing, <a href="operational%20acceptance%20testing">operational acceptance testing</a> (OAT) or field (acceptance) testing.

A <a href="smoke%20testing%20%28software%29">smoke test</a> may be used as an acceptance test prior to introducing a build of software to the main testing process.

Testing is a set of activities conducted to facilitate discovery and/or evaluation of properties of one or more items under test. Each individual test, known as a test case, exercises a set of predefined test activities, developed to drive the execution of the test item to meet test objectives; including correct implementation, error identification, quality verification and other valued detail. The test environment is usually designed to be identical, or as close as possible, to the anticipated production environment. It includes all facilities, hardware, software, firmware, procedures and/or documentation intended for or used to perform the testing of software.

UAT and OAT test cases are ideally derived in collaboration with business customers, business analysts, testers, and developers. It's essential that these tests include both business logic tests as well as operational environment conditions. The business customers (product owners) are the primary <a href="project%20stakeholder">stakeholders</a> of these tests. As the test conditions successfully achieve their acceptance criteria, the stakeholders are reassured the development is progressing in the right direction.


The acceptance test suite may need to be performed multiple times, as all of the test cases may not be executed within a single test iteration.

The acceptance test suite is run using predefined acceptance test procedures to direct the testers which data to use, the step-by-step processes to follow and the expected result following execution. The actual results are retained for comparison with the expected results. If the actual results match the expected results for each test case, the test case is said to pass. If the quantity of non-passing test cases does not breach the project's predetermined threshold, the test suite is said to pass. If it does, the system may either be rejected or accepted on conditions previously agreed between the sponsor and the manufacturer.

The anticipated result of a successful test execution:

The objective is to provide confidence that the developed product meets both the functional and non-functional requirements. The purpose of conducting acceptance testing is that once completed, and provided the acceptance criteria are met, it is expected the sponsors will sign-off on the product development/enhancement as satisfying the defined requirements (previously agreed between business and product provider/developer).

User acceptance testing (UAT) consists of a process of verifying that a solution works for the user. It is not <a href="system%20testing">system testing</a> (ensuring software does not crash and meets documented requirements), but rather ensures that the solution will work for the user (i.e., tests that the user accepts the solution); software vendors often refer to this as "Beta testing".

This testing should be undertaken by a <a href="subject-matter%20expert">subject-matter expert</a> (SME), preferably the owner or client of the solution under test, and provide a summary of the findings for confirmation to proceed after trial or review. In <a href="Software%20development%20process">software development</a>, UAT as one of the final stages of a project often occurs before a client or customer accepts the new system. Users of the system perform tests in line with what would occur in real-life scenarios.

It is important that the materials given to the tester be similar to the materials that the end user will have. Testers should be given real-life scenarios such as the three most common or difficult tasks that the users they represent will undertake.

The UAT acts as a final verification of the required business functionality and proper functioning of the system, emulating real-world conditions on behalf of the paying client or a specific large customer. If the software works as required and without issues during normal use, one can reasonably extrapolate the same level of stability in production.

User tests, usually performed by clients or by end-users, do not normally focus on identifying simple cosmetic problems such as spelling errors, nor on <a href="Software%20bug">showstopper</a> defects, such as <a href="crash%20%28computing%29">software crashes</a>; testers and developers identify and fix these issues during earlier <a href="unit%20testing">unit testing</a>, <a href="integration%20testing">integration testing</a>, and system testing phases.

UAT should be executed against test scenarios. Test scenarios usually differ from System or Functional test cases in that they represent a "player" or "user" journey. The broad nature of the test scenario ensures that the focus is on the journey and not on technical or system-specific details, staying away from "click-by-click" test steps to allow for a variance in users' behaviour. Test scenarios can be broken down into logical "days", which are usually where the actor (player/customer/operator) or system (backoffice, front end) changes.

In industry, a common UAT is a factory acceptance test (FAT). This test takes place before installation of the equipment. Most of the time testers not only check that the equipment meets the specification, but also that it is fully functional. A FAT usually includes a check of completeness, a verification against contractual requirements, a proof of functionality (either by simulation or a conventional function test) and a final inspection.

The results of these tests give clients confidence in how the system will perform in production. There may also be legal or contractual requirements for acceptance of the system.

<a href="Operational%20acceptance%20testing">Operational acceptance testing</a> (OAT) is used to conduct operational readiness (pre-release) of a product, service or system as part of a <a href="quality%20management%20system">quality management system</a>. OAT is a common type of non-functional <a href="software%20testing">software testing</a>, used mainly in <a href="software%20development">software development</a> and <a href="software%20maintenance">software maintenance</a> projects. This type of testing focuses on the <a href="operational%20readiness">operational readiness</a> of the system to be supported, and/or to become part of the production environment.

Acceptance testing is a term used in <a href="agile%20software%20development">agile software development</a> methodologies, particularly <a href="extreme%20programming">extreme programming</a>, referring to the <a href="functional%20testing">functional testing</a> of a <a href="user%20story">user story</a> by the software development team during the implementation phase.

The customer specifies scenarios to test when a user story has been correctly implemented. A story can have one or many acceptance tests, whatever it takes to ensure the functionality works. Acceptance tests are black-box system tests. Each acceptance test represents some expected result from the system. Customers are responsible for verifying the correctness of the acceptance tests and reviewing test scores to decide which failed tests are of highest priority. Acceptance tests are also used as regression tests prior to a production release. A user story is not considered complete until it has passed its acceptance tests. This means that new acceptance tests must be created for each iteration or the development team will report zero progress.

Typical types of acceptance testing include the following

Archbishopric of Riga

The Archbishopric of Riga (, ) was an <a href="archbishop">archbishop</a>ric in <a href="Terra%20Mariana">Medieval Livonia</a>, a subject to the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a>. It was established in 1186 as the bishopric of <a href="Livonia">Livonia</a> at <a href="Ik%C5%A1%C4%B7ile">Üxküll</a>, then after moving to <a href="Riga">Riga</a> it became the bishopric of Riga in 1202 and was elevated to an archbishopric in 1255.

The archbishops of Riga were also the secular rulers of <a href="Riga">Riga</a> until 1561 when during the <a href="reformation">reformation</a> the territory converted from <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> to <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a> and all church territories were secularized. The <a href="Episcopal%20see">see</a> was restored as a <a href="diocese">diocese</a> of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> in 1918 and raised into an archdiocese in 1923.
A new <a href="Diocese%20of%20Inflanty">Bishopric of Livonia</a> was established in <a href="Latgalia">Latgalia</a> in 1621 during the <a href="Inflanty%20Voivodeship">Inflanty Voivodeship</a> of the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>.

The Archbishops of Riga were innovators in the field of <a href="Mint%20%28coin%29">minting</a> currency, reviving techniques abandoned since the collapse of Rome. The names of individual archbishops after 1418, as well as the years of their respective reigns, are stamped on Livonian <a href="penny">pennies</a> excavated at archaeological sites. In many cases, this is the only biographical data available. No Livonian pennies before 1418 have been found.

Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia

Albert Frederick (, ; 7 May 1553, in <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a> – 28 August 1618, in <a href="Fischhausen">Fischhausen</a>, Rybaki) was <a href="Duke%20of%20Prussia">Duke of Prussia</a> from 1568 until his death. He was a son of <a href="Albert%20of%20Prussia">Albert of Prussia</a> and <a href="Anna%20Marie%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Anna Marie of Brunswick-Lüneburg</a>. He was the second and last Prussian duke of the <a href="Ansbach">Ansbach</a> branch of the <a href="Hohenzollern">Hohenzollern</a> family.

Albert became Duke of Prussia after paying <a href="Homage%20%28feudal%29">feudal homage</a> to the <a href="King%20of%20Poland">King of Poland</a>, <a href="Zygmunt%20August">Zygmunt August</a> (Ducal Prussia was a fief of Poland), on July 19, 1569 in <a href="Lublin">Lublin</a>. The homage was described by the Polish chronicler <a href="Jan%20Kochanowski">Jan Kochanowski</a> in his work "Proporzec" ("Standard"). During the 1573 Polish election, Albert Frederick attempted to gain acceptance to the Polish <a href="senate">senate</a> but was opposed by the powerful <a href="Jan%20Zamoyski">Jan Zamoyski</a> (later Grand <a href="Hetman">Hetman</a> of the <a href="Crown%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Poland">Crown of the Kingdom of Poland</a>) who feared the influence of <a href="Protestants">Protestants</a> in the Polish legislative body. Albert Frederick initially refused to recognize the election of <a href="Stefan%20Bathory">Stefan Bathory</a> and supported the candidacy of <a href="Maximilian%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian of Habsburg</a>. However, at the <a href="Toru%C5%84">Toruń</a> <a href="sejm">sejm</a> of October 1576 he gave his support to the new monarch.

As the great grandson of the Polish king <a href="Casimir%20IV%20Jagiellon">Casimir IV Jagiellon</a>, and as a Duke in Prussia who was fluent in Polish, Albert Frederick was seriously considered for a time as a possible candidate for the Polish throne. He particularly enjoyed the support of Polish <a href="Lutherans">Lutherans</a>.

In 1572 he began to exhibit signs of mental disorder. In early 1578, the regency was taken over by his cousin, <a href="George%20Frederick%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg-Ansbach">George Frederick of Brandenburg-Kulmbach</a> (1539–1603). After George Frederick's death in 1603, the Polish king <a href="Sigismund%20III%20Vasa">Sigismund III Vasa</a> appointed <a href="Joachim%20III%20Frederick%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">Joachim Frederick</a> as regent in 1605, and permitted his son, <a href="John%20Sigismund%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">John Sigismund</a>, to succeed him in 1611. The latter became Duke of Prussia after Albert Frederick's death in 1618.

Albert Frederick was married in 1573 to <a href="Marie%20Eleonore%20of%20Cleves">Marie Eleonore of Cleves</a>, a daughter of <a href="Wilhelm%2C%20Duke%20of%20J%C3%BClich-Cleves-Berg">Wilhelm, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg</a> and <a href="Maria%20of%20Habsburg%2C%20Archduchess%20of%20Austria">Archduchess Maria of Austria</a> (1531–1581).

Ansbach

Ansbach (; ) is a city in the <a href="Germany">German</a> state of <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>. It is the capital of the <a href="Regierungsbezirk">administrative region</a> of <a href="Mittelfranken">Middle Franconia</a>. Ansbach is southwest of <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> and north of <a href="Munich">Munich</a>, on the <a href="Fr%C3%A4nkische%20Rezat">Fränkische Rezat</a> (Rezat River), a tributary of the <a href="Main%20%28river%29">Main</a> river. In 2004, its population was 40,723.

Developed in the 8th century as a <a href="Benedictine%20monastery">Benedictine monastery</a>, it became the seat of the <a href="House%20of%20Hohenzollern">Hohenzollern</a> family in 1331. In 1460, the Margraves of <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg%E2%80%93Ansbach">Brandenburg-Ansbach</a> lived here. The city has a castle known as <a href="Markgrafenschlo%C3%9F">Margrafen–Schloss</a>, built between 1704–1738. It was not badly damaged during the <a href="World%20Wars">World Wars</a> and hence retains its original historical baroque sheen. Ansbach is now home to a US military base and to the <a href="Ansbach%20University%20of%20Applied%20Sciences">Ansbach University of Applied Sciences</a>.

The city has connections via autobahn <a href="Bundesautobahn%206">A6</a> and highways <a href="Bundesstra%C3%9Fe%2013">B13</a> and <a href="Bundesstra%C3%9Fe%2014">B14</a>. <a href="Ansbach%20station">Ansbach station</a> is on the <a href="Nuremberg%E2%80%93Crailsheim%20railway">Nürnberg–Crailsheim</a> and <a href="Treuchtlingen%E2%80%93W%C3%BCrzburg%20railway">Treuchtlingen–Würzburg</a> railways and is the terminus of line S4 of the <a href="Nuremberg%20S-Bahn">Nuremberg S-Bahn</a>.

Ansbach was originally called Onoltesbach (about 790 AD), a term composed of three parts.

The individual word elements are "Onold" (the city founder's name), the <a href="Suffix">Suffix</a> "-es" (a possessive ending, like "-'s" in English) and the <a href="Old%20High%20German">Old High German</a> expression "pah" or "bach" (for <a href="Stream">brook</a>). The name of the city has slightly changed throughout the centuries into Onoltespah (837 AD), Onoldesbach (1141 AD), Onoldsbach (1230 AD), Onelspach (1338 AD), Onsbach (1508 AD) and finally Ansbach (1732 AD).

It was also formerly known as Anspach.

According to folklore, towards the end of the 7th century a group of Franconian peasants and their families went up into the wilderness to found a new settlement. Their leader Onold led them to an area called the "Rezattal" (Rezat valley). This is where they founded the "Urhöfe" (meaning the first farms: Knollenhof, Voggenhof and Rabenhof). Gradually more settlers, such as the "Winden-Tribe" came, and the farms grew into a small village. Many villages around Ansbach were founded by the "Winden" during that period (even today their settlements can easily identified by their names, like "Meinhardszwinden", "Dautenwinden" or "Brodswinden" for example).
A <a href="Benedictine%20Order">Benedictine monastery</a> was established there around 748 by the <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> noble <a href="Gumbertus">St Gumbertus</a>. The adjoining village of Onoltesbach is first noticed as a proper town in 1221.

The counts of <a href="County%20of%20%C3%96ttingen">Öttingen</a> ruled over Ansbach until the <a href="Hohenzollern">Hohenzollern</a> burgrave of <a href="Burgraviate%20of%20N%C3%BCrnberg">Nürnberg</a> took over in 1331. The Hohenzollerns made Ansbach the seat of their dynasty until their acquisition of the <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg">Margraviate of Brandenburg</a> in 1415. After the 1440 death of <a href="Frederick%20I%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">Frederick I</a>, a cadet branch of the family established itself as the <a href="Brandenburg-Ansbach">margraves of Ansbach</a>. <a href="George%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg-Ansbach">George the Pious</a> introduced the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> to Ansbach in 1528, leading to the secularization of <a href="St.%20Gumbertus%2C%20Ansbach">Gumbertus Abbey</a> in 1563.

The <a href="Markgrafenschlo%C3%9F">Markgrafenschloß</a> was built between 1704–1738. Its gardens continued to be a notable attraction into the 19th century. In 1791, the last margrave sold his realm to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a>. In 1796, the Duke of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Zweibr%C3%BCcken">Zweibrücken</a>, <a href="Maximilian%20I%20Joseph%20of%20Bavaria">Maximilian Joseph</a> — the future Bavarian king Max I Joseph — was exiled to Ansbach after Zweibrücken had been taken by the French. In Ansbach, <a href="Maximilian%20von%20Montgelas">Maximilian von Montgelas</a> wrote an elaborate concept for the future political organization of Bavaria, which is known as the Ansbacher Mémoire. Napoleon forced Prussia to cede Ansbach and its principality to <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria">Bavaria</a> in the Franco-Prussian treaty of alliance signed at <a href="Sch%C3%B6nbrunn%20Palace">Schönbrunn Palace</a> on 15 December 1805 at the end of the <a href="Third%20Coalition">Third Coalition</a>. The act was confirmed by the 1815 <a href="Congress%20of%20Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a>; Prussia was compensated with the Bavarian <a href="Berg%20%28German%20region%29">duchy of Berg</a>. Ansbach became the capital of the circle of Middle Franconia following the <a href="unification%20of%20Germany">unification of Germany</a>; at the time, it had a population of 12,635.

Jewish families were resident in Ansbach from at least the end of the 18th century. They set up a Jewish Cemetery in the Ruglaender Strasse, which was vandalised and razed under the Nazi regime in the <a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a>. It was repaired in 1946, but it was damaged several times more. A plaque on the wall of the cemetery commemorates these events. The Jewish Congregation built its synagogue at No 3 Rosenbadstrasse, but it too was damaged by the SA, though it was not burnt down for fear of damaging the neighbouring buildings. It serves today as a "Symbolic House of God". A plaque in the entrance serves as a memorial to the synagogue and to Jewish residents who were murdered during the Holocaust. In 1940, at least 500 patients were deported from the Heil- und Pflegeanstalt Ansbach ["Ansbach Medical and Nursing Clinic"] to the extermination facilities Sonnenstein and Hartheim which were disguised as psychiatric institutions, as part of the <a href="Action%20T4">Action T4</a> euthanasia action. They were gassed there. At the clinic in Ansbach itself, around 50 intellectually disabled children were injected with the drug Luminal and killed that way. A plaque was erected in their memory in 1988 in the local hospital at No. 38 Feuchtwangerstrasse.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, a subcamp of <a href="Flossenb%C3%BCrg%20concentration%20camp">Flossenbürg concentration camp</a> was located here. Also during the Second World War the Luftwaffe and Wehrmacht had bases here. The nearby airbase was the home station for the Stab & I/KG53 (Staff & 1st Group of Kampfgeschwader 53) operating 38 <a href="Heinkel%20He%20111">Heinkel He 111</a> bombers. On 1 September 1939 this unit was one of the many that participated in the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland%20%281939%29">attack on Poland</a> that started the war. All of its bridges were destroyed during the course of the war. During the <a href="Western%20Allied%20invasion%20of%20Germany">Western Allied invasion of Germany</a> in April 1945, the airfield was seized by the <a href="United%20States%20Third%20Army">United States Third Army</a>, and used by the <a href="USAAF">USAAF</a> <a href="354th%20Fighter%20Wing">354th Fighter Group</a> which flew <a href="P-47%20Thunderbolts">P-47 Thunderbolts</a> from the aerodrome (designated <a href="Advanced%20Landing%20Ground">ALG R-82</a>) from late April until the German capitulation on 7 May 1945. At the end of the war, 19-year-old student Robert Limpert tried to get the town to surrender to the US Forces without a fight. He was betrayed by <a href="Hitler%20Youth">Hitler Youth</a> and was hung from the portal of the City Hall by the city's military commander, Col. ("Oberst") Ernst Meyer. Several memorials to his heroic deed have been erected over the years, despite opposition from some residents — in the Ludwigskirche, in the Gymnasium Carolinum and at No 6 Kronenstrasse. After the Second World War, Ansbach belonged to the American Zone. The American Military authorities established a displaced persons (DP) camp in what used to be a sanatorium in what is today the Strüth quarter.

<a href="Bachwoche%20Ansbach">Bachwoche Ansbach</a> has been held in Ansbach since 1947. Since 1970, Ansbach has enlarged its municipal area by incorporating adjacent communities. Ansbach hosts several units of the U.S. armed forces, associated with German units under <a href="NATO">NATO</a>. There are five separate U.S. installations: Shipton Kaserne, home to <a href="412th%20Aviation%20Support%20Battalion">412th Aviation Support Battalion</a>, Katterbach Kaserne, formerly the home of the <a href="1st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Infantry Division's</a> <a href="4th%20Combat%20Aviation%20Brigade">4th Combat Aviation Brigade</a>, which has been replaced by the <a href="12th%20Combat%20Aviation%20Brigade%20%28United%20States%29">12th Combat Aviation Brigade</a> as of 2006, as part of the 1st Infantry Division's return to <a href="Fort%20Riley">Fort Riley</a>, Kansas; Bismarck Kaserne, which functions as a satellite post to Katterbach, hosting their Post Theater, barracks, Von Steuben Community Center, Military Police, and other support agencies, Barton Barracks, home to the USAG Ansbach and Bleidorn Barracks, which has a library and housing, and Urlas, which hosts the <a href="Post%20Exchange">Post Exchange</a> as well as a housing area opened in 2010. Ansbach was also home to the headquarters of the <a href="1st%20Armored%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Armored Division (United States)</a> from 1972 to the early 1990s.

On 24 July 2016 <a href="2016%20Ansbach%20bombing">a bomb was detonated</a> in a restaurant in the city, killing at least one person and injuring multiple people. The perpetrator was reported to be a Syrian refugee whose asylum application had been rejected but who had been given exceptional leave to remain until the security situation in Syria returned to a safe condition. Witnesses reported he had tried to enter a nearby music festival but had been turned away, before detonating his device outside a nearby wine bar.




Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> subtype for this climate is "" (Marine West Coast Climate/<a href="Oceanic%20climate">Oceanic climate</a>).
Around the time of the <a href="unification%20of%20Germany">unification of Germany</a> in 1871, the chief manufactures of Ansbach were <a href="woolens">woollen</a>, <a href="textiles">cotton</a>, and half-<a href="silk">silk</a> goods; <a href="earthenware">earthenware</a>; <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a>; <a href="cutlery">cutlery</a>; and <a href="playing%20cards">playing cards</a>. A considerable trade in grain, <a href="wool">wool</a>, and <a href="flax">flax</a> was also supported. By the onset of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, it also produced <a href="machinery">machinery</a>, <a href="toy">toy</a>s, and <a href="embroidery">embroidery</a>.

Ansbach is <a href="Twin%20towns%20and%20sister%20cities">twinned</a> with:

In the novel "The Schirmer Inheritance" (1953) by <a href="Eric%20Ambler">Eric Ambler</a> (1909–1998), Sergeant Franz Schirmer of the Ansbach Dragoons is wounded in the battle of <a href="Battle%20of%20Eylau">Preussisch-Eylau</a> in 1807. He returns to Ansbach to settle but changes his name as he has been posted as a deserter. The bulk of the novel concerns efforts by an American law firm to trace his descendants to claim an inheritance.

National Alliance (, AN) was a <a href="conservatism">conservative</a> <a href="List%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20Italy">political party in Italy</a>. It was the successor of the post-fascist <a href="Italian%20Social%20Movement">Italian Social Movement</a> that distanced itself from its former ideology on its convention in <a href="Fiuggi">Fiuggi</a> ("Fiuggi turning point") and dissolved in favour of the new National Alliance.

<a href="Gianfranco%20Fini">Gianfranco Fini</a> was the leader of the party following its foundation in 1995, however he stepped down in 2008 after being elected to the nominally non-partisan post of President of the <a href="Italian%20Chamber%20of%20Deputies">Italian Chamber of Deputies</a> and was succeeded by <a href="Ignazio%20La%20Russa">Ignazio La Russa</a>, who managed the merger of the party into <a href="The%20People%20of%20Freedom">The People of Freedom</a> (PdL), which happened in 2009.

The AN's official newspaper was "<a href="Secolo%20d%27Italia">Secolo d'Italia</a>".

National Alliance, launched in 1994, was officially founded in January 1995, when the <a href="Italian%20Social%20Movement">Italian Social Movement</a> (MSI), the former <a href="Neo-fascism">neo-fascist</a> party, merged with conservative elements of the former <a href="Christian%20Democracy%20%28Italy%29">Christian Democracy</a>, which had disbanded in 1994 after two years of scandals and various splits due to <a href="Political%20corruption">corruption</a> at its highest levels, exposed by the "<a href="Mani%20pulite">Mani pulite</a>" investigation, and the <a href="Italian%20Liberal%20Party">Italian Liberal Party</a>, disbanded in the same year. Former MSI members were however still the bulk of the new party and former MSI leader <a href="Gianfranco%20Fini">Gianfranco Fini</a> was elected leader of the new party.

The AN logo followed a template very similar to that of the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20of%20the%20Left">Democratic Party of the Left</a>, with the logo of the direct predecessor party in a small circle, as a means of legally preventing others from using it. The name was suggested by an article on the Italian newspaper "<a href="Il%20Tempo%20%28newspaper%29">Il Tempo</a>" written in 1992 by <a href="Domenico%20Fisichella">Domenico Fisichella</a>, a prominent conservative academic. Starting in the 1990s, the MSI gradually transformed into a mainstream <a href="right-wing%20politics">right-wing</a> party, culminating in its 1995 dissolution into AN.

The party was part of all three <a href="House%20of%20Freedoms">House of Freedoms</a> coalition governments led by <a href="Silvio%20Berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</a>. Gianfranco Fini was notably nominated Deputy Prime Minister after the <a href="Italian%20general%20election%2C%202001">2001 general election</a> and was Foreign Minister from November 2004 to May 2006.

When Gianfranco Fini visited <a href="Israel">Israel</a> in late November 2003 in the function of Italian Deputy Prime Minister, he labeled the racial laws issued by the <a href="Italian%20Fascism">fascist</a> regime in 1938 as "infamous", as also <a href="Giorgio%20Almirante">Giorgio Almirante</a>, historic leader of MSI, had done before. He also referred to the <a href="Italian%20Social%20Republic">Italian Social Republic</a> as belonging to the most shameful pages of the past, and considered fascism part of an era of "absolute evil", something which was hardly acceptable to the few remaining hardliners of the party. As a result, <a href="Alessandra%20Mussolini">Alessandra Mussolini</a>, the granddaughter of the former fascist dictator <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>, who had been at odds with the party on a number of issues for a long time, and some hardliners left the party and formed <a href="Social%20Action">Social Action</a>.

In occasion of the <a href="Italian%20general%20election%2C%202006">2006 general election</a>, AN ran within the House of Freedoms, with new allies. The centre-right lost by 24,000 votes in favour of the centre-left coalition <a href="The%20Union%20%28political%20coalition%29">The Union</a>. Individually AN received nearly 5 million votes, amounting to 12.3%. In July 2007 a group of splinters led by <a href="Francesco%20Storace">Francesco Storace</a> formed <a href="The%20Right%20%28Italy%29">The Right</a>, which was officially founded on 10 November. Seven MPs of AN, including <a href="Teodoro%20Buontempo">Teodoro Buontempo</a> and <a href="Daniela%20Santanch%C3%A8">Daniela Santanchè</a>, joined the new party.

In November 2007 <a href="Silvio%20Berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</a> announced that Forza Italia would have soon merged or transformed into <a href="The%20People%20of%20Freedom">The People of Freedom</a> (PdL) party.

After the sudden fall of the <a href="Prodi%20II%20Cabinet">second Prodi government</a> in January 2008, the breakup of <a href="The%20Union%20%28political%20coalition%29">The Union</a> and the subsequent political crisis which led to a fresh general election, Berlusconi hinted that Forza Italia would have probably contested its last election and the new party would have been officially founded only after that election. In an atmosphere of reconciliation with Gianfranco Fini, Berlusconi also stated that the new party could see the participation of other parties. Finally, on 8 February, Berlusconi and Fini agreed to form a joint list under the banner of the "People of Freedom", allied with Lega Nord. After the victory of the PdL in the <a href="Italian%20general%20election%2C%202008">2008 general election</a>, AN was merged into the PdL in early 2009.

National Alliance's political program emphasized:

Distinguishing itself from the MSI, the party distanced itself from <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> and <a href="Italian%20fascism">Fascism</a> and made efforts to improve relations with <a href="Jews">Jew</a>ish groups. With most hardliners leaving the party, it sought to present itself as a respectable <a href="conservatism">conservative</a> party and to join forces with <a href="Forza%20Italia">Forza Italia</a> in the <a href="European%20People%27s%20Party">European People's Party</a> and, eventually, in a united party of the centre-right.

Although the party approved the <a href="market%20economy">market economy</a> and held favourable views on <a href="liberalization">liberalization</a>s and the <a href="privatization">privatization</a> of <a href="public%20ownership">state industries</a>, however AN was to the left of Forza Italia on economic issues and sometimes supported <a href="statism">statist</a> policies. That is why the party was strong in <a href="Rome">Rome</a> and <a href="Lazio">Lazio</a>, where most civil servants live. Moreover, AN presented itself as a party promoting national cohesion, <a href="nation">national identity</a> and <a href="patriotism">patriotism</a>.

Regarding institutional reforms, the party was a long-time supporter of <a href="presidential%20democracy">presidentialism</a> and a <a href="plurality%20voting%20system">plurality voting system</a>, and came to support also <a href="federalism">federalism</a> and to fully accept the alliance with <a href="Lega%20Nord">Lega Nord</a>, although the relations with that party were tense at times, especially about issues regarding national unity.

<a href="Gianfranco%20Fini">Gianfranco Fini</a>, a moderniser who saw <a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> and <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a> as role-models, impressed an ambitious political line to the party, combining the pillars of conservative ideology like security, family values and patriotism with a progressive approach in other areas such as <a href="stem%20cell">stem cell</a> research and supporting voting rights for legal aliens. Some of these positions were not shared by many members of the party, most of whom staunchly opposed stem cell research and <a href="artificial%20insemination">artificial insemination</a>.

National Alliance was a heterogeneous political party and within it members were divided in different factions, some of them very organized:

In the party there was also a group named Ethic-Religious Council, whose board members included <a href="Gaetano%20Rebecchini">Gaetano Rebecchini</a> (founder, ex-DC), <a href="Riccardo%20Pedrizzi">Riccardo Pedrizzi</a> (president), <a href="Franco%20Tofoni">Franco Tofoni</a> (vice president), <a href="Luigi%20Gagliardi">Luigi Gagliardi</a> (secretary-general), <a href="Alfredo%20Mantovano">Alfredo Mantovano</a>, <a href="Antonio%20Mazzocchi">Antonio Mazzocchi</a> and <a href="Riccardo%20Migliori">Riccardo Migliori</a>. This was not a faction but an official organism within the party and expressed the official position of the party on ethical and religious matters. Sometimes the group criticized <a href="Gianfranco%20Fini">Gianfranco Fini</a> for his liberal views on abortion, artificial insemination and stem-cell research, which led some notable ex-DC members as <a href="Publio%20Fiori">Publio Fiori</a> to leave the party. Some members of the Council, such as Pedrizzi and Mantovano were described as members of an unofficial Catholic Right faction.

The party had roughly 10–15% support across Italy, having its strongholds in <a href="Central%20Italy">Central</a> and <a href="Southern%20Italy">Southern Italy</a> (<a href="Lazio">Lazio</a> 18.6%, <a href="Umbria">Umbria</a> 15.2%, <a href="Marche">Marche</a> 14.3%, <a href="Abruzzo">Abruzzo</a> 14.3%, <a href="Apulia">Apulia</a> 13.2%, <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a> 12.9%, <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a> 12.6% and <a href="Campania">Campania</a> 12.6% in the last <a href="Italian%20general%20election%2C%202006">general election</a>), scoring badly in <a href="Lombardy">Lombardy</a> (10.2%) and <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> (10.9%), while competing in the North-East (<a href="Friuli-Venezia%20Giulia">Friuli-Venezia Giulia</a> 15.5% and <a href="Veneto">Veneto</a> 11.3%).

The party had a good showing in the first general election to which it took part (13.5% in <a href="Italian%20general%20election%2C%201994">1994</a>) and reached 15.7% in <a href="Italian%20general%20election%2C%201996">1996</a>, when Fini tried for the first time to replace <a href="Silvio%20Berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</a> as leader of the centre-right. From that moment the party suffered an electoral decline, but remained the third force of Italian politics.

In the <a href="Italian%20general%20election%2C%202006">2006 general election</a>, the final election to which the party participated with its own list, AN won 12.3% of the vote, securing 71 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 41 in the Senate. In the <a href="Italian%20general%20election%2C%202008">2008 general election</a> the party got 90 deputies and 48 senators elected.

The electoral results of National Alliance in the 10 most populated <a href="regions%20of%20Italy">regions of Italy</a> are shown in the table below.

Arno

The Arno is a <a href="river">river</a> in the <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a> region of <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. It is the most important river of <a href="central%20Italy">central Italy</a> after the <a href="Tiber">Tiber</a>.

The river originates on <a href="Mount%20Falterona">Mount Falterona</a> in the <a href="Casentino">Casentino</a> area of the <a href="Apennine%20Mountains">Apennines</a>, and initially takes a southward curve. The river turns to the west near <a href="Arezzo">Arezzo</a> passing through <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, <a href="Empoli">Empoli</a> and <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a>, flowing into the <a href="Tyrrhenian%20Sea">Tyrrhenian Sea</a> at <a href="Marina%20di%20Pisa">Marina di Pisa</a>.

With a length of , it is the largest river in the region. It has many tributaries: <a href="Sieve%20%28river%29">Sieve</a> at long, <a href="Bisenzio%20%28river%29">Bisenzio</a> at , and the <a href="Era%20%28river%29">Era</a>, <a href="Elsa%20%28river%29">Elsa</a>, <a href="Pesa%20%28river%29">Pesa</a>, and <a href="Pescia%20%28River%29">Pescia</a>. The drainage basin amounts to more than and drains the waters of the following subbasins:


It crosses <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, where it passes below the <a href="Ponte%20Vecchio">Ponte Vecchio</a> and the <a href="Ponte%20Santa%20Trinita">Santa Trinita bridge</a> (built by <a href="Bartolomeo%20Ammanati">Bartolomeo Ammanati</a> but inspired by <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>).

The flow rate of the Arno is irregular. It is sometimes described as having a torrentlike behaviour, because it can easily go from almost dry to near flood in a few days. At the point where the Arno leaves the Apennines, flow measurements can vary between . New <a href="dam">dam</a>s built upstream of Florence have greatly alleviated the problem in recent years.

The <a href="1966%20flood%20of%20the%20Arno">flood on November 4, 1966</a>, collapsed the embankment in Florence, killing at least 40 people and damaging or destroying millions of works of art and rare books. New conservation techniques were inspired by the disaster, but even decades later hundreds of works still await restoration.

From Latin "Arnus" (Pliny, "Natural History" 3.50). The philologist <a href="Hans%20Krahe">Hans Krahe</a> related this toponym on a <a href="Old%20European%20hydronymy">paleo-European</a> basis "*Ar-n-", derived from the <a href="Proto-Indo-European">Proto-Indo-European</a> root *"er-", "flow, move".

Aveiro, Portugal

Aveiro ( or ) is a <a href="city">city</a> and a <a href="List%20of%20municipalities%20of%20Portugal">municipality</a> in Portugal. In 2011, the population was 78,450, in an area of : it is the second most populous city in the <a href="Centro%20Region%2C%20Portugal">Centro Region</a> of Portugal (after <a href="Coimbra">Coimbra</a>). Along with the neighbouring city of <a href="%C3%8Dlhavo">Ílhavo</a>, Aveiro is part of an urban agglomeration that includes 120,000 inhabitants, making it one of the most important populated regions by density in the Centro Region, and primary centre of the Intermunicipal Community of <a href="Regi%C3%A3o%20de%20Aveiro">Aveiro</a> and <a href="Baixo%20Vouga">Baixo Vouga</a>. Administratively, the president of the municipal government is José Ribau Esteves (elected by coalition between the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Portugal%29">Social Democratic Party</a> and the <a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28Portugal%29">Democratic Social Centre</a>, who governs the ten civil parishes ().

The presence of human settlement in the territory of Aveiro extends to the period associated with the great dolmens of pre-history, which exist in most of the region.

For a long period Aveiro was an important economic link in the production of salt and commercial shipping. It was a centre of salt exploration by the Romans and trade since 26 January 959 (from the testament of Countess Mumadona Dias to the "cenóbio" of Guimarães). During this testament, Mumadona Dias also highlighted the ancient name for Aveiro, referring to the monastery's lands in "Alauario et Salinas", literally, ""a gathering place or preserve of birds and of great salt"".

The <a href="Moors">Moors</a> invaded and then held it until the 11th century, after which it became popular with Portuguese royalty.

Later, King <a href="John%20I%20of%20Portugal">João I</a>, on the advice of his son <a href="Peter%2C%20Duke%20of%20Coimbra">Pedro</a>, who was the <a href="Donat%C3%A1rio">donatary</a> of Aveiro, requested the construction of fortification walls.

King <a href="Duarte%20de%20Portugal">D. Duarte</a> conceded in 1435 the privilege of providing an annual duty-free fair, later referred to as the "Feira de Março" ("March Fair"), today still an annual tradition.

The Princess <a href="Joan%20of%20Portugal%20%28nun%29">St. Joana</a>, daughter of <a href="Afonso%20V%20of%20Portugal">Afonso V</a> lived in Aveiro, entering the convent of Jesus, and lived there until her death on 12 May 1490. During her life her presence brought attention to the town, and favoured it with an elevated level of development for the time.

The first charter (<a href="foral">foral</a>) was conceded by <a href="Manuel%20I%20of%20Portugal">Manuel I of Portugal</a> on 4 August 1515, as indicated in the "Livro de Leituras Novas de Forais da Estremadura". Its geographic position along the Aveiro River had always helped it to subsist and grow, supported by salt market, fishing and maritime commercial development.
By the beginning of the 15th century, there already existed a great wall around the historical centre, intonating the significance of the community and growth of the population. This included the founding of many religious institutions and their supports, which assisted during the 17th and 18th century crises associated with silt in the waterway. In the winter of 1575, a terrible storm closed the entrance to its port, ending a thriving trade in <a href="metal">metal</a>s and <a href="tile">tile</a>s, and creating a reef barrier at the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>. The walls were subsequently demolished and used to create the docks around the new sand bar.

Between the 16th and 17th centuries, the river's instability at the mouth (between the Ria and open ocean) resulted in the closure of the canal, impeding the use of the port of Aveiro, and creating stagnation in the waters of the lagoon. This blow to the economy created a social and economic crisis, and resulted in the decrease in the population and emigration. It was at this time that the Church of the Miserícordia was constructed, during the Philippine Dynastic union.

In 1759, King <a href="Joseph%20I%20of%20Portugal">José I</a> elevated the town to the status of city, a few months after condemning the Duke of Aveiro (a title established in 1547 by <a href="John%20III%20of%20Portugal">João III</a>), José Mascarenhas, to death. As a result, Aveiro became known as Nova Bragança: it was later abandoned much later, and returned to Aveiro. In 1774, by request of King José, <a href="Pope%20Clement%20XIV">Pope Clement XIV</a> instituted the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Aveiro">Diocese of Aveiro</a>.

In the 19th century, the Aveirense were active during the <a href="Liberal%20Wars">Liberal Wars</a>, and it was José Estêvão Coelho de Magalhães, a parliamentary member who was determinant in resolving the problem of access along the Ria, and development of transport, especially the railway line between Lisbon and Porto. It was the opening of the artificial canals, completed in 1808, that allowed Aveiro to expand economically, marking the beginning in the town's growth.

The municipality was elevated to the status of town, centered on the its principal church, consecrated to the Archangel Michael, today the location of the "Praça da República" (having been demolished in 1835).

Located on the shore of the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, Aveiro is an industrial city with an important <a href="seaport">seaport</a>.

The seat of the municipality is the city of Aveiro, comprising the five urban parishes with about 73,003 inhabitants. The city of Aveiro is also the capital of the District of <a href="Aveiro%20%28district%29">Aveiro</a>, and the largest city in the <a href="Baixo%20Vouga">Baixo Vouga</a> intermunicipal community subregion.

Aveiro is known as "The Portuguese <a href="Venice">Venice</a>", due to its system of canals and boats similar to the Italian city of Venice. The people's quality of life is very high.

Aveiro has a warm-summer <a href="mediterranean%20climate">mediterranean climate</a> influenced by its proximity to the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>. The maritime influence causes a narrow temperature range resulting in summers averaging around in daytime temperatures, considerably lower than inland areas on the same parallel on the Iberian Peninsula. As typical of mediterranean climates, summers are dry and winters are wet. A coastal feature is that frosts are rare and never severe. The hottest temperature recorded was set in July. Temperatures above are extremely occasional, and averages only a couple of times per annum.
Administratively, the municipality is divided into 10 civil parishes ():

São Jacinto is located on an eponymous peninsula, between the Atlantic Ocean and <a href="Ria%20de%20Aveiro">Ria de Aveiro</a>. Aveiro had 61,430 eligible voters in 2006.

Aveiro's <a href="town%20twinning">sister cities</a> are:

Aveiro is known for its production of <a href="salt">salt</a> and for its <a href="seaweed">seaweed</a> harvest, which is used for fertilizer in the area.

The region is also known for the preponderance of ceramics industries and commerce, a reflection of the regions advancements, resulting in a long productive tradition since the late Roman, early Medieval period (reflected in the ceramics kilns).

The city of Aveiro has several shopping centers and malls (Pingo Doce Shopping Center, Fórum Aveiro, Glicínias Plaza (Jumbo – Auchan), Aveiro's Shopping Center (Continente & Mediamarkt), Aveiro's Retail Park and the Oita Shopping Center). This city has lots of traditional commerce stores. The most central one being Forum Aveiro with clothes stores, restaurant zone, a book shop and a cinema.

The unemployment rate is very low (about 5%), sustained by a university and commerce.

The local economy is fed by a series of transport networks that cross the municipal boundaries. Regional gateways include air service through the Aeródromo de Aveiro/São Jacinto (LPAV) and the Porto de Aveiro (Ílhavo/Aveiro). Rail service includes service by <a href="Alfa%20Pendular">Alfa Pendular</a> (between Lisbon and Braga; Lisbon and Oporto; Faro and Oporto) and Intercity (between Lisbon and Oporto as well as Lisbon and Guimarães) trains; suburban links through the Urbanos do Porto and, also, the <a href="Linha%20do%20Vouga">Linha do Vouga</a>, a narrow gauge railway to Águeda and <a href="Sernada%20do%20Vouga">Sernada do Vouga</a>.

The primary expressways and inter-regional thoroughfares include: <a href="A1%20motorway%20%28Portugal%29">A1</a> (between Porto and Lisbon); and the <a href="A25%20motorway%20%28Portugal%29">A25</a> (which links <a href="Viseu">Viseu</a>, <a href="Guarda%2C%20Portugal">Guarda</a> and <a href="Vilar%20Formoso">Vilar Formoso</a>).

"Moliceiros" provide access along the Ria for tourist visits, in addition to traditional fishing or recreational purposes, including regattas.

The architecture of Aveiro is influenced by two phases: the pre-Kingdom era, with a number of historical monuments; and the modernist movements resulting from the expansion of economy during the 19th-20th centuries.

The city's primary landmark is the 15th century Monastery of Jesus (), containing the tomb of King <a href="Afonso%20V%20of%20Portugal">Afonso V</a>'s daughter, <a href="Joan%20of%20Portugal%20%28nun%29">St. Joana</a> (who died in 1490). The presence of this royal personage, beatified in 1693, proved to be of great benefit when she bequeathed her valuable estate to the convent. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the convent housed a school of embroidery, but was transformed into the "Museu de Santa Joana", or simply, the Museum of Aveiro, housing many of these handicrafts.

The abundance of 19th-20th century architectural buildings reflects the effects of the boom during that period, including many of the Art Novo and Art Deco buildings, inspired by modernist trends and Nationalist tendencies of the Estado Novo regime. The best of these in the university campus, where many the nationalist architects were involved in construction projects.

There are several attractions in the city of Aveiro, including cathedrals, canals and the beache, including the "Ílhavo ceramica de Vista Alegre" and the beaches of Barra, Costa Nova do Prado, and <a href="Gafanha%20da%20Nazar%C3%A9">Gafanha da Nazaré</a>.

Aveiro is known in Portugal for its traditional sweets, "<a href="Ovos%20Moles%20de%20Aveiro">Ovos Moles de Aveiro</a>" (<a href="Protected%20Geographical%20Indication">PGI</a>), "trouxas de ovos", both made from eggs. "Raivas" are also a typical biscuit of Aveiro.

The municipal holiday is 12 May, the day of <a href="Joanna%2C%20Princess%20of%20Portugal">Joanna, Princess of Portugal</a>.

The <a href="Universidade%20de%20Aveiro">University of Aveiro</a> was created in 1973 and is considered one of the most dynamic and innovative universities of Portugal, attracting thousands of students to the city. It is one of the best in Portugal and 354th best university in the World.

The University has about 430 professors (with Ph.D. degrees), 11,000 undergraduate students, and 1,300 post-graduate students.

Founded in 1922, it has a sports academy with various youth levels participating in all kinds of sports codes notably in Basketball and Futsal in both National and Provincial levels. The club used to play at <a href="Est%C3%A1dio%20Municipal%20de%20Aveiro">Estádio Municipal de Aveiro</a>, designed by Portuguese architect <a href="Tom%C3%A1s%20Taveira">Tomás Taveira</a> for <a href="Euro%202004">Euro 2004</a>, where it held two group matches.

The biography of Anthony's life by <a href="Athanasius%20of%20Alexandria">Athanasius of Alexandria</a> helped to spread the concept of Christian <a href="monasticism">monasticism</a>, particularly in Western Europe via its <a href="Latin">Latin</a> translations. He is often erroneously considered the first Christian monk, but as his biography and other sources make clear, there were many ascetics before him. Anthony was, however, the first to go into the wilderness (about  270), a geographical move that seems to have contributed to his renown. Accounts of Anthony enduring supernatural temptation during his sojourn in the <a href="Eastern%20Desert">Eastern Desert</a> of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> inspired the often-repeated subject of <a href="The%20temptation%20of%20St.%20Anthony%20in%20visual%20arts">the temptation of St. Anthony</a> in Western art and literature.

Anthony is appealed to against infectious diseases, particularly skin diseases. In the past, many such afflictions, including <a href="ergotism">ergotism</a>, <a href="erysipelas">erysipelas</a>, and <a href="Herpes%20zoster">shingles</a>, were referred to as "St. Anthony's fire".

Anthony was born in <a href="Coma%2C%20Egypt">Coma</a> in <a href="Lower%20Egypt">Lower Egypt</a> in  251 to wealthy landowner parents. When he was about 18 years old, his parents died and left him with the care of his unmarried sister. Shortly thereafter, he decided to follow the <a href="Evangelical%20counsels">Evangelical counsel</a> of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> which reads, "If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasures in heaven." Anthony gave away some of his family's lands to his neighbors, sold the remaining property, and donated the funds thus raised to the poor. He then left to live an <a href="asceticism">ascetic</a> life, placing his sister with a group of <a href="Consecrated%20virgin">Christian virgins</a>, a sort of proto-convent.

For the next fifteen years, Anthony remained in the area, spending the first years as the disciple of another local <a href="hermit">hermit</a>. There are various legends associating Anthony with pigs: one is that he worked as a <a href="swineherd">swineherd</a> during this period.

Anthony is sometimes considered the first monk, and the first to initiate solitary desertification, but there were others before him. There were already <a href="asceticism">ascetic</a> <a href="ancient%20Greek%20religion">pagan</a> <a href="hermit">hermit</a>s (the "<a href="Therapeutae">Therapeutae</a>") and loosely organized <a href="cenobitic">cenobitic</a> communities were described by the <a href="Hellenization">Hellenized</a> <a href="Judaism">Jewish</a> <a href="Jewish%20philosophy">philosopher</a> <a href="Philo%20of%20Alexandria">Philo of Alexandria</a> in the 1st century  as long established in the harsh environment of <a href="Lake%20Mareotis">Lake Mareotis</a> and in other less accessible regions. Philo opined that "this class of persons may be met with in many places, for both Greece and barbarian countries want to enjoy whatever is perfectly good." Christian ascetics such as <a href="Thecla">Thecla</a> had likewise retreated to isolated locations at the outskirts of cities. Anthony is notable for having decided to surpass this tradition and headed out into the desert proper. He left for the alkaline <a href="Nitrian%20Desert">Nitrian Desert</a> (later the location of the noted monasteries of <a href="Nitria%20%28monastic%20site%29">Nitria</a>, <a href="Kellia">Kellia</a>, and <a href="Scetis">Scetis</a>) on the edge of the <a href="Libyan%20Desert">Western Desert</a> about west of <a href="Early%20centers%20of%20Christianity%23Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. He remained there for 13 years.

According to <a href="Athanasius">Athanasius</a>, the devil fought Anthony by afflicting him with boredom, laziness, and the phantoms of women, which he overcame by the power of prayer, providing a theme for <a href="Christian%20art">Christian art</a>. After that, he moved to a tomb, where he resided and closed the door on himself, depending on some local villagers who brought him food. When the devil perceived his ascetic life and his intense worship, he was envious and beat him mercilessly, leaving him unconscious. When his friends from the local village came to visit him and found him in this condition, they carried him to a church.

After he recovered, he made a second effort and went back into the desert to a farther mountain by the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> called Pispir (now Der-el-Memun), opposite <a href="Faiyum">Arsinoe</a>. There he lived strictly enclosed in an old abandoned <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> fort for some 20 years. According to <a href="Athanasius">Athanasius</a>, the devil again resumed his war against Anthony, only this time the phantoms were in the form of wild beasts, wolves, lions, snakes, and scorpions. They appeared as if they were about to attack him or cut him into pieces. But the saint would laugh at them scornfully and say, "If any of you have any authority over me, only one would have been sufficient to fight me." At his saying this, they disappeared as though in smoke. While in the fort he only communicated with the outside world by a crevice through which food would be passed and he would say a few words. Anthony would prepare a quantity of bread that would sustain him for six months. He did not allow anyone to enter his cell; whoever came to him stood outside and listened to his advice.

Then one day he emerged from the fort with the help of villagers, who broke down the door. By this time most had expected him to have wasted away or to have gone insane in his solitary confinement. Instead, he emerged healthy, serene, and enlightened. Everyone was amazed that he had been through these trials and emerged spiritually rejuvenated. He was hailed as a hero and from this time forth the legend of Anthony began to spread and grow. Anthony went to <a href="Al%20Fayyum">Fayyum</a> and confirmed the brethren there in the <a href="Christian">Christian</a> faith before returning to his fort.

Amid the <a href="Diocletian%20Persecutions">Diocletian Persecutions</a>, Anthony wished to become a <a href="martyr">martyr</a> and in 311 went to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. He visited those who were imprisoned for the sake of <a href="Christ">Christ</a> and comforted them. When the Governor saw that he was confessing his <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> publicly, not caring what might happen to him, he ordered him not to show up in the city. However, the Saint did not heed his threats. He faced him and argued with him in order that he might arouse his anger so that he might be tortured and martyred, but it did not happen.

At the end of the persecutions, Anthony returned to his old Roman fort. By this time, many more had heard of his sanctity and he had many more visitors than before. He saw these visits as interfering with his worship and went further into the <a href="Eastern%20Desert">Eastern Desert</a>. He traveled for three days before reaching a small oasis with a spring and some <a href="palm%20tree">palm tree</a>s and chose to settle there. Disciples soon found him out and his number of visitors again continued to grow.

Anthony had not been the first ascetic or hermit, but he may properly be called the "Father of Monasticism" in Christianity, as he organized his disciples into a worshipful community and inspired similar withdrawn communities throughout Egypt and, following the spread of Athanasius's hagiography, the Greek and Roman world. His follower <a href="Macarius%20the%20Great">Macarius the Great</a> was particularly active in continuing his legacy.

Anthony anticipated the <a href="Order%20of%20St%20Benedict">rule</a> of <a href="Benedict%20of%20Nursia">Benedict</a> by about 200 years, engaging himself and his disciples in manual labor. Anthony himself cultivated a garden and wove <a href="juncus">rush</a> mats. He and his disciples were regularly sought for words of enlightenment. These statements were later collected into the book of "<a href="Sayings%20of%20the%20Desert%20Fathers">Sayings of the Desert Fathers</a>". Anthony himself is said to have spoken to those of a spiritual disposition personally, leaving the task of addressing the more worldly visitors to <a href="Macarius%20the%20Great">Macarius</a>. On occasions, he would go to the monastery on the outskirts of the desert by the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> to visit the brethren, then return to his inner <a href="monastery">monastery</a>.

The backstory of one of the surviving epistles, directed to <a href="Constantine%20I%20%28emperor%29">Constantine I</a>, recounts how the fame of Saint Anthony spread abroad and reached Emperor Constantine. The Emperor wrote to him offering praise and requesting prayers. The brethren were pleased with the Emperor's letter, but Anthony did not pay any attention to it, and he said to them, "The books of God, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, commands us every day, but we do not heed what they tell us, and we turn our backs on them." Under the persistence of the brethren who told him "Emperor Constantine loves the church", he accepted to write him a letter blessing him, and praying for the peace and safety of the empire and the church.

According to Athanasius, Saint Anthony heard a voice telling him "Go out and see." He went out and saw an <a href="angel">angel</a> who wore a girdle with a cross, one resembling the holy Eskiem (<a href="Tonsure">Tonsure</a> or <a href="Schema%20%28Orthodoxy%29">Schema</a>), and on his head was a head cover (Kolansowa). He was sitting while braiding palm leaves, then he stood up to pray, and again he sat to weave. A voice came to him saying, "Anthony, do this and you will rest." Henceforth, he started to wear this tunic that he saw, and began to weave palm leaves, and never was bored again. Saint Anthony prophesied about the persecution that was about to happen to the church and the control of the heretics over it, the church victory and its return to its former glory, and the end of the age. When <a href="Macarius%20the%20Great">Saint Macarius</a> visited Saint Anthony, Saint Anthony clothed him with the monk's garb, and foretold him what would be of him. When the day drew near of the departure of <a href="Paul%20of%20Thebes">Saint Paul the First Hermit</a> in the desert, Saint Anthony went to him and buried him, after clothing him in a tunic which was a present from <a href="Athanasius%20of%20Alexandria">St Athanasius the Apostolic</a>, the 20th <a href="List%20of%20Patriarchs%20of%20Alexandria">Patriarch of Alexandria</a>.

In 338, he left the desert temporarily to visit Alexandria to help refute the teachings of <a href="Arius">Arius</a>. Although not particularly learned, Anthony was able to confound the Arians.

When Saint Anthony felt that the day of his departure had approached, he commanded his disciples to give his staff to <a href="Macarius%20of%20Egypt">Saint Macarius</a>, and to give one <a href="Sheepskin%20%28material%29">sheepskin</a> cloak to <a href="Saint%20Athanasius">Saint Athanasius</a> and the other sheepskin cloak to <a href="Saint%20Serapion%20of%20Thmuis">Saint Serapion</a>, his disciple. He further instructed his disciples to bury his body in an unmarked, secret <a href="Grave%20%28burial%29">grave</a>.

He probably spoke only his native language, <a href="Coptic%20language">Coptic</a>, but his sayings were spread in a <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> translation. He himself left no writings. His biography was written by <a href="Saint%20Athanasius">Saint Athanasius</a> and titled "Life of Saint Anthony the Great". Many stories are also told about him in various collections of sayings of the <a href="Desert%20Fathers">Desert Fathers</a>.

Though Anthony himself did not organize or create a monastery, a community grew around him based on his example of living an <a href="asceticism">ascetic</a> and isolated life. Athanasius' biography helped propagate Anthony's ideals. Athanasius writes, "For monks, the life of Anthony is a sufficient example of <a href="asceticism">asceticism</a>." Asceticism is a lifestyle characterized by abstinence from worldly pleasures, often for the purpose of pursuing spiritual goals.

The biography of Anthony's life by Athanasius of Alexandria helped to spread the concept of Christian monasticism, particularly in Western Europe via its Latin translations. He is often erroneously considered the first Christian monk, but as his biography and other sources make clear, there were many ascetics before him. Anthony was, however, the first to go into the wilderness (about ad 270), a geographical move that seems to have contributed to his renown.[6] Accounts of Anthony enduring supernatural temptation during his sojourn in the Eastern Desert of Egypt inspired the often-repeated subject of the temptation of St. Anthony in Western art and literature.

Anthony is appealed to against infectious diseases, particularly skin diseases. In the past, many such afflictions, including ergotism, erysipelas, and shingles, were referred to as St. Anthony's fire.

Famously, Anthony is said to have faced a series of supernatural <a href="temptation">temptation</a>s during his pilgrimage to the desert. The first to report on the temptation was his contemporary <a href="Athanasius%20of%20Alexandria">Athanasius of Alexandria</a>. It is possible these events, like the paintings, are full of rich metaphor or in the case of the animals of the desert, perhaps a vision or dream. Some of the stories included in Saint Anthony's biography are perpetuated now mostly in paintings, where they give an opportunity for artists to depict their more lurid or bizarre interpretations. Many artists, including <a href="Martin%20Schongauer">Martin Schongauer</a>, <a href="Hieronymus%20Bosch">Hieronymus Bosch</a>, <a href="Dorothea%20Tanning">Dorothea Tanning</a>, <a href="Max%20Ernst">Max Ernst</a>, <a href="Leonora%20Carrington">Leonora Carrington</a> and <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a>, have depicted these incidents from the life of Anthony; in prose, the tale was retold and embellished by <a href="Gustave%20Flaubert">Gustave Flaubert</a> in "<a href="The%20Temptation%20of%20Saint%20Anthony%20%28Flaubert%29">The Temptation of Saint Anthony</a>".

Emphasis on these stories, however, did not really begin until the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, when the psychology of the individual became of greater interest. Below are some of these controversial tales.

Saint Anthony was on a journey in the desert to find <a href="Paul%20of%20Thebes">Saint Paul of Thebes</a>, who according to his dream was a better Hermit than he. Saint Anthony had been under the impression that he was the first person to ever dwell in the desert; however, due to the dream, Saint Anthony was called into the desert to find his "better", Saint Paul. On his way there, he ran into two <a href="demon">demon</a>s in the forms of a <a href="centaur">centaur</a> and a <a href="satyr">satyr</a>, which Western theology considers to have been temptations.

At any rate, he was stopped by the two demons and he asked them, "Who are you?" To that the satyr replied, "I am a corpse, one of those whom the heathen call satyrs, and by whom they are snared into idolatry." The satyr then tried to terrify the saint while the centaur acknowledged the overthrow of the gods. In the end, the centaur tried to show Saint Anthony the way to his destination while the satyr ended up asking for Saint Anthony's blessing.

Another time Saint Anthony was travelling in the desert, he found a plate of silver coins in his path. He pondered for a moment as to why a plate of silver coins would be out in the desert where no one else travels, and realised the Devil must have laid it out there to tempt him. Anthony continued walking along and saw a pile of gold in his way which the Devil had laid there to deceive him, but he ignored them and continued on his way.

Once, Saint Anthony tried hiding in a cave to escape the demons that plagued him. There were so many little demons in the cave though that Saint Anthony's servant had to carry him out because they had beaten him to death. When the hermits were gathered to Saint Anthony's corpse to mourn his death, Saint Anthony was revived. He demanded that his servants take him back to that cave where the demons had beaten him. When he got there he called out to the demons, and they came back as wild beasts to rip him to shreds. All of a sudden a bright light flashed, and the demons ran away. Saint Anthony knew that the light must have come from God, and he asked God where was he before when the demons attacked him. God replied, "I was here but I would see and abide to see thy battle, and because thou hast mainly fought and well maintained thy battle, I shall make thy name to be spread through all the world."

Most of what is known about Saint Anthony comes from the "Life of Anthony". Written in Greek around 360 by <a href="Athanasius%20of%20Alexandria">Athanasius of Alexandria</a>, it depicts Anthony as an illiterate and holy man who through his existence in a primordial landscape has an absolute connection to the divine truth, which always is in harmony with that of Athanasius as the biographer. Sometime before 374, it was translated into Latin by <a href="Evagrius%20of%20Antioch">Evagrius of Antioch</a>. The Latin translation helped the "Life" become one of the best known works of literature in the Christian world, a status it would hold through the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. In addition to the "Life", several surviving homilies and epistles of varying authenticity provide some additional autobiographical detail.
Anthony had been secretly buried on the mountain-top where he had chosen to live. His remains were reportedly discovered in 361, and transferred to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>. Some time later, they were taken from Alexandria to <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, so that they might escape the destruction being perpetrated by invading <a href="Saracen">Saracen</a>s. In the eleventh century, the <a href="Byzantine%20emperor">Byzantine emperor</a> gave them to the <a href="French%20people">French</a> <a href="Count">Count</a> Jocelin. Jocelin had them transferred to La-Motte-Saint-Didier, which was then renamed <a href="Saint-Antoine-en-Dauphin%C3%A9">Saint-Antoine-en-Dauphiné</a>. There, Anthony is credited with assisting in a number of miraculous healings, primarily from <a href="ergotism">ergotism</a>, which became known as "St. Anthony's Fire". He was credited by two local noblemen of assisting them in recovery from the disease. They then founded the <a href="Hospital%20Brothers%20of%20St.%20Anthony">Hospital Brothers of St. Anthony</a> in honor of him, who specialized in nursing the victims of skin diseases.

Veneration of Anthony in the East is more restrained. There are comparatively few icons and paintings of him. He is regarded as the "first master of the desert and the pinnacle of holy monks", however, and there are monastic communities of the Maronite, Chaldean, and Orthodox churches which state that they follow his monastic rule. During the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, Anthony, along with <a href="Quirinus%20of%20Neuss">Quirinus of Neuss</a>, <a href="Pope%20Cornelius">Cornelius</a> and <a href="Hubertus">Hubertus</a>, was venerated as one of the <a href="Four%20Holy%20Marshals">Four Holy Marshals</a> ("Vier Marschälle Gottes") in the <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a>.

Examples of purely <a href="Coptic%20literature">Coptic literature</a> are the works of Saint Anthony and Saint <a href="Pachomius">Pachomius</a>, who only spoke Coptic, and the sermons and preachings of <a href="Saint%20Shenouda%20the%20Archmandrite">Saint Shenouda the Archmandrite</a>, who chose to only write in Coptic. Saint Shenouda was a popular leader who only spoke to Egyptians in the <a href="Egyptian%20language">Egyptian language</a> (<a href="Coptic%20language">Coptic</a>), not in Greek.

The earliest original writings in <a href="Coptic%20language">Coptic language</a> were the letters by Saint Anthony. During the 3rd and 4th centuries many ecclesiastics and monks wrote in Coptic.

The main character in the <a href="Hervey%20Allen">Hervey Allen</a> novel "<a href="Anthony%20Adverse">Anthony Adverse</a>", and the 1936 film of the same name, is an abandoned child who is placed in a <a href="foundling%20wheel">foundling wheel</a> on the saint's feast day, and given the name Anthony in his honor.

Amblypoda

Amblypoda is a taxonomic hypothesis uniting a group of extinct, herbivorous <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s. They were considered a suborder of the primitive <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a> mammals and have since been shown to represent a <a href="polyphyletic">polyphyletic</a> group.

The Amblypoda take their name from their short and stumpy feet, which were furnished with five toes each and supported massive pillar-like limbs. The brain cavity was extremely small and insignificant in comparison to the bodily mass, which was equal to that of the largest <a href="rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a>es. These animals were descendants of the small ancestral ungulates that retained all the primitive characteristics of the latter, accompanied by a huge increase in body size.

The Amblypoda were confined to the <a href="Paleocene">Paleocene</a> and <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> periods and occurred in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, <a href="Asia">Asia</a> (especially <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>) and <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. The cheek teeth were short-crowned (<a href="brachyodont">brachyodont</a>), with the tubercles more-or-less completely fused into transverse ridges, or cross-crests (<a href="lophodont">lophodont</a> type), and the total number of teeth was in one case the typical 44, but in another was fewer. The <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a> of the neck unite on nearly flat surfaces, the <a href="humerus">humerus</a> had lost the foramen, or perforation, at the lower end, and the third trochanter to the <a href="femur">femur</a> may have also been wanting. In the forelimb, the upper and lower series of <a href="carpal">carpal</a> (finger) bones scarcely alternated, but in the hind foot, the astragalus overlapped the cuboid, while the <a href="fibula">fibula</a>, which was quite distinct from the <a href="tibia">tibia</a> (as was the <a href="radius%20%28bone%29">radius</a> from the <a href="ulna">ulna</a> in the forelimb), articulated with both astragalus and calcaneum.

The most generalized type was "<a href="Coryphodon">Coryphodon</a>", representing the family <a href="Coryphodontidae">Coryphodontidae</a>, from the lower Eocene of Europe and North America, in which there were 44 teeth and no horn-like excrescences on the long skull, while the femur had a third trochanter. The canines were somewhat elongated and were followed by a short gap in each jaw, and the cheek-teeth were adapted for succulent food. The length of the body reached about six feet in some cases.

In the middle Eocene formations of North America occurred the more specialized "<a href="Uintatherium">Uintatherium</a>" (or "Dinoceras"), typifying the family <a href="Uintatheriidae">Uintatheriidae</a>. Uintatheres were huge creatures with long narrow skulls, of which the elongated facial portion carried three pairs of bony horn-cores, probably covered with short horns in life, the hind-pair having been much the largest. The dental formula was i. 0/3, c. 1/1, p. 3/3·4, m. 3/3, the upper canines having been long sabre-like weapons, protected by a descending flange on each side of the lower front jaw.

In the basal Eocene of North America, the Amblypoda were represented by extremely primitive, five-toed, small ungulates such as "<a href="Periptychus">Periptychus</a>" and "<a href="Pantolambda">Pantolambda</a>", each of these typifying a family. The full typical series of 44 teeth was developed in each, but whereas in the <a href="Periptychidae">Periptychidae</a>, the upper molars were <a href="bunodont">bunodont</a> and <a href="tritubercular">tritubercular</a>, in the <a href="Pantolambdidae">Pantolambdidae</a>, they had assumed a <a href="selenodont">selenodont</a> structure. <a href="Creodonta">Creodont</a> characters were displayed in the skeleton.

Few authorities recognize Amblypoda in modern classifications. The following mammals were once considered part of this group:

<doc id="3251" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3251" title="Amblygonite">
Amblygonite

Amblygonite is a fluorophosphate mineral, (Li,Na)AlPO(F,OH), composed of <a href="lithium">lithium</a>, <a href="sodium">sodium</a>, <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a>, <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a> and <a href="hydroxide">hydroxide</a>. The mineral occurs in <a href="pegmatite">pegmatite</a> deposits and is easily mistaken for <a href="albite">albite</a> and other <a href="feldspar">feldspar</a>s. Its density, cleavage and flame test for lithium are diagnostic. Amblygonite forms a series with "montebrasite", the low fluorine endmember. Geologic occurrence is in <a href="granite">granite</a> pegmatites, high-temperature <a href="tin">tin</a> veins, and <a href="greisen">greisen</a>s. Amblygonite occurs with <a href="spodumene">spodumene</a>, <a href="apatite">apatite</a>, <a href="lepidolite">lepidolite</a>, <a href="tourmaline">tourmaline</a>, and other lithium-bearing minerals in pegmatite veins. It contains about 10% lithium, and has been utilized as a source of lithium. The chief commercial sources have historically been the deposits of California and France.

The mineral was first discovered in <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a> by <a href="August%20Breithaupt">August Breithaupt</a> in 1817, and named by him from the Greek "amblus", blunt, and "gonia", angle, because of the obtuse angle between the cleavages. Later it was found at Montebras, Creuse, <a href="France">France</a>, and at Hebron in <a href="Maine">Maine</a>; and because of slight differences in optical character and chemical composition the names montebrasite and hebronite have been applied to the mineral from these localities. It has been discovered in considerable quantity at Pala in San Diego county, <a href="California">California</a>; Caceres, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>; and the <a href="Black%20Hills">Black Hills</a> of <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a>. The largest documented single crystal of amblygonite measured 7.62×2.44×1.83 m and weighed ~102 tons.

Transparent amblygonite has been faceted and used as a gemstone. As a gemstone set into jewelry it is vulnerable to breakage and abrasion from general wear, as its hardness and toughness are poor. The main sources for gem material are Brazil and the United States. Australia, France, Germany, Namibia, Norway, and Spain have also produced gem quality amblygonite.

<doc id="3252" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3252" title="Amygdalin">
Amygdalin

Amygdalin (from <a href="Greek%20language">Ancient Greek</a>: "" "almond") is a naturally occurring <a href="chemical%20compound">chemical compound</a>, famous for falsely being promoted as a cancer cure. It is found in many plants, but most notably in the seeds (kernels) of <a href="apricot">apricot</a>, <a href="bitter%20almonds">bitter almonds</a>, <a href="apple">apple</a>, <a href="peach">peach</a>, and <a href="plum">plum</a>.

Amygdalin is classified as a <a href="cyanogenic%20glycoside">cyanogenic glycoside</a> because each amygdalin molecule includes a <a href="nitrile">nitrile</a> group, which can be released as the toxic <a href="cyanide">cyanide</a> anion by the action of a beta-glucosidase: when eaten by people amygdalin releases the cyanide which poisons them. Neither amygdalin nor laetrile is a <a href="vitamin">vitamin</a>.

Since the early 1950s, both amygdalin and a modified form named laetrile have been promoted as <a href="alternative%20cancer%20treatments">alternative cancer treatments</a>, often using the misnomer vitamin B. But studies have found them to be clinically ineffective in the treatment of cancer, as well as potentially toxic or lethal when taken by mouth, due to <a href="cyanide%20poisoning">cyanide poisoning</a>. The promotion of laetrile to treat cancer has been described in the medical literature as a canonical example of <a href="quackery">quackery</a>, and as "the slickest, most sophisticated, and certainly the most <a href="Profit%20%28accounting%29">remunerative</a> cancer quack promotion in medical history".

Amygdalin is a <a href="cyanogenic%20glycoside">cyanogenic glycoside</a> derived from the aromatic amino acid <a href="phenylalanine">phenylalanine</a>. Amygdalin and <a href="prunasin">prunasin</a> are very common among plants of the <a href="Rosaceae">Rosaceae</a> family, particularly the genus "<a href="Prunus">Prunus</a>", <a href="Poaceae">Poaceae</a> (grasses), <a href="Fabaceae">Fabaceae</a> (legumes), and in other food plants, including <a href="linseed">linseed</a> and <a href="manioc">manioc</a>. Within these plants, amygdalin and the enzymes necessary to hydrolyze them are stored in separate locations so that they will mix in response to tissue damage. This provides a natural defense system.

Amygdalin is contained in <a href="drupe">stone fruit</a> kernels, such as <a href="apricot">apricot</a> (8%), <a href="peach">peach</a> (6%), <a href="bitter%20almond">bitter almond</a> (5%), and <a href="plum">plum</a> (2.5%); amygdalin is also found in the seeds of the <a href="apple">apple</a>. The stones are taken out of the fruit and cracked to obtain the kernels, which are dried in the sun or in ovens. The kernels are boiled in <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a>; on evaporation of the solution and the addition of <a href="diethyl%20ether">diethyl ether</a>, amygdalin is precipitated as white minute crystals. Natural amygdalin has the ("R")-configuration at the chiral phenyl center. Under mild basic conditions, this stereogenic center isomerizes; the ("S")-epimer is called neoamygdalin. Although the synthesized version of amygdalin is the ("R")-epimer, the stereogenic center attached to the nitrile and phenyl groups easily epimerizes if the manufacturer does not store the compound correctly.

Amygdalin is <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolyzed</a> by intestinal <a href="%CE%B2-glucosidase">β-glucosidase</a> (emulsin) and <a href="Amygdalin%20beta-glucosidase">amygdalase</a> to give <a href="gentiobiose">gentiobiose</a> and -<a href="mandelonitrile">mandelonitrile</a>. Gentiobiose is further hydrolyzed to give <a href="glucose">glucose</a>, whereas the <a href="cyanohydrin">cyanohydrin</a> of mandelonitrile decomposes to give <a href="benzaldehyde">benzaldehyde</a> and <a href="hydrogen%20cyanide">hydrogen cyanide</a>. Hydrogen cyanide in sufficient quantities (<a href="Acceptable%20daily%20intake">allowable daily intake</a>: ~0.6 mg) causes <a href="cyanide%20poisoning">cyanide poisoning</a> (fatal oral dose: 0.6–1.5 mg/kg). Apricot pits contain 89–2,170 mg/kg <a href="hydrogen%20cyanide">hydrogen cyanide</a> (wet weight).

Laetrile (patented 1961) is a simpler semisynthetic version of amygdalin. Laetrile is synthesized from amygdalin by hydrolysis. The usual preferred commercial source is from apricot kernels (<a href="Prunus%20armeniaca">Prunus armeniaca</a>). The name is derived from the separate words "laevarotatory" and "mandelonitrile". Laevarotatory describes the stereochemistry of the molecule, while mandelonitrile refers to its chemical identity

A 500 mg laetrile tablet may contain between 5–51 mg of hydrogen cyanide per gram.

Like amygdalin, laetrile is hydrolyzed in the duodenum (alkaline) and in the intestine (enzymatically) to D-<a href="glucuronic%20acid">glucuronic acid</a> and L-<a href="mandelonitrile">mandelonitrile</a>; the latter hydrolyzes to <a href="benzaldehyde">benzaldehyde</a> and <a href="hydrogen%20cyanide">hydrogen cyanide</a>, that in sufficient quantities causes <a href="cyanide%20poisoning">cyanide poisoning</a>. Intravenous laetrile does not result in cyanide exposure. This is due to the fact that the necessary enzymes are released either upon chewing the plant material or are provided by bacteria residing in the human gastrointestinal system.

Claims for laetrile were based on three different hypotheses:

<a href="Ernst%20T.%20Krebs">Ernst T. Krebs</a> branded laetrile as a vitamin in order to have it classified as a <a href="nutritional%20supplement">nutritional supplement</a> rather than as a pharmaceutical.

Amygdalin was first isolated in 1830 from <a href="bitter%20almond">bitter almond</a> seeds (<a href="Prunus%20dulcis">Prunus dulcis</a>) by <a href="Pierre-Jean%20Robiquet">Pierre-Jean Robiquet</a> and <a href="Antoine%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Boutron%20Charlard">Antoine Boutron-Charlard</a>. <a href="Justus%20von%20Liebig">Liebig</a> and <a href="Friedrich%20Woehler">Wöhler</a> found three <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolysis</a> products of amygdalin: sugar, <a href="benzaldehyde">benzaldehyde</a>, and <a href="prussic%20acid">prussic acid</a> (hydrogen cyanide). Later research showed that <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> hydrolyzes it into <a href="D-glucose">D-glucose</a>, benzaldehyde, and prussic acid; while <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a> gives <a href="mandelic%20acid">mandelic acid</a>, D-glucose, and <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>.

In 1845 amygdalin was used as a cancer treatment in Russia, and in the 1920s in the United States, but it was considered too poisonous. In the 1950s, a purportedly non-toxic, synthetic form was patented for use as a meat preservative, and later marketed as laetrile for cancer treatment.

The <a href="U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> prohibited the interstate shipment of amygdalin and laetrile in 1977. Thereafter, 27 U.S. states legalized the use of amygdalin within those states.

In a 1977 controlled, blinded trial, laetrile showed no more activity than placebo.

Subsequently, laetrile was tested on 14 tumor systems without evidence of effectiveness. The <a href="Memorial%20Sloan%26amp%3Bndash%3BKettering%20Cancer%20Center">Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center</a> (MSKCC) concluded that "laetrile showed no beneficial effects." Mistakes in an earlier MSKCC press release were highlighted by a group of laetrile proponents led by <a href="Ralph%20W.%20Moss%20%28science%20writer%29">Ralph Moss</a>, former public affairs official of MSKCC who had been fired following his appearance at a press conference accusing the hospital of covering up the benefits of laetrile. These mistakes were considered scientifically inconsequential, but Nicholas Wade in "Science" stated that "even the appearance of a departure from strict objectivity is unfortunate." The results from these studies were published all together.

A 2015 <a href="systematic%20review">systematic review</a> from the <a href="Cochrane%20Collaboration">Cochrane Collaboration</a> found: 

The authors also recommended, on ethical and scientific grounds, that no further clinical research into laetrile or amygdalin be conducted.

Given the lack of evidence, laetrile has not been approved by the <a href="U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> or the <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a>.

The U.S. <a href="National%20Institutes%20of%20Health">National Institutes of Health</a> evaluated the evidence separately and concluded that clinical trials of amygdalin showed little or no effect against cancer. For example, a 1982 trial by the Mayo Clinic of 175 patients found that tumor size had increased in all but one patient. The authors reported that "the hazards of amygdalin therapy were evidenced in several patients by symptoms of cyanide toxicity or by blood cyanide levels approaching the lethal range."

The study concluded "Patients exposed to this agent should be instructed about the danger of cyanide poisoning, and their blood cyanide levels should be carefully monitored. Amygdalin (Laetrile) is a toxic drug that is not effective as a cancer treatment".

Additionally, "No controlled clinical trials (trials that compare groups of patients who receive the new treatment to groups who do not) of laetrile have been reported." 

The side effects of laetrile treatment are the symptoms of cyanide poisoning. These symptoms include: nausea and vomiting, headache, dizziness, cherry red skin color, liver damage, abnormally low blood pressure, droopy upper eyelid, trouble walking due to damaged nerves, fever, mental confusion, coma, and death.

The <a href="European%20Food%20Safety%20Agency">European Food Safety Agency</a>'s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain has studied the potential toxicity of the amygdalin in <a href="apricot%20kernels">apricot kernels</a>. The Panel reported, "If consumers follow the recommendations of websites that promote consumption of apricot kernels, their exposure to cyanide will greatly exceed" the dose expected to be toxic. The Panel also reported that acute cyanide toxicity had occurred in adults who had consumed 20 or more kernels and that in children "five or more kernels appear to be toxic".

Advocates for laetrile assert that there is a <a href="conspiracy%20theory">conspiracy</a> between the US <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a>, the <a href="pharmaceutical%20industry">pharmaceutical industry</a> and the medical community, including the <a href="American%20Medical%20Association">American Medical Association</a> and the <a href="American%20Cancer%20Society">American Cancer Society</a>, to exploit the American people, and especially cancer patients.

Advocates of the use of laetrile have also changed the rationale for its use, first as a treatment of cancer, then as a vitamin, then as part of a "holistic" nutritional regimen, or as treatment for cancer pain, among others, none of which have any significant evidence supporting its use.

Despite the lack of evidence for its use, laetrile developed a significant following due to its wide promotion as a "pain-free" treatment of cancer as an alternative to <a href="surgery">surgery</a> and <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> that have significant side effects. The use of laetrile led to a number of deaths.
The FDA and AMA crackdown, begun in the 1970s, effectively escalated prices on the black market, played into the conspiracy narrative and enabled unscrupulous profiteers to foster multimillion-dollar smuggling empires.

Some North American cancer patients have traveled to <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> for treatment with the substance, for example at the <a href="Oasis%20of%20Hope%20Hospital">Oasis of Hope Hospital</a> in <a href="Tijuana">Tijuana</a>. The actor <a href="Steve%20McQueen">Steve McQueen</a> died in Mexico following surgery to remove a stomach tumor having previously undergone extended treatment for <a href="pleural">pleural</a> <a href="mesothelioma">mesothelioma</a> (a cancer associated with asbestos exposure) under the care of <a href="William%20Donald%20Kelley">William D. Kelley</a>, a de-licensed dentist and orthodontist who claimed to have devised a cancer treatment involving pancreatic enzymes, 50 daily vitamins and minerals, frequent body shampoos, enemas, and a specific diet as well as laetrile.

Laetrile advocates in the United States include <a href="Dean%20Burk">Dean Burk</a>, a former chief chemist of the <a href="National%20Cancer%20Institute">National Cancer Institute</a> <a href="cytochemistry">cytochemistry</a> laboratory, and national <a href="arm%20wrestling">arm wrestling</a> champion Jason Vale, who claimed that his <a href="kidney%20cancer">kidney</a> and <a href="pancreatic%20cancer">pancreatic</a> cancers were cured by eating <a href="apricot">apricot</a> seeds. Vale was convicted in 2004 for, among other things, fraudulently marketing laetrile as a cancer cure. The court also found that Vale had made at least $500,000 from his fraudulent sales of laetrile.

In the 1970s, court cases in several states challenged the FDA's authority to restrict access to what they claimed was a potentially lifesaving drugs. More than twenty states passed laws making the use of Laetrile legal. After the unanimous Supreme Court ruling in "Rutherford v. United States" which established that interstate transport of the compound was illegal, usage fell off dramatically. The US Food and Drug Administration continues to seek jail sentences for vendors marketing laetrile for cancer treatment, calling it a "highly toxic product that has not shown any effect on treating cancer."

Running amok

Running amok, sometimes referred to as simply amok or gone amok, also spelled amuk, from the <a href="Malay%20language">Malay language</a>, is "an episode of sudden mass assault against people or objects usually by a single individual following a period of brooding that has traditionally been regarded as occurring especially in Malay culture but is now increasingly viewed as psychopathological behavior". The syndrome of "Amok" is found in the "<a href="Diagnostic%20and%20Statistical%20Manual%20of%20Mental%20Disorders">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>" (DSM-IV TR). The phrase is often used in a less serious manner when describing something that is wildly out of control or causing a frenzy (e.g., a dog tearing up the living room furniture might be termed as "running amok".)

Amok originated from the Malay/Indonesian word "meng-âmuk", which when roughly defined means "to make a furious and desperate charge". According to Malay/Indonesian culture, amok was rooted in a deep spiritual belief. They believed that amok was caused by the "hantu belian", which was an evil tiger spirit that entered one’s body and caused the heinous act. As a result of the belief, those in Indonesian culture tolerated amok and dealt with the after-effects with no ill will towards the assailant.

Although commonly used in a colloquial and less-violent sense, the phrase is particularly associated with a specific sociopathic <a href="culture-bound%20syndrome">culture-bound syndrome</a> in <a href="Culture%20of%20Malaysia">Malaysian culture</a>. In a typical case of "running amok", an individual (often male), having shown no previous sign of anger or any inclination to violence, will acquire a weapon (traditionally a sword or dagger, but presently any of a variety of weapons) and in a sudden frenzy, will attempt to kill or seriously injure anyone he encounters and himself. Amok typically takes place in a well populated or crowded area. Amok episodes of this kind normally end with the attacker being killed by bystanders or committing <a href="suicide">suicide</a>, eliciting theories that amok may be a form of intentional suicide in cultures where suicide is heavily stigmatized. Those who do not commit suicide and are not killed typically lose consciousness, and upon regaining consciousness, claim amnesia.

An early Western description of the practice appears in the journals of <a href="James%20Cook">Captain James Cook</a>, a British explorer, who encountered amok firsthand in 1770 during a voyage around the world. Cook writes of individuals behaving in a reckless, violent manner, without cause and "indiscriminately killing and maiming villagers and animals in a frenzied attack."

A widely accepted explanation links amok with male <a href="honor">honor</a> (amok by women is virtually unknown). 
Running amok would thus be both a way of escaping the world (since perpetrators were normally killed) and re-establishing one's reputation as a man to be feared and respected.

"Running amok" is used to refer to the behavior of someone who, in the grip of strong emotion, obtains a weapon and begins attacking people indiscriminately, often with multiple fatalities. An episode of amok may be triggered by a period of depression or highly aggressive behavior. The slang terms "<a href="going%20postal">going postal</a>" or "going ballistic" are similar in scope.
Police describe such an event as a <a href="spree%20killer">killing spree</a>. If the individual is seeking death an alternate method is often "<a href="suicide%20by%20cop">suicide by cop</a>".

Amok is often described as a culture-bound (or culture-specific) syndrome, which is a psychological condition whose manifestation is strongly shaped by cultural factors. Other reported culture-bound syndromes are <a href="latah">latah</a> and <a href="Penis%20panic">koro</a>. Amok is also sometimes considered one of the subcategories of <a href="dissociative%20disorders">dissociative disorders</a> (cross-cultural variant).

In 1849, amok was officially classified as a psychiatric condition based on numerous reports and case studies that showed the majority of individuals who committed amok were, in some sense, mentally ill. However, DSM-IV does now break amok down into two official categories; beramok and amok. Beramok is considered to be the more common of the two and is associated with the depression and sadness resulting from a loss and the subsequent brooding process. Loss includes, but is not limited to, the death of a spouse or loved one, divorce, loss of a job, money, power, etc. Beramok is associated with mental issues of severe depression or other mood disorders. Amok, the rarer form, is believed to stem from rage, insult, or a vendetta against a person, society, or object for a wide variety of reasons. Amok has been more closely associated with psychosis, personality disorders, bipolar disorder, and delusions.

Early travelers in Asia sometimes describe a kind of military amok, in which soldiers apparently facing inevitable defeat suddenly burst into a frenzy of violence which so startled their enemies that it either delivered victory or at least ensured what the soldier in that culture considered an honourable death.

An example would be during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bukit%20Chandu">Battle of Bukit Chandu</a> in Singapore during WWII when 41 outnumbered soldiers of the Malay Regiment, led by <a href="Adnan%20Saidi">Adnan Saidi</a>, charged and went all out against a 13 000 strong invading Japanese Army. They continued the fight armed with just knives and bayonets for three days before they were finally defeated.

This form of amok appears to resemble the <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a> "<a href="Berserker">Berserker</a>", the "cafard" or "cathard" (Polynesia), "mal de pelea" (Puerto Rico), "iich'aa" (Navaho), Laos, and Papua New Guinea.

In contemporary <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, the term "amok" ("amuk") generally refers not to individual violence, but to frenzied violence by mobs. Indonesians now commonly use the term 'gelap mata' (literally 'darkened eyes') to refer to individual amok. <a href="Laurens%20van%20der%20Post">Laurens van der Post</a> experienced the phenomenon in the East Indies and wrote in 1955:

In the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, "amok" also means unreasoning murderous rage by an individual. In 1876, the Spanish governor-general of the Philippines <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Malcampo">José Malcampo</a> coined the term "<a href="juramentado">juramentado</a>" for the behavior (from "juramentar" - "to take an oath"), surviving into modern <a href="Filipino%20language">Filipino language</a>s as "huramentado". It has historically been linked with the <a href="Moro%20people">Moro people</a> of <a href="Mindanao">Mindanao</a>, particularly in the island of <a href="Jolo">Jolo</a> in connection with societal and cultural pressures.

Norse <a href="Berserker">Berserker</a>s and the <a href="Zulu%20people">Zulu</a> battle trance are two other examples of the tendency of certain groups to work themselves up into a killing frenzy.

According to the <a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica%20Eleventh%20Edition">"Encyclopædia Britannica" Eleventh Edition</a>, some notable cases have occurred among the <a href="Rajputs">Rajputs</a>. In 1634, the eldest son of the <a href="raja">raja</a> of <a href="Jodhpur">Jodhpur</a> ran amok at the court of <a href="Shah%20Jahan">Shah Jahan</a>, failing in his attack on the emperor, but killing five of his officials. During the 18th century, again, at <a href="Hyderabad%2C%20Sindh">Hyderabad</a> (Sind), two envoys, sent by the Jodhpur chief in regard to a quarrel between the two states, stabbed the prince and twenty-six of his suite before they themselves fell.

<doc id="3255" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3255" title="Apostles' Creed">
Apostles' Creed

The Apostles' Creed (<a href="Ecclesiastical%20Latin">Latin</a>: "Symbolum Apostolorum" or "Symbolum Apostolicum"), sometimes entitled Symbol of the Apostles, is an early statement of <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> belief—a <a href="creed">creed</a> or "symbol". It is widely used by a number of <a href="List%20of%20Christian%20denominations">Christian denominations</a> for both <a href="liturgy">liturgical</a> and <a href="catechesis">catechetical</a> purposes, most visibly by liturgical Churches of Western tradition, including the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheranism</a> and <a href="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a>. It is also used by <a href="Presbyterians">Presbyterians</a>, <a href="Methodists">Methodists</a> and <a href="Congregational%20church">Congregationalists</a>.

The Apostles' Creed is <a href="Trinity">Trinitarian</a> in structure with sections affirming belief in <a href="God%20the%20Father">God the Father</a>, <a href="God%20the%20Son">Jesus Christ His Son</a> and the <a href="Holy%20Spirit%20in%20Christianity">Holy Spirit</a>. The Apostles' Creed was based on Christian theological understanding of the <a href="Canonical%20gospels">Canonical gospels</a>, the letters of the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> and to a lesser extent the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>. Its basis appears to be the old Roman Creed known also as the <a href="Old%20Roman%20Symbol">Old Roman Symbol</a>. Because of the early origin of its original form, it does not address some <a href="Christology">Christological</a> issues defined in the <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Nicene</a> and other <a href="List%20of%20Christian%20creeds">Christian Creeds</a>. It thus says nothing explicitly about the <a href="Divinity%20of%20Jesus">divinity</a> of either <a href="God%20the%20Son">Jesus</a> or the <a href="Holy%20Spirit%20%28Christianity%29">Holy Spirit</a>. This makes it acceptable to many <a href="Arianism">Arians</a> and <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarians</a>. Nor does it address many other theological questions which became objects of dispute centuries later.

The first mention of the expression "Apostles’ Creed" occurs in a letter of 390 AD from a synod in <a href="Milan">Milan</a> and may have been associated with the belief, widely accepted in the 4th century, that, under the inspiration of the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>, each of the <a href="Twelve%20Apostles">Twelve Apostles</a> contributed an article of a creed.

The title "Symbolum Apostolicum" (Symbol or Creed of the Apostles) appears for the first time in a letter, probably written by <a href="Ambrose">Ambrose</a>, from a Council in <a href="Early%20centers%20of%20Christianity%23Milan">Milan</a> to <a href="Pope%20Siricius">Pope Siricius</a> in about 390 AD "Let them give credit to the Creed of the Apostles, which the Roman Church has always kept and preserved undefiled". But what existed at that time was not what is now known as the Apostles' Creed but a shorter statement of belief that, for instance, did not include the phrase "maker of <a href="Heaven%20%28Christianity%29">heaven</a> and earth", a phrase that may have been inserted only in the 7th century.
The account of the origin of this creed, the forerunner and principal source of the Apostles' Creed, as having been jointly created by the Apostles under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, with each of the twelve contributing one of the articles, was already current at that time.

The earlier text evolved from simpler texts based on , part of the <a href="Great%20Commission">Great Commission</a>, and it has been argued that it was already in written form by the late <a href="Christianity%20in%20the%202nd%20century">2nd century</a> (c. 180).

While the individual statements of belief that are included in the Apostles' Creed – even those not found in the <a href="Old%20Roman%20Symbol">Old Roman Symbol</a> – are found in various writings by <a href="Irenaeus">Irenaeus</a>, <a href="Tertullian">Tertullian</a>, <a href="Novatian">Novatian</a>, <a href="Marcellus%20of%20Ancyra">Marcellus</a>, <a href="Tyrannius%20Rufinus">Rufinus</a>, <a href="Ambrose">Ambrose</a>, <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine</a>, <a href="Nicetas%20of%20Remesiana">Nicetas</a>, and <a href="Eusebius%20Gallus">Eusebius Gallus</a>, the earliest appearance of what we know as the Apostles' Creed was in the "De singulis libris canonicis scarapsus" (""Excerpt from Individual Canonical Books"") of <a href="Saint%20Pirmin">St. Pirminius</a> (<a href="Jacques%20Paul%20Migne">Migne</a>, "<a href="Patrologia%20Latina">Patrologia Latina</a>" 89, 1029 ff.), written between 710 and 714. Bettenson and Maunder state that it is first from "Dicta Abbatis Pirminii de singulis libris canonicis scarapsus" ("idem quod excarpsus", excerpt), c. 750. This longer Creed seems to have arisen in what is now France and Spain. <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> imposed it throughout his dominions, and it was finally accepted in Rome, where the <a href="Old%20Roman%20Symbol">Old Roman Symbol</a> or similar formulas had survived for centuries. It has been argued nonetheless that it dates from the second half of the 5th century, though no earlier.

Some have suggested that the Apostles' Creed was spliced together with phrases from the New Testament. For instance, the phrase "descendit ad inferos" (<a href="Harrowing%20of%20Hell">"he descended into hell"</a>) echoes , "κατέβη εἰς τὰ κατώτερα μέρη τῆς γῆς" ("he descended into the lower, earthly regions"). It is of interest that this phrase first appeared in one of the two versions of Rufinus in A.D. 390 and then did not appear again in any version of the creed until A.D. 650.

This phrase and that on the <a href="communion%20of%20saints">communion of saints</a> are articles found in the Apostles' Creed, but not in the <a href="Old%20Roman%20Symbol">Old Roman Symbol</a> nor in the Nicene Creed.

Musical settings of the Symbolum Apostolorum as a <a href="motet">motet</a> are rare. The French composer Le Brung published one Latin setting in 1540, the Spanish composer <a href="Fernando%20de%20las%20Infantas">Fernando de las Infantas</a> published two in 1578.

More recently, in 1979 <a href="John%20Michael%20Talbot">John Michael Talbot</a>, a <a href="Third%20Order%20of%20Saint%20Francis">Third Order Franciscan</a>, composed and recorded "Creed" on his album, "The Lord’s Supper". In 1986 <a href="Graham%20Kendrick">Graham Kendrick</a> published the popular "We believe in God the Father", closely based on the Apostles' Creed. <a href="Rich%20Mullins">Rich Mullins</a> and <a href="Beaker%20%28musician%29">Beaker</a> also composed a musical setting titled "Creed", released on Mullins‘ 1993 album "<a href="A%20Liturgy%2C%20a%20Legacy%2C%20%26amp%3B%20a%20Ragamuffin%20Band">A Liturgy, a Legacy, & a Ragamuffin Band</a>". The song "Creed" on <a href="Petra">Petra</a>’s 1990 album "Beyond Belief" is loosely based on the Apostles' Creed.

In 1991, <a href="GIA%20Publications">GIA Publications</a> published a hymn text directly based on the Apostles’ Creed, called "I Believe in God Almighty." It has been sung to hymn tunes from Wales, the Netherlands, and Ireland.

In 2014 <a href="Hillsong%20Music%20Australia">Hillsong</a> released a version of the Apostles' Creed under the title "This I Believe (The Creed)" on their album <a href="No%20Other%20Name">No Other Name</a>.

In 2016 <a href="Keith%20Getty">Keith Getty</a> and <a href="Kristyn%20Getty">Kristyn Getty</a> released an expression of the Apostles' Creed under the title "We Believe (Apostle's Creed)" on their album "Facing a Task Unfinished".

<a href="Pelbartus%20Ladislaus%20of%20Temesv%C3%A1r">Pelbartus Ladislaus of Temesvár</a> assigned one special phrase to each apostle: <a href="Saint%20Peter">Peter</a> (№ 1), <a href="John%20the%20Apostle">John</a> (№ 2), <a href="James%2C%20son%20of%20Zebedee">James</a>, son of <a href="Zebedee">Zebedee</a> (№ 3), <a href="Andrew%20the%20Apostle">Andrew</a> (№ 4), <a href="Philip%20the%20Apostle">Philip</a> (№ 5a: descendit ad infernos…), <a href="Thomas%20the%20Apostle">Thomas</a> (№ 5b: ascendit ad caelos…), <a href="Bartholomew%20the%20Apostle">Bartholomew</a> (№ 6), <a href="Matthew%20the%20Apostle">Matthew</a> (№ 7), <a href="James%2C%20son%20of%20Alphaeus">James</a>, son of <a href="Alphaeus">Alphaeus</a> (№ 8), <a href="Simon%20the%20Zealot">Simon</a> (№ 9), <a href="Jude%20the%20Apostle">Jude</a> (№ 10), <a href="Saint%20Matthias">Matthias</a> (№ 11–12).

<a href="Anabaptist%20theology">Anabaptist theologians</a> fought for <a href="believer%27s%20baptism">believer's baptism</a> under reference to a biblical understanding of the creed:

In the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> there are currently two authorized forms of the creed: that of the "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>" (1662) and that of "<a href="Common%20Worship">Common Worship</a>" (2000).
Book of Common Prayer, 1662
<poem>I believe in God the Father Almighty,
Maker of heaven and earth:

And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord,
Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost,
Born of the Virgin Mary,
Suffered under Pontius Pilate,
Was crucified, dead, and buried:
He descended into hell;
The third day he rose again from the dead;
He ascended into heaven,
And sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty;
From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Ghost;
The holy Catholick Church;
The Communion of Saints;
The Forgiveness of sins;
The Resurrection of the body,
And the Life everlasting.
Amen.</poem>

Common Worship

The publication "<a href="Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Worship">Evangelical Lutheran Worship</a>" gives the ELLC ecumenical version, footnoting the phrase "he descended to the dead" to indicate the alternative reading: "or ‘he descended into hell,’ another translation of this text in widespread use".

The "<a href="Lutheran%20Service%20Book">Lutheran Service Book</a>" has the following text:
<poem>I believe in God, the Father Almighty,
And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,
I believe in the Holy Spirit,

The creed is footnoted in the <a href="Lutheran%20Service%20Book">LSB</a> for the word "Christian": ""Christian:" the ancient text reads "catholic," meaning the whole Church as it confesses the wholeness of Christian doctrine."

The <a href="Church%20of%20Denmark">Church of Denmark</a> still uses the phrase "We renounce the devil and all his doings and all his beings" as the beginning of this creed, before the line "We believe in God etc." This is mostly due to the influence of the Danish pastor <a href="N.%20F.%20S.%20Grundtvig">Grundtvig</a>. See .

The <a href="United%20Methodist%20Church">United Methodists</a> commonly incorporate the Apostles' Creed into their worship services. The version which is most often used is located at #881 in the "<a href="United%20Methodist%20Hymnal">United Methodist Hymnal</a>", one of their most popular hymnals and one with a heritage to brothers <a href="John%20Wesley">John Wesley</a> and <a href="Charles%20Wesley">Charles Wesley</a>, founders of <a href="Methodism">Methodism</a>. It is notable for omitting the line "he descended into hell", but is otherwise very similar to the Book of Common Prayer version. The 1989 Hymnal has both the traditional version and the 1988 ecumenical version, which includes "he descended to the dead."

The "United Methodist Hymnal" also contains (at #882) what it terms the "Ecumenical Version" of this creed which is the ecumenically accepted modern translation of the International Committee on English Texts (1975) as amended by the subsequent successor body, the English Language Liturgical Consultation (1987). This form of the Apostles' Creed can be found incorporated into the Eucharistic and Baptismal Liturgies in the Hymnal and in "The United Methodist Book of Worship", and hence it is growing in popularity and use. The word "catholic" is intentionally left lowercase in the sense that the word catholic applies to the universal and ecumenical Christian church.

I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth; And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; the third day he rose from the dead; he ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.

The liturgical communities in western Christianity that derive their rituals from the <a href="Roman%20Missal">Roman Missal</a>, including those particular communities which use the Roman Missal itself (Roman Catholics), the "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>" (<a href="Anglicanism">Anglicans</a> and Episcopalians), "<a href="Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Worship">Evangelical Lutheran Worship</a>" (<a href="Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Church%20in%20America">Evangelical Lutheran Church in America</a>), "<a href="Lutheran%20Service%20Book">Lutheran Service Book</a>" (<a href="Lutheran%20Church%E2%80%93Missouri%20Synod">Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod</a>), and "<a href="The%20United%20Methodist%20Book%20of%20Worship%20%281992%29">The United Methodist Book of Worship</a>" (<a href="The%20United%20Methodist%20Church">The United Methodist Church</a>), use the Apostles' Creed and interrogative forms of it in their rites of <a href="Baptism">Baptism</a>, which they consider to be the <a href="sacrament">sacrament</a> of initiation into the Church.

An interrogative form of the Apostles' Creed is used in the Rite of Baptism (for both children and adults). The minister of baptism asks the following questions (<a href="International%20Commission%20on%20English%20in%20the%20Liturgy">ICEL</a>, 1974):

To each question, the catechumen, or, in the case of an infant, the parents and sponsor(s) (godparent(s)) in his or her place, answers "I do." Then the celebrant says:

And all respond: Amen.

Since the 2002 edition, the Apostles' Creed is included in the <a href="Roman%20Missal">Roman Missal</a> with the indication, "Instead of the <a href="Nicene%20Creed">Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed</a>, especially during Lent and Easter time, the baptismal Symbol of the Roman Church, known as the Apostles’ Creed, may be used." Previously the Nicene Creed was the only profession of faith that the Missal gave for use at <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a>, except in Masses for children; but in some countries use of the Apostles’ Creed was already permitted.

In the 1962 <a href="Breviary">Breviary</a>, authorized by <a href="Summorum%20Pontificum">Summorum Pontificum</a>, the Apostles' Creed is recited at <a href="Prime">Prime</a> and <a href="Compline">Compline</a> on certain days during Advent and Lent as part of the "<a href="Preces">Preces</a>", a series of versicles and responses preceded by "Kyrie, eleison" ("Lord, have mercy") and the <a href="Our%20Father">Our Father</a>. In prior editions, it was also said after the Our Father and <a href="Hail%20Mary">Hail Mary</a> before <a href="Matins">Matins</a> and Prime, and after Compline.

The Apostles' Creed is used in the non-Eucharistic services of <a href="Matins">Matins</a> and <a href="Evening%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Evening Prayer</a> (<a href="Evening%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Evensong</a>). It is invoked after the recitation or singing of the <a href="Canticle">Canticle</a>s, and it is the only part of the services in which the congregation traditionally turns to face the altar, if they are seated transversely in the <a href="Choir%20%28architecture%29">quire</a>.

The <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America">Episcopal Church</a> uses the Apostles' Creed as a Baptismal Covenant for those who are to receive the Rite of Baptism. Regardless of age, candidates are to be sponsored by parents and/or godparents. Youths able to understand the significance of the Rite may go through the ritual speaking for themselves. Younger children and infants rely on their sponsors to act upon their behalf.

1. The celebrant calls for the candidates for Baptism to be presented.

2. The catechumen or sponsors state their request for Baptism.

3a. If the catechumen is of age, the celebrant will ask him or her if he or she desires Baptism, to which the catechumen will respond: "I do."

3b. If the candidate relies on sponsors, the celebrant asks them if they will raise the child in "the Christian faith and life" (ECUSA BCP), and will raise the child through "prayers and witness to grow into the full stature of Christ" to which the parents will state to each, "I will, with God's help."

4. A series of questions is then asked, to which the reply is always "I renounce them":

5. The second half of the query is asked, to which the reply is always "I do":

6. The Apostles' Creed is then recited by candidates, sponsors and congregation, each section of the Creed being an answer to the celebrant’s question, 'Do you believe in God the Father (God the Son, God the Holy Spirit)?'

<a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a>s following the "<a href="Lutheran%20Service%20Book">Lutheran Service Book</a>" (<a href="Lutheran%20Church%E2%80%93Missouri%20Synod">Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod</a> and the <a href="Lutheran%20Church%E2%80%93Canada">Lutheran Church–Canada</a>), like Roman Catholics, use the Apostles' Creed during the Sacrament of Baptism:

Following each question, the candidate answers by saying "Yes, I believe". If the candidate is a child, the godparents are to answer the questions.

For ELCA Lutherans who use the <a href="Evangelical%20Lutheran%20Worship">Evangelical Lutheran Worship</a> book, the Apostles' Creed appears during the Sacrament of Holy Baptism Rite on p. 229 of the hardcover pew edition.

<a href="Methodism">Methodists</a> use the Apostles' Creed as part of their baptismal rites in the form of an interrogatory addressed to the candidate(s) for baptism and the whole congregation as a way of professing the faith within the context of the Church’s sacramental act. For infants, it is the professing of the faith by the parents, sponsors, and congregation on behalf of the candidate(s); for confirmands, it is the professing of the faith before and among the congregation. For the congregation, it is a reaffirmation of their professed faith.

Amicable numbers

Amicable numbers are two different <a href="number">number</a>s so related that the <a href="addition">sum</a> of the <a href="proper%20divisor">proper divisor</a>s of each is equal to the other number. (A proper divisor of a number is a positive factor of that number other than the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3.) A pair of amicable numbers constitutes an <a href="aliquot%20sequence">aliquot sequence</a> of <a href="Periodic%20sequence">period</a> 2. A related concept is that of a <a href="perfect%20number">perfect number</a>, which is a number that equals the sum of "its own" proper divisors, in other words a number which forms an aliquot sequence of period 1. Numbers that are members of an aliquot sequence with period greater than 2 are known as <a href="sociable%20number">sociable number</a>s.

The smallest pair of amicable numbers is (<a href="220%20%28number%29">220</a>, <a href="284%20%28number%29">284</a>). They are amicable because the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110, of which the sum is 284; and the proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142, of which the sum is 220.

The first ten amicable pairs are: (220, 284), (1184, 1210), (2620, 2924), (5020, 5564), (6232, 6368), (10744, 10856), (12285, 14595), (17296, 18416), (63020, 76084), and (66928, 66992).. (Also see and )

Amicable numbers were known to the <a href="Pythagoreanism">Pythagoreans</a>, who credited them with many mystical properties. A general formula by which some of these numbers could be derived was invented circa 850 by the <a href="Iraqi%20people">Iraqi</a> mathematician <a href="Th%C4%81bit%20ibn%20Qurra">Thābit ibn Qurra</a> (826–901). Other <a href="Arab">Arab</a> mathematicians who studied amicable numbers are <a href="Maslamah%20Ibn%20Ahmad%20al-Majriti">al-Majriti</a> (died 1007), <a href="Ibn%20Tahir%20al-Baghdadi">al-Baghdadi</a> (980–1037), and <a href="Kam%C4%81l%20al-D%C4%ABn%20al-F%C4%81ris%C4%AB">al-Fārisī</a> (1260–1320). The <a href="Iran">Iran</a>ian mathematician <a href="Muhammad%20Baqir%20Yazdi">Muhammad Baqir Yazdi</a> (16th century) discovered the pair (9363584, 9437056), though this has often been attributed to <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">Descartes</a>. Much of the work of <a href="Mathematics%20in%20medieval%20Islam">Eastern mathematicians</a> in this area has been forgotten.

Thābit ibn Qurra's formula was rediscovered by <a href="Pierre%20de%20Fermat">Fermat</a> (1601–1665) and <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">Descartes</a> (1596–1650), to whom it is sometimes ascribed, and extended by <a href="Leonhard%20Euler">Euler</a> (1707–1783). It was extended further by <a href="Walter%20Borho">Borho</a> in 1972. Fermat and Descartes also rediscovered pairs of amicable numbers known to Arab mathematicians. Euler also discovered dozens of new pairs. The second smallest pair, (1184, 1210), was discovered in 1866 by a then teenage B. Nicolò I. Paganini (not to be confused with the composer and violinist), having been overlooked by earlier mathematicians.

By 1946 there were 390 known pairs, but the advent of computers has allowed the discovery of many thousands since then. Exhaustive searches have been carried out to find all pairs less than a given bound, this bound being extended from 10 in 1970, to 10 in 1986, 10 in 1993, 10 in 2015, and to 10 in 2016.

, there are over 1,220,347,955 known amicable pairs.

While these rules do generate some pairs of amicable numbers, many other pairs are known, so these rules are by no means comprehensive.

The Thābit ibn Qurra theorem is a method for discovering amicable numbers invented in the ninth century by the <a href="Arab">Arab</a> <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> <a href="Th%C4%81bit%20ibn%20Qurra">Thābit ibn Qurra</a>.

It states that if
where is an <a href="integer">integer</a> and , , and are <a href="prime%20number">prime number</a>s, then and are a pair of amicable numbers. This formula gives the pairs for , for , and for , but no other such pairs are known. Numbers of the form are known as <a href="Thabit%20number">Thabit number</a>s. In order for Ibn Qurra's formula to produce an amicable pair, two consecutive Thabit numbers must be prime; this severely restricts the possible values of .

To establish the theorem, Thâbit ibn Qurra proved nine <a href="Lemma%20%28mathematics%29">lemmas</a> divided into two groups. The first three lemmas deal with the determination of the aliquot parts of a natural integer. The second group of lemmas deals more specifically with the formation of perfect, abundant and deficient numbers.

"Euler's rule" is a generalization of the Thâbit ibn Qurra theorem. It states that if
where are <a href="integer">integer</a>s and , , and are <a href="prime%20number">prime number</a>s, then and are a pair of amicable numbers. Thābit ibn Qurra's theorem corresponds to the case . Euler's rule creates additional amicable pairs for with no others being known. Euler (1747 & 1750) overall found 58 new pairs to make all the by then existing pairs into 61.

Let (, ) be a pair of amicable numbers with , and write and where is the <a href="greatest%20common%20divisor">greatest common divisor</a> of and . If and are both <a href="coprime">coprime</a> to and <a href="Square-free%20integer">square free</a> then the pair (, ) is said to be regular (see sequence in <a href="On-Line%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Integer%20Sequences">OEIS</a>), otherwise it is called irregular or exotic. If (, ) is regular and and have and prime factors respectively, then is said to be of type .

For example, with , the greatest common divisor is and so and . Therefore, is regular of type .

An amicable pair is twin if there are no integers between and belonging to any other amicable pair .

In every known case, the numbers of a pair are either both <a href="Even%20and%20odd%20numbers">even</a> or both odd. It is not known whether an even-odd pair of amicable numbers exists, but if it does, the even number must either be a square number or twice one, and the odd number must be a square number. However, amicable numbers where the two members have different smallest prime factors do exist: there are seven such pairs known. Also, every known pair shares at least one common prime <a href="Divisor">factor</a>. It is not known whether a pair of <a href="coprime">coprime</a> amicable numbers exists, though if any does, the <a href="product%20%28mathematics%29">product</a> of the two must be greater than 10. Also, a pair of coprime amicable numbers cannot be generated by Thabit's formula (above), nor by any similar formula.

In 1955, <a href="Paul%20Erd%C5%91s">Paul Erdős</a> showed that the density of amicable numbers, relative to the positive integers, was 0.

According to the sum of amicable pairs conjecture, as the number of the amicable numbers approaches infinity, the percentage of the sums of the amicable pairs divisible by ten approaches 100% .


Amicable numbers formula_1 satisfy formula_2 and formula_3 which can be written together as formula_4. This can be generalized to larger tuples, say formula_5, where we require

For example, (1980, 2016, 2556) is an amicable triple , and (3270960, 3361680, 3461040, 3834000) is an amicable quadruple .

Amicable <a href="multiset">multiset</a>s are defined analogously and generalizes this a bit further .

Sociable numbers are the numbers in cyclic lists of numbers (with a length greater than 2) where each number is the sum of the proper divisors of the preceding number. For example, formula_7 are sociable numbers of order 4.

The <a href="aliquot%20sequence">aliquot sequence</a> can be represented as a <a href="directed%20graph">directed graph</a>, formula_8, for a given integer formula_9, where formula_10 denotes the
sum of the proper divisors of formula_11.
<a href="cycle%20%28graph%20theory%29">Cycles</a> in formula_8 represent <a href="sociable%20numbers">sociable numbers</a> within the interval formula_13. Two special cases are loops that represent <a href="perfect%20numbers">perfect numbers</a> and cycles of length two that represent <a href="amicable%20pairs">amicable pairs</a>.

Agar

Agar (pronounced , ) or agar-agar is a jelly-like substance, obtained from <a href="algae">algae</a>.

Agar is derived from the <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a> <a href="agarose">agarose</a>, which forms the supporting structure in the cell walls of certain species of algae, and which is released on boiling. These algae are known as <a href="agarophyte">agarophyte</a>s and belong to the <a href="Rhodophyta">Rhodophyta</a> (red algae) phylum. Agar is actually the resulting mixture of two components: the linear polysaccharide agarose, and a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules called <a href="agaropectin">agaropectin</a>.

Agar has been used as an ingredient in <a href="dessert">dessert</a>s throughout Asia, and also as a solid <a href="substrate%20%28biology%29">substrate</a> to contain <a href="Growth%20medium">culture media</a> for <a href="microbiology">microbiological</a> work. Agar can be used as a <a href="laxative">laxative</a>, an appetite suppressant, a <a href="vegetarian">vegetarian</a> substitute for <a href="gelatin">gelatin</a>, a thickener for <a href="soup">soup</a>s, in <a href="Fruit%20preserves%23Jelly">fruit preserves</a>, <a href="ice%20cream">ice cream</a>, and other desserts, as a clarifying agent in <a href="brewing">brewing</a>, and for <a href="sizing">sizing</a> paper and fabrics.

The gelling agent in agar is an unbranched polysaccharide obtained from the cell walls of some species of red algae, primarily from the <a href="genus">genera</a> "<a href="Gelidium">Gelidium</a>" and "<a href="Gracilaria">Gracilaria</a>". For commercial purposes, it is derived primarily from "<a href="Gelidium%20amansii">Gelidium amansii</a>". In chemical terms, agar is a <a href="polymer">polymer</a> made up of subunits of the sugar <a href="galactose">galactose</a>.

Agar may have been discovered in Japan in 1658 by Mino Tarōzaemon (), an innkeeper who, according to legend, was said to have discarded surplus seaweed soup and noticed that it gelled later after a winter night's freezing. Over the following centuries, agar became a common gelling agent in several Southeast Asian cuisines.

Agar was first subjected to chemical analysis in 1859 by the French chemist <a href="Anselme%20Payen">Anselme Payen</a>, who had obtained agar from the marine algae "Gelidium corneum".

Beginning in the late 19th century, agar began to be used heavily as a solid medium for growing various microbes. Agar was first described for use in microbiology in 1882 by the German microbiologist <a href="Walther%20Hesse">Walther Hesse</a>, an assistant working in <a href="Robert%20Koch">Robert Koch</a>'s laboratory, on the suggestion of his wife <a href="Fanny%20Hesse">Fannie Hesse</a>. Agar quickly supplanted gelatin as the base of microbiological media, due to its higher melting temperature, allowing microbes to be grown at higher temperatures without the media liquefying.

With its newfound use in microbiology, agar production quickly increased. This production centered on Japan which produced most of the world's agar until World War II. However, with the outbreak of World War II many nations were forced to establish domestic agar industries in order to continue microbiological research. Around the time of World War II, approximately 2,500 tons of agar were produced annually. By the mid-1970s, production worldwide had increased dramatically to approximately 10,000 tons each year. Since then, production of agar has fluctuated due to unstable and sometimes over-utilized seaweed populations.

The word "agar" comes from agar-agar, the <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a> name for red algae ("<a href="Gigartina">Gigartina</a>", "<a href="Gracilaria">Gracilaria</a>") from which the jelly is produced. It is also known as Kanten () (from the phrase "kan-zarashi <a href="Tokoroten">tokoroten</a>" () or “cold-exposed agar”), Japanese isinglass, Ceylon moss or Jaffna moss. "Gracilaria lichenoides" is specifically referred to as agal-agal or Ceylon agar.

Agar consists of a mixture of two <a href="polysaccharide">polysaccharide</a>s: agarose and agaropectin, with agarose making up about 70% of the mixture. <a href="Agarose">Agarose</a> is a linear polymer, made up of repeating units of <a href="Agarose%23Structure">agarobiose</a>, a disaccharide made up of <a href="D-galactose">D-galactose</a> and 3,6-anhydro-L-galactopyranose. Agaropectin is a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules that occur in lesser amounts, and is made up of alternating units of D-galactose and L-galactose heavily modified with acidic side-groups, such as sulfate and pyruvate.

Agar exhibits <a href="hysteresis">hysteresis</a>, melting at 85 °C (358 K, 185 °F) and solidifying from 32–40 °C (305–313 K, 90–104 °F). This property lends a suitable balance between easy melting and good gel stability at relatively high temperatures. Since many scientific applications require incubation at temperatures close to human body temperature (37 °C), agar is more appropriate than other solidifying agents that melt at this temperature, such as gelatin.

An agar plate or Petri dish is used to provide a <a href="growth%20medium">growth medium</a> using a mix of agar and other nutrients in which microorganisms, including <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> and <a href="fungi">fungi</a>, can be cultured and observed under the microscope. Agar is indigestible for many organisms so that microbial growth does not affect the gel used and it remains stable. Agar is typically sold commercially as a powder that can be mixed with water and prepared similarly to gelatin before use as a growth medium. Other ingredients are added to the agar to meet the nutritional needs of the <a href="microbe">microbe</a>s. Many specific formulations are available, because some microbes prefer certain environmental conditions over others. Agar is often dispensed using a sterile <a href="media%20dispenser">media dispenser</a>.

As a gel, an agar or agarose medium is porous and therefore can be used to measure microorganism motility and mobility. The gel's porosity is directly related to the concentration of agarose in the medium, so various levels of effective viscosity (from the cell's "point of view") can be selected, depending on the experimental objectives.

A common identification assay involves culturing a sample of the organism deep within a block of nutrient agar. Cells will attempt to grow within the gel structure. Motile species will be able to migrate, albeit slowly, throughout the gel and infiltration rates can then be visualized, whereas non-motile species will show growth only along the now-empty path introduced by the invasive initial sample deposition.

Another setup commonly used for measuring chemotaxis and chemokinesis utilizes the under-agarose cell migration assay, whereby a layer of agarose gel is placed between a cell population and a chemoattractant. As a concentration gradient develops from the diffusion of the chemoattractant into the gel, various cell populations requiring different stimulation levels to migrate can then be visualized over time using microphotography as they tunnel upward through the gel against gravity along the gradient.

Agar-agar is a natural vegetable <a href="gelatin">gelatin</a> counterpart. White and semi-<a href="translucent">translucent</a>, it is sold in packages as washed and dried strips or in powdered form. It can be used to make jellies, <a href="puddings">puddings</a>, and <a href="custard">custard</a>s. For making jelly, it is boiled in water until the solids dissolve. Sweetener, flavouring, colouring, fruit or vegetables are then added and the liquid is poured into <a href="molding%20%28process%29">molds</a> to be served as desserts and vegetable <a href="aspic">aspic</a>s, or incorporated with other desserts, such as a jelly layer in a <a href="cake">cake</a>.

Agar-agar is approximately 80% fiber, so it can serve as an intestinal regulator. Its bulk quality is behind one of the latest fad diets in Asia, the "kanten" (the Japanese word for agar-agar) diet. Once ingested, "kanten" triples in size and absorbs water. This results in the consumers feeling fuller. This diet has recently received some press coverage in the United States as well. The diet has shown promise in obesity studies.

One use of agar in <a href="Japanese%20cuisine">Japanese cuisine</a> (<a href="Wagashi">Wagashi</a>) is "<a href="anmitsu">anmitsu</a>", a dessert made of small cubes of agar jelly and served in a bowl with various fruits or other ingredients. It is also the main ingredient in "mizu yōkan", another popular Japanese food.

In <a href="Philippine%20cuisine">Philippine cuisine</a>, it is used to make the jelly bars in the various <a href="gulaman">gulaman</a> refreshments or desserts such as "sago gulaman", "buko pandan", "agar flan", "<a href="halo-halo">halo-halo</a>", and the black and red "gulaman" used in various fruit salads.

In <a href="Vietnamese%20cuisine">Vietnamese cuisine</a>, jellies made of flavored layers of agar agar, called "thạch", are a popular dessert, and are often made in ornate molds for special occasions. In <a href="Indian%20cuisine">Indian cuisine</a>, agar agar is known as "China grass" and is used for making desserts. In <a href="Burmese%20cuisine">Burmese cuisine</a>, a sweet jelly known as "kyauk kyaw" ) ) is made from agar.

In Russia, it is used in addition or as a replacement to <a href="pectin">pectin</a> in jams and marmalades, as a substitute to gelatin for its superior gelling properties, and as a strengthening ingredient in souffles and custards. Another use of agar-agar is in "ptich'ye moloko" (<a href="bird%27s%20milk">bird's milk</a>), a rich jellified custard (or soft <a href="meringue">meringue</a>) used as a cake filling or chocolate-glazed as individual sweets. Agar-agar may also be used as the gelling agent in gel clarification, a culinary technique used to clarify stocks, sauces, and other liquids.

<a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> has traditional candies made out of Agar gelatin, most of them in colorful, half-circle shapes that resemble a <a href="melon">melon</a> or <a href="watermelon">watermelon</a> fruit slice, and commonly covered with sugar. They are known in Spanish as "Dulce de Agar" (Agar sweets)

Agar-agar is an allowed nonorganic/nonsynthetic additive used as a thickener, gelling agent, texturizer, moisturizer, emulsifier, flavor enhancer, and absorbent in certified organic foods.

Research grade agar is used extensively in plant biology as it is supplemented with a nutrient and vitamin mixture that allows for seedling germination in Petri dishes under sterile conditions (given that the seeds are sterilized as well). Nutrient and vitamin supplementation for "<a href="Arabidopsis%20thaliana">Arabidopsis thaliana</a>" is standard across most experimental conditions. <a href="Murashige%20and%20Skoog%20medium">Murashige & Skoog</a> (MS) nutrient mix and Gamborg's B5 vitamin mix in general are used. A 1.0% agar/0.44% MS+vitamin dHO solution is suitable for growth media between normal growth temps.

When using agar, within any growth medium, it is important to know that the solidification of the agar is pH-dependent. The optimal range for solidification is between 5.4-5.7. Usually, the application of KOH is needed to increase the pH to this range. A general guideline is about 600 µl 0.1M KOH per 250 ml GM. This entire mixture can be sterilized using the liquid cycle of an <a href="autoclave">autoclave</a>.

This medium nicely lends itself to the application of specific concentrations of phytohormones etc. to induce specific growth patterns in that one can easily prepare a solution containing the desired amount of hormone, add it to the known volume of GM, and autoclave to both sterilize and evaporate off any solvent that may have been used to dissolve the often-polar hormones. This hormone/GM solution can be spread across the surface of Petri dishes sown with germinated and/or etiolated seedlings.

Experiments with the <a href="moss">moss</a> "<a href="Physcomitrella%20patens">Physcomitrella patens</a>", however, have shown that choice of the gelling agent — agar or <a href="Gellan%20gum">Gelrite</a> - does influence <a href="phytohormone">phytohormone</a> sensitivity of the <a href="plant">plant</a> <a href="cell%20culture">cell culture</a>.

Acid rain

Acid rain is a <a href="rain">rain</a> or any other form of <a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> that is unusually <a href="acid">acid</a>ic, meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions (low <a href="pH">pH</a>). It can have harmful effects on plants, aquatic animals and infrastructure. Acid rain is caused by emissions of <a href="sulfur%20dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> and <a href="nitrogen%20oxide">nitrogen oxide</a>, which react with the <a href="Properties%20of%20water">water molecules</a> in the <a href="atmosphere">atmosphere</a> to produce acids. Some governments have made efforts since the 1970s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere with positive results. Nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by <a href="lightning">lightning</a> strikes, and sulfur dioxide is produced by <a href="Types%20of%20volcanic%20eruptions">volcanic eruptions</a>. Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms, causing paint to peel, <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a> of steel structures such as bridges, and <a href="weathering">weathering</a> of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health.

"Acid rain" is a popular term referring to the deposition of a mixture from wet (rain, snow, sleet, fog, cloudwater, and dew) and dry (acidifying particles and gases) acidic components. <a href="Distilled%20water">Distilled water</a>, once <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> is removed, has a neutral pH of 7. Liquids with a pH less than 7 are acidic, and those with a <a href="pH">pH</a> greater than 7 are alkaline. "Clean" or unpolluted rain has an acidic pH, but usually no lower than 5.7, because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form <a href="carbonic%20acid">carbonic acid</a>, a weak acid according to the following reaction:

Carbonic acid then can ionize in water forming low concentrations of <a href="hydronium">hydronium</a> and <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a> ions:

However, unpolluted rain can also contain other chemicals which affect its pH (acidity level). A common example is <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> produced by <a href="electric%20discharge">electric discharge</a> in the atmosphere such as <a href="lightning">lightning</a>. Acid deposition as an <a href="environmental%20issue">environmental issue</a> (discussed later in the article) would include additional acids other than .

The corrosive effect of polluted, acidic city air on limestone and marble was noted in the 17th century by <a href="John%20Evelyn">John Evelyn</a>, who remarked upon the poor condition of the <a href="Arundel%20marbles">Arundel marbles</a>.
Since the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere have increased. In 1852, <a href="Robert%20Angus%20Smith">Robert Angus Smith</a> was the first to show the relationship between acid rain and atmospheric pollution in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, <a href="England">England</a>.

Though acidic rain was discovered in 1853, it was not until the late 1960s that scientists began widely observing and studying the phenomenon. The term "acid rain" was coined in 1872 by Robert Angus Smith. Canadian Harold Harvey was among the first to research a "dead" lake. Public awareness of acid rain in the U.S increased in the 1970s after <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a> published reports from the <a href="Hubbard%20Brook%20Experimental%20Forest">Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest</a> in <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> of the myriad deleterious environmental effects shown to result from it.

Occasional pH readings in rain and fog water of well below 2.4 have been reported in industrialized areas. Industrial acid rain is a substantial problem in <a href="China">China</a> and <a href="Russia">Russia</a> and areas downwind from them. These areas all burn sulfur-containing <a href="coal">coal</a> to generate heat and electricity.

The problem of acid rain has not only increased with population and industrial growth, but has become more widespread. The use of tall smokestacks to reduce local <a href="pollution">pollution</a> has contributed to the spread of acid rain by releasing gases into regional atmospheric circulation. Often deposition occurs a considerable distance downwind of the emissions, with mountainous regions tending to receive the greatest deposition (simply because of their higher rainfall). An example of this effect is the low pH of rain which falls in <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>.

The earliest report about acid rain in the United States was from the chemical evidence from <a href="Hubbard%20Brook%20Experimental%20Forest">Hubbard Brook</a> Valley. In 1972, a group of scientists including <a href="Gene%20Likens">Gene Likens</a> discovered the rain that was deposited at White Mountains of New Hampshire was acidic. The pH of the sample was measured to be 4.03 at Hubbard Brook. The Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study followed up with a series of research that analyzed the environmental effects of acid rain. Acid rain that mixed with stream water at Hubbard Brook was neutralized by the alumina from soils. The result of this research indicates the chemical reaction between acid rain and aluminum leads to increasing rate of soil weathering. Experimental research was done to examine the effects of increased acidity in stream on ecological species. In 1980, a group of scientists modified the acidity of Norris Brook, New Hampshire, and observed the change in species’ behaviors. There was a decrease in species diversity, an increase in community dominants, and a decrease in the <a href="food%20web">food web</a> complexity.

In 1980, the U.S. Congress passed an <a href="Acid%20Deposition%20Act">Acid Deposition Act</a>. This Act established an 18-year assessment and research program under the direction of the National Acidic Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP). NAPAP looked at the entire problem from a scientific perspective. It enlarged a network of monitoring sites to determine how acidic the precipitation actually was, and to determine long-term trends, and established a network for dry deposition. It looked at the effects of acid rain and funded research on the effects of acid precipitation on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, historical buildings, monuments, and building materials. It also funded extensive studies on atmospheric processes and potential control programs.

From the start, policy advocates from all sides attempted to influence NAPAP activities to support their particular policy advocacy efforts, or to disparage those of their opponents. For the U.S. Government's scientific enterprise, a significant impact of NAPAP were lessons learned in the assessment process and in environmental research management to a relatively large group of scientists, program managers and the public.

In 1981, the National Academy of Sciences was looking into research about the controversial issues regarding acid rain. President Ronald Reagan did not place a huge attention on the issues of acid rain until his personal visit to Canada and confirmed that Canadian border suffered from the drifting pollution from smokestacks in Midwest of US. Reagan honored the agreement to <a href="Canadian%20Prime%20Minister">Canadian Prime Minister</a> <a href="Pierre%20Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a>’s enforcement of anti-pollution regulation. In 1982, US President Ronald Reagan commissioned <a href="William%20Nierenberg">William Nierenberg</a> to sit on <a href="National%20Science%20Board">National Science Board</a>. Nierenberg selected scientists including Gene Likens to sit on a panel to draft a report on acid rain. In 1983, the panel of scientists came up with a draft report, which concluded that acid rain is a real problem and solutions should be sought. White House <a href="Office%20of%20Science%20and%20Technology%20Policy">Office of Science and Technology Policy</a> reviewed the draft report and sent <a href="Fred%20Singer">Fred Singer</a>’s suggestions of the report, which cast doubt on the cause of acid rain. The panelists revealed rejections against Singer’s positions and submitted the report to Nirenberg in April. In May 1983, the House of Representatives voted against legislations that aimed to control sulfur emissions. There was a debate about whether Nierenberg delayed to release the report. Nierenberg himself denied the saying about his suppression of the report and explained that the withheld of the report after the House's vote was due to the fact that the report was not ready to be published.

In 1991, DENR provided its first assessment of acid rain in the United States. It reported that 5% of New England Lakes were acidic, with sulfates being the most common problem. They noted that 2% of the lakes could no longer support Brook Trout, and 6% of the lakes were unsuitable for the survival of many species of minnow. Subsequent Reports to Congress have documented chemical changes in soil and freshwater ecosystems, nitrogen saturation, decreases in amounts of nutrients in soil, episodic acidification, regional haze, and damage to historical monuments.

Meanwhile, in 1989, the U.S. Congress passed a series of amendments to the Clean Air Act. Title IV of these amendments established the <a href="Acid%20Rain%20Program">Acid Rain Program</a>, a <a href="cap%20and%20trade">cap and trade</a> system designed to control emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Title IV called for a total reduction of about 10 million tons of SO emissions from power plants. It was implemented in two phases. Phase I began in 1995, and limited sulfur dioxide emissions from 110 of the largest power plants to a combined total of 8.7 million tons of sulfur dioxide. One power plant in New England (Merrimack) was in Phase I. Four other plants (Newington, Mount Tom, Brayton Point, and Salem Harbor) were added under other provisions of the program. Phase II began in 2000, and affects most of the power plants in the country.

During the 1990s, research continued. On March 10, 2005, the <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">EPA</a> issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). This rule provides states with a solution to the problem of power plant pollution that drifts from one state to another. CAIR will permanently cap emissions of SO and NO in the eastern United States. When fully implemented, CAIR will reduce SO emissions in 28 eastern states and the District of Columbia by over 70% and NO emissions by over 60% from 2003 levels.

Overall, the program's cap and trade program has been successful in achieving its goals. Since the 1990s, SO emissions have dropped 40%, and according to the <a href="Pacific%20Research%20Institute">Pacific Research Institute</a>, acid rain levels have dropped 65% since 1976. Conventional regulation was used in the European Union, which saw a decrease of over 70% in SO emissions during the same time period.

In 2007, total SO emissions were 8.9 million tons, achieving the program's long-term goal ahead of the 2010 statutory deadline.

In 2007 the EPA estimated that by 2010, the overall costs of complying with the program for businesses and consumers would be $1 billion to $2 billion a year, only one fourth of what was originally predicted. Forbes says: "In 2010, by which time the cap and trade system had been augmented by the George W. Bush administration’s Clean Air Interstate Rule, SO2 emissions had fallen to 5.1 million tons.

The term <a href="Citizen%20science">Citizen science</a> can be traced back as far as January 1989 and a campaign by the <a href="National%20Audubon%20Society">Audubon Society</a> to measure Acid rain. Scientist Muki Haklay cites in a policy report for the <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson%20International%20Center%20for%20Scholars">Wilson Center</a> entitled 'Citizen Science and Policy: A European Perspective' a first use of the term 'citizen science' by R. Kerson in the magazine <a href="MIT%20Technology%20Review">MIT Technology Review</a> from January 1989. Quoting from the Wilson Center report: "The new form of engagement in science received the name "citizen science". The first recorded example of the use of the term is from 1989, describing how 225 volunteers across the US collected rain samples to assist the Audubon Society in an acid-rain awareness raising campaign. The volunteers collected samples, checked for acidity, and reported back to the organization. The information was then used to demonstrate the full extent of the phenomenon."

The most important gas which leads to acidification is sulfur dioxide. Emissions of nitrogen oxides which are oxidized to form <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> are of increasing importance due to stricter controls on emissions of sulfur containing compounds. 70 Tg(S) per year in the form of SO comes from <a href="fossil%20fuel">fossil fuel</a> combustion and industry, 2.8 Tg(S) from <a href="wildfires">wildfires</a> and 7–8 Tg(S) per year from <a href="volcanoes">volcanoes</a>.

The principal natural <a href="phenomena">phenomena</a> that contribute acid-producing gases to the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">atmosphere</a> are emissions from volcanoes. Thus, for example, <a href="fumarole">fumarole</a>s from the Laguna Caliente crater of <a href="Po%C3%A1s%20Volcano">Poás Volcano</a> create extremely high amounts of acid rain and fog, with acidity as high as a pH of 2, clearing an area of any vegetation and frequently causing irritation to the eyes and lungs of inhabitants in nearby settlements.
Acid-producing gasses are also created by <a href="biology">biological</a> processes that occur on the land, in <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s, and in the <a href="ocean">ocean</a>s. The major biological source of sulfur containing compounds is <a href="dimethyl%20sulfide">dimethyl sulfide</a>.

Nitric acid in <a href="rainwater">rainwater</a> is an important source of fixed <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> for plant life, and is also produced by electrical activity in the atmosphere such as <a href="lightning">lightning</a>.

Acidic deposits have been detected in <a href="glacier">glacial ice</a> thousands of years old in remote parts of the globe.

Soils of <a href="coniferous%20forests">coniferous forests</a> are naturally very acidic due to the shedding of needles, and the results of this phenomenon should not be confused with acid rain.

The principal cause of acid rain is sulfur and nitrogen compounds from human sources, such as <a href="electricity%20generation">electricity generation</a>, factories, and <a href="motor%20vehicle">motor vehicle</a>s. Electrical power generation using coal is among the greatest contributors to gaseous pollutions that are responsible for acidic rain. The gases can be carried hundreds of kilometers in the atmosphere before they are converted to acids and deposited. In the past, factories had short funnels to let out smoke but this caused many problems locally; thus, factories now have taller smoke funnels. However, dispersal from these taller stacks causes pollutants to be carried farther, causing widespread ecological damage.

Combustion of fuels produces sulfur dioxide and nitric oxides. They are converted into sulfuric acid and nitric acid.

In the <a href="gas%20phase">gas phase</a> sulfur dioxide is oxidized by reaction with the <a href="hydroxyl">hydroxyl</a> radical via an <a href="intermolecular">intermolecular</a> reaction:
which is followed by:
In the presence of water, <a href="sulfur%20trioxide">sulfur trioxide</a> (SO) is converted rapidly to <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a>:

<a href="Nitrogen%20dioxide">Nitrogen dioxide</a> reacts with OH to form nitric acid:

When clouds are present, the loss rate of SO is faster than can be explained by gas phase chemistry alone. This is due to reactions in the liquid water droplets.


Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water and then, like carbon dioxide, <a href="hydrolysis">hydrolyses</a> in a series of <a href="Chemical%20equilibrium">equilibrium</a> reactions:


There are a large number of aqueous reactions that <a href="redox">oxidize</a> sulfur from S(<a href="oxidation%20state">IV</a>) to S(VI), leading to the formation of sulfuric acid. The most important oxidation reactions are with <a href="ozone">ozone</a>, <a href="hydrogen%20peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a> and <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> (reactions with oxygen are catalyzed by <a href="iron">iron</a> and <a href="manganese">manganese</a> in the cloud droplets).

Wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation (rain, snow, and so on.) removes acids from the atmosphere and delivers it to the Earth's surface. This can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops (see aqueous phase chemistry above) or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds. Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition.

Acid deposition also occurs via dry deposition in the absence of precipitation. This can be responsible for as much as 20 to 60% of total acid deposition. This occurs when particles and gases stick to the ground, plants or other surfaces.

Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests, freshwaters and soils, killing insect and aquatic life-forms as well as causing damage to buildings and having impacts on human health.

Both the lower pH and higher aluminium concentrations in surface water that occur as a result of acid rain can cause damage to fish and other aquatic animals. At pHs lower than 5 most fish eggs will not hatch and lower pHs can kill adult fish. As lakes and rivers become more acidic biodiversity is reduced. Acid rain has eliminated insect life and some fish species, including the <a href="brook%20trout">brook trout</a> in some lakes, streams, and creeks in geographically sensitive areas, such as the Adirondack Mountains of the United States. However, the extent to which acid rain contributes directly or indirectly via runoff from the catchment to lake and river acidity (i.e., depending on characteristics of the surrounding watershed) is variable. The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) website states: "Of the lakes and streams surveyed, acid rain caused acidity in 75% of the acidic lakes and about 50% of the acidic streams".

Soil biology and chemistry can be seriously damaged by acid rain. Some microbes are unable to tolerate changes to low pH and are killed. The <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s of these microbes are <a href="Denaturation%20%28biochemistry%29">denatured</a> (changed in shape so they no longer function) by the acid. The hydronium ions of acid rain also mobilize <a href="toxin">toxin</a>s such as aluminium, and leach away essential nutrients and minerals such as <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>.

Soil chemistry can be dramatically changed when base cations, such as calcium and magnesium, are leached by acid rain thereby affecting sensitive species, such as <a href="sugar%20maple">sugar maple</a> (<a href="Acer%20saccharum">Acer saccharum</a>).

Adverse effects may be indirectly related to acid rain, like the acid's effects on soil (see above) or high concentration of gaseous precursors to acid rain. High altitude forests are especially vulnerable as they are often surrounded by clouds and fog which are more acidic than rain.

Other plants can also be damaged by acid rain, but the effect on food crops is minimized by the application of lime and fertilizers to replace lost nutrients. In cultivated areas, limestone may also be added to increase the ability of the soil to keep the pH stable, but this tactic is largely unusable in the case of wilderness lands. When calcium is leached from the needles of red spruce, these trees become less cold tolerant and exhibit winter injury and even death.

Acid rain has a much less harmful effect on the oceans. However, acid rain can cause the oceans acidity to rise, making it more difficult for different coastal species to create their <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>s that they need to survive. These coastal species link together as part of the ocean's food chain and without them being a source for other marine life to feed off of more marine life will die.

Coral's limestone skeletal is sensitive to pH drop, because the <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a>, core component of the limestone dissolves in acidic (low pH) solutions.

Acid rain does not directly affect human health. The acid in the rainwater is too dilute to have direct adverse effects. However, the particulates responsible for acid rain (sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides) do have an adverse effect. Increased amounts of fine particulate matter in the air do contribute to heart and lung problems including <a href="asthma">asthma</a> and <a href="bronchitis">bronchitis</a>.

Acid rain can damage buildings, historic monuments, and statues, especially those made of rocks, such as <a href="limestone">limestone</a> and <a href="marble">marble</a>, that contain large amounts of calcium carbonate. Acids in the rain react with the calcium compounds in the stones to create gypsum, which then flakes off.

The effects of this are commonly seen on old gravestones, where acid rain can cause the inscriptions to become completely illegible. Acid rain also increases the <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a> rate of metals, in particular <a href="iron">iron</a>, <a href="steel">steel</a>, <a href="copper">copper</a> and <a href="bronze">bronze</a>.

Places significantly impacted by acid rain around the globe include most of eastern Europe from Poland northward into Scandinavia, the eastern third of the United States, and southeastern <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. Other affected areas include the southeastern coast of China and <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>.

Many coal-firing <a href="power%20station">power station</a>s use <a href="flue-gas%20desulfurization">flue-gas desulfurization</a> (FGD) to remove sulfur-containing gases from their stack gases. For a typical coal-fired power station, FGD will remove 95% or more of the SO in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the wet scrubber which is commonly used. A wet scrubber is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulfur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral <a href="calcium%20sulfate">calcium sulfate</a> that is physically removed from the scrubber. That is, the scrubber turns sulfur pollution into industrial sulfates.

In some areas the sulfates are sold to chemical companies as <a href="gypsum">gypsum</a> when the purity of calcium sulfate is high. In others, they are placed in <a href="landfill">landfill</a>. However, the effects of acid rain can last for generations, as the effects of pH level change can stimulate the continued leaching of undesirable chemicals into otherwise pristine water sources, killing off vulnerable insect and fish species and blocking efforts to <a href="Restoration%20ecology">restore</a> native life.

<a href="Fluidized%20bed%20combustion">Fluidized bed combustion</a> also reduces the amount of sulfur emitted by power production.

<a href="Vehicle%20emissions%20control">Vehicle emissions control</a> reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides from motor vehicles.

A number of international treaties on the long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants have been agreed for example, the <a href="1985%20Helsinki%20Protocol%20on%20the%20Reduction%20of%20Sulphur%20Emissions">1985 Helsinki Protocol on the Reduction of Sulphur Emissions</a> under the <a href="Convention%20on%20Long-Range%20Transboundary%20Air%20Pollution">Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution</a>. Canada and the US signed the <a href="Air%20Quality%20Agreement">Air Quality Agreement</a> in 1991. Most European countries and Canada have signed the treaties.

In this regulatory scheme, every current polluting facility is given or may purchase on an open market an emissions allowance for each unit of a designated pollutant it emits. Operators can then install pollution control equipment, and sell portions of their emissions allowances they no longer need for their own operations, thereby recovering some of the capital cost of their investment in such equipment. The intention is to give operators economic incentives to install pollution controls.

The first emissions trading market was established in the United States by enactment of the <a href="Clean%20Air%20Act%20%28United%20States%29">Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990</a>. The overall goal of the Acid Rain Program established by the Act is to achieve significant environmental and public health benefits through reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO) and nitrogen oxides (NO), the primary causes of acid rain. To achieve this goal at the lowest cost to society, the program employs both regulatory and market based approaches for controlling air pollution.

The term applied to a 5th-century faction among the <a href="Eutychians">Eutychians</a>, who seceded from Peter, a Monophysite or more accurately a <a href="Miaphysite">Miaphysite</a>, in 482, after Peter signed the "Henoticon" and was recognised by Zeno as the legitimate patriarch of Alexandria by which they were "deprived of their head".

The condemnation of Eutyches irritated the rigid Monophysites; the equivocal attitude taken towards the Council of Chalcedon appeared to them insufficient, and many of them, especially the monks, deserted Peter, preferring to be without a head, rather than remain in communion with him.
Later, they joined the adherents of the non-Chalcedonian Patriarch <a href="Severus%20of%20Antioch">Severus of Antioch</a>.
They were, according to "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary%20Online">Oxford English Dictionary Online</a>", a "group of extreme Monophysites" and "were absorbed by the Jacobites".

<a href="Liberatus%20of%20Carthage">Liberatus of Carthage</a> wrote, in ', that those at the <a href="Council%20of%20Ephesus">Council of Ephesus</a> who followed neither <a href="Patriarch%20Cyril%20I%20of%20Alexandria">Patriarch Cyril I of Alexandria</a> nor <a href="Patriarch%20John%20I%20of%20Antioch">Patriarch John I of Antioch</a> were called '.

Esaianites were one of the sects into which the Alexandrian " separated at the end of the 5th century. They were the followers of Esaias, a deacon of Palestine, who claimed to have been consecrated to the episcopal office by the Bishop Eusebius. His opponents averred that after the bishop's death his hands had been laid upon the head of Esaias by some of his friends.

' were a sect of ' who followed Chalcedonian <a href="Patriarch%20Paul%20of%20Alexandria">Patriarch Paul of Alexandria</a>, who was deposed by a synod at Gaza, in 541, for his uncanonical consecration by the Patriarch of Constantinople, and who, after his deposition, sided with the Miaphysites.

Barsanians, later called Semidalites, were a sect of " at the end of the 5th century. They had no succession of priests, and professed to keep up the celebration of a valid Eucharist by placing a few crumbs of some of the bread which had been consecrated by <a href="Antipope%20Dioscorus">Dioscorus</a> into a vessel of meal, and then using as fully consecrated the bread baked from it.

According to Brewer, acephalites were also certain bishops exempt from the jurisdiction and discipline of their patriarch. Cooper explains that they are "priests rejecting episcopal authority or bishops that of their metropolitans." Blunt described "" as those clergy who were ordained with a <a href="sinecure">sinecure</a> <a href="benefice">benefice</a> and who generally obtained their orders by paying for them, that is by <a href="simony">simony</a>. The Council of Pavia, in 853, legislated its canons 18 and 23 against them, from which it appears, according to Blunt, that they were mostly chaplains to noblemen, that they produced much scandal in the Church, and that they disseminated many errors.

According to Brewer, acephalites were also a sect of <a href="Levellers">Levellers</a> during the reign of <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I of England</a> who acknowledged no leader.

Anthony of Saxony

Anthony (27 December 1755 in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> – 6 June 1836 in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>), also known by his German name Anton (full name: "Anton Clemens Theodor Maria Joseph Johann Evangelista Johann Nepomuk Franz Xavier Aloys Januar"), was a <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Saxony">King of Saxony</a> (1827–1836) from the <a href="House%20of%20Wettin">House of Wettin</a>. He became known as "Anton der Gütige", (en: "Anthony the Kind").

He was the fifth but third surviving son of <a href="Frederick%20Christian%2C%20Elector%20of%20Saxony">Frederick Christian, Elector of Saxony</a>, and <a href="Maria%20Antonia%20of%20Bavaria">Maria Antonia of Bavaria</a>.

With few chances to take part in the politics of the Electorate of Saxony or receive any land from his older brother Frederick Augustus III, Anton lived under the shadows. No Elector of Saxony after Johann Georg I gave appananges to his younger sons.

During the first years of the reign of his older brother as Elector, Anton was the third in line, preceded only by his older brother Karl. The death of Karl (8 September 1781) make him the next in line to the Electorate as Crown Prince (de: "Kronprinz"); this was because all the pregnancies of the Electress Amalie, except for one daughter, ended in a stillbirth.

His aunt, the <a href="Maria%20Josepha%20of%20Saxony%20%281731%E2%80%931767%29">Dauphine of France</a>, had wanted to engage her daughter <a href="Princess%20Marie%20Z%C3%A9phyrine%20of%20France">Marie Zéphyrine of France</a> to Anthony; Marie Zéphyrine died in 1755 abandoning plans. Another French candidate was Marie Zéphyrine's sister <a href="Clotilde%20de%20France">Marie Clothilde</a> (later <a href="Queen%20of%20Sardinia">Queen of Sardinia</a>) but again nothing happened.

In <a href="Turin">Turin</a> on 29 September 1781 (by proxy) and again in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> on 24 October 1781 (in person), Anton married firstly with the Princess <a href="Caroline%20of%20Savoy">Caroline of Savoy</a> (Maria Carolina Antonietta Adelaida), daughter of the King <a href="Victor%20Amadeus%20III%20of%20Sardinia">Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia</a> and <a href="Maria%20Antonietta%20of%20Spain">Maria Antonietta of Spain</a>. Caroline died after only one year of marriage, on 28 December 1782 having succumbed to <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>. They had no children.

In <a href="Florence">Florence</a> on 8 September 1787 (by proxy) and again in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> on 18 October 1787 (in person), Anton married a second time with the Archduchess <a href="Maria%20Theresa%20of%20Austria%20%281767%E2%80%931827%29">Maria Theresia of Austria</a> (Maria Theresia Josephe Charlotte Johanna), daughter of the Grand Duke Leopold I of Tuscany, later <a href="Leopold%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Leopold II</a>. <a href="Mozart">Mozart</a>'s opera "<a href="Don%20Giovanni">Don Giovanni</a>" was originally intended to be performed in honor of Anton and his wife for a visit to <a href="Prague">Prague</a> on 14 October 1787, as they traveled between Dresden and <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, and <a href="libretto">libretto</a>s were printed with dedication to them. The <a href="premiere">premiere</a> could not be arranged in time, however, so the opera "<a href="The%20Marriage%20of%20Figaro">The Marriage of Figaro</a>" was substituted on the express orders of the bride's uncle, Holy Roman Emperor <a href="Joseph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Joseph II</a>. The choice of "The Marriage of Figaro" was considered improper for a new bride by many observers, and the couple left the opera theater early without seeing the entire work performed. Mozart complained bitterly of the intrigues surrounding this incident in a letter to his friend Gottfried von Jacquin that was written in stages between 15 October and 25 October 1787. Anthony was also present in Prague in September 1791 for the first performance of Mozart's opera "<a href="La%20clemenza%20di%20Tito">La clemenza di Tito</a>", which was written as part of the coronation ceremonies of his father-in-law, Holy Roman Emperor <a href="Leopold%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Leopold II</a>, as <a href="King%20of%20Bohemia">King of Bohemia</a>.

The couple had four children, but none survived to the age of two:

The Electress gave birth for last time in 1799 to another stillborn child. After this Anton became, officially, the Heir to the Electorate and, from 1806, the Kingdom of Saxony.

Anton succeeded his brother Frederick August I as King of Saxony when he died, on 5 May 1827. The 71-year-old new king was completely inexperienced in government, thus he had no intention of initiating profound changes in foreign or domestic policy.

<a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussian</a> diplomats discussed granting the <a href="Rhine%20Province">Prussian Rhineland</a> (predominantly <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a>) to Anton (a Catholic) in exchange for <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> Saxony in 1827, but nothing came of these talks.

After the <a href="July%20Revolution">July Revolution</a> of 1830 in France, disturbances in Saxony began in autumn. These were directed primarily against the old Constitution. Therefore, on 13 September the cabinet dismissed Count <a href="Detlev%20von%20Einsiedel">Detlev von Einsiedel</a>, followed by <a href="Bernhard%20von%20Lindenau">Bernhard von Lindenau</a>. Because the people wished a younger regent, Anton agreed to appoint his nephew Frederick Augustus Prince Co-Regent (de: "Prinz-Mitregenten"). As another consequence of the disturbances, a new constitution was accepted in 1831 which came into effect on 4 September of that year. With it Saxony became a <a href="Constitutional%20monarchy">Constitutional monarchy</a> and obtained a bi-cameral legislature and a responsible ministry, which replaced the old feudal estates. The constitution was more conservative than other constitutions existing at this time in the German Union. Still the constitution served Saxony until 1918. The king kept his exclusive sovereignty but was bound by the Government Business to cooperate with the Ministers and the decisions of both Chambers of the States (de: "Kammern der Ständeversammlung") meeting. The entry of Saxony into the "<a href="Zollverein">Zollverein</a>" in 1833 let trade, industry and traffic blossom farther.

Without surviving male issue, Anton was succeeded as king by his nephew, <a href="Frederick%20Augustus%20II%20of%20Saxony">Frederick Augustus II</a>.

Albert III, Duke of Saxony

Albert III () (27 January 144312 September 1500) was a <a href="rulers%20of%20Saxony">Duke of Saxony</a>. He was nicknamed Albert the Bold or Albert the Courageous and founded the "Albertine line" of the <a href="House%20of%20Wettin">House of Wettin</a>.

Albert was born in <a href="Grimma">Grimma</a> as the third and youngest son (but fifth child in order of birth) of <a href="Frederick%20II%2C%20Elector%20of%20Saxony">Frederick II the Gentle, Elector of Saxony</a>, and Margarete of Austria, sister of <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor</a>. Later, he was a member of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Golden%20Fleece">Order of the Golden Fleece</a>.

After escaping from the hands of <a href="Kunz%20von%20Kaufungen">Kunz von Kaufungen</a>, who had abducted him together with his brother <a href="Ernest%2C%20Elector%20of%20Saxony">Ernest</a>, he spent some time at the court of the emperor <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick III</a> in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>.

In <a href="Cheb">Eger (Cheb)</a> on 11 November 1464 Albert married <a href="Sidonie%20Podiebrad">Zdenka (Sidonie)</a>, daughter of <a href="George%20of%20Podebrady">George of Podebrady</a>, King of <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>; but failed to obtain the Bohemian Crown on the death of George in 1471. After the death of his father in 1464, Albert and Ernest ruled their lands together, but in 1485 a division was made by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Leipzig">Treaty of Leipzig</a>, and Albert received the <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Meissen">Meissen</a>, together with some adjoining districts, and founded the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin.

Regarded as a capable soldier by the emperor, Albert (in 1475) took a prominent part in the campaign against <a href="Charles%20the%20Bold">Charles the Bold</a>, <a href="Duke%20of%20Burgundy">Duke of Burgundy</a>, and in 1487 <a href="Siege%20of%20Wiener-Neustadt">led an expedition</a> against <a href="Matthias%20Corvinus">Matthias Corvinus</a>, King of Hungary, which failed owing to lack of support on the part of the emperor.

In 1488 he was appointed <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20the%20Habsburg%20Netherlands">Governor</a> of the <a href="Habsburg%20Netherlands">Netherlands</a> (until 1493) and marched with the imperial forces to free the Roman king <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian</a> from his imprisonment at Bruges, and when, in 1489, the King returned to Germany, Albert was left as his representative to prosecute the war against the rebels. He was successful in restoring the authority of Maximilian in <a href="County%20of%20Holland">Holland</a>, <a href="County%20of%20Flanders">Flanders</a>, and <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brabant">Brabant</a>, but failed to obtain any repayment of the large sums of money which he had spent in these campaigns.

His services were rewarded in 1498 when Maximilian bestowed upon him the title of Hereditary Governor ("potestat") of <a href="Friesland">Friesland</a>, but he had to make good his claim by force of arms. He had to a great extent succeeded, and was paying a visit to Saxony, when he was recalled by news of a fresh rising. The duke recaptured <a href="Groningen%20%28city%29">Groningen</a>, but soon afterwards he died at <a href="Emden">Emden</a>. He was buried at Meissen.

Albert, who was a man of great strength and considerable skill in feats of arms, delighted in tournaments and knightly exercises. His loyalty to the emperor Frederick, and the expenses incurred in this connection, aroused some irritation among his subjects, but his rule was a period of prosperity in Saxony.

With his wife Sidonie, Albrecht had nine children:

Arlo Guthrie

Arlo Davy Guthrie (born July 10, 1947) is an American <a href="folk%20music">folk</a> <a href="singer-songwriter">singer-songwriter</a>. Like his father, <a href="Woody%20Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</a>, he is known for singing <a href="protest%20song">songs of protest</a> against social injustice. Guthrie's best-known work is his debut piece, "<a href="Alice%27s%20Restaurant%20Massacree">Alice's Restaurant Massacree</a>", a satirical <a href="talking%20blues">talking blues</a> song about 18 minutes in length that has since become a Thanksgiving anthem. His only top-40 hit was a cover of <a href="Steve%20Goodman">Steve Goodman</a>'s "<a href="City%20of%20New%20Orleans%20%28song%29">City of New Orleans</a>". His song "<a href="Massachusetts%20%28Arlo%20Guthrie%20song%29">Massachusetts</a>" was named the official folk song of the state in which he has lived most of his adult life. Guthrie has also made several acting appearances. He is the father of four children, who have also had careers as musicians.

Guthrie was born in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, New York, the son of the <a href="folk%20singer">folk singer</a> and composer <a href="Woody%20Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</a> and <a href="Marjorie%20Guthrie">Marjorie Mazia Guthrie</a>. His sister is the record producer <a href="Nora%20Guthrie">Nora Guthrie</a>. His mother was a one-time professional dancer with the <a href="Martha%20Graham">Martha Graham Company</a> and founder of the Committee to Combat <a href="Huntington%27s%20disease">Huntington's Disease</a>, the illness from which Woody Guthrie died in 1967. Arlo's father was from a Protestant family and his mother was Jewish. His maternal grandmother was the renowned Yiddish poet <a href="Aliza%20Greenblatt">Aliza Greenblatt</a>.

Guthrie received religious training for his <a href="bar%20mitzvah">bar mitzvah</a> from <a href="Rabbi">Rabbi</a> <a href="Meir%20Kahane">Meir Kahane</a>, who would go on to form the <a href="Jewish%20Defense%20League">Jewish Defense League</a>. "Rabbi Kahane was a really nice, patient teacher," Guthrie later recalled, "but shortly after he started giving me my lessons, he started going haywire. Maybe I was responsible." Guthrie converted to Catholicism in 1977, before embracing interfaith beliefs later in his life.

Guthrie attended Woodward School in <a href="Clinton%20Hill%2C%20Brooklyn">Clinton Hill, Brooklyn</a> from first through eighth grades and later graduated from the <a href="Stockbridge%20School">Stockbridge School</a>, in <a href="Stockbridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Stockbridge, Massachusetts</a>, in 1965. He spent the summer of 1965 in London, eventually meeting <a href="Karl%20Dallas">Karl Dallas</a>, who connected Guthrie with London's folk rock scene and became a lifelong friend of his. He briefly attended <a href="Rocky%20Mountain%20College">Rocky Mountain College</a>, in <a href="Billings%2C%20Montana">Billings, Montana</a>. He received an <a href="Honorary%20Doctorate">Honorary Doctorate</a> from <a href="Siena%20College">Siena College</a> in 1981 and from <a href="Westfield%20State%20College">Westfield State College</a> in 2008.

As a singer, songwriter and lifelong political activist, Guthrie carries on the legacy of his father. He was awarded the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience award on September 26, 1992.

On Thanksgiving Day 1965, while in <a href="Stockbridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Stockbridge, Massachusetts</a>, on vacation from his brief stint in college, Guthrie, then 18 years old, was arrested for <a href="littering">illegally dumping</a> on private property what he described as "a half-ton of garbage" from the home of his friends Ray and <a href="Alice%20Brock">Alice Brock</a> after he discovered the local landfill was closed for the holiday. Guthrie and his collaborator appeared in court, pled guilty to the charges, were levied a nominal fine and picked up the garbage that weekend.

This littering charge would soon serve as the basis for Guthrie's most famous work, "<a href="Alice%27s%20Restaurant%20Massacree">Alice's Restaurant Massacree</a>", a <a href="talking%20blues">talking blues</a> song that lasts 18 minutes and 34 seconds in its original recorded version. Guthrie has pointed out that this was also the exact length of one of the famous gaps in <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>'s <a href="Watergate%20tapes">Watergate tapes</a>, and that Nixon owned a copy of the record. The Alice in the song is <a href="Alice%27s%20Restaurant%23Reality">Alice Brock</a>, who had been a librarian at Arlo's boarding school in the town before opening her restaurant. She now owns an art studio in <a href="Provincetown%2C%20Massachusetts">Provincetown, Massachusetts</a>.

The song lampoons the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> <a href="conscription">draft</a>. However, Guthrie has stated in multiple interviews that the song is more an "anti-stupidity" song than an anti-war song, adding that it is based on a true incident. In the song, Guthrie is called up for a draft examination and rejected as unfit for military service as a result of a criminal record consisting in its entirety of one crime, littering. Alice's restaurant is the subject of the recurrent refrain, but is not mentioned in the story (early drafts of the song explained that the restaurant was a place to hide from the police). On the DVD commentary for the 1969 movie, Guthrie stated that the events presented in the song all actually happened (others, such as the arresting officer, <a href="William%20Obanhein">William Obanhein</a>, disputed this, and Guthrie now notes that he embellished some minor details).

"Alice's Restaurant" was the song that earned Guthrie his first recording contract, after counterculture radio host <a href="Bob%20Fass">Bob Fass</a> began playing a tape recording of one of Guthrie's live performances of the song repeatedly one night in 1967. For a short period after its release in 1967, "Alice's Restaurant" was heavily played on U.S. college and <a href="Counterculture%20of%20the%201960s">counterculture</a> radio stations. It became a symbol of the late 1960s, and for many it defined an attitude and lifestyle that were lived out across the country in the ensuing years. Its leisurely, sassy finger-picking acoustic guitar and rambling lyrics were widely memorized and played by irreverent youth. Many stations in the United States have a Thanksgiving Day tradition of playing "Alice's Restaurant".

A 1969 film, directed and co-written by <a href="Arthur%20Penn">Arthur Penn</a>, was based on the true story told in the song, but with the addition of a large number of fictional scenes. This film, also called "<a href="Alice%27s%20Restaurant%20%28film%29">Alice's Restaurant</a>", featured Arlo and several other figures in the song portraying themselves. The part of his father Woody Guthrie, who had died in 1967, was played by an actor, Joseph Boley; Alice, who made a <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a> as an extra, was also recast, with actress Pat Quinn in the title role (Alice Brock later disowned the film's portrayal of her).

Despite its popularity, the song "Alice's Restaurant Massacree" is not always featured on the set list of any given Guthrie performance. Since putting it back into his setlist in 1984, he has performed the song every ten years, stating in a 2014 interview that the Vietnam War had ended by the 1970s and that everyone who was attending his concerts had likely already heard the song anyway, so (after a brief period in the late 1960s and early 1970s when he replaced the monologue with a fictional one involving "multicolored rainbow roaches") he decided only to do it on special occasions from that point forward.

The "Alice's Restaurant" song was one of a few very long songs to become popular just when albums began replacing hit singles as young people's main music listening. But in 1972 Guthrie had a highly successful single too, <a href="Steve%20Goodman">Steve Goodman</a>'s song "<a href="City%20of%20New%20Orleans%20%28song%29">City of New Orleans</a>", a wistful <a href="paean">paean</a> to long-distance passenger <a href="railway">rail</a> travel. Guthrie's first trip on that train was in December 2005 (when his family joined other musicians on a train trip across the country to raise money for musicians financially devastated by <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> and <a href="Hurricane%20Rita">Hurricane Rita</a>, in the South of the United States). He also had a minor hit with his song "Coming into Los Angeles", which was played at the 1969 <a href="Woodstock%20Festival">Woodstock Festival</a>, and success with a live version of "<a href="The%20Motorcycle%20Song">The Motorcycle Song</a>" (one of the songs on the <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">B-side</a> of the "Alice's Restaurant Album").

In the fall of 1975 during a benefit concert in Massachusetts, Arlo Guthrie performed with his band Shenandoah in public for the first time. They continued to tour and record throughout the 1970s until the early 1990s. Although the band received good reviews, it never gained the popularity that Guthrie did while playing solo. This band is not to be confused with the popular country music group <a href="Shenandoah%20%28band%29">Shenandoah</a>, an entirely different group that had musical hits from 1986 to 2006. Arlo Guthrie's band Shenandoah consisted (after 1976) of David Grover, Steve Ide, Carol Ide, Terry A La Berry and Dan Velika.

Guthrie's 1976 album "<a href="Amigo%20%28Arlo%20Guthrie%20album%29">Amigo</a>" received a 5-star (highest rating) from "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", and may be his best-received work. However, that album, like Guthrie's earlier <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a> albums, is rarely heard today even though each contains strong folk and folk rock music accompanied by widely regarded musicians such as <a href="Ry%20Cooder">Ry Cooder</a>.

A number of musicians from a variety of genres have joined Guthrie onstage, including <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a>, <a href="David%20Bromberg">David Bromberg</a>, <a href="Cyril%20Neville">Cyril Neville</a>, <a href="Emmylou%20Harris">Emmylou Harris</a>, <a href="Willie%20Nelson">Willie Nelson</a>, <a href="Judy%20Collins">Judy Collins</a>, <a href="John%20Prine">John Prine</a>, Wesley Gray, <a href="Josh%20Ritter">Josh Ritter</a>, and others.

Though Guthrie is best known for being a musician, singer, and composer, throughout the years he has also appeared as an actor in films and on television. The film "<a href="Alice%27s%20Restaurant%20%28film%29">Alice's Restaurant</a>" (1969) is his best known role, but he has had small parts in several films and even co-starred in a television drama, "<a href="Byrds%20of%20Paradise">Byrds of Paradise</a>".

Guthrie has had minor roles in several movies and television series. Usually, he has appeared as himself, often performing music and/or being interviewed about the 1960s, folk music and various social causes. His television appearances have included a broad range of programs from "<a href="The%20Muppet%20Show">The Muppet Show</a>" (1979) to "<a href="Politically%20Incorrect">Politically Incorrect</a>" (1998). A rare dramatic film part was in the 1992 movie "<a href="Roadside%20Prophets">Roadside Prophets</a>". Guthrie's memorable appearance at the 1969 <a href="Woodstock%20Festival">Woodstock Festival</a> was documented in the <a href="Michael%20Wadleigh">Michael Wadleigh</a> film "<a href="Woodstock%20%28film%29">Woodstock</a>".

Guthrie also made a pilot for a TV variety show called "The Arlo Guthrie Show" in February 1987. The hour-long program included story telling and musical performances and was filmed in Austin, Texas. It was broadcast nationally on <a href="PBS">PBS</a>. Special guests were Pete Seeger, <a href="Bonnie%20Raitt">Bonnie Raitt</a>, <a href="David%20Bromberg">David Bromberg</a> and <a href="Jerry%20Jeff%20Walker">Jerry Jeff Walker</a>.

In his earlier years, at least from the 1960s to the 1980s, Guthrie had taken a decidedly leftist approach to American politics. In his often lengthy comments during concerts his expressed positions were consistently anti-war, anti-<a href="Richard%20Nixon">Nixon</a>, pro-drugs and in favor of making nuclear power illegal. However, he apparently regarded himself as more an individualist than the major youth culture spokesperson he had been regarded as by the media, as evidenced by the lyrics in his 1979 song "Prologue": "I can remember all of your smiles during the demonstrations, ... and together we sang our victory songs though we were worlds apart." A 1969 rewrite of "Alice's Restaurant" pokes fun at then-former President <a href="Lyndon%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> and his staff.

In 1984, he was the featured celebrity in <a href="George%20McGovern">George McGovern</a>'s <a href="George%20McGovern%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201984">campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination</a> in Guthrie's home state of Massachusetts, performing at rallies and receptions.

Guthrie identified as a registered <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> in 2008. He endorsed Texas Congressman <a href="Ron%20Paul">Ron Paul</a> for the <a href="Results%20of%20the%202008%20Republican%20presidential%20primaries">2008 Republican Party nomination</a>, and said, "I love this guy. Dr. Paul is the only candidate I know of who would have signed the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</a> of the United States had he been there. I'm with him, because he seems to be the only candidate who actually believes it has as much relevance today as it did a couple of hundred years ago. I look forward to the day when we can work out the differences we have with the same revolutionary vision and enthusiasm that is our American legacy." He told "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Magazine">The New York Times Magazine</a>" that he is a Republican because, "We had enough good Democrats. We needed a few more good Republicans. We needed a <a href="loyal%20opposition">loyal opposition</a>."

Commenting on the upcoming 2016 election, Guthrie identified himself as an independent and said he was "equally suspicious of Democrats as I am of Republicans". He declined to endorse a candidate, noting that he personally liked <a href="Bernie%20Sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> despite disagreeing with Sanders' platform, and he admired <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a>'s ability to not rely on campaign donations but did not believe Trump had the best interests of the country in mind.

About once a month, Guthrie posts short writings to the Announcements area of <a href="http%3A//www.arlo.net/">www.arlo.net</a>, often expounding <a href="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> themes.

Like his father, <a href="Woody%20Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</a>, Guthrie often sings <a href="protest%20song">songs of protest</a> against social injustice. He collaborated with poet <a href="Adrian%20Mitchell">Adrian Mitchell</a> to tell the story of Chilean folk singer and activist <a href="V%C3%ADctor%20Jara">Víctor Jara</a> in song. He regularly performed with folk musician Pete Seeger, one of his father's longtime partners. <a href="Ramblin%27%20Jack%20Elliott">Ramblin' Jack Elliott</a>, who had lived for two years in the Guthries' home before Arlo left for boarding school, had absorbed Woody's style perhaps better than anyone; Arlo has been said to have credited Elliott for passing it along to him. 

In 1991, Guthrie bought the church that had served as Alice and Ray Brock's former home in <a href="Great%20Barrington%2C%20Massachusetts">Great Barrington, Massachusetts</a>, and converted it to the Guthrie Center, an interfaith meeting place that serves people of all religions. The center provides weekly free lunches in the community and support for families living with HIV/AIDS as well as other life-threatening illnesses. It also hosts a summertime concert series and Guthrie does six or seven fund raising shows there every year. There are several annual events such as the Walk-A-Thon to Cure Huntington's Disease and a "Thanksgiving Dinner That Can't Be Beat" for families, friends, doctors and scientists who live and work with Huntington's disease.

Guthrie resides in the town of <a href="Washington%2C%20Massachusetts">Washington, Massachusetts</a>, where he and Jackie Hyde, his wife of 43 years, were long time residents. Jackie died on October 14, 2012, after a brief battle with liver cancer. He also has a home in <a href="Sebastian%2C%20Florida">Sebastian, Florida</a>.

Guthrie's son Abe Guthrie and his daughters Annie, <a href="Sarah%20Lee%20Guthrie">Sarah Lee Guthrie</a>, and Cathy Guthrie have also become musicians. Annie Guthrie writes songs and performs, and also takes care of family touring details. Sarah Lee performs and records with her husband <a href="Johnny%20Irion">Johnny Irion</a>. Cathy plays <a href="ukulele">ukulele</a> in <a href="Folk%20Uke">Folk Uke</a>, a group she formed with Amy Nelson, the daughter of <a href="Willie%20Nelson">Willie Nelson</a>. Abe Guthrie was formerly in a folk-rock band called Xavier, and now tours with his father. Abe Guthrie's son, Krishna, is a drummer and toured with Arlo Guthrie on his European tour in 2006 and played guitar for the 2009–2010 Tour. Krishna plays drums in Modest Me. Arlo Guthrie is a grandfather of Abe's son Krishna and daughter Serena, Annie's son Shiva Das (Mo) and daughter Jacklyn, Sarah Lee's daughters Olivia Nora and Sophia Irion and Cathy's daughter Marjorie Maybelle Midwood.

Book of Alma

The Book of Alma () is one of the books that make up the <a href="Book%20of%20Mormon">Book of Mormon</a>. The full title is The Book of Alma: The Son of Alma. The title refers to <a href="Alma%20the%20Younger">Alma the Younger</a>, a prophet and "chief judge" of the Nephites.

The Book of Alma is the longest of all the books of the Book of Mormon, consisting of 63 chapters. The book records the first 39 years of what the <a href="Nephite">Nephite</a>s termed "the reign of the judges", a period in which the Nephite nation adopted a constitutional theocratic government in which the judicial and executive branches of the government were combined.

The history of the book is outlined as follows:

The first four chapters, describe the rebellions of followers of <a href="Nehor">Nehor</a> and <a href="Amlici">Amlici</a>. Contrary to the dominant lay ministry that existed in the Nephite culture, Nehor established a church in which priests were given a separate social status and were paid for their ministry. After killing a religious leader during a theological argument, Nehor was tried and executed for his crimes. The followers of Amlici resented the dominant political and religious parties and sought to reestablish the monarchy that the reign of the judges had replaced. <a href="Alma%20the%20Younger">Alma</a>, who was chief judge, governor, and high priest over the people of Nephi, led an army against Amlici and his followers and drove the rebellion out of the land.

Towards the end of chapter four, Alma realizes that the affairs of the Church require his entire concentration. He resigns from his political office and appoints <a href="Various%20Book%20of%20Mormon%20people%23Nephihah">Nephihah</a> as chief judge and governor of the land. Chapters 5-16 record sermons and missionary travels of Alma between 83 and 78 BC. Alma and one of his converted followers, Amulek, provide important teachings about the atonement of Christ, overcoming pride and the natural man, retaining conversion, the resurrection of all men, and judgment day. Later, their teachings about faith and worship in Alma 32-34 are important sources of instruction and insight.

Chapters 17 to 27 describe the missionary labors of the sons of <a href="King%20Mosiah%20II">King Mosiah II</a> who was the last king over the people of Nephi prior to the peaceful transition of the nation from a monarchy to a republican form of government. The <a href="sons%20of%20Mosiah">sons of Mosiah</a>, named Ammon, <a href="Aaron%20%28Nephite%29">Aaron</a>, <a href="Omner">Omner</a> and <a href="Himni">Himni</a>, chose to devote themselves to missionary labors preaching to the people of the <a href="Lamanite">Lamanite</a> nation, which periodically went to war against the Nephite nation. They lived and taught among the Lamanites between the years 91 and 77 BC.

Chapters 28 to 35 relate the account of a rebellion of a subgroup of the Nephite nation who called themselves <a href="Zoramites">Zoramites</a>. The Zoramites believed in a form of predestination and taught that all others except their people would be damned. Their apostasy from the Church was conjoined with plans to rebel against the Nephite government. Alma took two of his sons, the sons of Mosiah, Amulek, and <a href="Zeezrom">Zeezrom</a> on a mission among the Zoramites in an attempt to restore their loyalty to both the Church and the state. Alma and his companions had some success among the poor class of Zoramites who were then exiled from the Zoramite community by the governing rich class of Zoramites. The wealthier Zoramites eventually defected and united with the Lamanites.

Chapters 36 to 42 record the teachings of Alma to his sons, <a href="Helaman">Helaman</a>, <a href="Shiblon">Shiblon</a>, and <a href="Corianton">Corianton</a>. These teachings discuss the ministry and atonement of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>, the laws of justice and mercy, the need for repentance, and the resurrection and judgment of all people.

Chapters 43 to 62 record the struggles of the Nephite people during a war against the attacking Lamanite nation between the years of 74 and 57 BC. The Chief Captain (senior military commander) of the Nephites during this time was <a href="Captain%20Moroni">Captain Moroni</a>. The Nephites were ultimately successful in their defense against the Lamanites.

Chapter 63 includes concluding historical notes covering the years 56 to 53 BC. This is largely a period of post-war reconstruction and exploration in the Nephite nation.

This outline is based on "main sections" and "<a href="antagonist">antagonist</a> characters" in the Book of Alma. There are two main features in this history, chapters 1 - 42 deal with Missionary Work, and chapters 43 - 63 contain the Wars. The history of the <a href="Zoramites">Zoramites</a> provides a transition from Missionary Work to the War chapters of the Book of Alma. The two main sections also mirror the first two antagonist characters, Nehor ("religious agenda") and Amlici ("political agenda").



In , Alma the Younger speaks to the people of Zarahemla in which he asks 50 rhetorical questions, which are widely cited in the LDS church.

Alma's sermon on faith to the Zoramites in is widely used to explain the process of developing faith. Investigators are invited to try a similar experiment of faith in order to come to develop a testimony. It is worth noting that Alma doesn't actually compare faith to a seed, he compares the word to a seed (), although this is a common misconception.

According to <a href="John%20W.%20Welch">John W. Welch</a>, based on the appearance of the following elements in Alma 12-13, the Nephite temple ceremony utilized familiar temple motifs, including:

<doc id="3277" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3277" title="Antioxidant">
Antioxidant

An antioxidant is a <a href="molecule">molecule</a> that inhibits the <a href="Redox">oxidation</a> of other molecules. Oxidation is a <a href="chemical%20reaction">chemical reaction</a> that can produce <a href="Radical%20%28chemistry%29">free radicals</a>, leading to <a href="chain%20reaction">chain reaction</a>s that may damage <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cells</a>. Antioxidants such as <a href="thiol">thiol</a>s or <a href="ascorbic%20acid">ascorbic acid</a> (vitamin C) terminate these chain reactions. The term "antioxidant" is mainly used for two different groups of substances: industrial chemicals which are added to products to prevent oxidation, and natural chemicals found in foods and body tissue which are said to have beneficial health effects.

To balance the oxidative state, plants and animals maintain complex systems of overlapping antioxidants, such as <a href="glutathione">glutathione</a> and <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s (e.g., <a href="catalase">catalase</a> and <a href="superoxide%20dismutase">superoxide dismutase</a>) produced internally or the dietary antioxidants: <a href="vitamin%20A">vitamin A</a>, vitamin C, and <a href="vitamin%20E">vitamin E</a>.

Antioxidant <a href="dietary%20supplement">dietary supplement</a>s do not improve health nor are they effective in preventing diseases as shown by <a href="randomized%20controlled%20trial">randomized clinical trials</a> including supplements of <a href="beta-carotene">beta-carotene</a>, vitamin A, and vitamin E singly or in different combinations having no effect on <a href="mortality%20rate">mortality rate</a> or <a href="cancer">cancer</a> risk. Supplementation with <a href="selenium">selenium</a> or vitamin E does not reduce the risk of <a href="cardiovascular%20disease">cardiovascular disease</a>. Oxidative stress can be considered as either a cause or consequence of some diseases, an area of research stimulating <a href="drug%20development">drug development</a> for antioxidant compounds for use as potential <a href="therapy">therapies</a>.

Industrial antioxidants have diverse uses, for example as <a href="preservative">preservative</a>s in food and cosmetics and as oxidation inhibitors in fuels.

Although certain levels of antioxidant vitamins in the diet are required for good health, there is considerable debate on whether antioxidant-rich foods or supplements have anti-disease activity. Moreover, if they are actually beneficial, it is unknown which antioxidant(s) are needed from the diet and in what amounts beyond typical dietary intake. Some authors dispute the hypothesis that antioxidant vitamins could prevent chronic diseases, while others maintain such a possibility is unproved and misguided from the beginning.

<a href="Polyphenol">Polyphenol</a>s, which often have antioxidant properties <a href="in%20vitro">in vitro</a>, are not necessarily antioxidants <a href="in%20vivo">in vivo</a> due to extensive metabolism. In many polyphenols, the <a href="catechol">catechol</a> group acts as electron acceptor and is therefore responsible for the antioxidant activity. However, this catechol group undergoes extensive metabolism upon uptake in the human body, for example by <a href="catechol-O-methyl%20transferase">catechol-O-methyl transferase</a>, and is therefore no longer able to act as electron acceptor. Many polyphenols may have non-antioxidant roles in minute concentrations that affect <a href="cell-to-cell%20signaling">cell-to-cell signaling</a>, <a href="receptor%20%28biochemistry%29">receptor</a> sensitivity, <a href="inflammation">inflammatory</a> <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> activity or <a href="gene%20regulation">gene regulation</a>.

Although dietary antioxidants have been investigated for potential effects on <a href="neurodegenerative%20disease">neurodegenerative disease</a>s such as <a href="Alzheimers">Alzheimer's disease</a>, <a href="Parkinsons">Parkinson's disease</a>, and <a href="amyotrophic%20lateral%20sclerosis">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a>, these studies have been inconclusive.

<a href="Tirilazad">Tirilazad</a> is an antioxidant steroid derivative that inhibits the lipid peroxidation that is believed to play a key role in neuronal death in stroke and head injury. It demonstrated activity in animal models of stroke, but human trials demonstrated no effect on mortality or other outcomes in subarachnoid haemorrhage and worsened results in ischemic stroke.

Similarly, the designed antioxidant NXY-059 exhibited efficacy in animal models, but failed to improve stroke outcomes in a clinical trial. As of November 2014, other antioxidants are being studied as potential neuroprotectants.

Common pharmaceuticals (and supplements) with antioxidant properties may interfere with the efficacy of certain anticancer medication and radiation.

A 2016 <a href="systematic%20review">systematic review</a> examined antioxidant medications, such as <a href="allopurinol">allopurinol</a> and <a href="acetylcysteine">acetylcysteine</a>, as add on treatment for schizophrenia. Evidence was insufficient to determine benefits and there was potential for <a href="adverse%20effects">adverse effects</a>.

A 2000 review reported that vitamin E supplementation provided no benefits to physical performance among athletes. Antioxidant supplementation may reduce the cardiovascular benefits of exercise.

Relatively strong reducing acids can have <a href="antinutrient">antinutrient</a> effects by binding to <a href="dietary%20mineral">dietary mineral</a>s such as <a href="iron">iron</a> and <a href="zinc">zinc</a> in the <a href="Human%20gastrointestinal%20tract">gastrointestinal tract</a> and preventing them from being absorbed. Notable examples are <a href="oxalic%20acid">oxalic acid</a>, <a href="tannin">tannin</a>s and <a href="phytic%20acid">phytic acid</a>, which are high in plant-based diets. <a href="Calcium">Calcium</a> and iron deficiencies are not uncommon in diets in <a href="developing%20country">developing countries</a> where less meat is eaten and there is high consumption of phytic acid from beans and unleavened <a href="whole%20grain">whole grain</a> bread.

<a href="Nonpolar">Nonpolar</a> antioxidants such as <a href="eugenol">eugenol</a>—a major component of <a href="oil%20of%20cloves">oil of cloves</a>—have toxicity limits that can be exceeded with the misuse of undiluted <a href="essential%20oil">essential oil</a>s. Toxicity associated with high doses of water-soluble antioxidants such as ascorbic acid are less of a concern, as these compounds can be excreted rapidly in <a href="urine">urine</a>. More seriously, very high doses of some antioxidants may have harmful long-term effects. The beta-carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) study of lung cancer patients found that smokers given supplements containing beta-carotene and vitamin A had increased rates of lung cancer. Subsequent studies confirmed these adverse effects.

These harmful effects may also be seen in non-smokers, as a recent <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> including data from approximately 230,000 patients showed that β-carotene, vitamin A or vitamin E supplementation is associated with increased mortality but saw no significant effect from vitamin C. No health risk was seen when all the randomized controlled studies were examined together, but an increase in mortality was detected when only high-quality and low-bias risk trials were examined separately. As the majority of these low-bias trials dealt with either <a href="Old%20age">elderly people</a>, or people with disease, these results may not apply to the general population. This meta-analysis was later repeated and extended by the same authors, with the new analysis published by the <a href="Cochrane%20Collaboration">Cochrane Collaboration</a>; this analysis confirmed the previous results. These two publications are consistent with some previous meta-analyzes that also suggested that Vitamin E supplementation increased mortality, and that antioxidant supplements increased the risk of <a href="Colorectal%20cancer">colon cancer</a>. <a href="Beta-carotene">Beta-carotene</a> may also increase lung cancer. Overall, the large number of clinical trials carried out on antioxidant supplements suggest that either these products have no effect on health, or that they cause a small increase in mortality in elderly or vulnerable populations.

While antioxidant supplementation is widely used in attempts to prevent the development of cancer, antioxidants may interfere with cancer treatments, since the environment of cancer cells causes high levels of oxidative stress, making these cells more susceptible to the further oxidative stress induced by treatments. As a result, by reducing the redox stress in cancer cells, antioxidant supplements (and pharmaceuticals) could decrease the effectiveness of <a href="radiotherapy">radiotherapy</a> and <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>. On the other hand, other reviews have suggested that antioxidants could reduce <a href="adverse%20effect">side effects</a> or increase survival times.

A <a href="paradox">paradox</a> in <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> is that, while the vast majority of complex <a href="life">life on Earth</a> requires <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> for its existence, oxygen is a highly reactive molecule that damages living organisms by producing <a href="reactive%20oxygen%20species">reactive oxygen species</a>. Consequently, organisms contain a complex network of antioxidant <a href="metabolite">metabolite</a>s and <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s that work together to prevent oxidative damage to cellular components such as <a href="DNA">DNA</a>, <a href="protein">protein</a>s and <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s. In general, antioxidant systems either prevent these reactive species from being formed, or remove them before they can damage vital components of the cell. However, reactive oxygen species also have useful cellular functions, such as <a href="redox%20signaling">redox signaling</a>. Thus, the function of antioxidant systems is not to remove oxidants entirely, but instead to keep them at an optimum level.

The reactive oxygen species produced in cells include <a href="hydrogen%20peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a> (HO), <a href="hypochlorous%20acid">hypochlorous acid</a> (HClO), and <a href="free%20radical">free radical</a>s such as the <a href="hydroxyl%20radical">hydroxyl radical</a> (·OH) and the <a href="superoxide">superoxide anion</a> (O). The hydroxyl radical is particularly unstable and will react rapidly and non-specifically with most biological molecules. This species is produced from hydrogen peroxide in <a href="catalysis">metal-catalyzed</a> redox reactions such as the <a href="Fenton%20reaction">Fenton reaction</a>. These oxidants can damage cells by starting chemical chain reactions such as <a href="lipid%20peroxidation">lipid peroxidation</a>, or by oxidizing DNA or proteins. Damage to DNA can cause <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s and possibly cancer, if not reversed by <a href="DNA%20repair">DNA repair</a> mechanisms, while damage to <a href="protein">protein</a>s causes enzyme inhibition, <a href="denaturation%20%28biochemistry%29">denaturation</a> and <a href="proteasome">protein degradation</a>.

The use of oxygen as part of the process for generating metabolic energy produces reactive oxygen species. In this process, the superoxide anion is produced as a <a href="by-product">by-product</a> of several steps in the <a href="electron%20transport%20chain">electron transport chain</a>. Particularly important is the reduction of <a href="coenzyme%20Q">coenzyme Q</a> in <a href="complex%20III">complex III</a>, since a highly reactive free radical is formed as an intermediate (Q·). This unstable intermediate can lead to electron "leakage", when electrons jump directly to oxygen and form the superoxide anion, instead of moving through the normal series of well-controlled reactions of the electron transport chain. Peroxide is also produced from the oxidation of reduced <a href="flavoprotein">flavoprotein</a>s, such as <a href="complex%20I">complex I</a>. However, although these enzymes can produce oxidants, the relative importance of the electron transfer chain to other processes that generate peroxide is unclear. In plants, <a href="algae">algae</a>, and <a href="cyanobacteria">cyanobacteria</a>, reactive oxygen species are also produced during <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>, particularly under conditions of high <a href="irradiance">light intensity</a>. This effect is partly offset by the involvement of <a href="carotenoid">carotenoid</a>s in <a href="photoinhibition">photoinhibition</a>, and in algae and cyanobacteria, by large amount of <a href="iodide">iodide</a> and <a href="selenium">selenium</a>, which involves these antioxidants reacting with over-reduced forms of the <a href="photosynthetic%20reaction%20centre">photosynthetic reaction centre</a>s to prevent the production of reactive oxygen species.

Antioxidants are classified into two broad divisions, depending on whether they are soluble in water (<a href="hydrophile">hydrophilic</a>) or in lipids (<a href="Lipophilicity">lipophilic</a>). In general, water-soluble antioxidants react with oxidants in the cell <a href="cytosol">cytosol</a> and the <a href="blood%20plasma">blood plasma</a>, while lipid-soluble antioxidants protect <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a>s from lipid peroxidation. These compounds may be synthesized in the body or obtained from the diet. The different antioxidants are present at a wide range of concentrations in <a href="Bodily%20fluid">body fluids</a> and tissues, with some such as glutathione or <a href="ubiquinone">ubiquinone</a> mostly present within cells, while others such as <a href="uric%20acid">uric acid</a> are more evenly distributed (see table below). Some antioxidants are only found in a few organisms and these compounds can be important in <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s and can be <a href="virulence%20factor">virulence factor</a>s.

The relative importance and interactions between these different antioxidants is a very complex question, with the various metabolites and enzyme systems having <a href="synergy">synergistic</a> and interdependent effects on one another. The action of one antioxidant may therefore depend on the proper function of other members of the antioxidant system. The amount of protection provided by any one antioxidant will also depend on its concentration, its reactivity towards the particular reactive oxygen species being considered, and the status of the antioxidants with which it interacts.

Some compounds contribute to antioxidant defense by <a href="chelation">chelating</a> <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a>s and preventing them from catalyzing the production of free radicals in the cell. Particularly important is the ability to sequester iron, which is the function of <a href="iron-binding%20proteins">iron-binding proteins</a> such as <a href="transferrin">transferrin</a> and <a href="ferritin">ferritin</a>. <a href="Selenium">Selenium</a> and zinc are commonly referred to as "antioxidant nutrients", but these <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s have no antioxidant action themselves and are instead required for the activity of some antioxidant enzymes, as is discussed below.

Uric acid is by far the highest concentration antioxidant in human blood. Uric acid (UA) is an antioxidant oxypurine produced from <a href="xanthine">xanthine</a> by the enzyme <a href="xanthine%20oxidase">xanthine oxidase</a>, and is an intermediate product of <a href="purine">purine</a> metabolism. In almost all land animals, <a href="urate%20oxidase">urate oxidase</a> further catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to <a href="allantoin">allantoin</a>, but in humans and most higher primates, the urate oxidase gene is nonfunctional, so that UA is not further broken down. The evolutionary reasons for this loss of urate conversion to allantoin remain the topic of active speculation. The antioxidant effects of uric acid have led researchers to suggest this mutation was beneficial to early primates and humans. Studies of high altitude acclimatization support the hypothesis that urate acts as an antioxidant by mitigating the oxidative stress caused by high-altitude hypoxia.

Uric acid has the highest concentration of any blood antioxidant and provides over half of the total antioxidant capacity of human serum. Uric acid's antioxidant activities are also complex, given that it does not react with some oxidants, such as <a href="superoxide">superoxide</a>, but does act against <a href="peroxynitrite">peroxynitrite</a>, <a href="peroxide">peroxide</a>s, and <a href="hypochlorous%20acid">hypochlorous acid</a>. Concerns over elevated UA's contribution to <a href="gout">gout</a> must be considered as one of many risk factors. By itself, UA-related risk of gout at high levels (415–530 μmol/L) is only 0.5% per year with an increase to 4.5% per year at UA <a href="supersaturation">supersaturation levels</a> (535+ μmol/L). Many of these aforementioned studies determined UA's antioxidant actions within normal physiological levels, and some found antioxidant activity at levels as high as 285 μmol/L.

<a href="Ascorbic%20acid">Ascorbic acid</a> or "<a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a>" is a <a href="monosaccharide">monosaccharide</a> oxidation-reduction (<a href="redox">redox</a>) <a href="catalyst">catalyst</a> found in both animals and plants. As one of the enzymes needed to make ascorbic acid has been lost by <a href="mutation">mutation</a> during <a href="primate">primate</a> <a href="evolution">evolution</a>, humans must obtain it from the diet; it is therefore a vitamin. Most other animals are able to produce this compound in their bodies and do not require it in their diets. Ascorbic acid is required for the conversion of the <a href="collagen%23Collagen%20I%20formation">procollagen</a> to <a href="collagen">collagen</a> by oxidizing <a href="proline">proline</a> residues to <a href="hydroxyproline">hydroxyproline</a>. In other cells, it is maintained in its reduced form by reaction with glutathione, which can be catalysed by <a href="protein%20disulfide%20isomerase">protein disulfide isomerase</a> and <a href="glutaredoxin">glutaredoxin</a>s. Ascorbic acid is a redox catalyst which can reduce, and thereby neutralize, reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. In addition to its direct antioxidant effects, ascorbic acid is also a <a href="substrate%20%28biochemistry%29">substrate</a> for the redox enzyme <a href="ascorbate%20peroxidase">ascorbate peroxidase</a>, a function that is particularly important in stress resistance in plants. Ascorbic acid is present at high levels in all parts of plants and can reach concentrations of 20 <a href="millimolar">millimolar</a> in <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>s.

<a href="Glutathione">Glutathione</a> is a <a href="cysteine">cysteine</a>-containing <a href="peptide">peptide</a> found in most forms of aerobic life. It is not required in the diet and is instead synthesized in cells from its constituent <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s. Glutathione has antioxidant properties since the <a href="thiol">thiol</a> group in its <a href="cysteine">cysteine</a> <a href="wikt%3Amoiety">moiety</a> is a reducing agent and can be reversibly oxidized and reduced. In cells, glutathione is maintained in the reduced form by the enzyme <a href="glutathione%20reductase">glutathione reductase</a> and in turn reduces other metabolites and enzyme systems, such as ascorbate in the <a href="glutathione-ascorbate%20cycle">glutathione-ascorbate cycle</a>, <a href="glutathione%20peroxidase">glutathione peroxidase</a>s and <a href="glutaredoxin">glutaredoxin</a>s, as well as reacting directly with oxidants. Due to its high concentration and its central role in maintaining the cell's redox state, glutathione is one of the most important cellular antioxidants. In some organisms glutathione is replaced by other thiols, such as by <a href="mycothiol">mycothiol</a> in the <a href="Actinomycete">Actinomycete</a>s, <a href="bacillithiol">bacillithiol</a> in some <a href="Gram-positive%20bacteria">Gram-positive bacteria</a>, or by <a href="trypanothione">trypanothione</a> in the <a href="Kinetoplastida">Kinetoplastids</a>.

<a href="Melatonin">Melatonin</a> is a powerful antioxidant. Melatonin easily crosses cell membranes and the <a href="blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier">blood–brain barrier</a>. Unlike other antioxidants, melatonin does not undergo <a href="redox%20cycling">redox cycling</a>, which is the ability of a molecule to undergo repeated <a href="reduction%20%28chemistry%29">reduction</a> and <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a>. Redox cycling may allow other antioxidants (such as vitamin C) to act as <a href="pro-oxidant">pro-oxidant</a>s and promote free radical formation. Melatonin, once oxidized, cannot be reduced to its former state because it forms several stable end-products upon reacting with free radicals. Therefore, it has been referred to as a terminal (or suicidal) antioxidant.

<a href="Vitamin%20E">Vitamin E</a> is the collective name for a set of eight related <a href="tocopherol">tocopherol</a>s and <a href="tocotrienol">tocotrienol</a>s, which are <a href="fat-soluble">fat-soluble</a> vitamins with antioxidant properties. Of these, α-tocopherol has been most studied as it has the highest <a href="bioavailability">bioavailability</a>, with the body preferentially absorbing and metabolising this form.

It has been claimed that the α-tocopherol form is the most important lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction. This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction from continuing. This reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl radicals that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol. This is in line with findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, efficiently protects glutathione peroxidase 4 (<a href="GPX4">GPX4</a>)-deficient cells from cell death. GPx4 is the only known enzyme that efficiently reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes.

However, the roles and importance of the various forms of vitamin E are presently unclear, and it has even been suggested that the most important function of α-tocopherol is as a <a href="cell%20signaling">signaling molecule</a>, with this molecule having no significant role in antioxidant metabolism. The functions of the other forms of vitamin E are even less well understood, although γ-tocopherol is a <a href="nucleophile">nucleophile</a> that may react with <a href="electrophile">electrophilic</a> mutagens, and tocotrienols may be important in protecting <a href="neuron">neuron</a>s from damage.

Antioxidants that are reducing agents can also act as pro-oxidants. For example, vitamin C has antioxidant activity when it reduces oxidizing substances such as hydrogen peroxide, however, it will also reduce metal ions that generate free radicals through the <a href="Fenton%27s%20reagent">Fenton reaction</a>.

The relative importance of the antioxidant and pro-oxidant activities of antioxidants is an area of current research, but vitamin C, which exerts its effects as a vitamin by oxidizing polypeptides, appears to have a mostly antioxidant action in the human body. However, less data is available for other dietary antioxidants, such as vitamin E, or the <a href="polyphenol%20antioxidant">polyphenols</a>. Likewise, the pathogenesis of diseases involving hyperuricemia likely involve uric acid's direct and indirect pro-oxidant properties.

That is, paradoxically, agents which are normally considered antioxidants can act as conditional <a href="pro-oxidant">pro-oxidant</a>s and actually increase oxidative stress. Besides ascorbate, medically important conditional pro-oxidants include uric acid and sulfhydryl amino acids such as <a href="homocysteine">homocysteine</a>. Typically, this involves some transition-series metal such as copper or iron as catalyst. The potential role of the pro-oxidant role of uric acid in (e.g.) atherosclerosis and ischemic stroke is considered above. Another example is the postulated role of <a href="homocysteine">homocysteine</a> in atherosclerosis.

Some antioxidant supplements may promote disease and increase mortality in humans under certain conditions. Hypothetically, free radicals induce an endogenous response that protects against exogenous radicals (and possibly other toxic compounds). Free radicals may increase life span. This increase may be prevented by antioxidants, providing direct evidence that toxic radicals may <a href="Mitohormesis">mitohormetically</a> exert life extending and health promoting effects.

As with the chemical antioxidants, cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes. Here, the superoxide released by processes such as <a href="oxidative%20phosphorylation">oxidative phosphorylation</a> is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water. This detoxification pathway is the result of multiple enzymes, with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen peroxide. As with antioxidant metabolites, the contributions of these enzymes to antioxidant defenses can be hard to separate from one another, but the generation of <a href="Genetically%20modified%20organism">transgenic mice</a> lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be informative.

<a href="Superoxide%20dismutase">Superoxide dismutase</a>s (SODs) are a class of closely related enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of the superoxide anion into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. SOD enzymes are present in almost all aerobic cells and in extracellular fluids. Superoxide dismutase enzymes contain metal ion cofactors that, depending on the isozyme, can be copper, zinc, <a href="manganese">manganese</a> or iron. In humans, the copper/zinc SOD is present in the <a href="cytosol">cytosol</a>, while manganese SOD is present in the <a href="mitochondrion">mitochondrion</a>. There also exists a third form of SOD in <a href="extracellular%20fluid">extracellular fluid</a>s, which contains copper and zinc in its active sites. The mitochondrial isozyme seems to be the most biologically important of these three, since mice lacking this enzyme die soon after birth. In contrast, the mice lacking copper/zinc SOD (Sod1) are viable but have numerous pathologies and a reduced lifespan (see article on <a href="superoxide">superoxide</a>), while mice without the extracellular SOD have minimal defects (sensitive to <a href="hyperoxia">hyperoxia</a>). In plants, SOD isozymes are present in the cytosol and mitochondria, with an iron SOD found in <a href="chloroplast">chloroplast</a>s that is absent from <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s and <a href="yeast">yeast</a>.

<a href="Catalase">Catalase</a>s are enzymes that catalyse the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, using either an iron or manganese cofactor. This protein is localized to <a href="peroxisome">peroxisome</a>s in most <a href="eukaryote">eukaryotic</a> cells. Catalase is an unusual enzyme since, although hydrogen peroxide is its only substrate, it follows a <a href="enzyme%20kinetics">ping-pong mechanism</a>. Here, its cofactor is oxidised by one molecule of hydrogen peroxide and then regenerated by transferring the bound oxygen to a second molecule of substrate. Despite its apparent importance in hydrogen peroxide removal, humans with genetic deficiency of catalase — "<a href="acatalasemia">acatalasemia</a>" — or mice <a href="Genetic%20engineering">genetically engineered</a> to lack catalase completely, suffer few ill effects.

<a href="Peroxiredoxin">Peroxiredoxin</a>s are peroxidases that catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, <a href="organic%20peroxide">organic hydroperoxides</a>, as well as <a href="peroxynitrite">peroxynitrite</a>. They are divided into three classes: typical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins; atypical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins; and 1-cysteine peroxiredoxins. These enzymes share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which a redox-active cysteine (the peroxidatic cysteine) in the <a href="active%20site">active site</a> is oxidized to a <a href="sulfenic%20acid">sulfenic acid</a> by the peroxide substrate. Over-oxidation of this cysteine residue in peroxiredoxins inactivates these enzymes, but this can be reversed by the action of <a href="sulfiredoxin">sulfiredoxin</a>. Peroxiredoxins seem to be important in antioxidant metabolism, as mice lacking peroxiredoxin 1 or 2 have shortened lifespan and suffer from <a href="hemolytic%20anaemia">hemolytic anaemia</a>, while plants use peroxiredoxins to remove hydrogen peroxide generated in chloroplasts.

The <a href="thioredoxin">thioredoxin</a> system contains the 12-k<a href="atomic%20mass%20unit">Da</a> protein thioredoxin and its companion <a href="thioredoxin%20reductase">thioredoxin reductase</a>. Proteins related to thioredoxin are present in all sequenced organisms. Plants, such as "<a href="Arabidopsis%20thaliana">Arabidopsis thaliana</a>," have a particularly great diversity of isoforms. The active site of thioredoxin consists of two <a href="vicinal%20%28chemistry%29">neighboring</a> cysteines, as part of a highly conserved CXXC <a href="sequence%20motif">motif</a>, that can cycle between an active dithiol form (reduced) and an oxidized <a href="disulfide">disulfide</a> form. In its active state, thioredoxin acts as an efficient reducing agent, scavenging reactive oxygen species and maintaining other proteins in their reduced state. After being oxidized, the active thioredoxin is regenerated by the action of thioredoxin reductase, using <a href="NADPH">NADPH</a> as an <a href="electron%20donor">electron donor</a>.

The <a href="glutathione">glutathione</a> system includes glutathione, <a href="glutathione%20reductase">glutathione reductase</a>, <a href="glutathione%20peroxidase">glutathione peroxidase</a>s, and <a href="glutathione%20S-transferase">glutathione "S"-transferases</a>. This system is found in animals, plants and microorganisms. Glutathione peroxidase is an enzyme containing four <a href="selenium">selenium</a>-<a href="cofactor%20%28biochemistry%29">cofactors</a> that catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. There are at least four different glutathione peroxidase <a href="isozyme">isozyme</a>s in animals. Glutathione peroxidase 1 is the most abundant and is a very efficient scavenger of hydrogen peroxide, while glutathione peroxidase 4 is most active with lipid hydroperoxides. Surprisingly, glutathione peroxidase 1 is dispensable, as mice lacking this enzyme have normal lifespans, but they are hypersensitive to induced oxidative stress. In addition, the glutathione "S"-transferases show high activity with lipid peroxides. These enzymes are at particularly high levels in the liver and also serve in <a href="detoxification">detoxification</a> metabolism.

Oxidative stress is thought to contribute to the development of a wide range of diseases including <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>, <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a>, the pathologies caused by <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>, <a href="rheumatoid%20arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a>, and <a href="neurodegeneration">neurodegeneration</a> in <a href="motor%20neuron%20disease">motor neuron disease</a>s. In many of these cases, it is unclear if oxidants trigger the disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; One case in which this link is particularly well understood is the role of oxidative stress in <a href="cardiovascular%20disease">cardiovascular disease</a>. Here, <a href="low%20density%20lipoprotein">low density lipoprotein</a> (LDL) oxidation appears to trigger the process of <a href="atherosclerosis%23Atherogenesis">atherogenesis</a>, which results in <a href="atherosclerosis">atherosclerosis</a>, and finally cardiovascular disease.

Oxidative damage in DNA can cause cancer. Several antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase etc. protect DNA from oxidative stress. It has been proposed that polymorphisms in these enzymes are associated with DNA damage and subsequently the individual's risk of cancer susceptibility.

A <a href="Calorie%20restriction">low calorie diet</a> extends median and <a href="Maximum%20life%20span">maximum lifespan</a> in many animals. This effect may involve a reduction in oxidative stress. While there is some evidence to support the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as "<a href="Drosophila%20melanogaster">Drosophila melanogaster</a>" and "<a href="Caenorhabditis%20elegans">Caenorhabditis elegans</a>", the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems had no effect on aging.

Diets high in fruit and vegetables, and so possibly being rich in antioxidant vitamins, have no established effect on status of health or aging, yet may have more subtle <a href="physiology">physiological</a> effects, such as modifying cell-to-cell communication.

Antioxidants are used as <a href="food%20additive">food additive</a>s to help <a href="preservative">guard against food deterioration</a>. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping in the dark and sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers. However, as oxygen is also important for plant <a href="Respiration%20%28physiology%29">respiration</a>, storing plant materials in <a href="Anaerobic%20organism%23Metabolism">anaerobic</a> conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors. Consequently, packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. Antioxidants are an especially important class of preservatives as, unlike bacterial or <a href="fungus">fungal</a> spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food. These preservatives include natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (AA, E300) and tocopherols (E306), as well as synthetic antioxidants such as <a href="propyl%20gallate">propyl gallate</a> (PG, E310), <a href="tert-Butylhydroquinone">tertiary butylhydroquinone</a> (TBHQ), <a href="butylated%20hydroxyanisole">butylated hydroxyanisole</a> (BHA, E320) and <a href="butylated%20hydroxytoluene">butylated hydroxytoluene</a> (BHT, E321).

The most common molecules attacked by oxidation are unsaturated fats; oxidation causes them to turn <a href="rancidification">rancid</a>. Since oxidized lipids are often discolored and usually have unpleasant tastes such as metallic or <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>ous flavors, it is important to avoid oxidation in fat-rich foods. Thus, these foods are rarely preserved by drying; instead, they are preserved by <a href="Smoking%20%28cooking%20technique%29">smoking</a>, <a href="salting%20%28food%29">salting</a> or <a href="fermentation%20%28food%29">fermenting</a>. Even less fatty foods such as fruits are sprayed with sulfurous antioxidants prior to air drying. Oxidation is often catalyzed by metals, which is why fats such as butter should never be wrapped in <a href="aluminium%20foil">aluminium foil</a> or kept in metal containers. Some fatty foods such as olive oil are partially protected from oxidation by their natural content of antioxidants, but remain sensitive to photooxidation. Antioxidant preservatives are also added to fat based cosmetics such as lipstick and <a href="moisturizer">moisturizer</a>s to prevent rancidity.

Antioxidants are frequently added to industrial products. A common use is as <a href="Gasoline%20additive">stabilizers</a> in <a href="fuel">fuel</a>s and <a href="lubricant">lubricant</a>s to prevent oxidation, and in gasolines to prevent the polymerization that leads to the formation of engine-fouling residues. In 2014, the worldwide market for natural and synthetic antioxidants was US $2.25 billion with a forecast of growth to $3.25 billion by 2020.

They are widely used to prevent the oxidative degradation of <a href="polymer">polymer</a>s such as rubbers, plastics and <a href="adhesive">adhesive</a>s that causes a loss of strength and flexibility in these materials. Polymers containing <a href="double%20bond">double bond</a>s in their main chains, such as <a href="natural%20rubber">natural rubber</a> and <a href="polybutadiene">polybutadiene</a>, are especially susceptible to <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> and <a href="ozonolysis">ozonolysis</a>. They can be protected by <a href="antiozonant">antiozonant</a>s. Solid polymer products start to crack on exposed surfaces as the material degrades and the chains break. The mode of cracking varies between oxygen and <a href="ozone">ozone</a> attack, the former causing a "crazy paving" effect, while ozone attack produces deeper cracks aligned at right angles to the tensile strain in the product. Oxidation and <a href="UV%20degradation">UV degradation</a> are also frequently linked, mainly because <a href="UV%20radiation">UV radiation</a> creates free radicals by bond breakage. The free radicals then react with oxygen to produce <a href="peroxy">peroxy</a> radicals which cause yet further damage, often in a <a href="chain%20reaction">chain reaction</a>. Other polymers susceptible to oxidation include <a href="polypropylene">polypropylene</a> and <a href="polyethylene">polyethylene</a>. The former is more sensitive owing to the presence of <a href="secondary%20carbon%20atom">secondary carbon atom</a>s present in every repeat unit. Attack occurs at this point because the free radical formed is more stable than one formed on a <a href="primary%20carbon%20atom">primary carbon atom</a>. Oxidation of polyethylene tends to occur at weak links in the chain, such as branch points in <a href="low-density%20polyethylene">low-density polyethylene</a>.

Antioxidant vitamins are found in vegetables, fruits, eggs, legumes and nuts. Vitamins A, C, and E can be destroyed by long-term storage or prolonged cooking. The effects of cooking and food processing are complex, as these processes can also increase the <a href="bioavailability">bioavailability</a> of antioxidants, such as some carotenoids in vegetables. Processed food contains fewer antioxidant vitamins than fresh and uncooked foods, as preparation exposes food to heat and oxygen.

Other antioxidants are not obtained from the diet, but instead are made in the body. For example, <a href="ubiquinol">ubiquinol</a> (coenzyme Q) is poorly absorbed from the gut and is made through the <a href="mevalonate%20pathway">mevalonate pathway</a>. Another example is <a href="glutathione">glutathione</a>, which is made from amino acids. As any glutathione in the gut is broken down to free cysteine, <a href="glycine">glycine</a> and <a href="glutamic%20acid">glutamic acid</a> before being absorbed, even large oral intake has little effect on the concentration of glutathione in the body. Although large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids such as <a href="acetylcysteine">acetylcysteine</a> can increase glutathione, no evidence exists that eating high levels of these glutathione precursors is beneficial for healthy adults.

Measurement of antioxidant content in food is not a straightforward process, as antioxidants collectively are a diverse group of compounds with different reactivities to various reactive oxygen species. In <a href="food%20science">food science</a>, the <a href="oxygen%20radical%20absorbance%20capacity">oxygen radical absorbance capacity</a> (ORAC) was once an industry standard for antioxidant strength of whole foods, juices and food additives. However, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> withdrew these ratings in 2012 as biologically invalid, stating that no physiological proof "<a href="in%20vivo">in vivo</a>" existed to support the <a href="free-radical%20theory">free-radical theory</a> or roles for ingested <a href="phytochemical">phytochemical</a>s, especially for <a href="polyphenol">polyphenol</a>s. Consequently, the ORAC method, derived only from "in vitro" experiments, is no longer considered relevant to human diets or <a href="biology">biology</a>.

Alternative "in vitro" measurements of antioxidant content in foods include the <a href="Folin-Ciocalteu%20reagent">Folin-Ciocalteu reagent</a>, and the <a href="Trolox%20equivalent%20antioxidant%20capacity">Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity</a> assay.

As part of their adaptation from marine life, terrestrial plants began producing non-marine antioxidants such as <a href="ascorbic%20acid">ascorbic acid</a> (<a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a>), <a href="polyphenol">polyphenol</a>s and <a href="tocopherol">tocopherol</a>s. The evolution of <a href="angiosperm">angiosperm</a> plants between 50 and 200 million years ago resulted in the development of many antioxidant pigments – particularly during the <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> period – as chemical defences against <a href="reactive%20oxygen%20species">reactive oxygen species</a> that are byproducts of <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>. Originally, the term antioxidant specifically referred to a chemical that prevented the consumption of oxygen. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, extensive study concentrated on the use of antioxidants in important industrial processes, such as the prevention of metal <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a>, the <a href="vulcanization">vulcanization</a> of rubber, and the <a href="polymerization">polymerization</a> of fuels in the <a href="fouling">fouling</a> of <a href="internal%20combustion%20engine">internal combustion engine</a>s.

Early research on the role of antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of <a href="unsaturated%20fat">unsaturated fat</a>s, which is the cause of <a href="rancidity">rancidity</a>. Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was the identification of <a href="Vitamin%20A">vitamins A</a>, <a href="Vitamin%20C">C</a>, and <a href="Vitamin%20E">E</a> as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of <a href="Organism">living organisms</a>. The possible <a href="mechanisms%20of%20action">mechanisms of action</a> of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized. Research into how <a href="vitamin%20E">vitamin E</a> prevents the process of <a href="lipid%20peroxidation">lipid peroxidation</a> led to the identification of antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by <a href="scavenger%20%28chemistry%29">scavenging</a> <a href="reactive%20oxygen%20species">reactive oxygen species</a> before they can damage cells.

Brass

Brass is a <a href="metal">metal</a>lic <a href="alloy">alloy</a> that is made of <a href="copper">copper</a> and <a href="zinc">zinc</a>. The proportions of zinc and copper can vary to create different types of brass alloys with varying mechanical and electrical properties. It is a <a href="substitutional%20alloy">substitutional alloy</a>: atoms of the two constituents may replace each other within the same crystal structure.

In contrast, <a href="bronze">bronze</a> is an alloy of <a href="copper">copper</a> and <a href="tin">tin</a>. Bronze and brass -in turn- may include small proportions of a range of other <a href="Chemical%20element">elements</a> including <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>, <a href="lead">lead</a>, <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, <a href="manganese">manganese</a>, and <a href="silicon">silicon</a>. 

The term is also applied to a variety of brasses, and the distinction is largely historical. Modern practice in museums and <a href="archaeology">archaeology</a> increasingly avoids both terms for historical objects in favour of the all-embracing "copper alloy".

Brass is used for decoration for its bright gold-like appearance; for applications where low <a href="friction">friction</a> is required such as locks, gears, bearings, <a href="doorknobs">doorknobs</a>, <a href="ammunition">ammunition</a> casings and valves; for plumbing and electrical applications; and extensively in <a href="brass%20instrument">brass musical instruments</a> such as horns and bells where a combination of high workability (historically with hand tools) and durability is desired. It is also used in <a href="zipper">zipper</a>s. Brass is often used in situations in which it is important that <a href="spark%20%28fire%29">spark</a>s are not struck, such as in fittings and tools used near flammable or explosive materials.

Brass has higher malleability than bronze or zinc. The relatively low <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a> of brass (, depending on composition) and its flow characteristics make it a relatively easy material to cast. By varying the proportions of copper and zinc, the properties of the brass can be changed, allowing hard and soft brasses. The density of brass is .

Today, almost 90% of all brass alloys are recycled. Because brass is not <a href="Ferromagnetism">ferromagnetic</a>, it can be separated from ferrous scrap by passing the scrap near a powerful magnet. Brass scrap is collected and transported to the foundry where it is melted and recast into <a href="billet%20%28semi-finished%20product%29">billet</a>s. Billets are heated and extruded into the desired form and size. The general softness of brass means that it can often be machined without the use of <a href="cutting%20fluid">cutting fluid</a>, though there are exceptions to this.

Aluminium makes brass stronger and more corrosion-resistant. Aluminium also causes a highly beneficial hard layer of <a href="aluminium%20oxide">aluminium oxide</a> (AlO) to be formed on the surface that is thin, transparent and self-healing. Tin has a similar effect and finds its use especially in <a href="seawater">seawater</a> applications (naval brasses). Combinations of iron, aluminium, silicon and manganese make brass <a href="wear%20and%20tear">wear and tear</a> resistant.

To enhance the machinability of brass, <a href="lead">lead</a> is often added in concentrations of around 2%. Since lead has a lower <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a> than the other constituents of the brass, it tends to migrate towards the grain boundaries in the form of globules as it cools from casting. The pattern the globules form on the surface of the brass increases the available lead surface area which in turn affects the degree of leaching. In addition, cutting operations can smear the lead globules over the surface. These effects can lead to significant lead leaching from brasses of comparatively low lead content.

<a href="Silicon">Silicon</a> is an alternative to lead; however, when silicon is used in a brass alloy, the scrap must never be mixed with leaded brass scrap because of contamination and safety problems.

In October 1999 the California State Attorney General sued 13 key manufacturers and distributors over lead content. In laboratory tests, state researchers found the average brass key, new or old, exceeded the <a href="California%20Proposition%2065%20%281986%29">California Proposition 65</a> limits by an average factor of 19, assuming handling twice a day. In April 2001 manufacturers agreed to reduce lead content to 1.5%, or face a requirement to warn consumers about lead content. Keys plated with other metals are not affected by the settlement, and may continue to use brass alloys with higher percentage of lead content.

Also in California, lead-free materials must be used for "each component that comes into contact with the wetted surface of pipes and <a href="Piping%20and%20plumbing%20fittings">pipe fittings</a>, plumbing fittings and fixtures." On January 1, 2010, the maximum amount of lead in "lead-free brass" in California was reduced from 4% to 0.25% lead. The common practice of using pipes for electrical grounding is discouraged, as it accelerates lead corrosion.

<nowiki> </nowiki>The so-called dezincification resistant (<a href="Selective%20leaching%23Leaching%20of%20zinc">DZR</a> or DR) brasses, sometimes referred to as CR (<a href="corrosion">corrosion</a> resistant) brasses, are used where there is a large corrosion risk and where normal brasses do not meet the standards. Applications with high water temperatures, <a href="chloride">chloride</a>s present, or deviating water qualities (<a href="soft%20water">soft water</a>) play a role. DZR-brass is excellent in water <a href="boiler">boiler</a> systems. This brass alloy must be produced with great care, with special attention placed on a balanced composition and proper production temperatures and parameters to avoid long-term failures.

The high <a href="Ductility">malleability</a> and workability, relatively good resistance to <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a>, and traditionally attributed <a href="acoustics">acoustic</a> properties of brass, have made it the usual metal of choice for construction of <a href="musical%20instrument">musical instrument</a>s whose acoustic <a href="resonator">resonator</a>s consist of long, relatively narrow tubing, often folded or coiled for compactness; <a href="silver">silver</a> and its alloys, and even <a href="gold">gold</a>, have been used for the same reasons, but brass is the most economical choice. Collectively known as <a href="brass%20instrument">brass instrument</a>s, these include the <a href="trombone">trombone</a>, <a href="tuba">tuba</a>, <a href="trumpet">trumpet</a>, <a href="cornet">cornet</a>, <a href="baritone%20horn">baritone horn</a>, <a href="euphonium">euphonium</a>, <a href="tenor%20horn">tenor horn</a>, and <a href="French%20horn">French horn</a>, and many other "<a href="Horn_%28instrument%29">horn</a>s", many in variously-sized families, such as the <a href="saxhorns">saxhorns</a>. Other <a href="wind%20instrument">wind instrument</a>s may be constructed of brass or other metals, and indeed most modern student-model <a href="flute">flute</a>s and <a href="piccolo">piccolo</a>s are made of some variety of brass, usually a <a href="cupronickel">cupronickel</a> <a href="alloy">alloy</a> similar to <a href="nickel%20silver">nickel silver</a>/<a href="German%20silver">German silver</a>. <a href="Clarinets">Clarinets</a>, especially low clarinets such as the <a href="contrabass">contrabass</a> and <a href="subcontrabass">subcontrabass</a>, are sometimes made of metal because of limited supplies of the dense, fine-grained tropical hardwoods traditionally preferred for smaller <a href="woodwind">woodwind</a>s. For the same reason, some low <a href="clarinet">clarinet</a>s, <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a>s and <a href="contrabassoon">contrabassoon</a>s feature a hybrid construction, with long, straight sections of wood, and curved joints, neck, and/or bell of metal.The use of metal also avoids the risks of exposing wooden instruments to changes in temperature or humidity, which can cause sudden cracking. Even though the <a href="saxophone">saxophone</a>s and <a href="sarrusaphone">sarrusaphone</a>s are classified as <a href="woodwind%20instrument">woodwind instrument</a>s, they are normally made of brass for similar reasons, and because their wide, conical bores and thin-walled bodies are more easily and efficiently made by forming sheet metal than by machining wood.

The keywork of most modern <a href="woodwind">woodwind</a>s, including wooden-bodied instruments, is also usually made of an alloy such as <a href="Nickel%20Silver">Nickel Silver</a>/<a href="German%20Silver">German Silver</a>. Such alloys are stiffer and more durable than the brass used to construct the instrument bodies, but still workable with simple hand tools -- a boon to quick repairs. The <a href="Mouthpiece%20%28brass%29">mouthpiece</a>s of both <a href="brass%20instruments">brass instruments</a> and, less commonly, <a href="woodwind">woodwind</a> instruments are often made of brass, among other metals, as well.

Next to the <a href="brass%20instruments">brass instruments</a>, the most notable use of brass in music is in various <a href="percussion%20instrument">percussion instrument</a>s, most notably <a href="cymbal">cymbal</a>s, <a href="gong">gong</a>s, and <a href="chimes">orchestral (tubular) bells</a> (large "church" <a href="bell">bell</a>s are normally made of <a href="bronze">bronze</a>). Small <a href="handbell">handbell</a>s and "<a href="jingle%20bells">jingle bells</a>" are also commonly made of brass.

The <a href="harmonica">harmonica</a> is a <a href="free%20reed%20aerophone">free reed aerophone</a>, also often made from brass. In <a href="Reed%20pipe">organ pipes</a> of the reed family, brass strips (called tongues) are used as the reeds, which beat against the <a href="reed%20pipe">shallot</a> (or beat "through" the shallot in the case of a "free" reed). Although not part of the brass section, <a href="snare%20drum">snare drum</a>s are also sometimes made of brass. Some parts on <a href="electric%20guitars">electric guitars</a> are also made from brass, especially inertia blocks on tremolo systems for its tonal properties, and for string nuts and saddles for both tonal properties and its low friction.

The <a href="bactericidal">bactericidal</a> properties of brass have been observed for centuries, particularly in marine environments where it prevents biofouling. Depending upon the type and concentration of <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s and the medium they are in, brass kills these <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a>s within a few minutes to hours of contact.

A large number of independent studies confirm this antimicrobial effect, even against antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as MRSA and VRSA. The mechanisms of antimicrobial action by copper and its alloys, including brass, are a subject of intense and ongoing investigation.

Research is being conducted at this time to determine whether brass, copper, and other copper alloys can help to reduce cross contamination in public facilities and reduce the incidence of <a href="nosocomial%20infections">nosocomial infections</a> (hospital-acquired infections) in healthcare facilities.

Brass is susceptible to <a href="stress%20corrosion%20cracking">stress corrosion cracking</a>, especially from <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> or substances containing or releasing ammonia. The problem is sometimes known as <a href="season%20cracking">season cracking</a> after it was first discovered in brass <a href="Cartridge%20%28firearms%29">cartridge</a>s used for <a href="rifle">rifle</a> <a href="ammunition">ammunition</a> during the 1920s in the <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">British Indian Army</a>. The problem was caused by high <a href="residual%20stress">residual stress</a>es from cold forming of the cases during manufacture, together with chemical attack from traces of ammonia in the atmosphere. The cartridges were stored in stables and the ammonia concentration rose during the hot summer months, thus initiating brittle cracks. The problem was resolved by <a href="Annealing%20%28metallurgy%29">annealing</a> the cases, and storing the cartridges elsewhere.

Although forms of brass have been in use since <a href="prehistory">prehistory</a>, its true nature as a copper-zinc alloy was not understood until the post medieval period because the zinc <a href="vapor">vapor</a> which reacted with copper to make brass was not recognised as a <a href="metal">metal</a>. The <a href="King%20James%20Bible">King James Bible</a> makes many references to "brass". The <a href="Shakespearean%20English">Shakespearean English</a> form of the word 'brass' can mean any bronze alloy, or copper, rather than the strict modern definition of brass. The earliest brasses may have been natural alloys made by <a href="smelting">smelting</a> zinc-rich copper <a href="ore">ore</a>s. By the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> period brass was being deliberately produced from metallic copper and zinc minerals using the <a href="Calamine%20brass">cementation</a> process, and variations on this method continued until the mid-19th century. It was eventually replaced by <a href="spelter">spelter</a>ing, the direct alloying of copper and zinc metal which was introduced to <a href="Europe">Europe</a> in the 16th century.

In <a href="West%20Asia">West Asia</a> and the <a href="Eastern%20Mediterranean">Eastern Mediterranean</a> early copper zinc alloys are now known in small numbers from a number of third millennium BC sites in the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean</a>, <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>, <a href="Kalmykia">Kalmykia</a>, <a href="Turkmenistan">Turkmenistan</a> and <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> and from 2nd Millennium BC sites in <a href="West%20India">West India</a>, <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, Iraq and <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>. However, isolated examples of copper-zinc <a href="alloy">alloy</a>s are known in <a href="China">China</a> from as early as the 5th Millennium BC.

The compositions of these early "brass" objects are highly variable and most have zinc contents of between 5% and 15% wt which is lower than in brass produced by cementation. These may be "<a href="natural%20alloys">natural alloys</a>" manufactured by smelting zinc rich copper ores in <a href="redox">redox</a> conditions. Many have similar tin contents to contemporary bronze <a href="Artifact%20%28archaeology%29">artefacts</a> and it is possible that some copper-zinc alloys were accidental and perhaps not even distinguished from copper. However the large number of copper-zinc alloys now known suggests that at least some were deliberately manufactured and many have zinc contents of more than 12% wt which would have resulted in a distinctive golden color.

By the 8th–7th century BC <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>n <a href="cuneiform">cuneiform</a> tablets mention the exploitation of the "copper of the mountains" and this may refer to "natural" brass. "Oreikhalkon" (mountain copper), the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> translation of this term, was later adapted to the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "<a href="aurichalcum">aurichalcum</a>" meaning "golden copper" which became the standard term for brass. In the 4th century BC <a href="Plato">Plato</a> knew "orichalkos" as rare and nearly as valuable as gold and <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny</a> describes how "aurichalcum" had come from <a href="Cyprus">Cypriot</a> ore deposits which had been exhausted by the 1st century AD. <a href="X-ray%20fluorescence">X-ray fluorescence</a> analysis of 39 <a href="orichalcum">orichalcum</a> ingots recovered from a 2,600-year-old shipwreck off Sicily found them to be an alloy made with 75–80 percent copper, 15–20 percent zinc and small percentages of nickel, lead and iron.

During the later part of first millennium BC the use of brass spread across a wide geographical area from <a href="United%20Kingdom">Britain</a> and <a href="Spain">Spain</a> in the west to <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, and <a href="India">India</a> in the east. This seems to have been encouraged by exports and influence from the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> and eastern Mediterranean where deliberate production of brass from metallic copper and zinc ores had been introduced. The 4th century BC writer <a href="Theopompus">Theopompus</a>, quoted by <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a>, describes how heating earth from <a href="Andeira">Andeira</a> in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> produced "droplets of false silver", probably metallic zinc, which could be used to turn copper into oreichalkos. In the 1st century BC the Greek <a href="Dioscorides">Dioscorides</a> seems to have recognised a link between zinc <a href="mineral">mineral</a>s and brass describing how <a href="Cadmia">Cadmia</a> (<a href="zinc%20oxide">zinc oxide</a>) was found on the walls of <a href="furnace">furnace</a>s used to heat either zinc ore or copper and explaining that it can then be used to make brass.

By the first century BC brass was available in sufficient supply to use as <a href="coin">coin</a>age in <a href="Phrygia">Phrygia</a> and <a href="Bithynia">Bithynia</a>, and after the Augustan <a href="currency%20reform">currency reform</a> of 23 BC it was also used to make Roman "<a href="dupondius">dupondii</a>" and "<a href="Sestertius">sestertii</a>". The uniform use of brass for coinage and military equipment across the <a href="Roman%20world">Roman world</a> may indicate a degree of state involvement in the industry, and brass even seems to have been deliberately boycotted by <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> communities in Palestine because of its association with Roman authority.
Brass was produced by the cementation process where copper and zinc ore are heated together until zinc vapor is produced which reacts with the copper. There is good archaeological evidence for this process and <a href="crucible">crucible</a>s used to produce brass by cementation have been found on <a href="Roman%20period">Roman period</a> sites including <a href="Xanten">Xanten</a> and <a href="Nidda%2C%20Hesse">Nidda</a> in <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a> in <a href="France">France</a> and at a number of sites in Britain. They vary in size from tiny acorn sized to large <a href="amphora">amphora</a>e like vessels but all have elevated levels of zinc on the interior and are lidded. They show no signs of <a href="slag">slag</a> or metal <a href="prills">prills</a> suggesting that zinc minerals were heated to produce zinc vapor which reacted with metallic copper in a <a href="solid%20state%20reaction">solid state reaction</a>. The fabric of these crucibles is porous, probably designed to prevent a buildup of pressure, and many have small holes in the lids which may be designed to release pressure or to add additional zinc minerals near the end of the process. Dioscorides mentioned that zinc minerals were used for both the working and finishing of brass, perhaps suggesting secondary additions.

Brass made during the early Roman period seems to have varied between 20% to 28% wt zinc. The high content of zinc in coinage and brass objects declined after the first century AD and it has been suggested that this reflects zinc loss during <a href="recycling">recycling</a> and thus an interruption in the production of new brass. However it is now thought this was probably a deliberate change in composition and overall the use of brass increases over this period making up around 40% of all <a href="copper%20alloys">copper alloys</a> used in the Roman world by the 4th century AD.

Little is known about the production of brass during the centuries immediately after the collapse of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>. Disruption in the trade of tin for bronze from <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a> may have contributed to the increasing popularity of brass in the east and by the 6th–7th centuries AD over 90% of <a href="copper%20alloy">copper alloy</a> artefacts from <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> were made of brass. However other alloys such as low tin bronze were also used and they vary depending on local cultural attitudes, the purpose of the metal and access to zinc, especially between the <a href="Islamic">Islamic</a> and <a href="Byzantine">Byzantine</a> world. Conversely the use of true brass seems to have declined in Western Europe during this period in favour of <a href="gunmetal">gunmetal</a>s and other mixed alloys but by about 1000 brass artefacts are found in <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n graves in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, brass was being used in the manufacture of coins in <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a> and there is archaeological and historical evidence for the production of brass in Germany and <a href="The%20Low%20Countries">The Low Countries</a>, areas rich in <a href="calamine">calamine</a> ore.

These places would remain important centres of brass making throughout the <a href="medieval">medieval</a> period, especially <a href="Dinant">Dinant</a>. Brass objects are still collectively known as "dinanterie" in French. The <a href="baptismal%20font%20at%20St%20Bartholomew%27s%20Church%2C%20Li%C3%A8ge">baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège</a> in modern <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> (before 1117) is an outstanding masterpiece of <a href="Romanesque%20art">Romanesque</a> brass casting, though also often described as bronze. The metal of the early 12th-century <a href="Gloucester%20Candlestick">Gloucester Candlestick</a> is unusual even by medieval standards in being a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, <a href="nickel">nickel</a>, iron, <a href="antimony">antimony</a> and <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a> with an unusually large amount of <a href="silver">silver</a>, ranging from 22.5% in the base to 5.76% in the pan below the candle. The proportions of this mixture may suggest that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins, probably Late Roman. <a href="Latten">Latten</a> is a term for decorative borders and similar objects cut from sheet metal, whether of brass or bronze. <a href="Aquamanile">Aquamanile</a>s were typically made in brass in both the European and Islamic worlds.
The cementation process continued to be used but literary sources from both Europe and the <a href="Islamic%20world">Islamic world</a> seem to describe variants of a higher temperature liquid process which took place in open-topped crucibles. Islamic cementation seems to have used zinc oxide known as "tutiya" or <a href="tutty">tutty</a> rather than zinc ores for brass-making, resulting in a metal with lower <a href="iron">iron</a> impurities. A number of Islamic writers and the 13th century <a href="Italians">Italian</a> <a href="Marco%20Polo">Marco Polo</a> describe how this was obtained by <a href="sublimation%20%28phase%20transition%29">sublimation</a> from zinc ores and <a href="Condensation">condensed</a> onto <a href="clay">clay</a> or iron bars, archaeological examples of which have been identified at <a href="Hindu%20Kush">Kush</a> in Iran. It could then be used for brass making or medicinal purposes. In 10th century <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a> <a href="Ab%C5%AB%20Muhammad%20al-Hasan%20al-Hamd%C4%81n%C4%AB">al-Hamdani</a> described how spreading <a href="al-iglimiya">al-iglimiya</a>, probably zinc oxide, onto the surface of molten copper produced tutiya vapor which then reacted with the metal. The 13th century Iranian writer <a href="al-Kashani">al-Kashani</a> describes a more complex process whereby "tutiya" was mixed with <a href="raisin">raisin</a>s and gently roasted before being added to the surface of the molten metal. A temporary lid was added at this point presumably to minimise the escape of zinc vapor.

In Europe a similar liquid process in open-topped crucibles took place which was probably less efficient than the Roman process and the use of the term tutty by <a href="Albertus%20Magnus">Albertus Magnus</a> in the 13th century suggests influence from Islamic technology. The 12th century <a href="Germans">German</a> monk <a href="Theophilus%20Presbyter">Theophilus</a> described how preheated crucibles were one sixth filled with powdered calamine and <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a> then topped up with copper and charcoal before being melted, stirred then filled again. The final product was <a href="casting">cast</a>, then again melted with calamine. It has been suggested that this second melting may have taken place at a lower temperature to allow more zinc to be <a href="Absorption%20%28chemistry%29">absorbed</a>. Albertus Magnus noted that the "power" of both calamine and tutty could <a href="evaporate">evaporate</a> and described how the addition of powdered <a href="glass">glass</a> could create a film to bind it to the metal. 
German brass making crucibles are known from <a href="Dortmund">Dortmund</a> dating to the 10th century AD and from <a href="Soest%2C%20Germany">Soest</a> and <a href="Schwerte">Schwerte</a> in <a href="Westphalia">Westphalia</a> dating to around the 13th century confirm Theophilus' account, as they are open-topped, although <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a> discs from Soest may have served as loose lids which may have been used to reduce zinc <a href="evaporation">evaporation</a>, and have slag on the interior resulting from a liquid process.

Some of the most famous objects in <a href="African%20art">African art</a> are the <a href="lost%20wax">lost wax</a> castings of West Africa, mostly from what is now <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, produced first by the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ife">Kingdom of Ife</a> and then the <a href="Benin%20Empire">Benin Empire</a>. Though normally described as "bronzes", the <a href="Benin%20Bronze%20plaques">Benin Bronze plaques</a>, now mostly in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> and other Western collections, and the large portrait heads such as the <a href="Bronze%20Head%20from%20Ife">Ife Head</a> of "heavily leaded zinc-brass" and the <a href="Bronze%20Head%20of%20Queen%20Idia">Bronze Head of Queen Idia</a>, both also British Museum, are better described as brass, though of variable compositions. Work in brass or bronze continued to be important in <a href="Benin%20art">Benin art</a> and other West African traditions such as <a href="Akan%20goldweights">Akan goldweights</a>, where the metal was regarded as a more valuable material than in Europe.

The <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> saw important changes to both the theory and practice of brassmaking in Europe. By the 15th century there is evidence for the renewed use of lidded cementation crucibles at <a href="Zwickau">Zwickau</a> in Germany. These large crucibles were capable of producing c.20 kg of brass. There are traces of slag and pieces of metal on the interior. Their irregular composition suggesting that this was a lower temperature not entirely liquid process. The crucible lids had small holes which were blocked with clay plugs near the end of the process presumably to maximise zinc <a href="absorption%20%28chemistry%29">absorption</a> in the final stages. Triangular crucibles were then used to melt the brass for <a href="casting">casting</a>.

16th-century technical writers such as <a href="Biringuccio">Biringuccio</a>, <a href="Ercker">Ercker</a> and <a href="Georg%20Agricola">Agricola</a> described a variety of cementation brass making techniques and came closer to understanding the true nature of the process noting that copper became heavier as it changed to brass and that it became more golden as additional calamine was added. Zinc metal was also becoming more commonplace By 1513 metallic zinc <a href="ingot">ingot</a>s from India and China were arriving in <a href="London">London</a> and pellets of zinc condensed in <a href="furnace">furnace</a> flues at the <a href="Rammelsberg">Rammelsberg</a> in Germany were exploited for cementation brass making from around 1550.

Eventually it was discovered that metallic zinc could be <a href="alloy">alloy</a>ed with copper to make brass; a process known as speltering and by 1657 the German chemist <a href="Johann%20Glauber">Johann Glauber</a> had recognised that calamine was "nothing else but unmeltable zinc" and that zinc was a "half ripe metal." However some earlier high zinc, low iron brasses such as the 1530 Wightman brass memorial <a href="Commemorative%20plaque">plaque</a> from England may have been made by alloying copper with "zinc" and include traces of <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a> similar those found in some zinc ingots from China.
However the cementation process was not abandoned and as late as the early 19th century there are descriptions of <a href="Solid-state%20chemistry">solid-state</a> cementation in a domed furnace at around 900–950 °C and lasting up to 10 hours. The European brass industry continued to flourish into the post medieval period buoyed by innovations such as the 16th century introduction of water powered hammers for the production of <a href="battery%20wares">battery wares</a>. By 1559 the Germany city of <a href="Aachen">Aachen</a> alone was capable of producing 300,000 <a href="centum%20weight">cwt</a> of brass per year. After several false starts during the 16th and 17th centuries the brass industry was also established in England taking advantage of abundant supplies of cheap copper <a href="smelted">smelted</a> in the new <a href="coal">coal</a> fired <a href="reverberatory%20furnace">reverberatory furnace</a>. In 1723 <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> brass maker <a href="Nehemiah%20Champion">Nehemiah Champion</a> patented the use of <a href="granulated">granulated</a> copper, produced by pouring molten metal into cold water. This increased the <a href="surface%20area">surface area</a> of the copper helping it react and zinc contents of up to 33% wt were reported using this new technique.

In 1738 Nehemiah's son <a href="William%20Champion%20%28metallurgist%29">William Champion</a> patented a technique for the first industrial scale <a href="distillation">distillation</a> of metallic zinc known as "distillation per descencum" or "the English process." This local zinc was used in speltering and allowed greater control over the zinc content of brass and the production of high-zinc copper alloys which would have been difficult or impossible to produce using cementation, for use in expensive objects such as <a href="scientific%20instruments">scientific instruments</a>, <a href="clocks">clocks</a>, brass <a href="buttons">buttons</a> and <a href="costume%20jewellery">costume jewellery</a>. However Champion continued to use the cheaper calamine cementation method to produce lower-zinc brass and the archaeological remains of bee-hive shaped cementation furnaces have been identified at his works at <a href="Warmley">Warmley</a>. By the mid-to-late 18th century developments in cheaper zinc distillation such as <a href="John-Jaques%20Dony">John-Jaques Dony</a>'s horizontal furnaces in Belgium and the reduction of tariffs on zinc as well as demand for <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a>-resistant high zinc alloys increased the popularity of speltering and as a result cementation was largely abandoned by the mid-19th century.

Bonn

The <a href="Federal%20city">Federal City</a> of Bonn () is a city on the banks of the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> in the German state of <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a>, with a population of over 300,000. About south-southeast of <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, Bonn is in the southernmost part of the <a href="Rhine-Ruhr">Rhine-Ruhr</a> region, Germany's largest metropolitan area, with over 11 million inhabitants.

Together with the capital <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, the city is the "de facto" joint seat of government of Germany. Bonn is the secondary seat of the <a href="President%20of%20Germany">President</a>, the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany">Chancellor</a>, the <a href="Bundesrat%20of%20Germany">Bundesrat</a> and the primary seat of six federal government ministries and twenty federal authorities. The title of Federal City () reflects its important political status within Germany.

Founded in the 1st century BC as a <a href="Germania%20Inferior">Roman settlement</a>, Bonn is one of Germany's oldest cities. From 1597 to 1794, Bonn was the capital of the <a href="Electorate%20of%20Cologne">Electorate of Cologne</a>, and residence of the Archbishops and Prince-electors of <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Cologne">Cologne</a>. Composer <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a> was born in Bonn in 1770. From 1949 to 1990, Bonn was the <a href="Capital%20of%20Germany">provisional capital</a> ("temporary seat of the Federal institutions") of <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>, and Germany's present constitution, the <a href="Basic%20Law%20for%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany">Basic Law</a>, was declared in the city in 1949. From 1990 to 1999, Bonn served as the seat of government – but no longer capital – of <a href="German%20reunification">reunited Germany</a>.

The headquarters of <a href="Deutsche%20Post%20DHL">Deutsche Post DHL</a> and <a href="Deutsche%20Telekom">Deutsche Telekom</a>, both <a href="DAX">DAX-listed</a> corporations, are in Bonn. The city is home to the <a href="University%20of%20Bonn">University of Bonn</a> and a total of 19 <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> institutions.

Situated in the southernmost part of the <a href="Rhine-Ruhr">Rhine-Ruhr</a> region, Germany's largest metropolitan area with over 11 million inhabitants, Bonn lies within the <a href="States%20of%20Germany">German state</a> of <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a>, close to the border with <a href="Rhineland-Palatinate">Rhineland-Palatinate</a>. Spanning an area of more on both sides of the river <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a>, almost three quarters of the city lie on the river's left bank.

To the south and to the west, Bonn is bordering the <a href="Eifel">Eifel region</a> which encompasses the <a href="Rhineland%20Nature%20Park">Rhineland Nature Park</a>. To the north, Bonn borders the <a href="Cologne%20Lowland">Cologne Lowland</a>. Natural borders are constituted by the river <a href="Sieg">Sieg</a> to the north-east and by the <a href="Siebengebirge">Siebengebirge</a> (also known as the Seven Hills) to the east. The largest extension of the city in north-south dimensions is and in west-east dimensions. The city borders have a total length of . The geographical centre of Bonn is the Bundeskanzlerplatz "(Chancellor Square)" in Bonn-Gronau.

The <a href="States%20of%20Germany">German state</a> of <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a> is divided into five <a href="Regierungsbezirk">governmental districts</a> (), and Bonn is part of the <a href="Regierungsbezirk%20K%C3%B6ln">governmental district of Cologne</a> (). Within this governmental district, the city of Bonn is an <a href="List%20of%20districts%20of%20Germany">urban district</a> in its own right. The urban district of Bonn is then again divided into four administrative municipal districts (). These are Bonn, Bonn-Bad Godesberg, Bonn-Beuel and Bonn-Hardtberg.
In 1969, the independent towns of <a href="Bad%20Godesberg">Bad Godesberg</a> and Beuel as well as several villages were incorporated into Bonn, resulting in a city more than twice as large as before.
Bonn has an <a href="oceanic%20climate">oceanic climate</a> ("Cfb"). In the south of the Cologne lowland in the Rhine valley, Bonn is in one of Germany's warmest regions.

The history of the city dates back to Roman times. In about 12 BC, the <a href="Roman%20army">Roman army</a> appears to have stationed a small unit in what is presently the historical centre of the city. Even earlier, the army had resettled members of a Germanic tribal group allied with Rome, the <a href="Ubii">Ubii</a>, in Bonn. The Latin name for that settlement, "Bonna", may stem from the original population of this and many other settlements in the area, the <a href="Eburones">Eburoni</a>. The Eburoni were members of a large tribal coalition effectively wiped out during the final phase of <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Caesar</a>'s <a href="Gallic%20Wars">War in Gaul</a>. After several decades, the army gave up the small camp linked to the Ubii-settlement. During the <a href="1st%20century">1st century</a> <a href="Anno%20Domini">AD</a>, the army then chose a site to the north of the emerging town in what is now the section of Bonn-Castell to build a large military installation dubbed <a href="Castra">Castra</a> Bonnensis, i.e., literally, "Fort Bonn". Initially built from wood, the fort was eventually rebuilt in stone. With additions, changes and new construction, the fort remained in use by the army into the waning days of the <a href="Western%20Roman%20Empire">Western Roman Empire</a>, possibly the mid-<a href="5th%20century">5th century</a>. The structures themselves remained standing well into the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, when they were called the Bonnburg. They were used by <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Franks">Frankish</a> kings until they fell into disuse. Eventually, much of the building materials seem to have been re-used in the construction of Bonn's 13th-century <a href="Defensive%20wall">city wall</a>. The Sterntor ("star gate") in the city center is a reconstruction using the last remnants of the medieval city wall.

To date, Bonn's Roman fort remains the largest fort of its type known from the <a href="Ancient%20history">ancient world</a>, i.e. a fort built to accommodate a full-strength <a href="Roman%20legion">Imperial Legion</a> and its auxiliaries. The fort covered an area of approximately . Between its walls it contained a dense grid of streets and a multitude of buildings, ranging from spacious headquarters and large officers' quarters to <a href="barracks">barracks</a>, <a href="stable">stable</a>s and a <a href="Military%20prison">military jail</a>. Among the legions stationed in Bonn, the "1st", i.e. the <a href="Legio%20I%20Minervia">Prima Legio Minervia</a>, seems to have served here the longest. Units of the Bonn legion were deployed to theatres of war ranging from modern-day <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a> to what is now the Russian republic of <a href="Chechnya">Chechnya</a>.

The chief <a href="Roman%20roads">Roman road</a> linking the provincial capitals of <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> and <a href="Mainz">Mainz</a> cut right through the fort where it joined the fort's main road (now, Römerstraße). Once past the South Gate, the Cologne–Mainz road continued along what are now streets named Belderberg, Adenauerallee et al. On both sides of the road, the local settlement, "Bonna", grew into a sizeable Roman town. Bonn is shown on the <a href="4th%20century">4th century</a> <a href="Peutinger%20Map">Peutinger Map</a>.

In <a href="late%20antiquity">late antiquity</a>, much of the town seems to have been destroyed by marauding invaders. The remaining civilian population then took refuge inside the fort along with the remnants of the troops stationed here. During the final decades of Imperial rule, the troops were supplied by <a href="Franks">Franci</a> chieftains employed by the Roman administration. When the end came, these troops simply shifted their allegiances to the new barbarian rulers, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Franks">Kingdom of the Franks</a>. From the fort, the Bonnburg, as well as from a new medieval settlement to the South centered around what later became the <a href="Bonn%20Minster">minster</a>, grew the medieval city of Bonn. Local legends arose from this period that the name of the village came from <a href="Saint%20Boniface">Saint Boniface</a> via <a href="Vulgar%20Latin">Vulgar Latin</a> "*Bonnifatia", but this proved to be a myth.

Between the 11th and 13th centuries, the <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> style Bonn Minster was built, and in 1597 Bonn became the seat of the <a href="Diocese">Archdiocese</a> of <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Cologne">Cologne</a>. The city gained more influence and grew considerably. The city was subject to a major bombardment during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Bonn%20%281689%29">Siege of Bonn</a> in 1689. The <a href="Electorate%20of%20Cologne">elector</a> <a href="Clemens%20August%20of%20Bavaria">Clemens August</a> (ruled 1723–1761) ordered the construction of a series of <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> buildings which still give the city its character. Another memorable ruler was <a href="Archduke%20Maximilian%20Francis%20of%20Austria">Max Franz</a> (ruled 1784–1794), who founded the university and the spa quarter of <a href="Bad%20Godesberg">Bad Godesberg</a>. In addition he was a patron of the young <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a>, who was born in Bonn in 1770; the elector financed the composer's first journey to <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>.

In 1794, the city was seized by <a href="France">French</a> troops, becoming a part of the <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First French Empire</a>. In 1815 following the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, Bonn became part of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a>. Administered within the Prussian <a href="Rhine%20Province">Rhine Province</a>, the city became part of the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> in 1871 during the Prussian-led <a href="unification%20of%20Germany">unification of Germany</a>. Bonn was of little relevance in these years.

During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, Bonn acquired military significance because of its strategic location on the Rhine, which formed a natural barrier to easy penetration into the German heartland from the west. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Bonn on 7 March 1945, and the US <a href="1st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Infantry Division</a> captured the city during the battle of 8–9 March 1945.

Following the Second World War, Bonn was in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> zone of occupation. Following the advocacy of West Germany's first chancellor, <a href="Konrad%20Adenauer">Konrad Adenauer</a>, a former <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> Mayor and a native of that area, Bonn became the "de facto" capital, officially designated the "temporary seat of the federal institutions," of the newly formed Federal Republic of Germany in 1949. However, the Bundestag affirmed <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>'s status as the German capital. Bonn was chosen as the temporary seat of government despite the fact that <a href="Frankfurt%20am%20Main">Frankfurt</a> already had most of the required facilities and using Bonn was estimated to be 95 million DM more expensive than using Frankfurt. However, Adenauer and other prominent politicians intended to make Berlin the capital of the reunified Germany, and felt that locating the capital in a major city like Frankfurt or <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> would imply a permanent capital and weaken support in West Germany for reunification.

In 1949, the <a href="Parlamentarischer%20Rat">Parliamentary Council</a> in Bonn drafted and adopted the current German constitution, the <a href="Basic%20Law%20for%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany">Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany</a>. As the political centre of West Germany, Bonn saw six <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany">Chancellors</a> and six <a href="President%20of%20Germany">Presidents</a> of the Federal Republic of Germany. Bonn's time as the capital of West Germany is commonly referred to as the "Bonn Republic," in contrast to the "Berlin Republic" which followed reunification in 1990.

<a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a> in 1990 made Berlin the nominal capital of Germany again. This decision did not mandate that the republic's political institutions would also move. While some argued for the seat of government to move to Berlin, others advocated leaving it in Bonn — a situation roughly analogous to that of the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, where <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> is the capital but <a href="the%20Hague">the Hague</a> is the seat of government. Berlin's previous history as united Germany's capital was strongly connected with the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>, the <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Weimar Republic</a> and more ominously with <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. It was felt that a new peacefully united Germany should not be governed from a city connected to such overtones of war. Additionally, Bonn was closer to <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, headquarters of the <a href="European%20Economic%20Community">European Economic Community</a>. Former chancellor <a href="Willy%20Brandt">Willy Brandt</a> caused considerable offence to the Western Allies during the debate by stating that <a href="France">France</a> wouldn't have kept the seat of government at <a href="Vichy%20France">Vichy</a> after Liberation.

The heated debate that resulted was settled by the "<a href="Bundestag">Bundestag</a>" (Germany's parliament) only on 20 June 1991. By a vote of 338–320, the Bundestag voted to move the seat of government to Berlin. The vote broke largely along regional lines, with legislators from the south and west favouring Bonn and legislators from the north and east voting for Berlin. It also broke along generational lines as well; older legislators with memories of Berlin's past glory favoured Berlin, while younger legislators favoured Bonn. Ultimately, the votes of the <a href="New%20states%20of%20Germany%23Culture">eastern German</a> legislators tipped the balance in favour of Berlin.

From 1990 to 1999, Bonn served as the seat of government of reunited Germany. In recognition of its former status as German capital, it holds the name of Federal City (). Bonn currently shares the status of Germany's seat of government with Berlin, with the <a href="President%20of%20Germany">President</a>, the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany">Chancellor</a> and many government ministries maintaining substantial presences in Bonn. Over 8,000 of the 18,000 federal officials remain in Bonn. A total of 19 <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations (UN)</a> institutions operate from Bonn today.

The <a href="city%20council">city council</a> of Bonn used to be based in the <a href="Rococo">Rococo-style</a> and 1737 built ' (old city hall) adjacent to Bonn's central market square. However, due to the enlargement of Bonn in 1969 through the incorporation of Beuel and Bad Godesberg, it moved into the larger Stadthaus facilities further up north. This was necessary for the city council to accommodate the risen number of representatives. The mayor of Bonn still sits in the ', which is also used for representative and official purposes.

As of the 2014–2020 election cycle, the <a href="CDU%20%28Germany%29">Christian Democrats (CDU)</a> hold the majority of mandates in the city council (27 seats), followed by the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Social Democrats (SPD)</a> with 20 seats, the <a href="Alliance%20%2790/The%20Greens">Greens (Bündnis '90/Die Grünen)</a> with 16 seats, the <a href="Free%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Germany%29">Liberals (FDP)</a> with 7 seats, the <a href="The%20Left%20%28Germany%29">Left (Die Linke)</a> with 5 seats, the local Bürgerbund Bonn with 4 seats, the <a href="Alternative%20for%20Germany">Alternative for Germany (AfD)</a> with 3 seats, and independent candidates with a total of 4 seats. There are currently 86 seats in the city council of Bonn.

The mayor is (CDU), directly elected in 2015.

Ballroom dance

Ballroom dance is a set of <a href="partner%20dance">partner dance</a>s, which are enjoyed both <a href="social%20dance">socially</a> and <a href="ballroom%20dance%23Competitive%20dancing">competitively</a> around the world. Because of its <a href="performance%20dance">performance</a> and <a href="entertainment">entertainment</a> aspects, ballroom dance is also widely enjoyed on <a href="Stage%20%28theatre%29">stage</a>, <a href="film">film</a>, and <a href="television">television</a>.

"Ballroom dance" may refer, at its widest definition, to almost any type of partner dancing as recreation. However, with the emergence of <a href="dancesport">dancesport</a> in modern times, the term has become narrower in scope, and traditionally refers to the five International Standard and five International Latin style dances (see dance <a href="Ballroom%20dance%23Dances">categories</a> below). The two styles, while differing in technique, rhythm and costumes, exemplify core elements of ballroom dancing such as control and cohesiveness. Developed in England, the two styles are now regulated by the <a href="World%20Dance%20Council">World Dance Council</a> (WDC) and the <a href="World%20DanceSport%20Federation">World DanceSport Federation</a> (WDSF). In the United States, two additional variations are popular: "<a href="American%20Smooth">American Smooth</a>" and "<a href="American%20Rhythm">American Rhythm</a>", which combine elements of the Standard and Latin styles with influences from other dance traditions.

There are also a number of historical dances, and local or national dances, which may be danced in ballrooms or salons. Sequence dancing, in pairs or other formations, is still a popular style of ballroom dance.

The term 'ballroom dancing' is derived from the word "ball" which in turn originates from the Latin word "ballare" which means 'to dance' (a ball-room being a large room specially designed for such dances). In times past, ballroom dancing was <a href="Social%20dance">social dancing</a> for the privileged, leaving <a href="folk%20dancing">folk dancing</a> for the lower classes. These boundaries have become blurred. The definition of ballroom dance also depends on the era: balls have featured popular dances of the day such as the <a href="Minuet">Minuet</a>, <a href="Quadrille">Quadrille</a>, <a href="Polonaise">Polonaise</a>, <a href="Polka">Polka</a>, <a href="Mazurka">Mazurka</a>, and others, which are now considered to be <a href="historical%20dance">historical dance</a>s.

The first authoritative knowledge of the earliest ballroom dances was recorded toward the end of the 16th century, when Jehan Tabourot, under the pen name "<a href="Thoinot%20Arbeau">Thoinot-Arbeau</a>", published in 1588 his "Orchésographie", a study of late 16th-century French renaissance social dance. Among the dances described were the solemn <a href="basse%20danse">basse danse</a>, the livelier <a href="branle">branle</a>, <a href="pavane">pavane</a>, and the <a href="galliarde">galliarde</a> which <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> called the "cinq pace" as it was made of five steps.
In 1650 the <a href="Minuet">Minuet</a>, originally a peasant dance of <a href="Poitou">Poitou</a>, was introduced into Paris and set to music by <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lully">Jean-Baptiste Lully</a> and danced by the King <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a> in public, and would continue to dominate ballroom from that time until the close of the 18th century.

Toward the latter half of the 17th century, Louis XIV founded his '<a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20Royale%20de%20Musique">Académie Royale de Musique et de Danse</a>', where specific rules for the execution of every dance and the "<a href="Positions%20of%20the%20feet%20in%20ballet">five positions</a>" of the feet were formulated for the first time by members of the Académie. Eventually, the first definite cleavage between ballet and ballroom came when professional dancers appeared in the ballets, and the ballets left the Court and went to the stage. Ballet technique such as the <a href="Turnout%20%28ballet%29">turned out</a> positions of the feet, however, lingered for over two centuries and past the end of the Victoria era.

The waltz with its modern hold took root in England in about 1812; in 1819 <a href="Carl%20Maria%20von%20Weber">Carl Maria von Weber</a> wrote "<a href="Invitation%20to%20the%20Dance%20%28Weber%29">Invitation to the Dance</a>", which marked the adoption of the waltz form into the sphere of absolute music. The dance was initially met with tremendous opposition due to the semblance of impropriety associated with the closed hold, though the stance gradually softened. In the 1840s several new dances made their appearance in the ballroom, including the <a href="Polka">Polka</a>, <a href="Mazurka">Mazurka</a>, and the <a href="Schottische">Schottische</a>. In the meantime a strong tendency emerged to drop all 'decorative' steps such as "entrechats" and "ronds de jambes" that had found a place in the Quadrilles and other dances.

Modern ballroom dance has its roots early in the 20th century, when several different things happened more or less at the same time. The first was a movement away from the sequence dances towards dances where the couples moved independently. This had been pre-figured by the waltz, which had already made this transition. The second was a wave of popular music, such as <a href="jazz">jazz</a>, much of which was based on the ideas of black musicians in the USA. Since dance is to a large extent tied to music, this led to a burst of newly invented dances. There were many dance crazes in the period 1910–1930.
The third event was a concerted effort to transform some of the dance crazes into dances which could be taught to a wider dance public in the US and Europe. Here <a href="Vernon%20and%20Irene%20Castle">Vernon and Irene Castle</a> were important, and so was a generation of English dancers in the 1920s, including <a href="Josephine%20Bradley">Josephine Bradley</a> and <a href="Victor%20Silvester">Victor Silvester</a>. These professionals analysed, codified, published and taught a number of standard dances. It was essential, if popular dance was to flourish, for dancers to have some basic movements they could confidently perform with any partner they might meet. Here the huge <a href="Arthur%20Murray">Arthur Murray</a> organisation in America, and the dance societies in England, such as the <a href="Imperial%20Society%20of%20Teachers%20of%20Dancing">Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing</a>, were highly influential. Finally, much of this happened during and after a period of World War, and the effect of such a conflict in dissolving older social customs was considerable.

Later, in the 1930s, the on-screen dance pairing of <a href="Fred%20Astaire">Fred Astaire</a> and <a href="Ginger%20Rogers">Ginger Rogers</a> influenced all forms of dance in the USA and elsewhere. Although both actors had separate careers, their filmed dance sequences together, which included portrayals of the Castles, have reached iconic status. Much of Astaire and Rogers' work portrayed social dancing, although the performances were highly choreographed (often by Astaire or <a href="Hermes%20Pan%20%28choreographer%29">Hermes Pan</a>), and meticulously staged and rehearsed.

Competitions, sometimes referred to as <a href="Dancesport">Dancesport</a>, range from world championships, regulated by the <a href="World%20Dance%20Council">World Dance Council</a> (WDC), to less advanced dancers at various proficiency levels. Most competitions are divided into professional and amateur, though in the USA <a href="pro-am">pro-am</a> competitions typically accompany professional competitions. The <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> now recognizes <a href="competitive%20dance">competitive</a> ballroom dance. It has recognized another body, the <a href="World%20DanceSport%20Federation">World DanceSport Federation</a> (WDSF), as the sole representative body for dancesport in the <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a>. However, it seems doubtful that dance will be included in the Olympic Games, especially in light of efforts to reduce the number of participating sports.

Ballroom dance competitions are regulated by each country in its own way. There are about 30 countries which compete regularly in international competitions. There are another 20 or so countries which have membership of the WDC and/or the WDSF, but whose dancers rarely appear in international competitions. In Britain there is the <a href="British%20Dance%20Council">British Dance Council</a>, which grants national and regional championship titles, such as the British Ballroom Championships, the <a href="British%20Sequence%20Championships">British Sequence Championships</a> and the United Kingdom Championships. In the United States, the member branches of the WDC (National Dance Council of America) and the WDSF (<a href="USA%20Dance">USA Dance</a>) both grant national and regional championship titles.

Ballroom dancing competitions in the former USSR also included the <a href="Soviet%20Ballroom%20dances">Soviet Ballroom dances</a>, or "Soviet Programme". Australian <a href="New%20Vogue%20%28dance%29">New Vogue</a> is danced both competitively and socially. In competition there are 15 recognised New Vogue dances, which are performed by the competitors in sequence. These dance forms are not recognised internationally, neither are the US variations such as American Smooth, and Rhythm. Such variations in dance and competition methods are attempts to meets perceived needs in the local market-place.

Internationally, the <a href="Blackpool%20Dance%20Festival">Blackpool Dance Festival</a>, hosted annually at <a href="Blackpool">Blackpool</a>, England, is considered the most prestigious event a dancesport competitor can attend.

<a href="Formation%20dance">Formation dance</a> is another style of competitive dance recognised by the IDSF. In this style, multiple dancers (usually in couples and typically up to 16 dancers at one time) compete on the same team, moving in and out of various formations while dancing.

In competitive ballroom, dancers are judged by diverse criteria such as poise, the hold or frame, posture, musicality and expression, timing, body alignment and shape, floor craft, foot and leg action, and presentation. Judging in a performance-oriented sport is inevitably subjective in nature, and controversy and complaints by competitors over judging placements are not uncommon. The scorekeepers—called scrutineers—will tally the total number recalls accumulated by each couple through each round until the finals, when the <a href="Skating%20system">Skating system</a> is used to place each couple by ordinals, typically 1–6, though the number of couples in the final may vary. Sometimes, up to 8 couples may be present on the floor during the finals.

Competitors dance at different levels based on their ability and experience. The levels are split into two categories, syllabus and open. The syllabus levels are newcomer/pre-bronze, bronze, silver, and gold—with gold the highest syllabus level and newcomer the lowest. In these levels, moves are restricted to those written in syllabus, and illegal moves can lead to disqualification. Each level, bronze, silver, and gold, has different moves on their syllabus, increasing in difficulty. There are three levels in the open category; novice, pre-champ, and champ in increasing order of skill. At those levels, dancers no longer have restrictions on their moves, so complex routines are more common.

Medal evaluations for amateurs enable dancers' individual abilities to be recognized according to conventional standards. In medal evaluations, which are run by bodies such as the <a href="Imperial%20Society%20of%20Teachers%20of%20Dancing">Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing</a> (ISTD) and the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Alliance%20%28UKA%29">United Kingdom Alliance (UKA)</a>, each dancer performs two or more dances in a certain genre in front of a judge. Genres such as Modern Ballroom or Latin are the most popular. Societies such as the ISTD and UKA also offer medal tests on other dance styles (such as Country & Western, Rock 'n Roll or Tap). In some North American examinations, levels include Newcomer, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Novice, Pre-championship, and Championship; each level may be further subdivided into either two or four separate sections.

There is a part of the ballroom world dedicated to college students. These chapters are typically clubs or teams that have an interest in ballroom dancing. Teams hold fundraisers, social events, and ballroom dance lessons. Ballroom dance teams' goals are to have fun and learn to dance well. There is a strong focus on finding a compatible dance partner and bonding with teammates. There is also a competitive side to collegiate ballroom - collegiate teams often hold competitions and invite other teams to participate. These competitions are often run with many of the same rules are regular amateur competitions as outlined above, but are usually organized entirely by collegiate teams. Examples include the MIT Open Ballroom Dance Competition and the Harvard Invitational.

"Ballroom dance" refers most often to the ten dances of International Ballroom (or Standard) and International Latin, though the term is also often used interchangeably with the five International Ballroom dances. <a href="Sequence%20dancing">Sequence dancing</a>, which is danced predominantly in the United Kingdom, and its development <a href="New%20Vogue%20%28dance%29">New Vogue</a> in Australia and New Zealand, are also sometimes included as a type of Ballroom dancing.

In the United States and Canada, the American Style (American Smooth and American Rhythm) also exists. The dance technique used for both International and American styles is similar, but International Ballroom allows only <a href="Ballroom%20glossary%23Closed%20position">closed dance positions</a>, whereas American Smooth allows closed, open and separated dance movements. In addition, different sets of dance figures are usually taught for the two styles. International Latin and American Rhythm have different styling, and have different dance figures in their respective syllabi.

Other dances sometimes placed under the umbrella "ballroom dance" include Nightclub Dances such as <a href="Lindy%20Hop">Lindy Hop</a>, <a href="West%20Coast%20Swing">West Coast Swing</a>, <a href="Nightclub%20Two%20Step">Nightclub Two Step</a>, <a href="Hustle%20%28dance%29">Hustle</a>, <a href="Salsa%20%28dance%29">Salsa</a>, and <a href="merengue%20%28dance%29">Merengue</a>.
The categorization of dances as "ballroom dances" has always been fluid, with new dances or folk dances being added to or removed from the ballroom repertoire from time to time, so no list of subcategories or dances is any more than a description of current practices. There are other dances historically accepted as ballroom dances, and are revived via the <a href="Vintage%20dance">Vintage dance</a> movement.

In Europe, Latin Swing dances include <a href="Argentine%20Tango">Argentine Tango</a>, <a href="Mambo%20%28dance%29">Mambo</a>, <a href="Lindy%20Hop">Lindy Hop</a>, Swing Boogie (sometimes also known as Nostalgic Boogie), and <a href="Disco%20Fox">Disco Fox</a>. One example of this is the subcategory of <a href="Cajun%20dance">Cajun dance</a>s that originated in <a href="Acadiana">Acadiana</a>, with branches reaching both coasts of the United States.

Ballroom/Smooth dances are normally danced to Western music (often from the mid-twentieth century), and couples dance counter-clockwise around a rectangular floor following the <a href="Ballroom%20glossary%23Line%20of%20dance">line of dance</a>. In competitions, competitors are costumed as would be appropriate for a <a href="white%20tie">white tie</a> affair, with full gowns for the ladies and <a href="bow%20tie">bow tie</a> and <a href="tail%20coat">tail coat</a>s for the men; though in American Smooth it is now conventional for the men to abandon the tailsuit in favor of shorter <a href="tuxedo%20%28clothing%29">tuxedo</a>s, vests, and other creative outfits.

Latin/Rhythm dances are commonly danced to contemporary Latin American music and (in case of Jive) Western music. With the exception of a few traveling dances like <a href="Samba%20%28ballroom%29">Samba</a> and <a href="Paso%20Doble">Paso Doble</a>, couples do not follow the line of dance but perform their routines more or less in one spot. In competitions, the women are often dressed in short-skirted <a href="Latin%20dance">Latin</a> outfits while the men are outfitted in tight-fitting shirts and pants, the goal being to emphasize the dancers' leg action and body movements.

Waltz began as a country folk dance in Austria and Bavaria in the 1600s. In the early 1800s it was introduced in England. It was the first dance where a man held a woman close to his body. When performing the dance the upper body is kept to the left throughout all figures, woman's body leaves the right side of the man while the head is extended to follow the elbow. Figures with rotation have little rise. Sway is also used on the second step to make the step longer and also to slow down the momentum by bringing feet together. Waltz is performed for both International Standard and American Smooth.

Viennese waltz originated in Provence area in France in 1559, and is recognized as the oldest of all ballroom dances. It was introduced in England as German waltz in 1812 and became popular throughout the 19th century by the music of Josef and Johann Strauss. It is often referred to as the classic “old-school” ballroom.Viennese Waltz music is quite fast. Slight shaping of the body moves towards the inside of the turn and shaping forward and up to lengthen the opposite side from direction. Reverse turn is used to travel down long side and is overturned. While natural turn is used to travel short side and is underturned to go around the corners. Viennese waltz is performed for both International Standard and American Smooth.

Tango originated in Buenos Aires in the late 1800s. Modern Argentine tango is danced in both open and closed embraces which focuses on the male leader and the women moving in harmony of the tango’s passionate charging music. The tango’s technique is like walking to the music while keeping feet grounded and allowing ankles and knees to brush against one another during each step taken. Body weight is kept over the toes and the connection is held between the man and women in the hips. 

Ballroom tango, however, is a dance with a far more open frame, often utilising strong and staccato movements. It is ballroom tango, rather than argentine tango that is performed in international competition.

The foxtrot is a true American dance, credited by a vaudeville performer Harry Fox in 1914. Fox was rapidly trotting step to ragtime music ( an original form of jazz). The dance was originally named as the “Fox’s trot”.The foxtrot can be danced at slow, medium, or fast tempos depending on the speed of the jazz or big band music. The partners are facing one another and frame rotates from one side to another, changing direction after a measure. The dance is flat, with no rise and fall like the waltz. The walking steps are taken as slow for the two beats per steps and quick for one beat per step. Foxtrot is performed for both International Standard and American Smooth.

The quickstep was invented in the 1920s as a combination of faster tempo of foxtrot and the Charleston. It is a fast moving dance so men are allowed to close their feet and the couples move in short syncopated steps. Quick step includes the walks, runs, chasses and turns, of the original foxtrot dance, with some other fast figures such as locks, hops, and skips can be added. Quick step is performed as an International Standard dance.

Samba is the national dance of Brazil. The rhythm of samba and its name originated from West African slaves. In 1905, samba became known to the rest of the countries during an exhibition in Paris. Eventually in 1940s, samba was introduced in America due to a movie star named Carmen Miranda.The modern ballroom samba dance differs compared to the traditional Brazilian samba as it was modified as a partner dance. Samba is danced with a slight bounce which is created through the bending and straightening the knee. Samba is performed as an International Latin dance.

The cha-cha was originally called the “cha-cha-cha.” The term came from Haiti and resembled the sound the bells made when rubbed. It was evolved from the rumba and mambo in the 1950s. Since mambo music was quite fast and difficult for some to dance to, a Cuban composer Enrique Jorrin slowed the music down and cha-cha was established.Cha-cha is a very flirtatious dance with many hip rotations and partners synchronizing their movements. The dance includes bending and straightening of the knee giving it a touch of Cuban motion. Cha-cha is performed for both International Latin and American Rhythm.

Rumba is known to be the most romantic and passionate of all dances. In the early 1920s, the dance came to the United States from Cuba and became a popular cabaret dance during prohibition.Rumba is very polyrhythmic and complex. It includes Cuban motions through knee-strengthening, figure- eight hip rotation and swiveling foot action. An important characteristic of rumba is the powerful and direct lead achieved through the ball of the foot. Rumba is performed for both International Latin and American Rhythm.

The paso doble originated from France and its dramatic bullfights. The dance is mostly performed only in competitions and rarely socially due to many choreographic rules. The man plays the role of the matador while the women take the role of the matador’s cape, the bull, or even the matador too.The chassez cape refers to the man using the woman to turn her as if she is the cape and the apel is when man stomps his foot to get the bull's attention. Paso double is performed as an International Latin dance.

The jive is part of the swing dance group and is a very lively variation of the jitterbug. Jive originated from African American clubs in the early 1940s. During World War II, American soldiers introduced the jive in England where it was adapted to today's competitive jive.In jive, the male leads the dance while the women encourage the men to ask them to dance. It is danced to big band music and some technique is taken from salsa, swing and tango. Jive is performed as an International Latin dance.

Swing in 1927 was originally named the Lindy Hop named by Shorty George Snowden. There have been 40 different versions documented over the years, most common is the East Coast swing which is performed in the American Smooth (or American Rhythm) only in the U.S. or Canada. The East Coast swing was established by Arthur Murray and others only shortly after World War II.Swing music is very lively and upbeat and can be danced to jazz or big band music. The swing dancing is a style with lots of bounce and energy. Swing also includes many spins and underarm turns. East Coast swing is performed as an American Rhythm dance.

The original version of bolero was created by Sebastian Cerezo in Cadiz, Spain during the 18th century. However, the bolero performed now was modified in Cuba a century later. The dance represents the couple falling in love.Bolero is a combination of many dances and is danced to Spanish vocals with fine percussion beat. It is like a slow salsa with contra-body moment of tango, patterns of rumba and rise and fall technique and personality of waltz and foxtrot. Bolero can be dance in a close hold or singly and then coming back together. Bolero is performed as an American Rhythm dance.

Mambo originated from Cuba but the name came from Haiti. Mambo music was first written in late 1930s by a Cuban composer. Eventually in the late 1940s, a musician named Perez Prado invented the dance mambo. Perez introduced the dance from Havana to Mexico, and making its way up to New York. Mambo is performed as an American Rhythm dance.

The film chronicles the relationship of two families in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> and <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction era</a> over the course of several years: the pro-<a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> <a href="Northern%20United%20States">Northern</a> Stonemans and the pro-<a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a> <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern</a> Camerons. The <a href="Assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">assassination</a> of <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> by <a href="John%20Wilkes%20Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a> is <a href="Dramatization">dramatized</a>.

The film was a commercial success, though it was highly controversial for its portrayal of black men (many played by <a href="White%20people">white</a> actors in <a href="blackface">blackface</a>) as unintelligent and sexually aggressive towards white women, and the portrayal of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> (KKK) (whose original founding is dramatized) as a heroic force. There were widespread African-American protests against "The Birth of a Nation", such as in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, while thousands of white Bostonians flocked to see the film. The <a href="NAACP">NAACP</a> spearheaded an unsuccessful campaign to ban the film. Griffith's indignation at efforts to censor or ban the film motivated him to produce "<a href="Intolerance%20%28film%29">Intolerance</a>" the following year.

The film's release is also credited as being one of the events that inspired the formation of the "second era" Ku Klux Klan at <a href="Stone%20Mountain">Stone Mountain</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, in the same year. "The Birth of a Nation", along with the trial and lynching of <a href="Leo%20Frank">Leo Frank</a> for the 1913 murder of <a href="Mary%20Phagan">Mary Phagan</a> in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>, was used as a recruiting tool for the KKK. Under President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, it was the first American motion picture to be screened at the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>.

Griffith's innovative techniques and storytelling power have made "The Birth of a Nation" one of the landmarks of <a href="History%20of%20film">film history</a>. In 1992, the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">United States Library of Congress</a> deemed the film "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and selected it for preservation in the <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a>.

The film follows two <a href="wikt%3Ajuxtaposed">juxtaposed</a> families. One is the Northern Stonemans: <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> U.S. Representative Austin Stoneman (based on the Reconstruction-era Representative <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a>), his daughter, and two sons. The other is the Southern Camerons: Dr. Cameron, his wife, their three sons and two daughters.

Phil, the elder Stoneman son, falls in love with Margaret Cameron, during the brothers' visit to the Cameron estate in <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, representing the <a href="Old%20South">Old South</a>. Meanwhile, young Ben Cameron idolizes a picture of Elsie Stoneman.

During the Civil War, the young men from both families enlist in their respective armies for the war. The younger Stoneman and two of the Cameron brothers are killed in the war. Meanwhile, the Cameron women are rescued by Confederate soldiers who rout a black militia, after an attack on the Cameron home. Ben Cameron leads a heroic charge at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Petersburg">Siege of Petersburg</a>, earning the nickname of "the Little Colonel". But he is also wounded and captured. He is then taken to a Union hospital in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> During his stay at the hospital, he is told that he will be hanged. Also at the hospital, he meets Elsie Stoneman, whose picture he has been carrying; she is working there as a nurse. Elsie takes Cameron's mother, who had traveled to Washington to tend her son, to see <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, and Mrs. Cameron persuades the President to pardon Ben.

When <a href="Assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">Lincoln is assassinated</a> at <a href="Ford%27s%20Theater">Ford's Theater</a>, his conciliatory postwar policy expires with him. In the wake of the president's death, Austin Stoneman and other <a href="Radical%20Republicans">Radical Republicans</a> are determined to punish the South, employing harsh measures that Griffith depicts as having been typical of the <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction era</a>.

Stoneman and his protégé Silas Lynch, a <a href="mulatto">mulatto</a> exhibiting psychopathic tendencies, head to <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> to observe the implementation of Reconstruction policies firsthand. During the election, in which Lynch is elected lieutenant governor, blacks are observed <a href="Ballot%20box%20stuffing">stuffing the ballot boxes</a>, while many Whites are denied the vote. The newly elected, mostly black members of the South Carolina legislature are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up on his desk, and others drinking liquor and feasting on stereotypically African American fare such as <a href="fried%20chicken">fried chicken</a>.

Meanwhile, inspired by observing white children pretending to be ghosts to scare black children, Ben fights back by forming the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. As a result, Elsie, out of loyalty to her father, breaks off her relationship with Ben. Later, Flora Cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by Gus, a <a href="freedman">freedman</a> and soldier who is now a captain. He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer. When he does, she leaps to her death. Having run through the forest looking for her, Ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the Cameron home. In response, the Klan hunts down Gus, tries him, finds him guilty, and <a href="Lynching">lynches</a> him.

Lynch then orders a crackdown on the Klan after discovering Gus' murder. He also secures the passing of legislation allowing mixed-race marriages. Dr. Cameron is arrested for possessing Ben's <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan%20regalia%20and%20insignia">Klan regalia</a>, now considered a crime punishable by death. He is rescued by Phil Stoneman and a few of his black servants. Together with Margaret Cameron, they flee. When their wagon breaks down, they make their way through the woods to a small hut that is home to two sympathetic former Union soldiers who agree to hide them. An <a href="intertitle">intertitle</a> states, "The former enemies of North and South are united again in defense of their <a href="Aryan">Aryan</a> birthright."

Congressman Stoneman leaves to avoid being connected with Lt. Gov. Lynch's crackdown. Elsie, learning of Dr. Cameron's arrest, goes to Lynch to plead for his release. Lynch, who had been lusting after Elsie, tries to force her to marry him, which causes her to faint. Stoneman returns, causing Elsie to be placed in another room. At first, Stoneman is happy when Lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but is then angered when Lynch tells him that it is Stoneman's daughter. Undercover Klansmen spies go to get help when they discover Elsie's plight after she breaks a window and cries out for help. Elsie falls unconscious again, and revives while gagged and being bound. The Klan, gathered together at full strength and with Ben leading them, rides in to gain control of the town. When news about Elsie reaches Ben, he and others go to her rescue. Elsie frees her mouth and screams for help. Lynch is captured. Victorious, the Klansmen celebrate in the streets. Meanwhile, Lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the Camerons are hiding. The Klansmen, with Ben at their head, race in to save them just in time. The next election day, blacks find a line of mounted and armed Klansmen just outside their homes, and are intimidated into not voting.

The film concludes with a double wedding as Margaret Cameron marries Phil Stoneman and Elsie Stoneman marries Ben Cameron. The masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away. The scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a>. The penultimate title is: "Dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial War shall rule no more. But instead — the gentle Prince in the Hall of Brotherly Love in the City of Peace."

In 1912, <a href="Thomas%20Dixon%2C%20Jr.">Thomas Dixon, Jr.</a> decided that he wanted to turn his popular 1905 novel/play "The Clansman" into a film, and began visiting various studios to see if they were interested. In late 1913, Dixon met the film producer Harry Aitken, who was interested in making a film out of "The Clansman", and through Aitken, Dixon met Griffith. Griffith began production in July 1914 and was finished by October 1914. "The Birth of a Nation" began <a href="Principal%20photography">filming</a> in 1914 and pioneered such camera techniques as close-ups, fade-outs, and a carefully staged battle sequence with hundreds of extras made to look like thousands. It also contained many new artistic techniques, such as color tinting for dramatic purposes, building up the plot to an exciting climax, dramatizing history alongside fiction, and featuring its own musical score written for an orchestra.

The film was based on Dixon's novels "<a href="The%20Clansman">The Clansman</a>" and "<a href="The%20Leopard%27s%20Spots">The Leopard's Spots</a>". It was originally to have been shot in <a href="Kinemacolor">Kinemacolor</a>, but <a href="D.%20W.%20Griffith">D. W. Griffith</a> took over the Hollywood studio of Kinemacolor and its plans to film Dixon's novel. Griffith, whose father served as a colonel in the <a href="Confederate%20Army">Confederate Army</a>, agreed to pay Thomas Dixon $10,000 (equivalent to $ today) for the rights to his play "The Clansman". Since he ran out of money and could afford only $2,500 of the original option, Griffith offered Dixon 25 percent interest in the picture. Dixon reluctantly agreed, and the unprecedented success of the film made him rich. Dixon's proceeds were the largest sum any author had received for a motion picture story and amounted to several million dollars. The American historian <a href="John%20Hope%20Franklin">John Hope Franklin</a> suggested that many aspects of the script for "The Birth of a Nation" appeared to reflect Dixon's concerns more than Griffith's, as Dixon had an obsession in his novels of describing in loving detail the lynchings of black men, which did not reflect Griffith's interests.

Griffith's budget started at US$40,000 (equivalent to $ today) but rose to over $100,000 (the equivalent of $ in <a href="constant%20dollars">constant dollars</a>).

<a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">West Point</a> engineers provided technical advice on the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> battle scenes, providing Griffith with the artillery used in the film. Some scenes from the movie were filmed on the porches and lawns of <a href="Homewood%20Plantation%20%28Natchez%2C%20Mississippi%29">Homewood Plantation</a> in Natchez, Mississippi.

The <a href="film%20premiere">film premiere</a>d on February 8, 1915, at <a href="Clune%27s%20Auditorium">Clune's Auditorium</a> in downtown Los Angeles. At its, premiere the film was entitled "The Clansman;" the title was later changed to "The Birth of a Nation" to reflect Griffith's belief that the United States emerged from the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> and Reconstruction as a unified nation.

The film is in the <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a>.

Although "The Birth of a Nation" is commonly regarded as a landmark for its dramatic and visual innovations, its use of music was arguably no less revolutionary. Though film was still silent at the time, it was common practice to distribute musical <a href="Cue%20%28theatrical%29">cue sheets</a>, or less commonly, <a href="full%20score">full score</a>s (usually for <a href="Theatre%20organ">organ</a> or <a href="piano">piano</a> accompaniment) along with each print of a film.

For "The Birth of a Nation", composer <a href="Joseph%20Carl%20Breil">Joseph Carl Breil</a> created a three-hour-long musical score that combined all three types of music in use at the time: adaptations of existing works by classical composers, new arrangements of well-known melodies, and original composed music. Though it had been specifically composed for the film, Breil's score was not used for the Los Angeles première of the film at <a href="Clune%27s%20Auditorium">Clune's Auditorium</a>; rather, a score compiled by Carli Elinor was performed in its stead, and this score was used exclusively in West Coast showings. Breil's score was not used until the film debuted in New York at the <a href="Liberty%20Theatre">Liberty Theatre</a>, and was the score utilized in all showings save those on the West Coast.

Outside of original compositions, Breil adapted classical music for use in the film, including passages from "<a href="Der%20Freisch%C3%BCtz">Der Freischütz</a>" by <a href="Carl%20Maria%20von%20Weber">Carl Maria von Weber</a>, "<a href="Leichte%20Kavallerie">Leichte Kavallerie</a>" by <a href="Franz%20von%20Supp%C3%A9">Franz von Suppé</a>, <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Beethoven%29">Symphony No. 6</a> by <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a>, and "<a href="Ride%20of%20the%20Valkyries">Ride of the Valkyries</a>" by <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>, the latter used as a <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a> during the ride of the KKK. Breil also arranged several traditional and popular tunes that would have been recognizable to audiences at the time, including many Southern melodies; among these songs were "<a href="Maryland%2C%20My%20Maryland">Maryland, My Maryland</a>", "<a href="Dixie%20%28song%29">Dixie</a>", "<a href="Old%20Folks%20at%20Home">Old Folks at Home</a>", "<a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>", "<a href="America%20the%20Beautiful">America the Beautiful</a>", "<a href="The%20Battle%20Hymn%20of%20the%20Republic">The Battle Hymn of the Republic</a>", "<a href="Auld%20Lang%20Syne">Auld Lang Syne</a>", and "<a href="Where%20Did%20You%20Get%20That%20Hat%3F">Where Did You Get That Hat?</a>".

In his original compositions for the film, Breil wrote numerous <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>s to accompany the appearance of specific characters. The principal love theme that was created for the romance between Elsie Stoneman and Ben Cameron was published as "The Perfect Song" and is regarded as the first marketed "theme song" from a film; it was later used as the theme song for the popular radio and television sitcom "<a href="Amos%20%27n%27%20Andy">Amos 'n' Andy</a>".

The <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> (NAACP), founded in 1909, protested premieres of the film in numerous cities. According to the historian David Copeland, "by the time of the movie's March 3 [1915] premiere in New York City, its subject matter had embroiled the film in charges of racism, protests, and calls for <a href="censorship">censorship</a>, which began after the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP requested the city's film board ban the movie. Since film boards were composed almost entirely of whites, few review boards initially banned Griffith's picture". The NAACP also conducted a public education campaign, publishing articles protesting the film's fabrications and inaccuracies, organizing petitions against it, and conducting education on the facts of the war and Reconstruction.

Because of the lack of success in NAACP's actions to ban the film, on April 17, 1915, NAACP secretary <a href="Mary%20Childs%20Nerney">Mary Childs Nerney</a> wrote to NAACP Executive Committee member George Packard: "I am utterly disgusted with the situation in regard to "The Birth of a Nation" ... kindly remember that we have put six weeks of constant effort of this thing and have gotten nowhere."

<a href="Jane%20Addams">Jane Addams</a>, an American social worker and social reformer, and the founder of <a href="Hull%20House">Hull House</a>, voiced her reaction to the film in an interview published by the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" on March 13, 1915, just ten days after the film was released. She stated that "One of the most unfortunate things about this film is that it appeals to race prejudice upon the basis of conditions of half a century ago, which have nothing to do with the facts we have to consider to-day. Even then it does not tell the whole truth. It is claimed that the play is historical: but history is easy to misuse." In New York, Rabbi <a href="Stephen%20Samuel%20Wise">Stephen Samuel Wise</a> told the press after seeing "The Birth of a Nation" that the film was "an indescribable foul and loathsome libel on a race of human beings". In Boston, the civil right activist <a href="William%20Monroe%20Trotter">William Monroe Trotter</a> organized demonstrations against the film, which he predicated was going to worsen race relations, while <a href="Booker%20T.%20Washington">Booker T. Washington</a> wrote a newspaper column asking readers to boycott the film. In Washington D.C, the Reverend <a href="Francis%20James%20Grimk%C3%A9">Francis James Grimké</a> published a pamphlet entitled "Fighting a Vicious Film" that challenged the historical accuracy of "The Birth of a Nation" on a scene-by-scene basis.

When the film was released, riots broke out in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, and other major cities in the United States. The film's inflammatory nature was a catalyst for gangs of whites to attack blacks. On 24 April 1916, the "<a href="Chicago%20American">Chicago American</a>" reported that a white man murdered a black teenager in <a href="Lafayette%2C%20Indiana">Lafayette</a>, Indiana after seeing the film, although there has been some controversy as to whether the murderer had actually seen "The Birth of a Nation". The mayor of <a href="Cedar%20Rapids%2C%20Iowa">Cedar Rapids, Iowa</a> was the first of twelve mayors to ban the film in 1915 out of concern that it would promote race prejudice, after meeting with a delegation of black citizens. The NAACP set up a precedent-setting national <a href="boycott">boycott</a> of the film, likely seen as the most successful effort. Additionally, they organized a mass demonstration when the film was screened in Boston, and it was banned in three states and several cities.

<a href="Thomas%20Dixon%2C%20Jr.">Thomas Dixon, Jr.</a>, author of "The Birth of a Nation"s source play and novel "<a href="The%20Clansman">The Clansman</a>", was a former classmate of then-president <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> at <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20University">Johns Hopkins University</a>. Dixon managed to arrange a screening of "The Birth of a Nation" at the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> for Wilson, members of his cabinet, and their families, in what was at the time one of the first ever screenings at the White House. Wilson was falsely reported to have said about the film, "It is like writing history with lightning. And my only regret is that it is all so terribly true". Wilson's aide, <a href="Joseph%20Tumulty">Joseph Tumulty</a>, denied the claims and said that "the President was entirely unaware of the nature of the play before it was presented and at no time has expressed his approbation of it." Historians believe the quote attributed to Wilson originated with Dixon, who was relentless in publicizing the film. After controversy over the film had grown, Wilson wrote that he disapproved of the "unfortunate production". Besides for having the film screened at the White House, Dixon persuaded all 9 justices of the Supreme Count to attend a screening of "The Birth of a Nation" as well many members of Congress. With the help of the Navy Secretary, Josephus Danials, Dixon was able to meet the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, <a href="Edward%20Douglass%20White">Edward Douglass White</a>. Initially Justice White was not interested in seeing the film, but when Dixon told him it was the "true story" of Reconstruction and the Klan's role in "saving the South", White, recalling his youth in Louisiana, jumped to attention and said: "I was a member of the Klan, sir". With White agreeing to see the film, the rest of the Supreme Court followed. Dixon was clearly rattled and upset by criticism by African-Americans that the film version of his books was projecting hatred against them, and wanted the endorsement of many powerful men as possible to offset such criticism. 

Dixon always vehemently denied having anti-black prejudices-despite the way his books promoted white supremacy-and stated: "My books are hard reading for a Negro, and yet the Negroes, in denouncing them, are unwitting denouncing one of their greatest friends". Both Griffith and Dixon in letters to the press dismissed African-American protests against "The Birth of a Nation" under the grounds that "The Birth of a Nation" was a film that against miscegenation, and claimed that the only reason why black men disliked the film was because they wanted to have sex with white women. In a letter to "The New York Globe", Griffith wrote that the only reason why black people disliked his film was because it was "an influence against the intermarriage of blacks and whites". Dixon likewise called the NAACP "the Negro Intermarriage Society" who he charged was against "The Birth of a Nation" "for one reason only-because it opposes the marriage of blacks to whites". Griffith responded to his critics in his 1916 pamphlet "The Rise and Fall of a Free Speech in America", where he used much racialized language and images, such as a cartoon that depicted "censorship" as a monstrous black man with a lascivious expression on his face eyeing "free speech" who appeared as a white woman dressed in a white dress. "Free Speech" points at "Censorship" and says: "All history, all reason condemns you: GO!. In his pamphlet, Griffith called censorship "this malignant pygmy" who had mutated into a fully grown "Caliban" (a character from William Shakespeare's play "The Tempest" who is often depicted as a black man).

Griffith—indignant at the film's negative critical reception—wrote letters to newspapers and published a pamphlet in which he accused his critics of censoring unpopular opinions. When Sherwin Lewis of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Globe">The New York Globe</a>" wrote a piece that expressed criticism of the film's distorted portrayal of history and said that it was not worthy of constitutional protection because its purpose was to make a few "dirty dollars", Griffith responded that "the public should not be afraid to accept the truth, even though it might not like it". He also added that the man who wrote the editorial was "damaging my reputation as a producer" and "a liar and a coward". He conceived his next film, "<a href="Intolerance%20%28film%29">Intolerance</a>" (1916), as a response to those who had criticized his film.

Despite the film's controversy, "The Birth of a Nation" was very popular. At over three hours in length (including intermissions), the film was ground-breaking in its production value, budget and ambition. At the time, the film was unlike anything the American audiences had ever seen before. The "Los Angeles Times" in a review called "The Birth of a Nation" "the greatest picture ever made and the greatest drama ever filmed", going on to say "it was beyond doubt the most extraordinary picture that has ever been seen". The Reverend <a href="Charles%20Henry%20Parkhurst">Charles Henry Parkhurst</a> defended the film against the charge of racism by saying the film "was exactly true to history" by depicting freedmen as they were, and therefore the film was a "compliment to the black man" by showing how far black people had "advanced" since Reconstruction. The critic Dolly Dalrymple reported about an audience in Alabama "when I saw it, it was far from silent...incessant murmurs of approval, roars of laughter, grasps of anxiety, and outbursts of applause greeted every new picture on the screen".. One man viewing the film was so moved by the scene where Flora Cameron flees Gus to avoid to being raped that he took out his handgun and began firing at the screen in an effort to help her. The American author Katherine DuPre Lumpkin in her 1947 autobiography "The Making of a Southerner" recalled watching the film as a 18-year old in 1915: "Here was the black figure—and the fear of the white girl—though the scene blanked out just in time. Here were the sinister men the South scorned and the noble men the South revered. And through it all the Klan rode. All around me people sighed and shivered, and now and then shouted or wept, in their intensity." Dixon himself was well pleased with the reaction of white audiences to the film. In a letter sent on 1 May 1915 to Joseph P. Tumulty, the press secretary to President Wilson, Dixon wrote: "The real purpose of my film was to revolutionize Northern sentiments by a presentation of history that would transform every man in the audience into a good Democrat...Every man who comes out of the theater is a Southern partisan for life!". In letter to President Wilson sent on 5 September 1915, Dixon boasted: "This play is transforming the entire population of the North and the West into sympathetic Southern voters. There will never be an issue of your segregation policy". Dixon was alluding to the fact that Wilson upon becoming president in 1913 had tried as many black federal civil servants as possible and imposed segregation on Washington D.C., which at the time was run by the federal government. The film was so popular that in November 1915, <a href="William%20Joseph%20Simmons">William Joseph Simmons</a> revived the Klan in Atlanta, Georgia. The film was very popular with white audiences in the South, and Franklin observed that, had it not been for "The Birth of a Nation", the Klan might not have been reborn in 1915. 

The box office gross of "The Birth of a Nation" is not known, and was long subject to exaggeration. At the end of 1917, <a href="Epoch%20%28distributor%29">Epoch</a> reported to its shareholders cumulative receipts of $4.8 million, and Griffith's own records put Epoch's worldwide earnings from the film at $5.2 million as of 1919, although the distributor's share of the revenue at this time was much lower than the exhibition gross. In the biggest cities, Epoch negotiated with individual theater owners for a percentage of the box office; elsewhere, the producer sold all rights in a particular state to a single distributor (an arrangement known as "state's rights" distribution). The film historian <a href="Richard%20Schickel">Richard Schickel</a> says that under the state's rights contracts, Epoch typically received about 10% of the box office gross—which theater owners often underreported—and concludes that ""Birth" certainly generated more than $60 million in box-office business in its first run". By 1940 "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine estimated the film's cumulative <a href="gross%20rental">gross rental</a> (the distributor's earnings) at approximately $15 million. For years "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" had the gross rental listed as $50 million, but in 1977 repudiated the claim and revised its estimate down to $5 million. It is not known for sure how much the film has earned in total, but producer Harry Aitken put its estimated earnings at $15–18 million in a letter to a prospective investor in a proposed sound version. It is likely the film earned over $20 million for its backers, and generated $50–100 million in box office receipts.

The film played at the <a href="Liberty%20Theater">Liberty Theater</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> for 44 weeks and tickets were priced at $2.20 ($51.50 in 2015 dollars).

D. W. Griffith made a film in 1916, called "<a href="Intolerance%20%28film%29">Intolerance</a>", partly in response to the criticism that "Birth of a Nation" received. Griffith has made clear within numerous interviews that the film's title and main themes were chosen in response to those who Griffith felt had been intolerant to his "Birth of a Nation".

A sequel called "<a href="The%20Fall%20of%20a%20Nation">The Fall of a Nation</a>" was released in 1916. It was the first sequel in film history. The film was directed by <a href="Thomas%20Dixon%2C%20Jr.">Thomas Dixon, Jr.</a>, who adapted it from <a href="The%20Fall%20of%20a%20Nation%20%28novel%29">his own novel of the same name</a>. The film has three acts and a prologue. Despite its success in the foreign market, the film was not a success among the American audiences. It is believed that it is now a <a href="lost%20film">lost film</a>.

In 1918, an American silent drama film directed by John W. Noble called "<a href="The%20Birth%20of%20a%20Race">The Birth of a Race</a>" was released as a direct response to "The Birth of a Nation". The film was an ambitious project by producer <a href="Emmett%20Jay%20Scott">Emmett Jay Scott</a> to challenge Griffith's film and tell another side of the story, but was ultimately unsuccessful.

In 1919, the director/producer/writer <a href="Oscar%20Micheaux">Oscar Micheaux</a> released "<a href="Within%20Our%20Gates">Within Our Gates</a>", a response from the African-American community. Notably, he reversed a key scene of Griffith's film by depicting a white man assaulting a black woman.

The film was remixed in 2004 as "Rebirth of a Nation", a live cinema experience by <a href="DJ%20Spooky">DJ Spooky</a> at Lincoln Center, and has toured at many venues around the world including <a href="The%20Acropolis">The Acropolis</a> as a live cinema "remix". The remix version was also presented at Paula Cooper Gallery in New York.

In 2016, <a href="Nate%20Parker">Nate Parker</a> produced and directed the film "<a href="The%20Birth%20of%20a%20Nation%20%282016%20film%29">The Birth of a Nation</a>", based on the 1831 slave rebellion led by <a href="Nat%20Turner">Nat Turner</a>. Parker states:I've reclaimed this title and re-purposed it as a tool to challenge racism and white supremacy in America, to inspire a riotous disposition toward any and all injustice in this country (and abroad) and to promote the kind of honest confrontation that will galvanize our society toward healing and sustained systemic change.

The film remains controversial due to its interpretation of American history. <a href="University%20of%20Houston">University of Houston</a> historian Steven Mintz summarizes its message as follows: <a href="Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a> was a disaster, blacks could never be <a href="racial%20integration">integrated</a> into white society as equals, and the violent actions of the Ku Klux Klan were justified to reestablish honest government. The South is portrayed as a victim. The first overt mentioning of the war is the scene in which Abraham Lincoln signs the call for the first 75,000 volunteers. However, the first aggression in the Civil War, made when the Confederate troops fired on <a href="Fort%20Sumter">Fort Sumter</a> in 1861, is not mentioned in the film. The film suggested that the Ku Klux Klan restored order to the postwar South, which was depicted as endangered by abolitionists, freedmen, and <a href="carpetbagger">carpetbagging</a> <a href="United%20States%20Republican%20Party">Republican</a> politicians from the North. This reflects the so-called <a href="Dunning%20School">Dunning School</a> of historiography. The film is slightly less extreme than the books upon which it is based, in which Dixon misrepresented Reconstruction as a nightmarish time when black men ran amok, storming into weddings to rape white women with impunity. 

The film portrayed President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> as a friend of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>, and refers to him as "the Great Heart". In this respect, the film has a certain basis in fact, as Lincoln insisted until the Emancipation Proclamation that he was not fighting to end slavery, and the proclamation did not free a single slave as it did not affect areas under Union control; for much of the war seriously considered a plan to sent all African-Americans to Africa after the war ended; and only embraced ending slavery in all the U.S. and citizenship for African-Americans in 1865 under pressure from the Radical Republicans in Congress. The two romances depicted in the film, Phil Stoneman with Margaret Cameron and Ben Cameron with Elsie Stoneman, reflect Griffith's retelling of history. The couples are used as a metaphor, representing the film's broader message of the need for the reconciliation of the North and South to defend white supremacy. Among both couples, there is an attraction that forms before the war, stemming from the friendship between their families. With the war, though, both families are split apart, and their losses culminate in the end of the war with the defense of white supremacy. One of the intertitles clearly sums up the message of unity, stating, "The former enemies of North and South are united again in defense of their Aryan birthright."

The film further reinforced the popular picture held by whites, especially in the South, of Reconstruction as a disaster. In his 1929 book "The Tragic Era: The Revolution After Lincoln", the respected historian <a href="Claude%20Bowers">Claude Bowers</a> treated "The Birth of a Nation" as a factually accurate account of Reconstruction. In "The Tragic Era", Bowers presented every black politician in the South as corrupt, portrayed Republican Representative <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a> as a vicious "race traitor" intent upon making blacks the equal of whites, and praised the Klan for "saving civilization" in the South. Bowers wrote about black empowerment that the worse sort of "scum" from the North like Stevens "inflamed the Negro's egoism and soon the lustful assaults began. Rape was the foul daughter of Reconstruction!". The American historian <a href="John%20Hope%20Franklin">John Hope Franklin</a> wrote that not only did Bowers treat "The Birth of a Nation" as accurate history, but his version of history seemed to be drawn from "The Birth of a Nation". Some historians, such as <a href="E.%20Merton%20Coulter">E. Merton Coulter</a> in his "The South Under Reconstruction" (1947), maintained the Dunning School view after World War II. Today, the Dunning School position is largely seen as a product of anti-black racism of the early 20th century, by which many Americans held that black Americans were unequal as citizens. Coulter in "The South During Reconstruction", which again treated "The Birth of a Nation" as historically correct, and painted a vivid picture of "black beasts" running amok, encouraged by alcohol-sodden, corrupt and vengeful black Republican politicians. Franklin wrote that as recently as the 1970s that the popular journalist <a href="Alistair%20Cooke">Alistair Cooke</a> in his books and TV shows was still essentially following the version of history set out by "The Birth of a Nation", noting that Cooke had much sympathy with the suffering of whites in Reconstruction while having almost nothing to say about the suffering of blacks or about how African-Americans were stripped of almost all their rights after 1877.

Veteran film reviewer <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> wrote:... stung by criticisms that the second half of his masterpiece was racist in its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan and its brutal images of blacks, Griffith tried to make amends in "Intolerance" (1916), which criticized prejudice. And in "<a href="Broken%20Blossoms">Broken Blossoms</a>" he told perhaps the first <a href="Miscegenation">interracial love</a> story in the movies—even though, to be sure, it's an idealized love with no touching. Despite some similarities between the Congressman Stoneman character and Rep. <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a> of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, Rep. Stevens did not have the family members described and did not move to South Carolina during Reconstruction. He died in Washington, D.C. in 1868. However, Stevens' biracial housekeeper, <a href="Lydia%20Hamilton%20Smith">Lydia Hamilton Smith</a>, was considered his common-law wife, and generously provided for in his will.

In the film, Abraham Lincoln is portrayed in a positive light due to his belief in conciliatory postwar policies towards southern whites. The president's views are directly contrasted by Austin Stonewall, a character shown in a negative light who acts as an antagonist. The assassination of Lincoln leads to the effective transition between the war and reconstruction, both of which are represented by the two acts of the film. In including the assassination, the film also establishes to the audience that the plot of the movie has historical basis. Franklin wrote the film's depiction of Reconstruction as a hellish time when black freedmen ran amok, raping and killing whites with impunity until the Klan stepped in is not supported by the facts. Franklin wrote that most freed slaves continued to work for their former masters in Reconstruction for the want of a better alternative, and though relations between freedmen and their former masters were not friendly, very few freedmen sought revenge against the people who had held them in chains. The character of Silas Lynch has no basis in fact, and during the Reconstruction no black or mulatto men served as the lieutenant governor of South Carolina.

The depictions of mass Klan paramilitary actions do not seem to have historical equivalents, although there were incidents in 1871 where Klan groups traveled from other areas in fairly large numbers to aid localities in disarming local companies of the all-black portion of the state militia under various justifications, prior to the eventual Federal troop intervention, and the organized Klan's continued activities as small groups of "night riders".

The <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> and other social movements created a new generation of historians, such as scholar <a href="Eric%20Foner">Eric Foner</a>, who led a reassessment of Reconstruction. Building on <a href="Black%20Reconstruction%20in%20America">W.E.B. DuBois' work</a> but also adding new sources, they focused on achievements of the African-American and white Republican coalitions, such as establishment of universal public education and charitable institutions in the South and extension of <a href="suffrage">suffrage</a> to black men. In response, the Southern-dominated <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> and its affiliated white militias had used extensive terrorism, intimidation and outright assassinations to suppress African-American leaders and voting in the 1870s and to regain power.

Released in 1915, "The Birth of a Nation" has been credited as groundbreaking among its contemporaries for its innovative application of the medium of film. According to the film historian <a href="Kevin%20Brownlow">Kevin Brownlow</a>, the film was "astounding in its time" and initiated "so many advances in film-making technique that it was rendered obsolete within a few years". The content of the work, however, has received widespread criticism for its blatantly racist and fantastical depictions of scenes that are presented onscreen as if in documentary form. Film critic Roger Ebert writes: Certainly "The Birth of a Nation" (1915) presents a challenge for modern audiences. Unaccustomed to silent films and uninterested in film history, they find it quaint and not to their taste. Those evolved enough to understand what they are looking at find the early and wartime scenes brilliant, but cringe during the postwar and Reconstruction scenes, which are racist in the ham-handed way of an old minstrel show or a vile comic pamphlet. <a href="Mary%20Pickford">Mary Pickford</a> said: ""Birth of a Nation" was the first picture that really made people take the motion picture industry seriously".

The film held the mantle of the <a href="Timeline%20of%20highest-grossing%20films">highest grossing film</a> until it was overtaken by "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Gone with the Wind</a>", ironically another film about the Civil War and Reconstruction. 

In 1992, the United States <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> deemed the film "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and selected it for preservation in the <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a>. Despite its controversial story, the film has been praised by film critics such as Ebert, who said: ""The Birth of a Nation" is not a bad film because it argues for evil. Like Riefenstahl's "<a href="Triumph%20of%20the%20Will">Triumph of the Will</a>", it is a great film that argues for evil. To understand how it does so is to learn a great deal about film, and even something about evil." The website "<a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>", which compiles reviews from various sources, indicates the film has a 100% approval rating.

According to a 2002 article in the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", the film facilitated the refounding of the Ku Klux Klan in 1915. <a href="History.com">History.com</a> similarly states that "There is no doubt that "Birth of a Nation" played no small part in winning wide public acceptance" for the KKK, and that throughout the film "African Americans are portrayed as brutish, lazy, morally degenerate, and dangerous." As late as the 1970s, the Ku Klux Klan continued to use the film as a recruitment tool.

<a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> recognition

In 2013, the American critic <a href="Richard%20Brody">Richard Brody</a> wrote "The Birth of a Nation" was :"...a seminal commercial spectacle but also a decisively original work of art—in effect, the founding work of cinematic realism, albeit a work that was developed to pass lies off as reality. It’s tempting to think of the film’s influence as evidence of the inherent corruption of realism as a cinematic mode—but it’s even more revealing to acknowledge the disjunction between its beauty, on the one hand, and, on the other, its injustice and falsehood. The movie’s fabricated events shouldn’t lead any viewer to deny the historical facts of slavery and Reconstruction. But they also shouldn’t lead to a denial of the peculiar, disturbingly exalted beauty of "Birth of a Nation", even in its depiction of immoral actions and its realization of blatant propaganda. The worst thing about "The Birth of a Nation" is how good it is. The merits of its grand and enduring aesthetic make it impossible to ignore and, despite its disgusting content, also make it hard not to love. And it’s that very conflict that renders the film all the more despicable, the experience of the film more of a torment—together with the acknowledgment that Griffith, whose short films for Biograph were already among the treasures of world cinema, yoked his mighty talent to the cause of hatred (which, still worse, he sincerely depicted as virtuous)." 

Brody also argued that Griffith unintentionally undercut his own thesis in the film, citing the scene before the Civil War when the Cameron family offers up lavish hospitality to the Stoneman family who travel pass mile after mile of slaves working the cotton fields of South Carolina to reach the Cameron home-maintaining that a modern audience can see that the wealth of the Camerons comes from the slaves forced to do back-breaking work picking the cotton. Likewise, Brody argued that the scene where people in South Carolina celebrate the Confederate victory at the Battle of Bull Run by dancing around the "eerie flare of a bonfire" which imply "a dance of death", foreshadowing the destruction of <a href="Sherman%27s%20March">Sherman's March</a> that was to come. In the same way, Brody wrote the scene where the Klan dumps Gus's body off at the doorstep of Lynch is meant to have the audience cheering, but modern audiences find the scene "obscene and horrifying". Finally, Brody argued that the end of the film, where the Klan prevents defenseless African-Africans from exercising their right to vote by pointing guns at them today seems "unjust and cruel".

One famous part of the film was added by Griffith only on the second run of the film and is missing from most online versions of the film (presumably taken from first run prints).

These are the second and third of three opening title cards which defend the film. The added titles read:

A PLEA FOR THE ART OF THE MOTION PICTURE:
We do not fear censorship, for we have no wish to offend with improprieties or obscenities, but we do demand, as a right, the liberty to show the dark side of wrong, that we may illuminate the bright side of virtue – the same liberty that is conceded to the art of the written word – that art to which we owe the Bible and the works of Shakespeare

and

If in this work we have conveyed to the mind the ravages of war to the end that war may be held in abhorrence, this effort will not have been in vain.

Various film historians have expressed a range of views about these titles. To Nicholas Andrew Miller, this shows that "Griffith's greatest achievement in "The Birth of a Nation" was that he brought the cinema's capacity for spectacle... under the rein of an outdated, but comfortably literary form of historical narrative. Griffith's models... are not the pioneers of film spectacle... but the giants of literary narrative". On the other hand, S. Kittrell Rushing complains about Griffith's "didactic" title-cards, while Stanley Corkin complains that Griffith "masks his idea of fact in the rhetoric of high art and free expression" and creates film which "erodes the very ideal" of "liberty" which he asserts.

"Birth of a Nation," even more than other films in the public domain, has been poorly represented in later releases. The problem, in part, is that Griffith and others have reworked the film, leaving no definitive version. According to the silent film website "Brenton Film", "there are a multitude of poor quality DVDs with different edits, scores, running speeds and usually in "definitely unoriginal" black and white".

There are exceptions. Among them is film preservationist <a href="David%20Shepard%20%28film%20preservationist%29">David Shepard</a>'s 1992 transfer of a <a href="16%20mm%20film">16mm</a> print for VHS and laserdisc release via <a href="Image%20Entertainment">Image Entertainment</a>. A short documentary, "The Making of The Birth of a Nation", newly produced and narrated by Shepard, was also included. Both were released on DVD by Image in 1998 and the UK's Eureka Entertainment in 2000.

In the UK, <a href="Photoplay%20Productions">Photoplay Productions</a> restored the <a href="Museum%20of%20Modern%20Art">Museum of Modern Art</a>'s <a href="35%20mm%20film">35mm</a> print that was the source of Shepard's 16 mm print, though they also augmented it with extra material from the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>. It was also given a full orchestral recording of the original Breil score. Though broadcast on <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> television and theatrically screened many times, Photoplay's 1993 version was never released on home video.

Shepard's transfer and documentary were reissued in the US by <a href="Kino%20International%20%28company%29">Kino Video</a> in 2002, this time in a 2-DVD set with added extras on the second disc. These included several Civil War shorts also directed by D.W. Griffith.

In 2011, Kino prepared a HD transfer of a 35 mm negative from the Paul Killiam Collection. They added some material from the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> and gave it a new compilation score. This version was released on Blu-ray by Kino in the US, Eureka in the UK (as part of their "<a href="Masters%20of%20Cinema">Masters of Cinema</a>" collection) and Divisa Home Video in Spain.

In 2015, the year of the film's centenary, <a href="Photoplay%20Productions">Photoplay Productions</a>' <a href="Patrick%20Stanbury">Patrick Stanbury</a>, in conjunction with the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>, carried out the first full restoration. It mostly used new <a href="4K%20resolution">4K</a> scans of the LoC's original camera negative, along with other early generation material. It, too, was given the original Breil score and featured the film's original tinting for the first time since its 1915 release. The restoration was released on a 2-Blu-ray set by the BFI, alongside a host of extras, including many other newly restored Civil War related films from the period.

Baltic Sea

The Baltic Sea is a <a href="sea">sea</a> of the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, enclosed by <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, <a href="Finland">Finland</a>, the <a href="Baltic%20countries">Baltic countries</a>, and the <a href="North%20European%20Plain">North and Central European Plain</a>.

The sea stretches from <a href="53rd%20parallel%20north">53°N</a> to <a href="66th%20parallel%20north">66°N</a> <a href="latitude">latitude</a> and from <a href="10th%20meridian%20east">10°E</a> to <a href="30th%20meridian%20east">30°E</a> <a href="longitude">longitude</a>. A <a href="mediterranean%20sea%20%28oceanography%29">mediterranean sea</a> of the Atlantic, with limited water exchange between the two bodies, the Baltic Sea drains through the <a href="Denmark">Danish</a> islands into the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a> by way of the straits of <a href="%C3%98resund">Øresund</a>, the <a href="Great%20Belt">Great Belt</a>, and the <a href="Little%20Belt">Little Belt</a>.

The <a href="Baltic%20Proper">Baltic Proper</a> is bordered on its northern edge, at the latitude <a href="60th%20parallel%20north">60°N</a>, by the <a href="%C3%85land%20islands">Åland islands</a> and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Bothnia">Gulf of Bothnia</a>, on its northeastern edge by the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Finland">Gulf of Finland</a>, on its eastern edge by the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a>, and in the west by the <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a> part of the southern Scandinavian Peninsula.

The Baltic Sea is connected by artificial waterways to the <a href="White%20Sea">White Sea</a> via the <a href="White%20Sea%20Canal">White Sea Canal</a> and to the <a href="German%20Bight">German Bight</a> of the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> via the <a href="Kiel%20Canal">Kiel Canal</a>.

Administration

The <a href="Helsinki%20Convention%20on%20the%20Protection%20of%20the%20Marine%20Environment%20of%20the%20Baltic%20Sea%20Area">Helsinki Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area</a> includes the Baltic Sea and the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a>, without calling Kattegat a part of the Baltic Sea, "For the purposes of this Convention the "Baltic Sea Area" shall be the Baltic Sea and the Entrance to the Baltic Sea, bounded by the parallel of the Skaw in the Skagerrak at 57°44.43'N."

Traffic history

Historically, the Kingdom of Denmark collected <a href="Sound%20Dues">Sound Dues</a> from ships at the border between the ocean and the land-locked Baltic Sea. They were collected in the <a href="%C3%98resund">Øresund</a> at <a href="Kronborg">Kronborg</a> castle near <a href="Helsing%C3%B8r">Helsingør</a>, in the <a href="Great%20Belt">Great Belt</a> at <a href="Nyborg">Nyborg</a>. In the <a href="Little%20Belt">Little Belt</a>, the site of intake was moved to <a href="Fredericia">Fredericia</a>, after that stronghold had been built. The narrowest part of Little Belt is the "Middelfart Sund" near <a href="Middelfart">Middelfart</a>.

Oceanography

Geographers widely agree that the preferred physical border of the Baltic is a line drawn through the southern Danish islands, <a href="Drogden-Sill">Drogden-Sill</a> and <a href="Langeland">Langeland</a>. The Drogden Sill is situated north of <a href="K%C3%B8ge%20Bugt">Køge Bugt</a> and connects <a href="Drag%C3%B8r">Dragør</a> in the south of <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> to <a href="Malm%C3%B6">Malmö</a>; it is used by the <a href="%C3%98resund%20Bridge">Øresund Bridge</a>, including the "Drogden Tunnel". By this definition, the <a href="Danish%20Straits">Danish Straits</a> are part of the entrance, but the <a href="Bay%20of%20Mecklenburg">Bay of Mecklenburg</a> and the <a href="Bay%20of%20Kiel">Bay of Kiel</a> are parts of the Baltic Sea.
Another usual border is the line between <a href="Falsterbo">Falsterbo</a>, Sweden and <a href="Stevns%20Klint">Stevns Klint</a>, Denmark, as this is the southern border of <a href="%C3%98resund">Øresund</a>. It's also the border between the shallow southern Øresund (with a typical depth of 5–10 meters only) and notably deeper water.

Hydrography and biology

<a href="Drogden">Drogden</a> Sill (depth of ) sets a limit to Øresund and <a href="Darss">Darss</a> Sill (depth of ), and a limit to the Belt Sea. The shallow <a href="Sill%20%28geology%29">sills</a> are obstacles to the flow of heavy salt water from the Kattegat into the basins around <a href="Bornholm">Bornholm</a> and <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a>.

The Kattegat and the southwestern Baltic Sea are well oxygenated and have a rich biology. The remainder of the Sea is brackish, poor in oxygen and in species. Thus, statistically, the more of the entrance that is included in its definition, the healthier the Baltic appears; conversely, the more narrowly it is defined, the more endangered its biology appears.

While <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> called it "Mare Suebicum" after the <a href="Germanic%20people">Germanic people</a> called the <a href="Suebi">Suebi</a>, Ptolemy - "Sarmatian Ocean", the first to name it the "Baltic Sea" ("<a href="wikt%3AMare%20Balticum">Mare Balticum</a>") was the eleventh-century German chronicler <a href="Adam%20of%20Bremen">Adam of Bremen</a>. The origin of the latter name is speculative and it was adopted into Slavic and Finnic languages spoken around the sea very likely due to the role of <a href="Medieval%20Latin">Medieval Latin</a> in <a href="cartography">cartography</a>. It might be connected to the Germanic word "belt", a name used for two of the Danish straits, <a href="the%20Belts">the Belts</a>, while others claim it to be directly derived from the source of the Germanic word, <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "balteus" (belt). <a href="Adam%20of%20Bremen">Adam of Bremen</a> himself compared the sea with a belt, stating that it is so named because it stretches through the land as a belt ("Balticus, eo quod in modum baltei longo tractu per Scithicas regiones tendatur usque in Greciam"). He might also have been influenced by the name of a legendary island mentioned in the <a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">"Natural History"</a> of <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>. Pliny mentions an island named <a href="Baltia">Baltia</a> (or "Balcia") with reference to accounts of <a href="Pytheas">Pytheas</a> and <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a>. It is possible that Pliny refers to an island named "Basilia" ("kingdom" or "royal") in "On the Ocean" by Pytheas. "Baltia" also might be derived from "belt" and mean "near belt of sea (strait)." Meanwhile, others have suggested that the name of the island originates from the <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Proto-Indo-European</a> root <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20070225150051/http%3A//starling.rinet.ru/cgi-bin/response.cgi%3Fsingle%3D1%26amp%3Bbasename%3D%252Fdata%252Fie%252Fpiet%26amp%3Btext_number%3D%2B129%26amp%3Broot%3Dconfig">*"bhel"</a> meaning "white, fair". This root and its basic meaning were retained in both Lithuanian (as "baltas") and Latvian (as "balts"). On this basis, a related hypothesis holds that the name originated from this Indo-European root via a <a href="Baltic%20language">Baltic language</a> such as Lithuanian. Another explanation is that, while derived from the aforementioned root, the name of the sea is related to names for various forms of water and related substances in several European languages, that might have been originally associated with colors found in swamps (compare Proto-Slavic "<a href="wikt%3AReconstruction%3AProto-Slavic/bolto">*bolto</a>" "swamp"). Yet another explanation is that the name originally meant "enclosed sea, bay" as opposed to open sea.
Some Swedish historians believe the name derives from the god Balder of Nordic mythology.

In the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> the sea was known by variety of names. The name "Baltic Sea" became dominant only after 1600. Usage of "Baltic" and similar terms to denote the region east of the sea started only in 19th century.

The Baltic Sea was known in ancient Latin language sources as "<a href="Mare%20Suebicum">Mare Suebicum</a>" or "Mare Germanicum". Older native names in languages that used to be spoken on the shores of the sea or near it usually indicate the geographical location of the sea (in Germanic languages), or its size in relation to smaller gulfs (in Old Latvian), or tribes associated with it (in Old Russian the sea was known as the Varanghian Sea). In modern languages it is known by the equivalents of "East Sea", "West Sea", or "Baltic Sea" in different languages:

At the time of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, the Baltic Sea was known as the "Mare Suebicum" or "Mare Sarmaticum". <a href="Gaius%20Cornelius%20Tacitus">Tacitus</a> in his AD 98 "Agricola" and "Germania" described the Mare Suebicum, named for the <a href="Suebi">Suebi</a> tribe, during the spring months, as a <a href="brackish">brackish</a> sea where the ice broke apart and chunks floated about. The Suebi eventually migrated south west to reside for a while in the Rhineland area of modern Germany, where their name survives in the historic region known as <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>. <a href="Jordanes">Jordanes</a> called it the "Germanic Sea" in his work, the "<a href="Getica">Getica</a>".

In the early <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, Norse (Scandinavian) merchants built a trade empire all around the Baltic. Later, the Norse fought for control of the Baltic against <a href="Wends">Wendish tribes</a> dwelling on the southern shore. The Norse also used the rivers of <a href="Russia">Russia</a> for trade routes, finding their way eventually to the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> and southern Russia. This Norse-dominated period is referred to as the <a href="Viking%20Age">Viking Age</a>.

Since the <a href="Viking%20age">Viking age</a>, the Scandinavians have referred to the Baltic Sea as "Austmarr" ("Eastern Lake"). "Eastern Sea", appears in the "<a href="Heimskringla">Heimskringla</a>" and "Eystra salt" appears in "<a href="S%C3%B6rla%20%C3%BE%C3%A1ttr">Sörla þáttr</a>". <a href="Saxo%20Grammaticus">Saxo Grammaticus</a> recorded in "<a href="Gesta%20Danorum">Gesta Danorum</a>" an older name, "<a href="Gandvik">Gandvik</a>", "-vik" being <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> for "bay", which implies that the Vikings correctly regarded it as an inlet of the sea. Another form of the name, "Grandvik", attested in at least one English translation of "Gesta Danorum", is likely to be a misspelling.)

In addition to fish the sea also provides <a href="amber">amber</a>, especially from its southern shores within today's borders of <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a> and <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a>. First mentions of amber deposits on the South coast of the Baltic Sea date back to the 12th century. The bordering countries have also traditionally exported lumber, <a href="Pine%20tar">wood tar</a>, <a href="flax">flax</a>, <a href="hemp">hemp</a> and furs by ship across the Baltic. Sweden had from early medieval times exported <a href="iron">iron</a> and <a href="silver">silver</a> mined there, while Poland had and still has extensive <a href="salt">salt</a> mines. Thus the Baltic Sea has long been crossed by much merchant shipping.

The lands on the Baltic's eastern shore were among the last in Europe to be converted to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>. This finally happened during the <a href="Northern%20Crusades">Northern Crusades</a>: <a href="Finland">Finland</a> in the twelfth century by Swedes, and what are now <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a> and <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a> in the early thirteenth century by Danes and Germans (<a href="Livonian%20Brothers%20of%20the%20Sword">Livonian Brothers of the Sword</a>). The <a href="Teutonic%20Order">Teutonic Order</a> gained control over parts of the southern and eastern shore of the Baltic Sea, where they set up <a href="Monastic%20state%20of%20the%20Teutonic%20Knights">their monastic state</a>. <a href="Lithuania">Lithuania</a> was <a href="Christianization%20of%20Lithuania">the last European state to convert to Christianity</a>.

In the period between the 8th and 14th centuries, there was much piracy in the Baltic from the coasts of <a href="Pomerania">Pomerania</a> and <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>, and the <a href="Victual%20Brothers">Victual Brothers</a> even held <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a>.

Starting in the 11th century, the southern and eastern shores of the Baltic were settled by migrants mainly from <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, a movement called the "<a href="Ostsiedlung">Ostsiedlung</a>" ("east settling"). Other settlers were from the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, and <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>. The <a href="Polabian%20Slavs">Polabian Slavs</a> were gradually assimilated by the Germans. <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> gradually gained control over most of the Baltic coast, until she lost much of her possessions after being defeated in the 1227 <a href="Battle%20of%20Bornh%C3%B6ved%20%281227%29">Battle of Bornhöved</a>.

In the 13th to 16th centuries, the strongest economic force in Northern Europe was the <a href="Hanseatic%20League">Hanseatic League</a>, a federation of merchant cities around the Baltic Sea and the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. In the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Poland</a>, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, and <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> fought wars for "<a href="Dominium%20maris%20baltici">Dominium maris baltici</a>" ("Lordship over the Baltic Sea"). Eventually, it was Sweden that <a href="Swedish%20Empire">virtually encompassed the Baltic Sea</a>. In Sweden the sea was then referred to as "Mare Nostrum Balticum" ("Our Baltic Sea"). The goal of Swedish warfare during the 17th century was to make the Baltic Sea an all-Swedish sea ("Ett Svenskt innanhav"), something that was accomplished except the rout between Riga in Latvia and <a href="Szczecin">Szczecin</a> in Poland. However, it was the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch</a> who dominated Baltic trade in the seventeenth century.

In the eighteenth century, <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russia</a> and <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a> became the leading powers over the sea. Sweden's defeat in the <a href="Great%20Northern%20War">Great Northern War</a> brought Russia to the eastern coast. Russia became and remained a dominating power in the Baltic. Russia's <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Russia">Peter the Great</a> saw the strategic importance of the Baltic and decided to found his new capital, <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, at the mouth of the <a href="Neva">Neva</a> river at the east end of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Finland">Gulf of Finland</a>. There was much trading not just within the Baltic region but also with the North Sea region, especially eastern <a href="England">England</a> and the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>: their fleets needed the Baltic timber, tar, flax and hemp.

During the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>, a joint <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> and <a href="France">French</a> fleet attacked the Russian fortresses in the Baltic. They bombarded <a href="Sveaborg">Sveaborg</a>, which guards <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>; and <a href="Kronstadt%2C%20Russia">Kronstadt</a>, which guards Saint Petersburg; and they destroyed <a href="Bomarsund%2C%20%C3%85land">Bomarsund</a> in the <a href="%C3%85land%20Islands">Åland Islands</a>. After the unification of <a href="Germany">Germany</a> in 1871, the whole southern coast became German. <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> was partly fought in the Baltic Sea. After 1920 <a href="Poland">Poland</a> was connected to the Baltic Sea by the <a href="Polish%20Corridor">Polish Corridor</a> and enlarged the port of <a href="Gdynia">Gdynia</a> in rivalry with the port of the <a href="Free%20City%20of%20Danzig">Free City of Danzig</a>.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Germany reclaimed all of the southern and much of the eastern shore by occupying Poland and the Baltic states. In 1945, the Baltic Sea became a mass grave for retreating soldiers and refugees on torpedoed <a href="Operation%20Hannibal">troop transports</a>. The sinking of the "<a href="Wilhelm%20Gustloff%20%28ship%29">Wilhelm Gustloff</a>" remains the worst maritime disaster in history, killing (very roughly) 9,000 people. In 2005, a Russian group of scientists found over five thousand airplane wrecks, sunken warships, and other material, mainly from World War II, on the bottom of the sea.

Since the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, various nations, including the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, have disposed of <a href="Chemical%20warfare">chemical weapons</a> in the Baltic Sea, raising concerns of environmental contamination. Even now fishermen accidentally retrieve some of these materials: the most recent available report from the Helsinki Commission notes that four small scale catches of chemical munitions representing approximately of material were reported in 2005. This is a reduction from the 25 incidents representing of material in 2003. Until now, the <a href="U.S.%20Government">U.S. Government</a> refuses to disclose the exact coordinates of the wreck sites. Rotting bottles leak <a href="Mustard%20gas">Lost</a> and other substances, thus slowly poisoning a substantial part of the Baltic Sea.

After 1945, the <a href="Flight%20and%20expulsion%20of%20Germans%20%281944%E2%80%931950%29">German population was expelled</a> from all areas east of the <a href="Oder-Neisse%20line">Oder-Neisse line</a>, making room for displaced Poles and Russians. Poland <a href="Former%20eastern%20territories%20of%20Germany">gained most of the southern shore</a>. The <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> gained another access to the Baltic with the <a href="Kaliningrad%20Oblast">Kaliningrad Oblast</a>. The Baltic states on the eastern shore were annexed by the Soviet Union. The Baltic then separated opposing military blocs: <a href="NATO">NATO</a> and the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a>. Had war broken out, the Polish navy was prepared to invade the Danish isles. This border status restricted trade and travel. It ended only after the collapse of the <a href="Communist">Communist</a> regimes in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s.

Since May 2004, with the accession of the Baltic states and Poland, the Baltic Sea has been almost entirely surrounded by countries of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> (EU). The only remaining non-EU shore areas are Russian: the Saint Petersburg area and the <a href="exclave">exclave</a> of the <a href="Kaliningrad%20Oblast">Kaliningrad Oblast</a>.

Winter storms begin arriving in the region during October. These have caused numerous shipwrecks, and contributed to the extreme difficulties of rescuing passengers of the ferry "<a href="M/S%20Estonia">M/S Estonia</a>" en route from <a href="Tallinn">Tallinn</a>, Estonia, to <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, Sweden, in September 1994, which claimed the lives of 852 people. Older, wood-based shipwrecks such as the "<a href="Vasa%20%28ship%29">Vasa</a>" tend to remain well-preserved, as the Baltic's cold and brackish water does not suit the <a href="shipworm">shipworm</a>.

<a href="Storm%20surge">Storm surge</a> floodings are generally taken to occur when the water level is more than one metre above normal. In Warnemünde about 110 floods occurred from 1950 to 2000, an average of just over two per year.

Historic flood events were the <a href="All%20Saints%27%20Flood%20of%201304">All Saints' Flood of 1304</a> and other floods in the years 1320, 1449, 1625, 1694, 1784 and 1825. Little is known of their extent. From 1872, there exist regular and reliable records of water levels in the Baltic Sea. The highest was the <a href="1872%20Baltic%20Sea%20flood">flood of 1872</a> when the water was an average of above sea level at Warnemünde and a maximum of above sea level in Warnemünde. In the last very heavy floods the average water levels reached above sea level in 1904, in 1913, in January 1954, on 2–4 November 1995 and on 21 February 2002.

An arm of the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Ocean">North Atlantic Ocean</a>, the Baltic Sea is enclosed by <a href="Scandinavia">Sweden and Denmark</a> to the northwest, <a href="Finland">Finland</a> to the northeast, the <a href="Baltic%20states">Baltic countries</a> to the southeast, and the <a href="North%20European%20Plain">North European Plain</a> to the southwest.

It is about long, an average of wide, and an average of deep. The maximum depth is which is on the Swedish side of the center. The surface area is about and the volume is about . The periphery amounts to about of coastline.

The Baltic Sea is one of the largest <a href="brackish%20water">brackish</a> inland seas by area, and occupies a basin (a "<a href="zungenbecken">zungenbecken</a>") formed by glacial erosion during the last few <a href="Ice%20Age">ice ages</a>.

Physical characteristics of the Baltic Sea, its main sub-regions, and the transition zone to the Skagerrak/North Sea area

The <a href="International%20Hydrographic%20Organization">International Hydrographic Organization</a> defines the limits of the Baltic Sea as follows:

The northern part of the Baltic Sea is known as the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Bothnia">Gulf of Bothnia</a>, of which the northernmost part is the Bay of Bothnia or <a href="Bothnian%20Bay">Bothnian Bay</a>. The more rounded southern basin of the gulf is called <a href="Bothnian%20Sea">Bothnian Sea</a> and immediately to the south of it lies the <a href="Sea%20of%20%C3%85land">Sea of Åland</a>. The <a href="Gulf%20of%20Finland">Gulf of Finland</a> connects the Baltic Sea with <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>. The <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a> lies between the <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a>n capital city of <a href="Riga">Riga</a> and the <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a>n island of <a href="Saaremaa">Saaremaa</a>.

The Northern Baltic Sea lies between the <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> area, southwestern Finland and Estonia. The <a href="Gotland%20Basin">Western and Eastern Gotland Basins</a> form the major parts of the Central Baltic Sea or Baltic proper. The <a href="Bornholm">Bornholm</a> Basin is the area east of Bornholm, and the shallower <a href="Cape%20Arkona">Arkona</a> Basin extends from Bornholm to the Danish isles of <a href="Falster">Falster</a> and <a href="Zealand%20%28Denmark%29">Zealand</a>.

In the south, the <a href="Bay%20of%20Gda%C5%84sk">Bay of Gdańsk</a> lies east of the <a href="Hel%20Peninsula">Hel Peninsula</a> on the Polish coast and west of the <a href="Sambia%20Peninsula">Sambia Peninsula</a> in <a href="Kaliningrad%20Oblast">Kaliningrad Oblast</a>. The <a href="Bay%20of%20Pomerania">Bay of Pomerania</a> lies north of the islands of <a href="Usedom">Usedom</a> and <a href="Wolin">Wolin</a>, east of <a href="R%C3%BCgen">Rügen</a>. Between Falster and the German coast lie the <a href="Bay%20of%20Mecklenburg">Bay of Mecklenburg</a> and <a href="Bay%20of%20L%C3%BCbeck">Bay of Lübeck</a>. The westernmost part of the Baltic Sea is the <a href="Bay%20of%20Kiel">Bay of Kiel</a>. The three <a href="Danish%20straits">Danish straits</a>, the <a href="Great%20Belt">Great Belt</a>, the <a href="Little%20Belt">Little Belt</a> and <a href="%C3%96resund">The Sound</a> ("Öresund"/"Øresund"), connect the Baltic Sea with the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a> and <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> strait in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>.

On the long-term average, the Baltic Sea is ice-covered at the annual maximum for about 45% of its surface area. The ice-covered area during such a typical winter includes the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Bothnia">Gulf of Bothnia</a>, the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Finland">Gulf of Finland</a>, the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Riga">Gulf of Riga</a>, the archipelago west of Estonia, the <a href="Stockholm%20archipelago">Stockholm archipelago</a>, and the <a href="Archipelago%20Sea">Archipelago Sea</a> southwest of Finland. The remainder of the Baltic does not freeze during a normal winter, with the exception of sheltered bays and shallow lagoons such as the <a href="Curonian%20Lagoon">Curonian Lagoon</a>. The ice reaches its maximum extent in February or March; typical ice thickness in the northernmost areas in the <a href="Bothnian%20Bay">Bothnian Bay</a>, the northern basin of the Gulf of Bothnia, is about for landfast sea ice. The thickness decreases farther south.

Freezing begins in the northern extremities of Gulf of Bothnia typically in the middle of November, reaching the open waters of the Bothnian Bay in early January. The <a href="Bothnian%20Sea">Bothnian Sea</a>, the basin south of <a href="Kvarken">Kvarken</a>, freezes on average in late February. The Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Riga freeze typically in late January. In 2011, the Gulf of Finland was completely frozen on 15 February.

The ice extent depends on whether the winter is mild, moderate, or severe. Severe winters can lead to ice formation around southern <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> and even in the <a href="Danish%20straits">Danish straits</a>. According to the 18th-century natural historian <a href="William%20Derham">William Derham</a>, during the severe winters of 1703 and 1708, the ice cover reached as far as the Danish straits. Frequently, parts of the Gulf of Bothnia and Gulf of Finland are frozen, in addition to coastal fringes in more southerly locations such as the Gulf of Riga. This description meant that the whole of the Baltic Sea was covered with ice.

It is known that since 1720, the Baltic Sea has frozen over entirely a total of 20 times. The most recent case was in early 1987, which was the most severe winter in Scandinavia since that date. The ice then covered . During the winter of 2010–11, which was quite severe compared to those of the last decades, the maximum ice cover was , which was reached on 25 February 2011. The ice then extended from the north down to the northern tip of <a href="Gotland">Gotland</a>, with small ice-free areas on either side, and the east coast of the Baltic Sea was covered by an ice sheet about wide all the way to <a href="Gda%C5%84sk">Gdańsk</a>. This was brought about by a stagnant <a href="high-pressure%20area">high-pressure area</a> that lingered over central and northern Scandinavia from around 10 to 24 February. After this, strong southern winds pushed the ice further into the north, and much of the waters north of Gotland were again free of ice, which had then packed against the shores of southern Finland. The effects of the afore-mentioned high-pressure area did not reach the southern parts of the Baltic Sea, and thus the entire sea did not freeze over. However, floating ice was additionally observed near <a href="%C5%9Awinouj%C5%9Bcie">Świnoujście</a> harbour in January 2010.

In recent years prior to 2011, the Bothnian Bay and the Bothnian Sea were frozen with solid ice near the Baltic coast and dense floating ice far from it. In 2008, there was almost no ice formation except for a short period in March.
During winter, <a href="fast%20ice">fast ice</a>, which is attached to the shoreline, develops first, rendering ports unusable without the services of <a href="icebreaker">icebreaker</a>s. <a href="Level%20ice">Level ice</a>, <a href="ice%20sludge">ice sludge</a>, <a href="pancake%20ice">pancake ice</a>, and <a href="rafter%20ice">rafter ice</a> form in the more open regions. The gleaming expanse of ice is similar to the <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a>, with wind-driven pack ice and ridges up to . Offshore of the landfast ice, the ice remains very dynamic all year, and it is relatively easily moved around by winds and therefore forms <a href="pack%20ice">pack ice</a>, made up of large piles and ridges pushed against the landfast ice and shores.

In spring, the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia normally thaw in late April, with some ice ridges persisting until May in the eastern extremities of the Gulf of Finland. In the northernmost reaches of the Bothnian Bay, ice usually stays until late May; by early June it is practically always gone. However, in the famine year of <a href="Famine%20of%201866-68">1867</a> remnants of ice were observed as late as July 17 near <a href="Uddsk%C3%A4r">Uddskär</a>. Even as far south as <a href="%C3%98resund">Øresund</a>, remnants of ice have been observed in May; near <a href="Taarbaek">Taarbaek</a> on May 15, 1942 and near Copenhagen on May 11, 1771.

The ice cover is the main habitat for two large mammals, the <a href="grey%20seal">grey seal</a> ("Halichoerus grypus") and the Baltic <a href="ringed%20seal">ringed seal</a> ("Pusa hispida botnica"), both of which feed underneath the ice and breed on its surface. Of these two seals, only the Baltic ringed seal suffers when there is not adequate ice in the Baltic Sea, as it feeds its young only while on ice. The grey seal is adapted to reproducing also with no ice in the sea. The sea ice also harbours several species of algae that live in the bottom and inside unfrozen brine pockets in the ice.

The Baltic Sea flows out through the <a href="Danish%20straits">Danish straits</a>; however, the flow is complex. A surface layer of brackish water discharges per year into the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. Due to the difference in <a href="salinity">salinity</a>, by salinity permeation principle, a sub-surface layer of more saline water moving in the opposite direction brings in per year. It mixes very slowly with the upper waters, resulting in a salinity gradient from top to bottom, with most of the salt water remaining below deep. The general circulation is anti-clockwise: northwards along its eastern boundary, and south along the western one .

The difference between the outflow and the inflow comes entirely from fresh <a href="water">water</a>. More than 250 streams drain a basin of about , contributing a volume of per year to the Baltic. They include the major rivers of north Europe, such as the <a href="Oder">Oder</a>, the <a href="Vistula">Vistula</a>, the <a href="Neman%20River">Neman</a>, the <a href="Daugava%20River">Daugava</a> and the <a href="Neva">Neva</a>. Additional fresh water comes from the difference of <a href="precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> less evaporation, which is positive.

An important source of salty water are infrequent inflows of <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> water into the Baltic. Such inflows, important to the Baltic ecosystem because of the oxygen they transport into the Baltic deeps, used to happen on average every four to five years until the 1980s. In recent decades they have become less frequent. The latest four occurred in 1983, 1993, 2003 and 2014 suggesting a new inter-inflow period of about ten years.

The water level is generally far more dependent on the regional wind situation than on tidal effects. However, tidal currents occur in narrow passages in the western parts of the Baltic Sea.

The <a href="significant%20wave%20height">significant wave height</a> is generally much lower than that of the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. Violent and sudden storms often sweep the surface, due to large transient temperature differences and a long reach of wind. Seasonal winds also cause small changes in sea level, of the order of .

The Baltic Sea's <a href="salinity">salinity</a> is much lower than that of ocean water (which averages 3.5%), as a result of abundant freshwater runoff from the surrounding land, combined with the shallowness of the sea itself; runoff contributes roughly one-fortieth its total volume per year, as the volume of the basin is about and yearly runoff is about . The open surface waters of the central basin have salinity of 0.5% to 0.8%, which makes the basin border-line <a href="freshwater">freshwater</a>. Drinking the water as a means of survival would actually hydrate the body instead of <a href="dehydration">dehydrating</a>, as is the case with ocean water. At the semi-enclosed bays with major freshwater inflows, such as the head of Finnish Gulf with the Neva mouth and the head of the Bothnian Gulf with the close mouths of the Lule, Tornio and Kemi, the salinity is considerably lower. Below , the salinity is between 1.0% and 1.5% in the open Baltic Sea, and higher near the Danish Straits, but this is still less than half that of ocean water.

The flow of fresh water into the sea from approximately two hundred rivers and the introduction of salt from the South builds up a gradient of salinity in the Baltic Sea. Near the <a href="Danish%20straits">Danish straits</a> the salinity is close to that of the Kattegat, but still not fully oceanic, because the saltiest water that passes the straits is already mixed with considerable amounts of outflow water. The salinity steadily decreases towards North and East. At the northern part of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Bothnia">Gulf of Bothnia</a> the water is no longer salty and many fresh water species live in the sea. The salinity gradient is paralleled by a temperature gradient. These two factors limit many species of animals and plants to a relatively narrow region of the Baltic Sea.

The most saline water is vertically stratified in the water column to the <a href="North%20Sea">north</a>, creating a barrier to the exchange of <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> and nutrients, and fostering completely separate maritime environments.

The rating of <a href="Discharge%20%28hydrology%29">mean discharges</a> differs from the ranking of hydrological lengths (from the most distant source to the sea) and the rating of the nominal lengths. <a href="G%C3%B6ta%20%C3%A4lv">Göta älv</a>, a tributary of the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a>, is not listed, as due to the northward upper low-salinity-flow in the sea, its water hardly reaches the Baltic proper:


Countries that border on the sea:

Countries that are in the <a href="drainage%20basin">drainage basin</a> but do not border on the sea:

The Baltic sea drainage basin is roughly four times the surface area of the sea itself. About 48% of the region is forested, with Sweden and Finland containing the majority of the forest, especially around the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland.

About 20% of the land is used for agriculture and pasture, mainly in Poland and around the edge of the Baltic Proper, in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. About 17% of the basin is unused open land with another 8% of wetlands. Most of the latter are in the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland.

The rest of the land is heavily populated. About 85 million people live in the Baltic drainage basin, 15 million within of the coast and 29 million within of the coast. Around 22 million live in population centers of over 250,000. 90% of these are concentrated in the band around the coast. Of the nations containing all or part of the basin, Poland includes 45% of the 85 million, Russia 12%, Sweden 10% and the others less than 6% each.

The Baltic Sea somewhat resembles a <a href="river">river</a>bed, with two tributaries, the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Finland">Gulf of Finland</a> and <a href="Gulf%20of%20Bothnia">Gulf of Bothnia</a>. <a href="Geology">Geological</a> surveys show that before the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, instead of the Baltic Sea, there was a wide plain around a great river paleontologists call the <a href="Eridanos%20%28geology%29">Eridanos</a>. Several Pleistocene <a href="glaciation">glacial</a> episodes scooped out the river bed into the sea basin. By the time of the last, or <a href="Eemian%20Stage">Eemian Stage</a> (<a href="Marine%20isotopic%20stage">MIS</a> 5e), the Eemian Sea was in place. Instead of a true sea, the Baltic can even today also be understood as the common <a href="estuary">estuary</a> of all rivers flowing into it.

From that time the waters underwent a geologic history summarized under the names listed below. Many of the stages are named after marine animals (e.g. the <a href="Littorina">Littorina</a> <a href="mollusk">mollusk</a>) that are clear markers of changing water temperatures and salinity.

The factors that determined the sea's characteristics were the submergence or emergence of the region due to the weight of ice and subsequent isostatic readjustment, and the connecting channels it found to the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>-<a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a>, either through the straits of <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> or at what are now the large lakes of <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, and the <a href="White%20Sea">White Sea</a>-<a href="Arctic%20Sea">Arctic Sea</a>.

The land is still emerging <a href="isostasy">isostatically</a> from its depressed state, which was caused by the weight of ice during the last glaciation. The phenomenon is known as <a href="post-glacial%20rebound">post-glacial rebound</a>. Consequently, the surface area and the depth of the sea are diminishing. The uplift is about eight millimetres per year on the Finnish coast of the northernmost Gulf of Bothnia. In the area, the former seabed is only gently sloping, leading to large areas of land being reclaimed in what are, geologically speaking, relatively short periods (decades and centuries).

The <a href="Baltic%20Sea%20anomaly">Baltic Sea anomaly</a> is a 60-metre (200 ft) diameter circular rock-like formation on the floor of the northern Baltic Sea at the center of the <a href="Bothnian%20Sea">Bothnian Sea</a>, discovered by Peter Lindberg, Dennis Åsberg and their Swedish "Ocean X" diving team in June 2011. The team reported that the formation rests on a pillar and includes a structure similar in appearance to a staircase, leading to a dark hole.

According to Ocean X, the formation has an appearance of "rough granite", is round, thick and approximately in diameter, stands on an pillar-like feature, and is located at a depth of . There is also another smaller object not far away. The object is at the end of what resembles a "runway".

The Ocean X team has published one additional close-up sonar scan on their Web site and nine additional close-up sonar scans on their YouTube page that appear to show a 90-degree angle and other features of the object.

On their second expedition, they reported that they found something that looks like a staircase and a round black hole that goes directly into the structure.

The fauna of the Baltic sea is a mixture of marine and freshwater species. Among marine fishes are <a href="cod">cod</a>, herring, <a href="hake">hake</a>, <a href="plaice">plaice</a>, <a href="flounder">flounder</a>, <a href="shorthorn%20sculpin">shorthorn sculpin</a>, <a href="stickleback">stickleback</a> and <a href="turbot">turbot</a>, and examples of freshwater species include <a href="perch">perch</a>, <a href="Northern%20pike">pike</a>, <a href="Freshwater%20whitefish">whitefish</a> and <a href="Common%20Roach">roach</a>.

There is a decrease in faunal species from the Belts to the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Bothnia">Gulf of Bothnia</a>. The decreasing salinity along this path causes restrictions in both physiology and habitats. The lack of <a href="tide">tide</a>s has affected the marine species as compared with the Atlantic.

Since the Baltic Sea is so young there are only a few <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> species. The mostly asexually reproducing brown alga "<a href="Fucus%20radicans">Fucus radicans</a>" seems to have evolved in the basin. Another endemic is the Copenhagen cockle "". However, several marine species have populations in the Baltic Sea adapted to the low salinity, such as the Baltic Sea <a href="herring">herring</a> which is smaller than the <a href="Atlantic%20herring">Atlantic herring</a>.

A peculiar feature of the fauna is that it contains a number of glacial <a href="relict%20species">relict species</a>, isolated populations of arctic species which have remained in the Baltic Sea since the last <a href="glaciation">glaciation</a>, such as the large isopod "<a href="Saduria%20entomon">Saduria entomon</a>", the Baltic subspecies of <a href="ringed%20seal">ringed seal</a>, and the <a href="fourhorn%20sculpin">fourhorn sculpin</a>. Some of these relicts are derived from <a href="glacial%20lake">glacial lake</a>s, such as "<a href="Monoporeia%20affinis">Monoporeia affinis</a>", which is a main element in the <a href="benthos">benthic fauna</a> of the low-salinity <a href="Bothnian%20Bay">Bothnian Bay</a>.

<a href="Cetacean">Cetacean</a>s in Baltic Sea have been monitored by the <a href="ASCOBANS">ASCOBANS</a>. Critically endangered populations of <a href="Atlantic%20white-sided%20dolphin">Atlantic white-sided dolphin</a>s and <a href="harbor%20porpoise">harbor porpoise</a>s inhabit the sea where white-colored porpoises have been recorded, and occasionally oceanic and out-of-range species such as <a href="minke%20whale">minke whale</a>s, <a href="bottlenose%20dolphin">bottlenose dolphin</a>s, <a href="beluga%20whale">beluga whale</a>s, <a href="orca">orca</a>s, and <a href="beaked%20whale">beaked whale</a>s visit the waters. In recent years, very small, but with increasing rates, <a href="fin%20whale">fin whale</a>s and <a href="humpback%20whale">humpback whale</a>s migrate into Baltic sea including mother and calf pair. Now extinct Atlantic <a href="grey%20whale">grey whale</a>s (remains found from <a href="Gr%C3%A4s%C3%B6">Gräsö</a> along <a href="Bothnian%20Sea">Bothnian Sea</a>/southern <a href="Bothnian%20Gulf">Bothnian Gulf</a> and <a href="Ystad">Ystad</a>) and eastern population of <a href="North%20Atlantic%20right%20whale">North Atlantic right whale</a>s that is facing <a href="functional%20extinction">functional extinction</a> once migrated into Baltic Sea.

Strandings of <a href="Leatherback%20turtle">Leatherback turtle</a>s have been recorded in Baltic Sea, too. Other notable <a href="megafauna">megafauna</a> include the <a href="basking%20shark">basking shark</a>s.

Satellite images taken in July 2010 revealed a massive <a href="algal%20bloom">algal bloom</a> covering in the Baltic Sea. The area of the bloom extended from Germany and Poland to Finland. Researchers of the phenomenon have indicated that algal blooms have occurred every summer for decades. Fertilizer runoff from surrounding agricultural land has exacerbated the problem and led to increased <a href="eutrophication">eutrophication</a>.

Approximately of the Baltic's seafloor (a quarter of its total area) is a variable <a href="Dead%20zone%20%28ecology%29">dead zone</a>. The more saline (and therefore denser) water remains on the bottom, isolating it from surface waters and the atmosphere. This leads to decreased oxygen concentrations within the zone. It is mainly bacteria that grow in it, digesting organic material and releasing hydrogen sulfide. Because of this large anaerobic zone, the seafloor ecology differs from that of the neighbouring Atlantic.

Plans to artificially oxygenate areas of the Baltic that have experienced eutrophication have been proposed by the <a href="University%20of%20Gothenburg">University of Gothenburg</a> and Inocean AB. The proposal intends to use wind-driven pumps to inject oxygen (air) into waters at, or around, 130m below sea level.

Construction of the <a href="Great%20Belt%20Bridge">Great Belt Bridge</a> in Denmark (completed 1997) and the <a href="%C3%98resund%20Bridge">Øresund Bridge</a>-Tunnel (completed 1999), linking Denmark with Sweden, provided a highway and railroad connection between Sweden and the Danish mainland (the <a href="Jutland%20Peninsula">Jutland Peninsula</a>, precisely the <a href="Zealand">Zealand</a>). The undersea tunnel of the Øresund Bridge-Tunnel provides for navigation of large ships into and out of the Baltic Sea. The Baltic Sea is the main trade route for export of Russian petroleum. Many of the countries neighboring the Baltic Sea have been concerned about this, since a major oil leak in a seagoing tanker would be disastrous for the Baltic—given the slow exchange of water. The tourism industry surrounding the Baltic Sea is naturally concerned about <a href="oil%20pollution">oil pollution</a>.

Much shipbuilding is carried out in the shipyards around the Baltic Sea. The largest shipyards are at <a href="Gda%C5%84sk">Gdańsk</a>, <a href="Gdynia">Gdynia</a>, and <a href="Szczecin">Szczecin</a>, Poland; <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>, Germany; <a href="Karlskrona">Karlskrona</a> and <a href="Malm%C3%B6">Malmö</a>, Sweden; <a href="Rauma%2C%20Finland">Rauma</a>, <a href="Turku">Turku</a>, and <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, Finland; <a href="Riga">Riga</a>, <a href="Ventspils">Ventspils</a>, and <a href="Liep%C4%81ja">Liepāja</a>, Latvia; <a href="Klaip%C4%97da">Klaipėda</a>, Lithuania; and <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, Russia.

There are several cargo and passenger ferries that operate on the Baltic Sea, such as <a href="Scandlines">Scandlines</a>, <a href="Silja%20Line">Silja Line</a>, <a href="Polferries">Polferries</a>, the <a href="Viking%20Line">Viking Line</a>, <a href="Tallink">Tallink</a>, and <a href="Superfast%20Ferries">Superfast Ferries</a>.

For the first time ever, all the sources of pollution around an entire sea were made subject to a single convention, signed in 1974 by the then seven Baltic coastal states. The 1974 Convention entered into force on 3 May 1980.

In the light of political changes and developments in international environmental and maritime law, a new convention was signed in 1992 by all the states bordering on the Baltic Sea, and the European Community. After ratification the <a href="Convention%20on%20the%20Protection%20of%20the%20Marine%20Environment%20of%20the%20Baltic%20Sea%20Area">Convention</a> entered into force on 17 January 2000. The Convention covers the whole of the Baltic Sea area, including inland waters and the water of the sea itself, as well as the seabed. Measures are also taken in the whole catchment area of the Baltic Sea to reduce land-based pollution. The Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area, 1992, entered into force on 17 January 2000.

The governing body of the Convention is the <a href="HELCOM">Helsinki Commission</a>, also known as HELCOM, or Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission. The present contracting parties are Denmark, Estonia, the European Community, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Sweden.

The ratification instruments were deposited by the European Community, Germany, Latvia and Sweden in 1994, by Estonia and Finland in 1995, by Denmark in 1996, by Lithuania in 1997 and by Poland and Russia in November 1999.

Brackish water

Brackish water or briny water is water that has more <a href="salinity">salinity</a> than <a href="fresh%20water">fresh water</a>, but not as much as <a href="seawater">seawater</a>. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in <a href="estuary">estuaries</a>, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. The word comes from the Middle Dutch root "<a href="%3Awikt%3Abrak%23Dutch">brak</a>". Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming. Brackish water is also the primary waste product of the <a href="Osmotic%20power">salinity gradient power</a> process. Because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment (see article on <a href="shrimp%20farms">shrimp farms</a>).

Technically, brackish water contains between 0.5 and 30 grams of <a href="salt">salt</a> per litre—more often expressed as 0.5 to 30 <a href="parts%20per%20thousand">parts per thousand</a> (‰), which is a <a href="specific%20gravity">specific gravity</a> of between 1.005 and 1.010. Thus, "brackish" covers a range of <a href="Salinity%23Systems%20of%20classification%20of%20water%20bodies%20based%20upon%20salinity">salinity regimes</a> and is not considered a precisely defined condition. It is characteristic of many brackish surface waters that their salinity can vary considerably over space or time.

Brackish water condition commonly occurs when fresh water meets seawater. In fact, the most extensive brackish water habitats worldwide are <a href="estuary">estuaries</a>, where a river meets the sea.

The <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> flowing through <a href="London">London</a> is a classic river estuary. The town of <a href="Teddington">Teddington</a> a few miles west of London marks the boundary between the tidal and non-tidal parts of the Thames, although it is still considered a freshwater river about as far east as <a href="Battersea">Battersea</a> insofar as the average salinity is very low and the fish fauna consists predominantly of freshwater species such as <a href="Rutilus">roach</a>, <a href="Common%20dace">dace</a>, <a href="carp">carp</a>, <a href="perch">perch</a>, and <a href="pike%20%28fish%29">pike</a>. The <a href="Thames%20Estuary">Thames Estuary</a> becomes brackish between Battersea and <a href="Gravesend%2C%20Kent">Gravesend</a>, and the diversity of freshwater fish species present is smaller, primarily roach and dace; <a href="euryhaline">euryhaline</a> marine species such as <a href="flounder">flounder</a>, <a href="European%20seabass">European seabass</a>, <a href="mullet%20%28fish%29">mullet</a>, and <a href="Smelt%20%28fish%29">smelt</a> become much more common. Further east, the salinity increases and the freshwater fish species are completely replaced by euryhaline marine ones, until the river reaches Gravesend, at which point conditions become fully marine and the fish fauna resembles that of the adjacent <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> and includes both euryhaline and <a href="stenohaline">stenohaline</a> marine species. A similar pattern of replacement can be observed with the aquatic plants and invertebrates living in the river.

This type of <a href="ecological%20succession">ecological succession</a> from a freshwater to marine <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a> is typical of river estuaries. River estuaries form important staging points during the migration of <a href="Fish%20migration">anadromous and catadromous</a> fish species, such as <a href="salmon">salmon</a>, <a href="American%20shad">shad</a>, and <a href="eel">eel</a>s, giving them time to form social groups and to adjust to the changes in salinity. Salmon are anadromous, meaning they live in the sea but ascend rivers to spawn; eels are catadromous, living in rivers and streams, but returning to the sea to breed. Besides the species that migrate through estuaries, there are many other fish that use them as "nursery grounds" for spawning or as places young fish can feed and grow before moving elsewhere. <a href="Herring">Herring</a> and <a href="plaice">plaice</a> are two commercially important species that use the Thames Estuary for this purpose.

Estuaries are also commonly used as fishing grounds, and as places for fish farming or ranching. For example, <a href="Atlantic%20salmon">Atlantic salmon</a> farms are often located in estuaries, although this has caused controversy, because in doing so, fish farmers expose migrating wild fish to large numbers of external <a href="parasitism">parasites</a> such as <a href="sea%20lice">sea lice</a> that escape from the pens the farmed fish are kept in.

Another important brackish water habitat is the <a href="mangrove%20swamp">mangrove swamp</a> or mangal. Many, though not all, mangrove swamps fringe estuaries and lagoons where the salinity changes with each tide. Among the most specialised residents of mangrove forests are <a href="mudskippers">mudskippers</a>, fish that forage for food on land, and <a href="archer%20fish">archer fish</a>, perch-like fish that "spit" at insects and other small animals living in the trees, knocking them into the water where they can be eaten. Like estuaries, mangrove swamps are extremely important breeding grounds for many fish, with species such as <a href="Lutjanidae">snappers</a>, <a href="halfbeak">halfbeak</a>s, and <a href="tarpon">tarpon</a> spawning or maturing among them. Besides fish, numerous other animals use mangroves, including such species as the <a href="saltwater%20crocodile">saltwater crocodile</a>, <a href="American%20crocodile">American crocodile</a>, <a href="proboscis%20monkey">proboscis monkey</a>, <a href="diamondback%20terrapin">diamondback terrapin</a>, and the <a href="Crab-eating%20Frog">crab-eating frog</a>, "Fejervarya cancrivora" (formerly "Rana cancrivora"). Mangroves represent important nesting site for numerous birds groups such as herons, storks, spoonbills, ibises, kingfishers, shorebirds and seabirds.

Although often plagued with <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a>es and other insects that make them unpleasant for humans, mangrove swamps are very important buffer zones between land and sea, and are a natural defense against hurricane and tsunami damage in particular.

The <a href="Sundarbans">Sundarbans</a> and <a href="Bhitarkanika%20Mangroves">Bhitarkanika Mangroves</a> are two of the large mangrove forests in the world, both on the coast of the <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a>.

Some seas and lakes are brackish. The <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> is a brackish sea adjoining the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. Originally the <a href="confluence">confluence</a> of two major river systems prior to the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, since then it has been flooded by the North Sea but still receives so much freshwater from the adjacent lands that the water is brackish. Because the salt water coming in from the sea is denser than freshwater, the water in the Baltic is stratified, with salt water at the bottom and freshwater at the top. Limited mixing occurs because of the lack of tides and storms, with the result that the fish fauna at the surface is freshwater in composition while that lower down is more marine. <a href="Cod">Cod</a> are an example of a species only found in deep water in the Baltic, while <a href="Northern%20pike">pike</a> are confined to the less <a href="saline%20water">saline</a> surface waters.

The <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> is the world's largest lake and contains brackish water with a salinity about one-third that of normal <a href="seawater">seawater</a>. The Caspian is famous for its peculiar animal fauna, including one of the few non-marine seals (the <a href="Caspian%20seal">Caspian seal</a>) and the great <a href="sturgeon">sturgeon</a>s, a major source of <a href="caviar">caviar</a>.

In the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> the surface water is brackish with an average salinity of about 17-18 parts per thousand compared to 30 to 40 for the oceans. The deep, <a href="anoxic%20event">anoxic</a> water of the Black Sea originates from warm, salty water of the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a>.

A <a href="brackish%20marsh">brackish marsh</a> may occur where a freshwater flow enters a salt marsh.

The Bronx

The Bronx () is the northernmost of the five <a href="boroughs%20of%20New%20York%20City">boroughs of New York City</a>, within the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. It is geographically south of <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County</a>; north and east of the island and borough of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> to the south and west across the <a href="Harlem%20River">Harlem River</a>; and north of the borough of <a href="Queens">Queens</a>, across the <a href="East%20River">East River</a>. Of the five boroughs, the Bronx is the only one that has the majority of its area on the <a href="Contiguous%20United%20States">U.S. mainland</a> and, with a land area of and a population of 1,455,720 in 2016, has the fourth-largest land area, the fourth-highest population, and the third-highest <a href="population%20density">population density</a>. Since 1914, the Bronx has had the same boundaries as Bronx County, a <a href="County%20%28United%20States%29">county</a> of New York and the third most densely populated county in the United States.

The Bronx is divided by the <a href="Bronx%20River">Bronx River</a> into a hillier section in the <a href="West%20Bronx">west</a>, closer to Manhattan, and a flatter <a href="East%20Bronx">eastern</a> section, closer to <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>. East and west street addresses are divided by <a href="Jerome%20Avenue">Jerome Avenue</a>—the continuation of Manhattan's <a href="Fifth%20Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a>. The West Bronx was annexed to New York City in 1874, and the areas east of the Bronx River in 1895. Bronx County was separated from New York County in 1914. About a quarter of the Bronx's area is open space, including <a href="Woodlawn%20Cemetery%20%28Bronx%2C%20New%20York%29">Woodlawn Cemetery</a>, <a href="Van%20Cortlandt%20Park">Van Cortlandt Park</a>, <a href="Pelham%20Bay%20Park">Pelham Bay Park</a>, the <a href="New%20York%20Botanical%20Garden">New York Botanical Garden</a>, and the <a href="Bronx%20Zoo">Bronx Zoo</a> in the borough's north and center. These open spaces are situated primarily on land deliberately reserved in the late 19th century as urban development progressed north and east from Manhattan.

The name "Bronx" originated with <a href="Jonas%20Bronck">Jonas Bronck</a>, who established the first settlement in the area as part of the <a href="New%20Netherland">New Netherland</a> colony in 1639. The native <a href="Lenape">Lenape</a> were displaced after 1643 by settlers. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Bronx received many immigrant groups as it was transformed into an urban community, first from various European countries (particularly <a href="Irish%20American">Ireland</a>, <a href="German%20Americans">Germany</a>, and <a href="Italian%20American">Italy</a>) and later from the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> region (particularly <a href="Puerto%20Ricans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Puerto Rico</a>, <a href="Jamaican%20American">Jamaica</a>, and the <a href="Dominican%20American">Dominican Republic</a>), as well as <a href="African%20American">African American</a> migrants from the <a href="southern%20United%20States">southern United States</a>. This cultural mix has made the Bronx a wellspring of both <a href="Latin%20music%20%28genre%29">Latin music</a> and <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a>.

The Bronx contains one of the five poorest <a href="Congressional%20districts%20of%20the%20United%20States">Congressional Districts in the United States</a>, the <a href="New%20York%27s%2015th%20congressional%20district">15th</a>, but its wide diversity also includes affluent, upper-income and middle-income neighborhoods such as <a href="Riverdale%2C%20Bronx">Riverdale</a>, <a href="Fieldston%2C%20Bronx">Fieldston</a>, <a href="Spuyten%20Duyvil%2C%20Bronx">Spuyten Duyvil</a>, <a href="Schuylerville%2C%20Bronx">Schuylerville</a>, <a href="Pelham%20Bay%2C%20Bronx">Pelham Bay</a>, <a href="Pelham%20Gardens%2C%20Bronx">Pelham Gardens</a>, <a href="Morris%20Park%2C%20Bronx">Morris Park</a>, and <a href="Country%20Club%2C%20Bronx">Country Club</a>. The Bronx, particularly the <a href="South%20Bronx">South Bronx</a>, saw a sharp decline in population, livable housing, and the quality of life in the late 1960s and the 1970s, culminating in a wave of <a href="arson">arson</a>. Since then the communities have shown significant redevelopment starting in the late 1980s before picking up pace from the 1990s until today. 

The Bronx was called "Rananchqua" by the native <a href="Siwanoy">Siwanoy</a> band of <a href="Lenape">Lenape</a> (also known historically as "the Delawares"), while other <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> knew the Bronx as "Keskeskeck". It was divided by the <a href="Aquahung">Aquahung</a> River.

The origin of <a href="Jonas%20Bronck">Jonas Bronck</a> () is contested. Some sources claim he was a Swedish born emigrant from <a href="Komstad">Komstad, Norra Ljunga parish</a> in <a href="Sm%C3%A5land">Småland</a>, Sweden, who arrived in <a href="New%20Netherland">New Netherland</a> during the spring of 1639. Bronck became the first recorded European settler in the area now known as the Bronx and built a farm named "Emmanus" close to what today is the corner of Willis Avenue and 132nd Street in <a href="Mott%20Haven%2C%20Bronx">Mott Haven</a>. He leased land from the <a href="Dutch%20West%20India%20Company">Dutch West India Company</a> on the neck of the mainland immediately north of the Dutch settlement in <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a> (on <a href="Manhattan%20Island">Manhattan Island</a>), and bought additional tracts from the local tribes. He eventually accumulated between the <a href="Harlem%20River">Harlem River</a> and the Aquahung, which became known as "Bronck's River" or "the <a href="Bronx%20River">Bronx</a> [River]". Dutch and English settlers referred to the area as "Bronck's Land". The American poet <a href="William%20Bronk">William Bronk</a> was a descendant of Pieter Bronck, either Jonas Bronck's son or his younger brother. More recent research indicates that Pieter was probably Jonas' nephew or cousin, but certainly of the same family.

The Bronx is referred to with the <a href="Article%20%28grammar%29">definite article</a> as "The Bronx," both legally and colloquially. The County of Bronx does not place "The" immediately before "Bronx" in formal references, unlike the coextensive Borough of the Bronx, nor does the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> in its database of Bronx addresses. The region was apparently named after the <a href="Bronx%20River">Bronx River</a> and first appeared in the "Annexed District of The Bronx" created in 1874 out of part of <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County</a>. It was continued in the "Borough of The Bronx", which included a larger annexation from Westchester County in 1898. The use of the definite article is attributed to the style of referring to rivers. Another explanation for the use of the definite article in the borough's name is that the original form of the name was a possessive or collective one referring to the family, as in visiting "the Broncks", "the Bronck's," or "the Broncks".

“We have always been very proud of the fact that you do not go to Bronx but to The Bronx, meaning to visit that family or what remains of it,” said Audrey Bronk, whose husband Charles is a 10th-generation descendant of Pieter.

The capitalization of The Bronx's name is sometimes disputed. Generally, the definite article is lowercase in place names ("the Bronx") except in official references to the borough. It would be capitalized ("The Bronx") at the beginning of a sentence or in any other situation when a normally lowercase word would be capitalized. However, some people and groups refer to the borough with a capital letter at all times, such as <a href="Lloyd%20Ultan%20%28historian%29">Lloyd Ultan</a>, a <a href="The%20Bronx%20County%20Historical%20Society">Bronx County Historical Society</a> historian, and the Great and Glorious Grand Army of The Bronx, a Bronx-based organization. These people say that the definite article is part of the proper name. In particular, the Great and Glorious Grand Army of The Bronx is leading efforts to make the city refer to the borough with an uppercase definite article in all uses, comparing the lowercase article in The Bronx's name to "not capitalizing the 's' in 'Staten Island.'"

European colonization of the Bronx began in 1639. The Bronx was originally part of <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County</a>, but it was ceded to <a href="Manhattan">New York County</a> in two major parts (<a href="West%20Bronx">West Bronx</a>, 1874 and <a href="East%20Bronx">East Bronx</a>, 1895) before it became Bronx County. Originally, the area was part of the <a href="Lenape">Lenape</a>'s <a href="Lenapehoking">Lenapehoking</a> territory inhabited by <a href="Siwanoy">Siwanoy</a> of the <a href="Wappinger">Wappinger</a> Confederacy. Over time, European colonists converted the borough into farmlands.

The development of the Bronx is directly connected to its strategic location between <a href="New%20England">New England</a> and New York (<a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>). Control over the bridges across the Harlem River plagued the period of British colonial rule. The King's Bridge, built in 1693 where <a href="Broadway%20%28Manhattan%29">Broadway</a> reached the <a href="Spuyten%20Duyvil%20Creek">Spuyten Duyvil Creek</a>, was a possession of <a href="Frederick%20Philipse">Frederick Philipse</a>, lord of <a href="Philipse%20Manor%20Hall%20State%20Historic%20Site">Philipse Manor</a>. The tolls were resented by local farmers on both sides of the creek, and in 1759, Jacobus Dyckman and <a href="Benjamin%20Palmer">Benjamin Palmer</a> led them in building a free bridge across the Harlem River. After the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, the King's Bridge toll was abolished.

The territory now contained within Bronx County was originally part of <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County</a>, one of the 12 original counties of the English <a href="Province%20of%20New%20York">Province of New York</a>. The present Bronx County was contained in the town of Westchester and parts of the towns of Yonkers, Eastchester, and Pelham. In 1846, a new town was created by division of Westchester, called West Farms. The town of <a href="Morrisania%2C%20Bronx">Morrisania</a> was created, in turn, from West Farms in 1855. In 1873, the town of <a href="Kingsbridge%2C%20Bronx">Kingsbridge</a> was established within the former borders of <a href="Yonkers%2C%20New%20York">Yonkers</a>, roughly corresponding to the modern Bronx neighborhoods of Kingsbridge, <a href="Riverdale%2C%20Bronx">Riverdale</a>, and <a href="Woodlawn%2C%20Bronx">Woodlawn</a>.

Among famous settlers in the Bronx in the 19th and early 20th centuries were author <a href="Willa%20Cather">Willa Cather</a>, tobacco merchant <a href="Pierre%20Lorillard%20IV">Pierre Lorillard</a>, and inventor <a href="Jordan%20L.%20Mott">Jordan L. Mott</a>, who established <a href="Mott%20Haven">Mott Haven</a> to house the workers at his iron works.

The consolidation of the Bronx into New York City proceeded in two stages. In 1873, the state legislature annexed Kingsbridge, West Farms, and Morrisania to New York, effective in 1874; the three towns were abolished in the process.

The whole territory east of the Bronx River was annexed to the city in 1895, three years before New York's consolidation with <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, <a href="Queens">Queens</a>, and <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a>. This included the Town of Westchester (which had voted against consolidation in 1894) and portions of <a href="Eastchester%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Eastchester</a> and <a href="Pelham%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Pelham</a>. The nautical community of <a href="City%20Island%2C%20Bronx">City Island</a> voted to join the city in 1896.

On January 1, 1898, the consolidated <a href="City%20of%20Greater%20New%20York">City of New York</a> was born, including the Bronx as one of the five distinct <a href="Borough%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Boroughs</a>. (At the same time, the Bronx's territory moved from Westchester County into <a href="New%20York%20County">New York County</a>, which already contained Manhattan and the rest of pre-1874 New York City.)

On April 19, 1912, those parts of New York County which had been annexed from Westchester County in the past decades were newly constituted as Bronx County, the 62nd and last county to be created by the state, effective in 1914. Bronx County's courts opened for business on January 2, 1914 (the same day that <a href="John%20P.%20Mitchel">John P. Mitchel</a> started work as <a href="Mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City">Mayor of New York City</a>). <a href="Marble%20Hill%2C%20Manhattan">Marble Hill, Manhattan</a> was now connected to the Bronx, but it did not become part of that county by a historical accident due to changes in waterways.

The history of the Bronx during the 20th century may be divided into four periods: a boom period during 1900–29, with a population growth by a factor of six from 200,000 in 1900 to 1.3 million in 1930. The <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> and post World War II years saw a slowing of growth leading into an eventual decline. The mid to late century were hard times, as the Bronx declined 1950–85 from a predominantly moderate-income to a predominantly lower-income area with high rates of violent crime and poverty. The Bronx has experienced an economic and developmental resurgence starting in the late 1980s that continues into today.

The Bronx was a mostly rural area for generations, small farms supplying the city markets, but it grew into a railroad suburb in the late 19th century. Faster transportation enabled rapid population growth in the late 19th century, involving the move from horse-drawn street cars to elevated railways and the subway system, which linked to Manhattan in 1904.

The South Bronx was a manufacturing center for many years and was noted as a center of <a href="piano">piano</a> manufacturing in the early part of the 20th century. In 1919, the Bronx was the site of 63 piano factories employing more than 5,000 workers.

At the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the Bronx hosted the rather small <a href="Bronx%20International%20Exposition%20of%20Science%2C%20Arts%20and%20Industries">1918 World's Fair</a> at 177th Street and DeVoe Avenue.

The Bronx underwent rapid urban growth after World War I. Extensions of the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Subway">New York City Subway</a> contributed to the increase in population as thousands of immigrants came to the Bronx, resulting in a major boom in residential construction. Among these groups, many <a href="Irish%20Americans">Irish Americans</a>, <a href="Italian%20Americans">Italian Americans</a>, and especially <a href="Jewish%20Americans">Jewish Americans</a> settled here. In addition, <a href="French%20American">French</a>, <a href="German%20Americans">German</a>, <a href="Polish%20American">Polish</a>, and other immigrants moved into the borough. The <a href="Judaism">Jewish</a> population also increased notably during this time. In 1937, 592,185 Jews lived in The Bronx (43.9% of the borough's population), while only 54,000 Jews lived in the borough in 2011. Many <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>s still stand in the Bronx, but most have been converted to other uses.

<a href="rum-running">Bootleggers</a> and gangs were active in the Bronx during <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a> (1920–33). Irish, Italian, Jewish, and Polish gangs smuggled in most of the illegal whiskey, and the oldest sections of the borough became poverty-stricken.

Between 1930 and 1960, moderate and upper income Bronxites (predominantly non-Hispanic Whites) began to relocate from the southwestern neighborhoods of the borough. This migration has left a mostly poor African American and Hispanic (largely <a href="Puerto%20Ricans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Puerto Rican</a>) population in the West Bronx. One significant factor that shifted the racial and economic demographics was the construction of Co-op City, built with the intent of housing middle-class residents in family-sized apartments. The high-rise complex played a significant role in draining middle-class residents from older tenement buildings in the borough's southern and western fringes. Most predominantly non-Hispanic White communities today <a href="Demographics%20of%20the%20Bronx">are located in the eastern and northwestern sections of the borough</a>.

From the early 1960s to the early 1980s, the <a href="quality%20of%20life">quality of life</a> declined sharply for many Bronx residents. Historians and social scientists have suggested many factors, including the theory that <a href="Robert%20Moses">Robert Moses</a>' <a href="Cross%20Bronx%20Expressway">Cross Bronx Expressway</a> destroyed existing residential neighborhoods and created instant slums, as put forward in <a href="Robert%20Caro">Robert Caro</a>'s biography "<a href="The%20Power%20Broker">The Power Broker</a>". Another factor in the Bronx's decline may have been the development of <a href="high-rise">high-rise</a> <a href="Public%20housing%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Canada">housing projects</a>, particularly in the <a href="South%20Bronx">South Bronx</a>. Yet another factor may have been a reduction in the real estate listings and property-related financial services offered in some areas of the Bronx, such as <a href="mortgage%20loan">mortgage loan</a>s or insurance policies—a process known as <a href="redlining">redlining</a>. Others have suggested a "<a href="planned%20shrinkage">planned shrinkage</a>" of municipal services, such as fire-fighting. There was also much debate as to whether <a href="rent%20control">rent control</a> laws had made it less profitable (or more costly) for landlords to maintain existing buildings with their existing tenants than to abandon or destroy those buildings.

In the 1970s, the Bronx was plagued by a wave of arson. The burning of buildings was predominantly in the poorest communities, such as the South Bronx. One explanation of what occurred was that landlords decided to burn their low property-value buildings and take the insurance money, as it was more lucrative to get insurance money than to refurbish or sell a building in a severely distressed area. The Bronx became identified with a high rate of poverty and unemployment, which was mainly a persistent problem in the South Bronx.

Out of 289 census tracts in the Bronx borough, 7 tracts lost more than 97% of their buildings to fire and abandonment between 1970 and 1980; another 44 tracts had more than 50% of their buildings meet the same fate. By the early 1980s, the South Bronx was considered one of the most blighted urban areas in the country, with a loss of 60% of the population and 40% of housing units. However, starting in the 1990s, many burned-out and run-down tenements were replaced by multi-unit housing.

Since the late 1980s, significant development has occurred in the Bronx, first stimulated by the city's "Ten-Year Housing Plan" and community members working to rebuild the social, economic and environmental infrastructure by creating <a href="affordable%20housing">affordable housing</a>. Groups affiliated with churches in the South Bronx erected the Nehemiah Homes with about 1,000 units. The grass roots organization Nos Quedamos' endeavor known as Melrose Commons began to rebuild areas in the South Bronx. The <a href="IRT%20White%20Plains%20Road%20Line">IRT White Plains Road Line</a> () began to show an increase in riders. Chains such as <a href="Marshalls">Marshalls</a>, <a href="Staples%20Inc.">Staples</a>, and <a href="Target%20Corporation">Target</a> opened stores in the Bronx. More bank branches opened in the Bronx as a whole (rising from 106 in 1997 to 149 in 2007), although not primarily in poor or minority neighborhoods, while the Bronx still has fewer branches per person than other boroughs.

In 1997, the Bronx was designated an "<a href="All%20America%20City">All America City</a>" by the <a href="National%20Civic%20League">National Civic League</a>, acknowledging its comeback from the decline of the mid-century. In 2006, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported that "construction cranes have become the borough's new visual metaphor, replacing the window decals of the 1980s in which pictures of potted plants and drawn curtains were placed in the windows of abandoned buildings." The borough has experienced substantial new building construction since 2002. Between 2002 and June 2007, 33,687 new units of housing were built or were under way and $4.8 billion has been invested in new housing. In the first six months of 2007 alone total investment in new residential development was $965 million and 5,187 residential units were scheduled to be completed. Much of the new development is springing up in formerly vacant lots across the South Bronx.

In addition, there is a revitalization of the existing housing market in areas such as Hunts Point, the Lower Concourse, and the neighborhoods surrounding the Third Avenue Bridge as people buy apartments and renovate them. Several boutique and chain hotels have opened in recent years in the <a href="South%20Bronx">South Bronx</a>.

New developments are underway. The Bronx General Post Office on the corner of the Grand Concourse and East 149th Street is being converted into a market place, boutiques, restaurants and office space with a USPS concession. The <a href="Kingsbridge%20Armory">Kingsbridge Armory</a>, often cited as the largest armory in the world, is scheduled for redevelopment as the Kingsbridge National Ice Center.

Under consideration for future development is the construction of a platform over the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Subway">New York City Subway</a>'s <a href="Concourse%20Yard">Concourse Yard</a> adjacent to <a href="Lehman%20College">Lehman College</a>. The construction would permit approximately of development and would cost . In addition, a <a href="La%20Quinta%20Inn">La Quinta Inn</a> has been proposed for the Mott Haven waterfront.

According to the <a href="U.S.%20Census%20Bureau">U.S. Census Bureau</a>, Bronx County has a total area of , of which is land and (27%) is water.

The Bronx is the only part of New York City that is almost entirely situated on the North American mainland. Its <a href="bedrock">bedrock</a> is primarily <a href="gneiss">Fordham gneiss</a>, a high-grade heavily banded <a href="metamorphic%20rock">metamorphic rock</a> containing significant amounts of <a href="feldspar">pink feldspar</a>. Marble Hill – politically part of Manhattan but now physically attached to the Bronx – is so-called because of the formation of <a href="Inwood%20Marble">Inwood Marble</a> there as well as in <a href="Inwood%2C%20Manhattan">Inwood, Manhattan</a> and parts of the Bronx and Westchester County.

The <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> separates the Bronx on the west from <a href="Alpine%2C%20New%20Jersey">Alpine</a>, <a href="Tenafly%2C%20New%20Jersey">Tenafly</a> and <a href="Englewood%20Cliffs">Englewood Cliffs</a> in <a href="Bergen%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bergen County, New Jersey</a>; the <a href="Harlem%20River">Harlem River</a> separates it from the island of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> to the southwest; the <a href="East%20River">East River</a> separates it from <a href="Queens">Queens</a> to the southeast; and to the east, <a href="Long%20Island%20Sound">Long Island Sound</a> separates it from <a href="Nassau%20County%2C%20New%20York">Nassau County</a> in western Long Island. Directly north of the Bronx are (from west to east) the adjoining <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County</a> communities of <a href="Yonkers">Yonkers</a>, <a href="Mount%20Vernon%2C%20New%20York">Mount Vernon</a>, <a href="Pelham%20Manor">Pelham Manor</a> and <a href="New%20Rochelle">New Rochelle</a>. (There is also a short southern land boundary with <a href="Marble%20Hill%2C%20Manhattan">Marble Hill</a> in the Borough of Manhattan, over the filled-in former course of the <a href="Spuyten%20Duyvil%20Creek">Spuyten Duyvil Creek</a>. Marble Hill's postal <a href="ZIP%20code">ZIP code</a>, telephonic <a href="Area%20Code">Area Code</a> and fire service, however, are shared with the Bronx and not Manhattan.)

The <a href="Bronx%20River">Bronx River</a> flows south from Westchester County through the borough, emptying into the East River; it is the only entirely <a href="freshwater">freshwater</a> river in New York City. A smaller river, the <a href="Hutchinson%20River">Hutchinson River</a> (named after the religious leader <a href="Anne%20Hutchinson">Anne Hutchinson</a>, killed along its banks in 1641), passes through the East Bronx and empties into <a href="Eastchester%20Bay">Eastchester Bay</a>.

The Bronx also includes several small islands in the <a href="East%20River">East River</a> and <a href="Long%20Island%20Sound">Long Island Sound</a>, such as <a href="City%20Island%2C%20New%20York">City Island</a> and <a href="Hart%20Island%20%28New%20York%29">Hart Island</a>. <a href="Rikers%20Island">Rikers Island</a> in the East River, home to the large jail complex for the entire city, is also part of the Bronx.

The Bronx's highest elevation at is in the northwest corner, west of <a href="Van%20Cortlandt%20Park">Van Cortlandt Park</a> and in the Chapel Farm area near the <a href="Riverdale%20Country%20School">Riverdale Country School</a>. The opposite (southeastern) side of the Bronx has four large low peninsulas or "necks" of low-lying land that jut into the waters of the East River and were once <a href="salt%20marsh">salt marsh</a>: Hunt's Point, Clason's Point, Screvin's Neck and <a href="Throg%27s%20Neck">Throg's Neck</a>. Further up the coastline, <a href="Rodman%27s%20Neck">Rodman's Neck</a> lies between <a href="Pelham%20Bay%20Park">Pelham Bay Park</a> in the northeast and <a href="City%20Island%2C%20New%20York">City Island</a>. The Bronx's irregular shoreline extends for .

Although Bronx County was the third most densely populated county in the United States as of 2006 (after <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> and <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>), of the Bronx—about one-fifth of the Bronx's area, and one-quarter of its land area—is given over to parkland. The vision of a system of major Bronx parks connected by park-like thoroughfares is usually attributed to <a href="John%20Mullaly">John Mullaly</a>.

<a href="Woodlawn%20Cemetery%20%28Bronx%2C%20New%20York%29">Woodlawn Cemetery</a>, one of the largest cemeteries in New York City, sits on the western bank of the <a href="Bronx%20River">Bronx River</a> near <a href="Yonkers">Yonkers</a>. It opened in 1863, at a time when the Bronx was still considered a rural area.

The northern side of the borough includes the largest park in New York City—<a href="Pelham%20Bay%20Park">Pelham Bay Park</a>, which includes <a href="Orchard%20Beach%2C%20New%20York">Orchard Beach</a>—and the third-largest, <a href="Van%20Cortlandt%20Park">Van Cortlandt Park</a>, which is west of Woodlawn Cemetery and borders <a href="Yonkers">Yonkers</a>. Also in the northern Bronx, <a href="Wave%20Hill%20%28New%20York%29">Wave Hill</a>, the former estate of <a href="George%20Walbridge%20Perkins">George W. Perkins</a>—known for a historic house, gardens, changing site-specific art installations and concerts—overlooks the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Palisades">New Jersey Palisades</a> from a promontory on the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson</a> in <a href="Riverdale%2C%20Bronx">Riverdale</a>. Nearer the borough's center, and along the <a href="Bronx%20River">Bronx River</a>, is <a href="Bronx%20Park">Bronx Park</a>; its northern end houses the <a href="New%20York%20Botanical%20Gardens">New York Botanical Gardens</a>, which preserve the last patch of the original <a href="Tsuga">hemlock</a> forest that once covered the entire county, and its southern end the <a href="Bronx%20Zoo">Bronx Zoo</a>, the largest urban zoological gardens in the United States. Just south of <a href="Van%20Cortlandt%20Park">Van Cortlandt Park</a> is the <a href="Jerome%20Park%20Reservoir">Jerome Park Reservoir</a>, surrounded by of stone walls and bordering several small parks in the <a href="Bedford%20Park%2C%20Bronx">Bedford Park</a> neighborhood; the <a href="reservoir">reservoir</a> was built in the 1890s on the site of the former <a href="Jerome%20Park%20Racetrack">Jerome Park Racetrack</a>. Further south is <a href="Crotona%20Park">Crotona Park</a>, home to a lake, 28 species of trees, and a large swimming pool. The land for these parks, and many others, was bought by New York City in 1888, while land was still open and inexpensive, in anticipation of future needs and future pressures for development.

Some of the acquired land was set aside for the <a href="Grand%20Concourse%20%28Bronx%29">Grand Concourse</a> and <a href="Pelham%20Parkway">Pelham Parkway</a>, the first of a series of <a href="boulevard">boulevard</a>s and <a href="parkway">parkway</a>s (<a href="thoroughfare">thoroughfare</a>s lined with trees, vegetation and greenery). Later projects included the <a href="Bronx%20River%20Parkway">Bronx River Parkway</a>, which developed a road while restoring the riverbank and reducing pollution, <a href="Mosholu%20Parkway">Mosholu Parkway</a> and the <a href="Henry%20Hudson%20Parkway">Henry Hudson Parkway</a>.

In 2006, a five-year, $220-million program of capital improvements and natural restoration in 70 Bronx parks was begun (financed by water and sewer revenues) as part of an agreement that allowed a <a href="water%20filtration">water filtration</a> plant under Mosholu Golf Course in Van Cortlandt Park. One major focus is on opening more of the <a href="Bronx%20River">Bronx River</a>'s banks and restoring them to a natural state.

The number, locations, and boundaries of the Bronx's neighborhoods (many of them sitting on the sites of 19th-century villages) have become unclear with time and successive waves of newcomers. In 2006, Manny Fernandez of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote,
According to a <a href="New%20York%20City%20Department%20of%20City%20Planning">Department of City Planning</a> map of the city's neighborhoods, the Bronx has 49. The map publisher <a href="Hagstrom">Hagstrom</a> identifies 69. The borough president, <a href="Adolfo%20Carri%C3%B3n%20Jr.">Adolfo Carrión Jr.</a>, says 61. The Mayor's Community Assistance Unit, in a listing of the <a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board">borough's community boards</a>, names 68. <a href="English%20Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>, the online encyclopedia, lists 44.

Notable Bronx neighborhoods include the <a href="South%20Bronx">South Bronx</a>; Little Italy on <a href="Arthur%20Avenue">Arthur Avenue</a> in the <a href="Belmont%2C%20Bronx">Belmont</a> section; and <a href="Riverdale%2C%20Bronx">Riverdale</a>.

East of the <a href="Bronx%20River">Bronx River</a>, the borough is relatively flat and includes four large low peninsulas, or 'necks,' of low-lying land which jut into the waters of the East River and were once saltmarsh: Hunts Point, Clason's Point, Screvin's Neck (Castle Hill Point) and <a href="Throgs%20Neck">Throgs Neck</a>. The East Bronx has older tenement buildings, low income public housing complexes, and multifamily homes, as well as single family homes. It includes New York City's largest park: <a href="Pelham%20Bay%20Park">Pelham Bay Park</a> along the <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester</a>-Bronx border.

Neighborhoods include: <a href="Clason%27s%20Point%2C%20Bronx">Clason's Point</a>, <a href="Harding%20Park%2C%20Bronx">Harding Park</a>, <a href="Soundview%2C%20Bronx">Soundview</a>, <a href="Castle%20Hill%2C%20Bronx">Castle Hill</a>, <a href="Parkchester%2C%20Bronx">Parkchester</a> "(<a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board%209">Board 9</a>)"; <a href="Throggs%20Neck">Throggs Neck</a>, <a href="Country%20Club%2C%20Bronx">Country Club</a>, <a href="City%20Island%2C%20Bronx">City Island</a>, <a href="Pelham%20Bay">Pelham Bay</a>, <a href="Edgewater%20Park%20%28Bronx%29">Edgewater Park</a>, <a href="Co-op%20City%2C%20Bronx">Co-op City</a> "(<a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board%2010">Board 10</a>)"; <a href="Westchester%20Square%2C%20Bronx">Westchester Square</a>, <a href="Van%20Nest">Van Nest</a>, <a href="Pelham%20Parkway%2C%20Bronx">Pelham Parkway</a>, <a href="Morris%20Park%2C%20Bronx">Morris Park</a> "(<a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board%2011">Board 11</a>)"; <a href="Williamsbridge%2C%20Bronx">Williamsbridge</a>, <a href="Eastchester%2C%20Bronx">Eastchester</a>, <a href="Baychester%2C%20Bronx">Baychester</a>, <a href="Edenwald%2C%20Bronx">Edenwald</a> and <a href="Wakefield%2C%20Bronx">Wakefield</a> "(<a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board%2012">Board 12</a>)".

City Island is located east of <a href="Pelham%20Bay%20Park">Pelham Bay Park</a> in <a href="Long%20Island%20Sound">Long Island Sound</a> and is known for its seafood restaurants and private waterfront homes. City Island's single shopping street, City Island Avenue, is reminiscent of a small New England town. It is connected to <a href="Rodman%27s%20Neck">Rodman's Neck</a> on the mainland by the <a href="City%20Island%20Bridge">City Island Bridge</a>.

East of City Island is <a href="Hart%20Island%20%28New%20York%29">Hart Island</a>, which is uninhabited and not open to the public. It once served as a prison and now houses New York City's <a href="Potter%27s%20Field">Potter's Field</a> or pauper's graveyard for unclaimed bodies.

The western parts of the Bronx are hillier and are dominated by a series of parallel ridges, running south to north. The West Bronx has older apartment buildings, low income public housing complexes, multifamily homes in its lower income areas as well as larger single family homes in more affluent areas such as <a href="Riverdale%2C%20Bronx">Riverdale</a> and <a href="Fieldston%2C%20Bronx">Fieldston</a>. It includes New York City's fourth-largest park: <a href="Van%20Cortlandt%20Park">Van Cortlandt Park</a> along the Westchester-Bronx border. The <a href="Grand%20Concourse%20%28Bronx%29">Grand Concourse</a>, a wide boulevard, runs through it, north to south.

Neighborhoods include: Fordham-Bedford, <a href="Bedford%20Park%2C%20Bronx">Bedford Park</a>, <a href="Norwood%2C%20Bronx">Norwood</a>, <a href="Kingsbridge%20Heights">Kingsbridge Heights</a> "(<a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board%207">Board 7</a>)", <a href="Kingsbridge%2C%20Bronx">Kingsbridge</a>, <a href="Riverdale%2C%20Bronx">Riverdale</a> "(<a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board%208">Board 8</a>)", and <a href="Woodlawn%2C%20Bronx">Woodlawn</a> "(<a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board%2012">Board 12</a>)".

Like other <a href="neighborhoods%20in%20New%20York%20City">neighborhoods in New York City</a>, the South Bronx has no official boundaries. The name has been used to represent poverty in the Bronx and applied to progressively more northern places so that by the 2000s <a href="Fordham%20Road">Fordham Road</a> was often used as a northern limit. The <a href="Bronx%20River">Bronx River</a> more consistently forms an eastern boundary. The South Bronx has many high-density apartment buildings, low income public housing complexes, and multi-unit homes. The South Bronx is home to the <a href="Bronx%20County%20Courthouse">Bronx County Courthouse</a>, Borough Hall, and other government buildings, as well as <a href="Yankee%20Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a>. The <a href="Cross%20Bronx%20Expressway">Cross Bronx Expressway</a> bisects it, east to west. The South Bronx has some of the poorest neighborhoods in the country, as well as very high crime areas.

Neighborhoods include: <a href="The%20Hub%2C%20Bronx">The Hub</a> (a retail district at <a href="Third%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan-Bronx%29">Third Avenue</a> and East 149th Street), <a href="Port%20Morris%2C%20Bronx">Port Morris</a>, <a href="Mott%20Haven%2C%20Bronx">Mott Haven</a> "(<a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board%201">Board 1</a>)", <a href="Melrose%2C%20Bronx">Melrose</a> "(<a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board%201">Board 1</a> & <a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board%203">Board 3</a>)", <a href="Morrisania">Morrisania</a>, <a href="East%20Morrisania%2C%20Bronx">East Morrisania</a> [also known as Crotona Park East] "(<a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board%203">Board 3</a>)", <a href="Hunts%20Point%2C%20Bronx">Hunts Point</a>, <a href="Longwood%2C%20Bronx">Longwood</a> "(<a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board%202">Board 2</a>)", <a href="Highbridge%2C%20Bronx">Highbridge</a>, <a href="Concourse%2C%20Bronx">Concourse</a> "(<a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board%204">Board 4</a>)", <a href="West%20Farms%2C%20Bronx">West Farms</a>, <a href="Belmont%2C%20Bronx">Belmont</a>, <a href="East%20Tremont%2C%20Bronx">East Tremont</a> "(<a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board%206">Board 6</a>)", <a href="Tremont%2C%20Bronx">Tremont</a>, <a href="Morris%20Heights%2C%20Bronx">Morris Heights</a> "(<a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board%205">Board 5</a>)", <a href="University%20Heights%2C%20Bronx">University Heights</a>.

The Bronx adjoins:

The Bronx <a href="street%20grid">street grid</a> is irregular. Like the northernmost part of <a href="upper%20Manhattan">upper Manhattan</a>, the <a href="West%20Bronx">West Bronx</a>'s hilly terrain leaves a relatively free-style street grid. Much of the West Bronx's street numbering carries over from upper Manhattan, but does not match it exactly; East 132nd Street is the lowest numbered street in the Bronx. This dates from the mid-19th century when the southwestern area of <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County</a> west of the Bronx River, was incorporated into New York City and known as the Northside.

The <a href="East%20Bronx">East Bronx</a> is considerably flatter, and the street layout tends to be more regular. Only the <a href="Wakefield%2C%20Bronx">Wakefield</a> neighborhood picks up the street numbering, albeit at a misalignment due to Tremont Avenue's layout. At the same diagonal latitude, West 262nd Street in Riverdale matches East 237th Street in Wakefield.

Three major north-south thoroughfares run between Manhattan and the Bronx: <a href="Third%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan-Bronx%29">Third Avenue</a>, <a href="Park%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Park Avenue</a>, and <a href="Broadway%20%28Manhattan%29">Broadway</a>. Other major north-south roads include the <a href="Grand%20Concourse%20%28Bronx%29">Grand Concourse</a>, <a href="Jerome%20Avenue">Jerome Avenue</a>, <a href="Sedgwick%20Avenue">Sedgwick Avenue</a>, <a href="Webster%20Avenue">Webster Avenue</a>, and <a href="White%20Plains%20Road">White Plains Road</a>. Major east-west thoroughfares include <a href="Mosholu%20Parkway">Mosholu Parkway</a>, <a href="Gun%20Hill%20Road%20%28Bronx%29">Gun Hill Road</a>, <a href="Fordham%20Road">Fordham Road</a>, <a href="Pelham%20Parkway">Pelham Parkway</a>, and Tremont Avenue.

Most east-west streets are prefixed with either "East" or "West", to indicate on which side of Jerome Avenue they lie (continuing the similar system in Manhattan, which uses <a href="Fifth%20Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a> as the dividing line).

The historic <a href="Boston%20Post%20Road">Boston Post Road</a>, part of the long pre-revolutionary road connecting <a href="Boston">Boston</a> with other northeastern cities, runs east-west in some places, and sometimes northeast-southwest.

<a href="Mosholu%20Parkway">Mosholu</a> and <a href="Pelham%20Parkway">Pelham Parkway</a>s, with <a href="Bronx%20Park">Bronx Park</a> between them, <a href="Van%20Cortlandt%20Park">Van Cortlandt Park</a> to the west and <a href="Pelham%20Bay%20Park">Pelham Bay Park</a> to the east, are also linked by <a href="bridle%20path">bridle path</a>s.

As of the 2000 Census, approximately 61.6% of all Bronx households do not have access to a car. Citywide, the percentage of autoless households is 55%.

Since New York City's consolidation in 1898, the Bronx has been governed by the New York City Charter that provides for a "strong" <a href="Mayor-council%20government">mayor-council system</a>. The centralized New York City government is responsible for public education, correctional institutions, libraries, public safety, recreational facilities, sanitation, water supply, and welfare services in the Bronx.

The office of <a href="Borough%20President">Borough President</a> was created in the consolidation of 1898 to balance centralization with local authority. Each borough president had a powerful administrative role derived from having a vote on the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Board%20of%20Estimate">New York City Board of Estimate</a>, which was responsible for creating and approving the city's budget and proposals for land use. In 1989 the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> declared the Board of Estimate unconstitutional on the grounds that <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>, the most populous borough, had no greater effective representation on the Board than <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a>, the least populous borough, a violation of the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment's</a> <a href="Equal%20Protection%20Clause">Equal Protection Clause</a> pursuant to the high court's 1964 "one man, one vote" decision.

Since 1990 the Borough President has acted as an advocate for the borough at the mayoral agencies, the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Council">City Council</a>, the New York state government, and corporations.

Until March 1, 2009, the Borough President of the Bronx was <a href="Adolfo%20Carri%C3%B3n%20Jr.">Adolfo Carrión Jr.</a>, elected as a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> in 2001 and 2005 before retiring early to direct the <a href="White%20House%20Office%20of%20Urban%20Affairs%20Policy">White House Office of Urban Affairs Policy</a>. His successor, Democratic <a href="New%20York%20State%20Assembly">New York State Assembly</a> member <a href="Ruben%20Diaz%2C%20Jr.">Rubén Díaz, Jr.</a>, who won a special election on April 21, 2009 by a vote of 86.3% (29,420) on the "Bronx Unity" line to 13.3% (4,646) for the Republican district leader Anthony Ribustello on the "People First" line, became Borough President on May 1.

All of the Bronx's currently elected public officials have first won the nomination of the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28U.S.%29">Democratic Party</a> (in addition to any other endorsements). Local party platforms center on affordable housing, education and economic development. Controversial political issues in the Bronx include environmental issues, the cost of housing, and annexation of parkland for new <a href="Yankee%20Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a>.

Since its separation from <a href="New%20York%20County">New York County</a> on January 1, 1914, the Bronx, has had, like each of the other 61 counties of New York State, its own criminal court system and <a href="District%20attorney">District Attorney</a>, the chief public prosecutor who is directly elected by popular vote. <a href="Darcel%20D.%20Clark">Darcel D. Clark</a> has been the <a href="Bronx%20County%20District%20Attorney">Bronx County District Attorney</a> since 2016. Her predecessor was <a href="Robert%20T.%20Johnson">Robert T. Johnson</a>, was the District Attorney from 1989 to 2015. He was the first African-American District Attorney in New York State. 

<a href="Membership%20of%20the%20New%20York%20City%20Council">Eight members</a> of the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Council">New York City Council</a> represent districts wholly within the Bronx (11–18), while a ninth represents a Manhattan district (8) that also includes a small area of the Bronx. One of those members, <a href="Joel%20Rivera">Joel Rivera</a> (District 15), has been the Council's <a href="Majority%20Leader">Majority Leader</a> since 2002. In 2008, all of them were Democrats.

All of these Representatives won over 75% of their districts' respective votes in both 2004 and 2006. "<a href="National%20Journal">National Journal</a>'s" neutral rating system placed all of their voting records in 2005 and 2006 somewhere between very liberal and extremely liberal.

11 out of 150 members of the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Assembly">New York State Assembly</a> (the lower house of the state legislature) represent districts wholly within the Bronx. Six <a href="New%20York%20State%20Senate">State Senators</a> out of 62 represent Bronx districts, half of them wholly within the County, and half straddling other counties. All these legislators are Democrats who won between 65% and 100% of their districts' vote in 2006.

On the same day, <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a> won 54.4% of the borough's 5,643 Republican votes, <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Mitt Romney</a> 20.8%, <a href="Mike%20Huckabee">Mike Huckabee</a> 8.2%, <a href="Ron%20Paul">Ron Paul</a> 7.4%, <a href="Rudy%20Giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a> 5.6%, and the other candidates (<a href="Fred%20Thompson">Fred Thompson</a>, <a href="Duncan%20Hunter">Duncan Hunter</a> and <a href="Alan%20Keyes">Alan Keyes</a>) 3.6% between them.

After becoming a separate county in 1914, the Bronx has supported only two Republican Presidential candidates. It voted heavily for the winning Republican <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%20in%20New%20York%2C%201920">1920</a>, but much more narrowly on a split vote for his victorious Republican successor <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%20in%20New%20York%2C%201924">1924</a> (Coolidge 79,562; <a href="John%20W.%20Davis">John W. Davis</a>, Dem., 72,834; <a href="Robert%20M.%20La%20Follette%2C%20Sr.">Robert La Follette</a>, 62,202 equally divided between the <a href="Progressive%20Party%20%28United%20States%2C%201924%29">Progressive</a> and <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20America">Socialist</a> lines).

Since then, the Bronx has always supported the Democratic Party's nominee for President, starting with a vote of 2–1 for the unsuccessful <a href="Al%20Smith">Al Smith</a> in 1928, followed by four 2–1 votes for the successful <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>. (Both had been Governors of New York, but Republican former Gov. <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Dewey">Thomas E. Dewey</a> won only 28% of the Bronx's vote in 1948 against 55% for Pres. <a href="Harry%20Truman">Harry Truman</a>, the winning Democrat, and 17% for <a href="Henry%20A.%20Wallace">Henry A. Wallace</a> of the <a href="Progressive%20Party%20%28United%20States%2C%201948%29">Progressives</a>. It was only 32 years earlier, by contrast, that another Republican former Governor who narrowly lost the Presidency, <a href="Charles%20Evans%20Hughes">Charles Evans Hughes</a>, had won 42.6% of the Bronx's 1916 vote against Democratic President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>'s 49.8% and Socialist candidate <a href="Allan%20Benson">Allan Benson</a>'s 7.3%.)

The Bronx has often shown striking differences from other boroughs in <a href="New%20York%20City%20mayoral%20elections">elections for Mayor</a>. The only Republican to carry the Bronx since 1914 was <a href="Fiorello%20La%20Guardia">Fiorello La Guardia</a> in 1933, 1937 and 1941 (and in the latter two elections, only because his 30% to 32% vote on the <a href="American%20Labor%20Party">American Labor Party</a> line was added to 22% to 23% as a Republican). The Bronx was thus the only borough not carried by the successful Republican re-election campaigns of Mayors <a href="Rudolph%20Giuliani">Rudolph Giuliani</a> in 1997 and <a href="Michael%20Bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> in 2005. The anti-war <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20America">Socialist</a> campaign of <a href="Morris%20Hillquit">Morris Hillquit</a> in the <a href="New%20York%20City%20mayoral%20election%2C%201917">1917 mayoral election</a> won over 31% of the Bronx's vote, putting him second and well ahead of the 20% won by the incumbent pro-war Fusion Mayor <a href="John%20P.%20Mitchel">John P. Mitchel</a>, who came in second (ahead of Hillquit) everywhere else and outpolled Hillquit citywide by 23.2% to 21.7%.


Shopping malls and markets in the Bronx include:

Prominent shopping areas in the Bronx include <a href="Fordham%20Road">Fordham Road</a>, <a href="Bay%20Plaza%20Shopping%20Center">Bay Plaza</a> in <a href="Co-op%20City">Co-op City</a>, <a href="The%20Hub%2C%20Bronx">The Hub</a>, the <a href="Riverdale%2C%20Bronx">Riverdale</a>/<a href="Kingsbridge%2C%20Bronx">Kingsbridge</a> shopping center, and <a href="Bruckner%20Boulevard">Bruckner Boulevard</a>. Shops are also concentrated on streets aligned underneath elevated railroad lines, including Westchester Avenue, <a href="White%20Plains%20Road">White Plains Road</a>, <a href="Jerome%20Avenue">Jerome Avenue</a>, <a href="Southern%20Boulevard%20%28Bronx%29">Southern Boulevard</a>, and <a href="Broadway%20%28Bronx%29">Broadway</a>. The <a href="Gateway%20Center%20at%20Bronx%20Terminal%20Market">Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market</a> contains several <a href="big-box%20store">big-box store</a>s, which opened in 2009 south of Yankee Stadium.

There are three primary shopping centers in the Bronx: The Hub, Gateway Center and Southern Boulevard. The Hub–Third Avenue Business Improvement District (B.I.D.), in <a href="The%20Hub%2C%20Bronx">The Hub</a>, is the retail heart of the <a href="South%20Bronx">South Bronx</a>, located where four roads converge: East 149th Street, Willis, Melrose and Third Avenues. It is primarily located inside the neighborhood of <a href="Melrose%2C%20Bronx">Melrose</a> but also lines the northern border of Mott Haven. The Hub has been called "the Broadway of the Bronx", being likened to <a href="Broadway%20%28Bronx%29">the real Broadway</a> in Manhattan and the northwestern Bronx. It is the site of both maximum traffic and architectural density. In configuration, it resembles a miniature <a href="Times%20Square">Times Square</a>, a spatial "bow-tie" created by the geometry of the street. The Hub is part of <a href="Bronx%20Community%20Board%201">Bronx Community Board 1</a>.

The <a href="Gateway%20Center%20at%20Bronx%20Terminal%20Market">Gateway Center at Bronx Terminal Market</a>, in the <a href="West%20Bronx">West Bronx</a>, is a shopping center that encompasses less than one million square feet of retail space, built on a site that formerly held the Bronx Terminal Market, a wholesale fruit and vegetable market as well as the former Bronx House of Detention, south of <a href="Yankee%20Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a>. The $500 million shopping center, which was completed in 2009, saw the construction of new buildings and two smaller buildings, one new and the other a renovation of an existing building that was part of the original market. The two main buildings are linked by a six-level garage for 2,600 cars. The center has earned itself a <a href="Leadership%20in%20Energy%20and%20Environmental%20Design">LEED</a> "Silver" designation in its design.

Education in the Bronx is provided by a large number of public and private institutions, many of which draw students who live beyond the Bronx. The <a href="New%20York%20City%20Department%20of%20Education">New York City Department of Education</a> manages public noncharter schools in the borough. In 2000, public schools enrolled nearly 280,000 of the Bronx's residents over 3 years old (out of 333,100 enrolled in all pre-college schools). There are also several public <a href="charter%20schools">charter schools</a>. Private schools range from élite <a href="independent%20school">independent school</a>s to religiously affiliated <a href="parochial%20schools%23United%20States">schools</a> run by the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20New%20York">Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York</a> and Jewish organizations.

A small portion of land that is between Pelham and Pelham Bay Park, with a total of 35 houses, is a part of the Bronx, but is cut off from the rest of the borough due to the way the county boundaries were established; the New York City government pays for the residents' children to go to <a href="Pelham%20Union%20Free%20School%20District">Pelham Union Free School District</a> schools, including <a href="Pelham%20Memorial%20High%20School">Pelham Memorial High School</a>, since that is more cost effective than sending school buses to take the students to New York City schools. This arrangement has been in place since 1948.

In 2000, according to the <a href="U.S.%20Census">U.S. Census</a>, out of the nearly 800,000 people in the Bronx who were then at least 25 years old, 62.3% had graduated from high school and 14.6% held a bachelor's or higher college degree. These percentages were lower than those for New York's other boroughs, which ranged from 68.8% (Brooklyn) to 82.6% (Staten Island) for high school graduates over 24, and from 21.8% (Brooklyn) to 49.4% (Manhattan) for college graduates. (The respective state and national percentages were "[NY]" 79.1% & 27.4% and "[US]" 80.4% & 24.4%.)

In the 2000 Census, 79,240 of the nearly 95,000 Bronx residents enrolled in high school attended public schools.

Many public <a href="High%20school%20%28North%20America%29">high schools</a> are located in the borough including the elite <a href="Bronx%20High%20School%20of%20Science">Bronx High School of Science</a>, <a href="Celia%20Cruz%20Bronx%20High%20School%20of%20Music">Celia Cruz Bronx High School of Music</a>, <a href="DeWitt%20Clinton%20High%20School">DeWitt Clinton High School</a>, <a href="High%20School%20for%20Violin%20and%20Dance">High School for Violin and Dance</a>, <a href="Bronx%20Leadership%20Academy%202">Bronx Leadership Academy 2</a>, <a href="Bronx%20International%20High%20School">Bronx International High School</a>, the <a href="School%20for%20Excellence">School for Excellence</a>, the <a href="Morris%20Academy%20for%20Collaborative%20Study">Morris Academy for Collaborative Study</a>, Wings Academy for young adults, The Bronx School for Law, Government and Justice, Validus Preparatory Academy, The Eagle Academy For Young Men, Bronx Expeditionary Learning High School, Bronx Academy of Letters, <a href="Herbert%20H.%20Lehman%20High%20School">Herbert H. Lehman High School</a> and <a href="High%20School%20of%20American%20Studies%20at%20Lehman%20College">High School of American Studies</a>. The Bronx is also home to three of New York City's most prestigious private, secular schools: <a href="Ethical%20Culture%20Fieldston%20School">Fieldston</a>, <a href="Horace%20Mann%20School">Horace Mann</a>, and <a href="Riverdale%20Country%20School">Riverdale Country School</a>.

High schools linked to the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> include: <a href="St.%20Raymond%20Academy">Saint Raymond's Academy for Girls</a>, <a href="All%20Hallows%20High%20School">All Hallows High School</a>, <a href="Fordham%20Preparatory%20School">Fordham Preparatory School</a>, <a href="Monsignor%20Scanlan%20High%20School">Monsignor Scanlan High School</a>, <a href="St.%20Raymond%20High%20School%20for%20Boys">St. Raymond High School for Boys</a>, <a href="Cardinal%20Hayes%20High%20School">Cardinal Hayes High School</a>, <a href="Cardinal%20Spellman%20High%20School%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Cardinal Spellman High School</a>, <a href="Academy%20of%20Mount%20St.%20Ursula%20High%20School">The Academy of Mount Saint Ursula</a>, <a href="Aquinas%20High%20School%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Aquinas High School</a>, <a href="Preston%20High%20School%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Preston High School</a>, <a href="St.%20Catharine%20Academy">St. Catharine Academy</a>, <a href="Mount%20Saint%20Michael%20Academy">Mount Saint Michael Academy</a>, and <a href="St.%20Barnabas%20High%20School">St. Barnabas High School</a>.

The <a href="SAR%20Academy">SAR Academy</a> and <a href="SAR%20High%20School">SAR High School</a> are <a href="Modern%20Orthodox">Modern Orthodox</a> Jewish <a href="Yeshiva">Yeshiva</a> coeducational day schools in <a href="Riverdale%2C%20Bronx">Riverdale</a>, with roots in Manhattan's <a href="Lower%20East%20Side">Lower East Side</a>.

In the 1990s, New York City began closing the large, public high schools in the Bronx and replacing them with small high schools. Among the reasons cited for the changes were poor graduation rates and concerns about safety. Schools that have been closed or reduced in size include <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20High%20School%20%28Bronx%2C%20New%20York%29">John F. Kennedy</a>, <a href="James%20Monroe%20High%20School%20%28New%20York%29">James Monroe</a>, <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft%20High%20School%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Taft</a>, <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt%20High%20School%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, <a href="Adlai%20E.%20Stevenson%20High%20School%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Adlai Stevenson</a>, <a href="Evander%20Childs%20High%20School">Evander Childs</a>, <a href="Christopher%20Columbus%20High%20School%20%28Bronx%2C%20New%20York%29">Christopher Columbus</a>, <a href="Morris%20High%20School%20%28Bronx%2C%20New%20York%29">Morris</a>, <a href="Walton%20High%20School%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Walton</a>, and South Bronx High Schools. More recently the City has started phasing out large middle schools, also replacing them with smaller schools.

In 2000, 49,442 (57.5%) of the 86,014 Bronx residents seeking college, graduate or professional degrees attended public institutions.

Several colleges and universities are located in the Bronx.

<a href="Fordham%20University">Fordham University</a> was founded as St. John's College in 1841 by the <a href="Archdiocese%20of%20New%20York">Diocese of New York</a> as the first Catholic institution of higher education in the <a href="Northeast%20United%20States">northeast</a>. It is now officially an independent institution, but strongly embraces its <a href="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> heritage. The Bronx campus, known as Rose Hill, is the main campus of the university, and is among the largest within the city (other Fordham campuses are located in Manhattan and Westchester County).

Three campuses of the <a href="City%20University%20of%20New%20York">City University of New York</a> are in the Bronx: <a href="Hostos%20Community%20College">Hostos Community College</a>, <a href="Bronx%20Community%20College">Bronx Community College</a> (occupying the former <a href="University%20Heights%2C%20Bronx">University Heights</a> Campus of <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>) and Herbert H. <a href="Lehman%20College">Lehman College</a> (formerly the uptown campus of <a href="Hunter%20College">Hunter College</a>), which offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees.

The <a href="College%20of%20Mount%20Saint%20Vincent">College of Mount Saint Vincent</a> is a Catholic liberal arts college in <a href="Riverdale%2C%20Bronx">Riverdale</a> under the direction of the <a href="Sisters%20of%20Charity%20of%20New%20York">Sisters of Charity of New York</a>. Founded in 1847 as a school for girls, the academy became a degree-granting college in 1911 and began admitting men in 1974. The school serves 1,600 students. Its campus is also home to the <a href="Academy%20for%20Jewish%20Religion%20%28New%20York%29">Academy for Jewish Religion</a>, a transdenominational rabbinical and cantorial school.

<a href="Manhattan%20College">Manhattan College</a> is a Catholic college in <a href="Riverdale%2C%20Bronx">Riverdale</a> which offers undergraduate programs in the arts, business, education, engineering, and science. It also offers graduate programs in education and engineering.

<a href="Albert%20Einstein%20College%20of%20Medicine">Albert Einstein College of Medicine</a>, part of the <a href="Montefiore%20Medical%20Center">Montefiore Medical Center</a>, is in <a href="Morris%20Park%2C%20Bronx">Morris Park</a>.

Two colleges based in <a href="Westchester%20County">Westchester County</a> have Bronx campuses. The Catholic and nearly all-female <a href="The%20College%20of%20New%20Rochelle">College of New Rochelle</a> maintains satellite campuses at <a href="Co-op%20City">Co-op City</a> and in <a href="The%20Hub%2C%20Bronx">The Hub</a>. The coeducational and non-sectarian <a href="Mercy%20College%20%28New%20York%29">Mercy College</a> in <a href="Dobbs%20Ferry%2C%20New%20York">Dobbs Ferry</a>, founded by the Catholic <a href="Sisters%20of%20Mercy">Sisters of Mercy</a> in 1950, has a campus near <a href="Westchester%20Square%2C%20Bronx">Westchester Square</a>.

By contrast, the private, proprietary <a href="Monroe%20College">Monroe College</a>, focused on preparation for business and the professions, started in the Bronx in 1933 but now has a campus in <a href="New%20Rochelle%2C%20New%20York">New Rochelle</a> (Westchester County) as well the Bronx's <a href="Fordham%2C%20Bronx">Fordham</a> neighborhood.

The <a href="State%20University%20of%20New%20York%20Maritime%20College">State University of New York Maritime College</a> in <a href="Fort%20Schuyler">Fort Schuyler</a> (<a href="Throggs%20Neck">Throggs Neck</a>)—at the far southeastern tip of the Bronx—is the national leader in maritime education and houses the <a href="Maritime%20Industry%20Museum">Maritime Industry Museum</a>. (Directly across <a href="Long%20Island%20Sound">Long Island Sound</a> is <a href="Kings%20Point%2C%20New%20York">Kings Point</a>, Long Island, home of the <a href="United%20States%20Merchant%20Marine%20Academy">United States Merchant Marine Academy</a> and the American Merchant Marine Museum.) As of 2017, graduates from the university earned an average annual salary of $144,000, the highest of any university graduates in the United States.

Author <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> spent the last years of his life (1846 to 1849) in the Bronx at <a href="Poe%20Cottage">Poe Cottage</a>, now located at <a href="Kingsbridge%2C%20Bronx">Kingsbridge</a> Road and the <a href="Grand%20Concourse%20%28Bronx%29">Grand Concourse</a>. A small wooden farmhouse built around 1812, the cottage once commanded unobstructed vistas over the rolling Bronx hills to the shores of <a href="Long%20Island">Long Island</a>. Poe moved there to get away from the Manhattan city air and crowding in hope that the then rural area would be beneficial for his wife's tuberculosis. It was in the Bronx that Poe wrote one of his most famous works, <a href="Annabel%20Lee">Annabel Lee</a>.

More than a century later, the Bronx would evolve from a hot bed of <a href="Latin%20jazz">Latin jazz</a> to an incubator of <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> as documented in the award-winning documentary, produced by <a href="City%20Lore">City Lore</a> and broadcast on <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20Service">PBS</a> in 2006, "From Mambo to Hip Hop: A South Bronx Tale." Hip Hop first emerged in the South Bronx in the early 1970s. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" has identified 1520 <a href="Sedgwick%20Avenue">Sedgwick Avenue</a> "an otherwise unremarkable high-rise just north of the <a href="Cross%20Bronx%20Expressway">Cross Bronx Expressway</a> and hard along the <a href="Major%20Deegan%20Expressway">Major Deegan Expressway</a>" as a starting point, where <a href="DJ%20Kool%20Herc">DJ Kool Herc</a> presided over parties in the community room. The 2016 <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a> series "<a href="The%20Get%20Down">The Get Down</a>" is based on the development of hip hop in 1977 in the South Bronx. Ten years earlier, the <a href="Bronx%20Opera">Bronx Opera</a> had been founded.

On August 11, 1973, DJ Kool Herc was a <a href="D.J.">D.J.</a> and <a href="M.C.">M.C.</a> at a party in the <a href="recreation%20room">recreation room</a> of <a href="1520%20Sedgwick%20Avenue">1520 Sedgwick Avenue</a> in the Bronx adjacent to the Cross Bronx Expressway. While it was not the actual "Birthplace of Hip Hop" – the <a href="genre">genre</a> developed slowly in several places in the 1970s – it was verified to be the place where "one of" the pivotal and formative events occurred. Specifically:
Beginning with the advent of beat match DJing, in which Bronx DJs (<a href="Disc%20jockey">Disc Jockey</a>s) including <a href="Grandmaster%20Flash">Grandmaster Flash</a>, <a href="Afrika%20Bambaataa">Afrika Bambaataa</a> and <a href="DJ%20Kool%20Herc">DJ Kool Herc</a> extended the breaks of <a href="funk">funk</a> records, a major new musical genre emerged that sought to isolate the percussion breaks of hit funk, <a href="disco">disco</a> and <a href="soul%20music">soul</a> songs. As hip hop's popularity grew, performers began speaking ("<a href="rapping">rapping</a>") in sync with the beats, and became known as MCs or emcees. The <a href="Herculoids">Herculoids</a>, made up of Herc, <a href="Coke%20La%20Rock">Coke La Rock</a>, and <a href="DJ%20Clark%20Kent">DJ Clark Kent</a>, were the earliest to gain major fame. The Bronx is referred to in hip-hop slang as "The Boogie Down Bronx", or just "The Boogie Down". This was hip-hop pioneer <a href="KRS-One">KRS-One</a>'s inspiration for his thought provoking group BDP, or <a href="Boogie%20Down%20Productions">Boogie Down Productions</a>, which included DJ <a href="Scott%20La%20Rock">Scott La Rock</a>. Newer hip hop artists from the Bronx include <a href="Big%20Pun">Big Pun</a>, <a href="Peter%20Gunz">Lord Toriq and Peter Gunz</a>, <a href="Camp%20Lo">Camp Lo</a>, <a href="Swizz%20Beatz">Swizz Beatz</a>, <a href="Drag-On">Drag-On</a>, <a href="Fat%20Joe">Fat Joe</a>, <a href="Terror%20Squad%20%28group%29">Terror Squad</a> and <a href="Corey%20Gunz">Corey Gunz</a>.

, a tour company founded in 2002 by local licensed sightseeing tour guide Debra Harris, has established a sightseeing tour of the Bronx showcasing the locations that helped shape hip hop culture, and features some of the pioneers of hip hop as tour guides. The Bronx's recognition as an important center of <a href="African-American%20culture">African-American culture</a> has led <a href="Fordham%20University">Fordham University</a> to establish the Bronx African-American History Project (BAAHP).

The Bronx is the home of the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> of <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>. The original <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Yankee Stadium</a> opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue, a year that saw the Yankees bring home their first of 27 World Series Championships. With the famous facade, the short right field porch and Monument Park, Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball's greatest players including <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a>, <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a>, <a href="Joe%20DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a>, <a href="Whitey%20Ford">Whitey Ford</a>, <a href="Yogi%20Berra">Yogi Berra</a>, <a href="Mickey%20Mantle">Mickey Mantle</a>, <a href="Reggie%20Jackson">Reggie Jackson</a>, <a href="Thurman%20Munson">Thurman Munson</a>, <a href="Don%20Mattingly">Don Mattingly</a>, <a href="Derek%20Jeter">Derek Jeter</a> and <a href="Mariano%20Rivera">Mariano Rivera</a>.

The original stadium was the scene of <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a>'s Farewell Speech in 1939, Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, Roger Maris' record breaking 61st home run in 1961, and Reggie Jackson's 3 home runs to clinch Game 6 of the 1977 World Series. The Stadium was the former home of the <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a> of the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> from 1956 to 1973.

The original Yankee Stadium closed in 2008 to make way for a new <a href="Yankee%20Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a> in which the team started play in 2009; it's north-northeast of the 1923 Yankee Stadium, on the former site of Macombs Dam Park. The current Yankee Stadium is also the home of <a href="New%20York%20City%20FC">New York City FC</a> of <a href="Major%20League%20Soccer">Major League Soccer</a>, who began play in 2015.

The Bronx is home to several <a href="Off-Off-Broadway">Off-Off-Broadway</a> theaters, many staging new works by immigrant playwrights from Latin America and Africa. The Pregones Theater, which produces Latin American work, opened a new 130-seat theater in 2005 on Walton Avenue in the South Bronx. Some artists from elsewhere in New York City have begun to converge on the area, and housing prices have nearly quadrupled in the area since 2002. However rising prices directly correlate to a housing shortage across the city and the entire metro area.

The <a href="Bronx%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Dance">Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance</a>, founded in 1998 by <a href="Arthur%20Aviles">Arthur Aviles</a> and Charles Rice-Gonzales, provides dance, theatre and art workshops, festivals and performances focusing on contemporary and modern art in relation to race, gender, and sexuality. It is home to the Arthur Aviles Typical Theatre, a contemporary dance company, and the Bronx Dance Coalition. The Academy was formerly in the <a href="American%20Bank%20Note%20Company%20Building">American Bank Note Company Building</a> before relocating to a venue on the grounds of St. Peter's Episcopal Church.

The <a href="Bronx%20Museum%20of%20the%20Arts">Bronx Museum of the Arts</a>, founded in 1971, exhibits 20th century and contemporary art through its central museum space and of galleries. Many of its exhibitions are on themes of special interest to the Bronx. Its permanent collection features more than 800 works of art, primarily by artists from Africa, Asia and Latin America, including paintings, photographs, prints, drawings, and mixed media. The museum was temporarily closed in 2006 while it underwent a major expansion designed by the architectural firm <a href="Arquitectonica">Arquitectonica</a>.

The Bronx has also become home to a peculiar poetic tribute in the form of the "<a href="Heinrich%20Heine">Heinrich Heine</a> Memorial," better known as the <a href="Lorelei%20Fountain">Lorelei Fountain</a>. After Heine's German birthplace of <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a> had rejected, allegedly for <a href="anti-Semitic">anti-Semitic</a> motives, a centennial monument to the radical <a href="German-Jewish">German-Jewish</a> poet (1797–1856), his incensed <a href="German-American">German-American</a> admirers, including <a href="Carl%20Schurz">Carl Schurz</a>, started a movement to place one instead in <a href="Midtown%20Manhattan">Midtown Manhattan</a>, at <a href="Fifth%20Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a> and 59th Street. However, this intention was thwarted by a combination of ethnic antagonism, aesthetic controversy and political struggles over the institutional control of public art. In 1899, the memorial by <a href="Ernst%20Gustav%20Herter">Ernst Gustav Herter</a> was placed in <a href="Joyce%20Kilmer%20Park">Joyce Kilmer Park</a>, near the <a href="Yankee%20Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a>. In 1999, it was moved to 161st Street and the Concourse.

The <a href="peninsula">peninsula</a>r borough's maritime heritage is acknowledged in several ways.<a href="http%3A//www.cityislandmuseum.org/">The City Island Historical Society and Nautical Museum</a> occupies a former public school designed by the New York City school system's turn-of-the-last-century master architect <a href="C.%20B.%20J.%20Snyder">C.

The state's <a href="SUNY%20Maritime%20College">Maritime College</a> in <a href="Fort%20Schuyler">Fort Schuyler</a> (on the southeastern shore) houses the <a href="Maritime%20Industry%20Museum">Maritime Industry Museum</a>. In addition, the Harlem River is reemerging as <a href="Sculling">"Scullers' Row"</a> due in large part to the efforts of the Bronx River Restoration Project, a joint public-private endeavor of the city's parks department. <a href="Canoeing">Canoeing</a> and <a href="kayaking">kayaking</a> on the borough's namesake river have been promoted by the <a href="http%3A//www.bronxriver.org/">Bronx River Alliance</a>.

The Bronx has several local newspapers, including "The <a href="Bronx%20News">Bronx News</a>", "<a href="Parkchester">Parkchester</a> News", "City News", "The <a href="Riverdale%20Press">Riverdale Press</a>", "<a href="Riverdale%20Review">Riverdale Review</a>", "The <a href="Bronx%20Times%20Reporter">Bronx Times Reporter</a>", "<a href="Inner%20City%20Press">Inner City Press</a>" (which now has more of a focus on national issues) and "<a href="Co-op%20City">Co-op City</a> Times". Four non-profit news outlets, "<a href="Norwood%2C%20Bronx">Norwood</a> News", "Mount Hope Monitor", "<a href="Mott%20Haven%20Herald">Mott Haven Herald</a>" and "The <a href="Hunts%20Point%2C%20Bronx">Hunts Point</a> Express" serve the borough's poorer communities. The editor and co-publisher of "The Riverdale Press", Bernard Stein, won the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Editorial%20Writing">Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing</a> for his editorials about Bronx and New York City issues in 1998. (Stein graduated from the <a href="Bronx%20High%20School%20of%20Science">Bronx High School of Science</a> in 1959.)

The Bronx once had its own daily newspaper, "<a href="The%20Bronx%20Home%20News">The Bronx Home News</a>", which started publishing on January 20, 1907, and merged into the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" in 1948. It became a special section of the Post, sold only in the Bronx, and eventually disappeared from view.

One of New York City's major non-commercial radio broadcasters is <a href="WFUV">WFUV</a>, a <a href="National%20Public%20Radio">National Public Radio</a>-affiliated 50,000-watt station broadcasting from <a href="Fordham%20University">Fordham University</a>'s Rose Hill campus in the Bronx. The radio station's antenna is atop an apartment building owned by <a href="Montefiore%20Medical%20Center">Montefiore Medical Center</a>.

The City of New York has an official television station run by the <a href="NYC%20Media%20Group">NYC Media Group</a> and broadcasting from <a href="Bronx%20Community%20College">Bronx Community College</a>, and <a href="Cablevision">Cablevision</a> operates <a href="News%2012%20Networks">News 12 The Bronx</a>, both of which feature programming based in the Bronx. <a href="Co-op%20City">Co-op City</a> was the first area in the Bronx, and the first in New York beyond <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, to have its own <a href="cable%20television">cable television</a> provider. The local <a href="public-access%20television">public-access television</a> station <a href="BronxNet">BronxNet</a> originates from Herbert H. Lehman College, the borough's only four year CUNY school, and provides <a href="government-access%20television">government-access television</a> (GATV) public affairs programming in addition to programming produced by Bronx residents.

Mid-20th century movies set in the Bronx portrayed densely settled, working-class, urban culture. Hollywood films such as "<a href="From%20This%20Day%20Forward">From This Day Forward</a>" (1946), set in <a href="Highbridge%2C%20Bronx">Highbridge</a>, occasionally delved into Bronx life. <a href="Paddy%20Chayefsky">Paddy Chayefsky</a>'s <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>-winning "<a href="Marty%20%28film%29">Marty</a>" was the most notable examination of working class Bronx life was also explored by Chayefsky in his 1956 film "<a href="The%20Catered%20Affair">The Catered Affair</a>", and in the 1993 <a href="Robert%20De%20Niro">Robert De Niro</a>/<a href="Chazz%20Palminteri">Chazz Palminteri</a> film, "<a href="A%20Bronx%20Tale">A Bronx Tale</a>", <a href="Spike%20Lee">Spike Lee</a>'s 1999 movie "<a href="Summer%20of%20Sam">Summer of Sam</a>", centered in an <a href="Italian-American">Italian-American</a> Bronx community, 1994's "<a href="I%20Like%20It%20Like%20That%20%28film%29">I Like It Like That</a>" that takes place in the predominantly <a href="Puerto%20Rican%20people">Puerto Rican</a> neighborhood of the South Bronx, and "Doughboys", the story of two Italian-American brothers in danger of losing their bakery thanks to one brother's gambling debts.

The Bronx's gritty urban life had worked its way into the movies even earlier, with depictions of the "<a href="Bronx%20cheer%20%28gesture%29">Bronx cheer</a>", a loud flatulent-like sound of disapproval, allegedly first made by <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> fans. The sound can be heard, for example, on the <a href="Spike%20Jones">Spike Jones</a> and His City Slickers recording of "Der Fuehrer's Face" (from the 1942 <a href="Disney">Disney</a> <a href="animated%20film">animated film</a> of the <a href="Der%20Fuehrer%27s%20Face">same name</a>), repeatedly lambasting <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> with: "We'll Heil! (Bronx cheer) Heil! (Bronx cheer) Right in Der Fuehrer's Face!"

Some movies have also used the term "Bronx" for comic effect, such as "Bronx", the character on the <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a> animated series "<a href="Gargoyles%20%28TV%20series%29">Gargoyles</a>".

Starting in the 1970s, the Bronx often symbolized violence, decay, and urban ruin. The wave of arson in the South Bronx in the 1960s and 1970s inspired the observation that "The Bronx is burning": in 1974 it was the title of both a <a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a> <a href="editorial">editorial</a> and a <a href="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="documentary%20film">documentary film</a>. The line entered the pop-consciousness with Game Two of the <a href="1977%20World%20Series">1977 World Series</a>, when a fire broke out near <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Yankee Stadium</a> as the team was playing the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>. Numerous fires had previously broken out in the Bronx prior to this fire. As the fire was captured on live television, announcer <a href="Howard%20Cosell">Howard Cosell</a> <a href="The%20Bronx%20Is%20Burning%23Summary">is wrongly remembered to have said something like</a>, "There it is, ladies and gentlemen: the Bronx is burning". Historians of New York City frequently point to Cosell's remark as an acknowledgement of both the city and the borough's decline. A new feature-length documentary film by <a href="Edwin%20Pagan">Edwin Pagan</a> called "Bronx Burning" is in production in 2006, chronicling what led up to the numerous arson-for-insurance fraud fires of the 1970s in the borough.

Bronx gang life was depicted in the 1974 novel "The Wanderers" by Bronx native <a href="Richard%20Price%20%28writer%29">Richard Price</a> and the <a href="The%20Wanderers%20%281979%20film%29">1979 movie of the same name</a>. They are set in the heart of the Bronx, showing apartment life and the then-landmark Krums ice cream parlor. In the 1979 film "<a href="The%20Warriors%20%28film%29">The Warriors</a>", the eponymous gang go to a meeting in <a href="Van%20Cortlandt%20Park">Van Cortlandt Park</a> in the Bronx, and have to fight their way out of the borough and get back to <a href="Coney%20Island">Coney Island</a> in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>. "<a href="A%20Bronx%20Tale">A Bronx Tale</a>" (1993) depicts gang activities in the <a href="Belmont%2C%20Bronx">Belmont</a> "Little Italy" section of the Bronx. The 2005 video game adaptation features levels called Pelham, Tremont, and "Gunhill" (a play off the name <a href="Gun%20Hill%20Road%20%28Bronx%29">Gun Hill Road</a>). This theme lends itself to the title of "<a href="The%20Bronx%20Is%20Burning">The Bronx Is Burning</a>", an eight-part <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> TV mini-series (2007) about the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>' drive to winning baseball's <a href="1977%20World%20Series">1977 World Series</a>. The TV series emphasizes the boisterous nature of the team, led by manager <a href="Billy%20Martin">Billy Martin</a>, catcher <a href="Thurman%20Munson">Thurman Munson</a> and outfielder <a href="Reggie%20Jackson">Reggie Jackson</a>, as well as the malaise of the Bronx and New York City in general during that time, such as the blackout, the city's serious financial woes and near bankruptcy, the arson for insurance payments, and the election of <a href="Ed%20Koch">Ed Koch</a> as mayor.

The 1981 film "<a href="Fort%20Apache%2C%20The%20Bronx">Fort Apache, The Bronx</a>" is another film that used the Bronx's gritty image for its storyline. The movie's title is from the nickname for the 41st Police Precinct in the South Bronx which was nicknamed "Fort Apache". Also from 1981 is the horror film "<a href="Wolfen%20%28film%29">Wolfen</a>" making use of the rubble of the Bronx as a home for werewolf type creatures. "<a href="Knights%20of%20the%20South%20Bronx">Knights of the South Bronx</a>", a true story of a teacher who worked with disadvantaged children, is another film also set in the Bronx released in 2005. The Bronx was the setting for the 1983 film "<a href="Fuga%20dal%20Bronx">Fuga dal Bronx</a>", also known as "Bronx Warriors 2" and "Escape 2000", an Italian B-movie best known for its appearance on the television series <a href="Mystery%20Science%20Theatre%203000">Mystery Science Theatre 3000</a>. The plot revolves around a sinister construction corporation's plans to depopulate, destroy and redevelop the Bronx, and a band of rebels who are out to expose the corporation's murderous ways and save their homes. The film is memorable for its almost incessant use of the phrase, "Leave the Bronx!" Many of the movie's scenes were filmed in <a href="Queens">Queens</a>, substituting as the Bronx. "<a href="Rumble%20in%20the%20Bronx">Rumble in the Bronx</a>" was a 1995 Jackie Chan kung-fu film, another which popularised the Bronx to international audiences. "<a href="Last%20Bronx">Last Bronx</a>", a 1996 Sega game played on the bad reputation of the Bronx to lend its name to an alternate version of post-Japanese bubble Tokyo, where crime and gang warfare is rampant.

Bronx native <a href="Nancy%20Savoca">Nancy Savoca</a>'s 1989 comedy, "<a href="True%20Love%20%281989%20film%29">True Love</a>", explores two <a href="Italian-American">Italian-American</a> Bronx sweethearts in the days before their wedding. The film, which debuted <a href="Annabella%20Sciorra">Annabella Sciorra</a> and <a href="Ron%20Eldard">Ron Eldard</a> as the betrothed couple, won the Grand Jury Prize at that year's <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a>. The <a href="CBS">CBS</a> <a href="television%20sitcom">television sitcom</a> "<a href="Becker%20%28TV%20series%29">Becker</a>", 1998–2004, was more ambiguous. The show starred <a href="Ted%20Danson">Ted Danson</a> as Dr. John Becker, a doctor who operated a small practice and was constantly annoyed by his patients, co-workers, friends, and practically everything and everybody else in his world. It showed his everyday life as a doctor working in a small clinic in the Bronx.

<a href="Penny%20Marshall">Penny Marshall</a>'s 1990 film "<a href="Awakenings">Awakenings</a>", which was nominated for several <a href="Academy%20Awards">Oscars</a>, is based on neurologist <a href="Oliver%20Sacks">Oliver Sacks</a>' <a href="Awakenings%20%28book%29">1973 account</a> of his psychiatric patients at Beth Abraham Hospital in the Bronx who were paralyzed by a form of <a href="encephalitis">encephalitis</a> but briefly responded to the drug <a href="L-dopa">L-dopa</a>. <a href="Robin%20Williams">Robin Williams</a> played the physician; <a href="Robert%20De%20Niro">Robert De Niro</a> was one of the patients who emerged from a <a href="Catatonia">catatonic</a> (frozen) state. The home of Williams' character was shot not far from Sacks' actual <a href="City%20Island%2C%20Bronx">City Island</a> residence. A 1973 <a href="https%3A//query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html%3Fres%3D9A00E3D8103DF932A15752C0A9679C8B63">Yorkshire Television documentary</a> and "A Kind of Alaska", a 1985 play by <a href="Harold%20Pinter">Harold Pinter</a>, were also based on Sacks' book.

<a href="Gus%20Van%20Sant">Gus Van Sant</a>'s 2000 "<a href="Finding%20Forrester">Finding Forrester</a>" was quickly billed "<a href="Good%20Will%20Hunting">Good Will Hunting</a> in the Hood." <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a> is in the title role of a reclusive old man who 50 years earlier wrote a single novel that garnered the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>. He meets 16-year-old Jamal, portrayed by <a href="Rob%20Brown%20%28actor%29">Rob Brown</a>, a gifted basketball player and aspiring writer from the Bronx, and becomes his mentor. The movie includes stock footage of Bronx housing projects from 1990, as well as some other scenes shot in Manhattan and Brooklyn.

The 2012 documentary "South Bronx United" features the <a href="Mott%20Haven%2C%20Bronx">Mott Haven</a> neighborhood and its conflict over the online grocery delivery service <a href="Fresh%20Direct">Fresh Direct</a>'s move of their trucking facility from <a href="Long%20Island%20City">Long Island City</a> to the <a href="South%20Bronx">South Bronx</a>.

The Bronx has been featured significantly in fiction literature. All of the characters in <a href="Herman%20Wouk">Herman Wouk</a>'s (1948) live in the Bronx, and about half of the action is set there. <a href="Kate%20Simon">Kate Simon</a>'s "Bronx Primitive: Portraits of a Childhood" is directly autobiographical, a warm account of a Polish-Jewish girl in an immigrant family growing up before World War II, and living near <a href="Arthur%20Avenue">Arthur Avenue</a> and <a href="Tremont%20Avenue">Tremont Avenue</a>. In Jacob M. Appel's short story, "The Grand Concourse" (2007), a woman who grew up in the iconic <a href="Lewis%20Morris">Lewis Morris</a> Building returns to the <a href="Morrisania">Morrisania</a> neighborhood with her adult daughter. Similarly, in <a href="Avery%20Corman">Avery Corman</a>'s book "The Old Neighborhood" (1980), an upper-middle class white protagonist returns to his birth neighborhood (<a href="Fordham%20Road">Fordham Road</a> and the <a href="Grand%20Concourse%20%28Bronx%29">Grand Concourse</a>), and learns that even though the folks are poor, Hispanic and African-American, they are good people.

By contrast, <a href="Tom%20Wolfe">Tom Wolfe</a>'s "<a href="The%20Bonfire%20of%20the%20Vanities">Bonfire of the Vanities</a>" (1987) portrays a wealthy, white protagonist, Sherman McCoy, getting lost off the <a href="Major%20Deegan%20Expressway">Major Deegan Expressway</a> in the <a href="South%20Bronx">South Bronx</a> and having an altercation with locals. A substantial piece of the last part of the book is set in the resulting riotous trial at the Bronx County Courthouse. However, times change, and in 2007, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported that "the Bronx neighborhoods near the site of Sherman's accident are now dotted with townhouses and apartments." In the same article, the Reverend <a href="Al%20Sharpton">Al Sharpton</a> (whose fictional analogue in the novel is "Reverend Bacon") asserts that "twenty years later, the cynicism of "The Bonfire of the Vanities" is as out of style as <a href="Tom%20Wolfe">Tom Wolfe</a>'s wardrobe."

<a href="Don%20DeLillo">Don DeLillo</a>'s "<a href="Underworld%20%28DeLillo%20novel%29">Underworld</a>" (1997) is also set in the Bronx and offers a perspective on the decline of the area from the 1950s onwards. <a href="John%20Patrick%20Shanley">John Patrick Shanley</a>'s "<a href="Savage%20in%20Limbo">Savage in Limbo</a>" is set in a 1980s Bronx bar called 'Scales' where the frustrated characters feel they are unable to move.

In poetry, the Bronx has been immortalized by one of the world's shortest <a href="couplet">couplet</a>s:
<poem style="margin-left: 2em;">The Bronx
No Thonx

Nash repented 33 years after his <a href="calumny">calumny</a>, penning in 1964 the following <a href="prose%20poem">prose poem</a> to the Dean of <a href="Bronx%20Community%20College">Bronx Community College</a>:
<poem style="margin-left: 2em;">I can't seem to escape
the sins of my smart-alec youth;
Here are my amends.
I wrote those lines, "The Bronx?
No thonx";
I shudder to confess them.
Now I'm an older, wiser man
I cry, "The Bronx?
God bless them!"</poem>

In 2016, W. R. Rodriguez published "Bronx Trilogy"—consisting of "the shoe shine parlor poems et al", "concrete pastures of the beautiful bronx", and "from the banks of brook avenue". The trilogy celebrates Bronx people, places, and events. <a href="DeWitt%20Clinton%20High%20School">DeWitt Clinton High School</a>, <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20Park%20%28Bronx%29">St. Mary's Park</a>, and Brook Avenue are a few of the schools, parks, and streets Rodriguez uses as subjects for his poems.

Nash's couplet "The Bronx No Thonx" and his subsequent blessing are mentioned in "Bronx Accent: A Literary and Pictorial History of the Borough", edited by Llyod Ultan and Barbara Unger and published in 2000. The book, which includes the work of Yiddish poets, offers a selection from <a href="Alan%20Ginsberg">Alan Ginsberg</a>’s "Kaddish," as his Aunt Elanor and his mother, Naomi, lived near Woodlawn Cemetery. Also featured is Ruth Lisa Schecther’s poem, "Bronx," which is described as a celebration of the borough’s landmarks. There is a selection of works from poets such as <a href="Sandra%20Maria%20Esteves">Sandra Maria Esteves</a>, <a href="Milton%20Kessler">Milton Kessler</a>, Joan Murray, W. R. Rodriguez, Myra Shapiro, Gayl Teller, and <a href="Terence%20Winch">Terence Wynch</a>.

"" is a published <a href="anthology">anthology</a> by the Bronx Council of the Arts and brought forth through a series of workshops meant to empower Bronx residents and shed the stigma on the Bronx's burning past. The Bronx Memoir Project was created as an ongoing collaboration between the Bronx Council on the Arts and other <a href="cultural%20institution">cultural institution</a>s, including The Bronx <a href="Documentary%20film">Documentary</a> Center, The Bronx Library Center, <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Poe</a> Park Visitor Center, Mindbuilders, and other institutions and funded through a grant from the <a href="National%20Endowment%20for%20the%20Arts">National Endowment for the Arts</a>. The goal was to develop and refine memoir fragments written by people of all walks of life that share a common bond residing within the Bronx.

BearShare

BearShare was a <a href="peer-to-peer%20file%20sharing">peer-to-peer file sharing</a> application originally created by Free Peers, Inc. for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> and also a rebranded version of <a href="iMesh">iMesh</a> by MusicLab, LLC, tightly integrated with their music subscription service.

The principal operators of Free Peers, Inc. were Vincent Falco and Louis Tatta. Bearshare was launched on December 4, 2000 as a <a href="Gnutella">Gnutella</a>-based peer-to-peer file sharing application with innovative features that eventually grew to include IRC chat, a free library of software and media called BearShare Featured Artists, online help pages and a support forum integrated as dedicated web browser windows in the application; as well as a media player and a library window to organize the user's media collection.

Following the June 27, 2005 <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> decision on the "<a href="MGM%20Studios%2C%20Inc.%20v.%20Grokster%2C%20Ltd.">MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.</a>" case the BearShare Community support forums were abruptly closed during negotiations to settle an impending lawsuit with the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">RIAA</a>. The webmaster and forum administrator immediately created a new site called Technutopia and the same support staff continue to support the gnutella versions from there. A few months later the unused Community window was removed from BearShare 5.1.

On May 4, 2006, Free Peers agreed to transfer all their BearShare-related assets to MusicLab, LLC (an <a href="iMesh">iMesh</a> subsidiary) and use the $30 million raised from that sale to settle with the RIAA.

On August 17, 2006, MusicLab released a reskinned and updated version of <a href="iMesh">iMesh</a> named BearSharev6 which connected to its proprietary <a href="iMesh">iMesh</a> network instead of <a href="gnutella">gnutella</a>. BearShareV6 and its successors offer paid music downloads in the <a href="PlaysForSure">PlaysForSure</a> <a href="Digital%20rights%20management">DRM</a> controlled <a href="Windows%20Media%20Audio">WMA</a> format as well as free content in various formats, chiefly MP3. Like BearShare they also include a media player and embedded online and social networking features but with a Web 2.0 style, somewhat similar to <a href="MySpace">MySpace</a> or <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a>. Free content provided by users is automatically verified using <a href="acoustic%20fingerprinting">acoustic fingerprinting</a> as non-infringing before it can be shared. Video files more than 50 Mb in size and 15 minutes in length cannot be shared, ensuring television shows and feature-length movies cannot be distributed over the network. Only a limited set of music and video file types can be shared, thus excluding everything else like executable files, documents and compressed archives.

In August 2006, MusicLab released a variant of the original BearShare <a href="gnutella">gnutella</a> servant, called BearFlix, which was altered to limit sharing, searches and downloads to images and videos. Shared videos were limited in length and duration, similar to limits in BearShareV6. The first release was version 1.2.1. Its version numbers appear to start from 1.1.2.1 in the user interface but it presents itself on the gnutella network as versions 6.1.2.1 to 6.2.2.530. This version has since been discontinued by MusicLab and no longer available on their websites; however it remains in wide usage.

On October 27, 2008, responding to uncertainty around the future of <a href="PlaysForSure">PlaysForSure</a>, MusicLab added <a href="iPod">iPod</a> support in BearShareV7.

As of June 12, 2016, BearShare is no longer available to download. The official page with a message announcing its discontinuation remained active until March 2017.

Three variants of the original BearShare <a href="gnutella">gnutella</a> servant were distributed by Free Peers: Free, Lite and Pro. The Free version had higher performance limits than the Lite version but contained some <a href="adware">adware</a>. The Pro version had higher limits than both the Free and Lite versions but cost <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>24. Version numbers in this series ranged from 1.0 to 5.2.5.9. Though lacking MusicLab's support a wide spread of BearShare versions from 4.7 to 5.2.5.6 remain the second most popular servant on gnutella, alongside LimeWire.

Old-School fans of the gnutella versions tend to favour the last of the beta versions, 5.1.0 beta25, because it has no adware, is hard-coded for performance levels roughly between Pro and regular [ad-supported] versions and has the unique ability to switch between leaf and ultrapeer mode on demand, a feature deemed necessary for effective testing. No other gnutella servant has enjoyed this capability.

The most recent MusicLab version, V10, was available by free download from their support website and "Pro" features could be unlocked with a six or twelve-month subscription. Access to premium content required a $9.95 monthly subscription. Customers in Canada and the U.S.A. could opt for a $14.95 monthly "BearShare ToGo" subscription which allowed downloads of premium music to portable music players.

Belgium

Belgium (), officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a <a href="sovereign%20state">sovereign state</a> in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between <a href="Germanic-speaking%20Europe">Germanic</a> and <a href="Romance-speaking%20Europe">Latin Europe</a>, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly <a href="Flemish%20people">Flemish</a> community, which constitutes about 59 percent of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly <a href="Walloons">Walloon</a> population, which comprises 40 percent of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small 1 percent group of German-speakers who live in the <a href="East%20Cantons">East Cantons</a>.

Historically, Belgium lay in the area known as the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a>, a somewhat larger area than the current <a href="Benelux">Benelux</a> group of states that also included parts of Northern France and Western Germany. The region was called Belgica in Latin, after the <a href="Roman%20province">Roman province</a> of <a href="Gallia%20Belgica">Gallia Belgica</a>. From the end of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> until the 17th century, the area of Belgium was a prosperous and cosmopolitan centre of commerce and culture. From the 16th century until the <a href="Belgian%20Revolution">Belgian Revolution</a> in 1830, when Belgium seceded from the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, the area of Belgium served as the battleground between many European powers, causing it to be dubbed the "Battlefield of Europe", a reputation strengthened by both <a href="world%20war">world war</a>s.

Today, Belgium is a <a href="Federation">federal</a> <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> with a <a href="parliamentary%20system">parliamentary system</a> of governance. It is divided into three regions and three communities, that exist next to each other. Its two largest regions are the Dutch-speaking region of <a href="Flemish%20Region">Flanders</a> in the north and the mostly French-speaking southern part of the <a href="Wallonia">Wallonia</a> region. The <a href="Brussels">Brussels-Capital Region</a> is an officially bilingual (French and Dutch) <a href="List%20of%20enclaves%20and%20exclaves%23Subnational%20enclaves%20which%20are%20not%20exclaves">enclave</a> within the Flemish Region. A <a href="German-speaking%20Community%20of%20Belgium">German-speaking Community</a> exists in eastern Wallonia.
Belgium's linguistic diversity and related political conflicts are reflected in its <a href="history%20of%20Belgium">political history</a> and <a href="Communities%20and%20regions%20of%20Belgium">complex system of governance</a>, made up of <a href="List%20of%20governments%20in%20Belgium">six different governments</a>.

Belgium participated in the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>
and, during the course of the 20th century, possessed <a href="Belgian%20colonial%20empire">a number of colonies in Africa</a>. The second half of the 20th century was marked by rising tensions between the Dutch-speaking and the French-speaking citizens fueled by <a href="culture%20of%20Belgium">differences in language and culture</a> and the <a href="Economy%20of%20Belgium%23Regional%20differences">unequal economic development</a> of Flanders and Wallonia. This continuing antagonism has led to several <a href="state%20reform%20in%20Belgium">far-reaching reforms</a>, resulting in a transition from a <a href="unitary%20state">unitary</a> to a <a href="federalism">federal</a> arrangement during the period from 1970 to 1993. Despite the reforms, tensions between the groups have remained, if not increased; there is significant separatism particularly <a href="Flemish%20Movement">among the Flemish</a>; controversial language laws exist such as the <a href="municipalities%20with%20language%20facilities">municipalities with language facilities</a>; and the formation of a coalition government took 18 months following the <a href="Belgian%20federal%20election%2C%202010">June 2010 federal election</a>, a world record. Unemployment in Wallonia is more than double that of Flanders, which boomed after the war.

Belgium is one of the six founding countries of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> and hosts the official seats of the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, and the European Council, as well as a seat of the European Parliament in the country's capital, <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>. Belgium is also a founding member of the <a href="Eurozone">Eurozone</a>, <a href="NATO">NATO</a>, <a href="Organisation%20for%20Economic%20Co-operation%20and%20Development">OECD</a> and <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">WTO</a>, and a part of the trilateral Benelux Union. Brussels hosts several of the EU's official seats as well as the headquarters of many major international organizations such as NATO. Belgium is also a part of the <a href="Schengen%20Area">Schengen Area</a>. Belgium is a <a href="developed%20country">developed country</a>, with an advanced high-income economy and is categorized as "very high" in the <a href="Human%20Development%20Index">Human Development Index</a>.

The name "Belgium" is derived from "<a href="Gallia%20Belgica">Gallia Belgica</a>", a <a href="Roman%20province">Roman province</a> in the northernmost part of <a href="Gaul">Gaul</a> that before Roman invasion in 100 BC, was inhabited by the "<a href="Belgae">Belgae</a>", a mix of <a href="Celts">Celtic</a> and <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic peoples</a>.
A <a href="Migration%20Period">gradual immigration</a> by Germanic <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> tribes during the 5th century brought the area under the rule of the <a href="Merovingian">Merovingian</a> kings. A gradual shift of power during the 8th century led the kingdom of the Franks to evolve into the <a href="Carolingian%20Empire">Carolingian Empire</a>.

The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Verdun">Treaty of Verdun</a> in 843 divided the region into <a href="Middle%20Francia">Middle</a> and <a href="West%20Francia">West Francia</a> and therefore into a set of more or less independent <a href="fiefdom">fiefdom</a>s which, during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, were <a href="vassal">vassal</a>s either of the <a href="King%20of%20France">King of France</a> or of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>.

<a href="Timeline%20of%20Burgundian%20and%20Habsburg%20acquisitions%20in%20the%20Low%20Countries">Many of these fiefdoms</a> were united in the <a href="Burgundian%20Netherlands">Burgundian Netherlands</a> of the 14th and 15th centuries.
<a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Charles V</a> extended the <a href="personal%20union">personal union</a> of the <a href="Seventeen%20Provinces">Seventeen Provinces</a> in the 1540s, making it far more than a personal union by the <a href="Pragmatic%20Sanction%20of%201549">Pragmatic Sanction of 1549</a> and increased his influence over the <a href="Prince-Bishopric%20of%20Li%C3%A8ge">Prince-Bishopric of Liège</a>.

The <a href="Eighty%20Years%27%20War">Eighty Years' War</a> (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into the northern <a href="Dutch%20Republic">United Provinces</a> ("Belgica Foederata" in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, the "Federated Netherlands") and the <a href="Southern%20Netherlands">Southern Netherlands</a> ("Belgica Regia", the "Royal Netherlands"). The latter were ruled successively by the <a href="Habsburg%20Spain">Spanish</a> (<a href="Spanish%20Netherlands">Spanish Netherlands</a>) and the <a href="History%20of%20Austria%23Charles%20VI%20and%20Maria%20Theresa%20%281711%E2%80%931780%29">Austrian</a> <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a>s (<a href="Austrian%20Netherlands">Austrian Netherlands</a>) and comprised most of modern Belgium. This was the theatre of most <a href="Franco-Spanish%20War%20%281635%29">Franco-Spanish</a> and <a href="War%20of%20the%20Austrian%20Succession">Franco-Austrian wars</a> during the 17th and 18th centuries.

Following the , the Low Countries—including territories that were never nominally under Habsburg rule, such as the Prince-Bishopric of Liège—were annexed by the <a href="French%20First%20Republic">French First Republic</a>, ending Austrian rule in the region. The reunification of the Low Countries as the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands">United Kingdom of the Netherlands</a> occurred at the dissolution of the <a href="First%20French%20Empire">First French Empire</a> in 1815, after the defeat of Napoleon.

In 1830, the <a href="Belgian%20Revolution">Belgian Revolution</a> led to the separation of the Southern Provinces from the Netherlands and to the establishment of a Catholic and bourgeois, officially French-speaking and neutral, independent Belgium under a <a href="Provisional%20Government%20of%20Belgium">provisional government</a> and a <a href="national%20Congress%20of%20Belgium">national congress</a>.
Since the installation of <a href="Leopold%20I%20of%20Belgium">Leopold I</a> as king on 1831, now celebrated as Belgium's <a href="National%20Day">National Day</a>, Belgium has been a <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> and <a href="parliamentary%20democracy">parliamentary democracy</a>, with a <a href="La%C3%AFcit%C3%A9">laicist</a> constitution based on the <a href="Napoleonic%20code">Napoleonic code</a>. Although the franchise was initially restricted, <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a> for men was introduced after the <a href="Belgian%20general%20strike%20of%201893">general strike of 1893</a> (with <a href="plural%20voting">plural voting</a> until 1919) and for women in 1949.

The main political parties of the 19th century were the <a href="Catholic%20Party%20%28Belgium%29">Catholic Party</a> and the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28Belgium%29">Liberal Party</a>, with the <a href="Belgian%20Labour%20Party">Belgian Labour Party</a> emerging towards the end of the 19th century. French was originally the single official language adopted by the <a href="nobility">nobility</a> and the <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a>. It progressively lost its overall importance as Dutch became recognized as well. This recognition became official in 1898 and in 1967 the parliament accepted a Dutch version of the <a href="Belgian%20Constitution">Constitution</a>.

The <a href="Berlin%20Conference">Berlin Conference</a> of 1885 ceded control of the <a href="Congo%20Free%20State">Congo Free State</a> to <a href="Leopold%20II%20of%20Belgium">King Leopold II</a> as his private possession. From around 1900 there was growing international concern for the extreme and savage treatment of the Congolese population under Leopold II, for whom the Congo was primarily a source of revenue from ivory and rubber production. Many Congolese were killed by Leopold's agents for failing to meet production quotas for ivory and rubber. It is estimated that nearly 10 million were killed during the Leopold period. In 1908, this outcry led the Belgian state to assume responsibility for the government of the colony, henceforth called the <a href="Belgian%20Congo">Belgian Congo</a>. A Belgian commission in 1919 estimated that Congo's population was half what it was in 1879.

<a href="German%20invasion%20of%20Belgium">Germany invaded Belgium in August 1914</a> as part of the <a href="Schlieffen%20Plan">Schlieffen Plan</a> to attack <a href="France">France</a>, and much of the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> fighting of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> occurred in western parts of the country. The opening months of the war were known as the <a href="Rape%20of%20Belgium">Rape of Belgium</a> due to German excesses. Belgium assumed control of the <a href="German%20colonies">German colonies</a> of <a href="Ruanda-Urundi">Ruanda-Urundi</a> (modern-day <a href="Rwanda">Rwanda</a> and <a href="Burundi">Burundi</a>) during the war, and in 1924 the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> mandated them to Belgium. In the aftermath of the First World War, Belgium annexed the <a href="districts%20of%20Prussia">Prussian districts</a> of <a href="Eupen-Malmedy">Eupen and Malmedy</a> in 1925, thereby causing the presence of a German-speaking minority.

<a href="Battle%20of%20Belgium">German forces again invaded the country in May 1940</a>, and 40,690 Belgians, over half of them Jews, were killed during the subsequent <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Belgium%20during%20World%20War%20II">occupation</a> and <a href="The%20Holocaust%20in%20Belgium">The Holocaust</a>. From September 1944 to February 1945 <a href="Allied%20advance%20from%20Paris%20to%20the%20Rhine">the Allies liberated</a> Belgium. After World War II, <a href="General%20strike%20against%20Leopold%20III%20of%20Belgium">a general strike</a> forced King <a href="Leopold%20III%20of%20Belgium">Leopold III</a> to abdicate in 1951, since <a href="Royal%20Question">many Belgians felt he had collaborated with Germany</a> during the war. The Belgian Congo gained independence in 1960 during the <a href="Congo%20Crisis">Congo Crisis</a>; Ruanda-Urundi followed with its independence two years later. Belgium joined <a href="NATO">NATO</a> as a founding member and formed the Benelux group of nations with the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Belgium became one of the six founding members of the <a href="European%20Coal%20and%20Steel%20Community">European Coal and Steel Community</a> in 1951 and of the <a href="European%20Atomic%20Energy%20Community">European Atomic Energy Community</a> and <a href="European%20Economic%20Community">European Economic Community</a>, established in 1957. The latter has now become the European Union, for which Belgium hosts major administrations and institutions, including the <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a>, the <a href="Council%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Council of the European Union</a> and the extraordinary and committee sessions of the <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a>.

Belgium shares borders with <a href="France">France</a> (), <a href="Germany">Germany</a> (), <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> () and the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> (). Its total surface, including water area, is 30,528 square kilometres from which land area alone 30,278 km. It lies between latitudes 49°30 and 51°30 N, and longitudes 2°33 and 6°24 E.

Belgium has three main geographical regions; the coastal plain in the northwest and the central plateau both belong to the Anglo-Belgian Basin, and the <a href="Ardennes">Ardennes</a> uplands in the southeast to the <a href="Variscan%20orogeny">Hercynian orogenic belt</a>. The <a href="Paris%20Basin">Paris Basin</a> reaches a small fourth area at Belgium's southernmost tip, <a href="Belgian%20Lorraine">Belgian Lorraine</a>.
The coastal plain consists mainly of sand dunes and <a href="polder">polder</a>s. Further inland lies a smooth, slowly rising landscape irrigated by numerous waterways, with fertile valleys and the northeastern sandy plain of the <a href="Campine">Campine</a> ("Kempen"). The thickly forested hills and plateaux of the Ardennes are more rugged and rocky with caves and small <a href="canyon">gorges</a>. Extending westward into France, this area is eastwardly connected to the <a href="Eifel">Eifel</a> in Germany by the <a href="High%20Fens">High Fens</a> plateau, on which the <a href="Signal%20de%20Botrange">Signal de Botrange</a> forms the country's highest point at .

<a href="Climate%20of%20Belgium">The climate</a> is <a href="Oceanic%20climate">maritime temperate</a> with significant precipitation in all seasons (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a>: "Cfb"), like most of northwest Europe. The average temperature is lowest in January at and highest in July at . The average precipitation per month varies between for February and April, to for July. Averages for the years 2000 to 2006 show daily temperature minimums of and maximums of and monthly rainfall of ; these are about 1 °C and nearly 10 millimetres above last century's normal values, respectively.

<a href="Phytogeography">Phytogeographically</a>, Belgium is shared between the Atlantic European and Central European provinces of the <a href="Circumboreal%20Region">Circumboreal Region</a> within the <a href="Boreal%20Kingdom">Boreal Kingdom</a>. According to the <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">World Wide Fund for Nature</a>, the territory of Belgium belongs to the <a href="ecoregion">ecoregion</a> of Atlantic mixed forests. Because of its high population density, industrialization and its location in the centre of Western Europe, Belgium still faces some <a href="Environment%20of%20Belgium">environmental problems</a>. However, due to consistent efforts by the various levels of government in Belgium, the state of the environment in Belgium is gradually improving. This led to Belgium being ranked as <a href="Environmental%20Performance%20Index">one of the top 10 countries</a> (9 out of 132) in terms of environmental protection trends, and to Belgium being ranked in 2012 as the 24th country out of 132 for environmental protection. Belgium moreover has one of Europe's highest waste recycling rates. In particular, the Flemish region of Belgium has the highest waste diversion rate in Europe. Almost 75 percent of the residential waste produced there is reused, recycled, or composted.

The territory of Belgium is divided into three Regions, two of which, the <a href="Flemish%20Region">Flemish Region</a> and <a href="Wallonia">Walloon Region</a>, are in turn subdivided into <a href="provinces%20of%20Belgium">provinces</a>; the third Region, the <a href="Brussels%20Capital%20Region">Brussels Capital Region</a>, is neither a province nor a part of a province.

Belgium is a <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional</a>, <a href="popular%20monarchy">popular monarchy</a> and a <a href="federalism">federal</a> <a href="parliamentary%20system">parliamentary democracy</a>. The <a href="bicameralism">bicameral</a> <a href="Belgian%20Federal%20Parliament">federal parliament</a> is composed of a <a href="Senate%20%28Belgium%29">Senate</a> and a <a href="Chamber%20of%20Representatives%20%28Belgium%29">Chamber of Representatives</a>. The former is made up of 50 senators appointed by the parliaments of the <a href="Communities%2C%20regions%20and%20language%20areas%20of%20Belgium">communities and regions</a> and 10 <a href="Belgian%20Senate%23Co-opted%20Senators">co-opted senators</a>. Prior to 2014, most of the Senate's members were directly elected. The <a href="Chambers%20of%20parliament">Chamber</a>'s 150 representatives are elected under a <a href="proportional%20voting">proportional voting</a> system from 11 <a href="Arrondissements%20of%20Belgium">electoral districts</a>. Belgium has <a href="compulsory%20voting">compulsory voting</a> and thus maintains one of the highest rates of <a href="voter%20turnout">voter turnout</a> in the world.

The <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Belgium">King</a> (currently <a href="Philippe%20of%20Belgium">Philippe</a>) is the <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a>, though with limited <a href="Royal%20Prerogative">prerogatives</a>. He appoints ministers, including a Prime Minister, that have the confidence of the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Belgium">Chamber of Representatives</a> to form the <a href="federal%20government">federal government</a>. The Council of Ministers is composed of no more than fifteen members. With the possible exception of the Prime Minister, the Council of Ministers is composed of an equal number of Dutch-speaking members and French-speaking members.
The judicial system is based on <a href="civil%20law%20%28legal%20system%29">civil law</a> and originates from the <a href="Napoleonic%20code">Napoleonic code</a>. The <a href="Court%20of%20Cassation%20%28Belgium%29">Court of Cassation</a> is the court of last resort, with the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20%28Belgium%29">Court of Appeal</a> one level below.

Belgium's political institutions are complex; <a href="Pillarisation">most political power is organized around the need to represent the main cultural communities</a>.
Since about 1970, the significant national <a href="Political%20parties%20in%20Belgium">Belgian political parties</a> have split into distinct components that mainly represent the political and linguistic interests of these communities.
The major parties in each community, though close to the political centre, belong to three main groups: <a href="Christian%20democracy">Christian Democrats</a>, <a href="Liberalism%20in%20Belgium">Liberals</a>, and <a href="Social%20democracy">Social Democrats</a>.
Further notable parties came into being well after the middle of last century, mainly around <a href="List%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20Belgium%23Linguistic%20parties">linguistic</a>, nationalist, or environmental themes and recently smaller ones of some specific liberal nature.

A string of Christian Democrat coalition governments from 1958 <a href="Belgian%20federal%20election%2C%201999">was broken in 1999</a> after the first <a href="dioxine%20affair">dioxin crisis</a>, a major <a href="Food%20contaminant">food contamination</a> scandal. A "rainbow coalition" emerged from six parties: the Flemish and the French-speaking Liberals, Social Democrats and Greens. Later, a "<a href="Purple%20%28government%29">purple coalition</a>" of Liberals and Social Democrats formed after the Greens lost most of their seats in the <a href="Belgian%20federal%20election%2C%202003">2003 election</a>.

The government led by Prime Minister <a href="Guy%20Verhofstadt">Guy Verhofstadt</a> from 1999 to 2007 achieved a balanced budget, some <a href="tax%20reform">tax reform</a>s, a labour-market reform, scheduled <a href="Nuclear%20energy%20policy%23Europe">nuclear phase-out</a> and instigated legislation allowing more stringent <a href="War%20Crimes%20Law%20%28Belgium%29">war crime</a> and more lenient <a href="soft%20drugs">soft drug usage</a> prosecution. Restrictions on withholding <a href="euthanasia">euthanasia</a> were reduced and <a href="same-sex%20marriage%20in%20Belgium">same-sex marriage</a> legalized. The government promoted active diplomacy in Africa and <a href="Governmental%20positions%20on%20the%20Iraq%20War%20prior%20to%20the%202003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">opposed the invasion of Iraq</a>. It is the only country that does not have age restrictions on euthanasia.

Verhofstadt's coalition fared badly in the <a href="Belgian%20federal%20election%2C%202007">June 2007 elections</a>. For more than a year, the country experienced a <a href="2007%20Belgian%20government%20formation">political crisis</a>. This crisis was such that many observers speculated on a possible <a href="partition%20of%20Belgium">partition of Belgium</a>. From 2007 until 2008 the temporary <a href="Verhofstadt%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BIII%20Government">Verhofstadt III Government</a> was in office. This coalition of the <a href="Christen-Democratisch%20en%20Vlaams">Flemish</a> and <a href="Humanist%20Democratic%20Centre">Francophone Christian Democrats</a>, the <a href="Open%20Vlaamse%20Liberalen%20en%20Democraten">Flemish</a> and <a href="Mouvement%20R%C3%A9formateur">Francophone Liberals</a> together with the <a href="Socialist%20Party%20%28francophone%20Belgium%29">Francophone Social Democrats</a> was an interim government until 2008.

On that day a <a href="Leterme%20I%20Government">new government</a>, led by Flemish Christian Democrat <a href="Yves%20Leterme">Yves Leterme</a>, the actual winner of the federal elections of , was sworn in by the king. On 2008 Leterme announced the resignation of the cabinet to the king, as no progress in <a href="state%20reform%20in%20Belgium">constitutional reforms</a> had been made.
In December 2008 he once more offered his resignation to the king after a <a href="2008%E2%80%932009%20Belgian%20financial%20crisis">crisis</a> surrounding the sale of <a href="Fortis%20%28finance%29">Fortis</a> to <a href="BNP%20Paribas">BNP Paribas</a>. At this juncture, his resignation was accepted and <a href="Christen-Democratisch%20en%20Vlaams">Christian Democratic and Flemish</a> <a href="Herman%20Van%20Rompuy">Herman Van Rompuy</a> was sworn in as Prime Minister on 2008.

After Herman Van Rompuy was designated the first permanent <a href="President%20of%20the%20European%20Council">President of the European Council</a> on 2009, he offered the resignation of his government to King Albert II on 2009. A few hours later, the <a href="Leterme%20II%20Government">new government</a> under Prime Minister <a href="Yves%20Leterme">Yves Leterme</a> was sworn in. On 2010, Leterme again offered the resignation of his cabinet to the king after one of the coalition partners, the <a href="OpenVLD">OpenVLD</a>, withdrew from the government, and on 2010 King Albert officially accepted the resignation.

The Parliamentary elections in Belgium on 2010 saw the Flemish nationalist <a href="New%20Flemish%20Alliance">N-VA</a> become the largest party in Flanders, and the Socialist Party PS the largest party in Wallonia. Until December 2011, Belgium was governed by Leterme's <a href="caretaker%20government">caretaker government</a> awaiting the end of the deadlocked negotiations for <a href="2010%E2%80%932011%20Belgian%20government%20formation">formation of a new government</a>. By 30 March 2011 this set a new world record for the elapsed time without an official government, previously held by war-torn <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>. Finally, in December 2011 the <a href="Di%20Rupo%20Government">Di Rupo Government</a> led by Walloon socialist Prime Minister <a href="Elio%20Di%20Rupo">Elio Di Rupo</a> was sworn in.

The <a href="Belgian%20federal%20election%2C%202014">2014 federal election</a> (coinciding with the <a href="Belgian%20regional%20elections%2C%202014">regional elections</a>) resulted in a further electoral gain for the Flemish nationalist N-VA, although the incumbent coalition (composed of Flemish and French-speaking Social Democrats, Liberals, and Christian Democrats) maintains a solid majority in Parliament and in all electoral constituencies. On 22 July 2014, King Philippe nominated <a href="Charles%20Michel">Charles Michel</a> (MR) and <a href="Kris%20Peeters">Kris Peeters</a> (CD&V) to <a href="2014%20Belgian%20government%20formation">lead the formation of a new federal cabinet</a> composed of the Flemish parties N-VA, CD&V, Open Vld and the French-speaking MR, which resulted in the <a href="Michel%20Government">Michel Government</a>. It is the first time N-VA is part of the federal cabinet, while the French-speaking side is represented only by the MR, which achieved a minority of the public votes in Wallonia.

Following a usage which can be traced back to the Burgundian and Habsburgian courts, in the 19th century it was necessary to speak French to belong to the governing upper class, and those who could only speak Dutch were effectively second-class citizens. Late that century, and continuing into the 20th century, <a href="Flemish%20movement">Flemish movement</a>s evolved to counter this situation.

While the people in Southern Belgium spoke French or dialects of French, and <a href="Frenchification%20of%20Brussels">most Brusselers adopted French</a> as their first language, the Flemings refused to do so and succeeded progressively in making Dutch an equal language in the education system. Following World War II, Belgian politics became increasingly dominated by the autonomy of its two main linguistic communities. Intercommunal tensions rose and the constitution was amended to minimise the potential for conflict.

Based on the four language areas defined in 1962–63 (the Dutch, bilingual, French and German language areas), consecutive <a href="state%20reform%20in%20Belgium">revisions</a> of <a href="Constitution%20of%20Belgium">the country's constitution</a> in 1970, 1980, 1988 and 1993 established a unique form of a federal state with segregated political power into three levels:

The <a href="Language%20legislation%20in%20Belgium">constitutional language areas</a> determine the official languages in their municipalities, as well as the geographical limits of the empowered institutions for specific matters. Although this would allow for seven parliaments and governments, when the Communities and Regions were created in 1980, Flemish politicians decided to merge both. Thus the Flemings just have one single institutional body of parliament and government is empowered for all except federal and specific municipal matters.

The overlapping boundaries of the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities: the territory of the Brussels-Capital Region (which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions) is included in both the Flemish and French Communities, and the territory of the German-speaking Community lies wholly within the Walloon Region. Conflicts about jurisdiction between the bodies are resolved by the <a href="Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Belgium">Constitutional Court of Belgium</a>. The structure is intended as a compromise to allow different cultures to live together peacefully.

The Federal State's authority includes justice, defence, federal police, social security, nuclear energy, monetary policy and public debt, and other aspects of public finances. State-owned companies include the <a href="Belgian%20Post%20Group">Belgian Post Group</a> and <a href="National%20Railway%20Company%20of%20Belgium">Belgian Railways</a>. The Federal Government is responsible for the obligations of Belgium and its federalized institutions towards the European Union and NATO. It controls substantial parts of public health, home affairs and foreign affairs. The budget—without the debt—controlled by the federal government amounts to about 50% of the national fiscal income. The federal government employs around 12% of the civil servants.

Communities exercise their authority only within linguistically determined geographical boundaries, originally oriented towards the individuals of a Community's language: culture (including audiovisual media), education and the use of the relevant language. Extensions to personal matters less directly connected with language comprise health policy (curative and preventive medicine) and assistance to individuals (protection of youth, social welfare, aid to families, <a href="immigrant">immigrant</a> assistance services, and so on.).

Regions have authority in fields that can be broadly associated with their territory. These include economy, employment, agriculture, water policy, housing, public works, energy, transport, the environment, town and country planning, nature conservation, credit and foreign trade. They supervise the provinces, municipalities and intercommunal utility companies.

In several fields, the different levels each have their own say on specifics. With education, for instance, the autonomy of the Communities neither includes decisions about the compulsory aspect nor allows for setting minimum requirements for awarding qualifications, which remain federal matters. Each level of government can be involved in scientific research and international relations associated with its powers. The treaty-making power of the Regions' and Communities' Governments is the broadest of all the Federating units of all the Federations all over the world.

Because of its location at the crossroads of <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a>, Belgium has historically been the route of invading armies from its larger neighbours. With virtually defenceless borders, Belgium has traditionally sought to avoid domination by the more powerful nations which surround it through a policy of mediation. The Belgians have been strong advocates of <a href="European%20integration">European integration</a>. Both the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> and <a href="NATO">NATO</a> are headquartered in Belgium.

The Belgian Armed Forces have about 47,000 active troops. In 2010, Belgium's defence budget totaled €3.95 billion (representing 1.12% of its GDP). They are organized into one unified structure which consists of four main components: <a href="Belgian%20Land%20Component">Land Component</a>, or the Army; <a href="Belgian%20Air%20Component">Air Component</a>, or the Air Force; <a href="Belgian%20Naval%20Component">Naval Component</a>, or the Navy; <a href="Belgian%20Medical%20Component">Medical Component</a>. The operational commands of the four components are subordinate to the Staff Department for Operations and Training of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Belgium%29">Ministry of Defence</a>, which is headed by the <a href="ACOS%20Operations%20and%20Training">Assistant Chief of Staff Operations and Training</a>, and to the <a href="Chief%20of%20Defence%20%28Belgium%29">Chief of Defence</a>.

The effects of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> made <a href="collective%20security">collective security</a> a priority for <a href="Foreign%20relations%20of%20Belgium">Belgian foreign policy</a>. In March 1948 Belgium signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Brussels">Treaty of Brussels</a>, and then joined <a href="NATO">NATO</a> in 1948. However the integration of the armed forces into NATO did not begin until after the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>. The Belgians, along with the Luxembourg government, sent a detachment of battalion strength to fight in Korea known as the <a href="Belgian%20United%20Nations%20Command">Belgian United Nations Command</a>. This mission was the first in a long line of UN missions which the Belgians supported. Currently, the Belgian Naval Component is working closely together with the <a href="Dutch%20Navy">Dutch Navy</a> under the command of the <a href="Admiral%20Benelux">Admiral Benelux</a>.

Belgium's strongly globalized economy and its <a href="transport%20in%20Belgium">transport infrastructure</a> are integrated with the rest of Europe. Its location at the heart of a highly industrialized region helped make it the world's 15th largest trading nation in 2007. The economy is characterized by a highly productive work force, high <a href="Gross%20national%20product">GNP</a> and high exports per capita. Belgium's main imports are raw materials, machinery and equipment, chemicals, raw diamonds, pharmaceuticals, foodstuffs, transportation equipment, and oil products. Its main exports are machinery and equipment, chemicals, finished diamonds, metals and metal products, and foodstuffs.

The Belgian economy is heavily service-oriented and shows a dual nature: a dynamic Flemish economy and a Walloon economy that lags behind. One of the founding members of the European Union, Belgium strongly supports an <a href="open%20economy">open economy</a> and the extension of the powers of EU institutions to integrate member economies. Since 1922, through the <a href="Belgium-Luxembourg%20Economic%20Union">Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union</a>, Belgium and Luxembourg have been a single trade market with customs and currency union.
Belgium was the first continental European country to undergo the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, in the early 19th century. <a href="Li%C3%A8ge%20%28city%29">Liège</a> and <a href="Charleroi">Charleroi</a> rapidly developed mining and steelmaking, which flourished until the mid-20th century in the <a href="Sillon%20industriel">Sambre and Meuse valley</a> and made Belgium among one of the three most industrialized nations in the world from 1830 to 1910. However, by the 1840s the textile industry of Flanders was in severe crisis, and the region experienced <a href="European%20Potato%20Failure">famine</a> from 1846 to 1850.

After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a> and <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> experienced a rapid expansion of the chemical and petroleum industries. The <a href="1973%20oil%20crisis">1973</a> and <a href="1979%20oil%20crisis">1979 oil crises</a> sent the economy into a recession; it was particularly prolonged in Wallonia, where the steel industry had become less competitive and experienced serious decline. In the 1980s and 1990s, the economic centre of the country continued to shift northwards and is now concentrated in the populous <a href="Flemish%20Diamond">Flemish Diamond</a> area.

By the end of the 1980s, Belgian <a href="macroeconomic%20policies">macroeconomic policies</a> had resulted in a cumulative government debt of about 120% of GDP. , the budget was balanced and public debt was equal to 90.30% of GDP. In 2005 and 2006, real GDP growth rates of 1.5% and 3.0%, respectively, were slightly above the average for the Euro area. Unemployment rates of 8.4% in 2005 and 8.2% in 2006 were close to the area average. By , this had grown to 8.5% compared to an average rate of 9.6% for the European Union as a whole (EU 27). From 1832 until 2002, Belgium's currency was the <a href="Belgian%20franc">Belgian franc</a>. Belgium switched to the euro in 2002, with the first sets of euro coins being minted in 1999. The standard <a href="Belgian%20euro%20coins">Belgian euro coins</a> designated for circulation show the portrait of the monarch (first King Albert II, since 2013 King Philippe).

Despite an 18% decrease observed from 1970 to 1999, Belgium still had in 1999 the highest <a href="Rail%20transport%20in%20Belgium">rail network</a> density within the European Union with 113.8 km/1 000 km. On the other hand, the same period of time, 1970–1999, has seen a huge growth (+56%) of the <a href="List%20of%20motorways%20in%20Belgium">motorway network</a>. In 1999, the density of km motorways per 1000 km and 1000 inhabitants amounted to 55.1 and 16.5 respectively and were significantly superior to the EU's means of 13.7 and 15.9.

Belgium experiences some of the most congested traffic in Europe. In 2010, commuters to the cities of Brussels and Antwerp spent respectively 65 and 64 hours a year in traffic jams. Like in most small European countries, more than 80% of the airways traffic is handled by a single airport, the <a href="Brussels%20Airport">Brussels Airport</a>. The <a href="port%20of%20Antwerp">ports of Antwerp</a> and <a href="port%20of%20Zeebrugge">Zeebrugge (Bruges)</a> share more than 80% of Belgian maritime traffic, Antwerp being the second European harbour with a gross weight of goods handled of 115 988 000 t in 2000 after a growth of 10.9% over the preceding five years. In 2016, the port of Antwerp handled 214 million tons after a year-on-year growth of 2.7%.

There is a large economic gap between <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> and <a href="Wallonia">Wallonia</a>. Wallonia was historically wealthy compared to Flanders, mostly due to its <a href="heavy%20industry">heavy industries</a>, but the decline of the steel industry post-World War II led to the region's rapid decline, whereas Flanders rose swiftly. Since then, Flanders has been prosperous, among the wealthiest regions in Europe, whereas Wallonia has been languishing. As of 2007, the unemployment rate of Wallonia is over double that of Flanders. The divide has played a key part in the tensions between the Flemish and Walloons in addition to the already-existing language divide. <a href="Flemish%20Movement">Pro-independence movements</a> have gained high popularity in Flanders as a consequence. The separatist <a href="New%20Flemish%20Alliance">New Flemish Alliance</a> (N-VA) party for instance is the largest party in Flanders.

Contributions to the development of science and technology have appeared throughout the country's history. The 16th century <a href="Early%20Modern">Early Modern</a> flourishing of Western Europe included <a href="cartography">cartographer</a> <a href="Gerardus%20Mercator">Gerardus Mercator</a>, <a href="anatomy">anatomist</a> <a href="Andreas%20Vesalius">Andreas Vesalius</a>, <a href="herbalist">herbalist</a> <a href="Rembert%20Dodoens">Rembert Dodoens</a> and <a href="mathematics">mathematician</a> <a href="Simon%20Stevin">Simon Stevin</a> among the most influential scientists.

Chemist <a href="Ernest%20Solvay">Ernest Solvay</a> and engineer <a href="Zenobe%20Gramme">Zenobe Gramme</a> (École Industrielle de Liège) gave their names to the <a href="Solvay%20process">Solvay process</a> and the <a href="Gramme%20dynamo">Gramme dynamo</a>, respectively, in the 1860s. <a href="Bakelite">Bakelite</a> was developed in 1907–1909 by <a href="Leo%20Baekeland">Leo Baekeland</a>. Ernest Solvay also acted as a major philanthropist and gave its name to the <a href="Solvay%20Institute%20of%20Sociology">Solvay Institute of Sociology</a>, the <a href="Solvay%20Brussels%20School%20of%20Economics%20and%20Management">Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management</a> and the International Solvay Institutes for Physics and Chemistry which are now part of the <a href="Universit%C3%A9%20libre%20de%20Bruxelles">Université libre de Bruxelles</a>. In 1911, he started a series of conferences, the <a href="Solvay%20Conference">Solvay Conference</a>s on Physics and Chemistry, which have had a deep impact on the evolution of quantum physics and chemistry. A major contribution to fundamental science was also due to a Belgian, <a href="Monsignor">Monsignor</a> <a href="Georges%20Lema%C3%AEtre">Georges Lemaître</a> (<a href="Catholic%20University%20of%20Leuven%20%281834%E2%80%931968%29">Catholic University of Leuven</a>), who is credited with proposing the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a> theory of the origin of the universe in 1927.

Three <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine</a> were awarded to Belgians: <a href="Jules%20Bordet">Jules Bordet</a> (Université libre de Bruxelles) in 1919, <a href="Corneille%20Heymans">Corneille Heymans</a> (<a href="University%20of%20Ghent">University of Ghent</a>) in 1938 and <a href="Albert%20Claude">Albert Claude</a> (Université Libre de Bruxelles) together with <a href="Christian%20de%20Duve">Christian de Duve</a> (Université Catholique de Louvain) in 1974. <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Englert">François Englert</a> (Université Libre de Bruxelles) was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> in 2013. <a href="Ilya%20Prigogine">Ilya Prigogine</a> (Université Libre de Bruxelles) was awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Chemistry">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a> in 1977. Two Belgian mathematicians have been awarded the <a href="Fields%20Medal">Fields Medal</a>: <a href="Pierre%20Deligne">Pierre Deligne</a> in 1978 and <a href="Jean%20Bourgain">Jean Bourgain</a> in 1994.

, the total population of Belgium according to its population register was 11,190,845. Almost all of the population is urban, at 97% in 2004. The population density of Belgium is 365 per square kilometre (952 per square mile) as of March 2013. The most densely inhabited area is Flanders. The Ardennes have the lowest density. , the Flemish Region had a population of 6,437,680, its most populous cities being <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> (511,771), Ghent (252,274) and <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> (117,787). Wallonia had 3,585,214 with <a href="Charleroi">Charleroi</a> (202,021), <a href="Li%C3%A8ge">Liège</a> (194,937) and <a href="Namur%20%28city%29">Namur</a> (110,447), its most populous cities. <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> has 1,167,951 inhabitants in the Capital Region's <a href="List%20of%20municipalities%20of%20the%20Brussels-Capital%20Region">19 municipalities</a>, three of which have over 100,000 residents.

, nearly 92% of the population had Belgian citizenship, and other European Union member citizens account for around 6%. The prevalent foreign nationals were Italian (171,918), French (125,061), Dutch (116,970), <a href="Morocco">Moroccan</a> (80,579), <a href="Portuguese%20people">Portuguese</a> (43,509), Spanish (42,765), <a href="Turkish%20people">Turkish</a> (39,419) and German (37,621). In 2007, there were 1.38 million foreign-born residents in Belgium, corresponding to 12.9% of the total population. Of these, 685,000 (6.4%) were born outside the EU and 695,000 (6.5%) were born in another EU Member State.

At the beginning of 2012, people of foreign background and their descendants were estimated to have formed around 25% of the total population i.e. 2.8 million "new Belgians". Of these new Belgians, 1,200,000 are of European ancestry and 1,350,000 are from non-Western countries (most of them from <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, and the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">DR Congo</a>). Since the modification of the <a href="Belgian%20nationality%20law">Belgian nationality law</a> in 1984 more than <a href="Demographics%20of%20Belgium">1.3 million migrants have acquired Belgian citizenship</a>. The largest group of immigrants and their descendants in Belgium are <a href="Moroccan%20people">Moroccans</a>. 89.2% of inhabitants of <a href="Turkish%20people">Turkish</a> origin have been naturalized, as have 88.4% of people of Moroccan background, 75.4% of Italians, 56.2% of the French and 47.8% of Dutch people.

Belgium has three official languages: Dutch, French and German. A number of non-official minority languages are spoken as well.
As no census exists, there are no official statistical data regarding the distribution or usage of Belgium's three official languages or their <a href="dialect">dialect</a>s. However, various criteria, including the language(s) of parents, of education, or the second-language status of foreign born, may provide suggested figures. An estimated 60% of the Belgian population speaks Dutch (often referred to as Flemish), and 40% of the population speaks French. French-speaking Belgians are often referred to as Walloons, although the French speakers in Brussels are not Walloons.

Total Dutch speakers are 6.23 million, concentrated in the northern Flanders region, while French speakers number 3.32 million in Wallonia and an estimated 870,000 (or 85%) in the officially bilingual Brussels-Capital Region. The <a href="German-speaking%20Community%20of%20Belgium">German-speaking Community</a> is made up of 73,000 people in the east of the <a href="Wallonia">Walloon Region</a>; around 10,000 German and 60,000 Belgian nationals are speakers of German. Roughly 23,000 more German speakers live in municipalities near the official Community.

Both <a href="Belgian%20Dutch">Belgian Dutch</a> and <a href="Belgian%20French">Belgian French</a> have minor differences in vocabulary and semantic nuances from the varieties spoken respectively in the Netherlands and France. Many Flemish people still speak <a href="Dutch%20dialects">dialects of Dutch</a> in their local environment. <a href="Walloon%20language">Walloon</a>, considered either as a dialect of French or a distinct <a href="Romance%20language">Romance language</a>, is now only understood and spoken occasionally, mostly by elderly people. Walloon is the name collectively given to four French dialects spoken in Belgium. Wallonia's dialects, along with those of <a href="Picard%20language">Picard</a>, are not used in public life and have been replaced by French.

Since the country's independence, <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>, counterbalanced by strong <a href="freethought">freethought</a> movements, has had an important role in Belgium's politics. However Belgium is largely a secular country as the "<a href="laicite">laicist</a>" <a href="Constitution%20of%20Belgium">constitution</a> provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice. During the reigns of <a href="Albert%20I%20of%20Belgium">Albert I</a> and <a href="Baudouin%20I%20of%20Belgium">Baudouin</a>, the monarchy had a reputation of deeply rooted Catholicism.

Roman Catholicism has traditionally been Belgium's majority religion; being especially strong in Flanders. However, by 2009 Sunday <a href="church%20attendance">church attendance</a> was 5% for Belgium in total; 3% in Brussels, and 5.4% in Flanders. Church attendance in 2009 in Belgium was roughly half of the Sunday church attendance in 1998 (11% for the total of Belgium in 1998). Despite the drop in church attendance, Catholic identity nevertheless remains an important part of Belgium's culture.

According to the most recent <a href="Eurobarometer">Eurobarometer Poll</a> 2010, 37% of Belgian citizens responded that they believe there is a God. 31% answered that they believe there is some sort of spirit or life-force. 27% answered that they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life-force. 5% did not respond.

According to new polls about religiosity in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> in 2012 by <a href="Eurobarometer">Eurobarometer</a> found that <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> is the largest religion in Belgium accounting 65% of <a href="Belgians">Belgians</a>. <a href="Catholics">Catholics</a> are the largest <a href="Christian">Christian</a> group in Belgium, accounting for 58% of Belgium citizens, while <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a>s make up 2%, and Other Christian make up 5%. <a href="Agnostic">Non believer/agnostic</a>s account for 20%, <a href="atheist">atheist</a>s 7%, and <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a>s 5%.

Symbolically and materially, the Roman Catholic Church remains in a favourable position. Belgium has three officially recognized religions: Christianity (Catholic, Protestantism, <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodoxy</a> and Anglicanism), Islam and Judaism.

In the early 2000s there were approximately 42,000 Jews in Belgium. The <a href="Jewish%20Community%20of%20Antwerp">Jewish Community of Antwerp</a> (numbering some 18,000) is one of the largest in Europe, and one of the last places in the world where <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a> is the primary language of a large Jewish community (mirroring certain Orthodox and Hasidic communities in New York, New Jersey, and Israel). In addition most Jewish children in Antwerp receive a Jewish education. There are several Jewish newspapers and more than 45 active synagogues (30 of which are in Antwerp) in the country.

A 2006 inquiry in Flanders, considered to be a more religious region than Wallonia, showed that 55% considered themselves religious and that 36% believed that God created the universe. On the other hand, Wallonia has become one of Europe's most secular/least religious regions. Most of the French-speaking region's population does not consider religion an important part of their lives, and as much as 45% of the population identifies as irreligious. This is particularly the case in eastern Wallonia and areas along the French border.

A 2008 estimate found that approximately 6% of the Belgian population (628,751 people) is <a href="Islam%20in%20Belgium">Muslim</a>. Muslims constitute 23.6% of the population of <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, 4.9% of <a href="Wallonia">Wallonia</a> and 5.1% of <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>. The majority of Belgian Muslims live in the major cities, such as <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, Brussels and <a href="Charleroi">Charleroi</a>. The largest group of immigrants in Belgium are Moroccans, with 400,000 people. The Turks are the third largest group, and the second largest Muslim ethnic group, numbering 220,000.

The Belgians enjoy good health. According to 2012 estimates, the average life expectancy is 79.65 years. Since 1960, life expectancy has, in line with the European average, grown by two months per year. Death in Belgium is mainly due to heart and vascular disorders, <a href="neoplasm">neoplasm</a>s, disorders of the respiratory system and unnatural causes of death (accidents, suicide). Non-natural causes of death and cancer are the most common causes of death for females up to age 24 and males up to age 44.

<a href="Healthcare%20in%20Belgium">Healthcare in Belgium</a> is financed through both social security contributions and taxation. Health insurance is compulsory. Health care is delivered by a mixed public and private system of independent medical practitioners and public, university and semi-private hospitals. Health care service are payable by the patient and reimbursed later by health insurance institutions, but for ineligible categories (of patients and services) so-called 3rd party payment systems exist. The Belgian health care system is supervised and financed by the federal government, the Flemish and Walloon Regional governments; and the German Community also has (indirect) oversight and responsibilities.

For the first time in Belgium history, the first child was euthanized following the 2 year mark of the removal of the euthanization age restrictions. The child had been euthanized due to an incurable disease that was inflicted upon the child. Although there may have been some support for the euthanization there is a possibility of controversy due to the issue revolving around the subject of assisted suicide.

Education is compulsory from 6 to 18 years of age for Belgians. Among <a href="Organisation%20for%20Economic%20Co-operation%20and%20Development">OECD</a> countries in 2002, Belgium had the third highest proportion of 18- to 21-year-olds enrolled in <a href="postsecondary%20education">postsecondary education</a>, at 42%. Though an estimated 99% of the adult population is literate, concern is rising over <a href="functional%20illiteracy">functional illiteracy</a>. The <a href="Programme%20for%20International%20Student%20Assessment">Programme for International Student Assessment</a> (PISA), coordinated by the OECD, currently ranks Belgium's education as the 19th best in the world, being significantly higher than the OECD average. Education being organized separately by each, the Flemish Community scores noticeably above the French and German-speaking Communities.

Mirroring the dual structure of the 19th-century Belgian political landscape, characterized by the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28Belgium%29">Liberal</a> and the <a href="Catholic%20Party%20%28Belgium%29">Catholic parties</a>, the educational system is segregated within a secular and a religious segment. The secular branch of schooling is controlled by the communities, the provinces, or the municipalities, while religious, mainly <a href="Catholic%20school">Catholic branch</a> education, is organized by religious authorities, although subsidized and supervised by the communities.

Despite its <a href="partition%20of%20Belgium">political and linguistic divisions</a>, the region corresponding to today's Belgium has seen the flourishing of major artistic movements that have had tremendous influence on European art and culture. Nowadays, to a certain extent, cultural life is concentrated within each language Community, and a variety of barriers have made a shared cultural sphere less pronounced. Since the 1970s, there are no bilingual universities or colleges in the country except the <a href="Royal%20Military%20Academy%20%28Belgium%29">Royal Military Academy</a> and the <a href="Antwerp%20Maritime%20Academy">Antwerp Maritime Academy</a>, no common media and no single large cultural or scientific organization in which both main communities are represented.

Contributions to painting and architecture have been especially rich. The <a href="Mosan%20art">Mosan art</a>, the <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">Early Netherlandish</a>, the <a href="Dutch%20and%20Flemish%20Renaissance%20painting">Flemish Renaissance</a> and <a href="Flemish%20Baroque%20painting">Baroque painting</a> and major examples of <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a>, <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a>, <a href="Renaissance%20architecture">Renaissance</a> and <a href="Baroque%20architecture">Baroque architecture</a> are milestones in the history of art. While the 15th century's art in the Low Countries is dominated by the religious paintings of <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a> and <a href="Rogier%20van%20der%20Weyden">Rogier van der Weyden</a>, the 16th century is characterized by a broader panel of styles such as <a href="Pieter%20Brueghel%20the%20Elder">Peter Breughel</a>'s landscape paintings and <a href="Lambert%20Lombard">Lambert Lombard</a>'s representation of the antique. Though the Baroque style of <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a> and <a href="Anthony%20van%20Dyck">Anthony van Dyck</a> flourished in the early 17th century in the Southern Netherlands, it gradually declined thereafter.

During the 19th and 20th centuries many original <a href="romanticism">romantic</a>, <a href="expressionism">expressionist</a> and <a href="surrealism">surrealist</a> Belgian painters emerged, including <a href="James%20Ensor">James Ensor</a> and other artists belonging to the <a href="Les%20XX">Les XX</a> group, <a href="Constant%20Permeke">Constant Permeke</a>, <a href="Paul%20Delvaux">Paul Delvaux</a> and <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Magritte">René Magritte</a>. The avant-garde <a href="COBRA%20%28avant-garde%20movement%29">CoBrA movement</a> appeared in the 1950s, while the sculptor <a href="Panamarenko">Panamarenko</a> remains a remarkable figure in contemporary art. Multidisciplinary artists <a href="Jan%20Fabre">Jan Fabre</a>, <a href="Wim%20Delvoye">Wim Delvoye</a> and the painters Guy Huygens and <a href="Luc%20Tuymans">Luc Tuymans</a> are other internationally renowned figures on the contemporary art scene.

Belgian contributions to architecture also continued into the 19th and 20th centuries, including the work of <a href="Victor%20Horta">Victor Horta</a> and <a href="Henry%20van%20de%20Velde">Henry van de Velde</a>, who were major initiators of the <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> style.
The <a href="vocal%20music">vocal music</a> of the <a href="Franco-Flemish%20School">Franco-Flemish School</a> developed in the southern part of the Low Countries and was an important contribution to Renaissance culture. In the 19th and 20th centuries, there was an emergence of major violinists, such as <a href="Henri%20Vieuxtemps">Henri Vieuxtemps</a>, <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Ysa%C3%BFe">Eugène Ysaÿe</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Grumiaux">Arthur Grumiaux</a>, while <a href="Adolphe%20Sax">Adolphe Sax</a> invented the saxophone in 1846. The composer <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Franck">César Franck</a> was born in Liège in 1822. Contemporary <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> in Belgium is also of repute. Jazz musician <a href="Toots%20Thielemans">Toots Thielemans</a> and singer <a href="Jacques%20Brel">Jacques Brel</a> have achieved global fame. Nowadays, singer <a href="Stromae">Stromae</a> has been a musical revelation in Europe and beyond, having great success.

Blues

Blues is a <a href="music%20genre">music genre</a> and <a href="musical%20form">musical form</a> originated by <a href="African%20American">African American</a>s in the <a href="Deep%20South">Deep South</a> of the United States around the end of the 19th century. The genre developed from roots in <a href="Music%20of%20Africa">African musical traditions</a>, <a href="Work%20song%23African-American%20work%20songs">African-American work songs</a>,
<a href="Spiritual%20%28music%29">spirituals</a>, and European <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a>. Blues incorporated <a href="spiritual%20%28music%29">spirituals</a>, <a href="work%20song">work song</a>s, <a href="field%20holler">field holler</a>s, <a href="Ring%20shout">shouts</a>, <a href="chant">chant</a>s, and rhymed simple narrative <a href="ballad%20%28music%29">ballads</a>. The blues form, ubiquitous in <a href="jazz">jazz</a>, <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a> and <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a>, is characterized by the <a href="Call%20and%20response%20%28music%29">call-and-response</a> pattern, the <a href="blues%20scale">blues scale</a> and specific <a href="chord%20progression">chord progression</a>s, of which the <a href="twelve-bar%20blues">twelve-bar blues</a> is the most common. <a href="Blue%20note">Blue note</a>s (or "worried notes"), usually thirds or fifths flattened in <a href="Pitch%20%28music%29">pitch</a>, are also an essential part of the sound. Blues <a href="shuffle%20note">shuffles</a> or <a href="walking%20bass">walking bass</a> reinforce the trance-like rhythm and form a repetitive effect known as the <a href="groove%20%28popular%20music%29">groove</a>.

Blues as a genre is also characterized by its lyrics, bass lines, and instrumentation. Early <a href="traditional%20blues%20verse">traditional blues verse</a>s consisted of a single line repeated four times. It was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard: the <a href="Bar%20form">AAB pattern</a>, consisting of a line sung over the four first bars, its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars. Early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative, often relating the racial discrimination and other challenges experienced by African-Americans.

Many elements, such as the call-and-response format and the use of blue notes, can be traced back to the <a href="music%20of%20Africa">music of Africa</a>. The origins of the blues are also closely related to the religious music of the Afro-American community, the <a href="spiritual%20%28music%29">spirituals</a>. The first appearance of the blues is often dated to after the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">ending of slavery</a> and, later, the development of <a href="juke%20joint">juke joint</a>s. It is associated with the newly acquired freedom of the former slaves. Chroniclers began to report about blues music at the dawn of the <a href="20th%20century">20th century</a>. The first publication of blues sheet music was in 1908. Blues has since evolved from unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of slaves into a wide variety of styles and subgenres. Blues <a href="List%20of%20blues%20genres">subgenres</a> include <a href="country%20blues">country blues</a>, such as <a href="Delta%20blues">Delta blues</a> and <a href="Piedmont%20blues">Piedmont blues</a>, as well as urban blues styles such as <a href="Chicago%20blues">Chicago blues</a> and <a href="West%20Coast%20blues">West Coast blues</a>. <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> marked the transition from acoustic to <a href="electric%20blues">electric blues</a> and the progressive opening of blues music to a wider audience, especially white listeners. In the 1960s and 1970s, a hybrid form called <a href="blues%20rock">blues rock</a> developed, which blended blues styles with <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a>.

The term "blues" may have come from "blue devils", meaning melancholy and sadness; an early use of the term in this sense is in <a href="George%20Colman%20the%20Younger">George Colman</a>'s one-act farce "Blue Devils" (1798). The phrase "blue devils" may also have been derived from Britain in the 1600s, when the term referred to the "intense visual hallucinations that can accompany severe alcohol withdrawal". As time went on, the phrase lost the reference to devils, and "it came to mean a state of agitation or depression." By the 1800s in the United States, the term "blues" was associated with drinking alcohol, a meaning which survives in the phrase "<a href="blue%20law">blue law</a>", which prohibits the sale of alcohol on Sunday. Though the use of the phrase in <a href="African-American%20music">African-American music</a> may be older, it has been attested to in print since 1912, when <a href="Hart%20Wand">Hart Wand</a>'s "<a href="Dallas%20Blues">Dallas Blues</a>" became the first copyrighted blues composition. In lyrics the phrase is often used to describe a <a href="Depression%20%28mood%29">depressed mood</a>. Some sources state that the term "blues" is related to "<a href="blue%20note">blue note</a>s", the flatted, often microtonal notes used in blues, but the "Oxford English Dictionary" claims that the term "blues" came first and led to the naming of "blue notes".

The lyrics of early <a href="traditional%20blues%20verse">traditional blues verse</a>s probably often consisted of a single line repeated four times. It was only in the first decades of the 20th century that the most common current structure became standard: the so-called AAB pattern, consisting of a line sung over the four first bars, its repetition over the next four, and then a longer concluding line over the last bars. Two of the first published blues songs, "<a href="Dallas%20Blues">Dallas Blues</a>" (1912) and "<a href="Saint%20Louis%20Blues%20%28song%29">Saint Louis Blues</a>" (1914), were 12-bar blues with the AAB lyric structure. <a href="W.%20C.%20Handy">W. C. Handy</a> wrote that he adopted this convention to avoid the monotony of lines repeated three times. The lines are often sung following a pattern closer to <a href="talking%20blues">rhythmic talk</a> than to a melody.

Early blues frequently took the form of a loose narrative. African-American singers voiced his or her "personal woes in a world of harsh reality: a lost love, the cruelty of police officers, oppression at the hands of white folk, [and] hard times". This melancholy has led to the suggestion of an <a href="Igbo%20music">Igbo</a> origin for blues because of the reputation the <a href="Igbo%20American">Igbo</a> had throughout plantations in the Americas for their melancholic music and outlook on life when they were enslaved.

The lyrics often relate troubles experienced within African American society. For instance <a href="Blind%20Lemon%20Jefferson">Blind Lemon Jefferson</a>'s "Rising High Water Blues" (1927) tells of the <a href="Great%20Mississippi%20Flood%20of%201927">Great Mississippi Flood of 1927</a>:

Although the blues gained an association with misery and oppression, the lyrics could also be humorous and raunchy:

<a href="Hokum">Hokum</a> blues celebrated both comedic lyrical content and a boisterous, <a href="farcical">farcical</a> performance style. <a href="Tampa%20Red">Tampa Red</a>'s classic "Tight Like That" (1928) is a sly wordplay with the double meaning of being "tight" with someone coupled with a more salacious physical familiarity. Blues songs with sexually explicit lyrics were known as <a href="dirty%20blues">dirty blues</a>. The lyrical content became slightly simpler in postwar blues, which tended to focus on relationship woes or sexual worries. Lyrical themes that frequently appeared in prewar blues, such as economic depression, farming, devils, gambling, magic, floods and drought, were less common in postwar blues.

The writer Ed Morales claimed that <a href="Yoruba%20mythology">Yoruba mythology</a> played a part in early blues, citing <a href="Robert%20Johnson">Robert Johnson</a>'s "<a href="Cross%20Road%20Blues">Cross Road Blues</a>" as a "thinly veiled reference to <a href="Eleggua">Eleggua</a>, the <a href="orisha">orisha</a> in charge of the crossroads". However, the Christian influence was far more obvious. The repertoires of many seminal blues artists, such as <a href="Charley%20Patton">Charley Patton</a> and <a href="Skip%20James">Skip James</a>, included religious songs or spirituals. <a href="Reverend%20Gary%20Davis">Reverend Gary Davis</a> and <a href="Blind%20Willie%20Johnson">Blind Willie Johnson</a> are examples of artists often categorized as blues musicians for their music, although their lyrics clearly belong to spirituals.

The blues form is a <a href="cyclic%20form">cyclic musical form</a> in which a repeating <a href="chord%20progression">progression of chords</a> mirrors the <a href="call%20and%20response%20%28music%29">call and response</a> scheme commonly found in African and African-American music. During the first decades of the 20th century blues music was not clearly defined in terms of a particular chord progression. With the popularity of early performers, such as <a href="Bessie%20Smith">Bessie Smith</a>, use of the <a href="twelve-bar%20blues">twelve-bar blues</a> spread across the music industry during the 1920s and 30s. Other chord progressions, such as <a href="8-bar%20blues">8-bar</a> forms, are still considered blues; examples include "<a href="How%20Long%2C%20How%20Long%20Blues">How Long Blues</a>", "<a href="Trouble%20in%20Mind%20%28song%29">Trouble in Mind</a>", and <a href="Big%20Bill%20Broonzy">Big Bill Broonzy</a>'s "<a href="Key%20to%20the%20Highway">Key to the Highway</a>". There are also <a href="16-bar%20blues">16-bar blues</a>, such as <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a>'s instrumental "Sweet 16 Bars" and <a href="Herbie%20Hancock">Herbie Hancock</a>'s "<a href="Watermelon%20Man%20%28composition%29">Watermelon Man</a>". Idiosyncratic numbers of bars are occasionally used, such as the 9-bar progression in "<a href="Sitting%20on%20Top%20of%20the%20World">Sitting on Top of the World</a>", by <a href="Walter%20Vinson">Walter Vinson</a>.

The basic 12-bar lyric framework of a blues composition is reflected by a standard harmonic progression of 12 bars in a <a href="Time%20signature">4/4 time signature</a>. The blues <a href="Chord%20%28music%29">chords</a> associated to a <a href="twelve-bar%20blues">twelve-bar blues</a> are typically a set of three different chords played over a 12-bar scheme. They are labeled by <a href="Roman%20number">Roman number</a>s referring to the <a href="degree%20%28music%29">degrees</a> of the progression. For instance, for a blues in the <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a> of C, C is the <a href="tonic%20chord">tonic chord</a> (I) and F is the <a href="subdominant%20chord">subdominant</a> (IV).

The last chord is the <a href="dominant%20chord">dominant</a> (V) <a href="turnaround%20%28music%29">turnaround</a>, marking the transition to the beginning of the next progression. The lyrics generally end on the last beat of the tenth bar or the first beat of the 11th bar, and the final two bars are given to the instrumentalist as a break; the harmony of this two-bar break, the turnaround, can be extremely complex, sometimes consisting of single notes that defy analysis in terms of chords.

Much of the time, some or all of these chords are played in the <a href="harmonic%20seventh">harmonic seventh</a> (7th) form. The use of the harmonic seventh interval is characteristic of blues and is popularly called the "blues seven". Blues seven chords add to the harmonic chord a note with a frequency in a 7:4 ratio to the fundamental note. At a 7:4 ratio, it is not close to any interval on the conventional Western <a href="diatonic%20scale">diatonic scale</a>. For convenience or by necessity it is often approximated by a <a href="minor%20seventh">minor seventh</a> interval or a <a href="dominant%20seventh%20chord">dominant seventh chord</a>.

In <a href="melody">melody</a>, blues is distinguished by the use of the <a href="Flat%20%28music%29">flattened</a> <a href="minor%20third">third</a>, <a href="tritone">fifth</a> and <a href="minor%20seventh">seventh</a> of the associated <a href="major%20scale">major scale</a>. These specialized notes are called the <a href="blue%20note">"blue" or "bent notes"</a>. These scale tones may replace the natural scale tones, or they may be added to the scale, as in the case of the minor blues scale, in which the flattened third replaces the natural third, the flattened seventh replaces the natural seventh and the flattened fifth is added between the natural fourth and natural fifth. While the 12-bar harmonic progression had been intermittently used for centuries, the revolutionary aspect of blues was the frequent use of the flattened third, flattened seventh, and even flattened fifth in the melody, together with "crushing"—playing directly adjacent notes at the same time (i.e., minor second)—and "sliding", similar to using <a href="grace%20note">grace note</a>s. The blue notes allow for key moments of expression during the cadences, melodies, and embellishments of the blues.

Blues <a href="shuffle%20note">shuffles</a> or <a href="walking%20bass">walking bass</a> reinforce the trance-like rhythm and call-and-response, and they form a repetitive effect called a <a href="groove%20%28popular%20music%29">groove</a>. Characteristic of the blues since its Afro-American origins, the shuffles played a central role in <a href="swing%20music">swing music</a>. The simplest shuffles, which were the clearest signature of the R&B wave that started in the mid-1940s, were a three-note <a href="riff">riff</a> on the bass strings of the guitar. When this riff was played over the bass and the drums, the groove "feel" was created. Shuffle rhythm is often vocalized as ""dow", da "dow", da "dow", da" or ""dump", da "dump", da "dump", da": it consists of uneven, or "swung", eighth notes. On a guitar this may be played as a simple steady bass or it may add to that stepwise quarter note motion from the fifth to the sixth of the chord and back.

The first publication of blues sheet music was in 1908: Antonio Maggio's "I Got the Blues" is the first published song to use the word blues. <a href="Hart%20Wand">Hart Wand</a>'s "<a href="Dallas%20Blues">Dallas Blues</a>" followed in 1912; <a href="W.%20C.%20Handy">W. C. Handy</a>'s "<a href="The%20Memphis%20Blues">The Memphis Blues</a>" followed in the same year. The first recording by an African American singer was <a href="Mamie%20Smith">Mamie Smith</a>'s 1920 rendition of <a href="Perry%20Bradford">Perry Bradford</a>'s "Crazy Blues". But the origins of the blues were some decades earlier, probably around 1890. This music is poorly documented, partly because of racial discrimination in U.S. society, including academic circles, and partly because of the low rate of literacy among rural African Americans at the time.

Reports of blues music in <a href="southern%20Texas">southern Texas</a> and the <a href="Deep%20South">Deep South</a> were written at the dawn of the 20th century. Charles Peabody mentioned the appearance of blues music at <a href="Clarksdale%2C%20Mississippi">Clarksdale, Mississippi</a>, and Gate Thomas reported similar songs in southern Texas around 1901–1902. These observations coincide more or less with the recollections of <a href="Jelly%20Roll%20Morton">Jelly Roll Morton</a>, who said he first heard blues music in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> in 1902; <a href="Ma%20Rainey">Ma Rainey</a>, who remembered first hearing the blues in the same year in <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>; and <a href="W.C.%20Handy">W.C. Handy</a>, who first heard the blues in <a href="Tutwiler%2C%20Mississippi">Tutwiler, Mississippi</a>, in 1903. The first extensive research in the field was performed by <a href="Howard%20W.%20Odum">Howard W. Odum</a>, who published an anthology of folk songs from <a href="Lafayette%20County%2C%20Mississippi">Lafayette County, Mississippi</a>, and <a href="Newton%20County%2C%20Georgia">Newton County, Georgia</a>, between 1905 and 1908. The first noncommercial recordings of blues music, termed "proto-blues" by <a href="Paul%20Oliver">Paul Oliver</a>, were made by Odum for research purposes at the very beginning of the 20th century. They are now lost.

Other recordings that are still available were made in 1924 by <a href="Lawrence%20Gellert">Lawrence Gellert</a>. Later, several recordings were made by <a href="Robert%20Winslow%20Gordon">Robert W. Gordon</a>, who became head of the <a href="Archive%20of%20Folk%20Culture">Archive of American Folk Songs</a> of the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>. Gordon's successor at the library was <a href="John%20Lomax">John Lomax</a>. In the 1930s, Lomax and his son <a href="Alan%20Lomax">Alan</a> made a large number of non-commercial blues recordings that testify to the huge variety of proto-blues styles, such as <a href="field%20holler">field holler</a>s and <a href="ring%20shout">ring shout</a>s. A record of blues music as it existed before 1920 can also be found in the recordings of artists such as <a href="Lead%20Belly">Lead Belly</a> and <a href="Henry%20Thomas%20%28blues%20musician%29">Henry Thomas</a>. All these sources show the existence of many different structures distinct from <a href="12%20bar%20blues">twelve-</a>, <a href="eight-bar%20blues">eight-</a>, or <a href="16%20bar%20blues">sixteen-bar</a>.

The social and economic reasons for the appearance of the blues are not fully known. The first appearance of the blues is usually dated after the <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Act of 1863</a>, between 1870 and 1900, a period that coincides with post-<a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">emancipation</a> and later, the establishment of <a href="juke%20joint">juke joint</a>s as places where blacks went to listen to music, dance, or gamble after a hard day's work. This period corresponds to the transition from slavery to sharecropping, small-scale agricultural production, and the expansion of railroads in the southern United States. Several scholars characterize the development of blues music in the early 1900s as a move from group performance to individualized performance. They argue that the development of the blues is associated with the newly acquired freedom of the enslaved people.

According to Lawrence Levine, "there was a direct relationship between the national ideological emphasis upon the individual, the popularity of Booker T. Washington's teachings, and the rise of the blues." Levine stated that "psychologically, socially, and economically, African-Americans were being acculturated in a way that would have been impossible during slavery, and it is hardly surprising that their secular music reflected this as much as their religious music did."

There are few characteristics common to all blues music, because the genre took its shape from the idiosyncrasies of individual performers. However, there are some characteristics that were present long before the creation of the modern blues. Call-and-response shouts were an early form of blues-like music; they were a "functional expression ... style without accompaniment or harmony and unbounded by the formality of any particular musical structure". A form of this pre-blues was heard in slave <a href="ring%20shout">ring shout</a>s and <a href="field%20holler">field holler</a>s, expanded into "simple solo songs laden with emotional content".

Blues has evolved from the unaccompanied vocal music and oral traditions of slaves imported from West Africa and rural blacks into a wide variety of styles and subgenres, with regional variations across the United States. Although blues (as it is now known) can be seen as a musical style based on both European <a href="harmony">harmonic structure</a> and the African call-and-response tradition that transformed into an interplay of voice and guitar, the blues form itself bears no resemblance to the melodic styles of the West African <a href="griot">griot</a>s, and the influences are faint and tenuous. Additionally, there are theories that the four-beats-per-measure structure of the blues might have its origins in the Native American tradition of <a href="pow%20wow">pow wow</a> drumming.

No specific African musical form can be identified as the single direct ancestor of the blues. However the call-and-response format can be traced back to the <a href="music%20of%20Africa">music of Africa</a>. That blue notes predate their use in blues and have an African origin is attested to by "A Negro Love Song", by the English composer <a href="Samuel%20Coleridge-Taylor">Samuel Coleridge-Taylor</a>, from his "African Suite for Piano", written in 1898, which contains <a href="minor%20third">blue third</a> and <a href="seventh%20chord">seventh notes</a>.

The <a href="Diddley%20bow">Diddley bow</a> (a homemade one-stringed instrument found in parts of the <a href="American%20South">American South</a> in the early twentieth century) and the <a href="banjo">banjo</a> are African-derived instruments that may have helped in the transfer of African performance techniques into the early blues instrumental vocabulary. The banjo seems to be directly imported from West African music. It is similar to the musical instrument that griots and other Africans such as the <a href="Igbo%20people">Igbo</a> played (called <a href="Xalam">halam</a> or <a href="akonting">akonting</a> by African peoples such as the <a href="Wolof%20people">Wolof</a>, <a href="Fula%20people">Fula</a> and <a href="Mandinka%20people">Mandinka</a>). However, in the 1920s, when country blues began to be recorded, the use of the banjo in blues music was quite marginal and limited to individuals such as <a href="Papa%20Charlie%20Jackson">Papa Charlie Jackson</a> and later <a href="Gus%20Cannon">Gus Cannon</a>.

Blues music also adopted elements from the "Ethiopian airs", <a href="minstrel%20show">minstrel show</a>s and <a href="Negro%20spiritual">Negro spiritual</a>s, including instrumental and harmonic accompaniment. The style also was closely related to <a href="ragtime">ragtime</a>, which developed at about the same time, though the blues better preserved "the original melodic patterns of African music".
The musical forms and styles that are now considered the blues as well as modern <a href="country%20music">country music</a> arose in the same regions of the southern United States during the 19th century. Recorded blues and country music can be found as far back as the 1920s, when the record industry created the marketing categories "<a href="race%20music">race music</a>" and "<a href="hillbilly%20music">hillbilly music</a>" to sell music by blacks for blacks and by whites for whites, respectively. At the time, there was no clear musical division between "blues" and "country", except for the ethnicity of the performer, and even that was sometimes documented incorrectly by record companies.

Though musicologists can now attempt to define the blues narrowly in terms of certain chord structures and lyric forms thought to have originated in West Africa, audiences originally heard the music in a far more general way: it was simply the music of the rural south, notably the Mississippi Delta. Black and white musicians shared the same repertoire and thought of themselves as "<a href="songsters">songsters</a>" rather than blues musicians. The notion of blues as a separate genre arose during the black migration from the countryside to urban areas in the 1920s and the simultaneous development of the recording industry. "Blues" became a code word for a record designed to sell to black listeners.

The origins of the blues are closely related to the religious music of Afro-American community, the <a href="spiritual%20%28music%29">spirituals</a>. The origins of spirituals go back much further than the blues, usually dating back to the middle of the 18th century, when the slaves were Christianized and began to sing and play Christian <a href="hymn">hymn</a>s, in particular those of <a href="Isaac%20Watts">Isaac Watts</a>, which were very popular. Before the blues gained its formal definition in terms of chord progressions, it was defined as the secular counterpart of spirituals. It was the low-down music played by rural blacks.

Depending on the religious community a musician belonged to, it was more or less considered a sin to play this low-down music: blues was the devil's music. Musicians were therefore segregated into two categories: gospel singers and blues singers, guitar preachers and songsters. However, when rural black music began to be recorded in the 1920s, both categories of musicians used similar techniques: call-and-response patterns, blue notes, and slide guitars. Gospel music was nevertheless using musical forms that were compatible with Christian hymns and therefore less marked by the blues form than its secular counterpart.

The American <a href="sheet%20music">sheet music</a> publishing industry produced a great deal of <a href="ragtime">ragtime</a> music. By 1912, the sheet music industry had published three popular blues-like compositions, precipitating the <a href="Tin%20Pan%20Alley">Tin Pan Alley</a> adoption of blues elements: "Baby Seals' Blues", by "Baby" F. Seals (arranged by <a href="Artie%20Matthews">Artie Matthews</a>); "Dallas Blues", by <a href="Hart%20Wand">Hart Wand</a>; and "<a href="The%20Memphis%20Blues">The Memphis Blues</a>", by <a href="W.%20C.%20Handy">W. C. Handy</a>.
Handy was a formally trained musician, composer and arranger who helped to popularize the blues by transcribing and orchestrating blues in an almost symphonic style, with bands and singers. He became a popular and prolific composer, and billed himself as the "Father of the Blues"; however, his compositions can be described as a fusion of blues with ragtime and jazz, a merger facilitated using the Cuban <a href="habanera%20%28music%29">habanera</a> rhythm that had long been a part of ragtime; Handy's signature work was the "<a href="Saint%20Louis%20Blues%20%28song%29">Saint Louis Blues</a>".

In the 1920s, the blues became a major element of African American and American popular music, reaching white audiences via Handy's arrangements and the classic female blues performers. The blues evolved from informal performances in bars to entertainment in theaters. Blues performances were organized by the <a href="Theater%20Owners%20Bookers%20Association">Theater Owners Bookers Association</a> in <a href="nightclub">nightclub</a>s such as the <a href="Cotton%20Club">Cotton Club</a> and <a href="juke%20joint">juke joint</a>s such as the bars along <a href="Beale%20Street">Beale Street</a> in Memphis. Several record companies, such as the <a href="American%20Record%20Corporation">American Record Corporation</a>, <a href="Okeh%20Records">Okeh Records</a>, and <a href="Paramount%20Records">Paramount Records</a>, began to record African-American music.

As the recording industry grew, country blues performers like <a href="Bo%20Carter">Bo Carter</a>, <a href="Jimmie%20Rodgers%20%28country%20singer%29">Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)</a>, <a href="Blind%20Lemon%20Jefferson">Blind Lemon Jefferson</a>, <a href="Lonnie%20Johnson%20%28musician%29">Lonnie Johnson</a>, <a href="Tampa%20Red">Tampa Red</a> and <a href="Blind%20Blake">Blind Blake</a> became more popular in the African American community. Kentucky-born <a href="Sylvester%20Weaver%20%28musician%29">Sylvester Weaver</a> was in 1923 the first to record the <a href="slide%20guitar">slide guitar</a> style, in which a guitar is fretted with a knife blade or the sawed-off neck of a bottle. The slide guitar became an important part of the <a href="Delta%20blues">Delta blues</a>. The first blues recordings from the 1920s are categorized as a traditional, rural country blues and a more polished city or urban blues.

Country blues performers often improvised, either without accompaniment or with only a banjo or guitar. Regional styles of country blues varied widely in the early 20th century. The (Mississippi) Delta blues was a rootsy sparse style with passionate vocals accompanied by slide guitar. The little-recorded <a href="Robert%20Johnson%20%28musician%29">Robert Johnson</a> combined elements of urban and rural blues. In addition to Robert Johnson, influential performers of this style included his predecessors <a href="Charley%20Patton">Charley Patton</a> and <a href="Son%20House">Son House</a>. Singers such as <a href="Blind%20Willie%20McTell">Blind Willie McTell</a> and <a href="Blind%20Boy%20Fuller">Blind Boy Fuller</a> performed in the southeastern "delicate and lyrical" <a href="Piedmont%20blues">Piedmont blues</a> tradition, which used an elaborate ragtime-based <a href="fingerpicking">fingerpicking</a> guitar technique. Georgia also had an early slide tradition, with <a href="Curley%20Weaver">Curley Weaver</a>, <a href="Tampa%20Red">Tampa Red</a>, <a href="Barbecue%20Bob">"Barbecue Bob" Hicks</a> and <a href="Kokomo%20Arnold">James "Kokomo" Arnold</a> as representatives of this style.

The lively <a href="Memphis%20blues">Memphis blues</a> style, which developed in the 1920s and 1930s near <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, was influenced by <a href="jug%20band">jug band</a>s such as the <a href="Memphis%20Jug%20Band">Memphis Jug Band</a> or the <a href="Gus%20Cannon">Gus Cannon's Jug Stompers</a>. Performers such as <a href="Frank%20Stokes%20%28musician%29">Frank Stokes</a>, <a href="Sleepy%20John%20Estes">Sleepy John Estes</a>, <a href="Robert%20Wilkins">Robert Wilkins</a>, <a href="Joe%20McCoy">Joe McCoy</a>, <a href="Casey%20Bill%20Weldon">Casey Bill Weldon</a> and <a href="Memphis%20Minnie">Memphis Minnie</a> used a variety of unusual instruments such as <a href="washboard%20%28musical%20instrument%29">washboard</a>, <a href="Musical%20styles%20%28violin%29%23Fiddle">fiddle</a>, <a href="kazoo">kazoo</a> or <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a>. Memphis Minnie was famous for her <a href="virtuoso">virtuoso</a> guitar style. Pianist <a href="Memphis%20Slim">Memphis Slim</a> began his career in Memphis, but his distinct style was smoother and had some swing elements. Many blues musicians based in Memphis moved to Chicago in the late 1930s or early 1940s and became part of the urban blues movement.

City or urban blues styles were more codified and elaborate, as a performer was no longer within their local, immediate community, and had to adapt to a larger, more varied audience's aesthetic. <a href="classic%20female%20blues">Classic female urban</a> and <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> blues singers were popular in the 1920s, among them "the big three"—<a href="Gertrude%20Ma%20Rainey">Gertrude "Ma" Rainey</a>, <a href="Bessie%20Smith">Bessie Smith</a>, and <a href="Lucille%20Bogan">Lucille Bogan</a>—and <a href="Victoria%20Spivey">Victoria Spivey</a>. <a href="Mamie%20Smith">Mamie Smith</a>, more a vaudeville performer than a blues artist, was the first African American to record a blues song in 1920; her second record, "Crazy Blues", sold 75,000 copies in its first month. <a href="Ma%20Rainey">Ma Rainey</a>, the "Mother of Blues", and Bessie Smith each "[sang] around center tones, perhaps in order to project her voice more easily to the back of a room". Smith would "sing a song in an unusual key, and her artistry in bending and stretching notes with her beautiful, powerful contralto to accommodate her own interpretation was unsurpassed".

In 1920 the vaudeville singer <a href="Lucille%20Hegamin">Lucille Hegamin</a> became the second black woman to record blues when she recorded "The Jazz Me Blues". These recordings were typically labeled "<a href="race%20records">race records</a>" to distinguish them from records sold to white audiences. Nonetheless, the recordings of some of the classic female blues singers were purchased by white buyers as well. These blueswomen's contributions to the genre included "increased improvisation on melodic lines, unusual phrasing which altered the emphasis and impact of the lyrics, and vocal dramatics using shouts, groans, moans, and wails. The blues women thus effected changes in other types of popular singing that had spin-offs in jazz, <a href="Broadway%20musical">Broadway musical</a>s, <a href="torch%20song">torch song</a>s of the 1930s and 1940s, <a href="gospel%20music">gospel</a>, <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a>, and eventually <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a>."

Urban male performers included popular black musicians of the era, such as <a href="Tampa%20Red">Tampa Red</a>, <a href="Big%20Bill%20Broonzy">Big Bill Broonzy</a> and <a href="Leroy%20Carr">Leroy Carr</a>. An important label of this era was the Chicago-based <a href="Bluebird%20Records">Bluebird Records</a>. Before World War II, Tampa Red was sometimes referred to as "the Guitar Wizard". Carr accompanied himself on the piano with <a href="Scrapper%20Blackwell">Scrapper Blackwell</a> on guitar, a format that continued well into the 1950s with artists such as <a href="Charles%20Brown%20%28musician%29">Charles Brown</a> and even <a href="Nat%20%26quot%3BKing%26quot%3B%20Cole">Nat "King" Cole</a>.
<a href="boogie-woogie%20%28music%29">Boogie-woogie</a> was another important style of 1930s and early 1940s urban blues. While the style is often associated with solo piano, boogie-woogie was also used to accompany singers and, as a solo part, in bands and small combos. Boogie-Woogie style was characterized by a regular bass figure, an <a href="ostinato">ostinato</a> or <a href="riff">riff</a> and <a href="shift%20of%20level">shifts of level</a> in the left hand, elaborating each chord and trills and decorations in the right hand. Boogie-woogie was pioneered by the Chicago-based <a href="Jimmy%20Yancey">Jimmy Yancey</a> and the Boogie-Woogie Trio (<a href="Albert%20Ammons">Albert Ammons</a>, <a href="Pete%20Johnson">Pete Johnson</a> and <a href="Meade%20Lux%20Lewis">Meade Lux Lewis</a>). Chicago boogie-woogie performers included <a href="Pinetop%20Smith">Clarence "Pine Top" Smith</a> and <a href="Earl%20Hines">Earl Hines</a>, who "linked the propulsive left-hand rhythms of the ragtime pianists with melodic figures similar to those of Armstrong's trumpet in the right hand". The smooth Louisiana style of <a href="Professor%20Longhair">Professor Longhair</a> and, more recently, <a href="Dr.%20John">Dr. John</a> blends classic rhythm and blues with blues styles.

Another development in this period was <a href="big%20band">big band</a> blues. The "<a href="territory%20band">territory band</a>s" operating out of <a href="Kansas%20City%20metropolitan%20area">Kansas City</a>, the <a href="Bennie%20Moten">Bennie Moten</a> orchestra, <a href="Jay%20McShann">Jay McShann</a>, and the <a href="Count%20Basie%20Orchestra">Count Basie Orchestra</a> were also concentrating on the blues, with 12-bar blues instrumentals such as Basie's "<a href="One%20O%27Clock%20Jump">One O'Clock Jump</a>" and "<a href="Jumpin%27%20at%20the%20Woodside">Jumpin' at the Woodside</a>" and boisterous "<a href="blues%20shouter">blues shouting</a>" by <a href="Jimmy%20Rushing">Jimmy Rushing</a> on songs such as "Going to Chicago" and "<a href="Sent%20for%20You%20Yesterday">Sent for You Yesterday</a>". A well-known big band blues tune is <a href="Glenn%20Miller">Glenn Miller</a>'s "<a href="In%20the%20Mood">In the Mood</a>". In the 1940s, the <a href="jump%20blues">jump blues</a> style developed. Jump blues grew up from the boogie woogie wave and was strongly influenced by <a href="big%20band">big band</a> music. It uses <a href="saxophone">saxophone</a> or other <a href="brass%20instrument">brass instrument</a>s and the guitar in the rhythm section to create a jazzy, up-tempo sound with declamatory vocals. Jump blues tunes by <a href="Louis%20Jordan">Louis Jordan</a> and <a href="Big%20Joe%20Turner">Big Joe Turner</a>, based in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, influenced the development of later styles such as <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> and <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a>. Dallas-born <a href="T-Bone%20Walker">T-Bone Walker</a>, who is often associated with the <a href="West%20Coast%20blues">California blues</a> style, performed a successful transition from the early urban blues à la <a href="Lonnie%20Johnson%20%28musician%29">Lonnie Johnson</a> and <a href="Leroy%20Carr">Leroy Carr</a> to the jump blues style and dominated the blues-jazz scene at <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> during the 1940s.

The transition from country blues to urban blues that began in the 1920s was driven by the successive waves of economic crisis and booms which led many rural blacks to move to urban areas, in a movement known as the <a href="Great%20Migration%20%28African%20American%29">Great Migration</a>. The long <a href="post-World%20War%20II%20boom">boom</a> following World War II induced another massive migration of the African-American population, the <a href="Second%20Great%20Migration%20%28African%20American%29">Second Great Migration</a>, which was accompanied by a significant increase of the real income of the urban blacks. The new migrants constituted a new market for the music industry. The term "<a href="race%20record">race record</a>", initially used by the <a href="music%20industry">music industry</a> for <a href="African-American">African-American</a> music, was replaced by the term "<a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a>". This rapidly evolving market was mirrored by "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine's <a href="List%20of%20number-one%20rhythm%20and%20blues%20hits%20%28United%20States%29">Rhythm and Blues chart</a>. This marketing strategy reinforced trends in urban blues music such as the use of electric instruments and <a href="instrument%20amplifier">amplification</a> and the generalization of the blues beat, the <a href="blues%20shuffle">blues shuffle</a>, which became ubiquitous in R&B. This commercial stream had important consequences for blues music, which, together with <a href="jazz">jazz</a> and <a href="gospel%20music">gospel music</a>, became a component of R&B.

After World War II, new styles of <a href="electric%20blues">electric blues</a> became popular in cities such as <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis</a>, <a href="Detroit%2C%20Michigan">Detroit</a> and <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>. Electric blues used <a href="electric%20guitar">electric guitar</a>s, <a href="double%20bass">double bass</a> (gradually replaced by <a href="bass%20guitar">bass guitar</a>), <a href="drum%20kit">drums</a>, and <a href="harmonica">harmonica</a> (or "blues harp") played through a microphone and a <a href="Public%20address">PA system</a> or an <a href="Distortion%20%28music%29">overdriven</a> <a href="guitar%20amplifier">guitar amplifier</a>. Chicago became a center for electric blues from 1948 on, when <a href="Muddy%20Waters">Muddy Waters</a> recorded his first success, "I Can't Be Satisfied". <a href="Chicago%20blues">Chicago blues</a> is influenced to a large extent by <a href="Delta%20blues">Delta blues</a>, because many performers had migrated from the <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> region.

<a href="Howlin%27%20Wolf">Howlin' Wolf</a>, <a href="Muddy%20Waters">Muddy Waters</a>, <a href="Willie%20Dixon">Willie Dixon</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Reed">Jimmy Reed</a> were all born in Mississippi and moved to Chicago during the <a href="Great%20Migration%20%28African%20American%29">Great Migration</a>. Their style is characterized by the use of electric guitar, sometimes slide guitar, <a href="harmonica">harmonica</a>, and a rhythm section of bass and drums. The saxophonist <a href="J.%20T.%20Brown%20%28musician%29">J. T. Brown</a> played in bands led by <a href="Elmore%20James">Elmore James</a> and by <a href="J.%20B.%20Lenoir">J. B. Lenoir</a>, but the <a href="saxophone">saxophone</a> was used as a backing instrument for rhythmic support more than as a lead instrument.

<a href="Little%20Walter">Little Walter</a>, <a href="Sonny%20Boy%20Williamson%20II">Sonny Boy Williamson (Rice Miller)</a> and <a href="Sonny%20Terry">Sonny Terry</a> are well known harmonica (called "<a href="Harmonica%20techniques%23Blues%20harp%20%282nd%20position%29">harp</a>" by blues musicians) players of the early Chicago blues scene. Other harp players such as <a href="Big%20Walter%20Horton">Big Walter Horton</a> were also influential. Muddy Waters and Elmore James were known for their innovative use of slide electric guitar. Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters were known for their deep, "gravelly" voices.

The bassist and prolific songwriter and composer <a href="Willie%20Dixon">Willie Dixon</a> played a major role on the Chicago blues scene. He composed and wrote many <a href="blues%20standard">standard blues</a> songs of the period, such as "<a href="Hoochie%20Coochie%20Man">Hoochie Coochie Man</a>", "<a href="I%20Just%20Want%20to%20Make%20Love%20to%20You">I Just Want to Make Love to You</a>" (both penned for Muddy Waters) and, "<a href="Wang%20Dang%20Doodle">Wang Dang Doodle</a>" and "<a href="Back%20Door%20Man">Back Door Man</a>" for Howlin' Wolf. Most artists of the Chicago blues style recorded for the Chicago-based <a href="Chess%20Records">Chess Records</a> and <a href="Checker%20Records">Checker Records</a> labels. Smaller blues labels of this era included <a href="Vee-Jay%20Records">Vee-Jay Records</a> and <a href="J.O.B.%20Records">J.O.B. Records</a>. During the early 1950s, the dominating Chicago labels were challenged by <a href="Sam%20Phillips">Sam Phillips</a>' <a href="Sun%20Records">Sun Records</a> company in Memphis, which recorded <a href="B.%20B.%20King">B. B. King</a> and <a href="Howlin%27%20Wolf">Howlin' Wolf</a> before he moved to Chicago in 1960. After Phillips discovered <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a> in 1954, the Sun label turned to the rapidly expanding white audience and started recording mostly <a href="Rock%20and%20roll">rock 'n' roll</a>.

In the 1950s, blues had a huge influence on mainstream American <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a>. While popular musicians like <a href="Bo%20Diddley">Bo Diddley</a> and <a href="Chuck%20Berry">Chuck Berry</a>, both recording for Chess, were influenced by the Chicago blues, their enthusiastic playing styles departed from the melancholy aspects of blues. Chicago blues also influenced <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>'s <a href="zydeco">zydeco</a> music, with <a href="Clifton%20Chenier">Clifton Chenier</a> using blues accents. Zydeco musicians used electric solo guitar and <a href="cajun">cajun</a> arrangements of blues standards.

In England, electric blues took root there during a much acclaimed Muddy Waters tour. Waters, unsuspecting of his audience's tendency towards <a href="skiffle">skiffle</a>, an acoustic, softer brand of blues, turned up his amp and started to play his Chicago brand of electric blues. Although the audience was largely jolted by the performance, the performance influenced local musicians such as <a href="Alexis%20Korner">Alexis Korner</a> and <a href="Cyril%20Davies">Cyril Davies</a> to emulate this louder style, inspiring the <a href="British%20invasion">British invasion</a> of the <a href="Rolling%20Stones">Rolling Stones</a> and the <a href="Yardbirds">Yardbirds</a>.

In the late 1950s, a new blues style emerged on Chicago's <a href="West%20Side%2C%20Chicago">West Side</a> pioneered by <a href="Magic%20Sam">Magic Sam</a>, <a href="Buddy%20Guy">Buddy Guy</a> and <a href="Otis%20Rush">Otis Rush</a> on <a href="Cobra%20Records">Cobra Records</a>. The "West Side sound" had strong rhythmic support from a rhythm guitar, bass guitar and drums and as perfected by Guy, <a href="Freddie%20King">Freddie King</a>, <a href="Magic%20Slim">Magic Slim</a> and <a href="Luther%20Allison">Luther Allison</a> was dominated by amplified electric lead guitar. Expressive <a href="guitar%20solo">guitar solo</a>s were a key feature of this music.

Other blues artists, such as <a href="John%20Lee%20Hooker">John Lee Hooker</a> had influences not directly related to the Chicago style. John Lee Hooker's blues is more "personal", based on Hooker's deep rough voice accompanied by a single electric guitar. Though not directly influenced by boogie woogie, his "groovy" style is sometimes called "guitar boogie". His first hit, "<a href="Boogie%20Chillen">Boogie Chillen</a>", reached number 1 on the R&B charts in 1949.

By the late 1950s, the <a href="swamp%20blues">swamp blues</a> genre developed near <a href="Baton%20Rouge">Baton Rouge</a>, with performers such as <a href="Lightnin%27%20Slim">Lightnin' Slim</a>, <a href="Slim%20Harpo">Slim Harpo</a>, <a href="Sam%20Myers">Sam Myers</a> and <a href="Jerry%20McCain">Jerry McCain</a> around the producer <a href="J.%20D.%20%26quot%3BJay%26quot%3B%20Miller">J. D. "Jay" Miller</a> and the <a href="Excello%20Records">Excello</a> label. Strongly influenced by <a href="Jimmy%20Reed">Jimmy Reed</a>, Swamp blues has a slower pace and a simpler use of the harmonica than the Chicago blues style performers such as Little Walter or Muddy Waters. Songs from this genre include "Scratch my Back", "She's Tough" and "<a href="I%27m%20a%20King%20Bee">I'm a King Bee</a>". <a href="Alan%20Lomax">Alan Lomax</a>'s recordings of <a href="Mississippi%20Fred%20McDowell">Mississippi Fred McDowell</a> would eventually bring him wider attention on both the blues and <a href="Folk%20music">folk</a> circuit, with McDowell's droning style influencing <a href="North%20Mississippi%20hill%20country%20blues">North Mississippi hill country blues</a> musicians.

By the beginning of the 1960s, genres influenced by <a href="African%20American%20music">African American music</a> such as <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> and <a href="soul%20music">soul</a> were part of mainstream popular music. White performers such as <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a> had brought African-American music to new audiences, both within the U.S. and abroad. However, the blues wave that brought artists such as Muddy Waters to the foreground had stopped. Bluesmen such as <a href="Big%20Bill%20Broonzy">Big Bill Broonzy</a> and <a href="Willie%20Dixon">Willie Dixon</a> started looking for new markets in Europe. <a href="Dick%20Waterman">Dick Waterman</a> and the blues festivals he organized in Europe played a major role in propagating blues music abroad. In the UK, bands emulated U.S. blues legends, and UK blues rock-based bands had an influential role throughout the 1960s.
Blues performers such as <a href="John%20Lee%20Hooker">John Lee Hooker</a> and <a href="Muddy%20Waters">Muddy Waters</a> continued to perform to enthusiastic audiences, inspiring new artists steeped in traditional blues, such as New York–born <a href="Taj%20Mahal%20%28musician%29">Taj Mahal</a>. <a href="John%20Lee%20Hooker">John Lee Hooker</a> blended his blues style with rock elements and playing with younger white musicians, creating a musical style that can be heard on the 1971 album "<a href="Endless%20Boogie">Endless Boogie</a>". <a href="B.%20B.%20King">B. B. King</a>'s singing and virtuoso guitar technique earned him the eponymous title "king of the blues". King introduced a sophisticated style of <a href="guitar%20solo">guitar solo</a>ing based on fluid <a href="string%20bending">string bending</a> and shimmering <a href="vibrato">vibrato</a> that influenced many later electric blues guitarists.
In contrast to the Chicago style, King's band used strong brass support from a saxophone, trumpet, and trombone, instead of using slide guitar or harp. <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>-born <a href="Bobby%20Bland">Bobby "Blue" Bland</a>, like B. B. King, also straddled the blues and R&B genres. During this period, <a href="Freddie%20King">Freddie King</a> and <a href="Albert%20King">Albert King</a> often played with rock and <a href="Soul%20music">soul</a> musicians (<a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a> and <a href="Booker%20T%20%26amp%3B%20the%20MGs">Booker T & the MGs</a>) and had a major influence on those styles of music.

The music of the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> and <a href="Free%20Speech%20Movement">Free Speech Movement</a> in the U.S. prompted a <a href="American%20folk%20music%20revival">resurgence of interest in American roots music and early African American music</a>. As well festivals such as the <a href="Newport%20Folk%20Festival">Newport Folk Festival</a> brought traditional blues to a new audience, which helped to revive interest in prewar acoustic blues and performers such as <a href="Son%20House">Son House</a>, <a href="Mississippi%20John%20Hurt">Mississippi John Hurt</a>, <a href="Skip%20James">Skip James</a>, and <a href="Reverend%20Gary%20Davis">Reverend Gary Davis</a>. Many compilations of classic prewar blues were republished by the <a href="Yazoo%20Records">Yazoo Records</a>. <a href="J.%20B.%20Lenoir">J. B. Lenoir</a> from the Chicago blues movement in the 1950s recorded several LPs using acoustic guitar, sometimes accompanied by <a href="Willie%20Dixon">Willie Dixon</a> on the acoustic bass or drums. His songs, originally distributed only in Europe, commented on political issues such as <a href="racism">racism</a> or <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> issues, which was unusual for this period. His album "Alabama Blues" contained a song with the following lyric:
<poem>I never will go back to Alabama, that is not the place for me (2x)
You know they killed my sister and my brother,
and the whole world let them peoples go down there free</poem>

White audiences' interest in the blues during the 1960s increased due to the Chicago-based <a href="Paul%20Butterfield">Paul Butterfield Blues Band</a> featuring guitarist <a href="Mike%20Bloomfield">Michael Bloomfield</a>, and the <a href="British%20blues">British blues</a> movement. The style of British blues developed in the UK, when bands such as the <a href="The%20Animals">Animals</a>, <a href="Fleetwood%20Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a>, <a href="John%20Mayall%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Bluesbreakers">John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers</a>, the <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">Rolling Stones</a>, the <a href="The%20Yardbirds">Yardbirds</a>, the <a href="supergroup%20%28music%29">supergroup</a> <a href="Cream%20%28band%29">Cream</a> and the Irish musician <a href="Rory%20Gallagher">Rory Gallagher</a> performed classic blues songs from the <a href="Delta%20blues">Delta</a> or <a href="Chicago%20blues">Chicago blues</a> traditions.

In 1963, <a href="LeRoi%20Jones">LeRoi Jones</a>, later known as Amiri Baraka, was the first to write a book on the social history of the blues in Blues People: The Negro Music in White America.
In 1970 the trio <a href="Manal">Manal</a> established in <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> the basics of blues sung in Castilian. Influenced poetically by the <a href="tango">tango</a> and generate <a href="Beatnik">Beatnik</a>, and musically by the blues, <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a>, <a href="jazz">jazz</a> and <a href="African%20music">African music</a> of <a href="R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">River Plate</a>, the trio composed of <a href="Alejandro%20Medina">Alejandro Medina</a>, <a href="Javier%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20%28musician%29">Javier Martinez</a> and <a href="Claudio%20Gabis">Claudio Gabis</a> created a music that fused the roots of a genre born in the <a href="Mississippi%20Delta">Mississippi Delta</a> with elements of idiosyncrasy and local geography <a href="Porte%C3%B1a">Porteña</a>. The lyrics of Manal emphasize existentialism, the industrial city and the railroads, is notable in one of his most well-known songs, "<a href="Avellaneda%20Blues">Avellaneda Blues</a>":
Vía muerta, calle con asfalto siempre destrozado. 
Tren de carga, el humo y el hollín, están por todos lados.

Sur y aceite, barriles en el barro, galpón abandonado. 
Charco sucio, el agua va pudriendo, un zapato olvidado.
Dead rail, street with asphalt always shattered.
Freight train, smoke and soot, are everywhere.

South and oil, barrels in the mud, abandoned shed.
Dirty puddle, the water is rotting, a forgotten shoe.
"Avellaneda Blues" by <a href="Manal">Manal</a> (1970).

The British and blues musicians of the early 1960s inspired a number of American <a href="blues%20rock">blues rock</a> fusion performers, including the <a href="The%20Doors">Doors</a>, <a href="Canned%20Heat">Canned Heat</a>, the early <a href="Jefferson%20Airplane">Jefferson Airplane</a>, <a href="Janis%20Joplin">Janis Joplin</a>, <a href="Johnny%20Winter">Johnny Winter</a>, <a href="The%20J.%20Geils%20Band">The J. Geils Band</a>, <a href="Ry%20Cooder">Ry Cooder</a>, and the <a href="Allman%20Brothers%20Band">Allman Brothers Band</a>. One blues rock performer, <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, was a rarity in his field at the time: a black man who played <a href="psychedelic%20rock">psychedelic rock</a>. Hendrix was a skilled guitarist, and a pioneer in the innovative use of <a href="distortion">distortion</a> and <a href="audio%20feedback">audio feedback</a> in his music. Through these artists and others, blues music influenced the development of <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a>.

<a href="Santana%20%28band%29">Santana</a>, which was originally called the "Carlos Santana Blues Band", also experimented with <a href="Latin%20music%20%28genre%29">Latin</a>-influenced blues and blues rock music around this time. At the end of the 1950s appeared the bluesy <a href="The%20Tulsa%20Sound">Tulsa Sound</a> merging rock'n'roll, jazz and country influences. This particular music style was popularized in the 1970s by <a href="J.%20J.%20Cale">J. J. Cale</a> and the cover versions performed by <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a> of "<a href="After%20Midnight%20%28J.%20J.%20Cale%20song%29">After Midnight</a>" and "<a href="Cocaine%20%28song%29">Cocaine</a>".

In the early 1970s, The <a href="Texas%20blues">Texas rock-blues style</a> emerged, which used guitars in both solo and rhythm roles. In contrast with the West Side blues, the Texas style is strongly influenced by the British rock-blues movement. Major artists of the Texas style are <a href="Johnny%20Winter">Johnny Winter</a>, <a href="Stevie%20Ray%20Vaughan">Stevie Ray Vaughan</a>, the <a href="The%20Fabulous%20Thunderbirds">Fabulous Thunderbirds</a> (led by <a href="harmonica">harmonica</a> player and singer-songwriter <a href="Kim%20Wilson">Kim Wilson</a>), and <a href="ZZ%20Top">ZZ Top</a>. These artists all began their musical careers in the 1970s but they did not achieve international success until the next decade.

Since the 1980s there has been a resurgence of interest in the blues among a certain part of the African-American population, particularly around <a href="Jackson%2C%20Mississippi">Jackson, Mississippi</a> and other <a href="deep%20South">deep South</a> regions. Often termed "<a href="soul%20blues">soul blues</a>" or "<a href="Southern%20soul">Southern soul</a>", the music at the heart of this movement was given new life by the unexpected success of two particular recordings on the Jackson-based <a href="Malaco%20Records">Malaco</a> label: <a href="Z.%20Z.%20Hill">Z. Z. Hill</a>'s "Down Home Blues" (1982) and <a href="Little%20Milton">Little Milton</a>'s "The Blues is Alright" (1984). Contemporary African-American performers who work in this style of the blues include <a href="Bobby%20Rush%20%28musician%29">Bobby Rush</a>, <a href="Denise%20LaSalle">Denise LaSalle</a>, <a href="Sir%20Charles%20Jones">Sir Charles Jones</a>, <a href="Bettye%20LaVette">Bettye LaVette</a>, <a href="Marvin%20Sease">Marvin Sease</a>, <a href="Peggy%20Scott-Adams">Peggy Scott-Adams</a>, Mel Waiters, <a href="Clarence%20Carter">Clarence Carter</a>, Dr. "Feelgood" Potts, O.B. Buchana, Ms. Jody, <a href="Shirley%20Brown">Shirley Brown</a>, and dozens of others.

During the 1980s blues also continued in both traditional and new forms. In 1986 the album "<a href="Strong%20Persuader">Strong Persuader</a>" announced <a href="Robert%20Cray">Robert Cray</a> as a major blues artist. The first <a href="Stevie%20Ray%20Vaughan">Stevie Ray Vaughan</a> recording "<a href="Texas%20Flood">Texas Flood</a>" was released in 1983, and the Texas-based guitarist exploded onto the international stage. <a href="John%20Lee%20Hooker">John Lee Hooker</a>'s popularity was revived with the album "<a href="The%20Healer%20%28album%29">The Healer</a>" in 1989. <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>, known for his performances with <a href="John%20Mayall%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Bluesbreakers">the Blues Breakers</a> and <a href="Cream%20%28band%29">Cream</a>, made a comeback in the 1990s with his album "<a href="Unplugged%20%28Eric%20Clapton%20album%29">Unplugged</a>", in which he played some standard blues numbers on acoustic guitar.

However, beginning in the 1990s, <a href="digital%20recording">digital multitrack recording</a> and other technological advances and new marketing strategies including <a href="video%20clip">video clip</a> production increased costs, challenging the spontaneity and improvisation that are an important component of blues music.

In the 1980s and 1990s, blues publications such as "<a href="Living%20Blues">Living Blues</a>" and "<a href="Blues%20Revue">Blues Revue</a>" were launched, major cities began forming blues societies, outdoor blues festivals became more common, and more <a href="nightclub">nightclub</a>s and venues for blues emerged.

In the 1990s, the largely ignored <a href="hill%20country%20blues">hill country blues</a> gained minor recognition in both blues and <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> music circles with northern Mississippi artists <a href="R.%20L.%20Burnside">R. L. Burnside</a> and <a href="Junior%20Kimbrough">Junior Kimbrough</a>. Blues performers explored a range of musical genres, as can be seen, for example, from the broad array of nominees of the yearly <a href="Blues%20Music%20Awards">Blues Music Awards</a>, previously named W. C. Handy Awards or of the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Contemporary%20Blues%20Album">Grammy Awards for Best Contemporary</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Traditional%20Blues%20Album">Traditional Blues Album</a>. The Billboard Blues Album chart provides an overview of current blues hits. Contemporary blues music is nurtured by several blues labels such as: <a href="Alligator%20Records">Alligator Records</a>, <a href="Ruf%20Records">Ruf Records</a>, <a href="Severn%20Records">Severn Records</a>, <a href="Chess%20Records">Chess Records</a> (<a href="Music%20Corporation%20of%20America">MCA</a>), <a href="Delmark%20Records">Delmark Records</a>, <a href="NorthernBlues%20Music">NorthernBlues Music</a>, <a href="Fat%20Possum%20Records">Fat Possum Records</a> and <a href="Vanguard%20Records">Vanguard Records</a> (Artemis Records). Some labels are famous for rediscovering and remastering blues rarities, including <a href="Arhoolie%20Records">Arhoolie Records</a>, <a href="Smithsonian%20Folkways%20Recordings">Smithsonian Folkways Recordings</a> (heir of <a href="Folkways%20Records">Folkways Records</a>), and <a href="Yazoo%20Records">Yazoo Records</a> (<a href="Shanachie%20Records">Shanachie Records</a>).

From the late 2000s to the present day, <a href="blues%20rock">blues rock</a> has gained a cultural following, especially after the rise of the <a href="Internet">Internet</a>, when artists started creating <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> channels, forums, and <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> pages. Notable blues rock musicians of this period include <a href="Joe%20Bonamassa">Joe Bonamassa</a>, <a href="Gary%20Clark%20Jr.">Gary Clark Jr.</a>, <a href="John%20Mayer">John Mayer</a>, <a href="Shemekia%20Copeland">Shemekia Copeland</a>, <a href="Eric%20Gales">Eric Gales</a>, <a href="Beth%20Hart">Beth Hart</a>, <a href="Warren%20Haynes">Warren Haynes</a>, <a href="Jason%20Ricci">Jason Ricci</a>, <a href="Susan%20Tedeschi">Susan Tedeschi</a>, <a href="Derek%20Trucks">Derek Trucks</a>, <a href="Ben%20Harper">Ben Harper</a> (in collaboration with <a href="Charlie%20Musselwhite">Charlie Musselwhite</a>) and <a href="Orianthi">Orianthi</a>. <a href="Alternative%20rock">Alternative rock</a> artists still combine strong elements of blues in their music, especially <a href="ZZ%20Ward">ZZ Ward</a>, <a href="Cage%20the%20Elephant">Cage the Elephant</a>, <a href="Jack%20White">Jack White</a>, and the <a href="The%20Black%20Keys">Black Keys</a>.

Blues musical styles, forms (12-bar blues), melodies, and the blues scale have influenced many other genres of music, such as rock and roll, jazz, and popular music. Prominent jazz, folk or rock performers, such as <a href="Louis%20Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a>, <a href="Duke%20Ellington">Duke Ellington</a>, <a href="Miles%20Davis">Miles Davis</a>, and <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> have performed significant blues recordings. The blues scale is often used in <a href="popular%20song">popular song</a>s like <a href="Harold%20Arlen">Harold Arlen</a>'s "Blues in the Night", <a href="blues%20ballad">blues ballad</a>s like "Since I Fell for You" and "Please Send Me Someone to Love", and even in orchestral works such as <a href="George%20Gershwin">George Gershwin</a>'s "<a href="Rhapsody%20in%20Blue">Rhapsody in Blue</a>" and "Concerto in F". Gershwin's second "Prelude" for solo piano is an interesting example of a classical blues, maintaining the form with academic strictness. The blues scale is ubiquitous in modern popular music and informs many <a href="modal%20frame">modal frame</a>s, especially the <a href="ladder%20of%20thirds">ladder of thirds</a> used in rock music (for example, in "<a href="A%20Hard%20Day%27s%20Night%20%28song%29">A Hard Day's Night</a>"). Blues forms are used in the theme to the televised "<a href="Batman%20%28TV%20series%29">Batman</a>", <a href="teen%20idol">teen idol</a> <a href="Fabian%20Forte">Fabian Forte</a>'s hit, "Turn Me Loose", <a href="country%20music">country music</a> star <a href="Jimmie%20Rodgers%20%28country%20singer%29">Jimmie Rodgers</a>' music, and guitarist/vocalist <a href="Tracy%20Chapman">Tracy Chapman</a>'s hit "Give Me One Reason".

Early country bluesmen such as <a href="Skip%20James">Skip James</a>, <a href="Charley%20Patton">Charley Patton</a>, <a href="Georgia%20Tom%20Dorsey">Georgia Tom Dorsey</a> played country and urban blues and had influences from spiritual singing. Dorsey helped to popularize <a href="Gospel%20music">Gospel music</a>. Gospel music developed in the 1930s, with the <a href="Golden%20Gate%20Quartet">Golden Gate Quartet</a>. In the 1950s, <a href="soul%20music">soul music</a> by <a href="Sam%20Cooke">Sam Cooke</a>, <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a> and <a href="James%20Brown">James Brown</a> used gospel and blues music elements. In the 1960s and 1970s, gospel and blues were merged in <a href="soul%20blues">soul blues</a> music. <a href="Funk">Funk</a> music of the 1970s was influenced by soul; funk can be seen as an antecedent of hip-hop and contemporary R&B.

<a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> music can be traced back to <a href="Spiritual%20%28music%29">spirituals</a> and blues. Musically, spirituals were a descendant of <a href="New%20England">New England</a> choral traditions, and in particular of <a href="Isaac%20Watts">Isaac Watts</a>'s <a href="hymn">hymn</a>s, mixed with African rhythms and call-and-response forms. Spirituals or religious chants in the African-American community are much better documented than the "low-down" blues. Spiritual singing developed because African-American communities could gather for mass or worship gatherings, which were called <a href="camp%20meeting">camp meeting</a>s.

Edward P. Comentale has noted how the blues was often used as a medium for art or self-expression, stating: "As heard from Delta shacks to Chicago tenements to Harlem cabarets, the blues proved—despite its pained origins—a remarkably flexible medium and a new arena for the shaping of identity and community."

Before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the boundaries between blues and <a href="jazz">jazz</a> were less clear. Usually jazz had harmonic structures stemming from <a href="brass%20band">brass band</a>s, whereas blues had blues forms such as the 12-bar blues. However, the jump blues of the 1940s mixed both styles. After WWII, blues had a substantial influence on jazz. <a href="Bebop">Bebop</a> classics, such as <a href="Charlie%20Parker">Charlie Parker</a>'s "Now's the Time", used the blues form with the pentatonic scale and blue notes.

Bebop marked a major shift in the role of jazz, from a popular style of music for dancing, to a "high-art", less-accessible, cerebral "musician's music". The audience for both blues and jazz split, and the border between blues and jazz became more defined.

The blues' 12-bar structure and the blues scale was a major influence on <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> music. Rock and roll has been called "blues with a <a href="Backbeat%20%28music%29">backbeat</a>"; <a href="Carl%20Perkins">Carl Perkins</a> called <a href="rockabilly">rockabilly</a> "blues with a <a href="country%20music">country</a> beat". Rockabillies were also said to be 12-bar blues played with a <a href="bluegrass%20music">bluegrass</a> beat. "<a href="Hound%20Dog%20%28song%29">Hound Dog</a>", with its unmodified 12-bar structure (in both harmony and lyrics) and a melody centered on flatted third of the tonic (and flatted seventh of the subdominant), is a blues song transformed into a rock and roll song. <a href="Jerry%20Lee%20Lewis">Jerry Lee Lewis</a>'s style of rock and roll was heavily influenced by the blues and its derivative boogie woogie. His style of music was not exactly rockabilly but it has been often called real rock and roll (this is a label he shares with several African American rock and roll performers).

Many early rock and roll songs are based on blues: "<a href="That%27s%20All%20Right%20Mama">That's All Right Mama</a>", "<a href="Johnny%20B.%20Goode">Johnny B. Goode</a>", "<a href="Blue%20Suede%20Shoes">Blue Suede Shoes</a>", "<a href="Whole%20Lotta%20Shakin%27%20Goin%20On">Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On</a>", "<a href="Shake%2C%20Rattle%2C%20and%20Roll">Shake, Rattle, and Roll</a>", and "<a href="Long%20Tall%20Sally">Long Tall Sally</a>". The early African American rock musicians retained the sexual themes and innuendos of blues music: "Got a gal named Sue, knows just what to do" ("<a href="Tutti%20Frutti%20%28song%29">Tutti Frutti</a>", <a href="Little%20Richard">Little Richard</a>) or "See the girl with the red dress on, She can do the Birdland all night long" ("<a href="What%27d%20I%20Say%20%28song%29">What'd I Say</a>", <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a>). The 12-bar blues structure can be found even in novelty pop songs, such as <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s "<a href="Obviously%20Five%20Believers">Obviously Five Believers</a>" and <a href="Esther%20and%20Abi%20Ofarim">Esther and Abi Ofarim</a>'s "<a href="Cinderella%20Rockefella">Cinderella Rockefella</a>".

Early <a href="country%20music">country music</a> was infused with the blues. <a href="Jimmie%20Rodgers%20%28country%20singer%29">Jimmie Rodgers</a>, <a href="Moon%20Mullican">Moon Mullican</a>, <a href="Bob%20Wills">Bob Wills</a>, <a href="Bill%20Monroe">Bill Monroe</a> and <a href="Hank%20Williams">Hank Williams</a> have all described themselves as blues singers and their music has a blues feel that is different, at first glance at least, from the later country pop of artists like <a href="Eddy%20Arnold">Eddy Arnold</a>. Yet, if one looks back further, Arnold also started out singing bluesy songs like 'I'll Hold You in My Heart'. A lot of the 1970s-era "outlaw" country music by <a href="Willie%20Nelson">Willie Nelson</a> and <a href="Waylon%20Jennings">Waylon Jennings</a> also borrowed from the blues. When <a href="Jerry%20Lee%20Lewis">Jerry Lee Lewis</a> returned to country after the decline of 1950s style rock and roll, he sang his country with a blues feel and often included blues standards on his albums.

Like <a href="jazz">jazz</a>, <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a>, <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal music</a>, <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop music</a>, <a href="reggae">reggae</a>, rap, <a href="country%20music">country music</a>, and <a href="pop%20music">pop music</a>, blues has been accused of being the "<a href="Satan">devil</a>'s music" and of inciting violence and other poor behavior. In the early 20th century, the blues was considered disreputable, especially as white audiences began listening to the blues during the 1920s. In the early twentieth century, <a href="W.%20C.%20Handy">W.C. Handy</a> was the first to popularize blues-influenced music among non-black Americans.

During the blues revival of the 1960s and '70s, acoustic blues artist <a href="Taj%20Mahal%20%28musician%29">Taj Mahal</a> and legendary Texas bluesman <a href="Lightnin%27%20Hopkins">Lightnin' Hopkins</a> wrote and performed music that figured prominently in the popularly and critically acclaimed film "<a href="Sounder%20%28film%29">Sounder</a>" (1972). The film earned Mahal a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy</a> nomination for Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture and a <a href="BAFTA">BAFTA</a> nomination. Almost 30 years later, Mahal wrote blues for, and performed a banjo composition, claw-hammer style, in the 2001 movie release "<a href="Songcatcher">Songcatcher</a>", which focused on the story of the preservation of the <a href="Appalachian%20music">roots music of Appalachia</a>.

Perhaps the most visible example of the blues style of music in the late 20th century came in 1980, when <a href="Dan%20Aykroyd">Dan Aykroyd</a> and <a href="John%20Belushi">John Belushi</a> released the film "<a href="The%20Blues%20Brothers%20%28film%29">The Blues Brothers</a>". The film drew many of the biggest living influencers of the <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a> genre together, such as <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a>, <a href="James%20Brown">James Brown</a>, <a href="Cab%20Calloway">Cab Calloway</a>, <a href="Aretha%20Franklin">Aretha Franklin</a>, and <a href="John%20Lee%20Hooker">John Lee Hooker</a>. The band formed also began a successful tour under the <a href="The%20Blues%20Brothers">Blues Brothers</a> marquee. 1998 brought a sequel, "<a href="Blues%20Brothers%202000">Blues Brothers 2000</a>" that, while not holding as great a critical and financial success, featured a much larger number of blues artists, such as <a href="B.B.%20King">B.B. King</a>, <a href="Bo%20Diddley">Bo Diddley</a>, <a href="Erykah%20Badu">Erykah Badu</a>, <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a>, <a href="Steve%20Winwood">Steve Winwood</a>, <a href="Charlie%20Musselwhite">Charlie Musselwhite</a>, <a href="Blues%20Traveler">Blues Traveler</a>, <a href="Jimmie%20Vaughan">Jimmie Vaughan</a>, and <a href="Jeff%20Baxter">Jeff Baxter</a>.

In 2003, <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> made significant efforts to promote the blues to a larger audience. He asked several famous directors such as <a href="Clint%20Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a> and <a href="Wim%20Wenders">Wim Wenders</a> to participate in a series of documentary films for <a href="Public%20Broadcasting%20Service">PBS</a> called "<a href="The%20Blues%20%28film%29">The Blues</a>". He also participated in the rendition of compilations of major blues artists in a series of high-quality CDs. Blues guitarist and vocalist <a href="Keb%27%20Mo%27">Keb' Mo'</a> performed his blues rendition of "<a href="America%2C%20the%20Beautiful">America, the Beautiful</a>" in 2006 to close out the final season of the television series "<a href="The%20West%20Wing">The West Wing</a>".

Berlin

Berlin (, ) is the <a href="Capital%20city">capital</a> and the largest city of <a href="Germany">Germany</a> as well as one of its 16 constituent <a href="states%20of%20Germany">states</a>. With a population of approximately 3.7 million, Berlin is the <a href="List%20of%20largest%20cities%20in%20the%20European%20Union%20by%20population%20within%20city%20limits">second most populous city proper</a> in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> and the seventh <a href="List%20of%20urban%20areas%20in%20the%20European%20Union">most populous urban area</a> in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of the rivers <a href="Spree">Spree</a> and <a href="Havel">Havel</a>, it is the centre of the <a href="Berlin/Brandenburg%20Metropolitan%20Region">Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region</a>, which has roughly 6 million residents from more than 180 nations.
Due to its location in the <a href="European%20Plain">European Plain</a>, Berlin is influenced by a <a href="Temperate%20climate">temperate</a> seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and lakes.

First documented in the 13th century and situated at the crossing of two important historic <a href="trade%20route">trade route</a>s, Berlin became the capital of the <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg">Margraviate of Brandenburg</a> (14171701), the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a> (1701–1918), the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> (1871–1918), the <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Weimar Republic</a> (1919–1933) and the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a> (1933–1945). <a href="1920s%20Berlin">Berlin in the 1920s</a> was the third largest municipality in the world. After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and its subsequent occupation by the victorious countries, the city was divided; <a href="East%20Berlin">East Berlin</a> was declared capital of <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a>, while <a href="West%20Berlin">West Berlin</a> became a de facto <a href="West%20Germany">West German</a> <a href="exclave">exclave</a>, surrounded by the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a> (1961–1989) and East German territory. Following <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a> in 1990, Berlin once again became the capital of all of Germany.

Berlin is an <a href="Global%20city">international city</a> of culture, politics, media and science. Its economy is based on <a href="High%20tech">high-tech</a> firms and the service sector, encompassing a diverse range of <a href="creative%20industries">creative industries</a>, research facilities, media corporations and convention venues. Berlin serves as a continental hub for air and rail traffic and has a highly complex public transportation network. The metropolis is a popular <a href="Tourism%20in%20Germany">tourist destination</a>. Significant industries also include <a href="information%20technology">IT</a>, pharmaceuticals, biomedical engineering, clean tech, <a href="biotechnology">biotechnology</a>, construction and electronics.

Modern Berlin is home to world renowned universities, orchestras, museums, entertainment venues and is host to many sporting events. Its urban setting has made it a sought-after location for international <a href="List%20of%20films%20set%20in%20Berlin">film productions</a>. The city is well known for its festivals, diverse architecture, nightlife, contemporary arts and a <a href="World%27s%20most%20liveable%20cities">high quality of living</a>. Since the 2000s Berlin has seen the emergence of a cosmopolitan <a href="entrepreneurship">entrepreneurial</a> <a href="Startup%20ecosystem">scene</a>.

The name Berlin has its roots in the language of <a href="West%20Slavs">West Slavic</a> inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old <a href="Polabian%20language">Polabian</a> stem "berl-"/"birl-" ("swamp"). All German place names ending on "-ow", "-itz" and "-in", of which there are many east of the <a href="Elbe">River Elbe</a>, are of <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic</a> origin (<a href="Germania%20Slavica">Germania Slavica</a>). There are many boroughs of Slavic origin in the city: Berlin-<a href="Karow%20%28Berlin%29">Karow</a>, Berlin-<a href="Malchow%20%28Berlin%29">Malchow</a>, Berlin-<a href="Pankow">Pankow</a>, Berlin-<a href="Spandau">Spandau</a> (earlier: "Spandow"), Berlin-<a href="Gatow">Gatow</a>, Berlin-<a href="Kladow">Kladow</a>, Berlin-<a href="Steglitz">Steglitz</a>, Berlin-<a href="Lankwitz">Lankwitz</a>, Berlin-<a href="Britz">Britz</a>, Berlin-<a href="Buckow%20%28Berlin%29">Buckow</a>, Berlin-<a href="Rudow">Rudow</a>, Berlin-<a href="Alt-Treptow">Alt-Treptow</a>, Berlin-<a href="Schm%C3%B6ckwitz">Schmöckwitz</a>, Berlin-<a href="Marzahn">Marzahn</a> and Berlin-<a href="K%C3%B6penick">Köpenick</a>. Since the "Ber-" at the beginning sounds like the German word "Bär" (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city. It is therefore a <a href="canting%20arms">canting arm</a>.

The earliest evidence of settlements in the area of today's Berlin are a wooden rod dated from approximately 1192 and leftovers of wooden houseparts dated to 1174 found in a 2012 excavation in Berlin Mitte. The first written records of towns in the area of present-day Berlin date from the late 12th century. <a href="Spandau">Spandau</a> is first mentioned in 1197 and <a href="K%C3%B6penick">Köpenick</a> in 1209, although these areas did not join Berlin until 1920. The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns. <a href="C%C3%B6lln">Cölln</a> on the <a href="Fischerinsel">Fischerinsel</a> is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the <a href="Spree">Spree</a> in what is now called the <a href="Nikolaiviertel">Nikolaiviertel</a>, is referenced in a document from 1244. 1237 is considered the founding date of the city. The two towns over time formed close economic and social ties, and profited from the <a href="staple%20right">staple right</a> on the two important <a href="trade%20route">trade route</a>s "<a href="Via%20Imperii">Via Imperii</a>" and from <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> to <a href="Novgorod">Novgorod</a>. In 1307, they formed an alliance with a common external policy, their internal administrations still being separated.

In 1415 <a href="Frederick%20I%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">Frederick I</a> became the <a href="prince-elector">elector</a> of the <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg">Margraviate of Brandenburg</a>, which he ruled until 1440. During the 15th century, his successors established Berlin-Cölln as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the <a href="Hohenzollern">Hohenzollern</a> family ruled in Berlin until 1918, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and eventually as <a href="German%20emperor">German emperor</a>s. In 1443 <a href="Frederick%20II%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">Frederick II Irontooth</a> started the construction of a new <a href="Stadtschloss%2C%20Berlin">royal palace</a> in the twin city Berlin-Cölln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the "Berlin Indignation" ("Berliner Unwille"). This protest was not successful and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges. After the royal palace was finished in 1451, it gradually came into use. From 1470, with the new elector <a href="Albrecht%20III%20Achilles%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">Albrecht III Achilles</a>, Berlin-Cölln became the new royal residence. Officially, the Berlin-Cölln palace became permanent residence of the Brandenburg electors of the Hohenzollerns from 1486, when <a href="John%20Cicero%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">John Cicero</a> came to power. Berlin-Cölln, however, had to give up its status as a free <a href="Hanseatic%20League">Hanseatic</a> city. In 1539, the electors and the city officially became <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a>.

The <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a> between 1618 and 1648 devastated Berlin. One third of its houses were damaged or destroyed, and the city lost half of its population. <a href="Frederick%20William%20I%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">Frederick William</a>, known as the "Great Elector", who had succeeded his father <a href="George%20William%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">George William</a> as ruler in 1640, initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious tolerance. With the <a href="Edict%20of%20Potsdam">Edict of Potsdam</a> in 1685, Frederick William offered asylum to the French <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a>s. By 1700, approximately 30 percent of Berlin's residents were French, because of the Huguenot immigration. Many other immigrants came from <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>, <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Poland</a>, and <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Salzburg">Salzburg</a>.

Since 1618 the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in <a href="personal%20union">personal union</a> with the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Prussia">Duchy of Prussia</a>. In 1701 the dual state formed the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a>, as <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg</a> crowned himself as king <a href="Frederick%20I%20of%20Prussia">Frederick I in Prussia</a>. Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom, replacing <a href="K%C3%B6nigsberg">Königsberg</a>. This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1709, Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln, Friedrichswerder, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, "Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin".

In 1740 Frederick II, known as <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great">Frederick the Great</a> (1740–1786), came to power. Under the rule of Frederick II, Berlin became a center of <a href="the%20Enlightenment">the Enlightenment</a>, but also, was briefly occupied during the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a> by the Russian army. Following France's victory in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Fourth%20Coalition">War of the Fourth Coalition</a>, <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> marched into Berlin in 1806, but granted self-government to the city. In 1815 the city became part of the new <a href="Province%20of%20Brandenburg">Province of Brandenburg</a>.

The <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic centre of Germany. Additional suburbs soon developed and increased the area and population of Berlin. In 1861 neighbouring suburbs including <a href="Wedding%20%28Berlin%29">Wedding</a>, <a href="Moabit">Moabit</a> and several others were incorporated into Berlin. In 1871 Berlin became capital of the newly founded <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>. In 1881 it became a city district separate from Brandenburg.

In the early 20th century, Berlin had become a fertile ground for the <a href="German%20Expressionism">German Expressionist</a> movement. In fields such as <a href="architecture">architecture</a>, <a href="painting">painting</a> and <a href="film">cinema</a> new forms of artistic styles were invented. At the end of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in 1918, a <a href="Weimar%20Republic">republic</a> was proclaimed by <a href="Philipp%20Scheidemann">Philipp Scheidemann</a> at the <a href="Reichstag%20%28building%29">Reichstag building</a>. In 1920 the <a href="Greater%20Berlin%20Act">Greater Berlin Act</a> incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from . The population almost doubled and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the <a href="Weimar%20culture">Weimar era</a>, Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties, but also became a renowned centre of the <a href="Roaring%20Twenties">Roaring Twenties</a>. The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government and industries. <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20for%20Physics">Nobel Prize for Physics</a> in 1921.

In 1933 <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> <a href="Nazi%20seizure%20of%20power">came to power</a>. NSDAP rule diminished Berlin's Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to about 80,000 as a result of emigration between 1933 and 1939. After <a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a> in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby <a href="Sachsenhausen%20concentration%20camp">Sachsenhausen concentration camp</a>. Starting in early 1943, many were shipped to <a href="death%20camp">death camp</a>s, such as <a href="Auschwitz">Auschwitz</a>. During World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed in <a href="Battle%20of%20Berlin%20%28air%29">the 1943–45 air raids</a> and during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Berlin">Battle of Berlin</a>. Around 125,000 civilians were killed. After the <a href="end%20of%20World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe">end of the war in Europe</a> in May 1945, Berlin received large numbers of refugees from the Eastern provinces. The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the <a href="Allied-occupied%20Germany">occupation zones</a> into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Western Allies</a> (the United States, the United Kingdom and France) formed <a href="West%20Berlin">West Berlin</a>, while the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet sector</a> formed <a href="East%20Berlin">East Berlin</a>.

All four <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> imposed a <a href="Berlin%20Blockade">blockade</a> on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The <a href="Berlin%20airlift">Berlin airlift</a>, conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949. In 1949 the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the <a href="Marxist-Leninist">Marxist-Leninist</a> <a href="East%20Germany">German Democratic Republic</a> was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.

The founding of the two German states increased <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move that was not recognised by the western powers. East Berlin included most of the historic centre of the city. The West German government established itself in <a href="Bonn">Bonn</a>. In 1961 East Germany began the building of the <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a> between East and West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at <a href="Checkpoint%20Charlie">Checkpoint Charlie</a>. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany. <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> gave his ""<a href="Ich%20bin%20ein%20Berliner">Ich bin ein Berliner</a>"" speech in 1963 underlining the US support for the Western part of the city. Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass from one to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the government of East Germany. In 1971, a <a href="Four%20Power%20Agreement%20on%20Berlin">Four-Power agreement</a> guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.

In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the <a href="East%20Side%20Gallery">East Side Gallery</a> preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were <a href="German%20reunification">reunified</a> as the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin again became the official German capital. In 1991, the German Parliament, the <a href="Bundestag">Bundestag</a>, <a href="Decision%20on%20the%20Capital%20of%20Germany">voted to move the seat</a> of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999. On 18 June 1994 soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the final withdrawal of foreign troops allowing a <a href="German%20reunification%23Reunified%20Berlin">reunified Berlin</a>. <a href="Berlin%27s%202001%20administrative%20reform">Berlin's 2001 administrative reform</a> merged several districts. The number of boroughs was reduced from 23 to 12. In 2006, the <a href="2006%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Final">FIFA World Cup Final</a> was held in Berlin.

Berlin is situated in northeastern <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat <a href="topography">topography</a>, part of the vast <a href="Northern%20European%20Plain">Northern European Plain</a> which stretches all the way from northern <a href="France">France</a> to western <a href="Russia">Russia</a>. The "Berliner Urstromtal" (an ice age <a href="glacial%20valley">glacial valley</a>), between the low <a href="Barnim%20Plateau">Barnim Plateau</a> to the north and the <a href="Teltow%20plateau">Teltow Plateau</a> to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last <a href="Weichselian%20glaciation">Weichselian glaciation</a>. The <a href="Spree">Spree</a> follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river <a href="Havel">Havel</a>, which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the <a href="Gro%C3%9Fer%20Wannsee">Großer Wannsee</a>. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the <a href="M%C3%BCggelsee">Großer Müggelsee</a> in eastern Berlin.

Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs <a href="Reinickendorf">Reinickendorf</a> and <a href="Pankow">Pankow</a> lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of <a href="Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf">Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf</a>, <a href="Steglitz-Zehlendorf">Steglitz-Zehlendorf</a>, <a href="Tempelhof-Sch%C3%B6neberg">Tempelhof-Schöneberg</a>, and <a href="Neuk%C3%B6lln">Neukölln</a> lie on the Teltow Plateau.

The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. Since 2015, the highest elevation in Berlin is found on the Arkenberge hills in Pankow, at . Through the dumping of construction debris, they surpassed <a href="Teufelsberg">Teufelsberg</a> (), a <a href="Schuttberg">hill made of rubble</a> from the ruins of the Second World War. The highest natural elevation is found on the <a href="M%C3%BCggelberge">Müggelberge</a> at , and the lowest at the Spektesee in Spandau, at .

Berlin has a <a href="Oceanic%20climate">Maritime temperate climate</a> ("Cfb") according to the <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> system. There are significant influences of mild continental climate due to its inland position, with frosts being common in winter and there being larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many oceanic climates. Furthermore, Berlin is classified as a <a href="Temperate%20climate">temperate</a> <a href="humid%20continental%20climate">continental climate</a> ("Dc") under the <a href="Trewartha%20climate%20classification">Trewartha climate scheme</a>.

Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of and lows of . Winters are cool with average high temperatures of and lows of . Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin's built-up area creates a microclimate, with <a href="urban%20heat%20island">heat stored by the city's buildings and pavement</a>. Temperatures can be higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.

Annual precipitation is with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Snowfall mainly occurs from December through March.

Berlin's history has left the city with a <a href="polycentrism">polycentric organization</a> and a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings. The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin the Kingdom of Prussia, the 1871 German Empire, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.

Berlin was devastated by <a href="Bombing%20of%20Berlin%20in%20World%20War%20II">bombing raids</a>, fires and street battles during World War II, and many of the buildings that had remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Many <a href="Ornament%20%28art%29">ornaments</a> of pre-war buildings were destroyed following <a href="Ornament%20and%20Crime">modernist dogmas</a>. While in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) <a href="Reconstruction%20%28architecture%29">reconstructed</a>, including the "Forum Fridericianum" with e.g., the <a href="Berlin%20State%20Opera">State Opera</a> (1955), <a href="Charlottenburg%20Palace">Charlottenburg Palace</a> (1957), the main monuments of the <a href="Gendarmenmarkt">Gendarmenmarkt</a> (1980s), <a href="Alte%20Kommandantur">Kommandantur</a> (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque façades of the <a href="City%20Palace%2C%20Berlin">City Palace</a>. A number of new buildings are inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as <a href="Hotel%20Adlon">Hotel Adlon</a>.

Clusters of <a href="List%20of%20tallest%20buildings%20in%20Berlin">high-rise buildings</a> emerge at disperse locations, e.g. <a href="Potsdamer%20Platz">Potsdamer Platz</a>, <a href="City%20West">City West</a>, and <a href="Alexanderplatz">Alexanderplatz</a>, the latter two representing the previous centers of West and East Berlin, respectively, and the former representing the new Berlin of the 21st century built upon the previous no-man's land of the Berlin Wall.

Its name commemorates the <a href="Uprising%20of%201953%20in%20East%20Germany">uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953</a>. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the <a href="Siegess%C3%A4ule">Siegessäule</a> (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.

In 2014 the German capital registered a migration surplus of approximately 40,000 people.

National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, following the revocation of the <a href="Edict%20of%20Nantes">Edict of Nantes</a> in France, the city responded with the <a href="Edict%20of%20Potsdam">Edict of Potsdam</a>, which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The <a href="Greater%20Berlin%20Act">Greater Berlin Act</a> in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9 million to 4 million.
Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Currently, Berlin is home to about 200,000 <a href="Turks%20in%20Germany">Turks</a>, making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey. In the 1990s the "Aussiedlergesetze" enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Today ethnic <a href="History%20of%20Germans%20in%20Russia%20and%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Germans</a> from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community. The last decade experienced an influx from various Western countries and some African regions. A portion of the African immigrants have settled in the <a href="Afrikanisches%20Viertel">Afrikanisches Viertel</a>. Young Germans, EU-Europeans and Israelis have also settled in the city.

Berlinerisch or Berlinisch is not a dialect linguistically, but has features of <a href="Lausitzisch-neum%C3%A4rkisch%20dialects">Lausitzisch-neumärkisch dialects</a>. It is spoken in Berlin and the <a href="Berlin/Brandenburg%20Metropolitan%20Region">surrounding metropolitan area</a>.

The dialect is now seen more as a <a href="sociolect">sociolect</a>, largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak <a href="standard%20German">standard German</a> in everyday life.

The most-commonly-spoken foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, English, Russian, Arabic, Polish, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian, Italian, Vietnamese, and French. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian are heard more often in the western part, due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. English, Vietnamese, Russian, and Polish have more native speakers in East Berlin.

More than 60% of Berlin residents have no registered religious affiliation. The largest denomination in 2010 was the <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a href="Landeskirche">regional church body</a> – the <a href="Evangelical%20Church%20of%20Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian%20Upper%20Lusatia">Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg-Silesian Upper Lusatia (EKBO)</a> – a <a href="United%20church">United church</a>.

Since <a href="German%20reunification">the reunification</a> on 3 October 1990, Berlin has been one of the three <a href="States%20of%20Germany%23Subdivisions">city states in Germany</a> among the present 16 states of Germany. The <a href="Abgeordnetenhaus%20von%20Berlin">House of Representatives</a> ("Abgeordnetenhaus") functions as the city and state parliament, which currently has 141 seats. Berlin's executive body is the <a href="Senate%20of%20Berlin">Senate of Berlin</a> ("Senat von Berlin"). The Senate consists of the <a href="List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Berlin">Governing Mayor</a> ("Regierender Bürgermeister") and up to eight senators holding ministerial positions, one of them holding the title of "Mayor" ("Bürgermeister") as deputy to the Governing Mayor. The total annual state budget of Berlin in 2015 exceeded €24.5 ($30.0) billion including a budget surplus of €205 ($240) million.

Berlin is subdivided into 12 boroughs or districts ("Bezirke"). Each borough is made up by a number of subdistricts or neighborhoods ("Ortsteile"), which have historic roots in much older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. These subdistricts became urbanized and incorporated into the city later on. Many residents strongly identify with their neighbourhoods, colloquially called "<a href="Kiez">Kiez</a>". At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.

Each borough is governed by a borough council ("Bezirksamt") consisting of five councilors ("Bezirksstadträte") including the borough's mayor ("Bezirksbürgermeister"). The council is elected by the borough assembly ("Bezirksverordnetenversammlung"). However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. The borough's mayors make up the council of mayors ("Rat der Bürgermeister"), which is led by the city's Governing Mayor and advises the Senate. The neighborhoods have no local government bodies.

Berlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities. <a href="Twin%20towns%20and%20sister%20cities">Town twinning</a> between Berlin and other cities began with its sister city Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification but later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the Western World, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> and its allies.

There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as <a href="Beirut">Beirut</a>, <a href="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a>, <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a>, <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, <a href="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, <a href="Seoul">Seoul</a>, <a href="Sofia">Sofia</a>, <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>.

The cityscape of Berlin displays large quantities of urban <a href="street%20art">street art</a>. It has become a significant part of the city's cultural heritage and has its roots in the graffiti scene of <a href="Kreuzberg">Kreuzberg</a> of the 1980s. The <a href="Berlin%20Wall%20graffiti%20art">Berlin Wall</a> itself has become one of the largest open-air canvasses in the world. The leftover stretch along the Spree river in <a href="Friedrichshain">Friedrichshain</a> remains as the <a href="East%20Side%20Gallery">East Side Gallery</a>.

Berlin's nightlife has been celebrated as one of the most diverse and vibrant of its kind. In the 1970s and 80s the <a href="SO36">SO36</a> in <a href="Kreuzberg">Kreuzberg</a> was a centre for <a href="punk%20music">punk music</a> and culture. The "SOUND" and the "Dschungel" gained notoriety. Throughout the 1990s, people in their 20s from all over the world, particularly those in <a href="Western%20Europe">Western</a> and <a href="Central%20Europe">Central Europe</a>, made Berlin's club scene a premier nightlife venue. After the <a href="fall%20of%20the%20Berlin%20Wall">fall of the Berlin Wall</a> in 1989, many historic buildings in Mitte, the former city centre of East Berlin, were illegally occupied and re-built by young squatters and became a fertile ground for underground and <a href="counterculture">counterculture</a> gatherings. The central boroughs are home to many nightclubs, including the Watergate, <a href="Tresor">Tresor</a>, <a href="E-Werk">E-Werk</a> and <a href="Berghain">Berghain</a>.

Clubs are not required to close at a fixed time during the weekends, and many parties last well into the morning, or even all weekend. The "Berghain" features the well-known "Panorama Bar", a bar that opens its shades at daybreak, allowing party-goers a panorama view of Berlin after dancing through the night. The "Weekend Club" near <a href="Alexanderplatz">Alexanderplatz</a> features a roof terrace that allows partying at night.

Benjamin Lee Whorf

Benjamin Lee Whorf (; April 24, 1897 – July 26, 1941) was an American <a href="Linguistics">linguist</a> and <a href="fire%20prevention">fire prevention</a> engineer. Whorf is widely known as an advocate for the idea that differences between the structures of different languages shape how their speakers perceive and conceptualize the world. This principle has frequently been called the "<a href="Sapir%E2%80%93Whorf%20hypothesis">Sapir–Whorf hypothesis</a>", after him and his mentor <a href="Edward%20Sapir">Edward Sapir</a>, but Whorf called it the principle of <a href="linguistic%20relativity">linguistic relativity</a>, because he saw the idea as having implications similar to <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Einstein's</a> principle of <a href="general%20relativity">physical relativity</a>.

Throughout his life Whorf was a chemical engineer by profession, but as a young man he took up an interest in linguistics. At first this interest drew him to the study of <a href="Biblical%20Hebrew">Biblical Hebrew</a>, but he quickly went on to study the indigenous languages of <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a> on his own. Professional scholars were impressed by his work and in 1930 he received a grant to study the <a href="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a> language in Mexico; on his return home he presented several influential papers on the language at linguistics conferences.

This led him to begin studying linguistics with Edward Sapir at <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> while still maintaining his day job at the <a href="Hartford%20Fire%20Insurance%20Company">Hartford Fire Insurance Company</a>. During his time at Yale he worked on the description of the <a href="Hopi%20language">Hopi language</a>, and the <a href="historical%20linguistics">historical linguistics</a> of the <a href="Uto-Aztecan%20languages">Uto-Aztecan languages</a>, publishing many influential papers in professional journals. He was chosen as the substitute for Sapir during his medical leave in 1938. Whorf taught his seminar on "Problems of American Indian Linguistics". In addition to his well-known work on linguistic relativity, he wrote a grammar sketch of Hopi and studies of <a href="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a> dialects, proposed a deciphering of <a href="Maya%20script">Maya hieroglyphic writing</a>, and published the first attempt towards a reconstruction of Uto-Aztecan.

After his death from cancer in 1941 his manuscripts were curated by his linguist friends who also worked to spread the influence of Whorf's ideas on the relation between language, culture and cognition. Many of his works were published posthumously in the first decades after his death. In the 1960s Whorf's views fell out of favor and he became the subject of harsh criticisms by scholars who considered language structure to primarily reflect cognitive universals rather than cultural differences. Critics argued that Whorf's ideas were untestable and poorly formulated and that they were based on badly analyzed or misunderstood data.

In the late 20th century, interest in Whorf's ideas experienced a resurgence, and a new generation of scholars began reading Whorf's works, arguing that previous critiques had only engaged superficially with Whorf's actual ideas, or had attributed to him ideas he had never expressed. The field of linguistic relativity studies remains an active focus of research in <a href="psycholinguistics">psycholinguistics</a> and <a href="linguistic%20anthropology">linguistic anthropology</a>, and continues to generate debate and controversy between proponents of relativism and proponents of universalism. By comparison, Whorf's other work in linguistics, the development of such concepts as the <a href="allophone">allophone</a> and the <a href="cryptotype">cryptotype</a>, and the formulation of "<a href="Whorf%27s%20law">Whorf's law</a>" in Uto-Aztecan historical linguistics, have met with broad acceptance.

The son of Harry Church Whorf and Sarah Edna Lee Whorf, Benjamin Lee Whorf was born on April 24, 1897 in <a href="Winthrop%2C%20Massachusetts">Winthrop, Massachusetts</a>. Harry Church Whorf was an artist, intellectual and designer – first working as a commercial artist and later as a dramatist. Benjamin had two younger brothers, John and <a href="Richard%20Whorf">Richard</a>, who both went on to become notable artists. John became an internationally renowned painter and illustrator; Richard was an actor in films such as "<a href="Yankee%20Doodle%20Dandy">Yankee Doodle Dandy</a>" and later an <a href="Emmy">Emmy</a>-nominated television director of such shows as "<a href="The%20Beverly%20Hillbillies">The Beverly Hillbillies</a>". Benjamin was the intellectual of the three and at a young age he conducted chemical experiments with his father's photographic equipment. He was also an avid reader, interested in botany, astrology, and Middle American prehistory. He read <a href="William%20H.%20Prescott">William H. Prescott</a>'s "<a href="William%20H.%20Prescott%23The%20Conquest%20of%20Mexico">Conquest of Mexico</a>" several times. At the age of 17 he began to keep a copious diary in which he recorded his thoughts and dreams.

Whorf graduated from the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> in 1918 with a degree in <a href="chemical%20engineering">chemical engineering</a> where his academic performance was of average quality. In 1920 he married Celia Inez Peckham, who became the mother of his three children, Raymond Ben, Robert Peckham and Celia Lee. Around the same time he began work as a fire prevention engineer (an inspector) for the <a href="The%20Hartford">Hartford Fire Insurance Company</a>. He was particularly good at the job and was highly commended by his employers. His job required him to travel to production facilities throughout New England to be inspected. One anecdote describes him arriving at a chemical plant in which he was denied access by the director because he would not allow anyone to see the production procedure which was a trade secret. Having been told what the plant produced, Whorf wrote a chemical formula on a piece of paper, saying to the director: "I think this is what you're doing". The surprised director asked Whorf how he knew about the secret procedure, and he simply answered: "You couldn't do it in any other way."

Whorf helped to attract new customers to the Fire Insurance Company; they favored his thorough inspections and recommendations. Another famous anecdote from his job was used by Whorf to argue that language use affects habitual behavior. Whorf described a workplace in which full gasoline drums were stored in one room and empty ones in another; he said that because of flammable vapor the "empty" drums were more dangerous than those that were full, although workers handled them less carefully to the point that they smoked in the room with "empty" drums, but not in the room with full ones. Whorf argued that by habitually speaking of the vapor-filled drums as empty and by extension as inert, the workers were oblivious to the risk posed by smoking near the "empty drums".

Whorf was a spiritual man throughout his lifetime although what religion he followed has been the subject of debate. As a young man he produced a manuscript titled "Why I have discarded <a href="evolution">evolution</a>", causing some scholars to describe him as a devout <a href="Methodist%20Episcopalian">Methodist Episcopalian</a>, who was impressed with <a href="fundamentalism">fundamentalism</a>, and perhaps supportive of <a href="creationism">creationism</a>. However, throughout his life Whorf's main religious interest was <a href="theosophy">theosophy</a>, a nonsectarian organization based on <a href="Buddhist">Buddhist</a> and <a href="Hinduism">Hindu</a> teachings that promotes the view of the <a href="holism">world as an interconnected whole</a> and the unity and brotherhood of humankind "without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or color". Some scholars have argued that the conflict between spiritual and scientific inclinations have been a driving force in Whorf's intellectual development, particularly in the attraction by ideas of linguistic relativity. Some of Whorf's unpublished manuscripts on spirituality also suggest that he was influenced by the ideas of <a href="Helena%20Blavatsky">Helena Blavatsky</a> the founder of the <a href="Theosophical%20Society">Theosophical Society</a> who wrote about <a href="Madame%20Blavatsky%23Cosmic%20evolution">cosmic evolution</a>, a belief that regards <a href="reincarnation">reincarnation</a> to be the source of evolution of human races towards continuously higher forms. Whorf said that "of all groups of people with whom I have come in contact, Theosophical people seem the most capable of becoming excited about ideas—new ideas."

Around 1924 Whorf first became interested in <a href="linguistics">linguistics</a>. Originally he analyzed Biblical texts, seeking to uncover hidden layers of meaning. Inspired by the <a href="esoteric">esoteric</a> work "La langue hebraïque restituée" by <a href="Fabre%20d%27Olivet">Antoine Fabre d'Olivet</a>, he began a semantic and grammatical analysis of <a href="Biblical%20Hebrew">Biblical Hebrew</a>. Whorf's early manuscripts on Hebrew and Maya have been described as exhibiting a considerable degree of <a href="mysticism">mysticism</a>, as he sought to uncover esoteric meanings of glyphs and letters.

Whorf studied Biblical linguistics mainly at the Watkinson Library (now <a href="Hartford%20Public%20Library">Hartford Public Library</a>). This library had an extensive collection of materials about <a href="Indigenous%20languages%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American linguistics</a> and <a href="folklore">folklore</a>, originally collected by <a href="James%20Hammond%20Trumbull">James Hammond Trumbull</a>. It was at the Watkinson library that Whorf became friends with the young boy, <a href="John%20Bissell%20Carroll">John B. Carroll</a>, who later went on to study psychology under <a href="B.%20F.%20Skinner">B. F. Skinner</a>, and who in 1956 edited and published a selection of Whorf's essays as "Language, Thought and Reality" . The collection rekindled Whorf's interest in <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>n antiquity. He began studying the <a href="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a> language in 1925, and later, beginning in 1928, he studied the collections of <a href="Maya%20script">Maya hieroglyphic texts</a>. Quickly becoming conversant with the materials, he began a scholarly dialog with Mesoamericanists such as <a href="Alfred%20Tozzer">Alfred Tozzer</a>, the Maya archaeologist at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>, and <a href="Herbert%20J.%20Spinden">Herbert J. Spinden</a> of the <a href="Brooklyn%20Museum">Brooklyn Museum</a>.

In 1928 he first presented a paper at the International Congress of Americanists in which he presented his translation of a Nahuatl document held at the <a href="Peabody%20Museum%20of%20Archaeology%20and%20Ethnology">Peabody Museum</a> at Harvard. He also began to study the comparative linguistics of the <a href="Uto-Aztecan%20languages">Uto-Aztecan language family</a>, which <a href="Edward%20Sapir">Edward Sapir</a> had recently demonstrated to be a linguistic family. In addition to Nahuatl, Whorf studied the <a href="Piman%20languages">Piman</a> and <a href="Tepecano%20language">Tepecano language</a>s, while in close correspondence with linguist <a href="J.%20Alden%20Mason">J. Alden Mason</a>.

Because of the promise shown by his work on Uto-Aztecan, Tozzer and Spinden advised Whorf to apply for a grant with the <a href="Social%20Science%20Research%20Council">Social Science Research Council</a> (SSRC) to support his research. Whorf considered using the money to travel to Mexico to procure Aztec manuscripts for the Watkinson library, but Tozzer suggested he spend the time in Mexico documenting modern <a href="Nahuatl%20dialects">Nahuatl dialects</a>. In his application Whorf proposed to establish the oligosynthetic nature of the Nahuatl language. Before leaving Whorf presented the paper "Stem series in Maya" at the <a href="Linguistic%20Society%20of%20America">Linguistic Society of America</a> conference, in which he argued that in the <a href="Mayan%20languages">Mayan languages</a> syllables carry symbolic content. The SSRC awarded Whorf the grant and in 1930 he traveled to <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> where Professor <a href="R.%20H.%20Barlow">Robert H Barlow</a> put him in contact with several speakers of Nahuatl to serve as his informants, among whom were <a href="Mariano%20Rojas">Mariano Rojas</a> of <a href="Tepoztl%C3%A1n">Tepoztlán</a> and <a href="Luz%20Jimenez">Luz Jimenez</a> of <a href="Milpa%20Alta">Milpa Alta</a>. The outcome of the trip to Mexico was Whorf's sketch of Milpa Alta Nahuatl, published only after his death, and an article on a series of <a href="Aztec%20writing">Aztec pictograms</a> found at the <a href="Tepozteco">Tepozteco</a> monument at Tepoztlán, <a href="Morelos">Morelos</a> in which he noted similarities in form and meaning between Aztec and Maya day signs.

Until his return from Mexico in 1930 Whorf had been entirely an <a href="Autodidacticism">autodidact</a> in linguistic theory and field methodology, yet he had already made a name for himself in Middle American linguistics. Whorf had met Sapir, the leading US linguist of the day, at professional conferences, and in 1931 Sapir came to <a href="Yale%20University">Yale</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> to take a position as Professor of <a href="Anthropology">Anthropology</a>. Alfred Tozzer sent Sapir a copy of Whorf's paper on "Nahuatl tones and saltillo". Sapir replied stating that it "should by all means be published"; however, it was not until 1993 that it was prepared for publication by <a href="Lyle%20Campbell">Lyle Campbell</a> and <a href="Frances%20Karttunen">Frances Karttunen</a>.

Whorf took Sapir's first course at Yale on "American Indian Linguistics". He enrolled in a program of graduate studies, nominally working towards a PhD in linguistics, but he never actually attempted to obtain a degree, satisfying himself with participating in the intellectual community around Sapir. At Yale, Whorf joined the circle of Sapir's students that included such luminary linguists as <a href="Morris%20Swadesh">Morris Swadesh</a>, <a href="Mary%20Haas">Mary Haas</a>, <a href="Harry%20Hoijer">Harry Hoijer</a>, <a href="G.%20L.%20Trager">G. L. Trager</a> and <a href="Charles%20F.%20Voegelin">Charles F. Voegelin</a>. Whorf took on a central role among Sapir's students and was well respected.

Sapir had a profound influence on Whorf's thinking. Sapir's earliest writings had espoused views of the relation between thought and language stemming from the <a href="Wilhelm%20von%20Humboldt">Humboldtian</a> tradition he acquired through <a href="Franz%20Boas">Franz Boas</a>, which regarded language as the historical embodiment of "volksgeist", or ethnic world view. But Sapir had since become influenced by a current of <a href="logical%20positivism">logical positivism</a>, such as that of <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> and the early <a href="Ludwig%20Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>, particularly through <a href="C.%20K.%20Ogden">Ogden</a> and <a href="I.%20A.%20Richards">Richards'</a> "<a href="The%20Meaning%20of%20Meaning">The Meaning of Meaning</a>", from which he adopted the view that natural language potentially obscures, rather than facilitates, the mind to perceive and describe the world as it really is. In this view, proper perception could only be accomplished through <a href="formal%20logic">formal logic</a>s. During his stay at Yale, Whorf acquired this current of thought partly from Sapir and partly through his own readings of Russell and Ogden and Richards. As Whorf became more influenced by positivist science he also distanced himself from some approaches to language and meaning that he saw as lacking in rigor and insight. One of these was Polish philosopher <a href="Alfred%20Korzybski">Alfred Korzybski</a>'s <a href="General%20semantics">General semantics</a>, which was espoused in the US by <a href="Stuart%20Chase">Stuart Chase</a>. Chase admired Whorf's work and frequently sought out a reluctant Whorf, who considered Chase to be "utterly incompetent by training and background to handle such a subject." Ironically, Chase would later write the foreword for Carroll's collection of Whorf's writings.

Sapir also encouraged Whorf to continue his work on the <a href="historical%20linguistics">historical</a> and <a href="descriptive%20linguistics">descriptive linguistics</a> of Uto-Aztecan. Whorf published several articles on that topic in this period, some of them with G. L. Trager, who had become his close friend. Whorf took a special interest in the <a href="Hopi%20language">Hopi language</a> and started working with Ernest Naquayouma, a speaker of Hopi from Toreva village living in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, New York. Whorf credited Naquayouma as the source of most of his information on the Hopi language, although in 1938 he took a short field trip to the village of Mishongnovi, on the <a href="Second%20Mesa">Second Mesa</a> of the <a href="Hopi%20Reservation">Hopi Reservation</a> in <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>.

In 1936, Whorf was appointed Honorary Research Fellow in Anthropology at Yale, and he was invited by <a href="Franz%20Boas">Franz Boas</a> to serve on the committee of the Society of American Linguistics (later <a href="Linguistic%20Society%20of%20America">Linguistic Society of America</a>). In 1937, Yale awarded him the Sterling Fellowship. He was a Lecturer in Anthropology from 1937 through 1938, replacing Sapir, who was gravely ill. Whorf gave graduate level lectures on "Problems of American Indian Linguistics". In 1938 with Trager's assistance he elaborated a report on the progress of linguistic research at the department of anthropology at Yale. The report includes some of Whorf's influential contributions to linguistic theory, such as the concept of the <a href="allophone">allophone</a> and of <a href="cryptotype">covert grammatical categories</a>. has argued, that in this report Whorf's linguistic theories exist in a condensed form, and that it was mainly through this report that Whorf exerted influence on the discipline of descriptive linguistics.

In late 1938, Whorf's own health declined. After an operation for cancer he fell into an unproductive period. He was also deeply influenced by Sapir's death in early 1939. It was in the writings of his last two years that he laid out the research program of <a href="Linguistic%20relativity">Linguistic relativity</a>. His 1939 memorial article for Sapir, "The Relation of Habitual Thought And Behavior to Language", in particular has been taken to be Whorf's definitive statement of the issue, and is his most frequently quoted piece.

In his last year Whorf also published three articles in the "<a href="MIT%20Technology%20Review">MIT Technology Review</a>" titled "Science and Linguistics", "Linguistics as an Exact Science" and "Language and Logic". He was also invited to contribute an article to a theosophical journal, "Theosophist", published in <a href="Chennai">Madras</a>, <a href="India">India</a>, for which he wrote "Language, Mind and Reality". In these final pieces he offered a critique of Western science in which he suggested that non-European languages often referred to physical phenomena in ways that more directly reflected aspects of reality than many European languages, and that science ought to pay attention to the effects of linguistic categorization in its efforts to describe the physical world. He particularly criticized the <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European languages</a> for promoting a mistaken <a href="essentialist">essentialist</a> world view, which had been disproved by advances in the sciences, whereas he suggested that other languages dedicated more attention to processes and dynamics rather than stable essences. Whorf argued that paying attention to how other physical phenomena are described in the study of linguistics could make valuable contributions to science by pointing out the ways in which certain assumptions about reality are implicit in the structure of language itself, and how language guides the attention of speakers towards certain phenomena in the world which risk becoming overemphasized while leaving other phenomena at risk of being overlooked.

At Whorf's death his friend G. L. Trager was appointed as curator of his unpublished manuscripts. Some of them were published in the years after his death by another of Whorf's friends, <a href="Harry%20Hoijer">Harry Hoijer</a>. In the decade following, Trager and particularly Hoijer did much to popularize Whorf's ideas about linguistic relativity, and it was Hoijer who coined the term "Sapir-Whorf hypothesis" at a 1954 conference. Trager then published an article titled "The systematization of the Whorf hypothesis", which contributed to the idea that Whorf had proposed a hypothesis that should be the basis for a program of empirical research. Hoijer also published studies of Indigenous languages and cultures of the American South West in which Whorf found correspondences between cultural patterns and linguistic ones. The term, even though technically a misnomer, went on to become the most widely known label for Whorf's ideas. According to <a href="John%20A.%20Lucy">John A. Lucy</a> "Whorf's work in linguistics was and still is recognized as being of superb professional quality by linguists".

Whorf's work began to fall out of favor less than a decade after his death, and he was subjected to severe criticism from scholars of language, culture and psychology. In 1953 and 1954 psychologists <a href="Roger%20Brown%20%28psychologist%29">Roger Brown</a> and <a href="Eric%20Lenneberg">Eric Lenneberg</a> criticized Whorf for his reliance on anecdotal evidence, formulating a hypothesis to scientifically test his ideas, which they limited to an examination of a causal relation between grammatical or lexical structure and cognition or perception. Whorf himself did not advocate a straight causality between language and thought; instead he wrote that "Language and culture had grown up together"; that both were mutually shaped by the other. Hence, has argued that because the aim of the formulation of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was to test simple causation, from the outset it failed to test Whorf's ideas.

Focusing on <a href="color%20term">color term</a>inology, with easily discernible differences between perception and vocabulary, Brown and Lenneberg published in 1954 a study of <a href="Zuni%20language">Zuni</a> color terms that slightly support a weak effect of semantic categorization of color terms on color perception. In doing so they began a line of empirical studies that investigated the principle of linguistic relativity.

Empirical testing of the Whorfian hypothesis declined in the 1960s to 1980s as <a href="Noam%20Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> began to redefine linguistics and much of psychology in formal <a href="universalism">universalist</a> terms. Several studies from that period refuted Whorf's hypothesis, demonstrating that linguistic diversity is a surface veneer that masks underlying universal cognitive principles. Many studies were highly critical and disparaging in their language, ridiculing Whorf's analyses and examples or his lack of an academic degree. Throughout the 1980s most mentions of Whorf or of the Sapir-Whorf hypotheses continued to be disparaging, and led to a widespread view that Whorf's ideas had been proven wrong. Because Whorf was treated so severely in the scholarship during those decades, he has been described as "one of the prime whipping boys of introductory texts to linguistics". In the late 1980s, with the advent of <a href="cognitive%20linguistics">cognitive linguistics</a> and <a href="psycholinguistics">psycholinguistics</a> some linguists sought to rehabilitate Whorf's reputation, as scholarship began to question whether earlier critiques of Whorf were justified.

By the 1960s <a href="Analytical%20philosophy">analytical philosophers</a> also became aware of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and philosophers such as <a href="Max%20Black">Max Black</a> and <a href="Donald%20Davidson%20%28philosopher%29">Donald Davidson</a> published scathing critiques of Whorf's strong relativist viewpoints. Black characterized Whorf's ideas about metaphysics as demonstrating "amateurish crudity". According to Black and Davidson, Whorf's viewpoint and the concept of linguistic relativity meant that translation between languages with different conceptual schemes would be impossible. Recent assessments such as those by Leavitt and Lee, however, consider Black and Davidson's interpretation to be based on an inaccurate characterization of Whorf's viewpoint, and even rather absurd given the time he spent trying to translate between different conceptual schemes. In their view the critiques are based on a lack of familiarity with Whorf's writings; according to these recent Whorf scholars a more accurate description of his viewpoint is that he thought translation to be possible, but only through careful attention to the subtle differences between conceptual schemes.

<a href="Eric%20Lenneberg">Eric Lenneberg</a>, <a href="Noam%20Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>, and <a href="Steven%20Pinker">Steven Pinker</a> have also criticized Whorf for failing to be sufficiently clear in his formulation of how language influences thought, and for failing to provide real evidence to support his assumptions. Generally Whorf's arguments took the form of examples that were anecdotal or speculative, and functioned as attempts to show how "exotic" grammatical traits were connected to what were considered equally exotic worlds of thought. Even Whorf's defenders admitted that his writing style was often convoluted and couched in neologisms – attributed to his awareness of language use, and his reluctance to use terminology that might have pre-existing connotations. argues that Whorf was mesmerized by the foreignness of indigenous languages, and exaggerated and idealized them. According to <a href="George%20Lakoff">Lakoff</a>, Whorf's tendency to exoticize data must be judged in the historical context: Whorf and the other Boasians wrote at a time in which <a href="racism">racism</a> and <a href="jingoism">jingoism</a> were predominant, and when it was unthinkable to many that "savages" had redeeming qualities, or that their languages were comparable in complexity to those of Europe. For this alone Lakoff argues, Whorf can be considered to be "Not just a pioneer in linguistics, but a pioneer as a human being".

Today many followers of universalist schools of thought continue to oppose the idea of linguistic relativity, seeing it as unsound or even ridiculous. For example, Steven Pinker argues in his book "<a href="The%20Language%20Instinct">The Language Instinct</a>" that thought exists prior to language and independently of it, a view also espoused by philosophers of language such as <a href="Jerry%20Fodor">Jerry Fodor</a>, <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a> and <a href="Plato">Plato</a>. In this interpretation, language is inconsequential to human thought because humans do not think in "natural" language, i.e. any language used for communication. Rather, we think in a meta-language that precedes natural language, which Pinker following Fodor calls "<a href="Language%20of%20thought%20hypothesis">mentalese</a>." Pinker attacks what he calls "Whorf's radical position", declaring, "the more you examine Whorf's arguments, the less sense they make." Scholars of a more "relativist" bent such as <a href="John%20A.%20Lucy">John A. Lucy</a> and <a href="Stephen%20C.%20Levinson">Stephen C. Levinson</a> have criticized Pinker for misrepresenting Whorf's views and arguing against <a href="Strawman%20fallacy">strawmen</a>.

Linguistic relativity studies have experienced a resurgence since the 1990s, and a series of favorable experimental results have brought Whorfianism back into favor, especially in <a href="cultural%20psychology">cultural psychology</a> and <a href="linguistic%20anthropology">linguistic anthropology</a>. The first study directing positive attention towards Whorf's relativist position was <a href="George%20Lakoff">George Lakoff</a>'s "Women, Fire and Dangerous Things", in which he argued that Whorf had been on the right track in his focus on differences in grammatical and lexical categories as a source of differences in conceptualization. In 1992 psychologist John A. Lucy published two books on the topic, one analyzing the intellectual genealogy of the hypothesis, arguing that previous studies had failed to appreciate the subtleties of Whorf's thinking; they had been unable to formulate a research agenda that would actually test Whorf's claims. Lucy proposed a new research design so that the hypothesis of linguistic relativity could be tested empirically, and to avoid the pitfalls of earlier studies which Lucy claimed had tended to presuppose the universality of the categories they were studying. His second book was an empirical study of the relation between grammatical categories and cognition in the <a href="Yucatec%20Maya%20language">Yucatec Maya language</a> of <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>.

In 1996 Penny Lee's reappraisal of Whorf's writings was published, reinstating Whorf as a serious and capable thinker. Lee argued that previous explorations of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis had largely ignored Whorf's actual writings, and consequently asked questions very unlike those Whorf had asked. Also in that year a volume, "Rethinking Linguistic Relativity" edited by <a href="John%20J.%20Gumperz">John J. Gumperz</a> and <a href="Stephen%20C.%20Levinson">Stephen C. Levinson</a> gathered a range of researchers working in <a href="psycholinguistics">psycholinguistics</a>, <a href="sociolinguistics">sociolinguistics</a> and <a href="linguistic%20anthropology">linguistic anthropology</a> to bring renewed attention to the issue of how Whorf's theories could be updated, and a subsequent review of the new direction of the linguistic relativity paradigm cemented the development. Since then considerable empirical research into linguistic relativity has been carried out, especially at the <a href="Max%20Planck%20Institute%20for%20Psycholinguistics">Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics</a> with scholarship motivating two edited volumes of linguistic relativity studies, and in American Institutions by scholars such as <a href="Lera%20Boroditsky">Lera Boroditsky</a> and <a href="Dedre%20Gentner">Dedre Gentner</a>.

In turn universalist scholars frequently dismiss as "dull" or "boring", positive findings of influence of linguistic categories on thought or behavior, which are often subtle rather than spectacular, suggesting that Whorf's excitement about linguistic relativity had promised more spectacular findings than it was able to provide.

Whorf's views have been compared to those of philosophers such as <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> and the late <a href="Ludwig%20Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>, both of whom considered language to have important bearing on thought and reasoning. His hypotheses have also been compared to the views of psychologists such as <a href="Lev%20Vygotsky">Lev Vygotsky</a>, whose <a href="social%20constructivism">social constructivism</a> considers the cognitive development of children to be mediated by the social use of language. Vygotsky shared Whorf's interest in gestalt psychology, and he also read Sapir's works. Others have seen similarities between Whorf's work and the ideas of literary theorist <a href="Mikhail%20Bakhtin">Mikhail Bakhtin</a>, who read Whorf and whose approach to textual meaning was similarly holistic and relativistic. Whorf's ideas have also been interpreted as a radical critique of <a href="Positivism">positivist</a> science.

Whorf is best known as the main proponent of what he called the principle of linguistic relativity, but which is often known as "the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis", named for him and Edward Sapir. Whorf never stated the principle in the form of a hypothesis, and the idea that linguistic categories influence perception and cognition was shared by many other scholars before him. But because Whorf, in his articles, gave specific examples of how he saw the grammatical categories of specific languages related to conceptual and behavioral patterns, he pointed towards an empirical research program that has been taken up by subsequent scholars, and which is often called "Sapir-Whorf studies".

Whorf and Sapir both drew explicitly on <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s principle of <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>; hence linguistic relativity refers to the concept of grammatical and semantic categories of a specific language providing a frame of reference as a medium through which observations are made. Following an original observation by Boas, Sapir demonstrated that speakers of a given language perceive sounds that are acoustically different as the same, if the sound comes from the underlying <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a> and does not contribute to changes in semantic meaning. Furthermore, speakers of languages are attentive to sounds, particularly if the same two sounds come from different phonemes. Such differentiation is an example of how various observational frames of reference leads to different patterns of attention and perception.

Whorf was also influenced by <a href="gestalt%20psychology">gestalt psychology</a>, believing that languages require their speakers to describe the same events as different gestalt constructions, which he called "isolates from experience". An example is how the action of cleaning a gun is different in English and <a href="Shawnee%20language">Shawnee</a>: English focuses on the instrumental relation between two objects and the purpose of the action (removing dirt); whereas the Shawnee language focuses on the movement—using an arm to create a dry space in a hole. The event described is the same, but the attention in terms of <a href="Figure-ground%20%28perception%29">figure and ground</a> are different.

If read superficially, some of Whorf's statements lend themselves to the interpretation that he supported <a href="linguistic%20determinism">linguistic determinism</a>. For example, in an often-quoted passage Whorf writes:
The statements about the obligatory nature of the terms of language have been taken to suggest that Whorf meant that language completely determined the scope of possible conceptualizations. However neo-Whorfians argue that here Whorf is writing about the terms in which we speak of the world, not the terms in which we think of it. Whorf noted that to communicate thoughts and experiences with members of a <a href="speech%20community">speech community</a> speakers must use the linguistic categories of their shared language, which requires moulding experiences into the shape of language to speak them—a process called "thinking for speaking". This interpretation is supported by Whorf's subsequent statement that "No individual is free to describe nature with absolute impartiality, but is constrained by certain modes of interpretation even when he thinks himself most free". Similarly the statement that observers are led to different pictures of the universe has been understood as an argument that different conceptualizations are incommensurable making translation between different conceptual and linguistic systems impossible. Neo-Whorfians argue this to be is a misreading since throughout his work one of his main points was that such systems could be "calibrated" and thereby be made commensurable, but only when we become aware of the differences in conceptual schemes through linguistic analysis.

Whorf's study of Hopi time has been the most widely discussed and criticized example of linguistic relativity. In his analysis he argues that there is a relation between how the <a href="Hopi">Hopi</a> people conceptualize time, how they speak of temporal relations, and the grammar of the Hopi language. Whorf's most elaborate argument for the existence of linguistic relativity was based on what he saw as a fundamental difference in the understanding of time as a conceptual category among the Hopi. He argued that the Hopi language, in contrast to English and other <a href="Standard%20Average%20European">SAE languages</a>, does not treat the flow of time as a sequence of distinct countable instances, like "three days" or "five years", but rather as a single process. Because of this difference, the language lacks nouns that refer to units of time. He proposed that the Hopi view of time was fundamental in all aspects of their culture and furthermore explained certain patterns of behavior. In his 1939 memorial essay to Sapir he wrote that “... the Hopi language is seen to contain no words, grammatical forms, construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call 'time', or to past, present, or future...”

Linguist <a href="Ekkehart%20Malotki">Ekkehart Malotki</a> challenged Whorf's analyses of Hopi temporal expressions and concepts with numerous examples how the Hopi language refers to time. Malotki argues that in the Hopi language the system of tenses consists of future and non-future and that the single difference between the three-tense system of European languages and the Hopi system, is that the latter combines past and present to form a single category.

Malotki's critique was widely cited as the final piece of evidence in refuting Whorf's ideas and his concept of linguistic relativity while other scholars defended the analysis of Hopi, arguing that Whorf's claim was not that Hopi lacked words or categories to describe temporality, but that the Hopi concept of time is altogether different from that of English speakers. Whorf described the Hopi categories of <a href="tense%20%28grammar%29">tense</a>, noting that time is not divided into past, present and future, as is common in European languages, but rather a single tense refers to both present and past while another refers to events that have not yet happened and may or may not happen in the future. He also described a large array of stems that he called "tensors" which describes aspects of temporality, but without referring to countable units of time as in English and most European languages.

Whorf's distinction between "overt" (phenotypical) and "covert" (cryptotypical) grammatical categories has become widely influential in linguistics and anthropology. British linguist <a href="Michael%20Halliday">Michael Halliday</a> wrote about Whorf's notion of the "<a href="cryptotype">cryptotype</a>", and the conception of "how grammar models reality", that it would "eventually turn out to be among the major contributions of twentieth century linguistics".

Furthermore, Whorf introduced the concept of the <a href="allophone">allophone</a>, a word that describes positional phonetic variants of a single superordinate phoneme; in doing so he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a> theory. The term was popularized by G. L. Trager and <a href="Bernard%20Bloch%20%28linguist%29">Bernard Bloch</a> in a 1941 paper on English phonology and went on to become part of standard usage within the American structuralist tradition. Whorf considered allophones to be another example of linguistic relativity. The principle of allophony describes how acoustically different sounds can be treated as reflections of a single <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a> in a language. This sometimes makes the different sound appear similar to native speakers of the language, even to the point that they are unable to distinguish them auditorily without special training. Whorf wrote that: "[allophones] are also relativistic. Objectively, acoustically, and physiologically the allophones of [a] phoneme may be extremely unlike, hence the impossibility of determining what is what. You always have to keep the observer in the picture. What linguistic pattern makes like is like, and what it makes unlike is unlike".(Whorf, 1940)

Central to Whorf's inquiries was the approach later described as <a href="metalinguistics">metalinguistics</a> by G. L. Trager, who in 1950 published four of Whorf's essays as "Four articles on Metalinguistics". Whorf was crucially interested in the ways in which speakers come to be aware of the language that they use, and become able to describe and analyze language using language itself to do so. Whorf saw that the ability to arrive at progressively more accurate descriptions of the world hinged partly on the ability to construct a metalanguage to describe how language affects experience, and thus to have the ability to calibrate different conceptual schemes. Whorf's endeavors have since been taken up in the development of the study of <a href="metalinguistics">metalinguistics</a> and <a href="metalinguistic%20awareness">metalinguistic awareness</a>, first by <a href="Michael%20Silverstein">Michael Silverstein</a> who published a radical and influential rereading of Whorf in 1979 and subsequently in the field of <a href="linguistic%20anthropology">linguistic anthropology</a>.

Whorf conducted important work on the <a href="Uto-Aztecan%20languages">Uto-Aztecan languages</a>, which Sapir had conclusively demonstrated as a valid language family in 1915. Working first on Nahuatl, Tepecano, Tohono O'odham he established familiarity with the language group before he met Sapir in 1928. During Whorf's time at Yale he published several articles on Uto-Aztecan linguistics, such as "Notes on the <a href="T%C3%BCbatulabal%20language">Tübatulabal language</a>". In 1935 he published "The Comparative Linguistics of Uto-Aztecan", and a review of <a href="Alfred%20L.%20Kroeber">Kroeber's</a> survey of Uto-Aztecan linguistics. Whorf's work served to further cement the foundations of the comparative Uto-Aztecan studies.

The first Native American language Whorf studied was the Uto-Aztecan language <a href="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a> which he studied first from colonial grammars and documents, and later became the subject of his first field work experience in 1930. Based on his studies of <a href="Classical%20Nahuatl">Classical Nahuatl</a> Whorf argued that Nahuatl was an <a href="oligosynthetic%20language">oligosynthetic language</a>, a typological category that he invented. In Mexico working with native speakers, he studied the dialects of Milpa Alta and Tepoztlán. His grammar sketch of the Milpa Alta dialect of Nahuatl was not published during his lifetime, but it was published posthumously by <a href="Harry%20Hoijer">Harry Hoijer</a> and became quite influential and used as the basic description of "<a href="Nahuatl%20dialects">Modern Nahuatl</a>" by many scholars. The description of the dialect is quite condensed and in some places difficult to understand because of Whorf's propensity of inventing his own unique terminology for grammatical concepts, but the work has generally been considered to be technically advanced. He also produced an analysis of the <a href="prosody%20%28linguistics%29">prosody</a> of these dialects which he related to the history of the glottal stop and vowel length in Nahuan languages. This work was prepared for publication by Lyle Campbell and Frances Karttunen in 1993, who also considered it a valuable description of the two endangered dialects, and the only one of its kind to include detailed phonetic analysis of <a href="Segment%20%28linguistics%29">supra-segmental</a> phenomena.

In Uto-Aztecan linguistics one of Whorf's achievements was to determine the reason the Nahuatl language has the phoneme , not found in the other languages of the family. The existence of in Nahuatl had puzzled previous linguists and caused Sapir to reconstruct a phoneme for proto-Uto-Aztecan based only on evidence from Aztecan. In a 1937 paper published in the journal <a href="American%20Anthropologist">American Anthropologist</a>, Whorf argued that the phoneme resulted from some of the <a href="Nahuan%20languages">Nahuan or Aztecan languages</a> having undergone a <a href="sound%20change">sound change</a> from the original * to in the position before *. This <a href="sound%20law">sound law</a> is known as "<a href="Whorf%27s%20law">Whorf's law</a>", considered valid although a more detailed understanding of the precise conditions under which it took place has since been developed.

Also in 1937, Whorf and his friend G. L. Trager, published a paper in which they elaborated on the <a href="Aztec-Tanoan%20languages">Azteco-Tanoan</a> <a href="language%20family">language family</a>, proposed originally by Sapir as a family comprising the Uto-Aztecan and the Kiowa-<a href="Tanoan%20languages">Tanoan languages</a>—(the <a href="Tewa%20language">Tewa</a> and <a href="Kiowa%20language">Kiowa language</a>s).

In a series of published and unpublished studies in the 1930s, Whorf argued that Mayan writing was to some extent phonetic. While his work on deciphering the Maya script gained some support from Alfred Tozzer at Harvard, the main authority on Ancient Maya culture, <a href="J.E.S.%20Thompson">J.E.S. Thompson</a>, strongly rejected Whorf's ideas, saying that Mayan writing lacked a phonetic component and is therefore impossible to decipher based on a linguistic analysis. Whorf argued that it was exactly the reluctance to apply linguistic analysis of Maya languages that had held the decipherment back. Whorf sought for cues to phonetic values within the elements of the specific signs, and never realized that the system was logo-syllabic. Although Whorf's approach to understanding the Maya script is now known to have been misguided, his central claim that the script was phonetic and should be deciphered as such was vindicated by <a href="Yuri%20Knorozov">Yuri Knorozov</a>'s syllabic decipherment of Mayan writing in the 1950s.
