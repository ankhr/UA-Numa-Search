Barcelona

Barcelona (, ) is the capital and largest city of <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, an <a href="Autonomous%20communities%20of%20Spain">autonomous community</a> in <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, and the country's <a href="List%20of%20municipalities%20of%20Spain">second most populous municipality</a>, with a population of 1.6 million within city limits. Its <a href="urban%20area">urban area</a> extends beyond the administrative city limits with a population of around 4.7 million people, being the <a href="Largest%20urban%20areas%20of%20the%20European%20Union">sixth most populous urban area</a> in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> after <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, the <a href="Ruhr">Ruhr area</a> and <a href="Milan">Milan</a>. It is the largest metropolis on the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers <a href="Llobregat">Llobregat</a> and <a href="Bes%C3%B2s%20%28river%29">Besòs</a>, and bounded to the west by the <a href="Serra%20de%20Collserola">Serra de Collserola</a> mountain range, the tallest peak of which is high.

Founded as a Roman city, in the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the <a href="County%20of%20Barcelona">County of Barcelona</a>. After merging with the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Aragon">Kingdom of Aragon</a>, Barcelona continued to be an important city in the <a href="Crown%20of%20Aragon">Crown of Aragon</a> as an economic and administrative centre of this Crown and the capital of the <a href="Principality%20of%20Catalonia">Principality of Catalonia</a>. Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of <a href="Antoni%20Gaud%C3%AD">Antoni Gaudí</a> and <a href="Llu%C3%ADs%20Dom%C3%A8nech%20i%20Montaner">Lluís Domènech i Montaner</a>, which have been designated UNESCO <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>s. The headquarters of the <a href="Union%20for%20the%20Mediterranean">Union for the Mediterranean</a> is located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the <a href="1992%20Summer%20Olympics">1992 Summer Olympics</a> as well as world-class <a href="Barcelona%23Trade%20fair%20and%20exhibitions">conferences and expositions</a> and also many <a href="Sport%20in%20Barcelona%23International%20tournaments">international sport tournaments</a>.

Barcelona is one of the world's leading tourist, economic, trade fair and cultural centres, and its influence in commerce, education, entertainment, media, fashion, science, and the arts all contribute to its status as one of the <a href="global%20city">world's major global cities</a>. It is a major cultural and economic centre in <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">southwestern Europe</a>, 24th in the world (before <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, after <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>) and a financial centre. In 2008 it was the <a href="List%20of%20cities%20by%20GDP%23Top%2010%20cities%20in%20the%20European%20Union">fourth most economically powerful city by GDP</a> in the European Union and 35th in the world with GDP amounting to €177 billion. In 2012 Barcelona had a GDP of $170 billion; it is leading Spain in both <a href="employment%20rate">employment rate</a> and GDP per capita change. 

In 2009 the city was ranked Europe's third and one of the world's most successful as a city brand. In the same year the city was ranked Europe's fourth best city for business and fastest improving European city, with growth improved by 17% per year, and the city has been experiencing strong and renewed growth for the past three years. Since 2011 Barcelona has been a leading <a href="smart%20city">smart city</a> in Europe. Barcelona is a <a href="transport%20hub">transport hub</a>, with the <a href="Port%20of%20Barcelona">Port of Barcelona</a> being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest European passenger port, an international airport, <a href="Barcelona%E2%80%93El%20Prat%20Airport">Barcelona–El Prat Airport</a>, which handles over 40 million passengers per year, an <a href="Barcelona%23Roads%20and%20highways">extensive motorway network</a>, and a <a href="high-speed%20rail">high-speed rail</a> line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.

The name "Barcelona" comes from the ancient Iberian "Barkeno", attested in an ancient coin inscription found on the right side of the coin in <a href="Iberian%20scripts">Iberian script</a> as , in <a href="ancient%20Greek">ancient Greek</a> sources as , "Barkinṓn"; and in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> as "Barcino", "Barcilonum" and "Barcenona".

Some older sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general <a href="Hamilcar%20Barca">Hamilcar Barca</a>, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC, but there is no evidence that Barcelona was ever a Carthaginian settlement, or that its name in antiquity, "Barcino", had any connection with the <a href="Barcid">Barcid</a> family of Hamilcar.
During <a href="Middle%20Ages">the Middle Ages</a>, the city was variously known as "Barchinona", "Barçalona", "Barchelonaa", and "Barchenona".

Internationally, Barcelona's name is wrongly abbreviated to 'Barça'. However, this name refers only to <a href="FC%20Barcelona">FC Barcelona</a>, the football club. The common abbreviated form used by locals is "Barna".

Another common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the <a href="IATA%20airport%20code">IATA airport code</a> of the <a href="Barcelona-El%20Prat%20Airport">Barcelona-El Prat Airport</a>.

The city is also referred to as the "Ciutat Comtal" in <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan</a>, and "Ciudad Condal" in Spanish, owing to its past as the seat of the <a href="Count%20of%20Barcelona">Count of Barcelona</a>.

The origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early settlement have been 
found, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC. The founding of Barcelona is the subject of two different legends. The first attributes the founding of the city to the mythological <a href="Hercules">Hercules</a>. The second legend attributes the foundation of the city directly to the historical <a href="Carthage">Carthaginian</a> general, <a href="Hamilcar%20Barca">Hamilcar Barca</a>, father of <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a>, who supposedly named the city "Barcino" after his family in the 3rd century BC, but there is no historical or linguistic evidence that this is true.

In about 15 BC, the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Romans</a> redrew the town as a "<a href="castra">castrum</a>" (Roman military camp) centred on the ""Mons Taber"", a little hill near the contemporary city hall (<a href="Pla%C3%A7a%20de%20Sant%20Jaume">Plaça de Sant Jaume</a>). Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of "Faventia", or, in full, "Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino" or "Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino". <a href="Pomponius%20Mela">Pomponius Mela</a> mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour "<a href="Tarragona">Tarraco</a>" (modern <a href="Tarragona">Tarragona</a>), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour. It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens. The city minted its own coins; some from the era of <a href="Galba">Galba</a> survive.
Important Roman vestiges are displayed in <a href="Pla%C3%A7a%20del%20Rei">Plaça del Rei</a> underground, as a part of the <a href="Barcelona%20City%20History%20Museum">Barcelona City History Museum</a> MUHBA; the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the "<a href="El%20G%C3%B2tic">Barri Gòtic</a>" (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral. The cathedral, also known as the Basilica "La Seu", is said to have been founded in 343.

The city was conquered by the <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all <a href="Hispania">Hispania</a>. After being conquered by the <a href="Arabs">Arabs</a> in the early 8th century, it was conquered in 801 by <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>'s son <a href="Louis%20the%20Pious">Louis</a>, who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian "<a href="Marca%20Hispanica">Hispanic March</a>" ("Marca Hispanica"), a <a href="buffer%20zone">buffer zone</a> ruled by the <a href="Counts%20of%20Barcelona">Count of Barcelona</a>.

The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include all of <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, although on 6 July 985, Barcelona was <a href="Looting">sacked</a> by the army of <a href="Almanzor">Almanzor</a>. The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's population was either killed or enslaved. In 1137, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Aragon">Aragon</a> and the <a href="Counts%20of%20Barcelona">County of Barcelona</a> merged in <a href="dynastic%20union">dynastic union</a> by the marriage of <a href="Ramon%20Berenguer%20IV%2C%20Count%20of%20Barcelona">Ramon Berenguer IV</a> and <a href="Petronila%20of%20Aragon">Petronilla of Aragon</a>, their titles finally borne by only one person when their son <a href="Alfonso%20II%20of%20Aragon">Alfonso II of Aragon</a> ascended to the throne in 1162. His territories were later to be known as the <a href="Crown%20of%20Aragon">Crown of Aragon</a>, which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> with outlying territories <a href="Naples">in Naples</a> and Sicily and as far as <a href="Duchy%20of%20Athens">Athens</a> in the 13th century. The forging of a dynastic link between the Crowns of Aragon and <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Castile</a> marked the beginning of Barcelona's decline. The Bank of Barcelona (""), probably the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city <a href="magistrate">magistrate</a>s in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the <a href="Medici%20Bank%23Rise">Bank of Venice</a> (1402) and the <a href="Bank%20of%20Saint%20George">Bank of Genoa</a> (1407).

The marriage of <a href="Ferdinand%20II%20of%20Aragon">Ferdinand II of Aragon</a> and <a href="Isabella%20I%20of%20Castile">Isabella I of Castile</a> in 1469 united the two royal lines. <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> became the centre of political power whilst the colonisation of the Americas reduced the financial importance (at least in relative terms) of Mediterranean trade. Barcelona was a centre of <a href="Catalan%20separatism">Catalan separatism</a>, including the <a href="Catalan%20Revolt">Catalan Revolt</a> (1640–52) against <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20Spain">Philip IV of Spain</a>. The <a href="plague%20%28disease%29">great plague</a> of 1650–1654 halved the city's population.
In the 18th century, a fortress was built at <a href="Montju%C3%AFc">Montjuïc</a> that overlooked the harbour. In 1794, this fortress was used by the French astronomer <a href="Pierre%20M%C3%A9chain">Pierre François André Méchain</a> for observations relating to a survey stretching to <a href="Dunkirk">Dunkirk</a> that provided the official basis of the measurement of a metre. The definitive metre bar, manufactured from platinum, was presented to the French legislative assembly on 22 June 1799. Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Napoleonic wars</a>, but the start of industrialisation saw the fortunes of the province improve. Urban planner <a href="Ildefons%20Cerd%C3%A0">Ildefons Cerdà</a> designed the large <a href="Eixample">Eixample</a> district in the 1850s when the medieval city walls around Barcelona's old town were torn down.

During the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were "collectivized" by the <a href="Confederaci%C3%B3n%20Nacional%20del%20Trabajo">CNT</a> and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of <a href="anarchist">anarchist</a> groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Franco</a>'s <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a> was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> were abolished, and the use of the <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan language</a> in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialised and prosperous, despite the devastation of the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">civil war</a>. The result was a large-scale <a href="immigration">immigration</a> from poorer regions of Spain (particularly <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>, <a href="Murcia">Murcia</a> and <a href="Galicia%20%28Spain%29">Galicia</a>), which in turn led to rapid urbanisation.

In 1992, Barcelona hosted the <a href="1992%20Summer%20Olympics">Summer Olympics</a>. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and two miles of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.

On 17 August 2017, <a href="2017%20Barcelona%20attack">a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla in the city</a>, killing 14 and injuring at least 100. Other attacks took place elsewhere in Catalonia. The Prime Minister of Spain, <a href="Mariano%20Rajoy">Mariano Rajoy</a>, called the attack in Barcelona a <a href="jihadist">jihadist</a> attack. <a href="Amaq%20News%20Agency">Amaq News Agency</a> attributed indirect responsibility for the attack to the <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant</a> (ISIL).

Barcelona is located on the northeast coast of the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, facing the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>, on a <a href="plain">plain</a> approximately wide limited by the mountain range of <a href="Serra%20de%20Collserola">Collserola</a>, the <a href="Llobregat">Llobregat</a> river to the southwest and the <a href="Bes%C3%B2s%20%28river%29">Besòs</a> river to the north. This plain covers an area of , of which are occupied by the city itself. It is south of the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> and the <a href="Catalonia">Catalan</a> border with France.

<a href="Tibidabo">Tibidabo</a>, high, offers striking views over the city and is topped by the <a href="Torre%20de%20Collserola">Torre de Collserola</a>, a <a href="Radio%20masts%20and%20towers">telecommunications tower</a> that is visible from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanised, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as <a href="El%20Carmel">Carmel</a> (), () and Rovira (). The escarpment of <a href="Montju%C3%AFc">Montjuïc</a> (), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by Montjuïc castle, a fortress built in the 17–18th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montjuïc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens.

The city borders on the municipalities of <a href="Santa%20Coloma%20de%20Gramenet">Santa Coloma de Gramenet</a> and <a href="Sant%20Adri%C3%A0%20de%20Bes%C3%B2s">Sant Adrià de Besòs</a> to the north; the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> to the east; <a href="El%20Prat%20de%20Llobregat">El Prat de Llobregat</a> and <a href="L%27Hospitalet%20de%20Llobregat">L'Hospitalet de Llobregat</a> to the south; and <a href="Sant%20Feliu%20de%20Llobregat">Sant Feliu de Llobregat</a>, <a href="Sant%20Just%20Desvern">Sant Just Desvern</a>, <a href="Esplugues%20de%20Llobregat">Esplugues de Llobregat</a>, <a href="Sant%20Cugat%20del%20Vall%C3%A8s">Sant Cugat del Vallès</a>, and <a href="Montcada%20i%20Reixac">Montcada i Reixac</a> to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited <a href="exclave">exclave</a>s to the north-west.

Barcelona has a <a href="humid%20subtropical%20climate">humid subtropical climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen</a> "Cfa") bordering a maritime <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a> ("Csa"), with mild, humid winters and warm to hot summers, while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring.

December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around during the day and at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea, frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. In fact, only 1 day in the last 30 years was recorded with a temperature under the freezing mark, . Snow is infrequent.

Barcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (≥ 1 mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September–November) and lowest in early and mid-summer (June–August), with a secondary winter minimum (February–March). Sunshine duration is 2,524 hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5 hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10 hours of sunshine a day) in July.

According to Barcelona's City Council, Barcelona's population as of 1 January 2016 was 1,608,746 people, on a land area of . It is the main component of an <a href="%C3%80rea%20Metropolitana%20de%20Barcelona">administrative area of Greater Barcelona</a>, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of (density 5,060 hab/km²). The population of the urban area was 4,223,000. It is the central nucleus of the <a href="Barcelona%20metropolitan%20area">Barcelona metropolitan area</a>, which relies on a population of 5,083,000.

<a href="Spanish%20Language">Spanish</a> is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. After Spanish, <a href="Catalan%20language">Catalan language</a> is the second most spoken one in the city, and it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it, thanks to the <a href="language%20immersion">language immersion</a> educational system.

In 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000 people, which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialized parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 with 1,906,998 people, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher <a href="quality%20of%20life">quality of life</a> in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 people, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.

Barcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2 km sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with <a href="Eixample">Eixample</a> being the most populated district.

In the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2 km, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited <a href="Zona%20Franca%20%28Barcelona%29">Zona Franca</a> industrial area and <a href="Montju%C3%AFc">Montjuïc</a> forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.

Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6 km at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square km. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22,7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of <a href="Sagrada%20Fam%C3%ADlia%2C%20Barcelona">la Sagrada Família</a> where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.

In 2016 about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a> and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled cince 1996 when it was 8.6% respectively 3.9%.

The most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from <a href="Italy">Italy</a> (26,676) or <a href="France">France</a> (13,506). Moreover, many migrants come from <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>n nations as <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a> or <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.

There exists a relatively large <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>i community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in <a href="Ciutat%20Vella">Ciutat Vella</a>. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.

Other significant migrant groups come from Asia as from <a href="China">China</a> and the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>. There is a Japanese community clustered in <a href="Bonanova">Bonanova</a>, <a href="Les%20Tres%20Torres">Les Tres Torres</a>, <a href="Pedralbes">Pedralbes</a>, and other northern neighbourhoods, and a <a href="Colegio%20Japon%C3%A9s%20de%20Barcelona">Japanese international school</a> serves that community.

Most of the inhabitants state they are <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> (208 churches). In a 2011 survey conducted by InfoCatólica, 49.5% of Barcelona residents of all ages identified themselves as <a href="Catholic">Catholic</a>. This was the first time that more than half of respondents did not identify themselves as Catholic. The numbers reflect a broader trend in Spain whereby the numbers of self-identified Catholics have declined.

The province has the largest <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim religion. A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to immigration (169 locations, mostly professed by <a href="Moroccans%20in%20Spain">Moroccans in Spain</a>). In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5 million people in the province of Barcelona identified themselves as Muslim, which makes 5.6% of total population.

Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialised early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history.

Borsa de Barcelona ("Barcelona Stock Exchange") is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula.

Barcelona was recognised as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential, by "<a href="FDi%20Magazine">FDi Magazine</a>" in their bi-annual rankings.

Drawing upon its tradition of creative art and craftsmanship, Barcelona is known for its award-winning <a href="industrial%20design">industrial design</a>. It also has several congress halls, notably <a href="Fira%20de%20Barcelona">Fira de Barcelona</a> – the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is , not counting <a href="Gran%20Via%20%28Barcelona%29">Gran Via centre</a> on the <a href="Plaza%20de%20Europa">Plaza de Europa</a>. However, the <a href="Eurozone%20crisis">Eurozone crisis</a> and deep cuts in business travel affected the Council's positioning of the city as a convention centre.

An important business centre, the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20Barcelona">World Trade Center Barcelona</a>, is located in Barcelona's <a href="Port%20Vell">Port Vell</a> harbour.

The city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 "<a href="Exposici%C3%B3n%20Universal%20de%20Barcelona">Exposición Universal de Barcelona</a>", the <a href="1929%20Barcelona%20International%20Exposition">1929 Barcelona International Exposition</a> (Expo 1929), the <a href="2004%20Universal%20Forum%20of%20Cultures">2004 Universal Forum of Cultures</a> and the 2004 <a href="World%20Urban%20Forum">World Urban Forum</a>.

Barcelona was the 20th-most-visited city in the world by international visitors and the fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome, with 5.5 million international visitors in 2011. By 2015, both Prague and Milan had more international visitors. With its <a href="La%20Rambla%2C%20Barcelona">Rambles</a>, Barcelona is ranked the most popular city to visit in Spain.

Barcelona as internationally renowned a tourist destination, with numerous recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world, mild and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>s, 519 hotels as of March 2016 including 35 five star hotels, and developed tourist infrastructure.

Due to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. For this reason, most travel guides recommend that visitors take precautions in order to ensure their possessions' safety, especially inside the metro premises. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of health security and personal safety, mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by <a href="Business%20Insider">Business Insider</a>.

Industry generates 21% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the region, with the energy, chemical and metallurgy industries accounting for 47% of industrial production. The Barcelona metropolitan area had 67% of the total number of industrial establishments in Catalonia as of 1997.

Barcelona has long been an important European automobile manufacturing centre.

Today, the headquarters and a large factory of <a href="SEAT">SEAT</a> (the largest Spanish automobile manufacturer) are in one of its suburbs. There is also a <a href="Nissan%20Motors">Nissan</a> factory in the <a href="Zona%20Franca%20%28Barcelona%29">logistics and industrial area</a> of the city. The factory of <a href="Derbi">Derbi</a>, a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near the city.

As in other modern cities, the <a href="Secondary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy">manufacturing sector</a> has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries are <a href="textiles">textiles</a>, chemical, <a href="pharmaceutical">pharmaceutical</a>, motor, electronic, printing, <a href="logistics">logistics</a>, <a href="publishing">publishing</a>, in <a href="telecommunications">telecommunications</a> industry and culture the notable <a href="Mobile%20World%20Congress">Mobile World Congress</a>, and <a href="information%20technology">information technology</a> services.

The traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a <a href="Fashion%20in%20Barcelona">fashion capital</a>, notably "Gaudi Home".

Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the prestigious <a href="Bread%20and%20Butter%20tradeshow">Bread & Butter urban fashion fair</a> until 2009, when its organisers announced that it would be returning to <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. This was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought €100 m to the city in just three days.

Since 2009, "<a href="The%20Brandery">The Brandery</a>", an urban fashion show, has been held in Barcelona twice a year until 2012. According to the <a href="Global%20Language%20Monitor">Global Language Monitor</a>’s annual ranking of the world's top fifty fashion capitals Barcelona was named as the seventh most important <a href="fashion%20capital">fashion capital</a> of the world right after <a href="Milano">Milano</a> and before <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> in 2015 .

As the capital of the autonomous community of <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the "<a href="Generalitat%20of%20Catalonia">Generalitat de Catalunya</a>"; of particular note are the <a href="Government%20of%20Catalonia">executive branch</a>, the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Catalonia">parliament</a>, and the <a href="Supreme%20court">Supreme Court</a> of <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>. The city is also the capital of the <a href="Province%20of%20Barcelona">Province of Barcelona</a> and the <a href="Barcelon%C3%A8s">Barcelonès</a> <a href="Comarques%20of%20Catalonia">comarca</a> (district).

Barcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, <a href="Municipal%20elections%20in%20Barcelona">elected</a> for a four-year term by <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a>. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the "Carta Municipal" (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.<ref name="ley 1/2006"></ref> According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organised in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administrates the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level. This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions. It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, <a href="road%20traffic%20safety">road safety</a> and <a href="public%20safety">public safety</a>. It also gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government, but that will need a favourable report from the council.

The "Comissió de Govern" (Government Commission) is the executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the <a href="List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Barcelona">Mayor</a>, with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councillors. The plenary, formed by the 41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions. The six "Commissions del Consell Municipal" (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the plenary. The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of <a href="Urban%20planning">city planning</a>, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security through the "<a href="Gu%C3%A0rdia%20Urbana%20de%20Barcelona">Guàrdia Urbana</a>" (the municipal police), city maintenance, gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries, sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and <a href="welfare">social welfare</a>. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central <a href="Government%20of%20Spain">Spanish government</a>. In some fields with shared responsibility (such as public health, education or social services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the Generalitat to plan and manage services.

The executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.

The seat of the city council is on the Plaça de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the <a href="Spanish%20transition%20to%20democracy">coming of the Spanish democracy</a>, Barcelona <a href="Municipal%20elections%20in%20Barcelona">had been governed</a> by the <a href="Socialists%27%20Party%20of%20Catalonia">PSC</a>, first with an <a href="absolute%20majority">absolute majority</a> and later in coalition with <a href="Republican%20Left%20of%20Catalonia">ERC</a> and <a href="Initiative%20for%20Catalonia%20Greens">ICV</a>. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner.

After 32 years, on 22 May 2011, <a href="Convergence%20and%20Union">CiU</a> gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The <a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28Spain%29">PP</a> hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2.

Since 1987, the city has been divided into 10 administrative <a href="Districts%20of%20Barcelona">districts</a> ("districtes" in Catalan, "distritos" in Spanish):

The districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council.

Barcelona has a well-developed higher education system of <a href="public%20university">public universities</a>. Most prominent among these is the <a href="University%20of%20Barcelona">University of Barcelona</a> (established in 1450), a world-renowned research and teaching institution with campuses around the city. Barcelona is also home to the <a href="Polytechnic%20University%20of%20Catalonia">Polytechnic University of Catalonia</a>, and the newer <a href="Pompeu%20Fabra%20University">Pompeu Fabra University</a>, and, in the private sector the <a href="EADA%20Business%20School">EADA Business School</a> founded in 1957, became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. <a href="IESE">IESE Business School</a>, as well as the largest private educational institution, the <a href="Ramon%20Llull%20University">Ramon Llull University</a>, which encompasses internationally prestigious schools and institutes such as the <a href="ESADE">ESADE</a> Business School. The <a href="Autonomous%20University%20of%20Barcelona">Autonomous University of Barcelona</a>, another public university, is located in <a href="Bellaterra">Bellaterra</a>, a town in the <a href="%C3%80mbit%20metropolit%C3%A0%20de%20Barcelona">Metropolitan Area</a>. <a href="Toulouse%20Business%20School">Toulouse Business School</a> and the <a href="Open%20University%20of%20Catalonia">Open University of Catalonia</a> (a private Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona.
The city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as "escoles concertades", they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private ("escoles privades").

The language of instruction at public schools and "escoles concertades" is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or "escola concertada" in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or "escola concertada" offer International Baccalaureate programmes.

Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the <a href="Spanish%20transition%20to%20democracy">arrival of democracy</a>, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the <a href="Spanish%20State">dictatorship of Franco</a>) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a <a href="global%20city">world-class city</a> by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network.

Barcelona has many venues for <a href="Concert">live music</a> and theatre, including the world-renowned <a href="Liceu">Gran Teatre del Liceu</a> opera house, the <a href="Teatre%20Nacional%20de%20Catalunya">Teatre Nacional de Catalunya</a>, the <a href="Teatre%20Lliure">Teatre Lliure</a> and the <a href="Palau%20de%20la%20M%C3%BAsica%20Catalana">Palau de la Música Catalana</a> concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona and Catalonia National <a href="Orchestra">Symphonic Orchestra</a> (Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium ("l'Auditori"). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is <a href="Eiji%20Oue">Eiji Oue</a>. It is home to the <a href="Barcelona%20Guitar%20Orchestra">Barcelona Guitar Orchestra</a>, directed by Sergi Vicente.

Some low-cost airlines, also use <a href="Girona-Costa%20Brava%20Airport">Girona-Costa Brava Airport</a>, about to the north, <a href="Reus%20Airport">Reus Airport</a>, to the south, or <a href="Lleida-Alguaire%20Airport">Lleida-Alguaire Airport</a>, about to the west, of the city. <a href="Sabadell%20Airport">Sabadell Airport</a> is a smaller airport in the nearby town of <a href="Sabadell">Sabadell</a>, devoted to <a href="Flight%20training">pilot training</a>, aerotaxi and private flights.

The <a href="Port%20of%20Barcelona">Port of Barcelona</a> has a 2000-year-old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's ninth largest <a href="containerization">container</a> port, with a trade volume of 1.72 million TEU's in 2013. The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its are divided into three zones: <a href="Port%20Vell">Port Vell</a> (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port (<a href="Barcelona%20Free%20Port">Barcelona Free Port</a>). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the <a href="Llobregat">Llobregat</a> river (1¼ mi) to the south.
The Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a most important Mediterranean turnaround base. In 2013, 3,6 million of pleasure cruises passengers used services of the Port of Barcelona.

The Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the <a href="IMAX">IMAX</a> Port Vell and one of Europe's largest <a href="aquarium">aquarium</a>s – <a href="Aquarium%20Barcelona">Aquarium Barcelona</a>, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays.

Barcelona is a major hub for <a href="RENFE">RENFE</a>, the Spanish state railway network. The city's main <a href="Inter-city%20rail">Inter-city rail</a> <a href="railway%20station">station</a> is <a href="Barcelona%20Sants%20railway%20station">Barcelona Sants railway station</a>, whilst <a href="Estaci%C3%B3%20de%20Fran%C3%A7a">Estació de França</a> terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona.

RENFE's <a href="AVE">AVE</a> <a href="high-speed%20rail">high-speed rail</a> system, which is designed for speeds of , was extended from <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the <a href="Madrid%E2%80%93Barcelona%20high-speed%20rail%20line">Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line</a>. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France (<a href="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="Marseilles">Marseilles</a> and <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>, through <a href="Perpignan%E2%80%93Barcelona%20high-speed%20rail%20line">Perpignan–Barcelona high-speed rail line</a>) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.

Besides RENFE's services, other rail services in the Barcelona area are operated by the <a href="Ferrocarrils%20de%20la%20Generalitat%20de%20Catalunya">Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya</a> (FGC), owned by the Catalan government. The FGC operates largely <a href="commuter%20rail">commuter rail</a> services, but also carries freight to the Port of Barcelona, as well as a number of <a href="rack%20railway">rack railway</a>s and <a href="funicular">funicular</a>s and three of the lines of the Barcelona Metro (see <a href="%23Local%20public%20transport">"local public transport"</a> below).

Barcelona lies on three international routes, including <a href="European%20route%20E15">European route E15</a> that follows the Mediterranean coast, <a href="European%20route%20E90">European route E90</a> to Madrid and Lisbon, and <a href="European%20route%20E09">European route E09</a> to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including <a href="Autov%C3%ADa%20A-2">A-2</a>, <a href="Autov%C3%ADa%20A-7">A-7</a>/<a href="Autopista%20AP-7">AP-7</a>, <a href="C-16%20highway%20%28Spain%29">C-16</a>, <a href="C-17%20highway%20%28Spain%29">C-17</a>, <a href="C-31%20highway%20%28Spain%29">C-31</a>, <a href="C-32%20highway%20%28Spain%29">C-32</a>, <a href="Autopista%20C-33">C-33</a>, <a href="Autovia%20C-60">C-60</a>.

The city is circled by three half <a href="Beltway">ring roads</a> or bypasses, <a href="B20%20motorway%20%28Spain%29">Ronda de Dalt (B-20)</a> (on the mountain side), <a href="B10%20motorway%20%28Spain%29">Ronda del Litoral (B-10)</a> (along the coast) and <a href="Ronda%20del%20Mig">Ronda del Mig</a> (separated into two parts: <a href="Travessera%20de%20Dalt">Travessera de Dalt</a> in the north and the <a href="Gran%20Via%20de%20Carles%20III">Gran Via de Carles III</a>), two partially covered fast highways with several exits that bypass the city.

The city's main arteries include <a href="Avinguda%20Diagonal%2C%20Barcelona">Diagonal Avenue</a>, which crosses it diagonally, <a href="Avinguda%20Meridiana%2C%20Barcelona">Meridiana Avenue</a> which leads to <a href="Pla%C3%A7a%20de%20les%20Gl%C3%B2ries%20Catalanes%2C%20Barcelona">Glòries</a> and connects with Diagonal Avenue and <a href="Gran%20Via%20de%20les%20Corts%20Catalanes%2C%20Barcelona">Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes</a>, which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of <a href="La%20Rambla%2C%20Barcelona">La Rambla</a>, whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route.

The <a href="Estaci%C3%B3%20del%20Nord%20Sports%20Hall">Estació del Nord</a> (Northern Station), a former <a href="railway%20station">railway station</a> which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services.

Barcelona is served by a comprehensive local public transport network that includes a <a href="rapid%20transit">metro</a>, a <a href="bus">bus</a> network, two separate modern tram networks, a separate historic tram line, and several funiculars and <a href="aerial%20tramway">aerial cable cars</a>. Most of these networks and lines form a coordinated fare system, administered by the <a href="Autoritat%20del%20Transport%20Metropolit%C3%A0">Autoritat del Transport Metropolità</a> (ATM), although they are operated by a number of different bodies. This integrated public transport is divided into different zones (1 to 6) and depending on usage various Integrated Travel Cards are available.

The largely underground <a href="Barcelona%20Metro">Barcelona Metro</a> network comprises twelve lines, identified by an "L" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. Eight of these lines are operated on dedicated track by the <a href="Transports%20Metropolitans%20de%20Barcelona">Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona</a> (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the <a href="Ferrocarrils%20de%20la%20Generalitat%20de%20Catalunya">Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya</a> (FGC) and some of them share tracks with that company's commuter lines.

Another company, <a href="TRAMMET">TRAMMET</a>, operates the city's two modern tram networks, known as <a href="Trambaix">Trambaix</a> and <a href="Trambes%C3%B2s">Trambesòs</a>. The historic tram line, the <a href="Tramvia%20Blau">Tramvia Blau</a>, connects the metro (L7, operated by FGC) to the <a href="Funicular%20del%20Tibidabo">Funicular del Tibidabo</a> (operated by TMB). The Funicular de Tibidabo climbs the Tibidabo hill, as does the <a href="Funicular%20de%20Vallvidrera">Funicular de Vallvidrera</a> (FGC). The <a href="Funicular%20de%20Montju%C3%AFc">Funicular de Montjuïc</a> (TMB) climbs the <a href="Montju%C3%AFc">Montjuïc</a> hill. The city has two <a href="aerial%20lift">aerial cable cars</a>: the <a href="Montju%C3%AFc%20Cable%20Car">Montjuïc Cable Car</a> (to the Montjuïc castle) and the <a href="Port%20Vell%20Aerial%20Tramway">Port Vell Aerial Tramway</a> that runs via <a href="Torre%20Jaume%20I">Torre Jaume I</a> and <a href="Torre%20Sant%20Sebastia">Torre Sant Sebastià</a> over the port.

Buses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. A separate private bus line, known as Aerobús, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure.

Barcelona has a <a href="taxicab">metered taxi</a> fleet governed by the Institut Metropolità del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of <a href="Self-employment">self-employed</a> drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many <a href="taxi%20rank">taxi rank</a>s, hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.

On 22 March 2007, Barcelona's City Council started the <a href="Bicing">Bicing service</a>, a bicycle service understood as a public transport. Once the user has their user card, they can take a bicycle from any of the more than 400 stations spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and then leave it at another station. The service has been a success, with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.

The "<a href="El%20G%C3%B2tic">Barri Gòtic</a>" (Catalan for "Gothic Quarter") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan "<a href="Modernisme">modernista</a>" architecture (related to the movement known as <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>s. Especially remarkable is the work of architect <a href="Antoni%20Gaud%C3%AD">Antoni Gaudí</a>, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the <a href="Sagrada%20Fam%C3%ADlia">Sagrada Família</a>, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. , completion is planned for 2026.

Barcelona was also home to <a href="Ludwig%20Mies%20van%20der%20Rohe">Mies van der Rohe</a>'s <a href="Barcelona%20Pavilion">Barcelona Pavilion</a>. Designed in 1929 for the <a href="1929%20Barcelona%20International%20Exposition">International Exposition</a> for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolise modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms "less is more" and "God is in the details." The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986.

Barcelona won the 1999 <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">RIBA</a> <a href="Royal%20Gold%20Medal">Royal Gold Medal</a> for its architecture, the first (and , only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect.

Bandy

Bandy is a <a href="team%20sport">team</a> <a href="winter%20sport">winter sport</a> played on <a href="ice">ice</a>, in which skaters use sticks to direct a ball into the opposing team's goal. Based on the number of participating athletes, bandy is the world's second most popular winter sport after <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a>. Bandy also is the number two winter sport in tickets sold per day of competitions at the sport's world championship compared to the other winter sports.

The sport is considered a form of <a href="hockey">hockey</a> and has a common background with <a href="association%20football">association football</a>, <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> and <a href="field%20hockey">field hockey</a>. Like football, the game is normally played in halves of 45 minutes each, there are eleven players on each team, and the bandy field is about the same size as a football pitch. It is played on ice like ice hockey, but like field hockey, players use bowed sticks and a small ball.

A variant of bandy, <a href="rink%20bandy">rink bandy</a>, is played to the same rules but on a field the size of an ice hockey rink and with fewer people on each team. Rink bandy has in turn led to the creation of the sport <a href="rinkball">rinkball</a>. Bandy is also the predecessor of <a href="floorball">floorball</a>, which was invented when people started playing with plastic bandy-shaped sticks and lightweight balls when running on the floors of indoor gym halls.

Although Russian monasteries have records of games which may be seen as ancestors of bandy in the 10th to 11th centuries, the origin of the sport is debated. Though many Russians see their old countrymen as the creators of the sport, reflected by the unofficial title for bandy, "Russian hockey" (русский хоккей), Russia, England and Wales (see <a href="Bando%20%28sport%29">Bando</a>) each played significant roles in the sport's development.

The name "bandy" likely derives from the <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a> word "Bando", a game played since at least the Middle Ages, and which perhaps is the oldest form of the sport. It was played throughout <a href="Wales">Wales</a> in varying forms and is still played there today. The earliest example of the term "bando" occurs in a dictionary by John Walters published in 1770–94. The game became particularly popular in the <a href="Cynffig">Cynffig</a>-<a href="Margam">Margam</a> district of the <a href="Vale%20of%20Glamorgan">Vale of Glamorgan</a> where wide stretches of sandy beaches afforded ample room for play.

English bandy developed as a winter sport in <a href="the%20Fens">the Fens</a> of <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>. Large expanses of ice would form on the flooded meadows or shallow washes in cold winters, and skating has been a tradition. Members of the <a href="Fen%20skating%23Bandy">Bury Fen Bandy Club</a> published rules of the game in 1882, and introduced it into other countries. The first international match took place in 1891 between Bury Fen and the then Haarlemsche Hockey & Bandy Club from the Netherlands (a club which after a couple of club fusions now is named <a href="HC%20Bloemendaal">HC Bloemendaal</a>). The same year, the National Bandy Association was started in England.

The match recently dubbed "the original bandy match", was actually held in 1875 at <a href="The%20Crystal%20Palace">The Crystal Palace</a> in <a href="London">London</a>. However, at the time, the game was called "hockey on the ice", probably as it was considered an ice variant of <a href="field%20hockey">field hockey</a>.

The first national bandy league was started in Sweden in 1902. Bandy was played at the <a href="Nordic%20Games">Nordic Games</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> and <a href="Oslo">Kristiania</a> (present day Oslo) in 1901, 1903, and 1905 and between Swedish, Finnish and Russian teams at similar games in <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a> in 1907. A <a href="1913%20European%20Bandy%20Championships">European championship</a> was held in 1913 with eight countries participating.

In modern times, Russia has held a top position in the bandy area, both as a founding nation of the <a href="Federation%20of%20International%20Bandy">International Federation</a> in 1955 and fielding the most successful team in the World Championships (when counting the previous Soviet Union team and Russia together). 

The highest altitude where bandy has been played is in the capital of the <a href="Tajikistan">Tajik</a> autonomous province of <a href="Gorno-Badakhshan">Gorno-Badakhshan</a>, <a href="Khorugh">Khorugh</a>.

As a precursor to <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> bandy
has influenced its development and history – mainly in European and former Soviet countries. While modern ice hockey was created in Canada, a game more similar to bandy was played initially, after British soldiers introduced the game in the 19th century. At the same time as modern ice-hockey rules were formalized in <a href="British%20North%20America">British North America</a> (present day Canada), bandy rules were formulated in Europe. A cross between English and Russian rules eventually developed, with the football-inspired English rules dominant, together with the Russian low border along most of the two sidelines.

Before Canadians introduced ice hockey into Europe in the late 19th century, "<a href="hockey">hockey</a>" was another name for bandy, and still is in parts of Russia and Kazakhstan.

With football and bandy being dominant sports in parts of Europe, it was common for sports clubs to have bandy and football sections, with athletes playing both sports at different times of the year. Some examples are English Nottingham Forest Football and Bandy Club (today known just as <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest F.C.</a>) and Norwegian <a href="Str%C3%B8msgodset%20IF">Strømsgodset IF</a> and <a href="Mj%C3%B8ndalen%20IF">Mjøndalen IF</a>, with the latter still having an active bandy section. In Sweden, most football clubs which were active during the first half of the 20th Century, also played bandy. Later, as the season for each sport increased in time, it wasn't as easy for the players to engage in both sports, so some clubs came to concentrate on one or the other. Many old clubs still have both sports on their program.

Both bandy and ice hockey were played in Europe during the 20th century, especially in Sweden, Finland, and Norway. Ice hockey became more popular than bandy in most of Europe mostly because it had become an Olympic sport, while bandy had not. Athletes in Europe who had played bandy switched to ice hockey in the 1920s to compete in the Olympics. The smaller ice fields needed for ice hockey also made its rinks easier to maintain, especially in countries with short winters. On the other hand, ice hockey was not played in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> until the 1950s when the USSR wanted to compete internationally. The typical European style of ice hockey, with flowing, less physical play, represents a heritage of bandy.

The sport's English name comes from the verb "to bandy", from the <a href="Middle%20French">Middle French</a> "bander" ("to strike back and forth"), and originally referred to a 17th-century Irish game similar to field hockey. The curved stick was also called a "bandy".

Old names for bandy are hockey on the ice or hockey on ice. Since the mid-20th century the term bandy is usually preferred to prevent confusion with <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a>.

The sport is known as bandy in many languages though there are a few notable exceptions. In Russian bandy is called "Russian hockey" (русский хоккей) or more frequently "hockey with a ball" (xоккей с мячом) while ice hockey is called "hockey with a puck" (xоккей с шайбой) or more frequently just "hockey". If the context makes it clear that bandy is the subject, it as well can be called just "hockey". In Belarusian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian it is also called "hockey with a ball" (хакей з мячoм, хокей з м'ячем and хокей с топка respectively). In Slovak "bandy hockey" (bandyhokej) is the name. In Armenian, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Mongol and Uzbek, bandy is known as "ball hockey" (Հոկեյ գնդակով, допты хоккей, топтуу хоккей, бөмбөгтэй хоккей and koptokli xokkey respectively). In Finnish the two sports are distinguished as "ice ball" (jääpallo) and "ice puck" (jääkiekko), as well as in Hungarian (jéglabda; jégkorong), although in Hungarian it is more often called "bandy" nowadays. In Estonian bandy is also called "ice ball" (jääpall). In Mandarin Chinese it is "bandy ball" (班迪球). In Scottish Gaelic the name is "ice shinty" (camanachd-deighe).

Bandy is played on ice, using a single round ball. Two teams of 11 players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal using sticks, thereby scoring a goal.

The game is designed to be played on a rectangle of ice the same size as a football field. Bandy also has other rules that are similar to football. Each team has 11 players, one of whom is a <a href="goalkeeper">goalkeeper</a>. The <a href="Offside%20%28sport%29">offside</a> rule is also employed. A goal cannot be scored from a stroke-in or goal throw, but unlike football, a goal cannot be scored directly from a stroke-off or corner stroke. All free strokes are “direct” and allow a goal to be scored without another player touching the ball.

The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner. If both teams have scored an equal number of goals, then, with some exceptions, the game is a draw.

The primary rule is that the players (other than the goalkeepers) may not intentionally touch the ball with their heads, hands or arms during play. Although players usually use their sticks to move the ball around, they may use any part of their bodies other than their heads, hands or arms and may use their skates in a limited manner. Heading the ball results in a five-minute penalty.

In typical game play, players attempt to propel the ball toward their opponents' goal through individual control of the ball, such as by <a href="dribbling">dribbling</a>, passing the ball to a team-mate, and taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through tackling the opponent who controls the ball. However, physical contact between opponents is limited. Bandy is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play, or when play is stopped by the <a href="referee">referee</a>. After a stoppage, play can recommence with a free stroke, a penalty shot or a corner stroke. If the ball has left the field along the sidelines, the referee must decide which team touched the ball last, and award a restart stroke to the opposing team, just like football's throw-in.

The rules do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of player specialisations have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who take the ball from the opposition and pass it to the forwards. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to discern them from the single goalkeeper. These positions are further differentiated by which side of the field the player spends most time in. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in these positions in any combination (for example, there may be three defenders, five midfielders, and two forwards), and the number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders would create a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse would create a slower, more defensive style of play. While players may spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time. The layout of the players on the pitch is called the team's "formation", and defining the team's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team's manager(s).

There are eighteen rules in official play, designed to apply to all levels of bandy, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, veterans or women are permitted. The rules are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The <a href="Bandy%20Playing%20Rules">Bandy Playing Rules</a> can be found on the official website of the <a href="Federation%20of%20International%20Bandy">Federation of International Bandy</a>. and are overseen by the <a href="Rules%20and%20Referee%20Committee">Rules and Referee Committee</a>.

Each team consists of a maximum of 11 players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. A team of fewer than eight players may not start a game. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, and they are only allowed to do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the rules of the game.

Any number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. Substitutions can be performed without notifying the referee and can be performed while the ball is in play. However, if the substitute enters the ice before his teammate has left it, this will result in a five-minute ban. A team can bring at the most four substitutes to the game and one of these is likely to be an extra goalkeeper.

A game is officiated by a referee, the authority and enforcer of the rules, whose decisions are final. The referee may have one or two assistant referees.

The basic equipment players are required to wear includes a pair of <a href="Ice%20skate">skates</a>, a <a href="helmet">helmet</a>, a mouth guard and, in the case of the goalkeeper, a face guard.

The teams must wear uniforms that make it easy to distinguish the two teams. The goal keeper wears distinct colours to single him out from his or her team mates, just as in football. The <a href="Ice%20skate">skates</a>, sticks and any tape on the stick must be of another colour than the ball.

In addition to the aforementioned, various protections are used to protect knees, elbows, genitals and throat. The pants and gloves may contain padding.

The stick used in bandy is an essential part of the sport. It should be made of an approved material such as wood or a similar material and should not contain any metal or sharp parts which can hurt the surrounding players. Sticks are crooked and are available in five angles, where 1 has the smallest bend and 5 has the most. Bend 4 is the most common size in professional bandy. The bandy stick should not have similar colours to the ball, such as orange or pink; it should be no longer than , and no wider than .

A <a href="bandy%20field">bandy field</a> is by , a total of , or about the same size as a <a href="Association%20football%20pitch">football pitch</a> and considerably larger than an <a href="ice%20hockey%20rink">ice hockey rink</a>. Along the sidelines a high border (vant, sarg, wand, wall) is placed to prevent the ball from leaving the ice. It should not be attached to the ice, to glide upon collisions, and should end away from the corners.

Centered at each shortline is a wide and high goal cage and in front of the cage is a half-circular penalty area with a radius. A penalty spot is located in front of the goal and there are two free-stroke spots at the penalty area line, each surrounded by a circle.

A centre spot with a circle of radius denotes the center of the field. A centre-line is drawn through the centre spot parallel with the shortlines.

At each of the corners, a radius quarter-circle is drawn, and a dotted line is painted parallel to the shortline and away from it without extending into the penalty area. The dotted line can be replaced with a long line starting at the edge of the penalty area and extending towards the sideline, from the shortline.

A standard adult bandy match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play; the referee can, however, make allowance for time lost through significant stoppages as described below. There is usually a 15-minute <a href="half-time">half-time</a> break. The end of the match is known as full-time.

The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is commonly referred to as "stoppage time" or "injury time", and must be reported to the match secretary and the two captains. The referee alone signals the end of the match.

If it is very cold or if it is snowing, the match can be broken into thirds of 30 minutes each. At the extremely cold <a href="1999%20Bandy%20World%20Championship">1999 World Championship</a> some matches were played in four periods of 15 minutes each and with extra long breaks in between. In the World Championships the two halves can be 30 minutes each for the nations in the B division.

In league competitions games may end in a draw, but in some knockout competitions if a game is tied at the end of regulation time it may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, the game will be replayed. As an alternative, the extra two times 15-minutes may be played as "golden goal" which means the first team that scores during the extra-time wins the game. If both extra periods are played without a scored goal, a penalty shootout will settle the game. The teams shoot five penalties each and if this doesn't settle the game, the teams shoot one more penalty each until one of them misses and the other scores.

Under the rules, the two basic states of play during a game are "ball in play" and "ball out of play". From the beginning of each playing period with a stroke-off (a set strike from the centre-spot by one team) until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of six restart methods depending on how it went out of play:


If the time runs out while a team is preparing for a free-stroke or penalty, the strike should still be made but it must go into the goal by one shot to count as a goal. Similarly, a goal made via a corner stroke should be allowed, but it must be executed using only one shot in addition to the strike needed to put the ball in play.

Free-strokes can be awarded to a team if a player of the opposite team breaks any rule, for example, by hitting with the stick against the opponent's stick or skates. Free-strokes can also be awarded upon incorrect execution of corner-strikes, free-strikes, goal-throws, and so on. or the use of incorrect equipment, such as a broken stick.

Rather than stopping play, the <a href="referee">referee</a> may allow play to continue when its continuation will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as "playing an advantage". The referee may "call back" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within a short period of time, typically taken to be four to five seconds. Even if an offence is not penalised because the referee plays an advantage, the offender may still be sanctioned (see below) for any associated misconduct at the next stoppage of play.

If a defender violently attacks an opponent within the penalty area, a penalty shot is awarded. Certain other offences, when carried out within the penalty area, result in a penalty shot provided there is a goal situation. These include a defender holding or hooking an attacker, or blocking a goal situation with a lifted skate, thrown stick or glove and so on. Also, the defenders (with the exception of the goal-keeper) are not allowed to kneel or lie on the ice. The final offences that might mandate a penalty shot are those of hitting or blocking an opponent's stick or touching the ball with the hands, arms, stick or head. If any of these actions is carried out in a non-goal situation, they shall be awarded with a free-stroke from one of the free-stroke spots at the penalty area line. A penalty shot should always be accompanied by a 5 or 10 minutes penalty (see below). If the penalty results in a goal, the penalty should be considered personal meaning that a substitute can be sent in for the penalised player. This does not apply in the event of a red card (see below).

A ten-minute penalty is indicated through the use of a blue card and can be caused by protesting or behaving incorrectly, attacking an opponent violently or stopping the ball incorrectly to get an advantage.

The third time a player receives a penalty, it will be a personal penalty, meaning he or she will miss the remainder of the match. A substitute can enter the field after five or ten minutes. A full game penalty can be received upon using abusive language or directly attacking an opponent and means that the player can neither play nor be substituted for the remainder of the game. A <a href="match%20penalty">match penalty</a> is indicated through the use of a red card.

The <a href="offside%20%28bandy%29">offside</a> rule effectively limits the ability of attacking players to remain forward (i.e. closer to the opponent's goal-line) of the ball, the second-to-last defending player (which can include the goalkeeper), and the half-way line. This rule is in effect just like <a href="Offside%20%28association%20football%29">that of soccer</a>.

The <a href="Federation%20of%20International%20Bandy">Federation of International Bandy</a> (FIB) has had 33 members at most. As of April 2017, when Colombia entered, the number is 27. Formed in 1955, the name was changed from "International Bandy Federation" in 2001 after the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> approved it as a so-called "recognized sport"; the abbreviation "IBF" was already used by another recognized sports federation. In 2004, FIB was fully accepted by IOC.

FIB is now a member of <a href="Association%20of%20IOC%20Recognised%20International%20Sports%20Federations">Association of IOC Recognised International Sports Federations</a>.

The <a href="Bandy%20World%20Championship">Bandy World Championship</a> for men is arranged by the FIB and were first held in 1957. It was held every two years starting in 1961 and every year since 2003. Currently the record number of countries participating in the World Championships is eighteen. Since the number of countries playing bandy is not large, every country which can set up a team is welcome to take part in the World Championship. The quality of the teams varies, however, with only six nations, Sweden, <a href="the%20Soviet%20Union">the Soviet Union</a>, Russia, <a href="Finland">Finland</a>, Norway, and <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, having won medals (allowing for the fact that Russia's team took over from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in <a href="Bandy%20World%20Championship%201993">1993</a>). <a href="Finland">Finland</a> won the 2004 world championship in <a href="V%C3%A4ster%C3%A5s">Västerås</a>, Sweden, while all other championships have been won by Sweden, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and Russia.

In February 2004, Sweden won <a href="2004%20Women%27s%20Bandy%20World%20Championship">the first</a> <a href="Women%27s%20Bandy%20World%20Championship">World Championship for women</a>, hosted in <a href="Finland">Finland</a>, without conceding a goal. In <a href="2014%20Women%27s%20Bandy%20World%20Championship">the 2014 women's World Championship</a> Russia won, for the first time toppling the <a href="Swedes">Swedes</a> from the throne. In 2016 Sweden took the title back. In 2018 the tournament will be played in a totally <a href="Asia">Asian</a> country for the first time when <a href="Chengde">Chengde</a> in China will host it. 

The same goes for the men's tournament (the area north and west of the <a href="Ural%20River">Ural River</a> is located in Europe, thus Kazakhstan is a <a href="List%20of%20transcontinental%20countries">transcontinental country</a>), when <a href="Harbin">Harbin</a> will host <a href="2018%20Bandy%20World%20Championship">the 2018 Division B tournament</a>.

There are also <a href="Youth%20Bandy%20World%20Championship">Youth Bandy World Championship</a>s in different age groups for boys and young men and in one age group for girls. The oldest group is the under 23 championship, <a href="Bandy%20World%20Championship%20Y-23">Bandy World Championship Y-23</a>.

Bandy is recognized by the <a href="International%20Olympic%20Committee">International Olympic Committee</a>, and was <a href="Bandy%20at%20the%201952%20Winter%20Olympics">played</a> as a <a href="demonstration%20sport">demonstration sport</a> at the <a href="1952%20Winter%20Olympics">1952 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>. However, it has yet to officially be played at the Olympics. FIB president <a href="Boris%20Skrynnik">Boris Skrynnik</a> lobbied for Bandy to be included in the <a href="2014%20Winter%20Olympics">2014 Winter Olympics</a> in Sochi, given Russia's prominence in the sport. Members of the <a href="Chinese%20Olympic%20Committee">Chinese Olympic Committee</a> were present at the 2017 world championships to meet with Skrynnik about the possibility of considering the sport for the <a href="2022%20Winter%20Olympics">2022 Winter Olympics</a> in Beijing.

At the <a href="Bandy%20at%20the%202011%20Asian%20Winter%20Games">2011 Asian Winter Games</a>, open to members of the <a href="Olympic%20Council%20of%20Asia">Olympic Council of Asia</a>, men's bandy was included for the first time. Three teams contested the inaugural competition, and Kazakhstan won the gold medal.

There was no bandy competition at the <a href="2017%20Asian%20Winter%20Games">2017 Asian Winter Games</a> in Japan.

National teams also meet for friendly games from time to time. <a href="Sweden%20national%20bandy%20team">Sweden</a>, <a href="Finland%20national%20bandy%20team">Finland</a> and <a href="Norway%20national%20bandy%20team">Norway</a> usually played <a href="Russia%20national%20bandy%20team">Russia</a> in the <a href="Russian%20Government%20Cup">Russian Government Cup</a> and these four countries also meet in other four-nation tournaments or singular games arranged from year to year. The United States and Canada meet for friendlies once a year in the <a href="Can-Am%20Bandy%20Cup">Can-Am Bandy Cup</a>.

Central European teams from <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>, Germany, Hungary and the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> met for a <a href="Four%20nation%20bandy%20tournament%20in%202014">four nation competition in January 2014</a> in Davos, Switzerland, an event which is intended to be recurrent. It is called Coupe Norsel and was held for the second time in January 2016.

The World Championships should not be confused with the annual <a href="Bandy%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> in <a href="Ljusdal%20Municipality">Ljusdal</a>, Sweden, which has been played annually since the 1970s and is the biggest bandy tournament for elite level club teams. It was played indoors in <a href="Sandviken%20Municipality">Sandviken</a> from 2009 to 2011 because Ljusdal has no indoor arena. It is expected to return to Ljusdal once an indoor arena has been built. World Cup matches are played day and night, and the tournament is played in four days in late October. The teams participating are mostly, and some years exclusively, from Sweden and Russia who has the two best leagues in the world.

Since 2007, there is also a <a href="Bandy%20World%20Cup%20Women">Bandy World Cup Women</a> for women's teams.

Another club tournament is the <a href="FIB%20Champions%20Cup">Champions Cup</a>. It is a <a href="Season%20%28sports%29">pre-season</a> tournament held in <a href="Edsbyn">Edsbyn</a>, Sweden and features clubs from <a href="Elitserien%20%28bandy%29">Sweden</a> and <a href="Russian%20Bandy%20League">Russia</a>.

The <a href="2017%20Winter%20Universiade">2017 Winter Universiade</a> in <a href="Almaty">Almaty</a> originally planned to have <a href="Bandy%20at%20the%20Winter%20Universiade">bandy as a demonstration sport</a>. After a tightening of the budget, bandy was dropped. However, in <a href="2019%20Winter%20Universiade">Krasnoyarsk 2019</a>, there is a new chance. An indoor stadium will be built for the occasion. FIB and <a href="International%20University%20Sports%20Federation">FISU</a> have signed a cooperation agreement about developing student bandy and in August 2017 International University Sports Federation made bandy a recognised sport.

Two <a href="Bandy%20World%20Championships%20for%20students">World Championships for students</a> is a requirement before being able to become a full medal sport at the Winter Universiade. Therefore, the first tournament was organised in 2016, in <a href="Ulyanovsk">Ulyanovsk</a>.

The <a href="1913%20European%20Bandy%20Championships">1913 European Bandy Championships</a> was held in the Swiss town of <a href="Davos">Davos</a> with <a href="England%20national%20bandy%20team">England</a> victorious.

<a href="Rink%20bandy">Rink bandy</a> is a variety played on an ice hockey-size rink. It was in the programme of the 2012 European Company Sports Games.
Some FIB countries don't have a large ice surface and only play rink bandy at home, in fact most of the World Championships Group B participants.

The <a href="China%20Bandy%20Federation">China Bandy Federation</a> was set up in 2014 and China has since then participated in a number of world championship tournaments, with men's, women's and youth teams. China Bandy is mainly financed by private resources. The development of the sport in China is supported by the <a href="Harbin%20Sport%20University">Harbin Sport University</a>.

The first recorded games of bandy on ice took place in <a href="The%20Fens">The Fens</a> during the great frost of 1813–1814, although it is probable that the game had been played there in the previous century. <a href="Fen%20skating%23Bandy">Bury Fen Bandy Club</a> from <a href="Bluntisham">Bluntisham-cum-Earith</a>, near <a href="St%20Ives%2C%20Cambridgeshire">St Ives</a>, was the most successful team, remaining unbeaten until the winter of 1890–1891. <a href="Charles%20G%20Tebbutt">Charles G Tebbutt</a> of the Bury Fen bandy club was responsible for the first published rules of bandy in 1882, and also for introducing the game into the Netherlands and Sweden, as well as elsewhere in England where it became popular with cricket, rowing and hockey clubs. Tebbutt's home-made bandy stick can be seen in the Norris Museum in St Ives.

The first <a href="Ice%20Hockey%20Varsity%20Match">Ice Hockey Varsity Match</a>es between <a href="Oxford%20University%20Ice%20Hockey%20Club">Oxford University</a> and <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Ice%20Hockey%20Club">Cambridge University</a> were played to bandy rules, even if it was called hockey on ice at the time.

England won the <a href="European%20Bandy%20Championships">European Bandy Championships</a> in 1913, but that turned out to be the grand finale, and bandy is now virtually unknown in England. In March 2004, Norwegian ex-player Edgar Malman invited two big clubs to play a <a href="rink%20bandy">rink bandy</a> exhibition game in Streatham, London. Russian
Champions and World Cup Winner <a href="Vodnik">Vodnik</a> met Swedish Champions <a href="Edsbyns%20IF">Edsbyns IF</a> in a match that ended 10–10. In 2010 England became a <a href="Federation%20of%20International%20Bandy">Federation of International Bandy</a> member. The federation is based in Cambridgeshire, the historical heartland.

The new <a href="England%20Bandy%20Federation">England Bandy Federation</a> was set up on January 2nd 2017 at a meeting held in the historic old skaters public house, the <a href="Lamb%20and%20Flag%2C%20Welney">Lamb and Flag</a> in <a href="Welney">Welney</a> in Norfolk, replacing the Bandy Federation of England which was founded in 2010 but where the activity had been slowing the last years. Chair of England Bandy Federation is Robert Johnson of <a href="Bury%2C%20Cambridgeshire">Bury</a> village where the first bandy matches are recorded and the <a href="Bury%20Fen%20Bandy%20Club">Bury Fen Bandy Club</a> played. (C.G. Tebbutt of BFBC set up the first national association for bandy in 1891.) President is Rev Lyn Gibb-de Swarte of <a href="Littleport%2C%20Cambridgeshire">Littleport</a> and past resident of Streatham in south west London, where she was chair of the ice speed club, ice hockey club and of the association of ice clubs etc. Vice President, Les Mead. Treasurer is Dorothy Johnson and Gen Sec. Karen Mead. Fixtures and Minute Secretary, Cathy Gibb-de Swarte. They are busy promoting the sport for all and will be instituting rink bandy around the country. The president is the project director of the <a href="Littleport%20Ice%20Stadium">Littleport Ice Stadium</a> Project and plans are already drawn for a 400 metres indoor <a href="speed%20skating%20rink">speed skating oval</a> and an inner ice pad 100 x 60 metres <a href="bandy%20field">bandy pitch</a>.

Bandy was played in Estonia in the 1910s to 1930s and the country had a <a href="List%20of%20Estonian%20bandy%20champions">national championship</a> for some years. The national team played friendlies against Finland in the 1920s and '30s. The sport was played sporadically during Soviet occupation 1944-1991. It has since then become more organised again, partly through exchange with Finnish clubs and enthusiasts.

Bandy was introduced to Finland from Russia in the 1890s. Finland has been playing bandy friendlies against Sweden and Estonia since its independence in 1917.

The first <a href="List%20of%20Finnish%20bandy%20champions">Finnish national championships</a> were held in 1908 and was the first national Finnish championship held in any team sport. National champions have been named every year except for three years in the first half of the 20th Century when Finland was at war. The top national league is called <a href="Bandyliiga">Bandyliiga</a> and is semi-professional. The best players often go fully professional by being recruited by clubs in Sweden or Russia.

Bandy was played in Germany in the early 20th Century but the interest died out in favour of ice hockey and football. The sport was reintroduced in the 2010s, with the <a href="German%20Bandy%20Association">German Bandy Association</a> being founded in 2013. A <a href="List%20of%20German%20rink%20bandy%20champions">national rink bandy championship</a> has been played every year since the winter of 2014/15.

India has a national bandy team. <a href="Bandy%20Federation%20of%20India">Bandy Federation of India</a> takes care of bandy in India. Its headquarters is in <a href="Mandi%2C%20Himachal%20Pradesh">Mandi</a> in <a href="Himachal%20Pradesh">Himachal Pradesh</a>. Bandy is generally played in northern India where there is generally snow and ice. India is one of 6 countries in Asia and in total 28 to be a member of <a href="Federation%20of%20International%20Bandy">Federation of International Bandy</a>. BFI planned to send a team to the <a href="Bandy%20at%20the%202011%20Asian%20Winter%20Games">tournament in Astana-Almaty 2011</a>, but ultimately did not.

Bandy has a long history in many parts of the country and it used to be one of the most popular sports in Soviet times. However, after independence it suffered a rapid decline in popularity and only remained in <a href="Oral%2C%20Kazakhstan">Oral</a> (often called by the Russian name, Uralsk), where the country's only professional club <a href="Akzhaiyk">Akzhaiyk</a> is located. They are competing in the Russian second division. Recently bandy has started to gain popularity again outside of Oral, most notably in <a href="Petropavl">Petropavl</a> and <a href="Khromtau">Khromtau</a>. The former capital Almaty has in recent years hosted both the Asian Winter Games (with bandy on the program) as well as the Bandy World Championship in which Kazakhstan finished 3rd. Plans are made to reinvigorate the bandy section of the club Dynamo Almaty, who won the <a href="Russian%20Bandy%20League">Soviet Championships</a> in 1977 and 1990 as well as the <a href="European%20Cup%20%28bandy%29">European Cup</a> in 1978. The <a href="Asian%20Bandy%20Federation">Asian Bandy Federation</a> also has its headquarters in Almaty. Since a few years the state is supporting bandy. <a href="Medeu">Medeu</a> in Almaty is the only arena with artificial ice. A second arena in Almaty was built for the <a href="Bandy%20World%20Championship%202012">World Championship 2012</a>, however, it was taken down afterwards. <a href="Stadion%20Yunost">Stadion Yunost</a> in <a href="Oral%2C%20Kazakhstan">Oral</a> will get artificial ice for the 2017-18 season.

The sport has been taken up in Mongolia. The national team was proud to win the bronze medal of the B division at the <a href="2017%20Bandy%20World%20Championship">2017 Bandy World Championship</a> and had wanted to play bandy at the <a href="2017%20Asian%20Winter%20Games">2017 Asian Winter Games</a>.

Bandy was introduced to the Netherlands in the 1890s by <a href="Pim%20Mulier">Pim Mulier</a> and the sport became popular. However, in the 1920s, the interest turned to ice hockey, but in contrast to other countries in central and western Europe, the sport has been continuosly played in the Netherlands and since the 1970s, the country has become a member of FIB and games have been more formalised again. The national governing body is the <a href="Bandy%20Bond%20Nederland">Bandy Bond Nederland</a>.

Bandy was introduced to Norway in the 1910s. The <a href="Swedes">Swedes</a> contributed largely, and clubs sprang up around the capital of <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>. <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, including neighbouring towns, is still today the region where bandy enjoys most popularity in Norway.

In 1912 the <a href="Norwegians">Norwegians</a> played their first <a href="List%20of%20Norwegian%20bandy%20champions">National Championship</a>, which was played annually up to 1940. During WWII, illegal bandy was played in hidden places in forests, on ponds and lakes. In 1943, −44 and −45, illegal championships were held. In 1946 legal play resumed and still goes on. After WWII the number of teams rose, as well as attendance which regularly were in the thousands, but mild winters in the 1970s and 80s shrunk the league, and in 2003 only 5 clubs (teams) fought out the 1st division with low attendance numbers and little media coverage.

In recent years, the number of artificially frozen pitches have increased in Norway, and more sports clubs have reinvigorated their bandy sections with new men's and youth teams. Because of this, as well as an increase of <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a> players in Norway, the competitiveness of the game has risen, especially in the first division Eliteserien. The adult men's game in Norway today consists of Eliteserien with 8 teams, as well as 3 lower divisions. Bandy in Norway has also started to spread geographically, and while the sport is more popular than <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> in and around the capital <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>, some clubs in apart locations in the 3rd division only have access to <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> rinks and therefore play rink bandy for home games. Compared to the past, attendance is still fairly low, but important Eliteserien matches can attract around 1000 spectators.

In Russia bandy is known as hockey with a ball or simply Russian hockey. A similar game became popular among the Russian nobility in the early 1700s, with the imperial court of <a href="Peter%20the%20Great">Peter the Great</a> playing a predecessor of modern bandy on <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>'s frozen <a href="Neva">Neva</a> river. Russians played this game using ordinary footwear, with sticks made out of juniper wood, only later were skates introduced. It was only in the second half of the 19th century that bandy became popular among the masses throughout the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>. Traditionally the Russians used a longer skate blade than other nations, giving them the advantage of skating faster. However, they would find it more difficult to turn quickly. A bandy skate has a longer blade than a hockey skate, and the "Russian skate" is even longer.

When the Federation of International Bandy was formed in <a href="1955%20in%20sports">1955</a>, with the Soviet Union as one of its founding members, the Russians largely adopted the international rules of the game developed in England in the 19th century, with one notable exception. The other countries adopted the border.

Bandy is considered a <a href="national%20sport">national sport</a> in Russia and is nowadays the third most popular one. It is also the only discipline to have official support of the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a>.

The <a href="Russian%20Bandy%20Super%20League">Russian Bandy Super League</a> is played every year and the winner in the final becomes <a href="List%20of%20Russian%20bandy%20champions">Russian champion</a>. The <a href="Russian%20Cup%20%28bandy%29">Russian Cup</a> has been played annually (except for just some years) since <a href="1937%20in%20sports">1937</a>.

After the victory in the <a href="2016%20Bandy%20World%20Championship">2016 World Championship</a>, the fourth in a row, <a href="President">President</a> <a href="Vladimir%20Putin">Putin</a> received four players of <a href="Russia%20national%20bandy%20team">the national team</a>, <a href="Head%20Coach">Head Coach</a> and <a href="Vice-President">Vice-President</a> of the <a href="Russian%20Bandy%20Federation">Russian Bandy Federation</a> <a href="Sergey%20Myaus">Sergey Myaus</a>, the Russian Bandy Federation as well as <a href="Federation%20of%20International%20Bandy">Federation of International Bandy</a> President <a href="Boris%20Skrynnik">Boris Skrynnik</a> in <a href="The%20Kremlin">The Kremlin</a>. He talked, among other things, about the need to give more support to Russian bandy.<a href="https%3A//translate.google.com/translate%3Fhl%3Den%26amp%3Bsl%3Dru%26amp%3Bu%3Dhttp%3A//kremlin.ru/events/president/news/51359%26amp%3Bprev%3Dsearch"></a> It was the first time a <a href="head%20of%20state">head of state</a> had accepted a meeting to talk about Russian bandy. Attending the meeting were also <a href="Ministry%20of%20Sport%20%28Russia%29">Minister of Sport, Tourism and Youth policy</a> <a href="Vitaly%20Mutko">Vitaly Mutko</a> and presidential adviser <a href="Igor%20Levitin">Igor Levitin</a>.<a href="https%3A//translate.google.com/translate%3Fhl%3Den%26amp%3Bsl%3Dru%26amp%3Btl%3Den%26amp%3Bu%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.redyarsk.ru%252Fnews%252Fdetail.php%253Fid%253D33156"></a> The month after, Igor Levitin held a follow-up meeting.<a href="https%3A//translate.google.com/translate%3Fhl%3Den%26amp%3Bsl%3Dru%26amp%3Btl%3Den%26amp%3Bu%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fkremlin.ru%252Fevents%252Fadministration%252F51520%26amp%3Bsandbox%3D1"></a>

Bandy was introduced to Sweden in 1895. The <a href="Swedish%20royal%20family">Swedish royal family</a>, noblemen and diplomats were the first players. <a href="List%20of%20Swedish%20bandy%20champions">Swedish championships</a> for men have been played annually since 1907. In the 1920s students played the game and it became a largely middle class sport. After <a href="Slottsbrons%20IF">Slottsbrons IF</a> won the Swedish championship in 1934 it became popular amongst workers in the smaller industrial towns and villages. Bandy remains the main sport in many of these places.

Bandy in Sweden is famous for its "culture" – both playing bandy and being a spectator requires great fortitude and dedication. A "bandy briefcase" ("bandyportfölj" in Swedish) is the classic accessory for spectating – it is typically made of brown leather, well worn and contains a warm drink in a thermos and/or a bottle of liquor.
Bandy is most often played at outdoor arenas during winter time, so the need for spectators to carry flasks or thermoses of 'warming' liquid like <a href="gl%C3%B6gg">glögg</a> is a natural effect.

A notable tradition is "<a href="Saint%20Stephen%27s%20Day%20bandy">annandagsbandy</a>", bandy games played on <a href="Saint%20Stephen%27s%20Day">Saint Stephen's Day</a>, which for many <a href="Swedes">Swedes</a> is an important <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> season tradition and always draws bigger crowds than usual. Games traditionally begin at 1:15 pm.

<a href="List%20of%20Swedish%20bandy%20champions">The final match for the Swedish Championship</a> is played every year on the third Saturday of March. From 1991 to 2012, it was played at <a href="Studenternas%20IP">Studenternas Idrottsplats</a> in <a href="Uppsala">Uppsala</a>, often drawing crowds in excess of 20,000. The reason for why the play-off match was set in <a href="Uppsala">Uppsala</a> is because of <a href="IFK%20Uppsala%20Bandy">IFK Uppsala</a> and its success in the beginning of the 20th century. IFK Uppsala won 11 titles in the Swedish Championships between 1907 and 1920, which made them the most successful bandy club in the entire country. Now, however, the record is held by <a href="V%C3%A4ster%C3%A5s%20SK%20Bandy">Västerås SK</a>.

In 2013 and 2014 the final was played indoors in <a href="Friends%20Arena%23Tournaments">Friends Arena</a>, the national stadium for football in <a href="Solna">Solna</a>, <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, with a retractable roof and a capacity of 50 000. From 2015 onwards, <a href="Tele2%20Arena">Tele2 Arena</a> in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> has been chosen instead.

In the late 19th and early 20th Century, Switzerland had become a popular place for winter vacations and people went there from all over Europe. Winter sports like skiing, sledding and bandy was played in Geneva and other towns. Students from Oxford and Cambridge went to Switzerland to play each other – the predecessor of the recurring <a href="Ice%20Hockey%20Varsity%20Match">Ice Hockey Varsity Match</a> was a bandy match played in <a href="St.%20Moritz">St. Moritz</a> in 1885. This popularity for Swiss venues of winter sport may have been a reason, the European Championship was held there in 1913. The Swiss had their own national bandy team by then, which they haven't had since. Bandy is mainly played as a recreational sport in Switzerland nowadays.

Bandy was played in Ukraine when she was part of the Soviet Union. After independence in 1991, it took some years before organised bandy formed again, but <a href="List%20of%20Ukrainian%20bandy%20champions">Ukrainian champions</a> have been named annually since 2012.

Bandy has been played in the United States since around 1980. The activity is mainly centred to Minnesota even if a fan interest also exists in other states. The bandy clubs in the US only have teams but the interest is stable and even if some clubs fold after only some years, other clubs have been around from the start and have a steady following. The United States national bandy team has taken part in the Bandy World Championships since 1985 and is also regularly playing friendlies against Canada.

<a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20bandy%20champions">United States bandy championships</a> have been played annually since the early 1980s, but the league is still not widely followed by sports media in the country.

Booker Prize

The Man Booker Prize for Fiction (formerly known as the Booker-McConnell Prize and commonly known simply as the Booker Prize) is a <a href="Literary%20award">literary prize</a> awarded each year for the best original novel, written in the <a href="English%20language">English language</a> and published in the UK. The winner of the Man Booker Prize is generally assured international renown and success; therefore, the prize is of great significance for the book trade. From its inception, only <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a>, Irish, and South African (and later Zimbabwean) citizens were eligible to receive the prize; in 2014, however, this eligibility was widened to any English-language novel.

A high-profile literary award in <a href="British%20culture">British culture</a>, the Booker Prize is greeted with great anticipation and fanfare. It is also a mark of distinction for authors to be selected for inclusion in the <a href="Short%20list">shortlist</a> or even to be nominated for the "longlist".

The prize was originally known as the Booker–McConnell Prize, after the company <a href="Booker%20Group">Booker, McConnell Ltd</a> began sponsoring the event in 1968; it became commonly known as the "Booker Prize" or simply "the Booker". When administration of the prize was transferred to the Booker Prize Foundation in 2002, the title sponsor became the investment company <a href="Man%20Group">Man Group</a>, which opted to retain "Booker" as part of the official title of the prize. The foundation is an independent registered charity funded by the entire profits of Booker Prize Trading Ltd, of which it is the sole shareholder. The prize money awarded with the Booker Prize was originally £21,000, and was subsequently raised to £50,000 in 2002 under the sponsorship of the Man Group, making it one of the <a href="List%20of%20the%20world%27s%20richest%20literary%20prizes">world's richest literary prizes</a>.

In 1970, <a href="Bernice%20Rubens">Bernice Rubens</a> became the first woman to win the Booker Prize, for "<a href="The%20Elected%20Member">The Elected Member</a>". The rules of the Booker changed in 1971; previously, it had been awarded retrospectively to books published prior to the year in which the award was given. In 1971 the year of eligibility was changed to the same as the year of the award; in effect, this meant that books published in 1970 were not considered for the Booker in either year. The Booker Prize Foundation announced in January 2010 the creation of a special award called the "<a href="Lost%20Man%20Booker%20Prize">Lost Man Booker Prize</a>," with the winner chosen from a longlist of 22 novels published in 1970.

<a href="Alice%20Munro">Alice Munro</a> has a unique place in Booker Prize history; "<a href="The%20Beggar%20Maid">The Beggar Maid</a>" is the only short story collection to have been shortlisted. (It was shortlisted in 1980.)

Before 2001, each year's longlist of nominees was not publicly revealed.

<a href="John%20Sutherland%20%28author%29">John Sutherland</a>, who was a judge for the 1999 prize, has said, 

In 1972, the winning writer <a href="John%20Berger">John Berger</a>, known for his <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a> worldview, protested during his acceptance speech against Booker McConnell. He blamed Booker's 130 years of sugar production in the Caribbean for the region's modern poverty. Berger donated half of his £5,000 prize to the <a href="Black%20Panther%20Party%23Groups%20and%20movements%20inspired%20by%20the%20Black%20Panthers">British Black Panther movement</a>, because they had a socialist and revolutionary perspective in agreement with his own.

In 1980, <a href="Anthony%20Burgess">Anthony Burgess</a>, writer of "<a href="Earthly%20Powers">Earthly Powers</a>", refused to attend the ceremony unless it was confirmed to him in advance whether he had won. His was one of two books considered likely to win, the other being "<a href="Rites%20of%20Passage%20%28novel%29">Rites of Passage</a>" by <a href="William%20Golding">William Golding</a>. The judges decided only 30 minutes before the ceremony, giving the prize to Golding. Both novels had been seen as favourites to win leading up to the prize, and the dramatic "literary battle" between two senior writers made front page news.

1983's judging produced a draw between <a href="J.%20M.%20Coetzee">J. M. Coetzee</a>'s "<a href="Life%20%26amp%3B%20Times%20of%20Michael%20K">Life & Times of Michael K</a>" and <a href="Salman%20Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a>'s "<a href="Shame%20%28Rushdie%20novel%29">Shame</a>", leaving chair of judges <a href="Fay%20Weldon">Fay Weldon</a> to choose between the two. According to Stephen Moss in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", "Her arm was bent and she chose Rushdie" only to change her mind as the result was being phoned through.

In 1993, two of the judges threatened to walk out when "<a href="Trainspotting%20%28novel%29">Trainspotting</a>" appeared on the longlist; <a href="Irvine%20Welsh">Irvine Welsh</a>'s novel was pulled from the shortlist to satisfy them. The novel would later receive critical acclaim, and is now considered Welsh's masterpiece.

The award has been criticised for the types of books it covers. In 1981, nominee <a href="John%20Banville">John Banville</a> wrote a letter to "The Guardian" requesting that the prize be given to him so that he could use the money to buy every copy of the longlisted books in Ireland and donate them to libraries, "thus ensuring that the books not only are bought but also read — surely a unique occurrence."
In 1994, Guardian literary editor <a href="Richard%20Gott">Richard Gott</a>, citing the lack of objective criteria and the exclusion of American authors, described the prize as "a significant and dangerous iceberg in the sea of British culture that serves as a symbol of its current malaise."

In 1997, the decision to award <a href="Arundhati%20Roy">Arundhati Roy</a>'s "<a href="The%20God%20of%20Small%20Things">The God of Small Things</a>" proved controversial. <a href="Carmen%20Callil">Carmen Callil</a>, chair of the previous year's Booker judges, called it an "execrable" book and said on television that it shouldn't even have been on the shortlist. Booker Prize chairman <a href="Martyn%20Goff">Martyn Goff</a> said Roy won because nobody objected, following the rejection by the judges of <a href="Bernard%20MacLaverty">Bernard MacLaverty</a>'s shortlisted book due to their dismissal of him as "a wonderful short-story writer and that "<a href="Grace%20Notes">Grace Notes</a>" was three short stories strung together."

In 2001, <a href="A.%20L.%20Kennedy">A. L. Kennedy</a>, who was a judge in 1996, called the prize "a pile of crooked nonsense" with the winner determined by "who knows who, who's sleeping with who, who's selling drugs to who, who's married to who, whose turn it is".

The Booker prized created a permanent home for the archives from 1968 to present at <a href="Oxford%20Brookes%20University">Oxford Brookes University</a> Library. The Archive, which encompasses the administrative history of the Prize from 1968 to date, collects together a diverse range of material, including correspondence, publicity material, copies of both the Longlists and the Shortlists, minutes of meetings, photographs and material relating to the awards dinner (letters of invitation, guest lists, seating plans). Embargoes of ten or twenty years apply to certain categories of material; examples include all material relating to the judging process and the Longlist prior to 2002.

Between 2005 and 2008, the Booker Prize alternated between writers from Ireland and India. "Outsider" <a href="John%20Banville">John Banville</a> began this trend in 2005 when his novel "<a href="The%20Sea%20%28novel%29">The Sea</a>" was selected as a surprise winner: Boyd Tonkin, literary editor of "The Independent", famously condemned it as "possibly the most perverse decision in the history of the award" and rival novelist <a href="Tibor%20Fischer">Tibor Fischer</a> poured scorn on Banville's victory. <a href="Kiran%20Desai">Kiran Desai</a> of India won in 2006. <a href="Anne%20Enright">Anne Enright</a>'s 2007 victory came about due to a jury badly split over <a href="Ian%20McEwan">Ian McEwan</a>'s novel "<a href="On%20Chesil%20Beach">On Chesil Beach</a>". The following year it was India's turn again, with <a href="Aravind%20Adiga">Aravind Adiga</a> narrowly defeating Enright's fellow Irishman <a href="Sebastian%20Barry">Sebastian Barry</a>.

Historically, the winner of the Man Booker Prize had been required to be a citizen of the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>, the Republic of Ireland, or Zimbabwe. On 18 September 2013, the media announced that future Man Booker Prize awards would consider authors from anywhere in the world, so long as their work was in <a href="English%20language">English</a> and published in the UK. This change proved controversial in literary circles. Former winner <a href="A.%20S.%20Byatt">A. S. Byatt</a> and former judge <a href="John%20Mullan">John Mullan</a> said the prize risked diluting its identity, whereas former judge A. L. Kennedy welcomed the change. Following this expansion, the first winner not from the Commonwealth, Ireland, or Zimbabwe was American <a href="Paul%20Beatty">Paul Beatty</a> in 2016.

The selection process for the winner of the prize commences with the formation of an advisory committee, which includes a writer, two publishers, a literary agent, a bookseller, a librarian, and a chairperson appointed by the Booker Prize Foundation. The advisory committee then selects the judging panel, the membership of which changes each year, although on rare occasions a judge may be selected a second time. Judges are selected from amongst leading literary critics, writers, academics and leading public figures.

The winner is usually announced at a ceremony in London's <a href="Guildhall%2C%20London">Guildhall</a>, usually in early October.

In 1993 to mark the 25th anniversary it was decided to choose a "Booker of Bookers Prize". Three previous judges of the award, <a href="Malcolm%20Bradbury">Malcolm Bradbury</a>, David Holloway and W. L. Webb, met and chose <a href="Salman%20Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a>'s "<a href="Midnight%27s%20Children">Midnight's Children</a>" (the 1981 winner) as "the best novel out of all the winners."

A similar prize known as <a href="The%20Best%20of%20the%20Booker">The Best of the Booker</a> was awarded in 2008 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the prize. A shortlist of six winners was chosen and the decision was left to a public vote. The winner was again "Midnight's Children".

A separate prize for which any living writer in the world may qualify, the <a href="Man%20Booker%20International%20Prize">Man Booker International Prize</a> was inaugurated in 2005. Until 2015, it was given every two years to a living author of any nationality for a body of work published in English or generally available in English translation. In 2016, the award was significantly reconfigured, and is now given annually to a single book in English translation, with a £50,000 prize for the winning title, shared equally between author and translator.

A Russian version of the Booker Prize was created in 1992 called the <a href="Booker-Open%20Russia%20Literary%20Prize">Booker-Open Russia Literary Prize</a>, also known as the Russian Booker Prize. In 2007, Man Group plc established the <a href="Man%20Asian%20Literary%20Prize">Man Asian Literary Prize</a>, an annual literary award given to the best novel by an Asian writer, either written in English or translated into English, and published in the previous calendar year.

As part of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>"' <a href="Cheltenham%20Literature%20Festival">Literature Festival</a> in <a href="Cheltenham">Cheltenham</a>, a Booker event is held on the last Saturday of the festival. Four guest speakers/judges debate a shortlist of four books from a given year from before the introduction of the Booker prize, and a winner is chosen. Unlike the real Man Booker (1969 through 2014), writers from outside the <a href="Commonwealth">Commonwealth</a> are also considered. In 2008, the winner for 1948 was <a href="Alan%20Paton">Alan Paton</a>'s "<a href="Cry%2C%20the%20Beloved%20Country">Cry, the Beloved Country</a>", beating <a href="Norman%20Mailer">Norman Mailer</a>'s "<a href="The%20Naked%20and%20the%20Dead">The Naked and the Dead</a>", <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a>'s "<a href="The%20Heart%20of%20the%20Matter">The Heart of the Matter</a>" and <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>'s "<a href="The%20Loved%20One">The Loved One</a>". In 2015, the winner for 1915 was <a href="Ford%20Maddox%20Ford">Ford Maddox Ford</a>'s "<a href="The%20Good%20Soldier">The Good Soldier</a>", beating "<a href="The%20Thirty-Nine%20Steps">The Thirty-Nine Steps</a>" (<a href="John%20Buchan">John Buchan</a>), "<a href="Of%20Human%20Bondage">Of Human Bondage</a>" (<a href="Somerset%20Maugham">Somerset Maugham</a>), "<a href="Psmith%2C%20Journalist">Psmith, Journalist</a>" (<a href="P.%20G.%20Wodehouse">P.

Book of Joel

The Book of Joel is part of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>. Joel is part of a group of twelve prophetic books known as the <a href="Twelve%20Minor%20Prophets">Twelve Minor Prophets</a>. (The term indicates the short length of the text in relation longer prophetic texts known as the <a href="Major%20Prophets">Major Prophets</a>.)

After a superscription ascribing the prophecy to <a href="Joel%20%28prophet%29">Joel</a> (son of Pethuel), the book may be broken down into the following sections:

As there are no explicit references in the book to datable persons or events, scholars have assigned a wide range of dates to the book. The main positions are:


Evidence produced for these positions are allusions in the book to the wider world, similarities with other prophets, and linguistic details. Other commentators, such as <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>, attach no great importance to the precise dating.

The preservation of the Book of Joel indicates that it was accorded special status by its contemporaries as “the word of the Lord” (1:1). Its history as part of the Jewish and Christian canons followed that of the entire scroll of the <a href="Minor%20Prophets">Minor Prophets</a>.

The <a href="Masoretic%20text">Masoretic text</a> places Joel between <a href="Book%20of%20Hosea">Hosea</a> and <a href="Book%20of%20Amos">Amos</a> (the order inherited by the Tanakh and Old Testament), while the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> order is Hosea–Amos–<a href="Book%20of%20Micah">Micah</a>–Joel–<a href="Book%20of%20Obadiah">Obadiah</a>–<a href="Book%20of%20Jonah">Jonah</a>. The Hebrew text of Joel seems to have suffered little from <a href="Textual%20criticism">scribal transmission</a>, but is at a few points supplemented by the Septuagint, <a href="Peshitta">Syriac</a>, and <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> versions, or by <a href="conjectural%20emendation">conjectural emendation</a>. While the book purports to describe a plague of locusts, some ancient Jewish opinion saw the locusts as <a href="allegory">allegorical</a> interpretations of Israel's enemies. This allegorical interpretation was applied to the church by many <a href="church%20fathers">church fathers</a>. Calvin took a literal interpretation of ch.1, but allegorical view of chapter 2, a position echoed by some modern interpreters. Most modern interpreters, however, see Joel speaking of a literal locust plague given a prophetic/ <a href="Apocalyptic%20literature">apocalyptic</a> interpretation.

The traditional ascription of the whole book to the prophet Joel was challenged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by a theory of a three-stage process of composition: 1:1–2:27 were from the hand of Joel, and dealt with a contemporary issue; 2:28–3:21/3:1–4:21 were ascribed to a continuator with an apocalyptic outlook. Mentions in the first half of the book to the <a href="day%20of%20the%20Lord">day of the Lord</a> were also ascribed to this continuator. 3:4–8/4:4–8 could be seen as even later. Details of exact ascriptions differed between scholars.

This splitting of the book’s composition began to be challenged in the mid-twentieth century, with scholars defending the unity of the book, the plausibility of the prophet combining a contemporary and apocalyptic outlook, and later additions by the prophet. The authenticity of 3:4–8 has presented more challenges, although a number of scholars still defend it.

There are many parallels of language between Joel and other Old Testament prophets. They may represent Joel’s literary use of other prophets, or vice versa.

In the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>, his prophecy of the outpouring of God′s <a href="Holy%20Spirit%20%28Judaism%29">Holy Spirit</a> upon all people was notably quoted by <a href="Saint%20Peter">Saint Peter</a> in his <a href="Pentecost">Pentecost</a> sermon ().

Book of Hosea

The Book of Hosea is one of the books of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>. According to the traditional order of most Hebrew Bibles, it is the first of the twelve <a href="Minor%20Prophets">Minor Prophets</a>.

Set around the fall of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, the Book of Hosea denounces the worship of gods other than Yahweh, metaphorically comparing Israel’s abandonment of Yahweh to a woman being unfaithful to her husband. According to the book’s narrative, the relationship between Hosea and his unfaithful wife Gomer is comparable to the relationship between Yahweh and his unfaithful people Israel. The eventual reconciliation of Hosea and Gomer is treated as a hopeful metaphor for the eventual reconciliation between Yahweh and Israel.

<a href="Hosea">Hosea</a> () prophesied during a dark and melancholic era of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28Samaria%29">Israel</a>'s history, the period of the Northern Kingdom's decline and fall in the 8th century BCE. According to the book, the <a href="apostasy">apostasy</a> of the people was rampant, having turned away from <a href="God%20in%20Abrahamic%20religions">God</a> in order to serve both the calves of <a href="Jeroboam">Jeroboam</a> and <a href="Baal">Baal</a>, a <a href="Canaanite%20religion">Canaanite</a> god. 

The Book of Hosea says that, during Hosea's lifetime, the kings of the Northern Kingdom, their <a href="Aristocracy%20%28class%29">aristocratic</a> supporters, and the priests had led the people away from the <a href="Divine%20law">Law of God</a>, as given in the <a href="Pentateuch">Pentateuch</a>. It says that they forsook the worship of God; they worshiped other gods, especially <a href="Baal">Baal</a>, the <a href="Ancient%20Canaanite%20religion">Canaanite</a> <a href="Weather%20god">storm god</a>, and <a href="Asherah">Asherah</a>, a <a href="Canaan">Canaan</a>ite <a href="List%20of%20fertility%20deities">fertility god</a>. Other <a href="sin">sin</a>s followed, says the Book, including <a href="homicide">homicide</a>, <a href="perjury">perjury</a>, <a href="theft">theft</a>, and <a href="Religion%20and%20sexuality">sexual sin</a>. Hosea declares that unless they repent of these sins, God will allow their nation to be destroyed, and the people will be taken into captivity by <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>, the greatest nation of the time.

The prophecy of Hosea centers around God's unending love towards a sinful Israel. In this text, God's agony is expressed over the betrayal of Israel. Stephen Cook asserts that the prophetic efforts of this book can be summed up in this passage "I have been the Lord your God ever since the land of Egypt; you know no God but me, and besides me there is no savior" () Hosea's job was to speak these words during a time when that had been essentially forgotten.

The Book of Hosea contains a number of YHWH prophecies and messages for both <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28Samaria%29">Northern Israel (Samaria)</a>. These are delivered by the prophet <a href="Hosea">Hosea</a>.

A brief outline of the concepts presented in the Book of Hosea exist below:
No further breakdown of ideas is clear in 4–14:9/14:10
Following this, the prophecy is made that someday this will all be changed, that God will indeed have pity on Israel.

Chapter two describes a divorce. This divorce seems to be the end of the covenant between God and the Northern Kingdom. However, it is probable that this was again a symbolic act, in which Hosea divorced Gomer for infidelity, and used the occasion to preach the message of God's rejection of the Northern Kingdom. He ends this prophecy with the declaration that God will one day renew the covenant, and will take Israel back in love.

In Chapter three, at God's command, Hosea seeks out <a href="Gomer%20%28wife%20of%20Hosea%29">Gomer</a> once more. Either she has sold herself into slavery for debt, or she is with a lover who demands money in order to give her up, because Hosea has to buy her back. He takes her home, but refrains from sexual intimacy with her for many days, to symbolize the fact that Israel will be without a king for many years, but that God will take Israel back, even at a cost to Himself.

Chapters 4–14 spell out the allegory at length. Chapters 1–3 speaks of Hosea's family, and the issues with Gomer. Chapters 4–10 contain a series of oracles, or prophetic sermons, showing exactly why God is rejecting the Northern Kingdom (what the grounds are for the divorce). Chapter 11 is God's lament over the necessity of giving up the Northern Kingdom, which is a large part of the people of Israel, whom God loves. God promises not to give them up entirely. Then, in Chapter 12, the prophet pleads for Israel's repentance. Chapter 13 foretells the destruction of the kingdom at the hands of <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>, because there has been no repentance. In Chapter 14, the prophet urges Israel to seek forgiveness, and promises its restoration, while urging the utmost fidelity to God.

Matthew 2:13 cites Hosea's prophecy in that God would call His Son out of <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> as foretelling the <a href="flight%20into%20Egypt">flight into Egypt</a> and return to Israel of <a href="Saint%20Joseph">Joseph</a>, <a href="Mary%20%28given%20name%29">Maria</a>, and the infant <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>.

The capital of the Northern Kingdom fell in 722 BC. All the members of the upper classes and many of the ordinary people were taken captive and carried off to live as prisoners of war.

First, Hosea was directed by God to marry a <a href="promiscuous%20woman">promiscuous woman</a> of ill-repute, and he did so. Marriage here is symbolic of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. However, Israel has been unfaithful to God by following other gods and breaking the commandments which are the terms of the covenant, hence Israel is symbolized by a harlot who violates the obligations of marriage to her husband.

Second, Hosea and his wife, <a href="Gomer%20%28wife%20of%20Hosea%29">Gomer</a>, have a son. God commands that the son be named Jezreel. This name refers to a <a href="Jezreel%20Valley">valley</a> in which much blood had been shed in Israel's history, especially by the kings of the Northern Kingdom. (See I Kings 21 and II Kings 9:21–35). The naming of this son was to stand as a prophecy against the reigning house of the Northern Kingdom, that they would pay for that bloodshed. Jezreel's name means God Sows.

Third, the couple have a daughter. God commands that she be named <a href="Lo-ruhamah">Lo-ruhamah</a>; Unloved, or, Pity or Pitied On to show Israel that, although God will still have pity on the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Southern Kingdom</a>, God will no longer have pity on the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28Samaria%29">Northern Kingdom</a>; its destruction is imminent. In the NIV translation, the omitting of the word 'him' leads to speculation as to whether Lo-Ruhamah was the daughter of Hosea or one of Gomer's lovers. <a href="James%20Luther%20Mays">James Mays</a>, however, says that the failure to mention Hosea's paternity is "hardly an implication" of Gomer's adultery.

Fourth, a son is born to Gomer. It is questionable whether this child was Hosea's, for God commands that his name be <a href="Lo-ammi">Lo-ammi</a>; Not My People, or more simply, Not Mine. The child bore this name of shame to show that the Northern Kingdom would also be shamed, for its people would no longer be known as God's People. In other words, the Northern Kingdom had been rejected by God. Also, God says that "I am not your <a href="I%20Am%20that%20I%20Am">I am</a>"; in other words, God changes His own name in connection with his current relationship with Israel.

In Hosea 2, the woman in the marriage metaphor could be Hosea’s wife <a href="Gomer%20%28wife%20of%20Hosea%29">Gomer</a>, or could be referring to the nation of Israel, invoking the metaphor of Israel as God's bride. The woman is not portrayed in a positive light. This is reflected throughout the beginning of Hosea 2. “I will strip her naked and expose her as in the day she was born” (Hosea 2:3). “Upon her children I will have no pity, because they are children of whoredom” (Hosea 2:4). “For she said, I will go after my lovers...” (Hosea 2:5).

Biblical scholar Ehud Ben Zvi reminds readers of the socio-historical context in which Hosea was composed. In his article Observations on the marital metaphor of YHWH and Israel in its ancient Israelite context: general considerations and particular images in Hosea 1.2, Ben Zvi describes the role of the Gomer in the marriage metaphor as one of the “central attributes of the ideological image of a human marriage that was shared by the male authorship and the primary and intended male readership as building blocks for their imagining of the relationship.” 

Tristanne J. Connolly makes a similar observation, stating that the husband-wife motif reflects marriage as it was understood at the time. Connolly also suggests that in context the marriage metaphor was necessary in that it truly exemplified the unequal interaction between Yahweh and the people Israel. Biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan describes the importance of understanding the covenant in relation to interpreting Hosea. According to Coogan, Hosea falls under a unique genre called “covenant lawsuit” where God accuses Israel of breaking their previously made agreement. God’s disappointment towards Israel is therefore expressed through the broken marriage covenant made between husband and wife.

Brad E. Kelle has referred to 'many scholars' finding references to cultic sexual practices in the worship of Baal, in Hosea 2, to be evidence of an historical situation in which Israelites were either giving up Yahweh worship for Baal, or blending the two. Hosea's references to sexual acts being metaphors for Israelite 'apostasy'.

Hosea 13:1–3 describes how the Israelites are abandoning Yahweh for the worship of Baal, and accuses them of making or using molten images for 'idol' worship. Chief among these being the image of the bull at the northern shrine of Bethel, which by the time of Hosea was being worshipped as an image of Baal.

Hosea is believed to be the first prophet to use marriage as a metaphor of the covenant between God and Israel, and he influenced latter prophets such as Jeremiah. He is among the first writing prophets, and the last chapter of Hosea has a format similar to <a href="wisdom%20literature">wisdom literature</a>.

Like <a href="Amos%20%28prophet%29">Amos</a>, Hosea elevated the religion of Israel to the altitude of ethical monotheism, being the first to emphasize the moral side of God's nature. Israel's faithlessness, which resisted all warnings, compelled Him to punish the people because of His own holiness. Hosea considers infidelity as the chief sin, of which Israel, the adulterous wife, has been guilty against her loving husband, God. Against this he sets the unquenchable love of God, who, in spite of this infidelity, does not cast Israel away forever, but will take His people unto Himself again after the judgment.

<doc id="4450" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4450" title="Book of Obadiah">
Book of Obadiah

The Book of Obadiah is an oracle concerning the divine judgment of <a href="Edom">Edom</a> and the restoration of <a href="Israel">Israel</a>. The text consists of a single chapter, divided into 21 verses, making it the shortest book in the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.

In <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> and <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>, its authorship is attributed to a <a href="prophet">prophet</a> who lived in the <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>n Period and named himself in the first verse, <a href="Obadiah">Obadiah</a>. His name means “servant of <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a>”.

In Christianity, the Book of Obadiah is classified as a <a href="minor%20prophet">minor prophet</a> of the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>, due to its short length.

In Judaism, Obadiah is considered a “later prophet”, placed in the last section (<a href="Nevi%27im">Nevi'im</a> of the <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>, where it is one of the "Twelve Prophets."

The book of Obadiah is based on a prophetic vision concerning the fall of <a href="Edom">Edom</a>, a mountain dwelling nation whose founding father was <a href="Esau">Esau</a>.
Obadiah describes an encounter with <a href="Yahweh">God</a> who addresses Edom’s arrogance and charges them for their violent actions against their brother nation, the House of <a href="Jacob">Jacob</a> (Israel).

The western half of ancient Edom is the <a href="Negev">Negev</a> desert all the way to Eilat, all part of modern Israel. The eastern half is possessed by the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan. In the days of Obadiah, the Edomites lived along the cliffs and mountaintops of the arid land south of the Dead Sea, all the way to the Gulf of Aqaba on the Red Sea. There was very little in the way of arable land, so the Edomites made their living supporting (and controlling) the main caravan route between <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egypt</a> and <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a> that passed through their whole land.

Throughout most of the history of Judah, Edom was controlled absolutely from Jerusalem as a vassal state. 
Among the region's great powers, Edom was held in low regard. Obadiah said that the high elevation of their dwelling place in the mountains of Seir had gone to their head, and they had puffed themselves up in pride. ""Though you soar like the eagle and make your nest among the stars, from there I will bring you down," declares the Lord." (Obadiah 1:4, NIV)

In 597 BCE, <a href="Nebuchadnezzar%20II">Nebuchadnezzar II</a> sacked Jerusalem, carted away the King of Judea and installed a puppet ruler. The Edomites helped the Babylonians loot the city. Obadiah, writing this prophecy around 590 BCE, suggests the Edomites should have remembered that blood was thicker than water. '"On the day you stood aloof while strangers carried off his wealth
and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them... You should not march through the gates of my people in the day of their disaster, nor gloat over them in their calamity in the day of their disaster, nor seize their wealth in the day of their disaster."' (Obadiah 1:11, 13 NIV)

Obadiah said in judgement God would wipe out the house of Esau forever, and not even a remnant would remain. The Edomites' land would be possessed by Egypt and they would cease to exist as a people. But the Day of the Lord was at hand for all nations, and someday the children of Israel would return from their exile and possess the land of Edom.

The date of composition is disputed and is difficult to determine due to the lack of personal information about Obadiah, his family, and his historical milieu. The date of composition must therefore be determined based on the prophecy itself. <a href="Edom">Edom</a> is to be destroyed due to its lack of defense for its brother nation, Israel, when it was under attack. There are two major historical contexts within which the Edomites could have committed such an act. These are during 853 – 841 BC when <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> was invaded by Philistines and Arabs during the reign of <a href="Jehoram%20of%20Judah">Jehoram of Judah</a> (recorded in <a href="Books%20of%20Kings">2 Kings</a> 8:20–22 and <a href="Books%20of%20Chronicles">2 Chronicles</a> 21:8–20 in the <a href="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>) and 607 – 586 BC when <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> was attacked by <a href="Nebuchadrezzar%20II">Nebuchadrezzar II</a> of <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>, which led to the Babylonian exile of <a href="Israel">Israel</a> (recorded in <a href="Psalm">Psalm</a> 137). The earlier period would place Obadiah as a contemporary of the prophet <a href="Elijah">Elijah</a> as reflected in 1 Kings 18:1-16. In particular, 1 Kings 18:7-8 reads: "As Obadiah was walking along, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him, bowed down to the ground, and said, 'Is it really you, my lord Elijah?' 'Yes,' he replied. 'Go tell your master, "Elijah is here."'" (NIV)

The later date would place Obadiah as a contemporary of the prophet <a href="Book%20of%20Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>, both of whom were prophets in the respective time periods. A sixth-century date for Obadiah is a "near consensus" position among scholars. Obadiah 1-9 contains parallels to <a href="Book%20of%20Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a> 49:7-22. The passage in <a href="Book%20of%20Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a> dates from the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim (604 BC), and therefore Obadiah 11-14 seems to refer to the destruction of <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> by <a href="Nebuchadrezzar%20II">Nebuchadrezzar II</a> (586 BC). It is more likely that Obadiah and <a href="Book%20of%20Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a> together were drawing on a common source presently unknown to us than <a href="Book%20of%20Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a> drawing on previous writings of Obadiah as his source. There is also much material found in Obadiah 10-21 which <a href="Book%20of%20Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a> does not quote, and which, had he had it laid out before him, would have suited his purpose admirably. Despite everything, however, there are some who support both dates and even some who support dates other than the two major possibilities presented. Any date for the composition of Obadiah must be held tentatively.

In verse eighteen, it says that once judgment has been carried out, “There will be no survivors from the house of Esau” (NIV). So, according to Obadiah there will not remain even a remnant after <a href="Edom">Edom</a>’s judgment. This is in contrast to <a href="Book%20of%20Amos">Amos</a> 9:12, where Amos refers to such a remnant, however, it is stated that their possession will be given to <a href="Israel">Israel</a>. Some scholars have suggested that <a href="Book%20of%20Amos">Amos</a>’s reference to <a href="Edom">Edom</a> is symbolic of all nations who were once enemies of <a href="Israel">Israel</a> and not intended to mean literal Edomites. This is certainly the perspective of <a href="Luke%20the%20Evangelist">Luke</a> as he recites the passage from <a href="Book%20of%20Amos">Amos</a> in <a href="Book%20of%20Acts">Acts</a> 15:17. <a href="Edom">Edom</a> is symbolic of the remnant of men and Gentiles who will eventually bear God’s name. Moreover, Frederick A. Tatford in "Prophet of <a href="Edom">Edom</a>’s Doom" says that Obadiah’s prophecy is fulfilled today as there is currently no trace of anyone who may be identified as a fleshly Edomite.

The identity of the land of Sepharad, mentioned only here in this verse in the Bible, , is currently unknown. It is also unknown whether or not Sepharad is a city, district or territory. The only clues for its possible existence are <a href="Persia">Persia</a>n inscriptions that refer to two places called "<a href="Saparda">Saparda</a>": one area in <a href="Medes">Media</a> and another in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, arguably <a href="Sardis">Sardis</a>.

The exact expression "the Day of the Lord”, from Obadiah 1:15, has been used by other authors throughout the "Old" and "New Testaments", as follows:

<a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>:

<a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>:

For other parallels, compare Obadiah 1:1–8 with <a href="Book%20of%20Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a> 49:7–16.

The overwhelming theme found in Obadiah is the destruction of the enemies of God’s people. Unlike other prophets who call the hearers to repent before they fall under <a href="divine%20judgement">judgment</a>, Obadiah's message is one of inevitable <a href="destiny">doom</a> as a consequence of previous actions. A <a href="Christian">Christian</a> with a knowledge of the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> would say that although God’s grace and forgiveness abound in such situations, because <a href="God">God</a> is <a href="Justice">just</a> there are consequences for opposing <a href="God">God</a> and God's people. Obadiah shows that judgment falls even within the family of God, as <a href="Israel">Israel</a> and <a href="Edom">Edom</a> descended from twin brothers, Jacob and Esau. His purpose was to make it known that according to his God, if members of the same family were to treat each other in the same manner as <a href="Edom">Edom</a> treated the Israelites, they too may be subject to the wrath of God.

In relating to theme of <a href="Obadiah">Obadiah</a>, it is important to underscore the “punishment” theme this book outlines against Edom. W.J. Deane and J.R. Thomson write this valid conclusion, “The Book of Obadiah is occupied with one subject – the punishment of Edom for its cruel and unbrotherly love conduct towards Judah...” One can link this idea of punishment to one of the major prophets “<a href="Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a>” who “...interprets the exile to Babylon and the destruction of Jerusalem as deserved punishments for the sins of those who themselves committed them.” Verses 3–7 in Obadiah explain to the reader the reason for the punishment theme, “Confidence in one’s power, intelligence, allies, or the topographical features of one’s territory is often mentioned as an attribute of those who foolishly confront the Lord and are consequently punished.” Although destruction is vital to understanding Obadiah, it is of note to understand the destruction being a consequence of action.

<doc id="4451" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4451" title="Book of Jonah">
Book of Jonah

The Book of Jonah is one of the <a href="Prophets">Prophets</a> in the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>. It tells of a Hebrew prophet named <a href="Jonah">Jonah</a> son of <a href="Amittai">Amittai</a> who is sent by God to prophesy the destruction of <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a> but tries to escape the divine mission. Set in the reign of <a href="Jeroboam%20II">Jeroboam II</a> (786–746 BC), it was probably written in the <a href="Babylonian%20captivity">post-exilic</a> period, some time between the late 5th to early 4th century BC. The story has a long interpretive history and has become well-known through popular children's stories. In <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> it is the <a href="Haftarah">Haftarah</a>, read during the afternoon of <a href="Yom%20Kippur">Yom Kippur</a> in order to instill reflection on God's willingness to forgive those who repent; it remains a popular story among <a href="Christianity">Christians</a>. It is also retold in the <a href="Quran">Koran</a>.

Unlike the other <a href="Twelve%20Minor%20Prophets">Prophets</a>, the book of Jonah is almost entirely narrative, with the exception of the psalm in chapter 2. The actual prophetic word against Nineveh is given only in passing through the narrative. As with any good narrative, the story of Jonah has a setting, characters, a plot, and themes. It also relies heavily on such literary devices as irony.


Nineveh, where Jonah preached, was the capital of the ancient <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a>n empire, which fell to the <a href="Babylonians">Babylonians</a> and the <a href="Medes">Medes</a> in 612 BC. The book calls Nineveh a “great city,” referring to its size [Jonah 3:3 + 4:11] and perhaps to its affluence as well. (The story of the city’s deliverance from judgment may reflect an older tradition dating back to the 8th–7th century BC) Assyria often opposed Israel and eventually took the Israelites captive in 722–721 BC (see <a href="History%20of%20ancient%20Israel%20and%20Judah">History of ancient Israel and Judah</a>). The Assyrian oppression against the Israelites can be seen in the bitter prophecies of <a href="Nahum">Nahum</a>.

The story of Jonah is a drama between a passive man and an active God. <a href="Jonah">Jonah</a>, whose name literally means "dove," is introduced to the reader in the very first verse. The name is decisive. While many other prophets had heroic names (e.g., Isaiah means "God has saved"), Jonah's name carries with it an element of passivity.

Jonah's passive character is contrasted with the other main character: <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a>. God's character is altogether active. While Jonah flees, God pursues. While Jonah falls, God lifts up. The character of God in the story is progressively revealed through the use of irony. In the first part of the book, God is depicted as relentless and wrathful; in the second part of the book, He is revealed to be truly loving and merciful.

The other characters of the story include the sailors in chapter 1 and the people of Nineveh in chapter 3. These characters are also contrasted to Jonah's passivity. While Jonah sleeps in the hull, the sailors pray and try to save the ship from the storm (1:4–6). While Jonah passively finds himself forced to act under the Divine Will, the people of Nineveh actively petition God to change his mind.

The plot centers on a conflict between Jonah and God. God calls Jonah to proclaim judgment to Nineveh, but Jonah resists and attempts to flee. He goes to <a href="Jaffa">Joppa</a> and boards a ship bound for <a href="Tarshish">Tarshish</a>. God calls up a great storm at sea, and, at Jonah's insistence, the ship's crew reluctantly cast Jonah overboard in an attempt to appease God. A great <a href="sea%20creature">sea creature</a>, sent by God, swallows Jonah. For three days and three nights Jonah languishes inside the fish's belly. He says a prayer in which he repents for his disobedience and thanks God for His mercy. God speaks to the fish, which vomits out Jonah safely on dry land.

After his rescue, Jonah obeys the call to prophesy against Nineveh, causing the people of the city to repent and God to forgive them. Jonah is furious, however, and angrily tells God that this is the reason he tried to flee from Him, as he knew Him to be a just and merciful God. He then beseeches God to kill him, a request which is denied when God causes a tree to grow over him, giving him shade. Initially grateful, Jonah's anger returns the next day, when God sends a worm to eat the plant, withering it, and he tells God that it would be better if he were dead. God then points out: "You are concerned about the bush, for which you did not labour and which you did not grow; it came into being in a night and perished in a night. And should I not be concerned about Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who do not know their right hand from their left, and also many animals? (<a href="New%20Revised%20Standard%20Version">NRSV</a>)"

Ironically, the relentless God demonstrated in the first chapter is shown to be the merciful God in the last two chapters (see 3:10). Equally ironic, despite not wanting to go to Nineveh and follow God's calling, Jonah becomes one of the most effective prophets of God. As a result of his preaching, the entire population of Nineveh repents before the Lord and is spared destruction. The author indicates that the city "has more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left" (4:11a, NIV). While some commentators see this number (120,000) as a somewhat pejorative reference to ignorant or backward Ninevites, most commentators take it to refer to young infants, thus implying a population considerably larger than 120,000.

Islam also tells the story of the Prophet Jonah in the Koran. Similar to the Bible, the Koran states that Jonah was sent to his people to deliver a message to worship only one God (the Judeo-Christian God of Abraham) and refrain from evil behavior. However Johah became angry with his people when they refused to listen and ignores him. Jonah gave up on his people and left his community without having instruction from God. “And remember when he (Jonah) went off in anger.” (Quran 21:87)

According to Islam, after Jonah left his people the sky turned red as fire and the people were filled with fear. Jonah's people repented to God and prayed that Jonah would return to guide them to the Straight Path. God accepted their repentance and the sky returned to normal.

As told in the Koran, Jonah boarded a ship to be far away from his people. While on the ship the calm sea became violent and was tearing at the boat. After throwing their belongings overboard without any positive change, the passengers cast lots to throw someone overboard to reduce the weight. Twice Jonah's name was drawn to be thrown overboard, which surprised the passengers because Jonah as perceived as a righteous and pious man. Jonah understood this was not a coincidence but his destiny and he jumped into the violent sea and was swallowed by a "giant fish." Many believe this fish was a whale.

The strong acid from fish's belly began to eat away at Jonah's skin and he began to repeatedly call out to God for help by saying: "None has the right to be worshipped but you oh God, glorified are you and truly I have been one of the wrongdoers!” (Quran 21:87)

Islam teaches that God accepted Jonah's repentance and commanded the giant fish to spit Jonah out onto the shore. Jonah was in pain and his skin was burned from the acid in the fish's belly. Jonah repeated his prayer and God relieved him by having a vine (gourd) cover his body to protect him and also provided him with food.

The Koran states: "And, verily, Jonah was one of the Messengers. When he ran to the laden ship, he agreed to cast lots and he was among the losers, then a big fish swallowed him and he had done an act worthy of blame. Had he not been of them who glorify God, he would have indeed remained inside its belly (the fish) until the Day of Resurrection. But We cast him forth on the naked shore while he was sick and We caused a plant of gourd to grow over him. And We sent him to a hundred thousand people or even more, and they believed, so We gave them enjoyment for a while.” (Quran 37:139-148).

Jonah returned to be with his people and guide them. The prayer made by Jonah while in the fish's belly can be used to help anyone in times of distress: "None has the right to be worshipped but you oh God, glorified are you and truly I have been one of the wrongdoers!” (Quran 21:87).

The story of Jonah has numerous theological implications, and this has long been recognized. In early translations of the Hebrew Bible, Jewish translators tended to remove anthropomorphic imagery in order to prevent the reader from misunderstanding the ancient texts. This tendency is evidenced in both the Aramaic translations (e.g. the <a href="Targum">Targum</a>s) and the Greek translations (e.g. the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>). As far as the Book of Jonah is concerned, Targum Jonah offers a good example of this.

In Jonah 1:6, the <a href="Masoretic%20Text">Masoretic Text</a> (MT) reads, "...perhaps God will pay heed to us..." Targum Jonah translates this passage as: "...perhaps there will be mercy from the Lord upon us..." The captain's proposal is no longer an attempt to change the divine will; it is an attempt to appeal to divine mercy. Furthermore, in Jonah 3:9, the MT reads, "Who knows, God may turn and relent [lit. repent]?" Targum Jonah translates this as, "Whoever knows that there are sins on his conscience let him repent of them and we will be pitied before the Lord." God does not change His mind; He shows pity.

Fragments of the book were found among the <a href="Dead%20Sea%20Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a> (DSS) (4Q76 a.k.a. 4QMinorProphets, Col V-VI, frags. 21–22; 4Q81 a.k.a. 4QMinorProphets, Col I and II; and 4Q82 a.k.a. 4QMinorProphets, Frags. 76–91), most of which follows the <a href="Masoretic%20Text">Masoretic Text</a> closely and with Mur XII reproducing a large portion of the text. As for the non-canonical writings, the majority of references to biblical texts were made by "argumentum ad verecundiam". The Book of Jonah appears to have served less purpose in the Qumran community than other texts, as the writings make no references to it.

The earliest Christian interpretations of Jonah are found in the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Matthew">Gospel of Matthew</a> (see and 16:1–4) and the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Gospel of Luke</a> (see Luke 11:29–32). Both Matthew and Luke record a tradition of Jesus’ interpretation of the Book of Jonah (notably, Matthew includes two very similar traditions in chapters 12 and 16). As with most Old Testament interpretations found in the New Testament, Jesus’ interpretation is primarily “typological” (see <a href="Typology%20%28theology%29">Typology (theology)</a>). Jonah becomes a “type” for Jesus. Jonah spent three days in the belly of the fish; Jesus will spend three days in the grave. Here, Jesus plays on the imagery of <a href="Sheol">Sheol</a> found in Jonah’s prayer. While Jonah metaphorically declared, “Out of the belly of Sheol I cried,” Jesus will literally be in the belly of Sheol. Finally, Jesus compares his generation to the people of Nineveh. Jesus fulfills his role as a type of Jonah, however his generation fails to fulfill its role as a type of Nineveh. Nineveh repented, but Jesus' generation, which has seen and heard one even greater than Jonah, fails to repent. Through his typological interpretation of the Book of Jonah, Jesus has weighed his generation and found it wanting.

The debate over the credibility of the miracle of Jonah is not simply a modern one. The credibility of a human being surviving in the belly of a great fish has long been questioned. In c. 409 AD, <a href="Augustine%20of%20Hippo">Augustine of Hippo</a> wrote to Deogratias concerning the challenge of some to the miracle recorded in the Book of Jonah. He writes:

Augustine responds that if one is to question one miracle, then one should question all miracles as well (section 31). Nevertheless, despite his apologetic, Augustine views the story of Jonah as a figure for Christ. For example, he writes: "As, therefore, Jonah passed from the ship to the belly of the <a href="whale">whale</a>, so Christ passed from the cross to the sepulchre, or into the abyss of death. And as Jonah suffered this for the sake of those who were endangered by the storm, so Christ suffered for the sake of those who are tossed on the waves of this world." Augustine credits his allegorical interpretation to the interpretation of Christ himself (Matt. 12:39,40), and he allows for other interpretations as long as they are in line with Christ's.

The "Ordinary Gloss", or "<a href="Glossa%20Ordinaria">Glossa Ordinaria</a>", was the most important Christian commentary on the Bible in the later Middle Ages. "The Gloss on Jonah relies almost exclusively on Jerome’s commentary on Jonah (c. 396), so its Latin often has a tone of urbane classicism. But the Gloss also chops up, compresses, and rearranges Jerome with a carnivalesque glee and scholastic directness that renders the Latin authentically medieval." "The Ordinary Gloss on Jonah" has been translated into English and printed in a format that emulates the first printing of the Gloss.

The relationship between Jonah and his fellow Jews is ambivalent, and complicated by the Gloss's tendency to read Jonah as an allegorical prefiguration of Jesus Christ. While some glosses in isolation seem crudely supersessionist (“The foreskin believes while the circumcision remains unfaithful”), the prevailing allegorical tendency is to attribute Jonah’s recalcitrance to his abiding love for his own people and his insistence that God’s promises to Israel not be overridden by a lenient policy toward the Ninevites. For the glossator, Jonah’s pro-Israel motivations correspond to Christ’s demurral in the Garden of Gethsemane (“My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me” [Matt. 26:39]) and the Gospel of Matthew’s and Paul’s insistence that “salvation is from the Jews” (Jn. 4:22). While in the Gloss the plot of Jonah prefigures how God will extend salvation to the nations, it also makes abundantly clear—as some medieval commentaries on the Gospel of John do not—that Jonah and Jesus are Jews, and that they make decisions of salvation-historical consequence "as Jews".

Roman Catholic author <a href="Terry%20Eagleton">Terry Eagleton</a> has written, "There are writers who consider their work to be examples of high seriousness when they are hilariously, unintentionally funny. ... Another example is the Book of Jonah, which is probably not intended to be funny but which is brilliantly comic without seeming to be aware of it."

The Hebrew text of Jonah (1:17 in English translation), reads "dag gadol" (Hebrew: דג גדול), which literally means "great fish." The <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> translates this into Greek as "ketos megas," (Greek: κητος μεγας), "huge fish"; in Greek mythology the term was closely associated with sea monsters. <a href="Saint%20Jerome">Saint Jerome</a> later translated the Greek phrase as "piscis granda" in his <a href="Latin%20Vulgate">Latin Vulgate</a>, and as "cetus" in . At some point, "cetus" became synonymous with <a href="whale">whale</a> (cf. <a href="cetyl%20alcohol">cetyl alcohol</a>, which is alcohol derived from whales). In his 1534 translation, <a href="William%20Tyndale">William Tyndale</a> translated the phrase in Jonah 2:1 as "greate fyshe," and he translated the word "ketos" (Greek) or "cetus" (Latin) in as "<a href="whale">whale</a>". Tyndale's translation was later followed by the translators of the <a href="King%20James%20Version">King James Version</a> of 1611 and has enjoyed general acceptance in English translations.

In the line 2:1 the book refers to the fish as "dag gadol", "great fish", in the masculine. However, in the 2:2, it changes the gender to "daga," meaning female fish. The verses therefore read: "And the lord provided a great fish ("dag gadol", masculine) for Jonah, and it swallowed him, and Jonah sat in the belly of the fish (still male) for three days and nights; then, from the belly of the ("daga", female) fish, Jonah began to pray." The peculiarity of this change of gender led the later rabbis to reason that this means Jonah was comfortable in the roomy male fish, so he didn't pray, but that God then transferred him to a smaller, female fish, in which the prophet was uncomfortable, so that he prayed.

The book closes abruptly () with an epistolary warning based on the <a href="emblem">emblem</a>atic trope of a fast-growing vine present in Persian narratives, and popularized in fables such as "<a href="The%20Gourd%20and%20the%20Palm-tree">The Gourd and the Palm-tree</a>" during the Renaissance, for example by <a href="Andrea%20Alciato">Andrea Alciato</a>.

<a href="St.%20Jerome">St. Jerome</a> differed with <a href="St.%20Augustine">St. Augustine</a> in his Latin translation of the plant known in Hebrew as קיקיון ("qīqayōn"), using "hedera" (from the Greek, meaning "<a href="ivy">ivy</a>") over the more common Latin "cucurbita", "<a href="gourd">gourd</a>", from which the English word "gourd" (<a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> "coorde", "couhourde") is derived. The Renaissance humanist artist <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a> memorialized Jerome's decision to use an analogical type of Christ's <a href="The%20Vine">"I am the Vine, you are the branches"</a> in his woodcut "<a href="Saint%20Jerome%20in%20His%20Study%20%28D%C3%BCrer%29">Saint Jerome in His Study</a>".

Book of Micah

The Book of Micah is a prophetic book in the <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a><a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>, and the sixth of the <a href="Twelve%20Minor%20Prophets">twelve minor prophets</a>. It records the sayings of <a href="Micah%20%28prophet%29">Micah</a>, whose name is "Mikayahu",(Hebrew: מִיכָיָ֫הוּ ) meaning "Who is like Yahweh?", an 8th-century B.C. prophet from the village of <a href="Moresheth-Gath">Moresheth</a> in <a href="kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a> (Hebrew name from the opening verse: מיכה המרשתי). The book has three major divisions, chapters 1–2, 3–5 and 6–7, each introduced by the word "Hear," with a pattern of alternating announcements of doom and expressions of hope within each division. Micah reproaches unjust leaders, defends the rights of the poor against the <a href="plutocracy">rich and powerful</a>; while looking forward to a world at peace centered on Zion under the leadership of a new <a href="David">David</a>ic monarch.

While the book is relatively short, it includes <a href="lament">lament</a> (1.8–16; 7.8–10), <a href="theophany">theophany</a> (1.3–4), hymnic prayer of petition and confidence (7.14–20), and the "covenant lawsuit" (6.1–8), a distinct genre in which Yahweh (God) sues Israel for breach of contract, that is, for violation of the Sinai covenant.

At the broadest level, Micah can be divided into three roughly equal parts:

Within this broad three-part structure are a series of alternating oracles of judgment and promises of restoration:


Chapter 1:1 identifies the prophet as "Micah of Moresheth" (a town in southern Judah), and states that he lived during the reigns of <a href="Jotham%20of%20Judah">Yehotam</a>, <a href="Ahaz">Ahaz</a> and <a href="Hezekiah">Hezekiah</a>, roughly 750–700 BC.

Micah's career corresponds to the period when, after a long period of peace, Israel, Judah, and the other nations of the region came under increasing pressure from the aggressive and rapidly expanding <a href="Neo-Assyrian%20empire">Assyrian empire</a>. Between 734 and 727 <a href="Tiglath-Pileser%20III">Tiglath-Pileser III</a> of Assyria conducted almost annual campaigns in Israel, reducing Israel, Judah and the Philistine cities to vassalage, receiving tribute from Ammon, Moab and Edom, and absorbing Damascus (the kingdom of <a href="Aram%20Damascus">Aram</a>) into the Assyrian empire. On Tiglath-Pileser's death Israel rebelled, resulting in an Assyrian counter-attack and the destruction of the capital, <a href="Samaria">Samaria</a>, in 721 after a three-year siege. Micah 1:2–7 draws on this event: Samaria, says the prophet, has been destroyed by God because of its crimes of idolatry, oppression of the poor, and misuse of power. The Assyrian attacks on Israel (the northern kingdom) led to an influx of refugees into Judah, which would have increased social stresses, while at the same time the authorities in Jerusalem had to invest huge amounts in tribute and defense.

When the Assyrians attacked Judah in 701 they did so via the Philistine coast and the Shephelah, the border region which included Micah's village of Moresheth, as well as <a href="Lachish">Lachish</a>, Judah's second largest city. This in turn forms the background to verses 1:8–16, in which Micah warns the towns of the coming disaster (Lachish is singled out for special mention, accused of the corrupt practices of both Samaria and Jerusalem). In verses 2:1–5 he denounces the appropriation of land and houses, which might simply be the greed of the wealthy and powerful, or possibly the result of the militarising of the area in preparation for the Assyrian attack.

Some, but not all scholars accept that only chapters 1–3 contain material from the late 8th century prophet Micah. The latest material comes from the post-Exilic period after the Temple was rebuilt in 515 BC, so that the early 5th century BC seems to be the period when the book was completed. The first stage was the collection and arrangement of some spoken sayings of the historical Micah (the material in chapters 1–3), in which the prophet attacks those who build estates through oppression and depicts the Assyrian invasion of Judah as Yahweh's punishment on the kingdom's corrupt rulers, including a prophecy that the Temple will be destroyed. The prophecy was not fulfilled in Micah's time, but a hundred years later when Judah was facing a similar crisis with <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>, and Micah's prophecies were reworked and expanded to reflect the new situation. Still later, after Jerusalem did fall to the Babylonians, the book was revised and expanded further to reflect the circumstances of the late exilic and post-exilic community.

Micah addresses the future of Judah/Israel after the Babylonian exile. Like <a href="book%20of%20Isaiah">Isaiah</a>, the book has a vision of the punishment of Israel and creation of a "remnant", followed by world peace centred on Zion under the leadership of a new Davidic monarch; the people should do justice, turn to Yahweh, and await the end of their punishment. However, whereas Isaiah sees Jacob/Israel joining "the nations" under Yahweh's rule, Micah looks forward to Israel ruling over the nations. Insofar as Micah appears to draw on and rework parts of Isaiah, it seems designed at least partly to provide a counterpoint to that book.

In the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>, <a href="Matthew%27s%20gospel">Matthew's gospel</a> quotes from the Book of Micah in relation to Jesus being born in <a href="Bethlehem">Bethlehem</a>:
Jesus quotes Micah when he warns that families will be divided by the gospel:

<doc id="4453" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4453" title="Book of Nahum">
Book of Nahum

The Book of Nahum is the seventh book of the 12 <a href="minor%20prophets">minor prophets</a> of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>. It is attributed to the prophet <a href="Nahum">Nahum</a>, and was probably written in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in the 7th century BC.

According to some, <a href="Nahum">Nahum</a> <a href="prophet%23Judaism">prophesied</a> in the beginning of the reign of <a href="Ahaz">Ahaz</a> (740s BC). Others, however, think that his prophecies are to be referred to the latter half of the reign of <a href="Hezekiah">Hezekiah</a> (8th century BC). The book would then have been written in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, where Nahum would have witnessed the invasion of <a href="Sennacherib">Sennacherib</a> and the destruction of his host (<a href="Books%20of%20Kings">2 Kings</a> 19:35).

The scholarly consensus is that the "book of vision" was written at the time of the fall of <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a> at the hands of the <a href="Medes">Medes</a> and <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>ians (612 BC). This theory is demonstrated by the fact that the oracles must be dated after the Assyrian destruction of <a href="Thebes%2C%20Egypt">Thebes, Egypt</a> in 663 BC as this event is mentioned in Nahum 3:8.

Little is known about Nahum’s personal history. His name means "comforter", and he was from the town of Alqosh, (Nahum 1:1) which scholars have attempted to identify with several cities, including the modern <a href="Alqosh">`Alqush</a> of <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a> and <a href="Capernaum">Capharnaum</a> of northern <a href="Galilee">Galilee</a>. He was a very nationalistic Hebrew, and lived amongst the Elkoshites in peace. His writings were likely written in about 615 BC, before the downfall of Assyria.

The subject of Nahum's prophecy is the approaching complete and final destruction of <a href="Nineveh">Nineveh</a>, the capital of the great and at that time flourishing <a href="Assyria">Assyrian empire</a>. <a href="Ashurbanipal">Ashurbanipal</a> was at the height of his glory. Nineveh was a city of vast extent, and was then the center of the civilization and commerce of the world, according to Nahum a "bloody city all full of lies and robbery" (Nahum 3:1), a reference to the Neo-Assyrian Empire's military campaigns and demand of tribute and plunder from conquered cities.

<a href="Jonah">Jonah</a> had already uttered his message of warning, and Nahum was followed by <a href="Zephaniah">Zephaniah</a>, who also predicted (<a href="Book%20of%20Zephaniah">Zephaniah</a> 2:4–15) the destruction of the city.

Nineveh was destroyed apparently by fire around 625 BC, and the Assyrian empire came to an end, an event which changed the face of Asia.
Archaeological digs have uncovered the splendor of Nineveh in its zenith under <a href="Sennacherib">Sennacherib</a> (705–681 BC), <a href="Esarhaddon">Esarhaddon</a> (681–669 BC), and <a href="Ashurbanipal">Ashurbanipal</a> (669–633 BC). Massive walls were eight miles in circumference. It had a water <a href="aqueduct%20%28watercourse%29">aqueduct</a>, palaces and a library with 20,000 clay tablets, including accounts of a creation in <a href="Enuma%20Elish">Enuma Elish</a> and a flood in the <a href="Epic%20of%20Gilgamesh">Epic of Gilgamesh</a>.

The Babylonian chronicle of the fall of Nineveh tells the story of the end of Nineveh. <a href="Nabopolassar">Nabopolassar of Babylon</a> joined forces with Cyaxares, king of the Medes, and laid siege for three months.

Assyria lasted a few more years after the loss of its fortress, but attempts by <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian</a> <a href="Pharaoh">Pharaoh</a> <a href="Neco%20II">Neco II</a> to rally the Assyrians failed due to opposition from king <a href="Josiah">Josiah</a> of <a href="kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a>, and it seemed to be all over by 609 BC.

The Book of Nahum consists of two parts:

Chapter one shows the majesty and might of God the L in goodness and severity.

Chapters two and three describe the fall of Nineveh, which later took place in 612 BC. Nineveh is compared to <a href="Thebes%20%28Egypt%29">Thebes</a>, the Egyptian city that Assyria itself had destroyed in 663 BC. Nahum describes the siege and frenzied activity of Nineveh’s troops as they try in vain to halt the invaders. Poetically, he becomes a participant in the battle, and with subtle irony, barks battle commands to the defenders. Nahum uses numerous similes and <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a>s . Nineveh is ironically compared with a lion, in reference to the lion as an Assyrian symbol of power; Nineveh is the lion of strength that has a den full of dead prey but will become weak like the lion hiding in its den. It comes to conclusion with a taunt song and funeral dirge of the impending destruction of Nineveh and the "sleep" or death of the Assyrian people and demise of the once great Assyrian conqueror-rulers .

Nahum's prophecy carries a particular warning to the Ninevites of coming events, although he is partly in favor of the destruction. One might even say that the book of Nahum is "a celebration of the fall of Assyria." And this is not just a warning or speaking positively of the destruction of Nineveh, it is also a positive encouragement and "message of comfort for Israel, Judah, and others who had experienced the "endless cruelty" () of the Assyrians." The prophet <a href="Jonah">Jonah</a> shows us where God shows concern for the people of Nineveh, while Nahum's writing testifies to his belief in the righteousness/justice of God and how God dealt with those Assyrians in punishment according to "their cruelty" (). The Assyrians had been used as God's "rod of […] anger, and the staff in their hand [as] indignation." (Isaiah 10:5)

From its opening, Nahum shows God to be slow to anger, but that God will by no means ignore the guilty; God will bring his vengeance and wrath to pass. God is presented as a God who will punish evil, but will protect those who trust in Him. The opening passage (<a href="Nahum%201">Nahum 1</a>:2–3) states: "God is jealous, and the L revengeth; the L revengeth, and is furious; the L will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies. The L is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked". God is strong and will use means, but a mighty God doesn't need anyone else to carry out vengeance and wrath for him.

<a href="Nahum%201">Nahum 1</a>:3 (NIV) "The L is slow to anger and Quick to love; the L will not leave the guilty unpunished."

<a href="Nahum%201">Nahum 1</a>:7 (NIV) "The L is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him"

God's judgement on Nineveh is "all because of the wanton lust of a harlot, alluring, the mistress of sorceries, who enslaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcraft" (Nahum 3:4 NIV). Infidelity, according to the prophets, related to spiritual unfaithfulness. For example: "the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the L" (Hosea 1:2 NIV). The apostle <a href="John%20the%20Apostle%23Book%20of%20Revelation">John</a> used a similar analogy in <a href="Revelation%2017">Revelation chapter 17</a>.

The book was introduced in <a href="John%20Calvin">Calvin</a>'s Commentary as a complete and finished poem:
Nahum, taking words from Moses himself, have shown in a general way what sort of "Being God is". The Reformation theologian Calvin argued, Nahum painted God by which His nature must be seen, and "it is from that most memorable vision, when God appeared to Moses after the breaking of the tables."

The book could be seen as an allusion to the history as described by Moses; for the minor Prophets, in promising God’s assistance to his people, must often remind how God in a miraculous manner brought up the Jews from Egypt.

Book of Haggai

The Book of Haggai is a book of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> or <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>, and has its place as the third-to-last of the <a href="Twelve%20Minor%20Prophets">Minor Prophets</a>. It is a short book, consisting of only two chapters. The historical setting dates around 520 BCE before the Temple has been rebuilt. 520 BCE falls between the start of the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid Empire</a> in 539 BCE and 520 BCE, a period that saw major leaders such as <a href="Zerubbabel">Zerubbabel</a> help lead the Jews in their return to the land from <a href="Babylonian%20captivity">Babylonian captivity</a>.

The Book of Haggai is named after its presumed author, the prophet <a href="Haggai">Haggai</a>. There is no biographical information given about the prophet in the Book of Haggai. Haggai's name is derived from the Hebrew verbal root "hgg", which means "to make a pilgrimage." W. Sibley Towner suggests that Haggai's name might come "from his single-minded effort to bring about the reconstruction of that destination of ancient Judean pilgrims, the <a href="Temple%20in%20Jerusalem">Temple in Jerusalem</a>."

The "Book of Haggai" was written in 520 BCE some 18 years after <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus</a> had conquered <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a> and issued a decree in 538 BCE allowing the captive Jews to return to Judea. Cyrus saw the restoration of the temple as necessary for the restoration of the religious practices and a sense of peoplehood after a long exile.

Haggai's message is filled with an urgency for the people to proceed with the rebuilding of the <a href="Second%20Temple">second Jerusalem temple</a>. Haggai attributes a recent drought to the people's refusal to rebuild the temple, which he sees as key to <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>’s glory. The book ends with the prediction of the downfall of kingdoms, with one <a href="Zerubbabel">Zerubbabel</a>, governor of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a>, as the Lord’s chosen leader. The language here is not as finely wrought as in some other books of the <a href="minor%20prophets">minor prophets</a>, yet the intent seems straightforward.

The first chapter contains the first address (2–11) and its effects (12–15).

The second chapter contains:

These discourses are referred to in <a href="Book%20of%20Ezra">Ezra</a> 5:1 and 6:14. (Compare Haggai 2:7, 8 and 22)

Haggai reports that three weeks after his first prophecy, the rebuilding of the Temple began on September 7 521 BCE. "They came and began to work on the house of the LORD Almighty, their God, on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year of Darius the King.(Haggai 1:14–15) and the Book of Ezra indicates that it was finished on February 25 516 BCE "The Temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius." (Ezra 6:15)

<doc id="4455" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4455" title="Book of Malachi">
Book of Malachi

Malachi (or Malachias; , "Malʾaḫi, Mál'akhî") is the last book of the <a href="Neviim">Neviim</a> contained in the <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a>, the last of the <a href="Twelve%20Minor%20Prophets">Twelve Minor Prophets</a> (canonically) and the final book of the <a href="Neviim">Neviim</a>. In the Christian ordering, the grouping of the Prophetic Books is the last section of the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>, making Malachi the last book before the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>.

The book is commonly attributed to a prophet by the name of "<a href="Malachi">Malachi</a>." Although the appellation "Malachi" has frequently been understood as a proper name, its <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> meaning is simply "My [i.e., God's] messenger" (or 'His messenger' in the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>) and may not be the author's name at all. The sobriquet occurs in the superscription at 1:1 and in 3:1, although it is highly unlikely that the word refers to the same character in both of these references. Thus, there is substantial debate regarding the identity of the book's author. One of the <a href="Targum">Targum</a>s identifies <a href="Ezra">Ezra</a> (or Esdras) as the author of Malachi. <a href="Jerome">St. Jerome</a> suggests this may be because Ezra is seen as an intermediary between the prophets and the 'great synagogue'. There is, however, no historical evidence yet to support this claim.

Some scholars note affinities between <a href="Book%20of%20Zechariah">Zechariah</a> 9–14 and the Book of Malachi. Zechariah 9, Zechariah 12, and Malachi 1 are all introduced as The word of Elohim. Many scholars argue that this collection originally consisted of three independent and anonymous prophecies, two of which were subsequently appended to the Book of Zechariah (as what scholars refer to as Deutero-Zechariah) with the third becoming the Book of Malachi. As a result, most scholars consider the Book of Malachi to be the work of a single author who may or may not have been identified by the title Malachi. The present division of the oracles results in a total of twelve books of minor prophets—a number parallelling the sons of <a href="Jacob">Jacob</a> who became the heads of the twelve <a href="Israelite">tribes of Israel</a>. The "<a href="Catholic%20Encyclopedia">Catholic Encyclopedia</a>" asserts that "We are no doubt in presence of an abbreviation of the name Mál'akhîyah, that is Messenger of Elohim.

Nothing is known of the biography of the author of the Book of Malachi, although it has been suggested that he may have been Levitical (which is curious, considering that Ezra was a priest). The books of Zechariah and Haggai were written during the lifetime of Ezra (see 5:1); perhaps this may explain the similarities in style. Although the Ezra theory is disputed, it remains the dominant authorship theory.

According to the editors of the 1897 <a href="Easton%27s%20Bible%20Dictionary">Easton's Bible Dictionary</a>, some scholars believe the name "Malachi" is not a <a href="proper%20noun">proper noun</a> but rather an abbreviation of "messenger of <a href="YHWH">YHWH</a>". This reading could be based on Malachi 3:1, "<a href="http%3A//www.blueletterbible.org/tsk_b/Mal/3/1.html%23MainTop">Behold, I will send "my messenger"...</a>", if "my messenger" is taken literally as the name "Malachi". Several scholars consider the book to be anonymous, with verse 1:1 being a later addition. However, other scholars, including the editors of the "Catholic Encyclopedia", argue that the grammatical evidence leads us to conclude that Malachi is in fact a name.

Another interpretation of the authorship comes from the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a> <a href="superscription">superscription</a>, ὲν χειρὶ ἀγγήλου αὐτοῦ, which can be read as either "by the hand of his messenger" or as "by the hand of his angel". The "angel" reading found an echo among the ancient <a href="Church%20Fathers">Church Fathers</a> and ecclesiastical writers, and even gave rise to the "strangest fancies", especially among the disciples of <a href="Origen%20of%20Alexandria">Origen of Alexandria</a>.

There are very few historical details in the Book of Malachi. The greatest clue as to its dating may lie in the fact that the Persian-era term for governor (pehâ) is used in 1:8. This points to a post-exilic date of composition both because of the use of the Persian period term and because <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a> had a king before the exile. Since, in the same verse, the temple has been rebuilt, the book must also be later than 515 BC. Malachi was apparently known to the author of <a href="Sirach">Ecclesiasticus</a> early in the 2nd century BC. Because of the development of themes in the book of Malachi, most scholars assign it to a position between <a href="Book%20of%20Haggai">Haggai</a> and <a href="Book%20of%20Zechariah">Zechariah</a>, slightly before <a href="Nehemiah">Nehemiah</a> came to <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in 445 BC.

The Book of Malachi was written to correct the lax religious and social behaviour of the <a href="Israelite">Israelite</a>s – particularly the priests – in post-exilic <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. Although the prophets urged the people of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a> and <a href="Israel">Israel</a> to see their exile as punishment for failing to uphold their covenant with Elohim, it was not long after they had been restored to the land and to <a href="Temple%20in%20Jerusalem">Temple</a> worship that the people's commitment to their God began, once again, to wane. It was in this context that the prophet commonly referred to as Malachi delivered his prophecy.

In 1:2, Malachi has the people of Israel question God's love for them. This introduction to the book illustrates the severity of the situation which Malachi addresses. The graveness of the situation is also indicated by the dialectical style with which Malachi confronts his audience. Malachi proceeds to accuse his audience of failing to respect God as God deserves. One way in which this disrespect is made manifest is through the substandard sacrifices which Malachi claims are being offered by the priests. While Elohim demands animals that are "without blemish" (<a href="Leviticus">Leviticus</a> 1:3, NRSV), the priests, who were "to determine whether the animal was acceptable" (Mason 143), were offering blind, lame and sick animals for sacrifice because they thought nobody would notice.

In 2:10, Malachi addresses the issue of divorce. On this topic, Malachi deals with divorce both as a social problem ("Why then are we faithless to one another ... ?" 2:10) and as a religious problem ("Judah ... has married the daughter of a foreign god" 2:11). In contrast to the <a href="book%20of%20Ezra">book of Ezra</a> (or not – see section below), Malachi urges each to remain steadfast to the wife of his youth.

Malachi also criticizes his audience for questioning God's justice. He reminds them that God is just, exhorting them to be faithful as they await that justice. Malachi quickly goes on to point out that the people have not been faithful. In fact, the people are not giving God all that God deserves. Just as the priests have been offering unacceptable sacrifices, so the people have been neglecting to offer their full <a href="tithe">tithe</a> to Elohim. The result of these shortcomings is that the people come to believe that no good comes out of serving God.

Malachi assures the faithful among his audience that in the <a href="eschatology">eschaton</a>, the differences between those who served God faithfully and those who did not will become clear. The book concludes by calling upon the teachings of <a href="Moses">Moses</a> and by promising that <a href="Elijah">Elijah</a> will return prior to the <a href="Last%20Judgement">Day of Elohim</a>.

The book of Malachi is divided into three chapters in the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> and the <a href="Septuagint">Greek Septuagint</a> and four chapters in the <a href="Latin%20Vulgate">Latin Vulgate</a>. The fourth chapter in the Vulgate consists of the remainder of the third chapter starting at verse 3:19.

The <a href="New%20Revised%20Standard%20Version">New Revised Standard Version</a> of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> supplies headings for the book as follows:

The majority of scholars consider the book to be made up of six distinct oracles. According to this scheme, the book of Malachi consists of a series of disputes between <a href="Tetragrammaton">Yahweh</a> and the various groups within the <a href="Israelite">Israelite</a> community. In the course of the book's three or four chapters, <a href="Tetragrammaton">Yahweh</a> is vindicated while those who do not adhere to the law of <a href="Moses">Moses</a> are condemned. Some scholars have suggested that the book, as a whole, is structured along the lines of a judicial trial, a suzerain treaty or a covenant—one of the major themes throughout the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Scriptures</a>. Implicit in the prophet's condemnation of Israel's religious practices is a call to keep <a href="Tetragrammaton">Yahweh</a>'s statutes.

The Book of Malachi draws upon various themes found in other books of the Bible. Malachi appeals to the rivalry between <a href="Jacob%20and%20Esau">Jacob and Esau</a> and of <a href="Tetragrammaton">Yahweh</a>'s preference for Jacob contained in <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Book of Genesis</a> 25–28. Malachi reminds his audience that, as descendants of Jacob (<a href="Israel">Israel</a>), they have been and continue to be favoured by God as God's chosen people. In the second dispute, Malachi draws upon the Levitical Code (e.g. <a href="Leviticus">Leviticus</a> 1:3) in condemning the priest for offering unacceptable sacrifices.

In the third dispute (concerning divorce), the author of the Book of Malachi likely intends his argument to be understood on two levels. Malachi appears to be attacking either the practice of divorcing Jewish wives in favour of foreign ones (a practice which <a href="Ezra">Ezra</a> vehemently condemns) or, alternatively, Malachi could be condemning the practice of divorcing foreign wives in favour of <a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish wives (a practice which <a href="Ezra">Ezra</a> promoted). Malachi appears adamant that nationality is not a valid reason to terminate a marriage, "For I hate divorce, says the Lord . . ." (2:16).

In many places throughout the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Scriptures</a> – particularly the <a href="Book%20of%20Hosea">Book of Hosea</a> – <a href="Israel">Israel</a> is figured as <a href="Tetragrammaton">Yahweh</a>'s wife or bride. Malachi's discussion of divorce may also be understood to conform to this metaphor. Malachi could very well be urging his audience not to break faith with <a href="Tetragrammaton">Yahweh</a> (the God of <a href="Israel">Israel</a>) by adopting new gods or idols. It is quite likely that, since the people of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a> were questioning <a href="Tetragrammaton">Yahweh</a>'s love and justice (1:2, 2:17), they might be tempted to adopt foreign gods. William LaSor suggests that, because the restoration to the land of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Judah</a> had not resulted in anything like the prophesied splendor of the <a href="messiah">messianic age</a> which had been prophesied, the people were becoming quite disillusioned with their religion.

Indeed, the fourth dispute asserts that judgment is coming in the form of a messenger who "is like refiner's fire and like fullers' soap . . ." (3:2). Following this, the prophet provides another example of wrongdoing in the fifth dispute – that is, failing to offer full tithes. In this discussion, Malachi has <a href="Tetragrammaton">Yahweh</a> request the people to "Bring the full tithe . . . [and] see if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down on you an overflowing blessing" (3:10). This request offers the opportunity for the people to amend their ways. It also stresses that keeping the Lord's statutes will not only allow the people to avoid God's wrath, but will also lead to God's blessing. In the sixth dispute, the people of <a href="Israel">Israel</a> illustrate the extent of their disillusionment. Malachi has them say "'It is vain to serve God . . . Now we count the arrogant happy; evildoers not only prosper, but when they put God to the test they escape'" (3:14–15). Once again, Malachi has <a href="Tetragrammaton">Yahweh</a> assure the people that the wicked will be punished and the faithful will be rewarded.

In the light of what Malachi understands to be an imminent judgment, he exhorts his audience to "Remember the teaching of my servant <a href="Moses">Moses</a>, that statutes and ordinances that I commanded him at <a href="Mount%20Horeb">Horeb</a> for all <a href="Israel">Israel</a>" (4:4; 3:22, MT). Before the <a href="Last%20Judgment">Day of the Lord</a>, Malachi declares that <a href="Elijah">Elijah</a> (who "ascended in a whirlwind into heaven . . . [,]" 2 <a href="Books%20of%20Kings">Kings</a> 2:11) will return to earth in order that people might follow in God's ways.

Primarily because of its <a href="Messiah">messianic</a> promise, the Book of Malachi is frequently referred to in the <a href="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>. What follows is a brief comparison between the Book of Malachi and the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> texts which refer to it (as suggested in Hill 84–88).

Although many Christians believe that the <a href="messiah">messianic</a> prophecies of the Book of Malachi have been fulfilled in the life, ministry, <a href="Transfiguration%20of%20Jesus">transfiguration</a>, death and resurrection of <a href="Jesus">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, most Jews continue to await the coming of the prophet <a href="Elijah">Elijah</a> who will prepare the way for the Lord.

Book of Zechariah

The Book of Zechariah, attributed to the <a href="Hebrew%20Prophets">Hebrew prophet</a> <a href="Zechariah%20%28Hebrew%20prophet%29">Zechariah</a>, is included in the <a href="Twelve%20Minor%20Prophets">Twelve Minor Prophets</a> in the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>.

Zechariah’s prophecies took place during the reign of <a href="Darius%20the%20Great">Darius the Great</a> (), and was contemporary with <a href="Haggai">Haggai</a> in a post-<a href="Babylonian%20captivity">exilic</a> world after the <a href="Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%28587%20BC%29">fall of Jerusalem</a> in 587/6 BC. <a href="Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a> and <a href="Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a> wrote before the fall of Jerusalem, while continuing to prophesy in the early exile period. Scholars believe Ezekiel, with his blending of ceremony and vision, heavily influenced the visionary works of Zechariah 1–8. Zechariah is specific about dating his writing (520–518 BC).

During the Exile many Judahites and Benjamites were taken to <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>, where the prophets told them to make their homes (), suggesting they would spend a long period of time there. Eventually freedom did come to many Israelites, when <a href="Cyrus%20the%20Great">Cyrus the Great</a> overtook the Babylonians in 539 BC. In 538 BC, the famous <a href="Cyrus%20in%20the%20Judeo-Christian%20tradition">Edict of Cyrus</a> was released, and the first return took place under Sheshbazzar. After the death of Cyrus in 530 BC, <a href="Darius%20the%20Great">Darius</a> consolidated power and took office in 522 BC. His system divided the different colonies of the empire into easily manageable districts overseen by governors. <a href="Zerubbabel">Zerubbabel</a> comes into the story, appointed by Darius as governor over the district of <a href="Yehud%20Medinata">Yehud Medinata</a>.

Under the reign of Darius, Zechariah also emerged, centering on the rebuilding of the Temple. Unlike the Babylonians, the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian Empire</a> went to great lengths to keep “cordial relations” between vassal and lord. The rebuilding of the Temple was encouraged by the leaders of the empire in hopes that it would strengthen the authorities in local contexts. This policy was good politics on the part of the Persians, and the Jews viewed it as a blessing from God.

The name "<a href="Zechariah%20%28given%20name%29">Zechariah</a>" means "God remembered." Not much is known about Zechariah’s life other than what may be inferred from the book. It has been speculated that his ancestor <a href="Iddo%20%28prophet%29">Iddo</a> was the head of a priestly family who returned with <a href="Zerubbabel">Zerubbabel</a> (), and that Zechariah may himself have been a <a href="priest">priest</a> as well as a <a href="prophet">prophet</a>. This is supported by Zechariah's interest in the <a href="Solomon%27s%20Temple">Temple</a> and the priesthood, and from Iddo's preaching in the <a href="Books%20of%20Chronicles">Books of Chronicles</a>.

Some scholars accept the book as the writings of one individual. For example, George Livingstone Robinson's dissertation on chapters 9–14 concluded that those chapters had their origin in the period between 518 and 516 BC and stand in close relation to chapters 1–8, having most probably been composed by Zechariah himself. However, most modern scholars believe the Book of Zechariah was written by at least two different people.

Zechariah 1–8, sometimes referred to as First Zechariah, was written in the 6th century BC. Zechariah 9–14, often called Second Zechariah, contains within the text no datable references to specific events or individuals but most scholars give the text a date in the fifth century BCE. Second Zechariah, in the opinion of some scholars, appears to make use of the books of <a href="Book%20of%20Isaiah">Isaiah</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Jeremiah">Jeremiah</a>, and <a href="Book%20of%20Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a>, the <a href="Deuteronomistic%20History">Deuteronomistic History</a>, and the themes from First Zechariah. This has led some to believe that the writer(s) or editor(s) of Second Zechariah may have been a disciple of the prophet Zechariah. There are some scholars who go even further and divide Second Zechariah into Second Zechariah (9–11) and Third Zechariah (12–14) since each begins with a heading oracle.

The return from exile is the theological premise of the prophet's visions in chapters 1–6. Chapters 7–8 address the <a href="quality%20of%20life">quality of life</a> God wants his renewed people to enjoy, containing many encouraging promises to them. Chapters 9–14 comprise two "<a href="oracle">oracle</a>s" of the future. 
The book begins with a preface (), which recalls the nation's history, for the purpose of presenting a solemn warning to the present generation. Then follows a series of eight visions (), succeeding one another in one night, which may be regarded as a symbolical history of Israel, intended to furnish consolation to the returned exiles and stir up hope in their minds. The symbolic action, the crowning of <a href="Joshua%20the%20High%20Priest">Joshua</a> (), describes how the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of God's <a href="Messiah">Messiah</a>.

Chapters and , delivered two years later, are an answer to the question whether the days of mourning for the destruction of the city should be kept any longer, and an encouraging address to the people, assuring them of God's presence and blessing.

This section consists of two "oracles" or "burdens": 

The purpose of this book is not strictly historical but <a href="theological">theological</a> and <a href="pastoral">pastoral</a>. The main emphasis is that God is at work and plans to live again with His people in Jerusalem. He will save them from their enemies and cleanse them from sin.

Zechariah's concern for purity is apparent in the temple, priesthood and all areas of life as the prophecy gradually eliminates the influence of the governor in favour of the high priest, and the sanctuary becomes ever more clearly the centre of messianic fulfillment. The prominence of prophecy is quite apparent in Zechariah, but it is also true that Zechariah (along with Haggai) allows prophecy to yield to the priesthood; this is particularly apparent in comparing Zechariah to "Third Isaiah" (chapters 55–66 of the <a href="Book%20of%20Isaiah">Book of Isaiah</a>), whose author was active sometime after the first return from exile.

Most Christian commentators read the series of predictions in chapters 7 to 14 as <a href="Claimed%20Messianic%20prophecies%20of%20Jesus">Messianic prophecies</a>, either directly or indirectly. These chapters helped the writers of the <a href="Gospel">Gospel</a>s understand Jesus’ suffering, death and resurrection, which they quoted as they wrote of Jesus’ final days. Much of the <a href="Book%20of%20Revelation">Book of Revelation</a>, which narrates the denouement of history, is also colored by images in Zechariah.

Chapters 9–14 of the Book of Zechariah are an early example of <a href="apocalyptic%20literature">apocalyptic literature</a>. Although not as fully developed as the apocalyptic <a href="Vision%20%28spirituality%29">vision</a>s described in the <a href="Book%20of%20Daniel">Book of Daniel</a>, the "<a href="oracle">oracle</a>s", as they are titled in Zechariah 9–14, contain apocalyptic elements. One theme these oracles contain is descriptions of the <a href="Day%20of%20the%20Lord">Day of the Lord</a>, when "the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle" (Zechariah 14:3). These chapters also contain "pessimism about the present, but optimism for the future based on the expectation of an ultimate divine victory and the subsequent transformation of the cosmos".

The final word in Zechariah proclaims that on the Day of the Lord "There will be no Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts on that day" (14:21), proclaiming the need for purity in the Temple, which would come when God judges at the end of time. The <a href="Revised%20Standard%20Version">Revised Standard Version</a> has this: "There will be no trader in the house of the Lord of hosts on that day." In the <a href="Masoretic%20Text">Masoretic Text</a> it is: "and in that day there shall be no more a trafficker in the house of the Lord of hosts."

Book of Zephaniah

The Book of Zephaniah () is the ninth of the <a href="Twelve%20Minor%20Prophets">Twelve Minor Prophets</a>, preceded by the <a href="Book%20of%20Habakkuk">Book of Habakkuk</a> and followed by the <a href="Book%20of%20Haggai">Book of Haggai</a>. Zephaniah means "<a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a> has hidden/protected," or "Yahweh hides,".

The book's superscription attributes its authorship to "Zephaniah son of Cushi son of Gedaliah son of Amariah son of Hezekiah, in the days of <a href="Josiah">King Josiah</a> son of <a href="Amon%20of%20Judah">Amon of Judah</a>" (1:1, <a href="New%20Revised%20Standard%20Version">NRSV</a>). All that is known of <a href="Zephaniah">Zephaniah</a> comes from the text.

The name "Cushi," Zephaniah's father, means "Cushite" or "<a href="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a>n," and the text of Zephaniah mentions the sin and restoration of Ethiopians. While some have concluded from this that Zephaniah was a black Jew, <a href="Ehud%20Ben%20Zvi">Ehud Ben Zvi</a> maintains that, based on the context, "Cushi" must be understood as a personal name rather than an indicator of nationality. <a href="Abraham%20ibn%20Ezra">Abraham ibn Ezra</a> interpreted the name Hezekiah in the superscription as <a href="Hezekiah">King Hezekiah of Judah</a>, though that is not a claim advanced in the text of Zephaniah.

As with many of the other prophets, there is no external evidence to directly associate composition of the book with a prophet by the name of Zephaniah. Some scholars, such as Kent Harold Richards and Jason DeRouchie, consider the words in Zephaniah to reflect a time early in the reign of King Josiah (640–609 BCE) before his reforms of 622 BCE took full effect, in which case the prophet may have been born during the reign of <a href="Manasseh%20of%20Judah">Manasseh</a> (698/687–642 BCE). Others agree that some portion of the book is postmonarchic, that is, dating to later than 586 BCE when the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Judah">Kingdom of Judah</a> fell in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%28587%20BC%29">Siege of Jerusalem</a>. Some who consider the book to have largely been written by a historical Zephaniah have suggested that he may have been a disciple of <a href="Isaiah">Isaiah</a> because of the two books' similar focus on rampant corruption and injustice in Judah.

If Zephaniah was largely composed during the monarchic period, then its composition was occasioned by Judah's refusal to obey its <a href="Covenant%20%28biblical%29">covenant</a> obligations toward Yahweh despite having seen <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Israel%20%28Samaria%29">Israel's</a> <a href="Assyrian%20captivity">exile</a> a generation or two previously—an exile that the Judahite literary tradition attributed to Yahweh's anger against Israel's disobedience to his covenant. In this historical context, Zephaniah urges Judah to obedience to Yahweh, saying that "perhaps" he will forgive them if they do.

"The HarperCollins Study Bible" supplies headings for the book as follows:

More consistently than any other prophetic book, Zephaniah focuses on "the day of the Lord," developing this tradition from its first appearance in <a href="Book%20of%20Amos">Amos</a>. The day of the Lord tradition also appears in <a href="Book%20of%20Isaiah">Isaiah</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Ezekiel">Ezekiel</a>, <a href="Book%20of%20Obadiah">Obadiah</a>, and <a href="Book%20of%20Joel">Joel</a>.

The book begins by describing Yahweh's judgement. The threefold repetition of "I will sweep away" in emphasizes the totality of the destruction, as the number three often signifies complete perfection in the Bible. The order of creatures in ("humans and animals ... the birds ... the fish") is the opposite of the creation order in , signifying an undoing of creation. This is also signified by the way that "from the face of the earth" forms an "<a href="inclusio">inclusio</a>" around , hearkening back to how the phrase is used in the <a href="Genesis%20flood%20narrative">Genesis flood narrative</a> in , , , where it also connotes an undoing of creation.

As is common in prophetic literature in the Bible, a "remnant" survives Yahweh's judgement in Zephaniah by humbly seeking refuge in Yahweh. The book concludes in an announcement of hope and joy, as Yahweh "bursts forth in joyful divine celebration" over his people.

Because of its hopeful tone of the gathering and restoration of exiles, has been included in <a href="Jewish%20liturgy">Jewish liturgy</a>.

Zephaniah served as a major inspiration for the <a href="medieval">medieval</a> <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> <a href="hymn">hymn</a> "<a href="Dies%20Irae">Dies Irae</a>," whose title and opening words are from the <a href="Vulgate">Vulgate</a> translation of .

Book of Habakkuk

The Book of Habakkuk is the eighth book of the 12 <a href="minor%20prophets">minor prophets</a> of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>. It is attributed to the prophet <a href="Habakkuk">Habakkuk</a>, and was probably composed in the late 7th century BC.

Of the three chapters in the book, the first two are a dialog between <a href="Yahweh">Yahweh</a> and the prophet. The central message, that "the just shall live by his faith" (2:4), plays an important role in <a href="Christian">Christian</a> thought. It is used in the <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Romans">Epistle to the</a> , <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Galatians">Epistle to the</a> , and the <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Hebrews">Epistle to the</a> as the starting point of the concept of <a href="faith">faith</a>. A copy of these chapters is included in the <a href="Habakkuk%20Commentary">Habakkuk Commentary</a>, found among the <a href="Dead%20Sea%20Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a>. Chapter 3 may be an independent addition, now recognized as a liturgical piece, but was possibly written by the same author as chapters 1 and 2.

The prophet Habakkuk is generally believed to have written his book in the mid-to-late 7th century BC, not long before the Babylonians' siege and capture of <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in 586 BC.

Habakkuk identifies himself as a <a href="prophet">prophet</a> in the opening verse. Due to the liturgical nature of the book of Habakkuk, there have been some scholars who think that the author may have been a temple prophet. Temple prophets are described in <a href="Books%20of%20Chronicles">1 Chronicles</a> 25:1 as using <a href="lyre">lyre</a>s, <a href="harp">harp</a>s and <a href="cymbal">cymbal</a>s. Some feel that this is echoed in Habakkuk 3:19b, and that Habakkuk may have been a <a href="Levite">Levite</a> and <a href="singing">singer</a> in the <a href="Temple%20in%20Jerusalem">Temple</a>.

There is no biographical information on the prophet Habakkuk; in fact less is known about him than any other writer of the Bible. The only canonical information that exists comes from the book that is named for him. His name comes either from the <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> word <a href="wikt%3A%D7%97%D7%91%D7%A7">חבק</a> ("khavak") meaning "embrace" or else from an <a href="Akkadian%20language">Akkadian</a> word "hambakuku" for a kind of plant.

Although his name does not appear in any other part of the Jewish Bible, <a href="Rabbinic%20literature">Rabbinic tradition</a> holds Habakkuk to be the Shunammite woman's son, who was restored to life by <a href="Elisha">Elisha</a> in <a href="Books%20of%20Kings">2 Kings</a> 4:16. The prophet Habakkuk is also mentioned in the narrative of <a href="Bel%20and%20the%20Dragon">Bel and the Dragon</a>, part of the <a href="deuterocanonical">deuterocanonical</a> <a href="additions%20to%20Daniel">additions to Daniel</a> in a late section of that book. In the superscription of the Old Greek version, Habakkuk is called the son of Joshua of the tribe of Levi. In this book Habakkuk is lifted by an angel to Babylon to provide Daniel with some food while he is in the lion's den.

It is unknown when Habakkuk lived and preached, but the reference to the rise and advance of the <a href="Neo-Babylonian%20Empire">Chaldeans</a> in 1:6–11 places him in the middle to last quarter of the 7th century BC. One possible period might be during the reign of <a href="Jehoiakim">Jehoiakim</a>, from 609–598 BC. The reasoning for this date is that it is during his reign that the Neo-Babylonian Empire of the Chaldeans was growing in power. The Babylonians marched against Jerusalem in 598 BC. Jehoiakim died while the Babylonians were marching towards Jerusalem and Jehoiakim's eighteen-year-old son <a href="Jehoiachin">Jehoiachin</a> assumed the throne. Upon the Babylonians' arrival, Jehoiachin and his advisors surrendered Jerusalem after a short time. With the transition of rulers and the young age and inexperience of Jehoiachin, they were not able to stand against Chaldean forces. There is a sense of an intimate knowledge of the Babylonian brutality in 1:12–17.

The book of Habakkuk is a book of the <a href="Tanakh">Tanakh</a> (the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>) and stands eighth in a section known as the <a href="Trei%20Asar">12 Minor Prophets</a> in the <a href="Masoretic%20text">Masoretic</a> and <a href="Septuagint">Greek texts</a>. In the Masoretic listing, it follows <a href="Nahum">Nahum</a> and precedes <a href="Zephaniah">Zephaniah</a>, who are considered to be his contemporaries.

The book consists of three chapters and the book is neatly divided into three different genres:


The major theme of Habakkuk is trying to grow from a faith of perplexity and doubt to the height of absolute trust in God. Habakkuk addresses his concerns over the fact that God will use the Babylonian empire to execute judgment on Judah for their sins.

Habakkuk openly questions the wisdom of God. In the first part of the first chapter, the Prophet sees the injustice among his people and asks why God does not take action. ""1:2 Yahweh, how long will I cry, and you will not hear? I cry out to you “Violence!” and will you not save?" – World English Bible."

In the middle part of <a href="Habakkuk%201">Chapter 1</a>, God explains that he will send the Chaldeans (also known as the Babylonians) to punish his people. "1:5 “Look among the nations, watch, and wonder marvelously; for I am working a work in your days, which you will not believe though it is told you. 1:6 For, behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling places that are not theirs. (World English Bible)"

One of the "Eighteen Emendations to the Hebrew Scriptures" appears at 1:12. (Actually there were more than eighteen.) According to the professional Jewish scribes, the Sopherim, the text of 1:12 was changed from "You [God] do not die" to "We shall not die." The Sopherim considered it disrespectful to say to God, ""You" do not die."

In the final part of the <a href="Habakkuk%201">first chapter</a>, the prophet expresses shock at God's choice of instrument for judgment. "1:13 You who have purer eyes than to see evil, and who cannot look on perversity, why do you tolerate those who deal treacherously, and keep silent when the wicked swallows up the man who is more righteous than he, (World English Bible <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20060222051554/http%3A//www.ebible.org/web/Habakkuk.htm"></a>)"

In <a href="Habakkuk%202">Chapter 2</a>, he awaits God's response to his challenge. God explains that He will also judge the Chaldeans, and much more harshly. "2:8 Because you have plundered many nations, all the remnant of the peoples will plunder you, because of men’s blood, and for the violence done to the land, to the city and to all who dwell in it. 2:9 Woe to him who gets an evil gain for his house, (World English Bible <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20060222051554/http%3A//www.ebible.org%3A80/web/Habakkuk.htm"></a>)"

Finally, in <a href="Habakkuk%203">Chapter 3</a>, Habakkuk expresses his ultimate faith in God, even if he doesn't fully understand.
"3:17 For though the fig tree doesn’t flourish, nor fruit be in the vines; the labor of the olive fails, the fields yield no food; the flocks are cut off from the fold, and there is no herd in the stalls: 3:18 yet I will rejoice in Yahweh. I will be joyful in the God of my salvation! (World English Bible <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20060222051554/http%3A//www.ebible.org%3A80/web/Habakkuk.htm"></a>)"

The book of Habakkuk is accepted as <a href="Biblical%20canon">canonical</a> by adherents of the Jewish and Christian faiths. A commentary on the first two chapters of the book was found among the Dead Sea Scrolls at Qumran. Passages from Habakkuk are quoted by authors of the New Testament, and its message has inspired modern Christian hymn writers.

The Book of Habakkuk is the eighth book of the Twelve Prophets of the <a href="Hebrew%20Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, and this collection appears in all copies of texts of the <a href="Septuagint">Septuagint</a>, the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> translation of the Hebrew Bible completed by 132 BC. Likewise, the book of <a href="Sirach">Sirach</a> (or Ecclesiasticus), also written in the 2nd century BC, mentions "<a href="Trei%20Asar">The Twelve Prophets</a>".

A partial copy of Habakkuk itself is included in the <a href="Habakkuk%20Commentary">Habakkuk Commentary</a>, a "<a href="pesher">pesher</a>" found among the original seven <a href="Dead%20Sea%20Scrolls">Dead Sea Scrolls</a> discovered in 1947. The Commentary contains a copy of the first two chapters of Habakkuk, but not of the third chapter. The writer of the "pesher" draws a comparison between the Babylonian invasion of the original text and the Roman threat of the writer's own period. What is even more significant than the commentary in the "pesher" is the quoted text of Habakkuk itself. The divergences between the Hebrew text of the scroll and the standard <a href="Masoretic%20Text">Masoretic Text</a> are startlingly minimal. The biggest differences are word order, small grammatical variations, addition or omission of conjunctions, and spelling variations, but these are small enough to not to damage the meaning of the text.

Some scholars suggest that Chapter 3 may be a later independent addition to the book, in part because it is not included among the Dead Sea Scrolls. However, this chapter does appear in all copies of the Septuagint, as well as in texts from as early as the 3rd century BC. This final chapter is a poetic praise of God, and has some similarities with texts found in the <a href="Book%20of%20Daniel">Book of Daniel</a>. However, the fact that the third chapter is written in a different style, as a liturgical piece, does not necessarily mean that Habakkuk was not also its author. Its omission from the Dead Sea Scrolls is attributed to the inability of the <a href="Qumran">Qumran</a> sect to fit Habakkuk's theology with their own narrow viewpoint.

 is well known in Christianity:
The second half of this verse is quoted by some of the earliest <a href="Christian">Christian</a> writers. Although this passage is only three words in the original Hebrew, it is quoted three times in the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>. <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul the Apostle</a> quotes this verse twice in his <a href="epistles">epistles</a>: in <a href="Romans%201">Epistle to the Romans</a> () and again in <a href="Galatians%203">Epistle to the Galatians</a> (). In doing so, Paul extends Habakkuk's original concept of righteous living at the present time into a future life. The same verse is quoted in <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Hebrews">Epistle to the Hebrews</a> (), where Habakkuk's vision is tied to <a href="Christ">Christ</a> and used to comfort the church during a period of persecution. These three epistles are considered to be "the three great doctrinal books of the New Testament," and Habakkuk's statement concerning faith forms the backbone of each book.

Modern Christian <a href="hymn">hymn</a>s have been inspired by the words of the prophet Habakkuk. The Christian hymn "", written in 1900 by <a href="William%20J.%20Kirkpatrick">William J. Kirkpatrick</a>, is based on <a href="Habakkuk%202%23Verse%2020">verse 2:20</a>. The fourth verse of <a href="William%20Cowper">William Cowper</a>'s hymn "Sometimes a Light Surprises", written in 1779, quotes .

Irish composer <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Charles Villiers Stanford</a> set slightly revised portions of text from the first and second chapters of Habakkuk in his piece for SATB choir, Soprano and Tenor soloist and organ, "For Lo, I Raise Up".

Backward compatibility

Backward compatibility is a property of a system, product, or technology that allows for <a href="interoperability">interoperability</a> with an older <a href="legacy%20system">legacy system</a>, or with <a href="Input/output">input</a> designed for such a system, especially in <a href="telecommunications">telecommunications</a> and <a href="computing">computing</a>. Backward compatibility is sometimes abbreviated to BC, or called downward compatibility. Modifying a system in a way that does not allow backward compatibility is sometimes called "<a href="wikt%3Abreaking%20change">breaking</a>" backward compatibility. A complementary concept is <a href="forward%20compatibility">forward compatibility</a>, which is a design philosophy, usually based on <a href="open%20standard">open standard</a>s, that strives for methods that will continue to work with newer and future products. Design that is forward-compatible usually has a <a href="Technology%20roadmap">roadmap</a> for compatibility with future standards and products.

The associated benefits of backward compatibility are the appeal to an existing user base through an inexpensive <a href="upgrade">upgrade path</a> as well as the <a href="network%20effect">network effect</a>, which is particularly important, as it increases the value of goods and services proportionally to the size of the user base.

A good example is the Sony <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> (PS2) which was backward compatible with games for its predecessor <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation (PSX or PSOne)</a>. While the PS2's selection of launch titles was small, sales of the console were nonetheless strong in 2000-2001 thanks to the large library of games for the preceding PSX/PSOne. This bought time for the PS2 to grow a large installed base and developers to release more quality PS2 games for the crucial 2001 holiday season.

The associated costs of backward compatibility are a higher <a href="bill%20of%20materials">bill of materials</a> if hardware is required to support the legacy systems; increased complexity of the product that may lead to longer <a href="time%20to%20market">time to market</a>, technological hindrances, and slowing innovation; and increased expectations from users in terms of compatibility.

A good example is the Sony <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, as the first PS3 iteration was expensive to manufacture in part due to including the <a href="Emotion%20Engine">Emotion Engine</a> from the preceding PS2 in order to run PS2 games, since the PS3 architecture was completely different from the PS2. Subsequent PS3 hardware revisions have eliminated the Emotion Engine as it saved production costs while removing the ability to run PS2 titles, as Sony found out that backwards compatibility was not a major selling point for the PS3 in 2006-2009, in contrast to the PS2 in 2000-2001. The PS3's chief competitor, the Microsoft <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>, took a different approach to backwards compatibility by using software emulation in order to run games from the first <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a>, rather than including legacy hardware from the original Xbox which was quite different than the Xbox 360, however Microsoft stopped releasing emulation profiles after 2007.

A simple example of both backward and forward compatibility is the introduction <a href="FM%20broadcasting">FM radio</a> in <a href="stereophonic%20sound">stereo</a>. FM radio was initially <a href="monaural">mono</a>, with only one audio channel represented by one <a href="signal%20%28electrical%20engineering%29">signal</a>. With the introduction of two-channel stereo FM radio, a large number of listeners had only mono FM receivers. Forward compatibility for mono receivers with stereo signals was achieved through sending the sum of both left and right audio channels in one signal and the difference in another signal. That allows mono FM receivers to receive and decode the sum signal while ignoring the difference signal, which is necessary only for separating the audio channels. Stereo FM receivers can receive a mono signal and decode it without the need for a second signal, and they can separate a sum signal to left and right channels if both sum and difference signals are received. Without the requirement for backward compatibility, a simpler method could have been chosen.

Full backward compatibility is particularly important in computer <a href="instruction%20set">instruction set</a> architectures, one of the most successful being the <a href="x86">x86</a> family of <a href="microprocessor">microprocessor</a>s. Their full backward compatibility spans back to the <a href="Intel%208080">Intel 8080</a> processors produced in 1974 but not to its predecessor, the <a href="Intel%208008">Intel 8008</a>. The fully backward compatible processors can process the same <a href="executable">binary executable software instructions</a> as their predecessors, allowing the use of a newer processor without having to acquire new <a href="application%20software">applications</a> or <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>s. Similarly, the success of the <a href="Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi</a> digital communication standard is attributed to its broad forward and backward compatibility; it became more popular than other standards that were not backward compatible.

<a href="Compiler">Compiler</a> backward compatibility may refer to the ability of a compiler of a newer version of the language to accept programs or data that worked under the previous version.

A data format is said to be backward compatible with its predecessor if every message or file that is valid under the old format is still valid, retaining its meaning under the new format.

<doc id="4460" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4460" title="Bacterial conjugation">
Bacterial conjugation

Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between <a href="Bacteria">bacterial cells</a> by direct cell-to-cell contact or by a bridge-like connection between two cells. It is a mechanism of <a href="horizontal%20gene%20transfer">horizontal gene transfer</a> as are <a href="Transformation%20%28genetics%29">transformation</a> and <a href="Transduction%20%28genetics%29">transduction</a> although these two other mechanisms do not involve cell-to-cell contact.

Bacterial conjugation is often regarded as the bacterial equivalent of <a href="sexual%20reproduction">sexual reproduction</a> or <a href="mating">mating</a> since it involves the exchange of genetic material. However, it 
is not sexual reproduction, since no exchange of gamete occurs. During conjugation the "donor" cell provides a conjugative or mobilizable genetic element that is most often a <a href="plasmid">plasmid</a> or <a href="transposon">transposon</a>. Most conjugative plasmids have systems ensuring that the "recipient" cell does not already contain a similar element.

The genetic information transferred is often beneficial to the recipient. Benefits may include <a href="antibiotic%20resistance">antibiotic resistance</a>, <a href="xenobiotic">xenobiotic</a> tolerance or the ability to use new <a href="metabolites">metabolites</a>. Such beneficial plasmids may be considered bacterial <a href="endosymbionts">endosymbionts</a>. Other elements, however, may be viewed as bacterial <a href="parasitism">parasites</a> and conjugation as a mechanism evolved by them to allow for their spread.

The process was discovered in 1946 by <a href="Joshua%20Lederberg">Joshua Lederberg</a> and <a href="Edward%20Tatum">Edward Tatum</a>.

Conjugation diagram


The F-plasmid is an <a href="episome">episome</a> (a plasmid that can integrate itself into the bacterial <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a> by <a href="Homologous%20recombination%23In%20bacteria">homologous recombination</a>) with a length of about 100 <a href="kilo-base%20pair">kb</a>. It carries its own <a href="origin%20of%20replication">origin of replication</a>, the "oriV", and an origin of transfer, or "oriT". There can only be one copy of the F-plasmid in a given bacterium, either free or integrated, and bacteria that possess a copy are called "F-positive" or "F-plus" (denoted F). Cells that lack F plasmids are called "F-negative" or "F-minus" (F) and as such can function as recipient cells.

Among other genetic information, the F-plasmid carries a "tra" and "trb" <a href="locus%20%28genetics%29">locus</a>, which together are about 33 kb long and consist of about 40 <a href="gene">gene</a>s. The "tra" locus includes the "pilin" gene and regulatory genes, which together form <a href="pilus">pili</a> on the cell surface. The locus also includes the genes for the <a href="protein">protein</a>s that attach themselves to the surface of F bacteria and initiate conjugation. Though there is some debate on the exact mechanism of conjugation it seems that the pili are not the structures through which DNA exchange occurs. This has been shown in experiments where the pilus are allowed to make contact, but then are denatured with SDS and yet DNA transformation still proceeds. Several proteins coded for in the "tra" or "trb" locus seem to open a channel between the bacteria and it is thought that the traD enzyme, located at the base of the pilus, initiates membrane fusion.

When conjugation is initiated by a signal the <a href="relaxase">relaxase</a> <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> creates a <a href="nick%20%28DNA%29">nick</a> in one of the strands of the conjugative plasmid at the "oriT". Relaxase may work alone or in a complex of over a dozen proteins known collectively as a <a href="relaxosome">relaxosome</a>. In the F-plasmid system the relaxase enzyme is called TraI and the relaxosome consists of TraI, TraY, TraM and the integrated host factor IHF. The nicked strand, or "T-strand", is then unwound from the unbroken strand and transferred to the recipient cell in a 5'-terminus to 3'-terminus direction. The remaining strand is replicated either independent of conjugative action (vegetative replication beginning at the "oriV") or in concert with conjugation (conjugative replication similar to the <a href="rolling%20circle">rolling circle</a> replication of <a href="lambda%20phage">lambda phage</a>). Conjugative replication may require a second nick before successful transfer can occur. A recent report claims to have inhibited conjugation with chemicals that mimic an intermediate step of this second nicking event.

If the F-plasmid that is transferred has previously been integrated into the donor's genome (producing an Hfr strain ["High Frequency of Recombination"]) some of the donor's chromosomal DNA may also be transferred with the plasmid DNA. The amount of chromosomal DNA that is transferred depends on how long the two conjugating bacteria remain in contact. In common laboratory strains of "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E. coli</a>" the transfer of the entire bacterial chromosome takes about 100 minutes. The transferred DNA can then be integrated into the recipient genome via <a href="homologous%20recombination">homologous recombination</a>.

A cell culture that contains in its population cells with non-integrated F-plasmids usually also contains a few cells that have accidentally integrated their plasmids. It is these cells that are responsible for the low-frequency chromosomal gene transfers that occur in such cultures. Some strains of bacteria with an integrated F-plasmid can be isolated and grown in pure culture. Because such strains transfer chromosomal genes very efficiently they are called <a href="Hfr%20cell">Hfr</a> (high frequency of recombination). The "E. coli" <a href="genome">genome</a> was originally mapped by interrupted mating experiments in which various Hfr cells in the process of conjugation were sheared from recipients after less than 100 minutes (initially using a Waring blender). The genes that were transferred were then investigated.

Since integration of the F-plasmid into the "E. coli" chromosome is a rare spontaneous occurrence, and since the numerous genes promoting DNA transfer are in the plasmid genome rather than in the bacterial genome, it has been argued that conjugative bacterial gene transfer, as it occurs in the E. coli Hfr system, is not an evolutionary adaptation of the bacterial host, nor is it likely ancestral to eukaryotic sex.

Conjugation in "Mycobacteria smegmatis", like conjugation in "E. coli", requires stable and extended contact between a donor and a recipient strain, is DNase resistant, and the transferred DNA is incorporated into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination. However, unlike "E. coli" Hfr conjugation, mycobacterial conjugation is chromosome rather than plasmid based. Furthermore, in contrast to "E. coli" Hfr conjugation, in "M. smegmatis" all regions of the chromosome are transferred with comparable efficiencies. The lengths of the donor segments vary widely, but have an average length of 44.2kb. Since a mean of 13 tracts are transferred, the average total of transferred DNA per genome is 575kb. This process is referred to as "Distributive conjugal transfer." Gray et al. found substantial blending of the parental genomes as a result of conjugation and regarded this blending as reminiscent of that seen in the meiotic products of sexual reproduction.

Bacteria related to the <a href="diazotroph">nitrogen fixing</a> "<a href="Rhizobia">Rhizobia</a>" are an interesting case of inter-<a href="Kingdom%20%28biology%29">kingdom</a> conjugation. For example, the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid of "<a href="Agrobacterium">Agrobacterium</a>" and the root-tumor inducing (Ri) plasmid of "A. rhizogenes" contain genes that are capable of transferring to plant cells. The expression of these genes effectively transforms the plant cells into <a href="opines">opine</a>-producing factories. Opines are used by the bacteria as sources of nitrogen and energy. Infected cells form <a href="Agrobacterium%20tumefaciens">crown gall</a> or <a href="Agrobacterium%20rhizogenes">root tumors</a>. The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus <a href="endosymbiont">endosymbiont</a>s of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant.

The Ti and Ri plasmids can also be transferred between bacteria using a system (the "tra", or <a href="Transfer%20gene">transfer, operon</a>) that is different and independent of the system used for inter-kingdom transfer (the "vir", or <a href="virulence">virulence</a>, operon). Such transfers create virulent strains from previously avirulent strains.

Conjugation is a convenient means for <a href="genetic%20engineering">transferring genetic material</a> to a variety of targets. In laboratories, successful transfers have been reported from bacteria to yeast, plants, mammalian cells, <a href="diatom">diatom</a>s and isolated mammalian <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>. Conjugation has advantages over other forms of genetic transfer including minimal disruption of the target's <a href="Cellular%20membrane">cellular envelope</a> and the ability to transfer relatively large amounts of genetic material (see the above discussion of "E. coli" chromosome transfer). In plant engineering, "Agrobacterium"-like conjugation complements other standard vehicles such as <a href="tobacco%20mosaic%20virus">tobacco mosaic virus</a> (TMV). While TMV is capable of infecting many plant families these are primarily <a href="Herbaceous%20plant">herbaceous</a> <a href="dicot">dicot</a>s. "Agrobacterium"-like conjugation is also primarily used for dicots, but <a href="monocot">monocot</a> recipients are not uncommon.

Galjoen

The galjoen, black bream, or blackfish ("Dichistius capensis") is a species of marine <a href="fish">fish</a> found only along the coast of southern Africa from <a href="Angola">Angola</a> to <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>. 
Galjoen is the <a href="National%20animal">national fish</a> of South Africa.

The galjoen is indigenous to the coasts of southern Africa from <a href="Angola">Angola</a> to <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, and is generally found around <a href="reefs">reefs</a> at shallow depths around , often near the shore.

This species can reach in <a href="fish%20measurement">total length</a> and a weight of . The body is compressed, and the fins are well developed, with prominent spines, 10 of them, with between 18 and 23 rays. The anal fin has three spines, and usually 13 or 14 rays, the pelvic fins have 1 spine and 5 rays, and the pectoral fins are typically shorter than the head. The body, fins, and head, with the except of the front of the snout, are covered in scales. The lips are thick, with strong curved incisors at the front of the mouth, with smaller teeth behind the front incisors.

The species usually feeds on red and coraline seaweed and red bait, small <a href="mussels">mussels</a> and <a href="barnacle">barnacle</a>s found off rocky shores, and appear in particular to be partial to the white mussels residing in the sandy beaches and inlets of the rocky outcrops along the southern coast.

In 2005, Attwood and Cowley extensively studied the movement of the species. tagging some 25,000 galjoen at four sites in reserves in South Africa and concluded that their overall movement remained localised, with some 95% of fish studied seeming to indicate a home area.

It is important to local <a href="commercial%20fisheries">commercial fisheries</a> and is also popular as a <a href="game%20fish">game fish</a>.

Due to their abundance in the shores off South Africa, galjoen is common in <a href="South%20African%20cuisine">South African cuisine</a>. A notable dish is the fish is sprinkled with pepper and lemon, or with lemon, mayonnaise and melted garlic butter and served with fresh bread and apricot jam.

Galjoen is the national fish of South Africa. The suggestion to make it the national fish came from Margaret Smith, wife of the ichthyologist <a href="J.%20L.%20B.%20Smith">J. L. B. Smith</a>, to find a marine equivalent to the <a href="Springbok">Springbok</a>.

The scientific name of "Coracinus capensis" is a reference to its black colour when found in rocky areas, "Coracinus" meaning "raven" or "black coloured"; in sandy areas it gives off a silver-bronze colour.

<doc id="4462" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4462" title="Blue crane">
Blue crane

The blue crane ("Grus paradisea"), also known as the Stanley crane and the paradise crane, is the national bird of <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>. The species is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN.

The blue crane is a tall, ground-dwelling bird, but is fairly small by the standards of the <a href="crane%20%28bird%29">crane</a> family. It is tall, with a wingspan of and weighs . Among standard measurements, the wing chord measures , the exposed <a href="Culmen%20%28bird%29">culmen</a> measures and the <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> measures . This crane is pale blue-gray in colour becoming darker on the upper head, neck and nape. From the crown to the lores, the plumage is distinctly lighter, sometimes whitish. The <a href="beak">bill</a> is ochre to greyish, with a pink tinge. The long wingtip <a href="feather">feather</a>s which trail to the ground. The primaries are black to slate grey, with dark coverts and blackish on the secondaries. Unlike most cranes, it has a relatively large head and a proportionately thin neck. Juveniles are similar but slightly lighter, with tawny coloration on the head, and no long wing plumes.

Blue cranes are birds of the dry grassy uplands, usually the pastured grasses of hills, valleys, and plains with a few scattered trees. They prefer areas in the nesting season that have access to both upland and <a href="wetland">wetland</a> areas, though they feed almost entirely in dry areas. They are altitudinal migrants, generally nesting in the lower grasslands of an elevation of around 1,300 to 2,000 m and moving down to lower altitudes for winter. Though historically found in areas of low human disturbance, the blue crane is currently thriving in the highly transformed agricultural areas of the Western Cape. This is the only portion of its range where the population is increasing, though they still face threats such as poisoning in the region.

Of the 15 species of crane, the blue crane has the most restricted distribution of all. Even species with lower population numbers now (such as <a href="Siberian%20crane">Siberian</a> or <a href="whooping%20crane">whooping crane</a>s) are found over a considerable range in their migratory movements. The blue crane is migratory, primarily altitudinal, but details are little known.

The blue crane is partially social, less so during the breeding season. There is a strict hierarchy in groups, with the larger adult males being dominant. They overlap in range with 3 other crane species but interactions with these species and other "large wader" type birds are not known. They are relentlessly aggressive to various other animals during the nesting season, attacking non-predatory species such as cattle, <a href="tortoise">tortoise</a>s, <a href="plover">plover</a>s and even <a href="sparrow">sparrow</a>s. Humans are also attacked if they approach a nest too closely, with the aggressive male having torn clothes and drawn blood in such cases.

Blue cranes feed from the ground and appear to rarely feed near wetland areas. Most of their diet is comprised by grasses and sedges, with many types fed on based on their proximity to the nests. They are also regularly <a href="Insectivore">insectivorous</a>, feeding on numerous, sizeable insects such as <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s. Small animals such as crabs, <a href="snail">snail</a>s, frogs, small <a href="lizard">lizard</a>s and snakes may supplement the diet, with such protein-rich food often being broken down and fed to the young.

The breeding period is highly seasonal, with eggs being recorded between October and March. Pair-formation amongst groups often beings in October, beginning with both potential parents running in circles with each other. The male then engages in a "dance" flings various objects in the air and then jumps. Eventually, a female from the group and the male appear to "select" each other and both engage in the dance of throwing objects and jumping. After the dance, mating commences in around two weeks.

In a great majority of known nests, two eggs are laid (rarely 1 or 3). Both males and females will incubate, with the male often incubating at night and, during the day, defending the nest territory while the female incubates. The incubation stage lasts around 30 days. The young are able to walk after two days and can swim well shortly thereafter. They are fed primarily by their mothers, who regurgitates food into the mouths. The chicks fledge in the age of 3–5 months. The young continue to be tended to until the next breeding season, at which time they are chased off by their parents.

While it remains common in parts of its historic range, and approx. 26 000 individuals remain, it began a sudden population decline from around 1980 and is now classified as vulnerable.

In the last two decades, the blue crane has largely disappeared from the <a href="Eastern%20Cape%20Province">Eastern Cape</a>, <a href="Lesotho">Lesotho</a>, and <a href="Swaziland">Swaziland</a>. The population in the northern <a href="Free%20State%20Province">Free State</a>, <a href="Limpopo%20Province">Limpopo</a>, <a href="Gauteng%20Province">Gauteng</a>, <a href="Mpumalanga%20Province">Mpumalanga</a> and <a href="North%20West%20Province%20%28South%20Africa%29">North West Province</a> has declined by up to 90%. The majority of the remaining population is in eastern and southern South Africa, with a small and separate population in the <a href="Etosha%20Pan">Etosha Pan</a> of northern <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>. Occasionally, isolated breeding pairs are found in five neighbouring countries.

The primary causes of the sudden decline of the blue crane are human population growth, the conversion of grasslands into commercial tree plantations, and poisoning: deliberate (to protect crops) or accidental (baits intended for other species, and as a side-effect of <a href="crop%20dusting">crop dusting</a>).

The South African government has stepped up legal protection for the blue crane. Other conservation measures are focusing on research, habitat management, education, and recruiting the help of private landowners.

The blue crane is one of the species to which the "Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds" (<a href="AEWA">AEWA</a>) applies.

The blue crane is culturally significant to the <a href="Xhosa%20people">Xhosa people</a>, who call it "indwe". Traditionally, when a man distinguished himself in battle or otherwise, he was often decorated by a chief with blue crane feathers in a ceremory called "ukundzabela". Men so honoured, who would wear the feathers sticking out of their hair, were known as men of "ugaba" (trouble)—the implication being that if trouble arose, they would reinstate peace and order.

Babrak Karmal

"<a href="Mohammed%20Hussein">Mohammed Hussein</a> redirects here; for the Muslim cleric, see <a href="Muhammad%20Ahmad%20Hussein">Muhammad Ahmad Hussein</a>."

Babrak Karmal (<a href="Dari%20language">Dari</a>/, born Sultan Hussein; 6 January 1929 – 1 or 3 December 1996) was an Afghan <a href="politician">politician</a> who was installed as president of Afghanistan by the USSR when <a href="Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan%20War">they invaded in 1979</a>. Karmal was born in <a href="Kamari">Kamari</a> and educated at <a href="Kabul%20University">Kabul University</a>. When the <a href="People%27s%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Afghanistan">People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan</a> (PDPA) was formed, Karmal became one of its leading members, having been introduced to <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a> by <a href="Mir%20Akbar%20Khyber">Mir Akbar Khyber</a> during his imprisonment for activities deemed too radical by the government. He eventually became the leader of the <a href="Parcham">Parcham</a> faction. When the PDPA split in 1967, the Parcham-faction established a Parcham PDPA, while their ideological nemesis, the <a href="Khalq">Khalq</a>s, established a Khalqist PDPA. Under Karmal's leadership, the Parchamite PDPA participated in <a href="Mohammad%20Daoud%20Khan">Mohammad Daoud Khan</a>'s rise to power, and his subsequent regime. While relations were good at the beginning, Daoud began a major purge of leftist influence in the mid-1970s. This in turn led to the reformation of the PDPA in 1977. The PDPA took power in the 1978 <a href="Saur%20Revolution">Saur Revolution</a>.

Karmal was appointed Deputy Chairman of the <a href="Revolutionary%20Council%20%28Afghanistan%29">Revolutionary Council</a>, synonymous with vice head of state, in the communist government. The Parchamite faction found itself under significant pressure by the Khalqists soon after taking power. In June 1978, a <a href="Central%20Committee%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Afghanistan">PDPA Central Committee</a> meeting voted in favor of giving the Khalqist faction exclusive control over PDPA policy. This decision was followed by a failed Parchamite coup, after which <a href="Hafizullah%20Amin">Hafizullah Amin</a>, a Khalqist, initiated a purge against the Parchamites. Karmal survived this purge but was exiled to <a href="Prague">Prague</a>. Karmal remained in exile until December 1979, when the <a href="Soviet%20war%20in%20Afghanistan">Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan</a> (with the consent of the Afghan government) to stabilize the country.

Karmal was promoted to Chairman of the Revolutionary Council and <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Afghanistan">Chairman</a> of the <a href="Council%20of%20Ministers%20%28Afghanistan%29">Council of Ministers</a> on 27 December 1979. He remained in office until 1981, when he was succeeded by <a href="Sultan%20Ali%20Keshtmand">Sultan Ali Keshtmand</a>. Throughout his term, Karmal worked to establish a support base for the PDPA by introducing several reforms. Among these were the <a href="Fundamental%20Principles%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Afghanistan">Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan</a>, introducing a general amnesty for those people imprisoned during <a href="Nur%20Mohammad%20Taraki">Nur Mohammad Taraki</a>'s and Amin's rule. He also replaced the Khalqist flag with a more traditional one. These policies failed to increase the PDPA's legitimacy in the eyes of the Afghan people.

These policy failures, and the stalemate that ensued after the Soviet intervention, led the Soviet leadership to become highly critical of Karmal's leadership. Under <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, the Soviet Union deposed Karmal and replaced him with <a href="Mohammad%20Najibullah">Mohammad Najibullah</a>. Following his loss of power, he was again exiled, this time to <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>. He was allowed to return to Afghanistan in 1991 by the Najibullah government. Back in Afghanistan he became an associate of <a href="Abdul%20Rashid%20Dostum">Abdul Rashid Dostum</a>, and helped remove the Najibullah government from power. Not long after, in 1996, Karmal died from <a href="liver%20cancer">liver cancer</a>.

Karmal was born Sultan Hussein on 6 January 1929, was the son of Muhammad Hussein Hashem, a <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> in the <a href="Afghan%20National%20Army">Afghan Army</a> and former governor of the province of Paktia, and was the second of five siblings. His family was one of the wealthier families in Kabul. His ethnic background is disputed, some claim that he was <a href="Tajik%20people">Tajik</a> who represented himself as a <a href="Ghilzai">Ghilzai</a> <a href="Pashtun%20people">Pashtun</a> but others claim that he descended from <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> ancestors of <a href="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>. In 1986, Karmal announced that he, and his brother Mahmud Baryalay, were Pashtun because their mother came from the <a href="Mullakhel">Mullakhel</a> branch of the Pashtuns. However, this was controversial, considering that lineage in Afghanistan is supposed to be traced through the father, not the mother. The accusation that he was of Indian Muslim ancestry comes from the fact that his birthname, Sultan Hussein, is a common Indian Muslim name. In addition, Karmal's own father denied his own ethnicity; Karmal's father was a Tajik. To further confuse the matter, Karmal spoke <a href="Dari%20%28Eastern%20Persian%29">Dari</a> (Persian) and not <a href="Pashto%20language">Pashto</a>.

Karmal was born in <a href="Kamari">Kamari</a>, a village close to <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a>. He attended <a href="Nejat%20High%20School">Nejat High School</a>, a German-speaking school, and graduated from it in 1948, and applied to enter the Faculty of Law and Political Science of <a href="Kabul%20University">Kabul University</a>. Karmal's application was turned down because of his student union activities. He studied at the College of Law and Political Science at Kabul University from 1951 to 1953. In 1953 Karmal was arrested because of his student union activities, but was released three years later in 1956 in an amnesty by <a href="Muhammad%20Daoud%20Khan">Muhammad Daoud Khan</a>. Shortly after, in 1957, Karmal found work as an English and German translator, before quitting and leaving for military training. Karmal graduated from the College of Law and Political Science in 1960, and in 1961, he found work as an employee in the Compilation and Translation Department of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Education%20%28Afghanistan%29">Ministry of Education</a>. From 1961 to 1963 he worked in the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Planning%20%28Afghanistan%29">Ministry of Planning</a>. When his mother died, Karmal left with his maternal aunt to live somewhere else. His father disowned him because of his leftist views. Karmal was involved in much <a href="%3Awikt%3Adebauchery">debauchery</a>, which was controversial in the mostly conservative Afghan society.

Imprisoned from 1953 to 1956, Karmal befriended fellow inmate <a href="Mir%20Akbar%20Khyber">Mir Akbar Khyber</a>, who introduced Karmal to <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a>. Karmal changed his name from Sultan Hussein to Babrak Karmal, which means "Comrade of the Workers'" in <a href="Pashtun%20language">Pashtun</a>, to disassociate himself from his <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a> background. When he was released from prison, he continued his activities in the student union, and began to promote Marxism. Karmal spent the rest of the 1950s and the early 1960s becoming involved with Marxist organizations, of which there were at least four in Afghanistan at the time; two of the four were established by Karmal. When the <a href="1964%20Afghan%20Provisional%20Constitution">1964 Afghan Provisional Constitution</a>, which legalised the establishment of new political entities, was introduced several prominent Marxists agreed to establish a communist political party. The <a href="People%27s%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Afghanistan">People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan</a> (PDPA, the Communist Party) was established in January 1965 in <a href="Nur%20Muhammad%20Taraki">Nur Muhammad Taraki</a>'s home. Factionalism within the PDPA quickly became a problem; the party split into the <a href="Khalq">Khalq</a> led by Taraki alongside <a href="Hafizullah%20Amin">Hafizullah Amin</a>, and the <a href="Parcham">Parcham</a> led by Karmal.

During the <a href="Afghan%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201965">1965 parliamentary election</a> Karmal was one of four PDPA members elected to the lower house of parliament; the three others were <a href="Anahita%20Ratebzad">Anahita Ratebzad</a>, <a href="Nur%20Ahmed%20Nur">Nur Ahmed Nur</a> and <a href="Fezanul%20Haq%20Fezan">Fezanul Haq Fezan</a>. No Khalqists were elected; however, Amin was 50 votes short of being elected. The Parchamite victory may be explained by the simple fact that Karmal could contribute financially to the PDPA electoral campaign. Karmal became a leading figure within the student movement in the 1960s, electing <a href="Mohammad%20Hashim%20Maiwandwal">Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal</a> as Prime Minister after a student demonstration (called for by Karmal) concluded with three deaths under the former leadership.

In 1967, the PDPA unofficially split into two formal parties, one Khalqist and one Parchamist. The dissolution of the PDPA was initiated by the closing down of the Khalqist newspaper, "<a href="Khalq%20%28newspaper%29">Khalq</a>". Karmal criticised the "Khalq" for being too <a href="communism">communist</a>, and believed that its leadership should have hidden its Marxist orientation instead of promoting it. According to the official version of events, the majority of the <a href="Central%20Committee%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Afghanistan">PDPA Central Committee</a> rejected Karmal's criticism. The vote was a close one, and it is reported that Taraki expanded the Central Committee to win the vote; this plan resulted in eight of the new members becoming politically unaligned with and one switching to the Parchamite side. Karmal and half the PDPA Central Committee left the PDPA to establish a Parchamite-led PDPA. Officially the split was caused by ideological differences, but the party may have divided between the different leadership styles and plans of Taraki versus Karmal. Taraki wanted to model the party after <a href="Leninism">Leninist norms</a> while Karmal wanted to establish a democratic front. Other differences were socioeconomic. The majority of Khalqists came from rural areas; hence they were poorer, and were of Pashtun origin. The Parchamites were urban, richer, and spoke <a href="Dari%20%28Persian%20dialect%29">Dari</a> more often than not. The Khalqists accused the Parchamites of having a connection with the monarchy, and because of it, referred to the Parchamite PDPA as the "Royal Communist Party". Both Karmal and Amin retained their seats in the lower house of parliament in the <a href="Afghan%20parliamentary%20election%2C%201969">1969 parliamentary election</a>.

<a href="Mohammed%20Daoud%20Khan">Mohammed Daoud Khan</a>, in collaboration with the Parchamite PDPA and radical military officers, overthrew the <a href="monarchy">monarchy</a> and instituted the Afghan <a href="Republic%20of%20Afghanistan">Republic in 1973</a>. After Daoud's seizure of power, an American embassy cable stated that the new government had established a Soviet-style Central Committee, in which Karmal and <a href="Mir%20Akbar%20Khyber">Mir Akbar Khyber</a> were given leading positions. Most ministries were given to Parchamites; <a href="Hassan%20Sharq">Hassan Sharq</a> became Deputy Prime Minister, Major <a href="Faiz%20Mohammad%20%28politician%29">Faiz Mohammad</a> became <a href="Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Afghanistan%29">Minister of Internal Affairs</a> and <a href="Nematullah%20Pazhwak">Nematullah Pazhwak</a> became <a href="Ministry%20of%20Education%20%28Afghanistan%29">Minister of Education</a>. The Parchamites took control over the ministries of finance, agriculture, communications and border affairs. The new government quickly suppressed the opposition, and secured their power base. At first, the National Front government between Daoud and the Parchamites seemed to work. By 1975, Daoud had strengthened his position by enhancing the executive, legislative and judicial powers of the Presidency. To the dismay of the Parchamites, all parties other than the <a href="National%20Revolutionary%20Party%20%28Afghanistan%29">National Revolutionary Party</a> (NRP, established by Daoud) were made illegal.

Shortly after the ban on opposition to the NRP, Daoud began a massive purge of Parchamites in government. Mohammad lost his position as interior minister, <a href="Abdul%20Qadir%20%28Afghan%20communist%29">Abdul Qadir</a> was demoted, and Karmal was put under government surveillance. To mitigate Daoud's suddenly anti-communist directives, the Soviet Union reestablished the PDPA; Taraki was elected its General Secretary and Karmal, Second Secretary. While the <a href="Saur%20Revolution">Saur Revolution</a> (literally the April Revolution) was planned for August, the assassination of Khyber led to a chain of events which ended with the communists seizing power. Karmal, when taking power in 1979, accused Amin of ordering the assassination of Khyber.

Taraki was appointed Chairman of the Presidium of the <a href="Revolutionary%20Council%20%28Afghanistan%29">Revolutionary Council</a> and <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Afghanistan">Chairman</a> of the <a href="Council%20of%20Ministers%20%28Afghanistan%29">Council of Ministers</a>, retaining his post as PDPA general secretary. Taraki initially formed a government which consisted of both Khalqists and Parchamites; Karmal became Deputy Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, while Amin became <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Afghanistan%29">Minister of Foreign Affairs</a> and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers.<a href="Mohammad%20Aslam%20Watanjar">Mohammad Aslam Watanjar</a> became Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The two Parchamites Abdul Qadir and <a href="Mohammad%20Rafi">Mohammad Rafi</a>, became <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Afghanistan%29">Minister of Defence</a> and <a href="Ministry%20of%20Public%20Works%20%28Afghanistan%29">Minister of Public Works</a>, respectively. The appointment of Amin, Karmal and Watanjar led to splits within the Council of Ministers: the Khalqists answered to Amin; Karmal led the civilian Parchamites; and the military officers (who were Parchamites) were answerable to Watanjar (a Khalqist). The first conflict arose when the Khalqists wanted to give PDPA Central Committee membership to military officers who had participated in the <a href="Saur%20Revolution">Saur Revolution</a>; Karmal opposed such a move but was overruled. A PDPA Politburo meeting voted in favour of giving Central Committee membership to the officers.

On 27 June, three months after the <a href="Saur%20Revolution">Saur Revolution</a>, Amin outmaneuvered the Parchamites at a Central Committee meeting, giving the Khalqists exclusive right over formulating and deciding policy. A purge against the Parchamites was initiated by Amin and supported by Taraki on 1 July 1979. Karmal, fearing for his safety, went into hiding in one of his Soviet friends' homes. Karmal tried to contact <a href="Alexander%20Puzanov">Alexander Puzanov</a>, the <a href="Soviet%20ambassador%20to%20Afghanistan">Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan</a>, to talk about the situation. Puzanov refused, and revealed Karmal's location to Amin. It should be noted that the Soviets probably saved Karmal's life by sending him to the <a href="Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Czechoslovakia">Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia</a>. In exile, Karmal established a network with the remaining Parchamites in government. A coup to overthrow Amin was planned for 4 September 1979. Its leading members in Afghanistan were Qadir and the Army Chief of Staff General <a href="Shahpur%20Ahmedzai">Shahpur Ahmedzai</a>. The coup was planned for the Festival of Eid, in anticipation of relaxed military vigilance. The conspiracy failed when the Afghan ambassador to India told the Afghan leadership about the plan. Another purge was initiated, and Parchamite ambassadors were recalled. Few returned to Afghanistan; Karmal and <a href="Mohammad%20Najibullah">Mohammad Najibullah</a> stayed in their respective countries.

Amin was informed of the Soviet decision to <a href="Soviet%20war%20in%20Afghanistan">intervene in Afghanistan</a> and was initially supportive, but was assassinated. Under the command of the Soviets, Karmal ascended to power. On 27 December 1979 <a href="Radio%20Kabul">Radio Kabul</a> broadcast Karmal's pre-recorded speech to the Afghan people, saying: "Today the torture machine of Amin has been smashed, his accomplices – the primitive executioners, usurpers and murderers of tens of thousand of our fellow countrymen – fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, sons and daughters, children and old people ..." Karmal was not in Kabul when the speech was broadcast; he was in <a href="Bagram">Bagram</a>, protected by the <a href="KGB">KGB</a>.

That evening <a href="Yuri%20Andropov">Yuri Andropov</a>, the <a href="Chairman%20of%20the%20KGB">Chairman of the KGB</a>, congratulated Karmal on his rise to the Chairmanship of the Presidium of the <a href="Revolutionary%20Council%20%28Afghanistan%29">Revolutionary Council</a>, some time before Karmal received an official appointment. Karmal returned to Kabul on 28 December. He travelled alongside a Soviet military column. For the next few days Karmal lived in a villa on the outskirts of Kabul under the protection of the KGB. On 1 January 1980 <a href="Leonid%20Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a>, the <a href="General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">General Secretary</a> of the <a href="Central%20Committee%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>, and <a href="Alexei%20Kosygin">Alexei Kosygin</a>, the Soviet <a href="Premier%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Chairman</a> of the <a href="Council%20of%20Ministers%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">Council of Ministers</a>, congratulated Karmal on his "election" as leader.

When he came to power, Karmal promised an end to executions, the establishment of democratic institutions and free elections, the creation of a constitution, and legalization of alternative political parties. Prisoners incarcerated under the two previous governments would be freed in a general <a href="amnesty">amnesty</a>. He promised the creation of a coalition government which would not espouse <a href="socialism">socialism</a>. At the same time, he told the Afghan people that he had negotiated with the Soviet Union to give economic, military and political assistance. The mistrust most Afghans felt towards the government was a problem for Karmal. Many still remembered he had said he would protect private capital in 1978—a promise later proven to be a lie.

Karmal's three most important promises were the general amnesty of prisoners, the promulgation of the <a href="Fundamental%20Principles%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Afghanistan">Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan</a> and the adoption of a new flag containing the traditional black, red and green (the flag of Taraki and Amin was red). His government granted concessions to religious leaders and the restoration of confiscated property. Some property, which was confiscated during earlier land reforms, was also partially restored. All these measures, with the exception of the general amnesty of prisoners, were introduced gradually. Of 2,700 prisoners, 2,600 were released from prison; 600 of these were Parchamites. The general amnesty was greatly publicized by the government. While the event was hailed with enthusiasm by some, many others greeted the event with disdain, since their loved ones or associates had died during earlier purges. Amin had planned to introduce a general amnesty on 1 January 1980, to coincide with the PDPA's sixteenth anniversary.

Work on the Fundamental Principles had started under Amin: it guaranteed democratic rights such as <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a>, the right to security and life, the right to peaceful association, the right to demonstrate and the right that "no one would be accused of crime but in accord with the provisions of law" and that the accused had the right to a <a href="fair%20trial">fair trial</a>. The Fundamental Principles envisaged a democratic state led by the PDPA, the only party then permitted by law. The Revolutionary Council, the organ of supreme power, would convene twice every year. The Revolutionary Council in turn elected a Presidium which would take decisions on behalf of the Revolutionary Council when it was not in session. The Presidium consisted mostly of <a href="Politburo%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Afghanistan">PDPA Politburo</a> members. The state would safeguard three kinds of property: state, cooperative and private property. The Fundamental Principles said that the state had the right to change the Afghan economy from an economy where man was exploited to an economy were man was free. Another clause stated that the state had the right to take "families, both parents and children, under its supervision." While it looked democratic at the outset, the Fundamental Principles was based on contradictions.

The Fundamental Principles led to the establishment of two important state organs: the Special Revolutionary Court, a specialized court for crimes against <a href="national%20security">national security</a> and territorial integrity, and the Institute for Legal and Scientific Research and Legislative Affairs, the supreme legislative organ of state, This body could amend and draft laws, and introduce regulations and decrees on behalf of the government. The introduction of more Soviet-style institutions led the Afghan people to distrust the communist government even more.

With Karmal's ascension to power, Parchamites began to "settle old scores". <a href="Revolutionary%20Troika">Revolutionary Troika</a>s were created to arrest, sentence and execute people. Amin's guard were the first victims of the terror which ensued. Those commanders who had stayed loyal to Amin were arrested, filling the prisons. The Soviets protested, and Karmal replied, "As long as you keep my hands bound and do not let me deal with the Khalq faction there will be no unity in the PDPA and the government cannot become strong ... They tortured and killed us. They still hate us! They are the enemies of the party ..." Amin's daughter, along with her baby, was imprisoned for twelve years, until <a href="Mohammad%20Najibullah">Mohammad Najibullah</a>, then leader of the PDPA, released her. When Karmal took power, leading posts in the Party and Government bureaucracy were taken over by Parchamites. The Khalq faction was removed from power, and only <a href="technocrat">technocrat</a>s, <a href="Opportunism">opportunists</a> and individuals which the Soviets trusted would be appointed to the higher echelons of government. Khalqists remained in control of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20the%20Interior%20%28Afghanistan%29">Ministry of Interior</a>, but Parchamites were given control over <a href="KHAD">KHAD</a> and the secret police. The Parchamites and the Khalqists controlled an equal share of the military. Two out of Karmal's three Council of Ministers deputy chairmen were Khalqists. Khalqists controlled the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Communications%20%28Afghanistan%29">Ministry of Communications</a> and the interior ministry. Parchamites, on the other hand, controlled the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Afghanistan%29">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> and the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Afghanistan%29">Ministry of Defence</a>. In addition to the changes in government, the Parchamites held clear majority in the <a href="Central%20Committee%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Afghanistan">PDPA Central Committee</a>. Only one Khalqi, <a href="Saleh%20Mohammad%20Zeary">Saleh Mohammad Zeary</a>, was a member of the <a href="Secretariat%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Afghanistan">PDPA Secretariat</a> during Karmal's rule.

Over 14 and 15 March 1982 the PDPA held a party "conference" at the Kabul Polytechnic Institute instead of a party "congress", since a party congress would have given the Khalq faction a majority and could have led to a Khalqist takeover of the PDPA. The rules of holding a party conference were different, and the Parchamites had a three-fifths majority. This infuriated several Khalqists; the threat of expulsion did not lessen their anger. The conference was not successful, but it was portrayed as such by the official media. The conference broke up after one and a half days of a 3-day long program, because of the inter-party struggle for power between the Khalqists and the Parchamites. A "program of action" was introduced, and party rules were given minor changes. As an explanation of the low party membership, the official media also made it seem hard to become a member of the party.

When Karmal took power, he began expanding the support base of the PDPA. Karmal tried to persuade certain groups, which had been referred to <a href="class%20enemy">class enemies</a> of the revolution during Taraki and Amin's rule, to support the PDPA. Karmal appointed several non-communists to top positions. Between March and May 1980, 78 out of the 191 people appointed to government posts were not members of the PDPA. Karmal reintroduced the old Afghan custom of having an Islamic invocation every time the government issued a proclamation. In his first live speech to the Afghan people, Karmal called for the establishment of the <a href="National%20Front%20%28Afghanistan%29">National Fatherland Front</a> (NFF); the NFF's founding congress was held in June 1981. Unfortunately for Karmal, his policies did not lead to a notable increase in support for his regime, and it did not help Karmal that most Afghans saw the Soviet intervention as an invasion.

By 1981, the government gave up on political solutions to the conflict. At the fifth PDPA Central Committee plenum in June, Karmal resigned from his Council of Ministers chairmanship and was replaced by <a href="Sultan%20Ali%20Keshtmand">Sultan Ali Keshtmand</a>, while <a href="Nur%20Ahmad%20Nur">Nur Ahmad Nur</a> was given a bigger role in the Revolutionary Council. This was seen as "base broadening". The previous weight given to non-PDPA members in top positions ceased to be an important matter in the media by June 1981. This was significant, considering that up to five members of the Revolutionary Council were non-PDPA members. By the end of 1981, the previous contenders, who had been heavily presented in the media, were all gone; two were given ambassadorships, two ceased to be active in politics, and one continued as an advisor to the government. The other three changed sides, and began to work for the opposition.

The national policy of reconciliation continued: in January 1984 the land reform introduced by Taraki and Amin was drastically modified, the limits of landholdings were increased to win the support of middle class peasants, the literacy programme was continued, and concessions to women were made. In 1985 the <a href="Loya%20Jirga">Loya Jirga</a> was reconvened. The 1985 Loya Jirga was followed by a tribal jirga in September. In 1986 <a href="Abdul%20Rahim%20Hatef">Abdul Rahim Hatef</a>, a non-PDPA member, was elected to the NFF chairmanship. During the 1985–86 elections it was said that 60 percent of the elected officials were non-PDPA members. By the end of Karmal's rule, several non-PDPA members had high-level government positions.

In March 1979, the military budget was 6.4 million US$, which was 8.3 percent of the government budget, but only 2.2 of <a href="gross%20national%20product">gross national product</a>. After the Soviet intervention, the defence budget increased to 208 million US$ in 1980, and 325 million US$ by 1981. In 1982 it was reported that the government spent around 22 percent of total expenditure.

When the political solution failed (<a href="%23PDPA%20base">see "PDPA base" section</a>), the Afghan government and the Soviet military decided to solve the conflict militarily. The change from a political to a military solution did not come suddenly. It began in January 1981, as Karmal doubled wages for military personnel, issued several promotions, and decorated one general and thirteen colonels. The draft age was lowered, the obligatory length of arms duty was extended and the age for reservists was increased to thirty-five years of age. In June 1981, <a href="Assadullah%20Sarwari">Assadullah Sarwari</a> lost his seat in the PDPA Politburo, replaced by <a href="Mohammad%20Aslam%20Watanjar">Mohammad Aslam Watanjar</a>, a former tank commander and <a href="Ministry%20of%20Communications%20%28Afghanistan%29">Minister of Communications</a>, <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Mohammad%20Rafi%20%28politician%29">Mohammad Rafi</a> was made<a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Afghanistan%29">Minister of Defence</a> and <a href="Mohammad%20Najibullah">Mohammad Najibullah</a> appointed <a href="KHAD">KHAD</a> Chairman.

These measures were introduced due to the collapse of the army during the Soviet intervention. Before the invasion the army could field 100,000 troops, after the invasion only 25,000. Desertions were pandemic, and the recruitment campaigns for young people often drove them to the opposition. To better organize the military, seven military zones were established, each with its own Defence Council. The Defence Councils were established at the national, provincial and district level to empower the local PDPA. It is estimated that the Afghan government spent as much as 40 percent of government revenue on defense.

During the civil war and the ensuing <a href="Soviet%20war%20in%20Afghanistan">Soviet war in Afghanistan</a>, most of the country's infrastructure was destroyed. Normal patterns of economic activity were disrupted. The <a href="Gross%20national%20product">Gross national product</a> (GNP) fell substantially during Karmal's rule because of the conflict; trade and transport was disrupted with loss of labor and capital. In 1981 the Afghan GDP stood at 154.3 billion <a href="Afghan%20afghani">Afghan afghani</a>s, a drop from 159.7 billion in 1978. <a href="GNP%20per%20capita">GNP per capita</a> decreased from 7,370 in 1978 to 6,852 in 1981. The dominant form of economic activity was in the <a href="Agriculture%20in%20Afghanistan">agricultural sector</a>. Agriculture accounted for 63 percent of <a href="gross%20domestic%20product">gross domestic product</a> (GDP) in 1981; 56 percent of the labor force was working in agriculture in 1982. Industry accounted for 21 percent of GDP in 1982, and employed 10 percent of the labor force. All industrial enterprises were government-owned. The service sector, the smallest of the three, accounted for 10 percent of GDP in 1981, and employed an estimated one-third of the labour force. The <a href="balance%20of%20payments">balance of payments</a>, which had grown in the pre-communist administration of <a href="Muhammad%20Daoud%20Khan">Muhammad Daoud Khan</a>, decreased, turning negative by 1982 at 70.3 million $US. The only economic activity which grew substantially during Karmal's rule was <a href="export">export</a> and <a href="import">import</a>.

Karmal observed in the spring of 1983 that without Soviet intervention, "It is unknown what the destiny of the Afghan Revolution would be ... We are realists and we clearly realize that in store for us yet lie trials and deprivations, losses and difficulties." Two weeks before this statement <a href="Sultan%20Ali%20Keshtmand">Sultan Ali Keshtmand</a>, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, lamented the fact that half the schools and three-quarters of communications had been destroyed since 1979. The Soviet Union rejected several Western-made peace plans, such as the Carrington Plan, since they did not take into consideration the PDPA government. Most Western peace plans had been made in collaboration with the Afghan opposition forces. At the <a href="26th%20Congress%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">26th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a> (CPSU) <a href="Leonid%20Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a>, the <a href="General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">General Secretary</a> of the CPSU <a href="Central%20Committee%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Central Committee</a>, stated;
The stance of the Pakistani government was clear, demanding complete Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and the establishment of a non-PDPA government. Karmal, summarizing his discussions with Iran and Pakistan, said "Iran and Pakistan have so far not opted for concrete and constructive positions." During Karmal's rule <a href="Afghanistan%E2%80%93Pakistan%20relations">Afghan–Pakistani relations</a> remained hostile; the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan was the catalyst for the hostile relationship. The increasing numbers of <a href="Afghans%20in%20Pakistan">Afghan refugees in Pakistan</a> challenged the PDPA's legitimacy to rule.

The Soviet Union threatened in 1985 that it would support the <a href="Baloch%20nationalist">Baloch separatist movement</a> in Pakistan if the Pakistani government continued to aid the <a href="mujahideen">mujahideen</a> in Afghanistan. Karmal, problematically for the Soviets, did not want a Soviet withdrawal, and he hampered attempts to improve relations with Pakistan since the Pakistani government had refused to recognise the PDPA government.

<a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, then <a href="General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">General Secretary</a> of the <a href="Central%20Committee%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>, said, "The main reason that there has been no national consolidation so far is that Comrade Karmal is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help." Karmal's position became less secure when the Soviet leadership began blaming him for the failures in Afghanistan. Gorbachev, worried over the situation, told the Soviet Politburo "If we don't change approaches [to evacuate Afghanistan], we will be fighting there for another 20 or 30 years." It is not clear when the Soviet leadership began to campaign for Karmal's dismissal, but <a href="Andrei%20Gromyko">Andrei Gromyko</a> discussed the possibility of Karmal's resignation with <a href="Javier%20P%C3%A9rez%20de%20Cu%C3%A9llar">Javier Pérez de Cuéllar</a>, the <a href="Secretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">Secretary-General of the United Nations</a> in 1982. While it was Gorbachev who would dismiss Karmal, there may have been a consensus within the Soviet leadership in 1983 that Karmal should resign. Gorbachev's own plan was to replace Karmal with <a href="Mohammad%20Najibullah">Mohammad Najibullah</a>, who had joined the PDPA at its creation. Najibullah was thought highly of by <a href="Yuri%20Andropov">Yuri Andropov</a>, <a href="Boris%20Ponomarev">Boris Ponomarev</a> and <a href="Dmitriy%20Ustinov">Dmitriy Ustinov</a>, and negotiations for his succession may have started in 1983. Najibullah was not the Soviet leadership's only choice for Karmal's succession; a <a href="Glavnoye%20Razvedyvatel%27noye%20Upravleniye">GRU</a> report noted that the majority of the PDPA leadership would support <a href="Assadullah%20Sarwari">Assadullah Sarwari</a>'s ascension to leadership. According to the GRU, Sarwari was a better candidate as he could balance between the Pashtuns, Tajiks and Uzbeks; Najibullah was a Pashtun nationalist. Another viable candidate was Abdul Qadir, who had been a participant in the <a href="Saur%20Revolution">Saur Revolution</a>.

Najibullah was appointed to the <a href="Secretariat%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Afghanistan">PDPA Secretariat</a> in November 1985. During Karmal's March 1986 visit to the Soviet Union, the Soviets tried to persuade Karmal that he was too ill to govern, and that he should resign. This backfired, as a Soviet doctor attending to Karmal told him he was in good health. Karmal asked to return home to Kabul, and said that he understood and would listen to the Soviet recommendations. Before leaving, Karmal promised he would step down as PDPA General Secretary. The Soviets did not trust him and sent <a href="Vladimir%20Kryuchkov">Vladimir Kryuchkov</a>, the head of intelligence in the <a href="KGB">KGB</a>, into Afghanistan. At a meeting in Kabul, Karmal confessed his undying love for the Soviet Union, comparing his ardor to his Muslim faith. Kryuchkov, concluding that he could not persuade Karmal to resign, left the meeting. After Kryuchkov left the room, the Afghan defence minister and the state security minister visited Karmal's office, telling him that he had to resign from one of his posts. Understanding that his Soviet support had been eliminated, Karmal resigned from the office of the General Secretary at the 18th PDPA Central Committee plenum. He was succeeded in his post by Najibullah.

Karmal still had support within the party, and used his base to curb Najibullah's powers. He began spreading rumors that he would be reappointed General Secretary. Najibullah's power base was in the <a href="KHAD">KHAD</a>, the Afghan equivalent to the KGB, and not the party. Considering the fact that the Soviet Union had supported Karmal for over six years, the Soviet leadership wanted to ease him out of power gradually. <a href="Yuli%20Mikhailovich%20Vorontsov">Yuli Vorontsov</a>, the <a href="Soviet%20ambassador%20to%20Afghanistan">Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan</a>, told Najibullah to begin undermining Karmal's power slowly. Najibullah complained to the Soviet leadership that Karmal used most of his spare time looking for errors and "speaking against the <a href="National%20Reconciliation">National Reconciliation</a> [programme]". At a meeting of the Soviet Politburo on 13 November 1986 it was decided that Najibullah should remove Karmal; this motion was supported by Gromyko, Vorontsov, <a href="Eduard%20Shevardnadze">Eduard Shevardnadze</a>, <a href="Anatoly%20Dobrynin">Anatoly Dobrynin</a> and <a href="Viktor%20Chebrikov">Viktor Chebrikov</a>. A PDPA meeting in November relieved Karmal of his Revolutionary Council chairmanship, and exiled him to Moscow where he was given a state-owned apartment and a <a href="dacha">dacha</a>. Karmal was succeeded as Revolutionary Council chairman by <a href="Haji%20Mohammad%20Chamkani">Haji Mohammad Chamkani</a>, who was not a member of the PDPA.

For unknown reasons, Karmal was invited back to Kabul by Najibullah, and "for equally obscure reasons Karmal accepted." If Najibullah's plan was to strengthen his position within the <a href="Watan%20Party%20of%20Afghanistan">Watan Party of Afghanistan</a> (the renamed PDPA) by appeasing the pro-Karmal Parchamites, he failed. Karmal's apartment became a center for opposition to Najibullah's government. When Najibullah was toppled in 1992, Karmal became the most powerful politician in Kabul through leadership of the Parcham. However, his negotiations with the rebels collapsed quickly, and on 16 April 1992 the rebels, led by <a href="Gulbuddin%20Hekmatyar">Gulbuddin Hekmatyar</a>, took Kabul. After the fall of Najibullah's government, Karmal was based in <a href="Hairatan">Hairatan</a>. There, it is alleged, Karmal used most of his time either trying to establish a new party, or advising people to join the <a href="National%20Islamic%20Movement%20of%20Afghanistan">National Islamic Movement</a> (NIM). <a href="Abdul%20Rashid%20Dostum">Abdul Rashid Dostum</a>, the leader of NIM, was a supporter of Karmal during his rule. It is unknown how much control Karmal had over Dostum, but there is little evidence that Karmal was in any commanding position. Karmal's influence over Dostum appeared indirect – some of his former associates supported Dostum. Those who spoke with Karmal during this period noted his lack of interest in politics. In June 1992 it was reported that he had died in a plane crash along with Dostum, although these reports later proved to be false. In early December 1996, Karmal died in Moscow's <a href="Central%20Clinical%20Hospital">Central Clinical Hospital</a> from <a href="Hepatocellular%20carcinoma">liver cancer</a>. The date of his death was reported by some sources as 1 December and by others as 3 December. The <a href="Taliban">Taliban</a> summed up his rule as follows:

Buddhist philosophy

Buddhist philosophy refers to the philosophical investigations and systems of inquiry that developed among various <a href="Buddhist%20schools">Buddhist schools</a> in India following the death of the <a href="Buddha">Buddha</a> and later spread throughout Asia. <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>'s main concern has always been freedom from <a href="dukkha">dukkha</a> (unease), and the path to that ultimate freedom consists in ethical action (<a href="karma">karma</a>), <a href="Buddhist%20meditation">meditation</a> and in direct insight (<a href="praj%C3%B1a">prajña</a>) into the nature of "things as they truly are" (yathābhūtaṃ viditvā). Indian Buddhists sought this understanding not just from the revealed teachings of the Buddha, but through philosophical analysis and rational deliberation. Buddhist thinkers in India and subsequently in <a href="East%20Asia">East Asia</a> have covered topics as varied as <a href="Phenomenology%20%28philosophy%29">phenomenology</a>, <a href="ethics">ethics</a>, <a href="ontology">ontology</a>, <a href="epistemology">epistemology</a>, <a href="logic">logic</a> and <a href="philosophy%20of%20time">philosophy of time</a> in their analysis of this path.

Early Buddhism was based on <a href="empirical%20evidence">empirical evidence</a> gained by the sense organs ("<a href="ayatana">ayatana</a>") and the Buddha seems to have retained a skeptical distance from <a href="The%20unanswered%20questions">certain metaphysical questions</a>, refusing to answer them because they were not conducive to liberation but led instead to further speculation. A recurrent theme in Buddhist philosophy has been the reification of concepts, and the subsequent return to the Buddhist <a href="Middle%20Way">Middle Way</a>.

Particular points of Buddhist philosophy have often been the subject of disputes between different <a href="schools%20of%20Buddhism">schools of Buddhism</a>. These elaborations and disputes gave rise to <a href="Early%20Buddhist%20schools">various schools in early Buddhism</a> of <a href="Abhidharma">Abhidharma</a>, and to the <a href="Mahayana">Mahayana</a> traditions and schools of the <a href="prajnaparamita">prajnaparamita</a>, <a href="Madhyamaka">Madhyamaka</a>, <a href="Buddha-nature">Buddha-nature</a> and <a href="Yogacara">Yogacara</a>.

Philosophy in India was aimed mainly at <a href="moksha">spiritual liberation</a> and had <a href="soteriology">soteriological</a> goals. In his study of <a href="M%C4%81dhyamaka">Mādhyamaka</a> Buddhist philosophy in India, Peter Deller Santina writes:

The goal of Buddhist philosophy is <a href="nirvana">nirvana</a> and to achieve this it needs to investigate the nature of the world. For the Indian Buddhist philosophers, the teachings of the Buddha were not meant to be taken on faith alone, but to be confirmed by logical analysis ("pramana") of the world. The early Buddhist texts mention that a person becomes a follower of the Buddha's teachings after having pondered them over with wisdom and the gradual training also requires that a disciple “investigate” ("upaparikkhati") and “scrutinize” ("tuleti") the teachings. The Buddha also expected his disciples to approach him as a teacher in a critical fashion and scrutinize his actions and words, as shown in the <a href="V%C4%ABma%E1%B9%83saka%20Sutta">Vīmaṃsaka Sutta</a>.

The <a href="Buddha">Buddha</a> (circa 5th century BC) was a north Indian <a href="sramana">sramana</a> from <a href="Magadha">Magadha</a>. He cultivated various yogic techniques and ascetic practices and taught throughout north India, where his teachings took hold. These teachings are preserved in the Pali <a href="Nikayas">Nikayas</a> and in the <a href="%C4%80gama%20%28Buddhism%29">Agamas</a> as well as in other surviving fragmentary textual collections. Dating these texts is difficult and there is disagreement on how much of this material goes back to a single religious founder. While the focus of the Buddha's teachings are about attaining the highest good of nirvana, they also contain an analysis of the source of human suffering, the nature of <a href="personal%20identity">personal identity</a>, and the process of acquiring knowledge about the world.

The Buddha defined his teaching as "the middle way". In the <a href="Dhammacakkappavattana%20Sutta">Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta</a>, this is used to refer to the fact that his teachings steer a middle course between the extremes of <a href="asceticism">asceticism</a> and bodily denial (as practiced by the <a href="Jains">Jains</a> and other <a href="sramana">sramana</a>s) and sensual <a href="hedonism">hedonism</a> or indulgence. Many sramanas of the Buddha's time placed much emphasis on a denial of the body, using practices such as fasting, to liberate the mind from the body. The Buddha however, realized that the mind was embodied and causally dependent on the body, and therefore that a malnourished body did not allow the mind to be trained and developed.

Certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout these early texts, so older studies by various scholars conclude that the Buddha must at least have taught some of these key teachings:

Critical studies by Schmithausen, Vetter, Bronkhorst, Gombrich and others have adjusted this list of basic teachings, and revealed a more nuanced genesis of the Buddhist teachings. According to Vetter, the description of the Buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term "the middle way". In time, this short description was elaborated, resulting in the description of the eightfold path. Vetter argues that the eightfold path constitutes a body of practices which prepare one, and lead up to, the practice of "dhyana". According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, "<a href="Dhy%C4%81na%20in%20Buddhism">dhyāna</a>" constituted the original "liberating practice", while discriminating insight into transiency as a separate path to liberation was a later development.

According to Bronkhorst, the four truths may not have been formulated in earliest Buddhism, and did not serve in earliest Buddhism as a description of "liberating insight". Lambert Schmithausen concluded that the four truths were a later development in early Buddhism. Carol Anderson, following Lambert Schmithausen and K.R. Norman, notes that the four truths are missing in critical passages in the canon, and states:
According to both Bronkhorst and Anderson, the four truths became a substitution for prajna, or "liberating insight", in the suttas in those texts where "liberating insight" was preceded by the four jhanas.

According to some scholars, the philosophical outlook of earliest Buddhism was primarily negative, in the sense that it focused on what doctrines to "reject" more than on what doctrines to "accept". Only knowledge that is useful in achieving <a href="enlightenment%20%28Buddhism%29">enlightenment</a> is valued. According to this theory, the cycle of philosophical upheavals that in part drove the diversification of Buddhism into its many schools and sects only began once Buddhists began attempting to make explicit the implicit philosophy of the Buddha and the early texts.

The four noble truths or "truths of the noble one" are a central feature of the teachings and are put forth in the <a href="Dhammacakkappavattana%20Sutta">Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta</a>. The first truth of <a href="Dukkha">Dukkha</a>, often translated as "suffering", is the inherent unsatisfactoriness of life. This unpleasantness is said to be not just physical pain, but also a kind of existential unease caused by the inevitable facts of our mortality and ultimately by the impermanence of all phenomena. It also arises because of contact with unpleasant events, and due to not getting what one desires. The second truth is that this unease arises out of conditions, mainly 'craving' (<a href="tanha">tanha</a>) and ignorance (<a href="Avidy%C4%81%20%28Buddhism%29">avidya</a>). The third truth is then the fact that if you let go of craving and remove ignorance through knowledge, dukkha ceases (<a href="nirodha">nirodha</a>). The fourth is the <a href="Eightfold%20Path">eightfold path</a> which are eight practices that end suffering, they are: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right <a href="mindfulness">mindfulness</a> and right <a href="samadhi">samadhi</a> (mental unification, meditation). The goal taught by the Buddha, <a href="nirvana">nirvana</a>, literally means 'extinguishing' and signified "the complete extinguishing of greed, hatred, and delusion (i.e. ignorance), the forces which power <a href="samsara">samsara</a>". Nirvana also means that after an enlightened being's death, there is no further rebirth.

The working of the rising and ceasing of suffering is explained by <a href="Pratitya-samutpada">dependent origination</a>, the dynamic arising of events based on causal conditioning. The Buddha understood the world in procedural terms, not in terms of things or substances. His theory posits a flux of events arising under certain conditions which are interconnected and dependent, such that the processes in question at no time, are considered to be static or independent. Craving, for example, is always dependent on, and caused by sensations. Sensations are always dependent on contact with our surroundings. Buddha's causal theory is simply descriptive: ‘This existing, that exists; this arising, that arises; this not existing, that does not exist; this ceasing, that ceases.’ This understanding of causation as 'impersonal lawlike causal ordering' is important because it shows how the processes that give rise to suffering work, and also how they can be reversed.

The removal of suffering then, requires a deep understanding of the nature of reality (<a href="praj%C3%B1a">prajña</a>). While philosophical analysis of arguments and concepts is clearly necessary to develop this understanding, it is not enough to remove our unskillful mental habits and deeply ingrained prejudices, which require <a href="meditation">meditation</a>, paired with understanding. According to the Buddha, we need to train the mind in meditation to be able to truly see the nature of reality, which is said to have the marks of suffering, impermanence and not-self. Understanding and meditation are said to work together to 'clearly see' (<a href="vipassana">vipassana</a>) the nature of human experience and this is said to lead to liberation.

The Buddha argued that <a href="anatta">there is no permanent self</a>, no 'essence of a person' or 'what makes me, me'. This means there is no part of a person which is unchanging and essential for continuity, it means that there is no individual "part of the person that accounts for the identity of that person over time". This is in opposition to the <a href="Upanishads">Upanishadic</a> concept of an unchanging <a href="Atman%20%28Hinduism%29">ultimate self</a> and any view of an eternal <a href="soul">soul</a>. The Buddha held that attachment to the appearance of a permanent self in this world of change is the cause of suffering, and the main obstacle to <a href="Moksha">liberation</a>.

The most widely used argument that the Buddha employed against the idea of an unchanging ego is an empiricist one, based on the observation of the five aggregates that make up a person and the fact that these are always changing. This argument can be put in this way:


This argument requires the implied premise that the five aggregates are an exhaustive account of what makes up a person, or else the self could exist outside of these aggregates.

This argument is famously expounded in the <a href="Anattalakkhana%20Sutta">Anattalakkhana Sutta</a>. According to this argument, the apparently fixed self is merely the result of identification with the <a href="skandhas">temporary aggregates</a>, the changing processes making up an individual human being. In this view a 'person' is only a convenient nominal designation on a certain grouping of processes and characteristics, an 'individual' is a conceptual construction overlaid upon a stream of experiences just like a <a href="chariot">chariot</a> is merely a conventional designation for the parts of a chariot and how they are put together. The foundation of this argument is <a href="empiricist">empiricist</a>, for it is based on the fact that all we observe is subject to change, especially everything observed when looking inwardly in meditation.

Another argument for 'non-self', the 'argument from lack of control' and it is based on the fact that we often seek to change certain parts of ourselves, that the 'executive function' of the mind is that which finds certain things unsatisfactory and attempts to alter them. Furthermore, it is also based on the Indian 'Anti Reflexivity Principle' which states an entity cannot operate on or control itself (a knife can cut other things but not itself, a finger can point at other things but not at itself, etc.). This means then, that the self could never desire to change itself and could not do so, the Buddha uses this idea to attack the concept of self. This argument could be structured thus:


This argument then denies that there is one permanent "controller" in the person. Instead it views the person as a set of constantly changing processes which include volitional events seeking change and an awareness of that desire for change. According to Mark Siderits:

"What the Buddhist has in mind is that on one occasion one part of the person might perform the executive function, on another occasion another part might do so. This would make it possible for every part to be subject to control without there being any part that always fills the role of controller (and so is the self). On some occasions a given part might fall on the controller side, while on other occasions it might fall on the side of the controlled. This would explain how it's possible for us to seek to change any of the skandhas while there is nothing more to us than just those skandhas."

As noted by <a href="K.R.%20Norman">K.R. Norman</a> and <a href="Richard%20Gombrich">Richard Gombrich</a>, the Buddha extended his <a href="anatta">anatta</a> critique to the Brahmanical belief expounded in the <a href="Brihadaranyaka%20Upanishad">Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</a> that the Self (Atman) was indeed the whole world, or <a href="Brahman">Brahman</a>. This is shown by the Alagaddūpama-sutta, where the Buddha argues that an individual cannot experience the suffering of the entire world. He used the example of someone carrying off and burning grass and sticks from the Jeta grove and how a monk would not sense or consider themselves harmed by that action. In this example the Buddha is arguing that we do not have direct experience of the entire world, and hence the Self cannot be the whole world. In this sutta (as well as in the Soattā Sutta) the Buddha outlines six wrong views about Self:

"There are six wrong views: An unwise, untrained person may think of the body, ‘This is mine, this is me, this is my self’; he may think that of feelings; of perceptions; of volitions; or of what has been seen, heard, thought, cognized, reached, sought or considered by the mind. The sixth is to identify the world and self, to believe: ‘At death I shall become permanent, eternal, unchanging, and so remain forever the same; and that is mine, that is me, that is my self.’ A wise and well-trained person sees that all these positions are wrong, and so he is not worried about something that does not exist."

Furthermore, the Buddha argues that the world can be observed to be a cause of suffering (Brahman was held to be ultimately blissful) and that since we cannot control the world as we wish, the world cannot be the Self. The idea that "this cosmos is the self" is one of the <a href="View%20%28Buddhism%29">views</a> rejected by the Buddha along with the related <a href="Monism">Monistic</a> theory that held that "everything is a Oneness" (SN 12.48 Lokayatika Sutta). The Buddha also held that understanding and seeing the truth of not-self led to un-attachment, and hence to the cessation of suffering, while ignorance about the true nature of personality led to further suffering.

All schools of <a href="Indian%20philosophy">Indian philosophy</a> recognize various sets of valid justifications for knowledge, or "<a href="pramana">pramāṇa</a>" and many see the <a href="Vedas">Vedas</a> as providing access to truth. The Buddha denied the authority of the Vedas, though like his contemporaries, he affirmed the soteriological importance of having a proper understanding of reality ('right view'). However, this understanding was not conceived primarily as metaphysical and cosmological knowledge, but as a knowledge into the arising and cessation of suffering in human experience. Therefore, the Buddha's epistemic project is different than that of modern philosophy, it is primarily a solution to the fundamental human spiritual/existential problem.

The Buddha's epistemology has been compared to <a href="empiricism">empiricism</a>, in the sense that it was based on experience of the world through the senses. The Buddha taught that empirical observation through the six sense fields (<a href="ayatanas">ayatanas</a>) was the proper way of verifying any knowledge claims. Some suttas go further, stating that "the All", or everything that exists ("sabbam"), are these six sense spheres (SN 35.23, Sabba Sutta) and that anyone who attempts to describe another "All" will be unable to do so because "it lies beyond range". This sutta seems to indicate that for the Buddha, things in themselves or <a href="noumena">noumena</a>, are beyond our epistemological reach ("avisaya").

Furthermore, in the <a href="Kalama%20sutta">Kalama sutta</a> the Buddha tells a group of confused villagers that the only proper reason for one's beliefs is verification in one’s own personal experience (and the experience of the wise) and denies any verification which stems from personal authority, sacred tradition ("anussava") or any kind of <a href="rationalism">rationalism</a> which constructs metaphysical theories ("takka"). In the Tevijja Sutta (DN 13), the Buddha rejects the personal authority of Brahmins because none of them can prove they have had personal experience of <a href="Brahman">Brahman</a>. The Buddha also stressed that experience is the only criterion for verification of the truth in this passage from the <a href="Majjhima%20Nikaya">Majjhima Nikaya</a> (MN.I.265):

Furthermore, the Buddha's standard for personal verification was a pragmatic and salvific one, for the Buddha a belief counts as truth only if it leads to successful Buddhist practice (and hence, to the destruction of craving). In the "Discourse to Prince Abhaya" (MN.I.392–4) the Buddha states this pragmatic maxim by saying that a belief should only be accepted if it leads to wholesome consequences. This tendency of the Buddha to see what is true as what was useful or 'what works' has been called by scholars such as <a href="Caroline%20Augusta%20Foley%20Rhys%20Davids">Mrs Rhys Davids</a> and <a href="Charles%20Jean%20de%20la%20Vall%C3%A9e-Poussin">Vallée-Poussin</a> a form of <a href="Pragmatism">Pragmatism</a>. However, <a href="K.%20N.%20Jayatilleke">K. N. Jayatilleke</a> argues the Buddha's epistemology can also be taken to be a form of <a href="correspondence%20theory">correspondence theory</a> (as per the 'Apannaka Sutta') with elements of <a href="Coherentism">Coherentism</a> and that for the Buddha, it is causally impossible for something which is false to lead to suffering and evil.

The Buddha discouraged his followers from indulging in intellectual disputation for its own sake, which is fruitless, and distracts one from the goal of awakening. Only philosophy and discussion which has pragmatic value for liberation from suffering is seen as important. According to the <a href="Pali%20Canon">scriptures</a>, during his lifetime the Buddha remained silent when asked several <a href="Metaphysics">metaphysical</a> <a href="The%20unanswered%20questions">questions</a> which he regarded as the basis for "unwise reflection". These 'unanswered questions' (avyākata) regarded issues such as whether the universe is eternal or non-eternal (or whether it is finite or infinite), the unity or separation of the body and the <a href="Atman%20%28Buddhism%29">self</a>, the complete inexistence of a person after <a href="Nirvana%20%28Buddhism%29">Nirvana</a> and death, and others. The Buddha stated that thinking about these imponderable (<a href="Acinteyya">Acinteyya</a>) issues led to "a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views" (Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta).

One explanation for this pragmatic suspension of judgment or epistemic <a href="Epoch%C3%A9">Epoché</a> is that such questions distract from activity that is practical to realizing <a href="bodhi">enlightenment</a> and bring about the danger of substituting the experience of liberation by conceptual understanding of the doctrine or by religious faith. According to the Buddha, the Dharma is not an ultimate end in itself or an explanation of all metaphysical reality, but a pragmatic set of teachings. The Buddha used two parables to clarify this point, the 'Parable of the raft' and the <a href="Parable%20of%20the%20Poisoned%20Arrow">Parable of the Poisoned Arrow</a>. The Dharma is a like a raft in the sense that it is only a pragmatic tool for attaining nirvana ("for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto", MN 22) once one has done this, one can discard the raft. It is also like medicine, in that, the particulars of how one was <a href="Parable%20of%20the%20Poisoned%20Arrow">injured by a poisoned arrow</a> (i.e. metaphysics, etc.) do not matter in the act of removing and curing the arrow wound itself (removing suffering). In this sense the Buddha was often called 'the great physician' because his goal was to cure the human condition of suffering first and foremost, not to speculate about metaphysics.

Having said this, it is still clear that resisting (even, refuting) a false or slanted doctrine can be useful to extricate the interlocutor, or oneself, from error; hence, to advance in the way of liberation. Witness the Buddha's confutation of several doctrines by Nigantha Nataputta and other purported sages which sometimes had large followings (e.g., Kula Sutta, Sankha Sutta, Brahmana Sutta). This shows that a virtuous and appropriate use of dialectics can take place. By implication, reasoning and argument shouldn't be disparaged by buddhists. 

After the Buddha's death, some Buddhists such as <a href="Dharmakirti">Dharmakirti</a> went on to use the sayings of the Buddha as sound evidence equal to perception and inference. 

Another possible reason why the Buddha refused to engage in <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a> is that he saw ultimate reality and nirvana as devoid of sensory mediation and conception and therefore language itself is "<a href="A%20priori%20and%20a%20posteriori">a priori</a>" inadequate to explain it. Thus, the Buddha's silence does not indicate <a href="misology">misology</a> or disdain for philosophy. Rather, it indicates that he viewed the answers to these questions as not understandable by the unenlightened. Dependent arising provides a framework for analysis of reality that is not based on metaphysical assumptions regarding existence or non-existence, but instead on imagining direct cognition of phenomena as they are presented to the mind in yogic meditation.

The Buddha of the earliest Buddhists texts describes Dharma (in the sense of "truth") as "beyond reasoning" or "transcending logic", in the sense that reasoning is a subjectively introduced aspect of the way unenlightened humans perceive things, and the conceptual framework which underpins their cognitive process, rather than a feature of things as they really are. Going "beyond reasoning" means in this context penetrating the nature of reasoning from the inside, and removing the causes for experiencing any future stress as a result of it, rather than functioning outside of the system as a whole.

The Buddha's ethics are based on the <a href="soteriological">soteriological</a> need to eliminate suffering and on the premise of the law of <a href="karma">karma</a>. Buddhist ethics have been termed eudaimonic (with their goal being well-being) and also compared to <a href="virtue%20ethics">virtue ethics</a> (this approach began with Damien Keown). Keown writes that Buddhist <a href="Nirvana">Nirvana</a> is analogous to the Aristotelian <a href="Eudaimonia">Eudaimonia</a>, and that Buddhist moral acts and virtues derive their value from how they lead us to or act as an aspect of the nirvanic life.

The Buddha outlined <a href="five%20precepts">five precepts</a> (no killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, or drinking alcohol) which were to be followed by his disciples, lay and monastic. There are various reasons the Buddha gave as to why someone should be ethical.

First, the universe is structured in such a way that if someone intentionally commits a misdeed, a bad karmic fruit will be the result (and vice versa). Hence, from a pragmatic point of view, it is best to abstain from these negative actions which bring forth negative results. However the important word here is "intentionally", for the Buddha, karma is nothing else but intention/volition, and hence unintentionally harming someone does not create bad karmic results. Unlike the <a href="Jains">Jains</a> who believed that karma was a quasi-physical element, for the Buddha karma was a volitional mental event, what Richard Gombrich calls ‘an ethicised consciousness’.

This idea leads into the second moral justification of the Buddha; intentionally performing negative actions reinforces and propagates mental defilements which keep persons bound to the cycle of rebirth and interfere with the process of liberation, and hence intentionally performing good karmic actions is participating in mental purification which leads to nirvana, the highest happiness. This perspective sees immoral acts as unskillful ("akusala") in our quest for happiness, and hence it is pragmatic to do good.

The third meta-ethical consideration takes the view of not-self and our natural desire to end our suffering to its logical conclusion. Since there is no self, there is no reason to prefer our own welfare over that of others because there is no ultimate grounding for the differentiation of "my" suffering and someone else's. Instead an enlightened person would just work to end suffering "tout court", without thinking of the conventional concept of persons. According to this argument, anyone who is selfish does so out of ignorance of the true nature of personal identity and irrationality.

The main Indian Buddhist philosophical schools practiced a form of analysis termed "<a href="Abhidharma">Abhidharma</a>" which sought to systematize the teachings of the early Buddhist discourses (sutras). Abhidharma analysis broke down human experience into momentary phenomenal events or occurrences called ""<a href="Abhidharma%23The%20dharma%20theory">dharmas</a>"". Dharmas are impermanent and dependent on other causal factors, they arise and pass as part of a web of other interconnected dharmas, and are never found alone. The Abhidharmic schools held that the teachings of the Buddha in the sutras were merely conventional, while the Abhidharma analysis was ultimate truth (paramattha sacca), the way things really are when seen by an enlightened being. The Abhidharmic project has been likened as a form of <a href="Phenomenology%20%28philosophy%29">phenomenology</a> or <a href="process%20philosophy">process philosophy</a>. Abhidharma philosophers not only outlined what they believed to be an exhaustive listing of "dharmas", or phenomenal events, but also the causal relations between them. In the Abhidharmic analysis, the only thing which is ultimately real is the interplay of dharmas in a causal stream, everything else is merely conceptual ("paññatti") and nominal.

This view has been termed "<a href="Mereology">mereological</a> reductionism" by Mark Siderits because it holds that only impartite entities are real, not wholes. Abhidharmikas such as Vasubandhu argued that conventional things (tables, persons, etc.), "disappear under analysis" and that this analysis reveals only a causal stream of phenomenal events and their relations. The mainstream Abhidharmikas defended this view against their main Hindu rivals, the <a href="Nyaya">Nyaya</a> school, who were substance theorists and posited the existence of <a href="Universal%20%28metaphysics%29">universals</a>. Some Abhidharmikas such as the <a href="Praj%C3%B1aptiv%C4%81da">Prajñaptivāda</a> were also strict <a href="nominalists">nominalists</a>, and held that all things - even dharmas - were merely conceptual.

An important Abhidhamma work from the <a href="Therav%C4%81da">Theravāda</a> school is the <a href="Kath%C4%81vatthu">Kathāvatthu</a> ("Points of controversy"), by the scholar-monk <a href="Moggaliputta-Tissa">Moggaliputta-Tissa</a> (ca.327–247 BCE). This text is important because it attempts to refute several philosophical views which had developed after the death of the Buddha, especially the theory that 'all exists' (sarvāstivāda), the theory of momentariness (khāṇavāda) and the personalist view (<a href="pudgalavada">pudgalavada</a>) These were the major philosophical theories which divided the Buddhist Abhidharma schools in India. After being brought to <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> in the first century BCE, the Theravada Pali language Abhidhamma tradition was heavily influenced by the works of <a href="Buddhaghosa">Buddhaghosa</a> (4-5th century AD), the most important philosopher and commentator of the <a href="Theravada">Theravada</a> school. The Theravada philosophical enterprise was mostly carried out in the genre of <a href="Atthakatha">Atthakatha</a>, commentaries (as well as <a href="Subcommentaries%2C%20Theravada">sub-commentaries</a>) on the Pali Abhidhamma, but also included short summaries and compendiums. 

The <a href="Sarv%C4%81stiv%C4%81da">Sarvāstivāda</a> was one of the major Buddhist philosophical schools in India, and they were so named because of their belief that dharmas exist in all three times: past, present and future. Though the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma system began as a mere categorization of mental events, their philosophers and exegetes such as Dharmatrata and Katyāyāniputra (the compiler of the <a href="Mahavibhasa">Mahavibhasa</a>, a central text of the school) eventually refined this system into a robust <a href="Philosophical%20realism">realism</a>, which also included a type of <a href="essentialism">essentialism</a>. This realism was based on a quality of dharmas, which was called <a href="svabhava">svabhava</a> or 'intrinsic existence'. Svabhava is a sort of <a href="essence">essence</a>, though it is not a completely independent essence, since all dharmas were said to be causally dependent. The Sarvāstivāda system extended this realism across time, effectively positing a type of <a href="Eternalism%20%28philosophy%20of%20time%29">eternalism</a> with regards to time, hence the name of their school means "the view that everything exists". 

Other Buddhist schools such as the Prajñaptivadins ('nominalists'), the Purvasailas and the Vainasikas refused to accept the concept of <a href="svabhava">svabhava</a>. The main topic of the <a href="Tattvasiddhi">Tattvasiddhi</a> Śāstra by Harivarman (3-4th century AD), an influential Abhidharma text, is the emptiness (<a href="shunyata">shunyata</a>) of dharmas.

The Theravādins and other schools such as the <a href="Sautrantika">Sautrāntikas</a> attacked the realism of the Sarvāstivādins, especially their theory of time. A major figure in this argument was the scholar <a href="Vasubandhu">Vasubandhu</a>, an ex-Sarvāstivādin, who critiqued the theory of all exists and argued for <a href="philosophical%20presentism">philosophical presentism</a> in his comprehensive treatise, the <a href="Abhidharmakosa">Abhidharmakosa</a>. This work is the major Abhidharma text used in Tibetan and East Asian Buddhism today. The Theravāda also holds that dharmas only exist in the present, and are thus also <a href="Philosophical%20presentism">presentists</a>. The Theravādin presentation of Abhidharma is also not as concerned with ontology as the Sarvāstivādin view, but is more of a phenomenology and hence the concept of svabhava for the Theravādins is more of a certain characteristic or dependent feature of a dharma, than any sort of essence or metaphysical grounding. According to <a href="Y%20Karunadasa">Y Karunadasa</a>:

In the Pali tradition it is only for the sake of definition and description that each dhamma is postulated as if it were a separate entity; but in reality it is by no means a solitary phenomenon having an existence of its own...If this Abhidhammic view of existence, as seen from its doctrine of dhammas, cannot be interpreted as a radical pluralism, neither can it be interpreted as an out-and-out monism. For what are called dhammas -- the component factors of the universe, both within us and outside us -- are not fractions of an absolute unity but a multiplicity of co-ordinate factors. They are not reducible to, nor do they emerge from, a single reality, the fundamental postulate of monistic metaphysics. If they are to be interpreted as phenomena, this should be done with the proviso that they are phenomena with no corresponding <a href="noumena">noumena</a>, no hidden underlying ground. For they are not manifestations of some mysterious metaphysical substratum, but processes taking place due to the interplay of a multitude of conditions.

An important theory held by some Sarvāstivādins, Theravādins and Sautrāntikas was the theory of "momentariness" (Skt., kṣāṇavāda, Pali, khāṇavāda). This theory held that dhammas only last for a minute moment ("ksana") after they arise. The Sarvāstivādins saw these 'moments' in an atomistic way, as the smallest length of time possible (they also developed a material atomism). Reconciling this theory with their eternalism regarding time was a major philosophical project of the <a href="Sarv%C4%81stiv%C4%81da">Sarvāstivāda</a>. The Theravādins initially rejected this theory, as evidenced by the Khaṇikakathā of the <a href="Kathavatthu">Kathavatthu</a> which attempts to refute the doctrine that "all phenomena (dhamma) are
as momentary as a single mental entity." However momentariness was later adopted by the Sri Lankan Theravādins, and it is possible that it was first introduced by the scholar <a href="Buddhagosa">Buddhagosa</a>.

All Abhidharma schools also developed complex theories of causation and conditionality to explain how dharmas interacted with each other. Another major philosophical project of the Abhidharma schools was the explanation of <a href="perception">perception</a>. Some schools such as the Sarvastivadins explained perception as a type of phenomenalist realism while others such as the Sautrantikas preferred <a href="representationalism">representationalism</a> and held that we only perceive objects indirectly. The major argument used for this view by the Sautrāntikas was the "time lag argument." According to Mark Siderits: "The basic idea behind the argument is that since there is always a tiny gap between when the sense comes in contact with the external object and when there is sensory awareness, what we are aware of can't be the external object that the senses were in contact with, since it no longer exists." This is related to the theory of extreme momentariness.

One major philosophical view which was rejected by all the schools mentioned above was the view held by the <a href="Pudgalavadin">Pudgalavadin</a> or 'personalist' schools. They seemed to have held that there was a sort of 'personhood' in some ultimately real sense which was not reducible to the five aggregates. This controversial claim was in contrast to the other Buddhists of the time who held that a personality was a mere conceptual construction (prajñapti) and only conventionally real.

From about the 1st century BCE, a new textual tradition began to arise in Indian Buddhist thought called <a href="Mah%C4%81y%C4%81na">Mahāyāna</a> (Great Vehicle), which would slowly come to dominate Indian Buddhist philosophy. Buddhist philosophy thrived in large monastery-university complexes such as <a href="Nalanda">Nalanda</a> and <a href="Vikramasila">Vikramasila</a>, which became centres of learning in North India. Mahāyāna philosophers continued the philosophical projects of Abhidharma while at the same time critiquing them and introducing new concepts and ideas. Since the Mahāyāna held to the <a href="Pragmatism">pragmatic concept of truth</a> which states that doctrines are regarded as conditionally "true" in the sense of being spiritually beneficial, the new theories and practices were seen as 'skillful means' (<a href="Upaya">Upaya</a>). The Mahayana also promoted the <a href="Bodhisattva">Bodhisattva</a> ideal, which included an attitude of compassion for all sentient beings. The Bodhisattva is someone who chooses to remain in <a href="samsara">samsara</a> (the cycle of birth and death) to benefit all other beings who are suffering.

Major Mahayana philosophical schools and traditions include the <a href="Prajnaparamita">Prajnaparamita</a>, <a href="Madhyamaka">Madhyamaka</a>, <a href="Tathagatagarbha">Tathagatagarbha</a>, the Epistemological school of Dignaga, <a href="Yogacara">Yogācāra</a>, <a href="Huayan%20school">Huayan</a>, <a href="Tiantai">Tiantai</a> and the Chan/<a href="Zen">Zen</a> schools.

The earliest <a href="Prajnaparamita">Prajñāpāramitā-sutras</a> (1st century BC) emphasize the emptiness (<a href="Shunyata">Shunyata</a>) of phenomena or dhammas. The 'perfection of insight' (Prajñāpāramitā) is said to be true knowledge of the nature of ultimate reality, which is illusory and empty of essence. The "<a href="Diamond%20Sutra">Diamond Sutra</a>" states that: 
The "<a href="Heart%20Sutra">Heart Sutra</a>" famously affirms the emptiness or voidness (<a href="shunyata">shunyata</a>) of phenomena:
The Prajñāpāramitā teachings are associated with the work of the Buddhist philosopher <a href="Nagarjuna">Nāgārjuna</a> (c. AD 150 – c. 250) and the <a href="Madhyamaka">Madhyamaka</a> (Middle way) school. Nāgārjuna was one of the most influential Indian Buddhist thinkers; he gave the classical arguments for the empty nature of <a href="phenomena">phenomena</a> and attacked the Sarvāstivāda and Pudgalavada schools' essentialism in his magnum opus, "<a href="Mulamadhyamakakarika">The Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way</a>" ("Mūlamadhyamakakārikā"). In the "Mūlamadhyamakakārikā", Nagarjuna relies on <a href="reductio%20ad%20absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a> arguments to refute various theories which assume an inherent <a href="essence">essence</a> or "own being" (<a href="svabhava">svabhava</a>). In this work, he covers topics such as causation, motion, and the sense faculties.

<a href="Nagarjuna">Nagarjuna</a> asserted a direct connection between, even identity of, <a href="dependent%20origination">dependent origination</a>, selflessness ("<a href="anatta">anatta</a>"), and emptiness ("<a href="%C5%9B%C5%ABnyat%C4%81">śūnyatā</a>"). He pointed out that implicit in the early Buddhist concept of dependent origination is the lack of any substantial being ("anatta") underlying the participants in origination, so that they have no independent existence, a state identified as emptiness ("śūnyatā"), or emptiness of a nature or essence ("<a href="svabh%C4%81va">svabhāva</a> sunyam").

Later philosophers of the Madhyamaka school built upon Nagarjuna's analysis and defended Madhyamaka against their opponents. These included <a href="%C4%80ryadeva">Āryadeva</a> (3rd century CE), Nāgārjuna's pupil; <a href="Candrak%C4%ABrti">Candrakīrti</a> (600–c. 650), who wrote an important commentary on the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā; and <a href="Shantideva">Shantideva</a> (8th century). <a href="Buddhap%C4%81lita">Buddhapālita</a> (470–550) has been understood as the originator of the 'prāsaṅgika' approach which is based on critiquing essentialism only through "reductio ad absurdum" arguments. He was criticized by <a href="Bh%C4%81vaviveka">Bhāvaviveka</a> (c. 500 – c. 578), who argued for the use of syllogisms "to set one's own doctrinal stance". These two approaches were later termed the Prāsaṅgika and the Svātantrika approaches to Madhyamaka by Tibetan philosophers and commentators.

Influenced by the work of <a href="Dignaga">Dignaga</a>, <a href="Bh%C4%81vaviveka">Bhāvaviveka</a>'s Madhyamika philosophy makes use of Buddhist epistemology. <a href="Candrak%C4%ABrti">Candrakīrti</a> on the other hand, critiqued Bhāvaviveka's adoption of the epistemological ("<a href="pramana">pramana</a>") tradition on the grounds that it contained a subtle essentialism. He quotes Nagarjuna's famous statement in the "Vigrahavyavartani" which says "I have no thesis" for his rejection of positive epistemic Madhyamaka statements. <a href="Candrak%C4%ABrti">Candrakīrti</a> held that a true Madhyamika could only use "consequence" ("<a href="Prasa%E1%B9%85gika">prasanga</a>") in which one points out the inconsistencies of their opponents position without asserting an "autonomous inference" ("<a href="Svatantrika">svatantra</a>"), for no such inference can be ultimately true from the point of view of Madhyamaka.

In China, the Madhyamaka school (known as <a href="East%20Asian%20M%C4%81dhyamaka">Sānlùn</a>) was founded by <a href="Kum%C4%81raj%C4%ABva">Kumārajīva</a> (344–413 CE) who translated the works of Nagarjuna to Chinese. Other Chinese Madhymakas include <a href="Kum%C4%81raj%C4%ABva">Kumārajīva</a> 's pupil <a href="Sengzhao">Sengzhao</a>, <a href="Jizang">Jizang</a> (549–623), who wrote over 50 works on Madhyamaka and <a href="Hyegwan">Hyegwan</a>, a Korean monk who brought Madhyamaka teachings to Japan.

The <a href="Yog%C4%81c%C4%81ra">Yogācāra school</a> ("Yoga practice") was a Buddhist philosophical tradition which arose in between the 2nd century CE and the 4th century CE and is associated with the philosophers <a href="Asanga">Asanga</a> and <a href="Vasubandhu">Vasubandhu</a> and with various sutras such as the <a href="Sandhinirmocana%20Sutra">Sandhinirmocana Sutra</a> and the <a href="Lankavatara%20Sutra">Lankavatara Sutra</a>. The central feature of Yogācāra thought is the concept of "Vijñapti-mātra", often translated as "impressions only" or "appearance only" and this has been interpreted as a form of <a href="Idealism">Idealism</a> or as a form of <a href="Phenomenology%20%28philosophy%29">Phenomenology</a>. Other names for the Yogacara school are 'Vijñanavada' (the doctrine of consciousness) and 'Cittamatra' (mind-only).

Yogacara thinkers like <a href="Vasubandhu">Vasubandhu</a> argued against the existence of external objects by pointing out that we only ever have access to our own mental impressions, and hence our inference of the existence of external objects is based on faulty logic. Vasubandhu's "Vijnaptimatratasiddhi", or 'The Proof that There Are Only Impressions' (20 verses) begins thus:

"I. This [world] is nothing but impressions, since it manifests itself as an unreal object, 
Just like the case of those with cataracts seeing unreal hairs in the moon and the like." 

According to <a href="Vasubandhu">Vasubandhu</a> then, all our experiences are like seeing hairs on the moon when we have cataracts, that is, we project our mental images into something "out there" when there are no such things. Vasubandhu then goes on to use the <a href="dream%20argument">dream argument</a> to argue that mental impressions do not require external objects to (1) seem to be spatio-temporally located, (2) to seem to have an inter-subjective quality, and (3) to seem to operate by causal laws. The fact that purely mental events can have causal efficacy and be intersubjective is proved by the event of a <a href="wet%20dream">wet dream</a> and by the mass or shared <a href="hallucinations">hallucinations</a> created by the karma of certain types of beings.

After having argued that impressions only is a theory which can explain our everyday experience, Vasubandhu then appeals to <a href="parsimony">parsimony</a> - since we do not need the concept of external objects to explain reality, then we can do away with those superfluous concepts altogether as they are most likely just mentally superimposed on our concepts of reality by the mind. Inter-subjective reality for Vasubandhu is then the causal interaction between various mental streams and their <a href="karma">karma</a>, and does not include any external physical objects. The soteriological importance of this theory is that by removing the concept of an external world, it also weakens the 'internal' sense of self as observer which is supposed to be separate from the external world. To dissolve the dualism of inner and outer is also to dissolve the sense of self and other. The later Yogacara commentator Sthiramati explains this thus:

"There is a grasper if there is something to be grasped, but not in the absence of what is to be grasped. Where there is no thing to be grasped, the absence of a grasper also follows, there is not just the absence of the thing to be grasped. Thus there arises the extra-mundane non-conceptual cognition that is alike without object and without cognizer."

Vasubandhu also attacked the realist theories of <a href="Buddhist%20atomism">Buddhist atomism</a> and the Abhidharma theory of <a href="svabhava">svabhava</a>. He argued that atoms as conceived by the atomists (un-divisible entities) would not be able to come together to form larger aggregate entities, and hence that they were illogical concepts.

Later Yogacara thinkers include <a href="Dharmapala%20of%20Nalanda">Dharmapala of Nalanda</a>, <a href="Sthiramati">Sthiramati</a>, <a href="Chandragomin">Chandragomin</a> (who debated Candrakirti), and <a href="%C5%9A%C4%ABlabhadra">Śīlabhadra</a>. Yogacarins such as <a href="Paramartha">Paramartha</a> and <a href="Gu%E1%B9%87abhadra">Guṇabhadra</a> brought the school to China and translated Yogacara works there, where it is known as <a href="East%20Asian%20Yog%C4%81c%C4%81ra">Wéishí-zōng or Fǎxiàng-zōng</a>. As an important contribution to East Asian Yogācāra is <a href="Xuanzang">Xuanzang</a>'s "Cheng Weishi Lun", or "Discourse on the Establishment of Consciousness Only.

<a href="J%C3%B1%C4%81nagarbha">Jñānagarbha</a> (8th century) and his student <a href="%C5%9A%C4%81ntarak%E1%B9%A3ita">Śāntarakṣita</a> (725–788) brought together Yogacara, Madhyamaka and the Dignaga school of epistemology into a philosophical synthesis known as the "Yogācāra-Svatantrika-Mādhyamika". Śāntarakṣita was also instrumental in the introduction of Buddhism and the Sarvastivadin monastic ordination lineage to Tibet which was conducted at Samye. <a href="%C5%9A%C4%81ntarak%E1%B9%A3ita">Śāntarakṣita</a>'s disciples included <a href="Haribhadra%20%28Buddhist%20philosopher%29">Haribhadra</a> and <a href="Kamala%C5%9B%C4%ABla">Kamalaśīla</a>. This philosophical tradition is influential in Tibetan Buddhist thought. 

The "<a href="Tathagatagarbha">tathāgathagarbha sutras</a>", in a departure from mainstream Buddhist language, insist that the potential for awakening is inherent to every sentient being. They marked a shift from a largely apophatic (negative) philosophical trend within Buddhism to a decidedly more <a href="cataphatic">cataphatic</a> (positive) modus.

Prior to the period of these scriptures, Mahāyāna <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a> had been dominated by teachings on <a href="emptiness">emptiness</a> in the form of <a href="Madhyamaka">Madhyamaka</a> philosophy. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the "tathāgatagarbha" genre of sutras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of <a href="dependent%20origination">dependent origination</a> using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism.

In these sutras the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self; the ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used previously in Indian philosophy by essentialist philosophers, but which was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary to describe a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.

The word "self" ("atman") is used in a way idiosyncratic to these sutras; the "true self" is described as the perfection of the wisdom of <a href="anatta">not-self</a> in the "Buddha-Nature Treatise", for example. Language that had previously been used by essentialist non-Buddhist philosophers was now adopted, with new definitions, by Buddhists to promote orthodox teachings.

The "tathāgatagarbha" does not, according to some scholars, represent a substantial self; rather, it is a positive language expression of <a href="sunyata">emptiness</a> and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. In this interpretation, the intention of the teaching of "tathāgatagarbha" is <a href="soteriology">soteriological</a> rather than theoretical.

The "<a href="Tathagatagarbha">tathāgathagarbha</a>", the <a href="Theravada">Theravāda</a> doctrine of "<a href="bhavanga">bhavaṅga</a>", and the <a href="Yogachara">Yogācāra</a> <a href="store%20consciousness">store consciousness</a> were all identified at some point with the <a href="luminous%20mind">luminous mind</a> of the Nikāyas.

In the Mahayana "<a href="Mahaparinirvana%20Sutra">Mahaparinirvana Sutra</a>", the Buddha insists that while pondering upon Dharma is vital, one must then relinquish fixation on words and letters, as these are utterly divorced from liberation and the <a href="Buddha-nature">Buddha-nature</a>.

<a href="Dign%C4%81ga">Dignāga</a> (c. 480–540) and <a href="Dharmak%C4%ABrti">Dharmakīrti</a> (c. 6-7th century) were Buddhist philosophers who developed a system of epistemology (<a href="Pram%C4%81%E1%B9%87a">Pramāṇa</a>) and <a href="Buddhist%20logic">logic</a> in their debates with the Brahminical philosophers in order to defend Buddhist doctrine. This tradition is called “those who follow reasoning” (Tibetan: rigs pa rjes su ‘brang ba); in modern literature it is sometimes known by the Sanskrit 'pramāṇavāda', or “the Epistemological School.” They were associated with the <a href="Yogacara">Yogacara</a> and <a href="Sautrantika">Sautrantika</a> schools, and defended theories held by both of these schools. Dignaga's influence was profound and led to an “epistemological turn” among all Buddhist and also all Sanskrit philosophers in India after his death. In the centuries following Dignaga's work, Sanskrit philosophers became much more focused on defending all of their propositions with fully developed theories of knowledge. 

The "School of Dignāga" includes later philosophers and commentators like Santabhadra, <a href="Dharmottara">Dharmottara</a> (8th century), <a href="J%C3%B1anasrimitra">Jñanasrimitra</a> (975–1025), <a href="Ratnak%C4%ABrti">Ratnakīrti</a> (11th century) and Samkarananda. 
The <a href="epistemology">epistemology</a> they developed defends the view that there are only two 'instruments of knowledge' or 'valid cognitions' ("pramāṇa"); "perception" (<a href="Pramana%23Hinduism">pratyaksa</a>) and "inference" (<a href="anum%C4%81%E1%B9%87a">anumāṇa</a>). Perception is a non-conceptual awareness of particulars which is bound by causality, while inference is reasonable, linguistic and conceptual. 

These Buddhist philosophers argued in favor of the theory of momentariness, the Yogacara "awareness only" view, the reality of particulars (svalakṣaṇa), atomism, nominalism and the self-reflexive nature of consciousness (<a href="svasa%E1%B9%83vedana">svasaṃvedana</a>). They attacked Hindu theories of God, universals, the authority of the Vedas, and the existence of a permanent soul ("atman").

The tradition associated with a group of texts known as the <a href="Buddhist%20Tantras">Buddhist Tantras</a>, known as <a href="Vajrayana">Vajrayana</a>, developed by the eighth century in North India. By this time Tantra was a key feature of Indian Buddhism, and Indian Tantric scholars developed philosophical defenses, <a href="hermeneutics">hermeneutics</a> and explanations of the Buddhist tantric systems, especially through commentaries on key tantras such as the <a href="Guhyasam%C4%81ja%20Tantra">Guhyasamāja Tantra</a> and the <a href="Guhyagarbha%20Tantra">Guhyagarbha Tantra</a>.

While the view of the Vajrayana was based on <a href="Madhyamaka">Madhyamaka</a>, <a href="Yogacara">Yogacara</a> and <a href="Buddha-nature">Buddha-nature</a> theories, it saw itself as being a faster vehicle to liberation containing many skillful methods (<a href="upaya">upaya</a>) of tantric ritual. The need for an explication and defense of the Tantras arose out of the unusual nature of the rituals associated with them, which included the use of secret <a href="mantras">mantras</a>, alcohol, <a href="Karmamudr%C4%81">sexual yoga</a>, complex visualizations of <a href="mandalas">mandalas</a> filled with <a href="wrathful%20deities">wrathful deities</a> and other practices and injunctions which were discordant with or at least novel in comparison to traditional Buddhist thought. The Guhyasamāja Tantra for example, states "you should kill living beings, speak lying words, take things that are not given and have sex with many women". Other features of tantra included a focus on the physical body as the means to liberation and a reaffirmation of feminine elements, feminine deities and sexuality. 

The defense of these practices is based on the theory of transformation which states that negative mental factors and physical actions can be cultivated and transformed in a ritual setting, the <a href="Hevajra%20tantra">Hevajra tantra</a> states:

Those things by which evil men are bound, others turn into means and gain thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion the world is bound, by passion too it is released, but by heretical Buddhists this practice of reversals is not known.

Another hermeneutic of Buddhist Tantric commentaries such as the <a href="Vimalaprabha">Vimalaprabha</a> of Pundarika (a commentary on the Kalacakra Tantra) is one of interpreting taboo or unethical statements in the Tantras as metaphorical statements about tantric practice. For example, in the Vimalaprabha, "killing living beings" refers to stopping the <a href="prana">prana</a> at the top of the head. In the Tantric Candrakirti's "Pradipoddyotana", a commentary to the Guhyasamaja Tantra, killing living beings is glossed as "making them void" by means of a "special <a href="samadhi">samadhi</a>" which according to Bus-ton is associated with <a href="completion%20stage">completion stage</a> tantric practice.

Douglas Duckworth notes that Vajrayana philosophical outlook is one of embodiment, which sees the physical and cosmological body as already containing wisdom and divinity. Liberation (<a href="nirvana">nirvana</a>) and <a href="Buddhahood">Buddhahood</a> is not seen as something outside or an event in the future, but as immanently present and accessible right now through unique tantric practices like <a href="deity%20yoga">deity yoga</a>, and hence Vajrayana is also called the "resultant vehicle". Duckworth names the philosophical view of Vajrayana as a form of <a href="pantheism">pantheism</a>, by which he means the belief that every existing entity is in some sense divine and that all things express some form of unity.

Major Indian Tantric Buddhist philosophers such as <a href="Buddhaguhya">Buddhaguhya</a>, Padmavajra (author of the "Guhyasiddhi"), Nagarjuna (7th century disciple of <a href="Saraha">Saraha</a>), <a href="Indrabhuti">Indrabhuti</a> (author of the "Jñānasiddhi"), Anangavajra, Dombiheruka, Durjayacandra, <a href="Ratn%C4%81kara%C5%9B%C4%81nti">Ratnākaraśānti</a> and <a href="Abhayakaragupta">Abhayakaragupta</a> wrote tantric texts and commentaries systematizing the tradition. Others such as <a href="Vajrabodhi">Vajrabodhi</a> and <a href="%C5%9Aubhakarasi%E1%B9%83ha">Śubhakarasiṃha</a> brought Tantra to Tang China (716 to 720), tantric philosophy continued to be developed in Chinese and Japanese by thinkers such as <a href="Yi%20Xing">Yi Xing</a> and <a href="K%C5%ABkai">Kūkai</a>. In <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a>, philosophers such as <a href="Sakya%20Pandita">Sakya Pandita</a> (1182-28 – 1251), <a href="Longchenpa">Longchenpa</a> (1308–1364) and <a href="Tsongkhapa">Tsongkhapa</a> (1357–1419) continued the tradition of Buddhist Tantric philosophy in Tibetan.

Tibetan Buddhist philosophy is mainly a continuation and refinement of the Indian traditions of Madhyamaka, Yogacara and the Dignaga-Dharmakīrti school of epistemology or "reliable cognition" (Sanskrit: "Pramana", Tib. "tshad ma"). The initial efforts of <a href="%C5%9A%C4%81ntarak%E1%B9%A3ita">Śāntarakṣita</a> and <a href="Kamala%C5%9B%C4%ABla">Kamalaśīla</a> brought their eclectic scholarly tradition to Tibet. Other influences include Buddhist Tantras and the Buddha nature texts.

The initial work of early Tibetan Buddhist philosophers was in translation of classical Indian philosophical treatises and the writing of commentaries, this initial period is from the 8th to the 10th century. Early Tibetan commentator philosophers were heavily influenced by the work of <a href="Dharmakirti">Dharmakirti</a> and these include Ngok Lo-dza-wa (1059-1109) and Cha-ba (1182-1251). Their works are now lost. The 12th and 13th centuries saw the translation of the works of <a href="Chandrakirti">Chandrakirti</a>, the promulgation of his views in Tibet by scholars such as Ba-Tsap (born 1055), Kanakavarman and Jayananda (12th century) and the development of the Tibetan debate between the <a href="prasangika">prasangika</a> and <a href="svatantrika">svatantrika</a> views which continues to this day among Tibetan Buddhist schools. The main disagreement between these views is the use of reasoned argument. For <a href="%C5%9A%C4%81ntarak%E1%B9%A3ita">Śāntarakṣita</a>, <a href="Kamala%C5%9B%C4%ABla">Kamalaśīla</a> and their defenders, reason is useful is establishing arguments that lead one to a correct understanding of emptiness, then, through the use of meditation, one can reach non-conceptual <a href="gnosis">gnosis</a> that does not rely on reason. For Chandrakirti however, this is wrong, because meditation on emptiness cannot possibly involve any object. Reason's role here is to negate any essence or essentialist views, and then eventually negate itself along with any <a href="Conceptual%20proliferation">Conceptual proliferation</a>.

There are various Tibetan Buddhist schools or monastic orders. According to Georges B.J. Dreyfus, within Tibetan thought, the <a href="Sakya">Sakya</a> school holds a mostly <a href="anti-realist">anti-realist</a> philosophical position, while the <a href="Gelug">Gelug</a> school tends to defend a form of <a href="Philosophical%20realism">realism</a>. The <a href="Kagyu">Kagyu</a> and <a href="Nyingma">Nyingma</a> schools also tend to follow Sakya anti-realism (with some differences).

The 14th century saw increasing interest in the <a href="Buddha%20nature">Buddha nature</a> texts and doctrines. This can be seen in the work of the third Kagyu Karmapa <a href="Rangjung%20Dorje">Rangjung Dorje</a> (1284-1339), especially his treatise "Profound Inner Meaning". This treatise describes ultimate nature or <a href="suchness">suchness</a> as Buddha nature which is the basis for nirvana and samsara, radiant in nature and empty in essence, surpassing thought.

<a href="Dolpopa">Dolpopa</a> ("Dol-bo-ba", 1292–1361), founder of the <a href="Jonang">Jonang</a> school, developed a view called <a href="shentong">shentong</a> (Wylie: gzhan ) (other empty), which is closely tied to <a href="Yogacara">Yogacara</a> and Buddha-nature theories. This view holds that the qualities of Buddhahood or <a href="Buddha%20nature">Buddha nature</a> are already present in the mind, and that it is empty of all conventional reality which occludes its own nature as Buddhahood or <a href="Dharmakaya">Dharmakaya</a>. According to Dolpopa all beings are said to have Buddha nature which is real, unchanging, permanent, non-conditioned, eternal, blissful and compassionate. Dolpopa's shentong view taught that ultimate reality was truly a "Great Self" or "Supreme Self" referring to works such as the "<a href="Mah%C4%81y%C4%81na%20Mah%C4%81parinirv%C4%81%E1%B9%87a%20S%C5%ABtra">Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra</a>", the "<a href="A%E1%B9%85gulim%C4%81l%C4%ABya%20S%C5%ABtra">Aṅgulimālīya Sūtra</a>" and the "<a href="%C5%9Ar%C4%ABm%C4%81l%C4%81dev%C4%AB%20Si%E1%B9%83han%C4%81da%20S%C5%ABtra">Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra</a>." This view had an influence on philosophers of other schools, such as <a href="Nyingma">Nyingma</a> and <a href="Kagyu">Kagyu</a> thinkers and was also widely criticized in some circles as being similar to the Hindu notions of <a href="%C4%80tman%20%28Hinduism%29">Atman</a>. The Shentong philosophy was also expounded in Tibet and Mongolia by the later Jonang scholar <a href="T%C4%81ran%C4%81tha">Tāranātha</a> (1575–1634).

In the late 17th century the Jonang order and its teachings came under attack by the <a href="5th%20Dalai%20Lama">5th Dalai Lama</a>, who converted the majority of their monasteries in <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a> to the <a href="Gelug">Gelug</a> order, although several survived in secret.

<a href="Je%20Tsongkhapa">Je Tsongkhapa</a> (Dzong-ka-ba) (1357–1419) founded the <a href="Gelug">Gelug</a> school of Tibetan Buddhism which came to dominate the country through the office of the <a href="Dalai%20Lama">Dalai Lama</a> and is the major defender of the <a href="Prasa%E1%B9%85gika">Prasaṅgika</a> Madhyamaka view, his work is influenced by the philosophy of <a href="Candrakirti">Candrakirti</a> and <a href="Dharmakirti">Dharmakirti</a>. Tsongkhapa's magnum opus is "The Ocean of Reasoning", a Commentary on Nagarjuna’s <a href="Mulamadhyamakakarika">Mulamadhyamakakarika</a>. Gelug philosophy is based upon study of Madhyamaka texts and Tsongkhapa's works as well as formal debate (rtsod pa).

Tsongkhapa defended Prasangika <a href="Madhyamaka">Madhyamaka</a> as the highest view and critiqued the <a href="Svatantrika">Svatantrika</a>. Tsongkhapa argued that because the Svatantrika conventionally establish things by their own characteristics, they fail to completely understand the <a href="Shunyata">emptiness</a> of phenomena and hence do not achieve the same realization. Drawing on Chandrakirti, Tsongkhapa rejected the Yogacara teachings, even as a provisional stepping point to the Madhyamaka view. Tsongkhapa was also critical of the Shengtong view of Dolpopa, which he saw as dangerously absolutist and hence outside of the middle way. Tsongkhapa identified two major flaws in interpretations of Madhyamika, under-negation (of <a href="svabhava">svabhava</a> or own essence) which could lead to Absolutism and over-negation which could lead to Nihilism. Tsongkhapa's solution to this dilemma was the promotion of the use of inferential reasoning only within the conventional realm of the <a href="two%20truths">two truths</a> framework, allowing for the use of reason for ethics, conventional monastic rules and promoting a conventional epistemic realism while holding that from the view of ultimate truth ("paramarthika satya"), all things (including <a href="Buddha%20nature">Buddha nature</a> and <a href="Nirvana">Nirvana</a>) are empty of inherent existence (<a href="svabhava">svabhava</a>) and true enlightenment is this realization of emptiness.

Sakya scholars such as Rongtön and <a href="Gorampa">Gorampa</a> disagreed with Tsongkhapa, and argued that the prasangika svatantrika distinction was merely pedagogical. Gorampa also critiqued Tsongkhapa's realism, arguing that the structures which allow an empty object to be presented as conventionally real eventually dissolve under analysis and are thus unstructured and non-conceptual (spros bral). Tsongkhapa's students Gyel-tsap, Kay-drup, and Ge-dun-drup set forth an epistemological realism against the Sakya scholars' anti-realism.

<a href="Sakya%20Pandita">Sakya Pandita</a> (1182–1251) was a 13th-century head of the <a href="Sakya">Sakya</a> school and ruler of Tibet. He was also one of the most important Buddhist philosophers in the Tibetan tradition, writing works on logic and epistemology and promoting <a href="Dharmakirti">Dharmakirti</a>'s "<a href="Pramanavarttika">Pramanavarttika</a>" (Commentary on Valid Cognition) as central to scholastic study. Sakya Pandita's 'Treasury of Logic on Valid Cognition' ("Tshad ma rigs pa'i gter") set forth the classic Sakya epistemic anti-realist position, arguing that concepts such as <a href="Universal%20%28metaphysics%29">universals</a> are not known through valid cognition and hence are not real objects of knowledge. Sakya Pandita was also critical of theories of sudden enlightenment which was held by some teachers of the "Chinese Great Perfection" in Tibet.

Later Sakyas such as <a href="Gorampa">Gorampa</a> (1429–1489) and <a href="Sakya%20Chokden">Sakya Chokden</a> (1428–1507) would develop and defend Sakya anti-realism, and they are seen as the major interpreters and critics of Sakya Pandita's philosophy. <a href="Sakya%20Chokden">Sakya Chokden</a> also critiqued Tsongkhapa's interpretation of Madhyamaka and Dolpopa's Shentong. In his "Definite ascertainment of the middle way", Chokden criticized Tsongkhapa's view as being too logo-centric and still caught up in conceptualization about the ultimate reality which is beyond language. Sakya Chokden's philosophy attempted to reconcile the views of the Yogacara and Madhyamaka, seeing them both as valid and complementary perspectives on ultimate truth. Madhyamaka is seen by Chokden as removing the fault of taking the unreal as being real, and Yogacara removes the fault of the denial of Reality. Likewise, the Shentong and Rangtong views are seen as complementary by Sakya Chokden; Rangtong negation is effective in cutting through all clinging to wrong views and conceptual rectification while Shentong is more amenable for describing and enhancing meditative experience and realization. Therefore, for Sakya Chokden, the same realization of ultimate reality can be accessed and described in two different but compatible ways.

The Nyingma school is strongly influenced by the view of <a href="Dzogchen">Dzogchen</a> (Great Perfection) and the Dzogchen Tantric literature. <a href="Longchenpa">Longchenpa</a> (1308–1364) was a major philosopher of the <a href="Nyingma">Nyingma</a> school and wrote an extensive number of works on the Tibetan practice of <a href="Dzogchen">Dzogchen</a> and on Buddhist <a href="Tantra">Tantra</a>. These include the "<a href="Seven%20Treasuries">Seven Treasures</a>", the "<a href="Trilogy%20of%20Natural%20Ease">Trilogy of Natural Ease</a>", and his "<a href="Trilogy%20of%20Dispelling%20Darkness">Trilogy of Dispelling Darkness</a>". Longchenpa's works provide a philosophical understanding of Dzogchen, a defense of Dzogchen in light of the sutras, as well as practical instructions. For Longchenpa, the ground of reality is luminous clarity, <a href="rigpa">rigpa</a>, or <a href="Buddha%20nature">Buddha nature</a> and this ground is also the bridge between sutra and <a href="tantra">tantra</a>. Longchenpa's philosophy sought to establish the positive aspects of Buddha nature thought against the totally negative theology of Madhyamika without straying into the absolutism of Dolpopa. For Longchenpa, the basis for Dzogchen and Tantric practice in Vajrayana is the "Ground" ("gzhi"), the imminent Buddha nature, "the primordially luminous reality that is unconditioned and spontaneously present" which is "free from all elaborated extremes".

The 19th century saw the rise of the <a href="Rim%C3%A9%20movement">Rimé movement</a> (non-sectarian, unbiased) which sought to push back against the politically dominant Gelug school's criticisms of the Sakya, Kagyu, Nyingma and <a href="Bon">Bon</a> philosophical views and develop a more eclectic or universal system of textual study. <a href="Jamyang%20Khyentse%20Wangpo">Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo</a> (1820-1892) and <a href="Jamg%C3%B6n%20Kongtr%C3%BCl">Jamgön Kongtrül</a> (1813-1899) were the founders of Rimé. The Rimé movement came to prominence at a point in Tibetan history when the religious climate had become partisan. The aim of the movement was "a push towards a middle ground where the various views and styles of the different traditions were appreciated for their individual contributions rather than being refuted, marginalized, or banned." Philosophically, <a href="Jamg%C3%B6n%20Kongtr%C3%BCl">Jamgön Kongtrül</a> defended <a href="Shentong">Shentong</a> as being compatible with Madhyamaka while another Rimé scholar <a href="Jamgon%20Ju%20Mipham%20Gyatso">Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso</a> (1846–1912) criticized Tsongkhapa from a <a href="Nyingma">Nyingma</a> perspective. Mipham argued that the view of the middle way is Unity (zung 'jug), meaning that from the ultimate perspective the duality of sentient beings and Buddhas is also dissolved. Mipham also affirmed the view of "rangtong" (self emptiness). The later Nyingma scholar Botrul (1894–1959) classified the major Tibetan Madhyamaka positions as shentong (other emptiness), Nyingma rangtong (self emptiness) and Gelug bdentong (emptiness of true existence). The main difference between them is their "object of negation"; shengtong states that inauthentic experience is empty, rangtong negates any conceptual reference and bdentong negates any true existence.

The <a href="14th%20Dalai%20Lama">14th Dalai Lama</a> was also influenced by this eclectic approach. Having studied under teachers from all major Tibetan Buddhist schools, his philosophical position tends to be that the different perspectives on emptiness are complementary:

There is a tradition of making a distinction between two different perspectives on the nature of emptiness: one is when emptiness is presented within a philosophical analysis of the ultimate reality of things, in which case it ought to be understood in terms of a non-affirming negative phenomena. On the other hand, when it is discussed from the point of view of experience, it should be understood more in terms of an affirming negation – 14th Dalai Lama

The schools of Buddhism that had existed in China prior to the emergence of the Tiantai are generally believed to represent direct transplantations from India, with little modification to their basic doctrines and methods. The Tiantai school, founded by <a href="Zhiyi">Zhiyi</a> (538–597), was the first truly unique Chinese Buddhist philosophical school. The doctrine of Tiantai was based on the <a href="ekayana">ekayana</a> or "one vehicle" doctrine taught in the <a href="Lotus%20sutra">Lotus sutra</a> and sought to bring together all Buddhist teachings and texts into a comprehensively inclusive hierarchical system, which placed the Lotus sutra at the top of this hierarchy.

Tiantai's metaphysics is an immanent <a href="holism">holism</a>, which sees every phenomenon, moment or event as conditioned and manifested by the whole of reality. Every instant of experience is a reflection of every other, and hence, suffering and nirvana, good and bad, Buddhahood and evildoing, are all “inherently entailed” within each other. Each moment of consciousness is simply the <a href="Absolute%20%28philosophy%29">Absolute</a> itself, infinitely immanent and self reflecting.

This metaphysics is entailed in the Tiantai teaching of the "three truths" which is an extension of the Mādhyamaka <a href="two%20truths">two truths</a> doctrine. The three truths are: the conventional truth of appearance, the truth of emptiness (<a href="shunyata">shunyata</a>) and the third truth of 'the exclusive Center' (但中 "danzhong") or middle way, which is beyond conventional truth and emptiness. This third truth is the <a href="Absolute%20%28philosophy%29">Absolute</a> and expressed by the claim that nothing is “Neither-Same-Nor-Different” than anything else, but rather each 'thing' is the absolute totality of all things manifesting as a particular, everything is mutually contained within each thing. Everything is a reflection of 'The Ultimate Reality of All Appearances'(諸法實相 zhufashixiang) and each thought "contains three thousand worlds". This perspective allows the Tiantai school to state such seemingly paradoxical things as "evil is ineradicable from the highest good, <a href="Buddhahood">Buddhahood</a>." Moreover, in Tiantai, nirvana and samsara are the ultimately the same, as Zhiyi writes "A single, unalloyed reality is all there is – no entities whatever exist outside of it."

Though Zhiyi did write "One thought contains three thousand worlds", this does not entail idealism. According to Zhiyi, "The objects of the [true] aspects of reality are not something produced by Buddhas, gods, or men. They exist inherently on their own and have no beginning" (The Esoteric Meaning, 210). This is then a form of realism, which sees the mind as real as the world, interconnected with and inseparable from it. In Tiantai thought, ultimate reality is simply the phenomenal world of interconnected events or dharmas.

Other key figures of Tiantai thought are <a href="Zhanran">Zhanran</a> (711–782) and <a href="Siming%20Zhili">Siming Zhili</a> (960–1028). Zhanran developed the idea that non-sentient beings have <a href="Buddha%20nature">Buddha nature</a>, since they are also a reflection of the Absolute. In Japan, this school was known as <a href="Tendai">Tendai</a> and was first brought to the island by <a href="Saicho">Saicho</a>.

The <a href="Huayan%20school">Huayan</a> developed the doctrine of "interpenetration" or "coalescence" (Wylie: "zung-'jug"; Sanskrit: "yuganaddha"), based on the "<a href="Avatamsaka%20Sutra">Avataṃsaka Sūtra</a>" (Flower Garland sutra), a Mahāyāna scripture. Huayan holds that all phenomena (Sanskrit: "<a href="dharmas">dharmas</a>") are deeply interconnected, mutually arising and that every phenomena contains every other phenomena. Various metaphors and images are used to illustrate this idea. The first is known as <a href="Indra%27s%20net">Indra's net</a>. The net is set with jewels which have the extraordinary property that they reflect all of the other jewels, while the reflections also contain every other reflection, ad infinitum. The second image is that of the world text. This image portrays the world as consisting of an enormous text which is as large as the universe itself. The words of the text are composed of the phenomena that make up the world. However, every atom of the world contains the whole text within it. It is the work of a Buddha to let out the text so that beings can be liberated from suffering.

<a href="Fazang">Fazang</a> (Fa-tsang, 643–712), one of the most important Huayan thinkers, wrote 'Essay on the Golden Lion' and 'Treatise on the Five Teachings', which contain other metaphors for the interpenetration of reality. He also used the metaphor of a <a href="House%20of%20mirrors">House of mirrors</a>. Fazang introduced the distinction of "the Realm of Principle" and "the Realm of Things". This theory was further developed by <a href="Chengguan%20%28monk%29">Cheng-guan</a> (738–839) into the major Huayan thesis of "the fourfold <a href="Dharmadhatu">Dharmadhatu</a>" (dharma realm): the Realm of Principle, the Realm of Things, the Realm of the Noninterference between Principle and Things, and the Realm of the Noninterference of All Things. The first two are the universal and the particular, the third is the interpenetration of universal and particular, and the fourth is the interpenetration of all particulars. The third truth was explained by the metaphor of a golden lion, the gold is the universal and the particular is the shape and features of the lion. 
While both Tiantai and Huayan hold to the interpenetration and interconnection of all things, their metaphysics have some differences. Huayan metaphysics is influenced by Yogacara thought and is closer to <a href="idealism">idealism</a>. The Avatamsaka sutra compares the phenomenal world to a dream, an illusion, and a magician’s conjuring. The sutra states nothing has true reality, location, beginning and end, or substantial nature. The Avatamsaka also states that "The triple world is illusory – it is only made by one mind" and Fazang echoes this by writing "outside of mind there is not a single thing that can be apprehended." Furthermore, according to Huayan thought, each mind creates its own world "according to their mental patterns", and "these worlds are infinite in kind" and constantly arising and passing away. However, in Huayan, mind is not real either, but also empty. The true reality in Huayan, the noumenon, or "Principle" is likened to a mirror, while phenomena are compared to reflections in the mirror. It is also compared to the ocean, and phenomena to waves.

In <a href="Korea">Korea</a>, this school was known as <a href="Hwaeom">Hwaeom</a> and is represented in the work of <a href="Wonhyo">Wonhyo</a> (617–686), who also wrote about the idea of <a href="Essence-Function">essence-function</a>, a central theme in Korean Buddhist thought. In <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, Huayan is known as <a href="Kegon">Kegon</a> and one of its major proponents was <a href="My%C5%8De">Myōe</a>, who also introduced Tantric practices.

The philosophy of Chinese <a href="Chan%20Buddhism">Chan Buddhism</a> and Japanese <a href="Zen">Zen</a> is based on various sources, these include Madhyamaka, Yogacara, the <a href="La%E1%B9%85k%C4%81vat%C4%81ra%20S%C5%ABtra">Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra</a>, Huayan and the Buddha nature texts. An important issue in Chan is that of <a href="subitism">subitism</a> or "sudden enlightenment", the idea that enlightenment happens all at once in a flash of insight. This view was promoted by <a href="Shenhui">Shenhui</a> and is a central issue discussed in the <a href="Platform%20Sutra">Platform Sutra</a>, a key Chan scripture composed in China.

Huayan philosophy also had an influence on Chan. The theory of the Fourfold Dharmadhatu influenced the <a href="Five%20Ranks">Five Ranks</a> of <a href="Dongshan%20Liangjie">Dongshan Liangjie</a> (806-869), the founder of the <a href="Caodong">Caodong</a> Chan lineage. <a href="Guifeng%20Zongmi">Guifeng Zongmi</a>, who was also a patriarch of Huayan Buddhism, wrote extensively on the philosophy of Chan and on the Avatamsaka sutra.

In Japan, the founder of <a href="Soto%20Zen">Soto Zen</a>, <a href="Dogen">Dogen</a> (1200–1253), wrote many works on the philosophy of Zen, and the <a href="Shobogenzo">Shobogenzo</a> is his magnum opus.

In Korea, <a href="Chinul">Chinul</a> is an important exponent of Seon Buddhism.

<a href="Tantric%20Buddhism">Tantric Buddhism</a> arrived in China in the 7th century, during the <a href="Tang%20Dynasty">Tang Dynasty</a>. In China, this form of Buddhism is known as Mìzōng (密宗), or "Esoteric School" and "Zhenyan" (true word, Sanskrit: <a href="Mantrayana">Mantrayana</a>). <a href="K%C5%ABkai">Kūkai</a> (AD774–835) is a major Japanese Buddhist philosopher and the founder of the Tantric <a href="Shingon">Shingon</a> (true word) school in Japan. He wrote on a wide variety of topics such as public policy, language, the arts, literature, music and religion. After studying in China under <a href="Huiguo">Huiguo</a>, Kūkai brought together various elements into a cohesive philosophical system of Shingon.

Kūkai's philosophy is based on the <a href="Mahavairocana%20Tantra">Mahavairocana Tantra</a> and the <a href="Vajrasekhara%20Sutra">Vajrasekhara Sutra</a> (both from the seventh century). His "Benkenmitsu nikkyôron" (Treatise on the Differences Between Esoteric and Exoteric Teachings) outlines the difference between exoteric, mainstream <a href="Mahayana%20Buddhism">Mahayana Buddhism</a> (kengyô) and esoteric <a href="Tantric%20Buddhism">Tantric Buddhism</a> (mikkyô). Kūkai provided the theoretical framework for the esoteric Buddhist practices of Mantrayana, bringing the gap between the doctrine of the sutras and tantric practices. At the foundation of Kūkai's thought is the <a href="Trikaya">Trikaya</a> doctrine, which holds there are three "bodies of the Buddha".

According to Kūkai, esoteric Buddhism has the <a href="Dharmakaya">Dharmakaya</a> (Jpn: "hosshin", embodiment of truth) as its source, which is associated with <a href="Vairocana">Vairocana</a> Buddha (Dainichi). Hosshin is embodied absolute reality and truth. Hosshin is mostly ineffable but can be experienced through esoteric practices such as <a href="mudras">mudras</a> and <a href="mantras">mantras</a>. While Mahayana is taught by the historical Buddha (nirmankaya), it does not have ultimate reality as its source or the practices to experience the esoteric truth. For Shingon, from an enlightened perspective, the whole phenomenal world itself is also the teaching of Vairocana. The body of the world, its sounds and movements, is the body of truth (dharma) and furthermore it is also identical with the personal body of the cosmic Buddha. For Kūkai, world, actions, persons and Buddhas are all part of the cosmic monologue of Vairocana, they are the truth being preached, to its own self manifestations. This is "hosshin seppô" (literally: “the dharmakâya's expounding of the Dharma”) which can be accessed through mantra which is the cosmic language of Vairocana emanating through cosmic vibration concentrated in sound. In a broad sense, the universe itself a huge text expressing ultimate truth (Dharma) which must be "read".

Dainichi means "Great Sun" and Kūkai uses this as a metaphor for the great primordial Buddha, whose teaching and presence illuminates and pervades all, like the light of the sun. This immanent presence also means that every being already has access to enlightenment (<a href="hongaku">hongaku</a>) and <a href="Buddha%20nature">Buddha nature</a>, and that because of this, there is the possibility of "becoming Buddha in this very embodied existence" ("sokushinjôbutsu"). This is achieved because of the <a href="non-dual">non-dual</a> relationship between the macrocosm of Hosshin and the microcosm of the Shingon practitioner.

Kūkai's exposition of what has been called Shingon's "metaphysics", is based on the three aspects of the cosmic truth or Hosshin - body, appearance and function. The body is the physical and mental elements, which are the body and mind of the cosmic Buddha and which is also empty (<a href="Shunyata">Shunyata</a>) The physical universe for Shingon, contains the interconnected mental and physical events. The appearance aspect is the form of the world, which appears as mandalas of interconnected realms and is depicted in mandala art such the <a href="Womb%20Realm">Womb Realm</a> mandala. The function is the movement and change which happens in the world, which includes change in forms, sounds and thought. These forms, sounds and thoughts are expressed by the Shingon practitioner in various rituals and tantric practices which allow them to connect with and inter-resonate with Dainichi and hence reach enlightenment here and now.

In <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, Buddhist modernists such as <a href="Anagarika%20Dharmapala">Anagarika Dharmapala</a> (1864-1933) and the American convert <a href="Henry%20Steel%20Olcott">Henry Steel Olcott</a> sought to show that Buddhism was rational and compatible with modern Scientific ideas such as the theory of evolution. Dharmapala also argued that Buddhism included a strong social element, interpreting it as liberal, altruistic and democratic. <a href="K.%20N.%20Jayatilleke">K. N. Jayatilleke</a> wrote the classic modern account of Buddhist epistemology ("Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge", 1963) and his student <a href="David%20Kalupahana">David Kalupahana</a> wrote on the history of Buddhist thought and psychology. Other important Sri Lankan Buddhist thinkers include <a href="Katukurunde%20Nanananda%20Thera">Ven Ñāṇananda</a> ("Concept and Reality"), <a href="Walpola%20Rahula">Walpola Rahula</a>, <a href="Hammalawa%20Saddhatissa">Hammalawa Saddhatissa</a> ("Buddhist Ethics", 1987), Gunapala Dharmasiri ("A Buddhist critique of the Christian concept of God", 1988), <a href="P.%20D.%20Premasiri">P. D. Premasiri</a> and <a href="R.%20G.%20de%20S.%20Wettimuny">R. G. de S. Wettimuny</a>.

In 20th century China, the modernist <a href="Taixu">Taixu</a> (1890-1947) advocated a reform and revival of Buddhism. His promoted an idea of a Buddhist <a href="Pure%20Land">Pure Land</a>, not as a metaphysical place in Buddhist cosmology but as something possible to create here and now in this very world which could be achieved through a "Buddhism for Human Life" (Chinese: 人生佛教; pinyin: rénshēng fójiào) which was free of supernatural beliefs. Taixu also wrote on the connections between modern science and Buddhism, ultimately holding that “scientific methods can only corroborate the Buddhist doctrine, they can never advance beyond it”. Like Taixu, <a href="Yin%20Shun">Yin Shun</a> (1906–2005) advocated a form of <a href="Humanistic%20Buddhism">Humanistic Buddhism</a> grounded in concern for humanitarian issues and his students and followers have been influential in promoting <a href="Humanistic%20Buddhism">Humanistic Buddhism</a> in <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>. This period also saw a revival of the study of Weishi (<a href="Yogachara">Yogachara</a>), by <a href="Yang%20Rensan">Yang Rensan</a> (1837-1911), <a href="Ouyang%20Jinwu">Ouyang Jinwu</a> (1871-1943) and <a href="Liang%20Shuming">Liang Shuming</a> (1893–1988).

One of Tibetan Buddhism's most influential modernist thinkers is <a href="Gend%C3%BCn%20Ch%C3%B6phel">Gendün Chöphel</a> (1903–1951), who, according to Donald S. Lopez Jr. “was arguably the most important Tibetan intellectual of the twentieth century.” Gendün Chöphel traveled throughout India with the Indian Buddhist <a href="Rahul%20Sankrityayan">Rahul Sankrityayan</a> and wrote a wide variety of material, including works promoting the importance of modern science to his Tibetan countrymen and also Buddhist philosophical texts such as "Adornment for Nagarjuna’s Thought". Another very influential Tibetan Buddhist modernist was <a href="Ch%C3%B6gyam%20Trungpa">Chögyam Trungpa</a>, whose <a href="Shambhala%20Training">Shambhala Training</a> was meant to be more suitable to modern Western sensitivities by offering a vision of "secular enlightenment".

In <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, thinkers such as <a href="Buddhadasa">Buddhadasa</a>, <a href="Th%C3%ADch%20Nh%E1%BA%A5t%20H%E1%BA%A1nh">Thích Nhất Hạnh</a>, <a href="Sulak%20Sivaraksa">Sulak Sivaraksa</a> and <a href="Aung%20San%20Suu%20Kyi">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> have promoted a philosophy of socially <a href="Engaged%20Buddhism">Engaged Buddhism</a> and have written on the socio-political application of Buddhism. Likewise, Buddhist approaches to economic ethics (<a href="Buddhist%20economics">Buddhist economics</a>) have been explored in the works of <a href="E.%20F.%20Schumacher">E. F. Schumacher</a>, <a href="Prayudh%20Payutto">Prayudh Payutto</a>, <a href="Neville%20Karunatilake">Neville Karunatilake</a> and Padmasiri de Silva. The study of the Pali Abhidhamma tradition continued to be influential in <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a>, where it was developed by monks such as <a href="Ledi%20Sayadaw">Ledi Sayadaw</a> and <a href="Mahasi%20Sayadaw">Mahasi Sayadaw</a>.

Japanese Buddhist philosophy was heavily influenced by the work of the <a href="Kyoto%20School">Kyoto School</a> which included <a href="Kitaro%20Nishida">Kitaro Nishida</a>, <a href="Keiji%20Nishitani">Keiji Nishitani</a>, <a href="Hajime%20Tanabe">Hajime Tanabe</a> and <a href="Masao%20Abe">Masao Abe</a>. These thinkers brought Buddhist ideas in dialogue with Western philosophy, especially European phenomenologists and existentialists. The most important trend in Japanese Buddhist thought after the formation of the Kyoto school is <a href="Critical%20Buddhism">Critical Buddhism</a>, which argues against several Mahayana concepts such as <a href="Buddha%20nature">Buddha nature</a> and <a href="Hongaku">original enlightenment</a>. In <a href="Nichiren%20Buddhism">Nichiren Buddhism</a>, the work of <a href="Daisaku%20Ikeda">Daisaku Ikeda</a> has also been popular.

The Japanese Zen Buddhist <a href="D.T.%20Suzuki">D.T. Suzuki</a> (1870–1966) was instrumental in bringing <a href="Zen%20Buddhism">Zen Buddhism</a> to the West and his <a href="Buddhist%20modernism">Buddhist modernist</a> works were very influential in the United States. Suzuki's worldview was a Zen Buddhism influenced by <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> and <a href="Transcendentalism">Transcendentalism</a>, which promoted a spiritual freedom as "a spontaneous, emancipatory consciousness that transcends rational intellect and social convention." This idea of Buddhism influenced the Beat writers and a contemporary representative of Western Buddhist Romanticism is <a href="Gary%20Snyder">Gary Snyder</a>. The American Theravada Buddhist monk <a href="Thanissaro%20Bhikkhu">Thanissaro Bhikkhu</a> has critiqued 'Buddhist Romanticism' in his writings.

Western Buddhist monastics and priests such as <a href="Nanavira%20Thera">Nanavira Thera</a>, <a href="Bhikkhu%20Bodhi">Bhikkhu Bodhi</a>, <a href="Nyanaponika%20Thera">Nyanaponika Thera</a>, <a href="Robert%20Baker%20Aitken">Robert Aitken</a>, <a href="Taigen%20Dan%20Leighton">Taigen Dan Leighton</a>, <a href="Matthieu%20Ricard">Matthieu Ricard</a> have written texts on Buddhist philosophy. A feature of Buddhist thought in the West has been a desire for dialogue and integration with modern science and psychology, and various modern Buddhists such as <a href="Alan%20Wallace">Alan Wallace</a>, <a href="James%20H.%20Austin">James H. Austin</a>, <a href="Mark%20Epstein">Mark Epstein</a> and the <a href="14th%20Dalai%20Lama">14th Dalai Lama</a> have worked and written on this issue. Another area of convergence has been Buddhism and environmentalism, which is explored in the work of <a href="Joanna%20Macy">Joanna Macy</a>. Another Western Buddhist philosophical trend has been the project to <a href="Secular%20Buddhism">secularize Buddhism</a>, as seen in the works of <a href="Stephen%20Batchelor%20%28author%29">Stephen Batchelor</a>.

In the West, Comparative philosophy between Buddhist and Western thought began with the work of <a href="Charles%20A.%20Moore">Charles A. Moore</a> who founded the journal <a href="Philosophy%20East%20and%20West">Philosophy East and West</a>. Contemporary Western Academics such as <a href="Mark%20Siderits">Mark Siderits</a>, <a href="Jan%20Westerhoff">Jan Westerhoff</a>, <a href="Jonardon%20Ganeri">Jonardon Ganeri</a>, <a href="Miri%20Albahari">Miri Albahari</a>, <a href="Owen%20Flanagan">Owen Flanagan</a>, <a href="Damien%20Keown">Damien Keown</a>, <a href="Tom%20Tillemans">Tom Tillemans</a>, <a href="David%20Loy">David Loy</a>, <a href="Evan%20Thompson">Evan Thompson</a> and <a href="Jay%20Garfield">Jay Garfield</a> have written various works which interpret Buddhist ideas through <a href="Western%20philosophy">Western philosophy</a>.

<a href="Baruch%20Spinoza">Baruch Spinoza</a>, though he argued for the existence of a permanent reality, asserts that all phenomenal existence is transitory. In his opinion sorrow is conquered "by finding an object of knowledge which is not transient, not ephemeral, but is immutable, permanent, everlasting." The Buddha taught that the only thing which is eternal is <a href="Nirvana">Nirvana</a>. <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>, after a relentless analysis of the mind, concluded that consciousness consists of fleeting mental states. Hume's <a href="Bundle%20theory">Bundle theory</a> is a very similar concept to the Buddhist "<a href="skandhas">skandhas</a>", though his skepticism about causation lead him to opposite conclusions in other areas. <a href="Arthur%20Schopenhauer">Arthur Schopenhauer</a>'s philosophy parallels Buddhism in his affirmation of <a href="asceticism">asceticism</a> and renunciation as a response to suffering and desire.

<a href="Ludwig%20Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>'s "<a href="language-game">language-game</a>" closely parallel the warning that intellectual speculation or <a href="papa%C3%B1ca">papañca</a> is an impediment to understanding, as found in the Buddhist "<a href="Parable%20of%20the%20Poison%20Arrow">Parable of the Poison Arrow</a>". <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, although himself dismissive of Buddhism as yet another nihilism, had a similar impermanent view of the self. <a href="Heidegger">Heidegger</a>'s ideas on being and nothingness have been held by some to be similar to Buddhism today.

An alternative approach to the comparison of Buddhist thought with Western philosophy is to use the concept of the <a href="Middle%20Way">Middle Way</a> in Buddhism as a critical tool for the assessment of Western philosophies. In this way Western philosophies can be classified in Buddhist terms as eternalist or nihilist. In a Buddhist view all philosophies are considered non-essential views (<a href="View%20%28Buddhism%29">ditthis</a>) and not to be clung to.

His brother, Jimmy Don (April 1958 – October 1988), wrote a number of songs, two of which ("Island Avenue" and "Emily") Thornton has recorded on his solo albums.

During his childhood, Thornton lived in numerous places in Arkansas, including <a href="Alpine%2C%20Arkansas">Alpine</a>, <a href="Mount%20Holly%2C%20Arkansas">Mount Holly</a>, and <a href="Malvern%2C%20Arkansas">Malvern</a>.

The negative experience (he was forced to cut more than an hour of footage) led to his decision to never direct another film; a subsequent release, "<a href="Daddy%20and%20Them">Daddy and Them</a>", had been filmed earlier. Also in 2000, an early script which he and <a href="Tom%20Epperson">Tom Epperson</a> wrote together was made into "<a href="The%20Gift%20%282000%20film%29">The Gift</a>".

He stated that, following the success of "Bad Santa", audiences "like to watch him play that kind of guy" and that "casting directors call him up when they need an asshole".

Thornton's manager, <a href="David%20Spero">David Spero</a>, helped his "Edge of the World" album get off the ground with a summer tour. Thornton was the singer of a <a href="blues%20music">blues</a> rock band named "Tres Hombres".

Thornton eventually explained he had "instructed" the show's producers to not ask questions about his movie career. Ghomeshi had mentioned Thornton’s acting in the introduction. Thornton had also complained Canadian audiences were like "mashed potatoes without the gravy." The following night, opening for <a href="Willie%20Nelson">Willie Nelson</a> at Toronto's <a href="Massey%20Hall">Massey Hall</a>, Thornton said mid-set he liked Canadians but not Ghomeshi, which was greeted with boos and catcalls. The Boxmasters did not continue the tour in Canada as, according to Thornton, some of the crew and band had the flu.


Thornton has married six times, with the first five marriages ending in divorce, and he has four children by three women. From 1978 to 1980, he was married to Melissa Lee Gatlin, with whom he had a daughter, Amanda. Thornton married actress Toni Lawrence in 1986; they separated the following year and divorced in 1988.

Thornton was engaged to be married to actress <a href="Laura%20Dern">Laura Dern</a>, whom he dated from 1997 to 1999, but in 2000, he married actress <a href="Angelina%20Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>, with whom he starred in "<a href="Pushing%20Tin">Pushing Tin</a>" (1999) and who is 20 years his junior. The marriage became known for the couple's eccentric displays of affection, which reportedly included wearing vials of each other's blood around their necks; Thornton later clarified that the "vials" were actually two small lockets, each containing only a single drop of blood. Thornton and Jolie announced the adoption of a child from <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a> in March 2002, but it was later revealed that Jolie had adopted the child as a single parent. They separated in June 2002 and divorced the following year.

In 2003, Thornton began a relationship with makeup effects crew member Connie Angland, with whom he has a daughter named Bella. They reside in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles, California</a>. Though he once said that he likely would not marry again, saying that he believes marriage "doesn't work" for him, his representatives confirmed that he and Angland were married on October 22, 2014 in Los Angeles.

During his early years in Los Angeles, Thornton was admitted to a <a href="hospital">hospital</a> and diagnosed with <a href="myocarditis">myocarditis</a>. He has since said that he is <a href="vegan">vegan</a> and "extremely healthy."

Thornton has <a href="obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive%20disorder">obsessive–compulsive disorder</a>. Various idiosyncratic behaviors have been well documented in interviews with Thornton; among these is a <a href="phobia">phobia</a> of antique furniture—a disorder shared by <a href="Dwight%20Yoakam">Dwight Yoakam</a>'s character Doyle Hargraves in the Thornton-penned "Sling Blade", and by Thornton's own character in the 2001 film "Bandits". Additionally, he has stated that he has a fear of certain types of <a href="cutlery">silverware</a>, a trait assumed by his character Hank Grotowski in 2001's "Monster's Ball", in which Grotowski insists on a <a href="plastic">plastic</a> <a href="spoon">spoon</a> for his daily <a href="bowl">bowl</a> of <a href="chocolate%20ice%20cream">chocolate ice cream</a>.

In a 2004 <a href="interview">interview</a> with "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", Thornton explained: "It's just that I won't use real <a href="sterling%20silver">silver</a>. You know, like the big, old, heavy-ass <a href="forks">forks</a> and <a href="knives">knives</a>, I can't do that. It's the same thing as the antique furniture. I just don't like old stuff. I'm creeped out by it, and I have no explanation why... I don't have a phobia about American antiques, it's mostly French — you know, like the big, old, gold-carved chairs with the velvet cushions. The <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a> type. That's what creeps me out. I can spot the imitation antiques a mile off. They have a different vibe. Not as much dust."

Thornton is a baseball fan; his favorite team is the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a>, and he has said that his childhood dream was to play for them. He narrated "The 2006 World Series Film", the year-end retrospective DVD chronicling the Cardinals' championship season.

The Big O

The story takes place forty years after a mysterious occurrence causes the residents of Paradigm City to lose their memories. The series follows Roger Smith, Paradigm City's top <a href="Negotiation">Negotiator</a>. He provides this "much needed service" with the help of a <a href="robot">robot</a> named R. Dorothy Wayneright and his <a href="butler">butler</a> Norman Burg. When the need arises, Roger calls upon Big O, a giant relic from the city's past.

The television series is designed as a tribute to Japanese and <a href="western%20world">Western</a> shows from the 1960s and 1970s. The series is done in the style of "<a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>" and combines the feel of a <a href="detective%20fiction">detective show</a> with the <a href="mecha%20anime">mecha genre</a> of anime. The <a href="setpiece">setpiece</a>s are reminiscent of <a href="tokusatsu">tokusatsu</a> productions of the 1950s and 1960s, particularly <a href="Toho">Toho</a>'s <a href="kaiju">kaiju</a> movies, and the score is an eclectic mix of styles and musical homages.

"The Big O" premiered October 13, 1999 on <a href="WOWOW">WOWOW</a> satellite television. It finished its run on January 19, 2000. The English-language version premiered on <a href="Cartoon%20Network">Cartoon Network</a> on April 2, 2001 and ended on April 18, 2001. Originally planned as a 26 episode series, low viewership in Japan reduced production to the first 13. Positive international reception resulted in a second season consisting of the remaining 13 episodes; co-produced by Cartoon Network, Sunrise, and <a href="Bandai%20Visual">Bandai Visual</a>. Season two premiered on Japan's <a href="Sun%20Television">SUN-TV</a> on January 2, 2003, and the American <a href="premiere">premiere</a> took place seven months later. Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment by parent company <a href="Bandai">Bandai</a> (owned by <a href="Bandai%20Namco%20Holdings">Bandai Namco Holdings</a>) in 2012, <a href="Sunrise%20%28company%29">Sunrise</a> announced at <a href="Otakon">Otakon</a> 2013 that <a href="Sentai%20Filmworks">Sentai Filmworks</a> rescued both seasons of "The Big O".

"The Big O" is set in the fictional <a href="city-state">city-state</a> of . The city is located on a seacoast and is surrounded by a vast desert wasteland. The partially <a href="geodesic%20dome">domed</a> city is wholly controlled by the monopolistic <a href="Megacorporation">Paradigm Corporation</a>, resulting in a corporate <a href="police%20state">police state</a>. Paradigm is known as because forty years prior to the story, " destroyed the world outside the city and left the survivors without any prior memories.

The city is characterized by severe class inequity; the higher-income population resides inside the more pleasant domes, with the remainder left in tenements outside. <a href="Android%20%28robot%29">Androids</a> coexist with the human inhabitants of Paradigm City; while they are rare, they are sufficiently numerous that denizens of the city do not consider them unusual.

Several episodes show inhabitants of Paradigm City practicing some form of <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>: people congregate in meeting places with crucifixes prominently displayed. The practice appears to be based on custom, because no one clearly remembers any doctrine associated with the practice. A ruined cathedral remains unused, although some elderly people occasionally stand in front of it and sing incompletely remembered hymns. In episode 11, it appears that only <a href="List%20of%20The%20Big%20O%20characters%23Alex%20Rosewater">Alex Rosewater</a>, <a href="CEO">CEO</a> of the Paradigm Corporation that runs the city, remembers or observes <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a>. A holiday commemorating the founding of Paradigm City, "Heaven's Day", is observed on December 25. Though citizens decorate with generic Christmas decorations, they are ignorant of their original meaning. Dastun mentions that Rosewater had in his possession fragments of a "<a href="Book%20of%20Revelation">Book of Revelation</a>", although neither Dastun nor Roger had heard of it before.

Although the textbook definition of <a href="memory">memory</a> is a record stored in the brain of an organism, the citizens of Paradigm City use the term more loosely; can refer to forgotten knowledge, records or artifacts from before The Event, or partial forms of recollection including <a href="hallucination">hallucination</a>s and <a href="recurring%20dream">recurring dream</a>s.

The first season is episodic. Each episode (referred to as an "Act") relates a separate instance the resurgence of lost "memories" and how the citizens cope with their collective amnesia. The final episodes introduce elements that come into play during season two, like the discovery of people living outside of Paradigm City, the true nature of the Event, and something obliquely described as "the Power of God wielded by the hand of man".

While the majority of the first season's episodes are self-contained stories, the second season comprises a single serialized <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a>. <a href="Alex%20Rosewater">Alex Rosewater</a> becomes a direct <a href="antagonist">antagonist</a> to Roger, and a mysterious group known as "The Union" is introduced, containing agents of a foreign power working within the City.

The series ends with the awakening of a new <a href="megadeus">megadeus</a>, and the revelation that the world is a <a href="simulated%20reality">simulated reality</a>. A climactic battle ensues between Big O and Big Fau, after which reality is systematically erased by the new megadeus, an incarnation of Angel, recognised as "Big Venus" by Dorothy. Roger implores Angel to "let go of the past" regardless of its existential reality, and focus only on the present and the future. In an isolated control room, the real Angel observes Roger and her past encounters with him on a series of television monitors. On the control panel lies "Metropolis", a book featured prominently since the thirteenth episode, with the cover featuring an illustration of angel wings and gives the author's name as "Angel Rosewater". Big Venus and Big O physically merge, causing the virtual reality to reset. A white flash subsides, and the first scenes of the first episode of the series play out. New versions of Dorothy and Angel watch Roger drive down the street as he delivers again his first speech of the series ("My name is Roger Smith. I perform a much needed job here in the City of Amnesia"), although he is a little hesitant this time. The ending title card, "We have come to terms," appears, and the credits roll.

Development of the <a href="retro">retro</a>-styled series began in 1996. <a href="Keiichi%20Sato">Keiichi Sato</a> came up with the concept of "The Big O": a giant city-smashing robot, piloted by a man in black, in a <a href="Gotham%20City">Gotham</a>-like environment. He later met up with Kazuyoshi Katayama, who had just finished directing "<a href="Those%20Who%20Hunt%20Elves">Those Who Hunt Elves</a>", and started work on the layouts and character designs. But when things "were about to really start moving," production on Katayama's "<a href="Sentimental%20Journey%20%28anime%29">Sentimental Journey</a>" began, putting plans on-hold. Meanwhile, Sato was heavily involved with his work on "<a href="City%20Hunter">City Hunter</a>".

Sato admits it all started as "a gimmick for a toy" but the representatives at Bandai Hobby Division did not see the same <a href="toyetic">potential</a>. From there on, the dealings would be with <a href="Bandai%20Visual">Bandai Visual</a>, but <a href="Sunrise%20%28company%29">Sunrise</a> still needed some safeguards and requested more robots be designed to increase prospective toy sales. In 1999, with the designs complete, <a href="Chiaki%20J.%20Konaka">Chiaki J. Konaka</a> was brought on as head writer. Among other things, Konaka came up with the idea of "a town without memory" and his writing staff put together the outline for a 26-episodes series.

"The Big O" premiered on 13 October 1999 on <a href="WOWOW">WOWOW</a>. When the production staff was informed the series would be shortened to 13 episodes, the writers decided to end it with a <a href="cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a>, hoping the next 13 episodes would be picked up. In April 2001, "The Big O" premiered on <a href="Cartoon%20Network">Cartoon Network</a>'s <a href="Toonami">Toonami</a> lineup.

The series garnered positive fan response internationally that resulted in a second season co-produced by <a href="Cartoon%20Network%20Studios">Cartoon Network Studios</a> and Sunrise. Season two premiered on Japan's <a href="Sun%20Television">SUN-TV</a> on January 2003, with the American premiere taking place seven months later as an <a href="Adult%20Swim">Adult Swim</a> exclusive. The second season would not be seen on Toonami until July 27, 2013, 10 years after it began airing on Adult Swim.

The second season was scripted by Chiaki Konaka with input from the American producers. Along with the 13 episodes of season two, Cartoon Network had an <a href="Option%20%28films%29">option</a> for 26 additional episodes to be written by Konaka, but according to Jason DeMarco, executive producer for season two, the middling ratings and DVD sales in the United States and Japan made any further episodes impossible to be produced.

Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment by parent company in 2012, <a href="Sunrise%20%28company%29">Sunrise</a> announced at <a href="Otakon">Otakon</a> 2013 that <a href="Sentai%20Filmworks">Sentai Filmworks</a> rescued both seasons of "The Big O". On June 20, 2017, Sentai Filmworks released both seasons on Blu-ray.

"The Big O" was scored by "<a href="Geidai">Geidai</a>" alumnus <a href="Toshihiko%20Sahashi">Toshihiko Sahashi</a>. His composition is richly symphonic and <a href="classical%20music">classical</a>, with a number of pieces delving into <a href="electronica">electronica</a> and <a href="jazz">jazz</a>. Chosen because of his "frightening amount of musical knowledge about TV dramas overseas," Sahashi integrates musical homages into the soundtrack. The background music draws from "<a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>", <a href="spy%20film">spy film</a>s and <a href="sci-fi">sci-fi</a> television series like "<a href="The%20Twilight%20Zone%20%281959%20TV%20series%29">The Twilight Zone</a>". The battle themes are reminiscent of <a href="Akira%20Ifukube">Akira Ifukube</a>'s compositions for the "<a href="Godzilla">Godzilla</a>" series.

The first opening theme is the <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a>-influenced "Big-O!". Composed, arranged and performed by Rui Nagai, the song resembles <a href="Flash%20%28song%29">the theme</a> to the "<a href="Flash%20Gordon%20%28film%29">Flash Gordon</a>" film. The second opening theme is "Respect," composed by Sahashi. The track is an homage to the music of <a href="Gerry%20Anderson">Gerry Anderson</a>'s "<a href="UFO%20%28TV%20series%29">UFO</a>", composed by <a href="Barry%20Gray">Barry Gray</a>. In 2007, Rui Nagai composed "Big-O! Show Must Go On," a 1960s <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> piece, for <a href="Animax">Animax</a>'s reruns of the show. The closing theme is the slow love ballad "And Forever..." written by Chie and composed by Ken Shima. The duet is performed by Robbie Danzie and Naoki Takao.

Along with Sahashi's original compositions, the soundtrack features <a href="Chopin">Chopin</a>'s <a href="Preludes%20%28Chopin%29">Prelude</a> No. 15 and a jazz saxophone rendition of "<a href="Jingle%20Bells">Jingle Bells</a>." The complete score was released in two volumes by <a href="Victor%20Entertainment">Victor Entertainment</a>.

"The Big O" was conceived as a <a href="media%20franchise">media franchise</a>. To this effect, <a href="Hajime%20Yatate">Sunrise</a> requested a manga be produced along with the animated series. "The Big O" manga started serialization in <a href="Kodansha">Kodansha</a>'s "<a href="Magazine%20Z">Magazine Z</a>" on July 1999, three months before the anime premiere. Authored by Hitoshi Ariga, the manga uses Keiichi Sato's concept designs in an all-new story. The series ended on October 2001. The issues were later collected in six <a href="tank%C5%8Dbon">volumes</a>. The English version of the manga is published by <a href="Viz%20Media">Viz Media</a>.

In anticipation to the broadcast of the second season, a new manga series was published. , authored by Hitoshi Ariga. "Lost Memory" takes place between volumes five and six of the original manga. The issues were serialized in "Magazine Z" from November 2002 to September 2003 and were collected in two volumes.

, a novel by Yuki Taniguchi, was released 16 July 2003 by <a href="Tokuma%20Shoten">Tokuma Shoten</a>.

"The Big O" is the brainchild of Keiichi Sato and Kazuyoshi Katayama, an <a href="Homage%20%28arts%29">homage</a> to the shows they grew up with. The show references the works of the <a href="Toei%20Superheroes">superhero shows</a> produced by the <a href="Toei%20Company">Toei Company</a> and "<a href="wikt%3Aold%20school">old school</a>" <a href="super%20robot">super robot</a>s. The series is done in the style of "<a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>" and <a href="Pulp%20magazine">pulp fiction</a> and combines the feel of a detective show with the <a href="mecha%20anime">giant robot</a> genre.

"<a href="Film%20noir">Film noir</a>" is a stylistic approach to genre films forged in <a href="Great%20Depression">Depression</a>-era detective and gangster films and <a href="hard-boiled">hard-boiled</a> <a href="detective%20stories">detective stories</a> which were a staple of <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp fiction</a>. "The Big O" shares much of its themes, diction, archetypes and visual iconography with "film noirs" of the 1940s like "<a href="The%20Big%20Sleep%20%281946%20film%29">The Big Sleep</a>" (1946).
<a href="Low-key%20lighting">Low-key lighting</a> schemes mark most "noirs". The series incorporates the use of long dark shadows in the tradition of "<a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a>" and <a href="tenebrism">tenebrism</a>. "Film noir" is also known for its use of odd angles, such as Roger's <a href="low-angle%20shot">low shot</a> introduction in the first episode. "Noir" cinematographers favoured this angle because it made characters almost rise from the ground, giving them dramatic girth and symbolic overtones. Other disorientating devices like <a href="dutch%20angle">dutch angle</a>s, mirror reflection and distorting shots are employed throughout the series.

The <a href="List%20of%20The%20Big%20O%20characters">characters of "The Big O"</a> fit the "noir" and pulp fiction <a href="archetype">archetype</a>s. Roger Smith is a protagonist in the mold of <a href="Raymond%20Chandler">Chandler</a>'s <a href="Philip%20Marlowe">Philip Marlowe</a> or <a href="Dashiell%20Hammett">Hammett</a>'s <a href="Sam%20Spade">Sam Spade</a>. He is canny and cynical, a disillusioned cop-turned-<a href="Negotiation">negotiator</a> whose job has more in common with detective-style work than negotiating. Big Ear is Roger's street informant and Dan Dastun is the friend on the police force. The recurring Beck is the imaginative thug compelled by delusions of grandeur while Angel fills the role of the "<a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a>". Minor characters include crooked cops, corrupt business men and deranged scientists.

"Noir" characters often wisecrack and speak in <a href="double%20entendre">double entendre</a>s. The dialogue in the series is recognized for its witty, wry sense of humor. The characters come off as charming and exchange banter not often heard in anime series, as the dialogue has the tendency to be straightforward. The plot is moved along by Roger's <a href="voice-over">voice-over</a> <a href="First-person%20narrative">narration</a>, a device used in "film noir" to place the viewer in the mind of the protagonist so it can intimately experience the character's angst and partly identify with the narrator.

The urban landscape, <a href="Paradigm%20City">Paradigm City</a>, is the perfect "noir" milieu. The tall buildings and giant domes create a sense of <a href="claustrophobia">claustrophobia</a> and <a href="paranoia">paranoia</a> characteristic of the style. The rural landscape, Ailesberry Farm, contrasts Paradigm City. "Noir" protagonists often look for sanctuary in such settings but they just as likely end up becoming a killing ground. The series score is representative of its setting. While no classic "noir" possesses a <a href="jazz">jazz</a> score, the music could be heard in nightclubs within the films. Roger's recurring theme, a lone saxophone accompaniment to the protagonist's narration, best exemplifies the "noir" stylings of the series.

<a href="Amnesia">Amnesia</a> is a common <a href="plot%20device">plot device</a> in "film noir". Because most of these stories focused on a character proving his innocence, authors up the ante by making him an amnesiac, unable to prove his innocence even to himself. "The Big O" goes further, by removing the memories of the whole population. The convoluted past is told through the use of <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashbacks</a>. In most "noirs", the past is tangible and menacing. The characters are often trying to escape some trauma or crime tied to the Event, and confronting it becomes their only chance at redemption.

Before "The Big O", <a href="Sunrise%20Studios">Sunrise Studios</a> was a subcontractor for <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Animation">Warner Bros. Animation</a>'s "", one of the series' influences.

Roger Smith is a <a href="pastiche">pastiche</a> of the <a href="Bruce%20Wayne">Bruce Wayne</a> <a href="persona">persona</a> and the Batman. The character design resembles Wayne, complete with slicked-back hair and double-breasted business suit. Like Bruce, Roger prides himself in being a rich playboy to the extent that one of his household's rules is only women may be let into his mansion without his permission. Like Batman, Roger Smith carries a no-gun policy, albeit more flexible. Unlike the personal motives of the Batman, Roger enforces this rule for "it's all part of being a gentleman." Among Roger's gadgetry is the Griffon, a large, black hi-tech <a href="sedan%20%28car%29">sedan</a> comparable to the <a href="Batmobile">Batmobile</a>, a grappling cable that shoots out his wristwatch and the giant robot that Angel calls "Roger's <a href="alter%20ego">alter ego</a>."

"The Big O"'s cast of <a href="supporting%20character">supporting character</a>s includes Norman, Roger's faithful mechanically-inclined butler who fills the role of <a href="Alfred%20Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a>; R. Dorothy Wayneright, who plays the role of the sidekick; and Dan Dastun, a good honest cop who, like <a href="James%20Gordon%20%28comics%29">Jim Gordon</a>, is both a friend to the hero and greatly respected by his comrades.

The other major influence is <a href="Mitsuteru%20Yokoyama">Mitsuteru Yokoyama</a>'s "<a href="Giant%20Robo">Giant Robo</a>". Before working on "The Big O", Kazuyoshi Katayama and other animators worked with <a href="Yasuhiro%20Imagawa">Yasuhiro Imagawa</a> on "". The feature, a "<a href="retro">retro</a> <a href="chic%20%28style%29">chic</a>" homage to Yokoyama's career, took seven years to produce and suffered low sales and high running costs. Frustrated by the experience, Katayama and his staff put all their efforts into making "good" with "The Big O".

Like Giant Robo, the <a href="megadeus">megadeus</a>es of "Big O" are metal behemoths. The designs are strange and "more macho than practical," sporting big stovepipe arms and exposed rivets. Unlike the giants of other mecha series, the megadeuses do not exhibit ninja-like speed nor grace. Instead, the robots are armed with "old school" weaponry such as <a href="missile">missile</a>s, <a href="piston">piston</a> powered punches, <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s and <a href="laser">laser</a> <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s.

Katayama also cited "<a href="Super%20Robot%20Red%20Baron">Super Robot Red Baron</a>" and "<a href="Super%20Robot%20Mach%20Baron">Super Robot Mach Baron</a>" among influences on the inspiration of "The Big O". Believing that because "Red Baron" had such a low budget and the big fights always happened outside of a city setting, he wanted "Big O" to be the show he felt "Red Baron" could be with a bigger budget. He also spoke of how he first came up with designs for the robots first as if they were making designs to appeal to toy companies, rather than how "<a href="Gundam">Gundam</a>" was created with a toy company wanting an anime to represent their new product. Big O's large pumping piston "Sudden Impact" arms, for example, he felt would be cool gimmicks in a toy.

"The Big O Visual: The official companion to the TV series" () was published by Futabasha in 2003. The book contains full-color artwork, character bios and <a href="concept%20art">concept art</a>, mecha sketches, video/LD/DVD jacket illustrations, history on the making of The Big O, staff interviews, "Roger's Monologues" comic strip and the original script for the final episode of the series.

"Walking Together On The Yellow Brick Road" was released by <a href="Victor%20Entertainment">Victor Entertainment</a> on 21 September 2000. The <a href="drama%20CD">drama CD</a> was written by series head writer <a href="Chiaki%20J.%20Konaka">Chiaki J. Konaka</a> and featured the series' voice cast. An English translation, written by English dub translator David Fleming, was posted on Konaka's website.

The first season of Big O is featured in "<a href="Super%20Robot%20Wars%20D">Super Robot Wars D</a>" for the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a>. The series, including its second season is also featured in Super Robot Wars Z, released in 2008.

<a href="Bandai">Bandai</a> released a non-scale model kit of Big O in 2000. Though it was an easy snap-together kit, it required painting, as all of the parts (except the clear orange crown and canopy) were molded in dark gray. The kit included springs that enabled the slide-action Side Piles on the forearms to simulate Big O's Sudden Impact maneuver. Also included was an unpainted Roger Smith figure.

<a href="Polyvinyl%20chloride">PVC</a> figures of Big O and Big Duo (Schwarzwald's Megadeus) were sold by Bandai America. Each came with non-poseable figures of Roger, Dorothy and Angel. Mini-figure sets were sold in Japan and America during the run of the second season. The characters included Big O (standard and attack modes), Roger, Dorothy & Norman, Griffon (Roger's car), Dorothy-1 (Big O's first opponent), Schwarzwald and Big Duo.

In 2009, Bandai released a plastic/diecast figure of the Big O under their <a href="Soul%20of%20Chogokin">Soul of Chogokin</a> line. The figure has the same features as the model kit, but with added detail and accessories. Its design was closely supervised by original designer Keiichi Sato.

In 2011, Max Factory released action figures of Roger and Dorothy through their <a href="Figma">Figma</a> toyline. Like most Figmas, they are very detailed, articulated and come with accessories and interchangeable faces. In the same year, Max Factory also released a 12-inch, diecast figure of Big O under their Max Gokin line. The figure contained most of the accessories as the Soul of Chogokin figure but also included some others that could be bought separately from the SOC figure, such as the Mobydick (hip) Anchors and Roger Smith's car: the Griffon. Like the Soul of Chogokin figure, its design was also supervised by Keiichi Sato. As well, in that same year, Max Factory released soft vinyl figures of Big Duo and Big Fau, in-scale with the Max Gokin Big O. These figures are high in detail but limited in articulation, such as the arms and legs being the only things to move. To date, this is the only action figure of Big Fau.

"The Big O" premiered on 13 October 1999. The show was not a hit in its native Japan, rather it was reduced from an outlined 26 episodes to 13 episodes. Western audiences were more receptive and the series achieved the success its creators were looking for. In an interview with <a href="AnimePlay">AnimePlay</a>, Keiichi Sato said "This is exactly as we had planned", referring to the success overseas.

Several words appear constantly in the English-language reviews; adjectives like "hip", "sleek," "stylish",

The first season's reception was positive. Anime on DVD recommends it as an essential series. Chris Beveridge of the aforementioned site gave an A- to Vols. 1 and 2, and a B+ to Vols. 3 and 4. Mike Toole of Anime Jump gave it 4.5 (out of a possible 5) stars, while the review at the Anime Academy gave it a grade of 83, listing the series' high points as being "unique", the characters "interesting," and the action "nice." Reviewers, and fans alike, agree the season's downfall was the ending, or its lack thereof. The dangling plot threads frustrated the viewers and prompted Cartoon Network's involvement in the production of further episodes.

The look and feel of the show received a big enhancement in the second season. This time around, the animation is "near <a href="OVA">OVA</a> quality" and the artwork "far more lush and detailed." Also enhanced are the troubles of the first season. The giant robot battles still seem out of place to some, while others praise the "over-the-top-ness" of their execution.

For some reviewers, the second season "doesn't quite match the first" addressing to "something" missing in these episodes. Andy Patrizio of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> points out changes in Roger Smith's character, who "lost some of his cool and his very funny side in the second season." Like a repeat of season one, this season's ending is considered its downfall. Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD wonders if this was head writer "Konaka's attempt to throw his hat into the ring for creating one of the most confusing and oblique endings of any series." Patrizio states "the creators watched "<a href="The%20Truman%20Show">The Truman Show</a>" and "<a href="The%20Matrix">The Matrix</a>" a few times too many."

The series continues to have a strong cult following into the 2010s. In 2014 <a href="BuzzFeed">BuzzFeed</a> writer Ryan Broderick ranked "The Big O" as one of the best anime series to binge-watch. Dan Casey host of <a href="Nerdist%20Industries">The Nerdist's</a> "Dan Cave" stated "The Big O" was the anime series he was most eager to see rebooted or remade, along with "<a href="Trigun">Trigun</a>" and "<a href="Soul%20Eater%20%28manga%29">Soul Eater</a>".

BIOS

For <a href="IBM%20PC%20compatible">IBM PC compatible</a> computers, BIOS ( , an acronym for Basic Input/Output System and also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS or PC BIOS) is non-volatile <a href="firmware">firmware</a> used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup), and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on a <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>'s system board, and it is the first software run when powered on. The name originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> operating system in 1975. Originally <a href="Proprietary%20software">proprietary</a> to the IBM PC, the BIOS has been <a href="reverse%20engineer">reverse engineer</a>ed by companies looking to create compatible systems. The <a href="Interface%20%28computing%29">interface</a> of that original system serves as a "<a href="De%20facto%20standard">de facto</a>" standard.

The BIOS in modern PCs initializes and tests the system hardware components, and loads a <a href="boot%20loader">boot loader</a> or an <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a> from a mass memory device. In the era of <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>, the BIOS provided a <a href="hardware%20abstraction%20layer">hardware abstraction layer</a> for the keyboard, display, and other <a href="input/output">input/output</a> (I/O) devices that standardized an interface to application programs and the operating system. More recent operating systems do not use the BIOS after loading, instead accessing the hardware components directly.

Most BIOS implementations are specifically designed to work with a particular computer or <a href="motherboard">motherboard</a> model, by interfacing with various devices that make up the complementary system <a href="chipset">chipset</a>. Originally, BIOS firmware was stored in a <a href="Read-only%20memory">ROM</a> chip on the PC motherboard. In modern computer systems, the BIOS contents are stored on <a href="flash%20memory">flash memory</a> so it can be rewritten without removing the chip from the motherboard. This allows easy, end-user updates to the BIOS firmware so new features can be added or bugs can be fixed, but it also creates a possibility for the computer to become infected with BIOS <a href="rootkit">rootkit</a>s. Furthermore, a BIOS upgrade that fails can <a href="brick%20%28electronics%29">brick</a> the motherboard permanently, unless the system includes some form of backup for this case. 

<a href="Unified%20Extensible%20Firmware%20Interface">Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</a> (UEFI) is the successor to BIOS, aiming to address its technical shortcomings.

The term BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) was invented by <a href="Gary%20Kildall">Gary Kildall</a> and first appeared in the <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> operating system in 1975, describing the machine-specific part of CP/M loaded during boot time that interfaces directly with the <a href="computer%20hardware">hardware</a>. (A CP/M machine usually has only a simple <a href="boot%20loader">boot loader</a> in its ROM.)

Versions of <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>, <a href="PC%20DOS">PC DOS</a> or <a href="DR-DOS">DR-DOS</a> contain a file called variously "<a href="IO.SYS">IO.SYS</a>", "<a href="IBMBIO.COM">IBMBIO.COM</a>", "IBMBIO.SYS", or "<a href="DRBIOS.SYS">DRBIOS.SYS</a>"; this file is known as the "<a href="DOS%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BBIOS">DOS BIOS</a>" (also known as "<a href="DOS%20I/O%20System">DOS I/O System</a>") and contains the lower-level hardware-specific part of the operating system. Together with the underlying hardware-specific, but operating system-independent "System BIOS", which resides in <a href="Read-only%20memory">ROM</a>, it represents the analogue to the "<a href="CP/M%20BIOS">CP/M BIOS</a>".

With the introduction of PS/2 machines, IBM divided the System BIOS into real-mode and protected mode portions. The real-mode portion was meant to provide backward-compatibility with existing operating systems such as DOS, and therefore was named "CBIOS" (for Compatibility BIOS), whereas the "ABIOS" (for Advanced BIOS) provided new interfaces specifically suited for multitasking operating systems such as <a href="OS/2">OS/2</a>.

The BIOS of the original <a href="IBM%20PC%20XT">IBM PC XT</a> had no interactive user interface. Error codes or messages were displayed on the screen, or coded series of sounds were generated to signal errors when the <a href="power-on%20self-test">power-on self-test</a> (POST) had not proceeded to the point of successfully initializing a video display adapter. Options on the <a href="IBM%20Personal%20Computer">IBM PC</a> and XT were set by switches and jumpers on the main board and on peripheral cards. Starting around the mid-1990s, it became typical for the BIOS ROM to include a ""BIOS configuration utility"" (BCU) or "BIOS setup utility", accessed at system power-up by a particular key sequence. This program allowed the user to set system configuration options, of the type formerly set using DIP switches, through an interactive menu system controlled through the keyboard. In the interim period, IBM-compatible PCsincluding the <a href="IBM%20Personal%20Computer/AT">IBM AT</a>held configuration settings in battery-backed RAM and used a bootable configuration program on disk, not in the ROM, to set the configuration options contained in this memory. The disk was supplied with the computer, and if it was lost the system settings could not be changed. The same applied in general to computers with an <a href="Extended%20Industry%20Standard%20Architecture">EISA</a> bus, for which the configuration program was called an EISA Configuration Utility (ECU).

A modern <a href="Wintel">Wintel</a>-compatible computer provides a setup routine essentially unchanged in nature from the ROM-resident BIOS setup utilities of the late 1990s; the user can configure hardware options using the keyboard and video display. Also, when errors occur at boot time, a modern BIOS usually displays user-friendly error messages, often presented as pop-up boxes in a <a href="Text-based%20user%20interface">TUI</a> style, and offers to enter the BIOS setup utility or to ignore the error and proceed if possible. Instead of battery-backed RAM, the modern Wintel machine may store the BIOS configuration settings in flash ROM, perhaps the same flash ROM that holds the BIOS itself.

Early Intel processors started at physical address 000FFFF0h. When a modern <a href="x86%20microprocessor">x86 microprocessor</a> is reset, it starts in pseudo <a href="16-bit">16-bit</a> <a href="real%20mode">real mode</a>, initializing most registers to zero. The code segment register is initialized with selector F000h, base FFFF0000h, and limit FFFFh, so that execution starts at 4 GB minus 16 bytes (FFFFFFF0h). The platform logic maps this address into the system ROM, mirroring address 000FFFF0h.

If the system has just been powered up or the reset button was pressed ("cold boot"), the full <a href="power-on%20self-test">power-on self-test</a> (POST) is run. If Ctrl+Alt+Delete was pressed ("warm boot"), a special flag value is stored in <a href="nonvolatile%20BIOS%20memory">nonvolatile BIOS memory</a> ("<a href="CMOS">CMOS</a>") before the processor is reset, and after the reset the BIOS startup code detects this flag and does not run the POST. This saves the time otherwise used to detect and test all memory.

The POST checks, identifies, and initializes system devices such as the <a href="central%20processing%20unit">CPU</a>, <a href="random-access%20memory">RAM</a>, <a href="programmable%20interrupt%20controller">interrupt</a> and <a href="DMA%20controller">DMA controller</a>s and other parts of the <a href="chipset">chipset</a>, <a href="video%20display%20card">video display card</a>, <a href="computer%20keyboard">keyboard</a>, <a href="hard%20disk%20drive">hard disk drive</a>, <a href="optical%20disc%20drive">optical disc drive</a> and other basic <a href="computer%20hardware">hardware</a>.

Early IBM PCs had a little-known routine in the POST that would attempt to download a maintenance program into RAM through the keyboard port before performing any other elements of the boot process, such as before scanning for option ROMs or executing a boot loader. (No <a href="serial%20port">serial</a> or <a href="parallel%20port">parallel port</a>s were standard on early IBM PCs, but a keyboard port of either the XT or AT / PS/2 type has been standard on practically every PC and clone.) If the download was apparently successful, the BIOS would verify a checksum on it and then run it. This feature was intended for factory test or diagnostic purposes; while it was of limited utility outside of factory or repair facilities, it could be used in a proprietary way to boot the PC as a satellite system to a host machine (as it was used in the manufacturing environment).

After the option ROM scan is completed and all detected ROM modules with valid checksums have been called, or immediately after POST in a BIOS version that does not scan for option ROMs, the BIOS calls INT 19h to start boot processing. Post-boot, programs loaded can also call INT 19h to reboot the system, but they must be careful to disable interrupts and other asynchronous hardware processes that may interfere with the BIOS rebooting process, or else the system may hang or crash while it is rebooting.

When INT 19h is called, the BIOS attempts to locate <a href="boot%20loader">boot loader</a> software held on a storage device designated as a "boot device", such as a <a href="hard%20disk">hard disk</a>, a <a href="floppy%20disk">floppy disk</a>, <a href="CD">CD</a>, or <a href="DVD">DVD</a>. It loads and executes the first boot software it finds, giving it control of the PC. This is the process that is known as "<a href="booting">booting</a>" (sometimes informally called "booting up"), which is short for "bootstrapping".

The BIOS selects candidate boot devices using information collected by POST and configuration information from <a href="EEPROM">EEPROM</a>, CMOS RAM or, in the earliest PCs, <a href="DIP%20switch">DIP switch</a>es. Following the boot priority sequence in effect, BIOS checks each device in order to see if it is bootable. For a disk drive or a device that logically emulates a disk drive, such as a <a href="USB%20flash%20drive">USB flash drive</a> or perhaps a tape drive, to perform this check the BIOS attempts to load the first sector (<a href="boot%20sector">boot sector</a>) from the disk into RAM at memory address codice_1. If the sector cannot be read (due to a missing or unformatted disk, or due to a hardware failure), the BIOS considers the device unbootable and proceeds to check the next device. If the sector is read successfully, some BIOSes will also check for the boot sector signature 0x55 0xAA in the last two bytes of the sector (which is 512 bytes long), before accepting a boot sector and considering the device bootable.

The BIOS proceeds to test each device sequentially until a bootable device is found, at which time the BIOS transfers control to the loaded sector with a jump instruction to its first byte at address codice_1 (exactly 1 KiB below the 32 KiB mark); see <a href="MBR%20invocation">MBR invocation</a> and <a href="VBR%20invocation">VBR invocation</a>. (This location is one reason that an IBM PC requires at least 32 KiB of RAM in order to be equipped with a disk system; with 31 KiB or less, it would be impossible to boot from any disk, removable or fixed, using the BIOS boot protocol.) Most, but not all, BIOSes load the drive number (as used by INT 13h) of the boot drive into CPU register DL before jumping to the first byte of the loaded boot sector.

Note well that the BIOS does not interpret or process the contents of the boot sector other than to possibly check for the boot sector signature in the last two bytes; all interpretation of data structures like MBR partition tables and so-called BIOS Parameter Blocks is done by the boot program in the boot sector itself or by other programs loaded through the boot process and is beyond the scope of BIOS. Nothing about BIOS predicates these data structures or impedes their replacement or improvement.

A non-disk device such as a <a href="network%20adapter">network adapter</a> attempts booting by a procedure that is defined by its <a href="option%20ROM">option ROM</a> or the equivalent integrated into the motherboard BIOS ROM. As such, option ROMs may also influence or supplant the boot process defined by the motherboard BIOS ROM.

The user can control the boot process, to cause one medium to be booted instead of another when two or more bootable media are present, by taking advantage of the boot priority implemented by the BIOS. For example, most computers have a hard disk that is bootable, but usually there is a removable-media drive that has higher boot priority, so the user can cause a removable disk to be booted, simply by inserting it, without removing the hard disk drive or altering its contents to make it unbootable.

In most modern BIOSes, the boot priority order of all potentially bootable devices can be freely configured by the user through the BIOS configuration utility. In older BIOSes, limited boot priority options are selectable; in the earliest BIOSes, a fixed priority scheme was implemented, with floppy disk drives first, fixed disks (i.e. hard disks) second, and typically no other boot devices supported, subject to modification of these rules by installed option ROMs. The BIOS in an early PC also usually would only boot from the first floppy disk drive or the first hard disk drive, even if there were two drives of either type installed. All more advanced boot priority sequences evolved as incremental improvements on this basic system.

Historically the BIOS would try to boot from a floppy drive first and a hard disk second. The default for CD or DVD booting is an extension of this. With the <a href="El%20Torito%20%28CD-ROM%20standard%29">El Torito optical media boot standard</a>, the optical drive actually emulates a 3.5" high-density floppy disk to the BIOS for boot purposes. Optical disks are a special case, because their lowest level of data organization is typically a fairly high-level file system (e.g. <a href="ISO%209660">ISO 9660</a> for CD-ROM).

Reading the "first sector" of a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM is not a simply defined operation like it is on a floppy disk or a hard disk. Furthermore, the complexity of the medium makes it difficult to write a useful boot program in one sector, even though optical media sectors are typically 2048 bytes each, four times the standard 512-byte size of floppy and legacy hard disk sectors. Therefore, optical media booting uses the El Torito standard, which specifies a way for an optical disk to contain an image of a high-density (1.44 MB) floppy disk and for the drive to provide access to this disk image in a simple manner that emulates floppy disk drive operations. Therefore, CD-ROM drives boot as emulated floppy disk drives; the bootable virtual floppy disk can contain software that provides access to the optical medium in its native format.

The behavior if the BIOS does not find a bootable device has varied as <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s developed. The original <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a> and XT had <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> <a href="Cassette%20BASIC">Cassette BASIC</a> in ROM, and if no bootable device was found, <a href="IBM%20BASIC">ROM BASIC</a> was started by calling INT 18h. Therefore, barring a hardware failure, an original IBM PC or XT would never fail to boot, either into <a href="IBM%20BASIC">BASIC</a> or from disk (or through an option ROM). One model of the original IBM PC was available with no disk drive; a <a href="cassette%20recorder">cassette recorder</a> could be attached via the cassette port on the rear, for loading and saving BASIC programs to tape. Since few programs used BASIC in ROM, clone PC makers left it out; then a computer that failed to boot from a disk would display "No ROM BASIC" and halt (in response to INT 18h).

Later computers would display a message like "No bootable disk found"; some would prompt for a disk to be inserted and a key to be pressed, and when a key was pressed they would restart the boot process. A modern BIOS may display nothing or may automatically enter the BIOS configuration utility when the boot process fails. Unlike earlier BIOSes, modern versions are often written with the assumption that if the computer cannot be booted from a hard disk, the user will not have software that they want to boot from removable media instead. (Lately, typically it will only be a specialist computer technician who does that, only to get the computer back into a condition where it can be booted from the hard disk.)

The environment for the boot program is very simple: the CPU is in real mode and the general-purpose and segment registers are undefined, except CS, SS, SP, and DL. CS is always zero and IP is initially codice_3. Because boot programs are always loaded at this fixed address, there is no need or motivation for a boot program to be relocatable. DL contains the drive number, as used with INT 13h, of the boot device, unless the BIOS is one that does not set the drive number in DL and then DL is undefined. SS:SP points to a valid stack that is presumably large enough to support hardware interrupts, but otherwise SS and SP are undefined. (A stack must be already set up in order for interrupts to be serviced, and interrupts must be enabled in order for the system timer-tick interrupt, which BIOS always uses at least to maintain the time-of-day count and which it initializes during POST, to be active and for the keyboard to work. The keyboard works even if the BIOS keyboard service is not called; keystrokes are received and placed in the 15-character type-ahead buffer maintained by BIOS.) The boot program must set up its own stack (or at least MS-DOS 6 acts like it must), because the size of the stack set up by BIOS is unknown and its location is likewise variable; although the boot program can investigate the default stack by examining SS:SP, it is easier and shorter to just unconditionally set up a new stack.

At boot time, all BIOS services are available, and the memory below address codice_4 contains the <a href="interrupt%20vector%20table">interrupt vector table</a>. BIOS POST has initialized the system timers 8253 or 8254 IC), interrupt controller(s), DMA controller(s), and other motherboard/chipset hardware as necessary to bring all BIOS services to ready status. DRAM refresh for all system DRAM in conventional memory and extended memory, but not necessarily expanded memory, has been set up and is running. The <a href="interrupt%20vector">interrupt vector</a>s corresponding to the BIOS interrupts have been set to point at the appropriate entry points in the BIOS, hardware interrupt vectors for devices initialized by the BIOS have been set to point to the BIOS-provided ISRs, and some other interrupts, including ones that BIOS generates for programs to hook, have been set to a default dummy ISR that immediately returns. The BIOS maintains a reserved block of system RAM at addresses codice_5 with various parameters initialized during the POST. All memory at and above address codice_6 can be used by the boot program; it may even overwrite itself.

Peripheral cards such as some hard disk drive controllers and some video display adapters have their own BIOS extension <a href="option%20ROM">option ROM</a>s, which provide additional functionality to BIOS. Code in these extensions runs before the BIOS boots the system from <a href="mass%20storage">mass storage</a>. These ROMs typically test and initialize hardware, add new BIOS services, and augment or replace existing BIOS services with their own versions of those services. For example, a <a href="SCSI%20controller">SCSI controller</a> usually has a BIOS extension ROM that adds support for hard drives connected through that controller. Some video cards have extension ROMs that replace the video services of the motherboard BIOS with their own video services. BIOS extension ROMs gain total control of the machine, so they can in fact do anything, and they may never return control to the BIOS that invoked them. An extension ROM could in principle contain an entire operating system or an application program, or it could implement an entirely different boot process such as booting from a network. Operation of an IBM-compatible computer system can be completely changed by removing or inserting an adapter card (or a ROM chip) that contains a BIOS extension ROM.

The motherboard BIOS typically contains code to access hardware components necessary for bootstrapping the system, such as the keyboard, display, and storage. In addition, plug-in adapter cards such as <a href="SCSI">SCSI</a>, <a href="RAID">RAID</a>, <a href="network%20interface%20card">network interface card</a>s, and video boards often include their own BIOS (e.g. <a href="Video%20BIOS">Video BIOS</a>), complementing or replacing the system BIOS code for the given component. Even devices built into the motherboard can behave in this way; their option ROMs can be stored as separate code on the main BIOS <a href="flash%20chip">flash chip</a>, and upgraded either in tandem with, or separately from, the main BIOS.

An add-in card requires an option ROM if the card is not supported by the main BIOS and the card needs to be initialized or made accessible through BIOS services before the operating system can be loaded (usually this means it is required in the bootstrapping process). Even when it is not required, an option ROM can allow an adapter card to be used without loading driver software from a storage device after booting begins with an option ROM, no time is taken to load the driver, the driver does not take up space in RAM nor on hard disk, and the driver software on the ROM always stays with the device so the two cannot be accidentally separated. Also, if the ROM is on the card, both the peripheral hardware and the driver software provided by the ROM are installed together with no extra effort to install the software. An additional advantage of ROM on some early PC systems (notably including the IBM PCjr) was that ROM was faster than main system RAM. (On modern systems, the case is very much the reverse of this, and BIOS ROM code is usually copied ("shadowed") into RAM so it will run faster.)

There are many methods and utilities for examining the contents of various motherboard BIOS and expansion ROMs, such as Microsoft <a href="DEBUG%20%28DOS%20Command%29">DEBUG</a> or the Unix <a href="dd%20%28Unix%29">dd</a>.

If an expansion ROM wishes to change the way the system boots (such as from a network device or a SCSI adapter for which the BIOS has no driver code) in a cooperative way, it can use the "BIOS Boot Specification" (BBS) <a href="application%20programming%20interface">API</a> to register its ability to do so. Once the expansion ROMs have registered using the BBS APIs, the user can select among the available boot options from within the BIOS's user interface. This is why most BBS compliant PC BIOS implementations will not allow the user to enter the BIOS's user interface until the expansion ROMs have finished executing and registering themselves with the BBS API. The specification can be downloaded from the ACPICA website. The official title is BIOS Boot Specification (Version 1.01, 11 January 1996).

Also, if an expansion ROM wishes to change the way the system boots unilaterally, it can simply hook INT 19h or other interrupts normally called from interrupt 19h, such as INT 13h, the BIOS disk service, to intercept the BIOS boot process. Then it can replace the BIOS boot process with one of its own, or it can merely modify the boot sequence by inserting its own boot actions into it, by preventing the BIOS from detecting certain devices as bootable, or both. Before the BIOS Boot Specification was promulgated, this was the only way for expansion ROMs to implement boot capability for devices not supported for booting by the native BIOS of the motherboard.

After the motherboard BIOS completes its POST, most BIOS versions search for option ROM modules, also called BIOS extension ROMs, and execute them. The motherboard BIOS scans for extension ROMs in a portion of the "<a href="upper%20memory%20area">upper memory area</a>" (the part of the x86 real-mode address space at and above address 0xA0000) and runs each ROM found, in order. To discover memory-mapped <a href="Industry%20Standard%20Architecture">ISA</a> option ROMs, a BIOS implementation scans the real-mode address space from codice_7 to codice_8 on 2 <a href="KiB">KiB</a> boundaries, looking for a two-byte ROM "signature": 0x55 followed by 0xAA. In a valid expansion ROM, this signature is followed by a single byte indicating the number of 512-byte blocks the expansion ROM occupies in real memory, and the next byte is the option ROM's <a href="entry%20point">entry point</a> (also known as its "entry offset"). A <a href="checksum">checksum</a> of the specified number of 512-byte blocks is calculated, and if the ROM has a valid checksum, the BIOS transfers control to the entry address, which in a normal BIOS extension ROM should be the beginning of the extension's initialization routine.

At this point, the extension ROM code takes over, typically testing and initializing the hardware it controls and registering <a href="interrupt%20vector">interrupt vector</a>s for use by post-boot applications. It may use BIOS services (including those provided by previously initialized option ROMs) to provide a user configuration interface, to display diagnostic information, or to do anything else that it requires. While the actions mentioned are typical behaviors of BIOS extension ROMs, each option ROM receives total control of the computer and may do anything at all, as noted with more detail in the Extensions section below; it is possible that an option ROM will not return to BIOS, pre-empting the BIOS's boot sequence altogether.

An option ROM should normally return to the BIOS after completing its initialization process. Once (and if) an option ROM returns, the BIOS continues searching for more option ROMs, calling each as it is found, until the entire option ROM area in the memory space has been scanned.

Option ROMs normally reside on adapter cards. However, the original PC, and perhaps also the PC XT, have a spare ROM socket on the motherboard (the "system board" in IBM's terms) into which an option ROM can be inserted, and the four ROMs that contain the BASIC interpreter can also be removed and replaced with custom ROMs which can be option ROMs. The <a href="IBM%20PCjr">IBM PCjr</a> is unique among PCs in having two ROM cartridge slots on the front. Cartridges in these slots map into the same region of the upper memory area used for option ROMs, and the cartridges can contain option ROM modules that the BIOS would recognize. The cartridges can also contain other types of ROM modules, such as BASIC programs, that are handled differently. One PCjr cartridge can contain several ROM modules of different types, possibly stored together in one ROM chip.

The BIOS ROM is customized to the particular manufacturer's hardware, allowing low-level services (such as reading a keystroke or writing a sector of data to diskette) to be provided in a standardized way to programs, including operating systems. For example, an IBM PC might have either a monochrome or a color display adapter (using different display memory addresses and hardware), but a single, standard, BIOS system call may be invoked to display a character at a specified position on the screen in <a href="text%20mode">text mode</a> or <a href="All%20points%20addressable">graphics mode</a>.

The BIOS provides a small <a href="library%20%28computing%29">library</a> of basic input/output functions to operate peripherals (such as the keyboard, rudimentary text and graphics display functions and so forth). When using MS-DOS, BIOS services could be accessed by an application program (or by MS-DOS) by executing an <a href="INT%2013h">INT 13h</a> interrupt instruction to access disk functions, or by executing one of a number of other documented <a href="BIOS%20interrupt%20call">BIOS interrupt call</a>s to access video display, keyboard, cassette, and other device functions.

<a href="Operating%20system">Operating system</a>s and executive software that are designed to supersede this basic firmware functionality provide replacement software interfaces to application software. Applications can also provide these services to themselves. This began even in the 1980s under MS-DOS, when programmers observed that using the BIOS video services for graphics display was very slow. To increase the speed of screen output, many programs bypassed the BIOS and programmed the video display hardware directly. Other graphics programmers, particularly but not exclusively in the <a href="demoscene">demoscene</a>, observed that there were technical capabilities of the PC display adapters that were not supported by the IBM BIOS and could not be taken advantage of without circumventing it. Since the AT-compatible BIOS ran in Intel <a href="real%20mode">real mode</a>, operating systems that ran in protected mode on 286 and later processors required hardware device drivers compatible with protected mode operation to replace BIOS services.

In modern personal computers running modern operating systems the BIOS is used only during booting and initial loading of system software. Before the operating system's first graphical screen is displayed, input and output are typically handled through BIOS. A boot menu such as the textual menu of Windows, which allows users to choose an operating system to boot, to boot into the safe mode, or to use the last known good configuration, is displayed through BIOS and receives keyboard input through BIOS.

Most modern PCs can still boot and run legacy operating systems such as MS-DOS or DR-DOS that rely heavily on BIOS for their console and disk I/O, providing that the system has a BIOS or BIOS-compatible firmware, which is not necessarily the case with UEFI-based PCs.

<a href="Intel">Intel</a> processors have reprogrammable <a href="microcode">microcode</a> since the <a href="P6%20%28microarchitecture%29">P6</a> microarchitecture. The BIOS may contain patches to the processor microcode that fix errors in the initial processor microcode; reprogramming is not persistent, thus loading of microcode updates is performed each time the system is powered up. Without reprogrammable microcode, an expensive processor swap would be required; for example, the <a href="Pentium%20FDIV%20bug">Pentium FDIV bug</a> became an expensive fiasco for Intel as it required a <a href="product%20recall">product recall</a> because the original Pentium processor's defective microcode could not be reprogrammed.

Some BIOSes contain a software licensing description table (SLIC), a digital signature placed inside the BIOS by the <a href="original%20equipment%20manufacturer">original equipment manufacturer</a> (OEM), for example <a href="Dell">Dell</a>. The SLIC is inserted into the ACPI table and contains no active code.

Computer manufacturers that distribute OEM versions of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft application software can use the SLIC to authenticate licensing to the OEM Windows Installation disk and system <a href="recovery%20disc">recovery disc</a> containing Windows software. Systems with an SLIC can be preactivated with an OEM product key, and they verify an XML formatted OEM certificate against the SLIC in the BIOS as a means of self-activating (see <a href="System%20Locked%20Preinstallation">System Locked Preinstallation</a>, SLP). If a user performs a fresh install of Windows, they will need to have possession of both the OEM key (either SLP or COA) and the digital certificate for their SLIC in order to bypass activation. This can be achieved if the user performs a restore using a pre-customised image provided by the OEM. Power users can copy the necessary certificate files from the OEM image, decode the SLP product key, then perform SLP activation manually. Cracks for non-genuine Windows distributions usually edit the SLIC or emulate it in order to bypass Windows activation.

Some BIOS implementations allow <a href="overclocking">overclocking</a>, an action in which the <a href="central%20processing%20unit">CPU</a> is adjusted to a higher <a href="clock%20rate">clock rate</a> than its manufacturer rating for guaranteed capability. Overclocking may, however, seriously compromise system reliability in insufficiently cooled computers and generally shorten component lifespan. Overclocking, when incorrectly performed, may also cause components to overheat so quickly that they mechanically destroy themselves.

Some <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>s, for example <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>, rely on the BIOS to carry out most input/output tasks within the PC.

Because the BIOS still runs in 16-bit <a href="real%20mode">real mode</a>, calling BIOS services directly is inefficient for protected-mode operating systems. BIOS services are not used by modern multitasking operating systems after they initially load, so the importance of the primary part of BIOS is greatly reduced from what it was initially.

Later BIOS implementations took on more complex functions, by including interfaces such as <a href="Advanced%20Configuration%20and%20Power%20Interface">Advanced Configuration and Power Interface</a> (ACPI); these functions include <a href="power%20management">power management</a>, <a href="hot%20swapping">hot swapping</a>, and thermal management. At the same time, since 2010, BIOS technology is in a transitional process toward <a href="Unified%20Extensible%20Firmware%20Interface">UEFI</a>.

Historically, the BIOS in the IBM PC and XT had no built-in user interface. The BIOS versions in earlier PCs (XT-class) were not software configurable; instead, users set the options via <a href="DIP%20switch">DIP switch</a>es on the motherboard. Later computers, including all IBM-compatibles with 80286 CPUs, had a battery-backed <a href="nonvolatile%20BIOS%20memory">nonvolatile BIOS memory</a> (CMOS RAM chip) that held BIOS settings. These settings, such as video-adapter type, memory size, and hard-disk parameters, could only be configured by running a configuration program from a disk, not built into the ROM. A special "reference diskette" was inserted in an <a href="IBM%20Personal%20Computer/AT">IBM AT</a> to configure settings such as memory size.

Early BIOS versions did not have passwords or boot-device selection options. The BIOS was hard-coded to boot from the first floppy drive, or, if that failed, the first hard disk. Access control in early AT-class machines was by a physical keylock switch (which was not hard to defeat if the computer case could be opened). Anyone who could switch on the computer could boot it.

Later, 386-class computers started integrating the BIOS setup utility in the ROM itself, alongside the BIOS code; these computers usually boot into the BIOS setup utility if a certain key or key combination is pressed, otherwise the BIOS POST and boot process are executed.

A modern BIOS setup utility has a menu-based <a href="user%20interface">user interface</a> (UI) accessed by pressing a certain key on the keyboard when the PC starts. Usually the key is advertised for short time during the early startup, for example "Press F1 to enter CMOS setup". The actual key depends on specific hardware. Features present in the BIOS setup utility typically include:


In modern PCs the BIOS is stored in <a href="EEPROM">rewritable memory</a>, allowing the contents to be replaced and modified. This rewriting of the contents is sometimes termed "flashing", based on the common use of a kind of EEPROM known technically as "flash EEPROM" and colloquially as "flash memory". It can be done by a special program, usually provided by the system's manufacturer, or at <a href="power-on%20self-test">POST</a>, with a BIOS image in a hard drive or USB flash drive. A file containing such contents is sometimes termed "a BIOS image". A BIOS might be reflashed in order to upgrade to a newer version to fix bugs or provide improved performance or to support newer hardware, or a reflashing operation might be needed to fix a damaged BIOS.

The original IBM PC BIOS (and cassette BASIC) was stored on mask-programmed <a href="read-only%20memory">read-only memory</a> (ROM) chips in sockets on the motherboard. ROMs could be replaced, but not altered, by users. To allow for updates, many compatible computers used re-programmable memory devices such as <a href="EPROM">EPROM</a> and later <a href="flash%20memory">flash memory</a> devices. According to Robert Braver, the president of the BIOS manufacturer Micro Firmware, Flash BIOS chips became common around 1995 because the electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM) chips are cheaper and easier to program than standard <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> erasable PROM (<a href="EPROM">EPROM</a>) chips. Flash chips are programmed (and re-programmed) in-circuit, while EPROM chips need to be removed from the motherboard for re-programming. BIOS versions are upgraded to take advantage of newer versions of hardware and to correct bugs in previous revisions of BIOSes.

Beginning with the IBM AT, PCs supported a hardware clock settable through BIOS. It had a century bit which allowed for manually changing the century when the year 2000 happened. Most BIOS revisions created in 1995 and nearly all BIOS revisions in 1997 supported <a href="Year%202000%20problem">the year 2000</a> by setting the century bit automatically when the clock rolled past midnight, December 31, 1999.

The first flash chips were attached to the <a href="Industry%20Standard%20Architecture">ISA bus</a>. Starting in 1997, the BIOS flash moved to the <a href="Low%20Pin%20Count">LPC</a> bus, a functional replacement for ISA, following a new standard implementation known as "firmware hub" (FWH). In 2006, the first systems supporting a <a href="Serial%20Peripheral%20Interface">Serial Peripheral Interface</a> (SPI) appeared, and the BIOS flash memory moved again.

The size of the BIOS, and the capacity of the ROM, EEPROM, or other media it may be stored on, has increased over time as new features have been added to the code; BIOS versions now exist with sizes up to 16 megabytes. For contrast, the original IBM PC BIOS was contained in an 8 KiB mask ROM. Some modern motherboards are including even bigger NAND <a href="flash%20memory">flash memory</a> ICs on board which are capable of storing whole compact operating systems, such as some <a href="Linux%20distribution">Linux distribution</a>s. For example, some ASUS motherboards included <a href="Splashtop%20Remote">Splashtop</a> Linux embedded into their NAND flash memory ICs. However, the idea of including an operating system along with BIOS in the ROM of a PC is not new; in the 1980s, Microsoft offered a ROM option for MS-DOS, and it was included in the ROMs of some PC clones such as the <a href="Tandy%201000%23Tandy%201000%20HX%20.26%20TX">Tandy 1000 HX</a>.

Another type of firmware chip was found on the IBM PC AT and early compatibles. In the AT, the <a href="keyboard%20controller%20%28computing%29">keyboard interface</a> was controlled by a <a href="microcontroller">microcontroller</a> with its own programmable memory. On the IBM AT, that was a 40-pin socketed device, while some manufacturers used an EPROM version of this chip which resembled an EPROM. This controller was also assigned the <a href="A20%20gate">A20 gate</a> function to manage memory above the one-megabyte range; occasionally an upgrade of this "keyboard BIOS" was necessary to take advantage of software that could use upper memory. 

The BIOS may contain components such as the <a href="Memory%20Reference%20Code">Memory Reference Code</a> (MRC), which is responsible for handling memory timings and related hardware settings.

IBM published the entire listings of the BIOS for its original PC, PC XT, PC AT, and other contemporary PC models, in an appendix of the "IBM PC Technical Reference Manual" for each machine type. The effect of the publication of the BIOS listings is that anyone can see exactly what a definitive BIOS does and how it does it.

In May 1984 <a href="Phoenix%20Technologies">Phoenix Software Associates</a> released its first ROM-BIOS which enabled OEMs to build essentially 100%-compatible clones without having to reverse-engineer the IBM PC BIOS themselves, as Compaq had done for the <a href="Compaq%20Portable">Portable</a>, helping fuel the growth in the PC compatibles industry and sales of non-IBM versions of DOS.

New standards grafted onto the BIOS are usually without complete public documentation or any BIOS listings. As a result, it is not as easy to learn the intimate details about the many non-IBM additions to BIOS as about the core BIOS services.

Most PC motherboard suppliers license a BIOS "core" and toolkit from a commercial third-party, known as an "independent BIOS vendor" or IBV. The motherboard manufacturer then customizes this BIOS to suit its own hardware. For this reason, updated BIOSes are normally obtained directly from the motherboard manufacturer. Major BIOS vendors include <a href="American%20Megatrends">American Megatrends</a> (AMI), <a href="Insyde%20Software">Insyde Software</a>, <a href="Phoenix%20Technologies">Phoenix Technologies</a> and Byosoft. Former vendors include <a href="Award%20Software">Award Software</a> and Microid Research that were acquired by <a href="Phoenix%20Technologies">Phoenix Technologies</a> in 1998; Phoenix later phased out the Award Brand name. <a href="General%20Software">General Software</a>, which was also acquired by Phoenix in 2007, sold BIOS for Intel processor based embedded systems.

The open source community increased their effort to develop a replacement for proprietary BIOSes and their future incarnations with an open sourced counterpart through the <a href="libreboot">libreboot</a>, <a href="coreboot">coreboot</a> and <a href="OpenBIOS">OpenBIOS</a>/<a href="Open%20Firmware">Open Firmware</a> projects. <a href="Advanced%20Micro%20Devices">AMD</a> provided product specifications for some chipsets, and <a href="Google">Google</a> is sponsoring the project. <a href="Motherboard">Motherboard</a> manufacturer <a href="Tyan">Tyan</a> offers <a href="coreboot">coreboot</a> next to the standard BIOS with their <a href="Opteron">Opteron</a> line of motherboards. <a href="Micro-Star%20International">MSI</a> and <a href="Gigabyte%20Technology">Gigabyte Technology</a> have followed suit with the MSI K9ND MS-9282 and MSI K9SD MS-9185 resp. the M57SLI-S4 models.

<a href="EEPROM">EEPROM</a> chips are advantageous because they can be easily updated by the user; it is customary for hardware manufacturers to issue BIOS updates to upgrade their products, improve compatibility and remove <a href="software%20bug">bugs</a>. However, this advantage had the risk that an improperly executed or aborted BIOS update could render the computer or device unusable. To avoid these situations, more recent BIOSes use a "boot block"; a portion of the BIOS which runs first and must be updated separately. This code verifies if the rest of the BIOS is intact (using <a href="hash%20function">hash</a> <a href="checksum">checksum</a>s or other methods) before transferring control to it. If the boot block detects any corruption in the main BIOS, it will typically warn the user that a recovery process must be initiated by booting from <a href="removable%20media">removable media</a> (floppy, CD or USB flash drive) so the user can try flashing the BIOS again. Some <a href="motherboard">motherboard</a>s have a "backup" BIOS (sometimes referred to as DualBIOS boards) to recover from BIOS corruptions.

There are at least four known BIOS attack viruses, two of which were for demonstration purposes. The first one found in the wild was "Mebromi", targeting Chinese users.

The first BIOS virus was <a href="CIH%20%28computer%20virus%29">CIH</a>, whose name matches the initials of its creator, Chen Ing Hau. CIH was also called the "Chernobyl Virus", because its payload date was 1999-04-26, the 13th anniversary of the <a href="Chernobyl%20accident">Chernobyl accident</a>. CIH appeared in mid-1998 and became active in April 1999. It was able to erase flash ROM BIOS content. Often, infected computers could no longer boot, and people had to remove the flash ROM IC from the motherboard and reprogram it. CIH targeted the then-widespread Intel i430TX motherboard chipset and took advantage of the fact that the <a href="Windows%209x">Windows 9x</a> operating systems, also widespread at the time, allowed direct hardware access to all programs.

Modern systems are not vulnerable to CIH because of a variety of chipsets being used which are incompatible with the Intel i430TX chipset, and also other flash ROM IC types. There is also extra protection from accidental BIOS rewrites in the form of boot blocks which are protected from accidental overwrite or dual and quad BIOS equipped systems which may, in the event of a crash, use a backup BIOS. Also, all modern operating systems such as <a href="FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a>, <a href="Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="macOS">macOS</a>, <a href="Windows%20NT">Windows NT</a>-based Windows OS like <a href="Windows%202000">Windows 2000</a>, <a href="Windows%20XP">Windows XP</a> and newer, do not allow <a href="Protection%20ring">user-mode</a> programs to have direct hardware access.

As a result, as of 2008, CIH has become essentially harmless, at worst causing annoyance by infecting executable files and triggering antivirus software. Other BIOS viruses remain possible, however; since most Windows home users without Windows Vista/7's UAC run all applications with administrative privileges, a modern CIH-like virus could in principle still gain access to hardware without first using an exploit. The operating system <a href="OpenBSD">OpenBSD</a> prevents all users from having this access and the grsecurity patch for the linux kernel also prevents this direct hardware access by default, the difference being an attacker requiring a much more difficult kernel level exploit or reboot of the machine.

The second BIOS virus was a technique presented by John Heasman, principal security consultant for UK-based Next-Generation Security Software. In 2006, at the Black Hat Security Conference, he showed how to elevate privileges and read physical memory, using malicious procedures that replaced normal <a href="Advanced%20Configuration%20and%20Power%20Interface">ACPI</a> functions stored in flash memory.

The third BIOS virus was a technique called "Persistent BIOS infection." It appeared in 2009 at the CanSecWest Security Conference in Vancouver, and at the SyScan Security Conference in Singapore. Researchers Anibal Sacco and Alfredo Ortega, from Core Security Technologies, demonstrated how to insert malicious code into the decompression routines in the BIOS, allowing for nearly full control of the PC at start-up, even before the operating system is booted. The proof-of-concept does not exploit a flaw in the BIOS implementation, but only involves the normal BIOS flashing procedures. Thus, it requires physical access to the machine, or for the user to be root. Despite these requirements, Ortega underlined the profound implications of his and Sacco's discovery: "We can patch a driver to drop a fully working <a href="rootkit">rootkit</a>. We even have a little code that can remove or disable antivirus."

Mebromi is a <a href="Trojan%20horse%20%28computing%29">trojan</a> which targets computers with <a href="AwardBIOS">AwardBIOS</a>, <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, and <a href="antivirus%20software">antivirus software</a> from two Chinese companies: Rising Antivirus and Jiangmin KV Antivirus. Mebromi installs a rootkit which infects the <a href="master%20boot%20record">master boot record</a>.

In a December 2013 interview with "<a href="60%20Minutes">60 Minutes</a>", Deborah Plunkett, Information Assurance Director for the US <a href="National%20Security%20Agency">National Security Agency</a> claimed that NSA analysts had uncovered and thwarted a possible BIOS attack by a foreign nation state. The attack on the world's computers could have allegedly "literally taken down the US economy." The segment further cites anonymous cyber security experts briefed on the operation as alleging the plot was conceived in China. A later article in <a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a> cast doubt on the likelihood of such a threat, quoting Berkeley computer-science researcher Nicholas Weaver, <a href="Matt%20Blaze">Matt Blaze</a>, a computer and information sciences professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and cybersecurity expert Robert David Graham in an analysis of the NSA's claims.

, the BIOS is being replaced by the more complex <a href="Extensible%20Firmware%20Interface">Extensible Firmware Interface</a> (EFI) in many new machines. EFI is a specification which replaces the runtime interface of the legacy BIOS. Initially written for the <a href="Intel%20Itanium%20architecture">Intel Itanium architecture</a>, EFI is now available for <a href="x86">x86</a> and <a href="x86-64">x86-64</a> platforms; the specification development is driven by The <a href="Unified%20EFI%20Forum">Unified EFI Forum</a>, an industry <a href="Special%20Interest%20Group">Special Interest Group</a>. EFI booting has been supported in only <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> versions supporting <a href="GUID%20Partition%20Table">GPT</a>, the <a href="Linux%20kernel">Linux kernel</a> 2.6.1 and later, and <a href="macOS">macOS</a> on <a href="Apple%E2%80%93Intel%20architecture">Intel-based Macs</a>. , new PC hardware predominantly ships with UEFI firmware. The architecture of the rootkit safeguard can also prevent the system from running the user's own software changes, which makes UEFI controversial as a BIOS replacement in the <a href="open%20hardware">open hardware</a> community. 

Other alternatives to the functionality of the "Legacy BIOS" in the x86 world include <a href="coreboot">coreboot</a> and <a href="libreboot">libreboot</a>.

Some servers and workstations use a platform-independent <a href="Open%20Firmware">Open Firmware</a> (IEEE-1275) based on the <a href="Forth%20%28programming%20language%29">Forth</a> programming language; it is included with Sun's <a href="SPARC">SPARC</a> computers, IBM's <a href="RS/6000">RS/6000</a> line, and other <a href="PowerPC">PowerPC</a> systems such as the <a href="Common%20Hardware%20Reference%20Platform">CHRP</a> motherboards, along with the x86-based <a href="OLPC%20XO-1">OLPC XO-1</a>.

As of at least 2015, <a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> has removed legacy BIOS support from <a href="MacBook%20Pro">MacBook Pro</a> computers. As such the bless utility no longer supports the --legacy switch, and prints "Legacy mode not supported on this system". These Macs also cannot boot from <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> or <a href="USB">USB</a> flash drives.

A Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is a <a href="state%20of%20matter">state of matter</a> of a dilute <a href="gas">gas</a> of <a href="boson">boson</a>s cooled to <a href="temperature">temperature</a>s very close to <a href="absolute%20zero">absolute zero</a> (that is, very near or ). Under such conditions, a large fraction of bosons occupy the lowest <a href="quantum%20state">quantum state</a>, at which point microscopic quantum phenomena, particularly wavefunction interference, become apparent. A BEC is formed by cooling a gas of extremely low density, about one-hundred-thousandth the density of normal air, to ultra-low temperatures.

This state was first predicted, generally, in 1924–25 by <a href="Satyendra%20Nath%20Bose">Satyendra Nath Bose</a> and <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>.

<a href="Satyendra%20Nath%20Bose">Satyendra Nath Bose</a> first sent a paper to Einstein on the <a href="quantum%20statistics">quantum statistics</a> of light quanta (now called <a href="photon">photon</a>s), in which he derived <a href="Planck%27s%20law">Planck's quantum radiation law</a> without any reference to classical physics. Einstein was impressed, translated the paper himself from English to German and submitted it for Bose to the "<a href="Zeitschrift%20f%C3%BCr%20Physik">Zeitschrift für Physik</a>", which published it. (The Einstein manuscript, once believed to be lost, was found in a library at <a href="Leiden%20University">Leiden University</a> in 2005.). Einstein then extended Bose's ideas to matter in two other papers. The result of their efforts is the concept of a <a href="Bose%20gas">Bose gas</a>, governed by <a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20statistics">Bose–Einstein statistics</a>, which describes the statistical distribution of <a href="identical%20particles">identical particles</a> with <a href="integer">integer</a> <a href="spin%20%28physics%29">spin</a>, now called <a href="boson">boson</a>s. Bosons, which include the photon as well as atoms such as <a href="helium-4">helium-4</a> (He), are allowed to share a quantum state. Einstein proposed that cooling bosonic atoms to a very low temperature would cause them to fall (or "condense") into the lowest accessible <a href="quantum%20state">quantum state</a>, resulting in a new form of matter.

In 1938 <a href="Fritz%20London">Fritz London</a> proposed BEC as a mechanism for <a href="superfluidity">superfluidity</a> in He and <a href="superconductivity">superconductivity</a>.

On June 5, 1995 the first gaseous condensate was produced by <a href="Eric%20Allin%20Cornell">Eric Cornell</a> and <a href="Carl%20Wieman">Carl Wieman</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder">University of Colorado at Boulder</a> <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">NIST</a>–<a href="JILA">JILA</a> lab, in a gas of <a href="rubidium">rubidium</a> atoms cooled to 170 <a href="kelvin">nanokelvins</a> (nK). Shortly thereafter, <a href="Wolfgang%20Ketterle">Wolfgang Ketterle</a> at <a href="MIT">MIT</a> demonstrated important BEC properties. For their achievements Cornell, Wieman, and Ketterle received the 2001 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a>.

Many isotopes were soon condensed, then molecules, quasi-particles, and photons in 2010.

This transition to BEC occurs below a critical temperature, which for a uniform <a href="Three-dimensional%20space">three-dimensional</a> gas consisting of non-interacting particles with no apparent internal degrees of freedom is given by:

where:

Interactions shift the value and the corrections can be calculated by mean-field theory.
This formula is derived from finding the gas degeneracy in the <a href="bose%20gas">bose gas</a> using <a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20statistics">Bose–Einstein statistics</a>.

Consider a collection of "N" noninteracting particles, which can each be in one of two <a href="quantum%20state">quantum state</a>s, formula_2 and formula_3. If the two states are equal in energy, each different configuration is equally likely.

If we can tell which particle is which, there are formula_4 different configurations, since each particle can be in formula_2 or formula_3 independently. In almost all of the configurations, about half the particles are in formula_2 and the other half in formula_3. The balance is a statistical effect: the number of configurations is largest when the particles are divided equally.

If the particles are indistinguishable, however, there are only "N"+1 different configurations. If there are "K" particles in state formula_3, there are particles in state formula_2. Whether any particular particle is in state formula_2 or in state formula_3 cannot be determined, so each value of "K" determines a unique quantum state for the whole system.

Suppose now that the energy of state formula_3 is slightly greater than the energy of state formula_2 by an amount "E". At temperature "T", a particle will have a lesser probability to be in state formula_3 by formula_16. In the distinguishable case, the particle distribution will be biased slightly towards state formula_2. But in the indistinguishable case, since there is no statistical pressure toward equal numbers, the most-likely outcome is that most of the particles will collapse into state formula_2.

In the distinguishable case, for large "N", the fraction in state formula_2 can be computed. It is the same as flipping a coin with probability proportional to "p" = exp(−"E"/"T") to land tails.

In the indistinguishable case, each value of "K" is a single state, which has its own separate Boltzmann probability. So the probability distribution is exponential:

For large "N", the normalization constant "C" is . The expected total number of particles not in the lowest energy state, in the limit that formula_21, is equal to formula_22. It does not grow when "N" is large; it just approaches a constant. This will be a negligible fraction of the total number of particles. So a collection of enough Bose particles in thermal equilibrium will mostly be in the ground state, with only a few in any excited state, no matter how small the energy difference.

Consider now a gas of particles, which can be in different momentum states labeled formula_23. If the number of particles is less than the number of thermally accessible states, for high temperatures and low densities, the particles will all be in different states. In this limit, the gas is classical. As the density increases or the temperature decreases, the number of accessible states per particle becomes smaller, and at some point, more particles will be forced into a single state than the maximum allowed for that state by statistical weighting. From this point on, any extra particle added will go into the ground state.

To calculate the transition temperature at any density, integrate, over all momentum states, the expression for maximum number of excited particles, :

When the integral is evaluated with factors of "k" and ℏ restored by dimensional analysis, it gives the critical temperature formula of the preceding section. Therefore, this integral defines the critical temperature and particle number corresponding to the conditions of negligible <a href="chemical%20potential">chemical potential</a>. In <a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20statistics">Bose–Einstein statistics</a> distribution, μ is actually still nonzero for BECs; however, μ is less than the ground state energy. Except when specifically talking about the ground state, μ can be approximated for most energy or momentum states as μ ≈ 0.

Bogoliubov considered perturbations on the limit of dilute gas, finding a finite pressure at zero temperature and positive chemical potential. This leads to corrections for the ground state. The Bogoliubov state has pressure ("T" = 0): formula_26.

The original interacting system can be converted to a system of non-interacting particles with a dispersion law.

In some simplest cases, the state of condensed particles can be described with a nonlinear Schrödinger equation, also known as Gross–Pitaevskii or Ginzburg–Landau equation. The validity of this approach is actually limited to the case of ultracold temperatures, which fits well for the most alkali atoms experiments.

This approach originates from the assumption that the state of the BEC can be described by the unique wavefunction of the condensate formula_27. For a <a href="Schr%C3%B6dinger%20field">system of this nature</a>, formula_28 is interpreted as the particle density, so the total number of atoms is formula_29

Provided essentially all atoms are in the condensate (that is, have condensed to the ground state), and treating the bosons using <a href="mean%20field%20theory">mean field theory</a>, the energy (E) associated with the state formula_27 is:

Minimizing this energy with respect to infinitesimal variations in formula_27, and holding the number of atoms constant, yields the Gross–Pitaevski equation (GPE) (also a non-linear <a href="Schr%C3%B6dinger%20equation">Schrödinger equation</a>):

where:

In the case of zero external potential, the dispersion law of interacting Bose–Einstein-condensed particles is given by so-called Bogoliubov spectrum (for formula_34):

The Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) provides a relatively good description of the behavior of atomic BEC's. However, GPE does not take into account the temperature dependence of dynamical variables, and is therefore valid only for formula_34.
It is not applicable, for example, for the condensates of excitons, magnons and photons, where the critical temperature is up to room one.

The Gross–Pitaevskii model of BEC is a physical <a href="approximation">approximation</a> valid for certain classes of BECs. By construction, the <a href="Gross%E2%80%93Pitaevskii%20equation">GPE</a> uses the following simplifications: it assumes that interactions between condensate particles are of the contact two-body type and also neglects anomalous contributions to <a href="self-energy">self-energy</a>. These assumptions are suitable mostly for the dilute three-dimensional condensates. If one relaxes any of these assumptions, the equation for the condensate <a href="wavefunction">wavefunction</a> acquires the terms containing higher-order powers of the wavefunction. Moreover, for some physical systems the amount of such terms turns out to be infinite, therefore, the equation becomes essentially non-polynomial. The examples where this could happen are the Bose–Fermi composite condensates, effectively lower-dimensional condensates, and dense condensates and <a href="superfluid">superfluid</a> clusters and droplets.

However, it is clear that in a general case the behaviour of Bose–Einstein condensate can be described by coupled evolution equations for condensate density, superfluid velocity and distribution function of elementary excitations. This problem was in 1977 by Peletminskii et al. in microscopical approach. The Peletminskii equations are valid for any finite temperatures below the critical point. Years after, in 1985, Kirkpatrick and Dorfman obtained similar equations using another microscopical approach. The Peletminskii equations also reproduce Khalatnikov hydrodynamical equations for superfluid as a limiting case.

The phenomena of superfluidity of a Bose gas and superconductivity of a strongly-correlated Fermi gas (a gas of Cooper pairs) are tightly connected to Bose–Einstein condensation. Under corresponding conditions, below the temperature of phase transition, these phenomena were observed in <a href="helium-4">helium-4</a> and different classes of superconductors. In this sense, the superconductivity is often called the superfluidity of Fermi gas. In the simplest form, the origin of superfluidity can be seen from the weakly interacting bosons model.

In 1938, <a href="Pyotr%20Leonidovich%20Kapitsa">Pyotr Kapitsa</a>, <a href="John%20F.%20Allen">John Allen</a> and <a href="Don%20Misener">Don Misener</a> discovered that <a href="helium-4">helium-4</a> became a new kind of fluid, now known as a <a href="superfluid">superfluid</a>, at temperatures less than 2.17 K (the <a href="lambda%20point">lambda point</a>). Superfluid helium has many unusual properties, including zero <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a> (the ability to flow without dissipating energy) and the existence of <a href="quantum%20vortex">quantized vortices</a>. It was quickly believed that the superfluidity was due to partial Bose–Einstein condensation of the liquid. In fact, many properties of superfluid helium also appear in gaseous condensates created by Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle (see below). <a href="Superfluid%20helium-4">Superfluid helium-4</a> is a liquid rather than a gas, which means that the interactions between the atoms are relatively strong; the original theory of Bose–Einstein condensation must be heavily modified in order to describe it. Bose–Einstein condensation remains, however, fundamental to the superfluid properties of helium-4. Note that <a href="helium-3">helium-3</a>, a <a href="fermion">fermion</a>, also enters a <a href="superfluid">superfluid</a> phase (at a much lower temperature) which can be explained by the formation of bosonic <a href="Cooper%20pairs">Cooper pairs</a> of two atoms (see also <a href="fermionic%20condensate">fermionic condensate</a>).

The first "pure" Bose–Einstein condensate was created by <a href="Eric%20Cornell">Eric Cornell</a>, <a href="Carl%20Wieman">Carl Wieman</a>, and co-workers at <a href="JILA">JILA</a> on 5 June 1995. They cooled a dilute vapor of approximately two thousand <a href="rubidium">rubidium-87</a> atoms to below 170 nK using a combination of <a href="laser%20cooling">laser cooling</a> (a technique that won its inventors <a href="Steven%20Chu">Steven Chu</a>, <a href="Claude%20Cohen-Tannoudji">Claude Cohen-Tannoudji</a>, and <a href="William%20D.%20Phillips">William D. Phillips</a> the 1997 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a>) and <a href="magnetic%20evaporative%20cooling">magnetic evaporative cooling</a>. About four months later, an independent effort led by <a href="Wolfgang%20Ketterle">Wolfgang Ketterle</a> at <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">MIT</a> condensed <a href="sodium">sodium-23</a>. Ketterle's condensate had a hundred times more atoms, allowing important results such as the observation of <a href="quantum%20mechanics">quantum mechanical</a> <a href="Interference%20%28wave%20propagation%29">interference</a> between two different condensates. Cornell, Wieman and Ketterle won the 2001 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physics">Nobel Prize in Physics</a> for their achievements.

A group led by Randall Hulet at Rice University announced a condensate of <a href="lithium">lithium</a> atoms only one month following the JILA work. Lithium has attractive interactions, causing the condensate to be unstable and collapse for all but a few atoms. Hulet's team subsequently showed the condensate could be stabilized by confinement quantum pressure for up to about 1000 atoms. Various isotopes have since been condensed.

In the image accompanying this article, the velocity-distribution data indicates the formation of a Bose–Einstein condensate out of a gas of <a href="rubidium">rubidium</a> atoms. The false colors indicate the number of atoms at each velocity, with red being the fewest and white being the most. The areas appearing white and light blue are at the lowest velocities. The peak is not infinitely narrow because of the <a href="uncertainty%20principle">Heisenberg uncertainty principle</a>: spatially confined atoms have a minimum width velocity distribution. This width is given by the curvature of the magnetic potential in the given direction. More tightly confined directions have bigger widths in the ballistic velocity distribution. This <a href="anisotropy">anisotropy</a> of the peak on the right is a purely quantum-mechanical effect and does not exist in the thermal distribution on the left. This graph served as the cover design for the 1999 textbook "Thermal Physics" by Ralph Baierlein.

Bose–Einstein condensation also applies to <a href="quasiparticle">quasiparticle</a>s in solids. Magnons, Excitons, and Polaritons have integer spin which means they are <a href="bosons">bosons</a> that can form condensates.

<a href="Magnon">Magnon</a>s, electron spin waves, can be controlled by a magnetic field. Densities from the limit of a dilute gas to a strongly interacting Bose liquid are possible. Magnetic ordering is the analog of superfluidity. In 1999 condensation was demonstrated in antiferromagnetic <a href="Thallium">Tl</a><a href="Copper">Cu</a><a href="Chlorine">Cl</a>, at temperatures as large as 14 K. The high transition temperature (relative to atomic gases) is due to the magnons small mass (near an electron) and greater achievable density. In 2006, condensation in a <a href="ferromagnetism">ferromagnetic</a> yttrium-iron-garnet thin film was seen even at room temperature, with optical pumping.

<a href="Exciton">Exciton</a>s, electron-hole pairs, were predicted to condense at low temperature and high density by Boer et al. in 1961. Bilayer system experiments first demonstrated condensation in 2003, by Hall voltage disappearance. Fast optical exciton creation was used to form condensates in sub-kelvin CuO in 2005 on.

<a href="Bose%E2%80%93Einstein%20condensation%20of%20polaritons">Polariton condensation</a> was firstly detected for <a href="exciton-polaritons">exciton-polaritons</a> in a quantum well microcavity kept at 5 K.

As in many other systems, <a href="Vortex">vortices</a> can exist in BECs. These can be created, for example, by 'stirring' the condensate with lasers, or rotating the confining trap. The vortex created will be a <a href="quantum%20vortex">quantum vortex</a>. These phenomena are allowed for by the non-linear formula_28 term in the GPE. As the vortices must have quantized <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a> the wavefunction may have the form formula_38 where formula_39 and formula_40 are as in the <a href="cylindrical%20coordinate%20system">cylindrical coordinate system</a>, and formula_41 is the angular number. This is particularly likely for an axially symmetric (for instance, harmonic) confining potential, which is commonly used. The notion is easily generalized. To determine formula_42, the energy of formula_27 must be minimized, according to the constraint formula_38. This is usually done computationally, however in a uniform medium the analytic form:

demonstrates the correct behavior, and is a good approximation.

A singly charged vortex (formula_46) is in the ground state, with its energy formula_47 given by

where formula_49 is the farthest distance from the vortices considered.(To obtain an energy which is well defined it is necessary to include this boundary formula_50.)

For multiply charged vortices (formula_51) the energy is approximated by

which is greater than that of formula_41 singly charged vortices, indicating that these multiply charged vortices are unstable to decay. Research has, however, indicated they are metastable states, so may have relatively long lifetimes.

Closely related to the creation of vortices in BECs is the generation of so-called dark <a href="soliton">soliton</a>s in one-dimensional BECs. These topological objects feature a phase gradient across their nodal plane, which stabilizes their shape even in propagation and interaction. Although solitons carry no charge and are thus prone to decay, relatively long-lived dark solitons have been produced and studied extensively.

Experiments led by Randall Hulet at Rice University from 1995 through 2000 showed that lithium condensates with attractive interactions could stably exist up to a critical atom number. Quench cooling the gas, they observed the condensate to grow, then subsequently collapse as the attraction overwhelmed the zero-point energy of the confining potential, in a burst reminiscent of a supernova, with an explosion preceded by an implosion.

Further work on attractive condensates was performed in 2000 by the <a href="JILA">JILA</a> team, of Cornell, Wieman and coworkers. Their instrumentation now had better control so they used naturally "attracting" atoms of rubidium-85 (having negative atom–atom <a href="scattering%20length">scattering length</a>). Through <a href="Feshbach%20resonance">Feshbach resonance</a> involving a sweep of the magnetic field causing spin flip collisions, they lowered the characteristic, discrete energies at which rubidium bonds, making their Rb-85 atoms repulsive and creating a stable condensate. The reversible flip from attraction to repulsion stems from quantum <a href="Interference%20%28wave%20propagation%29">interference</a> among wave-like condensate atoms.

When the JILA team raised the magnetic field strength further, the condensate suddenly reverted to attraction, imploded and shrank beyond detection, then exploded, expelling about two-thirds of its 10,000 atoms. About half of the atoms in the condensate seemed to have disappeared from the experiment altogether, not seen in the cold remnant or expanding gas cloud. <a href="Carl%20Wieman">Carl Wieman</a> explained that under current atomic theory this characteristic of Bose–Einstein condensate could not be explained because the energy state of an atom near absolute zero should not be enough to cause an implosion; however, subsequent mean field theories have been proposed to explain it. Most likely they formed molecules of two rubidium atoms, energy gained by this bond imparts velocity sufficient to leave the trap without being detected.

The process of creation of molecular Bose condensate during the sweep of the magnetic field throughout the Feshbach resonance, as well as the reverse process, are described by the exactly solvable model that can explain many experimental observations.

Compared to more commonly encountered states of matter, Bose–Einstein condensates are extremely fragile. The slightest interaction with the external environment can be enough to warm them past the condensation threshold, eliminating their interesting properties and forming a normal gas. 

Nevertheless, they have proven useful in exploring a wide range of questions in fundamental physics, and the years since the initial discoveries by the JILA and MIT groups have seen an increase in experimental and theoretical activity. Examples include experiments that have demonstrated <a href="Interference%20%28wave%20propagation%29">interference</a> between condensates due to <a href="wave%E2%80%93particle%20duality">wave–particle duality</a>, the study of <a href="superfluidity">superfluidity</a> and quantized <a href="vortex">vortices</a>, the creation of bright matter wave <a href="soliton">soliton</a>s from Bose condensates confined to one dimension, and the <a href="slow%20light">slowing of light</a> pulses to very low speeds using <a href="electromagnetically%20induced%20transparency">electromagnetically induced transparency</a>. Vortices in Bose–Einstein condensates are also currently the subject of <a href="analogue%20gravity">analogue gravity</a> research, studying the possibility of modeling <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s and their related phenomena in such environments in the laboratory. Experimenters have also realized "<a href="optical%20lattice">optical lattice</a>s", where the interference pattern from overlapping lasers provides a <a href="periodic%20potential">periodic potential</a>. These have been used to explore the transition between a superfluid and a <a href="Mott%20insulator">Mott insulator</a>, and may be useful in studying Bose–Einstein condensation in fewer than three dimensions, for example the <a href="Tonks%E2%80%93Girardeau%20gas">Tonks–Girardeau gas</a>.

Bose–Einstein condensates composed of a wide range of <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s have been produced.

Cooling <a href="fermion">fermion</a>s to extremely low temperatures has created <a href="degenerate%20matter">degenerate</a> gases, subject to the <a href="Pauli%20exclusion%20principle">Pauli exclusion principle</a>. To exhibit Bose–Einstein condensation, the fermions must "pair up" to form bosonic compound particles (e.g. <a href="molecule">molecule</a>s or <a href="BCS%20theory">Cooper pairs</a>). The first <a href="molecule">molecular</a> condensates were created in November 2003 by the groups of <a href="Rudolf%20Grimm">Rudolf Grimm</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Innsbruck">University of Innsbruck</a>, <a href="Deborah%20S.%20Jin">Deborah S. Jin</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder">University of Colorado at Boulder</a> and <a href="Wolfgang%20Ketterle">Wolfgang Ketterle</a> at <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">MIT</a>. Jin quickly went on to create the first <a href="fermionic%20condensate">fermionic condensate</a> composed of <a href="Cooper%20pair">Cooper pair</a>s.

In 1999, Danish physicist <a href="Lene%20Hau">Lene Hau</a> led a team from <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> which <a href="Slow%20light">slowed a beam of light</a> to about 17 meters per second., using a superfluid. Hau and her associates have since made a group of condensate atoms recoil from a light pulse such that they recorded the light's phase and amplitude, recovered by a second nearby condensate, in what they term "slow-light-mediated atomic matter-wave amplification" using Bose–Einstein condensates: details are discussed in "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>".

Another current research interest is the creation of Bose–Einstein condensates in microgravity in order to use its properties for high precision <a href="Atom%20interferometer">atom interferometry</a>. The first demonstration of a BEC in weightlessness was archived in 2008 at a <a href="Fallturm%20Bremen">drop tower</a> in Bremen, Germany by a consortium of researches led by <a href="Ernst%20M.%20Rasel">Ernst M. Rasel</a> from <a href="Leibniz%20University%20of%20Hanover">Leibniz University of Hanover</a>. The same team demonstrated in 2017 the first creation of a Bose–Einstein condensate in space and it is also subject of two upcoming experiments on the <a href="International%20Space%20Station">International Space Station</a>.

Researchers in the new field of <a href="atomtronics">atomtronics</a> use the properties of Bose–Einstein condensates when manipulating groups of identical cold atoms using lasers. Further, BECs have been proposed by <a href="Emmanuel%20David%20Tannenbaum">Emmanuel David Tannenbaum</a> for anti-<a href="stealth%20technology">stealth technology</a>.

The effect has mainly been observed on alkaline atoms which have nuclear properties particularly suitable for working with traps. As of 2012, using ultra-low temperatures of or below, Bose–Einstein condensates had been obtained for a multitude of isotopes, mainly of <a href="alkali%20metal">alkali metal</a>, <a href="alkaline%20earth%20metal">alkaline earth metal</a>,
and <a href="lanthanide">lanthanide</a> atoms (<a href="lithium">Li</a>, <a href="sodium">Na</a>, <a href="potassium">K</a>, <a href="potassium">K</a>, <a href="rubidium">Rb</a>, Rb, <a href="caesium">Cs</a>, <a href="chromium">Cr</a>, <a href="calcium">Ca</a>, <a href="strontium">Sr</a>, <a href="strontium">Sr</a>, <a href="strontium">Sr</a>, <a href="ytterbium">Yb</a>, <a href="dysprosium">Dy</a>, and <a href="erbium">Er</a>). Research was finally successful in hydrogen with the aid of the newly developed method of 'evaporative cooling'. In contrast, the superfluid state of <a href="Helium">He</a> below is not a good example, because the interaction between the atoms is too strong. Only 8% of atoms are in the ground state near absolute zero, rather than the 100% of a true condensate.

The <a href="boson">boson</a>ic behavior of some of these alkaline gases appears odd at first sight, because their nuclei have half-integer total spin. It arises from a subtle interplay of electronic and nuclear spins: at ultra-low temperatures and corresponding excitation energies, the half-integer total spin of the electronic shell and half-integer total spin of the nucleus are coupled by a very weak <a href="hyperfine%20coupling">hyperfine interaction</a>. The total spin of the atom, arising from this coupling, is an integer lower value. The chemistry of systems at room temperature is determined by the electronic properties, which is essentially fermionic, since room temperature thermal excitations have typical energies much higher than the hyperfine values.

B (programming language)

B is a programming language developed at <a href="Bell%20Labs">Bell Labs</a> circa 1969. It is the work of <a href="Ken%20Thompson%20%28computer%20programmer%29">Ken Thompson</a> with <a href="Dennis%20Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a>.

B was derived from <a href="BCPL">BCPL</a>, and its name may be a contraction of BCPL. Thompson's coworker <a href="Dennis%20Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a> speculated that the name might be based on Bon, an earlier, but unrelated, programming language that Thompson designed for use on <a href="Multics">Multics</a>.

B was designed for recursive, non-numeric, machine independent applications, such as system and language software.

Initially Ken Thompson and later Dennis Ritchie developed B basing it mainly on the <a href="BCPL">BCPL</a> language Thompson used in the <a href="Multics">Multics</a> project. B was essentially the BCPL system stripped of any component Thompson felt he could do without in order to make it fit within the memory capacity of the minicomputers of the time. The BCPL to B transition also included changes made to suit Thompson's preferences (mostly along the lines of reducing the number of non-whitespace characters in a typical program). Much of the typical ALGOL-like syntax of BCPL was rather heavily changed in this process. The assignment operator codice_1 reverted to the codice_2 of <a href="Heinz%20Rutishauser">Rutishauser</a>'s Superplan (the source of <a href="ALGOL%2058">ALGOL 58</a>'s codice_1), and the equality operator codice_2 was replaced by codice_5.

Thompson invented arithmetic assignment operators for B, using codice_6 to add y to x (in C the operator is written codice_7). B also introduced the increment and decrement operators (codice_8 and codice_9). Their prefix or postfix position determines whether the value is taken before or after alteration of the operand. These innovations were not in the earliest versions of B. Some guess that they were created for the auto-increment and auto-decrement address modes of the <a href="Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation">DEC</a> <a href="PDP-11">PDP-11</a>. This is historically impossible as there was no PDP-11 at the time that B was developed.

B is typeless, or more precisely has one data type: the computer word. Most operators (e.g. codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, codice_13) treated this as an integer, but others treated it as a memory address to be de<a href="reference%20%28computer%20science%29">referenced</a>. In many other ways it looked a lot like an early version of C. There are a few library functions, including some that vaguely resemble functions from the <a href="stdio.h">standard I/O library</a> in C.

Early implementations were for the DEC <a href="PDP-7">PDP-7</a> and PDP-11 minicomputers using early <a href="Unix">Unix</a>, and <a href="Honeywell">Honeywell</a> 36-bit mainframes running the operating system <a href="General%20Comprehensive%20Operating%20System">GCOS</a>. The earliest PDP-7 implementations compiled to <a href="threaded%20code">threaded code</a>, and Ritchie wrote a compiler using <a href="TMG%20%28language%29">TMG</a> which produced machine code. In 1970 a PDP-11 was acquired and threaded code was used for the port; an assembler, <a href="dc%20%28Unix%29">dc</a>, and the B language itself were written in B to <a href="bootstrap">bootstrap</a> the computer. An early version of <a href="yacc">yacc</a> was produced with this PDP-11 configuration. Ritchie took over maintenance during this period.

The typeless nature of B made sense on the Honeywell, PDP-7 and many older computers, but was a problem on the PDP-11 because it was difficult to elegantly access the character data type that the PDP-11 and most modern computers fully support. Starting in 1971 Ritchie made changes to the language while converting its compiler to produce machine code, most notably adding data typing for variables. During 1971 and 1972 B evolved into "New B" (NB) and then C.

B is almost extinct, having been superseded by the <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C language</a>. However, it continues to see use () on GCOS mainframes, and on certain <a href="embedded%20systems">embedded systems</a> () for a variety of reasons, including limited hardware in the small systems; extensive libraries, tools, licensing cost issues; and simply being good enough for the job on others. The highly influential <a href="AberMUD">AberMUD</a> was originally written in B.

The following example is from the "Users' Reference to B" by Ken Thompson:

Beer–Lambert law

The Beer–Lambert law, also known as Beer's law, the Lambert–Beer law, or the Beer–Lambert–Bouguer law relates the <a href="Absorption%20%28electromagnetic%20radiation%29">attenuation</a> of <a href="light">light</a> to the properties of the material through which the light is travelling. The law is commonly applied to <a href="chemical%20analysis">chemical analysis</a> measurements and used in understanding attenuation in <a href="physical%20optics">physical optics</a>, for <a href="photons">photons</a>, <a href="neutrons">neutrons</a> or rarefied gases. In <a href="mathematical%20physics">mathematical physics</a>, this law arises as a solution of the <a href="Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook">BGK equation</a>.

The law was discovered by <a href="Pierre%20Bouguer%20">Pierre Bouguer </a> before 1729. It is often attributed to <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20Lambert">Johann Heinrich Lambert</a>, who cited Bouguer's "Essai d'optique sur la gradation de la lumière" (Claude Jombert, Paris, 1729)—and even quoted from it—in his "<a href="Photometria">Photometria</a>" in 1760. Lambert's law stated that absorbance of a material sample is directly proportional to its thickness (path length). Much later, <a href="August%20Beer">August Beer</a> discovered another attenuation relation in 1852. Beer's law stated that absorbance is proportional to the concentrations of the attenuating species in the material sample. The modern derivation of the Beer–Lambert law combines the two laws and correlates the absorbance to both the concentrations of the attenuating species as well as the thickness of the material sample.

By definition, the <a href="transmittance">transmittance</a> of material sample is related to its <a href="optical%20depth">optical depth</a> formula_1 and to its <a href="absorbance">absorbance</a> "A" as
where

The Beer–Lambert law states that, for "N" attenuating species in the material sample,
or equivalently that
where

Attenuation cross section and molar attenuation coefficient are related by
and number density and amount concentration by
where N is the <a href="Avogadro%20constant">Avogadro constant</a>.

In case of "uniform" attenuation, these relations become
or equivalently

Cases of "non-uniform" attenuation occur in <a href="atmospheric%20science">atmospheric science</a> applications and <a href="radiation%20shielding">radiation shielding</a> theory for instance.

The law tends to break down at very high concentrations, especially if the material is highly <a href="scattering">scattering</a>. If the radiation is especially intense, <a href="nonlinear%20optics">nonlinear optical</a> processes can also cause variances. The main reason, however, is the following. At high concentrations, the molecules are closer to each other and begin to interact with each other. This interaction will change several properties of the molecule, and thus will change the attenuation.

The Beer–Lambert law can be expressed in terms of <a href="attenuation%20coefficient">attenuation coefficient</a>, but in this case is better called Lambert's law since amount concentration, from Beer's law, is hidden inside the attenuation coefficient. The (Napierian) attenuation coefficient "μ" and the decadic attenuation coefficient of a material sample are related to its number densities and amount concentrations as
respectively, by definition of attenuation cross section and molar attenuation coefficient. Then the Beer–Lambert law becomes
and

In case of "uniform" attenuation, these relations become
or equivalently

Assume that a beam of light enters a material sample. Define "z" as an axis parallel to the direction of the beam. Divide the material sample into thin slices, perpendicular to the beam of light, with thickness d"z" sufficiently small that one particle in a slice cannot obscure another particle in the same slice when viewed along the "z" direction. The radiant flux of the light that emerges from a slice is reduced, compared to that of the light that entered, by , where "μ" is the (Napierian) <a href="attenuation%20coefficient">attenuation coefficient</a>, which yields the following first-order <a href="Linear%20differential%20equation">linear ODE</a>:
The attenuation is caused by the photons that did not make it to the other side of the slice because of <a href="scattering">scattering</a> or <a href="absorption%20%28electromagnetic%20radiation%29">absorption</a>. The solution to this differential equation is obtained by multiplying the <a href="integrating%20factor">integrating factor</a>
throughout to obtain
which simplifies due to the <a href="product%20rule">product rule</a> (applied backwards) to
Integrating both sides and solving for Φ for a material of real thickness "ℓ", with the incident radiant flux upon the slice and the transmitted radiant flux gives
and finally
Since the decadic attenuation coefficient "μ" is related to the (Napierian) attenuation coefficient by , one also have

To describe the attenuation coefficient in a way independent of the <a href="Number%20density">number densities</a> "n" of the "N" attenuating species of the material sample, one introduces the <a href="Cross%20section%20%28physics%29">attenuation cross section</a> . "σ" has the dimension of an area; it expresses the likelihood of interaction between the particles of the beam and the particles of the specie "i" in the material sample:

One can also use the <a href="molar%20attenuation%20coefficient">molar attenuation coefficient</a>s , where N is the <a href="Avogadro%20constant">Avogadro constant</a>, to describe the attenuation coefficient in a way independent of the <a href="amount%20concentration">amount concentration</a>s of the attenuating species of the material sample:

Under certain conditions Beer–Lambert law fails to maintain a linear relationship between attenuation and concentration of <a href="analyte">analyte</a>. These deviations are classified into three categories:

There are at least six conditions that need to be fulfilled in order for Beer–Lambert law to be valid. These are:

If any of these conditions are not fulfilled, there will be deviations from Beer–Lambert law.

The Beer–Lambert law is not compatible with <a href="Maxwell%27s%20equations">Maxwell's equations</a>. Being strict, the law does not describe the transmittance through a medium, but the propagation within that medium. It can be made compatible with Maxwell's equations if the transmittance of a sample with solute is ratioed against the transmittance of the pure solvent which explains why it works so well in <a href="Spectrophotometry%2C%20ultraviolet">spectrophotometry</a>. As this is not possible for pure media, the uncritical employment of the Beer–Lambert law can easily generate errors of the order of 100% or more. In such cases it is necessary to apply the <a href="Transfer-matrix%20method%20%28optics%29">Transfer-matrix method</a>.

Beer–Lambert law can be applied to the analysis of a mixture by <a href="spectrophotometry">spectrophotometry</a>, without the need for extensive pre-processing of the sample. An example is the determination of <a href="bilirubin">bilirubin</a> in blood plasma samples. The spectrum of pure bilirubin is known, so the molar attenuation coefficient "ε" is known. Measurements of decadic attenuation coefficient "μ" are made at one wavelength "λ" that is nearly unique for bilirubin and at a second wavelength in order to correct for possible interferences. The amount concentration "c" is then given by

For a more complicated example, consider a mixture in solution containing two species at amount concentrations "c" and "c". The decadic attenuation coefficient at any wavelength "λ" is, given by

Therefore, measurements at two wavelengths yields two equations in two unknowns and will suffice to determine the amount concentrations "c" and "c" as long as the molar attenuation coefficient of the two components, "ε" and "ε" are known at both wavelengths. This two system equation can be solved using <a href="Cramer%27s%20rule">Cramer's rule</a>. In practice it is better to use <a href="linear%20least%20squares%20%28mathematics%29">linear least squares</a> to determine the two amount concentrations from measurements made at more than two wavelengths. Mixtures containing more than two components can be analyzed in the same way, using a minimum of "N" wavelengths for a mixture containing "N" components.

The law is used widely in <a href="infra-red%20spectroscopy">infra-red spectroscopy</a> and <a href="near-infrared%20spectroscopy">near-infrared spectroscopy</a> for analysis of <a href="polymer%20degradation">polymer degradation</a> and <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> (also in biological tissue) as well as to measure the <a href="concentration">concentration</a> of various compounds in different <a href="food">food</a> samples. The <a href="carbonyl%20group">carbonyl group</a> attenuation at about 6 micrometres can be detected quite easily, and degree of oxidation of the <a href="polymer">polymer</a> calculated.

This law is also applied to describe the attenuation of solar or stellar radiation as it travels through the atmosphere. In this case, there is scattering of radiation as well as absorption. The optical depth for a slant path is , where "τ" refers to a vertical path, "m" is called the <a href="airmass">relative airmass</a>, and for a plane-parallel atmosphere it is determined as where "θ" is the <a href="zenith%20angle">zenith angle</a> corresponding to the given path. The Beer–Lambert law for the atmosphere is usually written
where each "τ" is the optical depth whose subscript identifies the source of the absorption or scattering it describes:

"m" is the "optical mass" or "<a href="airmass">airmass</a> factor", a term approximately equal (for small and moderate values of "θ") to 1/cos "θ", where "θ" is the observed object's <a href="celestial%20coordinate%20system">zenith angle</a> (the angle measured from the direction perpendicular to the Earth's surface at the observation site). This equation can be used to retrieve "τ", the aerosol <a href="optical%20depth">optical thickness</a>, which is necessary for the correction of satellite images and also important in accounting for the role of aerosols in climate.

The Beach Boys

The Beach Boys are an American <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> band formed in <a href="Hawthorne%2C%20California">Hawthorne, California</a>, in 1961. The group's <a href="The%20Beach%20Boys%20lineups">original lineup</a> consisted of brothers <a href="Brian%20Wilson">Brian</a>, <a href="Dennis%20Wilson">Dennis</a>, and <a href="Carl%20Wilson">Carl Wilson</a>; their cousin <a href="Mike%20Love">Mike Love</a>; and their friend <a href="Al%20Jardine">Al Jardine</a>. Distinguished by their <a href="vocal%20harmony">vocal harmonies</a> and early <a href="surf%20music">surf songs</a>, they are one of the <a href="Cultural%20impact%20of%20the%20Beach%20Boys">most influential acts of the rock era</a>. The group, led by their principal songwriter and producer Brian, pioneered novel approaches to <a href="popular%20music">popular</a> <a href="musical%20form">music form</a> and <a href="record%20producer">production</a>, combining their affinities for <a href="jazz">jazz</a>-based <a href="vocal%20group">vocal group</a>s, 1950s <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a>, and black <a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> to create their unique sound. He later <a href="arranged">arranged</a> his compositions for <a href="studio%20orchestra">studio orchestra</a>s and explored a variety of other styles, often incorporating <a href="classical%20music">classical</a> or jazz elements and <a href="Recording%20studio%20as%20musical%20instrument">unconventional recording techniques</a> in innovative ways.

The Beach Boys began as a <a href="garage%20band">garage band</a> managed by the Wilsons' father <a href="Murry%20Wilson">Murry</a>, with Brian's <a href="Musicianship%20of%20Brian%20Wilson">increasingly sophisticated songwriting and recording abilities</a> dominating their creative direction. Emerging at the vanguard of the "<a href="California%20Sound">California Sound</a>", they performed original material that reflected a <a href="southern%20California">southern California</a> <a href="youth%20culture">youth culture</a> of <a href="surfing">surfing</a>, cars, and romance. After 1964, they abandoned the surfing aesthetic for more personal lyrics and <a href="Wall%20of%20Sound">multi-layered sounds</a>. In 1966, the "<a href="Pet%20Sounds">Pet Sounds</a>" album and "<a href="Good%20Vibrations">Good Vibrations</a>" single vaulted the group to the top level of rock innovators and established the band as symbols of the <a href="counterculture%20of%20the%201960s">nascent counterculture era</a>. Following the <a href="Collapse%20of%20Smile">dissolution</a> of the group's "<a href="Smile%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20album%29">Smile</a>" project in 1967, Brian gradually ceded production and songwriting duties to the rest of the band, reducing his input because of <a href="mental%20health">mental health</a> and <a href="substance%20abuse">substance abuse</a> issues. The group's public image subsequently faltered, and despite efforts to continue their <a href="psychedelic%20music">psychedelic</a> ventures and reclaim their <a href="hippie">hippie</a> audiences, they were dismissed as an embodiment of the values and outlooks shared by early 1960s <a href="Stereotypes%20of%20white%20Americans">white, suburban teenagers</a>.

The continued success of their <a href="greatest%20hits%20album">greatest hits album</a>s during the mid 1970s precipitated the band's transition into an <a href="oldies">oldies</a> act, a move that was <a href="Cultural%20impact%20of%20the%20Beach%20Boys%23Critical%20assessment%20and%20rejection">denigrated by critics and many fans</a>. Since the 1980s, much-publicized legal wrangling over royalties, <a href="Love%20v.%20Wilson">songwriting credits</a> and use of the band's name transpired. Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998. After Carl's death, many <a href="The%20Beach%20Boys%20%28touring%20band%29">live configurations of the band</a> fronted by Mike Love and <a href="Bruce%20Johnston">Bruce Johnston</a> continued to tour into the 2000s while other members pursued solo projects. Even though Wilson and Jardine have not performed with Love and Johnston's band since their <a href="The%20Beach%20Boys%2050th%20Anniversary%20Reunion%20Tour">one-off 2012 reunion tour</a>, they remain a part of the Beach Boys' corporation, <a href="Brother%20Records">Brother Records Inc</a>.

The Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed, commercially successful, and widely influential bands of all time. The group had over eighty songs chart worldwide, thirty-six of them US <a href="Top%2040">Top 40</a> hits (the most by an American rock band), four reaching number-one on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> chart. The Beach Boys have sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20music%20artists">world's best-selling bands of all time</a> and are listed at No. 12 on "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine's 2004 list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". The core quintet of the three Wilsons, Love and Jardine were inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 1988.
At the time of his sixteenth birthday on June 20, 1958, Brian Wilson shared a bedroom with his brothers, <a href="Dennis%20Wilson">Dennis</a> and <a href="Carl%20Wilson">Carl</a> – aged thirteen and eleven, respectively – in their family home in <a href="Hawthorne%2C%20California">Hawthorne</a>. He had watched his father, <a href="Murry%20Wilson">Murry Wilson</a>, play piano, and had listened intently to the harmonies of vocal groups such as <a href="the%20Four%20Freshmen">the Four Freshmen</a>. After dissecting songs such as "<a href="Ivory%20Tower%20%281956%20song%29">Ivory Tower</a>" and "<a href="Good%20News%20%28musical%29">Good News</a>", Brian would teach family members how to sing the background harmonies. For his birthday that year, Brian received a <a href="Reel-to-reel%20audio%20tape%20recording">reel-to-reel tape recorder</a>. He learned how to <a href="overdub">overdub</a>, using his vocals and those of Carl and their mother. Brian played piano with Carl and <a href="David%20Marks">David Marks</a>, an eleven-year-old longtime neighbor, playing guitars they had each received as Christmas presents.

Soon Brian and Carl were avidly listening to <a href="Johnny%20Otis">Johnny Otis</a>' <a href="KFOX%20%28AM%29">KFOX radio</a> show. Inspired by the simple structure and vocals of the <a href="rhythm%20and%20blues">rhythm and blues</a> songs he heard, Brian changed his piano-playing style and started writing songs. His enthusiasm interfered with his music studies at school. Family gatherings brought the Wilsons in contact with cousin <a href="Mike%20Love">Mike Love</a>. Brian taught Love's sister Maureen and a friend harmonies. Later, Brian, Mike Love and two friends performed at <a href="Hawthorne%20High%20School%20%28Hawthorne%2C%20California%29">Hawthorne High School</a>. Brian also knew <a href="Al%20Jardine">Al Jardine</a>, a high school classmate. Brian suggested to Jardine that they team up with his cousin and brother Carl. Love gave the fledgling band its name: "The Pendletones", a portmanteau of "<a href="Pendleton%20Woolen%20Mills">Pendleton</a>", a style of woolen shirt popular at the time and "<a href="Musical%20tone">tone</a>", the musical term. Though <a href="surfing">surfing</a> motifs were prominent in their early songs, Dennis was the only avid surfer in the group. He suggested that the group compose songs that celebrated the sport and the lifestyle that it had inspired in <a href="Southern%20California">Southern California</a>.

Jardine and a singer friend, Gary Winfrey, went to Brian to see if he could help out with a version of a folk song they wanted to record – "<a href="Sloop%20John%20B">Sloop John B</a>". In Brian's absence, the two spoke with his father, a music industry veteran of modest success. Murry arranged for the Pendletones to meet his publisher, Hite Morgan. The group performed a slower ballad, "<a href="Their%20Hearts%20Were%20Full%20of%20Spring">Their Hearts Were Full of Spring</a>", but failed to impress Morgan. After an awkward pause, Dennis mentioned they had an original song, "<a href="Surfin%27%20%28song%29">Surfin'</a>". Brian finished the song, and together with Mike Love, wrote "<a href="Surfin%27%20Safari%20%28song%29">Surfin' Safari</a>". The group rented guitars, drums, amplifiers and microphones, and practiced for three days while the Wilsons' parents were on a short vacation.

In October 1961, the Pendletones recorded the two surfing song demos in twelve takes at Keen Recording Studio. Murry brought the demos to Herb Newman, owner of <a href="Candix%20Records">Candix Records</a> and <a href="Era%20Records">Era Records</a>, and he signed the group on December 8, 1961. When the boys eagerly unpacked the first box of singles – released both under the Candix label, and also as a promo issue under X Records (Morgan's label) – they were shocked to see their band had been renamed as the Beach Boys. Murry Wilson learned that Candix wanted to name the group the Surfers to directly associate them with the increasingly popular teen sport. But <a href="Russ%20Regan">Russ Regan</a>, a young promoter with Era Records – who later became president of <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox%20Records">20th Century Fox Records</a> – noted that there already existed a group by that name, and he suggested calling them the Beach Boys.

Released in December 1961, "<a href="Surfin%27">Surfin'</a>" soon aired on <a href="KFWB">KFWB</a> and <a href="KRLA">KRLA</a>, two of Los Angeles' most influential teen radio stations. It was a hit on the West Coast, going to number three in Southern California, and peaked at number 75 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. By the final weeks of 1961 "Surfin'" had sold more than 40,000 copies. By this time the <a href="de%20facto">de facto</a> manager of the Beach Boys, Murry Wilson landed the group's first paying gig (for which they earned $300) on New Year's Eve, 1961, at the <a href="Ritchie%20Valens">Ritchie Valens</a> Memorial Dance in <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach</a>, headlined by <a href="Ike%20%26amp%3B%20Tina%20Turner">Ike & Tina Turner</a>. In their earliest public appearances, the band wore heavy wool jacket-like shirts that local surfers favored before switching to their trademark striped shirts and white pants. Murry effectively seized managerial control of the band, and Brian acknowledged that he "deserves credit for getting us off the ground ... he hounded us mercilessly ... [but] also worked hard himself."

In the first half of February 1962, Jardine left the band and was replaced by Marks. The band recorded two more originals on April 19 at Western Studios, Los Angeles: "Lonely Sea" and "<a href="409%20%28song%29">409</a>". They also re-recorded "<a href="Surfin%27%20Safari%20%28song%29">Surfin' Safari</a>". During early 1962, Morgan requested that some of the members add vocals to a couple of instrumental tracks that he had recorded with other musicians. This led to the creation of the short-lived group Kenny & the Cadets, which Brian led under the pseudonym "Kenny". The other members were Carl, Jardine, and the Wilsons' mother Audree.

On June 4, the Beach Boys released their second single "Surfin' Safari" backed with "409". The release prompted national coverage in the June 9 issue of "<a href="Billboard%20Magazine">Billboard</a>". The magazine praised Love's lead vocal and said the song had strong hit potential. On July 16, 1962 – after being turned down by <a href="Dot%20Records">Dot</a> and <a href="Liberty%20Records">Liberty</a> – the Beach Boys signed a seven-year contract with <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>, based on the strength of the June demo session. This was at the urging of Capitol exec <a href="Nick%20Venet">Nick Venet</a> who signed the group, seeing them as the "teenage gold" he had been scouting for. By November, their first album was ready – "Surfin' Safari", which reached 32 on the US Billboard charts. Their song output continued along the same commercial line, focusing on California youth lifestyle.

In January 1963, three months after the release of their debut album, the band began recording their sophomore effort, "Surfin' U.S.A.", a breakthrough for Brian, who began asserting himself as songwriter and arranger. The LP was the start of Brian's penchant for <a href="doubletracking">doubletracking</a> vocals, a pioneering innovation. Released on March 25, 1963, "Surfin' U.S.A.", met a more enthusiastic reception, reaching number two on the Billboard charts. This propelled the band into a nationwide spotlight, and was vital to launching surf music as a national craze. Five days prior to the release of "Surfin' U.S.A.", Brian produced "<a href="Surf%20City%20%28song%29">Surf City</a>", a song he had written for <a href="Jan%20and%20Dean">Jan and Dean</a>. "Surf City" hit number one on the "Billboard" charts in July 1963, a development that pleased Brian but angered Murry, who felt his son had "given away" what should have been the Beach Boys' first chart-topper.

At the beginning of a tour of the Mid-West in April 1963, Jardine rejoined the Beach Boys at Brian's request. Although he had started playing live gigs again, Brian soon left the road to focus on writing and recording. The result of this arrangement produced the albums "Surfer Girl", released on September 16, 1963 and "Little Deuce Coupe", released less than a month later on October 7, 1963. This sextet incarnation of the Beach Boys did not extend beyond these two albums, as Marks officially left the band in early October because of conflict with manager Murry, pulling Brian back into touring.

Around this time, Brian began using members of <a href="The%20Wrecking%20Crew%20%28music%29">the Wrecking Crew</a> to augment his increasingly demanding studio arrangements. Session musicians that participated on Wilson's productions were said to have been awestruck by his musical abilities. The band released a standalone Christmas-themed single, "<a href="Little%20Saint%20Nick">Little Saint Nick</a>", in December 1963, backed with an <a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a> rendition of the <a href="Lord%27s%20Prayer">scriptural</a> song "<a href="The%20Lord%27s%20Prayer%20%281935%20song%29">The Lord's Prayer</a>". The A-side peaked at No. 3 on the US "Billboard" Christmas chart.

Following a successful Australasian tour in January and February 1964, the band returned home to face the <a href="British%20Invasion">British Invasion</a> through the Beatles appearances on "<a href="The%20Ed%20Sullivan%20Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a>". Also representing the Beatles, Capitol support for the Beach Boys immediately began waning. This caused Murry to fight for the band at the label more than before, often visiting their offices without warning to "twist executive arms." The band finished the sessions on February 20, 1964 and titled the album "Shut Down Volume 2". "<a href="Fun%2C%20Fun%2C%20Fun">Fun, Fun, Fun</a>" was released as a single from the album (backed with "<a href="Why%20Do%20Fools%20Fall%20in%20Love%20%28song%29">Why Do Fools Fall in Love</a>") and was a major hit. The LP, while containing several <a href="filler%20%28media%29">filler tracks</a>, was propelled by other songs such as the melancholic "<a href="The%20Warmth%20of%20the%20Sun">The Warmth of the Sun</a>" and the advanced production style of "<a href="Don%27t%20Worry%20Baby">Don't Worry Baby</a>".

Brian soon wrote his last surf song in April 1964. That month, during recording of the single "<a href="I%20Get%20Around">I Get Around</a>", Murry was relieved of his duties as manager. Brian reflected, "We love the family thing – y'know: three brothers, a cousin and a friend is a really beautiful way to have a group – but the extra generation can become a hang-up." When the single was released in May of that year, it would climb to number one, their first single to do so, proving that the Beach Boys could compete with contemporaneous British pop groups. Two months later, the album that the song appeared on, "All Summer Long", reached No. 4 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> charts. "All Summer Long" introduced exotic textures to the Beach Boys' sound exemplified by the <a href="piccolo">piccolo</a>s and <a href="xylophone">xylophone</a>s of <a href="All%20Summer%20Long%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20song%29">its title track</a>. The album was a swan-song to the surf and car music the Beach Boys built their commercial standing upon. Later albums took a different stylistic and lyrical path. Before this, a live album, "<a href="Beach%20Boys%20Concert">Beach Boys Concert</a>", was released in October to a four-week chart stay at number one, containing a set list of previously recorded hits and <a href="cover%20version">covers</a> that they had not yet recorded.

In June 1964, Brian began recording the bulk of "The Beach Boys' Christmas Album" with a forty-one-piece studio orchestra in collaboration with <a href="The%20Four%20Freshmen">Four Freshmen</a> arranger <a href="Dick%20Reynolds%20%28musician%29">Dick Reynolds</a>. Released in December, it was divided between five new, original Christmas-themed songs, and seven reinterpretations of traditional Christmas songs. It would be regarded as one of the finest <a href="holiday%20album">holiday album</a>s of the rock era. One single from the album, "<a href="The%20Man%20with%20All%20the%20Toys">The Man with All the Toys</a>", was released, peaking at No. 6 on the US "Billboard" Christmas chart. On October 29, the Beach Boys performed for "<a href="The%20T.A.M.I.%20Show">The T.A.M.I. Show</a>", a concert film intended to bring together a wide range of hit-making musicians for a one-off performance. The result was released to movie theaters one month later.

By the end of the year, the stress of road travel, composing, producing and maintaining a high level of creativity became too much for Brian. On December 23, while on a flight from Los Angeles to Houston, he suffered a <a href="panic%20attack">panic attack</a> only hours after performing with the Beach Boys on the <a href="variety%20show">musical variety series</a> "<a href="Shindig%21">Shindig!</a>". In January 1965, he announced his withdrawal from touring to concentrate entirely on songwriting and record production. For the rest of 1964 and into 1965, <a href="Glen%20Campbell">Glen Campbell</a> served as Wilson's temporary replacement in concert, until his own career success pulled him from touring with the group in April 1965. Bruce Johnston was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston himself became a full-time member of the band on May 19, 1965, first replacing Brian on the road and later contributing in the studio, beginning with the vocal sessions for "<a href="California%20Girls">California Girls</a>" on June 4, 1965.

After Brian stopped touring in 1965, he became a full-time studio artist, showcasing a great leap forward with "The Beach Boys Today!", an album containing a suite-like structure divided by songs and <a href="ballad">ballad</a>s, and portended the <a href="Album%20Era">Album Era</a> with its cohesive artistic statement. During the recording sessions for "Today!", Love told <a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a> that he and the band wanted to look beyond <a href="surf%20rock">surf rock</a> and to avoid living in the past or resting on their laurels. The resulting LP had largely guitar-oriented pop songs such as "<a href="Dance%2C%20Dance%2C%20Dance%20%28song%29">Dance, Dance, Dance</a>" and "<a href="Good%20to%20My%20Baby">Good to My Baby</a>" on side A with B-side ballads such as "<a href="Please%20Let%20Me%20Wonder">Please Let Me Wonder</a>" and "<a href="She%20Knows%20Me%20Too%20Well">She Knows Me Too Well</a>".

"Today!" established the Beach Boys as album artists and marked a maturation in their lyric content by abandoning themes related to surfing, cars, or teenage love. Some love songs remained, but with a marked increase in depth, along with introspective tracks accompanied by adventurous and distinct arrangements. While the band's contemporaries grew more intellectually aware, Capitol continued to bill them as "America’s Top Surfin' Group!" expecting Brian to write more surfing material for the yearly summer markets despite his disinterest.

In June 1965, the band released "Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)". The album included a reworked arrangement of "<a href="Help%20Me%2C%20Rhonda">Help Me, Rhonda</a>" which became the band's second number one single in the spring of 1965, displacing the Beatles' "<a href="Ticket%20to%20Ride">Ticket to Ride</a>". "<a href="Let%20Him%20Run%20Wild">Let Him Run Wild</a>" tapped into the youthful angst that later pervaded their music. In November 1965, the group followed their US number-three-charting "California Girls" from "Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)" with another top-twenty single, "<a href="The%20Little%20Girl%20I%20Once%20Knew">The Little Girl I Once Knew</a>". It was considered the band's most experimental statement thus far, using silence as a pre-chorus, clashing keyboards, moody brass and vocal tics. The single continued Brian's ambitions for daring arrangements, featuring unexpected tempo changes and numerous false endings. Perhaps too extreme an arrangement to go much higher than its number 20 peak, it was the band's second single not to reach the top ten since their 1962 breakthrough.

Capitol demanded a Beach Boys LP for the 1965 Christmas season, and to appease them, Brian conceived "Beach Boys' Party!", a live-in-the-studio album consisting mostly of acoustic covers of 1950s rock and R&B songs, in addition to covers of three Beatles songs, <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>'s "<a href="The%20Times%20They%20Are%20a-Changin%27%20%28song%29">The Times They Are a-Changin'</a>", and idiosyncratic rerecordings of the group's earlier hits. In December they scored an unexpected number two hit (number three in the UK) with "<a href="Barbara%20Ann">Barbara Ann</a>", which Capitol released as a single with no band input. Originally by <a href="The%20Regents%20%28doo-wop%20band%29">the Regents</a>, it became one of the Beach Boys' most recognized hits.

In 1966, the Beach Boys formally established their use of unconventional instruments and elaborate layers of vocal harmonies on their album "Pet Sounds". It is considered Brian's most concise demonstration of his production and songwriting expertise. With songs such as "<a href="Wouldn%27t%20It%20Be%20Nice">Wouldn't It Be Nice</a>" and "<a href="Sloop%20John%20B">Sloop John B</a>", the album's innovative <a href="soundscape">soundscape</a> incorporates elements of <a href="jazz%20music">jazz</a>, <a href="classical%20music">classical</a>, pop, <a href="exotica">exotica</a>, and the <a href="avant-garde%20music">avant-garde</a>. The instrumentation combines <a href="found%20sound">found sound</a>s such as <a href="bicycle%20bell">bicycle bell</a>s and dog whistles with classically inspired orchestrations and the usual rock set-up of drums and guitars; among others, <a href="silver%20%28household%29">silverware</a>, <a href="accordion">accordion</a>s, plucked piano strings, barking dogs, and plastic water jugs. For the basic rhythmic feel for "<a href="God%20Only%20Knows">God Only Knows</a>", <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a>, piano with <a href="slapback%20echo">slapback echo</a>, <a href="sleigh%20bell">sleigh bell</a>s, and <a href="string%20section">strings</a> <a href="spill%20%28audio%29">spilled</a> into each other to create a rich blanket of sound.

Released in May, "Pet Sounds" peaked at No. 10 in the US and No. 2 in the UK. This helped the Beach Boys become the strongest selling album group in the UK for the final quarter of 1966, dethroning the three-year reign of native bands such as the Beatles. Met with a lukewarm critical reception in the US, "Pet Sounds" was indifferently promoted by Capitol and failed to become the major hit Wilson had hoped it would be. Its failure to gain a wider recognition in the U.S. combined with Capitol's decision to issue "<a href="Best%20of%20The%20Beach%20Boys">Best of The Beach Boys</a>" in July dispirited Brian, who considered "Pet Sounds" an extremely personal work. Some assumed that the label considered the album a risk, appealing more to an older demographic than the younger, female audience the Beach Boys built their commercial standing on. "Pet Sounds" sales numbered approximately 500,000 units, a significant drop-off from the chain of million-selling albums that immediately preceded it. "Best of The Beach Boys" was quickly certified Gold by the <a href="RIAA">RIAA</a>.

"Pet Sounds" is considered by some as a Brian Wilson solo album in all but name, as other members contributed relatively little to the compositions or recordings. Influenced by <a href="psychedelic%20drug">psychedelic drug</a>s, Brian turned inward and probed his deep-seated self-doubts and emotional longings; the piece did not address the problems in the world around them, unlike other <a href="psychedelic%20rock">psychedelic rock</a> groups. As <a href="Jim%20Miller%20%28musician%29">Jim Miller</a> wrote of the album's tone, "[It] vented Wilson's obsession with isolation cataloging a forlorn quest for security. The whole enterprise, which smacked of <a href="song%20cycle">song cycle</a> pretensions, was streaked with regret and romantic languor." According to Brian, the album was designed as a collection of art pieces that belong together yet could stand alone. In a 1972 retrospective review of the album, music journalist <a href="Stephen%20Davis%20%28music%20journalist%29">Stephen Davis</a> wrote: "From first cut to last we were treated to an intense, linear personal vision of the vagaries of a love affair and the painful, introverted anxieties that are the wrenching precipitates of the unstable chemistry of any love relationship. This trenchant cycle of love songs has the emotional impact of a shatteringly evocative novel ... nobody was prepared for anything so soulful, so lovely, something one had to think about so much."

"Pet Sounds" was massively influential upon its release, vaunting the band to the top level of rock innovators. It is one of the earliest rock concept albums, one of the earliest concept albums of the <a href="counterculture%20of%20the%201960s">counterculture era</a>, and an early album in the emerging psychedelic rock style, signaling a turning point wherein rock, which previously had been considered dance music, became music that was made for listening to. In 2016, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s Barbara Ellen reflected that the album was "hailed as a revolution in harmonies and production techniques ... Wilson single-handedly reinvented the album as the in-depth illumination of an artist’s soul, kicking open a creative fire-door, liberating the album to exist as a self-contained art form on a par with literature, theatre, art, cinema, dance… anything the artist desired." Reflecting on the album on its 50th anniversary, "PopMatters" Danilo Castro added:

In "The Album: A Guide to Pop Music's Most Provocative, Influential, and Important Creations", author James Perone championed the album for its complex orchestrations, sophisticated compositions, and varied <a href="tone%20color">tone color</a>s, calling it a remove from "just about anything else that was going on in 1966 pop music." In 1976, journalist <a href="Robin%20Denselow">Robin Denselow</a> wrote: "With the 1966 "Pet Sounds" album ... Wilson had become America's equivalent of the Beatles with his ability to expand the limits of popular taste." <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> named it one of his favorite albums of all time on multiple occasions, calling it the primary impetus for the Beatles' album "<a href="Sgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>" (1967). In 2003, "Pet Sounds" was ranked second in "<a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>" list selected by "Rolling Stone", behind only "Sgt. Pepper". In 2004, the album was acknowledged as an important historical and cultural work by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>.

Seeking to expand on "Pet Sounds"' advances, Wilson began an even more ambitious project: "<a href="Good%20Vibrations">Good Vibrations</a>". Like "Pet Sounds", Brian opted for an eclectic array of instruments rarely heard in pop music. Described by Brian as a "<a href="pocket%20symphony">pocket symphony</a>", it contains a mixture of classical, rock, and exotic instruments structured around a <a href="cut-up%20technique">cut-up mosaic</a> of musical sections represented by several discordant key and modal shifts. It became the Beach Boys' biggest hit to date, and a US and UK number one single in 1966. Coming at a time when pop singles were usually made in under two hours, it was one of the most complex pop productions ever undertaken, and the most expensive single ever recorded to that point. The production costs were estimated between $50,000 and $75,000 ($ and $ today) with sessions for the song stretching over several months in at least four major studios. According to <a href="Domenic%20Priore">Domenic Priore</a>, the making of "Good Vibrations" was unlike anything previous in the realms of classical, jazz, international, soundtrack, or any other kind of recording.

The single was an unequivocal milestone in studio productions, and continued in establishing Brian as an extender of popular tastes. To the counterculture of the 1960s, "Good Vibrations" served as an anthem. Rock critic Gene Sculatti prophesied in 1968, "[It] may yet prove to be the most significantly revolutionary piece of the current rock renaissance." Its instrumentation included <a href="Paul%20Tanner">Paul Tanner</a>'s <a href="Electro-Theremin">Electro-Theremin</a>, a manually-operated oscillator with a sound similar to a <a href="theremin">theremin</a>, which helped the Beach Boys claim a new <a href="hippie">hippie</a> audience. Upon release, the single prompted an unexpected revival in theremins while increasing awareness of <a href="analog%20synthesizer">analog synthesizer</a>s, leading <a href="Moog%20Music">Moog Music</a> to produce their own brand of <a href="ribbon%20controller">ribbon-controlled</a> instruments. Reflecting on this period in 1971, "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">Cue</a>" magazine wrote: "In the year and a half that followed "Pet Sounds", the Beach Boys were among the vanguard in practically every aspect of the counter culture – psychedelia, <a href="art%20rock">art rock</a>, a return to roots, ecology, organic food, the cooled-out sound – anticipating changes that rock didn't accomplish until 1969–1970."
The group established a short-lived film <a href="production%20company">production company</a>, called Home Movies, during this time. It was supposed to have created live action film and television properties starring the Beach Boys. However, the company completed only one music video, for "Good Vibrations", though various other psychedelic sequences and segments exist.

Brian met lyricist and musician <a href="Van%20Dyke%20Parks">Van Dyke Parks</a> while working on "Pet Sounds". A year later, while in the midst of recording "Good Vibrations", the duo began an intense collaboration that resulted in a suite of challenging new songs for the Beach Boys forthcoming album "Smile", intended to surpass "Pet Sounds". Recording for the album spanned about a year, from 1966 to 1967. Wilson and Parks intended "Smile" to be a continuous suite of songs that were linked both thematically and musically, with the main songs being linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated upon the musical themes of the major songs. Surviving recordings have shown that the music incorporated <a href="chanting">chanting</a>, <a href="cowboy%20song">cowboy song</a>s, explorations in <a href="Native%20American%20music">Indian</a> and <a href="Hawaiian%20music">Hawaiian music</a>, jazz, <a href="tone%20poem">tone poem</a>s with classical elements, <a href="cartoon">cartoon</a> sound effects, "<a href="musique%20concr%C3%A8te">musique concrète</a>", and <a href="yodeling">yodeling</a>.

In October 1966 interviews, Brian touted the album as "a teenage symphony to God". His spiritual aims were made explicit in the album's musical contents and lyrics, which also included existential angst, the exploration of human innocence, and the philosophy of childlikeness. Parks has stated: he and Brian were conscious of the counterculture, and the two had felt estranged from it, but it was necessary to adhere to because of a willingness to "get out of the <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Eisenhower</a> mindset." Parks stresses, "At the same time, he didn't want to lose that kind of gauche sensibility that he had. He was doing stuff that nobody would dream of doing," citing an instance when Brian instructed a banjo player to play only one string, a "gauche" style of playing that "just wasn't done."

"Smile" would go on to become the most legendary unreleased album in the history of popular music. In the decades following its non-release, it became the subject of intense speculation and mystique. Many believe that, had the album been released, it would have substantially altered the group's direction and established them at the vanguard of rock innovators. Writing about the album for the <a href="33%E2%85%93">33⅓</a> book series, Luis Sanchez stated: "If Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys were going to survive as the defining force of American pop music they were, "Smile" was a conscious attempt to rediscover the impulses and ideas that power American consciousness from the inside out. It was a collaboration that led to some incredible music, which, if it had been completed as an album and delivered to the public in 1966, might have had an incredible impact."

If released when intended, composer Frank Oteri believes the album would have been the first piece of <a href="album-oriented%20rock">album-oriented rock</a>. Its cover artwork, now considered iconic, depicted an illustration of a store selling smiles, also would have been among the earliest covers by a popular music group to feature original, specifically commissioned artwork rather than a photograph of the performers. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, <a href="bootleg%20recording">bootlegs</a> from its recording sessions leaked, inspiring many attempts to reassemble the album, and ultimately becoming a progenitor for <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a>.

Many factors <a href="Collapse%20of%20Smile">combined to put intense pressure on Brian Wilson</a> as "Smile" neared completion: his mental instability, the pressure to create despite fierce internal opposition to his new music, the relatively unenthusiastic response to "Pet Sounds" in the United States, and Carl Wilson's <a href="military%20draft">draft</a> resistance. Furthermore, Wilson's reliance on both prescription drugs and <a href="amphetamine">amphetamine</a>s exacerbated his underlying mental health problems. Comparable to <a href="Brian%20Jones">Brian Jones</a> and <a href="Syd%20Barrett">Syd Barrett</a>, Brian Wilson's use of psychedelic drugs led to a nervous breakdown in the late-1960s. As his legend grew, the "Smile" period came to be seen as the pivotal episode in his decline, and he became tagged as a drug casualty.

Some "Smile" tracks were salvaged and re-recorded in scaled-down versions at <a href="Brian%20Wilson%27s%20home%20studio">Brian's new home studio</a>. Along with the single version of "Good Vibrations", these tracks were released on the September 1967 album "Smiley Smile", which elicited positive critical and commercial response abroad, but was the first real commercial failure for the group in the U.S. Compounding the group's recent setbacks, their public image took a cataclysmic hit following their withdrawal from the 1967 <a href="Monterey%20Pop%20Festival">Monterey Pop Festival</a> for the reason that they had no new material to play while their forthcoming single and album lay in limbo. Their cancellation was seen as "...a damning admission that they were washed up [and] unable to compete with the new music." This notion was exacerbated by "Rolling Stone" writer <a href="Jann%20Wenner">Jann Wenner</a>, who in contemporary publications criticized Brian Wilson for his oft-repeated "genius" label, which he called a "promotional shuck" and an attempt to compare him with the Beatles.

While being interviewed in August 1967 for the aborted live album "<a href="Lei%27d%20in%20Hawaii">Lei'd in Hawaii</a>", Brian stated: "I think rock n' roll–the pop scene–is happening. It’s great. But I think basically, the Beach Boys are squares. We’re not happening." Former band publicist <a href="Derek%20Taylor">Derek Taylor</a> later recalled a conversation with Brian and Dennis where they denied that the group had ever written surf music or songs about cars, and that the Beach Boys had never been involved with the surf and hot rod fads, as Taylor claimed, "...they would not concede." As a result of their initial target demographic and subsequent failures to blend with the hippie movement, the group was viewed as unhip relics, even though they had once been, as biographer <a href="Peter%20Ames%20Carlin">Peter Ames Carlin</a> wrote, "the absolute center of the American rock ’n’ roll scene," a time when they had ushered the psychedelic era. In early 1969, Brian proposed that the group change their name from "the Beach Boys" to "the Beach", reasoning that the band members were now grown men. Going to the effort of acquiring a contract that would declare a five-way agreement to officially rename the group, <a href="Stephen%20Desper">Stephen Desper</a> reported, "They all just kind of shrugged and said, 'Aw, come on, Brian, we don't wanna do that. That's how the public knows us, man. And that was it. He put the paper on the piano and it stayed there until I picked it up and took it away."

In 1966, the group had filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles Superior Court against Capitol Records for over two million dollars, which briefly severed their relationship with the label. At this time the Beach Boys' management (Nick Grillo and <a href="David%20Anderle">David Anderle</a>) created the band's own record label, <a href="Brother%20Records">Brother</a>. One of the first labels owned by a rock group The initial output of the label, however, was limited to "Smiley Smile" and two resulting singles from the album.

After the cancellation of "Smile", some of its tracks continued to trickle out in later albums often as <a href="filler%20%28media%29">filler songs</a> to offset Brian's unwillingness to contribute. "Smiley Smile" was followed up three months later with "<a href="Wild%20Honey%20%28album%29">Wild Honey</a>", featuring mostly new songs written by Wilson and Love, including the number-nineteen single "<a href="Darlin%27%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20song%29">Darlin'</a>". The album fared better than its predecessor, reaching No. 24 in the U.S. Wenner responded to the new album with more optimism, remarking two months later that "[in] any case it's good to see that the Beach Boys are getting their heads straight once again".

After meeting <a href="Maharishi%20Mahesh%20Yogi">Maharishi Mahesh Yogi</a> at a <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> Variety Gala in Paris, France on December 15, 1967, Love, along with other high-profile celebrities such as <a href="Donovan">Donovan</a> and <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a> traveled to <a href="Rishikesh">Rishikesh</a> in India during February and March 1968. The following Beach Boys album "Friends" (1968) had songs influenced by the <a href="Transcendental%20Meditation">Transcendental Meditation</a> taught by the Maharishi. The album reached No. 13 in the UK and 126 in the US, <a href="Friends%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20song%29">the title track</a> placing at No. 25 in the UK and No. 47 in the US, the band's lowest singles peak since 1962. In support of the "Friends" album, Love had arranged for the Beach Boys to tour with the Maharishi in the U.S., which has been called "one of the more bizarre entertainments of the era." Starting on May 3, 1968, the tour lasted five shows and was cancelled when the Maharishi had to withdraw to fulfill film contracts. Because of disappointing audience numbers and the Maharishi's withdrawal, twenty-four tour dates were subsequently canceled at a cost estimated at US$250,000 (approximately US$ today) for the band. This tour was followed by the release of "<a href="Do%20It%20Again%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20song%29">Do It Again</a>", a single that critics described as an update of the Beach Boys' surf rock past in a late 1960s style. The single went to the top of the Australian and UK single charts in 1968 and was moderately successful in the US, peaking at No. 20.

For a short time in mid-1968, Brian Wilson sought psychological treatment in hospital. During his absence, other members began writing and producing material themselves. To complete their contract with Capitol, they produced one more album. "20/20" (1969) was one of the group's most stylistically diverse albums, including <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> songs such as "<a href="All%20I%20Want%20to%20Do%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20song%29">All I Want to Do</a>", the <a href="waltz">waltz</a>-based "<a href="Time%20to%20Get%20Alone">Time to Get Alone</a>", and a cover of <a href="the%20Ronettes">the Ronettes</a>' "<a href="I%20Can%20Hear%20Music">I Can Hear Music</a>". The diversity of genres have been described as an indicator that the group was trying to establish an updated identity. The album performed strongly in the UK, reaching number three on the charts. In the US, the album reached a modest 68.

In spring 1968, Dennis began a strained <a href="Manson%20Family%23Involvement%20with%20Wilson%2C%20Melcher%2C%20et%20al.">relationship with musician</a> <a href="Charles%20Manson">Charles Manson</a>, which persisted for several months afterward. Dennis bought him time at Brian's home studio where recording sessions were attempted while Brian stayed in his room. Dennis then proposed that Manson be signed to Brother Records. Brian reportedly disliked Charlie, and so a deal was never made. Without Manson's involvement, the Beach Boys did record one song penned by Manson: "Cease to Exist", rewritten as "<a href="Never%20Learn%20Not%20to%20Love">Never Learn Not to Love</a>". The idea of the Beach Boys recording one of his songs reportedly thrilled Manson, and it was released as a Beach Boys single. After accruing a large monetary debt to the group, Dennis deliberately omitted Manson's credit on its release while also altering the song's arrangement and lyrics. This greatly angered Manson. Growing fearful, Dennis gradually distanced himself from Manson, <a href="Manson%20family">whose family</a> had taken over his home. He was eventually convicted for <a href="Conspiracy%20%28criminal%29">murder conspiracy</a>; from there on, Dennis was too afraid of the Manson family to ever speak publicly on his relationship, let alone testify against him.

On April 12, 1969, the band revisited their 1967 lawsuit against Capitol Records after they alleged an audit undertaken revealed the band were owed over US$2,000,000 (US$ today) for unpaid royalties and production duties. The band's contract with Capitol Records expired on June 30, 1969, after which Capitol Records deleted the Beach Boys' catalog from print, effectively cutting off their royalty flow. In November 1969, Murry Wilson sold <a href="Sea%20of%20Tunes">Sea of Tunes</a>, the Beach Boys' catalog, to Irving Almo Music, a decision that, according to <a href="Marilyn%20Wilson">Marilyn Wilson</a>, devastated Brian. In late 1969, the Beach Boys reactivated their Brother label and signed with <a href="Reprise%20Records">Reprise</a>. Around this time, the band commenced recording a new album. By the time the Beach Boys tenure ended with Capitol in 1969, they had sold 65 million records worldwide, closing the decade as the most commercially successful American group in popular music.

In 1970, armed with the new Reprise contract, the band appeared rejuvenated, releasing the album "Sunflower" to critical acclaim in the UK but indifference in the US. The album features a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all band members. Brian was active during this period, writing or co-writing seven of the twelve songs on "Sunflower" and performing at half of the band's domestic concerts in 1970. "Sunflower" reached number 29 in the UK and number 151 in the US, the band's lowest domestic chart showing to that point.

After "Sunflower", the band hired <a href="Jack%20Rieley">Jack Rieley</a> as their manager. Under Rieley's management, the group's music began emphasizing political and social awareness. During this time, Carl Wilson gradually assumed leadership of the band and Rieley contributed lyrics. On August 30, 1971 the band released "Surf's Up", named after the Brian Wilson/Van Dyke Parks composition "<a href="Surf%27s%20Up%20%28song%29">Surf's Up</a>". The album was moderately successful, reaching the US top 30, a marked improvement over their recent releases. While the record charted, the Beach Boys added to their renewed fame by performing a near-sellout set at <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a>, followed by an appearance with the <a href="Grateful%20Dead">Grateful Dead</a> at <a href="Fillmore%20East">Fillmore East</a> on April 27, 1971. The live shows during this era included reworked arrangements of many of the band's previous songs. A large portion of their <a href="set%20list">set list</a>s culled from "Pet Sounds" and "Smile", as author Domenic Priore observes, "They basically played what they could have played at the Monterey Pop Festival in the summer of 1967."

Johnston ended his first stint with the band shortly after "Surf's Up"'s release, reportedly because of friction with Rieley. At Carl's suggestion, the addition of <a href="Ricky%20Fataar">Ricky Fataar</a> and <a href="Blondie%20Chaplin">Blondie Chaplin</a> in February 1972 led to a dramatic restructuring in the band's sound. The album "Carl and the Passions – "So Tough"" was an uncharacteristic mix that included two songs written by Fataar and Chaplin.

For their next project the band, their families, assorted associates and technicians moved to the Netherlands for the summer of 1972. They rented a farmhouse to convert into a makeshift studio where recording sessions for the new project would take place. By the end of their sessions, the band felt they had produced one of their strongest efforts yet. Reprise, however, felt that the album required a strong single. This resulted in the song "<a href="Sail%20On%2C%20Sailor">Sail On, Sailor</a>", a collaboration between Brian Wilson, <a href="Tandyn%20Almer">Tandyn Almer</a>, <a href="Raymond%20Louis%20Kennedy">Ray Kennedy</a>, Jack Rieley and Van Dyke Parks featuring a soulful lead vocal by Chaplin. Reprise subsequently approved and the resulting album, "<a href="Holland%20%28album%29">Holland</a>", was released early in 1973, peaking at number 37. Brian's musical children story, "Mount Vernon and Fairway (A Fairy Tale)", narrated by Rieley and strongly influenced by <a href="Randy%20Newman">Randy Newman</a>'s "<a href="Sail%20Away%20%28Randy%20Newman%20album%29">Sail Away</a>" (1972), was included as a bonus <a href="extended%20play">EP</a>. Despite indifference from Reprise, the band's concert audience started to grow.

"<a href="The%20Beach%20Boys%20in%20Concert">The Beach Boys in Concert</a>", a double album documenting the 1972 and 1973 U.S. tours, was another top-30 album and became the band's first <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">gold record</a> under Reprise. During this period the band established itself as one of America's most popular live acts. Chaplin and Fataar helped organize the concerts to obtain a high quality live performance, playing material off "Surf's Up", "Carl and the Passions" and "Holland" and adding songs from their older catalog. This concert arrangement lifted them back into American public prominence. In late 1973, <a href="41%20Original%20Hits%20from%20the%20Soundtrack%20of%20American%20Graffiti">the 41-song soundtrack</a> to "<a href="American%20Graffiti">American Graffiti</a>" was released including the band's early songs "Surfin' Safari" and "All Summer Long". The album was a catalyst in creating a wave of nostalgia that reintroduced the Beach Boys into contemporary American consciousness. In 1974, Capitol Records issued "<a href="Endless%20Summer%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20album%29">Endless Summer</a>", the band's first major pre-"Pet Sounds" greatest hits package. The compilation surged to the top of the "Billboard" album charts and was the group's first multi-million selling record since "Good Vibrations". It remained on the charts for two years. Capitol followed with a second compilation, "<a href="Spirit%20of%20America%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20album%29">Spirit of America</a>", which also sold well. With these compilations, the Beach Boys became one of the most popular acts in rock, propelling themselves from opening for <a href="Crosby%2C%20Stills%2C%20Nash%20and%20Young">Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young</a> to headliners selling out basketball arenas in a matter of weeks. "Rolling Stone" named the Beach Boys the "Band of the Year" for 1974.

Rieley, who remained in the Netherlands after "Holland"s release, was relieved of his managerial duties in late 1973. Chaplin also left in late 1973 after an argument with Steve Love, the band's business manager (and Mike's brother). Fataar remained until 1974, when he was offered a chance to join a new group led by future <a href="Eagles%20%28band%29">Eagles</a> member <a href="Joe%20Walsh">Joe Walsh</a>. Chaplin's replacement, <a href="James%20William%20Guercio">James William Guercio</a>, started offering the group career advice that resulted in his becoming their new manager. Under Guercio, the Beach Boys staged a highly successful 1975 joint concert tour with <a href="Chicago%20%28band%29">Chicago</a>, with each group performing some of the other's songs, including their previous year's collaboration on Chicago's hit "<a href="Wishing%20You%20Were%20Here">Wishing You Were Here</a>". Beach Boys vocals were also heard on <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>'s 1974 hit "<a href="Don%27t%20Let%20the%20Sun%20Go%20Down%20on%20Me">Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me</a>". Nostalgia had settled into the Beach Boys' hype; the group had not officially released any new material since 1973's "Holland". While their concerts continuously sold out, the stage act slowly changed from a contemporary presentation followed by oldies encores to an entire show made up of mostly pre-1967 music.

Recorded in the wake of <a href="California%20Music">California Music</a>'s demise, a <a href="supergroup%20%28music%29">supergroup</a> that would have involved Brian Wilson, Bruce Johnston, and record producer <a href="Terry%20Melcher">Terry Melcher</a>, "15 Big Ones" (1976) marked Brian's return as a major force in the group. The album included new songs by Brian, as well as cover versions of oldies such as "<a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Music">Rock and Roll Music</a>", "<a href="Blueberry%20Hill%20%28song%29">Blueberry Hill</a>", and "<a href="In%20the%20Still%20of%20the%20Night%20%281956%20song%29">In the Still of the Night</a>". "Rock and Roll Music" peaked at No. 5 in the U.S. Brian and Love's "<a href="It%27s%20O.K.%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20song%29">It's O.K.</a>" was in the vein of their early sixties style, and was a moderate hit. The album was publicized by an August 1976 <a href="NBC">NBC</a>-TV special, simply titled "The Beach Boys". The special, produced by "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" (SNL) creator <a href="Lorne%20Michaels">Lorne Michaels</a>, featured appearances by "SNL" cast members <a href="John%20Belushi">John Belushi</a> and <a href="Dan%20Aykroyd">Dan Aykroyd</a>.

The album was generally disliked by fans and critics upon release. During its sessions, Brian's production role was belittled as group members overdubbed and remixed tracks to fight against his desire for a rough, unfinished sound. Carl and Dennis disparaged the album to the press while Brian admitted, "[Undoubtedly] the new album is nothing too deep", but remained hopeful that their next release would be on par with the group's "Good Vibrations".

For the remainder of 1976 to early 1977, Brian spent his time making sporadic public appearances and producing the band's next album "Love You" (1977), a quirky collection of 14 songs mostly written, arranged and produced by Brian. Brian revealed to Peter Ames Carlin that "Love You" is one of his favorite Beach Boys releases, telling him "That's when it all happened for me. That's where my heart lies." "Love You" peaked at No. 28 in the UK and No. 53 in the US and developed a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a>; regarded as one of the band's best albums by fans and critics alike, and an early work of <a href="synthpop">synthpop</a>.

Referring to "naysayers" of the album, the underground <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a> "Scram" wrote, "Fuck [them] ... [the album showcases] a truly original mix of humor and sadness. The original numbers always dance just a step away from the cliché, dealing with simple lyrical themes that make you wonder why they had never been explored before." "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" – considering the album in "the same vein" as "<a href="Tonight%27s%20the%20Night%20%28Neil%20Young%20album%29">Tonight's the Night</a>" (1975), "<a href="Pussy%20Cats">Pussy Cats</a>" (1974), "<a href="The%20Madcap%20Laughs">The Madcap Laughs</a>" (1970), and "<a href="Barrett%20%28album%29">Barrett</a>" (1970) – described "Love You" as: "something almost desperately optimistic ... Wilson sings frayed songs about roller-skating, road-tripping, and <a href="Johnny%20Carson">Johnny Carson</a> – like a frazzled man sitting in a corner chanting 'calm blue ocean' over and over. It’s a beautiful, noisy, funny, heartbreaking work of art – one not for everybody, yet vital for anyone who wants to understand Wilson’s overall worldview."

After "Love You" was released, Brian began to record and assemble "Adult/Child", an unreleased effort largely consisting of songs written by Wilson from 1976 and 1977 with select <a href="big%20band">big band</a> arrangements by Dick Reynolds. Though publicized as the Beach Boys' next release, "Adult/Child" caused tension within the group and was ultimately shelved. Following this period, his concert appearances with the band gradually diminished and their performances were occasionally erratic.

The internal wrangling came to a head after a show at <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a> on September 1, 1977, when the band effectively split into two camps; Dennis and Carl Wilson on one side, Mike Love and Al Jardine on the other with Brian remaining neutral. Following a confrontation on an airport tarmac, Dennis declared to "Rolling Stone" on September 3 that he had left the band: "It was Al Jardine who really knifed me in the heart when he said they didn't need me. That was the clincher. And all I told him was that he couldn't play more than four chords. They kept telling me I had my solo album now ["<a href="Pacific%20Ocean%20Blue">Pacific Ocean Blue</a>"], like I should go off in a corner and leave the Beach Boys to them. The album really bothers them. They don't like to admit it's doing so well; they never even acknowledge it in interviews."

The band broke up for two and a half weeks, until a meeting on September 17 at Brian's house. In light of a potential new Caribou Records contract the parties negotiated a settlement resulting in Love gaining control of Brian's vote in the group, allowing Love and Jardine to outvote Carl and Dennis Wilson on any matter.

Dennis started to withdraw from the group to focus on his second solo album entitled "<a href="Bambu%20%28Dennis%20Wilson%20album%29">Bambu</a>". The album was shelved just as alcoholism and marital problems overcame all three Wilson brothers. Carl appeared intoxicated during concerts (especially at appearances for their 1978 Australia tour) and Brian gradually slid back into addiction and an unhealthy lifestyle. Love remembered: "We were in Australia, and the Wilsons were upset that some of us were not trying heroin with them. That was a division. ... Brian, Carl and Dennis were into one lifestyle, whereas myself and Al Jardine and Bruce Johnston were not."

The Beach Boys' last album for Reprise, "M.I.U. Album" (1978), was recorded at <a href="Maharishi%20International%20University">Maharishi International University</a> in Iowa at the suggestion of Love. Dennis and Carl made limited contributions; the album was mostly produced by Jardine and Ron Altbach, with Brian credited as "executive producer". "M.I.U." was largely a contractual obligation to finish out their association with Reprise, who likewise did not promote the result. The record cemented the divisions in the group. Love and Jardine focused on rock and roll-oriented material while Carl and Dennis chose the progressive focus they had established with the albums "Carl and the Passions" and "Holland".

After departing Reprise, the Beach Boys signed with <a href="Sony%20Music%20Entertainment">CBS Records</a>. They received a substantial advance and were paid $1 million per album even as CBS deemed their preliminary review of the band's first product, "L.A. (Light Album)" as unsatisfactory. Faced with the realization that Brian was unable to contribute, the band recruited Johnston as producer. The result paid off, as "<a href="Good%20Timin%27%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20song%29">Good Timin'</a>" became a top 40 single. The group enjoyed moderate success with a disco reworking of the "Wild Honey" song "<a href="Here%20Comes%20the%20Night">Here Comes the Night</a>", followed by Jardine's "<a href="Lady%20Lynda">Lady Lynda</a>". The album was followed in 1980 by "Keepin' the Summer Alive", with Johnston once again producing. Dennis was absent for most of this album.

In 1981, Carl left the touring group because of unhappiness with the band's nostalgia format and lackluster live performances, subsequently pursuing a solo career. He stated: "I haven't quit the Beach Boys but I do not plan on touring with them until they decide that 1981 means as much to them as 1961." He returned in May 1982 – after approximately 14 months of being away – on the condition that the group reconsider their rehearsal and touring policies and refrain from "<a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas</a>-type" engagements.

From 1980 through 1982, the Beach Boys and <a href="The%20Grass%20Roots">The Grass Roots</a> performed <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Independence Day</a> concerts at the <a href="National%20Mall">National Mall</a> in Washington, D.C., attracting large crowds. However, in April 1983, <a href="James%20G.%20Watt">James G. Watt</a>, President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>'s <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a>, banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups. Watt said that "rock bands" that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted "the wrong element", who would steal from attendees. During the ensuing uproar, which included over 40,000 complaints to the <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Interior">Department of the Interior</a>, the Beach Boys stated that the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, which had invited them to perform in Leningrad in 1978, "...obviously ... did not feel that the group attracted the wrong element." Vice President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a> said of the Beach Boys, "They're my friends and I like their music". Watt later apologized to the band after learning that President Reagan and First Lady <a href="Nancy%20Reagan">Nancy Reagan</a> were fans. White House staff presented Watt with a plaster foot with a hole in it, showing that he had "shot himself in the foot". The band returned to D.C. for Independence Day in 1984 and performed to a crowd of 750,000 people.

In 1983, tensions between Dennis and Love escalated so high that each obtained a <a href="restraining%20order">restraining order</a> against each other. With the rest of the band fearing that he would end up like Brian, Dennis was given an ultimatum after his last performance in November 1983 to check into rehab for his alcohol problems or be banned from performing live with them. Dennis checked into rehab for his chance to get sober, but on December 28, 1983, he fatally drowned in <a href="Marina%20del%20Rey">Marina del Rey</a> while diving from a friend's boat trying to recover items that he had previously thrown overboard in fits of rage. Despite his death, the Beach Boys continued as a successful touring act.

On July 4, 1985, the Beach Boys played to an afternoon crowd of one million in Philadelphia and the same evening they performed for over 750,000 people on the Mall in Washington. They also appeared nine days later at the <a href="Live%20Aid">Live Aid</a> concert. That year, they released the eponymous album "The Beach Boys" and enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as <a href="David%20Lee%20Roth">David Lee Roth</a>'s hit version of "California Girls". "<a href="Getcha%20Back">Getcha Back</a>", released from the album, gave the group a No. 26 single in the U.S. Following this, the group put out "<a href="Rock%20%27n%27%20Roll%20to%20the%20Rescue">Rock 'n' Roll to the Rescue</a>" (U.S., No. 68) and a cover of <a href="the%20Mamas%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Papas">the Mamas & the Papas</a>' "<a href="California%20Dreamin%27">California Dreamin'</a>" (U.S., No. 57). In 1987, they played with the <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">rap</a> group <a href="The%20Fat%20Boys">The Fat Boys</a>, performing the song "<a href="Wipe%20Out%20%28song%29">Wipe Out</a>" and filming a <a href="music%20video">music video</a>. It was a No. 12 single in the US and a No. 2 rank in the UK.

By 1988, Brian had drifted from the Beach Boys and released his first solo album, "<a href="Brian%20Wilson%20%28album%29">Brian Wilson</a>". During this period the band unexpectedly claimed their first U.S. No. 1 hit single in 22 years with "<a href="Kokomo%20%28song%29">Kokomo</a>", which had appeared in the movie "<a href="Cocktail%20%281988%20film%29">Cocktail</a>", and soon became the band's largest selling single of all time. They released the album "Still Cruisin", which went gold in the U.S. In 1990, the band gathered several studio musicians and recorded the Melcher-produced title track of the comedy "<a href="Problem%20Child%20%281990%20film%29">Problem Child</a>". The album "<a href="Summer%20in%20Paradise">Summer in Paradise</a>", had no new contributions from Brian because of interference from caretaker <a href="Eugene%20Landy">Eugene Landy</a>.

A lawsuit was filed by Brian in 1989 to reclaim the rights to his songs and the group's publishing company, <a href="Sea%20of%20Tunes">Sea of Tunes</a>, which he had supposedly signed away to his father Murry in 1969. He successfully argued that he had not been mentally fit to make an informed decision and that his father had potentially forged his signature. While Wilson failed to regain his copyrights, he was awarded $25 million for unpaid royalties. With Love and Brian unable to determine exactly what Love was properly owed, <a href="Love%20v.%20Wilson">Love sued Brian in 1992</a>, winning $13 million in 1994 for lost royalties. 35 of the group's songs were then amended to credit Love.

In 1993, the band appeared in <a href="Michael%20Feeney%20Callan">Michael Feeney Callan</a>'s film "The Beach Boys Today", which included in-depth interviews with all members except Brian. Carl confided to Callan that Brian would record again with the band at some point in the near future. A few <a href="Andy%20Paley%20sessions">Beach Boys sessions devoted to new Brian Wilson compositions</a> occurred during the mid-1990s, but they remain largely unreleased, and the album was quickly cancelled because of personal conflicts. In February 1996, the Beach Boys guested with <a href="Status%20Quo%20%28band%29">Status Quo</a> on a re-recording of "<a href="Fun%2C%20Fun%2C%20Fun">Fun, Fun, Fun</a>", which became a British Top-30 hit. In June, the group worked with comedian <a href="Jeff%20Foxworthy">Jeff Foxworthy</a> on the recording "Howdy From Maui", and eventually released "Stars and Stripes Vol. 1" in August 1996. The album consisted of country renditions of several Beach Boys hits, performed by popular country artists such as <a href="Toby%20Keith">Toby Keith</a> and <a href="Willie%20Nelson">Willie Nelson</a>. Brian, who was in a better mental state at the time, acted as co-producer.

In early 1997, Carl was diagnosed with lung and brain cancer after years of heavy smoking. Despite his terminal condition, Carl continued to perform with the band on its 1997 summer tour while undergoing chemotherapy. During performances, he sat on a stool and needed oxygen after every song. However, Carl was able to stand when he played on "<a href="God%20Only%20Knows">God Only Knows</a>". Carl died on February 6, 1998, two months after the death of the Wilsons' mother, Audree, leaving Brian, Jardine and Love as the three remaining original members.

Following Carl's death, the remaining members splintered. Love and Johnston, occasionally with David Marks, continued to tour together, initially as "America's Band", but following several cancelled bookings under that name, they sought authorization through Brother Records Inc. (BRI) to tour as "The Beach Boys" and secured the necessary license. In turn, Jardine left the band and began to tour regularly with his band "Beach Boys: Family & Friends" until he ran into legal issues for using the name without license. Meanwhile, Jardine sued Love, claiming that he had been excluded from their concerts. BRI, through its longtime attorney, Ed McPherson, sued Jardine in Federal Court. Jardine, in turn, counter-claimed against BRI for wrongful termination. BRI ultimately prevailed. Love and Johnston continued to tour as "The Beach Boys" with supporting musicians.

Brian Wilson sought treatments for his illnesses that aided him in his solo career. He toured regularly with his backing band consisting of members of <a href="Wondermints">Wondermints</a> and other LA/Chicago musicians. Marks also maintained a solo career. The surviving group members appeared as themselves for the 1998 documentary film "", directed by <a href="Alan%20Boyd">Alan Boyd</a>. Following the success of 1997's "<a href="The%20Pet%20Sounds%20Sessions">The Pet Sounds Sessions</a>", many compilations were then issued by Capitol containing new archival material: "<a href="Endless%20Harmony%20Soundtrack">Endless Harmony Soundtrack</a>" (1998), "<a href="Ultimate%20Christmas">Ultimate Christmas</a>" (1998), and "<a href="Hawthorne%2C%20CA%20%28album%29">Hawthorne, CA</a>" (2001).

In 2004, Wilson recorded and released his solo album "<a href="Brian%20Wilson%20Presents%20Smile">Brian Wilson Presents Smile</a>", a reinterpretation of the "Smile" project that he initiated with the Beach Boys 36 years earlier. That September, Wilson issued a free CD through the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Mail On Sunday</a>" that included Beach Boys songs he had recently rerecorded, five of which he co-authored with Love. The 10 track compilation had 2.6 million copies distributed and prompted Love to file a lawsuit in November 2005; he claimed the promotion hurt the sales of the original recordings. Love's suit was dismissed in 2007 when a judge determined that there were no triable issues.

On June 13, 2006, the five surviving Beach Boys (Wilson, Love, Jardine, Johnston, and Marks) appeared together for the celebration of the 40th anniversary of "Pet Sounds" and the double-platinum certification of their greatest hits compilation, "", in a ceremony atop the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. Plaques were awarded for their efforts, with Wilson accepting on behalf of Dennis and Carl. Wilson began a brief "Pet Sounds" tour with Jardine later that year.

On October 31, 2011, the Beach Boys released surviving 1960s recordings from "<a href="Smile%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20album%29">Smile</a>" in the form of "<a href="The%20Smile%20Sessions">The Smile Sessions</a>". The album – even in its incomplete form – garnered universal critical acclaim and experienced popular success, charting in both the Billboard US and UK Top 30. The band was rewarded with glowing reviews, including inclusion in Rolling Stone's Top 500 album list at No. 381. "The Smile Sessions" went on to win Best Historical Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards.

In February 2011, the Beach Boys released "<a href="Don%27t%20Fight%20the%20Sea">Don't Fight the Sea</a>", a charity single to aid the victims of the 2011 Japan earthquake. The single, released on Jardine's 2011 album "A Postcard From California" featured Jardine, Wilson, Love and Johnston.

On December 16, 2011, it was announced that Wilson, Love, Jardine, Johnston and Marks would reunite for a new album and <a href="Beach%20Boys%2050th%20Anniversary%20Reunion%20Tour">50th anniversary tour in 2012</a> to include a performance at the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Jazz%20Festival">New Orleans Jazz Festival</a> in April 2012. On February 12, 2012, the Beach Boys performed at the 2012 Grammy Awards, in what was billed as a "special performance" by organizers. It marked the group's first live performance to include Brian since 1996, Al since 1998, and David since 1999. The Beach Boys then appeared at the April 10, 2012, season opener for the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> and performed "Surfer Girl" and "The Star-Spangled Banner". In April, the new album's title was revealed as "<a href="That%27s%20Why%20God%20Made%20the%20Radio">That's Why God Made the Radio</a>". The first single from the album, <a href="That%27s%20Why%20God%20Made%20the%20Radio%20%28song%29">the title track</a>, was released on digital platforms on April 26. "That's Why God Made the Radio" debuted at No. 3 on U.S. charts, making U.S. chart history by expanding the group's span of <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> top ten albums across 49 years and one week, passing <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a> with 47 years of top ten albums.

Later in 2012, the group released the "<a href="Fifty%20Big%20Ones">Fifty Big Ones</a>" and "Greatest Hits" compilations along with reissues of 12 of their albums. The next year, the group released "<a href="Live%20%E2%80%93%20The%2050th%20Anniversary%20Tour">Live – The 50th Anniversary Tour</a>" a 41-song, 2-CD set documenting their "50th Anniversary Tour". While there were no definite plans, Brian stated that he would like to make another Beach Boys album following the world tour. In August 2013, the group released "<a href="Made%20in%20California">Made in California</a>", a six disc collection featuring more than seven and a half hours of music, including more than 60 previously unreleased tracks, and concluding the Beach Boys' 50th anniversary campaign.

Love wrote that on June 1, 2012, he received an e-mail from Wilson's wife and manager <a href="Melinda%20Ledbetter">Melinda Ledbetter</a> stating "no more shows for Wilson". Love, who is obligated by his license of the Beach Boys name to maintain revenue flow to Brother Records, then began accepting invitations for when the reunion was over. On June 25, Ledbetter sent another e-mail asking to disregard her last message, but by then, Love says, "it was too late. We had booked other concerts, and promoters had begun selling tickets." The next day, Love announced additional touring dates that would not feature Wilson. Wilson then denied knowledge of these new dates. Love writes: "I had wanted to send out a joint press release, between Brian and me, formally announcing the end of the reunion tour on September 28. But I couldn’t get Brian’s management team on board (Brian himself doesn’t make those kinds of decisions)."

In late September, news outlets began reporting that Love and Johnston split from the other 3 members. On October 5, Love responded in a self-written press release to the "LA Times" that the band would return to its pre-50th Reunion Tour lineup with him and Johnston touring as the Beach Boys without Wilson, Jardine, and Marks:

Four days later, Wilson and Jardine submitted a written response to the rumors stating: "After Mike booked a couple of shows with Bruce, Al and I were, of course, disappointed. Then there was confusion in some markets when photos of me, Al and David and the 50th reunion band appeared on websites advertising his shows ... I was completely blindsided by his press release ... We hadn't even discussed as a band what we were going to do with all the offers that were coming in for more 50th shows." Love attributed Wilson's statements in this press release to falsification by his agents, again affirming that the presupposed agreements were "well-documented", and that Wilson had halted further touring dates. On December 13, Wilson and Jardine played a Christmas show at which they performed the Beach Boys Christmas songs. Following this appearance, Wilson announced concert dates featuring himself, Jardine and Marks. Love and Johnston continued to perform under the Beach Boys name, while Wilson, Jardine, and Marks continued to tour as a trio, and a subsequent tour with guitarist <a href="Jeff%20Beck">Jeff Beck</a> also included former Beach Boy Blondie Chaplin at select dates. Reflecting upon the band's reunion in 2013, Love stated: "I had a wonderful experience being in the studio together. Brian has lost none of his ability to structure those melodies and chord progressions, and when we heard us singing together coming back over the speakers it sounded like 1965 again. Touring was more for the fans. ... It was a great experience, it had a term to it, and now everyone's going on with their ways of doing things."

Biographer <a href="Jon%20Stebbins">Jon Stebbins</a> speculated that Love declined to continue working with the group because of the lesser control he had over the touring process, coupled with the lower financial gain, noting: "Night after night after night after night, Mike is making less money getting reminded that Brian is more popular than him. And he has to answer to people instead of calling all the shots himself." Writer Stacey Anderson called Love's arguments "wholly unconvincing", facetiously summarizing: "He insists that the larger ensemble with Wilson would have overpowered the modest venues he’d already booked; as anyone can infer, this really means he would have lost money by including Wilson."

Jardine, Marks, Johnston and Love appeared together at the 2014 Ella Awards Ceremony, where Love was honored for his work as a singer. Marks sang "409" in honor of Love, and Jardine performed "Help Me Rhonda". They closed the show with "Fun, Fun, Fun". Wilson's long time band associate <a href="Jeff%20Foskett">Jeff Foskett</a> also appeared, but not Wilson. On May 15, 2014 the touring Beach Boys (Love and Johnston) announced a tour celebrating "50 Years of 'Fun Fun Fun, named for <a href="Fun%2C%20Fun%2C%20Fun">their 1964 single</a>. The tour featured the return of Jeff Foskett, who replaced Mike's son Christian. As of September 2014, Jardine has maintained that a continued reunion with the Beach Boys is "really up to him [Love] ... He claims he didn't, that he fired us after the reunion ... He’s a brilliant songwriter, and unfortunately he has brilliant lawyers. We wish him all the best, but doggonit, you know, we’d like to be Beach Boys, too. There you go."

In 2015, "<a href="Soundstage%20%28TV%20series%29">Soundstage</a>" aired an episode featuring Wilson performing with Jardine and former Beach Boys Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar at <a href="The%20Venetian%20Las%20Vegas">The Venetian</a> in <a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas</a>. In April 2015, when asked if he was interested in making music with Love again, Wilson replied: "I don’t think so, no," later adding in July that he "doesn't talk to the Beach Boys [or] Mike Love." On July 25, Love said: "If you get Brian and I, we might go to the piano. But with every band there are cliques that are formed with management, wives, agents, publicists – and the tendency is with some people is they tend to lionize or make one person more important than the others. ... the Beach Boys and all these bands that ever existed are a team. I learned as captain of my cross country team that you don't put a person down to get their best efforts, you encourage them."

In "Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis", <a href="music%20theory">music theorist</a> <a href="Daniel%20Harrison%20%28music%20theorist%29">Daniel Harrison</a> summarizes:

The Beach Boys began as a <a href="garage%20band">garage band</a> playing 1950s style <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a>, reassembling styles of music such as <a href="surf%20music">surf</a> to include <a href="vocal%20jazz">vocal jazz</a> <a href="jazz%20harmony">harmony</a>, which created their unique sound. In addition, they introduced their signature approach to common genres such as the <a href="pop%20ballad">pop ballad</a> by applying harmonic or formal twists not native to rock and roll. Early on, Love sang lead vocals in the rock-oriented songs, while Carl contributed crisp guitar lines on the group's ballads. Miller observed, "On straight rockers they sang tight harmonies behind Love's lead ... on ballads, Brian played his <a href="falsetto">falsetto</a> off against lush, <a href="jazz">jazz</a>-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures." Harrison adds, "But even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone." This new sound was quickly associated with the <a href="modernism%20%28music%29">Modernism</a> movement blooming in the Los Angeles music scene. Among the distinct elements of the Beach Boys' style were the nasal quality of their singing voices, their use of a falsetto harmony over a driving, locomotive-like melody, and the sudden chiming in of the whole group on a key line.

During their early years, the Beach Boys released music that displayed an increasing level of sophistication, a period where Brian Wilson consistently acted as the group's primary bandleader, songwriter, producer, and arranger for the group's most commercially and critically successful work. In a 1966 article that asks "Do the Beach Boys rely too much on sound genius Brian?" Carl responded that every member of the group contributes ideas, but admitted that Brian was majorly responsible for their music. In 1967, Dennis was cited as "the closest to brother Brian's own musical ideals ... He always emphasises the fusion, in their work, of pop and classical music." An appearance by the band on "<a href="Good%20Morning%20America">Good Morning America</a>" in 1980 was highlighted by journalist <a href="Ben%20Ratliff">Ben Ratliff</a> who explains: "The clip and everything about it – the occasion for its happening, Dennis's shrug, Al Jardine's silence, Carl's gameness, Brian's self-absorption, Mike Love's critical stewardship of the narrative – seems to say a lot, in seven minutes, about who the Beach Boys are and how they worked together."

In early 1964, Brian began his breakaway from beach-themed music. Later in November of the same year, the group expressed desires to advance from the surf rock style for which they initially became known for. "New York" magazine would later refer to the albums "Pet Sounds" and "Smiley Smile" as their "<a href="experimental%20pop">experimental pop</a> phase". The band went on to incorporate many more <a href="genres">genres</a>, from <a href="baroque%20pop">baroque pop</a> to <a href="psychedelic%20rock">psychedelia</a> and <a href="synthpop">synthpop</a>.

The band's earliest influences came primarily from the work of <a href="Chuck%20Berry">Chuck Berry</a> and <a href="the%20Four%20Freshmen">the Four Freshmen</a>. Performed by the Four Freshmen, "<a href="Their%20Hearts%20Were%20Full%20of%20Spring">Their Hearts Were Full of Spring</a>" (1961) was a particular favorite of the group. By analyzing their arrangements of <a href="pop%20standards">pop standards</a>, Brian educated himself on <a href="jazz%20harmony">jazz harmony</a>. Bearing this in mind, Philip Lambert noted, "If <a href="Bob%20Flanigan%20%28singer%29">Bob Flanigan</a> helped teach Brian how to sing, then <a href="George%20Gershwin">Gershwin</a>, <a href="Jerome%20Kern">Kern</a>, <a href="Cole%20Porter">Porter</a>, and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song." Other general influences on the group included <a href="the%20Hi-Los">the Hi-Los</a>, <a href="the%20Penguins">the Penguins</a>, <a href="the%20Robins">the Robins</a>, <a href="Bill%20Haley%20%26amp%3B%20His%20Comets">Bill Haley & His Comets</a>, <a href="Otis%20Williams">Otis Williams</a>, <a href="the%20Cadets%20%28doo%20wop%29">the Cadets</a>, <a href="the%20Everly%20Brothers">the Everly Brothers</a>, <a href="the%20Shirelles">the Shirelles</a>, <a href="The%20Regents%20%28doo-wop%20band%29">the Regents</a>, and <a href="the%20Crystals">the Crystals</a>.

Carl remembers: "Most of [Mike's] classmates were black. He was the only white guy on his track team. He was really immersed in doo-wop and that music and I think he influenced Brian to listen to it. The black artists were so much better in terms of rock records in those days that the white records almost sounded like put-ons." Their eclectic mix of white and black vocal groups – ranging from the rock and roll of Berry, the jazz harmonies of the Four Freshmen, the pop of <a href="the%20Four%20Preps">the Four Preps</a>, the folk of <a href="the%20Kingston%20Trio">the Kingston Trio</a>, the R&B of groups like <a href="the%20Coasters">the Coasters</a> and <a href="the%20Five%20Satins">the Five Satins</a>, and the doo wop of <a href="Dion%20and%20the%20Belmonts">Dion and the Belmonts</a> – helped contribute to the Beach Boys' uniqueness in American popular music. While the Beach Boys are not often associated with <a href="blues">blues</a>, Brian has called this a misapprehension, citing <a href="Smokey%20Robinson">Smokey Robinson</a> and <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a> as influences. Regarding surf rock pioneer <a href="Dick%20Dale">Dick Dale</a>, Brian clarified that his influence on the group was limited to Carl and his style of guitar playing. Carl himself named Berry, <a href="the%20Ventures">the Ventures</a>, and <a href="John%20Walker%20%28musician%29">John Walker</a> for shaping his guitar style, and that the Beach Boys had learned to play all of the Ventures' songs by ear early in their career. On <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> and "heavy" music, Brian said he felt no pressure to go in that direction: "We never got into the heavy musical level trip. We never needed to. It's already been done."

The influence of the Beach Boys' peers combined with Brian's competitive nature drove him to reach higher creative peaks. Sometime around late 1963, he heard the song "<a href="Be%20My%20Baby">Be My Baby</a>" (1963) by <a href="the%20Ronettes">the Ronettes</a> for the first time, revamping his creative interests and songwriting. "Be My Baby" is considered the epitome of <a href="Phil%20Spector">Phil Spector</a>'s <a href="Wall%20of%20Sound">Wall of Sound</a> production technique, a recording method that fascinated Wilson for the next several decades. Brian later reflected: "I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector's work. That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song." Other prominent inspirations for Brian included Gershwin's "<a href="Rhapsody%20in%20Blue">Rhapsody in Blue</a>" (1924), <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>' "<a href="Rubber%20Soul">Rubber Soul</a>" (1965), and composer <a href="Burt%20Bacharach">Burt Bacharach</a>. Brian is quoted: "Burt Bacharach and <a href="Hal%20David">Hal David</a> are more like me. They’re also the best pop team – per se – today. As a producer, Bacharach has a very fresh, new approach."

Experimentation with <a href="psychotropic">psychotropic</a> substances proved pivotal to the group's development as artists. In December 1964, Brian was introduced to <a href="cannabis">cannabis</a> before quickly progressing to <a href="LSD">LSD</a> in early 1965. Of his first <a href="psychedelic%20experience">acid trip</a>, Brian recalled that the drug had subjected him to "a very religious experience" which enlightened him to indescribable philosophies. The music for "<a href="California%20Girls">California Girls</a>" (the first Beach Boys song <a href="Bruce%20Johnston">Bruce Johnston</a> participated in) came from this first LSD experience, as did much of the group's subsequent work where they would partake in drug use during recording sessions.

The band members often reflected on the spiritual nature of their music (and music in general), particularly for the recording of "Pet Sounds" and "Smile". Even though the Wilson family did not grow up in a particularly religious household, Carl was described as "the most truly religious person I know" by Brian, and Carl was forthcoming about the group's spiritual beliefs stating: "We believe in God as a kind of <a href="universal%20consciousness">universal consciousness</a>. God is love. God is you. God is me. God is everything right here in this room. It's a spiritual concept which inspires a great deal of our music." Carl told "Rave" magazine in 1967 that the group's influences are of a "religious nature", but not any religion in specific, only "an idea based upon that of Universal Consciousness. ... The spiritual concept of happiness and doing good to others is extremely important to the lyric of our songs, and the religious element of some of the better <a href="church%20music">church music</a> is also contained within some of our new work."

Brian is quoted during the "Smile" era: "I'm very religious. Not in the sense of churches, going to church; but like the essence of "all" religion." During the recording of "Pet Sounds", Brian held <a href="prayer%20meeting">prayer meeting</a>s, later reflecting that "God was with us the whole time we were doing [the] album ... I could feel that feeling in my brain." In 1966, he explained that he wanted to move into a <a href="religious%20music">white spiritual sound</a>, and predicted that the rest of the music industry would follow suit. In 2011, Brian maintained the spirituality was important to his music, and that he did not follow any particular religion.

The Beach Boys included an interpretation of "<a href="The%20Lord%27s%20Prayer%20%28song%29">The Lord's Prayer</a>" as the B-side to their 1963 "Little Saint Nick" single. Brian expressed apprehensiveness over naming his song "God Only Knows" because, in the 1960s, references to <a href="God">God</a> in pop music were largely unheard of. Carl said that "Smile" was chosen as an album title because of its connection to the group's spiritual beliefs. Brian referred to "Smile" as his "teenage symphony to God", composing a <a href="hymn">hymn</a>, "<a href="Our%20Prayer">Our Prayer</a>", as the album's opening spiritual invocation. He spoke of his LSD trips as a "religious experience", and during a session for "Our Prayer", Brian can be heard asking the other Beach Boys: "Do you guys feel any acid yet?". In 1968, Mike Love's interest in <a href="transcendental%20meditation">transcendental meditation</a> led the Beach Boys to record the original song "<a href="Transcendental%20Meditation%20%28song%29">Transcendental Meditation</a>".

Brian identified each member individually for their <a href="vocal%20range">vocal range</a>, once detailing the ranges for Carl, Dennis, Jardine ("[they] progress upwards through G, A, and B"), Love ("can go from bass to the E above middle C"), and himself ("I can take the second D in the <a href="treble%20clef">treble clef</a>"). He declared in 1966 that his greatest interest was to expand modern vocal harmony, owing his fascination with voice to the Four Freshmen, which he considered a "groovy sectional sound." He added, "The harmonies that we are able to produce give us a uniqueness which is really the only important thing you can put into records – some quality that no one else has got. I love peaks in a song – and enhancing them on the control panel. Most of all, I love the human voice for its own sake." For a period, Brian avoided singing falsetto for the group, saying "I thought people thought I was a <a href="fairy%20%28gay%20slang%29">fairy</a>. ... The band told me, 'If that's the way you sing, don't worry about it.'"

Rock critic <a href="Erik%20Davis">Erik Davis</a> wrote, "The 'purity' of tone and genetic proximity that smoothed their voices was almost creepy, pseudo-<a href="castrato">castrato</a>, [and] a '<a href="barbershop%20music">barbershop</a>' sound." According to Brian: "<a href="Jack%20Good%20%28producer%29">Jack Good</a> once told us, 'You sing like <a href="eunuch">eunuch</a>s in a <a href="Sistine%20Chapel">Sistine Chapel</a>,' which was a pretty good quote." Writer <a href="Richard%20Goldstein%20%28writer%20born%201944%29">Richard Goldstein</a> reported that, according to a fellow journalist who asked Brian about the black roots of his music, Brian's response was: "We're white and we sing white." Goldstein added that when he asked where his approach to vocal harmonies had derived from, Wilson answered: 'Barbershop'." On the group's blend, Carl said: "Michael has a beautifully rich, very full-sounding bass voice. Yet his lead singing is real nasal, real punk. Alan’s voice has a bright timbre to it; it really cuts. My voice has a kind of calm sound. We’re big oooh-ers; we love to oooh. It’s a big, full sound, that’s very pleasing to us; it opens up the heart." According to Carl, it's "not widely known" that Love also contributed to many of the vocal arrangements; "He would bring out the funkier approaches, whether to go "shoo-boo-bop" or "bom-bom-did-di-did-did". It makes a big difference, because it can change the whole rhythm, the whole color and tone of it."

From lowest <a href="interval%20%28music%29">intervals</a> to highest, the group's vocal harmony stack usually began with Love or Dennis, followed by Jardine or Carl, and finally Brian on top, according to Jardine, while Carl said that the blend was Love on bottom, Carl above, followed by Dennis or Jardine, and then Brian on top. Jardine explains, "We always sang the same vocal intervals. ... As soon as we heard the chords on the piano we’d figure it out pretty easily. If there was a vocal move [Brian] envisioned, he’d show that particular singer that move. We had somewhat photographic memory as far as the vocal parts were concerned so that [was] never a problem for us."

Striving for absolute perfection, Brian's intricate vocal arrangements exercised the group's calculated blend of <a href="intonation%20%28music%29">intonation</a>, <a href="attack%20%28music%29">attack</a>, <a href="phrase%20%28music%29">phrasing</a>, and <a href="musical%20expression">expression</a>. Sometimes, he would sing each vocal harmony part alone through multi-track tape. <a href="Jimmy%20Webb">Jimmy Webb</a> has said, "They used very little <a href="vibrato">vibrato</a> and sing in very straight tones. The voices all lie down beside each other very easily – there's no bumping between them because the pitch is very precise."

The group's instrumental combo initially involved Brian on bass guitar and keyboards, Carl on guitar, and Dennis on drums. Nine months after forming, they acquired national success, and demand for their personal appearance skyrocketed. Biographer James Murphy said, "By most contemporary accounts, they were not a very good live band when they started. ... The Beach Boys learned to play as a band in front of live audiences", but asserted that they eventually became "one of the best and enduring live bands".

For the recording of the Beach Boys' instrumental tracks, Brian arranged many of his compositions for a conglomerate of <a href="session%20musician">session musician</a>s informally known as <a href="the%20Wrecking%20Crew%20%28music%29">the Wrecking Crew</a>. Their assistance was needed because of the increasingly complicated nature of the material. As a result, a number of songs do not credit the Beach Boys as instrumentalists, but nearly invariably as lead, harmony, or backing vocalists. It's the belief of <a href="Richie%20Unterberger">Richie Unterberger</a> that, "Before session musicians took over most of the parts, the Beach Boys could play respectably gutsy surf rock as a self-contained unit."

Carl continued to play beside these musicians whenever he was available to attend sessions. In archivist Craig Slowinski's view, "One should not sell short Carl's own contributions; the youngest Wilson had developed as a musician sufficiently to play alongside the horde of high-dollar session pros that big brother was now bringing into the studio. Carl's guitar playing [was] a key ingredient."

It is often erroneously stated that Dennis' drumming in the Beach Boys' recordings was filled in exclusively by studio musicians. His drumming is documented on a number of the group's singles, including "I Get Around", "Fun, Fun Fun", and "Don't Worry Baby".

Brian's experiments with his Wollensak tape recorder provide early examples of his flair for <a href="exotica">exotica</a> and unusual percussive patterns and arranging ideas that he would recycle in later prominent work. Through attending Phil Spector's sessions sporadically, Brian learned how to act as a producer for records while being educated on the <a href="Wall%20of%20Sound">Wall of Sound</a> process. From then on, Brian received some production advice from <a href="Jan%20Berry">Jan Berry</a>. As they collaborated on several hit singles written and produced for other artists, they recorded what would later be regarded the <a href="California%20Sound">California Sound</a>. The positive commercial response to Brian's structurally irregular and harmonically varied pop compositions gave him the prestige, resources, and courage to further his creative aspirations. He proceeded to explore many unusual combinations of instruments while emphasizing inventive percussion and progressively ambitious lyricism.

Although he was often dubbed a perfectionist, Brian was an inexperienced musician, and his understanding was mostly self-taught. He handled most stages of the group's recording process from the beginning, despite <a href="Nik%20Venet">Nik Venet</a> being credited for producing their early recordings. At the lyric stage, Brian usually worked with bandmate <a href="Mike%20Love">Mike Love</a>, whose assertive persona provided youthful swagger that contrasted Brian's explorations in romanticism and sensitivity. Luis Sanchez noted a pattern where Brian would spare surfing imagery when working with collaborators outside of his band's circle, in the examples "<a href="Lonely%20Sea">Lonely Sea</a>" and "<a href="In%20My%20Room">In My Room</a>".

Foreshadowed by "Beach Boys' Party!" (1965), much of the group's recordings from 1967 to 1970 displayed sparse instrumentation, a more relaxed ensemble, and a seeming inattention to production quality. Brian briefly experimented with "<a href="musique%20concrete">musique concrete</a>" and <a href="minimalist%20music">minimalist rock</a> approaches to music before retreating to <a href="Brian%20Wilson%27s%20home%20studio">his home recording studio</a> to record "manic" material in the 1970s, enacting <a href="syncopation">syncopated exercises</a> and <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a>s layered on jittery <a href="eighth%20note">eighth note</a> <a href="tone%20cluster">tone cluster</a>s and loping <a href="Swing%20%28jazz%20performance%20style%29">shuffle grooves</a>. During the infancy of Brian's home studio, the group was forced to improvise many technical aspects of recording. In one instance, they used an empty swimming pool as an <a href="echo%20chamber">echo chamber</a>.

When Brian abdicated from the group, the other members were forced to take a more active production role. This is believed to have faltered the quality of their music. <a href="Richie%20Unterberger">Richie Unterberger</a> believes that after the December 1967 release of "Wild Honey", "the Beach Boys were revealed as a group that, although capable of producing some fine and interesting music, were no longer innovators on the level of the Beatles and other figureheads." The album marked the beginning of Carl's increased role as producer, who described it as "music for Brian to cool out by", signaling a mellower approach that pervaded into the 1970s. In 1968, Dennis contributed original songs to "Friends", revealing himself as a broodingly soulful songwriter and singer, while Bruce Johnston devised a moody instrumental, "The Nearest Faraway Place", for "20/20" the following year.

"<a href="Sunflower%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20album%29">Sunflower</a>" (1970) marked an end to the experimental songwriting and production phase initiated by "<a href="Smiley%20Smile">Smiley Smile</a>" (1967). Of the albums between "<a href="Surf%27s%20Up%20%28album%29">Surf's Up</a>" (1971) and "Holland" (1973), Daniel Harrison wrote that they "contain a mixture of middle-of-the-road music entirely consonant with pop style during the early 1970s with a few oddities that proved that the desire to push beyond conventional boundaries was not dead." While Harrison adamantly states "1974 is the year in which the Beach Boys ceased to be a rock 'n' roll act and became an oldies act," "<a href="Love%20You%20%28The%20Beach%20Boys%20album%29">Love You</a>" (1977) is perceived by some as an oddity that sounds like no other record in their catalog with <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>-laden arrangements played almost entirely by Brian.

Regarded by some critics as one of the greatest American rock groups and an important catalyst in the evolution of popular music, the Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed, <a href="list%20of%20best-selling%20musical%20artists">commercially successful</a>, and widely influential bands of all time. The Beach Boys' sales estimates range from 100 to 350 million records worldwide, and have influenced artists spanning many genres and decades. The group's early songs made them major pop stars in the US, the UK, Australia and other countries, having seven top 10 singles between April 1963 and November 1964. They were one of the few American bands formed prior to the 1964 <a href="British%20Invasion">British Invasion</a> to continue their success. Among artists of the 1960s, they are one of few central figures in the histories of rock.

The group routinely appears in the upper reaches of ranked lists such as "The Top 1000 Albums of All Time." Many of the group's songs and albums including "The Beach Boys Today!" (1965), "Smiley Smile" (1967), "Sunflower" (1970), and "Surf's Up" (1971) are featured in several lists devoted to the greatest of all time. The 1966 releases "Pet Sounds" and "Good Vibrations" frequently rank among the top of critics' lists of the greatest albums and singles of all time. In 2004, "Pet Sounds" was preserved in the <a href="National%20Recording%20Registry">National Recording Registry</a> by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> for being "culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant." Their recordings of "In My Room", "Good Vibrations", "California Girls" and the entire "Pet Sounds" album have been inducted into the <a href="Grammy%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Grammy Hall of Fame</a>. On <a href="Acclaimed%20Music">Acclaimed Music</a>, "Good Vibrations" is ranked the third best song of all time, while "<a href="God%20Only%20Knows">God Only Knows</a>" is ranked 21st; the group itself is ranked No. 11 in its 1000 most recommended artists of all time.

In 1966, a reader poll conducted by the UK magazine "<a href="NME">NME</a>" named the Beach Boys as the world's No. 1 vocal group, ahead of the Beatles and <a href="the%20Walker%20Brothers">the Walker Brothers</a>. In 1974, the Beach Boys were awarded "Band of the Year" by "Rolling Stone". On December 30, 1980, the Beach Boys were awarded a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>, located at 1500 Vine Street. The group was inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 1988. Ten years later they were selected for the <a href="Vocal%20Group%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Vocal Group Hall of Fame</a>. In 2001, the group received a <a href="Grammy%20Lifetime%20Achievement%20Award">Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award</a>. In 2004, "Rolling Stone" ranked the Beach Boys No. 12 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. Brian Wilson was inducted into the UK Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in November 2006.

The Wilsons' California house, where the Wilson brothers grew up and the group began, was demolished in 1986 to make way for <a href="Interstate%20105%20%28California%29">Interstate 105</a>, the Century Freeway. A <a href="Beach%20Boys%20Historic%20Landmark">Beach Boys Historic Landmark</a> (California Landmark No. 1041 at 3701 West 119th Street), dedicated on May 20, 2005, marks the location.

Beatrix Potter

Helen Beatrix Potter (28 July 186622 December 1943) was an English writer, illustrator, <a href="natural%20scientist">natural scientist</a>, and <a href="Conservation%20movement">conservationist</a> best known for her children's books featuring animals, such as those in "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Peter%20Rabbit">The Tale of Peter Rabbit</a>".

Born into a privileged household, Potter was educated by <a href="governess">governess</a>es and grew up isolated from other children. She had numerous pets and spent holidays in Scotland and the <a href="Lake%20District">Lake District</a>, developing a love of landscape, flora, and fauna, all of which she closely observed and painted.

Though Potter was typical of women of her generation in having limited opportunities for higher education, her study and watercolors of fungi led to her being widely respected in the field of <a href="mycology">mycology</a>. In her thirties, Potter published the highly successful children's book, "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Peter%20Rabbit">The Tale of Peter Rabbit</a>". Potter began writing and illustrating children's books full-time.

With the proceeds from the books and a legacy from an aunt, in 1905 Potter bought <a href="Hill%20Top%2C%20Cumbria">Hill Top Farm</a> in <a href="Near%20and%20Far%20Sawrey">Near Sawrey</a>, a village in the <a href="Lake%20District">Lake District</a>, which at that time was in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. Over the following decades, she purchased additional farms to preserve the unique hill country landscape. In 1913, at the age of 47, she married William Heelis, a respected local solicitor from <a href="Hawkshead">Hawkshead</a>. Potter was also a prize-winning breeder of <a href="Herdwick%20sheep">Herdwick sheep</a> and a prosperous farmer keenly interested in land preservation. She continued to write and illustrate, and to design spin-off merchandise based on her children's books for British publisher Warne, until the duties of land management and her diminishing eyesight made it difficult to continue.

Potter wrote about 30 books; the best known being her <a href="Beatrix%20Potter%23Publications">24 children's tales</a>. She died of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and <a href="heart%20disease">heart disease</a> on 22 December 1943 at her home in Near Sawrey at age 77, leaving almost all her property to the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a>. She is credited with preserving much of the land that now constitutes the <a href="Lake%20District%20National%20Park">Lake District National Park</a>. Potter's books continue to sell throughout the world in many languages with her stories being retold in song, film, ballet, and animation, and her life depicted in a feature film and television film.

Potter's paternal grandfather, <a href="Edmund%20Potter">Edmund Potter</a>, from <a href="Glossop">Glossop</a> in Derbyshire, owned what was then the largest <a href="calico">calico</a> printing works in England, and later served as a member of Parliament.

Beatrix's father, Rupert William Potter (1832–1914), was educated at Manchester College by the <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> philosopher <a href="James%20Martineau">Dr. James Martineau</a>, an ancestor of <a href="Catherine%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Cambridge">Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge</a>. He then trained as a barrister in London. Rupert practised law, specialising in <a href="equity%20%28legal%20concept%29">equity</a> law and <a href="conveyancing">conveyancing</a>. He married Helen Leech (1839–1932) on 8 August 1863 at Hyde Unitarian Chapel, <a href="Gee%20Cross">Gee Cross</a>. Helen was the daughter of Jane Ashton (1806–1884) and John Leech, a wealthy cotton merchant and shipbuilder from <a href="Stalybridge">Stalybridge</a>. Helen's first cousin was <a href="Lupton%20family">Harriet Lupton ("née" Ashton)</a> – the sister of <a href="Thomas%20Ashton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Ashton%20of%20Hyde">Thomas Ashton, 1st Baron Ashton of Hyde</a>. It was reported in July 2014 that Beatrix had personally given a number of her own original hand-painted illustrations to the two daughters of <a href="Lupton%20family">Dr Arthur and Harriet Lupton</a>, who were blood cousins to both Beatrix and the <a href="Catherine%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Cambridge">Duchess of Cambridge</a>.

Beatrix's parents lived comfortably at 2 Bolton Gardens, <a href="West%20Brompton">West Brompton</a>, where Helen Beatrix was born on 28 July 1866 and her brother Walter Bertram on 14 March 1872. Beatrix lived in the house until her marriage in 1913. The house was destroyed in the Blitz. Bousfield Primary School now stands where the house once was. A blue plaque on the school building testifies to the former site of The Potter home.

Both parents were artistically talented, and Rupert was an adept amateur photographer. Rupert had invested in the stock market and by the early 1890s was extremely wealthy.

Potter's family on both sides were from the <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> area. They were English <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarians</a>, associated with dissenting Protestant congregations, influential in 19th century England, that affirmed the oneness of God and that rejected the doctrine of the Trinity.

Beatrix was educated by three able governesses, the last of whom was Annie Moore ("née" Carter), just three years older than Beatrix, who tutored Beatrix in German as well as acting as <a href="lady%27s%20companion">lady's companion</a>. She and Beatrix remained friends throughout their lives and Annie's eight children were the recipients of many of Potter's delightful picture letters. It was Annie who later suggested that these letters might make good children's books.

She and her younger brother Walter Bertram (1872–1918) grew up with few friends outside their large extended family. Her parents were artistic, interested in nature, and enjoyed the countryside. As children, Beatrix and Bertram had numerous small animals as pets which they observed closely and drew endlessly. In their school room, Beatrix and Bertram kept a variety of small pets, mice, rabbits, a hedgehog and some bats, along with collections of butterflies and other insects which they drew and studied. Beatrix was devoted to the care of her small animals, often taking them with her on long holidays. In most of the first fifteen years of her life, Beatrix spent summer holidays at <a href="Dalguise">Dalguise</a>, an estate on the <a href="River%20Tay">River Tay</a> in Perthshire, Scotland. There she sketched and explored an area that nourished her imagination and her observation. Beatrix and her brother were allowed great freedom in the country and both children became adept students of <a href="natural%20history">natural history</a>. In 1887, when Dalguise was no longer available, the Potters took their first summer holiday in the <a href="Lake%20District">Lake District</a>, at <a href="Wray%20Castle">Wray Castle</a> near <a href="Windermere">Lake Windermere</a>. Here Beatrix met <a href="Hardwicke%20Rawnsley">Hardwicke Rawnsley</a>, vicar of Wray and later the founding secretary of the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a>, whose interest in the countryside and country life inspired the same in Beatrix and who was to have a lasting impact on her life.

At about the age of 14, Beatrix began to keep a diary. It was written in a code of her own devising which was a simple letter for letter <a href="Substitution%20cipher">substitution</a>. Her "Journal" was important to the development of her creativity, serving as both sketchbook and literary experiment: in tiny handwriting she reported on society, recorded her impressions of art and artists, recounted stories and observed life around her. The "Journal", decoded and transcribed by Leslie Linder in 1958, does not provide an intimate record of her personal life, but it is an invaluable source for understanding a vibrant part of British society in the late 19th century. It describes Potter's maturing artistic and intellectual interests, her often amusing insights on the places she visited, and her unusual ability to observe nature and to describe it. Started in 1881, her journal ends in 1897 when her artistic and intellectual energies were absorbed in scientific study and in efforts to publish her drawings. Precocious but reserved and often bored, she was searching for more independent activities and wished to earn some money of her own whilst dutifully taking care of her parents, dealing with her especially demanding mother, and managing their various households.

Beatrix Potter's parents did not discourage higher education. As was common in the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>, women of her class were privately educated and rarely went to university.

Beatrix Potter was interested in every branch of natural science save <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>. <a href="Botany">Botany</a> was a passion for most <a href="Victorians">Victorians</a> and nature study was a popular enthusiasm. Potter was eclectic in her tastes: collecting fossils, studying <a href="archeology">archeological</a> artefacts from London excavations, and interested in <a href="entomology">entomology</a>. In all these areas she drew and painted her specimens with increasing skill. By the 1890s her scientific interests centred on <a href="mycology">mycology</a>. First drawn to fungi because of their colours and evanescence in nature and her delight in painting them, her interest deepened after meeting Charles McIntosh, a revered naturalist and amateur mycologist, during a summer holiday in Dunkeld in <a href="Perthshire">Perthshire</a> in 1892. He helped improve the accuracy of her illustrations, taught her <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a>, and supplied her with live specimens to paint during the winter. Curious as to how fungi reproduced, Potter began microscopic drawings of fungus spores (the <a href="agaric">agaric</a>s) and in 1895 developed a theory of their <a href="germination">germination</a>. Through the connections of her uncle <a href="Henry%20Enfield%20Roscoe">Sir Henry Enfield Roscoe</a>, a chemist and <a href="vice-chancellor%20%28education%29">vice-chancellor</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a>, she consulted with botanists at <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Kew">Kew Gardens</a>, convincing <a href="George%20Edward%20Massee">George Massee</a> of her ability to germinate spores and her theory of <a href="F1%20hybrid">hybridisation</a>. She did not believe in the theory of <a href="symbiosis">symbiosis</a> proposed by <a href="Simon%20Schwendener">Simon Schwendener</a>, the German mycologist, as previously thought; rather she proposed a more independent process of reproduction.

Rebuffed by <a href="William%20Turner%20Thiselton-Dyer">William Thiselton-Dyer</a>, the Director at Kew, because of her sex and her amateur status, Beatrix wrote up her conclusions and submitted a paper, "On the Germination of the Spores of the Agaricineae", to the <a href="Linnean%20Society">Linnean Society</a> in 1897. It was introduced by Massee because, as a female, Potter could not attend proceedings or read her paper. She subsequently withdrew it, realising that some of her samples were contaminated, but continued her microscopic studies for several more years. Her paper has only recently been rediscovered, along with the rich, artistic illustrations and drawings that accompanied it. Her work is only now being properly evaluated. Potter later gave her other mycological and scientific drawings to the <a href="Armitt%20Library">Armitt Museum and Library</a> in Ambleside, where mycologists still refer to them to identify fungi. There is also a collection of her fungus paintings at the <a href="Perth%20Museum%20and%20Art%20Gallery">Perth Museum and Art Gallery</a> in Perth, Scotland, donated by Charles McIntosh. In 1967, the mycologist <a href="Walter%20Philip%20Kennedy%20Findlay">W.P.K. Findlay</a> included many of Potter's beautifully accurate fungus drawings in his "Wayside & Woodland Fungi", thereby fulfilling her desire to one day have her fungus drawings published in a book. In 1997, the Linnean Society issued a posthumous apology to Potter for the sexism displayed in its handling of her research.

Potter's artistic and literary interests were deeply influenced by fairies, fairy tales and fantasy. She was a student of the classic fairy tales of Western Europe. As well as stories from the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a>, <a href="John%20Bunyan">John Bunyan</a>'s "<a href="The%20Pilgrim%27s%20Progress">The Pilgrim's Progress</a>" and <a href="Harriet%20Beecher%20Stowe">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>'s "<a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a>", she grew up with "<a href="Aesop%27s%20Fables">Aesop's Fables</a>", the fairy tales of the <a href="Brothers%20Grimm">Brothers Grimm</a> and <a href="Hans%20Christian%20Andersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a>, <a href="Charles%20Kingsley">Charles Kingsley</a>'s "<a href="The%20Water-Babies%2C%20A%20Fairy%20Tale%20for%20a%20Land%20Baby">The Water Babies</a>", the folk tales and <a href="Scottish%20mythology">mythology of Scotland</a>, the <a href="German%20Romanticism">German Romantics</a>, <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, and the romances of <a href="Sir%20Walter%20Scott">Sir Walter Scott</a>. As a young child, before the age of eight, <a href="Edward%20Lear">Edward Lear</a>'s "Book of Nonsense", including the much loved "<a href="The%20Owl%20and%20the%20Pussycat">The Owl and the Pussycat</a>", and <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>'s "<a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a>" had made their impression, although she later said of "Alice" that she was more interested in <a href="John%20Tenniel">Tenniel</a>'s illustrations than what they were about. The "<a href="Brer%20Rabbit">Brer Rabbit</a>" stories of <a href="Joel%20Chandler%20Harris">Joel Chandler Harris</a> had been family favourites, and she later studied his "<a href="Uncle%20Remus">Uncle Remus</a>" stories and illustrated them. She studied book illustration from a young age and developed her own tastes, but the work of the picture book triumvirate <a href="Walter%20Crane">Walter Crane</a>, <a href="Kate%20Greenaway">Kate Greenaway</a> and <a href="Randolph%20Caldecott">Randolph Caldecott</a>, the last an illustrator whose work was later collected by her father, was a great influence. When she started to illustrate, she chose first the traditional rhymes and stories, "<a href="Cinderella">Cinderella</a>", "<a href="Sleeping%20Beauty">Sleeping Beauty</a>", "<a href="Ali%20Baba%20and%20the%20Forty%20Thieves">Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves</a>", "<a href="Puss%20in%20Boots">Puss-in-boots</a>", and "<a href="Red%20Riding%20Hood">Red Riding Hood</a>". But most often her illustrations were fantasies featuring her own pets: mice, rabbits, kittens, and guinea pigs.

In her teenage years, Potter was a regular visitor to the art galleries of London, particularly enjoying the summer and winter exhibitions at the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a> in London. Her "Journal" reveals her growing sophistication as a critic as well as the influence of her father's friend, the artist <a href="Sir%20John%20Everett%20Millais">Sir John Everett Millais</a>, who recognised Beatrix's talent of observation. Although Potter was aware of art and artistic trends, her drawing and her prose style were uniquely her own.

As a way to earn money in the 1890s, Beatrix and her brother began to print Christmas cards of their own design, as well as cards for special occasions. Mice and rabbits were the most frequent subject of her fantasy paintings. In 1890, the firm of Hildesheimer and Faulkner bought several of her drawings of her rabbit <a href="Benjamin%20Bunny">Benjamin Bunny</a> to illustrate verses by <a href="Frederic%20Weatherly">Frederic Weatherly</a> titled "A Happy Pair". In 1893, the same printer bought several more drawings for Weatherly's "Our Dear Relations", another book of rhymes, and the following year Potter sold a series of frog illustrations and verses for "Changing Pictures", a popular annual offered by the art publisher Ernest Nister. Potter was pleased by this success and determined to publish her own illustrated stories.

Whenever Potter went on holiday to the <a href="Lake%20District">Lake District</a> or <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, she sent letters to young friends, illustrating them with quick sketches. Many of these letters were written to the children of her former governess Annie Carter Moore, particularly to Moore's eldest son Noel who was often ill. In September 1893, Potter was on holiday at Eastwood in <a href="Dunkeld">Dunkeld</a>, Perthshire. She had run out of things to say to Noel and so she told him a story about "four little rabbits whose names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter". It became one of the most famous children's letters ever written and the basis of Potter's future career as a writer-artist-storyteller.

In 1900, Potter revised her tale about the four little rabbits, and fashioned a dummy book of it – it has been suggested, in imitation of <a href="Helen%20Bannerman">Helen Bannerman</a>'s 1899 bestseller "<a href="The%20Story%20of%20Little%20Black%20Sambo">The Story of Little Black Sambo</a>". Unable to find a buyer for the work, she published it for family and friends at her own expense in December 1901. It was drawn in black and white with a coloured frontispiece. Family friend <a href="canon%20%28priest%29">Canon</a> <a href="Hardwicke%20Rawnsley">Hardwicke Rawnsley</a> had great faith in Potter's tale, recast it in didactic verse, and made the rounds of the London publishing houses. <a href="Frederick%20Warne%20%26amp%3B%20Co">Frederick Warne & Co</a> had previously rejected the tale but, eager to compete in the booming small format children's book market, reconsidered and accepted the "bunny book" (as the firm called it) following the recommendation of their prominent children's book artist <a href="L.%20Leslie%20Brooke">L. Leslie Brooke</a>. The firm declined Rawnsley's verse in favour of Potter's original prose, and Potter agreed to colour her pen and ink illustrations, choosing the then new <a href="Edmund%20Evans%23Later%20work%20and%20retirement">Hentschel three-colour process</a> to reproduce her watercolours.

On 2 October 1902, "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Peter%20Rabbit">The Tale of Peter Rabbit</a>" was published, and was an immediate success. It was followed the next year by "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Squirrel%20Nutkin">The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin</a>" and "<a href="The%20Tailor%20of%20Gloucester">The Tailor of Gloucester</a>", which had also first been written as picture letters to the Moore children. Working with <a href="Norman%20Warne">Norman Warne</a> as her editor, Potter published two or three little books each year: 23 books in all. The last book in this format was "<a href="Cecily%20Parsley%27s%20Nursery%20Rhymes">Cecily Parsley's Nursery Rhymes</a>" in 1922, a collection of favourite rhymes. Although "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Little%20Pig%20Robinson">The Tale of Little Pig Robinson</a>" was not published until 1930, it had been written much earlier. Potter continued creating her little books until after the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, when her energies were increasingly directed toward her farming, sheep-breeding and land conservation.

The immense popularity of Potter's books was based on the lively quality of her illustrations, the non-didactic nature of her stories, the depiction of the rural countryside, and the imaginative qualities she lent to her animal characters.

Potter was also a canny businesswoman. As early as 1903, she made and patented a <a href="Peter%20Rabbit">Peter Rabbit</a> doll. It was followed by other "spin-off" merchandise over the years, including painting books, board games, wall-paper, figurines, baby blankets and china tea-sets. All were licensed by <a href="Frederick%20Warne%20%26amp%3B%20Co">Frederick Warne & Co</a> and earned Potter an independent income, as well as immense profits for her publisher.

In 1905, Potter and <a href="Norman%20Warne">Norman Warne</a> became unofficially engaged. Potter's parents objected to the match because Warne was "in trade" and thus not socially suitable. The engagement lasted only one month until Warne died of <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a> at age 37. That same year, Potter used some of her income and a small inheritance from an aunt to buy <a href="Hill%20Top%20Farm">Hill Top Farm</a> in <a href="Near%20Sawrey">Near Sawrey</a> in the English <a href="Lake%20District">Lake District</a> near Windermere. Potter and Warne may have hoped that Hill Top Farm would be their holiday home, but after Warne's death, Potter went ahead with its purchase as she had always wanted to own that farm, and live in "that charming village".

The tenant farmer John Cannon and his family agreed to stay on to manage the farm for her while she made physical improvements and learned the techniques of <a href="fell%20farming">fell farming</a> and of raising livestock, including pigs, cows and chickens; the following year she added sheep. Realising she needed to protect her boundaries, she sought advice from W.H. Heelis & Son, a local firm of solicitors with offices in nearby <a href="Hawkshead">Hawkshead</a>. With William Heelis acting for her she bought contiguous pasture, and in 1909 the Castle Farm across the road from Hill Top Farm. She visited Hill Top at every opportunity, and her books written during this period (such as "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Ginger%20and%20Pickles">The Tale of Ginger and Pickles</a>", about the local shop in Near Sawrey and "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Mrs.%20Tittlemouse">The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse</a>", a wood mouse) reflect her increasing participation in village life and her delight in country living.

Owning and managing these working farms required routine collaboration with the widely respected William Heelis. By the summer of 1912 Heelis had proposed marriage and Beatrix had accepted; although she did not immediately tell her parents, who once again disapproved because Heelis was only a country solicitor. Potter and Heelis were married on 15 October 1913 in London at <a href="St%20Mary%20Abbots">St Mary Abbots</a> in <a href="Kensington">Kensington</a>. The couple moved immediately to <a href="Near%20and%20Far%20Sawrey">Near Sawrey</a>, residing at Castle Cottage, the renovated farm house on Castle Farm, which was 34 acres large. Hill Top remained a working farm but was now remodelled to allow for the tenant family and Potter's private studio and workshop. At last her own woman, Potter settled into the partnerships that shaped the rest of her life: her country solicitor husband and his large family, her farms, the Sawrey community and the predictable rounds of country life. "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Jemima%20Puddle-Duck">The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck</a>" and "<a href="The%20Tale%20of%20Tom%20Kitten">The Tale of Tom Kitten</a>" are representative of Hill Top Farm and of her farming life, and reflect her happiness with her country life.

Rupert Potter died in 1914 and, with the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Potter, now a wealthy woman, persuaded her mother to move to the Lake District and found a property for her to rent in Sawrey. Finding life in Sawrey dull, Helen Potter soon moved to Lindeth Howe (now a 34 bedroomed country house hotel) a large house the Potters had previously rented for the summer in <a href="Bowness-on-Windermere">Bowness</a>, on the other side of Lake Windermere, Potter continued to write stories for Frederick Warne & Co and fully participated in country life. She established a Nursing Trust for local villages, and served on various committees and councils responsible for footpaths and other rural issues.

Soon after acquiring Hill Top Farm, Potter became keenly interested in the breeding and raising of <a href="Herdwick">Herdwick sheep</a>, the indigenous fell sheep. In 1923 she bought a large sheep farm in the Troutbeck Valley called <a href="Troutbeck%20Park">Troutbeck Park Farm</a>, formerly a deer park, restoring its land with thousands of Herdwick sheep. This established her as one of the major Herdwick sheep farmers in the county. She was admired by her shepherds and farm managers for her willingness to experiment with the latest biological remedies for the common diseases of sheep, and for her employment of the best shepherds, sheep breeders, and farm managers.

By the late 1920s Potter and her Hill Top farm manager Tom Storey had made a name for their prize-winning Herdwick flock, which took many prizes at the local agricultural shows, where Potter was often asked to serve as a judge. In 1942 she became President-elect of the Herdwick Sheepbreeders’ Association, the first time a woman had ever been elected, but died before taking office.

Potter had been a disciple of the land conservation and preservation ideals of her long-time friend and mentor, <a href="Hardwicke%20Rawnsley">Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley</a>, the first secretary and founding member of the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty</a>. She supported the efforts of the National Trust to preserve not just the places of extraordinary beauty but also those heads of valleys and low grazing lands that would be irreparably ruined by development. She was also an authority on the traditional Lakeland crafts, period furniture and stonework. She restored and preserved the farms that she bought or managed, making sure that each farm house had in it a piece of antique Lakeland furniture. Potter was interested in preserving not only the <a href="Herdwick%20sheep">Herdwick sheep</a>, but also the way of life of fell farming. In 1930 the Heelises became partners with the National Trust in buying and managing the fell farms included in the large Monk Coniston Estate. The estate was composed of many farms spread over a wide area of north-western Lancashire, including the <a href="Tarn%20Hows">Tarn Hows</a>. Potter was the "de facto" estate manager for the Trust for seven years until the National Trust could afford to buy most of the property back from her. Her stewardship of these farms earned her wide regard, but she was not without her critics, not the least of which were her contemporaries who felt she used her wealth and the position of her husband to acquire properties in advance of their being made public. She was notable in observing the problems of <a href="afforestation">afforestation</a>, preserving the intake grazing lands, and husbanding the quarries and timber on these farms. All her farms were stocked with Herdwick sheep and frequently with <a href="Galloway%20cattle">Galloway cattle</a>.
Potter continued to write stories and to draw, although mostly for her own pleasure. Her books in the late 1920s included the semi-autobiographical "<a href="The%20Fairy%20Caravan">The Fairy Caravan</a>", a fanciful tale set in her beloved <a href="Troutbeck%20Tongue">Troutbeck fells</a>. It was published only in the US during Potter's lifetime, and not until 1952 in the UK. "Sister Anne", Potter's version of the story of <a href="Bluebeard">Bluebeard</a>, was written especially for her American readers, but illustrated by Katharine Sturges. A final folktale, "Wag by Wall", was published posthumously by "<a href="The%20Horn%20Book%20Magazine">The Horn Book Magazine</a>" in 1944. Potter was a generous patron of the <a href="Girl%20Guides">Girl Guides</a>, whose troupes she allowed to make their summer encampments on her land, and whose company she enjoyed as an older woman.

Potter and William Heelis enjoyed a happy marriage of thirty years, continuing their farming and preservation efforts throughout the hard days of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Although they were childless, Potter played an important role in William's large family, particularly enjoying her relationship with several nieces whom she helped educate, and giving comfort and aid to her husband's brothers and sisters.

Potter died of complications from <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and <a href="heart%20disease">heart disease</a> on 22 December 1943 at Castle Cottage, and her remains were cremated at <a href="Carleton%20Crematorium%20and%20Cemetery">Carleton Crematorium</a>. She left nearly all her property to the National Trust, including over of land, sixteen farms, cottages and herds of cattle and Herdwick sheep. Hers was the largest gift at that time to the National Trust, and it enabled the preservation of the land now included in the <a href="Lake%20District%20National%20Park">Lake District National Park</a> and the continuation of fell farming. The central office of the National Trust in <a href="Swindon">Swindon</a> was named "Heelis" in 2005 in her memory. William Heelis continued his stewardship of their properties and of her literary and artistic work for the eighteen months he survived her. When he died in August 1945 he left the remainder to the National Trust.

Potter left almost all the original illustrations for her books to the National Trust. The copyright to her stories and merchandise was then given to her publisher Frederick Warne & Co, now a division of the <a href="Penguin%20Group">Penguin Group</a>. On 1 January 2014, the copyright expired in the UK and other countries with a 70-years-after-death limit. Hill Top Farm was opened to the public by the National Trust in 1946; her artwork was displayed there until 1985 when it was moved to William Heelis's former law offices in <a href="Hawkshead">Hawkshead</a>, also owned by the National Trust as the <a href="Beatrix%20Potter%20Gallery">Beatrix Potter Gallery</a>.

Potter gave her folios of mycological drawings to the <a href="Armitt%20Library">Armitt Library and Museum</a> in <a href="Ambleside">Ambleside</a> before her death.

Liberal Party (UK)

The Liberal Party was a political party which, with the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a>, was one of the two <a href="Major%20party">major</a> <a href="political%20parties%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">parties in the United Kingdom</a> in the 19th and early 20th century.

The party arose from an alliance of <a href="Whigs%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whigs</a> and <a href="Free%20trade">free-trade</a> <a href="Peelite">Peelite</a>s and <a href="Radicals%20%28UK%29">Radicals</a> favourable to the ideals of the American and French Revolutions in the 1850s. By the end of the nineteenth century, it had formed four governments under <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Gladstone</a>. Despite splitting over the issue of <a href="Irish%20Home%20Rule%20Movement">Irish Home Rule</a>, the party returned to power in 1906 with <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201906">a landslide victory</a>.

It passed the <a href="Liberal%20welfare%20reforms">welfare reforms</a> that created a basic British welfare state. <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a> was Liberal <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> between 1908 and 1916, followed by <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>, 1916-22. Although Asquith was the Party leader, the dominant figure was Lloyd George. Asquith was overwhelmed by the wartime role of coalition prime minister, and Lloyd George replaced him as the coalition prime minister in late 1916 but Asquith remained Liberal party leader. The two fought for years over control of the party, badly weakening it in the process. Historian Martin Pugh in "The Oxford Companion to British History" argues that Lloyd George:

The Lloyd George coalition was dominated by the Conservative Party, which finally deposed him in 1922. By the end of the 1920s, the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> had replaced the Liberals as the Conservatives' main rival. The party went into decline after 1918 and by the 1950s won no more than six seats at general elections. Apart from notable <a href="by-election">by-election</a> victories, the party's fortunes did not improve significantly until it formed the <a href="SDP%E2%80%93Liberal%20Alliance">SDP–Liberal Alliance</a> with the newly formed <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20%28UK%29">Social Democratic Party</a> (SDP) in 1981. At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201983">1983 General Election</a>, the Alliance won over a quarter of the vote, but only 23 of the 650 seats it contested. At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201987">1987 General Election</a>, its vote fell below 23% and the Liberal and Social Democratic parties merged in 1988 to form the <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrats</a>. A splinter group reconstituted the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%2C%201989%29">Liberal Party</a> in 1989. It was formed by party members opposed to the merger who saw the Lib Dems diluting Liberal ideals.

Prominent intellectuals associated with the Liberal Party include the philosopher <a href="John%20Stuart%20Mill">John Stuart Mill</a>, the economist <a href="John%20Maynard%20Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a>, and social planner <a href="William%20Beveridge">William Beveridge</a>.

The Liberal Party grew out of the <a href="Whiggism">Whigs</a>, who had their origins in an <a href="aristocracy%20%28class%29">aristocratic</a> faction in the reign of <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a>, and the early 19th century <a href="Radicals%20%28UK%29">Radicals</a>. The Whigs were in favour of reducing the power of the Crown and increasing the power of <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament</a>. Although their motives in this were originally to gain more power for themselves, the more idealistic Whigs gradually came to support an expansion of <a href="democracy">democracy</a> for its own sake. The great figures of reformist <a href="Whiggism">Whiggery</a> were <a href="Charles%20James%20Fox">Charles James Fox</a> (died 1806) and his disciple and successor <a href="Charles%20Grey%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Grey">Earl Grey</a>. After decades in opposition, the Whigs returned to power under Grey in 1830 and carried the <a href="Reform%20Act%201832">First Reform Act</a> in 1832.

The Reform Act was the climax of Whiggism, but it also brought about the Whigs' demise. The admission of the <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a>es to the franchise and to the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> led eventually to the development of a systematic middle class liberalism and the end of Whiggery, although for many years reforming aristocrats held senior positions in the party. In the years after Grey's retirement, the party was led first by <a href="William%20Lamb%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Melbourne">Lord Melbourne</a>, a fairly traditional Whig, and then by <a href="John%20Russell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Russell">Lord John Russell</a>, the son of a Duke but a crusading radical, and by <a href="Henry%20John%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a>, a renegade Irish <a href="Tory">Tory</a> and essentially a <a href="conservatism">conservative</a>, although capable of radical gestures.

As early as 1839 Russell had adopted the name of "Liberals", but in reality his party was a loose coalition of Whigs in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> and <a href="Radicals%20%28UK%29">Radicals</a> in the Commons. The leading Radicals were <a href="John%20Bright">John Bright</a> and <a href="Richard%20Cobden">Richard Cobden</a>, who represented the manufacturing towns which had gained representation under the Reform Act. They favoured social reform, personal liberty, reducing the powers of the Crown and the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> (many of them were <a href="Nonconformism">Nonconformists</a>), avoidance of war and foreign alliances (which were bad for business), and above all <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a>. For a century, free trade remained the one cause which could unite all Liberals.

In 1841 the Liberals lost office to the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservatives</a> under <a href="Robert%20Peel">Sir Robert Peel</a>, but their period in <a href="Official%20Opposition%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">opposition</a> was short, because the Conservatives split over the repeal of the <a href="Corn%20Laws">Corn Laws</a>, a free trade issue, and a faction known as the <a href="Peelite">Peelite</a>s (but not Peel himself, who died soon after) defected to the Liberal side. This allowed ministries led by Russell, Palmerston, and the Peelite <a href="George%20Hamilton-Gordon%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Aberdeen">Lord Aberdeen</a> to hold office for most of the 1850s and 1860s. A leading Peelite was <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a>, who was a reforming <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> in most of these governments. The formal foundation of the Liberal Party is traditionally traced to 1859 and the formation of Palmerston's second government.

The Whig-Radical amalgam could not become a true modern political party, however, while it was dominated by aristocrats, and it was not until the departure of the "Two Terrible Old Men", Russell and Palmerston, that Gladstone could become the first leader of the modern Liberal Party. This was brought about by Palmerston's death in 1865 and Russell's retirement in 1868. After a brief Conservative government (during which the <a href="Reform%20Act%201867">Second Reform Act</a> was passed by agreement between the parties) Gladstone won a huge victory at the 1868 election and formed the first Liberal government. The establishment of the party as a national membership organisation came with the foundation of the <a href="National%20Liberal%20Federation">National Liberal Federation</a> in 1877.

<a href="John%20Stuart%20Mill">John Stuart Mill</a> was a Liberal MP from 1865 to 1868.

For the next thirty years Gladstone and Liberalism were synonymous. <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a> served as prime minister four times (1868–74, 1880–85, 1886, and 1892–94). His financial policies, based on the notion of balanced budgets, low taxes, and "<a href="laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a>", were suited to a developing capitalist society, but they could not respond effectively as economic and social conditions changed. Called the "Grand Old Man" later in life, Gladstone was always a dynamic popular orator who appealed strongly to the <a href="working%20class">working class</a> and to the lower middle class. Deeply religious, Gladstone brought a new moral tone to politics, with his evangelical sensibility and his opposition to aristocracy. His moralism often angered his upper-class opponents (including Queen Victoria), and his heavy-handed control split the Liberal Party.

In foreign policy, Gladstone was in general against foreign entanglements, but he did not resist the realities of imperialism. For example, he approved of the occupation of <a href="History%20of%20Egypt%20under%20the%20British">Egypt</a> by British forces in 1882. His goal was to create a European order based on co-operation rather than conflict and on mutual trust instead of rivalry and suspicion; the <a href="rule%20of%20law">rule of law</a> was to supplant the reign of force and self-interest. This Gladstonian concept of a harmonious <a href="Concert%20of%20Europe">Concert of Europe</a> was opposed to and ultimately defeated by a <a href="Bismarckian">Bismarckian</a> system of manipulated alliances and antagonisms.

As prime minister 1868 to 1874, Gladstone headed a Liberal Party which was a coalition of Peelites like himself, Whigs, and Radicals; he was now a spokesman for "peace, economy and reform." One major achievement was the <a href="Elementary%20Education%20Act%201870">Elementary Education Act of 1870</a>, which provided England with an adequate system of elementary schools for the first time. He also secured the abolition of the purchase of commissions in the army and of religious tests for admission to Oxford and Cambridge; the introduction of the secret ballot in elections; the legalization of trade unions; and the reorganization of the judiciary in the Judicature Act.

Regarding Ireland, the major Liberal achievements were land reform, where he <a href="Irish%20Land%20Acts">ended centuries of landlord oppression</a>, and the <a href="State%20religion%23Disestablishment">disestablishment</a> of the (Anglican) <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> through the <a href="Irish%20Church%20Act%201869">Irish Church Act 1869</a>.

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201874">1874 general election</a> Gladstone was defeated by the Conservatives under Disraeli during a sharp economic recession. He formally resigned as Liberal leader and was succeeded by the <a href="Spencer%20Compton%20Cavendish%2C%208th%20Duke%20of%20Devonshire">Marquess of Hartington</a>, but he soon changed his mind and returned to active politics. He strongly disagreed with Disraeli's pro-<a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> foreign policy and in 1880 he conducted the first outdoor mass-election campaign in Britain, known as the <a href="Midlothian%20campaign">Midlothian campaign</a>. The Liberals won a large majority in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201880">1880 election</a>. Hartington ceded his place and Gladstone resumed office.

Among the consequences of the <a href="Third%20Reform%20Act">Third Reform Act</a> (1884) was the giving of the vote to many Catholics in Ireland. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201885">1885 general election</a> the <a href="Irish%20Parliamentary%20Party">Irish Parliamentary Party</a> held the balance of power in the House of Commons, and demanded <a href="Irish%20Home%20Rule">Irish Home Rule</a> as the price of support for a continued Gladstone ministry. Gladstone personally supported Home Rule, but a strong <a href="Liberal%20Unionist">Liberal Unionist</a> faction led by <a href="Joseph%20Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a>, along with the last of the Whigs, Hartington, opposed it. The Irish Home Rule bill gave all owners of Irish land a chance to sell to the state at a price equal to 20 years' purchase of the rents and allowing tenants to purchase the land. Irish nationalist reaction was mixed, Unionist opinion was hostile, and the election addresses during the 1886 election revealed English radicals to be against the bill also. Among the Liberal rank and file, several Gladstonian candidates disowned the bill, reflecting fears at the constituency level that the interests of the working people were being sacrificed to finance a rescue operation for the landed elite.

The result was a catastrophic split in the Liberal Party, and heavy defeat in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201886">1886 election</a> at the hands of <a href="Robert%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Lord Salisbury</a>. There was a final weak Gladstone ministry in 1892, but it also was dependent on Irish support and failed to get Irish Home Rule through the House of Lords.

Historically, the aristocracy was divided between Conservatives and Liberals. However, when Gladstone committed to home rule for Ireland, Britain's upper classes largely abandoned the Liberal party, giving the Conservatives a large permanent majority in the House of Lords. High Society in London, following the Queen, largely ostracized home rulers, and Liberal clubs were badly split. <a href="Joseph%20Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a> took a major element of upper-class supporters out of the Party and into a third party called "Liberal Unionism" on the Irish issue. It collaborated with and eventually merged into the Conservative party. The Gladstonian liberals in 1891 adopted "<a href="The%20Newcastle%20Programme">The Newcastle Programme</a> that included home rule for Ireland, disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales and Scotland, tighter controls on the sale of liquor, major extension of factory regulation, and various democratic political reforms. The Programme had a strong appeal to the Nonconformist middle-class Liberal element, which felt liberated by the departure of the aristocracy.

A major long-term consequence of the Third Reform Act was the rise of <a href="Liberal-Labour%20%28UK%29">Lib-Lab</a> candidates, in the absence of any committed <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>. The Act split all county constituencies (which were represented by multiple MPs) into single-member constituencies, roughly corresponding to population patterns. In areas with working class majorities, in particular coal-mining areas, Lib-Lab candidates were popular, and they received sponsorship and endorsement from <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a>s. In the first election after the Act was passed (1885), thirteen were elected, up from two in 1874. The Third Reform Act also facilitated the demise of the Whig old guard: in two-member constituencies, it was common to pair a Whig and a radical under the Liberal banner. After the Third Reform Act, fewer Whigs were selected as candidates.

A broad range of interventionist reforms were introduced by the 1892-95 Liberal government. Amongst other measures, The standard of accommodation and of teaching in the public schools was improved, factory inspection was made more stringent, and ministers used their powers to increase the wages and reduce the working hours of large numbers of male workers employed by the state.

Historian Walter L. Arnstein, concludes:

Gladstone finally retired in 1894. Gladstone's support for Home Rule deeply divided the party, and it lost its upper and upper-middle-class base, while keeping support among Protestant nonconformists and the Celtic fringe. Historian <a href="R.%20C.%20K.%20Ensor">R. C. K. Ensor</a> reports that after 1886, the main Liberal Party was deserted by practically the entire whig peerage and the great majority of the upper-class and upper-middle-class members. High prestige London clubs that had a Liberal base were deeply split. Ensor notes that, "London society, following the known views of the Queen, practically ostracized home rulers." 

The new Liberal leader was the ineffectual <a href="Archibald%20Primrose%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Rosebery">Lord Rosebery</a>. He led the party to a heavy defeat in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201895">1895 general election</a>.

The Liberal Party lacked a unified ideological base in 1906. It contained numerous contradictory and hostile factions, such as imperialists and supporters of the Boers; near-socialists and laissez-faire classical liberals; suffragettes and opponents of women's suffrage; antiwar elements and supporters of the <a href="Entente%20Cordiale">military alliance with France</a>. Non-Conformist Dissenters – Protestants outside the Anglican fold – were a powerful element, dedicated to opposing the established church in terms of education and taxation. However, the Dissenters were losing support and society at large and played a lesser role in party affairs after 1900. The Party, furthermore, also included Irish Catholics, and secularists from the labour movement. Many Conservatives (including Winston Churchill) had recently protested against high tariff moves by the Conservatives by switching to the anti-tariff Liberal camp, but it was unclear how many old Conservative traits they brought along, especially on military and naval issues.

The middle-class business, professional and intellectual communities were generally strongholds, although some old aristocratic families played important roles as well. The working class element was moving rapidly toward the newly emerging Labour Party. One uniting element was widespread agreement on the use of politics and Parliament as a device to upgrade and improve society and to reform politics. All Liberals were outraged when Conservatives used their majority in the House of Lords to block reform legislation.

The late nineteenth century saw the emergence of “New Liberalism” within the Liberal Party, which advocated state intervention as a means of guaranteeing freedom and removing obstacles to it such as poverty and unemployment. The policies of the New Liberalism are now known as <a href="social%20liberalism">social liberalism</a>.

The New Liberals included intellectuals like <a href="Leonard%20Trelawny%20Hobhouse">L. T. Hobhouse</a>, and <a href="John%20A.%20Hobson">John A. Hobson</a>. They saw individual liberty as something achievable only under favourable social and economic circumstances. In their view, the poverty, squalor, and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. New Liberals believed that these conditions could be ameliorated only through collective action coordinated by a strong, welfare-oriented, and interventionist state.

After the historic 1906 victory, the Liberal Party introduced multiple reforms on range of issues, including <a href="health%20insurance">health insurance</a>, <a href="unemployment%20insurance">unemployment insurance</a>, and <a href="pension">pension</a>s for elderly workers, thereby laying the groundwork for the future British <a href="welfare%20state">welfare state</a>. Some proposals failed, such as licensing fewer pubs, or rolling back Conservative educational policies. The <a href="People%27s%20Budget">People's Budget</a> of 1909, championed by <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a> and fellow Liberal <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, introduced unprecedented taxes on the wealthy in Britain and radical social welfare programmes to the country's policies. It was the first budget with the expressed intent of redistributing wealth among the public. It imposed increased taxes on luxuries, liquor, tobacco, high incomes, and land -- taxation that disproportionately affected the rich. The new money was to be made available for new welfare programmes as well as new battleships. In 1911 Lloyd George succeeded in putting through Parliament his <a href="National%20Insurance%20Act">National Insurance Act</a>, making provision for sickness and invalidism, and this was followed by his <a href="Unemployment%20Insurance%20Act%201920">Unemployment Insurance Act</a>.

Historian Peter Weiler argues that:

Contrasting Old Liberalism with New Liberalism, David Lloyd George noted in a 1908 speech that the old Liberals:

The Liberals languished in opposition for a decade, while the coalition of Salisbury and Chamberlain held power. The 1890s were marred by infighting between the three principal successors to Gladstone, party leader <a href="William%20Vernon%20Harcourt%20%28politician%29">William Harcourt</a>, former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, and Gladstone's personal secretary, <a href="John%20Morley">John Morley</a>. This intrigue finally led Harcourt and Morley to resign their positions in 1898 as they continued to be at loggerheads with Rosebery over Irish home rule and issues relating to imperialism. Replacing Harcourt as party leader was Sir <a href="Henry%20Campbell-Bannerman">Henry Campbell-Bannerman</a>. Harcourt's resignation briefly muted the turmoil in the party, but the beginning of the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a> soon nearly broke the party apart, with Rosebery and a circle of supporters including important future Liberal figures H.H. Asquith, Edward Grey, and Richard Burdon Haldane forming a clique dubbed the "Liberal Imperialists" that supported the government in the prosecution of the war. On the other side, more radical members of the party formed a Pro-Boer faction that denounced the conflict and called for an immediate end to hostilities. Quickly rising to prominence among the Pro-Boers was David Lloyd George, a relatively new MP and a master of rhetoric, who took advantage of having a national stage to speak out on a controversial issue to make his name in the party. Harcourt and Morley also sided with this group, though with slightly different aims. Campbell-Bannerman tried to keep these forces together at the head of a moderate Liberal rump, but in 1901 he delivered a speech on the government's "methods of barbarism" in South Africa that pulled him further to the left and nearly tore the party in two. The party was saved after Salisbury's retirement in 1902 when his successor, <a href="Arthur%20Balfour">Arthur Balfour</a>, pushed a series of unpopular initiatives such as the <a href="Education%20Act%201902">Education Act 1902</a> and Joseph Chamberlain called for a new system of protectionist tariffs.

Campbell-Bannerman was able to rally the party around the traditional liberal platform of free trade and land reform and led them to <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201906">the greatest election victory</a> in their history. This would prove the last time the Liberals won a majority in their own right. Although he presided over a large majority, <a href="Henry%20Campbell-Bannerman">Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman</a> was overshadowed by his ministers, most notably <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a> at the Exchequer, <a href="Edward%20Grey%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Grey%20of%20Fallodon">Edward Grey</a> at the Foreign Office, <a href="Richard%20Burdon%20Haldane%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Haldane">Richard Burdon Haldane</a> at the War Office and <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a> at the Board of Trade. Campbell-Bannerman retired in 1908 and died soon after. He was succeeded by Asquith, who stepped up the government's radicalism. Lloyd George succeeded Asquith at the Exchequer, and was in turn succeeded at the Board of Trade by <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, a recent defector from the Conservatives.

The General Election of 1906 also represented a shift to the left by the Liberal Party. According to Rosemary Rees, almost half of the Liberal MPs elected in 1906 were supportive of the 'New Liberalism' (which advocated government action to improve people's lives),) while claims were made that “five-sixths of the Liberal party are left wing.” Other historians, however, have questioned the extent to which the Liberal Party experienced a leftward shift; according to Robert C. Self however, only between 50 and 60 Liberal MPs out of the 400 in the parliamentary party after 1906 were Social Radicals, with a core of 20 to 30. Nevertheless, important junior offices were held in the cabinet by what Duncan Tanner has termed "genuine New Liberals, Centrist reformers, and Fabian collectivists," and much legislation was pushed through by the Liberals in government. This included the regulation of working hours, <a href="National%20Insurance">National Insurance</a> and welfare.
A political battle erupted over the <a href="People%27s%20Budget">People's Budget</a> and resulted in the passage of an act ending the power of the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> to block legislation. The cost was high, however, as the government was required by the king to call two general elections in 1910 to validate its position and ended up frittering away most of its large majority, being left once again dependent on the <a href="Irish%20Parliamentary%20Party">Irish Nationalists</a>.

As a result, Asquith was forced to introduce a new <a href="Third%20Home%20Rule%20Act">third Home Rule bill</a> in 1912. Since the House of Lords no longer had the power to block the bill, the Unionist's <a href="Ulster%20Volunteers">Ulster Volunteers</a> led by Sir <a href="Edward%20Carson">Edward Carson</a>, launched a campaign of opposition that included the threat of armed resistance in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Ulster</a> and the threat of mass resignation of their commissions by army officers in Ireland in 1914 ("see <a href="Curragh%20Incident">Curragh Incident</a>"). In their resistance to Home Rule the Ulster Protestants had the full support of the Conservatives, whose leader, <a href="Bonar%20Law">Bonar Law</a>, was of <a href="Ulster%20Scots%20people">Ulster-Scots</a> descent. The country seemed to be on the brink of civil war when the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> broke out in August 1914. Historian <a href="George%20Dangerfield">George Dangerfield</a> has argued that the multiplicity of crises in 1910 to 1914, before the war broke out, so weakened the Liberal coalition that it marked the "<a href="Strange%20Death%20of%20Liberal%20England">Strange Death of Liberal England</a>". However, most historians date the collapse to the crisis of the First World War.

The Liberal Party might have survived a short war, but the totality of the Great War called for measures that the Party had long rejected. The result was the permanent destruction of ability of the Liberal Party to lead a government. Historian <a href="Robert%20Blake%2C%20Baron%20Blake">Robert Blake</a> explains the dilemma:
Blake further notes that it was the Liberals, not the Conservatives who needed the moral outrage of Belgium to justify going to war, while the Conservatives called for intervention from the start of the crisis on the grounds of "realpolitik" and the balance of power. Lloyd George and Churchill, however, were zealous supporters of the war, and gradually forced the old peace-orientated Liberals out. Asquith was blamed for the poor British performance in first year. Fearful of losing an election, he had no choice but to form a coalition with Conservatives and Labour (on 17 May 1915). This coalition fell apart at the end of 1916, when the Conservatives withdrew their support from Asquith and gave it instead to Lloyd George, who became Prime Minister at the head of a new coalition largely made up of Conservatives. Asquith and his followers moved to the opposition benches in Parliament and the Liberal Party was deeply split once again.

Lloyd George abandoned many Liberal principles in his single-minded crusade to win the war at all costs. That brought him and like-minded Liberals into the new coalition on the ground long occupied by Conservatives. There was no more planning for world peace or liberal treatment of Germany, nor discomfit with aggressive and authoritarian measures of state power. More deadly to the future of the Party, says Wilson, was its repudiation by ideological Liberals, who decided sadly that it no longer represented their principles. Finally the presence of the vigorous new Labour Party on the left gave a new home to voters disenchanted with the Liberal performance.

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201918">1918 general election</a> Lloyd George, hailed as "the Man Who Won the War", led his coalition into a "<a href="khaki%20election">khaki election</a>". Lloyd George and the Conservative leader <a href="Bonar%20Law">Bonar Law</a> wrote a joint letter of support to candidates to indicate they were considered the official Coalition candidates – this <a href="The%20Coalition%20Coupon">"coupon"</a>, as it became known, was issued against many sitting Liberal MPs, often to devastating effect, though not against Asquith himself. , The coalition won a massive victory as the Asquithian Liberals and Labour were decimated. Those remaining Liberal MPs who were opposed to the Coalition Government went into opposition under the parliamentary leadership of <a href="Donald%20Maclean%20%28British%20politician%29">Sir Donald MacLean</a> who also became <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Leader of the Opposition</a>. Asquith, who had appointed MacLean, remained as overall Leader of the Liberal Party even though he lost his seat in 1918. Asquith returned to parliament in 1920 and resumed leadership. Between 1919 and 1923, the anti-Lloyd George Liberals were called Asquithian Liberals or <a href="Independent%20Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%2C%201918%29">Independent Liberals</a>.

Lloyd George was increasingly under the influence of the rejuvenated Conservative party who numerically dominated the coalition. In 1922 the Conservative backbenchers <a href="Carlton%20Club%20meeting">rebelled</a> against the continuation of the coalition, citing in particular Lloyd George's plan for war with Turkey in the <a href="Chanak%20Crisis">Chanak Crisis</a>, and his corrupt sale of honours. He resigned as Prime Minister and the Conservatives named Bonar Law, and after him <a href="Stanley%20Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a>.

At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201922">1922</a> and <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201923">1923 elections</a> the Liberals won barely a third of the vote and only a quarter of the seats in the House of Commons, as many radical voters abandoned the divided Liberals and went over to Labour. In 1922 Labour became the official opposition. A reunion of the two warring factions took place in 1923 when the new Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin committed his party to protective tariffs, causing the Liberals to reunite in support of free trade. The party gained ground in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201923">1923 general election</a> but made most of its gains from Conservatives whilst losing ground to Labour – a sign of the party's direction for many years to come. The party remained the third largest in the House of Commons, but the Conservatives had lost their majority. There was much speculation and fear about the prospect of a Labour government, and comparatively little about a Liberal government, even though it could have plausibly presented an experienced team of ministers compared to Labour's almost complete lack of experience, as well as offering a middle ground that could obtain support from both Conservatives and Labour in crucial Commons divisions. But instead of trying to force the opportunity to form a Liberal government, Asquith decided instead to allow Labour the chance of office, in the belief that they would prove incompetent and this would set the stage for a revival of Liberal fortunes at Labour's expense. It was a fatal error.
Labour was determined to destroy the Liberals and become the sole party of the left. <a href="Ramsay%20MacDonald">Ramsay MacDonald</a> was forced into a <a href="united%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201924">snap election in 1924</a>, and although his government was defeated, he achieved his objective of virtually wiping the Liberals out as many more radical voters now moved to Labour, whilst moderate middle-class Liberal voters concerned about socialism moved to the Conservatives. The Liberals were reduced to a mere forty seats in Parliament, only seven of which had been won against candidates from both parties; and none of these formed a coherent area of Liberal survival. The party seemed finished, and during this period some Liberals, such as Churchill, went over to the Conservatives, while others went over to Labour. (Several Labour ministers of later generations, such as <a href="Michael%20Foot">Michael Foot</a> and <a href="Tony%20Benn">Tony Benn</a>, were the sons of Liberal MPs.)

Asquith died in 1928 and the enigmatic figure of Lloyd George returned to the leadership and began a drive to produce coherent policies on many key issues of the day. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201929">1929 general election</a> he made a final bid to return the Liberals to the political mainstream, with an ambitious programme of state stimulation of the economy called "We Can Conquer Unemployment!", largely written for him by the Liberal economist <a href="John%20Maynard%20Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a>. The Liberals gained ground, but once again it was at the Conservatives' expense whilst also losing seats to Labour. Indeed, the urban areas of the country suffering heavily from unemployment, which might have been expected to respond the most to the radical economic policies of the Liberals, instead gave the party its worst results. By contrast most of the party's seats were won either due to the absence of a candidate from one of the other parties or in rural areas on the "<a href="Celtic%20fringe">Celtic fringe</a>", where local evidence suggests that economic ideas were at best peripheral to the electorate's concerns. The Liberals now found themselves with 59 members, holding the balance of power in a Parliament where Labour was the largest party but lacked an overall majority. Lloyd George offered a degree of support to the Labour government in the hope of winning concessions, including a degree of electoral reform to introduce the <a href="Instant-runoff%20voting">alternative vote</a>, but this support was to prove bitterly divisive as the Liberals increasingly divided between those seeking to gain what Liberal goals they could achieve, those who preferred a Conservative government to a Labour one and vice versa.

The last majority Liberal Government in Britain was elected in 1906.
The years preceding the First World War were marked by worker strikes and civil unrest and saw many violent confrontations between civilians and the police and armed forces. Other issues of the period included <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a> and the <a href="Irish%20Home%20Rule">Irish Home Rule</a> movement.
After the carnage of 1914–1918, the democratic reforms of the <a href="Representation%20of%20the%20People%20Act%201918">Representation of the People Act 1918</a> instantly tripled the number of people entitled to vote in Britain from seven to twenty-one million. The Labour Party benefited most from this huge change in the electorate, forming its <a href="First%20Labour%20Government%20%28UK%29">first minority government in 1924</a>.

In 1931 MacDonald's government fell apart in response to the <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Great Depression</a>, and the Liberals agreed to join his <a href="National%20Government%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Government</a>, dominated by the Conservatives. Lloyd George himself was ill and did not actually join. Soon, however, the Liberals faced another divisive crisis when a National Government was proposed to fight the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201931">1931 general election</a> with a mandate for tariffs. From the outside, Lloyd George called for the party to abandon the government completely in defence of free trade, but <a href="Independent%20Liberals%20%28UK%2C%201931%29">only a few MPs and candidates followed</a>. Another group under <a href="John%20Simon%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Simon">Sir John Simon</a> then emerged, who were prepared to continue their support for the government and take the Liberal places in the Cabinet if there were resignations. The third group under <a href="Herbert%20Samuel%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Samuel">Sir Herbert Samuel</a> pressed for the parties in government to fight the election on separate platforms. In doing so the bulk of Liberals remained supporting the government, but two distinct Liberal groups had emerged within this bulk – the <a href="National%20Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%2C%201931%29">Liberal Nationals</a> (officially the "National Liberals" after 1947) led by Simon, also known as "Simonites", and the "Samuelites" or "official Liberals", led by Samuel who remained as the official party. Both groups secured about 34 MPs but proceeded to diverge even further after the election, with the Liberal Nationals remaining supporters of the government throughout its life. There were to be a succession of discussions about them rejoining the Liberals, but these usually foundered on the issues of free trade and continued support for the National Government. The one significant reunification came in 1946 when the Liberal and Liberal National party organisations in London merged.

The official Liberals found themselves a tiny minority within a government committed to <a href="protectionism">protectionism</a>. Slowly they found this issue to be one they could not support. In early 1932 it was agreed to suspend the principle of <a href="Cabinet%20collective%20responsibility">collective responsibility</a> to allow the Liberals to oppose the introduction of tariffs. Later in 1932 the Liberals resigned their ministerial posts over the introduction of the <a href="Ottawa%20Conference">Ottawa Agreement</a> on <a href="Imperial%20Preference">Imperial Preference</a>. However, they remained sitting on the government benches supporting it in Parliament, though in the country local Liberal activists bitterly opposed the government. Finally in late 1933 the Liberals crossed the floor of the House of Commons and went into complete opposition. By this point their number of MPs was severely depleted. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201935">1935 general election</a>, just 17 Liberal MPs were elected, along with Lloyd George and three followers as "<a href="Independent%20Liberals%20%28UK%2C%201931%29">independent Liberals</a>". Immediately after the election the two groups reunited, though Lloyd George declined to play much of a formal role in his old party. Over the next ten years there would be further defections as MPs deserted to either the Liberal Nationals or Labour. Yet there were a few recruits, such as <a href="Clement%20Davies">Clement Davies</a>, who had deserted to the National Liberals in 1931 but now returned to the party during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a> and who would lead it after the war.

Samuel had lost his seat in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201935">1935 election</a> and the leadership of the party fell to <a href="Archibald%20Sinclair%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Thurso">Sir Archibald Sinclair</a>. With many traditional domestic Liberal policies now regarded as irrelevant, he focused the party on opposition to both the rise of Fascism in Europe and the <a href="appeasement">appeasement</a> foreign policy of the British government, arguing that intervention was needed, in contrast to the Labour calls for pacifism. Despite the party's weaknesses, Sinclair gained a high profile as he sought to recall the <a href="Midlothian%20Campaign">Midlothian Campaign</a> and once more revitalise the Liberals as the party of a strong foreign policy.

In 1940 they joined Churchill's wartime coalition government, with Sinclair serving as <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Air">Secretary of State for Air</a>, the last British Liberal to hold Cabinet rank office for seventy years. However, it was a sign of the party's lack of importance that they were not included in the <a href="War%20Cabinet">War Cabinet</a>; some leading party members founded <a href="Radical%20Action">Radical Action</a>, a group which called for liberal candidates to break the <a href="war-time%20electoral%20pact">war-time electoral pact</a>. At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201945">1945 general election</a>, Sinclair and many of his colleagues lost their seats to both Conservatives and Labour, and the party returned just 12 MPs to Westminster. But this was just the beginning of the decline. In <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201950">1950</a>, the general election saw the Liberals return just nine MPs. Another <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201951">general election was called in 1951</a>, and the Liberals were left with just six MPs; all but one of them were aided by the fact that the Conservatives refrained from fielding candidates in those constituencies.

In 1957 this total fell to five when one of the Liberal MPs died and the subsequent by-election was lost to the Labour Party, which selected the former Liberal Deputy Leader <a href="Megan%20Lloyd%20George">Megan Lloyd George</a> as its own candidate. The Liberal Party seemed close to extinction. During this low period, it was often joked that Liberal MPs could hold meetings in the back of one taxi.

Through the 1950s and into the 1960s the Liberals survived only because a handful of constituencies in rural <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="Wales">Wales</a> clung to their Liberal traditions, whilst in two English towns, <a href="Bolton">Bolton</a> and <a href="Huddersfield">Huddersfield</a>, local Liberals and Conservatives agreed to each contest only one of the town's two seats. <a href="Jo%20Grimond">Jo Grimond</a>, for example, who became Liberal leader in 1956, was MP for the remote <a href="Orkney%20and%20Shetland%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Orkney and Shetland</a> islands. Under his leadership a Liberal revival began, marked by the <a href="Orpington%20by-election%2C%201962">Orpington by-election</a> of March 1962 which was won by <a href="Eric%20Reginald%20Lubbock%2C%204th%20Baron%20Avebury">Eric Lubbock</a>. There, the Liberals won a seat in the London suburbs for the first time since 1935.

The Liberals became the first of the major British political parties to advocate British membership of the <a href="European%20Economic%20Community">European Economic Community</a>. Grimond also sought an intellectual revival of the party, seeking to position it as a non-socialist radical alternative to the Conservative government of the day. In particular he canvassed the support of the young post-war university students and recent graduates, appealing to younger voters in a way that many of his recent predecessors had not, and asserting a new strand of Liberalism for the post-war world.

The new middle-class suburban generation began to find the Liberals' policies attractive again. Under Grimond (who retired in 1967) and his successor, <a href="Jeremy%20Thorpe">Jeremy Thorpe</a>, the Liberals regained the status of a serious third force in British politics, polling up to 20% of the vote but unable to break the duopoly of Labour and Conservative and win more than fourteen seats in the Commons. An additional problem was competition in the Liberal heartlands in Scotland and Wales from the <a href="Scottish%20National%20Party">Scottish National Party</a> and <a href="Plaid%20Cymru">Plaid Cymru</a> who both grew as electoral forces from the 1960s onwards. Although <a href="Emlyn%20Hooson">Emlyn Hooson</a> held on to the seat of Montgomeryshire, upon <a href="Clement%20Davies">Clement Davies</a> death in 1962, the party lost five Welsh seats between 1950 and 1966. In September 1966 the <a href="Welsh%20Liberal%20Party">Welsh Liberal Party</a> formed their own state party, moving the Liberal Party into a fully federal structure.

In local elections <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> remained a Liberal stronghold, with the party taking the plurality of seats on the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20local%20elections%2C%201973">elections</a> to the new Liverpool Metropolitan Borough Council in 1973. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%20February%201974">February 1974 general election</a> the Conservative government of <a href="Edward%20Heath">Edward Heath</a> won a plurality of votes cast, but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats due to the <a href="Ulster%20Unionist%20Party">Ulster Unionist</a> MPs refusing to support the Conservatives after the Northern Ireland <a href="Sunningdale%20Agreement">Sunningdale Agreement</a>. The Liberals now held the balance of power in the Commons. Conservatives offered Thorpe the <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> if he would join a coalition government with Heath. Thorpe was personally in favour of it, but the party insisted on a clear government commitment to introducing <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a> and a change of Prime Minister. The former was unacceptable to Heath's Cabinet and the latter to Heath personally, so the talks collapsed. Instead a minority Labour government was formed under <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> but with no formal support from Thorpe. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%20October%201974">October 1974 general election</a> the Liberals slipped back slightly and the Labour government won a wafer-thin majority.

Thorpe was subsequently forced to resign after allegations that he attempted to have his homosexual lover murdered by a hitman. The party's new leader, <a href="David%20Steel">David Steel</a>, negotiated the <a href="Lib-Lab%20pact">Lib-Lab pact</a> with Wilson's successor as Prime Minister, <a href="James%20Callaghan">James Callaghan</a>. According to this pact, the Liberals would support the government in crucial votes in exchange for some influence over policy. The agreement lasted from 1977 to 1978, but proved mostly fruitless, for two reasons: the Liberals' key demand of <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a> was rejected by most Labour MPs, whilst the contacts between Liberal spokespersons and Labour ministers often proved detrimental, such as between finance spokesperson <a href="John%20Pardoe">John Pardoe</a> and <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> <a href="Denis%20Healey">Denis Healey</a>, who were mutually antagonistic.

The Conservative Party under the leadership of <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> won the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201979">1979 general election</a>, placing the Labour Party back in opposition, which served to push the Liberals back into the margins.

In 1981, defectors from a moderate faction of the Labour Party, led by former Cabinet ministers <a href="Roy%20Jenkins">Roy Jenkins</a>, <a href="David%20Owen">David Owen</a> and <a href="Shirley%20Williams">Shirley Williams</a>, founded the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20%28UK%29">Social Democratic Party</a> (SDP). The new party and the Liberals quickly formed the SDP-Liberal Alliance, which for a while polled as high as 50% in the opinion polls and appeared capable of winning the next general election. Indeed, Steel was so confident of an Alliance victory that he told the 1981 Liberal conference, "Go back to your constituencies, and prepare for government!"

However, the Alliance was overtaken in the polls by the Tories in the aftermath of the <a href="Falkland%20Islands%20War">Falkland Islands War</a> and at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201983">1983 general election</a> the Conservatives were re-elected by a landslide, with Labour once again forming the opposition. While the SDP-Liberal Alliance came close to Labour in terms of votes (a share of more than 25%), it only had 23 MPs compared to Labour's 209.

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201987">1987 general election</a>, the Alliance's share of the votes fell slightly and it now had 22 MPs. In the election's aftermath Steel proposed a merger of the two parties. Most SDP members voted in favour of the merger, but SDP leader <a href="David%20Owen">David Owen</a> objected and continued to lead a "rump" SDP.

In March 1988 the Liberal Party and Social Democratic Party merged to create the Social and Liberal Democrats, renamed the <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrats</a> in October 1989. Over two-thirds of the members, and all the serving MPs, of the Liberal Party joined this party, led first jointly by Steel and the SDP leader <a href="Robert%20Maclennan%2C%20Baron%20Maclennan%20of%20Rogart">Robert Maclennan</a>.

A group of Liberal opponents of the merger with the Social Democrats, including <a href="Michael%20Meadowcroft">Michael Meadowcroft</a> (the former Liberal MP for Leeds West) and Paul Wiggin (who served on <a href="Local%20government%20in%20Peterborough">Peterborough City Council</a> as a Liberal), continued with a new party organisation under the old name of "the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%2C%201989%29">Liberal Party</a>". Meadowcroft joined the Liberal Democrats in 2007.

During the 19th century, the Liberal Party was broadly in favour of what would today be called <a href="classical%20liberalism">classical liberalism</a>: supporting "<a href="laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a>" economic policies such as <a href="free%20trade">free trade</a> and minimal government interference in the economy (this doctrine was usually termed '<a href="Gladstonian%20Liberalism">Gladstonian Liberalism</a>' after the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> Liberal Prime Minister <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a>). The Liberal Party favoured social reform, personal liberty, reducing the powers of <a href="the%20Crown">the Crown</a> and the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> (many of them were <a href="Nonconformism">Nonconformists</a>) and an extension of the electoral <a href="Suffrage">franchise</a>. Sir <a href="William%20Vernon%20Harcourt%20%28politician%29">William Harcourt</a>, a prominent Liberal politician in the Victorian era, said this about <a href="liberalism">liberalism</a> in 1872:
If there be any party which is more pledged than another to resist a policy of restrictive legislation, having for its object social coercion, that party is the Liberal party. (Cheers.) But liberty does not consist in making others do what you think right, (Hear, hear.) The difference between a free Government and a Government which is not free is principally this—that a Government which is not free interferes with everything it can, and a free Government interferes with nothing except what it must. A despotic Government tries to make everybody do what it wishes; a Liberal Government tries, as far as the safety of society will permit, to allow everybody to do as he wishes. It has been the tradition of the Liberal party consistently to maintain the doctrine of individual liberty. It is because they have done so that England is the place where people can do more what they please than in any other country in the world...It is this practice of allowing one set of people to dictate to another set of people what they shall do, what they shall think, what they shall drink, when they shall go to bed, what they shall buy, and where they shall buy it, what wages they shall get and how they shall spend them, against which the Liberal party have always protested.

The political terms of "modern", "progressive" or "new" Liberalism began to appear in the mid to late 1880s and became increasingly common to denote the tendency in the Liberal Party to favour an increased role for the state as more important than the classical liberal stress on self-help and freedom of choice.

By the early 20th century the Liberals stance began to shift towards "New Liberalism", what would today be called <a href="social%20liberalism">social liberalism</a>: a belief in personal liberty with a support for government intervention to provide minimum levels of <a href="welfare">welfare</a>. This shift was best exemplified by the Liberal government of <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a> and his Chancellor <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>, whose <a href="Liberal%20reforms">Liberal reforms</a> in the early 1900s created a basic <a href="welfare%20state">welfare state</a>.

David Lloyd George adopted a programme at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201929">1929 general election</a> entitled "We Can Conquer Unemployment!", although by this stage the Liberals had declined to third-party status. The Liberals now (as expressed in the Liberal Yellow Book) regarded opposition to state intervention as being a characteristic of <a href="right-wing%20politics">right-wing</a> extremists.

After nearly becoming extinct in the 1940s and 50s, the Liberal Party revived its fortunes somewhat under the leadership of <a href="Jo%20Grimond">Jo Grimond</a> in the 1960s, by positioning itself as a <a href="radical%20center%20%28politics%29">radical centrist</a> non-<a href="socialism">socialist</a> alternative to the Conservative and Labour Party governments of the time.

Since 1660, <a href="Nonconformist">Nonconformist</a> Protestants have played a major role in English politics. Relatively few MPs were dissenters. However the Dissenters were a major voting bloc in many areas, such as the East Midlands. They were very well organised and highly motivated and largely won over the Whigs and Liberals to their cause. Down to the 1830s, Dissenters demanded removal of <a href="political%20and%20civil%20disabilities">political and civil disabilities</a> that applied to them (especially those in the Test and Corporation Acts). The Anglican establishment strongly resisted until 1828. Numerous reforms of voting rights, especially that of 1832, increased the political power of Dissenters. They demanded an end to compulsory church rates, in which local taxes went only to Anglican churches. They finally achieve the end of religious tests for university degrees in 1905. Gladstone brought the majority of dissenters around to support for Home Rule for Ireland, putting the dissenting Protestants in league with the Irish Roman Catholics in an otherwise unlikely alliance. The dissenters gave significant support to moralistic issues, such as temperance and sabbath enforcement. The <a href="nonconformist%20conscience">nonconformist conscience</a>, as it was called, was repeatedly called upon by Gladstone for support for his moralistic foreign policy. In election after election, Protestant ministers rallied their congregations to the Liberal ticket. In Scotland, the Presbyterians played a similar role to the Nonconformist Methodists, Baptists and other groups in England and Wales.

By the 1820s the different Nonconformists, including <a href="Wesleyan%20Methodist%20Church%20%28Great%20Britain%29">Wesleyan Methodists</a>, Baptists, Congregationalists, and Unitarians, had formed the Committee of Dissenting Deputies and agitated for repeal of the highly restrictive <a href="Test%20and%20Corporation%20Acts">Test and Corporation Acts</a>. These Acts excluded Nonconformists from holding civil or military office or attending Oxford or Cambridge, compelling them to set up their own <a href="Dissenting%20Academies">Dissenting Academies</a> privately.

The <a href="Tories%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Tories</a> tended to be in favour of these Acts and so the Nonconformist cause was linked closely to the <a href="Whigs%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whigs</a>, who advocated civil and religious liberty. After the Test and Corporation Acts were <a href="Sacramental%20Test%20Act%201828">repealed in 1828</a>, all the Nonconformists elected to Parliament were Liberals.

Nonconformists were angered by the <a href="Education%20Act%201902">Education Act 1902</a>, which integrated Church of England denominational schools into the state system and provided for their support from taxes. <a href="John%20Clifford%20%28minister%29">John Clifford</a> formed the National Passive Resistance Committee and by 1906 over 170 Nonconformists had gone to prison for refusing to pay school taxes. They included 60 <a href="Primitive%20Methodists">Primitive Methodists</a>, 48 Baptists, 40 Congregationalists, and 15 Wesleyan Methodists.

The political strength of Dissent faded sharply after 1920 with the secularisation of British society in the 20th century. The rise of the Labour Party reduced the Liberal Party strongholds into the nonconformist and remote "Celtic Fringe," where the party survived by an emphasis on localism and historic religious identity, thereby neutralising much of the class pressure on behalf of the Labour movement. Meanwhile, the Anglican church was a bastion of strength for the Conservative party. On the Irish issue, the Anglicans strongly supported unionism. Increasingly after 1850, the Roman Catholic element in England and Scotland was composed of recent immigrants from Ireland. They voted largely for the Irish Parliamentary Party, until its collapse in 1918.

Bank of England

The Bank of England, formally the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, is the <a href="central%20bank">central bank</a> of the United Kingdom and the model on which most modern central banks have been based. Established in 1694, it is the second oldest central bank in operation today, after the <a href="Swedish%20National%20Bank">Sveriges Riksbank</a>. The Bank of England is the <a href="List%20of%20oldest%20banks%20in%20continuous%20operation">world's 8th oldest bank</a>. It was established to act as the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">English Government</a>'s banker and is still one of the bankers for the <a href="Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Government of the United Kingdom</a>. The Bank was privately owned by stockholders from its foundation in 1694 until it was nationalised in 1946.

In 1998, it became an independent public organisation, wholly owned by the <a href="Treasury%20Solicitor">Treasury Solicitor</a> on behalf of the government, with independence in setting monetary policy.

The Bank is one of eight banks authorised to issue <a href="Banknotes%20of%20the%20pound%20sterling">banknotes in the United Kingdom</a>, but it has a monopoly on the issue of banknotes in <a href="England%20and%20Wales">England and Wales</a> and regulates the issue of banknotes by commercial banks in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>.

The Bank's <a href="Monetary%20Policy%20Committee">Monetary Policy Committee</a> has a devolved responsibility for managing <a href="monetary%20policy">monetary policy</a>. The Treasury has reserve powers to give orders to the committee "if they are required in the public interest and by extreme economic circumstances", but such orders must be endorsed by Parliament within 28 days. The Bank's <a href="Financial%20Policy%20Committee">Financial Policy Committee</a> held its first meeting in June 2011 as a macro prudential regulator to oversee regulation of the UK's financial sector.

The Bank's headquarters have been in London's main financial district, the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>, on <a href="Threadneedle%20Street">Threadneedle Street</a>, since 1734. It is sometimes known by the metonym "The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street" or "The Old Lady", a name taken from the legend of <a href="Sarah%20Whitehead">Sarah Whitehead</a>, whose ghost is said to haunt the Bank's garden. The busy road junction outside is known as <a href="Bank%20junction">Bank junction</a>.

As a regulator and central bank, the Bank of England has not offered consumer banking services for many years, but it still does manage some public-facing services such as exchanging superseded bank notes. Until 2016, the bank provided personal banking services as a popular privilege for employees.

<a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a>'s crushing defeat by <a href="Kingdom%20of%20France">France</a>, the dominant naval power, in naval engagements culminating in the 1690 <a href="Battle%20of%20Beachy%20Head%20%281690%29">Battle of Beachy Head</a>, became the catalyst for England's rebuilding itself as a global power. England had no choice but to build a powerful navy. No public funds were available, and the credit of <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a>'s government was so low in London that it was impossible for it to borrow the £1,200,000 (at 8% p.a.) that the government wanted.

To induce subscription to the loan, the subscribers were to be <a href="Incorporation%20%28business%29">incorporated</a> by the name of the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. The Bank was given exclusive possession of the government's balances, and was the only limited-liability corporation allowed to issue bank notes. The lenders would give the government cash (bullion) and issue notes against the government bonds, which can be lent again. The £1.2m was raised in 12 days; half of this was used to rebuild the navy.

As a side effect, the huge industrial effort needed, including establishing <a href="ironworks">ironworks</a> to make more nails and advances in agriculture feeding the quadrupled strength of the navy, started to transform the economy. This helped the new <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a> – <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">England and Scotland were formally united in 1707</a> – to become powerful. The power of the navy made Britain the dominant world power in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

The establishment of the bank was devised by <a href="Charles%20Montagu%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Halifax">Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax</a>, in 1694. The plan of 1691, which had been proposed by <a href="William%20Paterson%20%28banker%29">William Paterson</a> three years before, had not then been acted upon. (It is worth noting though, that 28 years earlier, in 1636, Financier to the king <a href="Philip%20Burlamachi">Philip Burlamachi</a> had proposed exactly the same idea in a letter addressed to <a href="Sir%20Francis%20Windebank">Sir Francis Windebank</a>.) He proposed a loan of £1.2m to the government; in return the subscribers would be incorporated as The Governor and Company of the Bank of England with long-term banking privileges including the issue of notes. The <a href="Royal%20Charter">Royal Charter</a> was granted on 27 July through the passage of the <a href="Tonnage%20Act%201694">Tonnage Act 1694</a>. Public finances were in such dire condition at the time that the terms of the loan were that it was to be serviced at a rate of 8% per annum, and there was also a service charge of £4,000 per annum for the management of the loan. The first governor was Sir <a href="John%20Houblon">John Houblon</a>, who is depicted in the <a href="Bank%20of%20England%20%C2%A350%20note">£50 note</a> issued in 1994. The charter was renewed in 1742, 1764, and 1781.

The Bank's original home was in Walbrook, a street in the City of London, where during reconstruction in 1954 archaeologists found the remains of a Roman <a href="Temple%20of%20Mithras%2C%20London">temple of Mithras</a> (Mithras is – rather fittingly – said to have been worshipped as, amongst other things, the God of Contracts); the Mithraeum ruins are perhaps the most famous of all 20th-century Roman discoveries in the City of London and can be viewed by the public.

The Bank moved to its current location in Threadneedle Street in 1734, and thereafter slowly acquired neighbouring land to create the edifice seen today. Sir <a href="Herbert%20Baker">Herbert Baker</a>'s rebuilding of the Bank, demolishing most of Sir <a href="John%20Soane">John Soane</a>'s earlier building, was described by architectural historian <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> as "the greatest architectural crime, in the City of London, of the twentieth century".

When the idea and reality of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20national%20debt">National Debt</a> came about during the 18th century, this was also managed by the Bank. During the <a href="American%20war%20of%20independence">American war of independence</a>, business for the Bank was so good that <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> remained a shareholder throughout the period. By the <a href="charter">charter</a> renewal in 1781 it was also the bankers' bank – keeping enough gold to pay its notes on demand until 26 February 1797 when <a href="French%20Revolution">war</a> had so diminished <a href="gold%20reserves">gold reserves</a> that - following an invasion scare caused by the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fishguard">Battle of Fishguard</a> days earlier - the government prohibited the Bank from paying out in gold by the passing of the <a href="Bank%20Restriction%20Act%201797">Bank Restriction Act 1797</a>. This prohibition lasted until 1821.

The 1844 <a href="Bank%20Charter%20Act">Bank Charter Act</a> tied the issue of notes to the gold reserves and gave the Bank sole rights with regard to the issue of banknotes. Private banks that had previously had that right retained it, provided that their headquarters were outside London and that they deposited security against the notes that they issued. A few English banks continued to issue their own notes until the last of them was taken over in the 1930s. Scottish and Northern Irish private banks still have that right.

The bank acted as <a href="lender%20of%20last%20resort">lender of last resort</a> for the first time in the <a href="panic%20of%201866">panic of 1866</a>.

The last private bank in England to issue its own notes was Thomas Fox's <a href="Fox%2C%20Fowler%20and%20Company">Fox, Fowler and Company</a> bank in <a href="Wellington%2C%20Somerset">Wellington</a>, which rapidly expanded, until it merged with Lloyds Bank in 1927. They were legal tender until 1964. There are nine notes left in circulation; one is housed at <a href="Tone%20Dale%20House">Tone Dale House</a> Wellington.

Britain remained on the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a> until 1931 when the gold and foreign exchange reserves were transferred to the <a href="HM%20Treasury">Treasury</a>, but they continued to be managed by the Bank.

During the governorship of <a href="Montagu%20Norman">Montagu Norman</a>, from 1920–44, the Bank made deliberate efforts to move away from <a href="commercial%20bank">commercial bank</a>ing and become a central bank. In 1946, shortly after the end of Norman's tenure, <a href="Bank%20of%20England%20Act%201946">the bank was nationalised</a> by the Labour government.

After 1945 the Bank pursued the multiple goals of Keynesian economics, especially "easy money" and low interest rates to support aggregate demand. It tried to keep a fixed exchange rate, and attempted to deal with inflation and sterling weakness by credit and exchange controls.

In 1977, the Bank set up a wholly owned subsidiary called <a href="Bank%20of%20England%20Nominees">Bank of England Nominees Limited</a> (BOEN), a private limited company, with two of its hundred £1 shares issued. According to its Memorandum & Articles of Association, its objectives are: "To act as Nominee or agent or attorney either solely or jointly with others, for any person or persons, partnership, company, corporation, government, state, organisation, sovereign, province, authority, or public body, or any group or association of them..." Bank of England Nominees Limited was granted an exemption by <a href="Edmund%20Dell">Edmund Dell</a>, Secretary of State for Trade, from the disclosure requirements under Section 27(9) of the Companies Act 1976, because "it was considered undesirable that the disclosure requirements should apply to certain categories of shareholders." The Bank of England is also protected by its <a href="Royal%20Charter">Royal Charter</a> status, and the <a href="Official%20Secrets%20Act">Official Secrets Act</a>. BOEN is a vehicle for governments and heads of state to invest in UK companies (subject to approval from the Secretary of State), providing they undertake "not to influence the affairs of the company". BOEN is no longer exempt from company law disclosure requirements. Although a <a href="dormant%20company">dormant company</a>, dormancy does not preclude a company actively operating as a nominee shareholder. BOEN has two shareholders: the Bank of England, and the Secretary of the Bank of England.

In 1981 the <a href="reserve%20requirement">reserve requirement</a> for banks to hold a minimum fixed proportion of their deposits as reserves at the Bank of England was abolished: see <a href="reserve%20requirement%23United%20Kingdom">reserve requirement</a> for more details. The contemporary transition from Keynesian economics to Chicago economics was analysed by <a href="Nicholas%20Kaldor">Kaldor</a> in "The Scourge of Monetarism"

On 6 May 1997, following the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201997">1997 general election</a> which brought a Labour government to power for the first time since 1979, it was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a>, that the Bank would be granted operational independence over monetary policy. Under the terms of the Bank of England Act 1998 (which came into force on 1 June 1998), the Bank's <a href="Monetary%20Policy%20Committee">Monetary Policy Committee</a> was given sole responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government's <a href="Retail%20Prices%20Index%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Retail Prices Index</a> (RPI) inflation target of 2.5%. The target has changed to 2% since the <a href="Consumer%20Price%20Index%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Consumer Price Index</a> (CPI) replaced the Retail Prices Index as the Treasury's inflation index. If inflation overshoots or undershoots the target by more than 1%, the Governor has to write a letter to the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> explaining why, and how he will remedy the situation.

The success of <a href="inflation%20target">inflation target</a>ing in the United Kingdom has been attributed to the Bank's focus on transparency. The Bank of England has been a leader in producing innovative ways of communicating information to the public, especially through its Inflation Report, which have been emulated by many other central banks.

Independent central banks that adopt an inflation target are known as <a href="Milton%20Friedman">Friedmanite</a> central banks. Inflation targets combined with central bank independence have been characterised as a "starve the beast" strategy creating a lack of money in the public sector. This change in Labour's politics was described by <a href="Robert%20Skidelsky">Sidelsky</a> in "The Return of the Master" as a mistake and as an adoption of the <a href="Rational%20expectations">Rational Expectations Hypothesis</a> as promulgated by <a href="Alan%20Walters">Walters</a>

The handing over of monetary policy to the Bank had been a key plank of the <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrats</a>' economic policy since the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201992">1992 general election</a>. Conservative MP <a href="Nicholas%20Budgen">Nicholas Budgen</a> had also proposed this as a <a href="private%20member%27s%20bill">private member's bill</a> in 1996, but the bill failed as it had the support of neither the government nor the opposition.

<a href="Mark%20Carney">Mark Carney</a> assumed the post of <a href="Governor%20of%20the%20Bank%20of%20England">Governor of the Bank of England</a> on 1 July 2013. He succeeded <a href="Mervyn%20King%2C%20Baron%20King%20of%20Lothbury">Mervyn King</a>, who took over on 30 June 2003. Carney, a Canadian, will serve an initial five-year term rather than the typical eight, and will seek UK citizenship. He is the first non-British citizen to hold the post. As of January 2014, the Bank also has four <a href="Deputy%20Governor%20of%20the%20Bank%20of%20England">Deputy Governors</a>.

There are two main areas which are tackled by the Bank to ensure it carries out these functions efficiently:

Note: It is important to note that "monetary" and "financial" are synonyms.

Stable prices and confidence in the currency are the two main criteria for monetary stability. Stable prices are maintained by seeking to ensure that price increases meet the Government's inflation target. The Bank aims to meet this target by adjusting the base <a href="interest%20rate">interest rate</a>, which is decided by the <a href="Monetary%20Policy%20Committee">Monetary Policy Committee</a>, and through its communications strategy, such as publishing <a href="yield%20curve">yield curve</a>s.

The Bank works together with other institutions to secure both monetary and financial stability, including:
The 1997 <a href="Memorandum%20of%20Understanding">Memorandum of Understanding</a> describes the terms under which the Bank, the Treasury and the FSA work toward the common aim of increased financial stability. In 2010 the incoming Chancellor announced his intention to merge the FSA back into the Bank. As of 2012, the current director for financial stability is <a href="Andy%20Haldane">Andy Haldane</a>.

The Bank acts as the government's banker, and it maintains the government's <a href="Consolidated%20Fund">Consolidated Fund</a> account. It also manages the country's <a href="foreign%20exchange%20market">foreign exchange</a> and <a href="gold%20reserves">gold reserves</a>. The Bank also acts as the bankers' bank, especially in its capacity as a lender of last resort.

The Bank has a monopoly on the issue of <a href="banknote">banknote</a>s in England and Wales. Scottish and Northern Irish banks retain the right to issue their own banknotes, but they must be backed one for one with deposits at the Bank, excepting a few million pounds representing the value of notes they had in circulation in 1845. The Bank decided to sell its banknote printing operations to <a href="De%20La%20Rue">De La Rue</a> in December 2002, under the advice of Close Brothers Corporate Finance Ltd.

Since 1998, the <a href="Monetary%20Policy%20Committee">Monetary Policy Committee</a> (MPC) has had the responsibility for setting the official interest rate. However, with the decision to grant the Bank operational independence, responsibility for government debt management was transferred in 1998 to the new <a href="Debt%20Management%20Office">Debt Management Office</a>, which also took over government cash management in 2000. <a href="Computershare">Computershare</a> took over as the registrar for UK Government bonds (<a href="gilt-edged%20security">gilt-edged securities</a> or "gilts") from the Bank at the end of 2004.

The Bank used to be responsible for the regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries. This responsibility was transferred to the Financial Services Authority in June 1998, but after the financial crises in 2008 new banking legislation transferred the responsibility for regulation and supervision of the banking and insurance industries back to the Bank.

In 2011 the interim <a href="Financial%20Policy%20Committee">Financial Policy Committee</a> (FPC) was created as a mirror committee to the MPC to spearhead the Bank's new mandate on financial stability. The FPC is responsible for macro prudential regulation of all UK banks and insurance companies.

To help maintain economic stability, the Bank attempts to broaden understanding of its role, both through regular speeches and publications by senior Bank figures, a semiannual Financial Stability Report, and through a wider education strategy aimed at the general public. It maintains <a href="Bank%20of%20England%20Museum">a free museum</a> and runs the <a href="Target%20Two%20Point%20Zero">Target Two Point Zero</a> competition for A-level students.

The Bank has operated, since January 2009, an Asset Purchase Facility (APF) to buy "high-quality assets financed by the issue of Treasury bills and the <a href="UK%20Debt%20Management%20Office">DMO</a>'s cash management operations" and thereby improve liquidity in the credit markets. It has, since March 2009, also provided the mechanism by which the Bank's policy of <a href="quantitative%20easing">quantitative easing</a> (QE) is achieved, under the auspices of the MPC. Along with the managing the £200 billion of QE funds, the APF continues to operate its corporate facilities. Both are undertaken by a subsidiary company of the Bank of England, the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund Limited (BEAPFF).

The Bank has issued banknotes since 1694. Notes were originally hand-written; although they were partially printed from 1725 onwards, cashiers still had to sign each note and make them payable to someone. Notes were fully printed from 1855. Until 1928 all notes were "White Notes", printed in black and with a blank reverse. In the 18th and 19th centuries White Notes were issued in £1 and £2 denominations. During the 20th century White Notes were issued in denominations between £5 and £1000.

Until the mid-19th century, commercial banks were allowed to issue their own banknotes, and notes issued by provincial banking companies were commonly in circulation. The <a href="Bank%20Charter%20Act%201844">Bank Charter Act 1844</a> began the process of restricting note issue to the Bank; new banks were prohibited from issuing their own banknotes and existing note-issuing banks were not permitted to expand their issue. As provincial banking companies merged to form larger banks, they lost their right to issue notes, and the English private banknote eventually disappeared, leaving the Bank with a monopoly of note issue in England and Wales. The last private bank to issue its own banknotes in England and Wales was <a href="Fox%2C%20Fowler%20and%20Company">Fox, Fowler and Company</a> in 1921. However, the limitations of the 1844 Act only affected banks in England and Wales, and today three commercial banks in Scotland and four in Northern Ireland continue to issue their own <a href="Banknotes%20of%20the%20pound%20sterling">banknotes</a>, regulated by the Bank.

At the start of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, the <a href="Currency%20and%20Bank%20Notes%20Act%201914">Currency and Bank Notes Act 1914</a> was passed, which granted temporary powers to <a href="HM%20Treasury">HM Treasury</a> for issuing banknotes to the values of £1 and 10/- (ten shillings). Treasury notes had full legal tender status and were not convertible into gold through the Bank; they replaced the gold coin in circulation to prevent a run on sterling and to enable raw material purchases for armament production. These notes featured an image of <a href="George%20V">King George V</a> (Bank of England notes did not begin to display an image of the monarch until 1960). The wording on each note was:

Treasury notes were issued until 1928, when the <a href="Currency%20and%20Bank%20Notes%20Act%201928">Currency and Bank Notes Act 1928</a> returned note-issuing powers to the banks. The Bank of England issued notes for ten <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s and one pound for the first time on 22 November 1928.

During the Second World War the German <a href="Operation%20Bernhard">Operation Bernhard</a> attempted to counterfeit denominations between £5 and £50, producing 500,000 notes each month in 1943. The original plan was to parachute the money into the UK in an attempt to destabilise the British economy, but it was found more useful to use the notes to pay German agents operating throughout Europe. Although most fell into <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> hands at the end of the war, forgeries frequently appeared for years afterwards, which led banknote denominations above £5 to be removed from circulation.

In 2006, over £53 million in banknotes belonging to the Bank was <a href="Securitas%20depot%20robbery">stolen from a depot</a> in <a href="Tonbridge%2C%20Kent">Tonbridge, Kent</a>.

Modern banknotes are printed by contract with <a href="De%20La%20Rue">De La Rue</a> Currency in <a href="Loughton%2C%20Essex">Loughton, Essex</a>.

The Bank is custodian to the official gold reserves of the United Kingdom and around 30 other countries. The vault, beneath the City of London, covers a floor space greater than that of the third-tallest building in the City, <a href="Tower%2042">Tower 42</a>, and needs keys that are long to open. As of April 2016, the Bank held around 400,000 bars, which is equivalent to 5,134 tonnes of gold. These gold deposits were estimated in July 2017 to have a current market value of £142,000,000,000. These estimates suggest the vault could hold as much as 3% of the gold mined throughout human history.

Following is a list of the Governors of the Bank of England since the beginning of the 20th century:

Since 2013, the Bank has had a <a href="chief%20operating%20officer">chief operating officer</a> (COO). , the Bank's COO has been <a href="Charlotte%20Hogg">Charlotte Hogg</a>.

, the Bank's <a href="chief%20economist">chief economist</a> is <a href="Andy%20Haldane">Andrew Haldane</a>.

One of the first plastics made from synthetic components, Bakelite was used for its electrical <a href="nonconductor">nonconductivity</a> and heat-resistant properties in electrical <a href="Insulator%20%28electricity%29">insulators</a>, radio and telephone casings and such diverse products as <a href="kitchenware">kitchenware</a>, <a href="jewelry">jewelry</a>, pipe stems, children's <a href="toy">toy</a>s, and <a href="firearms">firearms</a>. The "<a href="retro">retro</a>" appeal of old Bakelite products has made them collectible.

Bakelite was designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Chemical%20Landmarks">National Historic Chemical Landmark</a> on November 9, 1993, by the <a href="American%20Chemical%20Society">American Chemical Society</a> in recognition of its significance as the world's first <a href="synthetic%20plastic">synthetic plastic</a>.

Baekeland was already wealthy, due to his invention of Velox photographic paper, when he began to investigate the reactions of phenol and formaldehyde in his home laboratory. Chemists had begun to recognize that many natural resins and fibres were <a href="polymer">polymer</a>s. Baekeland's initial intent was to find a replacement for <a href="shellac">shellac</a>, a material that was in limited supply because it was made naturally from the excretion of <a href="lac%20insect">lac insect</a>s (specifically "<a href="Kerria%20lacca">Kerria lacca</a>"). Baekeland produced a soluble phenol-formaldehyde shellac called "Novolak", but it was not a market success.

Baekeland then began experimenting to strengthen wood by impregnating it with a synthetic resin, rather than coating it. By controlling the pressure and temperature applied to <a href="phenol">phenol</a> and <a href="formaldehyde">formaldehyde</a>, Baekeland produced a hard moldable material which he named "Bakelite". It was the first synthetic thermosetting plastic ever produced, and Baekeland speculated on "the thousand and one ... articles" that it could be used to make. Baekeland considered the possibilities of using a wide variety of filling materials, including cotton, powdered bronze, and slate dust, but was most successful with wood and <a href="asbestos">asbestos</a> fibers.

Baekeland filed a substantial number of patents in the area. His "Method of making insoluble products of phenol and formaldehyde" was filed on July 13, 1907, and granted on December 7, 1909. Baekeland also filed for patent protection in other countries, including Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Hungary, Japan, Mexico, Russia, and Spain. He announced his invention at a meeting of the <a href="American%20Chemical%20Society">American Chemical Society</a> on February 5, 1909.

Baekeland started semi-commercial production of his new material in his home laboratory, marketing it as a material for electrical insulators. By 1910, he was producing enough material to justify expansion. He formed the General Bakelite Company as a U.S. company to manufacture and market his new industrial material. He also made overseas connections to produce materials in other countries.

Bijker gives a detailed discussion of the development of Bakelite and the Bakelite Company's production of various applications of materials. As of 1911, the company's main focus was laminating varnish, whose sales volume vastly outperformed both molding material and cast resin. By 1912, molding material was gaining ground, but its sales volume for the company did not exceed that of laminating varnish until the 1930s.

As the sales figures also show, the Bakelite Company produced "Transparent" cast resin (which did not include filler) for a small ongoing market during the 1910s and 1920s. Blocks or rods of cast resin, also known as "artificial amber", were machined and carved to create items such as pipe stems, cigarette holders and jewelry. However, the demand for molded plastics led the Bakelite Company to concentrate on molding, rather than developing market opportunities for cast resins.

The Bakelite Corporation was formed in 1922 (after patent litigation favorable to Baekeland) from a merger of three companies: Baekeland's General Bakelite Company; the Condensite Company, founded by J.W. Aylesworth; and the <a href="Formica%20%28plastic%29%23History">Redmanol</a> Chemical Products Company, founded by L.V. Redman. Under director of advertising and public relations Allan Brown, who came to Bakelite from Condensite, Bakelite was aggressively marketed as "The Material of A Thousand Uses". A filing for a <a href="trademark">trademark</a> featuring the letter B above the <a href="Infinity%20symbol">mathematical symbol for infinity</a> was made August 25, 1925, and claimed the mark was in use as of December 1, 1924. A wide variety of uses were listed in their trademark applications.

The first issue of "Plastics" magazine, October 1925, featured Bakelite on its cover, and included the article "Bakelite – What It Is" by Allan Brown. The range of colors available included "black, brown, red, yellow, green, gray, blue, and blends of two or more of these". The article emphasized that Bakelite came in various forms. "Bakelite is manufactured in several forms to suit varying requirements. In all these forms the fundamental basis is the initial Bakelite resin. This variety includes Clear Material, for jewelry, smokers' articles, etc.; cement, using in sealing electric light bulbs in metal bases; varnishes, for impregnating electric coils, etc.; lacquers, for protecting the surface of hardware; enamels, for giving resistive coating to industrial equipment; Laminated Bakelite, used for silent gears and insulation; and molding material, from which are formed innumerable articles of utility and beauty. The Molding Material is prepared ordinarily by the impregnation of cellulose substances with the initial 'uncured' resin." In a 1925 report, the United States Tariff Commission hailed the commercial manufacture of synthetic phenolic resin as "distinctly an American achievement", and noted that "the publication of figures, however, would be a virtual disclosure of the production of an individual company".

In England, Bakelite Limited, a merger of three British phenol formaldehyde resin suppliers (Damard Lacquer Company Limited of <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, Mouldensite Limited of Darley Dale and Redmanol Chemical Products Company of <a href="London">London</a>), was formed in 1926. A new Bakelite factory opened in <a href="Tyseley">Tyseley</a>, Birmingham, around 1928. It was demolished in 1998.

A new factory was opened in <a href="Bound%20Brook%2C%20New%20Jersey">Bound Brook, New Jersey</a>, in 1931. In 1939, the companies were acquired by <a href="Union%20Carbide">Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation</a>. Union Carbide's phenolic resin business including the Bakelite and Bakelit registered trademarks are owned by <a href="Momentive%20Specialty%20Chemicals">Momentive Specialty Chemicals</a>.

In addition to the original Bakelite material, these companies eventually made a wide range of other products, many of which were marketed under the brand name "Bakelite plastics". These included other types of cast phenolic resins similar to <a href="Catalin">Catalin</a>, and urea-formaldehyde resins, which could be made in brighter colors than polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride.

Once Baekeland's heat and pressure patents expired in 1927, Bakelite Corporation faced serious competition from other companies. Because molded Bakelite incorporated fillers to give it strength, it tended to be made in concealing dark colors. In 1927, beads, bangles and earrings were produced by the <a href="Catalin">Catalin</a> Company, through a different process which enabled them to introduce 15 new colors. Translucent jewelry, poker chips and other items made of phenolic resins were introduced in the 1930s or 1940s by the Catalin Company under the Prystal name. The creation of marbled phenolic resins may also be attributable to the Catalin Company.

Making Bakelite was a multi-stage process. It began with the heating of phenol and formaldehyde in the presence of a catalyst such as <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a>, <a href="zinc%20chloride">zinc chloride</a>, or the base <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>. This created a liquid condensation product, referred to as "Bakelite A", which was soluble in alcohol, acetone, or additional phenol. Heated further, the product became partially soluble and could still be softened by heat. Sustained heating resulted in an "insoluble hard gum". However, the high temperatures required to create this tended to cause violent foaming of the mixture, which resulted in the cooled material being porous and breakable. Baekeland's innovative step was to put his "last condensation product" into an egg-shaped "Bakelizer". By heating it under pressure, at about , Baekeland was able to suppress the foaming that would otherwise occur. The resulting substance was extremely hard and both infusible and insoluble. 

Molded Bakelite forms in a condensation reaction of phenol and formaldehyde, with <a href="wood%20flour">wood flour</a> or <a href="asbestos">asbestos</a> fiber as a filler, under high pressure and heat in a time frame of a few minutes of <a href="Curing%20%28chemistry%29">curing</a>. The result is a hard plastic material.

Bakelite's molding process had a number of advantages. Bakelite resin could be provided either as powder, or as preformed partially cured slugs, increasing the speed of the casting. Thermosetting resins such as Bakelite required heat and pressure during the molding cycle, but could be removed from the molding process without being cooled, again making the molding process faster. Also, because of the smooth polished surface that resulted, Bakelite objects required less finishing. Millions of parts could be duplicated quickly and relatively cheaply.

Another market for Bakelite resin was the creation of phenolic sheet materials. Phenolic sheet is a hard, dense material made by applying heat and pressure to layers of paper or glass cloth impregnated with synthetic resin. Cellulose <a href="paper">paper</a>, <a href="cotton">cotton</a> fabrics, <a href="Synthetic%20fiber">synthetic yarn</a> fabrics, <a href="Glass%20%28fiber%29">glass fabrics</a> and unwoven fabrics are all possible materials used in lamination. When heat and pressure are applied, <a href="polymerization">polymerization</a> transforms the layers into <a href="Thermosetting%20plastic">thermosetting</a> industrial laminated plastic.

Bakelite phenolic sheet is produced in many commercial grades and with various additives to meet diverse mechanical, electrical and thermal requirements. Some common types include:

Bakelite has a number of important properties. It can be molded very quickly, allowing identical units to be mass-produced. Moldings are smooth, retain their shape and are resistant to heat, scratches, and destructive solvents. It is also resistant to electricity, and prized for its low conductivity. It is not flexible.

Phenolic resin products may swell slightly under conditions of extreme humidity or perpetual dampness. When rubbed or burnt, Bakelite has a distinctive, acrid, sickly-sweet or fishy odor.

These characteristics made Bakelite particularly suitable as a molding compound, an adhesive or binding agent, a varnish, and as a protective coating. Bakelite was particularly suitable for the emerging electrical and automobile industries because of its extraordinarily high resistance to electricity, heat and chemical action.

The earliest commercial use of Bakelite in the electrical industry was the molding of tiny insulating bushings the size of mustard seeds, made in 1908 for the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation by Richard W. Seabury of the Boonton Rubber Company. Bakelite was soon used for non-conducting parts of telephones, radios and other electrical devices, including bases and sockets for light bulbs and electron tubes, supports for any type of electrical components, automobile distributor caps and other insulators.
By 1912, it was being used to make billiard balls, since its elasticity and the sound it made were similar to ivory.

During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Bakelite was used widely for machine parts, particularly electrical systems. Important projects included the Liberty Motor, the wireless telephone and radio phone and the use of micarta-bakelite propellors in the <a href="Martin%20NBS-1">NBS-1 bomber</a> and the <a href="Airco%20DH.4">DH-4B aeroplane</a>.

Bakelite's availability and ease and speed of molding helped to lower the costs of production and increase product availability so that both telephones and radios became common household consumer goods. It was also very important to the developing automobile industry. It was soon found in myriad other consumer products ranging from pipe stems and buttons to <a href="saxophone">saxophone</a> mouthpieces, <a href="Brownie%20%28camera%29">cameras</a>, early machine guns, and appliance casings.

Beginning in the 1920s, it became a popular material for jewelry. Designer <a href="Coco%20Chanel">Coco Chanel</a> included Bakelite bracelets in her <a href="costume%20jewelry">costume jewelry</a> collections. Designers such as <a href="Elsa%20Schiaparelli">Elsa Schiaparelli</a> used it for jewelry and also for specially designed dress buttons. Later, <a href="Diana%20Vreeland">Diana Vreeland</a>, editor of <a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>, was enthusiastic about Bakelite. Bakelite was also used to make presentation boxes for <a href="Breitling%20SA">Breitling</a> watches. Jewelry designers such as <a href="Jorge%20Caicedo%20Montes%20De%20Oca">Jorge Caicedo Montes De Oca</a> still use vintage Bakelite materials to make designer jewelry.

By 1930, designer <a href="Paul%20T.%20Frankl">Paul T. Frankl</a> considered Bakelite a "Materia Nova", "expressive of our own age". By the 1930s, Bakelite was used for game pieces like chessmen, poker chips, dominoes and <a href="mahjong">mahjong</a> sets. Kitchenware made with Bakelite, including canisters and tableware, was promoted for its resistance to heat and to chipping. In the mid-1930s, Northland marketed a line of skis with a black "Ebonite" base, a coating of Bakelite. By 1935, it was used in <a href="Rickenbacker">solid-body electric guitars</a>. Performers such as <a href="Jerry%20Byrd">Jerry Byrd</a> loved the tone of Bakelite guitars but found them difficult to keep in tune.

The British children's construction toy <a href="Bayko">Bayko</a>, launched in 1933, originally used Bakelite for many of its parts, and took its name from the material.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Bakelite was used in a variety of wartime equipment including pilot's goggles and field telephones. It was also used for patriotic wartime jewelry. In 1943, the thermosetting phenolic resin was even considered for the manufacture of coins, due to a shortage of traditional material. Bakelite and other non-metal materials were tested for usage for the <a href="Penny%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">one cent coin</a> in the US before the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Mint</a> settled on <a href="1943%20steel%20cent">zinc-coated steel</a>.

In 1947, Dutch art forger <a href="Han%20van%20Meegeren">Han van Meegeren</a> was convicted of forgery, after chemist and curator <a href="Paul%20B.%20Coremans">Paul B. Coremans</a> proved that a purported <a href="Johannes%20Vermeer">Vermeer</a> contained Bakelite, which van Meegeren had used as a paint hardener.

Bakelite was sometimes used as a substitute for metal in the magazine, pistol grip, fore grip, hand guard, and butt stock of firearms. Some early <a href="AK-74">AK-74</a> rifles have been identified as using Bakelite, but most were made with AG-S4, commonly mistaken for Bakelite.

By the late 1940s, newer materials were superseding Bakelite in many areas. <a href="Phenolic%20resin">Phenolics</a> are less frequently used in general consumer products today due to their cost and complexity of production and their brittle nature. They still appear in some applications where their specific properties are required, such as small precision-shaped components, molded disc brake cylinders, saucepan handles, electrical plugs, switches and parts for electrical irons, as well as in the area of inexpensive board and tabletop games produced in China, Hong Kong and India. Items such as <a href="billiard%20ball">billiard ball</a>s, dominoes and pieces for board games like <a href="chess">chess</a>, <a href="checkers">checkers</a>, and <a href="backgammon">backgammon</a> are constructed of Bakelite for its look, durability, fine polish, weight, and sound. Common dice are sometimes made of Bakelite for weight and sound, but the majority are made of a thermoplastic polymer such as <a href="acrylonitrile%20butadiene%20styrene">acrylonitrile butadiene styrene</a> (ABS).
Bakelite continues to be used for wire insulation, brake pads and related automotive components, and industrial electrical-related applications. Bakelite stock is still manufactured and produced in sheet, rod and tube form for industrial applications in the <a href="electronics">electronics</a>, <a href="power%20generation">power generation</a> and <a href="aerospace">aerospace</a> industries, and under a variety of commercial brand names.

Phenolic resins have been commonly used in ablative heat shields. Soviet heatshields for ICBM warheads and spacecraft reentry consisted of asbestos textolite, impregnated with Bakelite. Bakelite is also used in the mounting of metal samples in <a href="metallography">metallography</a>.

Bakelite items, particularly jewelry and radios, have become a popular <a href="collectible">collectible</a>. The term "Bakelite" is sometimes used in the resale market to indicate various types of early plastics, including <a href="Catalin">Catalin</a> and <a href="Faturan">Faturan</a>, which may be brightly colored, as well as items made of Bakelite material.

The <a href="United%20States%20Patent%20and%20Trademark%20Office">United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> granted Baekeland a patent for a "Method of making insoluble products of phenol and formaldehyde" on December 7, 1909. Producing hard, compact, insoluble and infusible condensation products of phenols and formaldehyde marked the beginning of the modern plastics industry.

<a href="Catalin">Catalin</a> was also a phenolic resin, similar to Bakelite, but contained different mineral fillers that allowed the production of light colors.
Condensites are similar thermoset materials having much the same properties, characteristics, and uses.
<a href="Crystalate">Crystalate</a> was an early plastic.
<a href="Faturan">Faturan</a> is phenolic resin, also similar to Bakelite, that turns red over time, regardless of its original color.

Bean

Bean is a common name for large <a href="seed">seed</a>s of several <a href="genus">genera</a> of the <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Fabaceae">Fabaceae</a> (also known as <a href="Leguminosae">Leguminosae</a>) which are used for human or animal food.

The word "bean" and its Germanic <a href="cognate">cognate</a>s (e.g., "<a href="wikt%3ABohne%23Noun">Bohne</a>") have existed in common use in <a href="West%20Germanic%20languages">West Germanic languages</a> since before the 12th century, referring to <a href="Vicia%20faba">broad beans</a> and other pod-borne seeds. This was long before the <a href="New%20World">New World</a> genus "<a href="Phaseolus">Phaseolus</a>" was known in Europe. After Columbian-era contact between Europe and the Americas, use of the word was extended to pod-borne seeds of "Phaseolus", such as the <a href="common%20bean">common bean</a> and the <a href="runner%20bean">runner bean</a>, and the related genus "<a href="Vigna">Vigna</a>". The term has long been applied generally to many other seeds of similar form, such as Old World <a href="soybean">soybean</a>s, <a href="pea">pea</a>s, <a href="chickpea">chickpea</a>s (garbanzo beans), other <a href="Vicia">vetches</a>, and <a href="Lupinus">lupins</a>, and even to those with slighter resemblances, such as <a href="coffee%20bean">coffee bean</a>s, <a href="vanilla">vanilla beans</a>, <a href="Ricinus">castor beans</a>, and <a href="cocoa%20bean">cocoa bean</a>s. Thus the term "bean" in general <a href="usage">usage</a> can mean a host of different species.

Seeds called "beans" are often included among the crops called "pulses" (<a href="legume">legume</a>s), although a narrower <a href="linguistic%20prescription">prescribed</a> sense of "pulses" reserves the word for leguminous crops harvested for their dry grain. The term "bean" usually excludes legumes with tiny seeds and which are used exclusively for <a href="forage">forage</a>, <a href="hay">hay</a>, and <a href="silage">silage</a> purposes (such as <a href="clover">clover</a> and <a href="alfalfa">alfalfa</a>). According to the United Nations <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> the term "bean" should include only species of "Phaseolus"; however, enforcing that <a href="linguistic%20prescription">prescription</a> has proven difficult for several reasons. One is that in the past, several species, including "Vigna angularis" (adzuki bean), "mungo" (<a href="black%20gram">black gram</a>), "radiata" (<a href="green%20gram">green gram</a>), and "aconitifolia" (<a href="moth%20bean">moth bean</a>), were classified as "Phaseolus" and later reclassified. Another is that it is not surprising that the prescription on limiting the use of the word, because it tries to replace the word's older senses with a newer one, has never been consistently followed in general <a href="usage">usage</a>.

Unlike the closely related pea, beans are a summer crop that need warm temperatures to grow. Maturity is typically 55–60 days from planting to harvest. As the bean pods mature, they turn yellow and dry up, and the beans inside change from green to their <a href="Phaseolus%20vulgaris">mature colour</a>. As a vine, bean plants need external support, which may be provided in the form of special "bean cages" or poles. Native Americans customarily grew them along with corn and squash (the so-called <a href="Three%20Sisters%20%28agriculture%29">Three Sisters</a>), with the tall <a href="plant%20stem">cornstalks</a> acting as support for the beans.

In more recent times, the so-called "bush bean" has been developed which does not require support and has all its pods develop simultaneously (as opposed to pole beans which develop gradually). This makes the bush bean more practical for commercial production.

Beans are one of the longest-cultivated plants. <a href="Broad%20beans">Broad beans</a>, also called fava beans, in their wild state the size of a small fingernail, were gathered in <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> and the Himalayan foothills. In a form improved from naturally occurring types, they were grown in Thailand since the early seventh millennium BCE, predating ceramics. They were deposited with the dead in <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>. Not until the second millennium BCE did cultivated, large-seeded broad beans appear in the Aegean, Iberia and transalpine Europe. In the "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>" (8th century BCE) is a passing mention of beans and <a href="chickpea">chickpea</a>s cast on the threshing floor.

Beans were an important source of <a href="Protein%20in%20nutrition">protein</a> throughout Old and New World history, and still are today.

The oldest-known domesticated beans in the Americas were found in <a href="Guitarrero%20Cave">Guitarrero Cave</a>, an archaeological site in <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, and dated to around the second millennium BCE.

Most of the kinds commonly eaten fresh or dried, those of the genus "Phaseolus", come originally from the Americas, being first seen by a European when <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>, during his exploration of what may have been the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>, found them growing in fields. Five kinds of "<a href="Phaseolus">Phaseolus</a>" beans were domesticated by pre-Columbian peoples: common beans ("<a href="Phaseolus%20vulgaris">Phaseolus vulgaris</a>") grown from Chile to the northern part of what is now the United States, and lima and sieva beans ("<a href="Phaseolus%20lunatus">Phaseolus lunatus</a>"), as well as the less widely distributed teparies ("<a href="Phaseolus%20acutifolius">Phaseolus acutifolius</a>"), scarlet runner beans ("<a href="Phaseolus%20coccineus">Phaseolus coccineus</a>") and polyanthus beans ("<a href="Phaseolus%20polyanthus">Phaseolus polyanthus</a>") One especially famous use of beans by pre-Columbian people as far north as the Atlantic seaboard is the "<a href="Three%20Sisters%20%28agriculture%29">Three Sisters</a>" method of <a href="companion%20plant">companion plant</a> cultivation:

Dry beans come from both Old World varieties of broad beans (fava beans) and New World varieties (kidney, black, cranberry, pinto, navy/haricot).

Beans are a <a href="heliotropic">heliotropic</a> plant, meaning that the leaves tilt throughout the day to face the sun. At night, they go into a folded "sleep" position.

Currently, the world genebanks hold about 40,000 bean varieties, although only a fraction are mass-produced for regular consumption.
Some bean types include:



Some kinds of raw beans contain a harmful tasteless toxin, <a href="lectin">lectin</a> <a href="phytohaemagglutinin">phytohaemagglutinin</a>, that must be removed by cooking. Red and <a href="kidney%20bean">kidney bean</a>s are particularly toxic, but other types also pose risks of <a href="food%20poisoning">food poisoning</a>. A recommended method is to boil the beans for at least ten minutes; undercooked beans may be more toxic than raw beans.

Cooking beans, without bringing them to the boil, in a <a href="slow%20cooker">slow cooker</a> at a temperature well below boiling may not destroy toxins. A case of poisoning by <a href="Lima%20bean">butter beans</a> used to make <a href="falafel">falafel</a> was reported; the beans were used instead of traditional <a href="broad%20bean">broad bean</a>s or <a href="chickpea">chickpea</a>s, soaked and ground without boiling, made into patties, and <a href="Shallow%20frying">shallow fried</a>.

Bean poisoning is not well known in the medical community, and many cases may be misdiagnosed or never reported; figures appear not to be available. In the case of the UK <a href="National%20Poisons%20Information%20Service">National Poisons Information Service</a>, available only to health professionals, the dangers of beans other than red beans were not flagged .

<a href="Fermentation%20%28food%29">Fermentation</a> is used in some parts of Africa to improve the nutritional value of beans by removing toxins. Inexpensive fermentation improves the nutritional impact of flour from dry beans and improves digestibility, according to research co-authored by Emire Shimelis, from the Food Engineering Program at Addis Ababa University. Beans are a major source of dietary <a href="protein%20%28nutrient%29">protein</a> in Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.

It is common to make <a href="beansprout">beansprout</a>s by letting some types of bean, often <a href="mung%20bean">mung bean</a>s, germinate in moist and warm conditions; beansprouts may be used as ingredients in cooked dishes, or eaten raw or lightly cooked. There have been many <a href="Beansprout%23health%20concerns">outbreaks of disease</a> from bacterial contamination, often by "<a href="salmonella">salmonella</a>", "<a href="listeria">listeria</a>", and "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">Escherichia coli</a>", of beansprouts not thoroughly cooked, some causing significant mortality.

Many types of bean contain significant amounts of <a href="antinutrient">antinutrient</a>s that inhibit some enzyme processes in the body. <a href="Phytic%20acid">Phytic acid</a> and phytates, present in grains, nuts, seeds and beans, interfere with bone growth and interrupt <a href="vitamin%20D">vitamin D</a> metabolism. Pioneering work on the effect of phytic acid was done by <a href="Edward%20Mellanby">Edward Mellanby</a> from 1939.

Beans are high in <a href="protein%20%28nutrient%29">protein</a>, <a href="Oligosaccharide">complex carbohydrates</a>, <a href="folate">folate</a>, and <a href="iron">iron</a>. Beans also have significant amounts of fiber and <a href="soluble%20fiber">soluble fiber</a>, with one cup of cooked beans providing between nine and 13 grams of fiber. Soluble fiber can help lower blood <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a>.
Consuming <a href="beans">beans</a> adds significant amounts of fiber and <a href="soluble%20fiber">soluble fiber</a> to a diet, with one cup of cooked beans providing between nine and thirteen grams of fiber. Soluble fiber can help lower blood <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a>. Adults are recommended to have up to two (female), and three (male) servings. 3/4 cup of cooked beans provide one serving.

Many edible beans, including broad beans and soybeans, contain <a href="oligosaccharide">oligosaccharide</a>s (particularly <a href="raffinose">raffinose</a> and <a href="stachyose">stachyose</a>), a type of sugar molecule also found in <a href="cabbage">cabbage</a>. An anti-oligosaccharide <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> is necessary to properly digest these sugar molecules. As a normal human digestive tract does not contain any anti-oligosaccharide enzymes, consumed oligosaccharides are typically digested by <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> in the large intestine. This digestion process produces <a href="flatulence">flatulence</a>-causing gases as a byproduct. Since sugar dissolves in water, another method of reducing flatulence associated with eating beans is to drain the water in which the beans have been cooked.

Some species of <a href="mold">mold</a> produce alpha-galactosidase, an anti-oligosaccharide enzyme, which humans can take to facilitate digestion of oligosaccharides in the small intestine. This enzyme, currently sold in the United States under the brand-names <a href="Beano%20%28dietary%20supplement%29">Beano</a> and Gas-X Prevention, can be added to food or consumed separately. In many cuisines beans are cooked along with natural <a href="carminative">carminative</a>s such as <a href="anise">anise</a> seeds, <a href="coriander">coriander</a> seeds and <a href="cumin">cumin</a> .

One effective strategy is to soak beans in alkaline (<a href="Sodium%20bicarbonate">baking soda</a>) water overnight before rinsing thoroughly. Sometimes <a href="vinegar">vinegar</a> is added, but only after the beans are cooked as vinegar interferes with the beans' softening.

Fermented beans will usually not produce most of the intestinal problems that unfermented beans will, since yeast can consume the offending sugars.

The world leader in production of dry beans is Myanmar (Burma), followed by India and Brazil. In Africa, the most important producer is Tanzania.

Breast

The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Dorsal%20and%20ventral">ventral</a> region of the <a href="torso">torso</a> of <a href="primate">primate</a>s. In females, it serves as the <a href="mammary%20gland">mammary gland</a>, which produces and secretes milk and feeds <a href="infant">infant</a>s. Both females and males develop breasts from the same <a href="embryology">embryological</a> tissues. At <a href="puberty">puberty</a>, <a href="estrogen">estrogen</a>s, in conjunction with <a href="growth%20hormone">growth hormone</a>, cause <a href="breast%20development">breast development</a>.

<a href="Subcutaneous%20fat">Subcutaneous fat</a> covers and envelops a network of <a href="lactiferous%20duct">ducts</a> that converge on the <a href="nipple">nipple</a>, and these <a href="tissue%20%28biology%29">tissues</a> give the breast its size and shape. At the ends of the ducts are <a href="mammary%20lobule">lobules</a>, or clusters of <a href="mammary%20alveolus">alveoli</a>, where milk is produced and stored in response to <a href="hormone">hormonal signals</a>. During pregnancy, the breast responds to a complex interaction of hormones, including estrogens, <a href="progesterone">progesterone</a>, and <a href="prolactin">prolactin</a>, that mediate the completion of its development, namely lobuloalveolar maturation, in preparation of <a href="lactation">lactation</a> and <a href="breastfeeding">breastfeeding</a>.

Along with their major function in providing nutrition for infants, female breasts have social and sexual characteristics. Breasts have been featured in notable ancient and modern sculpture, art, and photography. Female breasts can figure prominently in a woman's perception of her body image and sexual attractiveness. A number of <a href="Western%20culture">Western culture</a>s associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts in public as immodest or indecent. Breasts and especially the nipples are an <a href="erogenous%20zone">erogenous zone</a> on women.

The English word "breast" derives from the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> word "brēost" (breast, bosom) from <a href="Proto-Germanic">Proto-Germanic</a> "breustam" (breast), from the Proto-Indo-European base bhreus– (to swell, to sprout). The "breast" spelling conforms to the Scottish and North English dialectal pronunciations. The "Merriam-Webster Dictionary" states that "Middle English brest, [comes] from Old English brēost; akin to Old High German brust..., Old Irish brú [belly], [and] Russian bryukho"; the first known usage of the term was before the 12th century.

A large number of colloquial terms for breasts are used in English, ranging from fairly polite terms to vulgar or slang. Some vulgar slang expressions may be considered to be derogatory or sexist to women.

In women, the breasts overlay the <a href="pectoralis%20major%20muscle">pectoralis major muscle</a>s and usually extend from the level of the second rib to the level of the sixth rib in the front of the <a href="human%20rib%20cage">human rib cage</a>; thus, the breasts cover much of the chest area and the chest walls. At the front of the chest, the breast tissue can extend from the <a href="clavicle">clavicle</a> (collarbone) to the middle of the <a href="sternum">sternum</a> (breastbone). At the sides of the chest, the breast tissue can extend into the <a href="axilla">axilla</a> (armpit), and can reach as far to the back as the <a href="latissimus%20dorsi%20muscle">latissimus dorsi muscle</a>, extending from the lower back to the <a href="humerus">humerus</a> bone (the longest bone of the upper arm). As a <a href="mammary%20gland">mammary gland</a>, the breast is composed of differing layers of <a href="Histology">tissue</a>, predominantly two types: <a href="adipose%20tissue">adipose tissue</a>; and <a href="Lactiferous%20duct">glandular tissue</a>, which affects the lactation functions of the breasts.
<a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">Morphologically</a> the breast is tear-shaped. The superﬁcial tissue layer (<a href="superficial%20fascia">superficial fascia</a>) is separated from the skin by 0.5–2.5 cm of subcutaneous fat (adipose tissue). The <a href="Cooper%27s%20ligaments">suspensory Cooper's ligaments</a> are fibrous-tissue prolongations that radiate from the superficial fascia to the skin envelope. The female adult breast contains 14–18 irregular lactiferous lobes that converge at the nipple. Milk exits the breast through the nipple, which is surrounded by a pigmented area of skin called the areola. The size of the areola can vary widely among women. The areola contains modified <a href="sebaceous%20gland">sweat glands</a> known as <a href="Areolar%20gland">Montgomery's glands</a>. These glands secrete oily fluid that lubricate and protect the nipple during breastfeeding. Volatile compounds in these secretions may also serve as an olfactory stimulus for the newborn's appetite.

The 2.0–4.5 mm milk ducts are immediately surrounded with dense connective tissue that support the glands. The glandular tissue of the breast is biochemically supported by <a href="estrogen">estrogen</a>. When a woman ceases <a href="menopause">menstruation</a> and her estrogen levels decrease, <a href="breast%20atrophy">breast atrophy</a> occurs; milk gland tissue atrophies, withers, and disappears, resulting in a breast composed of adipose tissue, superﬁcial fascia, suspensory ligaments, and the skin envelope.

The dimensions and weight of the breast vary widely among women. A small-to-medium-sized breast weighs 500 grams (1.1 pounds) or less, and a large breast can weigh approximately 750 to 1,000 grams (1.7 to 2.2 pounds) or more. The tissue composition ratios of the breast also vary among women. Some women's breasts have varying proportions of glandular tissue than of adipose or <a href="connective%20tissue">connective</a> tissues. The fat-to-connective-tissue ratio determines the density or firmness of the breast. During a woman's life, her breasts change size, shape, and weight due to hormonal changes during <a href="thelarche">puberty</a>, <a href="menstruation">fertility</a>, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and menopause.

The breast is an <a href="apocrine">apocrine</a> gland that produces the <a href="Breast%20milk">milk</a> used to feed an infant. The <a href="nipple">nipple</a> of the breast is surrounded by the <a href="areola">areola</a> (nipple-areola complex). The areola has many sebaceous glands, and the skin color varies from pink to dark brown. The basic units of the breast are the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs), which produce the fatty breast milk. They give the breast its offspring-feeding functions as a mammary gland. They are distributed throughout the body of the breast. Approximately two-thirds of the lactiferous tissue is within 30 mm of the base of the nipple. The terminal lactiferous ducts drain the milk from TDLUs into 4–18 lactiferous ducts, which drain to the nipple. The milk-glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in a lactating woman, and 1:1 in a non-lactating woman. In addition to the milk glands, the breast is also composed of connective tissues (<a href="collagen">collagen</a>, <a href="elastin">elastin</a>), white fat, and the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. Sensation in the breast is provided by the <a href="peripheral%20nervous%20system">peripheral nervous system</a> innervation by means of the front (anterior) and side (lateral) cutaneous branches of the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth <a href="intercostal%20nerves">intercostal nerves</a>. The T-4 nerve (<a href="Thoracic%20spinal%20nerve%204">Thoracic spinal nerve 4</a>), which innervates the <a href="dermatomic%20area">dermatomic area</a>, supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.

Approximately 75% of the <a href="lymph">lymph</a> from the breast travels to the axillary <a href="lymph%20node">lymph node</a>s on the same side of the body, whilst 25% of the lymph travels to the parasternal nodes (beside the sternum bone). A small amount of remaining lymph travels to the other breast and to the abdominal lymph nodes. The <a href="axillary%20lymph%20node">axillary lymph node</a>s include the pectoral (chest), subscapular (under the scapula), and humeral (humerus-bone area) lymph-node groups, which drain to the central <a href="axillary%20lymph%20nodes">axillary lymph nodes</a> and to the apical axillary lymph nodes. The lymphatic drainage of the breasts is especially relevant to <a href="oncology">oncology</a> because breast cancer is common to the mammary gland, and cancer cells can <a href="Metastasis">metastasize</a> (break away) from a <a href="tumour">tumour</a> and be dispersed to other parts of the body by means of the lymphatic system.

The morphologic variations in the size, shape, volume, tissue density, pectoral locale, and spacing of the breasts determine their natural shape, appearance, and position on a woman's chest. Breast size and other characteristics do not predict the fat-to-milk-gland ratio or the potential for the woman to nurse an infant. The size and the shape of the breasts are influenced by normal-life hormonal changes (thelarche, menstruation, pregnancy, menopause) and medical conditions (e.g. <a href="virginal%20breast%20hypertrophy">virginal breast hypertrophy</a>). The shape of the breasts is naturally determined by the support of the suspensory Cooper's ligaments, the underlying muscle and bone structures of the chest, and by the skin envelope. The suspensory ligaments sustain the breast from the clavicle (collarbone) and the clavico-pectoral fascia (collarbone and chest) by traversing and encompassing the fat and milk-gland tissues. The breast is positioned, affixed to, and supported upon the chest wall, while its shape is established and maintained by the skin envelope. In most women, one breast is slightly larger than the other. More obvious and persistent asymmetry in breast size occurs in up to 25% of women.

While it has been a common belief that breastfeeding causes breasts to sag, researchers have found that a woman's breasts <a href="ptosis%20%28breasts%29">sag</a> due to four key factors: cigarette smoking, <a href="gravidity">number of pregnancies</a>, <a href="gravity">gravity</a>, and weight loss or gain.

The base of each breast is attached to the chest by the deep fascia over the pectoralis major muscles. The space between the breast and the pectoralis major muscle, called <a href="retromammary%20space">retromammary space</a>, gives mobility to the breast. 
The chest (<a href="thoracic%20cavity">thoracic cavity</a>) progressively slopes outwards from the thoracic inlet (atop the <a href="Human%20breastbone">breastbone</a>) and above to the lowest ribs that support the breasts. The inframammary fold, where the lower portion of the breast meets the chest, is an anatomic feature created by the adherence of the breast skin and the underlying connective tissues of the chest; the IMF is the lower-most extent of the anatomic breast.

The study "The Evolution of the Human Breast" (2001) proposed that the rounded shape of a woman's breast evolved to prevent the sucking infant offspring from suffocating while feeding at the teat; that is, because of the human infant's small jaw, which did not project from the face to reach the nipple, he or she might block the <a href="Nose">nostrils</a> against the mother's breast if it were of a flatter form (cf. <a href="chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a>). Theoretically, as the human jaw receded into the face, the woman's body compensated with round breasts.

The breasts are principally composed of adipose, <a href="glandular%20tissue">glandular</a>, and <a href="w%3Aconnective%20tissue">connective</a> tissues. Because these tissues have hormone receptors, their sizes and volumes fluctuate according to the hormonal changes particular to thelarche (sprouting of breasts), menstruation (egg production), pregnancy (reproduction), lactation (feeding of offspring), and menopause (end of menstruation).

The morphological structure of the human breast is identical in males and females until <a href="puberty">puberty</a>. For pubescent girls in thelarche (the breast-development stage), the female <a href="sex%20hormone">sex hormone</a>s (principally estrogens) in conjunction with <a href="growth%20hormone">growth hormone</a> promote the sprouting, growth, and development of the breasts. During this time, the mammary glands grow in size and volume and begin resting on the chest. These development stages of <a href="secondary%20sex%20characteristic">secondary sex characteristic</a>s (breasts, pubic hair, etc.) are illustrated in the five-stage <a href="Tanner%20stage">Tanner Scale</a>.

During thelarche, the developing breasts are sometimes of unequal size, and usually the left breast is slightly larger. This condition of asymmetry is transitory and statistically normal in female physical and sexual development. Abnormal breast development is manifests itself either as overdevelopment (e.g., virginal breast hypertrophy, <a href="macromastia">macromastia</a>) or as underdevelopment (e.g., <a href="tuberous%20breast%20deformity">tuberous breast deformity</a>, <a href="micromastia">micromastia</a>) in girls and women.

Approximately two years after the onset of puberty (a girl's first <a href="menstrual%20cycle">menstrual cycle</a>), estrogen and growth hormone stimulate the development and growth of the glandular fat and suspensory tissues that compose the breast. This continues for approximately four years until the final shape of the breast (size, volume, density) is established at about the age of 21. <a href="Mammoplasia">Mammoplasia</a> (breast enlargement) in girls begins at puberty, unlike all other primates in which breasts enlarge only during lactation.

During the menstrual cycle, the breasts are enlarged by <a href="premenstrual%20water%20retention">premenstrual water retention</a> and temporary growth.

During pregnancy, the breasts become enlarged and denser (firmer) because of the prolactin-caused organ <a href="hypertrophy">hypertrophy</a>. This begins the production of breast milk, increases the size of the nipples, and darkens the skin color of the nipple-areola complex. These changes continue during the lactation and <a href="breastfeeding">breastfeeding</a> periods. Afterwards, the breasts generally revert to their pre-pregnancy size, shape, and volume, but might show stretch marks.

At menopause, breast atrophy occurs. The breasts can decrease in size when the levels of circulating estrogen decline. The adipose tissue and milk glands also begin to wither. The breasts can also become enlarged from <a href="Adverse%20effect">adverse side effect</a>s of <a href="combined%20oral%20contraceptive%20pill">combined oral contraceptive pill</a>s. The size of the breasts can also increase and decrease in response to <a href="body%20weight">weight</a> fluctuations. Physical changes to the breasts are often are recorded in the <a href="stretch%20marks">stretch marks</a> of the skin envelope; they can serve as historical indicators of the increments and the decrements of the size and volume of a woman's breasts throughout the course of her life.

The primary function of the breasts, as mammary glands, is the feeding and nourishing of an infant with breast milk during the maternal <a href="lactation">lactation</a> period. The round shape of the breast helps to limit the loss of maternal body heat. Milk production depends upon a higher-temperature environment for the milk-production function of the mammary gland tissues, the <a href="lactiferous%20ducts">lactiferous ducts</a>.

The breast is susceptible to numerous benign and malignant conditions. The most frequent benign conditions are <a href="puerperal%20mastitis">puerperal mastitis</a>, <a href="fibrocystic%20breast%20changes">fibrocystic breast changes</a> and <a href="mastalgia">mastalgia</a>. Lactation unrelated to pregnancy can occur as <a href="galactorrhea">galactorrhea</a> (spontaneous milk flow) from the adverse effects of drugs (e.g. <a href="antipsychotic">antipsychotic</a> medications), extreme physical stress, or <a href="endocrine">endocrine</a> disorders. In a newborn infant, the capability of lactation is a consequence of the mother's circulating hormones (<a href="prolactin">prolactin</a>, <a href="oxytocin">oxytocin</a>, etc.) in his or her blood stream, which were introduced by the shared circulatory system of the <a href="placenta">placenta</a>.

Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among women and it is one of the leading causes of death among women. Factors that appear to be implicated in decreasing the risk of breast cancer are regular breast examinations by health care professionals, regular <a href="mammograms">mammograms</a>, <a href="Breast%20self-examination">self-examination of breasts</a>, healthy diet, and exercise to decrease excess body fat.

Both females and males develop breasts from the same <a href="embryology">embryological</a> tissues. Normally, males produce lower levels of estrogens and higher levels of <a href="androgen">androgen</a>s, namely <a href="testosterone">testosterone</a>, which suppress the effects of estrogens in developing excessive breast tissue.
In boys and men, abnormal breast development is manifested as <a href="gynecomastia">gynecomastia</a>, the consequence of a biochemical imbalance between the normal levels of estrogen and testosterone in the male body. Around 70% of boys temporarily develop breast tissue during adolescence. The condition usually resolves by itself within two years. When <a href="male%20lactation">male lactation</a> occurs, it is considered a symptom of a disorder of the <a href="pituitary%20gland">pituitary gland</a>.

In <a href="Saint%20symbology">Christian iconography</a>, some works of art depict women with their breasts in their hands or on a platter, signifying that they died as a martyr by having their breasts severed; one example of this is <a href="Agatha%20of%20Sicily">Saint Agatha of Sicily</a>.

<a href="Femen">Femen</a> is a <a href="feminism">feminist</a> activist group which uses <a href="topless%20protest">topless protest</a>s as part of their campaigns against <a href="sex%20tourism">sex tourism</a> religious institutions, sexism, homophobia and to "defend [women's] right to abortion". Femen activists have been regularly detained by police in response to their protests.

There is a long history of female breasts being used by comedians as a subject for comedy fodder (e.g., British comic <a href="Benny%20Hill">Benny Hill's</a> burlesque/slapstick routines).

In European pre-historic societies, sculptures of female figures with pronounced or highly exaggerated breasts were common. A typical example is the so-called <a href="Venus%20of%20Willendorf">Venus of Willendorf</a>, one of many <a href="Paleolithic">Paleolithic</a> <a href="Venus%20figurines">Venus figurines</a> with ample hips and bosom. Artifacts such as bowls, rock carvings and sacred statues with breasts have been recorded from 15,000 BC up to late antiquity all across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.

Many female deities representing love and fertility were associated with breasts and breast milk. Figures of the Phoenician goddess <a href="Astarte">Astarte</a> were represented as pillars studded with breasts. <a href="Isis">Isis</a>, an Egyptian goddess who represented, among many other things, ideal motherhood, was often portrayed as suckling <a href="pharaohs">pharaohs</a>, thereby confirming their divine status as rulers. Even certain male deities representing regeneration and fertility were occasionally depicted with breast-like appendices, such as the river god <a href="Hapy">Hapy</a> who was considered to be responsible for the annual overflowing of the <a href="Nile">Nile</a>.

Female breasts were also prominent in the <a href="Minoan%20civilization">Minoan civilization</a> in the form of the famous <a href="Snake%20Goddess">Snake Goddess</a> statuettes. In <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a> there were several cults worshipping the "Kourotrophos", the suckling mother, represented by goddesses such as <a href="Gaia%20%28mythology%29">Gaia</a>, <a href="Hera">Hera</a> and <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a>. The worship of deities symbolized by the female breast in Greece became less common during the first millennium. The popular adoration of female goddesses decreased significantly during the rise of the Greek city states, a legacy which was passed on to the later <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>.

During the middle of the first millennium BC, Greek culture experienced a gradual change in the perception of female breasts. Women in art were covered in clothing from the neck down, including female goddesses like <a href="Athena">Athena</a>, the patron of Athens who represented heroic endeavor. There were exceptions: <a href="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>, the goddess of love, was more frequently portrayed fully nude, though in postures that were intended to portray shyness or modesty, a portrayal that has been compared to modern <a href="Pin-up">pin ups</a> by historian <a href="Marilyn%20Yalom">Marilyn Yalom</a>. Although nude men were depicted standing upright, most depictions of female nudity in Greek art occurred "usually with drapery near at hand and with a forward-bending, self-protecting posture". A popular legend at the time was of the <a href="Amazons">Amazons</a>, a tribe of fierce female warriors who socialized with men only for procreation and even removed one breast to become better warriors (the idea being that the right breast would interfere with the operation of a bow and arrow). The legend was a popular motif in art during Greek and Roman antiquity and served as an antithetical cautionary tale.

Many women regard their breasts as important to their <a href="sexual%20attractiveness">sexual attractiveness</a>, as a sign of <a href="femininity">femininity</a> that is important to their <a href="Self-concept">sense of self</a>. Due to this, when a woman considers her breasts deficient in some respect, she might choose to undergo a plastic surgery procedure to enhance them, either to have them augmented or to have them reduced, or to have them <a href="reconstructive%20surgery">reconstructed</a> if she has a deformative disease, such as breast cancer. After <a href="mastectomy">mastectomy</a>, the reconstruction of the breast or breasts is done with <a href="breast%20implants">breast implants</a> or autologous tissue transfer, using fat and tissues from the abdomen, which is performed with a <a href="TRAM%20flap">TRAM flap</a> or with a back (latissiumus muscle flap). Breast reduction surgery is a procedure that involves removing excess breast tissue, fat, and skin, and the repositioning of the nipple-areola complex.

Cosmetic improvement procedures include breast lift (mastopexy), breast augmentation with implants, and combination procedures; the two types of available <a href="breast%20implant">breast implant</a>s are models filled with <a href="silicone">silicone</a> gel, and models filled with <a href="Saline%20%28medicine%29">saline solution</a>. These types of breast surgery can also repair <a href="inverted%20nipple">inverted nipple</a>s by releasing milk duct tissues that have become tethered. Furthermore, in the case of the <a href="Obesity">obese</a> woman, a breast lift (mastopexy) procedure, with or without a breast volume reduction, can be part of an upper-body lift and contouring for the woman who has undergone massive body weight loss.

Surgery of the breast presents the health risk of interfering with the ability to breast-feed an infant child, and might include consequences such as altered sensation in the nipple-areola complex, interference with <a href="mammography">mammography</a> (breast x-rays images) when there are breast implants present in the breasts. Regarding breastfeeding capability after breast reduction surgery, studies reported that women who underwent breast reduction can retain the ability to nurse an infant child, when compared to women in a control group who underwent breast surgery using a modern pedicle surgical technique. Plastic surgery organizations generally discourage elective cosmetic breast augmentation surgery for teen-aged girls, because, at that age, the volume of the breast tissues (milk glands and fat) can continue to grow as the girl matures to womanhood. Breast reduction surgery for teen-aged girls, however, is a matter handled according to the particulars of the case of hypoplasia (see: <a href="Hypertrophy%20of%20breast">breast hypertrophy</a>) In cases where a woman's breasts are severely asymmetrical, surgery can be performed to either enlarge the smaller breast, reduce the size of the larger breast, or both.

Other potential means of <a href="breast%20enlargement">breast enlargement</a> also exist, such as <a href="hormonal%20breast%20enhancement">hormonal breast enhancement</a>.

Because breasts are mostly fatty tissue, their shape can within limits be molded by clothing, such as <a href="foundation%20garment">foundation garment</a>s. <a href="brassiere">Bras</a> are commonly worn by about 90% of Western women, and are often worn for support. The <a href="social%20norm">social norm</a> in most <a href="Western%20culture">Western culture</a>s is to cover breasts in public, though the extent of coverage varies depending on the social context. Some religions ascribe a special status to the female breast, either in formal teachings or through symbolism. <a href="Islam">Islam</a> forbids women from exposing their breasts in public.

Many cultures, including Western cultures in North America, associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts as <a href="modesty">immodest</a> or <a href="decency">indecent</a>. In some cultures, like the <a href="Himba%20people">Himba</a> in northern <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>, bare-breasted women are normal, while a thigh is highly sexualised and not exposed in public. In a few <a href="Western%20world">Western countries</a> and regions female <a href="toplessness">toplessness</a> at a beach is acceptable, although it may not be acceptable in the town center. In some jurisdictions where women can legally expose their breasts, the nipples must be covered (e.g., with "<a href="pasties">pasties</a>").

In some countries, women who <a href="History%20of%20breastfeeding%23Breastfeeding%20in%20public">breast-feed</a> in public can receive negative attention. There have been instances where women have been asked to leave public venues. In New York, the <a href="topfreedom">topfreedom</a> equality movement helped to bring a case, "People v. Santorelli" (1992), to the <a href="New%20York%20Court%20of%20Appeals">New York Court of Appeals</a>. They ruled that New York's indecent exposure laws did not apply to a bare-breasted woman. Other (gender equality) efforts succeeded in most of Canada in the 1990s. Bare-breasted women are legal and culturally acceptable at public beaches in Australia and much of Europe. Filmmaker <a href="Lina%20Esco">Lina Esco</a> made a film entitled "<a href="Free%20The%20Nipple">Free The Nipple</a>", which is about "...laws against female toplessness or restrictions on images of female, but not male, nipples", which Esco states is an example of <a href="sexism">sexism</a> in society.

In some cultures, breasts play a role in <a href="human%20sexual%20activity">human sexual activity</a>. In Western culture, breasts have a "...hallowed sexual status, arguably more fetishized than either sex’s genitalia". Breasts and especially the nipples are among the various human <a href="erogenous%20zone">erogenous zone</a>s. They are sensitive to the touch as they have many nerve endings; and it is common to press or <a href="massage">massage</a> them with hands or <a href="stimulation%20of%20nipples">orally</a> before or during sexual activity. During <a href="sexual%20arousal">sexual arousal</a>, breast size increases, <a href="vein">venous</a> patterns across the breasts become more visible, and nipples harden. Compared to other primates, human breasts are proportionately large throughout adult females' lives. Some writers have suggested that they may have evolved as a visual signal of sexual maturity and fertility.

Many people regard bare female breasts to be <a href="aesthetics">aesthetically</a> pleasing or <a href="erotic">erotic</a>, and they can elicit heightened <a href="sexual%20desire">sexual desire</a>s in men in many cultures. In the <a href="History%20of%20India">ancient Indian</a> work the "<a href="Kama%20Sutra">Kama Sutra</a>", light scratching of the breasts with nails and biting with teeth are considered erotic. Some people show a <a href="sexual%20interest">sexual interest</a> in female breasts distinct from that of the person, which may be regarded as a <a href="breast%20fetish">breast fetish</a>. A number of Western fashions include clothing which accentuate the breasts, such as the use of <a href="push-up%20bra">push-up bra</a>s and <a href="decollete">decollete</a> (plunging neckline) gowns and blouses which show <a href="cleavage%20%28breasts%29">cleavage</a>. While U.S. culture prefers breasts that are youthful and upright, some cultures venerate women with drooping breasts, indicating mothering and the wisdom of experience.

Research conducted at the <a href="Victoria%20University%20of%20Wellington">Victoria University of Wellington</a> showed that breasts are often the first thing men look at, and for a longer time than other body parts.
The writers of the study had initially speculated that the reason for this is due to <a href="endocrinology">endocrinology</a> with larger breasts indicating higher levels of estrogen and a sign of greater fertility, but the researchers said that "Men may be looking more often at the breasts because they are simply aesthetically pleasing, regardless of the size."

Some women report achieving an <a href="orgasm">orgasm</a> from nipple stimulation, but this is rare. Research suggests that the orgasms are genital orgasms, and may also be directly linked to "the genital area of the brain". In these cases, it seems that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina, clitoris and cervix. Nipple stimulation may trigger uterine contractions, which then produce a sensation in the genital area of the brain.

There are many mountains named after the breast because they resemble it in appearance and so are objects of religious and ancestral veneration as a fertility symbol and of well-being. In Asia, there was "Breast Mountain", which had a cave where the <a href="Buddhist%20monk">Buddhist monk</a> <a href="Bodhidharma">Bodhidharma</a> (Da Mo) spent much time in <a href="meditation">meditation</a>. Other such breast mountains are <a href="Mount%20Elgon">Mount Elgon</a> on the <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>-<a href="Kenya">Kenya</a> border, <a href="Lochnagar">Beinn Chìochan</a> and the <a href="Maiden%20Paps%2C%20Caithness">Maiden Paps</a> in Scotland, the "Bundok ng Susong Dalaga" (Maiden's breast mountains) in <a href="Talim%20Island">Talim Island</a>, Philippines, the twin hills known as the <a href="Paps%20of%20Anu">Paps of Anu</a> ("Dá Chích Anann" or "the breasts of <a href="Anu%20%28goddess%29">Anu</a>"), near <a href="Killarney">Killarney</a> in Ireland, the 2,086 m high "Tetica de Bacares" or "La Tetica" in the <a href="Sierra%20de%20Los%20Filabres">Sierra de Los Filabres</a>, Spain, and <a href="Khao%20Nom%20Sao">Khao Nom Sao</a> in Thailand, <a href="Cerro%20Las%20Tetas">Cerro Las Tetas</a> in <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and the Breasts of Aphrodite in Mykonos, among many others.

Baghdad

Baghdad (, ) is the capital of <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>. The population of Baghdad, , is approximately 8,765,000, making it the largest city in Iraq, the second largest city in the <a href="Arab%20world">Arab world</a> (after <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>), and the second largest city in <a href="Western%20Asia">Western Asia</a> (after <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>).

Located along the <a href="Tigris">Tigris River</a>, the city was founded in the 8th century and became the capital of the <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a>. Within a short time of its inception, Baghdad evolved into a significant cultural, commercial, and intellectual center for the <a href="Islamic%20world">Islamic world</a>. This, in addition to housing several key academic institutions (e.g., <a href="House%20of%20Wisdom">House of Wisdom</a>), garnered the city a worldwide reputation as the "Centre of Learning".

For five centuries from its founding Baghdad was the largest city of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, peaking at a population of more than a million. The city was largely <a href="Siege%20of%20Baghdad%20%281258%29">destroyed</a> at the hands of the <a href="Mongol%20Empire">Mongol Empire</a> in 1258, resulting in a decline that would linger through many centuries due to frequent plagues and multiple successive empires. With the recognition of Iraq as an independent state (formerly the <a href="British%20Mandate%20of%20Mesopotamia">British Mandate of Mesopotamia</a>) in 1938, Baghdad gradually regained some of its former prominence as a significant center of <a href="Arab%20culture">Arab culture</a>.

In contemporary times, the city has often faced severe infrastructural damage, most recently due to the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>, and the subsequent <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a> that lasted until December 2011. In recent years, the city has been frequently subjected to <a href="Iraqi%20insurgency%20%28Iraq%20War%29">insurgency</a> attacks. , Baghdad was listed as one of the least hospitable places in the world to live, and was ranked by <a href="Mercer%20%28consulting%20firm%29">Mercer</a> as the worst of 221 major cities as measured by quality-of-life.

The name Baghdad is pre-Islamic, and its origin is disputed. The site where the city of Baghdad developed has been populated for millennia. By the 8th century AD, several villages had developed there, including a Persian hamlet called "Baghdad," the name which would come to be used for the Abbasid metropolis.

Arab authors, realizing the pre-Islamic origins of Baghdad's name, generally looked for its roots in Persian. They suggested various meanings, the most common of which was "bestowed by God". Modern scholars generally tend to favor this etymology, which views the word as a compound of "bagh" () "god" and "dād" () "given", In <a href="Old%20Persian">Old Persian</a> the first element can be traced to "boghu" and is related to Slavic "bog" "god", while the second can be traced to "dadāti". A similar term in Middle Persian is the name "Mithradāt" ("Mihrdād" in New Persian), known in English by its Hellenistic form <a href="Mithridates%20%28disambiguation%29">Mithridates</a>, meaning "gift of <a href="Mithra">Mithra</a>" ("dāt" is the more archaic form of "dād", related to Latin "dat" and English "donor"). There are a number of other locations in the wider region whose names are compounds of the word "bagh", including <a href="Baghlan">Baghlan</a> and <a href="Bagram">Bagram</a> in Afghanistan or a village called <a href="baghshan">Bagh-šan</a> in Iran. The name of the town <a href="Baghdati">Baghdati</a> in <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> shares the same etymological origins.

A few authors have suggested older origins for the name, in particular the name "Bagdadu" or "Hudadu" that existed in Old Babylonian (spelled with a sign that can represent both "bag" and "hu"), and the Babylonian Talmudic name of a place called "Baghdatha". Some scholars suggested Aramaic derivations.

When the Abbasid caliph, <a href="al-Mansur">al-Mansur</a>, founded a completely new city for his capital, he chose the name <a href="Round%20City%20of%20Baghdad">Madinat al-Salaam</a> or "City of Peace". This was the official name on coins, weights, and other official usage, although the common people continued to use the old name. By the 11th century, "Baghdad" became almost the exclusive name for the world-renowned metropolis.

After the fall of the <a href="Umayyad%20Caliphate">Umayyads</a>, the first Muslim dynasty, the victorious <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid</a> rulers wanted their own capital from which they could rule. They chose a site north of the <a href="Sassanid">Sassanid</a> capital of <a href="Ctesiphon">Ctesiphon</a> (and also just north of where ancient <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a> had once stood), and on 30 July 762 the <a href="caliph">caliph</a> <a href="Al-Mansur">Al-Mansur</a> commissioned the construction of the city. It was built under the supervision of the <a href="Barmakids">Barmakids</a>. Mansur believed that Baghdad was the perfect city to be the capital of the Islamic empire under the Abbasids. Mansur loved the site so much he is quoted saying: "This is indeed the city that I am to found, where I am to live, and where my descendants will reign afterward".

The city's growth was helped by its excellent location, based on at least two factors: it had control over strategic and trading routes along the <a href="Tigris">Tigris</a>, and it had an abundance of water in a dry climate. Water exists on both the north and south ends of the city, allowing all households to have a plentiful supply, which was very uncommon during this time.

Baghdad eclipsed Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sassanians, which was located some to the southeast. Today, all that remains of Ctesiphon is the shrine town of <a href="Salman%20Pak">Salman Pak</a>, just to the south of Greater Baghdad. Ctesiphon itself had replaced and absorbed <a href="Seleucia">Seleucia</a>, the first capital of the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>, which had earlier replaced the city of <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>.

In its early years, the city was known as a deliberate reminder of an expression in the <a href="Qur%27an">Qur'an</a>, when it refers to <a href="Paradise">Paradise</a>. It took four years to build (764–768). Mansur assembled engineers, surveyors, and art constructionists from around the world to come together and draw up plans for the city. Over 100,000 construction workers came to survey the plans; many were distributed salaries to start the building of the city. July was chosen as the starting time because two <a href="Astrology">astrologers</a>, <a href="Naubakht">Naubakht Ahvazi</a> and <a href="Mashallah%20ibn%20Athari">Mashallah</a>, believed that the city should be built under the sign of the <a href="Mesopotamian%20lion">lion</a>, <a href="Leo%20%28astrology%29">Leo</a>. Leo is associated with fire and symbolises productivity, pride, and expansion.

The bricks used to make the city were on all four sides. <a href="Abu%20Hanifa">Abu Hanifa</a>h was the counter of the bricks and he developed a canal, which brought water to the work site for the use of both human consumption and the manufacturing of the bricks. Marble was also used to make buildings throughout the city, and marble steps led down to the river's edge.

The basic framework of the city consists of two large semicircles about in diameter. The city was designed as a circle about in diameter, leading it to be known as the "Round City". The original design shows a single ring of residential and commercial structures along the inside of the city walls, but the final construction added another ring inside the first. Within the city there were many parks, gardens, villas, and promenades. In the center of the city lay the <a href="mosque">mosque</a>, as well as headquarters for guards. The purpose or use of the remaining space in the center is unknown. The circular design of the city was a direct reflection of the traditional Persian Sasanian <a href="urban%20planning">urban design</a>. The Sasanian city of <a href="Firuzabad%2C%20Fars">Gur</a> in <a href="Fars%20Province">Fars</a>, built 500 years before Baghdad, is nearly identical in its general circular design, radiating avenues, and the government buildings and temples at the centre of the city. This style of urban planning contrasted with Ancient <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Roman</a> urban planning, in which cities are designed as squares or rectangles with streets intersecting each other at right angles.

The four surrounding walls of Baghdad were named <a href="Kufa">Kufa</a>, <a href="Basra">Basra</a>, <a href="Greater%20Khorasan">Khurasan</a>, and <a href="Syria">Syria</a>; named because their gates pointed in the directions of these destinations. The distance between these gates was a little less than . Each gate had double doors that were made of iron; the doors were so heavy it took several men to open and close them. The wall itself was about 44 m thick at the base and about 12 m thick at the top. Also, the wall was 30 m high, which included <a href="merlon">merlon</a>s, a solid part of an embattled parapet usually pierced by <a href="embrasure">embrasure</a>s. This wall was surrounded by another wall with a thickness of 50 m. The second wall had towers and rounded merlons, which surrounded the towers. This outer wall was protected by a solid <a href="glacis">glacis</a>, which is made out of bricks and <a href="quicklime">quicklime</a>. Beyond the outer wall was a water-filled moat.

The Golden Gate Palace, the residence of the caliph and his family, was in the middle of Baghdad, in the central square. In the central part of the building, there was a green dome that was 39 m high. Surrounding the palace was an <a href="esplanade">esplanade</a>, a waterside building, in which only the caliph could come riding on horseback. In addition, the palace was near other mansions and officer's residences. Near the Gate of Syria, a building served as the home for the guards. It was made of brick and marble. The palace governor lived in the latter part of the building and the commander of the guards in the front. In 813, after the death of caliph <a href="Al-Amin">Al-Amin</a>, the palace was no longer used as the home for the caliph and his family.
The roundness points to the fact that it was based on <a href="Arabic%20script">Arabic script</a>. The two designers who were hired by <a href="Al-Mansur">Al-Mansur</a> to plan the city's design were <a href="Naubakht">Naubakht</a>, a Zoroastrian who also determined that the date of the foundation of the city would be astrologically auspicious, and <a href="Mashallah%20ibn%20Athari">Mashallah</a>, a Jew from <a href="Khorasan%20Province">Khorasan</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>.

The Abbasid Caliphate was based on their being the descendants of the uncle of <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> and being part of the <a href="Quraysh%20%28tribe%29">Quraysh</a> tribe. They used <a href="Shi%27a">Shi'a</a> resentment, <a href="Greater%20Khorasan">Khorasan</a>ian movement, and appeals to the ambitions and traditions of the newly conquered Persian aristocracy to overthrow the <a href="Umayyads">Umayyads</a>.
The Abbasids sought to combine the hegemony of the <a href="Arabs">Arab</a> tribes with the imperial, court, ceremonial, and administrative structures of the Persians. The Abbasids considered themselves the inherittures and the need of Mansur to place the capital in a place that was representative of Arab-Islamic identity by building the <a href="House%20of%20Wisdom">House of Wisdom</a>, where ancient texts were translated from their original language, such as Greek, to Arabic. Mansur is credited with the "<a href="Translation%20Movement">Translation Movement</a>" for this. Further, Baghdad is also near the ancient Sassanid imperial seat of <a href="Ctesiphon">Ctesiphon</a> on the Tigris River.

Within a generation of its founding, Baghdad became a hub of <a href="learning">learning</a> and <a href="commerce">commerce</a>. The <a href="House%20of%20Wisdom">House of Wisdom</a> was an establishment dedicated to the translation of <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, <a href="Middle%20Persian">Middle Persian</a> and <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a> works. Scholars headed to Baghdad from all over the <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a>, facilitating the introduction of Persian, Greek and <a href="Science%20and%20technology%20in%20ancient%20India">Indian science</a> into the Arabic and Islamic world at that time. Baghdad was likely the <a href="Historical%20urban%20community%20sizes">largest city in the world</a> from shortly after its foundation until the 930s, when it was tied by <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Andalusia">Córdoba</a>.
Several estimates suggest that the city contained over a million inhabitants at its peak. Many of the "<a href="One%20Thousand%20and%20One%20Nights">One Thousand and One Nights</a>" tales are set in Baghdad during this period.

Among the notable features of Baghdad during this period were its exceptional libraries. Many of the Abbasid caliphs were patrons of learning and enjoyed collecting both ancient and contemporary literature. Although some of the princes of the previous Umayyad dynasty had begun to gather and translate Greek scientific literature, the Abbasids were the first to foster Greek learning on a large scale. Many of these libraries were private collections intended only for the use of the owners and their immediate friends, but the libraries of the caliphs and other officials soon took on a public or a semi-public character. Four great libraries were established in Baghdad during this period. The earliest was that of the famous Al Mamun, who was caliph from 813 to 833. Another was established by Sabur Ibn Ardashir in 991 or 993 for the literary men and scholars who frequented his academy. Unfortunately, this second library was plundered and burned by the Seljuks only seventy years after it was established. This was a good example of the sort of library built up out of the needs and interests of a literary society. The last two were examples of "madrasa" or theological college libraries. The Nizamiyah was founded by the Persian Nizam al Mulk, who was vizier of two early Seljuk sultans. It continued to operate even after the coming of the Mongols in 1258. The Mustansiriyah "madrasa", which owned an exceedingly rich library, was founded by Al Mustansir, the second last Abbasid caliph, who died in 1242. This would prove to be the last great library built by the caliphs of Baghdad.

By the 10th century, the city's population was between 1.2 million and 2 million. Baghdad's early meteoric growth eventually slowed due to troubles within the <a href="Caliphate">Caliphate</a>, including relocations of the capital to <a href="Abbasid%20Samarra">Samarra</a> (during 808–819 and 836–892), the loss of the western and easternmost provinces, and periods of political domination by the <a href="Iran">Iran</a>ian <a href="Buwayhid">Buwayhid</a>s (945–1055) and <a href="Seljuk%20Turks">Seljuk Turks</a> (1055–1135).

The <a href="Seljuks">Seljuks</a> were a clan of the <a href="Oghuz%20Turks">Oghuz Turks</a> from the Central Asia that converted to the <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a> branch of Islam. In 1040, they destroyed the <a href="Ghaznavids">Ghaznavids</a>, taking over their land and in 1055, <a href="Tughril%20Beg">Tughril Beg</a>, the leader of the Seljuks, took over Baghdad. The Seljuks expelled the <a href="Buyid%20dynasty">Buyid dynasty</a> of Shiites that ruled for some time and took over power and control of Baghdad. They ruled as <a href="Sultans">Sultans</a> in the name of the Abbasid caliphs (they saw themselves as being part of the Abbasid regime). Tughril Beg saw himself as the protector of the Abbasid Caliphs.

Wars in which Baghdad was involved are listed below:


In 1058, Baghdad was captured by the <a href="Fatimids">Fatimids</a> under the Turkish general <a href="Abu%27l-%E1%B8%A4%C4%81rith%20Arsl%C4%81n%20al-Basasiri">Abu'l-Ḥārith Arslān al-Basasiri</a>, an adherent of the <a href="Ismailis">Ismailis</a> along with the 'Uqaylid Quraysh. Not long before the arrival of the Saljuqs in Baghdad, al-Basasiri petitioned to the Fatimid Imam-Caliph <a href="Al-Mustansir%20Billah">al-Mustansir</a> to support him in conquering Baghdad on the Ismaili Imam's behalf. It has recently come to light that the famed Fatimid "<a href="da%27i">da'i</a>", <a href="al-Mu%27ayyad%20al-Shirazi">al-Mu'ayyad al-Shirazi</a>, had a direct role in supporting al-Basasiri and helped the general to succeed in taking <a href="Mosul">Mawṣil</a>, <a href="Wasit%2C%20Iraq">Wāsit</a> and <a href="Kufa">Kufa</a>. Soon after, by December 1058, a Shi'i "<a href="adh%C4%81n">adhān</a>" (call to prayer) was implemented in Baghdad and a "<a href="khutbah">khutbah</a>" (sermon) was delivered in the name of the Fatimid Imam-Caliph. Despite his Shi'i inclinations, Al-Basasiri received support from Sunnis and Shi'is alike, for whom opposition to the Saljuq power was a common factor.
On 10 February 1258, Baghdad was captured by the <a href="Mongols">Mongols</a> led by <a href="Hulegu">Hulegu</a>, a grandson of Chingiz Khan (<a href="Genghis%20Khan">Genghis Khan</a>), during the <a href="Siege%20of%20Baghdad%20%281258%29">siege of Baghdad</a>. Many quarters were ruined by fire, siege, or looting. The Mongols massacred most of the city's inhabitants, including the caliph <a href="Al-Musta%27sim">Al-Musta'sim</a>, and destroyed large sections of the city. The <a href="canal">canal</a>s and <a href="Levee">dykes</a> forming the city's <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a> system were also destroyed. During this time, in Baghdad, Christians and Shia were tolerated, while Sunnis were treated as enemies. The sack of Baghdad put an end to the Abbasid Caliphate, a blow from which the Islamic civilization never fully recovered.

At this point, Baghdad was ruled by the <a href="Ilkhanate">Ilkhanate</a>, a breakaway state of the Mongol Empire, ruling from Iran. In 1401, Baghdad was again sacked, by the Central Asian Turkic conqueror <a href="Timur">Timur</a> ("Tamerlane"). When his forces took Baghdad, he spared almost no one, and ordered that each of his soldiers bring back two severed human heads. It became a provincial capital controlled by the Mongol <a href="Jalayirid">Jalayirid</a> (1400–1411), Turkic <a href="Kara%20Koyunlu">Kara Koyunlu</a> (1411–1469), Turkic <a href="White%20Sheep%20Turkmen">Ak Koyunlu</a> (1469–1508), and the Iranian <a href="Safavid">Safavid</a> (1508–1534) dynasties.

In 1534, Baghdad was captured by the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Turks</a>. Under the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottomans</a>, Baghdad continued into a period of decline, partially as a result of the enmity between its rulers and Iranian Safavids, which did not accept the Sunni control of the city. <a href="Ottoman%E2%80%93Safavid%20War%20%281623%E2%80%931639%29">Between 1623 and 1638</a>, it returned to Iranian rule before falling back into Ottoman hands.

Baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the <a href="plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a> and <a href="cholera">cholera</a>, and sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped out.

For a time, Baghdad had been the largest city in the Middle East. The city saw relative revival in the latter part of the 18th century under a <a href="Mamluk%20dynasty%20of%20Iraq">Mamluk</a> government. Direct Ottoman rule was reimposed by <a href="Ali%20R%C4%B1za%20Pasha%20%28governor%20of%20Baghdad%29">Ali Rıza Pasha</a> in 1831. From 1851 to 1852 and from 1861 to 1867, Baghdad was governed, under the Ottoman Empire by <a href="Mehmed%20Nam%C4%B1k%20Pasha">Mehmed Namık Pasha</a>. The <a href="Nuttall%20Encyclopedia">Nuttall Encyclopedia</a> reports the 1907 population of Baghdad as 185,000.

Baghdad and southern Iraq remained under Ottoman rule until 1917, when captured by the British during World War I. In 1920, Baghdad became the capital of the <a href="British%20Mandate%20of%20Mesopotamia">British Mandate of Mesopotamia</a> and after receiving independence in 1932, the capital of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Iraq">Kingdom of Iraq</a>. The city's population grew from an estimated 145,000 in 1900 to 580,000 in 1950. During the Mandate, Baghdad's substantial <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Iraq">Jewish community</a> comprised a quarter of the city's population.

On 1 April 1941, members of the "Golden Square" and <a href="Rashid%20Ali">Rashid Ali</a> staged <a href="1941%20Iraqi%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">a coup in Baghdad</a>. Rashid Ali installed a pro-<a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> and pro-<a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italian</a> government to replace the pro-British government of <a href="Regent">Regent</a> <a href="%27Abd%20al-Ilah">Abdul Ilah</a>. On 31 May, after the resulting <a href="Anglo-Iraqi%20War">Anglo-Iraqi War</a> and after Rashid Ali and his government had fled, the Mayor of Baghdad surrendered to British and Commonwealth forces.

On 14 July 1958, members of the <a href="Iraqi%20Army">Iraqi Army</a>, under <a href="Abd%20al-Karim%20Qasim">Abd al-Karim Qasim</a>, <a href="14%20July%20Revolution">staged a coup to topple the Kingdom of Iraq</a>. King <a href="Faisal%20II">Faisal II</a>, former Prime Minister <a href="Nuri%20as-Said">Nuri as-Said</a>, former Regent Prince <a href="%27Abd%20al-Ilah">'Abd al-Ilah</a>, members of the royal family, and others were brutally killed during the coup. Many of the victim's bodies were then dragged through the streets of Baghdad.
During the 1970s, Baghdad experienced a period of prosperity and growth because of a sharp increase in the <a href="price%20of%20petroleum">price of petroleum</a>, Iraq's main export. New infrastructure including modern sewerage, water, and highway facilities were built during this period. The masterplans of the city (1967, 1973) were delivered by the Polish planning office Miastoprojekt-Kraków, mediated by Polservice. However, the <a href="Iran%E2%80%93Iraq%20War">Iran–Iraq War</a> of the 1980s was a difficult time for the city, as money was diverted by <a href="Saddam%20Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> to the army and thousands of residents were killed. Iran launched a number of missile attacks against Baghdad in retaliation for Saddam Hussein's continuous bombardments of Tehran's residential districts.

In 1991 and 2003, the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a> and the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a> caused <a href="Damage%20to%20Baghdad%20during%20the%20Iraq%20War">significant damage</a> to Baghdad's transportation, <a href="Electricity%20generation">power</a>, and sanitary infrastructure as the US-led coalition forces launched massive aerial assaults in the city in the two wars. Also in 2003, the minor riot in the city (which took place on 21 July) caused some disturbance in the population.

The historic "Assyrian Quarter" of the city, Dora, which boasted a population of 150,000 Assyrians in 2003, made up over 3% of the capital's Assyrian population then. The community has been subject to kidnappings, death threats, vandalism, and house burnings by <a href="Alqaida">Alqaida</a> and other insurgent groups. As of the end of 2014, only 1,500 Assyrians remained in Dora.

Points of interest include the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Iraq">National Museum of Iraq</a> whose priceless collection of artifacts was looted during the 2003 invasion, and the iconic Hands of Victory arches. Multiple Iraqi parties are in discussions as to whether the arches should remain as historical monuments or be dismantled. Thousands of ancient manuscripts in the <a href="Iraq%20National%20Library%20and%20Archive">National Library</a> were destroyed under <a href="Saddam">Saddam</a>'s command.

Mutanabbi Street (Arabic: شارع المتنبي) is located near the old quarter of Baghdad; at Al Rasheed Street. It is the historic center of Baghdadi book-selling, a street filled with bookstores and outdoor book stalls. It was named after the 10th-century classical Iraqi poet <a href="Al-Mutanabbi">Al-Mutanabbi</a>. This street is well established for bookselling and has often been referred to as the heart and soul of the Baghdad literacy and intellectual community.

The <a href="zoological%20park">zoological park</a> used to be the largest in the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. Within eight days following the 2003 invasion, however, only 35 of the 650 animals in the facility survived. This was a result of theft of some animals for human food, and starvation of caged animals that had no food. <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>n <a href="Lawrence%20Anthony">Lawrence Anthony</a> and some of the zoo keepers cared for the animals and fed the carnivores with <a href="donkey">donkey</a>s they had bought locally. Eventually, <a href="L.%20Paul%20Bremer">L. Paul Bremer</a>, Director of the <a href="Coalition%20Provisional%20Authority">Coalition Provisional Authority</a> in Iraq from 11 May 2003 to 28 June 2004 ordered protection of the zoo and U.S. engineers helped to reopen the facility.

Al-Kadhimiyyah Mosque is a shrine that is located in the <a href="Kadhimiyyah">Kādhimayn suburb</a> of Baghdad. It contains the tombs of the seventh and ninth <a href="Twelver">Twelver</a> <a href="Imamah%20%28Shia%20doctrine%29">Shi'ite Imam</a>s, <a href="Musa%20al-Kadhim">Musa al-Kadhim</a> and <a href="Muhammad%20at-Taqi">Muhammad at-Taqi</a> respectively, upon whom the title of "Kāẓimayn" (, "Two who swallow their anger") was bestowed. Many Shi'ites travel to the mosque from far away places to commemorate.

Just as Kadhimiyyah is a predominantly Shi'ite neighborhood with a Mosque that is associated with Shi'ite <a href="Imam">Imam</a>s, <a href="A%27dhamiyyah">A'dhamiyyah</a> is a predominantly Sunni area with a Mosque that is associated with the Sunni Imam Abu Hanifah. The name of "Al-A‘ẓamiyyah" () is derived from Abu Hanifah's title, "al-Imām al-A‘ẓam" (, the Great Imam).

The city is located on a vast plain bisected by the <a href="River%20Tigris">River Tigris</a>. The Tigris splits Baghdad in half, with the eastern half being called "<a href="Al-Rusafa%2C%20Iraq">Risafa</a>" and the Western half known as "<a href="Karkh">Karkh</a>". The land on which the city is built is almost entirely flat and low-lying, being of <a href="alluvium">alluvial</a> origin due to the periodic large floods which have occurred on the river.

Baghdad has a subtropical <a href="desert%20climate">desert climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> "BWh"). In the summer from June to August, the average maximum temperature is as high as accompanied by blazing sunshine: rainfall has in fact been recorded on fewer than half a dozen occasions at this time of year and has never exceeded . Even at night temperatures in summer are seldom below . Baghdad's record highest temperature of 124 degrees Fahrenheit (51 degrees Celsius) was reached in July 2015. The <a href="humidity">humidity</a> is typically under 50% in summer due to Baghdad's distance from the marshy southern Iraq and the coasts of <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>, and <a href="dust%20storm">dust storm</a>s from the deserts to the west are a normal occurrence during the summer.

Winters boast temperatures typical of <a href="subtropics">subtropical climate</a>s. From December to February, Baghdad has maximum temperatures averaging , though highs above are not unheard of. The average January low is but lows below freezing occur only a couple of times per year on average.

Annual rainfall, almost entirely confined to the period from November to March, averages around , but has been as high as and as low as . On 11 January 2008, light snow fell across Baghdad for the first time in memory.

Administratively, Baghdad Governorate is divided into <a href="Kaza">districts</a> which are further divided into <a href="nahiyah">sub-districts</a>. Municipally, the governorate is divided into 9 municipalities, which have responsibility for local issues. Regional services, however, are coordinated and carried out by a mayor who oversees the municipalities. There is no single <a href="city%20council">city council</a> that singularly governs Baghdad at a municipal level. The governorate council is responsible for the governorate-wide policy.

These official subdivisions of the city served as administrative centres for the delivery of municipal services but until 2003 had no political function. Beginning in April 2003, the U.S. controlled <a href="Coalition%20Provisional%20Authority">Coalition Provisional Authority</a> (CPA) began the process of creating new functions for these. The process initially focused on the election of neighbourhood councils in the official neighbourhoods, elected by neighbourhood caucuses.

The CPA convened a series of meetings in each neighbourhood to explain local government, to describe the caucus election process and to encourage participants to spread the word and bring friends, relatives and neighbours to subsequent meetings. Each neighbourhood process ultimately ended with a final meeting where candidates for the new neighbourhood councils identified themselves and asked their neighbours to vote for them.

Once all 88 (later increased to 89) neighbourhood councils were in place, each neighbourhood council elected representatives from among their members to serve on one of the city's nine district councils. The number of neighbourhood representatives on a district council is based upon the neighbourhood's population. The next step was to have each of the nine district councils elect representatives from their membership to serve on the 37 member Baghdad City Council. This three tier system of local government connected the people of Baghdad to the central government through their representatives from the neighbourhood, through the district, and up to the city council.

The same process was used to provide representative councils for the other communities in Baghdad Province outside of the city itself. There, local councils were elected from 20 neighbourhoods (Nahia) and these councils elected representatives from their members to serve on six district councils (Qada). As within the city, the district councils then elected representatives from among their members to serve on the 35 member Baghdad Regional Council.

The first step in the establishment of the system of local government for Baghdad Province was the election of the Baghdad Provincial Council. As before, the representatives to the Provincial Council were elected by their peers from the lower councils in numbers proportional to the population of the districts they represent. The 41 member Provincial Council took office in February 2004 and served until national elections held in January 2005, when a new Provincial Council was elected.

This system of 127 separate councils may seem overly cumbersome; however, Baghdad Province is home to approximately seven million people. At the lowest level, the neighbourhood councils, each council represents an average of 75,000 people.

The nine District Advisory Councils (DAC) are as follows:


The nine districts are subdivided into 89 smaller neighborhoods which may make up sectors of any of the districts above. The following is a "selection" (rather than a complete list) of these neighborhoods:
Baghdad's population was estimated at 7.22 million in 2015. The city historically had a predominantly <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a> population, by the early 21st century around 82% of the city's population were <a href="Shia%20Islam%20in%20Iraq">Iraqi Shia</a>. At the beginning of the 21st century, some 1.5 million people migrated to Baghdad, most of them Shiites and a few Sunnis.

As early as 2003, about 20 percent of the population of the city was the result of mixed marriages between Shi'ites and Sunnis: they are often referred to as "Sushis". Following <a href="Sectarian%20violence%20in%20Iraq%20%282006%E2%80%9307%29">ethnic cleansing campaigns</a> by Sunni and then Shia militia groups during the U.S. occupation of Iraq the city's population became overwhelmingly Shia and despite the government's promise to resettle Sunnis displaced by the violence, little has been done to bring this about. The <a href="Iraqi%20Civil%20War%20%282014%E2%80%93present%29">Iraqi Civil War following ISIS' invasion</a> in 2014 caused hundreds of thousands of Iraqi internally displaced people to flee to the city. The city currently has Shia, Sunni, <a href="Assyrian%20Christian">Assyrian Christian</a> and mixed neighborhoods but is the world's second largest Shia city after <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a>.

Baghdad accounts for 22.2 per cent of Iraq's population and 40 per cent of the country's gross domestic product (PPP). <a href="Iraqi%20Airways">Iraqi Airways</a>, the national airline of Iraq, has its headquarters on the grounds of <a href="Baghdad%20International%20Airport">Baghdad International Airport</a> in Baghdad. <a href="Al-Naser%20Airlines">Al-Naser Airlines</a> has its head office in <a href="Karrada">Karrada</a>, Baghdad.

Most <a href="Reconstruction%20of%20Iraq">Iraqi reconstruction</a> efforts have been devoted to the restoration and repair of badly damaged urban infrastructure. More visible efforts at reconstruction through private development, like architect and urban designer <a href="Hisham%20N.%20Ashkouri">Hisham N. Ashkouri</a>'s <a href="Reconstruction%20of%20Iraq%23The%20Proposed%20Baghdad%20Baghdad%20is%20mizz%20Renaissance%20Plan">Baghdad Renaissance Plan</a> and the <a href="Sindbad%20Hotel%20Complex%20and%20Conference%20Center">Sindbad Hotel Complex and Conference Center</a> have also been made.

The Baghdad Eye, a tall <a href="Ferris%20wheel">Ferris wheel</a>, was proposed for Baghdad in August 2008. At that time, three possible locations had been identified, but no estimates of cost or completion date were given.<ref name="msnbc.msn.com/id/26425911"></ref> In October 2008, it was reported that Al-Zawraa Park was expected to be the site, and a wheel was installed there in March 2011.

Iraq's Tourism Board is also seeking investors to develop a "romantic" island on the River Tigris in Baghdad that was once a popular honeymoon spot for newlywed Iraqis. The project would include a six-star hotel, spa, an 18-hole golf course and a country club. In addition, the go-ahead has been given to build numerous architecturally unique skyscrapers along the Tigris that would develop the city's financial centre in Kadhehemiah.

In October 2008, the <a href="Baghdad%20Metro">Baghdad Metro</a> resumed service. It connects the center to the southern neighborhood of <a href="Dora%2C%20Baghdad">Dora</a>.
In May 2010, a new residential and commercial project nicknamed <a href="Baghdad%20Gate">Baghdad Gate</a> was announced. This project not only addresses the urgent need for new residential units in Baghdad but also acts as a real symbol of progress in the war torn city, as Baghdad has not seen projects of this scale for decades.




The <a href="Mustansiriya%20Madrasah">Mustansiriya Madrasah</a> was established in 1227 by the Abbasid Caliph al-Mustansir. The name was changed to <a href="Al-Mustansiriya%20University">Al-Mustansiriya University</a> in 1963. The <a href="University%20of%20Baghdad">University of Baghdad</a> is the largest university in Iraq and the second largest in the Arab world.

Prior to the Gulf War multiple <a href="international%20schools">international schools</a> operated in Baghdad, including:


Baghdad has always played a significant role in the broader <a href="Arab%20culture">Arab cultural sphere</a>, contributing several significant writers, musicians and visual artists. Famous <a href="Arab">Arab</a> poets and singers such as <a href="Nizar%20Qabbani">Nizar Qabbani</a>, <a href="Umm%20Kulthum">Umm Kulthum</a>, <a href="Fairuz">Fairuz</a>, <a href="Salah%20Al-Hamdani">Salah Al-Hamdani</a>, <a href="Ilham%20al-Madfai">Ilham al-Madfai</a> and others have performed for the city.

The dialect of <a href="Baghdad%20Arabic">Arabic spoken in Baghdad</a> today differs from that of other large urban centres in Iraq, having features more characteristic of nomadic Arabic dialects (Verseegh, "The Arabic Language"). It is possible that this was caused by the repopulating of the city with rural residents after the multiple sacks of the late <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>.

For poetry written about Baghdad, see <a href="Reuven%20Snir">Reuven Snir</a> (ed.), "Baghdad: The City in Verse" (Harvard, 2013)<a href="http%3A//www.hup.harvard.edu/features/baghdad/"></a>

Some of the important cultural institutions in the city include:

The live theatre scene received a boost during the 1990s, when UN <a href="Economic%20sanctions">sanctions</a> limited the import of foreign films. As many as 30 movie theatres were reported to have been converted to live stages, producing a wide range of <a href="Comedy">comedies</a> and dramatic productions.

Institutions offering cultural education in Baghdad include <a href="The%20Music%20and%20Ballet%20School%20of%20Baghdad">The Music and Ballet School of Baghdad</a> and the <a href="Institute%20of%20Fine%20Arts%20Baghdad">Institute of Fine Arts Baghdad</a>. Baghdad is also home to a number of museums which housed <a href="Artifact%20%28archaeology%29">artifacts</a> and relics of <a href="ancient%20civilization">ancient civilization</a>; many of these were stolen, and the museums looted, during the widespread chaos immediately after United States forces entered the city.

During the <a href="History%20of%20Iraq%20%282003%E2%80%9311%29">2003 occupation of Iraq</a>, <a href="AFN%20Iraq">AFN Iraq</a> ("Freedom Radio") broadcast news and entertainment within Baghdad, among other locations. There is also a private radio station called "Dijlah" (named after the Arabic word for the Tigris River) that was created in 2004 as Iraq's first independent talk radio station. Radio Dijlah offices, in the <a href="Jamia">Jamia</a> neighborhood of Baghdad, have been attacked on several occasions.

Baghdad is home to some of the most successful <a href="Association%20football">football (soccer)</a> teams in Iraq, the biggest being <a href="Al-Shorta%20SC">Al-Shorta</a> (Police), <a href="Al-Quwa%20Al-Jawiya">Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya</a> (Airforce club), <a href="Al-Zawra%27a%20SC">Al-Zawra'a</a>, and <a href="Talaba%20SC">Talaba</a> (Students). The largest stadium in Baghdad is <a href="Al-Shaab%20Stadium">Al-Shaab Stadium</a>, which was opened in 1966. Another, but much larger stadium, is still in the opening stages of construction.

The city has also had a strong tradition of <a href="horse%20racing">horse racing</a> ever since <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, known to Baghdadis simply as 'Races'. There are reports of pressures by the Islamists to stop this tradition due to the associated gambling.

British thermal unit

The British thermal unit (Btu or BTU) is a traditional unit of <a href="heat">heat</a>; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one <a href="pound%20%28mass%29">pound</a> of water by one degree <a href="Fahrenheit">Fahrenheit</a>. It is part of the <a href="United%20States%20customary%20units">United States customary units</a>. Its counterpart in the <a href="metric%20system%20">metric system </a> is the <a href="calorie">calorie</a>, which is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree <a href="Celsius">Celsius</a>. Heat is now known to be equivalent to energy, for which the <a href="SI">SI</a> unit is the <a href="joule">joule</a>; one BTU is about 1055 joules. While units of heat are often supplanted by energy units in scientific work, they are still important in many fields. As examples, in the United States the <a href="Natural%20gas%20prices">price of natural gas</a> is quoted in dollars per million BTUs.

A BTU was originally defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 <a href="avoirdupois">avoirdupois</a> pound of liquid water by 1 degree Fahrenheit at a constant pressure of one <a href="atmosphere%20%28unit%29">atmosphere</a>. There are several different definitions of the BTU that are now known to differ slightly. This reflects the fact that the temperature change of a mass of water due to the addition of a specific amount of heat (calculated in energy units, usually joules) depends slightly upon the water's initial temperature. As seen in the table below, definitions of the BTU based on different water temperatures vary by up to 0.5%. In the table, thermochemical and steam table (IT) values, which are now defined in terms of exact values in joules, have been rounded to four decimal places.
Units KBtu are used in building energy use tracking and heating system sizing. Energy Use Index (EUI) represents KBtu per square foot of conditioned floor area. K is metric system units for 1,000. 

The units MBtu and MMBtu are used in the natural gas and other industries to indicate 1,000 and 1,000,000 BTUs, respectively. This is presumably from the <a href="Roman%20numerals">Roman numeral system</a>, where "M" stands for one thousand (1,000). However, Roman Numeral MM represents two thousand, adding confusion if the Roman system is cited as the source for MM.

There is an ambiguity in that the metric system uses the prefix "M" to indicate one million (1,000,000), and "MBtu" is also used to indicate one million BTUs. Because of this ambiguity, some authors have deprecated the use of the unit Btu. 

Energy analysts accustomed to the metric "k" for 1,000 are more likely to use MBtu to represent one million, especially in documents where M represents one million in other energy or cost units, such as MW, MWh and $.

The unit "<a href="therm">therm</a>" is used to represent 100,000 (or 10) BTUs. A decatherm is 10 therms or one MBtu. The unit "<a href="quad%20%28unit%29">quad</a>" is commonly used to represent one quadrillion (10) BTUs.

One Btu is approximately:

A Btu can be approximated as the heat produced by burning a single wooden kitchen match or as the amount of energy it takes to lift a weight .


When used as a unit of <a href="Power%20%28physics%29">power</a> for heating and cooling systems, Btu "per hour" (Btu/h) is the correct unit, though this is often abbreviated to just "Btu".



The Btu should not be confused with the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade%20Unit">Board of Trade Unit</a> (B.O.T.U.), which is a much larger quantity of energy ().

The Btu is often used to express the conversion-efficiency of heat into electrical energy in power plants. Figures are quoted in terms of the quantity of heat in Btu required to generate 1 kW·h of electrical energy. A typical coal-fired power plant works at 10,500 Btu/kW·h, an efficiency of 32–33%.

The centigrade heat unit (CHU) is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree <a href="Celsius">Celsius</a>. It is equal to 1.8 BTU or 1899 joules. This unit was sometimes used in the United Kingdom as an alternative to BTU but is now obsolete.

Bugatti

Automobiles Ettore Bugatti was a French car <a href="automotive%20industry">manufacturer</a> of <a href="high%20performance%20vehicle">high-performance automobiles</a>, founded in 1909 in the then <a href="German%20Empire">German</a> city of <a href="Molsheim">Molsheim</a>, <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a> by <a href="Italy">Italian</a>-born <a href="Ettore%20Bugatti">Ettore Bugatti</a>. Bugatti cars were known for their design beauty (Ettore Bugatti was from a family of artists and considered himself to be both an artist and constructor) and for their many race victories. Famous Bugattis include the <a href="Bugatti%20Type%2035">Type 35 Grand Prix</a> cars, the <a href="Bugatti%20Royale">Type 41 "Royale"</a>, the <a href="Bugatti%20Type%2057">Type 57 "Atlantic"</a> and the <a href="Bugatti%20Type%2055">Type 55</a> sports car.

The death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 proved to be the end for the <a href="marque">marque</a>, and the death of his son <a href="Jean%20Bugatti">Jean Bugatti</a> in 1939 ensured there was not a successor to lead the factory. No more than about 8,000 cars were made. The company struggled financially, and released one last model in the 1950s, before eventually being purchased for its airplane parts business in the 1960s. 

In the 1990s, an Italian entrepreneur revived it as a builder of limited production exclusive <a href="sports%20car">sports car</a>s. Today, the name is owned by German automobile manufacturing group <a href="Volkswagen%20Group">Volkswagen</a>.

Founder Ettore Bugatti was born in <a href="Milan">Milan</a>, Italy, and the automobile company that bears his name was founded in 1909 in Molsheim located in the Alsace region which was part of the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> from 1871 to 1919. The company was known both for the level of detail of its engineering in its automobiles, and for the artistic manner in which the designs were executed, given the artistic nature of Ettore's family (his father, Carlo Bugatti (1856–1940), was an important <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> furniture and jewelry designer).

During the <a href="First%20World%20War">war</a> Ettore Bugatti was sent away, initially to Milan and later to Paris, but as soon as hostilities had been concluded he returned to his factory at Molsheim. Less than four months after the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles%20%281919%29">Versailles Treaty</a> formalised the transfer of Alsace from Germany to France, Bugatti was able to obtain, at the last minute, a stand at the <a href="Paris%20Motor%20Show">15th Paris motor show</a> in October 1919. He exhibited three light cars, all of them closely based on their pre-war equivalents, and each fitted with the same <a href="ohc">overhead camshaft</a> 4-cylinder 1,368cc engine with four valves per cylinder. Smallest of the three was a "<a href="Bugatti%20Type%2013">Type 13</a>" with a racing body (constructed by Bugatti themselves) and using a chassis with a wheelbase. The others were a "<a href="Bugatti%20Type%2013%23Type%2022">Type 22</a>" and a "<a href="Bugatti%20Type%2013%23Type%2023">Type 23</a>" with wheelbases of respectively.

The company also enjoyed great success in early <a href="Grand%20Prix%20motor%20racing">Grand Prix motor racing</a>: in 1929 a privately entered <a href="Bugatti%20Type%2035%23Type%2035B">Bugatti</a> won the first ever <a href="Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a>. Racing success culminated with driver <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Wimille">Jean-Pierre Wimille</a> winning the <a href="24%20hours%20of%20Le%20Mans">24 hours of Le Mans</a> twice (in 1937 with <a href="Robert%20Benoist">Robert Benoist</a> and 1939 with <a href="Pierre%20Veyron">Pierre Veyron</a>).

Bugatti cars were extremely successful in racing. The little <a href="Bugatti%20Type%2010">Bugatti Type 10</a> swept the top four positions at its first race. The 1924 <a href="Bugatti%20Type%2035">Bugatti Type 35</a> is probably the most successful racing car of all time, with over 2,000 wins. The Type 35 was developed by Bugatti with master engineer and racing driver <a href="Jean%20Chassagne">Jean Chassagne</a> who also drove it in the car’s first ever Grand Prix in 1924 Lyon. Bugattis swept to victory in the <a href="Targa%20Florio">Targa Florio</a> for five years straight from 1925 through 1929. <a href="Louis%20Chiron">Louis Chiron</a> held the most podiums in Bugatti cars, and the modern marque revival Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. named the 1999 <a href="Bugatti%2018/3%20Chiron">Bugatti 18/3 Chiron</a> concept car in his honour. But it was the final racing success at Le Mans that is most remembered—Jean-Pierre Wimille and Pierre Veyron won the 1939 race with just one car and meagre resources.

In the 1930s, Ettore Bugatti got involved in the creation of a racer <a href="airplane">airplane</a>, hoping to beat the Germans in the <a href="Deutsch%20de%20la%20Meurthe%20prize">Deutsch de la Meurthe prize</a>. This would be the <a href="Bugatti%20Model%20100">Bugatti 100P</a>, which never flew. It was designed by Belgian engineer <a href="Louis%20de%20Monge">Louis de Monge</a> who had already applied Bugatti Brescia engines in his "Type 7.5" lifting body.

Ettore Bugatti also designed a successful motorised railcar, the "" (<a href="https%3A//translate.google.com/translate%3Fjs%3Dn%26amp%3Bprev%3D_t%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF-8%26amp%3Blayout%3D2%26amp%3Beotf%3D1%26amp%3Bsl%3Dfr%26amp%3Btl%3Den%26amp%3Bu%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Ffr.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252FAutorail_Bugatti">Autorail Bugatti</a>).

The death of Ettore Bugatti's son, <a href="Jean%20Bugatti">Jean Bugatti</a>, on 11 August 1939 marked a turning point in the company's fortunes. Jean died while testing a <a href="Bugatti%20Type%2057%23Type%2057S%20Tank">Type 57 tank-bodied race car</a> near the Molsheim factory.

<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> left the Molsheim factory in ruins and the company lost control of the property. During the war, Bugatti planned a new factory at Levallois, a northwestern suburb of Paris. After the war, Bugatti designed and planned to build a series of new cars, including the Type 73 road car and Type 73C single seat racing car, but in all Bugatti built only five Type 73 cars.

Development of a 375 cc supercharged car was stopped when Ettore Bugatti died on 21 August 1947. Following Ettore Bugatti's death, the business declined further and made its last appearance as a business in its own right at a <a href="Paris%20Motor%20Show">Paris Motor Show</a> in October 1952.

After a long decline, the original incarnation of Bugatti ceased operations in 1952.

Bugattis are noticeably focused on design. <a href="Engine%20block">Engine block</a>s were <a href="hand%20scraper">hand scraped</a> to ensure that the surfaces were so flat that gaskets were not required for sealing, many of the exposed surfaces of the engine compartment featured "<a href="guilloch%C3%A9">guilloché</a>" (engine turned) finishes on them, and safety wires had been threaded through almost every fastener in intricately laced patterns. Rather than bolt the springs to the <a href="axle">axle</a>s as most manufacturers did, Bugatti's axles were forged such that the spring passed though a carefully sized opening in the axle, a much more elegant solution requiring fewer parts. He famously described his arch competitor <a href="Bentley">Bentley</a>'s cars as "the world's fastest lorries" for focusing on durability. According to Bugatti, "weight was the enemy".

Relatives of Harold Carr found a rare 1937 Bugatti Type 57S Atalante when cataloguing the doctor's belongings after his death in 2009. Carr's Type 57S is notable because it was originally owned by British race car driver Earl Howe. Because much of the car's original equipment is intact, it can be restored without relying on replacement parts.

On 10 July 2009, a 1925 Bugatti Brescia Type 22 which had lain at the bottom of <a href="Lake%20Maggiore">Lake Maggiore</a> on the border of Switzerland and Italy for 75 years was recovered from the lake. The Mullin Museum in <a href="Oxnard%2C%20California">Oxnard, California</a> bought it at auction for $351,343 at Bonham's <a href="R%C3%A9tromobile">Rétromobile</a> sale in Paris in 2010.

The company attempted a comeback under Roland Bugatti in the mid-1950s with the <a href="mid-engine%20design">mid-engined</a> <a href="Bugatti%20Type%20251">Type 251</a> race car. Designed with help from <a href="Gioacchino%20Colombo">Gioacchino Colombo</a>, the car failed to perform to expectations and the company's attempts at automobile production were halted.

In the 1960s, <a href="Virgil%20Exner">Virgil Exner</a> designed a Bugatti as part of his "<a href="Exner%20Revival%20Cars">Revival Cars</a>" project. A show version of this car was actually built by <a href="Ghia">Ghia</a> using the last <a href="Bugatti%20Type%20101">Bugatti Type 101</a> chassis, and was shown at the 1965 <a href="Turin%20Motor%20Show">Turin Motor Show</a>. Finance was not forthcoming, and Exner then turned his attention to a revival of <a href="Stutz%20Motor%20Company">Stutz</a>.

Bugatti continued manufacturing airplane parts and was sold to <a href="Hispano-Suiza">Hispano-Suiza</a>, also a former auto maker turned aircraft supplier, in 1963. <a href="Snecma">Snecma</a> took over Hispano-Suiza in 1968. After acquiring <a href="Messier-Bugatti-Dowty">Messier</a>, Snecma merged Messier and Bugatti into Messier-Bugatti in 1977.

Italian entrepreneur <a href="Romano%20Artioli">Romano Artioli</a> acquired the Bugatti brand in 1987, and established Bugatti Automobili S.p.A.. Artioli commissioned architect Giampaolo Benedini to design the factory which was built in <a href="Campogalliano">Campogalliano</a>, Modena, Italy. Construction of the plant began in 1988, alongside the development of the first model, and it was inaugurated two years later—in 1990.

By 1989 the plans for the new Bugatti revival were presented by Paolo Stanzani and <a href="Marcello%20Gandini">Marcello Gandini</a>, designers of the <a href="Lamborghini%20Miura">Lamborghini Miura</a> and <a href="Lamborghini%20Countach">Lamborghini Countach</a>. The first production vehicle was the <a href="Bugatti%20EB110">Bugatti EB110 GT</a>. It used a <a href="carbon-fibre-reinforced%20polymer">carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer</a> chassis, a 3.5-litre, 5-valve per cylinder, quad-<a href="Turbocharger">turbocharged</a> 60° <a href="V12%20engine">V12 engine</a>, a six-speed <a href="gearbox">gearbox</a>, and <a href="four-wheel%20drive">four-wheel drive</a>.

Famed racing car designer <a href="Mauro%20Forghieri">Mauro Forghieri</a> served as Bugatti's technical director from 1992 through 1994.

On 27 August 1993, through his holding company, ACBN Holdings S.A. of <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>, Romano Artioli purchased <a href="Lotus%20Cars">Lotus Cars</a> from <a href="General%20Motors%20Corporation">General Motors</a>. Plans were made to list Bugatti shares on international stock exchanges.

Bugatti presented a prototype large saloon called the <a href="Bugatti%20EB%20112">EB112</a> in 1993.

Perhaps the most famous Bugatti EB110 owner was seven-time <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">Formula One World Champion</a> racing driver <a href="Michael%20Schumacher">Michael Schumacher</a> who purchased an EB110 in 1994. Schumacher sold his EB110, which had been repaired after a severe 1994 crash, to Modena Motorsport, a Ferrari service and race preparation garage in Germany.

By the time the EB110 came to market, the North American and European economies were in recession. Poor economic conditions forced the company to fail and operations ceased in September 1995. A model specific to the US market called the "Bugatti America" was in the preparatory stages when the company ceased operations.

Bugatti's liquidators sold Lotus Cars to <a href="Proton%20%28carmaker%29">Proton</a> of Malaysia. German firm <a href="Dauer%20Racing">Dauer Racing</a> purchased the EB110 licence and remaining parts stock in 1997 in order to produce five more EB110 SS vehicles. These five SS versions of the EB110 were greatly refined by Dauer. The Campogalliano factory was sold to a furniture-making company, which subsequently collapsed before moving in, leaving the building unoccupied. After Dauer stopped producing cars in 2011, Toscana-Motors GmbH of Germany purchased the remaining parts stock from Dauer.

<a href="Volkswagen%20AG">Volkswagen AG</a> acquired the Bugatti brand in 1998. Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. commissioned <a href="Giorgetto%20Giugiaro">Giorgetto Giugiaro</a> of <a href="ItalDesign">ItalDesign</a> to produce Bugatti Automobiles's first concept vehicle, the <a href="Bugatti%20EB118">EB118</a>, a <a href="coup%C3%A9">coupé</a> that debuted at the 1998 <a href="Paris%20Auto%20Show">Paris Auto Show</a>. The EB118 concept featured a , W-18 engine. After its Paris debut, the <a href="Bugatti%20EB%20118">EB118</a> concept was shown again in 1999 at the <a href="Geneva%20Auto%20Show">Geneva Auto Show</a> and the <a href="Tokyo%20Motor%20Show">Tokyo Motor Show</a>. Bugatti introduced its next concepts, the <a href="Bugatti%20EB218">EB 218</a> at the 1999 <a href="Geneva%20Motor%20Show">Geneva Motor Show</a> and the <a href="Bugatti%2018/3%20Chiron">18/3 Chiron</a> at the 1999 <a href="Frankfurt%20Motor%20Show">Frankfurt Motor Show</a> (IAA).

Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. began assembling its first regular-production vehicle, the <a href="Bugatti%20Veyron">Bugatti Veyron 16.4</a> (the 1001 BHP super car with an 8-litre W-16 engine with four turbochargers) in September 2005 at the Bugatti <a href="Molsheim">Molsheim</a>, France assembly "studio". On 23 February 2015, Bugatti sold its last Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse, which was named La Finale.

The <a href="Bugatti%20Chiron">Bugatti Chiron</a> is a <a href="mid-engine%20design">mid-engined</a>, two-seated sports car, designed by Achim Anscheidt, developed as the successor to the <a href="Bugatti%20Veyron">Bugatti Veyron</a>. The Chiron was first revealed at the <a href="Geneva%20Motor%20Show">Geneva Motor Show</a> on March 1, 2016.

Black Death

The Black Death was one of the most devastating <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a>s in <a href="History%20of%20the%20world">human history</a>, resulting in the deaths of an estimated people in Eurasia and peaking in <a href="Europe">Europe</a> in the years 1346–1353.<ref name="ABC/Reuters"></ref> Although there were several competing theories as to the cause of the Black Death, analyses of <a href="DNA">DNA</a> from people in northern and southern Europe published in 2010 and 2011 indicate that the <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a> responsible was the "<a href="Yersinia%20pestis">Yersinia pestis</a>" <a href="bacterium">bacterium</a>, resulting in several forms of <a href="Plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a>, including the <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a>.

The Black Death is thought to have originated in the arid plains of <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>, where it then travelled along the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a>, reaching <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a> by 1343. From there, it was most likely carried by <a href="Oriental%20rat%20flea">Oriental rat flea</a>s living on the <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a>s that were regular passengers on <a href="cargo%20ship">merchant ships</a>. Spreading throughout the <a href="Mediterranean%20Basin">Mediterranean</a> and Europe, the Black Death is estimated to have killed 30–60% of <a href="Demographics%20of%20Europe">Europe's total population</a>. In total, the plague may have reduced the <a href="world%20population">world population</a> from an estimated 450 million down to 350–375 million in the 14th century. The world population as a whole did not recover to pre-plague levels until the 17th century. The plague recurred occasionally in Europe until the 19th century.

The plague created a series of religious, social, and economic upheavals, which had profound effects on the course of <a href="History%20of%20Europe">European history</a>.

The plague disease, caused by "<a href="Yersinia%20pestis">Yersinia pestis</a>", is <a href="enzootic">enzootic</a> (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s, including <a href="marmot">marmot</a>s, in various areas including <a href="Central%20Asia">Central Asia</a>, <a href="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a>, <a href="Western%20Asia">Western Asia</a>, <a href="North%20India">Northern India</a> and <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>. <a href="Nestorianism">Nestorian</a> graves dating to 1338–1339 near <a href="Issyk%20Kul">Lake Issyk Kul</a> in <a href="Kyrgyzstan">Kyrgyzstan</a> have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which it could easily have spread to China and India. In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China. In China, the 13th-century <a href="Mongol%20invasion%20of%20China">Mongol conquest</a> caused a decline in farming and trading. However, economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th century. In the 1330s, a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after. Epidemics that may have included plague killed an estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians during the 15 years before it reached <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in 1347.

The disease may have travelled along the <a href="Silk%20Road">Silk Road</a> with <a href="Mongols">Mongol</a> armies and traders or it could have come via ship. By the end of 1346, reports of plague had reached the seaports of Europe: "India was depopulated, <a href="Tartary">Tartary</a>, <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> were covered with dead bodies".

Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe via <a href="Republic%20of%20Genoa">Genoese</a> traders at the port city of <a href="Feodosia">Kaffa</a> in the <a href="Crimea">Crimea</a> in 1347. After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under <a href="Jani%20Beg">Jani Beg</a> was suffering from the disease, the army catapulted the infected corpses over the <a href="Defensive%20wall">city walls</a> of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants. The Genoese traders fled, taking the plague by ship into <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> and the south of Europe, whence it spread north. Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death.

There appear to have been several introductions into Europe. The plague reached Sicily in October 1347, carried by twelve Genoese galleys, and rapidly spread all over the island. Galleys from <a href="Feodosia">Kaffa</a> reached Genoa and Venice in January 1348, but it was the outbreak in <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a> a few weeks later that was the entry point to northern Italy. Towards the end of January, one of the galleys expelled from Italy arrived in <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a>.

From Italy, the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking France, Spain, Portugal and England by June 1348, then turned and spread east through Germany and Scandinavia from 1348 to 1350. It was introduced in Norway in 1349 when a ship landed at <a href="Ask%C3%B8y">Askøy</a>, then spread to Bjørgvin (modern <a href="Bergen">Bergen</a>) and <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>. Finally it spread to northwestern Russia in 1351. The plague was somewhat less common in parts of Europe that had smaller trade relations with their neighbours, including the majority of the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29">Basque Country</a>, isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands, and isolated alpine villages throughout the continent.

Modern researchers do not think that the plague ever became endemic in Europe or its rat population. The disease repeatedly wiped out the rodent carriers so that the fleas died out until a new outbreak from Central Asia repeated the process. The outbreaks have been shown to occur roughly 15 years after a warmer and wetter period in areas where plague is endemic in other species such as <a href="gerbils">gerbils</a>.

The plague struck various regions in the Middle East during the <a href="pandemic">pandemic</a>, leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures. As it spread to western Europe, the disease entered the region from southern Russia also. By autumn 1347, the plague reached <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in Egypt, probably through the port's trade with <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, and ports on the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>. During 1347, the disease travelled eastward to <a href="Gaza%20City">Gaza</a>, and north along the eastern coast to cities in <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>, including <a href="Ashkelon">Ashkelon</a>, <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Acre</a>, <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, <a href="Sidon">Sidon</a>, <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>, <a href="Homs">Homs</a>, and <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>. In 1348–1349, the disease reached <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>. The city's residents fled to the north, most of them dying during the journey, but the infection had been spread to the people of <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>.

<a href="Mecca">Mecca</a> became infected in 1349. During the same year, records show the city of <a href="Mosul">Mawsil</a> (Mosul) suffered a massive epidemic, and the city of <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> experienced a second round of the disease. In 1351 <a href="Yemen">Yemen</a> experienced an outbreak of the plague, coinciding with the return of <a href="Rasulid%20dynasty">Sultan al-Mujahid Ali</a> of Yemen from imprisonment in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>. His party may have brought the disease with them from Egypt.

Contemporary accounts of the plague are often varied or imprecise. The most commonly noted symptom was the appearance of <a href="bubo">bubo</a>es (or gavocciolos) in the groin, the neck and armpits, which oozed pus and bled when opened. <a href="Boccaccio">Boccaccio</a>'s description is graphic:

The only medical detail that is questionable in Boccaccio's description is that the gavocciolo was an 'infallible token of approaching death', as, if the bubo discharges, recovery is possible.

This was followed by acute fever and vomiting of blood. Most victims died two to seven days after initial infection. Freckle-like spots and rashes, which could have been caused by flea-bites, were identified as another potential sign of the plague.

Some accounts, like that of <a href="Lodewijk%20Heyligen">Lodewijk Heyligen</a>, whose master the <a href="Giovanni%20Colonna%20%28cardinal%2C%201295%E2%80%931348%29">Cardinal Colonna</a> died of the plague in 1348, noted a distinct form of the disease that infected the lungs and led to respiratory problems and is identified with <a href="pneumonic%20plague">pneumonic plague</a>.

Medical knowledge had stagnated during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. The most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in Paris in a report to the <a href="Philip%20VI%20of%20France">king of France</a> that blamed the heavens, in the form of a <a href="Conjunction%20%28astronomy%29">conjunction</a> of three planets in 1345 that caused a "great pestilence in the air". This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to sufferers. That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory. Today, this is known as the <a href="miasma%20theory">miasma theory</a>. The word "plague" had no special significance at this time, and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the Middle Ages gave it the name that has become the medical term.

The importance of hygiene was recognised only in the nineteenth century; until then it was common that the streets were filthy, with live animals of all sorts around and human parasites abounding. A transmissible disease will spread easily in such conditions. One development as a result of the Black Death was the establishment of the idea of <a href="quarantine">quarantine</a> in <a href="Dubrovnik">Dubrovnik</a> in 1377 after continuing outbreaks.

The dominant explanation for the Black Death is the <a href="Plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a> theory, which attributes the outbreak to "<a href="Yersinia%20pestis">Yersinia pestis</a>", also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865, eventually spreading to India. The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist <a href="Alexandre%20Yersin">Alexandre Yersin</a>, after whom the pathogen was named "Yersinia pestis". The mechanism by which "Y. pestis" was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by <a href="Paul-Louis%20Simond">Paul-Louis Simond</a> and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose <a href="midgut">midgut</a>s had become obstructed by replicating "Y. pestis" several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by <a href="vomiting">regurgitation</a>, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease <a href="Endemic%20%28epidemiology%29">endemic</a>, and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human <a href="Epidemic%20typhus">epidemic</a>.

The historian <a href="Francis%20Aidan%20Gasquet">Francis Aidan Gasquet</a> wrote about the Great Pestilence in 1893 and suggested that "it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague". He was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the Black Death for the second edition in 1908, implicating rats and fleas in the process, and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics, such as the <a href="Justinian%20plague">Justinian plague</a> that was prevalent in the <a href="Eastern%20Roman%20Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a> from 541 to 700 CE.

An estimate of the <a href="mortality%20rate">mortality rate</a> for the modern <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a>, following the introduction of antibiotics, is 11% (by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC)), although it may be much higher in economically or medically underdeveloped regions. Symptoms of the disease include fever of , headaches, painful aching joints, <a href="nausea">nausea</a> and vomiting, and a general feeling of <a href="malaise">malaise</a>. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 per cent die within eight days. <a href="Pneumonic%20plague">Pneumonic plague</a> has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 per cent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged <a href="sputum">sputum</a>. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free-flowing and bright red. <a href="Septicemic%20plague">Septicemic plague</a> is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (<a href="purpura">purpura</a> due to <a href="disseminated%20intravascular%20coagulation">disseminated intravascular coagulation</a>). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.

A number of alternative theories – implicating other diseases in the Black Death pandemic – have also been proposed by some modern scientists (see below – "Alternative Explanations").

In October 2010, the open-access scientific journal "<a href="PLoS%20Pathogens">PLoS Pathogens</a>" published a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of "<a href="Yersinia%20pestis">Yersinia pestis</a>" in the Black Death following the disputed identification by Drancourt and Raoult in 1998. They assessed the presence of DNA/RNA with <a href="polymerase%20chain%20reaction">polymerase chain reaction</a> (PCR) techniques for "Y. pestis" from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in northern, central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences. The authors concluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany, "ends the debate about the cause of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that "Y. pestis" was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages".

The study also found that there were two previously unknown but related <a href="clade">clade</a>s (genetic branches) of the "Y. pestis" <a href="genome">genome</a> associated with medieval mass graves. These clades (which are thought to be extinct) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern "Y. pestis" strains "Y. p. orientalis" and "Y. p. medievalis", suggesting the plague may have entered Europe in two waves. Surveys of <a href="plague%20pit">plague pit</a> remains in France and England indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three epidemics. Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of <a href="Bergen%20op%20Zoom">Bergen op Zoom</a> showed the "Y. pestis" genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a> from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague, different from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the <a href="Hanseatic%20League">Hanseatic</a> cities or another site.

The results of the Haensch study have since been confirmed and amended. Based on genetic evidence derived from Black Death victims in the <a href="East%20Smithfield">East Smithfield</a> burial site in England, Schuenemann et al. concluded in 2011 "that the Black Death in medieval Europe was caused by a variant of "Y. pestis" that may no longer exist." A study published in "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" in October 2011 sequenced the genome of "Y. pestis" from plague victims and indicated that the strain that caused the Black Death is ancestral to most modern strains of the disease.

DNA taken from 25 skeletons from the 14th century found in London have shown the plague is a strain of "Y. pestis" that is almost identical to that which hit Madagascar in 2013.

The plague theory was first significantly challenged by the work of British bacteriologist J. F. D. Shrewsbury in 1970, who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague, leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations. In 1984 zoologist Graham Twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly, and his doubts about the identity of the Black Death have been taken up by a number of authors, including Samuel K. Cohn, Jr. (2002 and 2013), <a href="David%20Herlihy">David Herlihy</a> (1997), and Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan (2001).

It is recognised that an <a href="epidemiological">epidemiological</a> account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms, but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period. Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a> and the year 1377. Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy.

In addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance; and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples from other mass graves. Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague—which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.

McCormick has suggested that earlier archaeologists were simply not interested in the "laborious" processes needed to discover rat remains. Walløe complains that all of these authors "take it for granted that Simond's infection model, black rat → rat flea → human, which was developed to explain the spread of plague in India, is the only way an epidemic of "Yersinia pestis" infection could spread", whilst pointing to several other possibilities. Similarly, Green has argued that greater attention is needed to the range of (especially non-<a href="commensalism">commensal</a>) animals that might be involved in the transmission of plague.

A variety of alternatives to the "Y. pestis" have been put forward. Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a>, and <a href="Norman%20Cantor">Norman Cantor</a> (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that they characterise as "hemorrhagic" plague similar to <a href="Ebola">Ebola</a>. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the "Y. pestis" was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the "Y. pestis" as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including <a href="typhus">typhus</a>, <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of "blood poisoning") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, scientists with <a href="Public%20Health%20England">Public Health England</a> announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.

There are no exact figures for the <a href="infectious%20disease%23Historic%20pandemics">death toll</a>; the rate varied widely by locality. In urban centres, the greater the population before the outbreak, the longer the duration of the period of abnormal mortality. It killed some people in <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>. According to medieval historian <a href="Philip%20Daileader">Philip Daileader</a> in 2007:

The trend of recent research is pointing to a figure more like 45–50% of the European population dying during a four-year period. There is a fair amount of geographic variation. In Mediterranean Europe, areas such as Italy, the south of France and Spain, where plague ran for about four years consecutively, it was probably closer to 75–80% of the population. In Germany and England ... it was probably closer to 20%.

A death rate as high as 60% in Europe has been suggested by Norwegian historian Ole Benedictow:

Detailed study of the mortality data available points to two conspicuous features in relation to the mortality caused by the Black Death: namely the extreme level of mortality caused by the Black Death, and the remarkable similarity or consistency of the level of mortality, from Spain in southern Europe to England in north-western Europe. The data is sufficiently widespread and numerous to make it likely that the Black Death swept away around 60 per cent of Europe's population. It is generally assumed that the size of Europe's population at the time was around 80 million. This implies that around 50 million people died in the Black Death.

The most widely accepted estimate for the Middle East, including Iraq, Iran and Syria, during this time, is for a death rate of about a third. The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypt's population. Half of Paris's population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of <a href="Florence">Florence</a> was reduced from 110,000–120,000 inhabitants in 1338 down to 50,000 in 1351. At least 60% of the population of <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> and <a href="Bremen">Bremen</a> perished, and a similar percentage of <a href="London">London</a>ers may have died from the disease as well. While contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion. Monks and priests were especially hard-hit since they cared for victims of the Black Death.

Renewed religious fervour and fanaticism bloomed in the wake of the Black Death. Some Europeans targeted "various groups such as Jews, friars, foreigners, beggars, pilgrims", lepers, and <a href="Romani%20people">Romani</a>, thinking that they were to blame for the crisis. <a href="Leprosy">Lepers</a>, and other individuals with skin diseases such as <a href="Acne%20vulgaris">acne</a> or <a href="psoriasis">psoriasis</a>, were singled out and exterminated throughout Europe.

Because 14th-century healers were at a loss to explain the cause, Europeans turned to astrological forces, earthquakes, and the poisoning of wells by Jews as possible reasons for the plague's emergence. The governments of Europe had no apparent response to the crisis because no one knew its cause or how it spread. The mechanism of infection and transmission of diseases was little understood in the 14th century; many people believed only God's anger could produce such horrific displays.

There were many attacks against <a href="Jews%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">Jewish</a> communities. In February 1349, the citizens of <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a> murdered 2,000 Jews. In August 1349, the Jewish communities in <a href="Mainz">Mainz</a> and <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> were exterminated. By 1351, 60 major and 150 smaller Jewish communities had been destroyed.

The plague repeatedly returned to haunt Europe and the Mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries. According to Biraben, the plague was present somewhere in Europe in every year between 1346 and 1671. The was particularly widespread in the following years: 1360–1363; 1374; 1400; 1438–1439; 1456–1457; 1464–1466; 1481–1485; 1500–1503; 1518–1531; 1544–1548; 1563–1566; 1573–1588; 1596–1599; 1602–1611; 1623–1640; 1644–1654; and 1664–1667. Subsequent outbreaks, though severe, marked the retreat from most of Europe (18th century) and northern Africa (19th century). According to Geoffrey Parker, "<a href="Early%20Modern%20France">France</a> alone lost almost a million people to the plague in the epidemic of 1628–31."

In England, in the absence of census figures, historians propose a range of preincident population figures from as high as 7 million to as low as 4 million in 1300, and a postincident population figure as low as 2 million. By the end of 1350, the Black Death subsided, but it never really died out in England. Over the next few hundred years, further outbreaks occurred in 1361–1362, 1369, 1379–1383, 1389–1393, and throughout the first half of the 15th century. An outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10–15% of the population, while the death rate of the plague of 1479–1480 could have been as high as 20%. The most general outbreaks in <a href="Tudor%20dynasty">Tudor</a> and <a href="House%20of%20Stuart">Stuart</a> England seem to have begun in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589, 1603, 1625, and 1636, and ended with the <a href="Great%20Plague%20of%20London">Great Plague of London</a> in 1665.

In 1466, perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in Paris. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 and 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>'s population died in 1623–1625, and again in 1635–1636, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in <a href="Venice">Venice</a> 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576–1577 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the <a href="Italian%20Plague%20of%201629%E2%80%931631">Italian Plague of 1629–1631</a>, which is associated with troop movements during the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>, and the <a href="Great%20Plague%20of%20Vienna">Great Plague of Vienna</a> in 1679. Over 60% of Norway's population died in 1348–1350. The last plague outbreak ravaged <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a> in 1654.

In the first half of the 17th century, a plague claimed some 1.7 million victims in Italy, or about 14% of the population. In 1656, the plague killed about half of <a href="Naples">Naples</a>' 300,000 inhabitants. More than 1.25 million deaths resulted from the extreme incidence of plague in 17th-century <a href="Habsburg%20Spain">Spain</a>. The <a href="Great%20Plague%20of%20Seville">plague of 1649</a> probably reduced the population of <a href="Seville">Seville</a> by half. In 1709–1713, a <a href="The%20plague%20during%20the%20Great%20Northern%20War">plague epidemic that followed the Great Northern War</a> (1700–1721, <a href="Swedish%20Empire">Sweden</a> v. Russia and allies) killed about 100,000 in Sweden, and 300,000 in Prussia. The plague killed two-thirds of the inhabitants of <a href="Helsinki">Helsinki</a>, and claimed a third of <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>'s population. Europe's last major epidemic occurred in 1720 in <a href="Great%20Plague%20of%20Marseille">Marseille</a>.

The Black Death ravaged much of the <a href="Islamic%20world">Islamic world</a>. Plague was present in at least one location in the Islamic world virtually every year between 1500 and 1850. Plague repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a> lost 30 to 50 thousand inhabitants to it in 1620–1621, and again in 1654–1657, 1665, 1691, and 1740–1742. Plague remained a major event in <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> society until the second quarter of the 19th century. Between 1701 and 1750, thirty-seven larger and smaller epidemics were recorded in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, and an additional thirty-one between 1751 and 1800. <a href="Baghdad">Baghdad</a> has suffered severely from visitations of the plague, and sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped out.

The third plague pandemic (1855–1859) started in China in the mid-19th century, spreading to all inhabited continents and killing 10 million people in India alone. Twelve plague outbreaks in Australia between 1900 and 1925 resulted in well over 1,000 deaths, chiefly in Sydney. This led to the establishment of a Public Health Department there which undertook some leading-edge research on plague transmission from rat fleas to humans via the bacillus "Yersinia pestis".

The first North American plague epidemic was the <a href="San%20Francisco%20plague%20of%201900%E2%80%931904">San Francisco plague of 1900–1904</a>, followed by another outbreak in 1907–1908. From 1944 through 1993, 362 cases of human plague were reported in the United States; approximately 90% occurred in four western states: Arizona, California, Colorado, and New Mexico.

Modern treatment methods include <a href="insecticide">insecticide</a>s, the use of <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s, and a <a href="Waldemar%20Haffkine%23Anti-plague%20vaccine">plague vaccine</a>. The <a href="Plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a> bacterium could develop <a href="drug%20resistance">drug resistance</a> and again become a major health threat. One case of a drug-resistant form of the bacterium was found in <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> in 1995. A further outbreak in Madagascar was reported in November 2014.

The 12th-century French physician <a href="Gilles%20de%20Corbeil">Gilles de Corbeil</a>'s "On the Signs and Symptoms of Diseases" () uses the phrase "black death" (') to refer to a pestilential fever (').

Writers contemporary with the plague referred to the event as the or the 

The phrase (') was used in 1350 by Simon de Covino or Couvin, a Belgian astronomer, who wrote the poem "On the Judgment of the Sun at a Feast of Saturn" ('), which attributes the plague to a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn. In 1908, Gasquet claimed that use of the name ' for the 14th-century epidemic first appeared in a 1631 book on Danish history by <a href="Johan%20Isaksson%20Pontanus">J. I. Pontanus</a>: "Commonly and from its effects, they called it the black death" ('). The name spread through Scandinavia and then Germany, gradually becoming attached to the mid 14th-century epidemic as a proper name. In England, it was not until 1823, that the medieval epidemic was first called the Black Death.

Biotechnology

Biotechnology is the use of living systems and organisms to develop or make products, or "any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use" (UN Convention on Biological Diversity, Art. 2). Depending on the tools and applications, it often overlaps with the (related) fields of <a href="bioengineering">bioengineering</a>, <a href="biomedical%20engineering">biomedical engineering</a>, <a href="biomanufacturing">biomanufacturing</a>, <a href="molecular%20engineering">molecular engineering</a>, etc.

For thousands of years, humankind has used biotechnology in <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>, <a href="food%20production">food production</a>, and <a href="medicine">medicine</a>. The term is largely believed to have been coined in 1919 by Hungarian <a href="engineer">engineer</a> <a href="K%C3%A1roly%20Ereky">Károly Ereky</a>. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, biotechnology has expanded to include new and diverse <a href="science">science</a>s such as <a href="genomics">genomics</a>, <a href="recombinant%20gene">recombinant gene</a> techniques, applied <a href="immunology">immunology</a>, and development of <a href="pharmaceutical">pharmaceutical</a> therapies and <a href="diagnostic%20tests">diagnostic tests</a>.

The wide concept of "biotech" or "biotechnology" encompasses a wide range of procedures for modifying living organisms according to human purposes, going back to <a href="domestication">domestication</a> of animals, cultivation of the plants, and "improvements" to these through breeding programs that employ <a href="artificial%20selection">artificial selection</a> and <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridization</a>. Modern usage also includes <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a> as well as <a href="cell%20culture">cell</a> and <a href="tissue%20culture">tissue culture</a> technologies. The <a href="American%20Chemical%20Society">American Chemical Society</a> defines biotechnology as the application of biological organisms, systems, or processes by various industries to learning about the science of life and the improvement of the value of materials and organisms such as pharmaceuticals, crops, and livestock. As per <a href="European%20Federation%20of%20Biotechnology">European Federation of Biotechnology</a>, biotechnology is the integration of natural science and organisms, cells, parts thereof, and molecular analogues for products and services. Biotechnology also writes on the pure biological sciences (<a href="animal%20cell%20culture">animal cell culture</a>, <a href="biochemistry">biochemistry</a>, <a href="cell%20biology">cell biology</a>, <a href="embryology">embryology</a>, <a href="genetics">genetics</a>, <a href="microbiology">microbiology</a>, and <a href="molecular%20biology">molecular biology</a>). In many instances, it is also dependent on knowledge and methods from outside the sphere of biology including:


Conversely, modern biological sciences (including even concepts such as <a href="molecular%20ecology">molecular ecology</a>) are intimately entwined and heavily dependent on the methods developed through biotechnology and what is commonly thought of as the <a href="life%20sciences">life sciences</a> industry. Biotechnology is the <a href="research%20and%20development">research and development</a> in the <a href="laboratory">laboratory</a> using <a href="bioinformatics">bioinformatics</a> for exploration, extraction, exploitation and production from any <a href="living%20organisms">living organisms</a> and any source of <a href="biomass">biomass</a> by means of <a href="biochemical%20engineering">biochemical engineering</a> where high value-added products could be planned (reproduced by <a href="biosynthesis">biosynthesis</a>, for example), forecasted, formulated, developed, manufactured, and marketed for the purpose of sustainable operations (for the return from bottomless initial investment on R & D) and gaining durable patents rights (for exclusives rights for sales, and prior to this to receive national and international approval from the results on animal experiment and human experiment, especially on the <a href="pharmaceutical">pharmaceutical</a> branch of biotechnology to prevent any undetected side-effects or safety concerns by using the products).

By contrast, <a href="bioengineering">bioengineering</a> is generally thought of as a related field that more heavily emphasizes higher systems approaches (not necessarily the altering or using of biological materials "directly") for interfacing with and utilizing living things. Bioengineering is the application of the principles of engineering and natural sciences to tissues, cells and molecules. This can be considered as the use of knowledge from working with and manipulating biology to achieve a result that can improve functions in plants and animals. Relatedly, <a href="biomedical%20engineering">biomedical engineering</a> is an overlapping field that often draws upon and applies "biotechnology" (by various definitions), especially in certain sub-fields of biomedical or chemical engineering such as <a href="tissue%20engineering">tissue engineering</a>, bio<a href="pharmaceutical%20engineering">pharmaceutical engineering</a>, and <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a>.

Although not normally what first comes to mind, many forms of human-derived <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a> clearly fit the broad definition of "'utilizing a biotechnological system to make products". Indeed, the cultivation of plants may be viewed as the earliest biotechnological enterprise.

<a href="Agriculture">Agriculture</a> has been theorized to have become the dominant way of producing food since the <a href="Neolithic%20Revolution">Neolithic Revolution</a>. Through early biotechnology, the earliest farmers selected and bred the best suited crops, having the highest yields, to produce enough food to support a growing population. As crops and fields became increasingly large and difficult to maintain, it was discovered that specific organisms and their by-products could effectively <a href="fertilize">fertilize</a>, <a href="nitrogen%20fixation">restore nitrogen</a>, and <a href="pesticide">control pests</a>. Throughout the history of agriculture, farmers have inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to new environments and <a href="plant%20breeding">breeding</a> them with other plants — one of the first forms of biotechnology.

These processes also were included in early <a href="Fermentation%20%28biochemistry%29">fermentation</a> of <a href="beer">beer</a>. These processes were introduced in early <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, <a href="China">China</a> and <a href="India">India</a>, and still use the same basic biological methods. In <a href="brewing">brewing</a>, malted grains (containing <a href="enzymes">enzymes</a>) convert starch from grains into sugar and then adding specific <a href="yeasts">yeasts</a> to produce beer. In this process, <a href="carbohydrates">carbohydrates</a> in the grains were broken down into alcohols such as ethanol. Later other cultures produced the process of <a href="lactic%20acid%20fermentation">lactic acid fermentation</a> which allowed the fermentation and preservation of other forms of food, such as <a href="soy%20sauce">soy sauce</a>. Fermentation was also used in this time period to produce <a href="leavened%20bread">leavened bread</a>. Although the process of fermentation was not fully understood until <a href="Louis%20Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>'s work in 1857, it is still the first use of biotechnology to convert a food source into another form.

Before the time of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s work and life, animal and plant scientists had already used selective breeding. Darwin added to that body of work with his scientific observations about the ability of science to change species. These accounts contributed to Darwin's theory of natural selection.

For thousands of years, humans have used selective breeding to improve production of crops and livestock to use them for food. In selective breeding, organisms with desirable characteristics are mated to produce offspring with the same characteristics. For example, this technique was used with corn to produce the largest and sweetest crops.

In the early twentieth century scientists gained a greater understanding of <a href="microbiology">microbiology</a> and explored ways of manufacturing specific products. In 1917, <a href="Chaim%20Weizmann">Chaim Weizmann</a> first used a pure microbiological culture in an industrial process, that of manufacturing <a href="corn%20starch">corn starch</a> using "<a href="Clostridium%20acetobutylicum">Clostridium acetobutylicum</a>," to produce <a href="acetone">acetone</a>, which the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> desperately needed to manufacture <a href="explosive">explosive</a>s during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

Biotechnology has also led to the development of antibiotics. In 1928, <a href="Alexander%20Fleming">Alexander Fleming</a> discovered the mold "<a href="Penicillium">Penicillium</a>". His work led to the purification of the antibiotic compound formed by the mold by Howard Florey, Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley – to form what we today know as <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>. In 1940, penicillin became available for medicinal use to treat bacterial infections in humans.

The field of modern biotechnology is generally thought of as having been born in 1971 when Paul Berg's (Stanford) experiments in gene splicing had early success. Herbert W. Boyer (Univ. Calif. at San Francisco) and Stanley N. Cohen (Stanford) significantly advanced the new technology in 1972 by transferring genetic material into a bacterium, such that the imported material would be reproduced. The commercial viability of a biotechnology industry was significantly expanded on June 16, 1980, when the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">United States Supreme Court</a> ruled that a <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetically modified</a> <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a> could be <a href="patent">patent</a>ed in the case of "<a href="Diamond%20v.%20Chakrabarty">Diamond v. Chakrabarty</a>". Indian-born Ananda Chakrabarty, working for <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a>, had modified a bacterium (of the "<a href="Pseudomonas">Pseudomonas</a>" genus) capable of breaking down crude oil, which he proposed to use in treating oil spills. (Chakrabarty's work did not involve gene manipulation but rather the transfer of entire organelles between strains of the "Pseudomonas" bacterium.

Revenue in the industry is expected to grow by 12.9% in 2008. Another factor influencing the biotechnology sector's success is improved intellectual property rights legislation—and enforcement—worldwide, as well as strengthened demand for medical and pharmaceutical products to cope with an ageing, and ailing, U.S. population.

Rising demand for biofuels is expected to be good news for the biotechnology sector, with the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy">Department of Energy</a> estimating <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a> usage could reduce U.S. petroleum-derived fuel consumption by up to 30% by 2030. The biotechnology sector has allowed the U.S. farming industry to rapidly increase its supply of corn and soybeans—the main inputs into biofuels—by developing genetically modified seeds which are resistant to pests and drought. By boosting farm productivity, biotechnology plays a crucial role in ensuring that biofuel production targets are met.

Biotechnology has applications in four major industrial areas, including health care (medical), crop production and agriculture, non food (industrial) uses of crops and other products (e.g. <a href="biodegradable%20plastic">biodegradable plastic</a>s, <a href="vegetable%20oil">vegetable oil</a>, <a href="biofuel">biofuel</a>s), and environmental uses.

For example, one application of biotechnology is the directed use of <a href="organism">organism</a>s for the manufacture of organic products (examples include <a href="beer">beer</a> and <a href="milk">milk</a> products). Another example is using naturally present <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> by the mining industry in <a href="bioleaching">bioleaching</a>. Biotechnology is also used to recycle, treat waste, clean up sites contaminated by industrial activities (<a href="bioremediation">bioremediation</a>), and also to produce <a href="biological%20warfare">biological weapons</a>.

A series of derived terms have been coined to identify several branches of biotechnology; for example:

The investment and economic output of all of these types of applied biotechnologies is termed as "<a href="bioeconomy">bioeconomy</a>".

In medicine, modern biotechnology finds applications in areas such as <a href="pharmaceutical%20drug">pharmaceutical drug</a> discovery and production, <a href="pharmacogenomics">pharmacogenomics</a>, and genetic testing (or genetic screening).
<a href="Pharmacogenomics">Pharmacogenomics</a> (a combination of <a href="pharmacology">pharmacology</a> and <a href="genomics">genomics</a>) is the technology that analyses how genetic makeup affects an individual's response to drugs. It deals with the influence of <a href="genetics">genetic</a> variation on drug response in patients by correlating <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a> or <a href="single-nucleotide%20polymorphism">single-nucleotide polymorphism</a>s with a drug's <a href="efficacy">efficacy</a> or <a href="toxicity">toxicity</a>. By doing so, pharmacogenomics aims to develop rational means to optimize drug therapy, with respect to the patients' <a href="genotype">genotype</a>, to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal <a href="adverse%20effect%20%28medicine%29">adverse effects</a>. Such approaches promise the advent of "<a href="personalized%20medicine">personalized medicine</a>"; in which drugs and drug combinations are optimized for each individual's unique genetic makeup.

Biotechnology has contributed to the discovery and manufacturing of traditional <a href="small%20molecule">small molecule</a> <a href="pharmaceutical%20drugs">pharmaceutical drugs</a> as well as drugs that are the product of biotechnology – <a href="biopharmaceutics">biopharmaceutics</a>. Modern biotechnology can be used to manufacture existing medicines relatively easily and cheaply. The first genetically engineered products were medicines designed to treat human diseases. To cite one example, in 1978 <a href="Genentech">Genentech</a> developed synthetic humanized <a href="insulin">insulin</a> by joining its gene with a <a href="plasmid">plasmid</a> vector inserted into the bacterium "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">Escherichia coli</a>". Insulin, widely used for the treatment of diabetes, was previously extracted from the pancreas of <a href="abattoir">abattoir</a> animals (cattle or pigs). The resulting genetically engineered bacterium enabled the production of vast quantities of synthetic human insulin at relatively low cost. Biotechnology has also enabled emerging therapeutics like <a href="gene%20therapy">gene therapy</a>. The application of biotechnology to basic science (for example through the <a href="Human%20Genome%20Project">Human Genome Project</a>) has also dramatically improved our understanding of <a href="biology">biology</a> and as our scientific knowledge of normal and disease biology has increased, our ability to develop new medicines to treat previously untreatable diseases has increased as well.

<a href="Genetic%20testing">Genetic testing</a> allows the <a href="Genetics">genetic</a> <a href="medical%20diagnosis">diagnosis</a> of vulnerabilities to inherited <a href="diseases">diseases</a>, and can also be used to determine a child's parentage (genetic mother and father) or in general a person's <a href="ancestry">ancestry</a>. In addition to studying <a href="chromosomes">chromosomes</a> to the level of individual genes, genetic testing in a broader sense includes <a href="biochemical">biochemical</a> tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases, or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders. Genetic testing identifies changes in <a href="chromosomes">chromosomes</a>, genes, or proteins. Most of the time, testing is used to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders. The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a <a href="genetic%20disorder">genetic disorder</a>. As of 2011 several hundred genetic tests were in use. Since genetic testing may open up ethical or psychological problems, genetic testing is often accompanied by <a href="genetic%20counseling">genetic counseling</a>.

<a href="Genetically%20modified%20crops">Genetically modified crops</a> ("GM crops", or "biotech crops") are plants used in <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>, the <a href="DNA">DNA</a> of which has been modified with <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a> techniques. In most cases the aim is to introduce a new <a href="trait%20%28biology%29">trait</a> to the plant which does not occur naturally in the species.

Examples in food crops include resistance to certain pests, diseases, stressful environmental conditions, resistance to chemical treatments (e.g. resistance to a <a href="herbicide">herbicide</a>), reduction of spoilage, or improving the nutrient profile of the crop. Examples in non-food crops include production of <a href="Plant%20manufactured%20pharmaceuticals">pharmaceutical agent</a>s, <a href="biofuel">biofuel</a>s, and other industrially useful goods, as well as for <a href="bioremediation">bioremediation</a>.

Farmers have widely adopted GM technology. Between 1996 and 2011, the total surface area of land cultivated with GM crops had increased by a factor of 94, from to 1,600,000 km (395 million acres). 10% of the world's crop lands were planted with GM crops in 2010. As of 2011, 11 different transgenic crops were grown commercially on 395 million acres (160 million hectares) in 29 countries such as the USA, Brazil, Argentina, India, Canada, China, Paraguay, Pakistan, South Africa, Uruguay, Bolivia, Australia, Philippines, Myanmar, Burkina Faso, Mexico and Spain.

<a href="Genetically%20modified%20food">Genetically modified food</a>s are foods produced from <a href="organism">organism</a>s that have had specific changes introduced into their <a href="DNA">DNA</a> with the methods of <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a>. These techniques have allowed for the introduction of new crop traits as well as a far greater control over a food's genetic structure than previously afforded by methods such as <a href="selective%20breeding">selective breeding</a> and <a href="mutation%20breeding">mutation breeding</a>. Commercial sale of genetically modified foods began in 1994, when <a href="Calgene">Calgene</a> first marketed its <a href="Flavr%20Savr">Flavr Savr</a> delayed ripening tomato. To date most genetic modification of foods have primarily focused on <a href="cash%20crop">cash crop</a>s in high demand by farmers such as <a href="Transgenic%20soybean">soybean</a>, <a href="Transgenic%20maize">corn</a>, <a href="canola">canola</a>, and <a href="cotton%20seed%20oil">cotton seed oil</a>. These have been engineered for resistance to pathogens and herbicides and better nutrient profiles. GM livestock have also been experimentally developed, although as of November 2013 none are currently on the market.

There is a <a href="scientific%20consensus">scientific consensus</a> that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.

GM crops also provide a number of ecological benefits, if not used in excess. However, opponents have objected to GM crops per se on several grounds, including environmental concerns, whether food produced from GM crops is safe, whether GM crops are needed to address the world's food needs, and economic concerns raised by the fact these organisms are subject to intellectual property law.
Industrial biotechnology (known mainly in Europe as white biotechnology) is the application of biotechnology for industrial purposes, including <a href="industrial%20fermentation">industrial fermentation</a>. It includes the practice of using <a href="Cell%20%28biology%29">cells</a> such as <a href="micro-organisms">micro-organisms</a>, or components of cells like <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s, to generate <a href="Industry">industrially</a> useful products in sectors such as chemicals, food and feed, detergents, paper and pulp, textiles and <a href="biofuel">biofuel</a>s. In doing so, biotechnology uses renewable raw materials and may contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions and moving away from a petrochemical-based economy.

The environment can be affected by biotechnologies, both positively and adversely. Vallero and others have argued that the difference between beneficial biotechnology (e.g. <a href="bioremediation">bioremediation</a> to clean up an oil spill or hazard chemical leak) versus the adverse effects stemming from biotechnological enterprises (e.g. flow of genetic material from transgenic organisms into wild strains) can be seen as applications and implications, respectively. Cleaning up environmental wastes is an example of an application of environmental biotechnology; whereas loss of biodiversity or loss of containment of a harmful microbe are examples of environmental implications of biotechnology.

The regulation of genetic engineering concerns approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the use of <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a> technology, and the development and release of genetically modified organisms (GMO), including <a href="genetically%20modified%20crops">genetically modified crops</a> and <a href="genetically%20modified%20fish">genetically modified fish</a>. There are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering. For example, a crop not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety. The European Union differentiates between approval for cultivation within the EU and approval for import and processing. While only a few GMOs have been approved for cultivation in the EU a number of GMOs have been approved for import and processing. The cultivation of GMOs has triggered a debate about coexistence of GM and non GM crops. Depending on the coexistence regulations incentives for cultivation of GM crops differ.

In 1988, after prompting from the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a>, the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20General%20Medical%20Sciences">National Institute of General Medical Sciences</a> (<a href="National%20Institutes%20of%20Health">National Institutes of Health</a>) (NIGMS) instituted a funding mechanism for biotechnology training. Universities nationwide compete for these funds to establish <a href="Biotechnology%20Training%20Program">Biotechnology Training Program</a>s (BTPs). Each successful application is generally funded for five years then must be competitively renewed. <a href="Graduate%20students">Graduate students</a> in turn compete for acceptance into a BTP; if accepted, then stipend, tuition and health insurance support is provided for two or three years during the course of their <a href="Ph.D.">Ph.D.</a> thesis work. Nineteen institutions offer NIGMS supported BTPs. Biotechnology training is also offered at the undergraduate level and in community colleges.

Battle of Poitiers

The Battle of Poitiers was a major English victory of the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War%20%281337-60%29">Edwardian phase</a> of the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>. Fought ten years after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy">Battle of Crécy</a>, it was the second of three major English victories during the war. The third, <a href="Battle%20of%20Agincourt">Agincourt</a>, was fought in 1415.

The battle was fought on 19 September 1356 near the village of <a href="Poitiers">Poitiers</a> in <a href="Aquitaine">Aquitaine</a>, southern France. An army of English, Welsh, <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brittany">Breton</a> and <a href="Duchy%20of%20Gascony">Gascon</a> troops, many of them veterans of <a href="Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy">Crécy</a>, led by <a href="Edward%2C%20the%20Black%20Prince">Edward, the Black Prince</a>, defeated a larger French and allied army led by King <a href="John%20II%20of%20France">John II of France</a>, leading to the capture of the king, his son, and much of the French nobility.

The effect of the defeat on France was catastrophic, leaving the country in the hands of the <a href="Charles%20V%20of%20France">Dauphin Charles</a>. Charles faced <a href="Jacquerie">populist revolts across the kingdom</a> in the wake of the battle, which had destroyed the prestige of the French upper-class. The Edwardian phase of the war would end four years later in 1360, <a href="Treaty%20of%20Br%C3%A9tigny">on favourable terms for England</a>.

The town and battle were often referred to as "Poictiers" in contemporaneous recordings, a name commemorated in <a href="HMS%20Poictiers">several warships of the Royal Navy</a>.

Following the death of <a href="Charles%20IV%20of%20France">Charles IV of France</a> in 1328, Philip, Count of Valois, had been crowned as his successor, over his closest male relative and legal successor, <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III of England</a>. Edward had been reluctant to pay homage to <a href="Philip%20VI%20of%20France">Philip</a> in his role as <a href="Duke%20of%20Aquitaine">Duke of Aquitaine</a>, resulting in Philip confiscating these lands in 1337, precipitating war between the two nations. Three years later, Edward declared himself <a href="King%20of%20France">King of France</a>. The war had begun well for the English. They had achieved naval domination early in the war at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sluys">Battle of Sluys</a> in 1340, inflicted a severe defeat on the French army at <a href="Battle%20of%20Crecy">Crécy</a> in 1346, and <a href="Siege%20of%20Calais%20%281346%E2%80%9347%29">captured Calais in 1347</a>.

In the late 1340s and early 1350s, the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a> decimated the population of Western Europe, bringing all significant efforts in campaigning to a halt, one such victim being <a href="Philip%20VI%20of%20France">Philip VI of France</a> himself. In 1355, Edward III laid out plans for a second major campaign. His eldest son, <a href="Edward%2C%20the%20Black%20Prince">Edward, the Black Prince</a>, now an experienced soldier following the Crécy campaign, landed at <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> in Aquitaine, leading his army on a march through southern France to <a href="Carcassonne">Carcassonne</a>. Unable to take the heavily fortified settlement, Edward withdrew to Bordeaux. In early 1356, the <a href="Henry%20of%20Grosmont%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lancaster">Duke of Lancaster</a> led an army through <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, while Edward led his army on a great <a href="chevauch%C3%A9e">chevauchée</a> from Bordeaux on 8 August 1356.

Edward's forces met little resistance, sacking numerous settlements, until they reached the <a href="Loire%20River">Loire River</a> at <a href="Tours">Tours</a>. They were unable to take the castle or burn the town due to a heavy rainstorm. This delay allowed <a href="John%20II%20of%20France">King John II</a> to attempt to pin down and destroy Edward's army. John, who had been besieging <a href="Breteuil%2C%20Eure">Breteuil</a> in <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, organised the bulk of his army at <a href="Chartres">Chartres</a> to the north of Tours. In order to increase the speed of his army's march, he dismissed between 15,000 and 20,000 of his lower quality infantry, just as Edward turned back to Bordeaux. The French rode hard and cut in front of the English army, crossing the bridge over the Vienne at Chauvigny. Learning of this, the Black Prince quickly moved his army south. Historians disagree over whether the outnumbered English commander was seeking battle or trying to avoid it. In any case, after preliminary maneuvers and failed negotiations for a truce, the two armies faced off, both ready for battle, near <a href="Poitiers">Poitiers</a> on Monday, 19 September 1356.

Edward arrayed his army in a defensive posture among the hedges and orchards of the area, in front of the forest of Nouallie. He deployed his front line of longbowmen behind a particularly prominent thick hedge, through which the road ran at right angles. The Earl of Douglas, commanding the Scottish division in the French army, advised King John that the attack should be delivered on foot, with horses being particularly vulnerable to English arrows. John heeded this advice, leaving its baggage behind and forming up on foot in front of the English.

The English army was led by <a href="Edward%2C%20the%20Black%20Prince">Edward, the Black Prince</a>, primarily composed of English and Welsh troops, though there was a large contingent of <a href="Duchy%20of%20Gascony">Gascon</a> and <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brittany">Breton</a> soldiers with the army. Edward's army consisted of approximately 2,000 <a href="longbow">longbow</a>men, 3,000 <a href="men-at-arms">men-at-arms</a> and a force of 1,000 Gascon infantry.

Like the earlier engagement at <a href="Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy">Crécy</a>, the power of the English army lay in the <a href="longbow">longbow</a>; a tall, thick self-bow made of yew. Longbows had demonstrated their effectiveness against massed infantry and cavalry in several battles, such as; <a href="Battle%20of%20Falkirk">Falkirk</a> in 1298, <a href="Battle%20of%20Halidon%20Hill">Halidon Hill</a> in 1333 and <a href="Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy">Crécy</a> ten years prior, in 1346. Poitiers was the second of three major English victories of the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a> attributed to the longbow, though its effectiveness against armoured French knights and men-at-arms has been disputed.

<a href="Geoffrey%20the%20Baker">Geoffrey the Baker</a> wrote that the English archers under the earl of Salisbury "made their arrows prevail over the [French] knights' armor," but the bowmen on the other flank, under Warwick, were initially ineffective against the mounted French men-at-arms who enjoyed the double protection of steel plate armor and large leather shields. Once Warwick's archers redeployed to a position where they could hit the unarmored sides and backs of the horses, however, they quickly routed the cavalry force opposing them. The archers were also unquestionably effective against common infantry, who did not have the wealth to afford plate armour.

The English army was an experienced force; many archers were veterans of the earlier <a href="Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy">Battle of Crécy</a>, and two of the key commanders, <a href="John%20Chandos">Sir John Chandos</a>, and <a href="Jean%20III%20de%20Grailly%2C%20captal%20de%20Buch">Captal de Buch</a> were both experienced soldiers. The English army's divisions were led by <a href="Edward%2C%20the%20Black%20Prince">Edward, the Black Prince</a>, the <a href="Thomas%20de%20Beauchamp%2C%2011th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Earl of Warwick</a>, the <a href="William%20de%20Montagu%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">Earl of Salisbury</a>, <a href="John%20Chandos">Sir John Chandos</a> and <a href="Jean%20III%20de%20Grailly%2C%20captal%20de%20Buch">Captal de Buch</a>.

The French army was led by <a href="John%20II%20of%20France">John II of France</a>, largely comprised of native French soldiers, though there was a contingent of <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">German knights</a>, and a large force of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scottish</a> soldiers, led by the <a href="William%20Douglas%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Douglas">Earl of Douglas</a>, the latter of whom fought in the King's own division. The French army at the battle comprised approximately 8,000 men-at-arms and 3,000 common infantry, though John had made the decision to leave behind the vast majority of his infantry, numbering up to 20,000, in order to overtake and force the English to battle.

The French army was arrayed in three "battles" or divisions; the vanguard was led by the <a href="Charles%20V%20of%20France">Dauphin Charles</a>, the second by the <a href="Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Duke of Orléans</a>, while the third, the largest, was led by the King himself.

Prior to the battle, the local prelate, <a href="Cardinal%20%28Catholicism%29">Cardinal</a> <a href="H%C3%A9lie%20de%20Talleyrand-P%C3%A9rigord%20%28cardinal%29">Hélie de Talleyrand-Périgord</a> attempted to broker a truce between the two sides, as recorded in the writings of the English commander, <a href="John%20Chandos">Sir John Chandos</a>. Attending the conference on the French side was <a href="John%20II%20of%20France">John II of France</a>, the <a href="Earl%20of%20Tankerville">Count of Tankerville</a>, the Archbishop of Sens and <a href="Jean%20II%20de%20Talaru">Jean de Talaru</a>. Representing the English was the <a href="Thomas%20de%20Beauchamp%2C%2011th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Earl of Warwick</a>, the <a href="Robert%20d%27Ufford%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Suffolk">Earl of Suffolk</a>, <a href="Bartholomew%20de%20Burghersh%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Burghersh">Bartholomew de Burghersh</a>, <a href="James%20Audley">James Audley</a> and <a href="John%20Chandos">Sir John Chandos</a>. The English offered to hand over all of the war booty they had taken on their raids throughout France, as well as a seven-year truce. John, who believed his force could easily overwhelm the English, declined their proposal. John's counter suggestion that the Black Prince and his army should surrender was flatly rejected.

At the start of the battle, the English removed their <a href="Wagon%20train">baggage train</a> from the field, prompting a hasty French assault, believing that what they saw was the English retreating. The fighting began with a charge by a <a href="forlorn%20hope">forlorn hope</a> of 300 <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">German</a> knights, led by <a href="Jean%20de%20Clermont">Jean de Clermont</a>. The attack was a disaster, with many of the knights shot down or killed by English soldiery. According to <a href="Froissart%27s%20Chronicles">Froissart</a>, the English archers then shot their bows at the massed French infantry. The Dauphin's division reached the English line. Exhausted by a long march in heavy equipment and harassed by the hail of arrows, the division was repulsed after approximately two hours of combat.

The retreating vanguard collided with the advancing division of the <a href="Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Duke of Orléans</a>, throwing the French army into chaos. Seeing the Dauphin's troops falling back, Orléans' division fell back in confusion. The third, and strongest, division led by the King advanced forth, and the two withdrawing divisions coalesced and resumed their advance against the English. Believing that the retreat of the first two French divisions marked the withdrawal of the French, Edward had ordered a force under <a href="Jean%20III%20de%20Grailly%2C%20captal%20de%20Buch">Captal de Buch</a> to pursue. <a href="John%20Chandos">Sir John Chandos</a> urged the Prince to launch this force upon the main body of the French army under the King. Seizing upon this idea, Edward ordered all his men-at-arms and knights to mount for the charge, while de Buch's men, already mounted, were instructed to advance around the French left flank and rear.

As the French advanced, the English launched their charge. Stunned by the attack, the impetus carried the English and Gascon forces right into the French line. Simultaneously, de Buch's mobile reserve of mounted troops fell upon the French left flank and rear. Fearful of encirclement, the cohesion of the French army disintegrated as many soldiers attempted to flee the field. Low on arrows, the English and Welsh archers abandoned their bows and ran forward to join the melée. Around this time, King John and his son, <a href="Philip%20the%20Bold">Philip the Bold</a>, found themselves surrounded. As written by <a href="Froissart">Froissart</a>, an exiled French knight fighting with the English, Sir Denis Morbeke of Artois approached the king, requesting the King's surrender. The King is said to have replied, "To whom shall I yield me? Where is my cousin the Prince of Wales? If I might see him, I would speak with him". Denis replied; "Sir, he is not here; but yield you to me and I shall bring you to him". The king handed him his right gauntlet, saying; "I yield me to you".

Following the surrender of the King and his son Philip, the French army had broken up and left the field, ending the battle.

Following the battle, Edward resumed his march back to the English stronghold at Bordeaux. <a href="Jean%20de%20Venette">Jean de Venette</a>, a Carmelite friar, vividly describes the chaos that ensued following the battle. The demise of the French nobility at the battle, only ten years from the catastrophe at <a href="Battle%20of%20Cr%C3%A9cy">Crécy</a>, threw the kingdom into chaos. The realm was left in the hands of the <a href="Charles%20V%20of%20France">Dauphin Charles</a>, who faced <a href="Jacquerie">popular rebellion across the kingdom</a> in the wake of the defeat. Jean writes that the French nobles brutally repressed the rebellions, robbing, despoiling and pillaging the peasants' goods. <a href="Free%20company">Mercenary companies</a> hired by both sides added to the destruction, who plundered the peasants and churches.

Charles, to the misery of the French peasantry, began to raise additional funds to pay for the <a href="ransom">ransom</a> of his father, and to continue the war effort. Capitalising on the discontent in France, <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">King Edward</a> assembled his army at <a href="Calais">Calais</a> in 1359 and led his army on a campaign against <a href="Rheims">Rheims</a>. Unable to take Rheims or the French capital, <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, Edward moved his army to <a href="Chartres">Chartres</a>. Later, the Dauphin Charles offered to open negotiations, and Edward agreed.

The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Br%C3%A9tigny">Treaty of Brétigny</a> was ratified on 24 October 1360, ending the Edwardian phase of the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>. In it, Edward agreed to renounce his claims to the French throne, in exchange for full sovereign rights over an expanded Aquitaine and Calais, essentially restoring the former <a href="Angevin%20Empire">Angevin Empire</a>.

Backbone cabal

The backbone cabal was an informal organization of large-site <a href="Sysop">administrators</a> of the worldwide distributed <a href="newsgroup">newsgroup</a>-based discussion system <a href="Usenet">Usenet</a>. It existed from about 1983 at least into the 2000s.

The <a href="cabal">cabal</a> was created in an effort to facilitate reliable propagation of new Usenet posts: While in the 1970s and 1980s many news servers only operated during night time to save on the cost of long distance communication, servers of the backbone cabal were available 24 hours a day. The administrators of these servers gained sufficient influence in the otherwise anarchic Usenet community to be able to push through controversial changes, for instance the <a href="Great%20Renaming">Great Renaming</a> of <a href="Usenet">Usenet</a> newsgroups during 1987.

As Usenet has few technologically or legally enforced hierarchies, just about the only ones that formed were <a href="social%20hierarchy">social</a>. People acquired power through persuasion (both publicly and privately), public debate, force of will (often via aggressive <a href="flaming%20%28Internet%29">flames</a>), garnering authority and respect by spending much time and effort contributing to the community (by being a maintainer of a <a href="FAQ">FAQ</a>, for example; see also <a href="James%20Parry">Kibo</a>, etc.).

Credit for organizing the backbone about 1983 is commonly attributed to <a href="Gene%20Spafford">Gene "Spaf" Spafford</a>, although it is also claimed by <a href="Mary%20Ann%20Horton">Mary Ann Horton</a>. Other prominent members of the cabal were <a href="Brian%20Reid%20%28computer%20scientist%29">Brian Reid</a>, Richard Sexton, <a href="Chuq%20von%20Rospach">Chuq von Rospach</a>, Neil Crellin and <a href="Rick%20Adams%20%28Internet%20pioneer%29">Rick Adams</a>.

During most of its existence, the cabal (sometimes capitalized) steadfastly denied its own existence; those involved would often respond "There is no Cabal" (sometimes abbreviated as "TINC"), whenever the existence or activities of the group were speculated on in public. It is sometimes used humorously to dispel cabal-like organizational conspiracy theories, or as an ironic statement, indicating one who knows the existence of "the cabal" will invariably deny there is one.

This belief became a model for various conspiracy theories about various Cabals with dark nefarious objectives beginning with taking over Usenet or the Internet. <a href="Website%20spoofing">Spoofs</a> include the <a href="http%3A//catb.org/%7Eesr/ecsl/index.html">"Eric Conspiracy"</a> of moustachioed hackers named "Eric"; ex-members of the <a href="P.H.I.R.M.">P.H.I.R.M.</a>; and the <a href="Lumber%20Cartel">Lumber Cartel</a> putatively funding anti-<a href="spamming">spam</a> efforts to support the paper industry.

The result of this policy was an aura of mystery, even a decade after the cabal mailing list disbanded in late 1988 following an internal fight.

Bongo (antelope)

The bongo ("Tragelaphus eurycerus") is a <a href="Herbivore">herbivorous</a>, mostly <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a> forest <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a>. It is among the largest of the African forest <a href="antelope">antelope</a> <a href="species">species</a>.

Bongos are characterised by a striking reddish-brown coat, black and white markings, white-yellow stripes and long slightly spiralled horns. Indeed, bongos are the only <a href="Tragelaphus">tragelaphid</a> in which both sexes have horns. They have a complex social interaction and are found in African dense forest mosaics.

The western or lowland bongo, "T. e. eurycerus", faces an ongoing population decline, and the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> Antelope Specialist Group considers it to be <a href="Near%20Threatened">Near Threatened</a> on the <a href="conservation%20status">conservation status</a> scale.

The eastern or mountain bongo, "T. e. isaaci", of <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, has a coat even more vibrant than that of "T. e. eurycerus". The mountain bongo is only found in the wild in one remote region of central Kenya. This bongo is classified by the IUCN Antelope Specialist Group as <a href="Critically%20Endangered">Critically Endangered</a>, with more specimens in captivity than in the wild.

In 2000, the <a href="Association%20of%20Zoos%20and%20Aquariums">Association of Zoos and Aquariums</a> in the USA (AZA) upgraded the bongo to a Species Survival Plan participant and in 2006 added the Bongo Restoration to Mount Kenya Project to its list of the Top Ten Wildlife Conservation Success Stories of the year. However, in 2013, it seems, these successes have been negated with reports of possibly only 100 mountain bongos left in the wild due to <a href="logging">logging</a> and <a href="poaching">poaching</a>.

The <a href="scientific%20name">scientific name</a> of the bongo is "Tragelaphus eurycerus", and it belongs to the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Tragelaphus">Tragelaphus</a>" and <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Bovidae">Bovidae</a>. It was first described by Irish naturalist <a href="William%20Ogilby">William Ogilby</a> in 1837. The <a href="Generic%20name%20%28biology%29">generic name</a> "Tragelaphus" is composed of two Greek words: "tragos", meaning a male goat; and "elaphos", meaning deer. The <a href="Specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "eurycerus" originated from the fusion of "eurus" (broad, widespread) and "keras" (an animal's horn). The common name "bongo" originated probably from the <a href="Kele%20language%20%28Gabon%29">Kele</a> language of <a href="Gabon">Gabon</a>. The first known use of the name "bongo" dates back to 1861.

Bongos are further classified into two <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>: "T. e. eurycerus", the lowland or western bongo, and the far rarer "T. e. isaaci", the mountain or eastern bongo, restricted to the mountains of Kenya only. The eastern bongo is larger and heavier than the western bongo. Two other subspecies are described from West and Central Africa, but taxonomic clarification is required. They have been observed to live up to 19 years.

Bongos are found in <a href="tropical">tropical</a> <a href="jungle">jungle</a>s with dense undergrowth up to an altitude of in Central Africa, with isolated populations in <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, and these West African countries: <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a>, the <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a>, the <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Republic of the Congo</a>, the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Congo">Democratic Republic of Congo</a>, the <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a>, <a href="Equatorial%20Guinea">Equatorial Guinea</a>, <a href="Gabon">Gabon</a>, <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="Guinea">Guinea</a>, <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>, <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a>, <a href="South%20Sudan">South Sudan</a>.

Historically, bongos are found in three disjunct parts of Africa: East, Central and West. Today, all three populations’ ranges have shrunk in size due to habitat loss for agriculture and uncontrolled timber cutting, as well as <a href="hunting">hunting</a> for <a href="meat">meat</a>.

Bongos favour disturbed forest mosaics that provide fresh, low-level green vegetation. Such habitats may be promoted by heavy browsing by <a href="African%20elephant">elephants</a>, fires, flooding, tree-felling (natural or by logging), and <a href="fallowing">fallowing</a>. Mass <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a> die-off provides ideal habitat in East Africa. They can live in bamboo forests.

Bongos are one of the largest of the forest antelopes. In addition to the deep <a href="chestnut">chestnut</a> colour of their coats, they have bright white stripes on their sides to help with <a href="camouflage">camouflage</a>.

Adults of both sexes are similar in size. Adult height is about at the shoulder and length is , including a tail of . Females weigh around , while males weigh about . Its large size puts it as the third-largest in the Bovidae tribe of Strepsicerotini, behind both the <a href="common%20eland">common</a> and <a href="giant%20eland">greater eland</a>s by about , and above the greater kudu by about .

Both sexes have heavy spiral horns; those of the male are longer and more massive. All bongos in captivity are from the isolated <a href="Aberdare%20Mountains">Aberdare Mountains</a> of central <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>.

The bongo sports a bright <a href="auburn%20hair">auburn</a> or <a href="chestnut%20%28color%29">chestnut</a> coat, with the neck, chest, and legs generally darker than the rest of the body. Coats of male bongos become darker as they age until they reach a dark <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a>-brown colour. Coats of female bongos are usually more brightly coloured than those of males. The eastern bongo is darker in color than the western and this is especially pronounced in older makes which tend to be chestnut brown especially on the front part of their bodies.

The pigmentation in the coat rubs off quite easily; <a href="anecdotal">anecdotal</a> reports suggest rain running off a bongo may be tinted red with <a href="pigment">pigment</a>. The smooth coat is marked with 10–15 vertical white-yellow stripes, spread along the back from the base of the neck to the rump. The number of stripes on each side is rarely the same. It also has a short, bristly, brown ridge of dorsal hair from the shoulder to the rump; the white stripes run into this ridge.

A white chevron appears between the eyes, and two large white spots grace each cheek. Another white chevron occurs where the neck meets the chest. The large ears are to sharpen hearing, and the distinctive coloration may help bongos identify one another in their dark forest habitats. Bongos have no special secretion glands, so rely less on scent to find one another than do other similar antelopes. The lips of a bongo are white, topped with a black muzzle.

Bongos have two heavy and slightly spiralled <a href="horn%20%28anatomy%29">horns</a> that slope over their backs, and like many other <a href="antelope">antelope</a> species, both male and female bongos have horns. Bongos are the only tragelaphids in which both sexes have horns. The horns of bongos are in the form of a <a href="lyre">lyre</a> and bear a resemblance to those of the related antelope species of <a href="nyala">nyala</a>s, <a href="sitatunga">sitatunga</a>s, <a href="bushbuck">bushbuck</a>s, <a href="kudu">kudu</a>s and <a href="Taurotragus">elands</a>.

Unlike <a href="deer">deer</a>, which have branched <a href="antler">antler</a>s shed annually, bongos and other antelopes have pointed horns they keep throughout their lives. Males have massive backswept horns, while females have smaller, thinner, and more parallel horns. The size of the horns range between . The horns twist once.

Like all other horns of antelopes, the core of a bongo's horn is hollow and the outer layer of the horn is made of <a href="keratin">keratin</a>, the same material that makes up human fingernails, toenails. and hair. The bongo runs gracefully and at full speed through even the thickest tangles of <a href="liana">liana</a>s, laying its heavy spiralled horns on its back so the brush cannot impede its flight. Bongos are hunted for their horns by humans.

Like other forest <a href="ungulates">ungulates</a>, bongos are seldom seen in large groups. Males, called bulls, tend to be solitary, while females with young live in groups of six to eight. Bongos have seldom been seen in herds of more than 20. <a href="Gestation">Gestation</a> is about 285 days (9.5 months), with one young per birth, and <a href="weaning">weaning</a> occurs at six months. <a href="Sexual%20maturity">Sexual maturity</a> is reached at 24–27 months. The preferred habitat of this species is so dense and difficult to operate in, that few Europeans or Americans observed this species until the 1960s.
As young males mature and leave their maternal groups, they most often remain solitary, although rarely they join an older male. Adult males of similar size/age tend to avoid one another. Occasionally, they meet and spar with their horns in a ritualised manner and it is rare for serious fights to take place. However, such fights are usually discouraged by visual displays, in which the males bulge their necks, roll their eyes, and hold their horns in a vertical position while slowly pacing back and forth in front of the other male. They seek out females only during mating time. When they are with a herd of females, males do not coerce them or try to restrict their movements as do some other antelopes.

Although mostly <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a>, they are occasionally active during the day. However, like deer, bongos may exhibit <a href="crepuscular">crepuscular</a> behaviour. Bongos are both timid and easily frightened; after a scare, a bongo moves away at considerable speed, even through dense undergrowth. Once they find cover, they stay alert and face away from the disturbance, but peek every now and then to check the situation. The bongo's hindquarters are less conspicuous than the forequarters, and from this position the animal can quickly flee.

When in distress, the bongo emits a <a href="bleat">bleat</a>. It uses a limited number of vocalisations, mostly grunts and snorts; females have a weak mooing contact-call for their young. Females prefer to use traditional <a href="Birth">calving</a> grounds restricted to certain areas, while newborn calves lie in hiding for a week or more, receiving short visits by the mother to <a href="Breastfeeding">suckle</a>.

The calves grow rapidly and can soon accompany their mothers in the nursery herds. Their horns grow rapidly and begin to show in 3.5 months. They are weaned after six months and reach sexual maturity at about 20 months.

Like many forest <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a>s, bongos are <a href="Herbivore">herbivorous</a> browsers and feed on tree/bush <a href="Leaf">leaves</a>, <a href="Shrub">bushes</a>, <a href="vine">vine</a>s, <a href="bark">bark</a> and pith of rotting trees, <a href="grass">grass</a>es/herbs, <a href="root">root</a>s, <a href="cereal">cereal</a>s, <a href="shrub">shrub</a>s, and <a href="fruit">fruit</a>s.

Bongos require <a href="salt">salt</a> in their <a href="diet%20%28nutrition%29">diets</a>, and are known to regularly visit natural salt licks. Examination of bongo feces revealed that charcoal from trees burnt by lightning is consumed. This behavior is believed to be a means of getting salts and <a href="mineral">mineral</a>s into their diets. This behavior has also been reported in the <a href="okapi">okapi</a>. Another similarity to the okapi, though the bongo is unrelated, is that the bongo has a long <a href="prehensile">prehensile</a> tongue which it uses to grasp grasses and leaves.

Suitable habitats for bongos must have permanent water available. As a large animal, the bongo requires an ample amount of food, and is restricted to areas with abundant year-round growth of herbs and low shrubs.

Few estimates of population density are available. Assuming average population densities of 0.25 animals per km in regions where it is known to be common or abundant, and 0.02 per km elsewhere, and with a total area of occupancy of 327,000 km, a total population estimate of around 28,000 is suggested. Only about 60% are in protected areas, suggesting the actual numbers of the lowland subspecies may only be in the low tens of thousands. In Kenya, their numbers have declined significantly and on <a href="Mt.%20Kenya">Mt. Kenya</a>, they were within the last decade due to illegal hunting with dogs. Although information on their status in the wild is lacking, lowland bongos are not presently considered endangered.

Bongos are susceptible to diseases such as <a href="rinderpest">rinderpest</a>, which almost exterminated the species during the 1890s. "Tragelaphus eurycerus" may suffer from <a href="goitre">goitre</a>. Over the course of the disease, the <a href="thyroid%20glands">thyroid glands</a> greatly enlarge (up to 10 x 20 cm) and may become <a href="%3Awikt%3Apolycystic">polycystic</a>. Pathogenesis of goiter in the bongo may reflect a mixture of genetic predisposition coupled with environmental factors, including a period of exposure to a <a href="goitrogen">goitrogen</a>. <a href="Leopard">Leopard</a>s and <a href="spotted%20hyena">spotted hyena</a>s are the primary natural predators (<a href="lion">lion</a>s are seldom encountered due to differing habitat preferences); <a href="Pythonidae">pythons</a> sometimes eat bongo calves. Humans prey on them for their <a href="Fur">pelt</a>s, horns, and meat, with the species being a common local source for "bush meat". Bongo populations have been greatly reduced by hunting, <a href="poaching">poaching</a>, and <a href="animal%20trapping">animal trapping</a>, although some bongo refuges exist.

Although bongos are quite easy for humans to catch using snares, many people native to the bongos' habitat believed that if they ate or touched bongo, they would have spasms similar to <a href="epileptic%20seizures">epileptic seizures</a>. Because of this <a href="superstition">superstition</a>, bongos were less harmed in their native ranges than expected. However, these taboos are said no longer to exist, which may account for increased hunting by humans in recent times.

An international studbook is maintained to help manage animals held in captivity. Because of its bright colour, it is very popular in zoos and private collections. In North America, over 400 individuals are thought to be held, a population that probably exceeds that of the mountain bongo in the wild.

In 2000, the <a href="Association%20of%20Zoos%20and%20Aquariums">Association of Zoos and Aquariums</a> (AZA) upgraded the bongo to a Species Survival Plan participant, which works to improve the <a href="genetic%20diversity">genetic diversity</a> of managed animal populations. The target population for participating zoos and private collections in North America is 250 animals. Through the efforts of zoos in North America, a reintroduction to the population in Kenya is being developed.

At least one collaborative effort for reintroduction between North American wildlife facilities has already been carried out. In 2004, 18 eastern bongos born in North American zoos gathered at <a href="White%20Oak%20Conservation">White Oak Conservation</a> in <a href="Yulee%2C%20Florida">Yulee, Florida</a> for release in Kenya. White Oak staff members traveled with the bongos to a Mt. Kenya holding facility, where they stayed until being reintroduced.

In the last few decades, a rapid decline in the numbers of wild mountain bongo has occurred due to poaching and human pressure on their habitat, with local extinctions reported in <a href="Cherangani%20Hills">Cherangani</a> and <a href="Chepalungu">Chepalungu</a> hills, Kenya.

The Bongo Surveillance Programme, working alongside the <a href="Kenya%20Wildlife%20Service">Kenya Wildlife Service</a>, have recorded photos of bongos at remote salt licks in the Aberdare Forests using camera traps, and, by analyzing <a href="DNA">DNA</a> extracted from <a href="Feces">dung</a>, have confirmed the presence of bongo in Mount Kenya, <a href="Ol%20Doinyo%20Eburru">Eburru</a> and <a href="Mau%20forest">Mau forest</a>s. The programme estimate as few as 140 animals left in the wild – spread across four isolated populations. Whilst captive breeding programmes can be viewed as having been successful in ensuring survival of this species in Europe and North America, the situation in the wild has been less promising. Evidence exists of bongo surviving in Kenya. However, these populations are believed to be small, fragmented, and vulnerable to extinction.

Animal populations with impoverished genetic diversity are inherently less able to adapt to changes in their environments (such as climate change, disease outbreaks, habitat change, etc.). The isolation of the four remaining small bongo populations, which themselves would appear to be in decline, means a substantial amount of genetic material is lost each generation. Whilst the population remains small, the impact of transfers will be greater, so the establishment of a "metapopulation management plan" occurs concurrently with conservation initiatives to enhance "in situ" population growth, and this initiative is both urgent and fundamental to the future survival of mountain bongo in the wild.

The western/lowland bongo faces an ongoing population decline as habitat destruction and hunting pressures increase with the relentless expansion of human settlement. Its long-term survival will only be assured in areas which receive active protection and management. At present, such areas comprise about 30,000 km, and several are in countries where political stability is fragile. So, a realistic possibility exists whereby its status could decline to Threatened in the near future.

As the largest and most spectacular forest antelope, the western/lowland bongo is both an important flagship species for protected areas such as national parks, and a major trophy species which has been taken in increasing numbers in Central Africa by sport hunters during the 1990s. Both of these factors are strong incentives to provide effective protection and management of populations.

<a href="Trophy%20hunting">Trophy hunting</a> has the potential to provide economic justification for the preservation of larger areas of bongo habitat than national parks, especially in remote regions of Central Africa, where possibilities for commercially successful tourism are very limited.

The eastern/mountain bongo’s survival in the wild is dependent on more effective protection of the surviving remnant populations in Kenya. If this does not occur, it will eventually become extinct in the wild. The existence of a healthy captive population of this subspecies offers the potential for its reintroduction.

In 2004, Dr. Jake Veasey, the head of the Department of Animal Management and Conservation at <a href="Woburn%20Safari%20Park">Woburn Safari Park</a> and a member of the European Association of Zoos and Aquariums Population Management Advisory Group, with the assistance of Lindsay Banks, took over responsibility for the management and coordination of the European Endangered Species Programme for the eastern bongo. This includes some 250 animals across Europe and the Middle East.

Along with the <a href="Rothschild%20giraffe">Rothschild giraffe</a>, the eastern bongo is arguably one of the most threatened large mammals in Africa, with recent estimates numbering less than 140 animals, below a minimum sustainable viable population. The situation is exacerbated because these animals are spread across four isolated populations. Whilst the bongo endangered species program can be viewed as having been successful in ensuring survival of this species in Europe, it has not yet become actively involved in the conservation of this species in the wild in a coordinated fashion. The plan is to engage in conservation activities in Kenya to assist in reversing the decline of the eastern bongo populations and genetic diversity in Africa, and in particular, applying population management expertise to help ensure the persistence of genetic diversity in the free ranging wild populations.
To illustrate significance of genetic diversity loss, assume the average metapopulation size is 35 animals based on 140 animals spread across four populations (140/4=35). Assuming stable populations, these populations will lose 8% of their genetic diversity every decade. By managing all four populations as one, through strategic transfers, gene loss is reduced from 8% to 2% per decade, without any increase in bongo numbers in Kenya. By managing the European and African populations as one – by strategic exports from Europe combined with "in situ" transfers, gene loss is reduced to 0.72% every 100 years, with both populations remaining stable. If populations in Kenya are allowed to grow through the implementation of effective conservation, including strategic transfers, gene loss can be effectively halted in this species and its future secured in the wild.

The initial aims of the project are: 

If effective protection were implemented immediately and bongo populations allowed to expand without transfers, then this would create a bigger population of genetically impoverished bongos. These animals would be less able to adapt to a dynamic environment. Whilst the population remains small, the impact of transfers will be greater. For this reason, the 'metapopulation management plan' must occur concurrently with conservation strategies to enhance "in situ" population growth. This initiative is both urgent and fundamental to the future survival of the mountain bongo in the wild.
In 2013, SafariCom telecommunications donated money to the Bongo Surveillance Programme to try to keep tabs on what are thought to be the last 100 eastern bongos left in the wild in the Mau Eburu Forest in central Kenya, whose numbers are still declining due to logging of their habitat and illegal poaching.

Mount Kenya Wildlife Conservancy runs a bongo rehabilitation program in collaboration with the Kenya Wildlife Service. The Conservancy aims to prevent extinction of the bongo through breeding and release back into the wild.

In 2002 the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> listed the western/lowland species as <a href="Near%20Threatened">Near Threatened</a>. These bongos may be endangered due to human environmental interaction, as well as hunting and illegal actions towards wildlife. <a href="CITES">CITES</a> lists bongos as an Appendix III species, only regulating their exportation from a single country, Ghana. It is not protected by the US Endangered Species Act and is not listed by the <a href="USFWS">USFWS</a>.

The IUCN Antelope Specialist Group considers the western or lowland bongo, "T. e. eurycerus", to be Lower Risk (Near Threatened), and the eastern or mountain bongo, "T. e. isaaci", of Kenya, to be <a href="Critically%20Endangered">Critically Endangered</a>. Other subspecific names have been used, but their validity has not been tested.

Bunyip

The bunyip is a large <a href="Mythology">mythical</a> <a href="animal">creature</a> from <a href="Australian%20Aboriginal%20mythology">Australian Aboriginal mythology</a>, said to lurk in <a href="swamp">swamp</a>s, <a href="billabong">billabong</a>s, <a href="stream">creeks</a>, riverbeds, and <a href="wiktionary%3Awaterhole">waterhole</a>s.

The origin of the word "bunyip" has been traced to the <a href="Wemba-Wemba">Wemba-Wemba</a> or Wergaia language of Aboriginal people of South-Eastern Australia. However, the bunyip appears to have formed part of traditional Aboriginal beliefs and stories throughout Australia, although its name varied according to tribal nomenclature. In his 2001 book, writer Robert Holden identified at least nine regional variations for the creature known as the bunyip across Aboriginal Australia. Various written accounts of bunyips were made by Europeans in the early and mid-19th century, as settlement spread across the country.

The word "bunyip" is usually translated by Aboriginal Australians today as "devil" or "evil spirit". However, this translation may not accurately represent the role of the bunyip in pre-contact <a href="Aboriginal%20mythology">Aboriginal mythology</a> or its possible origins before written accounts were made. Some modern sources allude to a linguistic connection between the bunyip and <a href="Bunjil">Bunjil</a>, "a mythic 'Great Man' who made the mountains and rivers and man and all the animals." The word "bunyip" may not have appeared in print in English until the mid-1840s.

By the 1850s, "bunyip" had also become a "synonym for impostor, pretender, humbug and the like" in the broader Australian community. The term "<a href="bunyip%20aristocracy">bunyip aristocracy</a>" was first coined in 1853 to describe Australians aspiring to be aristocrats. In the early 1990s, it was famously used by Prime Minister <a href="Paul%20Keating">Paul Keating</a> to describe members of the conservative <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal Party of Australia</a> opposition.

The word "bunyip" can still be found in a number of Australian contexts, including place names such as the <a href="Bunyip%20River">Bunyip River</a> (which flows into <a href="Westernport%20Bay">Westernport Bay</a> in southern <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>) and the town of <a href="Bunyip%2C%20Victoria">Bunyip</a>, Victoria.

Descriptions of bunyips vary widely. George French Angus may have collected a description of a bunyip in his account of a "water spirit" from the Moorundi people of the <a href="Murray%20River">Murray River</a> before 1847, stating it is "much dreaded by them ... It inhabits the Murray; but ... they have some difficulty describing it. Its most usual form ... is said to be that of an enormous starfish." Robert Brough Smyth's "Aborigines of Victoria" of 1878 devoted ten pages to the bunyip, but concluded "in truth little is known among the blacks respecting its form, covering or habits; they appear to have been in such dread of it as to have been unable to take note of its characteristics." However, common features in many 19th-century newspaper accounts include a dog-like face, a crocodile like head, dark fur, a <a href="horse">horse</a>-like tail, <a href="flipper%20%28anatomy%29">flipper</a>s, and <a href="walrus">walrus</a>-like <a href="tusk">tusk</a>s or horns or a <a href="duck">duck</a>-like bill.

The Challicum bunyip, an outline image of a bunyip carved by Aborigines into the bank of Fiery Creek, near <a href="Ararat%2C%20Victoria">Ararat</a>, Victoria, was first recorded by "The Australasian" newspaper in 1851. According to the report, the bunyip had been speared after killing an Aboriginal man. Antiquarian Reynell Johns claimed that until the mid-1850s, Aboriginal people made a "habit of visiting the place annually and retracing the outlines of the figure [of the bunyip] which is about 11 paces long and 4 paces in extreme breadth." The outline image no longer exists.

Non-Aboriginal Australians have made various attempts to understand and explain the origins of the bunyip as a physical entity over the past 150 years.

Writing in 1933, Charles Fenner suggested that it was likely that the "actual origin of the bunyip myth lies in the fact that from time to time seals have made their way up the ... Murray and Darling (Rivers)". He provided examples of seals found as far inland as <a href="Barmera%2C%20South%20Australia">Overland Corner</a>, <a href="Loxton%2C%20South%20Australia">Loxton</a>, and <a href="Conargo%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Conargo</a> and reminded readers that "the smooth fur, prominent 'apricot' eyes and the bellowing cry are characteristic of the seal", especially <a href="southern%20elephant%20seal">southern elephant seal</a>s and <a href="leopard%20seal">leopard seal</a>s.

Another suggestion is that the bunyip may be a <a href="cultural%20memory">cultural memory</a> of extinct Australian marsupials such as the "<a href="Diprotodon">Diprotodon</a>", "<a href="Zygomaturus">Zygomaturus</a>", "<a href="Nototherium">Nototherium</a>" or "<a href="Palorchestes">Palorchestes</a>". This connection was first formally made by Dr George Bennett of the Australian Museum in 1871, but in the early 1990s, palaeontologist Pat Vickers-Rich and geologist Neil Archbold also cautiously suggested that Aboriginal legends "perhaps had stemmed from an acquaintance with prehistoric bones or even living prehistoric animals themselves ... When confronted with the remains of some of the now extinct Australian marsupials, Aborigines would often identify them as the bunyip." They also note that "legends about the" mihirung paringmal" of western Victorian Aborigines ... may allude to the ... extinct giant birds the <a href="Dromornithidae">Dromornithidae</a>."

Another connection to the bunyip is the shy Australasian bittern ("<a href="Botaurus%20poiciloptilus">Botaurus poiciloptilus</a>"). During the breeding season, the male call of this marsh-dwelling bird is a "low pitched boom"; hence, it is occasionally called the "bunyip bird".

During the early settlement of Australia by Europeans, the notion that the bunyip was an actual unknown animal that awaited discovery became common. Early European settlers, unfamiliar with the sights and sounds of the island continent's peculiar fauna, regarded the bunyip as one more strange Australian animal and sometimes attributed unfamiliar animal calls or cries to it. It has also been suggested that 19th-century bunyip lore was reinforced by imported European memories, such as that of the Irish <a href="P%C3%BAca">Púca</a>.

A large number of bunyip sightings occurred during the 1840s and 1850s, particularly in the southeastern colonies of <a href="Colony%20of%20Victoria">Victoria</a>, <a href="Colony%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> and <a href="Colony%20of%20South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, as European settlers extended their reach. The following is not an exhaustive list of accounts:

One of the earliest accounts relating to a large unknown freshwater animal was in 1818, when <a href="Hamilton%20Hume">Hamilton Hume</a> and James Meehan found some large bones at <a href="Lake%20Bathurst">Lake Bathurst</a> in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. They did not call the animal a bunyip, but described the remains indicating the creature as very much like a <a href="hippopotamus">hippopotamus</a> or <a href="manatee">manatee</a>. The Philosophical Society of Australasia later offered to reimburse Hume for any costs incurred in recovering a specimen of the unknown animal, but for various reasons, Hume did not return to the lake. It might be noted that "<a href="Diprotodon">Diprotodon</a>" skeletons have sometimes been compared to the hippopotamus; they are a land animal, but have sometimes been found in a lake or water course.

More significant was the discovery of fossilised bones of "some quadruped much larger than the ox or buffalo" in the <a href="Wellington%20Caves">Wellington Caves</a> in mid-1830 by bushman George Rankin and later by <a href="Thomas%20Mitchell%20%28explorer%29">Thomas Mitchell</a>. Sydney's Reverend <a href="John%20Dunmore%20Lang">John Dunmore Lang</a> announced the find as "convincing proof of the deluge". However, it was British anatomist <a href="Sir%20Richard%20Owen">Sir Richard Owen</a> who identified the fossils as the gigantic marsupials "<a href="Nototherium">Nototherium</a>" and "<a href="Diprotodon">Diprotodon</a>". At the same time, some settlers observed "all natives throughout these ... districts have a tradition (of) a very large animal having at one time existed in the large creeks and rivers and by many it is said that such animals now exist."

In July 1845, "The <a href="Geelong%20Advertiser">Geelong Advertiser</a>" announced the discovery of fossils found near <a href="Geelong">Geelong</a>, under the headline "Wonderful Discovery of a new Animal". This was a continuation of a story on 'fossil remains' from the previous issue. The newspaper continued, "On the bone being shown to an intelligent black (sic), he at once recognised it as belonging to the bunyip, which he declared he had seen. On being requested to make a drawing of it, he did so without hesitation." The account noted a story of an Aboriginal woman being killed by a bunyip and the "most direct evidence of all" – that of a man named Mumbowran "who showed several deep wounds on his breast made by the claws of the animal". The account provided this description of the creature:
Shortly after this account appeared, it was repeated in other Australian newspapers. However, it appears to be the first use of the word "bunyip" in a written publication.

In January 1846, a peculiar skull was taken from the banks of <a href="Murrumbidgee%20River">Murrumbidgee River</a> near <a href="Balranald%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Balranald</a>, New South Wales. Initial reports suggested that it was the skull of something unknown to science. The squatter who found it remarked, "all the natives to whom it was shown called [it] a bunyip". By July 1847, several experts, including W. S. Macleay and Professor Owen, had identified the skull as the deformed foetal skull of a foal or calf. At the same time, however, the purported bunyip skull was put on display in the <a href="Australian%20Museum">Australian Museum</a> (Sydney) for two days. Visitors flocked to see it, and "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" said that it prompted many people to speak out about their "bunyip sightings". Reports of this discovery used the phrase 'Kine Pratie' as well as Bunyip and explorer <a href="William%20Hovell">William Hovell</a>, who examined the skull, also called it a 'katen-pai'.

In March of that year "a bunyip or an immense Platibus" (<a href="Platypus">Platypus</a>) was sighted "sunning himself on the placid bosom of the Yarra, just opposite the Custom House" in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. "Immediately a crowd gathered" and three men set off by boat "to secure the stranger" who "disappeared" when they were "about a yard from him".

Another early written account is attributed to escaped convict <a href="William%20Buckley%20%28convict%29">William Buckley</a> in his 1852 biography of thirty years living with the <a href="Wathaurong">Wathaurong</a> people. His 1852 account records "in ... Lake Moodewarri [now Lake Modewarre] as well as in most of the others inland ... is a ... very extraordinary amphibious animal, which the natives call Bunyip." Buckley's account suggests he saw such a creature on several occasions. He adds, "I could never see any part, except the back, which appeared to be covered with feathers of a dusky grey colour. It seemed to be about the size of a full grown calf ... I could never learn from any of the natives that they had seen either the head or tail." Buckley also claimed the creature was common in the <a href="Barwon%20River%20%28Victoria%29">Barwon River</a> and cites an example he heard of an Aboriginal woman being killed by one. He emphasized the bunyip was believed to have supernatural powers.

The word "bunyip" has been used in other Australian contexts, including "The Bunyip" newspaper as the banner of a local weekly newspaper published in the town of <a href="Gawler%2C%20South%20Australia">Gawler, South Australia</a>. First published as a pamphlet by the Gawler Humbug Society in 1863, the name was chosen because "the Bunyip is the true type of Australian Humbug!" The word is also used in numerous other Australian contexts, including the House of the Gentle Bunyip in <a href="Clifton%20Hill%2C%20Victoria">Clifton Hill</a>, Victoria.

Numerous tales of the bunyip in written literature appeared in the 19th and early 20th centuries. One of the earliest known is a story in <a href="Andrew%20Lang">Andrew Lang</a>'s "<a href="Andrew%20Lang%27s%20Fairy%20Books%23Brown%20Fairy%20Book%20%281904%29">The Brown Fairy Book</a>" (1904).

Alexander Bunyip, created by children's author and illustrator Michael Salmon, first appeared in print in "The Monster That Ate Canberra" in 1972, Alexander Bunyip went on to appear in many other books and a live-action television series, "<a href="Alexander%20Bunyip%27s%20Billabong">Alexander Bunyip's Billabong</a>". A statue of Alexander was opened in front of the <a href="Gungahlin">Gungahlin</a> Library in 2011. The artwork by Anne Ross, called 'A is for Alexander, B is for Bunyip, C is for Canberra' was commissioned by the ACT Government for Gungahlin's $3.8 million town park.

The Australian tourism boom of the 1970s brought a renewed interest in bunyip mythology.


Bunyip stories have also appeared outside of Australia.


In the Australian film "<a href="Frog%20Dreaming">Frog Dreaming</a>" (1986), the story centres around the search for a bunyip called Donkegin.

In the 21st century the bunyip can be considered part of the international consciousness.

Boone, North Carolina

Boone is a town located in the <a href="Blue%20Ridge%20Mountains">Blue Ridge Mountains</a> of western <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, United States. Boone's population was 17,122 in 2010.

The town is named for famous <a href="American%20pioneer">American pioneer</a> and explorer <a href="Daniel%20Boone">Daniel Boone</a>, and every summer since 1952 has hosted an outdoor <a href="amphitheatre">amphitheatre</a> drama, <a href="Horn%20in%20the%20West">Horn in the West</a>, portraying the British settlement of the area during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> and featuring the contributions of its namesake. It is the largest community and the economic hub of the seven-county region of Western North Carolina known as the <a href="Western%20North%20Carolina%23High%20Country">High Country</a>.

In 2012, Boone was listed among the 10 best places to retire in the U.S. by "U.S. News".

 Boone took its name from the famous pioneer and explorer <a href="Daniel%20Boone">Daniel Boone</a>, who on several occasions camped at a site generally agreed to be within the present city limits. Daniel's nephews, Jesse and Jonathan (sons of brother Israel Boone), were members of the town's first church, Three Forks Baptist, still in existence today.
Boone was served by the <a href="narrow%20gauge%20railway">narrow gauge</a> <a href="East%20Tennessee%20and%20Western%20North%20Carolina%20Railroad">East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad</a> (nicknamed "<a href="Tweetsie%20Railroad">Tweetsie</a>") until the flood of 1940. The flood washed away much of the tracks and it was decided not to replace them.

Boone is the home of <a href="Appalachian%20State%20University">Appalachian State University</a>, a constituent member of the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina">University of North Carolina</a>.
Appalachian State is the sixth largest university in the seventeen-campus system.
<a href="Caldwell%20Community%20College%20%26amp%3B%20Technical%20Institute">Caldwell Community College & Technical Institute</a> also operates a satellite campus in Boone.

""<a href="Horn%20in%20the%20West">Horn in the West</a>"", a dramatization of the life and times of the early settlers of the mountain area, which features Daniel Boone as one of its characters, has been performed in an outdoor <a href="amphitheatre">amphitheatre</a> above the town every summer since 1952.
The original actor in the role of "Daniel Boone" was <a href="Ned%20Austin">Ned Austin</a>. His "Hollywood Star" stands on a pedestal on King Street in downtown Boone. He was followed in the role by Glenn Causey, who portrayed the rugged frontiersman for 41 years, and whose image is still seen in many of the depictions of Boone featured in the area today.

Boone is located at (36.211364, −81.668657) and has an elevation of 3,333 feet (1015.9 m) above sea level. An earlier survey gave the elevation as 3,332 ft and since then it has been published as having an elevation of 3,333 ft (1,016 m). Boone has the highest elevation of any town of its size (over 10,000 population) east of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>. As such, Boone features, depending on the <a href="isotherm%20%28contour%20line%29">isotherm</a> used, a <a href="subtropical%20highland%20climate">subtropical highland climate</a> (<a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen</a> "Cfb"), or a <a href="humid%20continental%20climate">humid continental climate</a> (Köppen "Dfb"), a rarity for the Southeastern United States, and straddles the boundary between <a href="Hardiness%20zone">USDA Plant Hardiness Zone</a>s 6B and 7A; the elevation also results in enhanced precipitation, with of average annual precipitation. Compared to the lower elevations of the Carolinas, winters are long and cold, with frequent <a href="Ice%20pellets">sleet</a> and <a href="snowfall">snowfall</a>. The daily average temperature in January is , which gives Boone a winter climate more similar to coastal southern <a href="New%20England">New England</a> rather than the Southeast, where a <a href="humid%20subtropical">humid subtropical</a> climate dominates. Blizzard-like conditions are not unusual during many winters. Summers are warm, but far cooler and less humid than lower regions to the south and east, with a July daily average temperature of . Boone typically receives on average nearly of snowfall annually, far higher than the lowland areas in the rest of North Carolina.

As of the census of 2000, there were 13,472 people, 4,374 households, and 1,237 families residing in the town. The <a href="population%20density">population density</a> was 2,307.0 people per square mile (890.7/km²). There were 4,748 housing units at an average density of 813.0 per square mile (313.9/km²). The racial makeup of the town was 93.98% <a href="White%20American">White</a>, 3.42% <a href="African%20American">Black or African American</a>, 0.30% <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a>, 1.19% <a href="Asian%20American">Asian</a>, 0.05% <a href="Pacific%20Islander%20American">Pacific Islander</a>, 0.46% from <a href="Race%20and%20ethnicity%20in%20the%20United%20States%20Census%23Race">other races</a>, and 0.60% from <a href="Multiracial%20American">two or more races</a>. 1.64% of the population were <a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Hispanic or Latino</a> of any race.

There were 4,374 households out of which 9.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 21.0% were married couples living together, 5.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 71.7% were non-families. 38.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 1.97 and the average family size was 2.63.

The age distribution is 5.8% under 18, 65.9% from 18 to 24, 12.1% from 25 to 44, 9.1% from 45 to 64, and 7.1% who were 65 or older. The median age was 21 years. Both the overall age distribution and the median age are driven by the presence of the local university, Appalachian State. For every 100 females there are 95.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.7 males.

The median household income is $20,541, and the median family income is $49,762. The <a href="per%20capita%20income">per capita income</a> is $12,256. 37.0% of the population and 9.2% of families were below the <a href="poverty%20line">poverty line</a>.

Men had a median income of $28,060 versus $20,000 for women. However, poverty statistics that are based on surveys of the entire population can be extremely misleading in communities dominated by students, such as Boone. Out of the total population, 6.3% of those under the age of 18 and 9.1% of those 65 and older were living below the poverty line.

Boone is mainly served by three local newspapers:


A smaller newspaper, "The Appalachian", is Appalachian State University's campus newspaper; it is published twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays. In addition to the locally printed papers, a monthly entertainment pamphlet named "Kraut Creek Revival" has limited circulation and is funded by a Denver, NC-based newspaper.


Boone operates under a <a href="mayor-council%20government">mayor-council government</a>. The city council consists of five members. The mayor presides over the council and casts a vote on issues only in the event of a tie. As of July 2015, the Town Council members are: Rennie Brantz, Acting Mayor and Mayor Pro Tem, and Councilors: Lynne Mason, Fred Hay, and Quint David.

Industrial, commercial, and residential development in the town of Boone is a controversial issue due to its location in the mountains of Appalachia. On October 16, 2009, the town council accepted the "Boone 2030 Land Use Plan." While the document itself is not in any way actual law, it is used by the town council, board of adjustment, and other committees to guide decision making as to what types of development are appropriate.

In 2009, the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Department%20of%20Transportation">North Carolina Department of Transportation</a> began widening 1.1 miles of U.S. 421 (King Street) to a 4-to-6-lane divided highway with a raised concrete median from U.S. 321 (Hardin Street) to east of N.C. 194 (Jefferson Road), including a new entrance and exit to the new Watauga High School, at a cost of $16.2 million. The widening has displaced 25 businesses and 63 residences east of historic downtown King Street. The project was slated to be completed by December 31, 2011, but construction continued into the spring of 2012.

<a href="Samaritan%27s%20Purse">Samaritan's Purse</a> is based in Boone.

According to the Town's 2014 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

<doc id="4513" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4513" title="Banshee">
Banshee

A banshee ( ; <a href="Irish%20language">Modern Irish</a> "bean sí", from , , "woman of the <a href="Tumulus%23Ireland">fairy mound</a>" or "fairy woman") is a female <a href="spirit">spirit</a> in <a href="Irish%20mythology">Irish mythology</a> who heralds the death of a family member, usually by shrieking or <a href="keening">keening</a>. Her name is connected to the mythologically-important <a href="tumulus">tumuli</a> or "mounds" that dot the Irish countryside, which are known as <a href="s%C3%ADd">síd</a>e (singular "síd") in <a href="Old%20Irish">Old Irish</a>.

The banshee is often described in Gaelic lore as wearing red or green, usually with long, disheveled hair (usually described as red or orange, and yellow in medieval times described to shimmer like wild fire). She can appear in a variety of forms. Perhaps most often she is seen as an ugly, frightful hag, but she can also appear young and beautiful if she chooses. In some tales, the figure who first appears to be a banshee or other "<a href="cailleach">cailleach</a>" (hag) is later revealed to be the Irish battle goddess, <a href="Morr%C3%ADgan">Morrígan</a>.

In Ireland and parts of Scotland, a traditional part of mourning is the <a href="keening">keening</a> woman ("bean chaointe"), who wails a lament - in , (Connaught dialect) or (Ulster dialect), "caoin" meaning "to weep, to wail". This keening woman may in some cases be a professional, and the best keeners would be in high demand.

Irish legend speaks of a lament being sung by a fairy woman; she would sing it when a family member died or was about to die, even if the person had died far away and news of their death had not yet come, so that the wailing of the banshee was the first warning the household had of the death.

She also predicts death. If someone is about to enter a situation where it is unlikely they will come out of alive she will warn people by screaming or wailing. Hence why a banshee is also known as a wailing woman.

It is often stated that the Banshee laments only the descendants of the pure Milesian stock of Ireland, sometimes clarified as surnames prefixed with O' and Mac, and some accounts even state that each family has its own Banshee. One account, however, also included the Geraldines, as they had apparently become "<a href="more%20Irish%20than%20the%20Irish%20themselves">more Irish than the Irish themselves</a>".

When several banshees appear at once, it indicates the death of someone great or holy. The tales sometimes recounted that the woman, though called a fairy, was a ghost, often of a specific murdered woman, or a mother who died in childbirth.

The Ua Briain banshee is thought to be named <a href="Aibell">Aibell</a> and the ruler of 25 other banshees who would always be at her attendance. It is possible that this particular story is the source of the idea that the wailing of numerous banshees signifies the death of a great person.

Most, though not all, surnames associated with banshees have the "Ó" or "Mc/Mac" prefix - that is, surnames of Goidelic origin, indicating a family native to the Insular Celtic lands rather than those of the Norse, English, or Norman invaders. Accounts reach as far back as 1380 to the publication of the "<a href="Cathreim%20Thoirdhealbhaigh">Cathreim Thoirdhealbhaigh</a>" ("Triumphs of Torlough") by Sean mac Craith. Mentions of banshees can also be found in <a href="Normans">Norman</a> literature of that time.

In some parts of <a href="Leinster">Leinster</a>, she is referred to as the "bean chaointe" (keening woman) whose wail can be so piercing that it shatters glass. In Scottish folklore, a similar creature is known as the <a href="bean%20nighe">bean nighe</a> or "ban nigheachain" (little washerwoman) or "nigheag na h-àth" (little washer at the ford) and is seen washing the bloodstained clothes or armour of those who are about to die. In Welsh folklore, a similar creature is known as the <a href="hag%20of%20the%20mist">hag of the mist</a>.

Genetically modified maize

Genetically modified maize (<a href="maize">corn</a>) is a <a href="genetically%20modified%20crop">genetically modified crop</a>. Specific maize strains have been <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetically engineered</a> to express agriculturally-desirable <a href="Phenotypic%20trait">traits</a>, including resistance to pests and to herbicides. Maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries. GM maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects, impact on other insects and impact on other plants via <a href="gene%20flow">gene flow</a>. One strain, called Starlink, was approved only for animal feed in the US, but was found in food, leading to a <a href="Starlink%20corn%20recalls">series of recalls starting in 2000</a>.

Corn varieties resistant to <a href="glyphosate">glyphosate</a> herbicides were first commercialized in 1996 by <a href="Monsanto">Monsanto</a>, and are known as "Roundup Ready Corn". They tolerate the use of <a href="Roundup%20%28herbicide%29">Roundup</a>. <a href="Bayer%20CropScience">Bayer CropScience</a> developed "Liberty Link Corn" that is resistant to <a href="glufosinate">glufosinate</a>. <a href="Pioneer%20Hi-Bred">Pioneer Hi-Bred</a> has developed and markets corn hybrids with tolerance to <a href="imidazoline">imidazoline</a> herbicides under the trademark "Clearfield" – though in these hybrids, the herbicide-tolerance trait was bred using tissue culture selection and the chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate, not <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a>. Consequently, the regulatory framework governing the approval of transgenic crops does not apply for Clearfield.

As of 2011, herbicide-resistant GM corn was grown in 14 countries. By 2012, 26 varieties herbicide-resistant GM maize were authorised for import into the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>., but such imports remain controversial. Cultivation of herbicide-resistant corn in the EU provides substantial farm-level benefits.

Bt corn is a variant of <a href="maize">maize</a> that has been <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetically altered</a> to express one or more <a href="protein">protein</a>s from the <a href="bacteria">bacterium</a> "<a href="Bacillus%20thuringiensis">Bacillus thuringiensis</a>". The protein is poisonous to certain insect pests and is widely used in <a href="organic%20gardening">organic gardening</a>. The <a href="European%20corn%20borer">European corn borer</a> causes about a billion dollars in damage to corn crops each year.

In recent years, traits have been added to ward off <a href="Helicoverpa%20zea">corn ear worm</a>s and <a href="Diabrotica">root worm</a>s, the latter of which annually causes about a billion dollars in damages.

The Bt protein is expressed throughout the plant. When a vulnerable insect eats the Bt-containing plant, the protein is activated in its <a href="gut%20%28anatomy%29">gut</a>, which is <a href="alkaline">alkaline</a>. In the alkaline environment the protein partially unfolds and is cut by other proteins, forming a <a href="toxin">toxin</a> that paralyzes the insect's digestive system and forms holes in the gut wall. The insect stops eating within a few hours and eventually starves.

In 1996, the first GM maize producing a Bt Cry protein was approved, which killed the European corn borer and related species; subsequent Bt genes were introduced that killed corn rootworm larvae.

Approved Bt genes include single and stacked (event names bracketed) configurations of: Cry1A.105 (MON89034), CryIAb (<a href="MON%20810">MON810</a>), CryIF (1507), Cry2Ab (MON89034), <a href="Cry3Bb1">Cry3Bb1</a> (<a href="MON%20863">MON863</a> and MON88017), Cry34Ab1 (59122), Cry35Ab1 (59122), mCry3A (MIR604), and Vip3A (MIR162), in both corn and cotton. Corn genetically modified to produce VIP was first approved in the US in 2010.

In 2013 <a href="Monsanto">Monsanto</a> launched the first transgenic drought tolerance trait in a line of corn hybrids called DroughtGard. The MON 87460 trait is provided by the insertion of the cspB gene from the soil microbe "<a href="Bacillus%20subtilis">Bacillus subtilis</a>"; it was approved by the USDA in 2011 and by China in 2013.

GM sweet corn varieties include "Attribute", the brand name for insect-resistant sweet corn developed by <a href="Syngenta">Syngenta</a> and Performance Series™ insect-resistant sweet corn developed by Monsanto.

In 2007, South African researchers announced the production of transgenic maize resistant to <a href="maize%20streak%20virus">maize streak virus</a> (MSV), although it has not been released as a product.

While breeding cultivars for resistance to MSV isn't done in the public, the private sector, international research centers, and national programmes have done all of the breeding.

As of 2014, there have been a few MSV-tolerant cultivars released in Africa. A private company <a href="Seedco">Seedco</a> has released 5 MSV cultivars.

US <a href="Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) regulations require farmers who plant Bt corn to plant non-Bt corn nearby (called a refuge) to provide a location to harbor vulnerable <a href="Maize%23Pests">pests</a>. Typically, 20% of corn in a grower's fields must be refuge; refuge must be at least 0.5 miles from Bt corn for <a href="lepidopteran">lepidopteran</a> pests, and refuge for <a href="corn%20rootworm">corn rootworm</a> must at least be adjacent to a Bt field.

The theory behind these refuges is to slow the evolution of resistance to the pesticide. EPA regulations also require seed companies to train farmers how to maintain refuges, to collect data on the refuges and to report that data to the EPA. A study of these reports found that from 2003 to 2005 farmer compliance with keeping refuges was above 90%, but that by 2008 approximately 25% of Bt corn farmers did not keep refuges properly, raising concerns that resistance would develop.

Unmodified crops received most of the economic benefits of Bt corn in the US in 1996-2007, because of the overall reduction of pest populations. This reduction came because females laid eggs on modified and unmodified strains alike.

Seed bags containing both Bt and refuge seed have been approved by the EPA in the United States. These seed mixtures were marketed as "Refuge in a Bag" (RIB) to increase farmer compliance with refuge requirements and reduce additional work needed at planting from having separate Bt and refuge seed bags on hand. The EPA approved a lower percentage of refuge seed in these seed mixtures ranging from 5 to 10%. This strategy is likely to reduce the likelihood of Bt-resistance occurring for <a href="corn%20rootworm">corn rootworm</a>, but may increase the risk of resistance for <a href="lepidopteran">lepidopteran</a> pests, such as <a href="European%20corn%20borer">European corn borer</a>. Increased concerns for resistance with seed mixtures include partially resistant larvae on a Bt plant being able to move to a susceptible plant to survive or cross pollination of refuge pollen on to Bt plants that can lower the amount of Bt expressed in kernels for ear feeding insects.

Resistant strains of the European corn borer have developed in areas with defective or absent refuge management.

In November 2009, Monsanto scientists found the <a href="pink%20bollworm">pink bollworm</a> had become resistant to first-generation Bt cotton in parts of <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>, India – that generation expresses one Bt gene, "Cry1Ac". This was the first instance of Bt resistance confirmed by Monsanto anywhere in the world. Bollworm resistance to first generation Bt cotton has been identified in Australia, China, Spain, and the United States. In 2012, a Florida field trial demonstrated that <a href="Fall%20armyworm">army worms</a> were resistant to pesticide-containing GM corn produced by Dupont-Dow; armyworm resistance was first discovered in Puerto Rico in 2006, prompting Dow and DuPont to voluntarily stop selling the product on the island.

Regulation of GM crops varies between countries, with some of the most-marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on intended uses.

There is a <a href="scientific%20consensus">scientific consensus</a> that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by-case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation.

The scientific rigor of the studies regarding human health has been disputed due to alleged lack of independence and due to conflicts of interest involving governing bodies and some of those who perform and evaluate the studies.

GM crops provide a number of ecological benefits, but there are also concerns for their overuse, stalled research outside of the Bt seed industry, proper management and issues with Bt resistance arising from their misuse.

Critics have objected to GM crops on ecological, economic and health grounds. The economic issues derive from those organisms that are subject to intellectual property law, mostly patents. The first generation of GM crops lose patent protection beginning in 2015. Monsanto has claimed it will not pursue farmers who retain seeds of off-patent varieties. These controversies have led to litigation, international trade disputes, protests and to restrictive legislation in most countries.

Critics claim that Bt proteins could target predatory and other beneficial or harmless insects as well as the targeted pest. These proteins have been used as organic sprays for insect control in France since 1938 and the USA since 1958 with no ill effects on the environment reported. While "cyt" proteins are toxic towards the insect order <a href="Diptera">Diptera</a> (flies), certain "cry" proteins selectively target <a href="lepidopterans">lepidopterans</a> (moths and butterflies), while other "cyt" selectively target <a href="Coleoptera">Coleoptera</a>. As a toxic mechanism, "cry" proteins bind to specific receptors on the membranes of mid-gut (<a href="epithelial">epithelial</a>) cells, resulting in rupture of those cells. Any organism that lacks the appropriate gut receptors cannot be affected by the "cry" protein, and therefore Bt. Regulatory agencies assess the potential for the transgenic plant to impact nontarget organisms before approving commercial release.

A 1999 study found that in a lab environment, pollen from Bt maize dusted onto <a href="milkweed">milkweed</a> could harm the <a href="monarch%20butterfly">monarch butterfly</a>. Several groups later studied the phenomenon in both the field and the laboratory, resulting in a <a href="risk%20assessment">risk assessment</a> that concluded that any risk posed by the corn to butterfly populations under real-world conditions was negligible. A 2002 review of the scientific literature concluded that "the commercial large-scale cultivation of current Bt–maize hybrids did not pose a significant risk to the monarch population". A 2007 review found that "nontarget invertebrates are generally more abundant in Bt cotton and Bt maize fields than in nontransgenic fields managed with <a href="insecticide">insecticide</a>s. However, in comparison with insecticide-free control fields, certain nontarget taxa are less abundant in Bt fields."

<a href="Gene%20flow">Gene flow</a> is the transfer of genes and/or alleles from one species to another. Concerns focus on the interaction between GM and other maize varieties in Mexico, and of gene flow into refuges.

In 2009 the government of Mexico created a regulatory pathway for genetically modified maize, but because Mexico is the <a href="center%20of%20diversity">center of diversity</a> for maize, gene flow could affect a large fraction of the world's maize strains. A 2001 report in "Nature" presented evidence that Bt maize was cross-breeding with unmodified maize in Mexico. The data in this paper was later described as originating from an artifact. "Nature" later stated, "the evidence available is not sufficient to justify the publication of the original paper". A 2005 large-scale study failed to find any evidence of contamination in Oaxaca. However, other authors also found evidence of cross-breeding between natural maize and <a href="transgenic%20maize">transgenic maize</a>.

A 2004 study found Bt protein in kernels of refuge corn.

The French High Council of Biotechnologies Scientific Committee reviewed the 2009 Vendômois "et al." study and concluded that it "..presents no admissible scientific element likely to ascribe any haematological, hepatic or renal toxicity to the three re-analysed GMOs." However, the French government applies the <a href="precautionary%20principle">precautionary principle</a> with respect to GMOs.

A review by Food Standards Australia New Zealand and others of the same study concluded that the results were due to chance alone.

A 2011 Canadian study looked at the presence of CryAb1 protein (BT toxin) in non-pregnant women, pregnant women and fetal blood. All groups had detectable levels of the protein, including 93% of pregnant women and 80% of fetuses at concentrations of 0.19 ± 0.30 and 0.04 ± 0.04 mean ± SD ng/ml, respectively. The paper did not discuss safety implications or find any health problems. The paper was found to be unconvincing by multiple authors and organizations. In a swine model, Cry1Ab-specific antibodies were not detected in pregnant sows or their offspring and no negative effects from feeding Bt maize to pregnant sows were observed.

In January 2013, the <a href="European%20Food%20Safety%20Authority">European Food Safety Authority</a> released all data submitted by Monsanto in relation to the 2003 authorisation of maize genetically modified for glyphosate tolerance.

StarLink contains Cry9C, which had not previously been used in a GM crop. Starlink's creator, <a href="Plant%20Genetic%20Systems">Plant Genetic Systems</a> had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market Starlink for use in animal feed and in human food. However, because the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic. As a result, PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in <a href="compound%20feed">animal feed</a>. Starlink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998.

StarLink corn was subsequently found in food destined for consumption by humans in the US, Japan, and South Korea. This corn became the subject of the widely publicized <a href="Starlink%20corn%20recall">Starlink corn recall</a>, which started when <a href="Taco%20Bell">Taco Bell</a>-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain the corn. Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued. The registration for Starlink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000. (Pioneer had been bought by AgrEvo which then became Aventis CropScience at the time of the incident, which was later bought by <a href="Bayer%20CropScience">Bayer</a>

Fifty-one people reported adverse effects to the FDA; <a href="US%20Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control">US Centers for Disease Control</a> (CDC), which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to Starlink. However, the CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence of hypersensitivity to the Starlink Bt protein.

A subsequent review of these tests by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Scientific Advisory Panel points out that while "the negative results decrease the probability that the Cry9C protein is the cause of allergic symptoms in the individuals examined ... in the absence of a positive control and questions regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, it is not possible to assign a negative predictive value to this."

The US corn supply has been monitored for the presence of the Starlink Bt proteins since 2001.

In 2005, aid sent by the UN and the US to Central American nations also contained some StarLink corn. The nations involved, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala refused to accept the aid.

On December 19, 2013 six Chinese citizens were indicted in Iowa on charges of plotting to steal genetically modified seeds worth tens of millions of dollars from <a href="Monsanto">Monsanto</a> and <a href="DuPont">DuPont</a>. Mo Hailong, director of international business at the Beijing Dabeinong Technology Group Co., part of the Beijing-based <a href="DBN%20Group">DBN Group</a>, was accused of stealing <a href="trade%20secrets">trade secrets</a> after he was found digging in an Iowa cornfield.

Body substance isolation

Body substance isolation is a practice of isolating all body substances (<a href="blood">blood</a>, <a href="urine">urine</a>, <a href="feces">feces</a>, <a href="tears">tears</a>, etc.) of individuals undergoing medical treatment, particularly emergency medical treatment of those who might be infected with illnesses such as <a href="HIV">HIV</a>, or <a href="hepatitis">hepatitis</a> so as to reduce as much as possible the chances of transmitting these illnesses. BSI is similar in nature to <a href="universal%20precautions">universal precautions</a>, but goes further in isolating workers from <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s, including substances now known to carry HIV.

Practice of Universal precautions was introduced in 1985–88. In 1987, the practice of Universal precautions was adjusted by a set of rules known as body substance isolation. In 1996, both practices were replaced by the latest approach known as standard precautions (health care). Nowadays and in isolation, practice of body substance isolation has just historical significance.

Body substance isolation went further than <a href="universal%20precautions">universal precautions</a> in isolating workers from <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s, including substances now currently known to carry <a href="HIV">HIV</a>. These pathogens fall into two broad categories, bloodborne (carried in the body fluids) and airborne. The practice of BSI was common in Pre-Hospital care and <a href="emergency%20medical%20services">emergency medical services</a> due to the often unknown nature of the patient and his/her disease or medical conditions. It was a part of the National Standards Curriculum for Prehospital Providers and Firefighters.

Types of body substance isolation included:

It was postulated that BSI precautions should be practiced in environment where treaters were exposed to bodily fluids, such as:

Such infection control techniques that were recommended following the <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a> outbreak in the 1980s. Every patient was treated as if infected and therefore precautions were taken to minimize risk. Other conditions which called for minimizing risks with BSI:

or any combination of the above.
