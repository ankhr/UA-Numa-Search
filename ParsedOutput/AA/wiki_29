Brussels

Brussels (, ; , ), officially the Brussels-Capital Region (, ), is a <a href="Regions%20of%20Belgium">region of Belgium</a> comprising <a href="Brussels%23Municipalities">19 municipalities</a>, including the <a href="City%20of%20Brussels">City of Brussels</a>, which is the "<a href="de%20jure">de jure</a>" capital of <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>. The Brussels-Capital Region is located in the central portion of the country and is a part of both the <a href="French%20Community%20of%20Belgium">French Community of Belgium</a> and the <a href="Flemish%20Community">Flemish Community</a>, but is separate from the region of <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> (in which it forms an <a href="enclave">enclave</a>) or <a href="Wallonia">Wallonia</a>. Compared to most regions in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, Brussels has a relatively small territory, with an area of 161 km (62.31 sq mi). The region has a population of 1.2 million and a <a href="metropolitan%20area">metropolitan area</a> with a population of over 1.8 million, the largest agglomeration in Belgium. Brussels is also part of a large <a href="conurbation">conurbation</a> which extends between Brussels, <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a>, <a href="Leuven">Leuven</a> and <a href="Walloon%20Brabant">Walloon Brabant</a> and is home to over 5 million people.

Brussels has grown from a small rural settlement on the river <a href="Zenne">Senne</a> to become an important city-region in Europe. Since the end of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, Brussels has been a major centre for <a href="International%20relations">international politics</a> and has become the home of numerous international organizations, politicians, diplomats and civil servants. Brussels is the "<a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>" capital of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, as it hosts a number of principal <a href="Institutions%20of%20the%20European%20Union">EU institutions</a> (the other administrative centres are <a href="Luxembourg%20City">Luxembourg</a> and <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>).<ref name="12010E/PRO/06"></ref> The name "Brussels" is sometimes used <a href="Metonymy">metonymically</a> to describe the EU and its institutions. The secretariat of the <a href="Benelux">Benelux</a> and the headquarters of the <a href="NATO">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a> (NATO) are also located in Brussels. Today, it is classified as an "Alpha" <a href="global%20city">global city</a>.

Historically a Dutch-speaking city, Brussels has seen a <a href="Francisation%20of%20Brussels">language shift to French</a> from the late 19th century onwards. Today, the majority language is <a href="French%20language">French</a>, and the Brussels-Capital Region is an officially bilingual enclave within the <a href="Flemish%20Region">Flemish Region</a>. All <a href="road%20sign">road sign</a>s, street names, and many advertisements and services are shown in both languages. Brussels is increasingly becoming multilingual, being home to many international institutions. English is also spoken by some of the population, while a large number of migrants and <a href="expatriate">expatriate</a>s speak other languages, namely <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>, <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, <a href="German%20language">German</a> and <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>.

The most common theory of the origin of the name "Brussels" is that it derives from the <a href="Old%20Dutch">Old Dutch</a> "Broekzele" or "Broeksel", meaning marsh ("broek") and home ("zele" / "sel") or "home in the marsh". <a href="Saint%20Vindicianus">Saint Vindicianus</a>, the bishop of <a href="Cambrai">Cambrai</a> made the first recorded reference to the place "Brosella," in 695, when it was still a <a href="Hamlet%20%28place%29">hamlet</a>.

In French, its name is pronounced [bʁy.sɛl] (the "x" is pronounced [s] ("ss"), like in English). Indeed, if the written "x" originally noted the group /ks/, up until the 12th century, thereafter, "c" [k] was assimilated to the subsequent "s", hence the double "ss" in the Dutch form, whereas in the more conservative French form, the spelling remained.

Inhabitants of Brussels are known in French as "Bruxellois" and in Dutch as "Brusselaars." In the dialect of Brussels, they are called "Brusseleers." The pronunciation [ks] in French only dates from the 18th century, but this modification did not affect the traditional Brussels usage. In France, the pronunciation "Bru/ks/elles" and "bru/ks/ellois(e)" is often heard, but it is rather rare in Belgium.

During <a href="Late%20antiquity">Antiquity</a>, the region now known as Brussels was already home to <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> occupation, as attested by archeological evidence discovered near the centre. The origin of the settlement which was to become Brussels lies in <a href="Gaugericus">Saint Gaugericus</a>' construction of a chapel on <a href="Saint%20Gaugericus%20Island">an island</a> in the river <a href="Zenne">Senne</a>, around 580. The official founding of Brussels is usually situated around 979, when <a href="Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Lower%20Lotharingia">Duke Charles of Lower Lotharingia</a> transferred the relics of Saint <a href="Gudula">Gudula</a> from <a href="Moorsel">Moorsel</a> to the Saint Gaugericus chapel. Charles would construct the first permanent fortification in the city, doing so on that same island.

<a href="Lambert%20I%20of%20Leuven">Lambert I of Leuven</a>, Count of <a href="County%20of%20Leuven">Leuven</a>, gained the County of Brussels, around 1000, by marrying Charles' daughter. Because of its location on the shores of the <a href="Zenne">Senne</a>, on an important trade route between <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> and <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a>, and <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, Brussels became a commercial centre, specialised in the textile trade. The town grew quite rapidly and extended towards the upper town ("Treurenberg", "<a href="Coudenberg">Coudenberg</a>" and <a href="Sablon%20%28Brussels%29">"Sablon"</a> areas), where there was a smaller risk of floods. As it grew to a population of around 30,000, the surrounding marshes were drained to allow for further expansion. Around this time, work began on the <a href="Cathedral%20of%20St.%20Michael%20and%20St.%20Gudula">Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula</a> (1225), replacing an older <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> church. In 1183, the Counts of Leuven became <a href="Duke%20of%20Brabant">Dukes of Brabant</a>. Brabant, unlike the county of Flanders, was not fief of the king of France but was incorporated into the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. In the early 13th century, the city got <a href="Fortifications%20of%20Brussels">its first walls</a>.
After the construction of the city walls, Brussels grew significantly. To let the city expand, <a href="second%20walls%20of%20Brussels">a second set of walls</a> was erected, between 1356 and 1383. Today, traces of it can still be seen, mostly because the "<a href="small%20ring">small ring</a>", a series of roadways in downtown Brussels, bounding the historic city centre, follows its former course.

In the 15th century, by means of the wedding of heiress <a href="Margaret%20III%20of%20Flanders">Margaret III of Flanders</a> with <a href="Philip%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Burgundy">Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy</a>, a new Duke of Brabant emerged from the House of <a href="Valois%20Dynasty">Valois</a> (namely <a href="Antoine%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brabant">Antoine</a>, their son). In 1477, the Burgundian duke <a href="Charles%20the%20Bold">Charles the Bold</a> perished in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nancy">Battle of Nancy</a>. Through the marriage of his daughter <a href="Mary%20of%20Burgundy">Mary of Burgundy</a> (who was born in Brussels) to Holy Roman Emperor <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian I</a>, the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a> fell under <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> sovereignty. Brabant had lost its independence, but Brussels became the Princely Capital of the prosperous <a href="Burgundian%20Netherlands">Burgundian Netherlands</a>, also known as the <a href="Seventeen%20Provinces">Seventeen Provinces</a>, and flourished. After the death of Mary, in 1482, her son <a href="Philip%20I%20of%20Castile">Philip the Handsome</a> succeeded as the Duke of Brabant. In 1506, he became <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">King of Castile</a>, and hence the period of the <a href="Spanish%20Netherlands">Spanish Netherlands</a> began.

In 1516, <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a>, who had been heir of the Low Countries since 1506, was declared <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Spain">King of Spain</a> in <a href="St.%20Michael%20and%20St.%20Gudula%20Cathedral">St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral</a>, in Brussels. Upon the death of his grandfather, <a href="Maximilian%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, in 1519, Charles became the new ruler of the <a href="Habsburg%20Empire">Habsburg Empire</a> and was subsequently elected <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>. It was in <a href="Coudenberg">the Palace complex at Coudenberg</a> that Charles V abdicated, in 1555. This impressive palace, famous all over Europe, had greatly expanded since it had first become the seat of the Dukes of Brabant, but it was destroyed by fire, in 1731. In the 17th century, the city was a capital of the <a href="lace">lace</a> industry.

In 1695, during the <a href="Nine%20Years%27%20War">Nine Years' War</a>, King <a href="Louis%20XIV">Louis XIV</a> of France sent troops to <a href="bombardment%20of%20Brussels">bombard Brussels with artillery</a>. Together with the resulting fire, it was the most destructive event in the entire history of Brussels. The <a href="Grand%20Place">Grand Place</a> was destroyed, along with 4,000 buildings – a third of all the buildings in the city. The reconstruction of <a href="pentagon%20%28Brussels%29">the city centre</a>, effected during subsequent years, profoundly changed the appearance of the city and left numerous traces still visible today. 

Following the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Utrecht">Treaty of Utrecht</a>, in 1713, the Spanish sovereignty over the Southern Netherlands was transferred to the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg. This event started the era of the <a href="Austrian%20Netherlands">Austrian Netherlands</a>. The city <a href="Siege%20of%20Brussels">was captured</a> by France, in 1746, during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Austrian%20Succession">War of the Austrian Succession</a>, but was handed back to Austria three years later. Brussels remained with Austria until 1795, when the Southern Netherlands were captured and annexed by France. Brussels became the capital of the <a href="Dyle%20%28department%29">department of the Dyle</a>. The French rule ended in 1815, with the defeat of <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> on the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">battlefield of Waterloo</a>, which is located south of today's Brussels-Capital Region. With the <a href="Congress%20of%20Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a>, the Southern Netherlands joined the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20the%20Netherlands">United Kingdom of the Netherlands</a>, under <a href="William%20I%20of%20the%20Netherlands">William I of Orange</a>. The former Dyle department became the province of South Brabant, with Brussels as its capital.

In 1830, the <a href="Belgian%20revolution">Belgian revolution</a> took place in Brussels, after a performance of <a href="Daniel-Francois-Esprit%20Auber">Auber's</a> opera "<a href="La%20Muette%20de%20Portici">La Muette de Portici</a>" at <a href="La%20Monnaie">La Monnaie</a> theatre. Brussels became the capital and seat of government of the new nation. South Brabant was renamed simply <a href="Province%20of%20Brabant">Brabant</a>, with Brussels as its capital. On 21 July 1831, <a href="Leopold%20I%20of%20Belgium">Leopold I</a>, the first <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Belgium">King of the Belgians</a>, ascended the throne, undertaking the destruction of the city walls and the construction of many buildings.

Following independence, the city underwent many more changes. Brussels became a financial centre, thanks to the dozens of companies put into orbit by the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20de%20Belgique">Société Générale de Belgique</a>. The <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> and the building of the <a href="Brussels-Charleroi%20Canal">Brussels-Charleroi Canal</a> brought prosperity to the city through commerce and manufacturing. The <a href="Free%20University%20of%20Brussels">Free University of Brussels</a> was established in 1834. In 1835, the first passenger railway built outside England linked Brussels (<a href="Sint-Jans-Molenbeek">Molenbeek</a>) with <a href="Mechelen">Mechelen</a>.

During the 19th century, the population of Brussels grew considerably; from about 80,000 to more than 625,000 people for the city and its surroundings. The <a href="Senne">Senne</a> had become a serious <a href="health%20hazard">health hazard</a>, and from 1867 to 1871, under the tenure of mayor <a href="Jules%20Anspach">Jules Anspach</a>, its entire course through the urban area was <a href="covering%20of%20the%20Senne">completely covered over</a>. This allowed <a href="urban%20renewal">urban renewal</a> and the construction of modern buildings of "<a href="Georges-Eug%C3%A8ne%20Haussmann">hausmannien</a>" style along central boulevards, characteristic of downtown Brussels today. Buildings such as the <a href="Brussels%20Stock%20Exchange">Brussels Stock Exchange</a> (1873), the <a href="Palais%20de%20Justice%2C%20Brussels">Palace of Justice</a> (1883) and <a href="Saint%20Mary%27s%20Royal%20Church">Saint Mary's Royal Church</a> (1885) date from this period. This development continued throughout the reign of <a href="Leopold%20II%20of%20Belgium">King Leopold II</a>. The <a href="Brussels%20International%20Exposition%20%281897%29">International Exposition of 1897</a> contributed to the promotion of the infrastructure. Among other things, the Colonial Palace (today's <a href="Royal%20Museum%20for%20Central%20Africa">Royal Museum for Central Africa</a>), in the suburb of <a href="Tervuren">Tervuren</a>, was connected to the capital by the construction of an 11-km long grand alley.

During the 20th century, the city hosted various fairs and conferences, including the <a href="Solvay%20Conference">Solvay Conference</a> on Physics and on Chemistry, and two world fairs: the <a href="Brussels%20International%20Exposition%20%281935%29">Brussels International Exposition of 1935</a> and the <a href="Expo%20%2758">Expo '58</a>. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Brussels was an <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Belgium%20during%20World%20War%20I">occupied</a> city, but German troops did not cause much damage. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the city was again <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Belgium%20during%20World%20War%20II">occupied</a>, and was spared major damage during its occupation by German forces, before it was liberated by the British <a href="Guards%20Armoured%20Division">Guards Armoured Division</a>, on 3 September 1944. The <a href="Brussels%20Airport">Brussels Airport</a>, in the suburb of <a href="Zaventem">Zaventem</a>, dates from the occupation.

After the war, Brussels underwent extensive modernization. The construction of the <a href="North%E2%80%93South%20connection">North–South connection</a>, linking the main railway stations in the city, was completed in 1952, while the first <a href="Brussels%20premetro">Brussels "premetro"</a> was finished in 1969, and the first line of the <a href="Brussels%20Metro">Brussels Metro</a> was opened in 1976. Starting from the early 1960s, Brussels became the "de facto" capital of what would become the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, and many modern buildings were built. Development was allowed to proceed with little regard to the aesthetics of newer buildings, and many architectural landmarks were demolished to make way for newer buildings that often clashed with their surroundings, giving name to the process of "<a href="Brusselization">Brusselization</a>".

The Brussels-Capital Region was formed on 18 June 1989, after a constitutional reform in 1988. It has bilingual status and it is one of the three <a href="Communities%2C%20regions%20and%20language%20areas%20of%20Belgium">federal regions of Belgium</a>, along with <a href="Flanders">Flanders</a> and <a href="Wallonia">Wallonia</a>. The <a href="yellow%20iris">yellow iris</a> is the emblem of the region (due to the presence of these flowers on the original site of the city) and a stylized version in shown on the official flag of Brussels.

In recent years, Brussels has become an important venue for international events. In 2000, Brussels, along with eight other European cities, was named <a href="European%20Capital%20of%20Culture">European Capital of Culture</a>. In 2014, Brussels hosted the <a href="40th%20G7%20summit">40th G7 summit</a>. It is among the cities which will host the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202020">UEFA Euro 2020</a>.

<a href="2016%20Brussels%20bombings">On 22 March 2016</a>, three coordinated <a href="nail%20bomb">nail bomb</a>ings were detonated by <a href="Islamic%20State%20of%20Iraq%20and%20the%20Levant">ISIL</a> in Brussels – two at <a href="Brussels%20Airport">Brussels Airport</a> in <a href="Zaventem">Zaventem</a>, and one at <a href="Maalbeek/Maelbeek%20metro%20station">Maalbeek/Maelbeek metro station</a>, – resulting in 32 victims and three <a href="Suicide%20bombing">suicide bombers</a> killed, and 330 people were injured. It was the deadliest act of <a href="terrorism">terrorism</a> in Belgium.

Brussels lies in the north-central part of Belgium, about 110 km (68 mi) from the Belgian coast and about 180 km (111 mi) from the southern tip of Belgium. It is located in the heartland of the Brabantian Plateau, about 45 km (28 mi) south of <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> (<a href="Flanders">Flanders</a>), and 50 km (31 mi) north of <a href="Charleroi">Charleroi</a> (<a href="Wallonia">Wallonia</a>). Its average <a href="elevation">elevation</a> is 57 meters (187 ft) above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>, varying from a low point in the valley of the almost completely covered <a href="Zenne">Senne</a>, which cuts the region from east to west, up to high points in the <a href="Sonian%C2%A0Forest">Sonian Forest</a>, at the southeastern side. In addition to the Senne, tributary streams such as the <a href="Maalbeek">Maalbeek</a> and the <a href="Woluwe">Woluwe</a>, to the east of the region, account for significant elevation differences. Brussels' central boulevards are 15 meters above sea level. The highest point lies at a height of about 108 meters (354 ft), near "Place de l'Altitude Cent"/"Hoogte Honderdplein", in <a href="Forest%2C%20Belgium">Forest</a>.

Under the <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a>, Brussels experiences an <a href="oceanic%20climate">oceanic climate</a> (Cfb). Brussels' proximity to coastal areas influences the area's climate by sending marine air masses from the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>. Nearby wetlands also ensure a maritime temperate climate. On average (based on measurements over the last 100 years), there are approximately 200 days of rain per year in the Brussels-Capital Region, the second highest amount of any European capital, after <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> (Ireland). Snowfall is infrequent, averaging 24 days per year. In Brussels, there are often violent thunderstorms.

Despite what its name suggests, the Brussels-Capital Region is not the capital of <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> in itself. Article 194 of the <a href="Belgian%20Constitution">Belgian Constitution</a> establishes that the capital of Belgium is the <a href="City%20of%20Brussels">City of Brussels</a>, the municipality within the capital region that once was the city's core.

The City of Brussels is the location of many national institutions. The <a href="Royal%20Palace%20of%20Brussels">Royal Palace</a>, where the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Belgium">King of Belgium</a> exercises his prerogatives as head of state, is situated alongside the <a href="Brussels%20Park">Brussels Park</a> (not to be confused with the <a href="Royal%20Castle%20of%20Laeken">Royal Castle of Laeken</a>, official home of the Belgian Royal Family). The <a href="Belgian%20Federal%20Parliament">Palace of the Nation</a> is located on the opposite side of this park, and is the seat of the <a href="Belgian%20Federal%20Parliament">Belgian Federal Parliament</a>. The office of the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Belgium">Prime Minister of Belgium</a>, colloquially called "Law Street 16" (Dutch: "Wetstraat 16", French: "16, rue de la Loi"), is located adjacent to this building. This is also the place where the <a href="Council%20of%20Ministers%20%28Belgium%29">Council of Ministers</a> holds its meetings. The <a href="Court%20of%20Cassation%20%28Belgium%29">Court of Cassation</a>, Belgium's main court, has its seat in the <a href="Palace%20of%20Justice%20%28Brussels%29">Palace of Justice</a>. Other important institutions in the City of Brussels are the <a href="Constitutional%20Court%20of%20Belgium">Constitutional Court</a>, the <a href="Council%20of%20State%20%28Belgium%29">Council of State</a>, the <a href="Court%20of%20Audit%20of%20Belgium">Court of Audit</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Belgian%20Mint">Royal Belgian Mint</a> and the <a href="National%20Bank%20of%20Belgium">National Bank of Belgium</a>.

The City of Brussels is also the capital of both the <a href="French%20Community%20of%20Belgium">French Community of Belgium</a> and the <a href="Flemish%20Community">Flemish Community</a>. The <a href="Flemish%20Parliament">Flemish Parliament</a> and <a href="Flemish%20Government">Flemish Government</a> have their seats in Brussels, as do the <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20French%20Community">Parliament of the French Community</a> and the <a href="Government%20of%20the%20French%20Community">Government of the French Community</a>.

The 19 <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Belgium">municipalities</a> (communes) of the Brussels-Capital <a href="Communities%2C%20regions%20and%20language%20areas%20of%20Belgium%23Regions">Region</a> are political subdivisions with individual responsibilities for the handling of local level duties, such as law enforcement and the upkeep of schools and roads within its borders. Municipal administration is also conducted by a mayor, a council, and an executive.

In 1831, Belgium was divided into 2,739 municipalities, including the 19 in the Brussels-Capital Region. Unlike most of the municipalities in Belgium, the ones located in the Brussels-Capital Region were not merged with others during mergers occurring in 1964, 1970, and 1975. However, several municipalities outside of the Brussels-Capital Region have been merged with the <a href="City%20of%20Brussels">City of Brussels</a> throughout its history, including <a href="Laeken">Laeken</a>, <a href="Haren%2C%20Belgium">Haren</a>, and <a href="Neder-Over-Heembeek">Neder-Over-Heembeek</a>, which were merged into the City of Brussels in 1921.

The largest and most populous of the municipalities is the City of Brussels, covering and with 145,917 inhabitants. The least populous is <a href="Koekelberg">Koekelberg</a> with 18,541 inhabitants, while the smallest in area is <a href="Saint-Josse-ten-Noode">Saint-Josse-ten-Noode</a>, which is only . Despite being the smallest municipality, Saint-Josse-ten-Noode has the highest population density of the 19, with .

A lot of controversy exists concerning the division of 19 municipalities for a highly urbanized region, which is considered as (half of) one city by most people. Some politicians mock the '19 baronies' and want to merge the municipalities under one city council and one mayor. This would lower the number of politicians needed to govern Brussels, and centralise the power over the city to make decisions easier, thus reduce the overall running costs. The current municipalities could be transformed into districts with limited responsibilities, similar to the current structure of <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> or to structures of other capitals like the <a href="London%20boroughs">boroughs</a> in <a href="London">London</a> or "arrondissements" in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, to keep politics close enough to the citizen.
The commune of <a href="Sint-Jans-Molenbeek">Molenbeek</a> has gained a reputation as a safe haven for <a href="Jihadism">Jihadists</a> in relation to the support shown by some residents towards the bombers who carried out the Paris and Brussels attacks.

The Brussels-Capital Region is one of the three federated regions of Belgium, alongside the <a href="Wallonia">Walloon Region</a> and the <a href="Flemish%20Region">Flemish Region</a>. Geographically and linguistically, it is a bilingual <a href="enclave">enclave</a> in the monolingual Flemish Region. Regions are one component of Belgium's institutions, the three communities being the other component: Brussels' inhabitants deal with either the <a href="French%20Community%20of%20Belgium">French Community</a> or the <a href="Flemish%20Community">Flemish Community</a> for matters such as culture and education, as well as a <a href="Common%20Community%20Commission">Common Community</a> for competencies which do not belong exclusively to either Community, such as healthcare and assistance to individuals.

Since the splitting of <a href="Brabant%20%28province%29">Brabant</a> in 1995, the Brussels Region does not belong to any of the <a href="Provinces%20of%20Belgium">provinces</a> of Belgium. Within the Region, most of the provincial competencies are assumed by the Brussels regional institutions and community commissions. Additionally, there is a <a href="governor%20of%20Brussels-Capital">governor of Brussels-Capital</a>, analogously to provinces.

The Brussels-Capital Region is governed by a parliament of 89 members (72 French-speaking, 17 Dutch-speaking, parties are organised on a linguistic basis) and an eight-member regional cabinet consisting of a minister-president, four ministers and three state secretaries. By law, the cabinet must comprise two French-speaking and two Dutch-speaking ministers, one Dutch-speaking secretary of state and two French-speaking secretaries of state. The minister-president does not count against the language quota, but in practice every minister-president has been a bilingual francophone. The regional parliament can enact ordinances (French: "ordonnances", Dutch: "ordonnanties"), which have equal status as a national legislative act.

19 of the 72 French-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament are also members of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20French%20Community%20of%20Belgium">Parliament of the French Community of Belgium</a>, and, until 2004, this was also the case for six Dutch-speaking members, who were at the same time members of the <a href="Flemish%20Parliament">Flemish Parliament</a>. Now, people voting for a Flemish party have to vote separately for 6 directly elected members of the Flemish Parliament.

The Brussels Region is the only one in Belgium that is not subdivided into provinces, nor is it a province itself. Within the Region, 99% of the areas of provincial jurisdiction are assumed by the Brussels regional institutions. Remaining is only the <a href="governor%20of%20Brussels-Capital">governor of Brussels-Capital</a> and some aides. Its status is roughly akin to that of a <a href="federal%20district">federal district</a>.

Before the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, regional competences in the 19 municipalities were performed by the "Brussels Agglomeration". The "Brussels Agglomeration" was an administrative division established in 1971. This decentralised administrative public body also assumed jurisdiction over areas which, elsewhere in Belgium, were exercised by municipalities or provinces.

The "Brussels Agglomeration" had a separate legislative council, but the by-laws enacted by it did not have the status of a legislative act. The only election of the council took place on 21 November 1971. The working of the council was subject to many difficulties caused by the linguistic and socio-economic tensions between the two communities.

After the creation of the Brussels-Capital Region, the "Brussels Agglomeration" was never formally abolished, although it no longer has a purpose.

The <a href="French%20Community%20of%20Belgium">French Community</a> and the <a href="Flemish%20Community">Flemish Community</a> exercise their powers in Brussels through two community-specific public authorities: the <a href="French%20Community%20Commission">French Community Commission</a> (French: "Commission communautaire française" or "COCOF") and the <a href="Flemish%20Community%20Commission">Flemish Community Commission</a> (Dutch: "Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie" or "VGC"). These two bodies each have an assembly composed of the members of each linguistic group of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20Brussels-Capital%20Region">Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region</a>. They also have a board composed of the ministers and secretaries of state of each linguistic group in the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region.

The French Community Commission has also another capacity: some legislative powers of the French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the French Community Commission (for the bilingual language area). The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community. This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical federalism. Because of this devolution, the French Community Commission can enact <a href="decree">decree</a>s, which are legislative acts.

A bi-communitarian public authority, the <a href="Common%20Community%20Commission">Common Community Commission</a> (French: "Commission communautaire commune, COCOM", Dutch: "Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie, GGC") also exists. Its assembly is composed of the members of the regional parliament, and its board are the ministers – not the secretaries of state – of the region, with the minister-president not having the right to vote. This Commission has two capacities: it is a decentralised administrative public body, responsible for implementing cultural policies of common interest. It can give subsidies and enact by-laws. In another capacity, it can also enact ordinances, which have equal status as a national legislative act, in the field of the welfare powers of the communities: in the Brussels-Capital Region, both the French Community and the Flemish Community can exercise powers in the field of welfare, but only in regard to institutions that are unilingual (for example, a private French-speaking retirement home or the Dutch-speaking hospital of the <a href="Vrije%20Universiteit%20Brussel">Vrije Universiteit Brussel</a>). The Common Community Commission is responsible for policies aiming directly at private persons or at bilingual institutions (for example, the centres for social welfare of the 19 municipalities). Its ordinances have to be enacted with a majority in both linguistic groups. Failing such a majority, a new vote can be held, where a majority of at least one third in each linguistic group is sufficient.

Brussels has, since <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, become the administrative centre of many international organizations. The <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> (EU) and the <a href="NATO">North Atlantic Treaty Organisation</a> (NATO) have their main institutions in the city, along with many other international organisations such as the <a href="World%20Customs%20Organization">World Customs Organization</a> and <a href="EUROCONTROL">EUROCONTROL</a> as well as international corporations. Brussels is third in the number of international conferences it hosts also becoming one of the largest convention centres in the world. The presence of the EU and the other international bodies has, for example, led to there being more ambassadors and journalists in Brussels than in Washington D.C. International schools have also been established to serve this presence. The "international community" in Brussels numbers at least 70,000 people. In 2009, there were an estimated 286 lobbying consultancies known to work in Brussels.

Brussels serves as capital of the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>, hosting the major political <a href="Institutions%20of%20the%20European%20Union">institutions of the Union</a>. The EU has not declared a capital formally, though the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Amsterdam">Treaty of Amsterdam</a> formally gives Brussels the seat of the <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a> (the executive/government branch) and the <a href="Council%20of%20the%20European%20Union">Council of the European Union</a> (a legislative institution made up from executives of member states). It locates the formal seat of <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a> in the French city of <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>, where votes take place, with the Council, on the proposals made by the Commission. However, meetings of political groups and committee groups are formally given to Brussels, along with a set number of plenary sessions. Three quarters of Parliament sessions now take place at its <a href="Espace%20L%C3%A9opold">Brussels hemicycle</a>. Between 2002 and 2004, the <a href="European%20Council">European Council</a> also fixed its seat in the city. In 2014, the Union hosted a <a href="40th%20G7%20summit">G7 summit</a> in the city.

Brussels, along with <a href="Luxembourg%20%28city%29">Luxembourg</a> and Strasbourg, began to host European institutions in 1957, soon becoming the centre of activities, as the Commission and Council based their activities in what has become the <a href="Brussels%20and%20the%20European%20Union">"European Quarter"</a>, in the east of the city. Early building in Brussels was sporadic and uncontrolled, with little planning. The current major buildings are the <a href="Berlaymont%20building">Berlaymont building</a> of the Commission, symbolic of the quarter as a whole, the <a href="Justus%20Lipsius%20building">Justus Lipsius building</a> of the Council and the <a href="Espace%20L%C3%A9opold">Espace Léopold</a> of the Parliament. Today, the presence has increased considerably, with the Commission alone occupying 865,000 m within the "European Quarter" (a quarter of the total office space in Brussels). The concentration and density has caused concern that the presence of the institutions has created a "<a href="ghetto">ghetto</a> effect" in that part of the city. However, the European presence has contributed significantly to the importance of Brussels as an international centre.

The European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation, commonly known as Eurocontrol, is an <a href="international%20organisation">international organisation</a> which is tasked to monitor the European aviation by flight. Eurocontrol coordinates and plans <a href="air%20traffic%20control">air traffic control</a> across European <a href="airspace">airspace</a>. The corporation was founded in 1960 and currently has 41 member states. Its headquarters are located in <a href="Haren%2C%20Belgium">Haren</a>, on the northeast perimeter of the <a href="City%20of%20Brussels">City of Brussels</a>.

The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Brussels">Treaty of Brussels</a>, which was signed on 17 March 1948 between Belgium, <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, was a prelude to the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), an <a href="Intergovernmental%20organization">intergovernmental</a> <a href="military%20alliance">military alliance</a>, and was a preview of the western European defense against <a href="communism">communism</a>.

Today, the alliance consists of 29 independent member countries across <a href="North%20America">North America</a> and Europe. Several countries also have diplomatic missions to NATO <a href="List%20of%20diplomatic%20missions%20to%20NATO">through embassies in Belgium</a>. Since 1949, a number of <a href="NATO%20summit">NATO Summits</a> have been held in the city. The most recent NATO summit took place in Brussels in May 2017.

The organisation's headquarters are located on Boulevard Léopold III/Leopold III-laan in <a href="Haren%2C%20Belgium">Haren</a>, Brussels. A new €750 million headquarters building begun in 2010 and was completed in 2017.

Brussels is located in one of the most <a href="Blue%20Banana">urbanised regions of Europe</a>, between <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="London">London</a>, the <a href="Rhine-Ruhr">Rhine-Ruhr</a>, and the <a href="Randstad">Randstad</a>. The Brussels-Capital Region has a population of around 1.2 million and has witnessed, in recent years, a remarkable increase in its population. In general, the population of Brussels is younger than the national average, and the gap between rich and poor is wider. 

Brussels is home to a large number of immigrants. At the last Belgian census, in 1991, 63.7% of inhabitants in Brussels-Capital Region answered that they were Belgian citizens, born as such in Belgium. However, there have been numerous individual or familial migrations towards Brussels, since the end of the 18th century, including <a href="Right%20of%20asylum">political refugees</a> (<a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a>, <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>, <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon">Pierre Joseph Proudhon</a>, <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Daudet">Léon Daudet</a>, for example), from neighbouring or more distant countries, as well as labour migrants, former foreign students or expatriates, and many Belgian families in Brussels can claim at least one foreign grandparent.

Brussels has a large concentration of immigrants from other countries, and their children, including many of Moroccan (<a href="Riffian%20people">Riffian</a>, <a href="Berbers">Berber</a>) and Turkish ancestry, together with French-speaking black Africans from former <a href="Belgian%20overseas%20colonies">Belgian colonies</a>, such as the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, <a href="Rwanda">Rwanda</a> and <a href="Burundi">Burundi</a>.

People of foreign origin make up nearly 70% of the population of Brussels, most of whom have been <a href="Naturalization">naturalized</a> following the great 1991 reform of the naturalization process. About 32% of city residents are of non-Belgian <a href="Europe">Europe</a>an origin, and 36% are of another background, mostly from <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> and Sub-Saharan <a href="Africa">Africa</a>. Among all major migrant groups from outside the EU, a majority of the permanent residents have acquired Belgian nationality.

Since the founding of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Belgium">Kingdom of Belgium</a>, in 1830, Brussels has transformed from being almost entirely <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch-speaking</a> (<a href="Brabantian">Brabantian</a> dialect to be exact), to being a multilingual city with French (specifically <a href="Belgian%20French">Belgian French</a>) as the majority language and "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>". This language shift, the <a href="Francization%20of%20Brussels">"Francization" of Brussels</a>, is rooted in the 18th century and accelerated after <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> became <a href="Belgian%20revolution">independent</a> and Brussels expanded past its original boundaries.

French-speaking immigration contributed to the "Frenchification" of Brussels; both Walloons and expatriates from other countries – mainly France – came to Brussels in great numbers. However, a more important cause for the "Frenchification" was the language change over several generations from Dutch to French that was carried out, in Brussels, by the <a href="Flemish%20people">Flemish people</a> themselves. The main reason for this was a political, administrative and social pressure, partly based on the low social prestige of the Dutch language in Belgium at the time; this made French the only language of administration, law, politics and education in Belgium, and thus necessary for social mobility. From 1880 on, faced with the necessity of using French in dealing with such institutions, more and more Dutch-speakers became bilingual, and a rise in the number of monolingual French-speakers was seen after 1910. Halfway through the 20th century, the number of monolingual French-speakers surpassed the number of mostly bilingual Flemish inhabitants.

Only since the 1960s, after the fixation of the Belgian <a href="Communities%2C%20regions%20and%20language%20areas%20of%20Belgium">language border</a>, and after the socio-economic development of Flanders was in full effect, could Dutch stem the tide of increasing French use. Through immigration, a further number of formerly Dutch-speaking municipalities in surrounding Brussels became majoritively French-speaking in the second half of the 20th century. This phenomenon is, together with the future of Brussels, one of the most controversial topics in all of <a href="Belgian%20politics">Belgian politics</a>.

Given its Dutch-speaking origins and the role that Brussels plays as the capital city in a bilingual country, the administration of the entire Brussels-Capital Region is fully bilingual, including its subdivisions and public services. Nevertheless, some communautarian issues remain. Flemish political parties demanded, for decades, that the Flemish part of <a href="Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde">Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde</a> "arrondissement" be separated from the Brussels Region (which made Halle-Vilvoorde a monolingual Flemish "arrondissement"). BHV was divided mid 2012. The French-speaking population regards the language border as artificial and demands the extension of the bilingual region to at least all six <a href="municipalities%20with%20language%20facilities">municipalities with language facilities</a> in the surroundings of Brussels. Flemish politicians have strongly rejected these proposals.

The original Dutch dialect of Brussels ("Brussels") is a form of <a href="Brabantic">Brabantic</a> (the variant of Dutch spoken in the ancient <a href="Duchy%20of%20Brabant">Duchy of Brabant</a>) with a significant number of loanwords from French, and still survives among a minority of inhabitants called "Brusseleers", many of them quite bi- and multilingual, or educated in French and not writing in Dutch. Brussels and its suburbs have evolved from a Dutch-dialect-speaking town to a mainly French-speaking town. The ethnic and national self-identification of the inhabitants is quite different along ethnic lines.

For their French-speaking "Bruxellois", it can vary from Belgian, Francophone Belgian, "Bruxellois" (like the Memellanders in interwar ethnic censuses in <a href="Klaip%C4%97da">Memel</a>), <a href="Walloons">Walloon</a> (for people who migrated from the Wallonia Region at an adult age); for Flemings living in Brussels, it is mainly either Flemish or "Brusselaar" (Dutch for an inhabitant), and often both. For the "Brusseleers", many simply consider themselves as belonging to Brussels. For the many rather recent immigrants from other countries, the identification also includes all the national origins: people tend to call themselves Moroccans or Turks rather than an American-style hyphenated version.

The two largest foreign groups come from two <a href="Francophonie">francophone</a> countries: France and <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>. The first language of roughly half of the inhabitants is not an official one of the Capital Region. Nevertheless, about three out of four residents are Belgian nationals.

In recent decades, owing to migration and the city's international role, Brussels is home to a growing number of foreign language speakers. In 2013, figures cited in the Marnix Plan show that 63.2% of Brussels inhabitants are native speakers of French, while less than 20% are native Dutch speakers. Just 2.5% speak English as their mother tongue, but 29.7% of people living in the city claim to speak English well or very well. Even though some people want English to be used as an unofficial compromise language between Dutch and French, French remains the "lingua franca". And laws still require Dutch and French translations in most cases. The acceptance of English as a language for communication with the city's public servants depends entirely on their knowledge of this language, though they must accept questions in French and Dutch.

The migrant communities, as well as rapidly growing communities of EU-nationals from other EU-member states, speak many languages like French, <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a>, <a href="Arabic%20languages">Arabic</a>, <a href="Berber%20languages">Berber</a>, <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>, <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>, <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a>, <a href="German%20language">German</a>, and (increasingly) <a href="English%20language">English</a>. The degree of linguistic integration varies widely within each migrant group.

Although historically majoritively <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a>, especially since the expulsion of Protestants in the 16th century, most residents of Brussels are nonreligious, with only about 10% of Catholics regularly attending church services. In reflection of its multicultural makeup, it hosts a variety of religious communities, as well as large numbers of <a href="atheism">atheists</a> and <a href="agnosticism">agnostics</a>. Minority faiths include <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="Anglicanism">Anglicanism</a>, <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodoxy</a>, <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>, and <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>.

Recognized religions and "<a href="La%C3%AFcit%C3%A9">Laïcité</a>" enjoy public funding and school courses. It was once the case that every pupil in an official school from 6 years old to 18 had to choose 2 hours per week of compulsory religion – or "Laïcité –" inspired morals. However, in 2015, the Belgian Constitutional court ruled religious studies could no longer be required in the primary and secondary education system.

Brussels has a large concentration of <a href="Islam%20in%20Belgium">Muslims</a>, mostly of Moroccan and Turkish ancestry. Belgium does not collect statistics by ethnic background, so exact figures are unknown. It was estimated that, in 2005, people of Muslim background living in the Brussels Region numbered 256,220 and accounted for 25.5% of the city's population, a much higher concentration than those of the other regions of Belgium.

In 2016, 40% of residents of Brussels declared themselves <a href="Catholics">Catholics</a> (12% were practising Catholics and 28% were non-practising Catholics), 30% were <a href="Irreligion">non-religious</a>, 23% were <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> (19% practising, 4% non-practising), 3% were <a href="Protestant%20Christian">Protestants</a>, 4% were of another religion.

The architecture in Brussels is diverse, and spans from the clashing combination of <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a>, <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> and Louis XIV styles on the <a href="Grand%20Place">Grand Place</a> to the <a href="postmodernism">postmodern</a> buildings of the <a href="Brussels%20and%20the%20European%20Union">EU institutions</a>.

Very little <a href="medieval%20architecture">medieval architecture</a> is preserved in Brussels. Buildings from this period are mostly to be found in the historic centre (called "Îlot Sacré"), <a href="Saint-G%C3%A9ry%20Island">"Saint Géry"</a> and "Sainte-Catherine/Sint Katelijne" neighbourhoods. The Gothic <a href="Cathedral%20of%20St.%20Michael%20and%20St.%20Gudula">Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula</a> is still a prominent feature in the skyline of downtown Brussels. Isolated portions of the <a href="First%20walls%20of%20Brussels">first city walls</a> were saved from destruction and can be seen to this day. One of the only remains of the <a href="Second%20walls%20of%20Brussels">second walls</a> is the <a href="Halle%20Gate">Halle Gate</a>. The <a href="Grand%20Place">Grand Place</a> is the main attraction in the city centre and has been a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a> since 1998. The square is dominated by the 15th century <a href="Flamboyant">Flamboyant</a> <a href="Brussels%20Town%20Hall">Town Hall</a> (French: "Hôtel de Ville", Dutch: "Stadhuis"), the <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Neo-Gothic</a> "<a href="Museum%20of%20the%20City%20of%20Brussels">Breadhouse</a>" (French: "Maison du Roi", Dutch: "Broodhuis") and the Baroque <a href="guildhall">guildhall</a>s of the <a href="Guilds%20of%20Brussels">Guilds of Brussels</a>. The "<a href="Manneken%20Pis">Manneken Pis</a>", a fountain containing a small bronze sculpture of a urinating youth, is a tourist attraction and <a href="symbol">symbol</a> of the city.
The <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">neoclassical</a> style of the 18th and 19th centuries is represented in the "Royal Quarter/Coudenberg" area, around the <a href="Brussels%20Park">Brussels Park</a> and <a href="Place%20Royale%20%28Brussels%29">Royal Square</a>. Examples include the <a href="Royal%20Palace%20of%20Brussels">Royal Palace</a>, the <a href="Church%20of%20Saint%20Jacques-sur-Coudenberg">Church of Saint Jacques-sur-Coudenberg</a>, the <a href="Belgian%20Federal%20Parliament">Palace of the Nation</a> (Parliament building), the <a href="Academy%20Palace">Academy Palace</a>, the <a href="Palace%20of%20Charles%20of%20Lorraine">Palace of Charles of Lorraine</a>, the <a href="Egmont%20Palace">Egmont Palace</a>, etc. Other uniform neoclassical ensembles can be found around <a href="Place%20des%20Martyrs%2C%20Brussels">Martyrs' Square</a> and Barricades' Square. Some other landmarks, in the centre, are the <a href="Galeries%20Royales%20Saint-Hubert">Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert</a> (1847), one of the oldest covered shopping arcades in Europe; the <a href="Congress%20Column">Congress Column</a> (1859); the <a href="Brussels%20Stock%20Exchange">Brussels Stock Exchange</a> building (1873) (French: "Bourse", Dutch: "Beurs"); and the <a href="Law%20Courts%20of%20Brussels">Palace of Justice</a> (1883), designed by <a href="Joseph%20Poelaert">Joseph Poelaert</a>, in <a href="Eclecticism%20in%20architecture">eclectic</a> style, and reputed to be the largest building constructed in the 19th century.

Also particularly striking are the buildings in the <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> style, most famously by the Belgian architects <a href="Victor%20Horta">Victor Horta</a>, <a href="Paul%20Hankar">Paul Hankar</a> and <a href="Henry%20Van%20de%20Velde">Henry Van de Velde</a>. Some of Brussels districts were developed during the heyday of Art Nouveau, and many buildings are in this style. Good examples can be found in <a href="Schaerbeek">Schaerbeek</a>, <a href="Etterbeek">Etterbeek</a>, <a href="Ixelles">Ixelles</a>, and <a href="Saint-Gilles%2C%20Belgium">Saint-Gilles</a>. The <a href="Major%20Town%20Houses%20of%20the%20Architect%20Victor%20Horta%20%28Brussels%29">Major Town Houses of the Architect Victor Horta</a> – <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20Tassel">Hôtel Tassel</a> (1893), <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20Solvay">Hôtel Solvay</a> (1894), <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20van%20Eetvelde">Hôtel van Eetvelde</a> (1895) and the <a href="Horta%20Museum">Horta Museum</a> (1901) – have been listed as a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> since 2000. Another example of Brussels Art Nouveau is the <a href="Stoclet%20Palace">Stoclet Palace</a> (1911), by the Viennese architect <a href="Josef%20Hoffmann">Josef Hoffmann</a>, designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in June 2009.
<a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> structures in Brussels include the "Résidence Palace" (1927) (now part of the <a href="Europa%20building">Europa building</a>), the <a href="Centre%20for%20Fine%20Arts%2C%20Brussels">Centre for Fine Arts</a> (1928), the <a href="Villa%20Empain">Villa Empain</a> (1934), the Town Hall of Forest (1938), and the former House of the Radio building on <a href="Place%20Flagey">Flagey Square</a> (1935–1938) in Ixelles. Some religious buildings from the <a href="Interwar%20period">interwar era</a> were also constructed in that style, such as the Church of St John the Baptist (1932) in Molenbeek and the Church of Saint Augustine (1935) in Forest. Completed only in 1969, and combining Art Deco with <a href="Byzantine%20Revival%20architecture">Neo-Byzantine</a> elements, the <a href="Basilica%20of%20the%20Sacred%20Heart%2C%20Brussels">Basilica of the Sacred Heart</a> in Koekelberg is one of the largest <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> basilicas by area in the world. Another example are the exhibition halls of the Centenary Palace ("Brussels Expo"), built for the <a href="Brussels%20International%20Exposition%20%281935%29">1935 World Fair</a> on the <a href="Heysel%20Plateau">Heysel Plateau</a> in northern Brussels.
Since the second half of the 20th century, modern office towers have been built in Brussels (<a href="Madou%20Plaza%20Tower">Madou Tower</a>, <a href="Rogier%20Tower">Rogier Tower</a>, <a href="Proximus%20Towers">Proximus Towers</a>, <a href="Finance%20Tower">Finance Tower</a>, the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%28Brussels%29">World Trade Center</a>, among others). There are some thirty towers, mostly concentrated in the city's main business district: the <a href="Northern%20Quarter%20%28Brussels%29">Northern Quarter</a> (also called "Little Manhattan"), near <a href="Brussels-North%20railway%20station">Brussels-North railway station</a>. The <a href="South%20Tower%20%28Brussels%29">South Tower</a>, standing adjacent to <a href="Brussels-South%20railway%20station">Brussels-South railway station</a>, is the <a href="List%20of%20tallest%20structures%20in%20Belgium">tallest building in Belgium</a>. Along the <a href="North%E2%80%93South%20connection">North-South connection</a>, is the State Administrative City (French: "Cité administrative de l'État", Dutch: "Rijksadministratief Centrum"), an administrative complex in <a href="International%20Style%20%28architecture%29">International Style</a>. The postmodern buildings of the <a href="Espace%20Leopold">Espace Leopold</a> complete the picture.

Located outside the centre, in a greener environment, are the "<a href="Cinquantenaire">Cinquantenaire</a>" park with its triumphal arch and nearby museums, and in Laeken, the <a href="Royal%20Castle%20of%20Laeken">Royal Castle of Laeken</a> and the Royal Domain with its large <a href="Royal%20Greenhouses%20of%20Laeken">greenhouses</a> and the <a href="Museums%20of%20the%20Far%20East">Museums of the Far East</a>.

The <a href="Atomium">Atomium</a> is a symbolic tall structure, located on the Heysel Plateau, which was originally built for the <a href="Expo%20%2758">1958 World's Fair</a> (Expo '58). It consists of nine steel spheres connected by tubes, and forms a model of an iron crystal (specifically, a <a href="unit%20cell">unit cell</a>), magnified 165 billion times. The architect <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Waterkeyn">A. Waterkeyn</a> devoted the building to science. It is now considered a <a href="landmark">landmark</a> of Brussels. Next to the Atomium, is the "<a href="Mini-Europe">Mini-Europe</a>" park, with 1:25 scale <a href="maquette">maquette</a>s of famous buildings from across Europe.

The city's embrace of modern architecture translated into an ambivalent approach towards historic preservation, leading to the destruction of notable architectural landmarks, most famously the <a href="Maison%20du%20Peuple">Maison du Peuple</a> by Victor Horta, a process known as "<a href="Brusselization">Brusselization</a>".

The <a href="Brussels%20sprout">Brussels sprout</a>, which has long been popular in Brussels, and may have originated there, is also named after the city.

The gastronomic offer includes approximately 1,800 <a href="restaurant">restaurant</a>s, and a number of high quality bars. <a href="Belgian%20cuisine">Belgian cuisine</a> is known among connoisseurs as one of the best in Europe. In addition to the traditional restaurants, there are a large number of <a href="Coffeehouse">cafés</a>, bistros, and the usual range of international <a href="Fast%20food%20restaurant">fast food</a> chains. The cafés are similar to bars, and offer beer and light dishes; <a href="Coffeehouse">coffee houses</a> are called "salons de thé". Also widespread are "<a href="brasserie">brasserie</a>s", which usually offer a large number of beers and typical national dishes.

Belgian cuisine is characterised by the combination of <a href="French%20cuisine">French cuisine</a> with the more hearty Flemish fare. Notable specialities include <a href="Brussels%20waffle">Brussels waffle</a>s (gaufres) and <a href="mussels">mussels</a> (usually as <a href="moules%20frites">"moules-frites"</a>, served with fries). The city is a stronghold of <a href="chocolate">chocolate</a> and <a href="praline">praline</a>s manufacturers with renowned companies like <a href="Chocolatier%20Neuhaus">Neuhaus</a>, <a href="Leonidas%20%28chocolate%20maker%29">Leonidas</a> and <a href="Godiva%20Chocolatier">Godiva</a>. Pralines were first introduced, in 1912, by Jean Neuhaus II, a Belgian <a href="chocolatier">chocolatier</a> of Swiss origin, in the <a href="Galeries%20Royales%20Saint-Hubert">Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert</a>, in central Brussels. Numerous <a href="friteries">friteries</a> are spread throughout the city, and in tourist areas, fresh hot waffles are also sold on the street.

In addition to the regular selection of <a href="Beer%20in%20Belgium">Belgian beer</a>, the famous <a href="lambic">lambic</a> style of beer is predominately brewed in and around Brussels, and the yeasts have their origin in the <a href="Senne">Senne</a> valley. <a href="Kriek%20lambic">Kriek</a>, a cherry lambic, enjoys outstanding popularity, as it does in the rest of Belgium. Kriek is available in almost every bar or restaurant.

Brussels is known as the birthplace of the <a href="Chicory">Belgian Endive</a> (Dutch: "witloof" or "witlof" ("white leaf"), French: "chicon"). The technique for growing <a href="Blanching%20%28horticulture%29">blanched</a> endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the <a href="Botanical%20Garden%20of%20Brussels">Botanical Garden of Brussels</a> in <a href="Saint-Josse-ten-Noode">Saint-Josse-ten-Noode</a>, Belgium.

Famous <a href="shopping">shopping</a> areas include the pedestrian-only <a href="Rue%20Neuve%20%28Brussels%29">Rue Neuve</a> (Dutch: "Nieuwstraat"), the second busiest shopping street in Belgium (after the <a href="Meir%2C%20Antwerp">Meir</a>, in <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>) with a weekly average of 230,000 visitors; Chaussée d’Ixelles in the "<a href="Matong%C3%A9%20%28Ixelles%29">Matongé</a>" district; the <a href="Avenue%20Louise">Avenue Louise</a> lined with high-end fashion stores and boutiques";" the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert; as well as the neighbourhood around Antoine Dansaert Street, which has become, in recent years, a focal point for fashion and design. This main street and its side streets also feature Belgium’s young and most happening artistic talent.

In addition, Brussels ranks as one of Europe’s best capital cities for <a href="flea%20market">flea market</a> shopping. The" Old Market "(French: "Vieux Marché", Dutch: "Vlooienmarkt"), on the Place du Jeu de Balle/Vossenplein, in the "<a href="Marollen">Marollen</a>" neighbourhood, is particularly renowned. The nearby <a href="Sablon%20%28Brussels%29">"Sablon"</a> area is home to many of Brussels' <a href="antique">antique</a> dealers. The "Midi Market" around <a href="Brussels-South%20railway%20station">Brussels-South station</a> and Boulevard du Midi is reputed to be one of the largest markets in Europe.

The stadium now known as the <a href="King%20Baudouin%20Stadium">King Baudouin Stadium</a> is the largest in the country and home to the national teams in <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">football</a> and <a href="Belgium%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">rugby union</a>.

Several European club finals have been held at the ground, including the <a href="1985%20European%20Cup%20Final">1985 European Cup Final</a> which saw 39 deaths due to hooliganism and structural collapse. The King Baudouin Stadium is also home of the annual <a href="Memorial%20Van%20Damme">Memorial Van Damme</a> athletics event, Belgium's foremost <a href="track%20and%20field">track and field</a> competition, which is part of the <a href="IAAF%20Diamond%20League">IAAF Diamond League</a>. Other important athletics events are the <a href="Brussels%20Marathon">Brussels Marathon</a> and the <a href="20%20km%20of%20Brussels">20 km of Brussels</a>.

The <a href="Brussels%20Cycling%20Classic">Brussels Cycling Classic</a> is one of the oldest <a href="classic%20cycle%20races">semi classic</a> <a href="Road%20bicycle%20racing">bicycle race</a>s on the international calendar.

<a href="R.S.C.%20Anderlecht">R.S.C. Anderlecht</a>, based in the <a href="Constant%20Vanden%20Stock%20Stadium">Constant Vanden Stock Stadium</a> in the <a href="Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a> municipality, is the most successful Belgian football club in the <a href="Belgian%20Pro%20League">Belgian Pro League</a>, with 34 titles. It has also won the most major European tournaments for a Belgian side, with 6 European titles. 

Brussels is also home to <a href="R.%20Union%20Saint-Gilloise">Union Saint-Gilloise</a>, the most successful Belgian club before World War II, with 11 titles The club was founded in <a href="Saint-Gilles%2C%20Belgium">Saint-Gilles</a> but is based in the nearby <a href="Forest%2C%20Belgium">Forest</a> municipality and currently plays in <a href="Belgian%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>. <a href="R.%20White%20Star%20Bruxelles">White Star Bruxelles</a> is another football club that plays in second division. <a href="R.%20White%20Daring%20Molenbeek">Racing White Daring Molenbeek</a>, based in the <a href="Sint-Jans-Molenbeek">Sint-Jans-Molenbeek</a> municipality and often referred to as RWDM, was a very popular football club until it was dissolved in 2002. Since 2015, its reincarnation <a href="RWDM47">RWDM47</a> is back playing in the fourth division.

Serving as the centre of administration for Belgium and Europe, Brussels' economy is largely <a href="Tertiary%20sector%20of%20the%20economy">service</a>-oriented. It is dominated by regional and world headquarters of <a href="Multinational%20corporation">multinationals</a>, by European institutions, by various local and federal administrations, and by related services companies, though it does have a number of notable <a href="craft">craft</a> industries, such as the <a href="Cantillon%20Brewery">Cantillon Brewery</a>, a <a href="lambic">lambic</a> brewery, founded in 1900.

Brussels has a robust economy. The region contributes to one fifth of Belgium's <a href="Gross%20domestic%20product">GDP</a>, and its 550,000 jobs account for 17.7% of Belgium’s employment. Its <a href="GDP%20per%20capita">GDP per capita</a> is nearly double that of Belgium as a whole, and it has the highest GDP per capita of any <a href="Nomenclature%20of%20Territorial%20Units%20for%20Statistics">NUTS 1</a> region in the European Union, at €62,000 in 2011. That being said, the GDP is boosted by a massive inflow of <a href="Commuting">commuters</a> from neighbouring regions; over half of those who work in Brussels live in Flanders or Wallonia, with 230,000 and 130,000 commuters per day respectively. Conversely, only 16.0% of people from Brussels work outside Brussels (68 827 (68.5%) of them in Flanders and 21 035 (31.5%) in Wallonia). Not all of the wealth generated in Brussels remains in Brussels itself, and as of December 2013, the unemployment among residents of Brussels is 20.4%.

There are approximately 50,000 <a href="business">business</a>es in Brussels, of which around 2,200 are foreign. This number is constantly increasing and can well explain the role of Brussels in the European subcontinent. The city’s <a href="infrastructure">infrastructure</a> is very favourable in terms of starting up a new business. House prices have also increased in recent years, especially with the increase of young <a href="professional">professional</a>s settling down in Brussels, making it the most expensive city to live in Belgium. In addition, Brussels holds more than 1,000 business conferences annually, making it the fourth most popular conference city in Europe.

Brussels is rated as the seventh most important financial centre in the world. The <a href="Brussels%20Stock%20Exchange">Brussels Stock Exchange</a>, abbreviated to BSE, now called "Euronext Brussels", is part of the European <a href="stock%20exchange">stock exchange</a> <a href="Euronext%20N.V.">Euronext N.V.</a>, along with <a href="Paris%20Bourse">Paris Bourse</a>, <a href="Lisbon%20Stock%20Exchange">Lisbon Stock Exchange</a> and <a href="Amsterdam%20Stock%20Exchange">Amsterdam Stock Exchange</a>. Its benchmark <a href="stock%20market%20index">stock market index</a> is the <a href="BEL20">BEL20</a>.

Many Belgian <a href="newspaper">newspaper</a>s have their headquarters in Brussels, such as <a href="Le%20Soir">Le Soir</a>, <a href="La%20Libre%20Belgique">La Libre</a>, <a href="De%20Morgen">De Morgen</a> and the <a href="news%20agency">news agency</a> <a href="Belga%20%28news%20agency%29">Belga</a>. The Belgian French-language <a href="Public%20broadcasting">public broadcaster</a> <a href="RTBF">RTBF</a>, the Belgian Dutch-speaking public broadcaster <a href="Vlaamse%20Radio-%20en%20Televisieomroeporganisatie">VRT</a>, the two regional channels BX1 (formerly "Télé Bruxelles") and Bruzz (formerly "TV Brussel"), the encrypted <a href="BeTV%20%28Belgium%29">BeTV</a> channel and private channels <a href="RTL-TVI">RTL-TVI</a> and <a href="VTM%20%28TV%20channel%29">VTM</a> are also headquartered in the city.

There are several <a href="University">universities</a> in Brussels. The two main universities are the <a href="Universit%C3%A9%20Libre%20de%20Bruxelles">Université Libre de Bruxelles</a>, a French-speaking university, with about 20,000 students, in three campuses in the city (and two others outside), and the <a href="Vrije%20Universiteit%20Brussel">Vrije Universiteit Brussel</a>, a <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch-speaking</a> university, with about 10,000 students. Both universities originate from a single ancestor university, founded in 1834, namely the <a href="Free%20University%20of%20Brussels">Free University of Brussels</a>, which was split in 1970, at about the same time the Flemish and French Communities gained legislative power over the organization of higher education.

Other universities include the <a href="Universit%C3%A9%20Saint-Louis%20Bruxelles">Université Saint-Louis Bruxelles</a>, with 4,000 students; a campus of the <a href="KU%20Leuven">Katholieke Universiteit Leuven</a>, (offering bachelor & master's degrees in economics & business, law, arts, and architecture, and counting a faculty in the city centre); the <a href="Royal%20Military%20Academy%20%28Belgium%29">Royal Military Academy</a>, a military college established in 1834 by a French colonel; and two drama schools, founded in 1982: the French-speaking <a href="Conservatoire%20royal%20de%20Bruxelles">Conservatoire Royal</a> and the <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch-speaking</a> <a href="Koninklijk%20Conservatorium%20%28Brussel%29">Koninklijk Conservatorium</a>.

Still other universities have campuses in Brussels, such as the <a href="Universit%C3%A9%20Catholique%20de%20Louvain">Université Catholique de Louvain</a>, which has had its medical faculty in the city since 1973. In addition, the University of Kent's <a href="Brussels%20School%20of%20International%20Studies">Brussels School of International Studies</a> is a specialised postgraduate school offering advanced international studies.

Most of Brussels pupils, between the ages of 3 and 18, go to schools organized by the <a href="Flemish%20Community">Flemish Community</a> or the <a href="French-speaking%20Community">French-speaking Community</a>, with roughly 20% going to Dutch-speaking schools, and close to 80% to French-speaking schools. Due to the post-war international presence in the city, there are also a number of international schools, including the <a href="International%20School%20of%20Brussels">International School of Brussels</a>, with 1,450 pupils, between the ages of 2½ and 18; the <a href="British%20School%20of%20Brussels">British School of Brussels</a>; and the four <a href="European%20School">European School</a>s, which provide free education for the children of those working in the <a href="Institutions%20of%20the%20European%20Union">EU institutions</a>. The combined student population of the four <a href="European%20School">European School</a>s in Brussels is currently around 10,000.

Brussels has a number of public or private-owned libraries on its territory:

Science and technology in Brussels is well developed with the presence of several <a href="List%20of%20universities%20in%20Belgium">universities</a> and research institutes.

The <a href="Museum%20of%20Natural%20Sciences">Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences</a> houses the world's largest hall completely dedicated to <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s, with its collection of 30 <a href="fossil">fossil</a>ized "<a href="Iguanodon">Iguanodon</a>" skeletons. The <a href="Planetarium%20%28Belgium%29">Planetarium</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Observatory%20of%20Belgium">Royal Observatory of Belgium</a> is one of the largest in Europe.

Brussels is home to a thriving <a href="Pharmaceutical%20industry">pharmaceutical</a> and <a href="health%20care">health care</a> industry which includes pioneering <a href="biotechnology">biotechnology</a> research. The health sector employs 70,000 employees in 30,000 companies. There are 3,000 life sciences researchers in the city and two large <a href="science%20park">science park</a>s: <a href="Da%20Vinci%20Research%20Park">Da Vinci Research Park</a> and <a href="Erasmus%20Research%20Park">Erasmus Research Park</a>. There are five <a href="Teaching%20hospital">university hospitals</a>, a <a href="military%20hospital">military hospital</a> and more than 40 general hospitals and specialist clinics.

The Brussels Region does not have airports on its territory and its institutions do not manage any. The peculiarity of the Region is that it is served by two airports located outside its administrative territory. These are also the two main airports of Belgium:
This particularity can be explained by the fact that the territory of the Region is in fact nearly entirely urbanized, and like most major cities of the world, it does not have an airport on its own territory.

Since the 16th century, Brussels has had its own harbour, the <a href="port%20of%20Brussels">port of Brussels</a>. It has been enlarged throughout the centuries to become the second Belgian inland port. Historically situated near the Sainte-Catherine/Sint-Katelijne square, it lies today in the northwest of the city, on the <a href="Brussels-Scheldt%20Maritime%20Canal">Brussels-Scheldt Maritime Canal</a> (commonly called "Willebroek Canal)," which connects Brussels to <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> via the <a href="Scheldt">Scheldt</a>. Ships and large barges up to 4,500 tons can penetrate deep into the country, avoiding break-ups and load transfers between Antwerp and the centre of Brussels, hence reducing the cost for companies using the canal, which offers a competitive advantage.

Moreover, the connection of the Willebroek Canal with the <a href="Brussels-Charleroi%20Canal">Brussels-Charleroi Canal</a>, in the very heart of the capital, creates a north-south link, by means of waterways, between the Netherlands, Flanders and the industrial zone of <a href="Hainaut%20%28province%29">Hainaut</a> (<a href="Wallonia">Wallonia</a>). There, navigation can access the network of French canals, thanks to the important <a href="Canal%20inclined%20plane">inclined plane</a> of <a href="Ronqui%C3%A8res%20inclined%20plane">Ronquières</a> and the lifts of <a href="Str%C3%A9py-Bracquegnies">Strépy-Bracquegnies</a>.

The importance of river traffic in Brussels makes it possible to avoid the road equivalent of 740,000 trucks per year – almost 2,000 per day – which, in addition to easing traffic problems, represents an estimated carbon dioxide saving of 51,545 tonnes per year.

The Brussels Capital-Region has three main train stations: <a href="Brussels-South%20railway%20station">Brussels-South</a>, <a href="Brussels-Central%20railway%20station">Central</a> and <a href="Brussels-North%20railway%20station">North</a>, which are amongst the busiest of the country. Brussels-South is also served by direct high-speed rail links: to <a href="London">London</a> by the <a href="Eurostar">Eurostar</a> train via the <a href="Channel%20Tunnel">Channel Tunnel</a> (1hr 51 min); to <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> by the <a href="Thalys">Thalys</a> and "InterCity-Plus" connections; to Amsterdam, <a href="Paris">Paris</a> (1hr 50min, 1hr 25 min respectively) as of 6 April 2015, and <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> by the <a href="Thalys">Thalys</a>; and to Cologne and <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> by the German <a href="InterCityExpress">ICE</a> (2hr 59 min–3hr 16min).

The train rails in Brussels go underground, near the centre, through the <a href="North%E2%80%93South%20connection">North–South connection</a>, with the Brussels-Central station also being largely underground. The tunnel itself is only six tracks wide at its narrowest point, which often causes congestion and delays due to heavy use of the route.

The City has minor railway stations at <a href="Bockstael%20railway%20station">Bockstael</a>, <a href="Brussels-Chapel%20railway%20station">Brussels-Chapel</a>, <a href="Brussels-Congres%20railway%20station">Brussels-Congres</a>, <a href="Brussels-Luxembourg%20railway%20station">Brussels-Luxembourg</a>, <a href="Schuman%20station">Brussels-Schuman</a>, <a href="Brussels-West%20station">Brussels-West</a>, <a href="Haren%20railway%20station%20%28Brussels%29">Haren</a>, <a href="Haren-South%20railway%20station">Haren-South</a>, <a href="Simonis%20metro%20station">Simonis</a>.

In the Brussels Region, there are also railways stations at <a href="Berchem-Sainte-Agathe%20railway%20station">Berchem-Sainte-Agathe</a>, <a href="Boitsfort%20railway%20station">Boitsfort</a>, <a href="Boondael%20railway%20station">Boondael</a>, <a href="Bordet%20railway%20station">Bordet (Evere)</a>, <a href="Etterbeek%20railway%20station">Etterbeek</a>, <a href="Evere%20railway%20station">Evere</a>, <a href="Forest-East%20railway%20station">Forest-East</a>, <a href="Forest-South%20railway%20station">Forest-South</a>, <a href="Jette%20railway%20station">Jette</a>, <a href="Meiser%20railway%20station">Meiser (Schaarbeek)</a>, <a href="Moensberg%20railway%20station">Moensberg (Uccle)</a>, <a href="Saint-Job%20railway%20station">Saint-Job (Uccle)</a>, <a href="Schaarbeek%20railway%20station">Schaarbeek</a>, <a href="Uccle-Calevoet%20railway%20station">Uccle-Calevoet</a>, <a href="Uccle-Stalle%20railway%20station">Uccle-Stalle</a>, <a href="Vivier%20d%27Oie%20railway%20station">Vivier d'Oie-Diesdelle (Uccle)</a>, <a href="Merode%20station">Merode</a> and <a href="Watermael%20railway%20station">Watermael</a>.

The Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company <a href="Brussels%20Intercommunal%20Transport%20Company">STIB/MIVB</a> is the local <a href="public%20transport">public transport</a> operator in Brussels. It covers the 19 municipalities of the Brussels Capital-Region and some surface routes extend to the near suburbs in the other regions.

The <a href="Brussels%20Metro">Brussels Metro</a> dates back to 1976, but underground lines known as "premetro" have been serviced by tramways since 1968. The network consists of four conventional metro lines and three "<a href="premetro">premetro</a>" lines. The metro-grade lines are M1, M2, M5, and M6, with some shared sections, covering a total of 40 kilometres (24.8 mi). The metro is an important <a href="Transport%20in%20Brussels">means of transport</a>, connecting with six <a href="railway%20station">railway station</a>s of the <a href="National%20Railway%20Company%20of%20Belgium">National Railway Company of Belgium</a>, and many tram and bus stops operated by STIB/MIVB, and with <a href="Flanders">Flemish</a> <a href="De%20Lijn">De Lijn</a> and <a href="Wallonia">Walloon</a> <a href="TEC%20%28transport%29">TEC</a> bus stops.

A comprehensive <a href="Brussels%20buses">bus</a> and <a href="Brussels%20trams">tram network</a> covers the city. As of 2017, the Brussels tram system consists of 17 tram lines (three of which – lines T3, T4 and T7 – qualify as "<a href="premetro">premetro</a>" lines). The total route length is 139 km (86.3 mi), making it one of the largest tram networks in Europe. The Brussels bus network is complementary to the rail network. It consists of 50 bus routes and 11 night routes, spanning 445 km (276 mi). Since April 2007, STIB/MIVB has been operating a night bus network called "Noctis". On Fridays and Saturdays, 11 bus routes operate from midnight until 3 a.m. They run from the centre of Brussels to the outer reaches of the Brussels-Capital Region.

An interticketing system means that a STIB/MIVB ticket holder can use the train or long-distance buses inside the city. A single journey can include multiple stages across the different modes of transport. The commuter services operated by <a href="De%20Lijn">De Lijn</a>, <a href="TEC%20%28transport%29">TEC</a> and <a href="National%20Railway%20Company%20of%20Belgium">NMBS/SNCB</a> will, in the next few years, be augmented by the <a href="Brussels%20RER">Brussels RER/GEN</a> network, which will connect the capital and surrounding towns. Since August 2016, paper tickets have been discontinued in favour of electronic MoBIB cards.

Since 2003, Brussels has had a car-sharing service operated by the <a href="Bremen">Bremen</a> company "Cambio," in partnership with the STIB/MIVB and local ridesharing company "Taxi Stop". In 2006, a <a href="Community%20bicycle%20program">public bicycle-sharing programme</a> was introduced. The scheme was subsequently taken over by "<a href="Villo%21">Villo!</a>". Since 2008, this night-time public transport service has been supplemented by "Collecto", a shared taxi system, which operates on weekdays between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. In 2012, the "Zen Car" electric car-sharing scheme was launched in the university and European areas.

In medieval times, Brussels stood at the intersection of routes running North-South (the modern Rue Haute/Hoogstraat) and East-West (Chaussée de Gand/Gentsesteenweg-Rue du Marché aux Herbes/Grasmarkt-Rue de Namur/Naamsestraat). The ancient pattern of streets, radiating from the <a href="Grand%20Place">Grand Place</a>, in large part remains, but has been overlaid by boulevards built <a href="covering%20of%20the%20Senne">over the River Senne</a>, <a href="small%20ring%20%28Brussels%29">over the city walls</a> and over the railway connection between the North and South Stations.

Today, Brussels has the most congested traffic in North America and Europe, according to US traffic information platform <a href="INRIX">INRIX</a>.

As one expects of a capital city, Brussels is the hub of a range of old national roads, the main ones being clockwise: the N1 (N to <a href="Breda">Breda</a>), N2 (E to <a href="Maastricht">Maastricht</a>), N3 (E to <a href="Aachen">Aachen</a>), N4 (SE to <a href="Luxembourg%20City">Luxembourg</a>) N5 (S to <a href="Reims">Rheims</a>), N6 (S to <a href="Maubeuge">Maubeuge</a>), N7 (SW to <a href="Lille">Lille</a>), N8 (W to <a href="Koksijde">Koksijde</a>) and N9 (NW to <a href="Ostend">Ostend</a>). Usually named "chaussées/steenwegen", these highways normally run in a straight line, but sometimes lose themselves in a maze of narrow shopping streets.

The town is skirted by the <a href="European%20route%20E19">European route E19</a> (N-S) and the <a href="European%20route%20E40">E40</a> (E-W), while the <a href="E411">E411</a> leads away to the SE. Brussels has an <a href="beltway">orbital motorway</a>, numbered R0 (R-zero) and commonly referred to as the "Ring". It is pear-shaped, as the southern side was never built as originally conceived, owing to residents' objections.

The city centre, sometimes known as the "pentagon", is surrounded by an inner ring road, the <a href="small%20ring%20%28Brussels%29">"Small Ring"</a> (French: "Petite Ceinture", Dutch: "Kleine Ring"), a sequence of boulevards formally numbered R20 or N0. These were built upon the site of the <a href="second%20walls%20of%20Brussels">second set of city walls</a> following their demolition. The <a href="Brussels%20Metro%20line%202">metro line 2</a> runs under much of these. Since June 2015, a number of central boulevards inside the pentagon have become car-free, limiting transit traffic through the old city.

On the eastern side of the city, the R21 or "Greater Ring" (French: "<a href="Greater%20ring%20%28Brussels%29">Grande Ceinture</a>", Dutch: "Grote Ring") is formed by a string of boulevards that curves round from <a href="Laeken">Laeken</a> to <a href="Uccle">Uccle</a>. Some "premetro" stations (see <a href="Brussels%20Metro">Brussels Metro</a>) were built on that route. A little further out, a stretch numbered R22 leads from Zaventem to <a href="Uccle">Saint-Job</a>.

The Brussels police is responsible for the security in Brussels. The 19 municipalities of Brussels are divided into six <a href="police">police</a> zones, all bilingual (French-Dutch):

The Brussels Fire and Emergency Medical Care Service, commonly know by its acronym SIAMU (DBDMH), operates in the 19 municipalities of Brussels.
It is a class X fire department and the largest <a href="Fire%20department">fire service</a> in Belgium, in terms of annual operations, equipment and personnel. It has 9 <a href="fire%20station">fire station</a>s, spread over the entire Brussels-Capital Region, and employs about 1,000 professional <a href="firefighter">firefighter</a>s. As well as preventing and fighting fires, SIAMU also provides emergency medical care services in Brussels via its centralised 100 number (and the single 112 emergency number for the 27 countries of the European Union). It is bilingual (French-Dutch).

Brussels is one of the greenest capitals in Europe, with over 8,000 hectares of green spaces. Vegetation cover and natural areas are higher in the outskirts, where they have limited the peri-urbanisation of the capital, but they decrease sharply towards the centre of Brussels; 10% in the central "pentagon", 30% of the municipalities in the first ring, and 71% of the municipalities in the second ring are occupied by green spaces.

A multitude of parks and gardens, both public and privately owned, are scattered throughout the city. Examples include, in the <a href="City%20of%20Brussels">City of Brussels</a>:
In the Brussels Capital-Region:

Brussels is <a href="twin%20towns%20and%20sister%20cities">twinned</a> with the following cities:

Bell Labs

Nokia Bell Labs (formerly named AT&T Bell Laboratories, Bell Telephone Laboratories and Bell Labs) is an American <a href="research">research</a> and scientific development <a href="S.A.%20%28corporation%29">company</a>, owned by Finnish company <a href="Nokia">Nokia</a>. Its headquarters are located in <a href="Murray%20Hill%2C%20New%20Jersey">Murray Hill</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, in addition to other laboratories around the rest of the United States and in other countries.

The historic laboratory originated in the late 19th century as the <a href="Volta%20Laboratory%20and%20Bureau">Volta Laboratory and Bureau</a> created by <a href="Alexander%20Graham%20Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a>. Bell Labs was also at one time a division of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T Corporation), half-owned through its <a href="Western%20Electric">Western Electric</a> manufacturing subsidiary.

Researchers working at Bell Labs are credited with the development of <a href="radio%20astronomy">radio astronomy</a>, the <a href="transistor">transistor</a>, the <a href="laser">laser</a>, the <a href="charge-coupled%20device">charge-coupled device</a> (CCD), <a href="information%20theory">information theory</a>, the operating systems <a href="Unix">Unix</a>, <a href="Plan%209%20from%20Bell%20Labs">Plan 9</a>, <a href="Inferno%20%28operating%20system%29">Inferno</a>, and the programming languages <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a>, <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a>, and <a href="S%20%28programming%20language%29">S</a>. Eight <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a>s have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories.

In 1880, the <a href="France">French government</a> awarded <a href="Alexander%20Graham%20Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a> the <a href="Volta%20Prize">Volta Prize</a> of 50,000 <a href="French%20franc">francs</a>, approximately US$10,000 at that time (about $ in current dollars) for the <a href="invention%20of%20the%20telephone">invention of the telephone</a>. Bell used the award to fund the <a href="Volta%20Laboratory%20and%20Bureau">Volta Laboratory</a> ("Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory") in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, in collaboration with <a href="Charles%20Sumner%20Tainter">Sumner Tainter</a> and Bell's cousin <a href="Chichester%20Bell">Chichester Bell</a>. The laboratory is also variously known as the "Volta Bureau", the "Bell Carriage House", the "Bell Laboratory" and the "Volta Laboratory". The laboratory focused on the analysis, recording, and transmission of sound. Bell used his considerable profits from the laboratory for further research and education to permit the "[increased] diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf". This resulted in the founding of the Volta Bureau c. 1887, located at <a href="Alexander%20Melville%20Bell">Bell's father</a>'s house at 1527 35th Street in Washington, D.C., where its carriage house became their headquarters in 1889. In 1893, Bell constructed a new building, close by at 1537 35th St., specifically to house the lab. The building was declared a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> in 1972.

In 1884, the <a href="American%20Bell%20Telephone%20Company">American Bell Telephone Company</a> created the Mechanical Department from the Electrical and <a href="Patent">Patent</a> Department formed a year earlier.

In 1925, <a href="Western%20Electric">Western Electric</a> Research Laboratories and part of the engineering department of the <a href="American%20Telephone%20%26amp%3B%20Telegraph">American Telephone & Telegraph</a> company (AT&T) were consolidated to form Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., as a separate entity.

The first president of research was <a href="Frank%20B.%20Jewett">Frank B. Jewett</a>, who stayed there until 1940. Ownership of Bell Laboratories was evenly split between <a href="AT%26amp%3BT">AT&T</a> and the <a href="Western%20Electric%20Company">Western Electric Company</a>. Its principal work was to plan, design, and support the equipment that Western Electric built for <a href="Bell%20System">Bell System</a> operating companies. This included everything from <a href="telephone">telephone</a>s, <a href="telephone%20exchange">telephone exchange</a> switches, and transmission equipment. Bell Labs also carried out consulting work for the <a href="Bell%20Telephone%20Company">Bell Telephone Company</a> and U.S. government work. A few workers were assigned to basic research, and this attracted much attention, especially since they produced several Nobel Prize winners. Until the 1940s, the company's principal locations were in and around the <a href="Bell%20Laboratories%20Building%20%28Manhattan%29">Bell Labs Building</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, but many of these were moved to suburban areas of <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>.

Among the later Bell Laboratories locations in New Jersey were <a href="Murray%20Hill%2C%20New%20Jersey">Murray Hill</a>, <a href="Holmdel%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Holmdel</a>, <a href="Crawford%20Hill">Crawford Hill</a>, the <a href="Deal%20Test%20Site">Deal Test Site</a>, <a href="Freehold%20Borough%2C%20New%20Jersey">Freehold</a>, <a href="Lincroft%2C%20New%20Jersey">Lincroft</a>, <a href="Long%20Branch%2C%20New%20Jersey">Long Branch</a>, <a href="Middletown%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Middletown</a>, <a href="Neptune%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Neptune</a>, <a href="Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton</a>, <a href="Piscataway%2C%20New%20Jersey">Piscataway</a>, <a href="Red%20Bank%2C%20New%20Jersey">Red Bank</a>, <a href="Chester%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Chester</a>, and <a href="Whippany%2C%20New%20Jersey">Whippany</a>. Of these, Murray Hill and Crawford Hill remain in existence (the Piscataway and Red Bank locations were transferred to and are now operated by <a href="Telcordia%20Technologies">Telcordia Technologies</a> and the Whippany site was purchased by <a href="Bayer">Bayer</a>).

The largest grouping of people in the company was in <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, at <a href="Naperville%2C%20Illinois">Naperville</a>-<a href="Lisle%2C%20Illinois">Lisle</a>, in the <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> area, which had the largest concentration of employees (about 11,000) prior to 2001. There also were groups of employees in <a href="Indianapolis%2C%20Indiana">Indianapolis, Indiana</a>; <a href="Columbus%2C%20Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>; <a href="North%20Andover%2C%20Massachusetts">North Andover, Massachusetts</a>; <a href="Allentown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Allentown, Pennsylvania</a>; <a href="Reading%2C%20Pennsylvania">Reading, Pennsylvania</a>; and <a href="Breinigsville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Breinigsville, Pennsylvania</a>; Burlington, North Carolina (1950s–1970s, moved to Greensboro 1980s) and <a href="Westminster%2C%20Colorado">Westminster, Colorado</a>. Since 2001, many of the former locations have been scaled down or closed.

The <a href="Bell%20Labs%20Holmdel%20Complex">Holmdel site</a>, a 1.9 million square foot structure set on 473 acres, was closed in 2007. The mirrored-glass building was designed by <a href="Eero%20Saarinen">Eero Saarinen</a>. In August 2013, Somerset Development bought the building, intending to redevelop it into a mixed commercial and residential project. The prospects of success are clouded by the difficulty of readapting Saarinen's design and by the current glut of aging and abandoned office parks.

At its peak, Bell Laboratories was the premier facility of its type, developing a wide range of revolutionary technologies, including <a href="radio%20astronomy">radio astronomy</a>, the <a href="transistor">transistor</a>, the <a href="laser">laser</a>, <a href="information%20theory">information theory</a>, the operating system <a href="Unix">Unix</a>, the programming languages <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a> and <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a>. Eight Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories.

The <a href="Turing%20Award">Turing Award</a> has been won three times by Bell Labs researchers.


During its first year of operation, facsimile (<a href="fax">fax</a>) transmission, invented elsewhere, was first demonstrated publicly by the Bell Laboratories. In 1926, the laboratories invented an early example <a href="Sound%20film">synchronous-sound motion picture</a> system, in competition with <a href="Movietone%20sound%20system">Fox Movietone</a> and <a href="Phonofilm">DeForest Phonofilm</a>.

In 1924, Bell Labs physicist <a href="Walter%20A.%20Shewhart">Walter A. Shewhart</a> proposed the <a href="control%20chart">control chart</a> as a method to determine when a process was in a state of statistical control. Shewhart's methods were the basis for <a href="statistical%20process%20control">statistical process control</a> (SPC): the use of statistically based tools and techniques to manage and improve processes. This was the origin of the modern quality movement, including <a href="Six%20Sigma">Six Sigma</a>.

In 1927, a Bell team headed by <a href="Herbert%20E.%20Ives">Herbert E. Ives</a> successfully transmitted long-distance 128-line <a href="television">television</a> images of <a href="Secretary%20of%20Commerce">Secretary of Commerce</a> <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> from Washington to New York. In 1928 the <a href="thermal%20noise">thermal noise</a> in a resistor was first measured by <a href="John%20B.%20Johnson">John B. Johnson</a>, and <a href="Harry%20Nyquist">Harry Nyquist</a> provided the theoretical analysis; this is now termed "Johnson noise". During the 1920s, the <a href="one-time%20pad">one-time pad</a> <a href="cipher">cipher</a> was invented by <a href="Gilbert%20Vernam">Gilbert Vernam</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Mauborgne">Joseph Mauborgne</a> at the laboratories. Bell Labs' <a href="Claude%20Shannon">Claude Shannon</a> later proved that it is unbreakable.

In 1931, a foundation for <a href="radio%20astronomy">radio astronomy</a> was laid by <a href="Karl%20Jansky">Karl Jansky</a> during his work investigating the origins of static on long-distance <a href="Shortwave%20bands">shortwave communications</a>. He discovered that <a href="radio">radio</a> waves were being emitted from the center of the <a href="galaxy">galaxy</a>. In 1931 and 1932, experimental high fidelity, long playing, and even stereophonic recordings were made by the labs of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Orchestra">Philadelphia Orchestra</a>, conducted by <a href="Leopold%20Stokowski">Leopold Stokowski</a>. In 1933, <a href="Stereophonic%20sound">stereo signals</a> were transmitted live from <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> In 1937, the <a href="vocoder">vocoder</a>, the first electronic <a href="Speech%20synthesis">speech synthesizer</a> was invented and demonstrated by <a href="Homer%20Dudley">Homer Dudley</a>. Bell researcher <a href="Clinton%20Davisson">Clinton Davisson</a> shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with <a href="George%20Paget%20Thomson">George Paget Thomson</a> for the discovery of <a href="electron%20diffraction">electron diffraction</a>, which helped lay the foundation for <a href="solid-state%20electronics">solid-state electronics</a>.

In the early 1940s, the <a href="photovoltaic%20cell">photovoltaic cell</a> was developed by <a href="Russell%20Ohl">Russell Ohl</a>. In 1943, Bell developed <a href="SIGSALY">SIGSALY</a>, the first digital scrambled speech transmission system, used by the Allies in World War II. The British wartime codebreaker <a href="Alan%20Turing">Alan Turing</a> visited the labs at this time, working on speech encryption and meeting <a href="Claude%20Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>.

Bell Labs Quality Assurance Department gave the world and the United States such statisticians as <a href="Walter%20A.%20Shewhart">Walter A. Shewhart</a>, <a href="W.%20Edwards%20Deming">W. Edwards Deming</a>, <a href="Harold%20F.%20Dodge">Harold F. Dodge</a>, <a href="George%20D.%20Edwards">George D. Edwards</a>, Harry Romig, R. L. Jones, Paul Olmstead, E.G.D. Paterson, and Mary N. Torrey. During World War II, Emergency Technical Committee – Quality Control, drawn mainly from Bell Labs' statisticians, was instrumental in advancing Army and Navy ammunition acceptance and material sampling procedures.

In 1947, the <a href="transistor">transistor</a>, probably the most important invention developed by Bell Laboratories, was invented by <a href="John%20Bardeen">John Bardeen</a>, <a href="Walter%20Houser%20Brattain">Walter Houser Brattain</a>, and <a href="William%20Shockley">William Bradford Shockley</a> (and who subsequently shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956). In 1947, <a href="Richard%20Hamming">Richard Hamming</a> invented <a href="Hamming%20code">Hamming code</a>s for <a href="error%20detection%20and%20correction">error detection and correction</a>. For patent reasons, the result was not published until 1950. In 1948, "<a href="A%20Mathematical%20Theory%20of%20Communication">A Mathematical Theory of Communication</a>", one of the founding works in <a href="information%20theory">information theory</a>, was published by <a href="Claude%20Shannon">Claude Shannon</a> in the "<a href="Bell%20System%20Technical%20Journal">Bell System Technical Journal</a>". It built in part on earlier work in the field by Bell researchers <a href="Harry%20Nyquist">Harry Nyquist</a> and <a href="Ralph%20Hartley">Ralph Hartley</a>, but it greatly extended these. Bell Labs also introduced a series of increasingly complex calculators through the decade. Shannon was also the founder of <a href="History%20of%20cryptography">modern cryptography</a> with his 1949 paper "<a href="Communication%20Theory%20of%20Secrecy%20Systems">Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems</a>".


In 1952, <a href="William%20Gardner%20Pfann">William Gardner Pfann</a> revealed the method of <a href="zone%20melting">zone melting</a> which enabled semiconductor purification and level doping.

The 1950s also saw developmental activity based upon information theory. The central development was binary code systems. Efforts concentrated more precisely on the Laboratories' prime mission of supporting the Bell System with engineering advances including N-carrier, TD <a href="Microwave%20radio%20relay">Microwave radio relay</a>, <a href="Direct%20Distance%20Dialing">Direct Distance Dialing</a>, E-<a href="repeaters">repeaters</a>, <a href="Wire%20spring%20relay">Wire spring relay</a>s, and <a href="5XB%20switch">improved switching</a> systems. Maurice Karnaugh, in 1953, developed the <a href="Karnaugh%20map">Karnaugh map</a> as a tool to facilitate management of <a href="Boolean%20algebra%20%28logic%29">Boolean algebraic</a> expressions. In 1954, the first modern <a href="solar%20cell">solar cell</a> was invented at Bell Laboratories. As for the spectacular side of the business, in 1956 <a href="TAT-1">TAT-1</a>, the first <a href="transatlantic%20telephone%20cable">transatlantic telephone cable</a> was laid between Scotland and Newfoundland, in a joint effort by AT&T, Bell Laboratories, and British and Canadian telephone companies. A year later, in 1957, <a href="MUSIC-N">MUSIC</a>, one of the first computer programs to play <a href="electronic%20music">electronic music</a>, was created by <a href="Max%20Mathews">Max Mathews</a>. New <a href="greedy%20algorithm">greedy algorithm</a>s developed by <a href="Robert%20C.%20Prim">Robert C. Prim</a> and <a href="Joseph%20Kruskal">Joseph Kruskal</a>, revolutionized <a href="network%20planning%20and%20design">computer network design</a>. In 1958, the <a href="laser">laser</a> was first described, in a technical paper by <a href="Arthur%20Schawlow">Arthur Schawlow</a> and <a href="Charles%20Hard%20Townes">Charles Hard Townes</a>.

In December 1960, <a href="Ali%20Javan">Ali Javan</a> and his associates <a href="William%20R.%20Bennett%2C%20Jr.">William Bennett</a> and <a href="Donald%20Heriot">Donald Heriot</a> successfully operated the first <a href="gas%20laser">gas laser</a>, the first continuous-light laser, operating at an unprecedented accuracy and color purity. Also in 1960, <a href="Dawon%20Kahng">Dawon Kahng</a> and <a href="Martin%20Atalla">Martin Atalla</a> invented the metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (<a href="MOSFET">MOSFET</a>); the MOSFET has achieved electronic hegemony and sustains the <a href="Large-scale%20integration">large-scale integrated circuits</a> (LSIs) underlying today's information society. In 1962, the <a href="electret%20microphone">electret microphone</a> was invented by <a href="Gerhard%20Sessler">Gerhard M. Sessler</a> and <a href="James%20Edward%20Maceo%20West">James Edward Maceo West</a>. Also in 1962, <a href="John%20R.%20Pierce">John R. Pierce</a>'s vision of <a href="communications%20satellite">communications satellite</a>s was realized by the launch of <a href="Telstar">Telstar</a>. In 1964, the <a href="Carbon%20dioxide%20laser">Carbon dioxide laser</a> was invented by <a href="Kumar%20Patel">Kumar Patel</a>. In 1965, Penzias and Wilson discovered the <a href="Cosmic%20Microwave%20Background">Cosmic Microwave Background</a>, for which they were awarded the <a href="http%3A//nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1978/">Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978</a>. Frank W. Sinden, Edward E. Zajac, Kenneth C. Knowlton, and A. Michael Noll made computer-animated movies during the early to mid-1960s. Ken C. Knowlton invented the computer animation language <a href="BEFLIX">BEFLIX</a>. The first digital computer art was created in 1962 by Noll. In 1966, <a href="Orthogonal%20frequency-division%20multiplexing">Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing</a> (OFDM), a key technology in wireless services, was developed and patented by R. W. Chang. In 1968, <a href="Molecular%20beam%20epitaxy">Molecular beam epitaxy</a> was developed by <a href="J.R.%20Arthur">J.R. Arthur</a> and <a href="A.Y.%20Cho">A.Y. Cho</a>; molecular beam epitaxy allows semiconductor chips and laser matrices to be manufactured one atomic layer at a time. In 1969, the <a href="UNIX">UNIX</a> computer operating system was created by <a href="Dennis%20Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a> and <a href="Ken%20Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>. From 1969 to 1971, <a href="Aaron%20Marcus">Aaron Marcus</a>, the first graphic designer in the world to work with computer graphics, researched, designed, and programmed a prototype interactive page-layout system for the Picturephone. In 1969, the <a href="charge-coupled%20device">charge-coupled device</a> (CCD) was invented by <a href="Willard%20Boyle">Willard Boyle</a> and <a href="George%20E.%20Smith">George E. Smith</a>, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009. In the 1960s, the <a href="Bell%20Laboratories%20Building%20%28Manhattan%29">New York City site</a> was sold and became the <a href="Westbeth%20Artists%20Community">Westbeth Artists Community</a> complex.

The 1970s and 1980s saw more and more computer-related inventions at the Bell Laboratories as part of the <a href="personal%20computing">personal computing</a> revolution. In 1972, <a href="Dennis%20Ritchie">Dennis Ritchie</a> developed the compiled programming language <a href="C%20%28programming%20language%29">C</a> as a replacement for the interpreted language <a href="B%20%28programming%20language%29">B</a> which was then used in a <a href="worse%20is%20better">worse is better</a> rewrite of the operating system <a href="Unix">Unix</a> (also developed at Bell Laboratories by Ritchie and <a href="Ken%20Thompson">Ken Thompson</a>). Also, the language <a href="AWK">AWK</a> was designed and implemented by <a href="Alfred%20Aho">Alfred Aho</a>, <a href="Peter%20Weinberger">Peter Weinberger</a>, and <a href="Brian%20Kernighan">Brian Kernighan</a> of Bell Laboratories.

In 1970, <a href="A.%20Michael%20Noll">A. Michael Noll</a> invented a tactile, force-feedback system, coupled with interactive stereoscopic computer display. In 1971, an improved task priority system for computerized <a href="telephone%20exchange">telephone exchange</a> switching systems for telephone traffic was invented by <a href="Erna%20Schneider%20Hoover">Erna Schneider Hoover</a>, who received one of the first <a href="software%20patent">software patent</a>s for it. In 1976, <a href="Optical%20fiber">Optical fiber</a> systems were first tested in <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> and in 1980, the first single-chip <a href="32-bit">32-bit</a> <a href="microprocessor">microprocessor</a>, the <a href="Bellmac%2032">Bellmac 32</a>A was demonstrated. It went into production in 1982.

The 1970s also saw a major central office technology evolve from crossbar electromechanical relay-based technology and discrete transistor logic to Bell Labs-developed thick film hybrid and <a href="transistor-transistor%20logic">transistor-transistor logic</a> (TTL), stored program-controlled switching systems; <a href="1ESS%20switch">1A</a>/<a href="4ESS%20switch">#4 TOLL</a> Electronic Switching Systems (ESS) and 2A Local Central Offices produced at the Bell Labs Naperville and Western Electric Lisle, Illinois facilities. This technology evolution dramatically reduced floor space needs. The new ESS also came with its own diagnostic software that needed only a switchman and several frame technicians to maintain. The technology was often touted in the Bell Labs Technical Journals and Western Electric magazine (WE People).

In 1980, the <a href="Time%20division%20multiple%20access">TDMA</a> and <a href="CDMA">CDMA</a> digital cellular telephone technology was patented. In 1982, <a href="Fractional%20quantum%20Hall%20effect">Fractional quantum Hall effect</a> was discovered by <a href="Horst%20Ludwig%20St%C3%B6rmer">Horst Störmer</a> and former Bell Laboratories researchers <a href="Robert%20B.%20Laughlin">Robert B. Laughlin</a> and <a href="Daniel%20C.%20Tsui">Daniel C. Tsui</a>; they consequently won a Nobel Prize in 1998 for the discovery. In 1985, the programming language <a href="C%2B%2B">C++</a> had its first commercial release. <a href="Bjarne%20Stroustrup">Bjarne Stroustrup</a> started developing C++ at Bell Laboratories in 1979 as an extension to the original C language.

In 1984, the first photoconductive antennas for picosecond electromagnetic radiation were demonstrated by Auston and others. This type of antenna became an important component in <a href="terahertz%20time-domain%20spectroscopy">terahertz time-domain spectroscopy</a>. In 1984, <a href="Karmarkar%27s%20algorithm">Karmarkar's algorithm</a> for linear programming was developed by mathematician <a href="Narendra%20Karmarkar">Narendra Karmarkar</a>. Also in 1984, <a href="Modification%20of%20Final%20Judgment">a divestiture agreement</a> signed in 1982 with the American Federal government forced the break-up of AT&T: <a href="Bellcore">Bellcore</a> (now <a href="Telcordia%20Technologies">Telcordia Technologies</a>) was split off from Bell Laboratories to provide the same R&D functions for the newly created <a href="local%20exchange%20carrier">local exchange carrier</a>s. AT&T also was limited to using the Bell trademark only in association with Bell Laboratories. "Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc." became a wholly owned company of the new <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Technologies">AT&T Technologies</a> unit, the former Western Electric. The <a href="5ESS%20Switch">5ESS Switch</a> was developed during this transition. In 1985, <a href="laser%20cooling">laser cooling</a> was used to slow and manipulate atoms by <a href="Steven%20Chu">Steven Chu</a> and team. In 1985, the modeling language "A Mathematical Programming Language" <a href="AMPL">AMPL</a> was developed by <a href="Robert%20Fourer">Robert Fourer</a>, David M. Gay and Brian Kernighan at Bell Laboratories. Also in 1985, Bell Laboratories was awarded the <a href="National%20Medal%20of%20Technology">National Medal of Technology</a> "For contribution over decades to modern communication systems". During the 1980s, the operating system "<a href="Plan%209%20from%20Bell%20Labs">Plan 9 from Bell Labs</a>" was developed as a replacement for <a href="Unix">Unix</a>, which was also developed at Bell Labs in 1969. Also, the <a href="Radiodrum">Radiodrum</a>, an electronic music instrument played in three space dimensions was invented. In 1988, <a href="TAT-8">TAT-8</a> became the first transatlantic <a href="fiber-optic%20cable">fiber-optic cable</a>. Bell Labs in Freehold developed the 1.3-micron fiber, cable, splicing, laser detector, and 280 Mbit/s repeater for 40,000 telephone-call capacity.

In 1991, the 56K <a href="modem">modem</a> technology was patented by Nuri Dağdeviren and his team. In 1994, the <a href="quantum%20cascade%20laser">quantum cascade laser</a> was invented by <a href="Federico%20Capasso">Federico Capasso</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Cho">Alfred Cho</a>, Jerome Faist and their collaborators. Also in 1994, <a href="Peter%20Shor">Peter Shor</a> devised his quantum factorization algorithm. In 1996, SCALPEL electron <a href="lithography">lithography</a>, which prints features atoms wide on microchips, was invented by Lloyd Harriott and his team. The operating system <a href="Inferno%20%28operating%20system%29">Inferno</a>, an update of Plan 9, was created by Dennis Ritchie with others, using the then-new <a href="Concurrent%20computing">concurrent</a> programming language <a href="Limbo%20%28programming%20language%29">Limbo</a>. A high performance database engine (Dali) was developed which became DataBlitz in its product form.

In 1996, AT&T spun off Bell Laboratories, along with most of its equipment manufacturing business, into a new company named <a href="Alcatel-Lucent">Lucent Technologies</a>. AT&T retained a small number of researchers who made up the staff of the newly created <a href="AT%26amp%3BT%20Labs">AT&T Labs</a>.

In 1997, the smallest then-practical transistor (60 <a href="nanometer">nanometer</a>s, 182 atoms wide) was built. In 1998, the first <a href="Optical%20IP%20Switching">optical router</a> was invented.

2000 was an active year for the Laboratories, in which <a href="DNA%20machine">DNA machine</a> prototypes were developed; progressive geometry compression algorithm made widespread 3-D communication practical; the first electrically powered <a href="Dye%20laser">organic laser</a> invented; a large-scale map of cosmic <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a> was compiled, and the F-15 (material), an organic material that makes <a href="Organic%20electronics">plastic transistors</a> possible, was invented.

In 2002, physicist <a href="Sch%C3%B6n%20scandal">Jan Hendrik Schön was fired</a> after his work was found to contain fraudulent data. It was the first known case of fraud at Bell Labs.

In 2003, the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Institute%20of%20Technology">New Jersey Institute of Technology</a> Biomedical Engineering Laboratory was created at <a href="Murray%20Hill%2C%20New%20Jersey">Murray Hill, New Jersey</a>.

In 2005, <a href="Jeong%20H.%20Kim">Jeong H. Kim</a>, former President of Lucent's Optical Network Group, returned from academia to become the President of Bell Laboratories.

In April 2006, Bell Laboratories' parent company, Lucent Technologies, signed a merger agreement with <a href="Alcatel-Lucent">Alcatel</a>. On 1 December 2006, the merged company, <a href="Alcatel-Lucent">Alcatel-Lucent</a>, began operations. This deal raised concerns in the United States, where Bell Laboratories works on defense contracts. A separate company, LGS Innovations, with an American board was set up to manage Bell Laboratories' and Lucent's sensitive <a href="U.S.%20Government">U.S. Government</a> contracts.

In December 2007, it was announced that the former Lucent Bell Laboratories and the former Alcatel Research and Innovation would be merged into one organization under the name of Bell Laboratories. This is the first period of growth following many years during which Bell Laboratories progressively lost manpower due to layoffs and spin-offs making the company shut down for a short period of time.

As of July 2008, however, only four scientists remained in physics research, according to a report by the scientific journal "Nature".

On 28 August 2008, Alcatel-Lucent announced it was pulling out of basic science, material physics, and semiconductor research, and it will instead focus on more immediately marketable areas, including networking, high-speed electronics, wireless networks, nanotechnology and software.

In 2009, Willard Boyle and George Smith were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the invention and development of the <a href="charge-coupled%20device">charge-coupled device</a> (CCD).

In February 2013, Gee Rittenhouse, former Head of Research returned from his position as Chief Operating Officer of Alcatel-Lucent's Software, Services, and Solutions business to become the 12th President of Bell Labs.

On 4 November 2013, Alcatel-Lucent announced the appointment of <a href="Marcus%20Weldon">Marcus Weldon</a> as President of Bell Labs. His stated charter was to return Bell Labs to the forefront of innovation in <a href="Information%20and%20communications%20technology">Information and communications technology</a> by focusing on solving the key industry challenges, as was the case in the great Bell Labs innovation eras in the past.

In July 2014, Bell Labs announced it had broken "the broadband Internet speed record" with a new technology dubbed XG-FAST that promises 10 gigabits per second transmission speeds.

In 2014, <a href="Eric%20Betzig">Eric Betzig</a> shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in super-resolved fluorescence microscopy which he began pursuing while at Bell Labs in the Semiconductor Physics Research Department.

On 15 April 2015, <a href="Nokia">Nokia</a> agreed to acquire Alcatel-Lucent, Bell Labs' parent company, in a share exchange worth $16.6 billion. Their first day of combined operations was 14 January 2016.

In September 2016, Nokia Bell Labs, along with <a href="Deutsche%20Telekom%20T-Labs">Deutsche Telekom T-Labs</a> and the <a href="Technical%20University%20of%20Munich">Technical University of Munich</a> achieved a data rate of one terabit per second by improving transmission capacity and spectral efficiency in an optical communications field trial with a <a href="Constellation%20shaping%23Probabilistic%20Constellation%20Shaping">new modulation technique</a>.


On May 20, 2014, Bell Labs announced the "Bell Labs Prize", a competition for innovators to offer proposals in information and communication technologies, with cash awards of up to $100,000 for the grand prize.

The Murray Hill campus features a 3000 square foot exhibit, the Bell Labs Technology Showcase, showcasing the technological discoveries and developments at Bell Labs. The exhibit is located just off the main lobby and is open to the public.

Brain

The brain is an <a href="organ%20%28anatomy%29">organ</a> that serves as the center of the <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a> in all <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> and most <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> animals. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for <a href="sense">sense</a>s such as <a href="Visual%20perception">vision</a>. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a human, the <a href="cerebral%20cortex">cerebral cortex</a> contains approximately 15–33 billion <a href="neuron">neuron</a>s, each connected by <a href="synapse">synapse</a>s to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long <a href="protoplasm">protoplasm</a>ic fibers called <a href="axon">axon</a>s, which carry trains of signal pulses called <a href="action%20potential">action potential</a>s to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.

<a href="Physiology">Physiologically</a>, the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body. The brain acts on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called <a href="hormone">hormone</a>s. This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the <a href="Environment%20%28biophysical%29">environment</a>. Some basic types of responsiveness such as <a href="reflex">reflex</a>es can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral <a href="ganglion">ganglia</a>, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.

The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail but the way they cooperate in ensembles of millions is yet to be solved. Recent models in modern neuroscience treat the brain as a biological <a href="computer">computer</a>, very different in mechanism from an electronic computer, but similar in the sense that it acquires information from the surrounding world, stores it, and processes it in a variety of ways.

This article compares the properties of brains across the entire range of animal species, with the greatest attention to vertebrates. It deals with the <a href="human%20brain">human brain</a> insofar as it shares the properties of other brains. The ways in which the human brain differs from other brains are covered in the human brain article. Several topics that might be covered here are instead covered there because much more can be said about them in a human context. The most important is <a href="brain%20disease">brain disease</a> and the effects of <a href="brain%20damage">brain damage</a>, that are covered in the human brain article.

The shape and size of the brain varies greatly between species, and identifying common features is often difficult. Nevertheless, there are a number of principles of brain architecture that apply across a wide range of species. Some aspects of brain structure are common to almost the entire range of animal species; others distinguish "advanced" brains from more primitive ones, or distinguish vertebrates from invertebrates.

The simplest way to gain information about brain anatomy is by visual inspection, but many more sophisticated techniques have been developed. Brain tissue in its natural state is too soft to work with, but it can be hardened by immersion in <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a> or other <a href="fixation%20%28histology%29">fixative</a>s, and then sliced apart for examination of the interior. Visually, the interior of the brain consists of areas of so-called <a href="grey%20matter">grey matter</a>, with a dark color, separated by areas of <a href="white%20matter">white matter</a>, with a lighter color. Further information can be gained by staining slices of brain tissue with a variety of chemicals that bring out areas where specific types of molecules are present in high concentrations. It is also possible to <a href="histology">examine the microstructure</a> of brain tissue using a microscope, and to trace the pattern of connections from one brain area to another.

The brains of all species are composed primarily of two broad classes of cells: <a href="neuron">neuron</a>s and <a href="neuroglia">glial cell</a>s. Glial cells (also known as "glia" or "neuroglia") come in several types, and perform a number of critical functions, including structural support, metabolic support, insulation, and guidance of development. Neurons, however, are usually considered the most important cells in the brain.
The property that makes neurons unique is their ability to send signals to specific target cells over long distances. They send these signals by means of an axon, which is a thin protoplasmic fiber that extends from the cell body and projects, usually with numerous branches, to other areas, sometimes nearby, sometimes in distant parts of the brain or body. The length of an axon can be extraordinary: for example, if a <a href="pyramidal%20cell">pyramidal cell</a>, (an excitatory neuron) of the cerebral cortex were magnified so that its cell body became the size of a human body, its axon, equally magnified, would become a cable a few centimeters in diameter, extending more than a kilometer. These axons transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials, which last less than a thousandth of a second and travel along the axon at speeds of 1–100 meters per second. Some neurons emit action potentials constantly, at rates of 10–100 per second, usually in irregular patterns; other neurons are quiet most of the time, but occasionally emit a burst of action potentials.

Axons transmit signals to other neurons by means of specialized junctions called <a href="synapse">synapse</a>s. A single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells. When an action potential, traveling along an axon, arrives at a synapse, it causes a chemical called a <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a> to be released. The neurotransmitter binds to <a href="receptor%20%28biochemistry%29">receptor</a> molecules in the membrane of the target cell.
Synapses are the key functional elements of the brain. The essential function of the brain is cell-to-cell communication, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs. The human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses; even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million. The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are excitatory (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating <a href="second%20messenger%20system">second messenger system</a>s that change the internal <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a> of their target cells in complex ways. A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, they are capable of changing strength in a way that is controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them. It is widely believed that <a href="synaptic%20plasticity">activity-dependent modification of synapses</a> is the brain's primary mechanism for learning and memory.

Most of the space in the brain is taken up by axons, which are often bundled together in what are called "nerve fiber tracts". A myelinated axon is wrapped in a fatty insulating sheath of <a href="myelin">myelin</a>, which serves to greatly increase the speed of signal propagation. (There are also unmyelinated axons). Myelin is white, making parts of the brain filled exclusively with nerve fibers appear as light-colored <a href="white%20matter">white matter</a>, in contrast to the darker-colored <a href="grey%20matter">grey matter</a> that marks areas with high densities of neuron cell bodies.

Except for a few primitive organisms such as sponges (which have no nervous system) and <a href="cnidaria">cnidaria</a>ns (which have a nervous system consisting of a diffuse nerve net), all living multicellular animals are <a href="bilateria">bilateria</a>ns, meaning animals with a <a href="bilateral%20symmetry">bilaterally symmetric</a> body shape (that is, left and right sides that are approximate mirror images of each other). All bilaterians are thought to have descended from a common ancestor that appeared early in the <a href="Cambrian">Cambrian</a> period, 485-540 million years ago, and it has been hypothesized that this common ancestor had the shape of a simple tubeworm with a segmented body. At a schematic level, that basic worm-shape continues to be reflected in the body and nervous system architecture of all modern bilaterians, including vertebrates. The fundamental bilateral body form is a tube with a hollow gut cavity running from the mouth to the anus, and a nerve cord with an enlargement (a <a href="ganglion">ganglion</a>) for each body segment, with an especially large ganglion at the front, called the brain. The brain is small and simple in some species, such as <a href="nematode">nematode</a> worms; in other species, including vertebrates, it is the most complex organ in the body. Some types of worms, such as <a href="leech">leech</a>es, also have an enlarged ganglion at the back end of the nerve cord, known as a "tail brain".

There are a few types of existing bilaterians that lack a recognizable brain, including <a href="echinoderm">echinoderm</a>s and <a href="tunicate">tunicate</a>s. It has not been definitively established whether the existence of these brainless species indicates that the earliest <a href="bilaterians">bilaterians</a> lacked a brain, or whether their ancestors evolved in a way that led to the disappearance of a previously existing brain structure.

This category includes <a href="tardigrade">tardigrade</a>s, <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s, <a href="Mollusca">molluscs</a>, and numerous types of <a href="worm">worm</a>s. The diversity of invertebrate body plans is matched by an equal diversity in brain structures.

Two groups of invertebrates have notably complex brains: arthropods (<a href="insect">insect</a>s, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, <a href="arachnid">arachnid</a>s, and others), and <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s (<a href="octopus">octopus</a>es, <a href="squid">squid</a>s, and similar molluscs). The brains of arthropods and cephalopods arise from twin parallel nerve cords that extend through the body of the animal. Arthropods have a central brain, the <a href="supraesophageal%20ganglion">supraesophageal ganglion</a>, with three divisions and large <a href="optic%20lobe%20%28arthropod%29">optical lobes</a> behind each eye for visual processing. Cephalopods such as the octopus and squid have the largest brains of any invertebrates.

There are several invertebrate species whose brains have been studied intensively because they have properties that make them convenient for experimental work:

The first <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s appeared over 500 million years ago (<a href="mya%20%28unit%29">Mya</a>), during the <a href="Cambrian%20period">Cambrian period</a>, and may have resembled the modern <a href="hagfish">hagfish</a> in form. Sharks appeared about 450 Mya, amphibians about 400 Mya, reptiles about 350 Mya, and mammals about 200 Mya. Each species has an equally long <a href="evolution">evolutionary history</a>, but the brains of modern hagfishes, <a href="lamprey">lamprey</a>s, sharks, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals show a gradient of size and complexity that roughly follows the evolutionary sequence. All of these brains contain the same set of basic anatomical components, but many are rudimentary in the hagfish, whereas in mammals the foremost part (the <a href="cerebrum">telencephalon</a>) is greatly elaborated and expanded.

Brains are most simply compared in terms of their size. The relationship between <a href="brain%20size">brain size</a>, body size and other variables has been studied across a wide range of vertebrate species. As a rule, brain size increases with body size, but not in a simple linear proportion. In general, smaller animals tend to have larger brains, measured as a fraction of body size. For mammals, the relationship between brain volume and body mass essentially follows a <a href="power%20law">power law</a> with an <a href="exponentiation">exponent</a> of about 0.75. This formula describes the central tendency, but every family of mammals departs from it to some degree, in a way that reflects in part the complexity of their behavior. For example, primates have brains 5 to 10 times larger than the formula predicts. Predators tend to have larger brains than their prey, relative to body size.
All vertebrate brains share a common underlying form, which appears most clearly during early stages of embryonic development. In its earliest form, the brain appears as three swellings at the front end of the <a href="neural%20tube">neural tube</a>; these swellings eventually become the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain (the <a href="prosencephalon">prosencephalon</a>, <a href="mesencephalon">mesencephalon</a>, and <a href="rhombencephalon">rhombencephalon</a>, respectively). At the earliest stages of brain development, the three areas are roughly equal in size. In many classes of vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, the three parts remain similar in size in the adult, but in mammals the forebrain becomes much larger than the other parts, and the midbrain becomes very small.

The brains of vertebrates are made of very soft tissue. Living brain tissue is pinkish on the outside and mostly white on the inside, with subtle variations in color. Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of <a href="connective%20tissue">connective tissue</a> <a href="Biological%20membrane">membrane</a>s called <a href="meninges">meninges</a> that separate the skull from the brain. <a href="Blood%20vessel">Blood vessel</a>s enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another, forming the <a href="blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier">blood–brain barrier</a>, which blocks the passage of many <a href="toxin">toxin</a>s and <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s (though at the same time blocking <a href="antibody">antibodies</a> and some drugs, thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain).

<a href="Neuroanatomy">Neuroanatomist</a>s usually divide the vertebrate brain into six main regions: the <a href="cerebrum">telencephalon</a> (cerebral hemispheres), <a href="diencephalon">diencephalon</a> (thalamus and hypothalamus), <a href="midbrain">mesencephalon</a> (midbrain), <a href="cerebellum">cerebellum</a>, <a href="pons">pons</a>, and <a href="medulla%20oblongata">medulla oblongata</a>. Each of these areas has a complex internal structure. Some parts, such as the cerebral cortex and the cerebellar cortex, consist of layers that are folded or convoluted to fit within the available space. Other parts, such as the thalamus and hypothalamus, consist of clusters of many small nuclei. Thousands of distinguishable areas can be identified within the vertebrate brain based on fine distinctions of neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity.

Although the same basic components are present in all vertebrate brains, some branches of vertebrate evolution have led to substantial distortions of brain geometry, especially in the forebrain area. The brain of a shark shows the basic components in a straightforward way, but in <a href="teleostei">teleost</a> fishes (the great majority of existing fish species), the forebrain has become "everted", like a sock turned inside out. In birds, there are also major changes in forebrain structure. These distortions can make it difficult to match brain components from one species with those of another species.

Here is a list of some of the most important vertebrate brain components, along with a brief description of their functions as currently understood:


The most obvious difference between the brains of mammals and other vertebrates is in terms of size. On average, a mammal has a brain roughly twice as large as that of a bird of the same body size, and ten times as large as that of a reptile of the same body size.

Size, however, is not the only difference: there are also substantial differences in shape. The hindbrain and midbrain of mammals are generally similar to those of other vertebrates, but dramatic differences appear in the forebrain, which is greatly enlarged and also altered in structure. The cerebral cortex is the part of the brain that most strongly distinguishes mammals. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the surface of the <a href="cerebrum">cerebrum</a> is lined with a comparatively simple three-layered structure called the <a href="pallium%20%28neuroanatomy%29">pallium</a>. In mammals, the pallium evolves into a complex six-layered structure called <a href="neocortex">neocortex</a> or "isocortex". Several areas at the edge of the neocortex, including the hippocampus and <a href="amygdala">amygdala</a>, are also much more extensively developed in mammals than in other vertebrates.

The elaboration of the cerebral cortex carries with it changes to other brain areas. The <a href="superior%20colliculus">superior colliculus</a>, which plays a major role in visual control of behavior in most vertebrates, shrinks to a small size in mammals, and many of its functions are taken over by visual areas of the cerebral cortex. The cerebellum of mammals contains a large portion (the <a href="neocerebellum">neocerebellum</a>) dedicated to supporting the cerebral cortex, which has no counterpart in other vertebrates.

The brains of humans and other <a href="primate">primate</a>s contain the same structures as the brains of other mammals, but are generally larger in proportion to body size. The <a href="encephalization%20quotient">encephalization quotient</a> (EQ) is used to compare brain sizes across species. It takes into account the nonlinearity of the brain-to-body relationship. Humans have an average EQ in the 7-to-8 range, while most other primates have an EQ in the 2-to-3 range. Dolphins have values higher than those of primates other than humans, but nearly all other mammals have EQ values that are substantially lower.

Most of the enlargement of the primate brain comes from a massive expansion of the cerebral cortex, especially the <a href="prefrontal%20cortex">prefrontal cortex</a> and the parts of the cortex involved in <a href="Visual%20perception">vision</a>. The visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas, with a complex web of interconnections. It has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy more than half of the total surface of the primate neocortex. The <a href="prefrontal%20cortex">prefrontal cortex</a> carries out functions that include <a href="foresight%20%28psychology%29">planning</a>, <a href="working%20memory">working memory</a>, <a href="motivation">motivation</a>, <a href="attention">attention</a>, and <a href="executive%20functions">executive control</a>. It takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species, and an especially large fraction of the human brain.

The brain develops in an intricately orchestrated sequence of stages. It changes in shape from a simple swelling at the front of the nerve cord in the earliest embryonic stages, to a complex array of areas and connections. Neurons are created in special zones that contain <a href="stem%20cell">stem cell</a>s, and then migrate through the tissue to reach their ultimate locations. Once neurons have positioned themselves, their axons sprout and navigate through the brain, branching and extending as they go, until the tips reach their targets and form synaptic connections. In a number of parts of the nervous system, neurons and synapses are produced in excessive numbers during the early stages, and then the unneeded ones are pruned away.

For vertebrates, the early stages of neural development are similar across all species. As the embryo transforms from a round blob of cells into a wormlike structure, a narrow strip of <a href="ectoderm">ectoderm</a> running along the midline of the back is <a href="cellular%20differentiation">induced</a> to become the <a href="neural%20plate">neural plate</a>, the precursor of the nervous system. The neural plate folds inward to form the <a href="neural%20groove">neural groove</a>, and then the lips that line the groove merge to enclose the <a href="neural%20tube">neural tube</a>, a hollow cord of cells with a fluid-filled ventricle at the center. At the front end, the ventricles and cord swell to form three vesicles that are the precursors of the <a href="prosencephalon">forebrain</a>, <a href="mesencephalon">midbrain</a>, and <a href="rhombencephalon">hindbrain</a>. At the next stage, the forebrain splits into two vesicles called the <a href="cerebrum">telencephalon</a> (which will contain the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and related structures) and the <a href="diencephalon">diencephalon</a> (which will contain the thalamus and hypothalamus). At about the same time, the hindbrain splits into the <a href="metencephalon">metencephalon</a> (which will contain the cerebellum and pons) and the <a href="myelencephalon">myelencephalon</a> (which will contain the <a href="medulla%20oblongata">medulla oblongata</a>). Each of these areas contains proliferative zones where neurons and glial cells are generated; the resulting cells then migrate, sometimes for long distances, to their final positions.

Once a neuron is in place, it extends dendrites and an axon into the area around it. Axons, because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets, grow in a particularly complex way. The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a <a href="growth%20cone">growth cone</a>, studded with chemical receptors. These receptors sense the local environment, causing the growth cone to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path. The result of this pathfinding process is that the growth cone navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses. Considering the entire brain, thousands of <a href="gene">gene</a>s create products that influence axonal pathfinding.

The synaptic network that finally emerges is only partly determined by genes, though. In many parts of the brain, axons initially "overgrow", and then are "pruned" by mechanisms that depend on neural activity. In the projection from the eye to the midbrain, for example, the structure in the adult contains a very precise mapping, connecting each point on the surface of the <a href="retina">retina</a> to a corresponding point in a midbrain layer. In the first stages of development, each axon from the retina is guided to the right general vicinity in the midbrain by chemical cues, but then branches very profusely and makes initial contact with a wide swath of midbrain neurons. The retina, before birth, contains special mechanisms that cause it to generate waves of activity that originate spontaneously at a random point and then propagate slowly across the retinal layer. These waves are useful because they cause neighboring neurons to be active at the same time; that is, they produce a neural activity pattern that contains information about the spatial arrangement of the neurons. This information is exploited in the midbrain by a mechanism that causes synapses to weaken, and eventually vanish, if activity in an axon is not followed by activity of the target cell. The result of this sophisticated process is a gradual tuning and tightening of the map, leaving it finally in its precise adult form.

Similar things happen in other brain areas: an initial synaptic matrix is generated as a result of genetically determined chemical guidance, but then gradually refined by activity-dependent mechanisms, partly driven by internal dynamics, partly by external sensory inputs. In some cases, as with the retina-midbrain system, activity patterns depend on mechanisms that operate only in the developing brain, and apparently exist solely to guide development.

In humans and many other mammals, new neurons are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain contains substantially more neurons than the adult brain. There are, however, a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life. The two areas for which adult <a href="neurogenesis">neurogenesis</a> is well established are the olfactory bulb, which is involved in the sense of smell, and the <a href="dentate%20gyrus">dentate gyrus</a> of the hippocampus, where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories. With these exceptions, however, the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life. Glial cells are different: as with most types of cells in the body, they are generated throughout the lifespan.

There has long been debate about whether the qualities of <a href="mind">mind</a>, personality, and intelligence can be attributed to heredity or to upbringing—this is the <a href="nature%20and%20nurture">nature and nurture</a> controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. In some respects, all that matters is the presence or absence of experience during critical periods of development. In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in <a href="Environmental%20enrichment%20%28neural%29">enriched environments</a> have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.

The functions of the brain depend on the ability of neurons to transmit electrochemical signals to other cells, and their ability to respond appropriately to electrochemical signals received from other cells. The <a href="membrane%20potential">electrical properties</a> of neurons are controlled by a wide variety of biochemical and metabolic processes, most notably the interactions between neurotransmitters and receptors that take place at synapses.

<a href="Neurotransmitter">Neurotransmitter</a>s are chemicals that are released at synapses when an action potential activates them—neurotransmitters attach themselves to receptor molecules on the membrane of the synapse's target cell, and thereby alter the electrical or chemical properties of the receptor molecules.
With few exceptions, each neuron in the brain releases the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as <a href="Dale%27s%20principle">Dale's principle</a>. Thus, a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases. The great majority of <a href="psychoactive%20drug">psychoactive drug</a>s exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems. This applies to drugs such as <a href="cannabinoids">cannabinoids</a>, <a href="nicotine">nicotine</a>, <a href="heroin">heroin</a>, <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>, alcohol, <a href="fluoxetine">fluoxetine</a>, <a href="chlorpromazine">chlorpromazine</a>, and many others.

The two neurotransmitters that are used most widely in the vertebrate brain are <a href="glutamic%20acid">glutamate</a>, which almost always exerts excitatory effects on target neurons, and <a href="gamma-aminobutyric%20acid">gamma-aminobutyric acid</a> (GABA), which is almost always inhibitory. Neurons using these transmitters can be found in nearly every part of the brain. Because of their ubiquity, drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects. Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA.

There are dozens of other chemical neurotransmitters that are used in more limited areas of the brain, often areas dedicated to a particular function. <a href="Serotonin">Serotonin</a>, for example—the primary target of antidepressant drugs and many dietary aids—comes exclusively from a small brainstem area called the <a href="Raphe%20nuclei">Raphe nuclei</a>. <a href="Norepinephrine">Norepinephrine</a>, which is involved in arousal, comes exclusively from a nearby small area called the <a href="locus%20coeruleus">locus coeruleus</a>. Other neurotransmitters such as <a href="acetylcholine">acetylcholine</a> and <a href="dopamine">dopamine</a> have multiple sources in the brain, but are not as ubiquitously distributed as glutamate and GABA.

As a side effect of the electrochemical processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using <a href="electroencephalography">electroencephalography</a> (EEG) or <a href="magnetoencephalography">magnetoencephalography</a> (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow <a href="delta%20wave">delta wave</a>s during sleep, faster <a href="alpha%20wave">alpha wave</a>s when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an <a href="epilepsy">epileptic seizure</a>, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in <a href="neurophysiology">neurophysiology</a>.

All vertebrates have a blood–brain barrier that allows metabolism inside the brain to operate differently from metabolism in other parts of the body. <a href="Neuroglia">Glial cells</a> play a major role in brain metabolism by controlling the chemical composition of the fluid that surrounds neurons, including levels of ions and nutrients.

Brain tissue consumes a large amount of energy in proportion to its volume, so large brains place severe metabolic demands on animals. The need to limit body weight in order, for example, to fly, has apparently led to selection for a reduction of brain size in some species, such as bats. Most of the brain's energy consumption goes into sustaining the electric charge (<a href="membrane%20potential">membrane potential</a>) of neurons. Most vertebrate species devote between 2% and 8% of basal metabolism to the brain. In primates, however, the percentage is much higher—in humans it rises to 20–25%. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cerebral cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions; this forms the basis for the functional brain imaging methods <a href="Positron%20emission%20tomography">PET</a>, <a href="fMRI">fMRI</a>, and <a href="Near%20infrared%20spectroscopy">NIRS</a>. The brain typically gets most of its energy from oxygen-dependent metabolism of <a href="glucose">glucose</a> (i.e., blood sugar), but <a href="ketone%20bodies">ketones</a> provide a major alternative source, together with contributions from medium chain <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s (<a href="Caprylic%20acid">caprylic</a> and <a href="Heptanoic%20acid">heptanoic</a> acids), <a href="lactic%20acid">lactate</a>, <a href="acetate">acetate</a>, and possibly <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s.

Information from the sense organs is collected in the brain. There it is used to determine what actions the organism is to take. The brain <a href="multisensory%20integration">processes</a> the raw data to extract information about the structure of the environment. Next it combines the processed information with information about the current needs of the animal and with memory of past circumstances. Finally, on the basis of the results, it generates motor response patterns. These signal-processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems.

The function of the brain is to provide coherent control over the actions of an animal. A centralized brain allows groups of muscles to be co-activated in complex patterns; it also allows stimuli impinging on one part of the body to evoke responses in other parts, and it can prevent different parts of the body from acting at cross-purposes to each other.

The human brain is provided with information about light, sound, the chemical composition of the atmosphere, temperature, head orientation, limb position, the chemical composition of the bloodstream, and more. In other animals additional senses are present, such as the infrared heat-sense of snakes, the <a href="Magnetoception">magnetic field sense</a> of some birds, or the electric field sense of some types of fish.

Each sensory system begins with specialized receptor cells, such as light-receptive neurons in the <a href="retina">retina</a> of the eye, or vibration-sensitive neurons in the <a href="cochlea">cochlea</a> of the ear. The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into the spinal cord or brain, where they transmit their signals to a <a href="sensory%20system">first-order sensory nucleus</a> dedicated to one specific <a href="Stimulus%20modality">sensory modality</a>. This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher-order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality. Eventually, via a way-station in the <a href="thalamus">thalamus</a>, the signals are sent to the cerebral cortex, where they are processed to extract the relevant features, and <a href="Multisensory%20integration">integrated</a> with signals coming from other sensory systems.

<a href="Motor%20system">Motor system</a>s are areas of the brain that are involved in <a href="motor%20control">initiating body movements</a>, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the body are directly innervated by <a href="motor%20neuron">motor neuron</a>s in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many <a href="reflex">reflex</a> responses, and contain <a href="central%20pattern%20generator">pattern generators</a> for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.

The brain contains several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord. At the lowest level are motor areas in the medulla and pons, which control stereotyped movements such as walking, breathing, or swallowing. At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the <a href="red%20nucleus">red nucleus</a>, which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the <a href="primary%20motor%20cortex">primary motor cortex</a>, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the <a href="pyramidal%20tract">pyramidal tract</a>. This direct corticospinal projection allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. Other motor-related brain areas exert secondary effects by projecting to the primary motor areas. Among the most important secondary areas are the premotor cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.
In addition to all of the above, the brain and spinal cord contain extensive circuitry to control the <a href="autonomic%20nervous%20system">autonomic nervous system</a>, which works by secreting hormones and by modulating the "smooth" muscles of the gut.

Many animals alternate between sleeping and waking in a daily cycle. Arousal and alertness are also modulated on a finer time scale by a network of brain areas.

A key component of the arousal system is the <a href="suprachiasmatic%20nucleus">suprachiasmatic nucleus</a> (SCN), a tiny part of the hypothalamus located directly above the point at which the <a href="optic%20nerves">optic nerves</a> from the two eyes cross. The SCN contains the body's central biological clock. Neurons there show activity levels that rise and fall with a period of about 24 hours, <a href="circadian%20rhythm">circadian rhythm</a>s: these activity fluctuations are driven by rhythmic changes in expression of a set of "clock genes". The SCN continues to keep time even if it is excised from the brain and placed in a dish of warm nutrient solution, but it ordinarily receives input from the optic nerves, through the <a href="retinohypothalamic%20tract">retinohypothalamic tract</a> (RHT), that allows daily light-dark cycles to calibrate the clock.

The SCN projects to a set of areas in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep-wake cycles. An important component of the system is the <a href="reticular%20formation">reticular formation</a>, a group of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain. Reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus, which in turn sends activity-level-controlling signals to every part of the cortex. Damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma.

Sleep involves great changes in brain activity. Until the 1950s it was generally believed that the brain essentially shuts off during sleep, but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different. There are two types of sleep: "<a href="Rapid%20eye%20movement%20sleep">REM sleep</a>" (with dreaming) and "<a href="Non-rapid%20eye%20movement%20sleep">NREM</a>" (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode. Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep NREM. During deep NREM sleep, also called <a href="slow%20wave%20sleep">slow wave sleep</a>, activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized. Levels of the neurotransmitters <a href="norepinephrine">norepinephrine</a> and <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a> drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.

For any animal, survival requires maintaining a variety of parameters of bodily state within a limited range of variation: these include temperature, water content, salt concentration in the bloodstream, blood glucose levels, blood oxygen level, and others. The ability of an animal to regulate the internal environment of its body—the <a href="milieu%20int%C3%A9rieur">milieu intérieur</a>, as pioneering physiologist <a href="Claude%20Bernard">Claude Bernard</a> called it—is known as <a href="homeostasis">homeostasis</a> (<a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> for "standing still"). Maintaining homeostasis is a crucial function of the brain. The basic principle that underlies homeostasis is <a href="negative%20feedback">negative feedback</a>: any time a parameter diverges from its set-point, sensors generate an error signal that evokes a response that causes the parameter to shift back toward its optimum value. (This principle is widely used in engineering, for example in the control of temperature using a <a href="thermostat">thermostat</a>.)

In vertebrates, the part of the brain that plays the greatest role is the <a href="hypothalamus">hypothalamus</a>, a small region at the base of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function. The hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei, most of which are involved in basic biological functions. Some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal behaviors; but many of them relate to homeostasis. Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels, conveying information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level, blood oxygen level, and other parameters. These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies. Some of the outputs also go to the <a href="pituitary%20gland">pituitary gland</a>, a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus. The pituitary gland secretes hormones into the bloodstream, where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity.

The individual animals need to express survival-promoting behaviors, such as seeking food, water, shelter, and a mate. The motivational system in the brain monitors the current state of satisfaction of these goals, and activates behaviors to meet any needs that arise. The motivational system works largely by a reward–punishment mechanism. When a particular behavior is followed by favorable consequences, the reward mechanism in the brain is activated, which induces structural changes inside the brain that cause the same behavior to be repeated later, whenever a similar situation arises. Conversely, when a behavior is followed by unfavorable consequences, the brain's punishment mechanism is activated, inducing structural changes that cause the behavior to be suppressed when similar situations arise in the future.

Most organisms studied to date utilize a reward–punishment mechanism: for instance, worms and insects can alter their behavior to seek food sources or to avoid dangers. In vertebrates, the reward-punishment system is implemented by a specific set of brain structures, at the heart of which lie the basal ganglia, a set of interconnected areas at the base of the forebrain. The basal ganglia are the central site at which decisions are made: the basal ganglia exert a sustained inhibitory control over most of the motor systems in the brain; when this inhibition is released, a motor system is permitted to execute the action it is programmed to carry out. Rewards and punishments function by altering the relationship between the inputs that the basal ganglia receive and the decision-signals that are emitted. The reward mechanism is better understood than the punishment mechanism, because its role in drug abuse has caused it to be studied very intensively. Research has shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine plays a central role: addictive drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine either cause dopamine levels to rise or cause the effects of dopamine inside the brain to be enhanced.

Almost all animals are capable of modifying their behavior as a result of experience—even the most primitive types of worms. Because behavior is driven by brain activity, changes in behavior must somehow correspond to changes inside the brain. Already in the late 19th century theorists like <a href="Santiago%20Ram%C3%B3n%20y%20Cajal">Santiago Ramón y Cajal</a> argued that the most plausible explanation is that learning and memory are expressed as changes in the synaptic connections between neurons. Until 1970, however, experimental evidence to support the <a href="synaptic%20plasticity">synaptic plasticity</a> hypothesis was lacking. In 1971 <a href="Tim%20Bliss">Tim Bliss</a> and <a href="Terje%20L%C3%B8mo">Terje Lømo</a> published a paper on a phenomenon now called <a href="long-term%20potentiation">long-term potentiation</a>: the paper showed clear evidence of activity-induced synaptic changes that lasted for at least several days. Since then technical advances have made these sorts of experiments much easier to carry out, and thousands of studies have been made that have clarified the mechanism of synaptic change, and uncovered other types of activity-driven synaptic change in a variety of brain areas, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<a href="BDNF">BDNF</a>) and <a href="physical%20activity">physical activity</a> appear to play a beneficial role in the process.

Neuroscientists currently distinguish several types of learning and memory that are implemented by the brain in distinct ways:

The field of neuroscience encompasses all approaches that seek to understand the brain and the rest of the nervous system. <a href="Psychology">Psychology</a> seeks to understand mind and behavior, and <a href="neurology">neurology</a> is the <a href="medicine">medical</a> discipline that diagnoses and treats diseases of the nervous system. The brain is also the most important organ studied in <a href="psychiatry">psychiatry</a>, the branch of medicine that works to study, prevent, and treat <a href="mental%20disorder">mental disorder</a>s. <a href="Cognitive%20science">Cognitive science</a> seeks to unify neuroscience and psychology with other fields that concern themselves with the brain, such as <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a> (<a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> and similar fields) and <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>.

The oldest method of studying the brain is <a href="Neuroanatomy">anatomical</a>, and until the middle of the 20th century, much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes. Neuroanatomists study the large-scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components, especially synapses. Among other tools, they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity. In recent years, the development of <a href="immunostaining">immunostaining</a> techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes. Also, "functional neuroanatomy" uses <a href="medical%20imaging">medical imaging</a> techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior.

Neurophysiologists study the chemical, pharmacological, and electrical properties of the brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in <a href="electroencephalography">EEG</a> studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for <a href="extracellular">extracellular</a> recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a>, in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for <a href="epileptic%20seizure">epileptic seizure</a>s. <a href="Functional%20imaging">Functional imaging</a> techniques such as <a href="functional%20magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">functional magnetic resonance imaging</a> are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.
Another approach to brain function is to examine the consequences of <a href="Brain%20damage">damage</a> to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and <a href="meninges">meninges</a>, surrounded by <a href="cerebrospinal%20fluid">cerebrospinal fluid</a>, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of <a href="stroke">stroke</a>s and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.

Computational neuroscience encompasses two approaches: first, the use of computers to study the brain; second, the study of how brains perform computation. On one hand, it is possible to write a computer program to simulate the operation of a group of neurons by making use of systems of equations that describe their electrochemical activity; such simulations are known as "<a href="Biological%20neural%20network">biologically realistic neural networks</a>". On the other hand, it is possible to study algorithms for neural computation by simulating, or mathematically analyzing, the operations of simplified "units" that have some of the properties of neurons but abstract out much of their biological complexity. The computational functions of the brain are studied both by computer scientists and neuroscientists.

<a href="Computational%20neurogenetic%20modeling">Computational neurogenetic modeling</a> is concerned with the study and development of dynamic neuronal models for modeling brain functions with respect to genes and dynamic interactions between genes.

Recent years have seen increasing applications of genetic and genomic techniques to the study of the brain and a focus on the roles of neurotrophic factors and physical activity in <a href="neuroplasticity">neuroplasticity</a>. The most common subjects are mice, because of the availability of technical tools. It is now possible with relative ease to "knock out" or mutate a wide variety of genes, and then examine the effects on brain function. More sophisticated approaches are also being used: for example, using <a href="Cre-Lox%20recombination">Cre-Lox recombination</a> it is possible to activate or deactivate genes in specific parts of the brain, at specific times.

The oldest brain to have been discovered was in <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> in the <a href="Areni-1%20cave%20complex">Areni-1 cave complex</a>. The brain, estimated to be over 5,000 years old, was found in the skull of a 12 to 14-year-old girl. Although the brains were shriveled, they were well preserved due to the climate found inside the cave.

Early philosophers were divided as to whether the seat of the soul lies in the brain or heart. Aristotle favored the heart, and thought that the function of the brain was merely to cool the blood. Democritus, the inventor of the atomic theory of matter, argued for a three-part soul, with intellect in the head, emotion in the heart, and lust near the liver. Hippocrates, the "father of medicine", came down unequivocally in favor of the brain. In his treatise on epilepsy he wrote:

The Roman physician <a href="Galen">Galen</a> also argued for the importance of the brain, and theorized in some depth about how it might work. Galen traced out the anatomical relationships among brain, nerves, and muscles, demonstrating that all muscles in the body are connected to the brain through a branching network of nerves. He postulated that nerves activate muscles mechanically by carrying a mysterious substance he called "pneumata psychikon", usually translated as "animal spirits". Galen's ideas were widely known during the Middle Ages, but not much further progress came until the Renaissance, when detailed anatomical study resumed, combined with the theoretical speculations of <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Descartes">René Descartes</a> and those who followed him. Descartes, like Galen, thought of the nervous system in hydraulic terms. He believed that the highest cognitive functions are carried out by a non-physical "res cogitans", but that the majority of behaviors of humans, and all behaviors of animals, could be explained mechanistically.

The first real progress toward a modern understanding of nervous function, though, came from the investigations of <a href="Luigi%20Galvani">Luigi Galvani</a>, who discovered that a shock of static electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract. Since that time, each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from the development of a new technique of investigation. Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for <a href="staining">staining</a> cells. Particularly critical was the invention of the <a href="Golgi%27s%20method">Golgi stain</a>, which (when correctly used) stains only a small fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including cell body, dendrites, and axon. Without such a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure. In the hands of <a href="Camillo%20Golgi">Camillo Golgi</a>, and especially of the Spanish neuroanatomist <a href="Santiago%20Ram%C3%B3n%20y%20Cajal">Santiago Ramón y Cajal</a>, the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity.
In the first half of the 20th century, advances in electronics enabled investigation of the electrical properties of nerve cells, culminating in work by <a href="Alan%20Lloyd%20Hodgkin">Alan Hodgkin</a>, <a href="Andrew%20Huxley">Andrew Huxley</a>, and others on the biophysics of the action potential, and the work of <a href="Bernard%20Katz">Bernard Katz</a> and others on the electrochemistry of the synapse. These studies complemented the anatomical picture with a conception of the brain as a dynamic entity. Reflecting the new understanding, in 1942 <a href="Charles%20Scott%20Sherrington">Charles Sherrington</a> visualized the workings of the brain waking from sleep:

The invention of electronic computers in the 1940s, along with the development of mathematical <a href="information%20theory">information theory</a>, led to a realization that brains can potentially be understood as information processing systems. This concept formed the basis of the field of <a href="cybernetics">cybernetics</a>, and eventually gave rise to the field now known as <a href="computational%20neuroscience">computational neuroscience</a>. The earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in that they treated the brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise, as for example in <a href="John%20von%20Neumann">John von Neumann</a>'s 1958 book, "<a href="The%20Computer%20and%20the%20Brain">The Computer and the Brain</a>". Over the years, though, accumulating information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism.

One of the most influential early contributions was a 1959 paper titled "What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain": the paper examined the visual responses of neurons in the <a href="retina">retina</a> and <a href="superior%20colliculus">optic tectum</a> of frogs, and came to the conclusion that some neurons in the tectum of the frog are wired to combine elementary responses in a way that makes them function as "bug perceivers". A few years later <a href="David%20H.%20Hubel">David Hubel</a> and <a href="Torsten%20Wiesel">Torsten Wiesel</a> discovered cells in the primary visual cortex of monkeys that become active when sharp edges move across specific points in the field of view—a discovery for which they won a Nobel Prize. Follow-up studies in higher-order visual areas found cells that detect <a href="binocular%20disparity">binocular disparity</a>, color, movement, and aspects of shape, with areas located at increasing distances from the primary visual cortex showing increasingly complex responses. Other investigations of brain areas unrelated to vision have revealed cells with a wide variety of response correlates, some related to memory, some to abstract types of cognition such as space.

Theorists have worked to understand these response patterns by constructing mathematical <a href="Nervous%20system%20network%20models">models of neurons and neural networks</a>, which can be simulated using computers. Some useful models are abstract, focusing on the conceptual structure of neural algorithms rather than the details of how they are implemented in the brain; other models attempt to incorporate data about the biophysical properties of real neurons. No model on any level is yet considered to be a fully valid description of brain function, though. The essential difficulty is that sophisticated computation by neural networks requires distributed processing in which hundreds or thousands of neurons work cooperatively—current methods of brain activity recording are only capable of isolating action potentials from a few dozen neurons at a time.

Furthermore, even single neurons appear to be complex and capable of performing computations. So, brain models that don't reflect this are too abstract to be representative of brain operation; models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational resources. However, the <a href="Human%20Brain%20Project">Human Brain Project</a> is trying to build a realistic, detailed computational model of the entire human brain. The wisdom of this approach has been publicly contested, with high-profile scientists on both sides of the argument.

In the second half of the 20th century, developments in chemistry, electron microscopy, genetics, computer science, functional brain imaging, and other fields progressively opened new windows into brain structure and function. In the United States, the 1990s were officially designated as the "<a href="Decade%20of%20the%20Brain">Decade of the Brain</a>" to commemorate advances made in brain research, and to promote funding for such research.

In the 21st century, these trends have continued, and several new approaches have come into prominence, including <a href="multielectrode%20array">multielectrode recording</a>, which allows the activity of many brain cells to be recorded all at the same time; <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a>, which allows molecular components of the brain to be altered experimentally; <a href="genomics">genomics</a>, which allows variations in brain structure to be correlated with variations in <a href="DNA">DNA</a> properties and <a href="neuroimaging">neuroimaging</a>.

Byzantium

Byzantium or Byzantion (; , "Byzántion") was an <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greek</a> colony in early antiquity that later became <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, and later <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>. Byzantium was colonized by the <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a> from <a href="Megara">Megara</a> in .

The etymology of "Byzantion" is unknown. It has been suggested that the name is of <a href="Thracians">Thraco</a>-<a href="Illyrians">Illyrian</a> origin. It may be derived from a Thracian or Illyrian personal name, "<a href="Byzas">Byzas</a>". Ancient Greek legend refers to a king <a href="Byzas">Byzas</a>, the leader of the Megarian colonists and founder of the city.
The form "Byzantium" is a <a href="Latinization%20%28literature%29">Latinisation</a> of the original name. Much later, the name "Byzantium" became common in the West to refer to the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a>, the ""Byzantine" Empire", whose capital Constantinople stood on the site of ancient Byzantium. This usage was introduced only in 1555 by the historian <a href="Hieronymus%20Wolf">Hieronymus Wolf</a>, a century after the empire had ceased to exist. During the time of the empire, the term "Byzantium" was restricted to just the city, rather than the empire it ruled.

At <a href="Seraglio%20Point">Seraglio Point</a> on the European side two fishing settlements, <a href="Lygos">Lygos</a> and <a href="Semistra">Semistra</a>, were situated. The origins of Byzantium are shrouded in legend. Traditional legend says <a href="Byzas">Byzas</a> from <a href="Megara">Megara</a> (a city-state near <a href="Athens">Athens</a>) founded Byzantium in 667 BC when he sailed northeast across the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a>. The tradition tells that Byzas, son of King <a href="Nisos">Nisos</a> (Νίσος), planned to found a colony of the <a href="Dorians">Dorian</a> Greek city of <a href="Megara">Megara</a>. Byzas consulted the <a href="Delphic%20oracle">oracle</a> of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> at <a href="Delphi">Delphi</a>, which instructed Byzas to settle opposite the "Land of the Blind". Leading a group of Megarian colonists, Byzas found a location where the <a href="Golden%20Horn">Golden Horn</a>, a great natural harbor, meets the <a href="Bosporus">Bosporus</a> and flows into the <a href="Sea%20of%20Marmara">Sea of Marmara</a>, opposite <a href="Chalcedon">Chalcedon</a> (modern day <a href="Kad%C4%B1k%C3%B6y">Kadıköy</a>). He adjudged the Chalcedonians blind not to have recognized the advantages the land on the <a href="Europe">Europe</a>an side of the <a href="Bosphorus">Bosporus</a> had over the Asiatic side. In 667 BC he founded Byzantium at their location, thus fulfilling the oracle's requirement. <a href="Cape%20Moda">Cape Moda</a> in <a href="Chalcedon">Chalcedon</a> was the first location the <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> settlers from <a href="Megara">Megara</a> chose to colonize in 685 BC, prior to colonizing <a href="Byzantion">Byzantion</a> on the European side of the Bosporus under the command of King <a href="Byzas">Byzas</a> in 667 BC.

It was mainly a trading city due to its location at the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>'s only entrance. Byzantium later conquered Chalcedon, across the Bosporus on the Asiatic side.

The city was taken by the <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Persian Empire</a> at the time of King <a href="Darius%20I">Darius I</a> (r. 522-486 BC) <a href="European%20Scythian%20campaign%20of%20Darius%20I">Scythian campaign</a> (513 BC), and was added to the administrative province of <a href="Skudra">Skudra</a>. Though <a href="Achaemenid%20Empire">Achaemenid</a> control of the city was never as stable as compared to other cities in <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a>, it was considered, alongside <a href="Sestos">Sestos</a>, to be one of the foremost Achaemenid ports on the European coast of the Bosporus and the <a href="Hellespont">Hellespont</a>.

Byzantium was besieged by Greek forces during the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a>. As part of <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>'s strategy for cutting off grain supplies to Athens, Sparta took the city in 411 BC. The <a href="Athenian%20military">Athenian military</a> later took the city in 408 BC.

After siding with <a href="Pescennius%20Niger">Pescennius Niger</a> against the victorious <a href="Septimius%20Severus">Septimius Severus</a>, the city was besieged by Roman forces and suffered extensive damage in 196 AD. Byzantium was rebuilt by Septimius Severus, now emperor, and quickly regained its previous prosperity. It was bound to <a href="Marmara%20Ere%C4%9Flisi">Perinthos</a> during the period of Septimius Severus. The location of Byzantium attracted <a href="Constantine%20I%20%28emperor%29">Roman Emperor Constantine I</a> who, in 330 AD, refounded it as an imperial residence inspired by Rome itself. (See <a href="New%20Rome">Nova Roma</a>.) After his death the city was called <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> (Greek Κωνσταντινούπολις, "Konstantinoupolis", "city of Constantine").

This combination of imperialism and location would affect Constantinople's role as the nexus between the continents of <a href="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="Asia">Asia</a>. It was a commercial, cultural, and diplomatic centre. With its strategic position, Constantinople controlled the major trade routes between Asia and Europe, as well as the passage from the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> to the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>. On May 29, 1453, the city fell to the <a href="Ottoman%20Turks">Ottoman Turks</a>, and again became the capital of a powerful state, the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. The Turks called the city "Istanbul" (although it was not officially renamed until 1930); the name derives from "eis-tin-polin" (Greek: "to-the-city"). To this day it remains the largest and most populous city in Turkey, although <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a> is now the national capital.

By the late <a href="Hellenistic%20civilization">Hellenistic</a> or early Roman period (1st century BC), the <a href="star%20and%20crescent">star and crescent</a> motif was associated to some degree with Byzantium; even though it became more widely used as the royal emblem of <a href="Mithradates%20VI%20Eupator">Mithradates VI Eupator</a> (who for a time incorporated the city into his empire).

Some Byzantine coins of the 1st century BC and later show the head of <a href="Artemis">Artemis</a> with bow and quiver, and feature a crescent with what appears to be an eight-rayed star on the reverse. 
According to accounts which vary in some of the details, in 340 BC the Byzantines and their allies the <a href="Classical%20Athens">Athenians</a> were under siege by the troops of <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip of Macedon</a>. On a particularly dark and wet night Philip attempted a surprise attack but was thwarted by the appearance of a bright light in the sky. This light is occasionally described by subsequent interpreters as a meteor, sometimes as the moon, and some accounts also mention the barking of dogs. However, the original accounts mention only a light in the sky, without specifying the moon. To commemorate the event the Byzantines erected a statue of <a href="Hecate">Hecate</a> "lampadephoros" (light-bearer or bringer). This story survived in the works of <a href="Hesychius%20of%20Miletus">Hesychius of Miletus</a>, who in all probability lived in the time of <a href="Justinian%20I">Justinian I</a>. His works survive only in fragments preserved in <a href="Photius">Photius</a> and the tenth century lexicographer <a href="Suda">Suidas</a>. The tale is also related by <a href="Stephanus%20of%20Byzantium">Stephanus of Byzantium</a>, and <a href="Eustathius%20of%20Thessalonica">Eustathius</a>.

Devotion to <a href="Hecate">Hecate</a> was especially favored by the Byzantines for her aid in having protected them from the incursions of Philip of Macedon. Her symbols were the crescent and star, and the walls of her city were her provenance.

It is unclear precisely how the symbol Hecate/Artemis, one of many goddesses would have been transferred to the city itself, but it seems likely to have been an effect of being credited with the intervention against Philip and the subsequent honors. This was a common process in ancient Greece, as in "Athens" where the city was named after "Athena" in honor of such an intervention in time of war.

Later, under the Romans, cities in the empire often continued to issue their own coinage. "Of the many themes that were used on local coinage, celestial and astral symbols often appeared, mostly stars or crescent moons." The wide variety of these issues, and the varying explanations for the significance of the star and crescent on Roman coinage precludes their discussion here. It is, however, apparent that by the time of the Romans, coins featuring a star or crescent in some combination were not at all rare.

<doc id="3722" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3722" title="Berlin Wall">
Berlin Wall

The Berlin Wall () was a guarded concrete <a href="Separation%20barrier">barrier</a> that physically and ideologically divided <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> from 1961 to 1989. Constructed by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a>), starting on 13 August 1961, the Wall completely cut off (by land) <a href="West%20Berlin">West Berlin</a> from surrounding <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a> and from <a href="East%20Berlin">East Berlin</a> until government officials opened it in November 1989. Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and finished in 1992. The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, accompanied by a wide area (later known as the "death strip") that contained anti-vehicle trenches, "<a href="bed%20of%20nails">fakir beds</a>" and other defenses. The <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the "will of the people" in building a <a href="Communism">socialist state</a> in East Germany. In practice, the Wall served to prevent the massive <a href="Eastern%20Bloc%20emigration%20and%20defection">emigration and defection</a> that had marked East Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc during the post-World War II period.

GDR authorities officially referred to the Berlin Wall as the Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart (), by implication ranking the <a href="NATO">NATO</a> countries (and <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> in particular) equal to <a href="fascism">fascists</a>. The West Berlin city government sometimes referred to it as the "<a href="Wall%20of%20Shame">Wall of Shame</a>", a term coined by mayor <a href="Willy%20Brandt">Willy Brandt</a> in reference to the Wall's restriction on <a href="freedom%20of%20movement">freedom of movement</a>. Along with the separate and much longer <a href="Inner%20German%20border">Inner German border</a> (IGB), which demarcated the border between East and <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>, it came to symbolize physically the "<a href="Iron%20Curtain">Iron Curtain</a>" that separated Western Europe and the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>.

Before the Wall's erection, 3.5 million East Germans circumvented <a href="Eastern%20Bloc%20emigration%20and%20defection">Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions</a> and defected from the GDR, many by crossing over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin; from which they could then travel to West Germany and to other Western European countries. Between 1961 and 1989 the Wall prevented almost all such emigration. During this period around 5,000 people attempted to escape over the Wall, with an estimated death toll ranging from 136 to more than 200 in and around Berlin.

In 1989 a <a href="Revolutions%20of%201989">series of revolutions</a> in nearby Eastern Bloc countries—<a href="Poland">Poland</a> and <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> in particular—caused a chain reaction in East Germany that ultimately resulted in the demise of the Wall. After several weeks of civil unrest, the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin. Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the Wall, joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere. Over the next few weeks, euphoric people and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the Wall; the governments later used industrial equipment to remove most of what was left. Contrary to popular belief, the Wall's actual demolition did not begin until the summer of 1990 and continued until 1992. The "fall of the Berlin Wall" paved the way for <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a>, which formally took place on 3 October 1990.

After the <a href="end%20of%20World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe">end of World War II in Europe</a>, what remained of pre-war Germany west of the <a href="Oder-Neisse%20line">Oder-Neisse line</a> was divided into four occupation zones (as per the <a href="Potsdam%20Agreement">Potsdam Agreement</a>), each one controlled by one of the four occupying <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied powers</a>: the <a href="United%20States%20of%20America">United States</a>, the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Northern%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a>, <a href="France">France</a> and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. The capital of Berlin, as the seat of the <a href="Allied%20Control%20Council">Allied Control Council</a>, was similarly subdivided into four sectors despite the city's location, which was fully within the Soviet zone.

Within two years, political divisions increased between the Soviets and the other occupying powers. These included the Soviets' refusal to agree to reconstruction plans making post-war Germany self-sufficient and to a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets. France, the United Kingdom, the United States and the <a href="Benelux">Benelux</a> countries later met to combine the non-Soviet zones of the country into one zone for reconstruction and to approve the extension of the <a href="Marshall%20Plan">Marshall Plan</a>.

Following World War II, Soviet leader <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> headed a group of nations on his Western border, the Eastern Bloc, that then included Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, which he wished to maintain alongside a weakened Soviet-controlled Germany. As early as 1945, Stalin revealed to German communist leaders that he expected to slowly undermine the British position within the British occupation zone, that the United States would withdraw within a year or two, and that nothing would then stand in the way of a united communist Germany within the bloc.

The major task of the ruling communist party in the Soviet zone was to channel Soviet orders down to both the administrative apparatus and the other bloc parties, which in turn would be presented as internal measures. Property and industry was nationalized in the East German zone. If statements or decisions deviated from the described line, reprimands and (for persons outside public attention) punishment would ensue, such as imprisonment, torture and even death.

Indoctrination of <a href="Marxism-Leninism">Marxism-Leninism</a> became a compulsory part of school curricula, sending professors and students fleeing to the West. The East Germans created an elaborate political police apparatus that kept the population under close surveillance, including Soviet <a href="SMERSH">SMERSH</a> secret police.

In 1948, following disagreements regarding reconstruction and a new German currency, Stalin instituted the <a href="Berlin%20Blockade">Berlin Blockade</a>, preventing food, materials and supplies from arriving in <a href="West%20Berlin">West Berlin</a>. The United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and several other countries began a massive "<a href="Berlin%20airlift">airlift</a>", supplying West Berlin with food and other supplies. The Soviets mounted a public relations campaign against the Western policy change. Communists attempted to disrupt the elections of 1948, preceding large losses therein, while 300,000 Berliners demonstrated for the international airlift to continue. In May 1949, Stalin lifted the blockade, permitting the resumption of Western shipments to Berlin.

The German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was declared on 7 October 1949. By a secret treaty, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs accorded the East German state administrative authority, but not autonomy. The Soviets permeated East German administrative, military and secret police structures and had full control.

East Germany differed from West Germany (<a href="West%20Germany">Federal Republic of Germany</a>), which developed into a <a href="Western%20civilization">Western</a> capitalist country with a <a href="social%20market%20economy">social market economy</a> (' in German) and a <a href="democracy">democratic</a> parliamentary government. Continual economic growth starting in the 1950s fuelled a 20-year "<a href="Wirtschaftswunder">economic miracle</a>" ('). As West Germany's economy grew, and its standard of living steadily improved, many East Germans wanted to move to West Germany.

After the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe at the end of World War II, the majority of those living in the newly acquired areas of the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> aspired to independence and wanted the Soviets to leave. Taking advantage of the zonal border between occupied zones in Germany, the number of GDR citizens moving to West Germany totaled 187,000 in 1950; 165,000 in 1951; 182,000 in 1952; and 331,000 in 1953. One reason for the sharp 1953 increase was fear of potential further <a href="Sovietization">Sovietization</a>, given the increasingly paranoid actions of <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> in late 1952 and early 1953. 226,000 had fled in just the first six months of 1953.

By the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to controlling national movement, restricting emigration, was emulated by most of the rest of the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>, including East Germany. The restrictions presented a quandary for some Eastern Bloc states, which had been more economically advanced and open than the Soviet Union, such that crossing borders seemed more natural—especially where no prior border existed between East and West Germany.

Up until 1952, the demarcation lines between East Germany and the western occupied zones could be easily crossed in most places. On 1 April 1952, East German leaders met the Soviet leader <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> in Moscow; during the discussions Stalin's foreign minister <a href="Vyacheslav%20Molotov">Vyacheslav Molotov</a> proposed that the East Germans should "introduce a system of passes for visits of West Berlin residents to the territory of East Berlin [so as to stop] free movement of Western agents" in the GDR. Stalin agreed, calling the situation "intolerable". He advised the East Germans to build up their border defenses, telling them that "The demarcation line between East and West Germany should be considered a border—and not just any border, but a dangerous one ... The Germans will guard the line of defence with their lives."

Consequently, the <a href="inner%20German%20border">inner German border</a> between the two German states was closed, and a barbed-wire fence erected. The border between the Western and Eastern sectors of Berlin, however, remained open, although traffic between the Soviet and the Western sectors was somewhat restricted. This resulted in Berlin becoming a magnet for East Germans desperate to escape life in the GDR, and also a flashpoint for tension between the United States and the Soviet Union.

In 1955, the Soviets gave East Germany authority over civilian movement in Berlin, passing control to a regime not recognized in the West. Initially, East Germany granted "visits" to allow its residents access to West Germany. However, following the defection of large numbers of East Germans under this regime, the new East German state legally restricted virtually all travel to the West in 1956. Soviet East German ambassador <a href="Mikhail%20Pervukhin">Mikhail Pervukhin</a> observed that "the presence in Berlin of an open and essentially uncontrolled border between the socialist and capitalist worlds unwittingly prompts the population to make a comparison between both parts of the city, which unfortunately does not always turn out in favour of Democratic [East] Berlin."

With the closing of the inner German border officially in 1952, the border in Berlin remained considerably more accessible then because it was administered by all four occupying powers. Accordingly, Berlin became the main route by which East Germans left for the West. On 11 December 1957, East Germany introduced a new passport law that reduced the overall number of refugees leaving Eastern Germany.

It had the unintended result of drastically increasing the percentage of those leaving through West Berlin from 60% to well over 90% by the end of 1958. Those caught trying to leave East Berlin were subjected to heavy penalties, but with no physical barrier and <a href="Berlin%20U-Bahn">subway</a> train access still available to West Berlin, such measures were ineffective. The Berlin sector border was essentially a "<a href="loophole">loophole</a>" through which Eastern Bloc citizens could still escape. The 3.5 million East Germans who had left by 1961 totalled approximately 20% of the entire East German population.

An important reason that the West Berlin border was not closed earlier was that doing so would cut off much of the railway traffic in East Germany. Construction of a new railway bypassing West Berlin, the <a href="Berlin%20outer%20ring">Berlin outer ring</a>, commenced in 1951. Following the completion of the railway in 1961, closing the border became a more practical proposition.

The emigrants tended to be young and well-educated, leading to the "brain drain" feared by officials in East Germany. <a href="Yuri%20Andropov">Yuri Andropov</a>, then the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">CPSU</a> Director on Relations with Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries, wrote an urgent letter on 28 August 1958, to the Central Committee about the significant 50% increase in the number of East German intelligentsia among the refugees. Andropov reported that, while the East German leadership stated that they were leaving for economic reasons, testimony from refugees indicated that the reasons were more political than material. He stated "the flight of the intelligentsia has reached a particularly critical phase."

An East German <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">SED</a> propaganda booklet published in 1955 dramatically described the serious nature of <a href="Republikflucht">'flight from the republic'</a>:

By 1960, the combination of World War II and the massive emigration westward left East Germany with only 61% of its population of working age, compared to 70.5% before the war. The loss was disproportionately heavy among professionals: engineers, technicians, physicians, teachers, lawyers and skilled workers. The direct cost of manpower losses to East Germany (and corresponding gain to the West) has been estimated at $7 billion to $9 billion, with East German party leader <a href="Walter%20Ulbricht">Walter Ulbricht</a> later claiming that West Germany owed him $17 billion in compensation, including reparations as well as manpower losses. In addition, the drain of East Germany's young population potentially cost it over 22.5 billion marks in lost educational investment. The brain drain of professionals had become so damaging to the political credibility and economic viability of East Germany that the re-securing of the German communist frontier was imperative.

The exodus of emigrants from East Germany presented two minor potential benefits: an easy opportunity to smuggle East German secret agents to West Germany, and a reduction in the number of citizens hostile to the communist regime. Neither of these advantages, however, proved particularly useful.

On 15 June 1961, First Secretary of the <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">Socialist Unity Party</a> and <a href="Staatsrat">GDR State Council</a> chairman <a href="Walter%20Ulbricht">Walter Ulbricht</a> stated in an international press conference, ' (No one has the intention of erecting a wall!). It was the first time the colloquial term ' (wall) had been used in this context.

The transcript of a telephone call between <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> and Ulbricht on 1 August in the same year, suggests that the initiative for the construction of the Wall came from Khrushchev. However, other sources suggest that Khrushchev had initially been wary about building a wall, fearing negative Western reaction. What is beyond dispute, though, is that Ulbricht had pushed for a border closure for quite some time, arguing that East Germany's very existence was at stake.

Khrushchev had been emboldened by US President John F. Kennedy's tacit indication that the US would not actively oppose this action in the Soviet sector of Berlin. On Saturday, 12 August 1961, the leaders of the GDR attended a garden party at a government guesthouse in , in a wooded area to the north of East Berlin. There signed the order to close the border and erect a wall.

At midnight, the police and units of the East German army began to close the border and, by Sunday morning, 13 August, the border with West Berlin was closed. East German troops and workers had begun to tear up streets running alongside the border to make them impassable to most vehicles and to install barbed wire entanglements and fences along the around the three western sectors, and the that divided West and East Berlin. The date of 13 August became commonly referred to as <a href="Barbed%20Wire%20Sunday">Barbed Wire Sunday</a> in Germany.

The barrier was built inside East Berlin or East German territory to ensure that it did not encroach on West Berlin at any point. Generally, the Wall was only slightly inside East Berlin, but in a few places it was some distance from the legal border, most notably at <a href="Berlin%20Potsdamer%20Bahnhof">Potsdamer Bahnhof</a> and the Lenné Triangle that is now much of the <a href="Potsdamer%20Platz">Potsdamer Platz</a> development.

Later, the initial barrier was built up into the Wall proper, the first concrete elements and large blocks being put in place on 17 August. During the construction of the Wall, <a href="National%20People%27s%20Army">National People's Army</a> (NVA) and <a href="Combat%20Groups%20of%20the%20Working%20Class">Combat Groups of the Working Class</a> (KdA) soldiers stood in front of it with orders to shoot anyone who attempted to defect. Additionally, chain fences, walls, minefields and other obstacles were installed along the length of East Germany's western border with West Germany proper. A huge no man's land was cleared to provide a clear line of fire at fleeing refugees.

With the closing of the East-West sector boundary in Berlin, the vast majority of East Germans could no longer travel or emigrate to West Germany. Berlin soon went from being the easiest place to make an unauthorized crossing between East and West Germany to being the most difficult. Many families were split, while East Berliners employed in the West were cut off from their jobs. West Berlin became an isolated <a href="exclave">exclave</a> in a hostile land. West Berliners demonstrated against the Wall, led by their Mayor () Willy Brandt, who strongly criticized the United States for failing to respond. Allied intelligence agencies had hypothesized about a wall to stop the flood of refugees, but the main candidate for its location was around the perimeter of the city. In 1961, Secretary of State Dean Rusk proclaimed, "The Wall certainly ought not to be a permanent feature of the European landscape. I see no reason why the Soviet Union should think it is—it is to their advantage in any way to leave there that monument to communist failure."

United States and UK sources had expected the Soviet sector to be sealed off from West Berlin, but were surprised by how long the East Germans took for such a move. They considered the Wall as an end to concerns about a GDR/Soviet retaking or capture of the whole of Berlin; the Wall would presumably have been an unnecessary project if such plans were afloat. Thus they concluded that the possibility of a Soviet military conflict over Berlin had decreased.

The East German government claimed that the Wall was an "anti-fascist protective rampart" () intended to dissuade aggression from the West. Another official justification was the activities of Western agents in Eastern Europe. The Eastern German government also claimed that West Berliners were buying out state-subsidized goods in East Berlin. East Germans and others greeted such statements with skepticism, as most of the time, the border was only closed for citizens of East Germany traveling to the West, but not for residents of West Berlin travelling to the East. The construction of the Wall had caused considerable hardship to families divided by it. Most people believed that the Wall was mainly a means of preventing the citizens of East Germany from entering or fleeing to West Berlin.

The <a href="National%20Security%20Agency">National Security Agency</a> was the only American intelligence agency that was aware that East Germany was to take action to deal with the brain drain problem. On 9 August 1961, the NSA intercepted an advance warning information of the <a href="Socialist%20Unity%20Party%20of%20Germany">Socialist Unity Party's</a> plan to close the intra-Berlin border between East and West Berlin completely for foot traffic. The interagency intelligence Berlin Watch Committee assessed that this intercept "might be the first step in a plan to close the border." This warning did not reach U.S. President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> until noon on 13 August 1961, while he was vacationing in his yacht off the <a href="Kennedy%20Compound">Kennedy Compound</a> in <a href="Hyannis%20Port%2C%20Massachusetts">Hyannis Port, Massachusetts</a>. While Kennedy was angry that he had no advance warning, he was relieved that the East Germans and the Soviets had only divided Berlin without taking any action against West Berlin's access to the West. However, he denounced the Berlin Wall, whose erection worsened the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.

In response to the erection of the Berlin Wall, a retired general, <a href="Lucius%20D.%20Clay">Lucius D. Clay</a>, was appointed by Kennedy as his special advisor and sent to Berlin with ambassadorial rank. Clay had been the Military Governor of the US Zone of Occupation in Germany during the period of the Berlin Blockade and had ordered the first measures in what became the <a href="Berlin%20Airlift">Berlin Airlift</a>. He was immensely popular with the residents of West Berlin, and his appointment was an unambiguous sign that Kennedy would not compromise on the status of West Berlin. Clay and Vice President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> arrived at <a href="Tempelhof%20International%20Airport">Tempelhof Airport</a> on the afternoon of Saturday, 19 August 1961.

They arrived in a city defended by three <a href="Berlin%20Brigade">Allied brigades</a>—one each from the UK, the US, and France (the <a href="Forces%20Fran%C3%A7aises%20%C3%A0%20Berlin">Forces Françaises à Berlin</a>). On 16 August, Kennedy had given the order for them to be reinforced. Early on 19 August, the 1st Battle Group, 18th Infantry (commanded by Colonel Glover S. Johns Jr.) was alerted.

On Sunday morning, U.S. troops marched from West Germany through East Germany, bound for West Berlin. Lead elements—arranged in a column of 491 vehicles and trailers carrying 1,500 men, divided into five march units—left the Helmstedt-Marienborn checkpoint at 06:34. At <a href="Marienborn">Marienborn</a>, the Soviet checkpoint next to <a href="Helmstedt">Helmstedt</a> on the West German-East German border, US personnel were counted by guards. The column was long, and covered from Marienborn to Berlin in full battle gear. East German police watched from beside trees next to the <a href="autobahn">autobahn</a> all the way along.

The front of the convoy arrived at the outskirts of Berlin just before noon, to be met by Clay and Johnson, before parading through the streets of Berlin in front of a large crowd. At 04:00 on 21 August, Lyndon Johnson left West Berlin in the hands of General Frederick O. Hartel and his brigade of 4,224 officers and men. Every three months for the next three and a half years, a new American battalion was rotated into West Berlin; each traveled by autobahn to demonstrate Allied rights.

The creation of the Wall had important implications for both German states. By stemming the exodus of people from East Germany, the East German government was able to reassert its control over the country: in spite of discontent with the Wall, economic problems caused by dual currency and the black market were largely eliminated. The economy in the GDR began to grow. But, the Wall proved a public relations disaster for the communist bloc as a whole. Western powers portrayed it as a symbol of communist tyranny, particularly after East German border guards shot and killed would-be defectors. Such fatalities were later treated as acts of murder by the reunified Germany.

The Berlin Wall was more than long. In June 1962, a second, parallel fence was built some farther into East German territory. The houses contained between the fences were razed and the inhabitants relocated, thus establishing what later became known as the "death strip". The death strip was covered with raked sand or gravel, rendering footprints easy to notice, easing the detection of trespassers and also enabling officers to see which guards had neglected their task; it offered no cover; and, most importantly, it offered clear fields of fire for the Wall guards. About 45.1 kilometres of the wall are at the centre strips of Berlin, and 112.7 kilometres crossing through the Berlin outer circle. 63.8 km of the frontier were in built, 32 km in wooded and 22.65 km in open terrain and 37.95 km of the boundary lay in or on rivers, lakes and canals. Most of them were dismantled beginning with the wall peckers as souvenirs from 11 November 1989, then dismantling the metal mesh fence along the death strip all the way until 22 December 1989. Observation towers began to be dismantled all the way till April 1990. Dismantling of the wall is shown at the below mentioned section (<a href="Berlin%20Wall%23Demolition">Demolition</a>. Some of them were sold for scrap including the anti-tank wall, normal walls were sent to storage area in the southern part of Germany till it was auctioned and collected (<a href="List%20of%20Berlin%20Wall%20segments">List of Berlin Wall segments</a>).

Through the years, the Berlin Wall evolved through four versions:

The "fourth-generation Wall", known officially as "" (retaining wall element UL 12.11), was the final and most sophisticated version of the Wall. Begun in 1975 and completed about 1980, it was constructed from 45,000 separate sections of reinforced concrete, each high and wide, and cost <a href="East%20German%20mark">DDM</a>16,155,000 or about US$3,638,000. The concrete provisions added to this version of the Wall were done to prevent escapees from driving their cars through the barricades. At strategic points, the Wall was constructed to a somewhat weaker standard, so that East German and Soviet armored vehicles could easily break through in the event of war.

The top of the wall was lined with a smooth pipe, intended to make it more difficult to scale. The Wall was reinforced by mesh <a href="fence">fencing</a>, signal fencing, anti-vehicle trenches, <a href="barbed%20wire">barbed wire</a>, dogs on long lines, "<a href="bed%20of%20nails">beds of nails</a>" (also known as "Stalin's Carpet") under balconies hanging over the "death strip", over 116 <a href="watchtower%20%28fortification%29">watchtowers</a>, and 20 <a href="bunker">bunker</a>s with hundreds of guards. This version of the Wall is the one most commonly seen in photographs, and <a href="List%20of%20Berlin%20Wall%20portions">surviving fragments</a> of the Wall in Berlin and elsewhere around the world are generally pieces of the fourth-generation Wall. The layout came to resemble the <a href="inner%20German%20border">inner German border</a> in most technical aspects, except that the Berlin Wall had no landmines nor <a href="spring-gun">spring-gun</a>s.

Besides the sector-sector boundary within Berlin itself, the Wall also separated West Berlin from the present-day state of <a href="Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a>. The following present-day municipalities, listed in counter-clockwise direction, share a border with former West Berlin:

There were nine border crossings between East and West Berlin. These allowed visits by West Berliners, other West Germans, Western foreigners and Allied personnel into East Berlin, as well as visits by GDR citizens and citizens of other socialist countries into West Berlin, provided that they held the necessary permits. These crossings were restricted according to which nationality was allowed to use it (East Germans, West Germans, West Berliners, other countries). The most famous was the vehicle and pedestrian checkpoint at the corner of <a href="Friedrichstra%C3%9Fe">Friedrichstraße</a> and Zimmerstraße, also known as <a href="Checkpoint%20Charlie">Checkpoint Charlie</a>, which was restricted to Allied personnel and foreigners.

Several other border crossings existed between West Berlin and surrounding East Germany. These could be used for transit between West Germany and West Berlin, for visits by West Berliners into East Germany, for transit into countries neighbouring East Germany (Poland, <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, Denmark), and for visits by East Germans into West Berlin carrying a permit. After the 1972 agreements, new crossings were opened to allow West Berlin waste to be transported into East German dumps, as well as some crossings for access to West Berlin's <a href="exclave">exclave</a>s (see "<a href="Steinst%C3%BCcken">Steinstücken</a>").

Four <a href="autobahn">autobahn</a>s connected West Berlin to West Germany, the most famous being the <a href="Bundesautobahn%202">Berlin-Helmstedt autobahn</a>, which entered East German territory between the towns of Helmstedt and Marienborn (Checkpoint Alpha), and which entered West Berlin at Dreilinden (Checkpoint Bravo for the Allied forces) in southwestern Berlin. Access to West Berlin was also possible by railway (four routes) and by boat for commercial shipping via canals and rivers.

Non-German Westerners could cross the border at <a href="Berlin%20Friedrichstra%C3%9Fe%20railway%20station">Friedrichstraße station</a> in East Berlin and at Checkpoint Charlie. When the Wall was erected, Berlin's complex public transit networks, the <a href="Berlin%20S-Bahn">S-Bahn</a> and <a href="Berlin%20U-Bahn">U-Bahn</a>, were divided with it. Some lines were cut in half; many stations were shut down. Three western lines traveled through brief sections of East Berlin territory, passing through eastern stations (called "," or <a href="ghost%20station">ghost station</a>s) without stopping. Both the eastern and western networks converged at , which became a major crossing point for those (mostly Westerners) with permission to cross.

West Germans and citizens of other Western countries could generally visit East Germany, often after applying for a <a href="visa%20%28document%29">visa</a> at an East German embassy several weeks in advance. Visas for day trips restricted to East Berlin were issued without previous application in a simplified procedure at the border crossing. However, East German authorities could refuse entry permits without stating a reason. In the 1980s, visitors from the western part of the city who wanted to visit the eastern part had to exchange at least DM 25 into East German currency at the poor exchange rate of 1:1. It was forbidden to export East German currency from the East, but money not spent could be left at the border for possible future visits. Tourists crossing from the west had to also pay for a visa, which cost DM 5; West Berliners did not have to pay this.

West Berliners initially could not visit East Berlin or East Germany at all – all crossing points were closed to them between 26 August 1961 and 17 December 1963. In 1963, negotiations between East and West resulted in a limited possibility for visits during the Christmas season that year (""). Similar, very limited arrangements were made in 1964, 1965 and 1966.

In 1971, with the <a href="Four%20Power%20Agreement%20on%20Berlin">Four Power Agreement on Berlin</a>, agreements were reached that allowed West Berliners to apply for visas to enter East Berlin and East Germany regularly, comparable to the regulations already in force for West Germans. However, East German authorities could still refuse entry permits.

East Berliners and East Germans could not, at first, travel to West Berlin or West Germany at all. This regulation remained in force essentially until the fall of the Wall, but over the years several exceptions to these rules were introduced, the most significant being:

For each of these exceptions, GDR citizens had to apply for individual approval, which was never guaranteed. In addition, even if travel was approved, GDR travellers could exchange only a very small amount of <a href="East%20German%20Mark">East German Mark</a>s into <a href="Deutsche%20Mark">Deutsche Mark</a>s (DM), thus limiting the financial resources available for them to travel to the West. This led to the West German practice of granting a small amount of DM annually ("<a href="Begr%C3%BC%C3%9Fungsgeld">Begrüßungsgeld</a>", or welcome money) to GDR citizens visiting West Germany and West Berlin to help alleviate this situation.

Citizens of other East European countries were in general subject to the same prohibition of visiting Western countries as East Germans, though the applicable exception (if any) varied from country to country.

Allied military personnel and civilian officials of the Allied forces could enter and exit East Berlin without submitting to East German passport controls, purchasing a visa or being required to exchange money. Likewise, Soviet military patrols could enter and exit West Berlin. This was a requirement of the post-war <a href="Allied%20Control%20Council">Four Powers</a> Agreements. A particular area of concern for the Western Allies involved official dealings with East German authorities when crossing the border, since Allied policy did not recognize the authority of the GDR to regulate Allied military traffic to and from West Berlin, as well as the Allied presence within Greater Berlin, including entry into, exit from, and presence within East Berlin.

The Allies held that only the Soviet Union, and not the GDR, had authority to regulate Allied personnel in such cases. For this reason, elaborate procedures were established to prevent inadvertent recognition of East German authority when engaged in travel through the GDR and when in East Berlin. Special rules applied to travel by Western Allied military personnel assigned to the <a href="Military%20Liaison%20Missions">Military Liaison Missions</a> accredited to the commander of Soviet forces in East Germany, located in <a href="Potsdam">Potsdam</a>.

Allied personnel were restricted by policy when travelling by land to the following routes:



As with military personnel, special procedures applied to travel by diplomatic personnel of the Western Allies accredited to their respective embassies in the GDR. This was intended to prevent inadvertent recognition of East German authority when crossing between East and West Berlin, which could jeopardize the overall Allied position governing the freedom of movement by Allied forces personnel within all Berlin.

Ordinary citizens of the Western Allied powers, not formally affiliated with the Allied forces, were authorized to use all designated transit routes through East Germany to and from West Berlin. Regarding travel to East Berlin, such persons could also use the Friedrichstraße train station to enter and exit the city, in addition to Checkpoint Charlie. In these instances, such travelers, unlike Allied personnel, had to submit to East German border controls.

During the years of the Wall, around 5,000 people successfully defected to West Berlin. The number of people who died trying to cross the Wall, or as a result of the Wall's existence, has been disputed. The most vocal claims by <a href="Alexandra%20Hildebrandt">Alexandra Hildebrandt</a>, Director of the <a href="Checkpoint%20Charlie%20Museum">Checkpoint Charlie Museum</a> and widow of the Museum's founder, estimated the death toll to be well above 200. A historic research group at the <a href="Center%20for%20Contemporary%20Historical%20Research">Center for Contemporary Historical Research</a> (<a href="ZZF">ZZF</a>) in <a href="Potsdam">Potsdam</a> has confirmed 136 deaths. Prior official figures listed 98 as being killed.

The East German government issued shooting orders (<a href="Schie%C3%9Fbefehl">Schießbefehl</a>) to border guards dealing with defectors, though such orders are not the same as "shoot to kill" orders. GDR officials denied issuing the latter. In an October 1973 order later discovered by researchers, guards were instructed that people attempting to cross the Wall were criminals and needed to be shot: "Do not hesitate to use your firearm, not even when the border is breached in the company of women and children, which is a tactic the traitors have often used".

Early successful escapes involved people jumping the initial barbed wire or leaping out of apartment windows along the line, but these ended as the Wall was fortified. East German authorities no longer permitted apartments near the Wall to be occupied, and any building near the Wall had its windows boarded and later bricked up. On 15 August 1961, <a href="Conrad%20Schumann">Conrad Schumann</a> was the first East German border guard to escape by jumping the barbed wire to West Berlin.

On 22 August 1961, <a href="Ida%20Siekmann">Ida Siekmann</a> was the first casualty at the Berlin Wall: she died after she jumped out of her third floor apartment at 48 <a href="Bernauer%20Strasse">Bernauer Strasse</a>. The first person to be shot and killed while trying to cross to West Berlin was Günter Litfin, a twenty-four-year-old tailor. He attempted to swim across the Spree Canal to West Germany on 24 August 1961, the same day that East German police had received shoot-to-kill orders to prevent anyone from escaping.

Another dramatic escape was carried out on April 1963 by <a href="Wolfgang%20Engels">Wolfgang Engels</a>, a 19-year-old civilian employee of the <a href="Nationale%20Volksarmee">Nationale Volksarmee</a>. Engels stole a Soviet <a href="armored%20personnel%20carrier">armored personnel carrier</a> from a base where he was deployed and drove it right into the Wall. He was fired at and seriously wounded by border guards. But a West German policeman intervened, firing his weapon at the East German border guards. The policeman removed Engels from the vehicle, which had become entangled in the barbed wire.
East Germans successfully defected by a variety of methods: digging long tunnels under the Wall, waiting for favorable winds and taking a <a href="Night%20Crossing">hot air balloon</a>, sliding along aerial wires, flying <a href="ultralight%20aviation">ultralights</a> and, in one instance, simply driving a sports car at full speed through the basic, initial fortifications. When a metal beam was placed at checkpoints to prevent this kind of defection, up to four people (two in the front seats and possibly two in the <a href="Trunk%20%28automobile%29">boot</a>) drove under the bar in a sports car that had been modified to allow the roof and windscreen to come away when it made contact with the beam. They lay flat and kept driving forward. The East Germans then built zig-zagging roads at checkpoints. The sewer system predated the Wall, and some people escaped through the sewers, in a number of cases with assistance from the <a href="Unternehmen%20Reiseb%C3%BCro">Unternehmen Reisebüro</a>.

An airborne escape was made by Thomas Krüger, who landed a <a href="Zlin%20Z%2042">Zlin Z 42</a>M light aircraft of the <a href="Gesellschaft%20f%C3%BCr%20Sport%20und%20Technik">Gesellschaft für Sport und Technik</a>, an East German youth military training organization, at <a href="Gatow%20Airport">RAF Gatow</a>. His aircraft, registration DDR-WOH, was dismantled and returned to the East Germans by road, complete with humorous slogans painted on it by <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">RAF</a> airmen, such as "Wish you were here" and "Come back soon". DDR-WOH is still flying today, but under the registration <a href="D-EWOH">D-EWOH</a>.

If an escapee was wounded in a crossing attempt and lay on the death strip, no matter how close they were to the Western wall, Westerners could not intervene for fear of triggering engaging fire from the 'Grepos', the East Berlin border guards. The guards often let fugitives bleed to death in the middle of this ground, as in the most notorious failed attempt, that of <a href="Peter%20Fechter">Peter Fechter</a> (aged 18). He was shot and bled to death, in full view of the Western media, on 17 August 1962. Fechter's death created negative publicity worldwide that led the leaders of East Berlin to place more restrictions on shooting in public places, and provide medical care for possible "would-be escapers". The last person to be shot and killed while trying to cross the border was <a href="Chris%20Gueffroy">Chris Gueffroy</a> on 6 February 1989, while the final person to die in an escape attempt was <a href="Winfried%20Freudenberg">Winfried Freudenberg</a> who was killed when his homemade <a href="natural%20gas">natural gas</a>-filled <a href="aerostat">balloon</a> crashed on 8 March 1989.

The Wall gave rise to a widespread sense of desperation and oppression in East Berlin, as expressed in the private thoughts of one resident, who confided to her diary "Our lives have lost their spirit…we can do nothing to stop them."

On 6 June 1987, <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>, who earlier for several years lived and recorded in West Berlin, played <a href="Glass%20Spider%20Tour">a concert close to the Wall</a>. This was attended by thousands of Eastern concertgoers across the Wall, followed by violent rioting in East Berlin. According to Tobias Ruther, these protests in East Berlin were the first in the sequence of riots that led to those of November 1989.
Although other factors were probably more influential in the fall of the Wall, on his death, the <a href="Foreign%20Office%20%28Germany%29">German Foreign Office</a> tweeted "Good-bye, David Bowie. You are now among #Heroes. Thank you for helping to bring down the #wall."

On 19 July 1988, 16 months before the Wall came down, <a href="Bruce%20Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a> and the E-Street Band, played Rocking the Wall, a live concert in East-Berlin, which was attended by 300,000 in person and broadcast delayed on television. Springsteen spoke to the crowd in German, saying: "I'm not here for or against any government. I've come to play rock 'n' roll for you in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down". East Germany and its <a href="Free%20German%20Youth">FDJ</a> youth organization were worried they were losing an entire generation. They hoped that by letting Springsteen in, they could improve their sentiment among East Germans. However, this strategy of "one step backwards, two steps forwards" backfired and the concert only made East Germans hungrier for more of the freedoms that Springsteen epitomized. While John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan delivered their famous speeches from the safety of West Berlin, Springsteen's speaking out against the Wall in the middle of East Berlin added to the euphoria.

On 31 December 1989, American TV actor and pop music singer <a href="David%20Hasselhoff">David Hasselhoff</a> was the headlining performer for the Freedom Tour Live concert, which was attended by over 500,000 people on both sides of the Wall. The live concert footage was directed by music video director <a href="Thomas%20Mignone">Thomas Mignone</a> and aired on broadcast television station Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen <a href="ZDF">ZDF</a> throughout Europe. During shooting film crew personnel pulled people up from both sides to stand and celebrate on top of the wall. Hasselhoff sang his Number One hit song "Looking For Freedom" on a platform at the end of a twenty-meter steel crane that swung above and over the Wall adjacent to the <a href="Brandenburg%20Gate">Brandenburg Gate</a>.

On 26 June 1963, 22 months after the erection of the Berlin Wall, <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. President</a> <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> visited West Berlin. Speaking from a platform erected on the steps of <a href="Rathaus%20Sch%C3%B6neberg">Rathaus Schöneberg</a> for an audience of 450,000 he declared in his "<a href="Ich%20bin%20ein%20Berliner">Ich bin ein Berliner</a>" speech the support of the United States for West Germany and the people of West Berlin in particular:

The message was aimed as much at the Soviets as it was at Berliners and was a clear statement of U.S. policy in the wake of the construction of the Berlin Wall. The speech is considered one of Kennedy's best, both a notable moment of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> and a high point of the <a href="New%20Frontier">New Frontier</a>. It was a great morale boost for West Berliners, who lived in an <a href="exclave">exclave</a> deep inside East Germany and feared a possible East German occupation.

In a speech at the Brandenburg Gate commemorating the 750th anniversary of Berlin on 12 June 1987, <a href="U.S.%20President">U.S. President</a> <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> challenged <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, then the <a href="General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>, to tear down the Wall as a symbol of increasing freedom in the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>:
In June 1989 the Hungarian government began <a href="Removal%20of%20Hungary%27s%20border%20fence%20with%20Austria">dismantling the electrified fence along its border with Austria</a> (with Western TV crews present), and then, in September, more than 13,000 East German tourists escaped through Hungary to Austria. This set up a chain of events. The Hungarians prevented many more East Germans from crossing the border and returned them to Budapest. These East Germans flooded the West German embassy and refused to return to East Germany.

The East German government responded by disallowing any further travel to Hungary, but allowed those already there to return to East Germany. This triggered similar events in neighboring Czechoslovakia. This time, however, the East German authorities allowed people to leave, provided that they did so by train through East Germany. This was followed by <a href="Monday%20demonstrations%20in%20East%20Germany">mass demonstrations</a> within East Germany itself. Protest demonstrations spread throughout East Germany in September 1989. Initially, protesters were mostly people wanting to leave to the West, chanting " ("We want out!"). Then protestors began to chant "" ("We are staying here!"). This was the start of what East Germans generally call the "<a href="Peaceful%20revolution%20%28German%29">Peaceful Revolution</a>" of late 1989. The protest demonstrations grew considerably by early November. The movement neared its height on 4 November, when half a million people gathered to demand political change, at the <a href="Alexanderplatz%20demonstration">Alexanderplatz demonstration</a>, East Berlin's large public square and transportation hub.

The longtime leader of East Germany, <a href="Erich%20Honecker">Erich Honecker</a>, resigned on 18 October 1989 and was replaced by <a href="Egon%20Krenz">Egon Krenz</a> that day. Honecker had predicted in January of that year that the Wall would stand for 50 or 100 more years if the conditions that had caused its construction did not change.

The wave of refugees leaving East Germany for the West kept increasing. By early November refugees were finding their way to Hungary via Czechoslovakia, or via the West German Embassy in Prague. This was tolerated by the new Krenz government, because of long-standing agreements with the communist Czechoslovak government, allowing free travel across their common border. However this movement of people grew so large it caused difficulties for both countries. To ease the difficulties, the politburo led by Krenz decided on 9 November to allow refugees to exit directly through crossing points between East Germany and West Germany, including between East and West Berlin. Later the same day, the ministerial administration modified the proposal to include private, round-trip, travel. The new regulations were to take effect the next day.

<a href="G%C3%BCnter%20Schabowski">Günter Schabowski</a>, the party boss in East Berlin and the spokesman for the SED Politburo, had the task of announcing the new regulations. However, he had not been involved in the discussions about the new regulations and had not been fully updated. Shortly before a press conference on 9 November, he was handed a note announcing the changes, but given no further instructions on how to handle the information. These regulations had only been completed a few hours earlier and were to take effect the following day, so as to allow time to inform the border guards. But this starting time delay was not communicated to Schabowski.

At the end of the press conference, Schabowski read out loud the note he had been given. One of the reporters, <a href="Agenzia%20Nazionale%20Stampa%20Associata">ANSA</a>'s <a href="Riccardo%20Ehrman">Riccardo Ehrman</a>, asked when the regulations would take effect. After a few seconds' hesitation, Schabowski assumed it would be the same day based on the wording of the note and replied, "As far as I know, it takes effect immediately, without delay". After further questions from journalists, he confirmed that the regulations included the border crossings through the Wall into West Berlin, which he had not mentioned until then.

Excerpts from Schabowski's press conference were the lead story on West Germany's two main news programs that night—at 7:17 p.m. on <a href="ZDF">ZDF</a>'s "<a href="heute">heute</a>" and at 8 p.m. on <a href="ARD%20%28broadcaster%29">ARD</a>'s "<a href="Tagesschau%20%28Germany%29">Tagesschau</a>". This, of course, meant that the news was broadcast to nearly all of East Germany as well. Later that night, on ARD's "<a href="Tagesthemen">Tagesthemen</a>", anchorman <a href="Hanns%20Joachim%20Friedrichs">Hanns Joachim Friedrichs</a> proclaimed, "This 9 November is a historic day. The GDR has announced that, starting immediately, its borders are open to everyone. The gates in the Wall stand open wide."

After hearing the broadcast, East Germans began gathering at the Wall, at the six checkpoints between East and West Berlin, demanding that border guards immediately open the gates. The surprised and overwhelmed guards made many hectic telephone calls to their superiors about the problem. At first, they were ordered to find the "more aggressive" people gathered at the gates and stamp their passports with a special stamp that barred them from returning to East Germany—in effect, revoking their citizenship. However, this still left thousands of people demanding to be let through "as Schabowski said we can".

It soon became clear that no one among the East German authorities would take personal responsibility for issuing orders to use lethal force, so the vastly outnumbered soldiers had no way to hold back the huge crowd of East German citizens. Finally, at 10:45 p.m., <a href="Harald%20J%C3%A4ger">Harald Jäger</a>, the commander of the <a href="Bornholmer%20Stra%C3%9Fe%20border%20crossing">Bornholmer Straße border crossing</a> yielded, allowing for the guards to open the checkpoints and allowing people through with little or no identity checking. As the "<a href="Ossi%20%28East%20Germans%29">Ossis</a>" swarmed through, they were greeted by "<a href="Wessi">Wessi</a>s" waiting with flowers and champagne amid wild rejoicing. Soon afterward, a crowd of West Berliners jumped on top of the Wall, and were soon joined by East German youngsters. They danced together to celebrate their new freedom.
Another border crossing to the south may have been opened earlier. An account by <a href="Heinz%20Sch%C3%A4fer">Heinz Schäfer</a> indicates that he also acted independently and ordered the opening of the gate at Waltersdorf-Rudow a couple of hours earlier. This may explain reports of East Berliners appearing in West Berlin earlier than the opening of the Bornholmer Straße border crossing.

The fall of the Berlin Wall () began the evening of 9 November 1989 and continued over the following days and weeks, with people nicknamed "" (wall woodpeckers) using various tools to chip off souvenirs, demolishing lengthy parts in the process, and creating several unofficial border crossings.

Television coverage of citizens demolishing sections of the Wall on 9 November was soon followed by the East German regime announcing ten new <a href="Berlin%20Border%20Crossings">border crossings</a>, including the historically significant locations of <a href="Potsdamer%20Platz">Potsdamer Platz</a>, <a href="Glienicker%20Br%C3%BCcke">Glienicker Brücke</a>, and <a href="Bernauer%20Stra%C3%9Fe">Bernauer Straße</a>. Crowds gathered on both sides of the historic crossings waiting for hours to cheer the bulldozers that tore down portions of the Wall to reconnect the divided roads. While the Wall officially remained guarded at a decreasing intensity, new border crossings continued for some time, including the Brandenburg Gate on 22 December 1989. Initially the East German military attempted repairing damage done by the "Wall peckers"; gradually these attempts ceased, and guards became more lax, tolerating the increasing demolitions and "unauthorized" border crossing through the holes.

West Germans and West Berliners were allowed visa-free travel starting 23 December. Until then, they could only visit East Germany and East Berlin under restrictive conditions that involved application for a visa several days or weeks in advance and obligatory exchange of at least 25 <a href="Deutsche%20mark">DM</a> per day of their planned stay, all of which hindered spontaneous visits. Thus, in the weeks between 9 November and 23 December, East Germans could actually travel more freely than Westerners.

On 13 June 1990, the East German military officially began dismantling the Wall, beginning in Bernauer Straße and around the Mitte district. From there, demolition continued through Prenzlauer Berg/Gesundbrunnen, Helligensee and throughout the city of Berlin until that December. Various military units dismantled the Berlin/Brandenberg border wall, completing the job in November 1991. Virtually every road that was severed by the Berlin Wall (that links from West Berlin to East Berlin) was reconstructed and reopened by 1 August 1990.

On 1 July, the day East Germany adopted the West German currency, all "de jure" border controls ceased, although the inter-German border had become meaningless for some time before that.

The fall of the Wall marked the first critical step towards <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a>, which formally concluded a mere 339 days later on 3 October 1990 with the dissolution of East Germany and the official reunification of the German state along the democratic lines of the West German Basic Law.
In some European capitals at the time, there was a deep anxiety over prospects for a reunified Germany. In September 1989, British Prime Minister <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> pleaded with Soviet President <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> not to let the Berlin Wall fall and confided that she wanted the Soviet leader to do what he could to stop it.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, <a href="French%20President">French President</a> <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mitterrand">François Mitterrand</a> warned Thatcher that a unified Germany could make more ground than <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> ever had and that Europe would have to bear the consequences.

On 21 November 1989, <a href="Crosby%2C%20Stills%20%26amp%3B%20Nash">Crosby, Stills & Nash</a> performed the song "Chippin' Away" from <a href="Graham%20Nash">Graham Nash</a>'s 1986 solo album "<a href="Innocent%20Eyes%20%28Graham%20Nash%20album%29">Innocent Eyes</a>" in front of the Brandenburg Gate.

On 25 December 1989, <a href="Leonard%20Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a> gave a concert in Berlin celebrating the end of the Wall, including <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven's</a> <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29">9th symphony</a> ("<a href="Ode%20to%20Joy">Ode to Joy</a>") with the word "Joy" "()" changed to "Freedom" "()" in the lyrics sung. The poet <a href="Schiller">Schiller</a> may have originally written "Freedom" and changed it to "Joy" out of fear. The orchestra and choir were drawn from both East and West Germany, as well as the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States. On New Year's Eve 1989, <a href="David%20Hasselhoff">David Hasselhoff</a> performed his song "<a href="Looking%20for%20Freedom%20%28song%29">Looking for Freedom</a>" while standing atop the partly demolished wall.

<a href="Roger%20Waters">Roger Waters</a> <a href="The%20Wall%20Concert%20in%20Berlin">performed</a> the <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> album "<a href="The%20Wall">The Wall</a>" just north of <a href="Potsdamer%20Platz">Potsdamer Platz</a> on 21 July 1990, with guests including <a href="Bon%20Jovi">Bon Jovi</a>, <a href="Scorpions%20%28band%29">Scorpions</a>, <a href="Bryan%20Adams">Bryan Adams</a>, <a href="Sin%C3%A9ad%20O%27Connor">Sinéad O'Connor</a>, <a href="Cyndi%20Lauper">Cyndi Lauper</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Dolby">Thomas Dolby</a>, <a href="Joni%20Mitchell">Joni Mitchell</a>, <a href="Marianne%20Faithfull">Marianne Faithfull</a>, <a href="Levon%20Helm">Levon Helm</a>, <a href="Rick%20Danko">Rick Danko</a> and <a href="Van%20Morrison">Van Morrison</a>.

Over the years, there has been a repeated controversial debate as to whether <a href="9%20November%20in%20German%20history">9 November</a> would make a suitable German national holiday, often initiated by former members of political opposition in East Germany, such as <a href="Werner%20Schulz">Werner Schulz</a>. Besides being the emotional apogee of East Germany's peaceful revolution, 9 November is also the date of the 1918 abdication of Kaiser <a href="Wilhelm%20II">Wilhelm II</a> and declaration of the <a href="Weimar%20Republic">Weimar Republic</a>, the first German republic. However, 9 November is also the anniversary of the execution of <a href="Robert%20Blum">Robert Blum</a> in following the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848%20in%20the%20Austrian%20Empire">1848 Vienna revolts</a>, the 1923 <a href="Beer%20Hall%20Putsch">Beer Hall Putsch</a> and the infamous "<a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a>" <a href="pogrom">pogrom</a>s of the Nazis in 1938. <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel</a> Laureate <a href="Elie%20Wiesel">Elie Wiesel</a> criticized the first euphoria, noting that "they forgot that 9 November has already entered into history—51 years earlier it marked the Kristallnacht." As reunification was not official and complete until 3 October, that day was finally chosen as <a href="German%20Unity%20Day">German Unity Day</a>.

On 9 November 2009, Berlin celebrated the 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall with a "Festival of Freedom" with dignitaries from around the world in attendance for an evening celebration around the Brandenburg Gate. A high point was when over 1,000 colourfully designed foam domino tiles, each over tall, that were stacked along the former route of the Wall in the city center were toppled in stages, converging in front of the Brandenburg Gate.

A Berlin Twitter Wall was set up to allow Twitter users to post messages commemorating the 20th anniversary. The Chinese government quickly shut down access to the Twitter Wall after masses of Chinese users began using it to protest the <a href="Great%20Firewall%20of%20China">Great Firewall of China</a>.

In the United States, the German Embassy coordinated a public diplomacy campaign with the motto "Freedom Without Walls", to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The campaign was focused on promoting awareness of the fall of the Berlin Wall among current college students. Students at over 30 universities participated in "Freedom Without Walls" events in late 2009. First place winner of the <a href="Freedom%20Without%20Walls%20Speaking%20Contest">Freedom Without Walls Speaking Contest</a> Robert Cannon received a free trip to Berlin for 2010.

An international project called "Mauerreise" (Journey of the Wall) took place in various countries. Twenty symbolic Wall bricks were sent from Berlin starting in May 2009, with the destinations being Korea, Cyprus, Yemen, and other places where everyday life is characterised by division and border experience. In these places, the bricks will become a blank canvas for artists, intellectuals and young people to tackle the "wall" phenomenon.

To commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall, Twinity reconstructed a true-to-scale section of the Wall in virtual Berlin. The <a href="MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Awards">MTV Europe Music Awards</a>, on 5 November, had <a href="U2">U2</a> and <a href="Tokio%20Hotel">Tokio Hotel</a> perform songs dedicated to, and about the Berlin Wall. U2 performed at the Brandenburg Gate, and Tokio Hotel performed "World Behind My Wall".

<a href="Palestinians">Palestinians</a> in the town of <a href="Kalandia">Kalandia</a>, <a href="West%20Bank">West Bank</a> pulled down parts of the <a href="Israeli%20West%20Bank%20barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a>, in a demonstration marking the 20th Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall.

The <a href="International%20Spy%20Museum">International Spy Museum</a> in Washington DC hosted a <a href="Trabant">Trabant</a> car rally where 20 Trabants gathered in recognition of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Rides were raffled every half-hour and a Trabant crashed through a Berlin Wall mock up. The Trabant was the East German people's car that many used to leave DDR after the collapse.

The <a href="Allied%20Museum">Allied Museum</a> in the <a href="Dahlem%20%28Berlin%29">Dahlem</a> district of Berlin hosted a number of events to mark the Twentieth Anniversary of the Fall of the Berlin Wall. The museum held a Special Exhibition entitled "Wall Patrol – The Western Powers and the Berlin Wall 1961–1990" which focused on the daily patrols deployed by the Western powers to observe the situation along the Berlin Wall and the fortifications on the <a href="East%20Germany">GDR</a> <a href="Inner%20German%20border">border</a>. A sheet of "Americans in Berlin" Commemorative <a href="Cinderella%20stamp">Cinderella stamp</a>s designed by T.H.E. Hill, the author of , was presented to the Museum by David Guerra, Berlin veteran and webmaster of the site <a href="Berlin%20Brigade">www.berlinbrigade.com</a>. The stamps splendidly illustrate that even twenty years on, veterans of service in Berlin still regard their service there as one of the high points of their lives.

Little is left of the Wall at its original site, which was destroyed almost in its entirety. Three long sections are still standing: an piece of the first (westernmost) wall at the <a href="Topography%20of%20Terror">Topography of Terror</a>, site of the former <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a> headquarters, halfway between Checkpoint Charlie and <a href="Potsdamer%20Platz">Potsdamer Platz</a>; a longer section of the second (easternmost) wall along the <a href="Spree">Spree</a> River near the <a href="Oberbaumbr%C3%BCcke">Oberbaumbrücke</a>, nicknamed <a href="East%20Side%20Gallery">East Side Gallery</a>; and a third section that is partly reconstructed, in the north at Bernauer Straße, which was turned into a memorial in 1999. Other isolated fragments, lampposts, other elements, and a few watchtowers also remain in various parts of the city.


Nothing still accurately represents the Wall's original appearance better than a very short stretch at Bernauer Straße associated with the Berlin Wall Documentation Center. Other remnants are badly damaged by souvenir seekers. Fragments of the Wall were taken and some were sold around the world. Appearing both with and without <a href="Certificate%20of%20Authenticity">certificates of authenticity</a>, these fragments are now a staple on the online auction service <a href="eBay">eBay</a> as well as German souvenir shops. Today, the eastern side is covered in <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a> that did not exist while the Wall was guarded by the armed soldiers of East Germany. Previously, graffiti appeared only on the western side. Along some tourist areas of the city centre, the city government has marked the location of the former Wall by a row of cobblestones in the street. In most places only the "first" wall is marked, except near Potsdamer Platz where the stretch of both walls is marked, giving visitors an impression of the dimension of the barrier system.

After the fall of Berlin Wall, there were initiatives that they want to preserve the death strip walkways and redevelop it into a hiking and cycling area, known as Berliner Mauerweg. It is part of the initiative by Berlin Senate since 2005.

For many years after reunification, people in Germany talked about cultural differences between East and West Germans (colloquially "<a href="Ossi%20%28East%20Germans%29">Ossis</a>" and "<a href="Wessi">Wessi</a>s"), sometimes described as "Mauer im Kopf" (The wall in the head). A September 2004 poll found that 25 percent of West Germans and 12 percent of East Germans wished that East and West should be separated again by a "Wall". A poll taken in October 2009 on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Wall indicated, however, that only about a tenth of the population was still unhappy with the unification (8 percent in the East; 12 percent in the West). Although differences are still perceived between East and West, Germans make similar distinctions between <a href="Northern%20Germany">North</a> and <a href="Southern%20Germany">South</a>.

A 2011 poll conducted by Russia's VTsIOM, found that more than half of all Russians do not know who built the Berlin Wall. Ten percent of people surveyed thought Berlin residents built it themselves. Six percent said Western powers built it and four percent thought it was a "bilateral initiative" of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and the West. Fifty-eight percent said they did not know who built it, with just 24 percent correctly naming the Soviet Union and its then-communist ally East Germany.

Not all segments of the Wall were ground up as the Wall was being torn down. Many segments have been given to various institutions around the world. They can be found, for instance, in presidential and historical museums, lobbies of hotels and corporations, at universities and government buildings, and in public spaces around the world.
On 13 August 2011, Germany marked the 50th anniversary of East Germany beginning the erection of the Berlin Wall. Chancellor <a href="Angela%20Merkel">Angela Merkel</a> joined with President <a href="Christian%20Wulff">Christian Wulff</a> and Berlin Mayor <a href="Klaus%20Wowereit">Klaus Wowereit</a> at the Bernauer Straße memorial park to remember lives and liberty. Speeches extolled freedom and a minute of silence at noon honored those who died trying to flee to the West. "It is our shared responsibility to keep the memory alive and to pass it on to the coming generations as a reminder to stand up for freedom and democracy to ensure that such injustice may never happen again," entreated Mayor Wowereit. "It has been shown once again: Freedom is invincible at the end. No wall can permanently withstand the desire for freedom", proclaimed President Wulff."

Bass music

Bass music (also called UK bass or post-dubstep) is an <a href="umbrella%20term">umbrella term</a> for <a href="electronic%20dance%20music">electronic dance music</a> that emerged in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> during the mid-2000s under the influence of <a href="dubstep">dubstep</a>, <a href="UK%20garage">UK garage</a>, <a href="purple%20sound">wonky</a>, <a href="contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a>, <a href="2-step%20garage">2-step</a>, <a href="house%20music">house</a>, <a href="Grime%20%28music%20genre%29">grime</a>, and other electronic styles that coalesced amongst varied artists. The phrase "bass music" came into use as artists began ambiguously blending the sounds of these defined genres while maintaining an emphasis on <a href="bass%20%28music%29">bass</a> and <a href="rhythm">rhythm</a>.

The breadth of styles that have come to be associated with the term preclude it from being a specific musical genre. "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" writer Martin Clark has suggested that "well-meaning attempts to loosely define the ground we're covering here are somewhat futile and almost certainly flawed. This is not one genre. However, given the links, interaction, and free-flowing ideas ... you can't dismiss all these acts as unrelated." <a href="Dubstep">Dubstep</a> producer <a href="Skream">Skream</a> is quoted in an interview with "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" in September 2011 as saying: The word dubstep is being used by a lot of people and there were a lot of people being tagged with the dubstep brush. They don't want to be tagged with it and shouldn't be tagged with it – that's not what they're pushing... When I say 'UK bass', it's what everyone UK is associated with so it would be a lot easier if it was called that."

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, bass music, or UK bass has had major mainstream success since the late 2000s and early 2010s, with artists such as <a href="James%20Blake%20%28musician%29">James Blake</a>, <a href="Example%20%28musician%29">Example</a>, <a href="Burial%20%28musician%29">Burial</a>, <a href="Zomby">Zomby</a>, <a href="Chase%20%26amp%3B%20Status">Chase & Status</a>, <a href="Skream">Skream</a>, <a href="TNGHT">TNGHT</a>, <a href="Benga%20%28musician%29">Benga</a> and <a href="Wretch%2032">Wretch 32</a>. The term "post-dubstep" has been used synonymously to refer to artists, such as Blake, <a href="Mount%20Kimbie">Mount Kimbie</a> and Fantastic Mr. Fox whose work drew on UK garage, 2-step, and other forms of underground dance music, as well as <a href="ambient%20music">ambient music</a> and early <a href="Contemporary%20R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a>. Outside of nightclubs, bass music has mainly been promoted and played on <a href="internet%20radio">internet radio</a> stations such as <a href="Sub.FM">Sub.FM</a> and <a href="Rinse%20FM">Rinse FM</a>.

Burning glass

A burning glass or burning lens is a large <a href="Biconcave%20lens">convex lens</a> that can concentrate the <a href="sun">sun</a>'s rays onto a small area, heating up the area and thus resulting in <a href="Combustion">ignition</a> of the exposed surface. Burning mirrors achieve a similar effect by using reflecting surfaces to focus the light. They were used in 18th-century chemical studies for burning materials in closed glass vessels where the products of <a href="combustion">combustion</a> could be trapped for analysis. The burning glass was a useful contrivance in the days before electrical ignition was easily achieved.

The technology of the burning glass has been known since antiquity. Vases filled with water used to start fires were known in the ancient world. Burning lenses were used to <a href="cauterise">cauterise</a> wounds and to light sacred fires in temples. "<a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>" refers to a burning mirror made of joined triangular metal mirrors installed at the temple of the <a href="Vestal%20Virgins">Vestal Virgins</a>. <a href="Aristophanes">Aristophanes</a> mentions the burning lens in his play "<a href="The%20Clouds">The Clouds</a>" (424 BC).

<a href="Archimedes">Archimedes</a>, the renowned mathematician, was said to have used a burning glass as a weapon in 212 BC, when <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a> was besieged by <a href="Marcus%20Claudius%20Marcellus">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a>. The <a href="Roman%20Navy">Roman fleet</a> was supposedly incinerated, though eventually the city was taken and Archimedes was slain.

The legend of Archimedes gave rise to a considerable amount of research on burning glasses and lenses until the late 17th century. Various researchers worked with burning glasses, including <a href="Anthemius%20of%20Tralles">Anthemius of Tralles</a> (6th century AD), Proclus (6th century) (who by this means purportedly destroyed the fleet of <a href="Vitalian%20%28general%29">Vitalian</a> besieging <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>), <a href="Ibn%20Sahl">Ibn Sahl</a> in his "On Burning Mirrors and Lenses" (10th century), <a href="Ibn%20al-Haytham">Alhazen</a> in his "<a href="Book%20of%20Optics">Book of Optics</a>" (1021), <a href="Roger%20Bacon">Roger Bacon</a> (13th century), <a href="Giambattista%20della%20Porta">Giambattista della Porta</a> and his friends (16th century), <a href="Athanasius%20Kircher">Athanasius Kircher</a> and <a href="Gaspar%20Schott">Gaspar Schott</a> (17th century), and the <a href="Georges-Louis%20Leclerc%2C%20Comte%20de%20Buffon">Comte de Buffon</a> in 1740 in Paris.

The pop science TV program "<a href="MythBusters">MythBusters</a>" attempted to model Archimedes' feat by using mirrors to ignite a small wooden boat covered with tar, with little success—they found it too difficult to focus light from their hand-held mirrors onto a point small enough to ignite the boat. However, an episode of <a href="Richard%20Hammond%27s%20Engineering%20Connections">Richard Hammond's Engineering Connections</a> relating to the <a href="Keck%20Observatory">Keck Observatory</a> (whose reflector glass is based on the Archimedes' Mirror) did successfully use a much smaller curved mirror to burn a wooden model, though not made of the same quality of materials as in the "MythBusters" effort.

Burning lenses were used both by <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a> and <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a> in their experiments to obtain oxides contained in closed vessels under high temperatures. These included carbon dioxide by burning diamond, and <a href="Mercury%28II%29%20oxide">mercuric oxide</a> by heating <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>. This type of experiment contributed to the discovery of <a href="Phlogiston%20theory">"dephlogisticated air"</a> by Priestley, which became better known as oxygen, following Lavoisier's investigations.

In 1796, during the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> and three years after the declaration of war between France and Great Britain, <a href="%C3%89tienne-Gaspard%20Robert">Étienne-Gaspard Robert</a> met with the French government and proposed the use of mirrors to burn the invading ships of the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. They decided not to take up his proposal.

Chapter 17 of <a href="William%20Bates%20%28physician%29">William Bates</a>' 1920 book "Perfect Sight Without Glasses", in which the author argues that observation of the sun is beneficial to those with poor vision, includes a figure of somebody ""Focussing the Rays of the Sun Upon the Eye of a Patient by Means of a Burning Glass.""

Burning glasses (often called fire lenses) are still used to light fires in outdoor and primitive settings. Large burning lenses sometimes take the form of <a href="Fresnel%20lens">Fresnel lens</a>es, similar to <a href="lighthouse">lighthouse</a> lenses, including those for use in <a href="solar%20furnace">solar furnace</a>s. Solar furnaces are used in industry to produce extremely high temperatures without the need for fuel or large supplies of electricity. They sometimes employ a large <a href="Parabolic%20reflector">parabolic</a> array of mirrors (some facilities are several storeys high) to focus light to a high intensity.

The <a href="Olympic%20torch">Olympic torch</a> that is carried around the host country of the <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a> is lit by a burning glass, at the site of ancient <a href="Olympia%2C%20Greece">Olympia</a> in <a href="Greece">Greece</a>.

Beacon

A beacon is an intentionally conspicuous device designed to attract attention to a <a href="Geodetic%20datum">specific location</a>.

Beacons can also be combined with semaphoric or other indicators to provide important <a href="information">information</a>, such as the status of an airport, by the colour and rotational pattern of its <a href="aerodrome%20beacon">airport beacon</a>, or of pending weather as indicated on a <a href="weather%20beacon">weather beacon</a> mounted at the top of a tall building or similar site. When used in such fashion, beacons can be considered a form of <a href="Telegraph%23Optical%20telegraph">optical telegraphy</a>.

Beacons help guide <a href="navigation">navigators</a> to their destinations. Types of navigational beacons include <a href="radar">radar</a> reflectors, <a href="radio%20beacons">radio beacons</a>, sonic and visual signals. Visual beacons range from small, single-pile structures to large <a href="lighthouse">lighthouse</a>s or light stations and can be located on land or on water. Lighted beacons are called "lights"; unlighted beacons are called "<a href="Day%20beacon">daybeacon</a>"s.

Classically, beacons were fires lit at well-known locations on hills or high places, used either as <a href="lighthouse">lighthouse</a>s for <a href="navigational%20aid">navigation at sea</a>, or for signalling over land that enemy troops were approaching, in order to alert defenses. As signals, beacons are an ancient form of <a href="optical%20telegraph">optical telegraph</a> and were part of a <a href="relay%20league">relay league</a>.

Systems of this kind have existed for centuries over much of the world. The ancient Romans used beacons and beacons figure on several occasions on the <a href="column%20of%20Trajan">column of Trajan</a>.

In the 10th century, during the <a href="Arab%E2%80%93Byzantine%20wars">Arab–Byzantine wars</a>, the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine Empire</a> used a <a href="Byzantine%20beacon%20system">beacon system</a> to transmit messages from the border with the <a href="Abbasid%20Caliphate">Abbasid Caliphate</a>, across <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> to the <a href="Great%20Palace%20of%20Constantinople">imperial palace</a> in the Byzantine capital, <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. It was devised by <a href="Leo%20the%20Mathematician">Leo the Mathematician</a> for Emperor <a href="Theophilos%20%28emperor%29">Theophilos</a>, but either abolished or radically curtailed by Theophilos' son and successor, <a href="Michael%20III">Michael III</a>. Beacons were later used in Greece as well, while the surviving parts of the beacon system in Anatolia seem to have been reactivated in the 12th century by Emperor <a href="Manuel%20I%20Komnenos">Manuel I Komnenos</a>.

In Scandinavia many <a href="hill%20fort">hill fort</a>s were part of beacon networks to warn against invading pillagers. In Finland, these beacons were called "vainovalkeat", "persecution fires", or "vartiotulet", "guard fires", and were used to warn Finn settlements of imminent raids by the Vikings.

In <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, the <a href="Brecon%20Beacons">Brecon Beacons</a> were named for beacons used to warn of approaching English raiders. In England, the most famous examples are the beacons used in <a href="Elizabethan%20England">Elizabethan England</a> to warn of the approaching <a href="Spanish%20Armada">Spanish Armada</a>. Many hills in England were named Beacon Hill after such beacons. In the <a href="Scottish%20border">Scottish border</a>s country, a system of beacon fires was at one time established to warn of incursions by the English. <a href="Hume%20Castle">Hume</a> and Eggerstone castles and Soltra Edge were part of this network. The <a href="Great%20Wall%20of%20China">Great Wall of China</a> is also a beacon network.

In Spain, the border of <a href="Granada">Granada</a> in the territory of the <a href="Crown%20of%20Castile">Crown of Castile</a> had a complex beacon network to warn against Moorish raiders and military campaigns.

Vehicular beacons are rotating or flashing lights affixed to the top of a vehicle to attract the attention of surrounding vehicles and pedestrians. <a href="Emergency%20vehicle">Emergency vehicle</a>s such as fire engines, ambulances, police cars, tow trucks, construction vehicles, and snow-removal vehicles carry beacon lights.

The color of the lamps varies by jurisdiction; typical colors are blue and/or red for police, fire, and medical-emergency vehicles; amber for hazards (slow-moving vehicles, wide loads, tow trucks, security personnel, construction vehicles, etc.); green for volunteer firefighters or for medical personnel, and violet for funerary vehicles. Beacons may be constructed with <a href="Automotive%20lamp%20types">halogen bulbs</a> similar to those used in vehicle <a href="headlamp">headlamp</a>s, xenon <a href="flashtube">flashtube</a>s, or <a href="Light%20emitting%20diode">LEDs</a>. Incandescent and xenon light sources require the vehicle’s engine to continue running to ensure that the battery is not depleted when the lights are used for a prolonged period. The low power consumption of LEDs allows the vehicle's engine to remain turned off while the lights operate nodes.

Beacons and <a href="bonfire">bonfire</a>s are also used to mark occasions and celebrate events.

Beacons have also allegedly been abused by <a href="Wrecking%20%28shipwreck%29">shipwreckers</a>. An illicit fire at a wrong position would be used to direct a ship against <a href="shoal">shoal</a>s or <a href="beach">beach</a>es, so that its cargo could be looted after the ship sank or ran aground. There are, however, no historically substantiated occurrences of such intentional shipwrecking.

In wireless networks, a <a href="Electric%20beacon%23IEEE%20802.11%20Wi-Fi%20beacons">beacon</a> is a type of <a href="Frame%20%28networking%29">frame</a> which is sent by the access point (or WiFi router) to indicate that it is on.

Bluetooth based beacons periodically send out a data packet and this could be used by software to identify the beacon location. This is typically used by indoor navigation and positioning applications.

"Beaconing" is the process that allows a network to self-repair network problems. The stations on the network notify the other stations on the ring when they are not receiving the transmissions. Beaconing is used in Token ring and FDDI networks.

In <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>' tragedy "<a href="Oresteia">Agamemnon</a>", a chain of eight beacons manned by so-called "lampadóphoroi" inform <a href="Clytemnestra">Clytemnestra</a> in <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, within a single night's time, that <a href="Troy">Troy</a> has just fallen under her husband king Agamemnon's control, after a famous <a href="Trojan%20War">ten years siege</a>.

In <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s <a href="high%20fantasy">high fantasy</a> novel, "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>", a <a href="Warning%20beacons%20of%20Gondor">series of beacons</a> alerts the entire realm of <a href="Gondor">Gondor</a> when the kingdom is under attack. These beacon posts were manned by messengers who would carry word of their lighting to either <a href="Rohan%20%28Middle-earth%29">Rohan</a> or <a href="Belfalas">Belfalas</a>. In <a href="Peter%20Jackson">Peter Jackson</a>'s , the beacons serve as a connection between the two realms of Rohan and Gondor, alerting one another directly when they require military aid, as opposed to relying on messengers as in the novel.
Beacons are sometimes used in retail to send digital coupons or invites to customers passing by.

Bhangra (music)

Bhaṅgṛā (, ਭੰਗੜਾ ; ) is a type of upbeat <a href="popular%20music">popular music</a> associated with immigrant Punjabi youth. It was invented in England starting in the 1970s by people from the <a href="Punjab%20region">Punjab region</a> of <a href="India">India</a> and <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>.

The roots of modern bhangra music date back to the early 1980s, when several Punjabi bands started experimenting with Western styles as well as traditional Punjabi music. Significant amongst these were 'The Black Mist', 'The Shots', 'The Jambo Boys', and 'The Saathies'. However, the first recording artist/group of this type of music in the UK was <a href="Bhujhangy%20Group">Bhujhangy Group</a>, founded by brothers Balbir Singh Khanpur and Dalbir Singh Khanpur in Birmingham in 1967. Bhujhangy Group's first major hit was "Bhabiye Akh Larr Gayee" in the early 1970s, released on Birmingham's <a href="Oriental%20Star%20Agencies">Oriental Star Agencies</a> label. This was the first song to combine traditional Asian music with modern western instruments, which would be followed by further developments of this in bhangra.

Bhangra music was said to rise in Britain in the 1970s by Punjabi immigrants who took their native folk music and began experimenting by altering it using instruments from their host country. The new genre quickly became popular in Britain replacing Punjabi folk singers due to it being heavily influenced in Britain by the infusion of rock music and a need to move away from the simple and repetitive Punjabi folk music. It indicated the development of a self-conscious and distinctively rebellious <a href="British%20Asian">British Asian</a> <a href="youth%20culture">youth culture</a> centred on an experiential sense of self, e.g., language, gesture, bodily signification, desires, etc., in a situation in which tensions with British culture and <a href="racism">racist</a> elements in British society had resulted in <a href="Social%20alienation">alienation</a> in many <a href="Minority%20group">minority ethnic groups</a>, fostered a sense of need for an affirmation of a positive identity and culture, and provided a platform for British Punjabi males to assert their masculinity.

In the 1980s, distributed by record labels such as <a href="Multitone%20Records">Multitone Records</a>, Bhangra artists were selling over 30,000 cassettes a week in the UK, but no artists reached the Top 40 UK Chart despite these artists outselling popular British ones; most of the Bhangra cassette sales were not through the large UK record stores, whose sales were those recorded by the Official UK Charts Company for creating their rankings.

The group Alaap formed in 1977 co-founded by <a href="Channi%20Singh">Channi Singh</a> and Harjeet Gandhi both hail from <a href="Southall">Southall</a>, a Punjabi area in London. Their album "Teri Chunni De Sitaray" was released in 1982 by Multitone. Alaap was considered the first and original superstar Bhangra band formed in the United Kingdom. <a href="Channi%20Singh">Channi Singh</a> has been awarded the OBE by the British Queen for his services to Bhangra music and services/ charity for the British Asian community. Co-founder Harjeet Gandhi died in 2003.

The 1980s is commonly known as the golden age, or the age of Bhangra music, which lasted roughly from 1985 to 1993. The primary emphasis during these times was on the melody/riff, played out usually on a synthesizer, harmonium, accordion or a guitar. The folk instruments were rarely used.

One of the biggest Bhangra stars of the last several decades is <a href="Malkit%20Singh">Malkit Singh</a> and his band Golden Star. Singh was born in June 1963 in the village of <a href="Hussainpur">Hussainpur</a> in Punjab. He attended the <a href="Lyallpur%20Khalsa%20College">Lyallpur Khalsa College</a>, <a href="Jalandhar">Jalandhar</a>, in Punjab in 1980 to study for a bachelor of arts degree. There he met his mentor, Professor Inderjit Singh, who taught him Punjabi folk singing and Bhangra dancing. Due to Singh's tutelage, Malkit entered and won song contests during this time. In 1983, he won a gold medal at the <a href="Guru%20Nanak%20Dev%20University">Guru Nanak Dev University</a> in <a href="Amritsar">Amritsar</a>, Punjab, for performing his song "Gurh Nalon Ishq Mitha", which later featured on his first album, "Nach Gidhe Wich", released in 1984. This album was created with the assistance of Bhangra musician, Tarlochan Singh Bilga. The band has toured 27 countries. Malkit has been awarded the MBE by the British Queen for his services to Bhangra music.

Bhangra boy band, the <a href="Sahotas">Sahotas</a>, composed of five brothers from <a href="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a>. Their music is a fusion of Bhangra, rock and dance.

<a href="Heera%20Group%20UK">Heera</a>, formed by Bhupinder Bhindi and fronted by Kumar and Dhami, was one of the most popular bands of the 1980s . The group established itself with the albums "Jag Wala Mela", produced by <a href="Kuljit%20Bhamra">Kuljit Bhamra</a>, and "Diamonds from Heera", produced by Deepak Khazanchi, on Arishma records. These albums are notable for being amongst the first Bhangra albums to mix Punjabi drums and Punjabi synthesizers with traditional British instruments successfully.

Bands like Alaap and Heera incorporated rock-influenced beats into Bhangra, because it enabled "Asian youth to affirm their identities positively" within the broader environment of alternative rock as an alternative way of expression. However, some believe that the progression of Bhangra music created an "intermezzo culture" post-India's partition, within the unitary definitions of Southeast Asians within the diaspora, thus "establishing a brand new community in their home away from home".

Several other influential groups appeared around the same time, including The Saathies, Premi Group, Bhujungy Group, and Apna Sangeet. Apna Sangeet, best known for their hit "Mera Yaar Vajavey Dhol", re-formed for charity in May 2009 after a break-up.

When Bhangra and General Indian sounds and lyrics were combined, British-Asian artists began incorporating them in their music. Some Asian artists, such as <a href="Bally%20Sagoo">Bally Sagoo</a>, <a href="Talvin%20Singh">Talvin Singh</a>, Badmarsh, Black Star Liner are creating their own form of British <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">hip-hop</a>.

This era also brought about Bhangra art, which, like the Bhangra music it represented was rebellious. Unlike folk music art, which consisted of a picture of the folk singer, Bhangra recordings had details such as distinctive artwork, logos, clever album names and band/musician listings (who played what).

In the mid 1990s, however, many artists returned to the original, traditional folk beats away from Bhangra music, often incorporating more dhol drum beats and tumbi. This time also saw the rise of several young Punjabi folk singers as a backlash to Bhangra music. They were aided by DJs who mixed hip hop samples with folk singing.

Beginning around 1994, there was a trend towards the use of samples (often sampled from mainstream hip hop) mixed with traditional folk rhythm instruments, such as the tumbi and dhol. Using folk instruments and hip-hop samples, along with relatively inexpensive folk vocals imported from Punjab, Punjabi folk music was able to cause the decline of Bhangra music.

Pioneering DJs instrumental in the decline of Bhangra were <a href="Bally%20Sagoo">Bally Sagoo</a> and <a href="Panjabi%20MC">Panjabi MC</a>. As DJs who were initially hired by Bhangra labels to remix the original recordings on the label's roster (OSA and Nachural respectively), they along with the record labels quickly found that remixing folk singers from India was much cheaper than working with outsourced Bhangra bands.

A pioneering folk singer that was instrumental in Bhangra's demise was <a href="Jazzy%20B">Jazzy B</a>, who debuted in 1992. Having sold over 55,000 copies of his third album, "Folk and Funky", he is now one of the best-selling Punjabi folk artists in the world, with a vocal style likened to that of <a href="Kuldip%20Manak">Kuldip Manak</a>.

Other influential folk artists include <a href="Surinder%20Shinda">Surinder Shinda</a> - famous for his "Putt Jattan De" - <a href="Harbhajan%20Mann">Harbhajan Mann</a>, <a href="Manmohan%20Waris">Manmohan Waris</a>, Meshi Eshara, <a href="Sarbjit%20Cheema">Sarbjit Cheema</a>, <a href="Hans%20Raj%20Hans">Hans Raj Hans</a>, <a href="Sardool%20Sikander">Sardool Sikander</a>, Anakhi, Sat Rang, XLNC, <a href="B21%20%28band%29">B21</a>, Shaktee, Sahara, <a href="Paaras">Paaras</a>, PDM, Amar Group, Sangeet Group, and <a href="Bombay%20Talkie%20%28band%29">Bombay Talkie</a>. Late Alam Lohar contributions of notably Jugni and Mirza Sahiban. A DJ to rise to stardom with many successful hits was Panjabi MC.

By the end of the 1990s, Bhangra music had largely declined and been replaced with Punjabi folk singers. The same folk singers which Bhangra bands had replaced a decade earlier were being utilized by DJs to make relatively inexpensive non live music on laptops. This "<a href="Folkhop">Folkhop</a>" genre was short lived as records could not be officially released due to non clearance copyrights on samples used to create the "beat". This continued until the end of the century. Folkhop record labels such Hi Tech were investigated by BPI (British Phonographic Industry) for copyright infringement by way of uncleared samples on releases by Folk DJs such as DJ Sanj.

Toward the end of the decade, Bhangra continued to decline, with folkhop artists such as Bally Sagoo and Apache Indian signing with international recording labels Sony and Island. Moreover, Multitone Records, one of the major recording labels associated with Bhangra in Britain in the 1980s and 1990s, was bought by BMG. A recent <a href="Pepsi">Pepsi</a> commercial launched in Britain featured South Asian actors and Punjabi folk music.

Punjabi folk remixed with hip hop, known as <a href="Folkhop">Folkhop</a>, is most often produced when folk vocals are purchased online to be remixed in a studio. Folk vocals are usually sung to traditional melodies, that are often repeated with new lyrics.

Some South Asian DJs, especially in America, have mixed Punjabi folk music with house, <a href="reggae">reggae</a>, and <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">hip-hop</a> to add a different flavor to Punjabi folk. These remixes continued to gain popularity as the 1990s came to an end. This movement was established and proliferated by DJs such as Punjabi MC and DJ Rekha. DJ Rekha, originally from the UK, now resides in New York City running a club event series called Basement Bhangra. These monthly events exhibit house and hip hop bhangra remixes.

A notable remix artist is <a href="Bally%20Sagoo">Bally Sagoo</a>, a Punjabi-Sikh, Anglo-Indian raised in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, England. Sagoo described his music as "a bit of tablas, a bit of the Indian sound. But bring on the bass lines, bring on the funky-drummer beat, bring on the <a href="James%20Brown">James Brown</a> samples", to "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine in 1997. He was recently signed by <a href="Sony">Sony</a>. <a href="Daler%20Mehndi">Daler Mehndi</a>, a Punjabi singer from India has a type of music known as "folk pop". Mehndi has released tracks such as "Bolo Ta Ra Ra" and "Ho Jayegee Balle Balle". His song "<a href="Tunak%20Tunak%20Tun">Tunak Tunak Tun</a>" was released in 1998.

Punjabi immigrants have encouraged the growth of Punjabi folk music in the Western Hemisphere rather than Bhangra music. The Bhangra industry has grown in North America much less than in the United Kingdom. Indian Lion, a Canadian folk artist explains what he thinks has caused this:

North American (non Bhangra) folk artists such as <a href="Manmohan%20Waris">Manmohan Waris</a>, Jazzy Bains, <a href="Kamal%20Heer">Kamal Heer</a>, Harbhajan Mann, Sarabjit Cheema, and Debi Makhsoospuri have emerged and the <a href="remix">remix</a> market has grown.

In 2001, Punjabi folk, and its hip-hop form, <a href="Folkhop">Folkhop</a>, began to exert an influence over US <a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> music, when <a href="Missy%20Elliott">Missy Elliott</a> released the folkhop-influenced song "<a href="Get%20Ur%20Freak%20On">Get Ur Freak On</a>". In 2003, <a href="Punjabi%20MC">Punjabi MC</a>'s "<a href="Mundian%20To%20Bach%20Ke">Mundian To Bach Ke</a>" ("Beware of the Boys") was covered by the U.S. rapper <a href="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a>. Additionally, American rapper <a href="Pras">Pras</a> of <a href="The%20Fugees">The Fugees</a> has recorded tracks with British alternative Bhangra band <a href="Swami%20%28band%29">Swami</a>. American singer and actress <a href="Selena%20Gomez">Selena Gomez</a> released her bhangra single <a href="Come%20%26amp%3B%20Get%20It%20%28Selena%20Gomez%20song%29">Come & Get It</a> from her first solo album "<a href="Stars%20Dance">Stars Dance</a>" in 2013. Australian singer and songwriter <a href="Sia%20Furler">Sia</a> released her bhangra single <a href="Cheap%20Thrills%20%28song%29">Cheap Thrills</a> from her seventh studio album <a href="This%20Is%20Acting">This Is Acting</a> in 2016.

Bhangra lyrics, which generally cover social issues or love, are sung in <a href="Punjabi%20language">Punjabi</a>. Bhangra lyrics were generally kept deliberately simple by the creators of the genre because the youth did not understand complex lyrics. Traditional Punjabi folk lyrics are generally more complex and often tell the tales of Punjabi history. There are many Bhangra songs devoted to Punjabi pride themes and Punjabi heroes. The lyrics are tributes to the cultural traditions of Punjab. In particular, many Bhangra tracks have been written about <a href="Udham%20Singh">Udham Singh</a> and <a href="Bhagat%20Singh">Bhagat Singh</a>. Less serious topics include beautiful women with their colourful <a href="Dupatta">duppattas</a>. Lyrics can also be about crops and the coming of a new season. Bhangra is sung fiercely with strong lyrics often yelling: "balle balle" or "chakde phate", which refer to celebration and/or pride.

Notable Bhangra or Punjabi lyricists include <a href="Harbans%20Jandu">Harbans Jandu</a> (Jandu Littranwala) ("Giddhian Di Rani") and Rattan Reehal (Rurki wala rattan).

Punjabi instruments contribute to Bhangra. Originally this was primarily the <a href="dhol">dhol</a>. The 20th century has brought changes to the instruments that define Bhangra, to include the <a href="tumbi">tumbi</a>, <a href="sarangi">sarangi</a>, <a href="dholak">dholak</a> (smaller than the dhol), flute, zither, fiddle, <a href="Pump%20organ">harmonium</a>, <a href="tabla">tabla</a>, guitar, <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a>, saxophone, synthesizer, drum set, and other Western instruments.

The string instruments include the <a href="guitar">guitar</a> (both acoustic and electrical), <a href="Bass%20guitar">bass</a>, <a href="oud">oud</a>, <a href="sitar">sitar</a>, <a href="tumbi">tumbi</a>, <a href="violin">violin</a> and <a href="sarangi">sarangi</a>. The <a href="Snare%20drum">snare</a>, <a href="Tom-tom%20drum">toms</a>, <a href="dhadd">dhadd</a>, dafli, <a href="dholki">dholki</a>, and <a href="damru">damru</a> are the other drums. The tumbi, originally played by folk artists such as <a href="Lal%20Chand%20Yamla%20Jatt">Lalchand Yamla Jatt</a> and <a href="Kuldeep%20Manak">Kuldip Manak</a> in true folk recordings and then notably used by <a href="Chamkila">Chamkila</a>, a Punjabi folk (not Bhangra) singer, is a high-tone, single-string instrument and Chimta by (Late) Alam Lohar.

Bhangra today has developed into a largely beat-based music genre, unlike before 1994, when it was slightly more mellow and classical. <a href="Pandit%20Dinesh">Pandit Dinesh</a> and <a href="Kuljit%20Bhamra">Kuljit Bhamra</a> were trained exponents of Indian percussion and helped create the current British music, mainly with tabla and dholki for bands like Alaap and <a href="Heera%20Group%20UK">Heera</a>.

15-year-old percussionist Bhupinder Singh Kullar, a.k.a. <a href="Tubsy">Tubsy</a>, of <a href="Handsworth%2C%20West%20Midlands">Handsworth</a>, Birmingham, created a more contemporary style and groove that seemed to fuse more naturally with Western music. Songs such as "Dhola veh Dhola" (Satrang) and albums such as "Bomb the Tumbi" (Safri Boyz) contained this new style.

<a href="Sunil%20Kalyan">Sunil Kalyan</a> of <a href="Southall">Southall</a>, London, was a session musician on many songs and albums, playing the tabla.

<a href="Sukhshinder%20Shinda">Sukhshinder Shinda</a> later introduced his style of dhol playing with the album "Dhol Beat". He added a very clean style of dhol playing and helped create the sound for artists such as Jaswinder Singh Bains and <a href="Bhinda%20Jatt">Bhinda Jatt</a>.

Another notable percussionist was <a href="%3AParvinder%20Bharat">:Parvinder Bharat</a> <a href="%3A%28Parv%29">:(Parv)</a> of <a href="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a>. Parv had played for many bhangra bands from the 80's, playing with bands such as, Satrang, Pardesi and then eventually joining the internationally acclaimed DCS. After leaving DCS, Parv continued to experiment with his art which resulted in a European tour with none other than the legend that is Stevie Wonder.

The third and fourth generation are generally unable to speak Punjabi if their parents could hardly speak it. There is a move towards <a href="Folk%20music%20of%20Punjab">Punjabi folk music</a> which is the purest form of Punjabi music. Much of the youth struggle to understand the lyrics, although, there are some children and young adults who have maintained their folk roots. Another reason why some fans express an anti-folk sentiment is because many folk songs were written about <a href="Sikh">Sikh</a> <a href="Jat%20people">Jatts</a> whereas other <a href="Punjabis">Punjabi</a> Sikhs were not Jatt, so they disapproved of <a href="Folk%20music%20of%20Punjab">Punjabi folk music</a>. However, today with artists like Tru-Skool, Jazzy B, PMC, Sukhshinder Shinda, Surinder Shinda, Pappi Gill, Nachattar Gill, Pammi Bai and <a href="Diljit%20Dosanjh">Diljit Dosanjh</a>, Punjabi folk has increased in popularity although it is fused in some cases. iTunes has catalogs of many Punjabi folk singers available.

Beastie Boys

Beastie Boys were an American <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> group from New York City, formed in 1981. For the majority of their career, the group consisted of <a href="Mike%20D">Michael "Mike D" Diamond</a> (vocals, drums), <a href="Adam%20Yauch">Adam "MCA" Yauch</a> (vocals, bass) and <a href="Ad-Rock">Adam "Ad-Rock" Horovitz</a> (vocals, guitar).

Originally formed as a four-piece <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore punk</a> band, the Young Aborigines, in 1978 by Diamond (vocals), John Berry (guitar), Yauch (bass) and <a href="Kate%20Schellenbach">Kate Schellenbach</a> (drums), the band appeared on the compilation cassette "<a href="New%20York%20Thrash">New York Thrash</a>", contributing two songs from their first <a href="extended%20play">EP</a>, "<a href="Polly%20Wog%20Stew">Polly Wog Stew</a>", in 1982. Berry left shortly thereafter, and was replaced by Horovitz. After achieving moderate local success with the 1983 <a href="experimental%20hip%20hop">experimental hip hop</a> <a href="12-inch%20single">12-inch single</a> "<a href="Cooky%20Puss">Cooky Puss</a>", Schellenbach dropped out and the Beastie Boys made a full transition to hip hop, releasing a string of successful <a href="singles%20%28music%29">singles</a>. They toured with <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a> in 1985 and a year later released their debut album "<a href="Licensed%20to%20Ill">Licensed to Ill</a>". The Beastie Boys have sold 26 million records in the United States and 50 million records worldwide, making them, according to "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>", the biggest-selling rap group since the magazine began recording sales data in 1991.

With seven <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">platinum</a> or better albums from 1986 to 2004, the Beastie Boys were one of the longest-lived hip hop acts worldwide. In 2009, they released digitally remastered deluxe editions of their albums "<a href="Paul%27s%20Boutique">Paul's Boutique</a>", "<a href="Check%20Your%20Head">Check Your Head</a>", "<a href="Ill%20Communication">Ill Communication</a>" and "<a href="Hello%20Nasty">Hello Nasty</a>". Their eighth studio album, "<a href="Hot%20Sauce%20Committee%20Part%20Two">Hot Sauce Committee Part Two</a>", was released in 2011, and received positive reviews. They were inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in April 2012, "just the third rap group to enter the Hall, after <a href="Run%E2%80%93D.M.C.">Run–D.M.C.</a> (2009) and <a href="Grandmaster%20Flash%20and%20the%20Furious%20Five">Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five</a> (2007)." The following month, MCA died of <a href="cancer">cancer</a> of the <a href="parotid%20gland">parotid salivary gland</a>. In June 2014, Mike D confirmed that he and Ad-Rock would not continue the Beastie Boys, out of respect to MCA.

Prior to forming the Beastie Boys, Michael Diamond was part of a number of bands such as the <a href="Walden%20School%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Walden</a> Jazz Band, BAN, and <a href="The%20Young%20Aborigines">The Young Aborigines</a>. The Beastie Boys formed in July 1981 when the Young Aborigines bassist Jeremy Shatan left New York City for the summer and the remaining members Michael Diamond, John Berry and Kate Schellenbach formed a new <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore punk</a> band with Adam Yauch called Beastie Boys. The band supported <a href="Bad%20Brains">Bad Brains</a>, the <a href="Dead%20Kennedys">Dead Kennedys</a>, the <a href="Misfits%20%28band%29">Misfits</a> and <a href="Reagan%20Youth">Reagan Youth</a> at venues such as <a href="CBGB">CBGB</a>, A7, Trudy Hellers Place and <a href="Max%27s%20Kansas%20City">Max's Kansas City</a>, playing at the latter venue on its closing night. In November 1982, the Beastie Boys recorded the 7" <a href="extended%20play">EP</a> "<a href="Polly%20Wog%20Stew">Polly Wog Stew</a>" at 171A studios, an early recorded example of <a href="New%20York%20hardcore">New York hardcore</a>.

On November 13, 1982, the Beastie Boys played Philip Pucci's birthday for the purposes of his short concert film of the Beastie Boys, "Beastie". Pucci held the concert in <a href="Bard%20College">Bard College</a>'s Preston Drama Dance Department Theatre. This performance marked the Beastie Boys' first on screen appearance in a published motion picture. Pucci's concept for "Beastie" was to distribute a mixture of both a half dozen 16 mm <a href="Bell%20%26amp%3B%20Howell">Bell & Howell</a> Filmo cameras, and 16 mm <a href="Bolex">Bolex</a> cameras to audience members and ask that they capture the Beastie Boys performance from the audience's own point of view while a master sync sound camera filmed from the balcony of the abandoned theater where the performance was held. The opening band for that performance was <a href="The%20Young%20and%20the%20Useless">The Young and the Useless</a>, which featured Adam Horovitz as the lead singer. A one-minute clip of "Beastie" was subsequently excerpted and licensed by the Beastie Boys for use in the "Egg Raid on Mojo" segment of the "Skills to Pay the Bills" long-form home video released by <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>. "Skills to Pay the Bills" later went on to be certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Berry left the group in 1982 (later forming Thwig, Big Fat Love and Bourbon Deluxe) and was replaced by Adam Horovitz, guitarist of <a href="The%20Young%20and%20the%20Useless">The Young and the Useless</a>, who had become close friends with the Beastie Boys at this point; Schellenbach left the band in 1984 and was not replaced, with Diamond filling the role of drummer. The band also recorded and then performed its first <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> track, "<a href="Cooky%20Puss">Cooky Puss</a>", based on a <a href="prank%20call">prank call</a> by the group to <a href="Carvel%20%28restaurant%29">Carvel Ice Cream</a> franchise in 1983. It was a part of the new line-up's first EP, also called "Cooky Puss", which was the first piece of work that showed their incorporation of the underground rap phenomenon and the use of samples. It quickly became a hit in New York underground dance clubs and night clubs upon its release.

In 1983, the new line-up released the "Cooky Puss" EP, which offered the first evidence of them picking up on the underground rap phenomenon and the use of samples. "Beastie Revolution" was later sampled for a <a href="British%20Airways">British Airways</a> commercial. The Beastie Boys sued them over the use of the song, earning them $40,000 in royalties.

Due to the success of "Cooky Puss", they began to incorporate rap into their sets. They decided to hire a DJ for their live shows and ended up getting an NYU student named <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a>. Soon thereafter, Rubin began producing records. He formed <a href="Def%20Jam%20Recordings">Def Jam Recordings</a> with fellow NY University student, <a href="Russell%20Simmons">Russell Simmons</a>, and approached the band about producing them for his new label. Around the same time, the band made a more complete switch over from a punk rock outfit to a three-man rap trio with drummer Kate Schellenbach leaving the group (later to join <a href="Luscious%20Jackson">Luscious Jackson</a> in 1991) and Diamond, Yauch and Horovitz each adopting their own <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> monikers—Mike D, MCA and Ad-Rock respectively.

They released the 12-inch single "<a href="Rock%20Hard">Rock Hard</a>" in 1984, which would be the second record released by Def Jam crediting Rubin as producer. In 1985, the band opened for <a href="John%20Lydon">John Lydon</a>'s post-<a href="Sex%20Pistols">Sex Pistols</a> band <a href="Public%20Image%20Ltd.">Public Image Ltd.</a>, as well as supporting <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a> on her North American <a href="The%20Virgin%20Tour">The Virgin Tour</a>. Then headlining with <a href="Fishbone">Fishbone</a> and <a href="Murphy%27s%20Law">Murphy's Law</a> with <a href="DJ%20Hurricane">DJ Hurricane</a> and later in the year, the group was on the "Raising Hell" tour with <a href="Run%20DMC">Run DMC</a>, <a href="Whodini">Whodini</a>, <a href="LL%20Cool%20J">LL Cool J</a>, and the <a href="Timex%20Social%20Club">Timex Social Club</a>. With their exposure on this tour, the track "Hold It Now, Hit It" charted on "Billboard"s US R&B and dance charts. The track "<a href="She%27s%20on%20It">She's on It</a>" from the "<a href="Krush%20Groove">Krush Groove</a>" soundtrack continued in a rap/metal vein while a double A-side 12", "<a href="Paul%20Revere%20%28song%29">Paul Revere</a>/The New Style", was released at the end of the year.

The band recorded "<a href="Licensed%20to%20Ill">Licensed to Ill</a>" throughout 1986 and released the album on November 15, 1986. The album was well-received, and was favorably reviewed by "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine with the now-famous headline, "Three Idiots Create a Masterpiece". "Licensed to Ill" became the best-selling rap album of the 1980s and the first rap album to go number 1 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart, where it stayed for five weeks. It also reached number 2 on the Top R&B album charts. It was Def Jam's fastest selling debut record to date and sold over nine million copies. The fourth single from the album, "<a href="%28You%20Gotta%29%20Fight%20for%20Your%20Right%20%28To%20Party%21%29">(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)</a>", reached number 7 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>, and the video (directed by <a href="Ric%20Menello">Ric Menello</a> and <a href="Adam%20Dubin">Adam Dubin</a>) became an MTV staple. Another song from the album, "<a href="No%20Sleep%20till%20Brooklyn">No Sleep till Brooklyn</a>", released in 1987, peaked at number 14 on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>.

The band took the "Licensed to Ill" tour around the world the following year. It was a tour clouded in controversy featuring female members of the crowd dancing in cages and a giant motorized inflatable penis similar to one used by <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a> in the 1970s. The tour was troubled by lawsuits and arrests, with the band accused of provoking the crowd. This culminated in their notorious gig at the <a href="Royal%20Court%20Theatre%2C%20Liverpool">Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool</a>, England on May 30, 1987 that erupted into a riot approximately 10 minutes after the Beasties hit the stage and the arrest of Adam Horovitz by <a href="Merseyside%20Police">Merseyside Police</a>. He was charged with assault causing grievous bodily harm.

After the success of "Licensed to Ill", the Beasties parted ways with Def Jam and ended their relationship with Rick Rubin to sign with <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>. "<a href="Tougher%20Than%20Leather%20%28film%29">Tougher Than Leather</a>", a movie made by Rick Rubin as a <a href="star%20vehicle">star vehicle</a> for <a href="Run-D.M.C.">Run-D.M.C.</a> and Def Jam Recordings with appearances by the Beastie Boys when they were still with the label, was released in 1988.

The group re-entered the studio in 1988, emerging with a more artistically mature second album, "<a href="Paul%27s%20Boutique">Paul's Boutique</a>", released on July 25, 1989 by <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>, after the falling out between the group and <a href="Def%20Jam%20Recordings">Def Jam Recordings</a>. It failed to match the sales of "Licensed to Ill", peaking at number 14 on the "Billboard" 200 and number 24 on the "Billboard" R&B charts. The lead single, "<a href="Hey%20Ladies">Hey Ladies</a>", reached number 36 on the "Billboard" 100 and number 10 on the R&B charts. "Rolling Stone" would describe the album as "the "<a href="Pet%20Sounds">Pet Sounds</a>"/"<a href="The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a>" of hip hop." Produced by the <a href="Dust%20Brothers">Dust Brothers</a> and Matt Dike, "Paul's Boutique" is an extremely <a href="sampling%20%28music%29">sample</a>-laden opus and is considered one of the strongest works by the Beastie Boys. "Rolling Stone" ranked it number 156 on its list of the <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>. It is also considered a landmark in hip hop recordings due to its large array of samples and intricate use of multi-layering. "Paul's Boutique" would eventually sell a million copies, despite the initially weak commercial reception. The album was titled after a Lower East Manhattan thrift store. The album was remastered and re-released in 2009.

The follow-up album, "<a href="Check%20Your%20Head">Check Your Head</a>", was recorded in the band's own "G-Son" studio in <a href="Atwater%20Village%2C%20California">Atwater Village</a>, California and released on its <a href="Grand%20Royal">Grand Royal</a> record label. The band was influenced to play instruments on this album by Dutch group <a href="Urban%20Dance%20Squad">Urban Dance Squad</a>; with Mike D on drums, Yauch on bass, Horovitz on guitar and Mark Ramos Nishita ("<a href="Money%20Mark">Keyboard Money Mark</a>") on keyboards. <a href="Mario%20Caldato%2C%20Jr.">Mario Caldato, Jr.</a>, who had helped in the production of "Paul's Boutique", engineered the record and became a longtime collaborator. "Check Your Head" was released in 1992 and was certified double Platinum in the US and peaked at number 10 on the "Billboard" 200. The single "<a href="So%20What%27cha%20Want">So What'cha Want</a>" reached number 93 on the "Billboard" 100 and charted on both the Rap and <a href="Alternative%20Songs">Modern Rock Chart</a>, while the album's first single, "<a href="Pass%20the%20Mic">Pass the Mic</a>", peaked at number 38 on the Hot Dance Music chart. The album also introduced a more experimental direction, with <a href="funk">funk</a> and <a href="jazz">jazz</a> inspired songs including "Lighten Up" and "<a href="Something%27s%20Got%20to%20Give%20%28song%29">Something's Got to Give</a>". The band returned to their hardcore punk roots for the song "<a href="Time%20for%20Livin%27">Time for Livin'</a>", a <a href="Sly%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Family%20Stone">Sly & the Family Stone</a> <a href="cover%20song">cover</a>. The addition of instruments and the harder rock sound of the album could be considered a precursor to the <a href="nu%20metal">nu metal</a> genre of music to come out in the later half of the 1990s.

Beastie Boys signed an eclectic roster of artists to their <a href="Grand%20Royal">Grand Royal</a> label, including Luscious Jackson, <a href="Sean%20Lennon">Sean Lennon</a> and promising Australian artist <a href="Ben%20Lee">Ben Lee</a>. The group owned Grand Royal Records until 2001 when it was then sold for financial reasons. Grand Royal's first independent release was Luscious Jackson's album "<a href="In%20Search%20of%20Manny">In Search of Manny</a>" in 1993. Also in 1993, the band contributed the track "It's the New Style" (with <a href="DJ%20Hurricane">DJ Hurricane</a>) to the AIDS benefit album "<a href="No%20Alternative">No Alternative</a>", produced by the <a href="Red%20Hot%20Organization">Red Hot Organization</a>.

The Beastie Boys also published "Grand Royal Magazine", with the first edition in 1993 featuring a cover story on <a href="Bruce%20Lee">Bruce Lee</a>, artwork by <a href="George%20Clinton%20%28funk%20musician%29">George Clinton</a>, and interviews with <a href="Kareem%20Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> and <a href="A%20Tribe%20Called%20Quest">A Tribe Called Quest</a> MC <a href="Q-Tip%20%28rapper%29">Q-Tip</a>. The 1995 issue of the magazine contained a memorable piece on the <a href="mullet%20%28haircut%29">mullet</a>. The "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" cites this as the first published use of the term, along with the lyrics from the Beasties' 1994 song, "Mullet Head". That term was not heard in the 1980s, even though that decade has retroactively been hailed as the mullet's peak in popularity. The "OED" says that the term was "apparently coined, and certainly popularized, by US hip-hop group the Beastie Boys". "Grand Royal Magazine" is also responsible for giving British band <a href="Sneaker%20Pimps">Sneaker Pimps</a> their name.

"<a href="Ill%20Communication">Ill Communication</a>", released in 1994, saw the Beastie Boys' return to the top of the charts when the album debuted at number 1 on the "Billboard" 200 and peaked at number 2 on the R&B/hip hop album chart. The single "<a href="Sabotage%20%28song%29">Sabotage</a>" became a hit on the <a href="modern%20rock">modern rock</a> charts and the music video, directed by <a href="Spike%20Jonze">Spike Jonze</a>, received extensive play on MTV. "<a href="Get%20It%20Together%20%28Beastie%20Boys%20song%29">Get It Together</a>" reached Top 10 on the "Billboard". Also in 1994, the band released "<a href="Some%20Old%20Bullshit">Some Old Bullshit</a>", featuring the band's early independent material, made number 46 on the "Billboard" independent charts.

Beastie Boys headlined at <a href="Lollapalooza">Lollapalooza</a>—an American travelling music festival—in 1994, together with <a href="The%20Smashing%20Pumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>. In addition, the band performed three concerts (in Los Angeles, New York City, and Washington D.C.) to raise money for the <a href="Milarepa%20Fund">Milarepa Fund</a> and dedicated the <a href="royalties">royalties</a> from "<a href="Shambala%20%28Beastie%20Boys%20song%29">Shambala</a>" and "Bodhisattva Vow" from the "Ill Communication" to the cause. The Milarepa Fund aims to raise awareness of <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a>an <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a> issues and the exile of the <a href="14th%20Dalai%20Lama">Dalai Lama</a>. In 1996, Yauch organized the largest rock benefit show since 1985's <a href="Live%20Aid">Live Aid</a> – the <a href="Tibetan%20Freedom%20Concert">Tibetan Freedom Concert</a>, a two-day festival at <a href="Golden%20Gate%20Park">Golden Gate Park</a> in San Francisco that attracted over 100,000 attendees.

In 1995, the popularity of Beastie Boys was underlined when tickets for an arena tour went on sale in the US and <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> and Chicago's <a href="Allstate%20Arena">Rosemont Horizon</a> sold out within 30 minutes. One dollar from each ticket sold went through Milarepa to local charities in each city on the tour. The Beastie Boys toured South America and Southeast Asia for the first time. The band also released "<a href="Aglio%20e%20Olio%20%28EP%29">Aglio e Olio</a>", a collection of eight songs lasting just 11 minutes harking back to their punk roots, in 1995. "<a href="The%20In%20Sound%20from%20Way%20Out%21%20%28Beastie%20Boys%20album%29">The in Sound from Way Out!</a>", a collection of previously released <a href="jazz">jazz</a>/<a href="funk">funk</a> instrumentals, was released on Grand Royal in 1996 with the title and artwork a homage to <a href="The%20In%20Sound%20from%20Way%20Out%21%20%28Perrey%20and%20Kingsley%20album%29">an album</a> by electronic pop music pioneers <a href="Perrey%20and%20Kingsley">Perrey and Kingsley</a>.

In 1992, The Beastie Boys decided to sample portions of the sound recording of "Choir" by <a href="James%20Newton">James Newton</a> in various renditions of their song "Pass the Mic". The band did not, however, obtain a license from Newton to use the underlying composition. Pursuant to their license from ECM Records, the Beastie Boys digitally sampled the opening six seconds of Newton's sound recording of "Choir", and repeated this six-second sample as a back ground element throughout their song. Newton brought suit, claiming that the Beastie Boys infringed his copyright in the underlying composition of "Choir". The district court granted the Beastie Boys a summary of judgement in their favor. The district court said that no license was required because the three-note segment of "Choir" lacked the requisite originality and was therefore not copyrightable.

Beastie Boys began work on the album "Hello Nasty" at the G-Son studios, Los Angeles in 1995, but continued to produce and record it in New York City after Yauch moved to Manhattan in 1996. The album displayed a substantial shift in musical feel, with the addition of <a href="Mix%20Master%20Mike">Mix Master Mike</a>. The album featured bombastic beats, rap samples, and experimental sounds. Released on July 14, 1998, "Hello Nasty" earned first week sales of 681,000 in the US and went straight to number 1 in the US, the UK, Germany, Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Sweden. The album achieved number 2 rank in the charts in Canada and Japan, and reached top ten chart positions in Austria, Switzerland, Ireland, Belgium, Finland, France and Israel.

Beastie Boys won two <a href="Grammy%20Awards%20of%201999">Grammy Awards in 1999</a>, receiving the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Alternative%20Music%20Album">Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album</a> for "Hello Nasty" as well as the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Rap%20Performance%20by%20a%20Duo%20or%20Group">Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group</a> for "<a href="Intergalactic%20%28song%29">Intergalactic</a>". This was the first and, as of 2008, only time that a band had won awards in both rap and alternative categories.

Also at the <a href="1998%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">1998 MTV Video Music Awards</a> they won <a href="Michael%20Jackson%20Video%20Vanguard%20Award">Video Vanguard Award</a> for their contribution to music videos. The following year at the <a href="1999%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">1999 MTV Video Music Awards</a> they also won the award for Best Hip Hop Video for their hit song "Intergalactic". Beastie Boys used both appearances at the Video Music Awards to make politically charged speeches of considerable length to the sizable MTV audiences. At the 1998 ceremony, Yauch addressed the issue of Muslim people being stereotyped as terrorists and that most people of the Muslim faith are not terrorists. These comments were made in the wake of the <a href="1998%20United%20States%20embassy%20bombings">US Embassy bombings</a> that had occurred in both <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a> and <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a> only a month earlier. At the 1999 ceremony in the wake of the horror stories that were coming out of <a href="Woodstock%2099">Woodstock 99</a>, Adam Horovitz addressed the fact that there had been many cases of sexual assaults and rapes at the festival, suggesting the need for bands and festivals to pay much more attention to the security details at their concerts.

Beastie Boys started an arena tour in 1998. Through Ian C. Rogers, the band made live downloads of their performances available for their fans, but were temporarily thwarted when Capitol Records removed them from its website. The Beastie Boys was one of the first bands who made MP3 downloads available on their website; they got a high level of response and public awareness as a result including a published article in "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" on the band's efforts.

On September 28, 1999, Beastie Boys joined <a href="Elvis%20Costello">Elvis Costello</a> to play "Radio Radio" on the 25th anniversary season of "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>".

Beastie Boys released "", a two-CD anthology of their works in 1999. This album reached number  19 on the Billboard 200, number 18 in Canada, and number 14 on the R&B/Hip Hop charts. The one new song, the single "<a href="Alive%20%28Beastie%20Boys%20song%29">Alive</a>", reached number 11 on the Billboard's Modern Rock chart.

In 2000, Beastie Boys had planned to co-headline the "Rhyme and Reason Tour" with <a href="Rage%20Against%20the%20Machine">Rage Against the Machine</a> and <a href="Busta%20Rhymes">Busta Rhymes</a>, but the tour was canceled when drummer Mike D suffered a serious injury due to a bicycle accident. The official diagnosis was fifth-degree <a href="Separated%20shoulder">acromioclavicular joint dislocation</a>; he needed surgery and extensive rehabilitation. By the time he recovered, Rage Against the Machine had disbanded, although they would reunite seven years later.

Under the name "Country Mike", Mike D recorded an album, "<a href="Country%20Mike%27s%20Greatest%20Hits">Country Mike's Greatest Hits</a>", and gave it to friends and family for Christmas in 2000. Adam "Ad-Rock" Horovitz's side project <a href="BS%202000">BS 2000</a> released "<a href="Simply%20Mortified">Simply Mortified</a>" in 2001.

The band increased its level of political activism after the <a href="September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, organizing and headlining the New Yorkers Against Violence Concert at the Hamerstein Ballroom in October 2001.

"Hello Nasty" was reissued on September 22, 2009.

In 2002, Adam Yauch started building a new studio facility, "<a href="Oscilloscope%20Laboratories">Oscilloscope Laboratories</a>", in downtown <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, New York and the band started work on a new album there. The band released a <a href="protest%20song">protest song</a>, "In A World Gone Mad", against the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">2003 Iraq war</a> as a free download on several websites, including the Milarepa website, the MTV website, <a href="MoveOn.org">MoveOn.org</a>, and <a href="Win%20Without%20War">Win Without War</a>. The 19th and 20th Tibetan Freedom Concerts were held in Tokyo and Taipei, Beastie Boys' first Taiwan appearance. Beastie Boys also headlined the <a href="Coachella%20Valley%20Music%20and%20Arts%20Festival">Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival</a>.

Their single, "Ch-Check It Out", debuted on "<a href="The%20O.C.">The O.C.</a>" in "The Vegas" episode from Season 1, which aired April 28, 2004.

"<a href="To%20the%205%20Boroughs">To the 5 Boroughs</a>" was released worldwide on June 15, 2004. It was the first album the Beastie Boys produced themselves and reached number 1 on the Billboard album charts, number 2 in the UK and Australia, and number 3 in Germany. The first single from the album, "<a href="Ch-Check%20It%20Out">Ch-Check It Out</a>", reached number 1 in Canada and on the <a href="Modern%20Rock%20Tracks">US Modern Rock Tracks</a> chart.

The album was the cause of some controversy with allegations that it installed <a href="spyware">spyware</a> when inserted into the CD drive of a computer. The band denied this allegation, defending that there is no copy protection software on the albums sold in the US and UK. While there is <a href="Macrovision%20CDS-200">Macrovision CDS-200</a> copy protection software installed on European copies of the album, this is standard practice for all European releases on <a href="EMI%20Records">EMI</a>/Capitol Records released in Europe, and it does not install spyware or any form of permanent software.

The band stated in mid-2006 that they were writing material for their next album and would be producing it themselves.
Speaking to British music weekly "<a href="NME">NME</a>" (April 26, 2007), Diamond revealed that a new album was to be called "<a href="The%20Mix-Up">The Mix-Up</a>". Despite initial confusion regarding whether the album would have lyrics as opposed to being purely instrumental, the Mic-To-Mic blog reported that <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a> had confirmed it would be strictly instrumental and erroneously reported a release date scheduled for July 10, 2007. (The album was eventually released June 26, as originally reported.) On May 1, 2007, this was further cemented by an e-mail sent to those on the Beastie Boys' mailing list – explicitly stating that the album would be all instrumental:

The band played several tracks from the album at the 2007 <a href="Virgin%20Festival">Virgin Festival</a> at <a href="Pimlico%20Race%20Course">Pimlico Race Course</a> in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, Maryland.

The band subsequently confirmed the new album and announced a short tour that focused on festivals as opposed to a traditional tour, including the likes of <a href="S%C3%B3nar">Sónar</a> (Spain), <a href="Roskilde%20Festival">Roskilde</a> (Denmark), <a href="Hurricane%20Festival">Hurricane</a>/<a href="Southside%20Festival">Southside</a> (Germany), <a href="Bestival">Bestival</a> (<a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>), <a href="Electric%20Picnic">Electric Picnic</a> (Ireland) and <a href="Open%27er%20Festival">Open'er Festival</a> (Poland). Beastie Boys performed at the <a href="Live%20Earth%20concert%2C%20London">UK leg</a> of <a href="Live%20Earth">Live Earth</a> July 7, 2007 at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a>, London with "<a href="Sabotage%20%28song%29">Sabotage</a>", "<a href="So%20What%27cha%20Want">So What'cha Want</a>", "<a href="Intergalactic%20%28song%29">Intergalactic</a>", and "<a href="Sure%20Shot">Sure Shot</a>".

They worked with <a href="Reverb%20%28non-profit%29">Reverb</a>, a non-profit environmental organization, on their 2007 summer tour.

They won a Grammy for "The Mix-Up" in the "<a href="Best%20Pop%20Instrumental%20Album">Best Pop Instrumental Album</a>" category at the <a href="50th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">50th Annual Grammy Awards</a> in 2008.

In February 2009, Yauch revealed their forthcoming new album has taken the band's sound in a "bizarre" new direction, saying "It's a combination of playing and sampling stuff as we're playing, and also sampling pretty obscure records." The tentative title for the record was "Tadlock's Glasses", of which Yauch explained the inspiration behind the title:

On May 25, 2009, it was announced during an interview on "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon" that the name of their new album would be "<a href="Hot%20Sauce%20Committee%20Part%20Two">Hot Sauce Committee</a>" and was set for release on September 15 (with the track listing of the album announced through their mailing list on June 23). The album included a collaboration with <a href="Santigold">Santigold</a> who co-wrote and sang with the band on the track "<a href="Don%27t%20Play%20No%20Game%20That%20I%20Can%27t%20Win">Don't Play No Game That I Can't Win</a>".

In June, the group appeared at <a href="Bonnaroo%20Music%20and%20Arts%20Festival">Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival</a> and performed the new single from the album titled "Too Many Rappers" alongside rapper <a href="Nas">Nas</a> who appears on the track. It would be the last live performance by the Beastie Boys as a trio. The group would have toured the UK later in the year in support of the new record.

Speaking to "<a href="Drowned%20in%20Sound">Drowned in Sound</a>", the Beastie Boys revealed that Part 2 was done. Mike D also hinted it may be released via unusual means:

On July 20, Yauch announced on the Beastie Boys' official YouTube channel and through the fan mailing list, the cancellation of several tour dates and the postponement of the new album due to the discovery of a cancerous tumor in his <a href="parotid%20gland">parotid gland</a> and a lymph node. The group also had to cancel their co-headlining gig at the <a href="Osheaga%20Festival">Osheaga Festival</a> in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> as well as a headlining spot at 2009's <a href="Lollapalooza">Lollapalooza</a> and also another headlining spot for the first night of the <a href="All%20Points%20West%20Festival">All Points West Festival</a> in <a href="Jersey%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Jersey City, New Jersey</a>.

In late October 2010, the Beastie Boys sent out two emails regarding the status of "Hot Sauce Committee" Pts. 1 and 2 to their online mailing list. An email dated October 18 read: "Although we regret to inform you that "Hot Sauce Committee Part 1" will continue to be delayed indefinitely, "Hot Sauce Committee Part 2" will be released on time as originally planned in spring of 2011." One week later, a second email was sent out, reading as follows:

The official release dates were April 27, 2011 for Japan; April 29 in the UK and Europe, and May 3, 2011 in the US. The third single for the album is "<a href="Make%20Some%20Noise%20%28Beastie%20Boys%20song%29">Make Some Noise</a>" was made available for download on April 11, 2011 as well as a limited edition 7" vinyl single for <a href="Record%20Store%20Day">Record Store Day</a> five days later with a Passion Pit remix of the track as a b-side. The track was leaked online on April 6 and subsequently made available via their blog.

On April 22, the Beastie Boys emailed out the cryptic message ""This Sat, 10:35 am EST – Just listen, listen, listen to the beat box"". A day later, they live streamed their album online via beatbox inside Madison Square Garden.

The band was announced as an inductee into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in December 2011. They were inducted by <a href="Chuck%20D">Chuck D</a> and <a href="LL%20Cool%20J">LL Cool J</a> on April 14, 2012. Yauch was too sick to attend the ceremony, having been admitted to <a href="NewYork%E2%80%93Presbyterian%20Hospital">NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital</a> the same day, therefore the group didn't perform; instead <a href="Black%20Thought">Black Thought</a>, <a href="Travie">Travie</a> from <a href="Gym%20Class%20Heroes">Gym Class Heroes</a> and <a href="Kid%20Rock">Kid Rock</a> performed a medley of their songs. Diamond and Horovitz accepted and read a speech that Yauch had written.

On May 4, 2012, Yauch died from cancer at the age of 47. On May 24, in an interview with "Rolling Stone", Mike D claimed that the Beastie Boys recorded new music in late 2011 after the release of "Hot Sauce Committee (Part 2)", although it was not indicated if or when these recordings would be released. During the same interview, Mike D claimed that the Beastie Boys will likely disband due to the death of MCA, although he is open to making new music with Ad-Rock in the future. Nothing certain has been said regarding the future of the band, but Mike D stated he would like to continue making music and "Yauch would genuinely want us to try whatever crazy thing we wanted but never got around to."

In April 2013 it was announced that the group has signed a deal to write an autobiography. The book was scheduled to be released in the fall of 2015. 
However, Horovitz stated that the autobiography is being delayed. According to Horovitz, "We've got pages!...How it's going to fit together, I don't know. But we've got some ideas. It's interesting. It's fun."

On May 3, 2013 a children's playground in Brooklyn was renamed for Adam Yauch.

In June 2014, Mike D stated that neither he nor Horovitz would ever perform under the name the Beastie Boys again out of respect for Yauch.

Founding Beastie Boys guitarist John Berry died on May 19, 2016, aged 52, as a result of <a href="frontotemporal%20dementia">frontotemporal dementia</a>, after a decline of health for several years. He was credited with coming up with the Beastie Boys name, and played guitar on the first <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a> the Beastie Boys recorded. Before the Beastie Boys, he was also a part of <a href="Even%20Worse%20%28band%29">Even Worse</a>, Big Fat Love, Highway Stars, Bourbon Deluxe, and <a href="Idaho%20%28band%29">Idaho</a>. The first Beastie Boys show took place at Berry's loft.

In 1994, Adam Yauch and activist Erin Potts organized the <a href="Tibetan%20Freedom%20Concert">Tibetan Freedom Concert</a> in order to raise awareness of <a href="Human%20rights%20in%20Tibet">humans rights abuses</a> by the <a href="China">Chinese government</a> on the <a href="Tibetan%20people">Tibetan people</a>.

Yauch became aware of this after hiking in <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a> and speaking with Tibetan refugees. The events became annual, and shortly after went international with acts such as <a href="Live%20%28band%29">Live</a>, <a href="Mike%20Mills">Mike Mills</a> and <a href="Michael%20Stipe">Michael Stipe</a> of <a href="R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a>, <a href="Rage%20Against%20the%20Machine">Rage Against the Machine</a>, <a href="Smashing%20Pumpkins">Smashing Pumpkins</a>, and <a href="U2">U2</a>.

Originally a <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore punk</a> band, Beastie Boys largely abandoned the genre in favor of <a href="hip%20hop%20music">hip hop</a> and <a href="rap%20rock">rap rock</a> by the time they worked on their debut studio album "Licensed to Ill".

Around the time of the release of their debut album, "Licensed to Ill", Mike D started to appear on stage and in publicity photographs wearing a large <a href="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> emblem attached to a chain-link necklace. This started a rash of thefts of the emblem from vehicles around the world as fans tried to emulate him. A controversial concert in <a href="Columbus%2C%20Georgia">Columbus</a>, Georgia in 1987 led to the passage of a lewdness ordinance in that city.

The Beastie Boys are considered very influential in both the hip hop and rock music scenes, with artists from <a href="Eminem">Eminem</a> to <a href="Rage%20Against%20the%20Machine">Rage Against the Machine</a> to <a href="Limp%20Bizkit">Limp Bizkit</a>, to <a href="Sublime%20%28band%29">Sublime</a>, and <a href="Blur%20%28band%29">Blur</a> citing them as an influence. Beastie Boys have had four albums reach the top of the "Billboard" album charts ("Licensed to Ill", "Ill Communication", "Hello Nasty" and "To The 5 Boroughs") since 1986. In the November 2004 issue, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" named "Sabotage" the 475th song on their <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a> list.
In their April 2005 issue, "Rolling Stone" ranked them number 77 on their list of the <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20100%20Greatest%20Artists%20of%20All%20Time">100 Greatest Artists of All Time</a>. <a href="VH1">VH1</a> ranked them number 89 on their list of their 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. On September 27, 2007, it was announced that Beastie Boys were one of the nine nominees for the 2008 <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> Inductions. In December 2011, they were announced to be official 2012 inductees.

In 2003, Beastie Boys were involved in the landmark <a href="sampling%20%28music%29">sampling</a> decision, "<a href="Legal%20issues%20surrounding%20music%20sampling">Newton v. Diamond</a>". In that case, a federal judge ruled that the band was not liable for sampling <a href="James%20Newton">James Newton</a>'s "Choir" in their track, "Pass the Mic". The sample used is the six-second flute stab. In short, the Beasties cleared the sample but obtained only the rights to use the sound recording and not the composition rights to the song "Choir". In the decision, the judge found that:

British Isles

The British Isles are a <a href="archipelago">group of islands</a> off the north-western coast of <a href="continental%20Europe">continental Europe</a> that consist of the islands of <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>, <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a>, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two <a href="sovereign%20state">sovereign state</a>s are located on the islands: <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a>. The British Isles also include three <a href="Crown%20Dependencies">Crown Dependencies</a>: the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> and, by tradition, the <a href="Jersey">Bailiwick of Jersey</a> and the <a href="Guernsey">Bailiwick of Guernsey</a> in the <a href="Channel%20Islands">Channel Islands</a>, although the latter are not physically a part of the <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a>.

The oldest rocks in the group are in the north west of <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, Ireland and North Wales and are 2,700 <a href="Mya%20%28unit%29">million years old</a>. During the <a href="Silurian">Silurian</a> period the north-western regions <a href="plate%20tectonics">collided</a> with the south-east, which had been part of a separate continental landmass. The topography of the islands is modest in scale by global standards. <a href="Ben%20Nevis">Ben Nevis</a> rises to an <a href="summit%20%28topography%29">elevation</a> of only , and <a href="Lough%20Neagh">Lough Neagh</a>, which is notably larger than other lakes on the isles, covers . The climate is <a href="Temperateness">temperate</a> <a href="Oceanic%20climate">marine</a>, with mild winters and warm summers. The <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Current">North Atlantic Drift</a> brings significant moisture and raises temperatures 11 °C (20 °F) above the global average for the latitude. This led to a landscape which was long dominated by <a href="temperate%20rainforest">temperate rainforest</a>, although human activity has since cleared the vast majority of forest cover. The region was re-inhabited after the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a> of <a href="Quaternary%20glaciation">Quaternary glaciation</a>, by 12,000 BC, when Great Britain was still part of a <a href="Doggerland">peninsula of the European continent</a>. Ireland, which became an island by 12,000 BC, was not inhabited until after 8000 BC. Great Britain became an island by 5600 BC.

<a href="Gaels">Hiberni</a> (Ireland), <a href="Picts">Pictish</a> (northern Britain) and <a href="Britons%20%28historical%29">Britons</a> (southern Britain) tribes, all speaking <a href="Insular%20Celtic%20languages">Insular Celtic</a>, inhabited the islands at the beginning of the 1st millennium AD. Much of Brittonic-controlled Britain was <a href="Roman%20conquest%20of%20Britain">conquered by the Roman Empire</a> from AD 43. The first <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> arrived as Roman power waned in the 5th century and eventually dominated the bulk of what is now England. <a href="Viking">Viking</a> invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements and political change—particularly in England. The subsequent <a href="Normans">Norman</a> conquest of England in 1066 and the later <a href="Angevin%20Empire">Angevin</a> partial conquest of Ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new Norman ruling elite across much of Britain and parts of Ireland. By the <a href="Late%20Middle%20Ages">Late Middle Ages</a>, Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a>, while control in Ireland fluxed between <a href="Gaelic%20Ireland">Gaelic kingdoms</a>, <a href="Hiberno-Norman">Hiberno-Norman lords</a> and the English-dominated <a href="Lordship%20of%20Ireland">Lordship of Ireland</a>, soon restricted only to <a href="The%20Pale">The Pale</a>. The 1603 <a href="Union%20of%20the%20Crowns">Union of the Crowns</a>, <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">Acts of Union 1707</a> and <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201800">Acts of Union 1800</a> attempted to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a>, with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as <a href="Crown%20Dependencies">Crown Dependencies</a>. The expansion of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> and migrations following the <a href="Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29">Irish Famine</a> and <a href="Highland%20Clearances">Highland Clearances</a> resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish War of Independence</a> and the subsequent <a href="Anglo-Irish%20Treaty">Anglo-Irish Treaty</a> (1919–1922), with six counties remaining in the UK as <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>.

The term "British Isles" is <a href="British%20Isles%20naming%20dispute">controversial</a> in Ireland, where there are objections to its usage due to the association of the word "British" with Ireland. The <a href="Government%20of%20Ireland">Government of Ireland</a> does not recognise or use the term and its embassy in London discourages its use. As a result, Britain and Ireland is used as an alternative description, and Atlantic Archipelago has had limited use among a minority in academia, while "British Isles" is still commonly employed. Within them, they are also sometimes referred to as "these islands".

The earliest known references to the islands as a group appeared in the writings of sea-farers from the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greek</a> colony of <a href="Marseille%23Prehistory%20and%20classical%20antiquity">Massalia</a>. The original records have been lost; however, later writings, e.g. <a href="Avienus">Avienus</a>'s "Ora maritima", that quoted from the <a href="Massaliote%20Periplus">Massaliote Periplus</a> (6th century BC) and from <a href="Pytheas">Pytheas</a>'s "On the Ocean" (<a href="circa">circa</a> 325–320 BC) have survived. In the 1st century BC, <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a> has "Prettanikē nēsos", "the British Island", and "Prettanoi", "the Britons". <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> used Βρεττανική ("Brettanike"), and <a href="Marcian%20of%20Heraclea">Marcian of Heraclea</a>, in his "Periplus maris exteri", used αἱ Πρεττανικαί νῆσοι ("the Prettanic Isles") to refer to the islands. Historians today, though not in absolute agreement, largely agree that these Greek and Latin names were probably drawn from native <a href="Celtic%20languages">Celtic-language</a> names for the archipelago. Along these lines, the inhabitants of the islands were called the Πρεττανοί ("<a href="Priteni">Priteni</a>" or "Pretani"). The shift from the "P" of "Pretannia" to the "B" of "<a href="Britannia">Britannia</a>" by the Romans occurred during the time of <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a>.

The <a href="Greeks%20in%20Egypt">Greco-Egyptian</a> scientist <a href="Claudius%20Ptolemy">Claudius Ptolemy</a> referred to the larger island as "great Britain" ("μεγάλης Βρεττανίας – megális Brettanias") and to Ireland as "little Britain" ("μικρής Βρεττανίας – mikris Brettanias") in his work "<a href="Almagest">Almagest</a>" (147–148 AD). In his later work, "<a href="Geography%20%28Ptolemy%29">Geography</a>" (c. 150 AD), he gave these islands the names "<a href="Albion">Alwion</a>", "<a href="Hibernia">Iwernia</a>", and "Mona" (the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a>), suggesting these may have been names of the individual islands not known to him at the time of writing "Almagest". The name "Albion" appears to have fallen out of use sometime after the <a href="Roman%20conquest%20of%20Britain">Roman conquest of Great Britain</a>, after which "Britain" became the more commonplace name for the island called Great Britain.

The earliest known use of the phrase "Brytish Iles" in the English language is dated 1577 in a work by <a href="John%20Dee">John Dee</a>. Today, this name is seen by some as carrying imperialist overtones although it is still commonly used. Other names used to describe the islands include the "<a href="Anglo-Celtic">Anglo-Celtic</a> Isles", "Atlantic archipelago", "British-Irish Isles", "Britain and Ireland", "UK and Ireland", and "British Isles and Ireland". Owing to political and national associations with the word "British", the Government of Ireland does not use the term "British Isles" and in documents drawn up jointly between the British and Irish governments, the archipelago is referred to simply as "these islands". Nonetheless, British Isles is still the most widely accepted term for the archipelago.

The British Isles lie at the juncture of several regions with past episodes of <a href="tectonics">tectonic</a> mountain building. These <a href="Orogeny">orogenic belts</a> form a complex geology that records a huge and varied span of Earth's history. Of particular note was the <a href="Caledonian%20Orogeny">Caledonian Orogeny</a> during the <a href="Ordovician">Ordovician</a> Period, c. 488–444 <a href="year">Ma</a> and early <a href="Silurian">Silurian</a> period, when the <a href="craton">craton</a> <a href="Baltica">Baltica</a> collided with the <a href="terrane">terrane</a> <a href="Avalonia">Avalonia</a> to form the mountains and hills in northern Britain and Ireland. Baltica formed roughly the northwestern half of Ireland and Scotland. Further collisions caused the <a href="Variscan%20orogeny">Variscan orogeny</a> in the <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> and <a href="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> periods, forming the hills of <a href="Munster">Munster</a>, southwest England, and southern Wales. Over the last 500 million years the land that forms the islands has drifted northwest from around 30°S, crossing the <a href="equator">equator</a> around 370 million years ago to reach its present northern latitude.

The islands have been shaped by numerous glaciations during the <a href="Quaternary%20Period">Quaternary Period</a>, the most recent being the <a href="Devensian">Devensian</a>. As this ended, the central <a href="Irish%20Sea">Irish Sea</a> was deglaciated and the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> flooded, with sea levels rising to current levels some 4,000 to 5,000 years ago, leaving the British Isles in their current form. Whether or not there was a land bridge between Great Britain and Ireland at this time is somewhat disputed, though there was certainly a single ice sheet covering the entire sea.

The west coasts of Ireland and Scotland that directly face the Atlantic Ocean are generally characterised by long <a href="peninsula">peninsula</a>s, and headlands and bays; the internal and eastern coasts are "smoother".

There are about <a href="List%20of%20the%20British%20Isles%20by%20area">136 permanently inhabited islands</a> in the group, the largest two being Great Britain and Ireland. Great Britain is to the east and covers . Ireland is to the west and covers . The largest of the other islands are to be found in the <a href="Hebrides">Hebrides</a>, <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a> to the north, <a href="Anglesey">Anglesey</a> and the Isle of Man between Great Britain and Ireland, and the <a href="Channel%20Islands">Channel Islands</a> near the coast of France.

The islands are at relatively low altitudes, with central Ireland and southern Great Britain particularly low-lying: the lowest point in the islands is <a href="Holme%2C%20Cambridgeshire">Holme, Cambridgeshire</a> at . The <a href="Scottish%20Highlands">Scottish Highlands</a> in the northern part of Great Britain are mountainous, with <a href="Ben%20Nevis">Ben Nevis</a> being the highest point on the islands at . Other mountainous areas include Wales and parts of Ireland, however only seven peaks in these areas reach above . Lakes on the islands are generally not large, although <a href="Lough%20Neagh">Lough Neagh</a> in Northern Ireland is an exception, covering . The largest freshwater body in Great Britain (by area) is <a href="Loch%20Lomond">Loch Lomond</a> at , and <a href="Loch%20Ness">Loch Ness</a>, by volume whilst <a href="Loch%20Morar">Loch Morar</a> is the deepest freshwater body in the British Isles, with a maximum depth of . There are a number of major rivers within the British Isles. The longest is the <a href="River%20Shannon">Shannon</a> in Ireland at . The <a href="river%20Severn">river Severn</a> at is the longest in Great Britain.

The climate is mild, moist and changeable with abundant <a href="rainfall">rainfall</a> and a lack of <a href="temperature%20extremes">temperature extremes</a>. It is defined as a <a href="temperate">temperate</a> <a href="oceanic%20climate">oceanic climate</a>, or "Cfb" on the <a href="K%C3%B6ppen%20climate%20classification">Köppen climate classification</a> system, a classification it shares with most of northwest Europe. The country receives generally cool summers and mild winters. The <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Current">North Atlantic Drift</a> ("Gulf Stream"), which flows from the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, brings with it significant moisture and raises temperatures 11 °C (20 °F) above the global average for the islands' latitudes. Winters are cool and wet, with summers mild and also wet. Most Atlantic <a href="Low%20pressure%20area">depressions</a> pass to the north of the islands, combined with the general <a href="Westerlies">westerly circulation</a> and interactions with the landmass, this imposes an east-west variation in climate.

The islands enjoy a mild climate and varied <a href="soil">soil</a>s, giving rise to a diverse pattern of <a href="vegetation">vegetation</a>. Animal and plant life is similar to that of the northwestern <a href="European%20mainland">European mainland</a>. There are however, fewer numbers of <a href="species">species</a>, with Ireland having even less. All native <a href="flora">flora</a> and <a href="fauna">fauna</a> in Ireland is made up of species that migrated from elsewhere in Europe, and Great Britain in particular. The only window when this could have occurred was between the end of <a href="Pleistocene">the last Ice Age</a> (about 12,000 years ago) and when the land bridge connecting the two islands was flooded by sea (about 8,000 years ago).

As with most of Europe, prehistoric Britain and Ireland were covered with forest and swamp. Clearing began around 6000 BC and accelerated in medieval times. Despite this, Britain retained its primeval forests longer than most of Europe due to a small population and later development of trade and industry, and wood shortages were not a problem until the 17th century. By the 18th century, most of Britain's forests were consumed for shipbuilding or manufacturing charcoal and the nation was forced to import lumber from Scandinavia, North America, and the Baltic. Most forest land in Ireland is maintained by state <a href="Afforestation">forestation programmes</a>. Almost all land outside urban areas is <a href="Arable%20land">farmland</a>. However, relatively large areas of forest remain in east and north Scotland and in southeast England. <a href="Oak">Oak</a>, <a href="elm">elm</a>, <a href="Fraxinus">ash</a> and <a href="beech">beech</a> are amongst the most common trees in England. In Scotland, <a href="pine">pine</a> and <a href="birch">birch</a> are most common. Natural forests in Ireland are mainly oak, ash, <a href="wych%20elm">wych elm</a>, birch and pine. Beech and <a href="Tilia">lime</a>, though not native to Ireland, are also common there. Farmland hosts a variety of semi-natural vegetation of <a href="grass">grass</a>es and flowering plants. Woods, <a href="hedgerows">hedgerows</a>, mountain slopes and <a href="marsh">marsh</a>es host <a href="Ericaceae">heather</a>, wild grasses, <a href="gorse">gorse</a> and <a href="bracken">bracken</a>.

Many larger animals, such as <a href="wolf">wolf</a>, bear and the European <a href="moose">elk</a> are today extinct. However, some species such as <a href="red%20deer">red deer</a> are protected. Other small mammals, such as <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s, <a href="fox">fox</a>es, <a href="badger">badger</a>s, <a href="hare">hare</a>s, <a href="hedgehog">hedgehog</a>s, and <a href="stoat">stoat</a>s, are very common and the European beaver has been reintroduced in parts of Scotland. <a href="Wild%20boar">Wild boar</a> have also been reintroduced to parts of southern England, following escapes from boar farms and illegal releases. Many rivers contain <a href="otter">otter</a>s and <a href="Pinniped">seal</a>s are common on coasts. Over 200 species of bird reside permanently and another 200 migrate. Common types are the <a href="common%20chaffinch">common chaffinch</a>, <a href="common%20blackbird">common blackbird</a>, <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a> and <a href="common%20starling">common starling</a>; all small birds. Large birds are declining in number, except for those kept for game such as <a href="pheasant">pheasant</a>, <a href="partridge">partridge</a>, and <a href="red%20grouse">red grouse</a>. Fish are abundant in the rivers and lakes, in particular <a href="salmon">salmon</a>, <a href="trout">trout</a>, <a href="perch">perch</a> and <a href="Esox">pike</a>. Sea fish include <a href="Squalidae">dogfish</a>, <a href="cod">cod</a>, <a href="sole%20%28fish%29">sole</a>, <a href="pollock">pollock</a> and <a href="Bass%20%28fish%29">bass</a>, as well as <a href="mussels">mussels</a>, crab and <a href="oysters">oysters</a> along the coast. There are more than 21,000 species of insects.

Few species of <a href="reptiles">reptiles</a> or <a href="amphibians">amphibians</a> are found in Great Britain or Ireland. Only three <a href="snakes">snakes</a> are native to Great Britain: the <a href="Vipera%20berus">common European adder</a>, the <a href="Natrix%20natrix">grass snake</a> and the <a href="Coronella%20austriaca">smooth snake</a>; none are native to Ireland. In general, Great Britain has slightly more variation and native wild life, with <a href="weasels">weasels</a>, <a href="European%20polecat">polecat</a>s, <a href="wildcats">wildcats</a>, most <a href="shrews">shrews</a>, <a href="European%20mole">moles</a>, <a href="European%20water%20vole">water voles</a>, <a href="roe%20deer">roe deer</a> and <a href="common%20toad">common toad</a>s also being absent from Ireland. This pattern is also true for birds and insects. Notable exceptions include the <a href="Kerry%20slug">Kerry slug</a> and certain species of <a href="woodlouse">woodlouse</a> native to Ireland but not Great Britain.

Domestic animals include the <a href="Connemara%20pony">Connemara pony</a>, <a href="Shetland%20pony">Shetland pony</a>, <a href="English%20Mastiff">English Mastiff</a>, <a href="Irish%20wolfhound">Irish wolfhound</a> and many varieties of <a href="cattle">cattle</a> and <a href="sheep">sheep</a>.

The demographics of the British Isles today are characterised by a generally high density of population in England, which accounts for almost 80% of the total population of the islands. In elsewhere on Great Britain and on Ireland, high density of population is limited to areas around, or close to, a few large cities. The largest urban area by far is the <a href="Greater%20London%20Urban%20Area">Greater London Urban Area</a> with 9 million inhabitants. Other major population centres include the <a href="Greater%20Manchester%20Urban%20Area">Greater Manchester Urban Area</a> (2.4 million), <a href="West%20Midlands%20conurbation">West Midlands conurbation</a> (2.4 million) and <a href="West%20Yorkshire%20Urban%20Area">West Yorkshire Urban Area</a> (1.6 million) in England, <a href="Greater%20Glasgow">Greater Glasgow</a> (1.2 million) in Scotland and <a href="Greater%20Dublin%20Area">Greater Dublin Area</a> (1.1 million) in Ireland.

The population of England rose rapidly during the 19th and 20th centuries, whereas the populations of Scotland and Wales showed little increase during the 20th century, the population of Scotland remaining unchanged since 1951. Ireland for most of its history comprised a population proportionate to its land area (about one third of the total population). However, since the <a href="Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29">Great Irish Famine</a>, the population of Ireland has fallen to less than one tenth of the population of the British Isles. The famine, which caused a century-long population decline, drastically reduced the Irish population and permanently altered the demographic make-up of the British Isles. On a global scale, this disaster led to the creation of an <a href="Irish%20diaspora">Irish diaspora</a> that numbers fifteen times the current population of the island.

The linguistic heritage of the British Isles is rich, with twelve <a href="languages">languages</a> from six groups across four branches of the <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a> <a href="Language%20family">family</a>. The <a href="Insular%20Celtic%20languages">Insular Celtic languages</a> of the <a href="Goidelic">Goidelic</a> sub-group (<a href="Irish%20Language">Irish</a>, <a href="Manx%20language">Manx</a> and <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic%20language">Scottish Gaelic</a>) and the <a href="Brittonic%20languages">Brittonic</a> sub-group (<a href="Cornish%20language">Cornish</a>, Welsh and <a href="Breton%20language">Breton</a>, spoken in <a href="Brittany">north-western France</a>) are the only remaining <a href="Celtic%20languages">Celtic languages</a>—the last of their continental relations becoming extinct before the 7th century. The <a href="Norman%20language">Norman language</a>s of <a href="Guern%C3%A9siais">Guernésiais</a>, <a href="J%C3%A8rriais">Jèrriais</a> and <a href="Sarkese">Sarkese</a> spoken in the Channel Islands are similar to French. A <a href="Cant%20%28language%29">cant</a>, called <a href="Shelta">Shelta</a>, is spoken by <a href="Irish%20Traveller">Irish Traveller</a>s, often as a means to conceal meaning from those outside the group. However, English, sometimes in the form of <a href="Scots%20language">Scots</a>, is the dominant language, with few monoglots remaining in the other languages of the region. The <a href="Norn%20language">Norn language</a> of <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a> became extinct around 1880. 

At the end of the last <a href="Pleistocene">ice age</a>, what are now the British Isles were joined to <a href="Continental%20Europe">the European mainland</a> as a mass of land extending north west from the modern-day northern coastline of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Ice covered almost all of what is now Scotland, most of Ireland and Wales, and the hills of northern England. From 14,000 to 10,000 years ago, as the ice melted, sea levels rose separating Ireland from Great Britain and also creating the Isle of Man. About two to four millennia later, Great Britain became separated from the mainland. Britain probably became repopulated with people before the ice age ended and certainly before it became separated from the mainland. It is likely that Ireland became settled by sea after it had already become an island.

At the time of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a>, about two thousand years ago, various tribes, which spoke <a href="Celtic%20languages">Celtic dialects</a> of the <a href="Insular%20Celtic%20languages">Insular Celtic</a> group, were inhabiting the islands. The Romans expanded their civilisation to control southern Great Britain but were impeded in advancing any further, building <a href="Hadrian%27s%20Wall">Hadrian's Wall</a> to mark the northern frontier of their empire in 122 AD. At that time, Ireland was populated by a people known as <a href="Gaels">Hiberni</a>, the northern third or so of Great Britain by a people known as <a href="Picts">Picts</a> and the southern two thirds by <a href="Britons%20%28historical%29">Britons</a>. <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> arrived as <a href="Fall%20of%20Rome">Roman power waned in the 5th century AD</a>. Initially, their arrival seems to have been at the invitation of the Britons as mercenaries to repulse incursions by the Hiberni and Picts. In time, Anglo-Saxon demands on the British became so great that they came to culturally dominate the bulk of southern Great Britain, though recent genetic evidence suggests Britons still formed the bulk of the population. This dominance creating what is now England and leaving culturally British enclaves only in <a href="Hen%20Ogledd">the north of what is now England</a>, in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> and what is now known as Wales. Ireland had been unaffected by the Romans except, significantly, for being <a href="History%20of%20Ireland%20%28400%E2%80%93800%29%23Ecclesiastical%20history">Christianised</a>—traditionally by the Romano-Briton, <a href="Saint%20Patrick">Saint Patrick</a>. As Europe, including Britain, descended into turmoil following the collapse of Roman civilisation, an era known as <a href="Dark%20Ages%20%28historiography%29">the Dark Ages</a>, Ireland entered a <a href="golden%20age">golden age</a> and <a href="Hiberno-Scottish%20mission">responded with missions</a> (first to Great Britain and then to the continent), the founding of <a href="monasteries">monasteries</a> and <a href="universities">universities</a>. These were later joined by <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20mission">Anglo-Saxon mission</a>s of a similar nature.

<a href="Viking">Viking</a> invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements, particularly along the east coast of Ireland, the west coast of modern-day Scotland and the Isle of Man. Though the Vikings were eventually neutralised in Ireland, their influence remained in the cities of <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, <a href="Cork%20%28city%29">Cork</a>, <a href="Limerick">Limerick</a>, <a href="Waterford">Waterford</a> and <a href="Wexford">Wexford</a>. England, however, was slowly conquered around the turn of the first millennium AD, and eventually became a feudal possession of <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>. The relations between the descendants of Vikings in England and counterparts in <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, in northern France, lay at the heart of a series of events that led to the <a href="Normans">Norman</a> <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">conquest of England in 1066</a>. The remnants of the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Normandy">Duchy of Normandy</a>, which conquered England, remain associated to the English Crown as the <a href="Channel%20Islands">Channel Islands</a> to this day. A century later, the marriage of the future <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a> to <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a> created the <a href="Angevin%20Empire">Angevin Empire</a>, partially under the <a href="List%20of%20French%20monarchs">French Crown</a>. At the invitation of <a href="Diarmait%20Mac%20Murchada">Diarmait Mac Murchada</a>, a provincial king, and under <a href="Laudabiliter">the authority of</a> <a href="Pope%20Adrian%20IV">Pope Adrian IV</a> (the only Englishman to be elected pope), the <a href="Norman%20invasion%20of%20Ireland">Angevins invaded Ireland</a> in 1169. Though initially intended to be kept as an independent kingdom, the failure of <a href="Ruaidr%C3%AD%20Ua%20Conchobair">the Irish High King</a> to ensure the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Windsor%20%281175%29">Treaty of Windsor</a> led Henry II, as King of England, to rule as effective monarch under the title of <a href="Lord%20of%20Ireland">Lord of Ireland</a>. This title was granted to his younger son, but when Henry's heir unexpectedly died, the title of <a href="King%20of%20England">King of England</a> and <a href="Lord%20of%20Ireland">Lord of Ireland</a> became entwined in one person.

By the <a href="Late%20Middle%20Ages">Late Middle Ages</a>, Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a>. Power in Ireland fluxed between <a href="Gaelic%20Ireland">Gaelic kingdoms</a>, <a href="Hiberno-Norman">Hiberno-Norman lords</a> and the English-dominated <a href="Lordship%20of%20Ireland">Lordship of Ireland</a>. A similar situation existed in the <a href="Principality%20of%20Wales">Principality of Wales</a>, which was slowly being annexed into the Kingdom of England by a series of laws. During the course of the 15th century, the Crown of England would assert a claim to the Crown of France, thereby also releasing the King of England as from being <a href="vassal">vassal</a> of the <a href="King%20of%20France">King of France</a>. In 1534, King Henry VIII, at first having been a strong defender of Roman Catholicism in the face of the Reformation, separated from the Roman Church after failing to secure a divorce from the Pope. His response was to place the King of England as "the only Supreme Head in Earth of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>", thereby removing the authority of the Pope from the affairs of the English Church. Ireland, which had been held by the King of England as Lord of Ireland, but which strictly speaking had been a feudal possession of the Pope since the Norman invasion was declared <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">a separate kingdom</a> in personal union with England.

Scotland, meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom. In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland <a href="Union%20of%20the%20Crowns">inherited the Crown of England</a>, and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in <a href="Ulster">Ulster</a>. Religious division heightened and the king in England came into conflict with parliament over his tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> or <a href="War%20of%20the%20Three%20Kingdoms">War of the Three Kingdoms</a> led to a <a href="revolutionary%20republic">revolutionary republic</a> in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created a new <a href="Protestant%20Ascendancy">Ascendancy</a> class which obliterated the remnants of Old English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and English, whilst the populace was largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The "<a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a>" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Boyne">Battle of the Boyne</a> and at the militarily crucial <a href="Battle%20of%20Aughrim">Battle of Aughrim</a> in Ireland. Resistance held out, eventually forcing the guarantee of religious tolerance in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Limerick">Treaty of Limerick</a>. However, the terms were never honoured and a new monarchy was installed.

The Kingdoms of England and Scotland were <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201707">unified in 1707</a> creating the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>. Following an attempted republican <a href="1798%20Rebellion">revolution in Ireland in 1798</a>, the Kingdoms of Ireland and Great Britain were <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201800">unified in 1801</a>, creating the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a>. The Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining outside of the United Kingdom but with their ultimate good governance being the responsibility of the British Crown (effectively the British government). Although, the colonies of North America that would become the United States of America were lost by the start of the 19th century, the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> expanded rapidly elsewhere. A century later it would cover one third of the globe. Poverty in the United Kingdom remained desperate, however, and industrialisation in England led to terrible condition for the working classes. Mass migrations following the <a href="Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29">Irish Famine</a> and <a href="Highland%20Clearances">Highland Clearances</a> resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century. Most of Ireland seceded from the United Kingdom after the <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish War of Independence</a> and the subsequent <a href="Anglo-Irish%20Treaty">Anglo-Irish Treaty</a> (1919–1922), with the six counties that formed <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> remaining as an autonomous region of the UK.

There are two <a href="sovereign%20states">sovereign states</a> in the isles: <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> and the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Northern%20Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</a>. Ireland, sometimes called "the Republic of Ireland", governs five sixths of the island of Ireland, with the remainder of the island forming <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>. Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, usually shortened to simply "the United Kingdom", which governs the remainder of the archipelago with the exception of the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> and the <a href="Channel%20Islands">Channel Islands</a>. The Isle of Man and the two states of the Channel Islands, <a href="Jersey">Jersey</a> and <a href="Bailiwick%20of%20Guernsey">Guernsey</a>, are known as the <a href="Crown%20Dependencies">Crown Dependencies</a>. They exercise constitutional rights of self-government and judicial independence; responsibility for international representation rests largely upon the UK (in consultation with the respective governments); and responsibility for defence is reserved by the UK. The United Kingdom is made up of four <a href="Counties%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">constituent parts</a>: England, Scotland and Wales, forming Great Britain, and <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> in the north-east of the island of Ireland. Of these, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have "<a href="Devolution">devolved</a>" governments, meaning that each has its own parliament or assembly and is self-governing with respect to certain areas set down by law. For <a href="judicial">judicial</a> purposes, Scotland, Northern Ireland and <a href="English%20law">England and Wales</a> (the latter being one entity) form separate legal jurisdiction, with there being no single law for the UK as a whole.

Ireland, the United Kingdom and the three Crown Dependencies are all <a href="parliamentary%20democracies">parliamentary democracies</a>, with their own separate parliaments. All parts of the United Kingdom return <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">members</a> to <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">parliament in London</a>. In addition to this, voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland return members to a <a href="Scottish%20Parliament">parliament in Edinburgh</a> and to assemblies in <a href="National%20Assembly%20for%20Wales">Cardiff</a> and <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20Assembly">Belfast</a> respectively. Governance in the norm is by majority rule, however, Northern Ireland uses a system of <a href="Consociationalism">power sharing</a> whereby <a href="Unionism%20in%20Ireland">unionists</a> and <a href="Irish%20nationalist">nationalists</a> share executive posts proportionately and where the assent of both groups are required for the <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20Assembly">Northern Ireland Assembly</a> to make certain decisions. (In the context of Northern Ireland, unionists are those who want Northern Ireland to remain a part of the United Kingdom and nationalists are those who want Northern Ireland to join with the rest of Ireland.) The <a href="British%20monarch">British monarch</a> is the head of state of the United Kingdom, while in the Republic of Ireland the head of state is the <a href="President%20of%20Ireland">President of Ireland</a>.

Ireland and the United Kingdom are both part of the European Union (EU). The Crown Dependencies are not a part of the EU, but do participate in certain aspects that were negotiated as a part of the UK's accession to the EU. Neither the United Kingdom or Ireland are part of the <a href="Schengen%20area">Schengen area</a>, that allow passport-free travel between EU members states. However, since the <a href="partition%20of%20Ireland">partition of Ireland</a>, an informal free-travel area had existed across the region. This area required formal recognition in 1997 during the course of negotiations for the <a href="Amsterdam%20Treaty">Amsterdam Treaty</a> of the European Union, and is now known as the <a href="Common%20Travel%20Area">Common Travel Area</a>.

Reciprocal arrangements allow British and Irish citizens full voting rights in the two states. Exceptions to this are presidential elections and <a href="Amendments%20to%20the%20Constitution%20of%20Ireland">constitutional referendums</a> in the Republic of Ireland, for which there is no comparable franchise in the other states. In the United Kingdom, these pre-date European Union law, and in both jurisdictions go further than that required by European Union law. Other EU nationals may only vote in local and European Parliament elections while resident in either the UK or Ireland. In 2008, a <a href="Ministry%20of%20Justice%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">UK Ministry of Justice</a> report investigating how to strengthen the British sense of citizenship proposed to end this arrangement, arguing that "the right to vote is one of the hallmarks of the political status of citizens; it is not a means of expressing closeness between countries".

In addition, some civil bodies are organised throughout the islands as a whole—for example the <a href="Samaritans%20%28charity%29">Samaritans</a>, which is deliberately organised without regard to national boundaries on the basis that a service which is not political or religious should not recognise sectarian or political divisions. The <a href="Royal%20National%20Lifeboat%20Institution">Royal National Lifeboat Institution</a> (RNLI), a charity that operates a lifeboat service, is also organised throughout the islands as a whole, covering the waters of the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands.

The <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20Peace%20Process">Northern Ireland Peace Process</a> has led to a number of unusual arrangements between the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. For example, citizens of Northern Ireland are entitled to the choice of Irish or British citizenship or both and the Governments of <a href="Government%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a> and the <a href="Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> consult on matters not devolved to the <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20Executive">Northern Ireland Executive</a>. The <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20Executive">Northern Ireland Executive</a> and the <a href="Government%20of%20Ireland">Government of Ireland</a> also meet as the <a href="North/South%20Ministerial%20Council">North/South Ministerial Council</a> to develop policies common across the island of Ireland. These arrangements were made following the 1998 <a href="Good%20Friday%20Agreement">Good Friday Agreement</a>.

Another body established under the Good Friday Agreement, the British–Irish Council, is made up of all of the states and territories of the British Isles. The <a href="British%E2%80%93Irish%20Parliamentary%20Assembly">British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly</a> () predates the British–Irish Council and was established in 1990. Originally it comprised 25 members of the <a href="Oireachtas">Oireachtas</a>, the Irish parliament, and 25 members of the <a href="parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">parliament of the United Kingdom</a>, with the purpose of building mutual understanding between members of both legislatures. Since then the role and scope of the body has been expanded to include representatives from the <a href="Scottish%20Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a>, the <a href="National%20Assembly%20for%20Wales">National Assembly for Wales</a>, the <a href="Northern%20Ireland%20Assembly">Northern Ireland Assembly</a>, the <a href="States%20of%20Jersey">States of Jersey</a>, the <a href="States%20of%20Guernsey">States of Guernsey</a> and the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Tynwald">High Court of Tynwald</a> (Isle of Man).

The Council does not have executive powers, but meets biannually to discuss issues of mutual importance. Similarly, the Parliamentary Assembly has no legislative powers but investigates and collects witness evidence from the public on matters of mutual concern to its members. Reports on its findings are presented to the Governments of Ireland and the United Kingdom. During the February 2008 meeting of the British–Irish Council, it was agreed to set up a standing secretariat that would serve as a permanent 'civil service' for the Council. Leading on from developments in the British–Irish Council, the chair of the British–Irish Inter-Parliamentary Assembly, <a href="Niall%20Blaney">Niall Blaney</a>, has suggested that the body should shadow the British–Irish Council's work.

The United Kingdom and Ireland have separate media, although British television, newspapers and magazines are widely available in Ireland, giving people in Ireland a high level of familiarity with cultural matters in the United Kingdom. Irish newspapers are also available in the UK, and Irish state and private television is widely available in Northern Ireland. Certain reality TV shows have embraced the whole of the islands, for example "<a href="The%20X%20Factor%20%28UK%29">The X Factor</a>", seasons 3, 4 and 7 of which featured auditions in Dublin and were open to Irish voters, whilst the show previously known as "Britain's Next Top Model" became "<a href="Britain%20and%20Ireland%27s%20Next%20Top%20Model">Britain and Ireland's Next Top Model</a>" in 2011. A few cultural events are organised for the island group as a whole. For example, the <a href="Costa%20Book%20Awards">Costa Book Awards</a> are awarded to authors resident in the UK or Ireland. The <a href="Mercury%20Music%20Prize">Mercury Music Prize</a> is handed out every year to the best album from a British or Irish musician or group.

Many globally popular sports had modern rules codified in the British Isles, including <a href="History%20of%20golf">golf</a>, <a href="History%20of%20association%20football">association football</a>, <a href="History%20of%20cricket">cricket</a>, <a href="Rugby%20football">rugby</a>, <a href="History%20of%20snooker">snooker</a> and <a href="darts">darts</a>, as well as many minor sports such as <a href="croquet">croquet</a>, <a href="bowls">bowls</a>, <a href="pitch%20and%20putt">pitch and putt</a>, <a href="History%20of%20water%20polo">water polo</a> and <a href="Gaelic%20handball">handball</a>. A number of sports are popular throughout the British Isles, the most prominent of which is <a href="association%20football">association football</a>. While this is organised separately in different national associations, leagues and national teams, even within the UK, it is a common passion in all parts of the islands. <a href="Rugby%20union">Rugby union</a> is also widely enjoyed across the islands with four national teams from <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a>, <a href="Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Ireland</a>, <a href="Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Scotland</a> and <a href="Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Wales</a>. The <a href="British%20and%20Irish%20Lions">British and Irish Lions</a> is a team chosen from each national team and undertakes tours of the <a href="southern%20hemisphere">southern hemisphere</a> rugby playing nations every four years. Ireland play as a united team, represented by players from both Northern Ireland and the Republic. These national rugby teams play each other each year for the <a href="Triple%20Crown%20%28Rugby%20Union%29">Triple Crown</a> as part of the <a href="Six%20Nations%20Championship">Six Nations Championship</a>. Also, since 2001, the professional club teams of Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Italy compete against each other in the <a href="Pro14">Pro14</a>.

The <a href="Ryder%20Cup">Ryder Cup</a> in <a href="golf">golf</a> was originally played between a United States team and a team representing Great Britain and Ireland. From 1979 onwards this was expanded to include the whole of Europe.

<a href="London%20Heathrow%20Airport">London Heathrow Airport</a> is Europe's busiest <a href="airport">airport</a> in terms of passenger traffic and the Dublin-London route was once the busiest air route in Europe, and it remains the <a href="World%27s%20busiest%20passenger%20air%20routes%23Europe">busiest route</a> out of Heathrow. The <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> and the southern <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> are the busiest seaways in the world. The <a href="Channel%20Tunnel">Channel Tunnel</a>, opened in 1994, links Great Britain to France and is the second-longest rail tunnel in the world.

The idea of building a <a href="Irish%20Sea%20tunnel">tunnel under the Irish Sea</a> has been raised since 1895, when it was first investigated. Several potential Irish Sea tunnel projects have been proposed, most recently the "Tusker Tunnel" between the ports of <a href="Rosslare%20Europort">Rosslare</a> and <a href="Fishguard">Fishguard</a> proposed by <a href="The%20Institute%20of%20Engineers%20of%20Ireland">The Institute of Engineers of Ireland</a> in 2004. A rail tunnel was proposed in 1997 on a different route, between <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> and <a href="Holyhead">Holyhead</a>, by British engineering firm Symonds. Either tunnel, at , would be by far the longest in the world, and would cost an estimated £15 billion or €20 billion. A proposal in 2007, estimated the cost of building a bridge from <a href="County%20Antrim">County Antrim</a> in Northern Ireland to <a href="Galloway">Galloway</a> in Scotland at £3.5bn (€5bn).

Basque language

Basque ( or ; Basque: , ) is the language spoken in the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29">Basque country</a>. Linguistically, Basque is unrelated to the other languages of Europe and indeed, as a <a href="language%20isolate">language isolate</a>, to any other known living language. The Basques are indigenous to, and primarily inhabit, the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29">Basque Country</a>, a region that straddles the westernmost <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> in adjacent parts of northern <a href="Spain">Spain</a> and southwestern <a href="France">France</a>. The Basque language is spoken by 28.4% of Basques in all territories (751,500). Of these, 93.2% (700,300) are in the Spanish area of the Basque Country and the remaining 6.8% (51,200) are in the French portion.

Native speakers live in a contiguous area that includes parts of four Spanish provinces and the <a href="French%20Basque%20Country">three "ancient provinces"</a> in France. <a href="Gipuzkoa">Gipuzkoa</a>, most of <a href="Biscay">Biscay</a>, a few municipalities of <a href="%C3%81lava">Álava</a>, and the northern area of <a href="Navarre">Navarre</a> formed the core of the remaining Basque-speaking area before measures were introduced in the 1980s to strengthen the language. By contrast, most of Álava, the western part of Biscay and central and southern areas of Navarre are predominantly populated by native speakers of Spanish, either because Basque <a href="Language%20shift">was replaced</a> by Spanish over the centuries, in some areas (most of Álava and central Navarre), or because it was possibly never spoken there, in other areas (<a href="Enkarterri">Enkarterri</a> and southeastern Navarre).

Under <a href="Restoration%20%28Spain%29">Restorationist</a> and <a href="Francoist%20Spain">Francoist Spain</a>, public use of Basque was frowned upon, often regarded as a sign of <a href="separatism">separatism</a>; this applied especially to those regions that did not support Franco's uprising (such as Biscay or Gipuzkoa). However, in those Basque-speaking regions that supported the uprising (such as Navarre or Álava) the Basque language was more than merely tolerated. Overall, in the 1960s and later, the trend reversed and education and publishing in Basque began to flourish. As a part of this process, a standardized form of the Basque language, called <a href="Standard%20Basque">Euskara Batua</a>, was developed by the <a href="Euskaltzaindia">Euskaltzaindia</a> in the late 1960s.

Besides its standardised version, the five historic Basque dialects are <a href="Biscayan%20dialect">Biscayan</a>, <a href="Gipuzkoan%20dialect">Gipuzkoan</a>, and <a href="Eastern%20Navarrese%20dialect">Upper Navarrese</a> in Spain, and <a href="Navarro-Lapurdian%20dialect">Navarrese–Lapurdian</a> and <a href="Souletin%20dialect">Souletin</a> in France. They take their names from the historic Basque provinces, but the dialect boundaries are not congruent with province boundaries. Euskara Batua was created so that Basque language could be used—and easily understood by all Basque speakers—in formal situations (education, mass media, literature), and this is its main use today. In both Spain and France, the use of Basque for education varies from region to region and from school to school.

A language isolate, Basque is believed to be one of the few surviving <a href="pre-Indo-European%20languages">pre-Indo-European languages</a> in Europe, and the only one in Western Europe. The <a href="origin%20of%20the%20Basques">origin of the Basques</a> and their languages are not conclusively known, though the most accepted current theory is that early forms of Basque developed prior to the arrival of <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European languages</a> in the area, including the <a href="Romance%20languages">Romance languages</a> that geographically surround the Basque-speaking region. Basque has adopted a good deal of its vocabulary from the Romance languages, and Basque speakers have in turn lent their own words to Romance speakers.

The <a href="Basque%20alphabet">Basque alphabet</a> uses the <a href="Latin%20script">Latin script</a>.

In Basque, the name of the language is officially "Euskara" (alongside various <a href="Basque%20dialects%23Dialectal%20divergence">dialect</a> forms). Three etymological theories of the name "Euskara" are taken seriously by linguists and <a href="wikt%3AVasconist">Vasconists</a>.

In French, the language is normally called "basque", though in recent times "euskara" has become common. Spanish has a greater variety of names for the language. Today, it is most commonly referred to as "el vasco", "la lengua vasca", or "el euskera". Both terms, "vasco" and "basque", are inherited from Latin <a href="ethnonym">ethnonym</a> "<a href="Vascones">Vascones</a>", which in turn goes back to the Greek term οὐασκώνους ("ouaskōnous"), an ethnonym used by <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> in his "<a href="Geographica">Geographica</a>" (23 CE, Book III).

The Spanish term "Vascuence", derived from Latin "vasconĭce", has acquired negative connotations over the centuries and is not well-liked amongst Basque speakers generally. Its use is documented at least as far back as the 14th century when a law passed in <a href="Huesca">Huesca</a> in 1349 stated that "Item nuyl corridor nonsia usado que faga mercadería ninguna que compre nin venda entre ningunas personas, faulando en algaravia nin en abraych nin en basquenç: et qui lo fara pague por coto XXX sol"—essentially penalizing the use of Arabic, Hebrew, or Basque in marketplaces with a fine of 30 <a href="Solidus%20%28coin%29">sols</a> (the equivalent of 30 sheep).

Basque is geographically surrounded by <a href="Romance%20languages">Romance languages</a> but is a <a href="language%20isolate">language isolate</a> unrelated to them. It is the last remaining descendant of one of the <a href="pre-Indo-European%20languages">pre-Indo-European languages</a> of Western Europe, the others being extinct outright. Consequently, its prehistory may not be reconstructible by means of the traditional <a href="comparative%20method%20%28linguistics%29">comparative method</a> except by applying it to differences between dialects within the language. Little is known of its origins, but an early form of the Basque language likely was present in Western Europe before the arrival of the Indo-European languages to the area.

Authors such as <a href="Miguel%20de%20Unamuno">Miguel de Unamuno</a> and <a href="Louis%20Lucien%20Bonaparte">Louis Lucien Bonaparte</a> have noted that the words for "knife" ("aizto"), "axe" ("aizkora"), and "hoe" ("aitzur") derive from the word for "stone" ("haitz"), and have therefore concluded that the language dates to <a href="prehistoric%20Europe">prehistoric Europe</a> when those tools were made of stone. Others find this unlikely: see <a href="Origin%20of%20the%20Basques%23The%20aizkora%20controversy">the "aizkora" controversy</a>.

Latin inscriptions in <a href="Gallia%20Aquitania">Gallia Aquitania</a> preserve a number of words with <a href="cognate">cognate</a>s in the reconstructed <a href="proto-Basque%20language">proto-Basque language</a>, for instance, the personal names "Nescato" and "Cison" ("neskato" and "gizon" mean "young girl" and "man", respectively in modern Basque). This language is generally referred to as <a href="Aquitanian%20language">Aquitanian</a> and is assumed to have been spoken in the area before the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a>'s conquests in the western <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>. Some authors even argue for <a href="late%20Basquisation">late Basquisation</a>, that the language moved westward during <a href="Late%20Antiquity">Late Antiquity</a> after the <a href="fall%20of%20the%20Western%20Roman%20Empire%20">fall of the Western Roman Empire </a> into the northern part of <a href="Hispania">Hispania</a> into what is now <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29">Basque Country</a>.

Roman neglect of this area allowed Aquitanian to survive while the <a href="Iberian%20language">Iberian</a> and <a href="Tartessian%20language">Tartessian language</a>s became extinct. Through the long contact with Romance languages, Basque adopted a sizable number of Romance words. Initially the source was Latin, later <a href="Gascon%20language">Gascon</a> (a branch of <a href="Occitan%20language">Occitan</a>) in the northeast, <a href="Navarro-Aragonese">Navarro-Aragonese</a> in the southeast and <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> in the southwest.

The statistical improbability and chronological difficulty of linking Basque with its Indo-European neighbors in Europe has inspired many scholars to search for its possible relatives elsewhere. Besides many <a href="pseudoscientific%20language%20comparison">pseudoscientific comparisons</a>, the appearance of long-range linguistics gave rise to several attempts to connect Basque with geographically very distant language families. Almost all hypotheses on the origin of Basque are controversial, and the suggested evidence is not generally accepted by most linguists. Some of these hypothetical connections are:

The region where Basque is spoken has become smaller over centuries, especially at the northern, southern, and eastern borders. Nothing is known about the limits of this region in ancient times, but on the basis of toponyms and epigraphs, it seems that in the beginning of the <a href="Common%20Era">Common Era</a> it stretched to the river <a href="Garonne">Garonne</a> in the north (including the southwestern part of present-day <a href="France">France</a>); at least to the <a href="Val%20d%27Aran">Val d'Aran</a> in the east (now a <a href="Gascon%20language">Gascon</a>-speaking part of <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>), including lands on both sides of the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>; the southern and western boundaries are not clear at all.

The <a href="Reconquista">Reconquista</a> temporarily counteracted this contracting tendency when the Christian lords called on Northern Iberian peoples—Basques, <a href="Asturians">Asturians</a>, and "<a href="Franks">Franks</a>"—to colonize the new conquests. The Basque language became the main everyday language, while other languages like <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, <a href="Gascon%20language">Gascon</a>, <a href="French%20language">French</a>, or <a href="Latin">Latin</a> were preferred for the administration and high education.

By the 16th century, the Basque-speaking area was reduced basically to the present-day seven provinces of the Basque Country, excluding the southern part of Navarre, the southwestern part of <a href="%C3%81lava">Álava</a>, and the western part of Biscay, and including some parts of <a href="B%C3%A9arn">Béarn</a>.

In 1807, Basque was still spoken in the northern half of Álava—including its capital city <a href="Vitoria-Gasteiz">Vitoria-Gasteiz</a>—and a vast area in central Navarre, but in these two provinces, Basque experienced a rapid decline that pushed its border northwards. In the <a href="French%20Basque%20Country">French Basque Country</a>, Basque was still spoken in all the territory except in <a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a> and some villages around, and including some bordering towns in <a href="B%C3%A9arn">Béarn</a>.

In the 20th century, however, the rise of <a href="Basque%20nationalism">Basque nationalism</a> spurred increased interest in the language as a sign of ethnic identity, and with the establishment of autonomous governments in the <a href="Southern%20Basque%20Country">Southern Basque Country</a>, it has recently made a modest comeback. In the Spanish part, Basque-language schools for children and Basque-teaching centres for adults have brought the language to areas such as <a href="Enkarterri">Enkarterri</a> and the <a href="Ribera%20d%27Ebre">Ribera d'Ebre</a> in Navarre, where it is not known if it has ever been spoken before; and in the French Basque Country, these schools and centres have almost stopped the decline of the language.

Historically, Latin or Romance languages have been the official languages in this region. However, Basque was explicitly recognized in some areas. For instance, the "<a href="fuero">fuero</a>" or charter of the Basque-colonized <a href="Ojacastro">Ojacastro</a> (now in <a href="La%20Rioja%20%28Spain%29">La Rioja</a>) allowed the inhabitants to use Basque in legal processes in the <a href="13th%20century">13th</a> and <a href="14th%20century">14th</a> centuries.

The <a href="Spanish%20Constitution%20of%201978">Spanish Constitution of 1978</a> states in Article 3 that the <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish language</a> is the official language, but allows autonomous communities to provide a co-official language status for the other <a href="languages%20of%20Spain">languages of Spain</a>. Consequently, the Statute of Autonomy of the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28autonomous%20community%29">Basque Autonomous Community</a> establishes Basque as the co-official language of the autonomous community. The Statute of Navarre establishes Spanish as the official language of Navarre, but grants co-official status to the Basque language in the Basque-speaking areas of northern Navarre. Basque has no official status in the French Basque Country and French citizens are barred from officially using Basque in a French court of law. However, the use of Basque by Spanish nationals in French courts is permitted (with translation), as Basque is officially recognized on the other side of the border.

The positions of the various existing governments differ with regard to the promotion of Basque in areas where Basque is commonly spoken. The language has official status in those territories that are within the Basque Autonomous Community, where it is spoken and promoted heavily, but only partially in Navarre. The "Ley del Vascuence" ("Law of Basque"), seen as contentious by many Basques, but considered fitting Navarra's linguistic and cultural diversity by the main political parties of Navarre, divides Navarre into three language areas: Basque-speaking, non-Basque-speaking, and mixed. Support for the language and the linguistic rights of citizens vary, depending on the area.

The 2006 sociolinguistic survey of all Basque-speaking territories showed that in 2006, of all people aged 16 and above:

Taken together, in 2006, of a total population of 2,589,600 (1,850,500 in the Autonomous Community, 230,200 in the Northern Provinces and 508,900 in Navarre), 665,800 spoke Basque (aged 16 and above). This amounts to 25.7% Basque bilinguals overall, 15.4% passive speakers, and 58.9% non-speakers. Compared to the 1991 figures, this represents an overall increase of 137,000, from 528,500 (from a population of 2,371,100) 15 years previously.

The 2011 figures show an increase of some 64,000 speakers compared to the 2006 figures to 714,136, with significant increases in the Autonomous Community, but a slight drop in the Northern Basque Country to 51,100, overall amounting to an increase to 27% of all inhabitants of Basque provinces (2,648,998 in total).

Basque is used as a language of commerce both in the Basque Country and in locations around the world where Basques immigrated throughout history.

The modern Basque dialects show a high degree of dialectal divergence, sometimes making cross-dialect communication difficult. This is especially true in the case of Biscayan and Souletin, which are regarded as the most divergent Basque dialects.

Modern Basque dialectology distinguishes five dialects:

These dialects are divided in 11 subdialects, and 24 minor varieties among them.
According to Koldo Zuazo (“Euskalkiak. Herriaren lekukoak”. Elkar, 2004), the Biscayan dialect or "Western" is the most widespread dialect, with around 300,000 speakers out of a total of around 660,000 speakers. This dialect is divided in two minor subdialects: the Western Biscayan and Eastern Biscayan, plus transitional dialects.

Although the influence of the neighbouring <a href="Romance%20languages">Romance languages</a> on the Basque language (especially the lexicon, but also to some degree Basque phonology and grammar) has been much more extensive, it is usually assumed that there has been some feedback from Basque into these languages as well. In particular <a href="Gascon%20language">Gascon</a> and <a href="Aragonese%20language">Aragonese</a>, and to a lesser degree <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> are thought to have received this influence in the past. In the case of Aragonese and Gascon, this would have been through <a href="Substratum">substrate</a> interference following <a href="language%20shift">language shift</a> from <a href="Aquitanian%20language">Aquitanian</a> or Basque to a Romance language, affecting all levels of the language, including place names around the Pyrenees.

Although a number of words of alleged Basque origin in the Spanish language are circulated (e.g. "anchoa" 'anchovies', "bizarro" 'dashing, gallant, spirited', "cachorro" 'puppy', etc.), most of these have more easily explicable Romance etymologies or not particularly convincing derivations from Basque. Ignoring cultural terms, there is one strong <a href="loanword">loanword</a> candidate, "ezker", long considered the source of the Pyrennean and <a href="Iberian%20Romance">Iberian Romance</a> words for "left (side)" (', ', ""). The lack of initial in Gascon could arguably be due to a Basque influence but this issue is under-researched.

The other most commonly claimed substrate influences:

The first two features are common, widespread developments in many Romance (and non-Romance) languages. The change of /f/ to /h/ occurred historically only in a limited area (<a href="Gascony">Gascony</a> and <a href="Old%20Castile">Old Castile</a>) that corresponds almost exactly to areas where heavy Basque bilingualism is assumed, and as a result has been widely postulated (and equally strongly disputed). Substrate theories are often difficult to prove (especially in the case of phonetically plausible changes like /f/ to /h/). As a result, although many arguments have been made on both sides, the debate largely comes down to the a priori tendency on the part of particular linguists to accept or reject substrate arguments.

Examples of arguments against the substrate theory, and possible responses:

Beyond these arguments, a number of <a href="nomadic">nomadic</a> groups of Castile are also said to use or have used Basque words in their jargon, such as the <a href="gacer%C3%ADa">gacería</a> in <a href="Segovia%20%28province%29">Segovia</a>, the <a href="minga%C3%B1a">mingaña</a>, the Galician <a href="fala%20dos%20arxinas">fala dos arxinas</a> and the <a href="Asturias">Asturian</a> <a href="X%C3%ADriga">Xíriga</a>.

Part of the <a href="Romani%20people">Romani</a> community in the Basque Country speaks <a href="Erromintxela%20language">Erromintxela</a>, which is a rare <a href="mixed%20language">mixed language</a>, with a <a href="Kalderash">Kalderash</a> <a href="Romani%20language">Romani</a> vocabulary and Basque grammar.

A number of Basque-based or Basque-influenced <a href="pidgin">pidgin</a>s have existed. In the 16th century, Basque sailors used a <a href="Basque%E2%80%93Icelandic%20pidgin">Basque–Icelandic pidgin</a> in their contacts with Iceland. The <a href="Algonquian%E2%80%93Basque%20pidgin">Algonquian–Basque pidgin</a> arose from contact between Basque <a href="whaling">whalers</a> and the <a href="Algonquian%20peoples">Algonquian peoples</a> in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Saint%20Lawrence">Gulf of Saint Lawrence</a> and <a href="Strait%20of%20Belle%20Isle">Strait of Belle Isle</a>.

Basque is an <a href="ergative%E2%80%93absolutive%20language">ergative–absolutive language</a>. The subject of an <a href="intransitive%20verb">intransitive verb</a> is in the <a href="absolutive%20case">absolutive case</a> (which is unmarked), and the same case is used for the <a href="direct%20object">direct object</a> of a <a href="transitive%20verb">transitive verb</a>. The subject of the transitive verb is marked differently, with the <a href="ergative%20case">ergative case</a> (shown by the suffix "-k"). This also triggers main and auxiliary verbal agreement.

The <a href="auxiliary%20verb">auxiliary verb</a>, which accompanies most main verbs, agrees not only with the subject, but with any direct object and the indirect object present. Among European languages, this <a href="polypersonal%20agreement">polypersonal agreement</a> is found only in Basque, some <a href="languages%20of%20the%20Caucasus">languages of the Caucasus</a>, <a href="Mordvinic%20languages">Mordvinic languages</a>, <a href="Hungarian%20language">Hungarian</a>, and <a href="Maltese%20language">Maltese</a> (all non-Indo-European). The ergative–absolutive alignment is also rare among European languages—occurring only in some languages of the Caucasus—but not infrequent worldwide.

Consider the phrase:

"Martin-ek" is the agent (transitive subject), so it is marked with the ergative case ending "-k" (with an <a href="epenthesis">epenthetic</a> "-e-"). "Egunkariak" has an "-ak" ending, which marks plural object (plural absolutive, direct object case). The verb is "erosten dizkit", in which "erosten" is a kind of gerund ("buying") and the auxiliary "dizkit" means "he/she (does) them for me". This "dizkit" can be split like this:

The phrase "you buy the newspapers for me" would translate as:

The auxiliary verb is composed as di-zki-da-zue and means 'you pl. (do) them for me'

The pronoun "zuek" ("you", plural) has the same form both in the nominative or absolutive case (the subject of an intransitive sentence or direct object of a transitive sentence) and in the ergative case (the subject of a transitive sentence). In spoken Basque, the auxiliary verb is never dropped even if it is redundant: "Zuek niri egunkariak erosten dizkidazue", you pl. buying the newspapers for me. However, the pronouns are almost always dropped: "egunkariak erosten dizkidazue", the newspapers buying be-them-for-me-you(plural). The pronouns are used only to show emphasis: "egunkariak zuek erosten dizkidazue", it is you (pl.) who buys the newspapers for me; or "egunkariak niri erosten dizkidazue", it is me for whom you buy the newspapers.

Modern Basque dialects allow for the conjugation of about fifteen verbs, called synthetic verbs, some only in literary contexts. These can be put in the present and past tenses in the indicative and subjunctive moods, in three tenses in the conditional and potential moods, and in one tense in the imperative. Each verb that can be taken intransitively has a "nor" (absolutive) paradigm and possibly a "nor-nori" (absolutive–dative) paradigm, as in the sentence "Aititeri txapela erori zaio" ("The hat fell from grandfather['s head]"). Each verb that can be taken transitively uses those two paradigms for antipassive-voice contexts in which no agent is mentioned (notice that Basque lacks a passive voice, and displays instead an <a href="antipassive%20voice">antipassive voice</a> paradigm), and also has a "nor-nork" (absolutive–ergative) paradigm and possibly a "nor-nori-nork" (absolutive–dative–ergative) paradigm. The last would entail the "dizkidazue" example above. In each paradigm, each constituent noun can take on any of eight persons, five singular and three plural, with the exception of "nor-nori-nork" in which the absolutive can only be third person singular or plural. (This draws on a language universal: *"Yesterday the boss presented the committee me" sounds at least odd, if not incorrect.) The most ubiquitous auxiliary, "izan," can be used in any of these paradigms, depending on the nature of the main verb.

There are more persons in the singular (5) than in the <a href="plural">plural</a> (3) for synthetic (or filamentous) verbs because of the two familiar persons—<a href="T%E2%80%93V%20distinction">informal</a> masculine and feminine second person singular. The pronoun "hi" is used for both of them, but where the masculine form of the verb uses a "-k", the feminine uses an "-n." This is a property rarely found in Indo-European languages. The entire paradigm of the verb is further augmented by inflecting for "listener" (the <a href="allocutive">allocutive</a>) even if the verb contains no second person constituent. If the situation calls for the familiar masculine, the form is augmented and modified accordingly. Likewise for the familiar feminine.
Notice that this nearly multiplies the number of possible forms by three. Still, the restriction on contexts in which these forms may be used is strong, since all participants in the conversation must be friends of the same sex, and not too far apart in age. Some dialects dispense with the familiar forms entirely. Note, however, that the formal second person singular conjugates in parallel to the other plural forms, perhaps indicating that it was originally the second person plural, later came to be used as a formal singular, and then later still the modern second person plural was formulated as an innovation.

All the other verbs in Basque are called periphrastic, behaving much like a participle would in English. These have only three forms in total, called <a href="Grammatical%20aspect">aspects</a>: perfect (various suffixes), habitual (suffix "-t[z]en"), and future/potential (suffix. "-ko/-go"). Verbs of Latinate origin in Basque, as well as many other verbs, have a suffix "-tu" in the perfect, adapted from the Latin perfect passive "-tus" suffix. The synthetic verbs also have periphrastic forms, for use in perfects and in simple tenses in which they are deponent.

Within a verb phrase, the periphrastic verb comes first, followed by the auxiliary.

A Basque noun-phrase is inflected in 17 different ways for case, multiplied by 4 ways for its definiteness and number (indefinite, definite singular, definite plural, and definite close plural: "euskaldun" [Basque speaker], "euskalduna" [the Basque speaker, a Basque speaker], "euskaldunak" [Basque speakers, the Basque speakers], and "euskaldunok" [we Basque speakers, those Basque speakers]). These first 68 forms are further modified based on other parts of the sentence, which in turn are inflected for the noun again. It has been estimated that, with two levels of <a href="recursion">recursion</a>, a Basque noun may have 458,683 inflected forms.

Within a noun phrase, modifying adjectives follow the noun. As an example of a Basque noun phrase, "etxe zaharrean" "in the old house" is morphologically analysed as follows by Agirre et al.

Basic syntactic construction is <a href="subject%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93verb">subject–object–verb</a> (unlike Spanish, French or English where a <a href="subject%E2%80%93verb%E2%80%93object">subject–verb–object</a> construction is more common). The order of the phrases within a sentence can be changed with thematic purposes, whereas the order of the words within a phrase is usually rigid. As a matter of fact, Basque phrase order is topic–focus, meaning that in neutral sentences (such as sentences to inform someone of a fact or event) the <a href="Topic%20%28linguistics%29">topic</a> is stated first, then the <a href="Focus%20%28linguistics%29">focus</a>. In such sentences, the verb phrase comes at the end. In brief, the focus directly precedes the verb phrase. This rule is also applied in questions, for instance, "What is this?" can be translated as "Zer da hau?" or "Hau zer da?", but in both cases the question tag "zer" immediately precedes the verb "da". This rule is so important in Basque that, even in grammatical descriptions of Basque in other languages, the Basque word "galdegai" (focus) is used.

In negative sentences, the order changes. Since the negative particle "ez" must always directly precede the auxiliary, the topic most often comes beforehand, and the rest of the sentence follows. This includes the periphrastic, if there is one: "Aitak frantsesa irakasten du," "Father teaches French," in the negative becomes "Aitak ez du frantsesa irakasten," in which "irakasten" ("teaching") is separated from its auxiliary and placed at the end.

The Basque language features five vowels: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/ (the same that are found in <a href="Spanish%20phonology%23Vowels">Spanish</a>, <a href="Asturian%20language%23Vowels">Asturian</a> and <a href="Aragonese%20language%23Vowels">Aragonese</a>). In the <a href="Zuberoan">Zuberoan</a> dialect, extra phonemes are featured:

Basque has a distinction between <a href="laminal%20consonant">laminal</a> and <a href="Apical%20consonant">apical</a> articulation for the alveolar fricatives and affricates. With the laminal alveolar fricative , the friction occurs across the blade of the tongue, the tongue tip pointing toward the lower teeth. This is the usual in most European languages. It is written with an orthographic . By contrast, the <a href="voiceless%20apicoalveolar%20fricative">voiceless apicoalveolar fricative</a> is written ; the tip of the tongue points toward the upper teeth and friction occurs at the tip (apex). For example, "zu" "you" (singular, respectful) is distinguished from "su" "fire". The affricate counterparts are written and . So, "etzi" "the day after tomorrow" is distinguished from "etsi" "to give up"; "atzo" "yesterday" is distinguished from "atso" "old woman".

In the westernmost parts of the Basque country, only the apical and the alveolar affricate are used.

Basque also features postalveolar sibilants (, written , and , written ), sounding like English "sh" and "ch".

There are two palatal stops, voiced and unvoiced, as well as a palatal nasal and a palatal lateral (the palatal stops are not present in all dialects). These and the postalveolar sounds are typical of diminutives, which are used frequently in child language and <a href="motherese">motherese</a> (mainly to show affection rather than size). For example, "tanta" "drop" vs. "ttantta" "droplet". A few common words, such as "txakur" "dog", use palatal sounds even though in current usage they have lost the diminutive sense; the corresponding non-palatal forms now acquiring an augmentative or pejorative sense: "zakur"—"big dog". Many Basque dialects exhibit a derived palatalization effect, in which coronal onset consonants change into the palatal counterpart after the high front vowel . For example, the in "egin" "to act" becomes palatal in southern and western dialects when a suffix beginning with a vowel is added: = "the action", = "doing".
The letter has a variety of realizations according to the regional dialect: , as pronounced from west to east in south Bizkaia and coastal Lapurdi, central Bizkaia, east Bizkaia and Gipuzkoa, south Navarre, inland Lapurdi and Low Navarre, and Zuberoa, respectively.

The letter is silent in the Southern dialects, but pronounced (although vanishing) in the Northern ones. Unified Basque spells it except when it is predictable, in a position following a consonant.

Unless they are recent loanwords (e.g. "Ruanda" (Rwanda), "radar"...), words may not have initial . In older loans, initial "r-" took a <a href="Prothesis%20%28linguistics%29">prosthetic</a> "e-", resulting in "err-" ("Erroma" "Rome", "Errusia" "Russia"), more rarely "irr-" (for example "irratia" "radio", "irrisa" "rice").

Basque features great dialectal variation in <a href="Stress%20%28linguistics%29">stress</a>, from a weak <a href="pitch%20accent">pitch accent</a> in the central dialects to a marked stress in some outer dialects, with varying patterns of stress placement. Stress is in general not distinctive (and for historical comparisons not very useful); there are, however, a few instances where stress is phonemic, serving to distinguish between a few pairs of stress-marked words and between some grammatical forms (mainly plurals from other forms), e.g. "basóà" ("the forest", absolutive case) vs. "básoà" ("the glass", absolutive case; an adoption from Spanish "vaso"); "basóàk" ("the forest", ergative case) vs. "básoàk" ("the glass", ergative case) vs. "básoak" ("the forests" or "the glasses", absolutive case).

Given its great deal of variation among dialects, stress is not marked in the standard <a href="orthography">orthography</a> and <a href="Euskaltzaindia">Euskaltzaindia</a> (the Academy of the Basque Language) provides only general recommendations for a standard placement of stress, basically to place a high-pitched weak stress (weaker than that of Spanish, let alone that of English) on the second syllable of a <a href="Syntagmatic%20structure">syntagma</a>, and a low-pitched even-weaker stress on its last syllable, except in plural forms where stress is moved to the first syllable.

This scheme provides Basque with a distinct musicality that differentiates its sound from the <a href="Prosody%20%28linguistics%29">prosodical</a> patterns of Spanish (which tends to stress the second-to-last syllable). Some "Euskaldun berriak" ("new Basque-speakers", i.e. second-language Basque-speakers) with Spanish as their first language tend to carry the prosodical patterns of Spanish into their pronunciation of Basque, e.g. pronouncing "nire ama" ("my mum") as "nire áma" (– – ´ –), instead of as "niré amà" (– ´ – `).

The combining forms of nominals in final /-u/ vary across the regions of the Basque Country. The /u/ can stay unchanged, be lowered to an /a/, or it can be lost. Loss is most common in the east, while lowering is most common in the west. For instance, "buru", "head", has the combining forms "buru-" and "bur-", as in "buruko", "cap", and "burko", "pillow", whereas "katu", "cat", has the combining form "kata-", as in "katakume", "kitten". Michelena suggests that the lowering to /a/ is generalised from cases of Romance borrowings in Basque that retained Romance stem alternations, such as "kantu", "song" with combining form "kanta-", borrowed from Romance "canto", "canta-".

By contact with neighbouring peoples, Basque has adopted many words from <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, <a href="Gascon%20language">Gascon</a>, among others. There are a considerable number of Latin loans (sometimes obscured by being subject to Basque phonology and grammar for centuries), for example: "lore" ("flower", from "florem"), "errota" ("mill", from "rotam", "[mill] wheel"), "gela" ("room", from "cellam"), "gauza" ("thing", from "causa").

Basque is written using the <a href="Latin%20script">Latin script</a> including "<a href="%C3%B1">ñ</a>" and sometimes "<a href="%C3%A7">ç</a>" and "<a href="%C3%BC">ü</a>". Basque does not use "Cc, Qq, Vv, Ww, Yy " for words that have some tradition in this language; nevertheless, the Basque alphabet (established by <a href="Euskaltzaindia">Euskaltzaindia</a>) does include them for loanwords:

The phonetically meaningful <a href="Digraph%20%28orthography%29">digraphs</a> "dd, ll, <a href="rr%20%28digraph%29">rr</a>, ts, tt, tx, tz" are treated as pairs of letters.

All letters and digraphs represent unique <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a>s. The main exception is when "l" or "n" are preceded by "i", that in most dialects palatalizes their sound into /<a href="%CA%8E">ʎ</a>/ and /<a href="%C9%B2">ɲ</a>/, even if these are not written. Hence, "<a href="Ikurri%C3%B1a">Ikurriña</a>" can also be written "Ikurrina" without changing the sound, whereas the proper name "Ainhoa" requires the mute "h" to break the palatalization of the "n".

"H" is mute in most regions, but it is pronounced in many places in the northeast, the main reason for its existence in the Basque alphabet.
Its acceptance was a matter of contention during the standardization, because the speakers of the most extended dialects had to learn where to place these h's, silent for them.
In <a href="Sabino%20Arana">Sabino Arana</a>'s (1865–1903) alphabet, digraphs and were replaced with "<a href="%C4%BA">ĺ</a>" and "<a href="%C5%95">ŕ</a>", respectively.

A typically Basque style of lettering is sometimes used for inscriptions.
It derives from the work of stone and wood carvers and is characterized by thick <a href="serif">serif</a>s.

Basque millers traditionally employed a separate number system of unknown origin. In this system the symbols are either arranged along a vertical line or horizontally. On the vertical line the single digits and <a href="Fraction%20%28mathematics%29">fractions</a> are usually off to one side, usually at the top. When used horizontally, the smallest units are usually on the right and the largest on the left.

The system is, as is the Basque system of counting in general, <a href="vigesimal">vigesimal</a>. Although the system is in theory capable of indicating numbers above 100, most recorded examples do not go above 100 in general. Fractions are relatively common, especially .

The exact systems used vary from area to area but generally follow the same principle with 5 usually being a diagonal line or a curve off the vertical line (a V shape is used when writing a 5 horizontally). Units of ten are usually a horizontal line through the vertical. The twenties are based on a circle with intersecting lines. This system is no longer in general use but is occasionally employed for decorative purposes.

Björn Ulvaeus

Björn Kristian Ulvaeus () (born 25 April 1945; credited as Björn Ulvæus) is a <a href="Swedes">Swedish</a> songwriter, producer, a former member of the Swedish musical group <a href="ABBA">ABBA</a> (1972–1982), and co-composer of the musicals "<a href="Chess%20%28musical%29">Chess</a>", "<a href="Kristina%20fr%C3%A5n%20Duvem%C3%A5la">Kristina från Duvemåla</a>", and "<a href="Mamma%20Mia%21">Mamma Mia!</a>". He co-produced <a href="Mamma%20Mia%21%20%28film%29">the film "Mamma Mia!"</a> with fellow ABBA member and close friend <a href="Benny%20Andersson">Benny Andersson</a>.

Bjorn Kristian Ulvaeus was born in <a href="Gothenburg">Gothenburg</a>, but as a child he moved with his family to <a href="V%C3%A4stervik">Västervik</a>. His parents were Aina (1909–2005) and Erik Gunnar Ulvaeus (1912–1999). Ulvaeus studied business and law at <a href="Lund%20University">Lund University</a> after doing his <a href="Swedish%20Armed%20Forces">military service</a> with comedian Magnus Holmström.

Before gaining international recognition with <a href="ABBA">ABBA</a>, Ulvaeus was a member of the Swedish folk-<a href="schlager">schlager</a> band <a href="Hootenanny%20Singers">Hootenanny Singers</a>, early known as the "West Bay Singers", who had an enormous following in <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>. While on the road in southern Sweden in 1966, they encountered the <a href="Hep%20Stars">Hep Stars</a>, and Ulvaeus quickly became friends with the group's keyboard player, <a href="Benny%20Andersson">Benny Andersson</a>. The two musicians shared a passion for songwriting, and each found a composing partner in the other. On meeting again that summer, they composed their first song together: "Isn't It Easy To Say", a song soon to be recorded by Andersson's group. The two continued teaming up for music, helping out each other's bands in the recording studio, and adding guitar or keyboards respectively to the recordings. In 1968, they composed two songs together: "A Flower In My Garden", recorded by <a href="Hep%20Stars">Hep Stars</a>, and their first "real" hit "Ljuva Sextiotal", for which <a href="Stig%20Anderson">Stig Anderson</a> wrote lyrics. The latter, a cabarét-style ironic song about the 1960s, was submitted for the 1969 Swedish heats for the <a href="Eurovision">Eurovision Song Contest</a>, but was rejected; it was later recorded by diva <a href="Brita%20Borg">Brita Borg</a>. Another hit came in 1969 with "Speleman", also recorded by Hep Stars.

While filming a nostalgic schlager special for television in March 1969, Björn met an eighteen-year-old singer-songwriter <a href="Agnetha%20F%C3%A4ltskog">Agnetha Fältskog</a>. Benny had himself met his future spouse, a 23-year-old jazz and schlager vocalist <a href="Anni-Frid%20Lyngstad">Anni-Frid Lyngstad</a>, only weeks before.

Björn Ulvaeus continued recording and touring with Hootenanny Singers to great acclaim while working as in-house producer at <a href="Polar%20Record%20Company">Polar Record Company</a> (headed by future manager <a href="Stig%20Anderson">Stig Anderson</a>), with Benny as his new partner. The twosome produced records by other artists and continued writing songs together. Polar artist Arne Lamberts Swedish version of "A Flower in My Garden" (""Fröken Blåklint"") was one of Björn & Benny's first in-house productions. In December 1969, they recorded the new song "She's My Kind of Girl", which became their first single as a duo. It was released in March 1970, giving them a minor hit in Sweden (and by chance a top-ten hit in Japan two years later).

The Hootenanny Singers entered <a href="Svensktoppen">Svensktoppen</a>, the Swedish radio charts, in 1970 with "Omkring Tiggarn Från Luossa", a cover of an old folk-schlager song. It remained on the charts for 52 consecutive weeks, a record which endured until 1990; the song was produced by Björn and Benny, and had Ulvaeus's solo vocal and Benny's piano.

After ABBA, Ulvaeus and Andersson created the musicals "<a href="Chess%20%28musical%29">Chess</a>", a collaboration with lyricist Tim Rice, "<a href="Kristina%20fr%C3%A5n%20Duvem%C3%A5la">Kristina från Duvemåla</a>" (based on "<a href="The%20Emigrants%20%28novels%29">The Emigrants</a>" novels by Swedish writer <a href="Vilhelm%20Moberg">Vilhelm Moberg</a>), and "<a href="Mamma%20Mia%21">Mamma Mia!</a>" (based on ABBA songs).

Together with Andersson, Ulvaeus was nominated for the <a href="Drama%20Desk%20Award">Drama Desk Award</a> in the category "Outstanding Music" (for the musical "Chess"), and for a <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a> in a category "Best Orchestrations" (for the musical "Mamma Mia!"). Original cast recordings of both musicals were nominated for a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>.

For the 2004 semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, thirty years after ABBA had won the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%201974">1974 contest</a> in <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a>, UK, Ulvaeus appeared briefly in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled "Our Last Video". Each of the four members of the group appeared briefly in <a href="Cameo%20appearance">cameo</a> roles, as did others such as <a href="Cher">Cher</a> and <a href="Rik%20Mayall">Rik Mayall</a>. The video was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release. It was billed as the first time the four had worked together since the group split. In fact, they each filmed their appearances separately.

Ulvaeus also shared with Andersson "The Special International <a href="Ivor%20Novello">Ivor Novello</a> Award" from the <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Songwriters%2C%20Composers%20and%20Authors">British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors</a>, "The Music Export Prize" from the Swedish Ministry of Industry and Trade (2008), and "Lifetime Achievement Award" from the Swedish Music Publishers Association (SMFF).

On 15 April 2013, it was officially announced by the <a href="EBU">EBU</a> and the <a href="Sveriges%20Television">SVT</a> that Ulvaeus and Andersson, with the Swedish DJ and record producer <a href="Avicii">Avicii</a>, had composed the anthem for the <a href="2013%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">2013 Eurovision Song Contest</a>. The song was performed for the first time in the Final on 18 May.

On 6 July 1971, Ulvaeus married <a href="Agnetha%20F%C3%A4ltskog">Agnetha Fältskog</a>; the marriage resulted in two children: <a href="Linda%20Ulvaeus">Linda Elin Ulvaeus</a> (born 23 February 1973), and <a href="Christian%20Ulvaeus">Peter Christian Ulvaeus</a> (born 4 December 1977). The couple decided to separate in late 1978, and their divorce was finalised in July 1980. Ulvaeus then married music journalist Lena Källersjö on 6 January 1981. This marriage produced two daughters: Emma (born in 1982) and Anna (born in 1986).

Ulvaeus and Källersjö currently live in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>. From 1984 to 1990 they lived in the UK, where Ulvaeus founded an IT business with his brother.

He is also one of four people (including <a href="Per%20Gessle">Per Gessle</a>) who own NoteHeads, a Swedish company which publishes the <a href="Scorewriter">music notation program</a> <a href="Igor%20Engraver">Igor Engraver</a>.

Ulvaeus is a member of the <a href="International%20Humanist%20and%20Ethical%20Union">International Humanist and Ethical Union</a>'s Swedish member organisation <a href="Humanisterna">Humanisterna</a>, and was awarded their annual prize, "Hedenius-priset", in 2006. Ulvaeus describes himself as a "<a href="freethought">freethinker</a>", rather than an <a href="atheist">atheist</a>.

In 2008, Ulvaeus revealed that he suffered from severe <a href="long-term%20memory">long-term memory</a> loss and now no longer remembers many important events in his life. He now has little memory of some of the critical events in his professional history and has resorted to images of his past and even <a href="hypnotism">hypnotism</a> to try to bring back his memory. However, in a 2009 interview, he stated that reports of his memory loss were "hugely exaggerated". In a TV interview with Fredrik Skavlan, Ulvaeus said the memory loss pertained to episodic memory. He said that, for instance, he was not nostalgic for his days with ABBA: "It was good while it lasted."

"<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" called him Sweden's "highest-profile cash-free campaigner", explaining that "after his son was robbed several years ago, Ulvaeus became an evangelist for the electronic payment movement, claiming that cash was the primary cause of crime and that 'all activity in the <a href="Black%20market">black economy</a> requires cash'". He has reportedly been living cash-free for more than a year, and <a href="ABBA%20The%20Museum">ABBA The Museum</a> has operated cash-free since it opened in May 2013.

The <a href="Swedish%20Tax%20Agency">Swedish Tax Agency</a> accused Björn Ulvaeus of failing to pay 90 million <a href="Swedish%20krona">kronor</a> (US$12.8 million) in <a href="back%20taxes">back taxes</a> for eight years ending in 2005. The agency claimed that he "<a href="Money%20laundering">laundered</a>" his music <a href="Royalties">royalty</a> income through institutions in several foreign countries. Ulvaeus paid the taxes as a precautionary measure during the 2½-year dispute. In October 2008, the county administrative court decided the case in Ulvaeus' favour, ruling that he never owed any of the 90 million kronor.

Benny Andersson

Göran Bror Benny Andersson (; born 16 December 1946) is a <a href="Swedes">Swedish</a> musician, composer, member of the Swedish music group <a href="ABBA">ABBA</a> (1972–1982), and co-composer of the musicals "<a href="Chess%20%28musical%29">Chess</a>", "<a href="Kristina%20fr%C3%A5n%20Duvem%C3%A5la">Kristina från Duvemåla</a>", and "<a href="Mamma%20Mia%21">Mamma Mia!</a>". For the <a href="Mamma%20Mia%21%20%28film%29">2008 film version of "Mamma Mia!"</a>, he worked also as an executive producer. Since 2001, he is active with his own band <a href="Benny%20Anderssons%20orkester">Benny Anderssons orkester</a>.

Göran Bror Benny Andersson was born in <a href="V%C3%A4llingby">Vällingby</a> to 34-year-old civil engineer Gösta Andersson and his 26-year-old wife Laila. His sister Eva-Lis Andersson followed in 1948. Andersson's musical background comes from his father and grandfather; they both enjoyed playing the <a href="accordion">accordion</a>, and at six, Benny got his own. Father Gösta and grandfather Efraim taught him Swedish <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a>, <a href="traditional%20music">traditional music</a>, and the odd <a href="schlager">schlager</a>. Benny recalls the first records he bought were "Du Bist Musik" by Italian schlager singer <a href="Caterina%20Valente">Caterina Valente</a> and <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>'s "<a href="Jailhouse%20Rock%20%28song%29">Jailhouse Rock</a>". He was especially impressed by the flip side "Treat Me Nice" as this featured a piano. This <a href="sm%C3%B6rg%C3%A5sbord">smörgåsbord</a> of different kinds of music was to influence and follow him through the years.

When Andersson was ten he got his own piano, and taught himself to play. He left school aged 15 and began to perform at youth clubs. This is when he met his first girlfriend Christina Grönvall, with whom he had two children: Peter (born 1963) and Heléne (born 1965). In early 1964, Benny and Christina joined "Elverkets Spelmanslag" ("The Electricity Board Folk Music Group"), the name was a punning reference to their electric instruments. The repertoire was mainly instrumentals, one of his numbers was "<a href="Baby%20Elephant%20Walk">Baby Elephant Walk</a>", and he wrote his first songs.
In October 1964 he joined the <a href="Hep%20Stars">Hep Stars</a> as keyboardist and they made a breakthrough in March 1965 with their hit "Cadillac", eventually becoming the most celebrated of the Swedish 1960s pop bands. Andersson consolidated his place as the band's keyboardist and musical driving force as well as a teen idol. The band performed mostly covers of international hits, but Andersson soon started writing his own material, and gave the band the classic hits "No Response", "Sunny Girl", "Wedding", "Consolation", "It's Nice To Be Back" and "She Will Love You" amongst others.

Andersson met <a href="Bj%C3%B6rn%20Ulvaeus">Björn Ulvaeus</a> in June 1966, and the two started writing songs together, their first being <a href="https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmbEqcMOhU6k">"Isn't It Easy To Say"</a>, eventually recorded by the Hep Stars. He also had a fruitful songwriting collaboration with <a href="Lasse%20Berghagen">Lasse Berghagen</a>, with whom he wrote several songs and submitted "Hej, Clown" for the 1969 <a href="Melodifestivalen">Melodifestivalen</a> – the Swedish <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Festival">Eurovision Song Festival</a> finals. The song finished in second place. During this contest he met vocalist <a href="Anni-Frid%20Lyngstad">Anni-Frid Lyngstad</a>, and they soon became a couple. Around the same time his songwriting companion Ulvaeus met vocalist <a href="Agnetha%20F%C3%A4ltskog">Agnetha Fältskog</a>.

The personal relationships and Andersson and Ulvaeus' songwriting collaboration has led quite naturally to the very close co-operation which the four friends had during the following years. Benny and Björn scored their first hits as songwriters in the spring of 1969: "<a href="Ljuva%20sextital">Ljuva sextital</a>" (a hit with Brita Borg) and "Speleman" (a hit for the Hep Stars). As the two couples began supporting each other during recording sessions, the sound of the girls' voices convinced the songwriters to model their 'group' on various <a href="Middle%20of%20the%20road%20%28music%29">MOR</a> acts such as <a href="Blue%20Mink">Blue Mink</a>, <a href="Middle%20of%20the%20Road%20%28band%29">Middle of the Road</a> and <a href="The%20Sweet">Sweet</a>. Thus, <a href="ABBA">ABBA</a> came to life.
The group's breakthrough came with winning the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a> for Sweden with "<a href="Waterloo%20%28ABBA%20song%29">Waterloo</a>" on 6 April 1974. During the next eight years, Andersson (together with Ulvaeus) wrote music for and produced eight studio albums with ABBA. The group achieved great success globally and scored a chain of No. 1 hits.
After ABBA Andersson continued writing music with Ulvaeus. Their first project was the <a href="stage%20musical">stage musical</a> "<a href="Chess%20%28musical%29">Chess</a>", written with <a href="Tim%20Rice">Tim Rice</a>. The "Chess" concept album – with vocals by <a href="Elaine%20Paige">Elaine Paige</a>, <a href="Barbara%20Dickson">Barbara Dickson</a>, <a href="Murray%20Head">Murray Head</a> and Swedes <a href="Tommy%20K%C3%B6rberg">Tommy Körberg</a> and <a href="Bj%C3%B6rn%20Skifs">Björn Skifs</a> – was released in October 1984, selling two million copies worldwide. The Paige/Dickson duet "<a href="I%20Know%20Him%20So%20Well">I Know Him So Well</a>" became a major UK No. 1 hit, and Murray Head's "<a href="One%20Night%20in%20Bangkok">One Night in Bangkok</a>" gave Andersson/Ulvaeus a US No. 3 hit.

"Chess" was staged in London's West End <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Theatre">Prince Edward Theatre</a> in May 1986 and received mixed to positive reviews, running for about three years. A revised staging on Broadway in April 1988 received poor reviews, running for two months.

In 1985, Andersson produced and released an album with brother and sister <a href="Anders%20Glenmark">Anders</a> and <a href="Karin%20Glenmark">Karin Glenmark</a>, featuring new songs by Andersson/Ulvaeus. The duo named themselves <a href="Gemini%20%28Swedish%20band%29">Gemini</a>, and a second album with more music by Björn and Benny was released in April 1987, containing the big hit "<a href="Mio%20My%20Mio%20%28song%29">Mio My Mio</a>"; also to be found on the soundtrack to the film "<a href="Mio%20in%20the%20Land%20of%20Faraway">Mio in the Land of Faraway</a>", for which Andersson co-produced the music.

In 1987, Andersson released his first solo album "Klinga Mina Klockor" ("Chime, My Bells"). All the music was written by and performed by himself on accordion, backed by the "<a href="Orsa%20Spelm%C3%A4n">Orsa Spelmän</a>" (Orsa Folk Musicians) on fiddles. A second solo album followed: "November 1989".

In 1990, Andersson scored a Swedish #1 hit with "Lassie", sung by female cabaret group <a href="Ainbusk">Ainbusk</a>, for whom he also wrote the <a href="Svensktoppen">Svensktoppen</a> hits "Älska Mig" and "Drömmarnas Golv". He decided to produce an album with <a href="Josefin%20Nilsson">Josefin Nilsson</a> from this quartet, resulting in the 1993 English-language album "Shapes", featuring ten new Andersson/Ulvaeus compositions.

In 1992, he wrote the introduction melody for the European football championship, which was organised by Sweden that year.

From the late 1980s, Andersson had worked on an idea for an epic Swedish language musical based on his affection for traditional folk music, and in October 1995, "<a href="Kristina%20fr%C3%A5n%20Duvem%C3%A5la">Kristina från Duvemåla</a>" premiered in Sweden. The musical was based on "<a href="The%20Emigrants%20%28novels%29">The Emigrants</a>" novels by Swedish writer <a href="Vilhelm%20Moberg">Vilhelm Moberg</a>. The musical ran successfully for almost five years, before closing in June 1999. An English-language version, simply titled "Kristina", was staged in concert at <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> in New York City for two nights in September 2009, yielding a live recording, and at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> for one night in April 2010.

Andersson's next project was "<a href="Mamma%20Mia%21">Mamma Mia!</a>", a musical built around 24 of ABBA's songs, which has become a worldwide box-office blockbuster with versions in several languages currently being played in many countries, including the UK (West End premiere in April 1999), Canada (<a href="Royal%20Alexandra%20Theatre">Toronto</a> premiere in 2000), the USA (Broadway premiere in 2001), and Sweden (<a href="Swedish%20language">Swedish language</a> premiere in 2005).

For the 2004 semi-final of the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a>, staged in Istanbul thirty years after <a href="ABBA">ABBA</a> had won the contest in Brighton, Benny appeared briefly in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled "Our Last Video". Each of the four members of the group appeared briefly in cameo roles, as did others such as <a href="Cher">Cher</a> and <a href="Rik%20Mayall">Rik Mayall</a>. The video was not included in the official DVD release of the Eurovision Contest, but was issued as a separate DVD release. It was billed as the first time the four had worked together since the group split; however, Frida's appearance was filmed separately.

A film version of "<a href="Mamma%20Mia%21">Mamma Mia!</a>" premiered on 18 July 2008. In April/May 2007, Andersson worked on the film soundtrack, re-recording the old ABBA songs with musicians from the old ABBA recording sessions. "<a href="Mamma%20Mia%21%20%28film%29">Mamma Mia! The Movie</a>" has now become the most successful movie musical of all time and has been named the number one box office smash of 2008, and the biggest-selling DVD ever in the UK.

Andersson currently performs with his own band of 16 musicians, <a href="Benny%20Anderssons%20Orkester">BAO</a>; ""Benny Anderssons Orkester"" ("Benny Andersson's orchestra"), utilising the vocal talents of fellow Swedes <a href="Helen%20Sj%C3%B6holm">Helen Sjöholm</a> (from "Kristina from Duvemåla") and <a href="Tommy%20K%C3%B6rberg">Tommy Körberg</a> (of "Chess" fame), with lyrics to new material sometimes written by his song-writing partner and best friend of 40 years, Björn Ulvaeus. BAO has released five albums to huge success in Sweden, all containing hit singles.

BAO recently achieved a new record in Sweden on the <a href="Svensktoppen">Svensktoppen</a> chart by staying there for 243 weeks with the song "Du är min man" ("You Are My Man"), sung by <a href="Helen%20Sj%C3%B6holm">Helen Sjöholm</a>.

Andersson composes primarily for his 'band' BAO! with the vocalists Sjöholm and Körberg, but keeps his older material alive through re-visiting it, like the staging of 'Mamma Mia!' and the Swedish version of 'Chess'.

For a compilation album of the Glenmark duo <a href="Gemini%20%28Swedish%20band%29">Gemini</a>, Andersson had Björn Ulvaeus write new Swedish lyrics for the re-recording of two songs from 1984 and 1987.
Andersson and Ulvaeus have continuously been writing new material; most recently the two wrote seven songs for Andersson's 'BAO' 2011 album "O Klang Och Jubeltid", performed as usual by vocalists Sjöholm, Körberg and Moreus. In July 2009, BAO, now named "The Benny Andersson Band", released their first international record, the album "The Story of a Heart". It was a compilation of 14 tracks from Andersson's five Swedish-language releases between 1987 and 2007, including five songs now recorded with lyrics by Ulvaeus in English, and the new title song premiered on BBC2's "Ken Bruce Show". A Swedish-language version of the title track, ""Sommaren Du Fick"" ("The Summer You Got"), was released as a single in Sweden prior to the English version, with vocals by Helen Sjöholm.

In the spring of 2009, Andersson also released a single recorded by the staff at his privately owned <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> hotel "Hotel Rival", titled "<a href="2nd%20Best%20to%20None">2nd Best to None</a>", accompanied by a video showing the staff at work. In 2008, Andersson and Ulvaeus wrote a song for Swedish singer <a href="Sissela%20Kyle">Sissela Kyle</a>, titled ""Jag vill bli gammal"" ("I Wanna Grow Old"), for her Stockholm stage show ""Your Days Are Numbered"", which was never recorded and released, but did get a TV performance. Ulvaeus also contributed lyrics to ABBA's 1976 instrumental track "Arrival" for <a href="Sarah%20Brightman">Sarah Brightman</a>'s cover version recorded for her 2008 album "<a href="Winter%20Symphony">Winter Symphony</a>". New English lyrics have also been written for Andersson's 1999 song ""Innan Gryningen"" (then also named "Millennium Hymn"), with the new title "The Silence of the Dawn" for Barbara Dickson was performed live, but not yet recorded and released. In 2007, they wrote the new song ""Han som har vunnit allt"" ("He Who's Won It All") for actor/singer <a href="Anders%20Ekborg">Anders Ekborg</a>. Björn wrote English lyrics for two older songs from Benny's solo albums: "I Walk with You Mama" ("Stockholm by Night", 1989) and "After the Rain" ("Efter regnet", 1987) for opera singer <a href="Anne%20Sofie%20Von%20Otter">Anne Sofie Von Otter</a>, for her Andersson tribute album "I Let the Music Speak". <a href="Barbra%20Dickson">Barbra Dickson</a> recorded (but not yet released) a Björn & Benny song called 'The Day The Wall Came Tumbling Down'; the song eventually was released by Australian 'Mamma Mia!' musical star <a href="Anne%20Wood">Anne Wood</a> 201 album of ABBA covers, <a href="Divine%20Discontent">Divine Discontent</a>. As of October 2012, Björn Ulvaeus has mentioned writing new material with Benny for a 'BAO' Christmas release (also mentioned as a BAO 'box'), and Benny is busy writing music for a Swedish language obscure musical, 'Hjälp Sökes' ('Help is Wanted') together with Kristina Lugn and Lars Rudolfsson, premiering 8 February 2013.
Andersson has also written music for a documentary film about <a href="Olof%20Palme">Olof Palme</a>, re-recording the track 'Sorgmarch' from his last album as a theme throughout the film.
The song "Kärlekens Tid" -recorded 2004 by Helen Sjöholm with BAO- -has also been performed in concert in English (lyrics by Ylva Eggehorn) by opera <a href="baritone">baritone</a> <a href="Bryn%20Terfel">Bryn Terfel</a>.
On 15 April 2013, it was officially announced by the <a href="EBU">EBU</a> and the <a href="Sveriges%20Television">SVT</a> that Benny along with the ex-<a href="ABBA">ABBA</a> member, <a href="Bj%C3%B6rn%20Ulvaeus">Björn Ulvaeus</a> and the <a href="Swedish%20people">Swedish</a> DJ and record producer, <a href="Avicii">Avicii</a>, have composed the anthem for the <a href="2013%20Eurovision%20Song%20Contest">2013 Eurovision Song Contest</a>. The song was performed for the first time in the Final on 18 May.

A new album of Andersson compositions presented in a choral style was released on September 18, 2015. "Kärlekens Tid" was produced in Andersson's Mono Music studio, under the direction of choirmaster Gustaf Sjökvist who died before the album's release. Gustaf Sjökvists Choir, conducted by Cecilia Rydinger Alin, performed two concerts at Skeppsholmen on September 20, featuring Benny Andersson on piano. The album includes songs in Swedish and English from a range of Andersson's projects, such as Chess, Kristina and BAO.

Andersson has written music to several films for screen and television; the first attempt in the early 1970s for the Swedish erotica movie "The Seduction of Inga"; the film was not a success, but the 'Björn & Benny' single "She's My Kind of Girl" surprised the composers by being released in Japan and becoming a Top 10 hit (the song renamed in Japan as "The Little Girl of the Cold Wind").

In 1987, Andersson wrote music and co-produced the soundtrack with Anders Eljas for the film "<a href="Mio%20in%20the%20Land%20of%20Faraway">Mio in the Land of Faraway</a>", based on Swedish author <a href="Astrid%20Lindgren">Astrid Lindgren</a>s "<a href="Mio%2C%20My%20Son">Mio, My Son</a>". The title song became a huge hit in Sweden for <a href="Gemini%20%28Swedish%20band%29">Gemini</a>.

In 2000, he wrote the music for fellow Swede (no relation) <a href="Roy%20Andersson">Roy Andersson</a>'s film "<a href="Songs%20from%20the%20Second%20Floor">Songs from the Second Floor</a>" (the music later re-recorded, featuring new lyrics, with BAO! with vocals by Helen Sjöholm). He also wrote the theme for Roy Andersson's next film, "<a href="You%2C%20the%20Living">You, the Living</a>", from 2007.

Andersson also worked on the film adaptation of "Mamma Mia!". He also wrote the film score for the 2012 documentary "<a href="Palme%20%28film%29">Palme</a>" about Swedish prime minister <a href="Olof%20Palme">Olof Palme</a>. He later won a <a href="Guldbagge%20Award">Guldbagge Award</a> for Best Original Score, for that film at the <a href="48th%20Guldbagge%20Awards">48th Guldbagge Awards</a>.

Together with Ulvaeus, Andersson was nominated for a <a href="Drama%20Desk%20Award">Drama Desk Award</a> in a category "Outstanding Music" (for the musical "Chess"), and for a <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a> in a category "Best Orchestrations" (for musical "Mamma Mia!"). Original cast recordings of both musicals were nominated for a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>. Andersson/Ulvaeus also won a <a href="Touring%20Broadway%20Awards">Touring Broadway Award</a> for the musical "Mamma Mia" (best score).

During his post-ABBA career Andersson won four Swedish <a href="Grammis">Grammis</a> awards, and together with Ulvaeus received the "Special International" <a href="Ivor%20Novello">Ivor Novello</a> award from 'The British Academy of Composers and Songwriters', twice "The Music Export Prize" from the Swedish Ministry of Industry and Trade (2008), as well as the "Lifetime Achievement" award from the Swedish Music Publishers Association (SMFF). In 2002, Andersson was given an honorary professorship by the Swedish Government for his "ability to create high-class music reaching people around the world".

In 2007, he was elected a member of <a href="Royal%20Swedish%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Swedish Academy of Music</a>, and in 2008 received an Honorary Doctorate from the <a href="Stockholm%20University">Stockholm University</a> Faculty of Humanities for contributing importantly both to the preservation and the growth of the Swedish folk music tradition.

On 15 March 2010, Andersson appeared on stage in New York with former wife Anni-Frid Lyngstad to accept ABBA's award of induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. During his acceptance speech he reflected on the important influence of traditional European music and the melancholy of the Swedish soul on ABBA's brand of pop music. "If you live in a country like Sweden, with five, six months of snow, and the sun disappears totally for like two months, that would be reflected in the work of artists," he said. "It's definitely in the Swedish folk music, you can hear it in the Russian folk songs, you can hear in the music from Jean Sibelius or Edvard Grieg from Norway, you can see it in the eyes of Greta Garbo and you can hear it in the voice of Jussi Björling. And you can hear in the sound of Frida and Agnetha on some of our songs too."

In 2012, he received an Honorary Doctorate of Philosophy from the <a href="Lule%C3%A5%20Tekniska%20Universitet">Luleå Tekniska Universitet</a> Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences.

Andersson won the Swedish "Guldbaggen" award in 2012 as composer of the music for the film "Palme".

Andersson was engaged to Christina Grönvall. In 1963, they had a son, Peter Grönvall, and in 1965, a daughter, Heléne. They split in 1966 and Christina kept custody of the children as Andersson was then at the peak of his Hep Stars' success. In the 1990s, Peter formed <a href="One%20More%20Time%20%28band%29">One More Time</a>, a group that enjoyed European success with the ABBA-like "Highland" and, later, as Sweden's entry to the <a href="Eurovision%20Song%20Contest%201996">Eurovision Song Contest 1996</a>.

Andersson was engaged to <a href="Anni-Frid%20Lyngstad">Anni-Frid Lyngstad</a> of ABBA for about nine years and they married on 6 October 1978, but separated on 26 November 1980 and divorced in 1981.

He married Swedish TV presenter Mona Nörklit in 1981 and had a son, Ludvig (born January 1982), who has since followed in his father's footsteps in forming his own band.

Andersson struggled with <a href="alcoholism">alcoholism</a> and <a href="drug%20abuse">drug abuse</a> through much of his adult life. He has remained a <a href="teetotaler">teetotaler</a> since 2001. Andersson did not disclose the extent of his substance abuse problems until a 2011 interview, at which point he had maintained nearly a decade of sobriety.

Bluetooth

Bluetooth is a <a href="wireless">wireless</a> technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength <a href="UHF">UHF</a> <a href="radio%20waves">radio waves</a> in the <a href="ISM%20band">ISM band</a> from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz) from fixed and mobile devices, and building <a href="personal%20area%20network">personal area network</a>s (PANs). Invented by telecom vendor <a href="Ericsson">Ericsson</a> in 1994, it was originally conceived as a wireless alternative to <a href="RS-232">RS-232</a> data cables.

Bluetooth is managed by the <a href="Bluetooth%20Special%20Interest%20Group">Bluetooth Special Interest Group</a> (SIG), which has more than 30,000 member companies in the areas of telecommunication, computing, networking, and consumer electronics. The <a href="Institute%20of%20Electrical%20and%20Electronics%20Engineers">IEEE</a> standardized Bluetooth as IEEE 802.15.1, but no longer maintains the standard. The Bluetooth SIG oversees development of the specification, manages the qualification program, and protects the trademarks. A manufacturer must meet <a href="Bluetooth%20Special%20Interest%20Group%23Qualification">Bluetooth SIG standards</a> to market it as a Bluetooth device. A network of <a href="patent">patent</a>s apply to the technology, which are licensed to individual qualifying devices.

The development of the "short-link" radio technology, later named Bluetooth, was initiated in 1989 by Nils Rydbeck, CTO at Ericsson Mobile in <a href="Lund">Lund</a>, Sweden, and by <a href="Johan%20Ullman">Johan Ullman</a>. The purpose was to develop wireless headsets, according to two inventions by <a href="Johan%20Ullman">Johan Ullman</a>, and . Nils Rydbeck tasked Tord Wingren with specifying and <a href="Jaap%20Haartsen">Jaap Haartsen</a> and Sven Mattisson with developing. Both were working for <a href="Ericsson">Ericsson</a> in <a href="Lund">Lund</a>. The specification is based on <a href="frequency-hopping%20spread%20spectrum">frequency-hopping spread spectrum</a> technology.

The name "Bluetooth" is an <a href="Anglicisation">Anglicised</a> version of the Scandinavian "Blåtand"/"Blåtann" (<a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> "blátǫnn"), the <a href="epithet">epithet</a> of the tenth-century king <a href="Harald%20Bluetooth">Harald Bluetooth</a> who united dissonant Danish tribes into a single kingdom and, according to legend, introduced Christianity as well. The idea of this name was proposed in 1997 by <a href="Jim%20Kardach">Jim Kardach</a> of <a href="Intel">Intel</a> who developed a system that would allow mobile phones to communicate with computers. At the time of this proposal he was reading <a href="Frans%20G.%20Bengtsson">Frans G. Bengtsson</a>'s historical novel "<a href="The%20Long%20Ships">The Long Ships</a>" about Vikings and King Harald Bluetooth. The implication is that Bluetooth does the same with communications protocols, uniting them into one universal standard.

The Bluetooth logo is a <a href="bind%20rune">bind rune</a> merging the <a href="Younger%20Futhark">Younger Futhark</a> <a href="runic%20alphabet">runes</a>  (<a href="Haglaz">Hagall</a>) (ᚼ) and  (<a href="Berkanan">Bjarkan</a>) (ᛒ), Harald's initials.
Bluetooth operates at frequencies between 2402 and 2480 MHz, or 2400 and 2483.5 MHz including <a href="guard%20band">guard band</a>s 2 MHz wide at the bottom end and 3.5 MHz wide at the top. This is in the globally unlicensed (but not unregulated) industrial, scientific and medical (<a href="ISM%20band">ISM</a>) 2.4 GHz short-range radio frequency band. Bluetooth uses a radio technology called <a href="frequency-hopping%20spread%20spectrum">frequency-hopping spread spectrum</a>. Bluetooth divides transmitted data into packets, and transmits each packet on one of 79 designated Bluetooth channels. Each channel has a bandwidth of 1 MHz. It usually performs 800 hops per second, with <a href="Adaptive%20frequency-hopping%20spread%20spectrum">Adaptive Frequency-Hopping</a> (AFH) enabled. <a href="Bluetooth%20low%20energy">Bluetooth low energy</a> uses 2 MHz spacing, which accommodates 40 channels.

Originally, <a href="Gaussian%20frequency-shift%20keying">Gaussian frequency-shift keying</a> (GFSK) modulation was the only modulation scheme available. Since the introduction of Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, π/4-<a href="DQPSK">DQPSK</a> (differential quadrature phase shift keying) and 8DPSK modulation may also be used between compatible devices. Devices functioning with GFSK are said to be operating in basic rate (BR) mode where an instantaneous <a href="bit%20rate">bit rate</a> of 1 <a href="Data%20rate%20units">Mbit/s</a> is possible. The term Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) is used to describe π/4-DPSK and 8DPSK schemes, each giving 2 and 3 Mbit/s respectively. The combination of these (BR and EDR) modes in Bluetooth radio technology is classified as a "BR/EDR radio".

Bluetooth is a <a href="Packet%20switching">packet-based protocol</a> with a <a href="Master/slave%20%28technology%29">master/slave architecture</a>. One master may communicate with up to seven slaves in a <a href="piconet">piconet</a>. All devices share the master's clock. Packet exchange is based on the basic clock, defined by the master, which ticks at 312.5 µs intervals. Two clock ticks make up a slot of 625 <a href="%C2%B5s">µs</a>, and two slots make up a slot pair of 1250 µs. In the simple case of single-slot packets the master transmits in even slots and receives in odd slots. The slave, conversely, receives in even slots and transmits in odd slots. Packets may be 1, 3 or 5 slots long, but in all cases the master's transmission begins in even slots and the slave's in odd slots.

The above is valid for "classic" BT. Bluetooth Low Energy, introduced in the 4.0 specification, uses the same spectrum but somewhat differently; see <a href="Bluetooth%20low%20energy%23Radio%20interface">Bluetooth low energy#Radio interface</a>.

A master BR/EDR Bluetooth device can communicate with a maximum of seven devices in a piconet (an ad-hoc computer network using Bluetooth technology), though not all devices reach this maximum. The devices can switch roles, by agreement, and the slave can become the master (for example, a headset initiating a connection to a phone necessarily begins as master—as initiator of the connection—but may subsequently operate as slave).

The Bluetooth Core Specification provides for the connection of two or more piconets to form a <a href="scatternet">scatternet</a>, in which certain devices simultaneously play the master role in one piconet and the slave role in another.

At any given time, data can be transferred between the master and one other device (except for the little-used broadcast mode). The master chooses which slave device to address; typically, it switches rapidly from one device to another in a <a href="round-robin%20scheduling">round-robin</a> fashion. Since it is the master that chooses which slave to address, whereas a slave is (in theory) supposed to listen in each receive slot, being a master is a lighter burden than being a slave. Being a master of seven slaves is possible; being a slave of more than one master is possible. The specification is vague as to required behavior in scatternets.

Bluetooth is a standard wire-replacement communications protocol primarily designed for low-power consumption, with a short range based on low-cost <a href="transceiver">transceiver</a> <a href="integrated%20circuit">microchips</a> in each device. Because the devices use a radio (broadcast) communications system, they do not have to be in visual line of sight of each other; however, a "<a href="Quasi-optical">quasi optical</a>" wireless path must be viable. Range is power-class-dependent, but effective ranges vary in practice. See the table on the right.

Officially Class 3 radios have a range of up to , Class 2, most commonly found in mobile devices, , and Class 1, primarily for industrial use cases. Bluetooth Marketing qualifies that Class 1 range is in most cases , and Class 2 range .

The effective range varies due to propagation conditions, material coverage, production sample variations, antenna configurations and battery conditions. Most Bluetooth applications are for indoor conditions, where attenuation of walls and signal fading due to signal reflections make the range far lower than specified line-of-sight ranges of the Bluetooth products. Most Bluetooth applications are battery-powered Class 2 devices, with little difference in range whether the other end of the link is a Class 1 or Class 2 device as the lower-powered device tends to set the range limit. In some cases the effective range of the data link can be extended when a Class 2 device is connecting to a Class 1 transceiver with both higher sensitivity and transmission power than a typical Class 2 device. Mostly, however, the Class 1 devices have a similar sensitivity to Class 2 devices. Connecting two Class 1 devices with both high sensitivity and high power can allow ranges far in excess of the typical 100m, depending on the throughput required by the application. Some such devices allow open field ranges of up to 1 km and beyond between two similar devices without exceeding legal emission limits.

The Bluetooth Core Specification mandates a range of not less than , but there is no upper limit on actual range. Manufacturers' implementations can be tuned to provide the range needed for each case.

To use Bluetooth wireless technology, a device must be able to interpret certain Bluetooth profiles, which are definitions of possible applications and specify general behaviors that Bluetooth-enabled devices use to communicate with other Bluetooth devices. These profiles include settings to parameterize and to control the communication from the start. Adherence to profiles saves the time for transmitting the parameters anew before the bi-directional link becomes effective. There are a wide range of Bluetooth profiles that describe many different types of applications or use cases for devices.


Bluetooth and <a href="Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi</a> (the brand name for products using <a href="IEEE%20802.11">IEEE 802.11</a> standards) have some similar applications: setting up networks, printing, or transferring files. Wi-Fi is intended as a replacement for high-speed cabling for general <a href="local%20area%20network">local area network</a> access in work areas or home. This category of applications is sometimes called <a href="wireless%20local%20area%20network">wireless local area network</a>s (WLAN). Bluetooth was intended for portable equipment and its applications. The category of applications is outlined as the wireless <a href="personal%20area%20network">personal area network</a> (WPAN). Bluetooth is a replacement for cabling in a variety of personally carried applications in any setting, and also works for fixed location applications such as smart energy functionality in the home (thermostats, etc.).

Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are to some extent complementary in their applications and usage. Wi-Fi is usually access point-centered, with an asymmetrical client-server connection with all traffic routed through the access point, while Bluetooth is usually symmetrical, between two Bluetooth devices. Bluetooth serves well in simple applications where two devices need to connect with minimal configuration like a button press, as in headsets and remote controls, while Wi-Fi suits better in applications where some degree of client configuration is possible and high speeds are required, especially for network access through an access node. However, Bluetooth access points do exist, and ad-hoc connections are possible with Wi-Fi though not as simply as with Bluetooth. <a href="Wi-Fi%20Direct">Wi-Fi Direct</a> was recently developed to add a more Bluetooth-like ad-hoc functionality to Wi-Fi.

<a href="Bluetooth%20Smart">Bluetooth Smart</a> and <a href="ANT%2B">ANT+</a> are similar wireless technologies that allow information to pass between electronic devices.
Bluetooth devices will talk to other electronics connected to the Bluetooth network – and the same goes for ANT+ devices.
Of course there are advantages and disadvantages of each protocol that must be considered when choosing.

Bluetooth exists in many products, such as telephones, <a href="Wireless%20speaker">speakers</a>, tablets, media players, robotics systems, handheld, laptops and console gaming equipment, and some high definition <a href="Headset%20%28audio%29">headsets</a>, <a href="modem">modem</a>s, and watches. The technology is useful when transferring information between two or more devices that are near each other in low-bandwidth situations. Bluetooth is commonly used to transfer sound data with telephones (i.e., with a Bluetooth headset) or byte data with hand-held computers (transferring files).

Bluetooth protocols simplify the discovery and setup of services between devices. Bluetooth devices can advertise all of the services they provide. This makes using services easier, because more of the security, <a href="network%20address">network address</a> and permission configuration can be automated than with many other network types.

A personal computer that does not have embedded Bluetooth can use a Bluetooth adapter that enables the PC to communicate with Bluetooth devices. While some <a href="desktop%20computer">desktop computer</a>s and most recent laptops come with a built-in Bluetooth radio, others require an external adapter, typically in the form of a small USB "<a href="dongle">dongle</a>."

Unlike its predecessor, <a href="Infrared%20Data%20Association">IrDA</a>, which requires a separate adapter for each device, Bluetooth lets multiple devices communicate with a computer over a single adapter.

For <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> platforms, <a href="Windows%20XP%20Service%20Pack%202">Windows XP Service Pack 2</a> and SP3
releases work natively with Bluetooth v1.1, v2.0 and v2.0+EDR.
Previous versions required users to install their Bluetooth adapter's own drivers, which were not directly supported by Microsoft.
Microsoft's own Bluetooth dongles (packaged with their Bluetooth computer devices) have no external drivers and thus require at least Windows XP Service Pack 2. Windows Vista RTM/SP1 with the Feature Pack for Wireless or Windows Vista SP2 work with Bluetooth v2.1+EDR. Windows 7 works with Bluetooth v2.1+EDR and Extended Inquiry Response (EIR).

The Windows XP and Windows Vista/Windows 7 Bluetooth stacks support the following Bluetooth profiles natively: PAN, SPP, <a href="Dial-up%20Internet%20access">DUN</a>, HID, HCRP. The Windows XP stack can be replaced by a third party stack that supports more profiles or newer Bluetooth versions. The Windows Vista/Windows 7 Bluetooth stack supports vendor-supplied additional profiles without requiring that the Microsoft stack be replaced.

<a href="Apple%20Inc.">Apple</a> products have worked with Bluetooth since <a href="Mac%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BOS%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BX%20v10.2">Mac OS X v10.2</a>, which was released in 2002.

<a href="Linux">Linux</a> has two popular <a href="Bluetooth%20stack">Bluetooth stack</a>s, <a href="BlueZ">BlueZ</a> and Affix. The BlueZ stack is included with most Linux kernels and was originally developed by <a href="Qualcomm">Qualcomm</a>. The Affix stack was developed by <a href="Nokia">Nokia</a>.

<a href="FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a> features Bluetooth since its v5.0 release.

<a href="NetBSD">NetBSD</a> features Bluetooth since its v4.0 release. Its Bluetooth stack was ported to <a href="OpenBSD">OpenBSD</a> as well, however OpenBSD later removed it for security reasons.

The specifications were formalized by the <a href="Bluetooth%20Special%20Interest%20Group">Bluetooth Special Interest Group</a> (SIG). The SIG was formally announced on 20 May 1998. Today it has a membership of over 30,000 companies worldwide. It was established by <a href="Ericsson">Ericsson</a>, <a href="IBM">IBM</a>, <a href="Intel">Intel</a>, <a href="Toshiba">Toshiba</a> and <a href="Nokia">Nokia</a>, and later joined by many other companies.

All versions of the Bluetooth standards support <a href="Backward%20compatibility">downward compatibility</a>.<a href="https%3A//www.kohls.com/media/digital/ecom/pdfs/pdf/Bluetooth_Compatibility_Guide_May_2015.pdf"></a> That lets the latest standard cover all older versions.

The Bluetooth Core Specification Working Group (CSWG) produces mainly 4 kinds of specifications:

Versions 1.0 and 1.0B had many problems, and manufacturers had difficulty making their products interoperable. Versions 1.0 and 1.0B also included mandatory Bluetooth hardware device address (BD_ADDR) transmission in the Connecting process (rendering anonymity impossible at the protocol level), which was a major setback for certain services planned for use in Bluetooth environments.


Major enhancements include:

This version of the Bluetooth Core Specification was released in 2004. The main difference is the introduction of an Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) for <a href="Bit%20rate">faster data transfer</a>. The bit rate of EDR is 3 Mbit/s, although the maximum data transfer rate (allowing for inter-packet time and acknowledgements) is 2.1 Mbit/s. EDR uses a combination of <a href="Gaussian%20frequency-shift%20keying">GFSK</a> and <a href="Phase%20shift%20keying">Phase Shift Keying</a> modulation (PSK) with two variants, π/4-<a href="DQPSK">DQPSK</a> and 8<a href="DPSK">DPSK</a>. EDR can provide a lower power consumption through a reduced <a href="duty%20cycle">duty cycle</a>.

The specification is published as "Bluetooth v2.0 + EDR", which implies that EDR is an optional feature. Aside from EDR, the v2.0 specification contains other minor improvements, and products may claim compliance to "Bluetooth v2.0" without supporting the higher data rate. At least one commercial device states "Bluetooth v2.0 without EDR" on its data sheet.

Bluetooth Core Specification Version 2.1 + EDR was adopted by the Bluetooth SIG on 26 July 2007.

The headline feature of v2.1 is secure simple pairing (SSP): this improves the pairing experience for Bluetooth devices, while increasing the use and strength of security. See the section on <a href="%23Pairing">Pairing</a> below for more details.

Version 2.1 allows various other improvements, including "Extended inquiry response" (EIR), which provides more information during the inquiry procedure to allow better filtering of devices before connection; and sniff subrating, which reduces the power consumption in low-power mode.

Version 3.0 + HS of the Bluetooth Core Specification was adopted by the Bluetooth SIG on 21 April 2009. Bluetooth v3.0 + HS provides theoretical data transfer speeds of up to 24 Mbit/s, though not over the Bluetooth link itself. Instead, the Bluetooth link is used for negotiation and establishment, and the high data rate traffic is carried over a colocated <a href="IEEE%20802.11">802.11</a> link.

The main new feature is AMP (Alternative MAC/PHY), the addition of <a href="IEEE%20802.11">802.11</a> as a high-speed transport. The high-speed part of the specification is not mandatory, and hence only devices that display the "+HS" logo actually support Bluetooth over 802.11 high-speed data transfer. A Bluetooth v3.0 device without the "+HS" suffix is only required to support features introduced in Core Specification Version 3.0 or earlier Core Specification Addendum 1.


The high-speed (AMP) feature of Bluetooth v3.0 was originally intended for <a href="Ultra-wideband">UWB</a>, but the WiMedia Alliance, the body responsible for the flavor of UWB intended for Bluetooth, announced in March 2009 that it was disbanding, and ultimately UWB was omitted from the Core v3.0 specification.

On 16 March 2009, the <a href="WiMedia%20Alliance">WiMedia Alliance</a> announced it was entering into technology transfer agreements for the WiMedia <a href="Ultra-wideband">Ultra-wideband</a> (UWB) specifications. WiMedia has transferred all current and future specifications, including work on future high-speed and power-optimized implementations, to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), <a href="Wireless%20USB">Wireless USB</a> Promoter Group and the <a href="USB%20Implementers%20Forum">USB Implementers Forum</a>. After successful completion of the technology transfer, marketing, and related administrative items, the WiMedia Alliance ceased operations.

In October 2009 the <a href="Bluetooth%20Special%20Interest%20Group">Bluetooth Special Interest Group</a> suspended development of UWB as part of the alternative MAC/PHY, Bluetooth v3.0 + HS solution. A small, but significant, number of former <a href="WiMedia%20Alliance">WiMedia</a> members had not and would not sign up to the necessary agreements for the <a href="intellectual%20property">IP</a> transfer. The Bluetooth SIG is now in the process of evaluating other options for its longer term roadmap.

The Bluetooth SIG completed the Bluetooth Core Specification version 4.0 (called Bluetooth Smart) and has been adopted as of 30 June 2010. It includes "Classic Bluetooth", "Bluetooth high speed" and "<a href="Bluetooth%20low%20energy">Bluetooth low energy</a>" protocols. Bluetooth high speed is based on Wi-Fi, and Classic Bluetooth consists of legacy Bluetooth protocols.

<a href="Bluetooth%20low%20energy">Bluetooth low energy</a>, previously known as Wibree, is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack for rapid build-up of simple links. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a <a href="Button%20cell">coin cell</a>. Chip designs allow for two types of implementation, dual-mode, single-mode and enhanced past versions. The provisional names "Wibree" and "Bluetooth ULP" (Ultra Low Power) were abandoned and the BLE name was used for a while. In late 2011, new logos "Bluetooth Smart Ready" for hosts and "Bluetooth Smart" for sensors were introduced as the general-public face of BLE.

Cost-reduced single-mode chips, which enable highly integrated and compact devices, feature a lightweight Link Layer providing ultra-low power idle mode operation, simple device discovery, and reliable point-to-multipoint data transfer with advanced power-save and secure encrypted connections at the lowest possible cost.

General improvements in version 4.0 include the changes necessary to facilitate BLE modes, as well the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) and Security Manager (SM) services with <a href="Advanced%20Encryption%20Standard">AES</a> Encryption.

Core Specification Addendum 2 was unveiled in December 2011; it contains improvements to the audio Host Controller Interface and to the High Speed (802.11) Protocol Adaptation Layer.

Core Specification Addendum 3 revision 2 has an adoption date of 24 July 2012.

Core Specification Addendum 4 has an adoption date of 12 February 2013.

The Bluetooth SIG announced formal adoption of the Bluetooth v4.1 specification on 4 December 2013. This specification is an incremental software update to Bluetooth Specification v4.0, and not a hardware update. The update incorporates Bluetooth Core Specification Addenda (CSA 1, 2, 3 & 4) and adds new features that improve consumer usability. These include increased co-existence support for LTE, bulk data exchange rates—and aid developer innovation by allowing devices to support multiple roles simultaneously.

New features of this specification include: 
Notice that some features were already available in a Core Specification Addendum (CSA) before the release of v4.1.

Released on December 2, 2014, it Introduces features for the <a href="Internet%20of%20Things">Internet of Things</a>.

The major areas of improvement are:
Older Bluetooth hardware may receive 4.2 features such as Data Packet Length Extension and improved privacy via firmware updates.

The Bluetooth SIG officially unveiled Bluetooth 5 during a media event in London on 16 June 2016. Its new features are mainly focused on emerging <a href="Internet%20of%20Things">Internet of Things</a> technology. The Samsung <a href="Galaxy%20S8">Galaxy S8</a> launched with Bluetooth 5 support in April 2017. In September 2017, iPhone 8, 8 Plus and iPhone X launched with Bluetooth 5 support as well. Marketing drops the point number; so that it is just "Bluetooth 5" (not 5.0 or LE like Bluetooth 4.0). The change is for the sake of "Simplifying our marketing, communicating user benefits more effectively and making it easier to signal significant technology updates to the market."

Bluetooth 5 provides, for BLE, options that can double the speed (2 Mbit/s burst) at the expense of range, or up to a fourfold the range at the expense of data rate, and eightfold the data broadcasting capacity of transmissions, by increasing the packet lengths. The increase in transmissions could be important for <a href="Internet%20of%20Things">Internet of Things</a> devices, where many nodes connect throughout a whole house. Bluetooth 5 adds functionality for connectionless services such as location-relevant navigation of low-energy Bluetooth connections.

The major areas of improvement are:

Features Added in CSA5 - Integrated in v5.0:

The following features were removed in this version of the specification:

Bluetooth is defined as a layer protocol architecture consisting of core protocols, cable replacement protocols, telephony control protocols, and adopted protocols. Mandatory protocols for all Bluetooth stacks are LMP, L2CAP and SDP. In addition, devices that communicate with Bluetooth almost universally can use these protocols: <a href="Bluetooth%20protocols%23Host/controller%20interface%20%28HCI%29">HCI</a> and RFCOMM.

The "Link Management Protocol" (LMP) is used for set-up and control of the radio link between two devices. Implemented on the controller.

The "Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol" (L2CAP) is used to multiplex multiple logical connections between two devices using different higher level protocols.
Provides segmentation and reassembly of on-air packets.

In "Basic" mode, L2CAP provides packets with a payload configurable up to 64 kB, with 672 bytes as the default <a href="Maximum%20transmission%20unit">MTU</a>, and 48 bytes as the minimum mandatory supported MTU.

In "Retransmission and Flow Control" modes, L2CAP can be configured either for isochronous data or reliable data per channel by performing retransmissions and CRC checks.

Bluetooth Core Specification Addendum 1 adds two additional L2CAP modes to the core specification. These modes effectively deprecate original Retransmission and Flow Control modes:

Reliability in any of these modes is optionally and/or additionally guaranteed by the lower layer Bluetooth BDR/EDR air interface by configuring the number of retransmissions and flush timeout (time after which the radio flushes packets). In-order sequencing is guaranteed by the lower layer.

Only L2CAP channels configured in ERTM or SM may be operated over AMP logical links.

The "Service Discovery Protocol" (SDP) allows a device to discover services offered by other devices, and their associated parameters. For example, when you use a mobile phone with a Bluetooth headset, the phone uses SDP to determine which <a href="Bluetooth%20profile">Bluetooth profile</a>s the headset can use (Headset Profile, Hands Free Profile, <a href="Advanced%20Audio%20Distribution%20Profile">Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP)</a> etc.) and the protocol multiplexer settings needed for the phone to connect to the headset using each of them. Each service is identified by a <a href="Universally%20Unique%20Identifier">Universally Unique Identifier</a> (UUID), with official services (Bluetooth profiles) assigned a short form UUID (16 bits rather than the full 128).

"Radio Frequency Communications" (RFCOMM) is a cable replacement protocol used for generating a virtual serial data stream. RFCOMM provides for binary data transport and emulates <a href="EIA-232">EIA-232</a> (formerly RS-232) control signals over the Bluetooth baseband layer, i.e. it is a serial port emulation.

RFCOMM provides a simple reliable data stream to the user, similar to TCP. It is used directly by many telephony related profiles as a carrier for AT commands, as well as being a transport layer for OBEX over Bluetooth.

Many Bluetooth applications use RFCOMM because of its widespread support and publicly available API on most operating systems. Additionally, applications that used a serial port to communicate can be quickly ported to use RFCOMM.

The "Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol" (BNEP) is used for transferring another protocol stack's data via an L2CAP channel.
Its main purpose is the transmission of IP packets in the Personal Area Networking Profile.
BNEP performs a similar function to <a href="Subnetwork%20Access%20Protocol">SNAP</a> in Wireless LAN.

The "Audio/Video Control Transport Protocol" (AVCTP) is used by the remote control profile to transfer AV/C commands over an L2CAP channel. The music control buttons on a stereo headset use this protocol to control the music player.

The "Audio/Video Distribution Transport Protocol" (AVDTP) is used by the advanced audio distribution profile to stream music to stereo headsets over an L2CAP channel intended for video distribution profile in the Bluetooth transmission.

The "Telephony Control Protocol – Binary" (TCS BIN) is the bit-oriented protocol that defines the call control signaling for the establishment of voice and data calls between Bluetooth devices. Additionally, "TCS BIN defines mobility management procedures for handling groups of Bluetooth TCS devices."

TCS-BIN is only used by the cordless telephony profile, which failed to attract implementers. As such it is only of historical interest.

Adopted protocols are defined by other standards-making organizations and incorporated into Bluetooth’s protocol stack, allowing Bluetooth to code protocols only when necessary. The adopted protocols include:

Depending on packet type, individual packets may be protected by <a href="error%20correction">error correction</a>, either 1/3 rate <a href="forward%20error%20correction">forward error correction</a> (FEC) or 2/3 rate. In addition, packets with CRC will be retransmitted until acknowledged by <a href="automatic%20repeat%20request">automatic repeat request</a> (ARQ).

Any Bluetooth device in "discoverable mode" transmits the following information on demand:

Any device may perform an inquiry to find other devices to connect to, and any device can be configured to respond to such inquiries. However, if the device trying to connect knows the address of the device, it always responds to direct connection requests and transmits the information shown in the list above if requested. Use of a device's services may require pairing or acceptance by its owner, but the connection itself can be initiated by any device and held until it goes out of range. Some devices can be connected to only one device at a time, and connecting to them prevents them from connecting to other devices and appearing in inquiries until they disconnect from the other device.

Every device has a <a href="MAC%20address">unique 48-bit address</a>. However, these addresses are generally not shown in inquiries. Instead, friendly Bluetooth names are used, which can be set by the user. This name appears when another user scans for devices and in lists of paired devices.

Most cellular phones have the Bluetooth name set to the manufacturer and model of the phone by default. Most cellular phones and laptops show only the Bluetooth names and special programs are required to get additional information about remote devices. This can be confusing as, for example, there could be several cellular phones in range named <a href="Sony%20Ericsson%20T610">T610</a> (see <a href="Bluejacking">Bluejacking</a>).

Many services offered over Bluetooth can expose private data or let a connecting party control the Bluetooth device. Security reasons make it necessary to recognize specific devices, and thus enable control over which devices can connect to a given Bluetooth device. At the same time, it is useful for Bluetooth devices to be able to establish a connection without user intervention (for example, as soon as in range).

To resolve this conflict, Bluetooth uses a process called "bonding", and a bond is generated through a process called "pairing". The pairing process is triggered either by a specific request from a user to generate a bond (for example, the user explicitly requests to "Add a Bluetooth device"), or it is triggered automatically when connecting to a service where (for the first time) the identity of a device is required for security purposes. These two cases are referred to as dedicated bonding and general bonding respectively.

Pairing often involves some level of user interaction. This user interaction confirms the identity of the devices. When pairing successfully completes, a bond forms between the two devices, enabling those two devices to connect to each other in the future without repeating the pairing process to confirm device identities. When desired, the user can remove the bonding relationship.

During pairing, the two devices establish a relationship by creating a <a href="shared%20secret">shared secret</a> known as a "link key". If both devices store the same link key, they are said to be "paired" or "bonded". A device that wants to communicate only with a bonded device can <a href="cryptography">cryptographically</a> <a href="authentication">authenticate</a> the identity of the other device, ensuring it is the same device it previously paired with. Once a link key is generated, an authenticated <a href="Asynchronous%20Connection-Less">Asynchronous Connection-Less</a> (ACL) link between the devices may be <a href="encryption">encrypted</a> to protect exchanged data against <a href="eavesdropping">eavesdropping</a>. Users can delete link keys from either device, which removes the bond between the devices—so it is possible for one device to have a stored link key for a device it is no longer paired with.

Bluetooth services generally require either encryption or authentication and as such require pairing before they let a remote device connect. Some services, such as the Object Push Profile, elect not to explicitly require authentication or encryption so that pairing does not interfere with the user experience associated with the service use-cases.

Pairing mechanisms changed significantly with the introduction of Secure Simple Pairing in Bluetooth v2.1. The following summarizes the pairing mechanisms:

SSP is considered simple for the following reasons:

Prior to Bluetooth v2.1, encryption is not required and can be turned off at any time. Moreover, the encryption key is only good for approximately 23.5 hours; using a single encryption key longer than this time allows simple <a href="Stream%20cipher%20attack">XOR attacks</a> to retrieve the encryption key.
Bluetooth v2.1 addresses this in the following ways:
Link keys may be stored on the device file system, not on the Bluetooth chip itself. Many Bluetooth chip manufacturers let link keys be stored on the device—however, if the device is removable, this means that the link key moves with the device.

Bluetooth implements <a href="confidentiality">confidentiality</a>, <a href="authentication">authentication</a> and <a href="key%20%28cryptography%29">key</a> derivation with custom algorithms based on the <a href="SAFER">SAFER+</a> <a href="block%20cipher">block cipher</a>. Bluetooth key generation is generally based on a Bluetooth PIN, which must be entered into both devices. This procedure might be modified if one of the devices has a fixed PIN (e.g., for headsets or similar devices with a restricted user interface). During pairing, an initialization key or master key is generated, using the E22 algorithm.
The <a href="E0%20%28cipher%29">E0</a> stream cipher is used for encrypting packets, granting confidentiality, and is based on a shared cryptographic secret, namely a previously generated link key or master key. Those keys, used for subsequent encryption of data sent via the air interface, rely on the Bluetooth PIN, which has been entered into one or both devices.

An overview of Bluetooth vulnerabilities exploits was published in 2007 by Andreas Becker.

In September 2008, the <a href="National%20Institute%20of%20Standards%20and%20Technology">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) published a Guide to Bluetooth Security as a reference for organizations. It describes Bluetooth security capabilities and how to secure Bluetooth technologies effectively. While Bluetooth has its benefits, it is susceptible to denial-of-service attacks, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, message modification, and resource misappropriation. Users and organizations must evaluate their acceptable level of risk and incorporate security into the lifecycle of Bluetooth devices. To help mitigate risks, included in the NIST document are security checklists with guidelines and recommendations for creating and maintaining secure Bluetooth piconets, headsets, and smart card readers.

Bluetooth v2.1 – finalized in 2007 with consumer devices first appearing in 2009 – makes significant changes to Bluetooth's security, including pairing. See the <a href="%23Pairing%20mechanisms">pairing mechanisms</a> section for more about these changes.

Bluejacking is the sending of either a picture or a message from one user to an unsuspecting user through Bluetooth wireless technology. Common applications include short messages, e.g., "You've just been bluejacked!" Bluejacking does not involve the removal or alteration of any data from the device. Bluejacking can also involve taking control of a mobile device wirelessly and phoning a premium rate line, owned by the bluejacker. Security advances have alleviated this issue.

In 2001, Jakobsson and Wetzel from <a href="Bell%20Laboratories">Bell Laboratories</a> discovered flaws in the Bluetooth pairing protocol and also pointed to vulnerabilities in the encryption scheme. In 2003, Ben and Adam Laurie from A.L. Digital Ltd. discovered that serious flaws in some poor implementations of Bluetooth security may lead to disclosure of personal data. In a subsequent experiment, Martin Herfurt from the trifinite.group was able to do a field-trial at the <a href="CeBIT">CeBIT</a> fairgrounds, showing the importance of the problem to the world. A new attack called <a href="Bluebugging">BlueBug</a> was used for this experiment. In 2004 the first purported <a href="computer%20virus">virus</a> using Bluetooth to spread itself among mobile phones appeared on the <a href="Symbian%20OS">Symbian OS</a>.
The virus was first described by <a href="Kaspersky%20Lab">Kaspersky Lab</a> and requires users to confirm the installation of unknown software before it can propagate. The virus was written as a proof-of-concept by a group of virus writers known as "29A" and sent to anti-virus groups. Thus, it should be regarded as a potential (but not real) security threat to Bluetooth technology or <a href="Symbian%20OS">Symbian OS</a> since the virus has never spread outside of this system. In August 2004, a world-record-setting experiment (see also <a href="Bluetooth%20sniping">Bluetooth sniping</a>) showed that the range of Class 2 Bluetooth radios could be extended to with directional antennas and signal amplifiers.
This poses a potential security threat because it enables attackers to access vulnerable Bluetooth devices from a distance beyond expectation. The attacker must also be able to receive information from the victim to set up a connection. No attack can be made against a Bluetooth device unless the attacker knows its Bluetooth address and which channels to transmit on, although these can be deduced within a few minutes if the device is in use.

In January 2005, a mobile <a href="malware">malware</a> worm known as Lasco surfaced. The worm began targeting mobile phones using <a href="Symbian%20OS">Symbian OS</a> (<a href="S60%20%28software%20platform%29">Series 60 platform</a>) using Bluetooth enabled devices to replicate itself and spread to other devices. The worm is self-installing and begins once the mobile user approves the transfer of the file (velasco.sis) from another device. Once installed, the worm begins looking for other Bluetooth enabled devices to infect. Additionally, the worm infects other <a href=".SIS">.SIS</a> files on the device, allowing replication to another device through use of removable media (<a href="Secure%20Digital">Secure Digital</a>, <a href="Compact%20Flash">Compact Flash</a>, etc.). The worm can render the mobile device unstable.

In April 2005, <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a> security researchers published results of their actual implementation of passive attacks against the <a href="Personal%20identification%20number">PIN-based</a> pairing between commercial Bluetooth devices. They confirmed that attacks are practicably fast, and the Bluetooth symmetric key establishment method is vulnerable. To rectify this vulnerability, they designed an implementation that showed that stronger, asymmetric key establishment is feasible for certain classes of devices, such as mobile phones.

In June 2005, Yaniv Shaked and Avishai Wool published a paper describing both passive and active methods for obtaining the PIN for a Bluetooth link. The passive attack allows a suitably equipped attacker to eavesdrop on communications and spoof, if the attacker was present at the time of initial pairing. The active method makes use of a specially constructed message that must be inserted at a specific point in the protocol, to make the master and slave repeat the pairing process. After that, the first method can be used to crack the PIN. This attack's major weakness is that it requires the user of the devices under attack to re-enter the PIN during the attack when the device prompts them to. Also, this active attack probably requires custom hardware, since most commercially available Bluetooth devices are not capable of the timing necessary.

In August 2005, police in <a href="Cambridgeshire">Cambridgeshire</a>, England, issued warnings about thieves using Bluetooth enabled phones to track other devices left in cars. Police are advising users to ensure that any mobile networking connections are de-activated if laptops and other devices are left in this way.

In April 2006, researchers from <a href="Secure%20Network">Secure Network</a> and <a href="F-Secure">F-Secure</a> published a report that warns of the large number of devices left in a visible state, and issued statistics on the spread of various Bluetooth services and the ease of spread of an eventual Bluetooth worm.

In October 2006, at the Luxemburgish Hack.lu Security Conference, Kevin Finistere and Thierry Zoller demonstrated and released a remote root shell via Bluetooth on Mac OS X v10.3.9 and v10.4. They also demonstrated the first Bluetooth PIN and Linkkeys cracker, which is based on the research of Wool and Shaked.

2017

In April 2017, security researchers at Armis discovered multiple exploits in firmware used by Bluetooth, the collections of which called BlueBorne. These exploits allowed them to connect to various devices without authentication and giving them "virtually full control over the device". Armis contacted Google, Microsoft, Apple, Samsung and the Linux developers so they could patch their software before the coordinated disclosure on September 12, 2017.

Options to mitigate against Bluetooth security attacks include:

Bluetooth uses the <a href="microwave">microwave</a> <a href="radio%20frequency">radio frequency</a> spectrum in the 2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz range, which is non-ionizing radiation, of similar bandwidth to the one used by wireless and mobile phones. No specific demonstration of harm has been demonstrated up to date, even if wireless transmission has been included by <a href="International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer">IARC</a> in the possible <a href="carcinogen">carcinogen</a> list. Maximum power output from a Bluetooth radio is 100 <a href="Milliwatt%23Multiples">mW</a> for class 1, 2.5 mW for class 2, and 1 mW for class 3 devices. Even the maximum power output of class 1 is a lower level than the lowest-powered mobile phones. <a href="UMTS">UMTS</a> and <a href="W-CDMA">W-CDMA</a> output 250 mW, <a href="GSM%20frequency%20bands">GSM1800/1900</a> outputs 1000 mW, and <a href="GSM%20frequency%20bands">GSM850/900</a> outputs 2000 mW.

The Bluetooth Innovation World Cup, a marketing initiative of the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), was an international competition that encouraged the development of innovations for applications leveraging Bluetooth technology in sports, fitness and health care products. The aim of the competition was to stimulate new markets.

The Bluetooth Innovation World Cup morphed into the Bluetooth Breakthrough Awards in 2013. The Breakthrough Awards Bluetooth program highlights the most innovative products and applications available today, prototypes coming soon, and student-led projects in the making.

Bluetooth Special Interest Group

The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) is the <a href="standards%20organisation">body</a> that oversees the development of <a href="Bluetooth">Bluetooth</a> <a href="standardization">standards</a> and the licensing of the Bluetooth technologies and <a href="trademark">trademark</a>s to manufacturers. The SIG is a not-for-profit, non-stock corporation founded in September 1998. The SIG is headquartered in <a href="Kirkland%2C%20Washington">Kirkland</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>. The SIG has local offices in Beijing, Seoul, Tokyo, and Malmö.

The SIG does not make, manufacture or sell Bluetooth enabled products.

"Bluetooth" technology provides a way to exchange information between <a href="wireless">wireless</a> devices such as <a href="personal%20digital%20assistant">personal digital assistant</a>s (PDAs), <a href="mobile%20phone">mobile phone</a>s, <a href="laptop">laptop</a>s, <a href="computer">computer</a>s, <a href="Computer%20printer">printers</a> and <a href="digital%20camera">digital camera</a>s via a secure, low-cost, globally available short-range <a href="radio">radio</a> <a href="frequency">frequency</a> band. Originally developed by <a href="Ericsson">Ericsson</a>, "Bluetooth" technology is now used in many different products by many different <a href="Manufacturing">manufacturers</a>. These manufacturers must be either Associate or Promoter members of(see below) the Bluetooth SIG before they are granted early access to the "Bluetooth" specifications, but published "Bluetooth" specifications are available online via the Bluetooth SIG Website <a href="http%3A//www.bluetooth.com/ENGLISH/TECHNOLOGY/Pages/default.aspx"></a>.

The SIG owns the "Bluetooth" word mark, figure mark and combination mark. These trademarks are licensed out for use to companies that are incorporating "Bluetooth" wireless technology into their products. To become a licensee, a company must become a member of the Bluetooth SIG. The SIG also manages the Bluetooth SIG Qualification program, a certification process required for any product using "Bluetooth" wireless technology and a pre-condition of the intellectual property license for "Bluetooth" technology. The main tasks for the SIG are to publish the "Bluetooth" specifications, protect the "Bluetooth" trademarks and evangelize "Bluetooth" wireless technology. In 2016, the SIG introduced a new visual and creative identity to support Bluetooth technology as the catalyst for the Internet of Things (IoT). This change included an updated logo, a new tagline and deprecation of the Bluetooth Smart and Bluetooth Smart Ready logos <a href="https%3A//www.bluetooth.com/marketing-branding/brand-best-practices-guidelines"></a>.

At its inception in 1998, the Bluetooth SIG was primarily run by a staff effectively seconded from its member companies. In 2001 Tom Siep served as the group's Managing Director and from 2002-2004 Mike McCamon led the group as its Executive Director. In 2004 he was replaced by <a href="Michael%20W.%20Foley">Michael W. Foley</a> (Mike). In mid-2012, Mark Powell took the reins as the SIG's current Executive Director. Beginning in 2002 a professional staff was hired, composed of operations, <a href="engineering">engineering</a> and <a href="marketing">marketing</a> specialists. From 2002-2004 the Bluetooth SIG was based in <a href="Overland%20Park%2C%20Kansas">Overland Park, Kansas</a> USA and is now based in <a href="Kirkland%2C%20Washington">Kirkland, Washington</a>. In addition to its professional staff, the SIG is supported by its more than 30,000 member companies <a href="https%3A//www.bluetooth.com"></a> who participate in the various working groups that produce the standardization documents and oversee the qualification process for new products and help to evangelize the technology.

The <a href="Special%20Interest%20Group">SIG</a> members participate in Study Groups, Expert Groups, Working Groups along with committees <a href="https%3A//www.bluetooth.com/membership-working-groups/working-groups/working-groups-committees"></a>.

The Study Groups carry out research into their various areas which informs the development of the Bluetooth specifications. They may eventually become Working Groups in their akhil own right.

The Expert Groups deal with issues of technical importance to all aspects of "Bluetooth" development. As with the Study Groups their work informs the Working Groups as well as the corporate groups. 
Participation in the Expert Groups is restricted to <a href="%23Promoter%20members">Promoter members</a> and <a href="%23Associate%20members">Associate members</a>.

The Working Groups develop new Bluetooth specifications and enhance adopted specifications. They are responsible for the vast majority of published standards and specifications. Participation in the Working Groups is restricted to <a href="%23Promoter%20members">Promoter members</a> and <a href="%23Associate%20members">Associate members</a>.

The committees of the SIG deal with the other aspects of licensing, marketing and review including developing and maintaining the Qualification Process, oversight of the "Bluetooth" specifications, and developing, improving and maintaining the test methodology and concepts as well as other strategic functions.

Any company incorporating "Bluetooth" wireless technology into products, using the technology to offer goods and services or simply re-branding a product with "Bluetooth" technology must become a member of the Bluetooth SIG. There are three levels of corporate membership totaling more than 20,000 members, and individuals from member companies may also participate.

These members are the most active in the SIG and have considerable influence over both the strategic and technological directions of Bluetooth as a whole. The current promoter members are:

Each Promoter member has one seat (and one vote) on the Board of Directors and the Qualification Review Board (the body responsible for developing and maintaining the qualification process). They each may have multiple staff in the various working groups and committees that comprise the work of the SIG.

The SIG's website carries a <a href="https%3A//www.bluetooth.com/membership-working-groups/member-directory"></a> full list of members].

The Bluetooth SIG Associate membership fees have stayed the same since 2006. Associate membership is renewed annually and the yearly fee depends on the individual company's revenue. Companies with annual revenue in excess of $100M US are considered Large Associates and pay annual membership fees of $35,000 US. Small Associates are categorized as those organizations with revenue less than $100M US and join the SIG with an annual membership fee of $7,500 US. Associate members of the SIG get early access to draft specifications at versions 0.5 and 0.7 and are eligible to participate and gain a voting seat in working groups and committees—a key opportunity to work with other Associate and Promoter members on enhancing existing specifications. They are also eligible for enhanced marketing support, receive discounts on product qualification listings and SIG events including Bluetooth World and UnPlugFest (UPF) testing events.

Adopter membership in the SIG is free and entitles members to use published "Bluetooth " wireless specifications and "Bluetooth" trademarks. Adopter members do not have early access to unpublished specifications and may not participate in working groups or committees to influence the development of the technology.

Membership is not currently open to individuals.

Universities are accepted for membership. The person registering the institution must have the power and authority to accept the Membership Agreements <a href="https%3A//www.bluetooth.com/%7E/media/files/membership/membership_application.ashx%3Fla%3Den"></a> on behalf of the school. Note that students may not register their school, but may create user accounts on the SIG membership portal, <a href="https%3A//www.bluetooth.com">www.bluetooth.com</a>, that are associated with their school's existing SIG membership.

Next to the development of the technology itself, the qualification process is one of the most important aspects of "Bluetooth" technology, supporting interoperability, conformance to the Bluetooth specifications, and to strengthening the Bluetooth brand.

Members of the Bluetooth SIG must complete the qualification and declaration process for their Bluetooth enabled product(s) to demonstrate and declare compliance to the <a href="https%3A//www.bluetooth.com/membership-working-groups/why-how-to-become-a-member/membership-agreements">Membership Agreements</a>.

The primary objective of the qualification process is for members to demonstrate their product(s) compliance to the adopted specifications through testing and documentation. After qualification is completed, members need to complete the declaration process. Members declare their compliance to both the Bluetooth Patent/Copyright License Agreement and Bluetooth Trademark License Agreement (“BTLA”).

An overview of both processes including steps of the processes, types and fees is available on the <a href="https%3A//www.bluetooth.com/develop-with-bluetooth/qualification-listing">Bluetooth SIG public portal</a>.

Bluetooth Qualification Experts (BQEs) and Bluetooth Qualification Test Facilities (BQTFs) are available to support members through the processes. Members uncertain or unfamiliar with the qualification process are encouraged to consider using one or both of these service types.

Boney M.

Boney M. is a <a href="vocal%20group">vocal group</a> created by <a href="Germans">German</a> record producer <a href="Frank%20Farian">Frank Farian</a>. Originally based in <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>, the four original members of the group's official line-up were <a href="Liz%20Mitchell">Liz Mitchell</a> and <a href="Marcia%20Barrett">Marcia Barrett</a> from <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, <a href="Maizie%20Williams">Maizie Williams</a> from <a href="Montserrat">Montserrat</a> and <a href="Bobby%20Farrell">Bobby Farrell</a> from <a href="Aruba">Aruba</a>. The group was formed in 1976 and achieved popularity during the <a href="disco">disco</a> era of the late 1970s. Since the 1980s, various line-ups of the band have performed with different personnel.

With more than 150 million records sold, they are one of <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20music%20artists">the best-selling artists of all time</a>.

German singer-songwriter <a href="Frank%20Farian">Frank Farian</a> (real name Franz Reuther) recorded the dance track "<a href="Baby%20Do%20You%20Wanna%20Bump">Baby Do You Wanna Bump</a>" in December 1974. Farian sang the repeated line "Do you do you wanna bump?" in a deep voice (entirely studio created) as well as performing the high <a href="falsetto">falsetto</a> chorus. When the record was released as a single, it was credited to "Boney M.", a pseudonym Farian had created for himself after watching the Australian detective show "<a href="Boney%20%28TV%20series%29">Boney</a>".

After a slow start, the song became a hit in the Netherlands and Belgium. It was then that Farian decided to hire performers to 'front' the group for TV performances. Farian found <a href="Maizie%20Williams">Maizie Williams</a> (originally from <a href="Montserrat">Montserrat</a>) who brought in <a href="Bobby%20Farrell">Bobby Farrell</a>, a male exotic dancer from <a href="Aruba">Aruba</a>. Singer <a href="Marcia%20Barrett">Marcia Barrett</a> (also from Jamaica) joined the group, who brought in <a href="Liz%20Mitchell">Liz Mitchell</a>, former member of the <a href="Les%20Humphries%20Singers">Les Humphries Singers</a> and Boney M was finalised.

Boney M.'s first album, "<a href="Take%20the%20Heat%20off%20Me">Take the Heat off Me</a>", was released in 1976. It contained tracks that Marcia Barrett had already recorded with Farian, including the title track and "Lovin' or Leavin'", both of which were previously recorded in German by another Farian act, <a href="Gilla%20%28singer%29">Gilla</a>. As Maizie Williams' voice wasn't considered suitable for recording purposes by Farian, and a try-out with Bobby Farrell performing "<a href="No%20Woman%20No%20Cry">No Woman No Cry</a>" didn't work, Farian decided to use only Liz Mitchell and Marcia Barrett along with his own studio-enhanced voice to create the Boney M. sound.

The album's commercial performance was initially lukewarm. However, the group rigorously toured discos, clubs and even country fairs to earn a reputation for themselves. The group's big break came when, at the end of summer 1976, German television producer Michael 'Mike' Leckebusch (of <a href="Radio%20Bremen">Radio Bremen</a>) requested the group for his show "<a href="Musikladen">Musikladen</a>". Boney M. appeared on the live music show on 18 September 1976, after 10 pm and in their daring stage costumes, where they performed the song "<a href="Daddy%20Cool%20%28Boney%20M.%20song%29">Daddy Cool</a>". The song quickly went to no.1 in Germany, with the album following the success of the single. Another single, "<a href="Sunny%20%28song%29">Sunny</a>" (a cover of the 1966 <a href="Bobby%20Hebb">Bobby Hebb</a> song) gave the group their second no.1 hit. The group's popularity had also grown throughout Europe, with "Daddy Cool" reaching no.1 in Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, and Austria. Both singles were also Top 10 hits in the UK, which would become one of their biggest markets.

In 1977, Boney M. released their second album, "<a href="Love%20for%20Sale%20%28Boney%20M.%20album%29">Love for Sale</a>", which contained the hits "<a href="Ma%20Baker">Ma Baker</a>" and "<a href="Belfast%20%28Boney%20M.%20song%29">Belfast</a>". The group embarked on their first major concert tours with a live band of musicians called 'The Black Beauty Circus' (given their name after Maizie Williams' first band, 'Black Beautiful People'). "<a href="Love%20for%20Sale%20%28Boney%20M.%20album%29">Love for Sale</a>" was certified Gold a year after its release in the UK. Both singles from the album reached no.1 in Germany and the UK Top 10.

1978 was the group's biggest year. They released a new double A-sided single, "<a href="Rivers%20of%20Babylon">Rivers of Babylon</a>/<a href="Brown%20Girl%20in%20the%20Ring%20%28song%29">Brown Girl in the Ring</a>", which became a massive hit all over Europe, reaching No. 1 in several countries as well as becoming one of the biggest selling singles of all time in the UK. It also became their most successful single in the United States, peaking at No. 30 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">U.S. pop singles chart</a>. Following this came their biggest-selling album, "<a href="Nightflight%20to%20Venus">Nightflight to Venus</a>", which spawned further hit singles with "<a href="Rasputin%20%28song%29">Rasputin</a>" and "<a href="Painter%20Man">Painter Man</a>". Continuing with their success, they released "<a href="Mary%27s%20Boy%20Child%20%26amp%3Bndash%3B%20Oh%20My%20Lord">Mary's Boy Child – Oh My Lord</a>", which was the 1978 <a href="List%20of%20Christmas%20number%20one%20singles%20%28UK%29">Christmas number one single</a> in the United Kingdom and became another of the biggest selling singles of all time there. Also during 1978, Boney M. made a much publicized promotional visit to the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, one of the very few Western acts along with <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a> to do so, although tracks like "Rasputin" were not released in the Soviet Union due to their lyrics.

While it had never been a secret that Bobby Farrell never sang on the group's records (Farian did the male vocals in the studio), in 1978 it became public knowledge that Maizie Williams did not sing on the studio recordings either since "her voice wasn't suited for this kind of music", as Farian stated in an interview with German teen magazine "<a href="Bravo%20%28magazine%29">Bravo</a>". Since this had become common practice within the disco genre of the late '70s, few people cared – unlike when Farian did the same thing with <a href="Milli%20Vanilli">Milli Vanilli</a> in the late 1980s. While only two of Boney M.'s official members actually contributed to the band's records, all four members of the group, including Williams and Farrell, performed the vocals live at Boney M. concerts. The band's live sound was also augmented by several backing vocalists, which served to enhance any vocal deficiencies the group may have had compared with the studio productions.

1979 saw Boney M. release a brand new single, "<a href="Hooray%21%20Hooray%21%20It%27s%20a%20Holi-Holiday">Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday</a>", which became another Top 10 hit across Europe. Later in the year they released their fourth album, "<a href="Oceans%20of%20Fantasy">Oceans of Fantasy</a>", containing two hit singles – <a href="El%20Lute%20/%20Gotta%20Go%20Home">"Gotta Go Home"/"El Lute"</a> and <a href="I%27m%20Born%20Again%20/%20Bahama%20Mama">"I'm Born Again"/"Bahama Mama"</a>. The album also included a "Lead" and "Backing Vocals" credit for the first time. "Oceans of Fantasy" reached no.1 in the UK and was certified Platinum, though their run of Top 10 singles had now ended with "Gotta Go Home" peaking at no.12 and "I'm Born Again" peaking at 35.

In 1980, Boney M. released a greatest hits album, "<a href="The%20Magic%20of%20Boney%20M.%20%26amp%3Bndash%3B%2020%20Golden%20Hits">The Magic of Boney M. – 20 Golden Hits</a>", which also contained two new songs, "My Friend Jack" and "I See a Boat on the River". It made the No. 1 spot in the UK, reaching Gold status within six weeks of release, though it was their last big-selling album in the UK.

Boney M.'s fifth album had been scheduled for release in November 1980 but the recording sessions dragged on all through 1981. When "<a href="Boonoonoonoos">Boonoonoonoos</a>" was finally released by the end of that year, Bobby Farrell was fired from the group due to his unreliability. While still a healthy seller in continental Europe, "Boonoonoonoos" failed to crack the UK Top 100 after three consecutive No. 1 albums, and Farrell's departure left the group unable to promote it. Following this, the group released a "Christmas Album".

<a href="Reggie%20Tsiboe">Reggie Tsiboe</a> was hired to replace Farrell as the new male member of Boney M. in 1982 but the singles "The Carnival Is Over" and "Jambo" fared poorly, and the group's seventh album "<a href="Ten%20Thousand%20Lightyears">Ten Thousand Lightyears</a>", issued in 1984, marked another commercial low point peaking at #23 in the German album charts. The group, however, returned to the German Top 20 in the autumn of 1984 with "Kalimba de Luna" (a Top 10 hit in France) and "Happy Song", the latter seeing Bobby Farrell return to the group. Both songs were carbon-copies of the original Italian hits by <a href="Tony%20Esposito%20%28musician%29">Tony Esposito</a> and <a href="Baby%27s%20Gang">Baby's Gang</a> respectively.

By 1985, Farian clearly began losing interest in the group, and their final and eighth studio album "<a href="Eye%20Dance">Eye Dance</a>" was widely regarded as uninspired and disappointing. After celebrating Boney M.'s 10th anniversary in early 1986, the group officially disbanded after the release of the commercially unsuccessful single 'Young, Free and Single' (still: #49 in the German charts).

From this point, different versions of the group were formed by members, some with cooperation of Farian, others without (for example by independently obtaining the rights to use the Boney M. name in a different country). One version began touring in the first half of 1987 with Marilyn Scharbaai (Carrilho) taking Liz Mitchell's place. Mitchell returned for a second leg of the tour late 1987, and Marcia Barrett soon left the band. At the same time, Bobby Farrell had set up a deal for a new Boney M. album to be recorded without Farian in Belgium. When Farrell failed to show up for either recording or tour, and Maizie Williams had never sung on record, the album ended up being released as Liz Mitchell's first solo album "No One Will Force You". Mitchell and Williams completed a tour during 1987–88, adding singer Celena Duncan and Ron Gale as replacements for Barrett and Farrell. Carol Grey later replaced Celena Duncan and Curt De Daran later replaced Ron Gale.

In October 1988, the classic Boney M. line-up reunited without producer Frank Farian for the album "<a href="Greatest%20Hits%20of%20All%20Times%20%26amp%3Bndash%3B%20Remix%20%2788">Greatest Hits of All Times – Remix '88</a>" but tensions ran high between the members, and Liz Mitchell left in the spring of 1989 to be replaced by <a href="Madeleine%20Davis">Madeleine Davis</a>. While Mitchell promoted her solo album, the group recorded the single "<a href="Everybody%20Wants%20to%20Dance%20Like%20Josephine%20Baker">Everybody Wants to Dance Like Josephine Baker</a>", without Farian's knowledge or approval. Threatened with legal action by the producer over the use of the Boney M. name, the single was subsequently withdrawn and Farian issued "Stories" with his own new Boney M. line-up featuring Liz Mitchell, Reggie Tsiboe and two new members, Sharon Stevens and Patty Onoyewenjo, "Stories" peaked at #11 in the Swiss charts. A second remix album "<a href="Greatest%20Hits%20of%20All%20Times%20%26amp%3Bndash%3B%20Remix%20%2789%20%26amp%3Bndash%3B%20Volume%20II">Greatest Hits of All Times – Remix '89 – Volume II</a>" was released but fared poorly.

1992 saw a renewed interest in Boney M.'s music with the "Boney M. Megamix" single returning the group to the UK Top 10 for the first time since 1980, and a subsequent Greatest Hits album reaching the UK Top 20 in 1993. While Marcia Barrett, now residing in Florida, was battling cancer and unable to perform, Boney M. toured the world with a line-up of Liz Mitchell, Carol Grey, Patricia Lorna Foster and Curt Dee Daran (replaced by Tony Ashcroft in 1994). They released the single ‘Papa Chico’ but failed to chart. Maizie Williams assembled her own Boney M. line-up with her friend and short-time Boney M. member in the early days in 1975, <a href="Sheyla%20Bonnick">Sheyla Bonnick</a>, and two others. Bobby Farrell also toured with three ever changing female performers.

Liz Mitchell was touring the world with her line-up of Boney M., which is the only line-up officially supported by Farian (the court ruling of 1990 stated that all four members are entitled to perform their own Boney M. shows). Bobby Farrell and Liz Mitchell have released solo albums containing their own re-recordings of Boney M.'s classic hits. Maizie Williams released her first solo album in 2006 and her own single version of Boney M.'s "Sunny". In 2007 her rendition of 'Daddy Cool' with <a href="Melo-M">Melo-M</a> hit the number one spot in the Latvian (LMK) Charts. Marcia Barrett has released two solo albums with a third scheduled for release in 2010.

As recounted in his 1988 book "<a href="Touching%20the%20Void">Touching the Void</a>", the British climber <a href="Joe%20Simpson%20%28mountaineer%29">Joe Simpson</a> was subsequently to find the catchy tune of "Brown Girl in the Ring" haunting him in the final hours of his struggle to survive the descent of <a href="Siula%20Grande">Siula Grande</a> in the <a href="Andes">Andes</a>, and the song was later used in the 2003 film of "<a href="Touching%20the%20Void%20%28film%29">Touching the Void</a>" made by <a href="Kevin%20Macdonald%20%28director%29">Kevin Macdonald</a>. Simpson recalls: "I remember thinking, bloody hell, I'm going to die to Boney M".

A musical based on the music of Boney M., "<a href="Daddy%20Cool%20%28musical%29">Daddy Cool</a>", opened in London in August 2006 to mixed reviews and sluggish ticket sales, causing it to close in February 2007. From April to July 2007, the show played in a mobile theatre in Berlin, which was specially designed for it.

In April 2007, Australian pop singer Peter Wilson released a song co-written by <a href="Frank%20Farian">Frank Farian</a> entitled "<a href="Daddy%20Cool%20%28Boney%20M.%20song%29%23%26quot%3BDoin%27%20Fine%26quot%3B">Doin' Fine</a>". It is described as "paying tribute to the sound of Boney M." and features the famous string arrangement from their first number 1 hit, "<a href="Daddy%20Cool%20%28Boney%20M.%20song%29">Daddy Cool</a>".

Boney M. (featuring Marcia Barrett) made a live appearance at the 37th <a href="International%20Film%20Festival%20of%20India">International Film Festival of India</a> (IFFI), which took place on 23 November 2006 in <a href="Panaji">Panaji</a>, the state capital of <a href="Goa">Goa</a>, India. The group is also popular in the Vietnamese diaspora, and was featured in Thuy Nga music productions.

In the UK, a new album of their greatest hits, entitled "<a href="The%20Magic%20of%20Boney%20M.">The Magic of Boney M.</a>" was released via <a href="Bertelsmann%20Music%20Group">BMG</a> on 27 November 2006. Special additions to this release were a <a href="Mousse%20T.">Mousse T.</a> remix of "<a href="Sunny%20%28song%29">Sunny</a>" and a brand new song from 2006, featuring Liz Mitchell, entitled "A Moment of Love".

On 10 April 2007, Boney M.'s first four albums were reissued on compact disc with bonus tracks, this time also in the United States (the first time these were available to the U.S. music market since their original releases in the 1970s).

In September 2007, Boney M.'s last four original albums, "<a href="Boonoonoonoos">Boonoonoonoos</a>", "<a href="Ten%20Thousand%20Lightyears">Ten Thousand Lightyears</a>, <a href="Kalimba%20de%20Luna%20-%2016%20Happy%20Songs">Kalimba de Luna - 16 Happy Songs</a>" and "<a href="Eye%20Dance">Eye Dance</a>" were reissued on compact disc in Europe and the United States, all including bonus tracks. In November 2007, a new <a href="Christmas%20With%20Boney%20M.%20%282007%20Edition%29">Christmas compilation</a> was scheduled for release as well as the DVD "Fantastic Boney M. – On Stage and on the Road" featuring a live performance recorded in Vienna on 1 November 1977 (the DVD cover erroneously states it to be a live show from Hamburg), and a film from the band's 1981 visit to <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> (made to promote the "<a href="Boonoonoonoos">Boonoonoonoos</a>" album that year).

Bobby Farrell's Boney M. performed a concert at the Amphi in <a href="Ra%27anana">Ra'anana</a>, <a href="Israel">Israel</a> in May 2007. On 28 June 2007 Boney M. featuring Matthew Felsenfeld and Liz Mitchell performed at the "Oktiabrsky" concert hall in St. Petersburg, Russia. In September 2007, Maizie Williams' Boney M. line-up performed live at the Royal Albert Hall, UK, to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS in Africa, performing her own renditions of "Brown Girl in the Ring" and "Hooray! Hooray! It's a Holi-Holiday".

The legal rights to the name "Boney M." have been a matter of controversy, and even court cases, between the former members of the band and producer Frank Farian ever since the late 1980s. Farian, the man who in effect created the group, has continued to work with Liz Mitchell and her line-up all through the 1990s and 2000s. In January 2007, Zanillya Farrell (daughter of Bobby Farrell) and Yasmina Ayad-Saban (ex-wife of Farrell) renewed the trademark to the name Boney M. in Germany for a 10-year period.

In November 2008, French disco star <a href="Amanda%20Lear">Amanda Lear</a> recorded a version of "<a href="Daddy%20Cool%20%28Boney%20M.%20song%29%23%26quot%3BDoin%27%20Fine%26quot%3B">Doin' Fine</a>" for her new studio album, which she announced on French television is scheduled for release in spring 2009.

In January 2009 <a href="Frank%20Farian">Frank Farian</a> released a brand new single called "Felicidad America (Obama Obama)" under the name-check "Boney M. feat. Sherita O. & Yulee B." featuring two new vocalists. The song is a remake of the 1980 Boney M. classic <a href="Felicidad%20%28Margherita%29">Felicidad (Margherita)</a> with new vocals and re-written lyrics now referring to the new US president <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>.

In July 2010, Maizie Williams headlined a Boney M. performance at Ramallah's Cultural Palace, in the West Bank, as part of the Palestine International Festival. The band played "Daddy Cool", "Ma Baker" and "Brown Girl in the Ring", but refrained from playing "Rivers of Babylon", rumored to be at the event organizers' request because of its description of the Jewish yearning for Zion.

Bobby Farrell died at the age of 61 from heart failure on December 30th, 2010. His agent said Farrell was complaining of breathing problems after performing with his band the evening before. Farrell lived in Amsterdam until his death. The singer was found dead in a hotel room in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a>, Russia, where he had been performing.

It was announced in February 2014 that Maizie Williams' line-up of Boney M. would be touring Australia in June. They sang at Guilfest, Guildford, UK on 20 July, and Watchet Live music festival UK, on 24 August.

In March 2015 Farian released "Diamonds", a 3CD box celebrating the 40th anniversary of Boney M. It contained remastered versions of the original hit singles or of previously unreleased versions, a remix disc and the new digital single "Song of Joy" featuring Liz Mitchell. A major DVD set was also released.

They performed at <a href="Sligo">Sligo</a>'s Summer Festival on 7 August 2015.

In February 2017, they also performed at the closing ceremony of <a href="Patras%20Carnival">Patras Carnival</a> in <a href="Patras">Patras</a>, <a href="Greece">Greece</a>.

In 1978, "<a href="Rivers%20of%20Babylon">Rivers of Babylon</a>", a cover of a track by <a href="The%20Melodians">The Melodians</a> with lyrics partly based on <a href="Psalm%20137">Psalm 137</a> and partly on Psalm 19, became (at the time) the second highest-selling single of all time in the UK. After reaching No.1 for five weeks, "Rivers of Babylon" began dropping down the chart, at which point the <a href="B-side">B-side</a> "Brown Girl in the Ring" was given extensive radio airplay, and the single climbed back up the chart to No. 2. The single spent six months in the UK Top 40, including 19 weeks in the Top 10. It eventually sold over two million copies, the second single to do so, and is still one of only 7 to achieve this feat. (see <a href="List%20of%20million-selling%20singles%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">List of million-selling singles in the United Kingdom</a>)

The group achieved a second UK million-seller with their version of the <a href="calypso%20music">calypso</a> classic "<a href="Mary%27s%20Boy%20Child">Mary's Boy Child</a>", released as a medley "<a href="Mary%27s%20Boy%20Child%20%E2%80%93%20Oh%20My%20Lord">Mary's Boy Child – Oh My Lord</a>", which was previously a million-seller for <a href="Harry%20Belafonte">Harry Belafonte</a>. The single sold over 1.8 million copies, 1.6 million of which were in the four weeks the song was at No.1 in December 1978.

Boney M. are the only artists to appear twice in the top 11 <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20singles%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">best selling singles of all time in the UK</a>, with "Rivers of Babylon" in 7th place and "Mary's Boy Child/Oh My Lord" at number 11. They are also one of six artists to sell a million copies with two singles in the same year.

Compared to other best-selling artists of the 1970s like <a href="ABBA">ABBA</a>, <a href="Donna%20Summer">Donna Summer</a>, and the <a href="Bee%20Gees">Bee Gees</a>, the Boney M. discography is quite unusual – while the greater part of the band's back catalogue has been remixed, remade, remodeled and reissued all through the 80s, 90s and 2000s by producer Frank Farian and record company <a href="BMG-Ariola">BMG-Ariola</a> (now <a href="Sony%20Music">Sony Music</a>), most of the original 7" and 12" versions issued on vinyl in the 70s and early 80s remained unavailable on CD until 2008 and the release of the box set "<a href="The%20Collection%20%28Boney%20M.%20Box%20Set%29">The Collection</a>" and the single CD compilation "<a href="Rivers%20of%20Babylon%20%28A%20Best%20of%20Collection%29">Rivers of Babylon (A Best of Collection)</a>".

During the <a href="South%20Korean%20presidential%20election%2C%202002">2002 presidential election</a> campaign of South Korea, then-candidate <a href="Roh%20Moo-hyun">Roh Moo-hyun</a>, who eventually won the presidency at that event, took "Bahama Mama" to promote his aim of positive political reform.

The 2005 Chinese film "<a href="Shanghai%20Dreams">Shanghai Dreams</a>" features a scene depicting a rural Chinese disco in 1983, with teenagers dancing to "Rivers of Babylon" and "Gotta Go Home".

In the 2008 Kazakh film "<a href="Tulpan">Tulpan</a>", the tractor driver Boni continually plays a cassette of "Rivers of Babylon", an example of his fascination for all things Western.

In the 2008 Chinese film "<a href="Cheung%20Gong%207%20hou">Cheung Gong 7 hou</a>" (English title: "<a href="CJ7">CJ7</a>"), <a href="Sunny%20%28song%29">"Sunny"</a> is a vital part of the soundtrack.

Boney M was hugely popular in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in the 1970s, although the song "Rasputin" was banned by the Soviet authorities during the group's concert in Moscow in December 1978. In the Soviet film "<a href="Repentance%20%28film%29">Repentance</a>" (1987), "Sunny" is played at a party of high-ranked communist officials. "Sunny" is played during a few parts of the successful Korean film of the same name "Sunny" (2011). It is the theme song of the 2011 Taiwanese drama starring Rainie Yang and Wu Chun, "<a href="Sunshine%20Angel">Sunshine Angel</a>".

Blade Runner

Blade Runner is a 1982 American <a href="tech%20noir">neo-noir science fiction</a> film directed by <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a> and starring <a href="Harrison%20Ford">Harrison Ford</a>, <a href="Rutger%20Hauer">Rutger Hauer</a>, <a href="Sean%20Young">Sean Young</a>, and <a href="Edward%20James%20Olmos">Edward James Olmos</a>. The script was written by <a href="Hampton%20Fancher">Hampton Fancher</a> and <a href="David%20Peoples">David Peoples</a>, and is a loose <a href="film%20adaptation">adaptation</a> of the 1968 novel "<a href="Do%20Androids%20Dream%20of%20Electric%20Sheep%3F">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a>" by <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>. Set in a <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a>n <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> in 2019, the story depicts a future in which <a href="bioengineered">bioengineered</a> <a href="android%20%28robot%29">android</a>s known as <a href="replicant">replicant</a>s are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work on <a href="space%20colonization">off-world colonies</a>. When a renegade group of replicants led by <a href="Roy%20Batty">Roy Batty</a> (Hauer) escape back to Earth, burnt-out LA cop <a href="Rick%20Deckard">Rick Deckard</a> (Ford) reluctantly accepts one last assignment to hunt them down. During his investigations, Deckard meets <a href="List%20of%20Blade%20Runner%20characters%23Rachael">Rachael</a> (Young), an advanced replicant who causes him to question his mission.

"Blade Runner" initially underperformed in North American theaters and polarized critics; some praised its thematic complexity and visuals while others were displeased with its unconventional pacing and plot. In subsequent years, however, it has become an acclaimed <a href="cult%20film">cult film</a>. The year following its release, the film won the prestigious <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dramatic%20Presentation">Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation</a>. Hailed for its production design, depicting a "retrofitted" future, it remains a leading example of <a href="neo-noir">neo-noir</a> cinema. The <a href="Blade%20Runner%20%28soundtrack%29">film's soundtrack</a>, composed by <a href="Vangelis">Vangelis</a>, was critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">BAFTA</a> and <a href="Golden%20Globe">Golden Globe</a> as best original <a href="film%20score">score</a>. The film brought the work of Philip K. Dick to the attention of Hollywood, and several later films were based on his work. Ridley Scott regards "Blade Runner" as "probably" his most complete and personal film. In 1993, the movie was selected for preservation in the United States <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a> by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>, being deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". "Blade Runner" is now regarded by many critics as one of the <a href="Films%20considered%20the%20greatest%20ever">all-time best science fiction movies</a>.

<a href="Versions%20of%20Blade%20Runner">Seven versions of the film</a> have been shown for various markets as a result of controversial changes made by studio executives. A <a href="director%27s%20cut">director's cut</a> was released in 1992 after a strong response to test screenings of a <a href="workprint">workprint</a>. This, in conjunction with its popularity as a video rental, made it one of the first movies released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a>—a basic production with mediocre video and audio quality. In 2007, <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> released "<a href="Versions%20of%20Blade%20Runner%23The%20Final%20Cut%20%282007%29">The Final Cut</a>", a 25th anniversary digitally remastered version, the only one on which Scott had complete artistic freedom. This version was shown in selected theaters and subsequently released on DVD, <a href="HD%20DVD">HD DVD</a>, and <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a>. A sequel, "<a href="Blade%20Runner%202049">Blade Runner 2049</a>", is scheduled for release in October 2017.

In Los Angeles in November 2019, ex-police officer <a href="Rick%20Deckard">Rick Deckard</a> is detained by officer <a href="List%20of%20Blade%20Runner%20characters%23Gaff">Gaff</a> and brought to his former supervisor, <a href="List%20of%20Blade%20Runner%20characters%23Harry%20Bryant">Bryant</a>. Deckard, whose job as a "blade runner" was to track down bioengineered beings known as <a href="replicant">replicant</a>s and "retire" (a euphemism for killing) them, is informed that four have come to Earth illegally. As Tyrell Corporation Nexus-6 models, they have only a four-year lifespan and may have come to Earth to try to extend their lives.

Deckard watches a video of a blade runner named <a href="List%20of%20Blade%20Runner%20characters%23Dave%20Holden">Holden</a> administering the "Voight-Kampff" test designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional response to questions. The test subject, <a href="List%20of%20Blade%20Runner%20characters%23Leon%20Kowalski">Leon</a>, shoots Holden after Holden asks about Leon's mother. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and the other three replicants: <a href="List%20of%20Blade%20Runner%20characters%23Roy%20Batty">Roy Batty</a>, <a href="Characters%20in%20Blade%20Runner%23Zhora%20Salome">Zhora</a>, and <a href="List%20of%20Blade%20Runner%20characters%23Pris%20Stratton">Pris</a>. Deckard initially refuses, but after Bryant ambiguously threatens him, he reluctantly agrees.

Deckard begins his investigation at the Tyrell Corporation to ensure that the test works on Nexus-6 models. While there, he discovers that <a href="List%20of%20Blade%20Runner%20characters%23Dr.%20Eldon%20Tyrell">Eldon Tyrell</a>'s assistant <a href="List%20of%20Blade%20Runner%20characters%23Rachael">Rachael</a> is an experimental replicant who believes herself to be human. Rachael has been given false memories to provide an "emotional cushion". As a result, a more extensive test is required to determine whether she is a replicant.

Events are then set into motion that pit Deckard's search for the replicants against their search for Tyrell to force him to extend their lives. Roy and Leon investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory and learn of <a href="List%20of%20Blade%20Runner%20characters%23J.%20F.%20Sebastian">J. F. Sebastian</a>, a gifted genetic designer who works closely with Tyrell. Rachael visits Deckard at his apartment to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo, but after Deckard reveals that her memories are implants from Tyrell's niece, she leaves his apartment in tears. Meanwhile, Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust.

While searching Leon's hotel room, Deckard finds a photo of Zhora and a synthetic snake scale that leads him to a strip club where Zhora works. Deckard kills Zhora and shortly after is told by Bryant to also retire Rachael, who has disappeared from the Tyrell Corporation. After Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd, he is attacked by Leon, but Rachael kills Leon using Deckard's dropped pistol. The two return to Deckard's apartment, and during an intimate discussion, he promises not to hunt her; as she abruptly tries to leave, Deckard physically restrains her, forcing her to kiss him.

Arriving at Sebastian's apartment, Roy tells Pris the others are dead. Sympathetic to their plight, Sebastian reveals that because of "<a href="Methuselah">Methuselah</a> Syndrome", a genetic <a href="premature%20aging">premature aging</a> disorder, his life will also be cut short. Sebastian and Roy gain entrance into Tyrell's secure penthouse, where Roy demands more life from his maker. Tyrell tells him that it is impossible. Roy confesses that he has done "questionable things" which Tyrell dismisses, praising Roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life. Roy kisses Tyrell, then kills him. Sebastian runs for the elevator followed by Roy, who then rides the elevator down alone. Though not shown, it is implied by Bryant via police radio that Roy also kills Sebastian.

Upon entering Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but he manages to kill her just as Roy returns. As Roy starts to die, he chases Deckard through the building, ending up on the roof. Deckard tries to jump to an adjacent roof, but misses and is left hanging precariously between buildings. Roy makes the jump with ease, and as Deckard's grip loosens, Roy hoists him onto the roof, saving him. As Roy's life runs out, he delivers <a href="Tears%20in%20rain%20monologue">a monologue about how his memories "will be lost in time, like tears in rain"</a>; Roy dies in front of Deckard, who watches silently. Gaff arrives and shouts across to Deckard, "It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?" Deckard returns to his apartment and finds the door ajar, but Rachael is safe, asleep in his bed. As they leave, Deckard notices a small tin-foil <a href="origami">origami</a> unicorn on the floor, a familiar calling card that brings back to him Gaff's final words. Deckard and Rachael quickly leave the apartment block.


The film operates on multiple dramatic and narrative levels. It follows some conventions of <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>, among them the character of a "<a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a>"; narration by the protagonist, at least in the original release; <a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a> cinematography; and giving the hero a questionable moral outlook—extended to include reflections upon the nature of his own humanity. It is a literate science fiction film, thematically enfolding the philosophy of religion and moral implications of human mastery of <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a> in the context of <a href="Theatre%20of%20ancient%20Greece">classical Greek drama</a> and <a href="hubris">hubris</a>. It also draws on Biblical images, such as <a href="Genesis%20flood%20narrative">Noah's flood</a>, and literary sources, such as "<a href="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a>". Linguistically, the theme of mortality is subtly reiterated in the chess game between Sebastian and Tyrell, based on the famous <a href="Immortal%20Game">Immortal Game</a> of 1851, though Scott has said that was coincidental.

"Blade Runner" delves into the implications of technology on the environment and on society by reaching to the past, using literature, <a href="religious%20symbolism">religious symbolism</a>, classical dramatic themes, and film noir. This tension between past, present, and future is mirrored in the retrofitted future of "Blade Runner", which is high-tech and gleaming in places but decayed and old elsewhere. Ridley Scott described the film as: "extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel", in an interview by <a href="Lynn%20Barber">Lynn Barber</a> for the British Sunday newspaper "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" in 2002. Scott "liked the idea of exploring pain" in the wake of his brother's <a href="skin%20cancer">skin cancer</a> death: "When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me."

An aura of paranoia suffuses the film: corporate power looms large; the police seem omnipresent; vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings; and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are explored – especially the consequences for replicants of their implanted memories. Control over the environment is depicted as taking place on a vast scale, hand in hand with the absence of any natural life, with artificial animals substituting for their extinct predecessors. This oppressive backdrop explains the frequently referenced migration of humans to extraterrestrial ("off-world") colonies. The dystopian themes explored in "Blade Runner" are an early example of <a href="cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> concepts expanding into film. Eyes are a recurring motif, as are manipulated images, calling reality into question, and our ability to accurately perceive and remember it.

These thematic elements provide an atmosphere of uncertainty for "Blade Runner"s central theme of examining humanity. In order to discover replicants, an empathy test is used, with a number of its questions focused on the treatment of animals – seemingly an essential indicator of someone's "humanity". The replicants appear to show compassion and concern for one another and are juxtaposed against human characters who lack empathy while the mass of humanity on the streets is cold and impersonal. The film goes so far as to put in doubt whether Deckard is human, and forces the audience to re-evaluate what it means to be human.

The question of whether Deckard is intended to be a human or a replicant has been an ongoing controversy since the film's release. Both Michael Deeley and Harrison Ford wanted Deckard to be human while Hampton Fancher preferred ambiguity. Ridley Scott has confirmed that in his vision Deckard is a replicant.

Deckard's unicorn dream sequence, inserted into the "Director's Cut", coinciding with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn is seen by many as showing that Deckard is a replicant – as Gaff could have accessed Deckard's implanted memories. The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity, or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the film's main theme. The inherent ambiguity and uncertainty of the film, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from their own perspectives.

<a href="Casting%20%28performing%20arts%29">Casting</a> the film proved troublesome, particularly for the lead role of Deckard. Screenwriter Hampton Fancher envisioned <a href="Robert%20Mitchum">Robert Mitchum</a> as Deckard and wrote the character's dialogue with Mitchum in mind. Director Ridley Scott and the film's producers spent months meeting and discussing the role with <a href="Dustin%20Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a>, who eventually departed over differences in vision. Harrison Ford was ultimately chosen for several reasons, including his performance in the "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" films, Ford's interest in the "Blade Runner" story, and discussions with <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> who was finishing "<a href="Raiders%20of%20the%20Lost%20Ark">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>" at the time and strongly praised Ford's work in the film. Following his success in films like "Star Wars" (1977) and "Raiders of the Lost Ark" (1981), Ford was looking for a role with dramatic depth. According to production documents, several actors were considered for the role, including <a href="Gene%20Hackman">Gene Hackman</a>, <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a>, <a href="Jack%20Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>, <a href="Paul%20Newman">Paul Newman</a>, <a href="Clint%20Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>, <a href="Tommy%20Lee%20Jones">Tommy Lee Jones</a>, <a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, <a href="Al%20Pacino">Al Pacino</a>, and <a href="Burt%20Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a>.

One role that was not difficult to cast was <a href="Rutger%20Hauer">Rutger Hauer</a> as Roy Batty, the violent yet thoughtful leader of the replicants. Scott cast Hauer without having met him, based solely on Hauer's performances in <a href="Paul%20Verhoeven">Paul Verhoeven</a>'s movies Scott had seen ("<a href="Keetje%20Tippel">Katie Tippel</a>", "<a href="Soldier%20of%20Orange">Soldier of Orange</a>" and "<a href="Turkish%20Delight%20%281973%20film%29">Turkish Delight</a>"). Hauer's portrayal of Batty was regarded by Philip K. Dick as, "the perfect Batty—cold, <a href="Aryan%20race">Aryan</a>, flawless". Of the many films Hauer has made, "Blade Runner" is his favorite. As he explained in a live chat in 2001, ""Blade Runner" needs no explanation. It just [is]. All of the best. There is nothing like it. To be part of a real masterpiece which changed the world's thinking. It's awesome." Hauer rewrote his character's "<a href="Tears%20in%20rain%20monologue">tears in rain</a>" speech himself and presented the words to Scott on set prior to filming.

"Blade Runner" used a number of then-lesser-known actors: <a href="Sean%20Young">Sean Young</a> portrays Rachael, an experimental replicant implanted with the memories of Tyrell's niece, causing her to believe she is human; <a href="Nina%20Axelrod">Nina Axelrod</a> auditioned for the role. <a href="Daryl%20Hannah">Daryl Hannah</a> portrays Pris, a "basic pleasure model" replicant; <a href="Stacey%20Nelkin">Stacey Nelkin</a> auditioned for the role, but was given another part in the film, which was ultimately cut before filming. Casting Pris and Rachael was challenging, requiring several screen tests, with <a href="Morgan%20Paull">Morgan Paull</a> playing the role of Deckard. Paull was cast as Deckard's fellow bounty hunter Holden based on his performances in the tests. <a href="Brion%20James">Brion James</a> portrays Leon Kowalski, a combat replicant, and <a href="Joanna%20Cassidy">Joanna Cassidy</a> portrays Zhora, an assassin replicant.

<a href="Edward%20James%20Olmos">Edward James Olmos</a> portrays Gaff. Olmos used his diverse ethnic background, and personal research, to help create the fictional "<a href="Cityspeak">Cityspeak</a>" language his character uses in the film. His initial address to Deckard at the noodle bar is partly in Hungarian and means, "Horse dick [bullshit]! No way. You are the Blade ... Blade Runner." <a href="M.%20Emmet%20Walsh">M. Emmet Walsh</a> plays Captain Bryant, a hard-drinking, sleazy, and underhanded police veteran typical of the <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a> genre. <a href="Joe%20Turkel">Joe Turkel</a> portrays Dr. Eldon Tyrell, a corporate mogul who built an empire on genetically manipulated humanoid slaves. <a href="William%20Sanderson">William Sanderson</a> was cast as J. F. Sebastian, a quiet and lonely genius who provides a compassionate yet compliant portrait of humanity. J. F. sympathizes with the replicants, whom he sees as companions, and shares their shorter lifespan due to his rapid aging disease; <a href="Joe%20Pantoliano">Joe Pantoliano</a> was considered for the role. <a href="James%20Hong">James Hong</a> portrays Hannibal Chew, an elderly geneticist specializing in synthetic eyes, and <a href="Hy%20Pyke">Hy Pyke</a> portrays the sleazy bar owner Taffey Lewis with ease and in a single take, something almost unheard-of with Scott whose drive for perfection resulted at times in double-digit takes.

Interest in adapting <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>'s novel "<a href="Do%20Androids%20Dream%20of%20Electric%20Sheep%3F">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a>" developed shortly after its 1968 publication. Director <a href="Martin%20Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> was interested in filming the novel, but never <a href="option%20%28filmmaking%29">optioned</a> it. Producer <a href="Herb%20Jaffe">Herb Jaffe</a> optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb's son Robert: "Jaffe's screenplay was so terribly done ... Robert flew down to <a href="Santa%20Ana%2C%20California">Santa Ana</a> to speak with me about the project. And the first thing I said to him when he got off the plane was, 'Shall I beat you up here at the airport, or shall I beat you up back at my apartment?

The screenplay by <a href="Hampton%20Fancher">Hampton Fancher</a> was optioned in 1977. Producer <a href="Michael%20Deeley">Michael Deeley</a> became interested in Fancher's draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to film it. Scott had previously declined the project, but after leaving the slow production of "<a href="Dune%20%28film%29">Dune</a>", wanted a faster-paced project to take his mind off his older brother's recent death. He joined the project on February 21, 1980, and managed to push up the promised <a href="Filmways">Filmways</a> financing from US$13 million to $15 million. Fancher's script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and religion, which are prominent in the novel and Scott wanted changes. Fancher found a cinema treatment by <a href="William%20S.%20Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a> for <a href="Alan%20E.%20Nourse">Alan E. Nourse</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Bladerunner">The Bladerunner</a>" (1974), titled "<a href="Blade%20Runner%20%28a%20movie%29">Blade Runner (a movie)</a>". Scott liked the name, so Deeley obtained the rights to the titles. Eventually he hired <a href="David%20Peoples">David Peoples</a> to rewrite the script and Fancher left the job over the issue on December 21, 1980, although he later returned to contribute additional rewrites.

Having invested over $2.5 million in pre-production, as the date of commencement of principal photography neared, Filmways withdrew financial backing. In ten days Deeley had secured $21.5 million in financing through a three-way deal between <a href="The%20Ladd%20Company">The Ladd Company</a> (through Warner Bros.), the Hong Kong-based producer <a href="Run%20Run%20Shaw">Sir Run Run Shaw</a> and <a href="Tandem%20Productions">Tandem Productions</a>.

Philip K. Dick became concerned that no one had informed him about the film's production, which added to his distrust of Hollywood. After Dick criticized an early version of Hampton Fancher's script in an article written for the Los Angeles "Select TV Guide", the studio sent Dick the David Peoples rewrite. Although Dick died shortly before the film's release, he was pleased with the rewritten script and with a 20-minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Despite his well-known skepticism of Hollywood in principle, Dick enthused to Ridley Scott that the world created for the film looked exactly as he had imagined it. He said, "I saw a segment of <a href="Douglas%20Trumbull">Douglas Trumbull</a>'s special effects for "Blade Runner" on the KNBC-TV news. I recognized it immediately. It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly." He also approved of the film's script, saying, "After I finished reading the screenplay, I got the novel out and looked through it. The two reinforce each other, so that someone who started with the novel would enjoy the movie and someone who started with the movie would enjoy the novel." The motion picture was dedicated to Dick. Principal photography of "Blade Runner" began on March 9, 1981, and ended four months later.

In 1992, Ford revealed, ""Blade Runner" is not one of my favorite films. I tangled with Ridley." Apart from friction with the director, Ford also disliked the <a href="voice-over">voiceovers</a>: "When we started shooting it had been tacitly agreed that the version of the film that we had agreed upon was the version without voiceover narration. It was a nightmare. I thought that the film had worked without the narration. But now I was stuck re-creating that narration. And I was obliged to do the voiceovers for people that did not represent the director's interests." "I went kicking and screaming to the studio to record it." The narration monologues were written by an uncredited <a href="Roland%20Kibbee">Roland Kibbee</a>.

In 2006, Scott was asked "Who's the biggest pain in the arse you've ever worked with?", he replied: "It's got to be Harrison ... he'll forgive me because now I get on with him. Now he's become charming. But he knows a lot, that's the problem. When we worked together it was my first film up and I was the new kid on the block. But we made a good movie." Ford said of Scott in 2000: "I admire his work. We had a bad patch there, and I'm over it." In 2006 Ford reflected on the production of the film saying: "What I remember more than anything else when I see "Blade Runner" is not the 50 nights of shooting in the rain, but the voiceover ... I was still obliged to work for these clowns that came in writing one bad voiceover after another." Ridley Scott confirmed in the summer 2007 issue of "<a href="Total%20Film">Total Film</a>" that Harrison Ford contributed to the "Blade Runner" Special Edition DVD, and had already recorded his interviews. "Harrison's fully on board", said Scott.

The <a href="Bradbury%20Building">Bradbury Building</a> in downtown <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> served as a <a href="filming%20location">filming location</a>, and a Warner Bros. <a href="backlot">backlot</a> housed the LA 2019 streets. Other locations included the <a href="Ennis%20House">Ennis-Brown House</a> and the <a href="2nd%20Street%20Tunnel">2nd Street Tunnel</a>. Test screenings resulted in several changes including adding a voice-over, a happy ending and the removal of a Holden hospital scene. The relationship between the filmmakers and the investors was difficult, which culminated in Deeley and Scott being fired but still working on the film. Crew members created T-shirts during filming saying, "Yes Guv'nor, My Ass" that mocked Scott's unfavorable comparison of U.S. and British crews; Scott responded with a T-shirt of his own, "Xenophobia Sucks" making the incident known as the T-shirt war.

Ridley Scott credits <a href="Edward%20Hopper">Edward Hopper</a>'s painting "<a href="Nighthawks">Nighthawks</a>" and the French science fiction comics magazine "<a href="M%C3%A9tal%20Hurlant">Métal Hurlant</a>", to which the artist <a href="Jean%20Giraud">Moebius</a> contributed, as stylistic mood sources. He also drew on the landscape of "<a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> on a very bad day" and the industrial landscape of his one-time home in northeast England. The visual style of the movie is influenced by the work of futurist Italian architect <a href="Antonio%20Sant%27Elia">Antonio Sant'Elia</a>. Scott hired <a href="Syd%20Mead">Syd Mead</a> as his <a href="concept%20art">concept art</a>ist who, like Scott, was influenced by "Métal Hurlant". Moebius was offered the opportunity to assist in the pre-production of "Blade Runner", but he declined so that he could work on <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Laloux">René Laloux</a>'s animated film "<a href="Les%20Ma%C3%AEtres%20du%20temps">Les Maîtres du temps</a>" – a decision that he later regretted. Production designer <a href="Lawrence%20G.%20Paull">Lawrence G. Paull</a> and art director <a href="David%20Snyder">David Snyder</a> realized Scott's and Mead's sketches. <a href="Douglas%20Trumbull">Douglas Trumbull</a> and <a href="Richard%20Yuricich">Richard Yuricich</a> supervised the special effects for the film.

"Blade Runner" has numerous deep similarities to <a href="Fritz%20Lang">Fritz Lang</a>'s "<a href="Metropolis%20%281927%20film%29">Metropolis</a>", including a built-up urban environment, in which the wealthy literally live above the workers, dominated by a huge building – the Stadtkrone Tower in "Metropolis" and the Tyrell Building in "Blade Runner". Special effects supervisor David Dryer used stills from "Metropolis" when lining up "Blade Runner"s miniature building shots.

The extended end scene in the original theatrical release shows Rachael and Deckard traveling into daylight with pastoral aerial shots filmed by director <a href="Stanley%20Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>. Ridley Scott contacted Kubrick about using some of his surplus helicopter aerial photography from "<a href="The%20Shining%20%28film%29">The Shining.</a>"

"Spinner" is the generic term for the fictional flying cars used in the film. A spinner can be driven as a ground-based vehicle, and take off vertically, hover, and cruise using <a href="jet%20engine">jet propulsion</a> much like <a href="VTOL">vertical take-off and landing (VTOL)</a> aircraft. They are used extensively by the police to patrol and survey the population, and it is clear that despite restrictions wealthy people can acquire spinner licenses. The vehicle was conceived and designed by Syd Mead who described the spinner as an "aerodyne"—a vehicle which directs air downward to create <a href="lift%20%28force%29">lift</a>, though press kits for the film stated that the spinner was propelled by three engines: "conventional <a href="internal%20combustion%20engine">internal combustion</a>, jet, and <a href="anti-gravity">anti-gravity</a>" Mead's conceptual drawings were transformed into 25 working vehicles by automobile customizer <a href="Gene%20Winfield">Gene Winfield</a>. A spinner is on permanent exhibit at the <a href="Science%20Fiction%20Museum%20and%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame</a> in Seattle, Washington.

The Voight-Kampff machine is a fictional interrogation tool, originating in the novel where it is spelled "Voigt-Kampff". The Voight-Kampff is a <a href="polygraph">polygraph</a>-like machine used by Blade Runners to determine <a href="Turing%20test">whether an individual is a replicant</a>. It measures bodily functions such as respiration, blush response, heart rate and eye movement in response to questions dealing with empathy. In the film two replicants take the test, Leon and Rachael, and Deckard tells Tyrell that it usually takes 20 to 30 cross-referenced questions to distinguish a replicant; in contrast with the book, where it is stated it only takes "six or seven" questions to make a determination. In the film it takes more than one hundred questions to determine that Rachael is a replicant.

The "Blade Runner" soundtrack by <a href="Vangelis">Vangelis</a> is a dark melodic combination of classic composition and futuristic synthesizers which mirrors the film-noir retro-future envisioned by Ridley Scott. Vangelis, fresh from his <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Award</a>-winning score for "<a href="Chariots%20of%20Fire">Chariots of Fire</a>", composed and performed the music on his synthesizers. He also made use of various chimes and the vocals of collaborator <a href="Demis%20Roussos">Demis Roussos</a>. Another memorable sound is the haunting tenor sax solo "Love Theme" by British saxophonist <a href="Dick%20Morrissey">Dick Morrissey</a>, who performed on many of Vangelis's albums. Ridley Scott also used "Memories of Green" from the Vangelis album "<a href="See%20You%20Later">See You Later</a>, "an orchestral version of which Scott would later use in his film "<a href="Someone%20to%20Watch%20Over%20Me%20%28film%29">Someone To Watch Over Me</a>".

Along with Vangelis' compositions and ambient textures, the film's soundscape also features a track by the Japanese ensemble Nipponia – "Ogi No Mato" or "The Folding Fan as a Target" from the Nonesuch Records release "Traditional Vocal and Instrumental Music" – and a track by harpist Gail Laughton from "Harps of the Ancient Temples" on Laurel Records.

Despite being well received by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">BAFTA</a> and <a href="Golden%20Globe">Golden Globe</a> as best original score, and the promise of a soundtrack album from <a href="Polydor%20Records">Polydor Records</a> in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from "Blade Runner". In light of the lack of a release of an album, the <a href="New%20American%20Orchestra">New American Orchestra</a> recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation "Vangelis: Themes", but not until the 1992 release of the "Director's Cut" version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.

These delays and poor reproductions led to the production of many <a href="bootleg%20recording">bootleg recording</a>s over the years. A bootleg tape surfaced in 1982 at science fiction conventions and became popular given the delay of an official release of the original recordings, and in 1993 "Off World Music, Ltd" created a bootleg CD that would prove more comprehensive than Vangelis' official CD in 1994. A set with three CDs of "Blade Runner"-related Vangelis music was released in 2007. Titled "Blade Runner Trilogy", the first disc contains the same tracks as the 1994 official soundtrack release, the second features previously unreleased music from the movie, and the third disc is all newly composed music from Vangelis, inspired by, and in the spirit of the movie.

The film's special effects are generally recognized to be among the best of all time, using the available (non-digital) technology to the fullest. In addition to <a href="matte%20painting">matte painting</a>s and models, the techniques employed included multipass exposures. In some scenes, the set was lit, shot, the film rewound, and then rerecorded over with different lighting. In some cases this was done 16 times in all. The cameras were frequently <a href="motion%20control%20photography">motion controlled using computers</a>. Many effects used techniques which had been developed during the production of "<a href="Close%20Encounters%20of%20the%20Third%20Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>".

"Blade Runner" was released in 1,290 theaters on June 25, 1982. That date was chosen by producer <a href="Alan%20Ladd%20Jr.">Alan Ladd Jr.</a> because his previous highest-grossing films ("<a href="Star%20Wars%20%28film%29">Star Wars</a>" and "<a href="Alien%20%28film%29">Alien</a>") had a similar opening date (May 25) in 1977 and 1979, making the date his "lucky day". "Blade Runner" grossed reasonably good ticket sales according to contemporary reports; earning $6.1 million during its first weekend in theaters. The film was released close to other major sci-fi/fantasy releases such as "<a href="The%20Thing%20%281982%20film%29">The Thing</a>", "", "<a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian%20%281982%20film%29">Conan the Barbarian</a>" and "<a href="E.T.%20the%20Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a>."

Initial reactions among film critics were mixed. Some wrote that the plot took a back seat to the film's special effects, and did not fit the studio's marketing as an action/adventure movie. Others acclaimed its complexity and predicted it would stand the test of time. Negative criticism in the United States cited its slow pace. Sheila Benson from the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" called it "Blade Crawler", and Pat Berman in "<a href="The%20State%20%28newspaper%29">The State</a>" and "<a href="Columbia%20Record">Columbia Record</a>" described it as "science fiction pornography". <a href="Pauline%20Kael">Pauline Kael</a> praised "Blade Runner" as worthy of a place in film history for its distinctive sci-fi vision, yet criticized the film's lack of development in "human terms".

Academics began writing analyses of the film almost as soon as it was released, in particular its dystopic aspects, its questions regarding "authentic" humanity, its ecofeminist aspects, in genre studies and in recent years, popular culture. The film has been the subject of academic interest over decades.

Since its original release, the film has become a science fiction classic. <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> praised the visuals of both the original and the "Director's Cut" versions and recommended it for that reason; however, he found the human story clichéd and a little thin. He later added "The Final Cut" to his "Great Movies" list. Critic Chris Rodley and <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> theorized that "Blade Runner" changed cinematic and cultural discourse through its image repertoire, and subsequent influence on films. In 2012, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" film critic <a href="Richard%20Corliss">Richard Corliss</a> surgically analyzed the durability, complexity, screenplay, sets and production dynamics from a personal, three-decade perspective. "Blade Runner" holds an 90% rating on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, a website that rates films based on published reviews by critics, averaging a score of 8.5 out of 10 from 106 reviews. The site's main consensus reads "Misunderstood when it first hit theaters, the influence of Ridley Scott's mysterious, neo-noir "Blade Runner" has deepened with time. A visually remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece." <a href="Denis%20Villeneuve">Denis Villeneuve</a>, who is to direct the "Blade Runner" sequel, cites the movie as a huge influence for him and many others.

"Blade Runner" won or received nominations for the following awards:

Several versions of "Blade Runner" have been shown. The original workprint version (1982, 113 minutes) was shown for audience test previews in Denver and Dallas in March 1982. Negative responses to the previews led to the modifications resulting in the U.S. theatrical version. The workprint was shown as a director's cut without Scott's approval at the Los Angeles Fairfax Theater in May 1990, at an AMPAS showing in April 1991, and in September and October 1991 at the Los Angeles NuArt Theater and the San Francisco Castro Theatre. Positive responses pushed the studio to approve work on an official director's cut. A San Diego Sneak Preview was shown only once, in May 1982, and was almost identical to the U.S. theatrical version but contained three extra scenes not shown in any other version, including the 2007 Final Cut.

Two versions were shown in the film's 1982 theatrical release: the U.S. theatrical version (117 minutes), known as the original version or "Domestic Cut", released on <a href="Betamax">Betamax</a>, <a href="CED%20Videodisc">CED Videodisc</a> and <a href="VHS">VHS</a> in 1983 and <a href="LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a> in 1987; and the "International Cut" (117 minutes), also known as the "Criterion Edition" or "uncut version", which included more violent action scenes than the U.S. version. Although initially unavailable in the U.S., and distributed in Europe and Asia via theatrical and local Warner Home Video Laserdisc releases, it was later released on VHS and <a href="Criterion%20Collection">Criterion Collection</a> Laserdisc in North America, and re-released in 1992 as a "10th Anniversary Edition".

Scott's "Director's Cut" (1991, 116 minutes) was made available on VHS and Laserdisc in 1993, and on DVD in 1997. Significant changes from the theatrical version include: the removal of Deckard's voice-over; re-insertion of the unicorn sequence; and removal of the studio-imposed happy ending. Scott provided extensive notes and consultation to Warner Bros. through film preservationist Michael Arick, who was put in charge of creating the "Director's Cut". Scott's "The Final Cut" (2007, 117 minutes) was released by Warner Bros. theatrically on October 5, 2007, and subsequently released on DVD, <a href="HD%20DVD">HD DVD</a>, and <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a> in December 2007. This is the only version over which Scott had complete editorial control.

While not initially a success with North American audiences, the film was popular internationally and garnered a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a>. The film's dark style and futuristic designs have served as a benchmark and its influence can be seen in many subsequent science fiction films, <a href="video%20games">video games</a>, <a href="anime">anime</a>, and television programs. For example, <a href="Ronald%20D.%20Moore">Ronald D. Moore</a> and <a href="David%20Eick">David Eick</a>, the producers of the re-imagining of "<a href="Battlestar%20Galactica%20%282004%20TV%20series%29">Battlestar Galactica</a>", have both cited "Blade Runner" as one of the major influences for the show. "Blade Runner" continues to reflect modern trends and concerns, and an increasing number consider it one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. It was voted the best science fiction film ever made in a poll of 60 eminent world scientists conducted in 2004. "Blade Runner" is also cited as an important influence to both the style and story of the "<a href="Ghost%20in%20the%20Shell">Ghost in the Shell</a>" film series, which itself has been highly influential to the future-noir genre.

"Blade Runner" has been very influential to the <a href="cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> movement. It also influenced the <a href="Cyberpunk%20derivatives">cyberpunk derivative</a> <a href="biopunk">biopunk</a> that revolves around biotechnology and <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a>.

The film was selected for preservation in the United States <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a> in 1993 and is frequently used in university courses. In 2007 it was named the second-most visually influential film of all time by the <a href="Visual%20Effects%20Society">Visual Effects Society</a>.

"Blade Runner" is one of the most musically <a href="Sampling%20%28music%29">sampled</a> films of the 20th century. The 2009 album, "<a href="I%2C%20Human">I, Human</a>", by Singaporean band <a href="Deus%20Ex%20Machina%20%28Death%20Metal%29">Deus Ex Machina</a> makes numerous references to the genetic engineering and cloning themes from the film, and even features a track titled "Replicant".

"Blade Runner" has influenced <a href="adventure%20game">adventure game</a>s such as the 2012 graphical <a href="text%20adventure">text adventure</a> "<a href="Cypher%20%28video%20game%29">Cypher</a>", "<a href="Rise%20of%20the%20Dragon">Rise of the Dragon</a>", "<a href="Snatcher%20%28video%20game%29">Snatcher</a>", the <a href="Tex%20Murphy">Tex Murphy</a> series, "<a href="Beneath%20a%20Steel%20Sky">Beneath a Steel Sky</a>", "", "<a href="Bubblegum%20Crisis">Bubblegum Crisis</a>" (and its original anime films), the <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a> "<a href="Shadowrun">Shadowrun</a>", the <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a> "<a href="Perfect%20Dark">Perfect Dark</a>", and the "<a href="Syndicate%20%28series%29">Syndicate</a>" series of video games. The film is also cited as a major influence on <a href="Warren%20Spector">Warren Spector</a>, designer of the computer-game "<a href="Deus%20Ex%20%28video%20game%29">Deus Ex</a>", which displays evidence of the film's influence in both its visual rendering and plot. The look of the film, darkness, neon lights and opacity of vision, is easier to <a href="rendering%20%28computer%20graphics%29">render</a> than complicated backdrops, making it a popular choice for game designers.

"Blade Runner" has also been the subject of parody, such as the comics "Blade Bummer" by "<a href="Crazy%20%28magazine%29">Crazy</a>" comics, "Bad Rubber" by <a href="Steve%20Gallacci">Steve Gallacci</a>, and the "<a href="Red%20Dwarf">Red Dwarf</a>" 2009 three-part miniseries, "".

Among the folklore that has developed around the film over the years has been the belief that the film was a curse to the companies whose logos were displayed prominently as <a href="product%20placement">product placement</a>s in some scenes. While they were market leaders at the time, <a href="Atari">Atari</a>, <a href="Bell%20System">Bell</a>, <a href="Cuisinart">Cuisinart</a> and <a href="Pan%20American%20World%20Airways">Pan Am</a> experienced setbacks after the film's release. <a href="The%20Coca-Cola%20Company">The Coca-Cola Company</a> suffered losses during its failed introduction of <a href="New%20Coke">New Coke</a> in 1985, but soon afterwards regained its market share.

Media recognitions for "Blade Runner" include:


Before filming began, "<a href="Cinefantastique">Cinefantastique</a>" magazine commissioned Paul M. Sammon to write an article about "Blade Runner"s production which became the book "Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner".
The book chronicles "Blade Runner"s evolution, focusing on film-set politics, especially the British director's experiences with his first American film crew; of which producer <a href="Alan%20Ladd%2C%20Jr.">Alan Ladd, Jr.</a> has said, "Harrison wouldn't speak to Ridley and Ridley wouldn't speak to Harrison. By the end of the shoot Ford was 'ready to kill Ridley', said one colleague. He really would have taken him on if he hadn't been talked out of it."
"Future Noir" has short cast biographies and quotations about their experiences, and photographs of the film's production and preliminary sketches. A second edition of "Future Noir" was published in 2007.

<a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a> refused a $400,000 offer to write a "Blade Runner" <a href="novelization">novelization</a>, saying: "[I was] told the cheapo novelization would have to appeal to the twelve-year-old audience" and it "would have probably been disastrous to me artistically". He added, "That insistence on my part of bringing out the original novel and not doing the novelization – they were just furious. They finally recognized that there was a legitimate reason for reissuing the novel, even though it cost them money. It was a victory not just of contractual obligations but of theoretical principles." "<a href="Do%20Androids%20Dream%20of%20Electric%20Sheep%3F">Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</a>" was eventually reprinted as a <a href="movie%20tie-in%20%28book%29">tie-in</a>, with the film poster as a cover and the original title in parentheses below the "Blade Runner" title. Additionally, a novelization of the movie entitled "Blade Runner: A Story of the Future" by <a href="Les%20Martin">Les Martin</a> was released in 1982. <a href="Archie%20Goodwin%20%28comics%29">Archie Goodwin</a> scripted the comic book adaptation, "<a href="Marvel%20Comics%20Super%20Special">A Marvel Super Special: Blade Runner</a>", published in September 1982.

There are two <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s based on the film, <a href="Blade%20Runner%20%281985%20video%20game%29">one from 1985</a> for <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a>, <a href="Sinclair%20ZX%20Spectrum">Sinclair ZX Spectrum</a> and <a href="Amstrad%20CPC">Amstrad CPC</a> by CRL Group PLC based on the music by Vangelis (due to licensing issues), and <a href="Blade%20Runner%20%281997%20video%20game%29">another action adventure PC game from 1997</a> by <a href="Westwood%20Studios">Westwood Studios</a>. The 1997 video game featured new characters and branching storylines based on the "Blade Runner" world. Eldon Tyrell, Gaff, Leon, Rachael, Chew, and J.F. Sebastian appear, and their voice files are recorded by the original actors. The player assumes the role of McCoy, another replicant-hunter working at the same time as Deckard.

The PC game featured a non-linear plot, <a href="non-player%20character">non-player character</a>s that each ran in their own independent <a href="Artificial%20intelligence">AI</a>, and an unusual pseudo-3D engine (which eschewed polygonal solids in favor of <a href="Voxel%23Computer%20gaming">voxel</a> elements) that did not require the use of a 3D accelerator card to play the game.

The television film "<a href="Total%20Recall%202070">Total Recall 2070</a>" was initially planned as a <a href="Spin-off%20%28media%29">spin-off</a> of the film "<a href="Total%20Recall%20%281990%20film%29">Total Recall</a>", and would eventually be transformed into a hybrid of "Total Recall" and "Blade Runner". The "Total Recall" film was also based on a Philip K. Dick story, "<a href="We%20Can%20Remember%20It%20for%20You%20Wholesale">We Can Remember It for You Wholesale</a>"; many similarities between "Total Recall 2070" and "Blade Runner" were noted, as well as apparent inspiration from <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>'s "<a href="The%20Caves%20of%20Steel">The Caves of Steel</a>" and the TV series "<a href="Holmes%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%26amp%3B%20Yoyo">Holmes & Yoyo</a>".

The film has been the subject of several documentaries.





"Blade Runner" co-author <a href="David%20Peoples">David Peoples</a> wrote the 1998 action film "<a href="Soldier%20%281998%20American%20film%29">Soldier</a>", which he referred to as a "<a href="sidequel">sidequel</a>" or <a href="spiritual%20successor">spiritual successor</a> to the original film, set in the same <a href="shared%20universe">shared universe</a>. By 1999, <a href="Stuart%20Hazeldine">Stuart Hazeldine</a> had written a sequel to "Blade Runner" based on "The Edge of Human", titled "Blade Runner Down"; the project was shelved due to rights issues. In 2009 Scott and his brother <a href="Tony%20Scott">Tony Scott</a> were working on a prequel called "Purefold" as a series of 5–10 minute <a href="webisode">webisode</a>s, but in February 2010 production ceased due to funding problems.

In 2012, a bonus feature on the "Alien" prequel "<a href="Prometheus%20%282012%20film%29">Prometheus</a>" DVD revealed "that Guy Pearce's Peter Weyland (who funded the space expedition that Shaw was on in "Prometheus") had a mentor, and that was Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkell), a character in the "Blade Runner" movie who was the CEO of the Tyrell Corporation which produced the replicant androids that Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard pursues."

In March 2011, Yorkin began developing a new "Blade Runner" film,
and named director <a href="Christopher%20Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a> was the desired choice to make it. In August 2011, Scott was to direct the new film while producer <a href="Andrew%20Kosove">Andrew Kosove</a> indicated Ford was unlikely to be involved.
Scott outlined the film was "liable to be a sequel" without the previous cast. By February 2015, Scott switched to an executive producer's role with <a href="Denis%20Villeneuve">Denis Villeneuve</a> ("<a href="Arrival%20%28film%29">Arrival</a>") to direct. Ford would return along with original writer <a href="Hampton%20Fancher">Hampton Fancher</a>; Oscar-nominated cinematographer <a href="Roger%20Deakins">Roger Deakins</a> is attached, and <a href="Ryan%20Gosling">Ryan Gosling</a> would also star.

The film entered production in mid-2016 and is set decades after the first film. Originally slated for release in January 2018, it is now set for October 6, 2017.

Dick's friend <a href="K.%20W.%20Jeter">K. W.

Bill Gates

William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is a co-founder of the <a href="Microsoft%20Corporation">Microsoft Corporation</a> and is an American <a href="business%20magnate">business magnate</a>, <a href="investor">investor</a>, <a href="author">author</a> and <a href="Philanthropy">philanthropist</a>.

In 1975, Gates and <a href="Paul%20Allen">Paul Allen</a> launched Microsoft, which became the world's largest <a href="Personal%20computer">PC</a> software company. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of <a href="chairman">chairman</a>, <a href="Chief%20executive%20officer">CEO</a> and <a href="software%20architect">chief software architect</a>, while also being the largest individual <a href="shareholder">shareholder</a> until May 2014. Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000, but he remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself. In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work and full-time work at the <a href="Bill%20%26amp%3B%20Melinda%20Gates%20Foundation">Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</a>. He gradually transferred his duties to <a href="Ray%20Ozzie">Ray Ozzie</a> and <a href="Craig%20Mundie">Craig Mundie</a>. He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed CEO <a href="Satya%20Nadella">Satya Nadella</a>.

Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the <a href="Home%20computer">personal computer revolution</a>. He has been <a href="Criticism%20of%20Microsoft">criticized for his business tactics</a>, which have been considered <a href="Anti-competitive%20practices">anti-competitive</a>. This opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings. Later in his career, Gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. He donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the <a href="Bill%20%26amp%3B%20Melinda%20Gates%20Foundation">Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, which was established in 2000.

Since 1987, Gates has been included in the <a href="The%20World%27s%20Billionaires">"Forbes" list of the world's wealthiest people</a>. , he is the richest person in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$84.8 billion. In 2009, Gates and <a href="Warren%20Buffett">Warren Buffett</a> founded <a href="The%20Giving%20Pledge">The Giving Pledge</a>, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy. The foundation works to save lives and improve global health, and is working with Rotary International to eliminate polio.

Gates was born in <a href="Seattle%2C%20Washington">Seattle, Washington</a> on October 28, 1955. He is the son of <a href="William%20H.%20Gates%20Sr.">William H. Gates Sr.</a> (b. 1925) and <a href="Mary%20Maxwell%20Gates">Mary Maxwell Gates</a> (1929–1994). His ancestry includes <a href="English%20American">English</a>, <a href="German%20American">German</a>, <a href="Irish%20American">Irish</a>, and <a href="Scots-Irish%20American">Scots-Irish</a>. His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for <a href="First%20Interstate%20BancSystem">First Interstate BancSystem</a> and the <a href="United%20Way%20of%20America">United Way</a>. Gates' maternal grandfather was JW Maxwell, a <a href="National%20bank%23United%20States">national bank</a> president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William Gates III or "Trey" because his father had the "II" suffix. Early on in his life, Gates' parents had a law career in mind for him. When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a church of the <a href="Congregational%20Christian%20Churches">Congregational Christian Churches</a>, a <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> <a href="Reformed">Reformed</a> denomination. The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was <a href="hearts">hearts</a> or <a href="pickleball">pickleball</a> or swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing".
At 13, he enrolled in the <a href="Lakeside%20School%20%28Seattle%2C%20Washington%29">Lakeside School</a>, a private preparatory school. When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's <a href="rummage%20sale">rummage sale</a> to buy a <a href="Teletype%20Model%2033">Teletype Model 33</a> ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a> (GE) computer for the school's students. Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in <a href="BASIC%20programming%20language">BASIC</a>, and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of <a href="tic-tac-toe">tic-tac-toe</a> that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, "There was just something neat about the machine." After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including <a href="Digital%20Equipment%20Corporation">DEC</a> <a href="Programmed%20Data%20Processor">PDP</a> minicomputers. One of these systems was a <a href="PDP-10">PDP-10</a> belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students Gates, <a href="Paul%20Allen">Paul Allen</a>, <a href="Ric%20Weiland">Ric Weiland</a>, and Kent Evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.

At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in <a href="Computer%20Center%20Corporation">CCC</a>'s software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than use the system via <a href="Teletype">Teletype</a>. Subsequently, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied <a href="source%20code">source code</a> for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in <a href="Fortran">Fortran</a>, <a href="Lisp%20%28programming%20language%29">Lisp</a>, and <a href="machine%20language">machine language</a>. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in <a href="COBOL">COBOL</a>, providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with "a disproportionate number of interesting girls." He later stated that "it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success." At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called <a href="Traf-O-Data">Traf-O-Data</a>, to make <a href="traffic%20counter">traffic counter</a>s based on the <a href="Intel%208008">Intel 8008</a> processor. In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>.

Gates was a <a href="National%20Merit%20Scholarship%20Program">National Merit Scholar</a> when he graduated from Lakeside School in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the <a href="SAT">Scholastic Aptitude Tests</a> (SAT) and enrolled at <a href="Harvard%20College">Harvard College</a> in the autumn of 1973. He chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses. While at Harvard, he met fellow student <a href="Steve%20Ballmer">Steve Ballmer</a>. Gates left Harvard after two years while Ballmer would stay and graduate "<a href="magna%20cum%20laude">magna cum laude</a>". Years later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO. He maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation from the company in 2014.

In his second year, Gates devised an <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a> for <a href="pancake%20sorting">pancake sorting</a> as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems presented in a <a href="combinatorics">combinatorics</a> class by <a href="Harry%20R.%20Lewis">Harry Lewis</a>, one of his professors. Gates' solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years; its successor is faster by only one percent. His solution was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist <a href="Christos%20Papadimitriou">Christos Papadimitriou</a>.

While Gates was a student at Harvard, he did not have a definite study plan, and he spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at <a href="Honeywell">Honeywell</a> during the summer of 1974. The <a href="MITS%20Altair%208800">MITS Altair 8800</a> was released the following year. The new computer was based on the <a href="Intel%208080%20CPU">Intel 8080 CPU</a>, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company. Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time. He had talked over this decision with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much their son wanted to start his own company. Gates explained his decision to leave Harvard, saying "...if things [Microsoft] hadn't worked out, I could always go back to school. I was officially on [a] <a href="leave%20of%20absence">leave</a> [of absence]."

After Gates read the January 1975 issue of "<a href="Popular%20Electronics">Popular Electronics</a>", which demonstrated the <a href="Altair%208800">Altair 8800</a>, he contacted <a href="Micro%20Instrumentation%20and%20Telemetry%20Systems">Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems</a> (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a <a href="BASIC">BASIC</a> interpreter for the platform. In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president <a href="Ed%20Roberts%20%28computers%29">Ed Roberts</a> agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair <a href="emulator">emulator</a> that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in <a href="Albuquerque%2C%20New%20Mexico">Albuquerque</a>, was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as <a href="Altair%20BASIC">Altair BASIC</a>. Paul Allen was hired into MITS, and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership "Micro-Soft" and had their first office located in Albuquerque. Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name "Microsoft" was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the <a href="New%20Mexico">State of New Mexico</a>. Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.

Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an <a href="Open%20Letter%20to%20Hobbyists">Open Letter to Hobbyists</a> in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90 percent of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid Microsoft for it and by doing so the Altair "hobby market" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software. This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems. The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in <a href="Bellevue%2C%20Washington">Bellevue</a>, Washington, on January 1, 1979.

During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.

<a href="IBM">IBM</a> approached Microsoft in July 1980 in reference to an operating system for its upcoming personal computer, the <a href="IBM%20PC">IBM PC</a>. Big Blue first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to <a href="Digital%20Research">Digital Research</a> (DRI), makers of the widely used <a href="CP/M">CP/M</a> operating system. IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later, Gates proposed using <a href="86-DOS">86-DOS</a> (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that <a href="Tim%20Paterson">Tim Paterson</a> of <a href="Seattle%20Computer%20Products">Seattle Computer Products</a> (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as <a href="PC%20DOS">PC DOS</a> in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.

Gates did not offer to transfer the <a href="copyright">copyright</a> on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system. They did, and the sales of <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> made Microsoft a major player in the industry. Despite IBM's name on the operating system, the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer. "PC Magazine" asked if Gates were "the man behind the machine?", and "<a href="InfoWorld">InfoWorld</a>" quoted an expert as stating "it's Gates' computer". Gates oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the president of Microsoft and its board chairman.

Microsoft launched its first retail version of <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> on November 20, 1985. In August of the following year, the company struck a deal with <a href="IBM">IBM</a> to develop a separate operating system called <a href="OS/2">OS/2</a>. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences.

From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He gained a reputation for being distant from others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that "Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls." Another executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times. When they met again a month later, Gates "won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor."

Gates was an executive who met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these meetings, the managers described him being verbally combative. He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk. He interrupted presentations with such comments as "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!" and "Why don't you just give up your <a href="Employee%20stock%20option">options</a> and join the <a href="Peace%20Corps">Peace Corps</a>?" The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced. When subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, "I'll do it over the weekend."

During Microsoft's early history, Gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company's <a href="programming%20language">programming language</a> products, but his basic role in most of the company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the <a href="TRS-80%20Model%20100">TRS-80 Model 100</a>, but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products. He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, <a href="Jerry%20Pournelle">Jerry Pournelle</a> wrote that when he watched Gates announce <a href="Microsoft%20Excel">Microsoft Excel</a>, "Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat <a href="hack%20%28programmer%20subculture%29">hack</a>." 

On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that over the next two years he would transition out of his day-to-day role to dedicate more time to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed <a href="Ray%20Ozzie">Ray Ozzie</a> in charge of day-to-day management and <a href="Craig%20Mundie">Craig Mundie</a> in charge of long-term product strategy.

Many decisions that led to <a href="United%20States%20antitrust%20law">antitrust</a> litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates' approval. In the 1998 "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Microsoft">United States v. Microsoft</a>" case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner <a href="David%20Boies">David Boies</a> over the contextual meaning of words such as, "compete", "concerned", and "we". The judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition. "BusinessWeek" reported:
Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, "Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree." Despite Gates' denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed <a href="monopolization">monopolization</a> and <a href="tying%20%28commerce%29">tying</a>, and blocking competition, both in violation of the <a href="Sherman%20Antitrust%20Act">Sherman Antitrust Act</a>.

In 2008, Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft. The first commercial, co-starring <a href="Jerry%20Seinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a>, is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside. The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own <a href="mugshot">mugshot</a> of his arrest in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> in 1977, for a traffic violation. As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a "Yes", he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a "Yes". Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about "nothing" ("<a href="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a>"). In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.

Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects.

According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by US$15.8 billion to US$78.5 billion. As of January 2014, most of Gates' assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp. On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become Technology Advisor alongside new CEO <a href="Satya%20Nadella">Satya Nadella</a>.

Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: "... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism." Gates also identified innovation as the "real driver of progress" and pronounced that "America's way better today than it's ever been." 

Gates has recently expressed concern about the existential threats of <a href="superintelligence">superintelligence</a>; in a <a href="Reddit">Reddit</a> "ask me anything", he stated that
First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with <a href="Elon%20Musk">Elon Musk</a> and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.
In a March 2015 interview, with <a href="Baidu">Baidu</a>'s CEO, <a href="Robin%20Li">Robin Li</a>, Gates claimed he would "highly recommend" <a href="Nick%20Bostrom">Nick Bostrom</a>'s recent work, "".

Gates' days are planned for him, similar to the <a href="US%20President">US President</a>'s schedule, on a minute-by-minute basis.

Gates married <a href="Melinda%20Gates">Melinda French</a> on a golf course on the Hawaiian island of <a href="Lanai">Lanai</a> on January 1, 1994; he was 38 and she was 29. They have three children: Jennifer Katharine (b. 1996), Rory John (b. 1999), and Phoebe Adele (b. 2002). The family resides in a <a href="Bill%20Gates%27%20house">modern design mansion</a>, which is an <a href="earth%20sheltering">earth-sheltered house</a> in the side of a hill overlooking <a href="Lake%20Washington">Lake Washington</a> in Medina near <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> in <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington State</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. According to 2007 <a href="King%20County%2C%20Washington">King County</a> public records, the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125 million, and the annual property taxes are $991,000. The estate has a swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a gym and a dining room.

In an interview with "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", Gates stated in regard to his faith:
The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.

In the same interview, Gates said: "I agree with people like <a href="Richard%20Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know."

The <a href="Codex%20Leicester">Codex Leicester</a> is one of Gates' private acquisitions. He purchased the collection of famous scientific writings by <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> for $30.8 million at an auction in 1994. Gates is also known for being an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from "<a href="The%20Great%20Gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a>". He also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.

In 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed $101 billion. Despite his wealth and extensive business travel, Gates usually flew <a href="coach%20class">coach</a> in <a href="commercial%20aircraft">commercial aircraft</a> until 1997, when he bought a private jet. Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the <a href="dot-com%20bubble">dot-com bubble</a> burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought. In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind <a href="Carlos%20Slim">Carlos Slim</a>, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List. Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014 (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from 40 billion to more than 82 billion.

Bill Gates has held the top spot on the list of <a href="The%20World%27s%20Billionaires">The World's Billionaires</a> for 18 out of the past 23 years.

Gates has several investments outside Microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of $616,667 and $350,000 bonus totalling $966,667. In 1989, he founded <a href="Branded%20Entertainment%20Network">Corbis</a>, a digital imaging company. In 2004, he became a director of <a href="Berkshire%20Hathaway">Berkshire Hathaway</a>, the investment company headed by long-time friend <a href="Warren%20Buffett">Warren Buffett</a>. In 2016, he was discussing his gaming habits when he revealed that he was color-blind.

In a <a href="BBC">BBC</a> interview, Gates claimed "I've paid more tax than any individual ever, and gladly so... I've paid over $6 billion in taxes." He is a proponent of higher taxes, particularly for the rich.

In 2009, Gates and <a href="Warren%20Buffett">Warren Buffett</a> founded <a href="The%20Giving%20Pledge">The Giving Pledge</a>, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy.

Gates studied the work of <a href="Andrew%20Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a> and <a href="John%20D.%20Rockefeller">John D. Rockefeller</a>, and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the "William H. Gates Foundation." In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations and Gates donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the charitable <a href="Bill%20%26amp%3B%20Melinda%20Gates%20Foundation">Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation</a>, which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6 billion. The Foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the <a href="Wellcome%20Trust">Wellcome Trust</a>.

Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of <a href="David%20Rockefeller">David Rockefeller</a> as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the <a href="Rockefeller%20family">Rockefeller family</a>'s philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations. As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28 billion to charity; the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.

The foundation is organized into four program areas: Global Development Division, Global Health Division, United States Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division. The foundation supports the use of <a href="genetically%20modified%20organism">genetically modified organism</a>s in agricultural development. Specifically, the foundation is supporting the <a href="International%20Rice%20Research%20Institute">International Rice Research Institute</a> in developing <a href="Golden%20Rice">Golden Rice</a>, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat <a href="Vitamin%20A%20deficiency">Vitamin A deficiency</a>.

Melinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away half of its value, as detailed in "<a href="The%20Power%20of%20Half">The Power of Half</a>". Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Gates, investor <a href="Warren%20Buffett">Warren Buffett</a>, and Facebook founder and CEO <a href="Mark%20Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> signed a commitment they called the "Gates-Buffet <a href="Giving%20Pledge">Giving Pledge</a>." The pledge is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth over the course of time to charity.

Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20 million to the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) for the construction of a computer laboratory named the "William H. Gates Building" that was designed by architect <a href="Frank%20Gehry">Frank Gehry</a>. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.

The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the <a href="Harvard%20John%20A.%20Paulson%20School%20of%20Engineering%20and%20Applied%20Sciences">Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a> is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction. Gates also donated $6 million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a>. The building contains the Computer Science Department (CSD) and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.

On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates posted a video of himself on Facebook in which he is seen <a href="Ice%20Bucket%20Challenge">dumping a bucket of ice water on his head</a>. Gates posted the video after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg challenged him to do so in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS (<a href="amyotrophic%20lateral%20sclerosis">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a>).

Since about 2005, Bill Gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global <a href="sanitation">sanitation</a> problems. For example, they announced the "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge", which has received considerable media interest. To raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, Gates drank water that was "produced from human feces" in 2014 – in fact it was produced from a <a href="sewage%20sludge%20treatment">sewage sludge treatment</a> process called the <a href="Omni%20Processor">Omni-processor</a>. In early 2015, he also appeared with <a href="Jimmy%20Fallon">Jimmy Fallon</a> on "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show">The Tonight Show</a>" and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this <a href="reclaimed%20water">reclaimed water</a> or bottled water.

Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10 million each as their inheritance. With only $30 million kept in the family, they appear to be on a course to give away about 99.96 percent of their wealth.

In 2007, the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, polluting heavily, and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell to the developing world.
In response to press criticism, the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility. It subsequently canceled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices. The Gates Millennium Scholars program has been criticized by <a href="Ernest%20W.%20Lefever">Ernest W. Lefever</a> for its exclusion of <a href="Non-Hispanic%20Whites">Caucasian</a> students. The scholarship program is administered by the <a href="United%20Negro%20College%20Fund">United Negro College Fund</a>.
In 2014, Bill Gates sparked a protest in Vancouver when he decided to donate $50 million to UNAIDS through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the purpose of mass <a href="circumcision">circumcision</a> in Zambia and <a href="Swaziland">Swaziland</a>.

On April 29, 2017, Bill Gates partnered with Swiss tennis legend <a href="Roger%20Federer">Roger Federer</a> in playing a noncompetitive tennis match to a packed house at <a href="Key%20Arena">Key Arena</a> in Seattle. The event was in support of <a href="Roger%20Federer%20Foundation">Roger Federer Foundation</a>'s charity efforts in Africa. Federer and Gates played against John Isner and <a href="Pearl%20Jam">Pearl Jam</a> lead guitarist Mike McReady. Gates and Federer won the game 6–4.

In 1987, Gates was listed as a billionaire in "Forbes" magazine's 400 Richest People in America issue. He was worth $1.25 billion and was the world's youngest self-made billionaire. Since 1987, Gates has been included in the "Forbes" <a href="The%20World%27s%20Billionaires">The World's Billionaires</a> list and was the wealthiest from 1995 to 1996, 1998 to 2007, 2009, and has been since 2014. Gates was number one on "Forbes"' <a href="Forbes%20400">400 Richest Americans</a> list from 1993 through to 2007.

"Time" magazine named Gates , as well as <a href="Time%20100">one of the 100 most influential people of 2004, 2005, and 2006</a>. "Time" also collectively named Gates, his wife Melinda and U2's lead singer <a href="Bono">Bono</a> as the 2005 <a href="Time%20Magazine%20Person%20of%20the%20Year">Persons of the Year</a> for their humanitarian efforts. In 2006, he was voted eighth in the list of "Heroes of our time". Gates was listed in the "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times%20%28UK%29">Sunday Times</a>" power list in 1999, named CEO of the year by "Chief Executive Officers magazine" in 1994, ranked number one in the "Top 50 Cyber Elite" by "Time" in 1998, ranked number two in the "<a href="Upside%20%28magazine%29">Upside</a>" Elite 100 in 1999, and was included in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" as one of the "Top 100 influential people in media" in 2001.

According to "Forbes", Gates was ranked as the fourth most powerful person in the world in 2012, up from fifth in 2011.

Belgian Blue

The Belgian Blue (, ) is a breed of <a href="beef">beef</a> <a href="cattle">cattle</a> from <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>. It may also be known as the . Alternative names for this breed include Belgian Blue-White; Belgian White and Blue Pied; Belgian White Blue; Blue; and Blue Belgian. The Belgian Blue's extremely lean, hyper-sculpted, ultra-muscular physique is termed "<a href="double-muscling">double-muscling</a>". The double-muscling <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a> is a heritable condition resulting in an increased number of muscle fibers (<a href="hyperplasia">hyperplasia</a>), instead of the (normal) enlargement of "individual" muscle fibers (<a href="hypertrophy">hypertrophy</a>).

This particular trait is shared with another breed of cattle known as <a href="Piedmontese%20%28cattle%29">Piedmontese</a>. Both of these breeds have an increased ability to convert feed into lean muscle, which causes these particular breeds' meat to have a reduced fat content and increased <a href="meat%20tenderness">tenderness</a>. The Belgian Blue is named after their typically blue-grey mottled hair colour, however its colour can vary from white to black.

The condition was first documented in 1808 by the livestock observationist, <a href="George%20Culley">George Culley</a>. The breed originated in central and upper <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> in the nineteenth century, from crossing local breeds with a <a href="Shorthorn%20cattle">Shorthorn</a> breed of cattle from the United Kingdom. It is also possible that <a href="Charolais%20cattle">Charolais cattle</a> were cross-bred as well. Belgian Blue cattle were first used as a <a href="dairy">dairy</a> and <a href="beef">beef</a> breed. The modern beef breed was developed in the 1950s by Professor Hanset, working at an <a href="artificial%20insemination">artificial insemination</a> centre in <a href="Liege%20%28province%29">Liege</a> province. The breed's characteristic gene mutation was maintained through <a href="Linebreeding%23Domestic%20animals">linebreeding</a> to the point where the condition was a fixed property in the Belgian Blue breed. In 1978 Belgian Blue cattle were introduced to the United States by Nick Tutt, a farmer from central Canada who immigrated to west Texas and showed the cattle to universities in the region.

The Belgian Blue has a natural <a href="mutation">mutation</a> in the <a href="myostatin">myostatin</a> gene which codes for the protein, <a href="myostatin">myostatin</a> ("myo" meaning muscle and "statin" meaning stop). Myostatin is a protein that inhibits muscle development. This mutation also interferes with fat deposition, resulting in very lean meat. The truncated myostatin gene is unable to function in its normal capacity, resulting in accelerated lean muscle growth. Muscle growth is due primarily to physiological changes in the animal's muscle cells (fibers) from hypertrophy to a hyperplasia mode of growth. This particular type of growth is seen early in the fetus of a pregnant dam, which results in a calf that is born with two times the number of muscle fibers at birth than a calf with no myostatin gene mutation. In addition a new born double-muscled calf’s birth weight is significantly greater than that of a normal calf .

Belgian Blue cattle have improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) due to lower feed intake compared to weight gain. The ability for these animals to have improved FCR is due to an altered composition of body weight gain which includes increased protein and decreased fat deposition. The Belgian Blue’s bone structure is the same as a normal cow, albeit holding a greater amount of muscle, which causes them to have a greater meat to bone ratio. These cattle have a muscle yield of about 20% more on average than cattle without the genetic myostatin mutation. Because of this breed’s increased muscle yield a diet containing higher protein is required to compensate for the altered mode of weight gain. During finishing this breed requires high-energy (concentrated) feeds, and will not yield the same results if put on a high-fiber diet.

The value of the double-muscling breed is due to their superior carcass characteristics. However, with decreased fat content there is decreased marbling of meat, which means the meat tenderness is reduced. Conversely, the Belgian Blue's meat tenderness has been argued to be just as tender because there are a large number of smaller muscle fibers. The Belgian Blue's meat cuts also have a lower collagen content, which allows the protein quality to be improved due to a higher yield of amino acids.

Double-muscled cows can experience <a href="dystocia">dystocia</a> (a difficult birth), even when bred to normal beef bulls or dairy bulls, because of a narrower birth canal. In addition to the dam’s reduced pelvic dimensions, the calf’s birth weight and width are increased, making parturition harder. The <a href="%3Awikt%3Aneonatal">neonatal</a> calf is so large that <a href="Caesarean%20section">Caesarean section</a>s are routinely scheduled for breeders. The bull’s testicular weight and <a href="semen">semen</a> quantity and quality have been observed as reduced, however this seems to be less of an issue when compared to the dam's difficulties in calving.

The economics of breeding and raising Belgian Blue cattle are inconclusive because of complications experienced during parturition and metabolic demand for increased concentrated feeds. The breed's increased need to have Caesarean sections when calving means increased cost and added work, and can become a welfare issue. However, the carcass value of double-muscled animals may be enhanced due to increased dressing yield, lean carcass content, and upgrading of some cuts leading to a higher proportion of higher valued cuts. The slower rate of fat deposition causes slaughtering to be delayed in most cases, which means an increase in maintenance costs in those animals. Belgian Blue cattle require more skilled management and do not thrive in harsh environments. For these reasons and others, the breed's overall production efficiency in an economic sense is still unclear.

Boron

Boron is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol B and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 5. Produced entirely by <a href="cosmic%20ray%20spallation">cosmic ray spallation</a> and <a href="supernovae">supernovae</a> and not by <a href="stellar%20nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a>, it is a low-abundance element in the <a href="Solar%20system">Solar system</a> and in the <a href="Crust%20%28geology%29">Earth's crust</a>. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the <a href="borate%20mineral">borate mineral</a>s. These are mined industrially as <a href="evaporite">evaporite</a>s, such as <a href="borax">borax</a> and <a href="kernite">kernite</a>. The largest known boron deposits are in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, the largest producer of boron minerals.

Elemental boron is a <a href="metalloid">metalloid</a> that is found in small amounts in <a href="meteoroid">meteoroid</a>s but chemically uncombined boron is not otherwise found naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure boron is produced with difficulty because of refractory contamination by carbon or other elements. Several <a href="allotropes%20of%20boron">allotropes of boron</a> exist: <a href="amorphous">amorphous</a> boron is a brown powder; crystalline boron is silvery to black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the <a href="Mohs%20scale%20of%20mineral%20hardness">Mohs scale</a>), and a poor <a href="electrical%20conductor">electrical conductor</a> at room temperature. The primary use of elemental boron is as <a href="boron%20filament">boron filament</a>s with applications similar to <a href="carbon%20fibers">carbon fibers</a> in some high-strength materials.

Boron is primarily used in chemical compounds. About half of all consumption globally, boron is used as an additive in <a href="glass%20fiber">glass fiber</a>s of boron-containing <a href="fiberglass">fiberglass</a> for insulation and structural materials. The next leading use is in <a href="polymers">polymers</a> and <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a>s in high-strength, lightweight structural and refractory materials. <a href="Borosilicate%20glass">Borosilicate glass</a> is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. Boron compounds are used as <a href="fertilizer">fertilizer</a>s in <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a> and in <a href="sodium%20perborate">sodium perborate</a> <a href="bleach">bleach</a>es. A small amount of boron is used as a <a href="dopant">dopant</a> in <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a>s, and <a href="reagents">reagent</a> intermediates in the <a href="organic%20synthesis">synthesis of organic fine chemicals</a>. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (<a href="boron-10">boron-10</a>) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.

In biology, <a href="borate">borate</a>s have low toxicity in mammals (similar to <a href="table%20salt">table salt</a>), but are more toxic to <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s and are used as <a href="insecticides">insecticides</a>. <a href="Boric%20acid">Boric acid</a> is mildly antimicrobial, and several natural boron-containing organic antibiotics are known. Boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants, making boron a necessary plant nutrient. There is no consensus on whether boron is an essential nutrient for mammals, including humans, although there is some evidence it supports bone health.

The word "boron" was coined from "<a href="borax">borax</a>", the mineral from which it was isolated, by analogy with "carbon", which boron resembles chemically. 
Borax, its mineral form then known as tincal, glazes were used in <a href="China">China</a> from AD 300, and some crude borax reached the West, where the Persian alchemist <a href="J%C4%81bir%20ibn%20Hayy%C4%81n">Jābir ibn Hayyān</a> apparently mentioned it in AD 700. <a href="Marco%20Polo">Marco Polo</a> brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Agricola, around 1600, reports the use of borax as a flux in <a href="metallurgy">metallurgy</a>. In 1777, <a href="boric%20acid">boric acid</a> was recognized in the hot springs (<a href="soffioni">soffioni</a>) near <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, Italy, and became known as "sal sedativum", with primarily medical uses. The rare mineral is called <a href="sassolite">sassolite</a>, which is found at Sasso, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. Sasso was the main source of <a href="Europe">Europe</a>an borax from 1827 to 1872, when <a href="United%20States">American</a> sources replaced it. Boron compounds were relatively rarely used until the late 1800s when <a href="Francis%20Marion%20Smith">Francis Marion Smith</a>'s <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20Borax%20Company">Pacific Coast Borax Company</a> first popularized and produced them in volume at low cost.

Boron was not recognized as an element until it was isolated by Sir <a href="Humphry%20Davy">Humphry Davy</a> and by <a href="Joseph%20Louis%20Gay-Lussac">Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac</a> and <a href="Louis%20Jacques%20Th%C3%A9nard">Louis Jacques Thénard</a>. In 1808 Davy observed that electric current sent through a solution of borates produced a brown precipitate on one of the electrodes. In his subsequent experiments, he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a>. He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named the element "boracium". Gay-Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures. By oxidizing boron with air, they showed that boric acid is an oxidation product of boron. <a href="J%C3%B6ns%20Jakob%20Berzelius">Jöns Jakob Berzelius</a> identified boron as an element in 1824. Pure boron was arguably first produced by the American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909.

The earliest routes to elemental boron involved the reduction of <a href="boric%20oxide">boric oxide</a> with metals such as <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> or <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>. However, the product is almost always contaminated with <a href="boride">boride</a>s of those metals. Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> at high temperatures. Ultrapure boron for use in the semiconductor industry is produced by the decomposition of <a href="diborane">diborane</a> at high temperatures and then further purified with the <a href="zone%20melting">zone melting</a> or <a href="Czochralski%20process">Czochralski process</a>es.

The production of boron compounds does not involve the formation of elemental boron, but exploits the convenient availability of borates.

Boron is similar to <a href="carbon">carbon</a> in its capability to form stable <a href="covalent%20bond">covalently bonded</a> molecular networks. Even nominally disordered (<a href="amorphous">amorphous</a>) boron contains regular boron <a href="icosahedra">icosahedra</a> which are, however, bonded randomly to each other without <a href="long-range%20order">long-range order</a>. <a href="Crystalline">Crystalline</a> boron is a very hard, black material with a melting point of above 2000 °C. It forms four major <a href="polymorphism%20%28materials%20science%29">polymorphs</a>: α-rhombohedral and β-rhombohedral (α-R and β-R), γ and β-tetragonal (β-T); α-tetragonal phase also exists (α-T), but is very difficult to produce without significant contamination. Most of the phases are based on B icosahedra, but the γ-phase can be described as a <a href="Sodium%20chloride">rocksalt</a>-type arrangement of the icosahedra and B atomic pairs. It can be produced by compressing other boron phases to 12–20 GPa and heating to 1500–1800 °C; it remains stable after releasing the temperature and pressure. The T phase is produced at similar pressures, but higher temperatures of 1800–2200 °C. As to the α and β phases, they might both coexist at <a href="Standard%20conditions%20for%20temperature%20and%20pressure">ambient conditions</a> with the β phase being more stable. Compressing boron above 160 GPa produces a boron phase with an as yet unknown structure, and this phase is a <a href="superconductor">superconductor</a> at temperatures 6–12 K. <a href="Borospherene">Borospherene</a> (<a href="fullerene">fullerene</a>-like B) molecules) and <a href="borophene">borophene</a> (proposed <a href="graphene">graphene</a>-like structure) have been described in 2014.

Elemental boron is rare and poorly studied because the pure material is extremely difficult to prepare. Most studies of "boron" involve samples that contain small amounts of carbon. The chemical behavior of boron resembles that of <a href="silicon">silicon</a> more than <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>. Crystalline boron is chemically inert and resistant to attack by boiling <a href="hydrofluoric%20acid">hydrofluoric</a> or <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a>. When finely divided, it is attacked slowly by hot concentrated <a href="hydrogen%20peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a>, hot concentrated <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a>, hot <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> or hot mixture of sulfuric and <a href="chromic%20acid">chromic acid</a>s.

The rate of oxidation of boron depends on the crystallinity, particle size, purity and temperature. Boron does not react with air at room temperature, but at higher temperatures it burns to form <a href="boron%20trioxide">boron trioxide</a>:
Boron undergoes halogenation to give trihalides; for example,
The trichloride in practice is usually made from the oxide.

In the most familiar compounds, boron has the formal oxidation state III. These include oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and halides.

The trihalides adopt a planar trigonal structure. These compounds are <a href="Lewis%20acid">Lewis acid</a>s in that they readily form <a href="adduct">adduct</a>s with electron-pair donors, which are called <a href="Lewis%20base">Lewis base</a>s. For example, fluoride (F) and <a href="boron%20trifluoride">boron trifluoride</a> (BF) combined to give the <a href="tetrafluoroborate">tetrafluoroborate</a> anion, BF. Boron trifluoride is used in the petrochemical industry as a catalyst. The halides react with water to form <a href="boric%20acid">boric acid</a>.

Boron is found in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often associated with other elements. More than one hundred <a href="borate%20mineral">borate mineral</a>s contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral <a href="borax">borax</a>, shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na) in borax.

Boranes are chemical compounds of boron and hydrogen, with the generic formula of BH. These compounds do not occur in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, some violently. The parent member BH is called borane, but it is known only in the gaseous state, and dimerises to form diborane, BH. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral, some of which exist as isomers. For example, isomers of BH are based on the fusion of two 10-atom clusters.

The most important boranes are diborane BH and two of its pyrolysis products, pentaborane BH and decaborane BH. A large number of anionic boron hydrides are known, e.g. [BH].

The formal <a href="oxidation%20number">oxidation number</a> in boranes is positive, and is based on the assumption that hydrogen is counted as −1 as in active metal hydrides. The mean oxidation number for the borons is then simply the ratio of hydrogen to boron in the molecule. For example, in diborane BH, the boron oxidation state is +3, but in decaborane BH, it is / or +1.4. In these compounds the oxidation state of boron is often not a whole number.

The <a href="boron%20nitride">boron nitride</a>s are notable for the variety of structures that they adopt. They exhibit structures analogous to various <a href="allotropes%20of%20carbon">allotropes of carbon</a>, including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the diamond-like structure, called cubic boron nitride (tradename <a href="Borazon">Borazon</a>), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds can be viewed as a <a href="coordinate%20covalent%20bond">coordinate covalent bond</a>, wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the <a href="Lewis%20base">Lewis base</a> to a bond to the <a href="Lewis%20acid">Lewis acid</a>ic boron(III) centre. Cubic boron nitride, among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogue of graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the positively charged boron and negatively charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane. Consequently, graphite and h-BN have very different properties, although both are lubricants, as these planes slip past each other easily. However, h-BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions.

A large number of organoboron compounds are known and many are useful in <a href="organic%20synthesis">organic synthesis</a>. Many are produced from <a href="hydroboration%E2%80%93oxidation%20reaction">hydroboration</a>, which employs <a href="diborane">diborane</a>, BH, a simple <a href="borane">borane</a> chemical. Organoboron(III) compounds are usually tetrahedral or trigonal planar, for example, <a href="tetraphenylborate">tetraphenylborate</a>, [B(CH)] vs. <a href="triphenylborane">triphenylborane</a>, B(CH). However, multiple boron atoms reacting with each other have a tendency to form novel dodecahedral (12-sided) and icosahedral (20-sided) structures composed completely of boron atoms, or with varying numbers of carbon heteroatoms.

Organoboron chemicals have been employed in uses as diverse as <a href="boron%20carbide">boron carbide</a> (see below), a complex very hard ceramic composed of boron-carbon cluster anions and cations, to <a href="carborane">carborane</a>s, carbon-boron <a href="cluster%20chemistry">cluster chemistry</a> compounds that can be halogenated to form reactive structures including <a href="carborane%20acid">carborane acid</a>, a <a href="superacid">superacid</a>. As one example, carboranes form useful molecular moieties that add considerable amounts of boron to other biochemicals in order to synthesize boron-containing compounds for <a href="boron%20neutron%20capture%20therapy">boron neutron capture therapy</a> for cancer.

Although these are not found on Earth naturally, boron forms a variety of stable compounds with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in <a href="borane">boron hydrides</a> and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N, cannot be isolated in condensed form, but <a href="diboron%20tetrafluoride">BF</a> and BCl are well characterized.

Binary metal-boron compounds, the metal borides, contain boron in negative oxidation states. Illustrative is <a href="magnesium%20diboride">magnesium diboride</a> (MgB). Each boron atom has a formal −1 charge and magnesium is assigned a formal charge of +2. In this material, the boron centers are trigonal planar with an extra double bond for each boron, forming sheets akin to the carbon in <a href="graphite">graphite</a>. However, unlike hexagonal boron nitride, which lacks electrons in the plane of the covalent atoms, the delocalized electrons in magnesium diboride allow it to conduct electricity similar to isoelectronic graphite. In 2001, this material was found to be a high-temperature <a href="superconductor">superconductor</a>.

Certain other metal borides find specialized applications as hard materials for cutting tools. Often the boron in borides has fractional oxidation states, such as −1/3 in <a href="calcium%20hexaboride">calcium hexaboride</a> (CaB).

From the structural perspective, the most distinctive chemical compounds of boron are the hydrides. Included in this series are the cluster compounds <a href="dodecaborate">dodecaborate</a> (BH), <a href="decaborane">decaborane</a> (BH), and the <a href="carborane">carborane</a>s such as CBH. Characteristically such compounds contain boron with coordination numbers greater than four.

Boron has two naturally occurring and stable <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s, B (80.1%) and B (19.9%). The mass difference results in a wide range of δB values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the B and B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is B which decays through <a href="proton%20emission">proton emission</a> and <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a>. It has a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 3.5×10 s. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH) and <a href="tetrahydroxyborate">[B(OH)]</a>. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during HO phase changes in <a href="hydrothermal">hydrothermal</a> systems, and during <a href="hydrothermal%20alteration">hydrothermal alteration</a> of <a href="rock%20%28geology%29">rock</a>. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the [B(OH)] <a href="ion">ion</a> onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in B(OH) and therefore may be responsible for the large B enrichment in seawater relative to both <a href="ocean">ocean</a>ic crust and <a href="continent">continent</a>al crust; this difference may act as an <a href="isotopic%20signature">isotopic signature</a>.

The exotic B exhibits a <a href="nuclear%20halo">nuclear halo</a>, i.e. its radius is appreciably larger than that predicted by the <a href="semi-empirical%20mass%20formula">liquid drop model</a>.

The B isotope is useful for capturing <a href="thermal%20neutron">thermal neutron</a>s (see <a href="neutron%20cross%20section%23Typical%20cross%20sections">neutron cross section#Typical cross sections</a>). The <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear industry</a> enriches natural boron to nearly pure B. The less-valuable by-product, depleted boron, is nearly pure B.

Because of its high neutron cross-section, boron-10 is often used to control fission in nuclear reactors as a neutron-capturing substance. Several industrial-scale enrichment processes have been developed; however, only the fractionated vacuum distillation of the <a href="dimethyl%20ether">dimethyl ether</a> adduct of <a href="boron%20trifluoride">boron trifluoride</a> (DME-BF) and column chromatography of borates are being used.

Enriched boron or B is used in both radiation shielding and is the primary nuclide used in <a href="neutron%20capture%20therapy%20of%20cancer">neutron capture therapy of cancer</a>. In the latter ("boron neutron capture therapy" or BNCT), a compound containing B is incorporated into a pharmaceutical which is selectively taken up by a malignant tumor and tissues near it. The patient is then treated with a beam of low energy neutrons at a relatively low neutron radiation dose. The neutrons, however, trigger energetic and short-range secondary <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a> and lithium-7 heavy ion radiation that are products of the boron + neutron <a href="nuclear%20reaction">nuclear reaction</a>, and this ion radiation additionally bombards the tumor, especially from inside the tumor cells.

In nuclear reactors, B is used for reactivity control and in <a href="scram">emergency shutdown systems</a>. It can serve either function in the form of <a href="borosilicate">borosilicate</a> <a href="control%20rods">control rods</a> or as <a href="boric%20acid">boric acid</a>. In <a href="pressurized%20water%20reactor">pressurized water reactor</a>s, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as <a href="fissile">fissile</a> material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.

In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, B has a theoretical role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN <a href="inorganic%20nanotube">nanotube</a> material) which would also serve a special role in the radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with <a href="cosmic%20rays">cosmic rays</a>, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy <a href="spallation">spallation</a> neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as <a href="polyethylene">polyethylene</a>, but the moderated neutrons continue to be a radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, Li and B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.

<a href="Cosmic%20radiation">Cosmic radiation</a> will produce secondary neutrons if it hits spacecraft structures. Those neutrons will be captured in B, if it is present in the spacecraft's <a href="semiconductor">semiconductor</a>s, producing a <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>, an <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>, and a <a href="lithium">lithium</a> ion. Those resultant decay products may then irradiate nearby semiconductor "chip" structures, causing data loss (bit flipping, or <a href="single%20event%20upset">single event upset</a>). In <a href="radiation-hardened">radiation-hardened</a> semiconductor designs, one countermeasure is to use "depleted boron", which is greatly enriched in B and contains almost no B. This is useful because B is largely immune to radiation damage. Depleted boron is a byproduct of the <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear industry</a>.

B is also a candidate as a fuel for <a href="aneutronic%20fusion">aneutronic fusion</a>. When struck by a proton with energy of about 500 k<a href="electronvolt">eV</a>, it produces three alpha particles and 8.7 MeV of energy. Most other fusion reactions involving hydrogen and helium produce penetrating neutron radiation, which weakens reactor structures and induces long-term radioactivity, thereby endangering operating personnel. However, the <a href="alpha%20particles">alpha particles</a> from B fusion can be turned directly into electric power, and all radiation stops as soon as the reactor is turned off.

Both B and B possess <a href="nuclear%20spin">nuclear spin</a>. The nuclear spin of B is 3 and that of B is . These isotopes are, therefore, of use in <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance">nuclear magnetic resonance</a> spectroscopy; and spectrometers specially adapted to detecting the boron-11 nuclei are available commercially. The B and B nuclei also cause splitting in the <a href="resonances">resonances</a> of attached nuclei.

Boron is rare in the Universe and solar system due to trace formation in the <a href="Big%20Bang">Big Bang</a> and in stars. It is formed in minor amounts in <a href="cosmic%20ray%20spallation">cosmic ray spallation</a> <a href="nucleosynthesis">nucleosynthesis</a> and may be found uncombined in <a href="cosmic%20dust">cosmic dust</a> and <a href="meteoroid">meteoroid</a> materials.

In the high oxygen environment of Earth, boron is always found fully oxidized to borate. Boron does not appear on Earth in elemental form. Extremely small traces of elemental boron were detected in Lunar regolith

Although boron is a relatively rare element in the Earth's crust, representing only 0.001% of the crust mass, it can be highly concentrated by the action of water, in which many borates are soluble. 
It is found naturally combined in compounds such as <a href="borax">borax</a> and <a href="boric%20acid">boric acid</a> (sometimes found in <a href="volcano">volcanic</a> spring waters). About a hundred <a href="borate%20minerals">borate minerals</a> are known.

On September 5, 2017, scientists reported that the <a href="Curiosity%20%28rover%29">"Curiosity" rover</a> detected boron, an essential ingredient for <a href="life">life</a> on <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, on the planet <a href="Mars">Mars</a>. Such a finding, along with previous discoveries that water may have been present on ancient Mars, further supports the possible early habitability of <a href="Gale%20%28crater%29">Gale Crater</a> on Mars.

Economically important sources of boron are the minerals <a href="colemanite">colemanite</a>, rasorite (<a href="kernite">kernite</a>), <a href="ulexite">ulexite</a> and <a href="tincal">tincal</a>. Together these constitute 90% of mined boron-containing ore. The largest global borax deposits known, many still untapped, are in Central and Western <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, including the provinces of <a href="Eski%C5%9Fehir">Eskişehir</a>, <a href="K%C3%BCtahya">Kütahya</a> and <a href="Bal%C4%B1kesir">Balıkesir</a>. Global proven boron mineral mining reserves exceed one billion metric tonnes, against a yearly production of about four million tonnes.

<a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> and the United States are the largest producers of boron products. Turkey produces about half of the global yearly demand, through <a href="Eti%20Mine%20Works">Eti Mine Works</a> () a <a href="Turkey">Turkish</a> <a href="state-owned%20company">state-owned</a> <a href="mining%20industry">mining</a> and <a href="chemical%20industry">chemicals</a> company focusing on boron products. It holds a <a href="government%20monopoly">government monopoly</a> on the mining of <a href="borate%20minerals">borate minerals</a> in Turkey, which possesses 72% of the world's known deposits. In 2012, it held a 47% <a href="market%20share">share</a> of production of global borate minerals, ahead of its main competitor, <a href="Rio%20Tinto%20Group">Rio Tinto Group</a>.

Almost a quarter (23%) of global boron production comes from the single <a href="Rio%20Tinto%20Borax%20Mine">Rio Tinto Borax Mine</a> (also known as the U.S. Borax Boron Mine) near <a href="Boron%2C%20California">Boron, California</a>.

The average cost of crystalline boron is $5/g. Free boron is chiefly used in making boron fibers, where it is deposited by <a href="chemical%20vapor%20deposition">chemical vapor deposition</a> on a <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a> core (see below). Boron fibers are used in lightweight composite applications, such as high strength tapes. This use is a very small fraction of total boron use. Boron is introduced into semiconductors as boron compounds, by ion implantation.

Estimated global consumption of boron (almost entirely as boron compounds) was about 4 million tonnes of BO in 2012. Boron mining and refining capacities are considered to be adequate to meet expected levels of growth through the next decade.

The form in which boron is consumed has changed in recent years. The use of ores like <a href="colemanite">colemanite</a> has declined following concerns over <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a> content. Consumers have moved toward the use of refined borates and boric acid that have a lower pollutant content.

Increasing demand for boric acid has led a number of producers to invest in additional capacity. Turkey's state-owned <a href="Eti%20Mine%20Works">Eti Mine Works</a> opened a new boric acid plant with the production capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year at <a href="Emet">Emet</a> in 2003. <a href="Rio%20Tinto%20Group">Rio Tinto Group</a> increased the capacity of its boron plant from 260,000 tonnes per year in 2003 to 310,000 tonnes per year by May 2005, with plans to grow this to 366,000 tonnes per year in 2006. Chinese boron producers have been unable to meet rapidly growing demand for high quality borates. This has led to imports of sodium tetraborate (<a href="borax">borax</a>) growing by a hundredfold between 2000 and 2005 and boric acid imports increasing by 28% per year over the same period.

The rise in global demand has been driven by high growth rates in <a href="glass%20fiber">glass fiber</a>, <a href="fiberglass">fiberglass</a> and <a href="borosilicate">borosilicate</a> glassware production. A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade boron-containing fiberglass in Asia, has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.

Nearly all boron ore extracted from the Earth is destined for refinement into <a href="boric%20acid">boric acid</a> and <a href="sodium%20tetraborate">sodium tetraborate pentahydrate</a>. In the United States, 70% of the boron is used for the production of glass and ceramics.
The major global industrial-scale use of boron compounds (about 46% of end-use) is in production of <a href="glass%20fiber">glass fiber</a> for boron-containing insulating and structural <a href="fiberglass">fiberglass</a>es, especially in Asia. Boron is added to the glass as borax pentahydrate or boron oxide, to influence the strength or fluxing qualities of the glass fibers. Another 10% of global boron production is for <a href="borosilicate%20glass">borosilicate glass</a> as used in high strength glassware. About 15% of global boron is used in boron ceramics, including super-hard materials discussed below. Agriculture consumes 11% of global boron production, and bleaches and detergents about 6%.

<a href="Boron%20fiber">Boron fiber</a>s (boron filaments) are high-strength, lightweight materials that are used chiefly for advanced <a href="aerospace">aerospace</a> structures as a component of <a href="composite%20material">composite material</a>s, as well as limited production consumer and sporting goods such as <a href="golf%20club%20%28equipment%29">golf club</a>s and <a href="fishing%20rod">fishing rod</a>s. The fibers can be produced by <a href="chemical%20vapor%20deposition">chemical vapor deposition</a> of boron on a <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a> filament.

Boron fibers and sub-millimeter sized crystalline boron springs are produced by <a href="laser">laser</a>-assisted <a href="chemical%20vapor%20deposition">chemical vapor deposition</a>. Translation of the focused laser beam allows to produce even complex helical structures. Such structures show good mechanical properties (<a href="elastic%20modulus">elastic modulus</a> 450 GPa, fracture strain 3.7%, fracture stress 17 GPa) and can be applied as reinforcement of ceramics or in <a href="microelectromechanical%20systems">micromechanical systems</a>.

Fiberglass is a <a href="fiber%20reinforced%20plastic">fiber reinforced polymer</a> made of <a href="plastic">plastic</a> reinforced by <a href="glass%20fiber">glass fiber</a>s, commonly woven into a mat. The glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase the strength of the glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of <a href="silica">silica</a>, which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.

The highly boronated glasses used in fiberglass are E-glass (named for "Electrical" use, but now the most common fiberglass for general use). E-glass is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics. Other common high-boron glasses include C-glass, an alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass staple fibers and insulation, and D-glass, a <a href="borosilicate%20glass">borosilicate glass</a>, named for its low Dielectric constant).

Not all fiberglasses contain boron, but on a global scale, most of the fiberglass used does contain it. Because the ubiquitous use of fiberglass in construction and insulation, boron-containing fiberglasses consume half the global production of boron, and are the single largest commercial boron market.

<a href="Borosilicate">Borosilicate</a> glass, which is typically 12–15% BO, 80% SiO, and 2% AlO, has a low <a href="coefficient%20of%20thermal%20expansion">coefficient of thermal expansion</a> giving it a good resistance to thermal shock. <a href="Schott%20AG">Schott AG</a>'s "Duran" and <a href="Owens-Corning">Owens-Corning</a>'s trademarked <a href="Pyrex">Pyrex</a> are two major brand names for this glass, used both in <a href="laboratory%20glassware">laboratory glassware</a> and in consumer <a href="cookware%20and%20bakeware">cookware and bakeware</a>, chiefly for this resistance.

Several boron compounds are known for their extreme hardness and toughness.
<a href="Boron%20carbide">Boron carbide</a> is a ceramic material which is obtained by decomposing BO with carbon in the electric furnace:

Boron carbide's structure is only approximately BC, and it shows a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with <a href="empirical%20formula">empirical formula</a> BC (i.e., with B dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and some smaller (B) octahedra are present as well (see the boron carbide article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in <a href="vehicle%20armour">tank armor</a>, <a href="bulletproof%20vest">bulletproof vest</a>s, and numerous other structural applications.

Boron carbide's ability to absorb neutrons without forming long-lived <a href="radionuclide">radionuclide</a>s (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, to increase its surface area.

Boron carbide and cubic boron nitride powders are widely used as abrasives. <a href="Boron%20nitride">Boron nitride</a> is a material isoelectronic to <a href="carbon">carbon</a>. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN is used as a high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name <a href="borazon">borazon</a>, is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only slightly smaller than, but its chemical stability is superior, to that of diamond. <a href="Heterodiamond">Heterodiamond</a> (also called BCN) is another diamond-like boron compound.

Metal <a href="boride">boride</a>s are used for coating tools through <a href="chemical%20vapor%20deposition">chemical vapor deposition</a> or <a href="physical%20vapor%20deposition">physical vapor deposition</a>. Implantation of boron ions into metals and alloys, through <a href="ion%20implantation">ion implantation</a> or <a href="ion%20beam%20deposition">ion beam deposition</a>, results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and microhardness. Laser alloying has also been successfully used for the same purpose. These borides are an alternative to diamond coated tools, and their (treated) surfaces have similar properties to those of the bulk boride.

For example, <a href="rhenium%20diboride">rhenium diboride</a> can be produced at ambient pressures, but is rather expensive because of rhenium. The hardness of ReB exhibits considerable <a href="anisotropy">anisotropy</a> because of its hexagonal layered structure. Its value is comparable to that of <a href="tungsten%20carbide">tungsten carbide</a>, <a href="silicon%20carbide">silicon carbide</a>, <a href="titanium%20diboride">titanium diboride</a> or <a href="zirconium%20diboride">zirconium diboride</a>.
Similarly, AlMgB + TiB composites possess high hardness and wear resistance and are used in either bulk form or as coatings for components exposed to high temperatures and wear loads.

Borax is used in various household laundry and cleaning products, including the "<a href="20%20Mule%20Team%20Borax">20 Mule Team Borax</a>" laundry booster and "<a href="Boraxo">Boraxo</a>" powdered hand soap. It is also present in some <a href="tooth%20bleaching">tooth bleaching</a> formulas.

<a href="Sodium%20perborate">Sodium perborate</a> serves as a source of <a href="active%20oxygen">active oxygen</a> in many <a href="detergent">detergent</a>s, <a href="laundry%20detergent">laundry detergent</a>s, <a href="cleaning%20product">cleaning product</a>s, and laundry <a href="bleach%20%28chemical%29">bleaches</a>. However, despite its name, "Borateem" laundry bleach no longer contains any boron compounds, using <a href="sodium%20percarbonate">sodium percarbonate</a> instead as a bleaching agent.

Boric acid is used as an insecticide, notably against ants, fleas, and cockroaches.

Boron is a useful <a href="dopant">dopant</a> for such semiconductors as <a href="silicon">silicon</a>, <a href="germanium">germanium</a>, and <a href="silicon%20carbide">silicon carbide</a>. Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a <a href="electron%20hole">hole</a> resulting in <a href="p-type%20semiconductor">p-type</a> conductivity. Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its <a href="atomic%20diffusion">atomic diffusion</a> at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (BO), liquid (BBr), or gaseous boron sources (BH or BF). However, after the 1970s, it was mostly replaced by <a href="ion%20implantation">ion implantation</a>, which relies mostly on BF as a boron source. Boron trichloride gas is also an important chemical in semiconductor industry, however not for doping but rather for <a href="plasma%20etching">plasma etching</a> of metals and their oxides. Triethylborane is also injected into <a href="chemical%20vapor%20deposition">vapor deposition</a> reactors as a boron source. Examples are the plasma deposition of boron-containing hard carbon films, silicon nitride-boron nitride films, and for <a href="doping%20%28semiconductor%29">doping</a> of <a href="diamond">diamond</a> film with boron.

Boron is a component of <a href="neodymium%20magnet">neodymium magnet</a>s (NdFeB), which are among the strongest type of permanent magnet. These magnets are found in a variety of electromechanical and electronic devices, such as <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI) medical imaging systems, in compact and relatively small motors and <a href="actuator">actuator</a>s. As examples, computer HDDs (hard disk drives), CD (compact disk) and DVD (digital versatile disk) players rely on neodymium magnet motors to deliver intense rotary power in a remarkably compact package. In mobile phones 'Neo' magnets provide the magnetic field which allows tiny speakers to deliver appreciable audio power.

Boron shielding is used as a control for <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s, taking advantage of its high cross-section for neutron capture.

In <a href="pressurized%20water%20reactor">pressurized water reactor</a>s a variable concentration of boronic acid in the cooling water is used to compensate the variable reactivity of the fuel: when new rods are inserted the concentration of boronic acid is maximal, and then reduced during the lifetime.


<a href="Boric%20acid">Boric acid</a> has antiseptic, antifungal, and antiviral properties and for these reasons is applied as a water clarifier in swimming pool water treatment. Mild solutions of boric acid have been used as eye antiseptics.

<a href="Bortezomib">Bortezomib</a> (marketed as Velcade and Cytomib). Boron appears as an active element in its first-approved organic pharmaceutical in the pharmaceutical bortezomib, a new class of drug called the proteasome inhibitors, which are active in myeloma and one form of lymphoma (it is in currently in experimental trials against other types of lymphoma). The boron atom in bortezomib binds the catalytic site of the <a href="proteasome">26S proteasome</a> with high affinity and specificity.

<a href="Tavaborole">Tavaborole</a> (marketed as Kerydin) is a <a href="Aminoacyl%20tRNA%20synthetase">Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase</a> inhibitor which is used to treat toenail fungus. It gained FDA approval in July 2014.

Dioxaborolane chemistry enables radioactive <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a> (<a href="Fluorine-18">F</a>) labeling of <a href="Antibody">antibodies</a> or <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s, which allows for <a href="positron%20emission%20tomography">positron emission tomography</a> (PET) imaging of <a href="cancer">cancer</a> and <a href="hemorrhages">hemorrhages</a>, respectively.

<a href="Magnesium%20diboride">Magnesium diboride</a> is an important <a href="superconductivity">superconducting material</a> with the transition temperature of 39 K. MgB wires are produced with the <a href="powder-in-tube">powder-in-tube</a> process and applied in superconducting magnets.

Amorphous boron is used as a melting point depressant in nickel-chromium braze alloys.

Hexagonal <a href="boron%20nitride">boron nitride</a> forms atomically thin layers, which have been used to enhance the <a href="electron%20mobility">electron mobility</a> in <a href="graphene">graphene</a> devices. It also forms nanotubular structures (<a href="boron%20nitride%23Boron%20nitride%20nanotubes">BNNTs</a>), which have with high strength, high chemical stability, and high <a href="thermal%20conductivity">thermal conductivity</a>, among its list of desirable properties.

Boron is an essential plant <a href="nutrient">nutrient</a>, required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of greater than 1.0 <a href="parts%20per%20million">ppm</a> lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8 ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than 1.8 ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0 ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive.

It is thought that boron plays several essential roles in animals, including humans, but the exact physiological role is poorly understood. A small human trial published in 1987 reported on postmenopausal women first made boron deficient and then repleted with 3 mg/day. Boron supplementation markedly reduced urinary calcium excretion and elevated the serum concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol and testosterone.

The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that boron is an essential nutrient for humans, so neither a <a href="Recommended%20Dietary%20Allowance">Recommended Dietary Allowance</a> (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. Adult dietary intake is estimated at 0.9 to 1.4 mg/day, with about 90% absorbed. What is absorbed is mostly excreted in urine. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level for adults is 20 mg/day.

In 2013, a hypothesis suggested it was possible that boron and molybdenum catalyzed the production of <a href="RNA">RNA</a> on <a href="Mars">Mars</a> with life being transported to Earth via a meteorite around 3 billion years ago.

There exist several known boron-containing natural <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s. The first one found was <a href="boromycin">boromycin</a>, isolated from <a href="streptomyces">streptomyces</a>.

<a href="Congenital%20endothelial%20dystrophy%20type%202">Congenital endothelial dystrophy type 2</a>, a rare form of <a href="corneal%20dystrophy%20%28human%29">corneal dystrophy</a>, is linked to mutations in <a href="SLC4A11">SLC4A11</a> gene that encodes a transporter reportedly regulating the intracellular concentration of boron.

For determination of boron content in food or materials the <a href="colorimetry">colorimetric</a> "curcumin method" is used. Boron is converted to boric acid or <a href="borate">borate</a>s and on reaction with <a href="curcumin">curcumin</a> in acidic solution, a red colored boron-<a href="chelate">chelate</a> complex, <a href="rosocyanine">rosocyanine</a>, is formed.

Elemental boron, <a href="boron%20trioxide">boron oxide</a>, <a href="boric%20acid">boric acid</a>, borates, and many <a href="organoboron%20chemistry">organoboron compounds</a> are relatively nontoxic to humans and animals (with toxicity similar to that of table salt). The <a href="median%20lethal%20dose">LD</a> (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 6 g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD above 2 g are considered nontoxic. An intake of 4 g/day of boric acid was reported without incident, but more than this is considered toxic in more than a few doses. Intakes of more than 0.5 grams per day for 50 days cause minor digestive and other problems suggestive of toxicity.

Single medical doses of 20 g of <a href="boric%20acid">boric acid</a> for <a href="neutron%20capture%20therapy">neutron capture therapy</a> have been used without undue toxicity.

Boric acid is more toxic to insects than to mammals, and is routinely used as an insecticide.

The <a href="boranes">boranes</a> (boron hydrogen compounds) and similar gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. As usual, it is not an element that is intrinsically poisonous, but their toxicity depends on structure. The boranes are also highly flammable and require special care when handling. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.
Boron is necessary for plant growth, but an excess of boron is toxic to plants, and occurs particularly in acidic soil. It presents as a yellowing from the tip inwards of the oldest leaves and black spots in barley leaves, but it can be confused with other stresses such as magnesium deficiency in other plants.

Bromine

Bromine is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Br and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 35. It is the third-lightest <a href="halogen">halogen</a>, and is a fuming red-brown <a href="liquid">liquid</a> at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similarly coloured gas. Its properties are thus intermediate between those of <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a> and <a href="iodine">iodine</a>. Isolated independently by two chemists, <a href="Carl%20Jacob%20L%C3%B6wig">Carl Jacob Löwig</a> (in 1825) and <a href="Antoine%20Jerome%20Balard">Antoine Jérôme Balard</a> (in 1826), its name was derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "βρῶμος" "stench", referencing its sharp and disagreeable smell.

Elemental bromine is very reactive and thus does not occur <a href="free%20element">free</a> in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide <a href="Ionic%20salt">salts</a>, analogous to <a href="table%20salt">table salt</a>. While it is rather rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br) has caused its accumulation in the oceans. Commercially the element is easily extracted from <a href="brine">brine</a> pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. The mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth of that of chlorine.

At high temperatures, <a href="organobromine%20compound">organobromine compound</a>s readily dissociate to yield free bromine atoms, a process that stops <a href="free%20radical">free radical</a> chemical <a href="chain%20reaction">chain reaction</a>s. This effect makes organobromine compounds useful as <a href="fire%20retardant">fire retardant</a>s, and more than half the bromine produced worldwide each year is put to this purpose. Unfortunately, the same property causes <a href="sunlight">sunlight</a> to dissociate volatile organobromine compounds in the <a href="atmosphere">atmosphere</a> to yield free bromine atoms, causing <a href="ozone%20depletion">ozone depletion</a>. As a result, many organobromide compounds—such as the <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a> <a href="Bromomethane">methyl bromide</a>—are no longer used. Bromine compounds are still used in <a href="well%20drilling%20fluids">well drilling fluids</a>, in <a href="photographic%20film">photographic film</a>, and as an intermediate in the manufacture of <a href="organic%20compound">organic</a> chemicals.

Bromine has sometimes been considered to be possibly essential in humans, but this is supported by only limited circumstantial evidence, and no clear biological role. As a <a href="pharmaceutical">pharmaceutical</a>, the simple bromide ion (Br) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide <a href="Salt%20%28chemistry%29">salts</a> were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as <a href="antiepileptic">antiepileptic</a>s.

Bromine was discovered independently by two chemists, <a href="Carl%20Jacob%20L%C3%B6wig">Carl Jacob Löwig</a> and <a href="Antoine%20Jerome%20Balard">Antoine Balard</a>, in 1825 and 1826, respectively.

Löwig isolated bromine from a mineral water spring from his hometown <a href="Bad%20Kreuznach">Bad Kreuznach</a> in 1825. Löwig used a solution of the mineral salt saturated with chlorine and extracted the bromine with <a href="diethyl%20ether">diethyl ether</a>. After evaporation of the ether a brown liquid remained. With this liquid as a sample of his work he applied for a position in the laboratory of <a href="Leopold%20Gmelin">Leopold Gmelin</a> in <a href="Heidelberg">Heidelberg</a>. The publication of the results was delayed and Balard published his results first.

Balard found bromine chemicals in the ash of <a href="seaweed">seaweed</a> from the <a href="salt%20marsh">salt marsh</a>es of <a href="Montpellier">Montpellier</a>. The seaweed was used to produce iodine, but also contained bromine. Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine; thus he tried to prove that the substance was <a href="iodine%20monochloride">iodine monochloride</a> (ICl), but after failing to do so he was sure that he had found a new element, and named it muride, derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "muria" for brine.

After the French chemists <a href="Louis%20Nicolas%20Vauquelin">Louis Nicolas Vauquelin</a>, <a href="Louis%20Jacques%20Th%C3%A9nard">Louis Jacques Thénard</a>, and <a href="Joseph-Louis%20Gay-Lussac">Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac</a> approved the experiments of the young pharmacist Balard, the results were presented at a lecture of the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20des%20Sciences">Académie des Sciences</a> and published in "Annales de Chimie et Physique". In his publication, Balard states that he changed the name from "muride" to "brôme" on the proposal of M. Anglada. "Brôme" (bromine) derives from the Greek βρωμος (stench). Other sources claim that the French chemist and physicist <a href="Joseph-Louis%20Gay-Lussac">Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac</a> suggested the name "brôme" for the characteristic smell of the vapors. Bromine was not produced in large quantities until 1858, when the discovery of salt deposits in <a href="Stassfurt">Stassfurt</a> enabled its production as a by-product of potash.
Apart from some minor medical applications, the first commercial use was the <a href="daguerreotype">daguerreotype</a>. In 1840, bromine was discovered to have some advantages over the previously used iodine vapor to create the light sensitive <a href="silver%20halide">silver halide</a> layer in daguerreotypy.

<a href="Potassium%20bromide">Potassium bromide</a> and <a href="sodium%20bromide">sodium bromide</a> were used as <a href="anticonvulsant">anticonvulsant</a>s and <a href="sedative">sedative</a>s in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but were gradually superseded by <a href="chloral%20hydrate">chloral hydrate</a> and then by the <a href="barbiturate">barbiturate</a>s. In the early years of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, bromine compounds such as <a href="xylyl%20bromide">xylyl bromide</a> were used as <a href="poison%20gas">poison gas</a>.

Bromine is the third <a href="halogen">halogen</a>, being a <a href="nonmetal">nonmetal</a> in group 17 of the periodic table. Its properties are thus similar to those of <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a>, <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>, and <a href="iodine">iodine</a>, and tend to be intermediate between those of the two neighbouring halogens, chlorine and iodine. Bromine has the electron configuration [Ar]3d4s4p, with the seven electrons in the fourth and outermost shell acting as its <a href="valence%20electron">valence electron</a>s. Like all halogens, it is thus one electron short of a full octet, and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell. Corresponding to <a href="periodic%20trend">periodic trend</a>s, it is intermediate in <a href="electronegativity">electronegativity</a> between chlorine and iodine (F: 3.98, Cl: 3.16, Br: 2.96, I: 2.66), and is less reactive than chlorine and more reactive than iodine. It is also a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine, but a stronger one than iodine. Conversely, the <a href="bromide">bromide</a> ion is a weaker reducing agent than iodide, but a stronger one than chloride. These similarities led to chlorine, bromine, and iodine together being classified as one of the original triads of <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20D%C3%B6bereiner">Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner</a>, whose work foreshadowed the <a href="periodic%20law">periodic law</a> for chemical elements. It is intermediate in <a href="atomic%20radius">atomic radius</a> between chlorine and iodine, and this leads to many of its atomic properties being similarly intermediate in value between chlorine and iodine, such as first <a href="ionisation%20energy">ionisation energy</a>, <a href="electron%20affinity">electron affinity</a>, enthalpy of dissociation of the X molecule (X = Cl, Br, I), ionic radius, and X–X bond length. The volatility of bromine accentuates its very penetrating, choking, and unpleasant odour.

All four stable halogens experience intermolecular <a href="van%20der%20Waals%20force">van der Waals force</a>s of attraction, and their strength increases together with number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules. Thus, the melting and boiling points of bromine are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. As a result of the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group, the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of bromine are again intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine, although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low (leading to high volatility) thanks to their diatomic molecular structure. The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: fluorine is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid that melts at −7.2 °C and boils at 58.8 °C. (Iodine is a shiny black solid.) This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group. Specifically, the colour of a halogen, such as bromine, results from the <a href="atomic%20electron%20transition">electron transition</a> between the <a href="HOMO/LUMO">highest occupied</a> antibonding "π" molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding "σ" molecular orbital. The colour fades at low temperatures, so that solid bromine at −195 °C is pale yellow.

Like solid chlorine and iodine, solid bromine crystallises in the <a href="orthorhombic%20crystal%20system">orthorhombic crystal system</a>, in a layered lattice of Br molecules. The Br–Br distance is 227 pm (close to the gaseous Br–Br distance of 228 pm) and the Br···Br distance between molecules is 331 pm within a layer and 399 pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of bromine, 195 pm). This structure means that bromine is a very poor conductor of electricity, with a conductivity of around 5 × 10 Ω cm just below the melting point, although this is better than the essentially undetectable conductivity of chlorine.

At a pressure of 55 <a href="GPa">GPa</a> (roughly 540,000 times atmospheric pressure) bromine undergoes an insulator-to-metal transition. At 75 GPa it changes to a face-centered orthorhombic structure. At 100 GPa it changes to a body centered orthorhombic monatomic form.

Bromine has two stable isotopes, Br and Br. These are its only two natural isotopes, with Br making up 51% of natural bromine and Br making up the remaining 49%. Both have nuclear spin 3/2− and thus may be used for <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance">nuclear magnetic resonance</a>, although Br is more favourable. The other bromine isotopes are all radioactive, with <a href="half-life">half-lives</a> too short to occur in nature. Of these, the most important are Br ("t" = 17.7 min), Br ("t" = 4.421 h), and Br ("t" = 35.28 h), which may be produced from the <a href="neutron%20activation">neutron activation</a> of natural bromine. The most stable bromine radioisotope is Br ("t" = 57.04 h). The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than Br is <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a> to isotopes of <a href="selenium">selenium</a>; that of isotopes heavier than Br is <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> to isotopes of <a href="krypton">krypton</a>; and Br may decay by either mode to stable Se or Kr.

Bromine is intermediate in reactivity between chlorine and iodine, and is one of the most reactive elements. Bond energies to bromine tend to be lower than those to chlorine but higher than those to iodine, and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine. This can be seen from the <a href="standard%20electrode%20potential">standard electrode potential</a>s of the X/X couples (F, +2.866 V; Cl, +1.395 V; Br, +1.087 V; I, +0.615 V; At, approximately +0.3 V). Bromination often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination. Bromine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Br bonds.

The simplest compound of bromine is <a href="hydrogen%20bromide">hydrogen bromide</a>, HBr. It is mainly used in the production of inorganic <a href="bromide">bromide</a>s and <a href="alkyl%20bromide">alkyl bromide</a>s, and as a catalyst for many reactions in organic chemistry. Industrially, it is mainly produced by the reaction of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> gas with bromine gas at 200–400 °C with a <a href="platinum">platinum</a> catalyst. However, reduction of bromine with <a href="red%20phosphorus">red phosphorus</a> is a more practical way to produce hydrogen bromide in the laboratory:

At room temperature, hydrogen bromide is a colourless gas, like all the hydrogen halides apart from <a href="hydrogen%20fluoride">hydrogen fluoride</a>, since hydrogen cannot form strong <a href="hydrogen%20bond">hydrogen bond</a>s to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline hydrogen bromide at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as <a href="hydrobromic%20acid">hydrobromic acid</a>, which is a strong acid (p"K" = −9) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/HO system also involves many hydrates HBr·"n"HO for "n" = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and <a href="hydronium">hydronium</a> cations. Hydrobromic acid forms an <a href="azeotrope">azeotrope</a> with boiling point 124.3 °C at 47.63 g HBr per 100 g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.

Unlike hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous liquid hydrogen bromide is difficult to work with as a solvent, because its boiling point is low, it has a small liquid range, its <a href="dielectric%20constant">dielectric constant</a> is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into HBr and ions – the latter, in any case, are much less stable than the <a href="bifluoride">bifluoride</a> ions () due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and bromine, though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as <a href="caesium">Cs</a> and <a href="quaternary%20ammonium%20cation"></a> (R = <a href="methyl%20group">Me</a>, <a href="ethyl%20group">Et</a>, <a href="butyl%20group">Bu</a>) may still be isolated. Anhydrous hydrogen bromide is a poor solvent, only able to dissolve small molecular compounds such as <a href="nitrosyl%20chloride">nitrosyl chloride</a> and <a href="phenol">phenol</a>, or salts with very low <a href="lattice%20energy">lattice energies</a> such as tetraalkylammonium halides.

Nearly all elements in the periodic table form binary bromides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a>es, with the exception of <a href="xenon">xenon</a> in the very unstable XeBr); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a>); and having an electronegativity higher than bromine's (<a href="oxygen">oxygen</a>, <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a>, and <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>), so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not bromides but rather oxides, fluorides, or chlorides of bromine.

Bromination of metals with Br tends to yield lower oxidation states than chlorination with Cl when a variety of oxidation states is available. Bromides can be made by reaction of an element or its oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate with hydrobromic acid, and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen bromide gas. These methods work best when the bromide product is stable to hydrolysis; otherwise, the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative bromination of the element with bromine or hydrogen bromide, high-temperature bromination of a metal oxide or other halide by bromine, a volatile metal bromide, <a href="carbon%20tetrabromide">carbon tetrabromide</a>, or an organic bromide. For example, <a href="niobium%28V%29%20oxide">niobium(V) oxide</a> reacts with carbon tetrabromide at 370 °C to form <a href="niobium%28V%29%20bromide">niobium(V) bromide</a>. Another method is halogen exchange in the presence of excess "halogenating reagent", for example:
When a lower bromide is wanted, either a higher halide may be reduced using hydrogen or a metal as a reducing agent, or thermal decomposition or disproportionation may be used, as follows:

Most of the bromides of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, along with the <a href="lanthanide">lanthanide</a>s and <a href="actinide">actinide</a>s in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular bromides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. <a href="Silver%20bromide">Silver bromide</a> is very insoluble in water and is thus often used as a qualitative test for bromine.

The halogens form many binary, <a href="diamagnetic">diamagnetic</a> <a href="interhalogen">interhalogen</a> compounds with stoichiometries XY, XY, XY, and XY (where X is heavier than Y), and bromine is no exception. Bromine forms a monofluoride and monochloride, as well as a trifluoride and pentafluoride. Some cationic and anionic derivatives are also characterised, such as , , , , and . Apart from these, some <a href="pseudohalogen">pseudohalides</a> are also known, such as <a href="cyanogen%20bromide">cyanogen bromide</a> (BrCN), bromine <a href="thiocyanate">thiocyanate</a> (BrSCN), and bromine <a href="azide">azide</a> (BrN).

The pale-brown <a href="bromine%20monofluoride">bromine monofluoride</a> (BrF) is unstable at room temperature, disproportionating quickly and irreversibly into bromine, bromine trifluoride, and bromine pentafluoride. It thus cannot be obtained pure. It may be synthesised by the direct reaction of the elements, or by the comproportionation of bromine and bromine trifluoride at high temperatures. <a href="Bromine%20monochloride">Bromine monochloride</a> (BrCl), a red-brown gas, quite readily dissociates reversibly into bromine and chlorine at room temperature and thus also cannot be obtained pure, though it can be made by the reversible direct reaction of its elements in the gas phase or in <a href="carbon%20tetrachloride">carbon tetrachloride</a>. Bromine monofluoride in <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a> readily leads to the monobromination of the <a href="aromaticity">aromatic</a> compounds PhX ("para"-bromination occurs for X = Me, Bu, OMe, Br; "meta"-bromination occurs for the deactivating X = –COEt, –CHO, –NO); this is due to heterolytic fission of the Br–F bond, leading to rapid electrophilic bromination by Br.

At room temperature, <a href="bromine%20trifluoride">bromine trifluoride</a> (BrF) is a straw-coloured liquid. It may be formed by directly fluorinating bromine at room temperature and is purified through distillation. It reacts explosively with water and hydrocarbons, but is a less violent fluorinating reagent than <a href="chlorine%20trifluoride">chlorine trifluoride</a>. It reacts vigorously with <a href="boron">boron</a>, <a href="carbon">carbon</a>, <a href="silicon">silicon</a>, <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>, <a href="antimony">antimony</a>, iodine, and <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> to give fluorides, and also reacts with most metals and their oxides: as such, it is used to oxidise <a href="uranium">uranium</a> to <a href="uranium%20hexafluoride">uranium hexafluoride</a> in the nuclear industry. Refractory oxides tend to be only partially fluorinated, but here the derivatives KBrF and BrFSbF remain reactive. Bromine trifluoride is a useful nonaqueous ionising solvent, since it readily dissociates to form and and thus conducts electricity.

<a href="Bromine%20pentafluoride">Bromine pentafluoride</a> (BrF) was first synthesised in 1930. It is produced on a large scale by direct reaction of bromine with excess fluorine at temperatures higher than 150 °C, and on a small scale by the fluorination of <a href="potassium%20bromide">potassium bromide</a> at 25 °C. It is a very vigorous fluorinating agent, although chlorine trifluoride is still more violent. Bromine pentafluoride explodes on reaction with water and fluorinates silicates at 450 °C.

Although dibromine is a strong oxidising agent with a high first ionisation energy, very strong oxidisers such as <a href="peroxydisulfuryl%20fluoride">peroxydisulfuryl fluoride</a> (SOF) can oxidise it to form the cherry-red cation. A few other bromine cations are known, namely the brown and dark brown . The tribromide anion, , has also been characterised; it is analogous to <a href="triiodide">triiodide</a>.

<a href="Bromine%20oxide">Bromine oxide</a>s are not as well-characterised as <a href="chlorine%20oxide">chlorine oxide</a>s or <a href="iodine%20oxide">iodine oxide</a>s, as they are all fairly unstable: it was once thought that they could not exist at all. <a href="Dibromine%20monoxide">Dibromine monoxide</a> is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60 °C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5 °C; it is useful in <a href="bromination">bromination</a> reactions and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of <a href="bromine%20dioxide">bromine dioxide</a> in a vacuum. It oxidises iodine to <a href="iodine%20pentoxide">iodine pentoxide</a> and <a href="benzene">benzene</a> to <a href="1%2C4-benzoquinone">1,4-benzoquinone</a>; in alkaline solutions, it gives the <a href="hypobromite">hypobromite</a> anion.

So-called "<a href="bromine%20dioxide">bromine dioxide</a>", a pale yellow crystalline solid, may be better formulated as bromine perbromate, BrOBrO. It is thermally unstable above −40 °C, violently decomposing to its elements at 0 °C. <a href="Dibromine%20trioxide">Dibromine trioxide</a>, "syn"-BrOBrO, is also known; it is the anhydride of <a href="hypobromous%20acid">hypobromous acid</a> and <a href="bromic%20acid">bromic acid</a>. It is an orange crystalline solid which decomposes above −40 °C; if heated too rapidly, it explodes around 0 °C. A few other unstable radical oxides are also known, as are some poorly characterised oxides, such as <a href="dibromine%20pentoxide">dibromine pentoxide</a>, tribromine octoxide, and bromine trioxide.

The four oxoacids, <a href="hypobromous%20acid">hypobromous acid</a> (HOBr), <a href="bromous%20acid">bromous acid</a> (HOBrO), <a href="bromic%20acid">bromic acid</a> (HOBrO), and <a href="perbromic%20acid">perbromic acid</a> (HOBrO), are better studied due to their greater stability, though they are only so in aqueous solution. When bromine dissolves in aqueous solution, the following reactions occur:

Hypobromous acid is unstable to disproportionation. The <a href="hypobromite">hypobromite</a> ions thus formed disproportionate readily to give bromide and bromate:

Bromous acids and <a href="bromite">bromite</a>s are very unstable, although the <a href="strontium">strontium</a> and <a href="barium">barium</a> bromites are known. More important are the <a href="bromate">bromate</a>s, which are prepared on a small scale by oxidation of bromide by aqueous <a href="hypochlorite">hypochlorite</a>, and are strong oxidising agents. Unlike chlorates, which very slowly disproportionate to chloride and perclorate, the bromate anion is stable to disproportionation in both acidic and aqueous solutions. Bromic acid is a strong acid. Bromides and bromates may comproportionate to bromine as follows:

There were many failed attempts to obtain perbromates and perbromic acid, leading to some rationalisations as to why they should not exist, until 1968 when the anion was first synthesised from the radioactive <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> of unstable . Today, perbromates are produced by the oxidation of alkaline bromate solutions by fluorine gas. Excess bromate and fluoride are precipitated as <a href="silver%20bromate">silver bromate</a> and <a href="calcium%20fluoride">calcium fluoride</a>, and the perbromic acid solution may be purified. The perbromate ion is fairly inert at room temperature but is thermodynamically extremely oxidising, with extremely strong oxidising agents needed to produce it, such as fluorine or <a href="xenon%20difluoride">xenon difluoride</a>. The Br–O bond in is fairly weak, which corresponds to the general reluctance of the 4p elements (especially <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>, <a href="selenium">selenium</a>, and bromine) to attain their maximum possible oxidation state, as they come after the <a href="scandide%20contraction">scandide contraction</a> characterised by the poor shielding afforded by the radial-nodeless 3d orbitals.

Like the other carbon–halogen bonds, the C–Br bond is a common functional group that forms part of core <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic chemistry</a>. Formally, compounds with this functional group may be considered organic derivatives of the bromide anion. Due to the difference of electronegativity between bromine (2.96) and carbon (2.55), the carbon in a C–Br bond is electron-deficient and thus <a href="electrophilic">electrophilic</a>. The reactivity of organobromine compounds resembles but is intermediate between the reactivity of <a href="organochlorine%20compound">organochlorine</a> and <a href="organoiodine%20compound">organoiodine compound</a>s. For many applications, organobromides represent a compromise of reactivity and cost.

Organobromides are typically produced by additive or substitutive bromination of other organic precursors. Bromine itself can be used, but due to its toxicity and volatility safer brominating reagents are normally used, such as <a href="N-Bromosuccinimide">"N"-bromosuccinimide</a>. The principal reactions for organobromides include <a href="dehydrohalogenation">dehydrobromination</a>, <a href="Grignard%20reaction">Grignard reaction</a>s, <a href="Wurtz%20reaction">reductive coupling</a>, and <a href="nucleophilic%20substitution">nucleophilic substitution</a>.

Organobromides are the most common organohalides in nature, even though the concentration of bromide is only 0.3% of that for chloride in sea water, because of the easy oxidation of bromide to the equivalent of Br, a potent electrophile. The enzyme <a href="bromoperoxidase">bromoperoxidase</a> catalyzes this reaction. The oceans are estimated to release 1–2 million tons of <a href="bromoform">bromoform</a> and 56,000 tons of <a href="bromomethane">bromomethane</a> annually.
An old qualitative test for the presence of the <a href="alkene">alkene</a> functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a <a href="halohydrin">bromohydrin</a> with some of the dibromoalkane also produced. The reaction passes through a short-lived strongly electrophilic <a href="halonium%20ion">bromonium</a> intermediate. This is an example of a <a href="halogen%20addition%20reaction">halogen addition reaction</a>.

Bromine is significantly less abundant in the crust than fluorine or chlorine, comprising only 2.5 <a href="parts%20per%20million">parts per million</a> of the Earth's crustal rocks, and then only as bromide salts. It is the forty-sixth most abundant element in Earth's crust. It is significantly more abundant in the oceans, resulting from long-term <a href="Leaching%20%28chemical%20science%29">leaching</a>. There, it makes up 65 parts per million, corresponding to a ratio of about one bromine atom for every 660 chlorine atoms. Salt lakes and brine wells may have higher bromine concentrations: for example, the <a href="Dead%20Sea">Dead Sea</a> contains 0.4% bromide ions. It is from these sources that bromine extraction is mostly economically feasible.

The main sources of bromine are in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and <a href="Israel">Israel</a>. The element is liberated by halogen exchange, using chlorine gas to oxidise Br to Br. This is then removed with a blast of steam or air, and is then condensed and purified. Today, bromine is transported in large-capacity metal drums or lead-lined tanks that can hold hundreds of kilograms or even tonnes of bromine. The bromine industry is about one-hundredth the size of the chlorine industry. Laboratory production is unnecessary because bromine is commercially available and has a long shelf life.

A wide variety of organobromine compounds are used in <a href="industry">industry</a>. Some are prepared from bromine and others are prepared from <a href="hydrogen%20bromide">hydrogen bromide</a>, which is obtained by burning <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> in bromine.

<a href="Brominated%20flame%20retardant">Brominated flame retardant</a>s represent a commodity of growing importance, and make up the largest commercial use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces <a href="hydrobromic%20acid">hydrobromic acid</a> which interferes in the radical <a href="chain%20reaction">chain reaction</a> of the <a href="oxidation">oxidation</a> reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion.

To make brominated polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can be incorporated into the polymer during <a href="polymerisation">polymerisation</a>. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, <a href="vinyl%20bromide">vinyl bromide</a> can be used in the production of <a href="polyethylene">polyethylene</a>, <a href="polyvinylchloride">polyvinylchloride</a> or <a href="polypropylene">polypropylene</a>. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, <a href="tetrabromobisphenol%20A">tetrabromobisphenol A</a> can be added to <a href="polyester">polyester</a>s or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in <a href="printed%20circuit%20board">printed circuit board</a>s are normally made from such flame retardant <a href="resin">resin</a>s, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (<a href="FR-4">FR-4</a> and <a href="FR-2">FR-2</a>). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, <a href="decabromodiphenyl%20ether">decabromodiphenyl ether</a> can be added to the final polymers.

A number of gaseous or highly volatile brominated <a href="halomethane">halomethane</a> compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism, and are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they are expensive and their production and use has been greatly curtailed due to their effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include <a href="bromochloromethane">bromochloromethane</a> (Halon 1011, CHBrCl), <a href="bromochlorodifluoromethane">bromochlorodifluoromethane</a> (Halon 1211, CBrClF), and <a href="bromotrifluoromethane">bromotrifluoromethane</a> (Halon 1301, CBrF).

<a href="1%2C2-Dibromoethane">Ethylene bromide</a> was an <a href="Gasoline%20additive">additive in gasolines</a> containing lead anti-<a href="engine%20knocking">engine knocking</a> agents. It scavenges lead by forming volatile lead bromide, which is exhausted from the engine. This application accounted for 77% of the bromine use in 1966 in the US. This application has declined since the 1970s due to environmental regulations (see below).

Poisonous <a href="bromomethane">bromomethane</a> was widely used as <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a> to <a href="Fumigation">fumigate</a> soil and to fumigate housing, by the tenting method. Ethylene bromide was similarly used. These volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as <a href="ozone%20depletion">ozone depletion</a> agents. The <a href="Montreal%20Protocol">Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer</a> scheduled the phase out for the <a href="ozone%20depleting">ozone depleting</a> chemical by 2005, and organobromide pesticides are no longer used (in housing fumigation they have been replaced by such compounds as <a href="sulfuryl%20fluoride">sulfuryl fluoride</a>, which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm ozone). Before the Montreal protocol in 1991 (for example) an estimated 35,000 tonnes of the chemical were used to control <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s, <a href="fungi">fungi</a>, <a href="weed">weed</a>s and other soil-borne diseases.

<a href="Bromide">Bromide</a> compounds, especially <a href="potassium%20bromide">potassium bromide</a>, were frequently used as general sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. Bromides in the form of simple salts are still used as anticonvulsants in both veterinary and human medicine, although the latter use varies from country to country. For example, the U.S. <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) does not approve bromide for the treatment of any disease, and it was removed from over-the-counter sedative products like <a href="Bromo-Seltzer">Bromo-Seltzer</a>, in 1975.

Other uses of organobromine compounds include high-density drilling fluids, dyes (such as <a href="Tyrian%20purple">Tyrian purple</a> and the indicator <a href="bromothymol%20blue">bromothymol blue</a>), and pharmaceuticals. Bromine itself, as well as some of its compounds, are used in water treatment, and is the precursor of a variety of inorganic compounds with an enormous number of applications (e.g. <a href="silver%20bromide">silver bromide</a> for photography).

Unlike its neighbours in the halogen column (chlorine and iodine), bromine is not known to have a confirmed biological role in humans. A single 2014 study suggests that it may be a necessary catalyst to make <a href="collagen%20IV">collagen IV</a>, making it essential to <a href="basement%20membrane">basement membrane</a> architecture and tissue development, but these findings have not been confirmed and the precise role posited for bromine is not certain. Aside from this, only circumstantial evidence in the form of hypothesised deprivation symptoms exists for a trace role for bromine. Nevertheless, even if bromine is not an essential element, it can be pharmacologically beneficial. For example, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, <a href="H2O2">HO</a>, formed by the <a href="eosinophil">eosinophil</a>, and either chloride or bromide ions, eosinophil peroxidase provides a potent mechanism by which eosinophils kill multicellular <a href="parasitism">parasites</a> (such as, for example, the nematode worms involved in <a href="filariasis">filariasis</a>) and some <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> (such as <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> bacteria). Eosinophil peroxidase is a <a href="haloperoxidase">haloperoxidase</a> that preferentially uses bromide over chloride for this purpose, generating <a href="hypobromite">hypobromite</a> (<a href="hypobromous%20acid">hypobromous acid</a>), although the use of chloride is possible.

Marine organisms are the main source of organobromine compounds, and it is in these organisms that the essentiality of bromine is on much firmer ground. More than 1600 such organobromine compounds were identified by 1999. The most abundant is <a href="methyl%20bromide">methyl bromide</a> (CHBr), of which an estimated 56,000 tonnes is produced by marine algae each year. The essential oil of the Hawaiian alga "<a href="Asparagopsis%20taxiformis">Asparagopsis taxiformis</a>" consists of 80% <a href="bromoform">bromoform</a>. Most of such organobromine compounds in the sea are made by the action of a unique algal enzyme, <a href="vanadium%20bromoperoxidase">vanadium bromoperoxidase</a>.

The bromide anion is not very toxic: a normal daily intake is 2 to 8 milligrams. However, high levels of bromide chronically impair the membrane of neurons, which progressively impairs neuronal transmission, leading to toxicity, known as <a href="bromism">bromism</a>. Bromide has an <a href="elimination%20half-life">elimination half-life</a> of 9 to 12 days, which can lead to excessive accumulation. Doses of 0.5 to 1 gram per day of bromide can lead to bromism. Historically, the therapeutic dose of bromide is about 3 to 5 grams of bromide, thus explaining why chronic toxicity (bromism) was once so common. While significant and sometimes serious disturbances occur to neurologic, psychiatric, dermatological, and gastrointestinal functions, death from bromism is rare. Bromism is caused by a neurotoxic effect on the brain which results in <a href="somnolence">somnolence</a>, <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a>, <a href="seizures">seizures</a> and <a href="delirium">delirium</a>.

Elemental bromine is toxic and causes <a href="chemical%20burns">chemical burns</a> on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure may lead to frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames. The <a href="Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA) of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> has set a <a href="permissible%20exposure%20limit">permissible exposure limit</a> (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1 ppm. The <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a> (NIOSH) has set a <a href="recommended%20exposure%20limit">recommended exposure limit</a> (REL) of TWA 0.1 ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3 ppm. The exposure to bromine <a href="immediately%20dangerous%20to%20life%20and%20health">immediately dangerous to life and health</a> (IDLH) is 3 ppm. Bromine is classified as an <a href="List%20of%20extremely%20hazardous%20substances">extremely hazardous substance</a> in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. <a href="Emergency%20Planning%20and%20Community%20Right-to-Know%20Act">Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act</a> (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

Barium

Barium is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Ba and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 56. It is the fifth element in group 2 and is a soft, silvery <a href="alkaline%20earth%20metal">alkaline earth metal</a>. Because of its high chemical <a href="Reactivity%20%28chemistry%29">reactivity</a>, barium is never found in nature as a free element. Its hydroxide, known in pre-modern history as <a href="Barium%20hydroxide">baryta</a>, does not occur as a <a href="mineral">mineral</a>, but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate.

The most common naturally occurring minerals of barium are <a href="Baryte">barite</a> (<a href="barium%20sulfate">barium sulfate</a>, BaSO) and <a href="witherite">witherite</a> (<a href="barium%20carbonate">barium carbonate</a>, BaCO), both insoluble in water. The barium name originates from the alchemical derivative "baryta", from <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> βαρύς ("barys"), meaning "heavy." "Baric" is the adjectival form of barium. Barium was identified as a new element in 1774, but not reduced to a metal until 1808 with the advent of <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a>.

Barium has few industrial applications. Historically, it was used as a <a href="getter">getter</a> for <a href="vacuum%20tube">vacuum tube</a>s. It is a component of <a href="Yttrium%20barium%20copper%20oxide">YBCO</a> (<a href="High-temperature%20superconductivity">high-temperature superconductors</a>) and electroceramics, and is added to steel and cast iron to reduce the size of carbon grains within the microstructure. Barium compounds are added to fireworks to impart a green color. <a href="Barium%20sulfate">Barium sulfate</a> is used as an insoluble additive to <a href="oil%20well">oil well</a> <a href="drilling%20fluid">drilling fluid</a>, as well as in a purer form, as X-ray <a href="radiocontrast%20agent">radiocontrast agent</a>s for imaging the human gastrointestinal tract. The soluble barium <a href="ion">ion</a> and soluble compounds are poisonous, and have been used as <a href="rodenticide">rodenticide</a>s.

Barium is a soft, silvery-white metal, with a slight golden shade when ultrapure. The silvery-white color of barium metal rapidly vanishes upon <a href="redox">oxidation</a> in air yielding a dark gray <a href="Barium%20oxide">oxide</a> layer. Barium has a medium <a href="specific%20weight">specific weight</a> and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure barium is very difficult to prepare, and therefore many properties of barium have not been accurately measured yet.

At room temperature and pressure, barium has a <a href="body-centered%20cubic">body-centered cubic</a> structure, with a barium–barium distance of 503 <a href="picometer">picometer</a>s, expanding with heating at a rate of approximately 1.8/°C. It is a very soft metal with a <a href="Mohs%20hardness">Mohs hardness</a> of 1.25. Its melting temperature of is intermediate between those of the lighter strontium () and heavier radium (); however, its boiling point of exceeds that of strontium (). The density (3.62 g·cm) is again intermediate between those of strontium (2.36 g·cm) and radium (~5 g·cm).

Barium is chemically similar to magnesium, calcium, and strontium, but even more reactive. It always exhibits the oxidation state of +2, except in a few rare and unstable molecular species that are only characterised in the gas phase such as BaF. Reactions with <a href="chalcogen">chalcogen</a>s are highly <a href="exothermic%20reaction">exothermic</a> (release energy); the reaction with oxygen or air occurs at room temperature, and therefore barium is stored under oil or in an inert atmosphere. Reactions with other <a href="nonmetal">nonmetal</a>s, such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicon, and hydrogen, are generally exothermic and proceed upon heating. Reactions with water and alcohols are very exothermic and release hydrogen gas:

Barium reacts with <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> to form complexes such as Ba(NH).

The metal is readily attacked by most acids. <a href="Sulfuric%20acid">Sulfuric acid</a> is a notable exception because <a href="Passivation%20%28chemistry%29">passivation</a> stops the reaction by forming the insoluble <a href="barium%20sulfate">barium sulfate</a> on the surface. Barium combines with several metals, including <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, <a href="zinc">zinc</a>, <a href="lead">lead</a>, and <a href="tin">tin</a>, forming <a href="intermetallics">intermetallic phases</a> and alloys.

Barium salts are typically white when solid and colorless when dissolved, and barium ions provide no specific coloring. They are denser than the <a href="strontium">strontium</a> or <a href="calcium">calcium</a> analogs, except for the <a href="halide">halide</a>s (see table; <a href="zinc">zinc</a> is given for comparison).

<a href="Barium%20hydroxide">Barium hydroxide</a> ("baryta") was known to alchemists, who produced it by heating barium carbonate. Unlike calcium hydroxide, it absorbs very little CO in aqueous solutions and is therefore insensitive to atmospheric fluctuations. This property is used in calibrating pH equipment.

Volatile barium compounds burn with a green to pale green <a href="flame%20test">flame</a>, which is an efficient test to detect a barium compound. The color results from <a href="spectral%20line">spectral line</a>s at 455.4, 493.4, 553.6, and 611.1 nm. 

<a href="Group%202%20organometallic%20chemistry%23Organobarium">Organobarium compounds</a> are a growing field of knowledge: recently discovered are dialkylbariums and alkylhalobariums.

Barium found in the Earth's crust is a mixture of seven primordial nuclides, barium-130, 132, and 134 through 138. Barium-130 undergoes very slow <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive decay</a> to <a href="xenon">xenon</a>-130 by double <a href="Beta%20decay">beta plus decay</a>, and barium-132 theoretically decays similarly to xenon-132, with half-lives a thousand times greater than the <a href="age%20of%20the%20Universe">age of the Universe</a>. The abundance is ~0.1% that of natural barium. The radioactivity of these isotopes is so weak that they pose no danger to life. 

Of the stable isotopes, barium-138 composes 71.7% of all barium, and the lighter the isotope, the less abundant. 

In total, barium has about 50 known isotopes, ranging in mass between 114 and 153. The most stable metastable isotope is barium-133 with a half-life of approximately 10.51 years. Five other isotopes have half-lives longer than a day. Barium also has 10 <a href="meta%20state">meta state</a>s, out of which barium-133m1 is the most stable with a half-life of about 39 hours.

Alchemists in the early Middle Ages knew about some barium minerals. Smooth pebble-like stones of mineral barite were found in volcanic rock near <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, and so were called "Bologna stones." Alchemists were attracted to them because after exposure to light they would glow for years. The phosphorescent properties of barite heated with organics were described by V. Casciorolus in 1602.

<a href="Carl%20Scheele">Carl Scheele</a> determined that barite contained a new element in 1774, but could not isolate barium, only <a href="barium%20oxide">barium oxide</a>. <a href="Johan%20Gottlieb%20Gahn">Johan Gottlieb Gahn</a> also isolated <a href="barium%20oxide">barium oxide</a> two years later in similar studies. Oxidized barium was at first called "barote" by <a href="Guyton%20de%20Morveau">Guyton de Morveau</a>, a name that was changed by <a href="Antoine%20Lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</a> to "baryta." Also in the 18th century, English mineralogist <a href="William%20Withering">William Withering</a> noted a heavy mineral in the lead mines of <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a>, now known to be <a href="witherite">witherite</a>. Barium was first isolated by electrolysis of molten barium salts in 1808 by Sir <a href="Humphry%20Davy">Humphry Davy</a> in <a href="England">England</a>. Davy, by analogy with <a href="calcium">calcium</a>, named "barium" after baryta, with the "-ium" ending signifying a metallic element. <a href="Robert%20Bunsen">Robert Bunsen</a> and <a href="Augustus%20Matthiessen">Augustus Matthiessen</a> obtained pure barium by electrolysis of a molten mixture of <a href="barium%20chloride">barium chloride</a> and <a href="ammonium%20chloride">ammonium chloride</a>.

The production of pure oxygen in the <a href="Brin%20process">Brin process</a> was a large-scale application of barium peroxide in the 1880s, before it was replaced by electrolysis and <a href="fractional%20distillation">fractional distillation</a> of liquefied air in the early 1900s. In this process barium oxide reacts at with air to form barium peroxide, which decomposes above by releasing oxygen:

Barium sulfate was first applied as a <a href="radiocontrast">radiocontrast</a> agent in <a href="medical%20imaging">X-ray imaging</a> of the digestive system in 1908.

The abundance of barium is 0.0425% in the Earth's crust and 13 µg/L in sea water. The primary commercial source of barium is barite (also called barytes or heavy spar), a barium sulfate mineral. with deposits in many parts of the world. Another commercial source, far less important than barite, is witherite, a barium carbonate mineral. The main deposits are located in England, Romania, and the former USSR.
The barite reserves are estimated between 0.7 and 2 billion <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s. The maximum production, 8.3 million tonnes, was produced in 1981, but only 7–8% was used for barium metal or compounds. Barite production has risen since the second half of the 1990s from 5.6 million tonnes in 1996 to 7.6 in 2005 and 7.8 in 2011. China accounts for more than 50% of this output, followed by India (14% in 2011), Morocco (8.3%), US (8.2%), Turkey (2.5%), Iran and Kazakhstan (2.6% each).

The mined ore is washed, crushed, classified, and separated from quartz. If the quartz penetrates too deeply into the ore, or the iron, zinc, or lead content is abnormally high, then <a href="froth%20flotation">froth flotation</a> is used. The product is a 98% pure barite (by mass); the purity should be no less than 95%, with a minimal content of iron and <a href="silicon%20dioxide">silicon dioxide</a>. It is then reduced by carbon to barium sulfide:

The water-soluble barium sulfide is the starting point for other compounds: reacting BaS with oxygen produces the sulfate, with nitric acid the nitrate, with carbon dioxide the carbonate, and so on. The nitrate can be thermally decomposed to yield the oxide. Barium metal is produced by reduction with <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a> at . The <a href="intermetallic%20compound">intermetallic compound</a> BaAl is produced first:

BaAl is an intermediate reacted with barium oxide to produce the metal. Note that not all barium is reduced.

The remaining barium oxide reacts with the formed aluminium oxide:

and the overall reaction is

Barium vapor is condensed and packed into molds in an atmosphere of argon. This method is used commercially, yielding ultrapure barium. Commonly sold barium is about 99% pure, with main impurities being strontium and calcium (up to 0.8% and 0.25%) and other contaminants contributing less than 0.1%.

A similar reaction with silicon at yields barium and <a href="barium%20metasilicate">barium metasilicate</a>. Electrolysis is not used because barium readily dissolves in molten halides and the product is rather impure.
The barium mineral, <a href="benitoite">benitoite</a> (barium titanium silicate), occurs as a very rare blue fluorescent gemstone, and is the official state gem of <a href="California">California</a>.

Barium, as a metal or when alloyed with aluminium, is used to remove unwanted gases (<a href="getter">getter</a>ing) from vacuum tubes, such as TV picture tubes. Barium is suitable for this purpose because of its low <a href="vapor%20pressure">vapor pressure</a> and reactivity towards oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water; it can even partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice. This application is gradually disappearing due to the rising popularity of the tubeless LCD and plasma sets.

Other uses of elemental barium are minor and include an additive to <a href="silumin">silumin</a> (aluminium–silicon alloys) that refines their structure, as well as

<a href="Barium%20sulfate">Barium sulfate</a> (the mineral barite, BaSO) is important to the petroleum industry as a <a href="drilling%20fluid">drilling fluid</a> in <a href="oil%20well">oil and gas wells</a>. The precipitate of the compound (called "blanc fixe", from the French for "permanent white") is used in paints and varnishes; as a filler in ringing ink, plastics, and rubbers; as a paper coating pigment; and in <a href="nanoparticle">nanoparticle</a>s, to improve physical properties of some polymers, such as epoxies.

Barium sulfate has a low toxicity and relatively high density of ca. 4.5 g·cm (and thus opacity to X-rays). For this reason it is used as a <a href="radiocontrast">radiocontrast</a> agent in <a href="medical%20imaging">X-ray imaging</a> of the digestive system ("<a href="barium%20meal">barium meal</a>s" and "<a href="Lower%20gastrointestinal%20series">barium enemas</a>"). <a href="Lithopone">Lithopone</a>, a <a href="pigment">pigment</a> that contains barium sulfate and <a href="zinc%20sulfide">zinc sulfide</a>, is a permanent white with good covering power that does not darken when exposed to sulfides.

Other compounds of barium find only niche applications, limited by the toxicity of Ba ions (barium carbonate is a <a href="rat%20poison">rat poison</a>), which is not a problem for the insoluble BaSO.
Because of the high reactivity of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a>, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, <a href="anxiety%20%28mood%29">anxiety</a>, <a href="dyspnea">shortness of breath</a>, and <a href="paralysis">paralysis</a>. This toxicity may be caused by Ba blocking <a href="potassium%20ion%20channels">potassium ion channels</a>, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.

Barium is not carcinogenic and it does not <a href="bioaccumulation">bioaccumulate</a>. Inhaled dust containing insoluble barium compounds can accumulate in the lungs, causing a <a href="benign">benign</a> condition called <a href="baritosis">baritosis</a>. The insoluble sulfate is nontoxic and is not classified as a dangerous goods in transport regulations.

To avoid a potentially vigorous chemical reaction, barium metal is kept in an argon atmosphere or under mineral oils. Contact with air is dangerous and may cause ignition. Moisture, friction, heat, sparks, flames, shocks, static electricity, and exposure to oxidizers and acids should be avoided. Anything that may contact with barium should be electrically grounded. Anyone who works with the metal should wear pre-cleaned non-sparking shoes, flame-resistant rubber clothes, rubber gloves, apron, goggles, and a gas mask. Smoking in the working area is forbidden. Thorough washing is required after handling barium.

Berkelium

Berkelium is a <a href="transuranic%20element">transuranic</a> <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive</a> <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Bk and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 97. It is a member of the <a href="actinide">actinide</a> and <a href="transuranium%20element">transuranium element</a> series. It is named after the city of <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley, California</a>, the location of the <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory) where it was discovered in December 1949. Berkelium was the fifth transuranium element discovered after <a href="neptunium">neptunium</a>, <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>, <a href="curium">curium</a> and <a href="americium">americium</a>.

The major <a href="isotope">isotope</a> of berkelium, Bk, is synthesized in minute quantities in dedicated high-flux <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s, mainly at the <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20National%20Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, USA, and at the <a href="Research%20Institute%20of%20Atomic%20Reactors">Research Institute of Atomic Reactors</a> in <a href="Dimitrovgrad%2C%20Russia">Dimitrovgrad, Russia</a>. The production of the second-most important isotope Bk involves the irradiation of the rare isotope <a href="curium-244">Cm</a> with high-energy <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s.

Just over one gram of berkelium has been produced in the United States since 1967. There is no practical application of berkelium outside of scientific research which is mostly directed at the synthesis of heavier <a href="transuranic%20elements">transuranic elements</a> and <a href="transactinide">transactinide</a>s. A 22 milligram batch of berkelium-249 was prepared during a 250-day irradiation period and then purified for a further 90 days at Oak Ridge in 2009. This sample was used to synthesize the new element <a href="tennessine">tennessine</a> for the first time in 2009 at the <a href="Joint%20Institute%20for%20Nuclear%20Research">Joint Institute for Nuclear Research</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, after it was bombarded with <a href="calcium-48">calcium-48</a> ions for 150 days. This was the culmination of the Russia–US collaboration on the synthesis of the heaviest elements on the periodic table.

Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, <a href="Radioactivity">radioactive</a> metal. The berkelium-249 isotope emits low-energy <a href="electron">electron</a>s and thus is relatively safe to handle. It decays with a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 330 days to <a href="californium">californium</a>-249, which is a strong emitter of ionizing alpha particles. This gradual transformation is an important consideration when studying the properties of elemental berkelium and its chemical compounds, since the formation of californium brings not only chemical contamination, but also free-radical effects and self-heating from the emitted alpha particles.

Berkelium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive <a href="actinide">actinide</a> metal. In the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>, it is located to the right of the actinide <a href="curium">curium</a>, to the left of the actinide <a href="californium">californium</a> and below the lanthanide <a href="terbium">terbium</a> with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 14.78 g/cm lies between those of curium (13.52 g/cm) and californium (15.1 g/cm), as does its melting point of 986 °C, below that of curium (1340 °C) but higher than that of californium (900 °C). Berkelium is relatively soft and has one of the lowest <a href="bulk%20modulus">bulk moduli</a> among the actinides, at about 20 <a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">GPa</a> (2 Pa).

Berkelium(III) ions shows two sharp <a href="fluorescence">fluorescence</a> peaks at 652 <a href="nanometer">nanometer</a>s (red light) and 742 nanometers (deep red – near infrared) due to internal transitions at the <a href="Electron%20configuration">f-electron shell</a>. The relative intensity of these peaks depends on the excitation power and temperature of the sample. This emission can be observed, for example, after dispersing berkelium ions in a silicate glass, by melting the glass in presence of berkelium oxide or halide.

Between 70 K and room temperature, berkelium behaves as a <a href="Curie%E2%80%93Weiss%20law">Curie–Weiss</a> paramagnetic material with an effective magnetic moment of 9.69 <a href="Bohr%20magneton">Bohr magneton</a>s (µ) and a <a href="Curie%20temperature">Curie temperature</a> of 101 K. This magnetic moment is almost equal to the theoretical value of 9.72 µ calculated within the simple atomic <a href="Angular%20momentum%20coupling">L-S coupling model</a>. Upon cooling to about 34 K, berkelium undergoes a transition to an <a href="antiferromagnetism">antiferromagnetic</a> state. <a href="Enthalpy%20change%20of%20solution">Enthalpy of dissolution</a> in <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a> at standard conditions is −600 kJ/mol, from which the <a href="Standard%20enthalpy%20change%20of%20formation%20%28data%20table%29">standard enthalpy change of formation</a> (Δ"H"°) of aqueous Bk ions is obtained as −601 kJ/mol. The <a href="standard%20potential">standard potential</a> Bk/Bk is −2.01 V. The <a href="Ionization%20energy">ionization potential</a> of a neutral berkelium atom is 6.23 eV.

At ambient conditions, berkelium assumes its most stable α form which has a <a href="Hexagonal%20crystal%20system">hexagonal</a> symmetry, <a href="space%20group">space group</a> "P6/mmc", lattice parameters of 341 <a href="picometer">pm</a> and 1107 pm. The crystal has a double-<a href="Close-packing%20of%20spheres">hexagonal close packing</a> structure with the layer sequence ABAC and so is <a href="isotypic">isotypic</a> (having a similar structure) with α-lanthanum and α-forms of actinides beyond curium. This crystal structure changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 7 GPa, α-berkelium transforms to the beta modification, which has a <a href="Cubic%20crystal%20system">face-centered cubic</a> ("fcc") symmetry and space group "Fmm". This transition occurs without change in volume, but the <a href="enthalpy">enthalpy</a> increases by 3.66 kJ/mol. Upon further compression to 25 GPa, berkelium transforms to an <a href="Orthorhombic%20crystal%20system">orthorhombic</a> γ-berkelium structure similar to that of α-uranium. This transition is accompanied by a 12% volume decrease and delocalization of the electrons at the <a href="electron%20shell">5f electron shell</a>. No further phase transitions are observed up to 57 GPa.

Upon heating, α-berkelium transforms into another phase with an "fcc" lattice (but slightly different from β-berkelium), space group "Fmm" and the lattice constant of 500 pm; this "fcc" structure is equivalent to the closest packing with the sequence ABC. This phase is metastable and will gradually revert to the original α-berkelium phase at <a href="room%20temperature">room temperature</a>. The temperature of the phase transition is believed to be quite close to the melting point.

Like all <a href="actinide">actinide</a>s, berkelium dissolves in various aqueous inorganic acids, liberating gaseous <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and converting into the berkelium(III) state. This <a href="trivalent">trivalent</a> <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> (+3) is the most stable, especially in aqueous solutions, but <a href="tetravalent">tetravalent</a> (+4) and possibly <a href="divalent">divalent</a> (+2) berkelium compounds are also known. The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed <a href="lanthanum%20chloride">lanthanum chloride</a>-<a href="strontium%20chloride">strontium chloride</a> melts. A similar behavior is observed for the lanthanide analogue of berkelium, <a href="terbium">terbium</a>. Aqueous solutions of Bk ions are green in most acids. The color of Bk ions is yellow in <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a> and orange-yellow in <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a>. Berkelium does not react rapidly with <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> at room temperature, possibly due to the formation of a protective oxide layer surface. However, it reacts with molten metals, <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, <a href="halogen">halogen</a>s, <a href="chalcogen">chalcogen</a>s and <a href="pnictogen">pnictogen</a>s to form various binary compounds.

About twenty isotopes and six <a href="nuclear%20isomer">nuclear isomer</a>s (excited states of an isotope) of berkelium have been characterized with the mass numbers ranging from 235 to 254. All of them are radioactive. The longest <a href="half-life">half-lives</a> are observed for Bk (1,380 years), Bk (over 300 years) and Bk (330 days); the half-lives of the other isotopes range from microseconds to several days. The isotope which is the easiest to synthesize is berkelium-249. This emits mostly soft <a href="Beta%20decay">β-particles</a> which are inconvenient for detection. Its <a href="alpha%20radiation">alpha radiation</a> is rather weak – 1.45% with respect to the β-radiation – but is sometimes used to detect this isotope. The second important berkelium isotope, berkelium-247, is an alpha-emitter, as are most actinide isotopes.

All berkelium isotopes have a half-life far too short to be <a href="primordial%20nuclide">primordial</a>. Therefore, any primordial berkelium, that is, berkelium present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now.

On Earth, berkelium is mostly concentrated in certain areas, which were used for the atmospheric <a href="nuclear%20weapons%20testing">nuclear weapons tests</a> between 1945 and 1980, as well as at the sites of nuclear incidents, such as the <a href="Chernobyl%20disaster">Chernobyl disaster</a>, <a href="Three%20Mile%20Island%20accident">Three Mile Island accident</a> and <a href="1968%20Thule%20Air%20Base%20B-52%20crash">1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash</a>. Analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. <a href="hydrogen%20bomb">hydrogen bomb</a>, <a href="Ivy%20Mike">Ivy Mike</a>, (1 November 1952, <a href="Enewetak%20Atoll">Enewetak Atoll</a>), revealed high concentrations of various actinides, including berkelium. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.

Nuclear reactors produce mostly, among the berkelium isotopes, berkelium-249. During the storage and before the fuel disposal, most of it <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>s to californium-249. The latter has a half-life of 351 years, which is relatively long when compared to the other isotopes produced in the reactor, and is therefore undesirable in the disposal products.

The <a href="transuranic%20element">transuranic element</a>s from <a href="americium">americium</a> to <a href="fermium">fermium</a>, including berkelium, occurred naturally in the <a href="natural%20nuclear%20fission%20reactor">natural nuclear fission reactor</a> at <a href="Oklo">Oklo</a>, but no longer do so.

Although very small amounts of berkelium were possibly produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was <a href="discoveries%20of%20the%20chemical%20elements">first intentionally synthesized</a>, isolated and identified in December 1949 by <a href="Glenn%20T.%20Seaborg">Glenn T. Seaborg</a>, <a href="Albert%20Ghiorso">Albert Ghiorso</a>, <a href="Stanley%20G.%20Thompson">Stanley G. Thompson</a>, and <a href="Kenneth%20Street%2C%20Jr.">Kenneth Street, Jr.</a>. They used the 60-inch <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California, Berkeley</a>. Similar to the nearly simultaneous discovery of <a href="americium">americium</a> (element 95) and <a href="curium">curium</a> (element 96) in 1944, the new elements berkelium and <a href="californium">californium</a> (element 98) were both produced in 1949–1950.

The name choice for element 97 followed the previous tradition of the Californian group to draw an analogy between the newly discovered <a href="actinide">actinide</a> and the <a href="lanthanide">lanthanide</a> element positioned above it in the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>. Previously, americium was named after a continent as its analogue <a href="europium">europium</a>, and curium honored scientists <a href="Marie%20Curie">Marie</a> and <a href="Pierre%20Curie">Pierre Curie</a> as the lanthanide above it, <a href="gadolinium">gadolinium</a>, was named after the explorer of the <a href="rare%20earth%20element">rare earth element</a>s <a href="Johan%20Gadolin">Johan Gadolin</a>. Thus the discovery report by the Berkeley group reads: "It is suggested that element 97 be given the name berkelium (symbol Bk) after the city of Berkeley in a manner similar to that used in naming its chemical homologue <a href="terbium">terbium</a> (atomic number 65) whose name was derived from the town of <a href="Ytterby">Ytterby</a>, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, where the rare earth minerals were first found." This tradition ended on berkelium, though, as the naming of the next discovered actinide, <a href="californium">californium</a>, was not related to its lanthanide analogue <a href="dysprosium">dysprosium</a>, but after the discovery place.

The most difficult steps in the synthesis of berkelium were its separation from the final products and the production of sufficient quantities of americium for the target material. First, americium (Am) <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a> solution was coated on a <a href="platinum">platinum</a> foil, the solution was evaporated and the residue converted by annealing to <a href="americium%20dioxide">americium dioxide</a> (AmO). This target was irradiated with 35 MeV <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s for 6 hours in the 60-inch cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley. The (α,2n) reaction induced by the irradiation yielded the Bk isotope and two free <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s:

After the irradiation, the coating was dissolved with <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> and then precipitated as the <a href="hydroxide">hydroxide</a> using concentrated aqueous <a href="ammonium%20hydroxide">ammonia solution</a>. The product was <a href="centrifugation">centrifugated</a> and re-dissolved in nitric acid. To separate berkelium from the unreacted americium, this solution was added to a mixture of <a href="ammonium">ammonium</a> and <a href="ammonium%20sulfate">ammonium sulfate</a> and heated to convert all the dissolved americium into the <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> +6. Unoxidized residual americium was precipitated by the addition of <a href="hydrofluoric%20acid">hydrofluoric acid</a> as americium(III) <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a> (). This step yielded a mixture of the accompanying product curium and the expected element 97 in form of trifluorides. The mixture was converted to the corresponding hydroxides by treating it with <a href="potassium%20hydroxide">potassium hydroxide</a>, and after centrifugation, was dissolved in <a href="perchloric%20acid">perchloric acid</a>.
Further separation was carried out in the presence of a <a href="citric%20acid">citric acid</a>/<a href="ammonium">ammonium</a> <a href="buffer%20solution">buffer solution</a> in a weakly acidic medium (<a href="pH">pH</a>≈3.5), using <a href="ion%20exchange">ion exchange</a> at elevated temperature. The <a href="chromatography">chromatographic</a> separation behavior was then unknown for the element 97, but was anticipated by analogy with terbium (see elution curves). First results were disappointing as no alpha-particle emission signature could be detected from the elution product. Only the further search for <a href="K-alpha">characteristic X-rays</a> and <a href="Internal%20conversion">conversion electron</a> signals resulted in the identification of a berkelium isotope. Its <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a> was uncertain between 243 and 244 in the initial report, but was later established as 243.

Berkelium is produced by bombarding lighter actinides <a href="uranium">uranium</a> (U) or <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> (Pu) with <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s in a <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>. In a more common case of uranium fuel, plutonium is produced first by <a href="neutron%20capture">neutron capture</a> (the so-called (n,γ) reaction or neutron fusion) followed by beta-decay:

Plutonium-239 is further irradiated by a source that has a high <a href="neutron%20flux">neutron flux</a>, several times higher than a conventional nuclear reactor, such as the 85-megawatt <a href="High%20Flux%20Isotope%20Reactor">High Flux Isotope Reactor</a> (HFIR) at the <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20National%20Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> in Tennessee, USA. The higher flux promotes fusion reactions involving not one but several neutrons, converting Pu to Cm and then to Cm:

Curium-249 has a short half-life of 64 minutes, and thus its further conversion to Cm has a low probability. Instead, it transforms by beta-decay into Bk:

The thus-produced Bk has a long half-life of 330 days and thus can capture another neutron. However, the product, Bk, again has a relatively short half-life of 3.212 hours and thus, does not yield any heavier berkelium isotopes. Instead decays to the californium isotope Cf:

Although Bk is the most stable isotope of berkelium, its production in nuclear reactors is very inefficient due to the long half-life of its potential progenitor curium-247, which does not allow it sufficient time to beta decay before capturing another neutron. Thus, Bk is the most accessible isotope of berkelium, which still, is available only in small quantities (only 0.66 grams have been produced in the US over the period 1967–1983) at a high price of the order 185 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a> per microgram.

The isotope Bk was first obtained in 1956 by bombarding a mixture of curium isotopes with 25 MeV α-particles. Although its direct detection was hindered by strong signal interference with Bk, the existence of a new isotope was proven by the growth of the decay product Cf which had been previously characterized. The half-life of Bk was estimated as 23 ± 5 hours, though later 1965 work gave a half-life in excess of 300 years (which may be due to an isomeric state). Berkelium-247 was produced during the same year by irradiating Cm with alpha-particles:

Berkelium-242 was synthesized in 1979 by bombarding U with B, U with B, Th with N or Th with N. It converts by <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a> to Cm with a half-life of 7.0 ± 1.3 minutes. A search for an initially suspected isotope Bk was then unsuccessful; Bk has since been synthesized.

In 1821 the <a href="French%20people">French</a> <a href="Geology">geologist</a> <a href="Pierre%20Berthier">Pierre Berthier</a> discovered bauxite near the village of <a href="Les%20Baux-de-Provence">Les Baux</a> in <a href="Provence">Provence</a>, southern <a href="France">France</a>. In 1861, French chemist <a href="Henri%20%C3%89tienne%20Sainte-Claire%20Deville">Henri Sainte-Claire Deville</a> named the mineral "bauxite".

<a href="Laterite">Lateritic</a> bauxites (silicate bauxites) are distinguished from <a href="karst">karst</a> bauxite ores (carbonate bauxites). The carbonate bauxites occur predominantly in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a>, and <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> above <a href="carbonate%20rock">carbonate rock</a>s (<a href="limestone">limestone</a> and <a href="dolomite">dolomite</a>), where they were formed by lateritic <a href="weathering">weathering</a> and residual accumulation of intercalated <a href="clay">clay</a> layers – dispersed clays which were concentrated as the enclosing limestones gradually dissolved during <a href="chemical%20weathering">chemical weathering</a>.

The lateritic bauxites are found mostly in the countries of the <a href="tropics">tropics</a>. They were formed by lateritization of various <a href="Silicate%23Silicate%20rock">silicate rocks</a> such as <a href="granite">granite</a>, <a href="gneiss">gneiss</a>, <a href="basalt">basalt</a>, <a href="syenite">syenite</a>, and <a href="shale">shale</a>. In comparison with the iron-rich laterites, the formation of bauxites depends even more on intense weathering conditions in a location with very good drainage. This enables the dissolution of the <a href="kaolinite">kaolinite</a> and the precipitation of the <a href="gibbsite">gibbsite</a>. Zones with highest aluminium content are frequently located below a <a href="Iron%20oxide">ferruginous</a> surface layer. The <a href="aluminium%20hydroxide">aluminium hydroxide</a> in the lateritic bauxite deposits is almost exclusively gibbsite.

In the case of Jamaica, recent analysis of the soils showed elevated levels of <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a>, suggesting that the bauxite originates from recent <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> <a href="Volcanic%20ash">ash</a> deposits from episodes of significant volcanism in Central America.

In 2009, <a href="Australia">Australia</a> was the top producer of bauxite with almost one-third of the world's production, followed by China, Brazil, India, and Guinea. Although aluminium demand is rapidly increasing, known reserves of its bauxite ore are sufficient to meet the worldwide demands for aluminium for many centuries. Increased <a href="aluminium%20recycling">aluminium recycling</a>, which has the advantage of lowering the cost in <a href="electric%20power">electric power</a> in producing aluminium, will considerably extend the world's bauxite reserves.

In November 2010, <a href="Nguyen%20Tan%20Dung">Nguyen Tan Dung</a>, the prime minister of <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, announced that Vietnam's bauxite reserves might total 11,000 <a href="Megatonne">Mt</a>; this would be the largest in the world.

Bauxite is usually <a href="surface%20mining">strip mined</a> because it is almost always found near the surface of the terrain, with little or no <a href="overburden">overburden</a>. As of 2010, approximately 70% to 80% of the world's dry bauxite production is processed first into <a href="alumina">alumina</a> and then into aluminium by <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a>. Bauxite rocks are typically classified according to their intended commercial application: metallurgical, abrasive, cement, chemical, and refractory.

Usually, bauxite ore is heated in a pressure vessel along with a <a href="sodium%20hydroxide">sodium hydroxide</a> solution at a temperature of 150 to 200 °C. At these temperatures, the <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a> is dissolved as <a href="sodium%20aluminate">sodium aluminate</a> (the <a href="Bayer%20process">Bayer process</a>). The aluminium compounds in the bauxite may be present as <a href="gibbsite">gibbsite</a>(Al(OH)), <a href="boehmite">boehmite</a>(AlOOH) or <a href="diaspore">diaspore</a>(AlOOH); the different forms of the aluminium component will dictate the extraction conditions. The undissolved waste, <a href="bauxite%20tailings">bauxite tailings</a>, after the aluminium compounds are extracted contains <a href="iron%20oxides">iron oxides</a>, <a href="silica">silica</a>, <a href="calcia">calcia</a>, <a href="Titanium%20dioxide">titania</a> and some un-reacted <a href="alumina">alumina</a>. After separation of the residue by filtering, pure gibbsite is precipitated when the liquid is cooled, and then seeded with fine-grained aluminium hydroxide. The gibbsite is usually converted into <a href="aluminium%20oxide">aluminium oxide</a>, AlO, by heating in rotary kilns or fluid flash calciners to a temperature in excess of 1000C. This aluminium oxide is dissolved at a temperature of about in molten <a href="cryolite">cryolite</a>. Next, this molten substance can yield metallic aluminium by passing an <a href="electric%20current">electric current</a> through it in the process of electrolysis, which is called the <a href="Hall%E2%80%93H%C3%A9roult%20process">Hall–Héroult process</a>, named after its American and French discoverers.

Prior to the invention of this process, and prior to the <a href="Deville%20process">Deville process</a>, aluminium ore was refined by heating ore along with elemental <a href="sodium">sodium</a> or <a href="potassium">potassium</a> in a <a href="vacuum">vacuum</a>. The method was complicated and consumed materials that were themselves expensive at that time. This made early elemental aluminium more expensive than <a href="gold">gold</a>.

Bavaria

Bavaria ( ; ), officially the Free State of Bavaria ( ) is a landlocked <a href="States%20of%20Germany">federal state</a> of <a href="Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany">Germany</a>, occupying its southeastern corner. With an area of 70,550.19 square kilometres (27,200 sq mi), Bavaria is the largest German state by land area. Its territory comprises roughly a fifth of the total land area of Germany. With 12.9 million inhabitants, it is Germany's second-most-populous state (after <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">North Rhine-Westphalia</a>). Bavaria's capital and largest city, <a href="Munich">Munich</a>, is the third <a href="List%20of%20cities%20in%20Germany%20by%20population">largest city in Germany</a>.

The <a href="history%20of%20Bavaria">history of Bavaria</a> stretches from its earliest settlement and formation as a duchy in the 6th century CE (AD) through the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> to becoming an independent kingdom and finally a <a href="States%20of%20Germany">state</a> of the <a href="Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany">Federal Republic of Germany</a>.

The <a href="Duchy%20of%20Bavaria">Duchy of Bavaria</a> dates back to the year 555. In the 17th century CE (AD), the <a href="Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Duke of Bavaria</a> became a <a href="Prince-elector">Prince-elector</a> of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria">Kingdom of Bavaria</a> existed from 1806 to 1918, when Bavaria became a republic. In 1946, the Free State of Bavaria re-organised itself on democratic lines after the Second World War.

Bavaria has a unique culture, largely because of the state's <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> majority (52%) and conservative traditions. Bavarians have traditionally been proud of their culture, which includes festivals such as <a href="Oktoberfest">Oktoberfest</a> and elements of Alpine symbolism. The state also has the second largest economy among the <a href="List%20of%20German%20states%20by%20GDP">German states by GDP figures</a>, giving it a status as a rather wealthy German region.

Modern Bavaria also includes parts of the historical regions of <a href="Franconia">Franconia</a>, <a href="Upper%20Palatinate">Upper Palatinate</a> and <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>.

The Bavarians emerged in a region north of the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>, previously inhabited by <a href="Celts">Celts</a>, which had been part of the Roman provinces of <a href="Raetia">Raetia</a> and <a href="Noricum">Noricum</a>. The Bavarians spoke <a href="Old%20High%20German">Old High German</a> but, unlike other Germanic groups, probably did not migrate from elsewhere. Rather, they seem to have coalesced out of other groups left behind by Roman withdrawal late in the 5th century. These peoples may have included the Celtic <a href="Boii">Boii</a>, some remaining <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a>, <a href="Marcomanni">Marcomanni</a>, <a href="Allemanni">Allemanni</a>, <a href="Quadi">Quadi</a>, <a href="Thuringians">Thuringians</a>, <a href="Goths">Goths</a>, <a href="Scirians">Scirians</a>, <a href="Rugians">Rugians</a>, <a href="Heruli">Heruli</a>. The name "Bavarian" ("<a href="Baiuvarii">Baiuvarii</a>") means "Men of Baia" which may indicate <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>, the homeland of the Celtic <a href="Boii">Boii</a> and later of the Marcomanni. They first appear in written sources circa 520. A 17th century Jewish chronicler <a href="David%20Gans">David Solomon Ganz</a>, citing <a href="Cyriacus%20Spangenberg">Cyriacus Spangenberg</a>, claimed that the diocese was named after an ancient Bohemian king, Boiia, in the 14th century BCE.

From about 554 to 788, the house of <a href="Agilolfing">Agilolfing</a> ruled the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Bavaria">Duchy of Bavaria</a>, ending with <a href="Tassilo%20III">Tassilo III</a> who was deposed by <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>.

Three early dukes are named in <a href="Franks">Frankish</a> sources: <a href="Garibald%20I">Garibald I</a> may have been appointed to the office by the <a href="Merovingian">Merovingian</a> kings and married the <a href="Lombardy">Lombard</a> princess Walderada when the church forbade her to King <a href="Chlothar%20I">Chlothar I</a> in 555. Their daughter, <a href="Theodelinde">Theodelinde</a>, became Queen of the Lombards in northern Italy and Garibald was forced to flee to her when he fell out with his Frankish overlords. Garibald's successor, <a href="Tassilo%20I%20of%20Bavaria">Tassilo I</a>, tried unsuccessfully to hold the eastern frontier against the expansion of <a href="Slavic%20peoples">Slavs</a> and <a href="Pannonian%20Avars">Avars</a> around 600. Tassilo's son <a href="Garibald%20II%20of%20Bavaria">Garibald II</a> seems to have achieved a balance of power between 610 and 616.

After Garibald II little is known of the Bavarians until <a href="Theodo%20of%20Bavaria%23Ordinals">Duke Theodo I</a>, whose reign may have begun as early as 680. From 696 onwards he invited churchmen from the west to organize churches and strengthen Christianity in his duchy (it is unclear what Bavarian religious life consisted of before this time). His son, <a href="Theodbert%20of%20Bavaria">Theudebert</a>, led a decisive Bavarian campaign to intervene in a succession dispute in the <a href="Lombards">Lombard Kingdom</a> in 714, and married his sister Guntrud to the Lombard <a href="Liutprand%2C%20King%20of%20the%20Lombards">King Liutprand</a>. At Theodo's death the duchy was divided among his sons, but reunited under his grandson <a href="Hugbert%20of%20Bavaria">Hugbert</a>.

At Hugbert's death (735) the duchy passed to a distant relative named <a href="Odilo%20of%20Bavaria">Odilo</a>, from neighbouring Alemannia (modern southwest Germany and northern Switzerland). Odilo issued a <a href="Lex%20Baiuvariorum">law code for Bavaria</a>, completed the process of church organisation in partnership with <a href="Saint%20Boniface">St. Boniface</a> (739), and tried to intervene in Frankish succession disputes by fighting for the claims of the <a href="Carolingian%20dynasty">Carolingian</a> <a href="Grifo">Grifo</a>. He was defeated near <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a> in 743 but continued to rule until his death in 748. <a href="Saint%20Boniface">Saint Boniface</a> completed the people's conversion to Christianity in the early 8th century. Bavaria was in many ways affected by the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a> in the 16th century.

<a href="Tassilo%20III%20of%20Bavaria">Tassilo III</a> (b. 741 – d. after 796) succeeded his father at the age of eight after an unsuccessful attempt by Grifo to rule Bavaria. He initially ruled under Frankish oversight but began to function independently from 763 onwards. He was particularly noted for founding new monasteries and for expanding eastwards, fighting Slavs in the eastern Alps and along the <a href="River%20Danube">River Danube</a> and colonising these lands. After 781, however, his cousin Charlemagne began to pressure Tassilo to submit and finally deposed him in 788. The deposition was not entirely legitimate. Dissenters attempted a coup against Charlemagne at Tassilo's old capital of <a href="Regensburg">Regensburg</a> in 792, led by his own son <a href="Pepin%20the%20Hunchback">Pépin the Hunchback</a>. The king had to drag Tassilo out of imprisonment to formally renounce his rights and titles at the Assembly of Frankfurt in 794. This is the last appearance of Tassilo in the sources, and he probably died a monk. As all of his family were also forced into monasteries, this was the end of the Agilolfing dynasty.

For the next 400 years numerous families held the duchy, rarely for more than three generations. With the revolt of duke <a href="Henry%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Henry the Quarrelsome</a> in 976, Bavaria lost large territories in the south and south east. The territory of "Ostarrichi" was elevated to a duchy in its own right and given to the <a href="House%20of%20Babenberg">Babenberger family</a>. This event marks the founding of Austria.

The last, and one of the most important, of the dukes of Bavaria was <a href="Henry%20the%20Lion">Henry the Lion</a> of the <a href="house%20of%20Welf">house of Welf</a>, founder of Munich, and "de facto" the second most powerful man in the empire as the ruler of two duchies. When in 1180, Henry the Lion was deposed as Duke of <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a> and Bavaria by his cousin, <a href="Frederick%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor</a> (a.k.a. "Barbarossa" for his red beard), Bavaria was awarded as <a href="fief">fief</a> to the <a href="Wittelsbach">Wittelsbach</a> family, counts palatinate of Schyren ("Scheyern" in modern German). They ruled for 738 years, from 1180 to 1918. The <a href="Electorate%20of%20the%20Palatinate">Electorate of the Palatinate</a> by Rhine ("Kurpfalz" in German) was also acquired by the <a href="House%20of%20Wittelsbach">House of Wittelsbach</a> in 1214, which they would subsequently hold for six centuries.

The first of several divisions of the duchy of Bavaria occurred in 1255. With the extinction of the <a href="House%20of%20Hohenstaufen">Hohenstaufen</a> in 1268, <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>n territories were acquired by the Wittelsbach dukes. <a href="Louis%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Louis the Bavarian</a> acquired <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a>, <a href="County%20of%20Tyrol">Tyrol</a>, <a href="County%20of%20Holland">Holland</a> and <a href="County%20of%20Hainaut">Hainaut</a> for his House but released the <a href="Upper%20Palatinate">Upper Palatinate</a> for the Palatinate branch of the Wittelsbach in 1329. In the 14th and 15th centuries, upper and lower Bavaria were repeatedly subdivided. Four Duchies existed after the division of 1392: <a href="Bavaria-Straubing">Bavaria-Straubing</a>, <a href="Bavaria-Landshut">Bavaria-Landshut</a>, <a href="Bavaria-Ingolstadt">Bavaria-Ingolstadt</a> and <a href="Bavaria-Munich">Bavaria-Munich</a>. In 1506 with the <a href="Landshut%20War%20of%20Succession">Landshut War of Succession</a>, the other parts of Bavaria were reunited, and Munich became the sole capital.

In 1623 the Bavarian duke replaced his relative of the Palatinate branch, the <a href="Electorate%20of%20the%20Palatinate">Electorate of the Palatinate</a> in the early days of the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a> and acquired the powerful <a href="prince-elector">prince-elector</a>al dignity in the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, determining its Emperor thence forward, as well as special legal status under the empire's laws. The country became one of the Jesuit supported counter-reformation centers. During the early and mid-18th century the ambitions of the Bavarian prince electors led to several wars with Austria as well as occupations by Austria (<a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, election of a Wittelsbach emperor instead of a Habsburger). From 1777 onwards and after the younger Bavarian branch of the family had died out with elector <a href="Maximilian%20III%20Joseph%2C%20Elector%20of%20Bavaria">Max III Joseph</a>, Bavaria and the <a href="Electorate%20of%20the%20Palatinate">Electorate of the Palatinate</a> were governed once again in <a href="personal%20union">personal union</a>, now by the Palatinian lines. The new state also comprised the <a href="Duchy%20of%20J%C3%BClich">Duchies of Jülich</a> and <a href="Berg%20%28state%29">Berg</a> as these on their part were in personal union with the Palatinate.

When <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> abolished the Holy Roman Empire, Bavaria became a <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria">kingdom</a> in 1806 due, in part, to the <a href="Confederation%20of%20the%20Rhine">Confederation of the Rhine</a>. Its area doubled after the Duchy of Jülich was ceded to France, as the Electoral Palatinate was divided between France and the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Baden">Grand Duchy of Baden</a>. The Duchy of Berg was given to <a href="Jerome%20Bonaparte">Jerome Bonaparte</a>. The <a href="County%20of%20Tyrol">Tyrol</a> and <a href="Salzburg%20%28state%29">Salzburg</a> were temporarily reunited with Bavaria but finally ceded to Austria by the <a href="Congress%20of%20Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a>. In return Bavaria was allowed to annex the modern-day region of <a href="Palatinate%20%28region%29">Palatinate</a> to the left of the Rhine and <a href="Franconia">Franconia</a> in 1815. Between 1799 and 1817, the leading minister, Count <a href="Maximilian%20Joseph%20von%20Montgelas">Montgelas</a>, followed a strict policy of modernisation; he laid the foundations of administrative structures that survived the monarchy and retain core validity in the 21st century. In May 1808 a first constitution was passed by <a href="Maximilian%20I%20Joseph%20of%20Bavaria">Maximilian I</a>, being modernized in 1818. This second version established a bicameral Parliament with a House of Lords ("Kammer der Reichsräte") and a House of Commons ("Kammer der Abgeordneten"). That constitution was followed until the collapse of the monarchy at the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.
After the rise of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Prussia</a> to power, Bavaria preserved its independence by playing off the rivalries of Prussia and <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austria</a>. Allied to Austria, it was defeated in the 1866 <a href="Austro-Prussian%20War">Austro-Prussian War</a> and did not belong to the <a href="North%20German%20Federation">North German Federation</a> of 1867, but the question of German unity was still alive. When <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">France declared war on Prussia in 1870</a>, the south German states Baden, Württemberg, Hessen-Darmstadt and Bavaria joined the Prussian forces (whereas Austria did not) and ultimately joined the Federation, which was renamed <a href="German%20Empire">"Deutsches Reich" (German Empire)</a> in 1871. Bavaria continued as a monarchy, and it had some special rights within the federation (such as an army, railways and a postal service of its own).

When Bavaria became part of the newly formed German Empire, this action was considered controversial by <a href="Bavarian%20nationalism">Bavarian nationalists</a> who had wanted to retain independence, as Austria was. As Bavaria had a majority-Catholic population, many people resented being ruled by the mostly <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> northerners of <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>. As a direct result of the Bavarian-Prussian feud, political parties formed to encourage Bavaria to break away and regain its independence. Although the idea of Bavarian separatism was popular in the late 19th and early 20th century, apart from a small minority such as the <a href="Bavaria%20Party">Bavaria Party</a>, most Bavarians have accepted that Bavaria is part of Germany.

In the early-20th century, <a href="Wassily%20Kandinsky">Wassily Kandinsky</a>, <a href="Paul%20Klee">Paul Klee</a>, <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a>, and other notable artists were drawn to Bavaria, notably to the <a href="Schwabing">Schwabing</a> district of Munich, a center of international artistic activity. This area was devastated by bombing and invasion during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

"Free State" has been an adopted designation after the abolition of monarchy in the aftermath of World War I in several German states.
On 12 November 1918, <a href="Ludwig%20III%20of%20Bavaria">Ludwig III</a> signed a document, the <a href="Anif%20declaration">Anif declaration</a>, releasing both civil and military officers from their oaths; the <a href="People%27s%20State%20of%20Bavaria">newly formed republican government</a>, or "People's State" of Socialist premier <a href="Kurt%20Eisner">Kurt Eisner</a>, interpreted this as an abdication. To date, however, no member of the House of Wittelsbach has ever formally declared renunciation of the throne. On the other hand, none has ever since officially called upon their Bavarian or Stuart claims. Family members are active in cultural and social life, including the head of the house, <a href="Franz%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Franz, Duke of Bavaria</a>. They step back from any announcements on public affairs, showing approval or disapproval solely by Franz's presence or absence.

Eisner was assassinated in February 1919, ultimately leading to a Communist revolt and the short-lived <a href="Bavarian%20Soviet%20Republic">Bavarian Soviet Republic</a> being proclaimed 6 April 1919. After violent suppression by elements of the German Army and notably the <a href="Freikorps">Freikorps</a>, the Bavarian Soviet Republic fell in May 1919. The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Bavaria">Bamberg Constitution</a> ("") was enacted on 12 or 14 August 1919 and came into force on 15 September 1919 creating the Free State of Bavaria within the Weimar Republic. Extremist activity further increased, notably the 1923 <a href="Beer%20Hall%20Putsch">Beer Hall Putsch</a> led by the <a href="NSDAP">National Socialists</a>, and Munich and Nuremberg became seen as <a href="Nazism">Nazi</a> strongholds under the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a> of <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. However, in the crucial <a href="German%20federal%20election%2C%20March%201933">German federal election, March 1933</a>, the Nazis received less than 50% of the votes cast in Bavaria.

As a manufacturing centre, Munich was heavily bombed during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and was occupied by U.S. troops, becoming a major part of the American Zone of <a href="Allied-occupied%20Germany">Allied-occupied Germany</a> (1945–47) and then of <a href="Bizone">"Bizonia"</a>.

The Rhenish Palatinate was detached from Bavaria in 1946 and made part of the new state <a href="Rhineland-Palatinate">Rhineland-Palatinate</a>. During the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, Bavaria was part of <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>. In 1949, the Free State of Bavaria chose not to sign the Founding Treaty ("Gründungsvertrag") for the formation of the Federal Republic of Germany, opposing the division of Germany into two states, after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The <a href="Landtag%20of%20Bavaria">Bavarian Parliament</a> did not sign the <a href="Basic%20Law%20of%20Germany">Basic Law of Germany</a>, mainly because it was seen as not granting sufficient powers to the individual "Länder", but at the same time decided that it would still come into force in Bavaria if two-thirds of the other "Länder" ratified it. All of the other "Länder" ratified it, and so it became law.

Bavarians have often emphasized a separate national identity and considered themselves as "Bavarians" first, "Germans" second. This feeling started to come about more strongly among Bavarians when the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bavaria">Kingdom of Bavaria</a> joined the Protestant Prussian-dominated <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> while the <a href="Bavarian%20nationalism">Bavarian nationalists</a> wanted to keep Bavaria as Catholic and an independent state. Nowadays, aside from the minority <a href="Bavaria%20Party">Bavaria Party</a>, most Bavarians accept that Bavaria is part of Germany. Another consideration is that Bavarians foster different cultural identities: <a href="Franconia">Franconia</a> in the north, speaking <a href="East%20Franconian%20German">East Franconian German</a>; Bavarian Swabia in the south west, speaking <a href="Swabian%20German">Swabian German</a>; and <a href="Altbayern">Altbayern</a> (so-called "Old Bavaria", the regions forming the "historic", pentagon-shaped Bavaria before the acquisitions through the Vienna Congress, at present the districts of the Upper Palatinate, Lower and Upper Bavaria) speaking <a href="Bavarian%20language">Austro-Bavarian</a>. In Munich, the Old Bavarian dialect was widely spread, but nowadays <a href="High%20German%20languages">High German</a> is predominantly spoken there.

The modern coat of arms of Bavaria was designed by Eduard Ege in 1946, following heraldic traditions.

Bavaria shares international borders with <a href="Austria">Austria</a> (<a href="Salzburg%20%28state%29">Salzburg</a>, <a href="Tyrol%20%28state%29">Tyrol</a>, <a href="Upper%20Austria">Upper Austria</a> and <a href="Vorarlberg">Vorarlberg</a>) and the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a> (<a href="Karlovy%20Vary%20Region">Karlovy Vary</a>, <a href="Plze%C5%88%20Region">Plzeň</a> and <a href="South%20Bohemian%20Region">South Bohemian Region</a>s) as well as with <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> (across <a href="Lake%20Constance">Lake Constance</a> to the <a href="Canton%20of%20St.%20Gallen">Canton of St. Gallen</a>). Because all of these countries are part of the <a href="Schengen%20Area">Schengen Area</a>, the border is completely open. Neighbouring states within Germany are <a href="Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg">Baden-Württemberg</a>, Hesse, <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a> and <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a>. Two major rivers flow through the state: the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> ("Donau") and the <a href="Main%20%28river%29">Main</a>. The <a href="Bavarian%20Alps">Bavarian Alps</a> define the border with Austria (including the Austrian federal-states of Vorarlberg, Tyrol and Salzburg), and within the range is the highest peak in Germany: the <a href="Zugspitze">Zugspitze</a>. The <a href="Bavarian%20Forest">Bavarian Forest</a> and the <a href="Bohemian%20Forest">Bohemian Forest</a> form the vast majority of the frontier with the Czech Republic and Bohemia.

The major cities in Bavaria are <a href="Munich">Munich</a> ("München"), <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> ("Nürnberg"), <a href="Augsburg">Augsburg</a>, <a href="Regensburg">Regensburg</a>, <a href="W%C3%BCrzburg">Würzburg</a>, <a href="Ingolstadt">Ingolstadt</a>, <a href="F%C3%BCrth">Fürth</a> and <a href="Erlangen">Erlangen</a>.

Bavaria is divided into 7 administrative districts called ' (singular ').


' (districts) are the third communal layer in Bavaria; the others are the ' and the ' or '. The ' in Bavaria are territorially identical with the ' (e.g. ), but are a different form of administration, having their own parliaments, etc. In the other larger states of Germany, there are ' which are only administrative divisions and not self-governing entities as the ' in Bavaria.

These administrative regions consist of 71 administrative districts (called ', singular ', e.g. rural districts) and 25 independent cities (', singular ', e.g. urban districts) that are comparable to Counties (only that there is no distinction between "Ceremonial" and "Administrative" and all have the same administrative responsibilities).

Landkreise:
Kreis-free Cities:
The 71 administrative districts are on the lowest level divided into 2031 regular municipalities (called ', singular '). Together with the 25 independent cities (', which are in effect municipalities independent of ' administrations), there are a total of 2056 municipalities in Bavaria.

In 44 of the 71 administrative districts, there are a total of 215 <a href="unincorporated%20area">unincorporated area</a>s (as of 1 January 2005, called ', singular '), not belonging to any municipality, all uninhabited, mostly forested areas, but also four lakes (-without islands, -without island , , which are the three largest lakes of Bavaria, and ).

The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Bavaria">Constitution of Bavaria</a> of the free state of Bavaria was enacted on 8 December 1946. The new Bavarian Constitution became the basis for the Bavarian State after the Second World War.

Bavaria has a <a href="unicameral">unicameral</a> ', or state parliament, elected by universal suffrage. Until December 1999, there was also a ', or <a href="Bavarian%20Senate">Senate</a>, whose members were chosen by social and economic groups in Bavaria, but following a referendum in 1998, this institution was abolished.

The Bavarian State Government consists of the <a href="Minister-President%20of%20Bavaria">Minister-President of Bavaria</a>, 11 Ministers and 6 Secretaries of State. The Minister-President is elected for a period of five years by the State Parliament and is head of state. With the approval of the State Parliament he appoints the members of the State Government. The State Government is composed of the:


Political processes also take place in the 7 regions (' / ') in Bavaria, in the 71 administrative districts (') and the 25 towns and cities forming their own districts ('), and in the 2,031 local authorities (").

In 1995 Bavaria introduced <a href="direct%20democracy">direct democracy</a> on the local level in a <a href="referendum">referendum</a>. This was initiated bottom-up by an association called "Mehr Demokratie" (More Democracy). This is a grass-roots organization which campaigns for the right to citizen-initiated referendums. In 1997 the Bavarian Supreme Court aggravated the regulations considerably (e.g. by introducing a turn-out quorum). Nevertheless, Bavaria has the most advanced regulations on local direct democracy in Germany. This has led to a spirited citizens' participation in communal and municipal affairs—835 referenda took place from 1995 through 2005.

Bavaria has a multi-party system dominated by the conservative <a href="Christian%20Social%20Union%20of%20Bavaria">Christian Social Union</a> (CSU), which has won every election since 1945, and the center-left <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Social Democrats</a> (SPD) . Thus far <a href="Wilhelm%20Hoegner">Wilhelm Hoegner</a> has been the only SPD candidate to ever become Minister-President; notable successors in office include multi-term Federal Minister <a href="Franz%20Josef%20Strauss">Franz Josef Strauss</a>, a key figure among <a href="West%20German">West German</a> conservatives during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> years, and <a href="Edmund%20Stoiber">Edmund Stoiber</a>, who both failed with their bids for <a href="Federal%20Chancellor%20of%20Germany">Chancellorship</a>. The German Greens and the center-right Free Voters have been represented in the state parliament since 1986 and 2008 respectively.

In the <a href="Bavaria%20state%20election%2C%202003">2003 elections</a> the CSU won a <a href="Supermajority">⅔ supermajority</a> – something no party had ever achieved in post-war Germany. However, in the subsequent <a href="Bavaria%20state%20election%2C%202008">2008 elections</a> the CSU lost the absolute majority for the first time in 46 years. The losses were partly attributed to the CSU's stance against an anti-smoking bill. (First anti-smoking referendum was passed but subverted, so a second
referendum enforced it with a larger majority).

The <a href="Bavaria%20state%20election%2C%202013">last state elections</a> were held on 15 September 2013; the CSU won an absolute majority in the state parliament in spite of bad press surrounding a cronyism affair. The CSU's former coalition partner <a href="Free%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Germany%29">Free Democrats</a> (FDP) failed to gain caucus recognition amidst a downward trend for the party in all of Germany. 
The 17th parliamentary term comprises 180 mandates of which the CSU won 101, the SPD 42, the <a href="Free%20Voters">Free Voters</a> 19 and the <a href="Alliance%20%2790/The%20Greens">Alliance '90/The Greens</a> 18.

Unlike most German states ("Länder"), which simply designate themselves as "State of X" ("Land X"), Bavaria uses the style of "Free State of Bavaria" ("Freistaat Bayern"). The difference from other states is purely terminological, as German constitutional law does not draw a distinction between "States" and "Free States". The situation is thus analogous to the United States, where some states use the style "Commonwealth" rather than "State". The choice of "Free State", a creation of the early 20th century and intended to be a German alternative to (or translation of) the Latin-derived "republic", has historical reasons, Bavaria having been styled that way even before the current 1946 constitution was enacted (i.e. in 1918 after the "de facto" abdication of Ludwig III). Two other states, <a href="Saxony">Saxony</a> and <a href="Thuringia">Thuringia</a>, also use the style "Free State"; unlike Bavaria, however, these were not part of the original states when the <a href="Grundgesetz">Grundgesetz</a> was enacted but joined the federation later on, in 1990, as a result of <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a>. Saxony had used the designation as "Free State" from 1918 to 1952.

In July 2017, Bavaria's parliament enacted a new revision of the "Gefährdergesetz", allowing the authorities to imprison a person for a three months term, renewable indefinitely, when he or she has not committed a crime but it is assumed that he or she might commit a crime "in the near future". Critics like the prominent journalist <a href="Heribert%20Prantl">Heribert Prantl</a> have called the law "shameful" and compared it to <a href="Guantanamo%20Bay%20detention%20camp">Guantanamo Bay detention camp</a>, assessed it to be in violation of the <a href="European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a>, and also compared it to the legal situation in Russia, where a similar law allows for imprisonment for a maximum term of two years (i.e., not indefinitely)

Bavaria has long had one of the largest economies of any region in Germany, or Europe for that matter. Its GDP in 2007 exceeded 434 billion Euros (about 600 bn US$). This makes Bavaria itself one of the largest economies in Europe and only 20 countries in the world have a higher GDP. Some large companies headquartered in Bavaria include <a href="BMW">BMW</a>, <a href="Siemens%20AG">Siemens</a>, <a href="Rohde%20%26amp%3B%20Schwarz">Rohde & Schwarz</a>, <a href="Audi">Audi</a>, <a href="Munich%20Re">Munich Re</a>, <a href="Allianz">Allianz</a>, <a href="Infineon">Infineon</a>, <a href="MAN%20SE">MAN</a>, <a href="Wacker%20Chemie">Wacker Chemie</a>, <a href="Puma%20SE">Puma</a>, <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a>, and <a href="Ruf%20Automobile">Ruf</a>. Bavaria has a GDP per capita of over $48,000 US, meaning that if it were its own independent country it would rank 7th or 8th in the world.

The population of Bavaria is 12,843,514 (2015). Countries of origin of the major immigrant groups are as listed below:

Some features of the Bavarian culture and mentality are remarkably distinct from the rest of Germany. Noteworthy differences (especially in rural areas, less significant in the major cities) can be found with respect to:

Bavarian culture ("<a href="Altbayern">Altbayern</a>") has a long and predominant tradition of <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> faith. Pope emeritus <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI">Benedict XVI (Joseph Alois Ratzinger)</a> was born in <a href="Marktl%20am%20Inn">Marktl am Inn</a> in <a href="Upper%20Bavaria">Upper Bavaria</a> and was <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Munich%20and%20Freising">Cardinal-Archbishop of Munich and Freising</a>. Otherwise, the culturally <a href="Franconia">Franconia</a>n and <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>n regions of the modern State of Bavaria are historically more diverse in religiosity, with both Catholic and <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> traditions. In 1925, 70.0% of the Bavarian population was <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a>, 28.8% was <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a>, 0.7% was <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a>, and 0.5% was placed in other religious categories.

Bavarians commonly emphasize pride in their traditions. Traditional costumes collectively known as <a href="Tracht">Tracht</a> are worn on special occasions and include in <a href="Altbayern">Altbayern</a> <a href="Lederhosen">Lederhosen</a> for males and <a href="Dirndl">Dirndl</a> for females. Centuries-old folk music is performed. The <a href="Maypole%20tradition%20in%20Bavaria">Maibaum</a>, or Maypole (which in the Middle Ages served as the community's yellow pages, as figurettes on the pole represent the trades of the village), and the bagpipes in the Upper Palatinate region bear witness to the <a href="Paganism%20in%20the%20Eastern%20Alps">ancient Celtic and Germanic</a> remnants of cultural heritage of the region. There are a lot of traditional Bavarian sports disciplines, e.g. the <a href="Aperschnalzen">Aperschnalzen</a> is an old tradition of competitive <a href="whipcracking">whipcracking</a>.

Whether actually in Bavaria, overseas or full of citizens from other nations they continue to cultivate their traditions. They hold festivals and dances to keep their traditions alive. In New York City the German American Cultural Society is a larger umbrella group for others such as the Bavarian organizations, which represent a specific part of Germany. They proudly put forth a German Parade called <a href="Steuben%20Parade">Steuben Parade</a> each year. Various affiliated events take place amongst its groups, one of which is the Bavarian Dancers.

Bavarians tend to place a great value on <a href="Bavarian%20cuisine">food and drink</a>. In addition to their renowned dishes, Bavarians also consume many items of food and drink which are unusual elsewhere in Germany; for example ("white sausage") or in some instances a variety of entrails. At folk festivals and in many <a href="beer%20garden">beer garden</a>s, beer is traditionally served by the litre (in a ). Bavarians are particularly proud of the traditional , or purity law, initially established by the <a href="Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Duke of Bavaria</a> for the City of Munich (e.g. the court) in 1487 and the duchy in 1516. According to this law, only three ingredients were allowed in beer: water, <a href="barley">barley</a>, and <a href="hops">hops</a>. In 1906 the made its way to all-German law, and remained a law in Germany until the EU partly struck it down recently as incompatible with the European common market. German breweries, however, cling to the principle, and Bavarian breweries still comply with it in order to distinguish their beer blend. Bavarians are also known as some of the world's most beer-loving people with an average annual consumption of 170 litres per person, although figures have been declining in recent years.

Bavaria is also home to the <a href="Franconia%20%28wine%20region%29">Franconia wine region</a>, which is situated along the <a href="Main%20River">Main River</a> in Franconia. The region has produced wine ("Frankenwein") for over 1,000 years and is famous for its use of the <a href="Bocksbeutel">Bocksbeutel</a> wine bottle. The production of wine forms an integral part of the regional culture, and many of its villages and cities hold their own wine festivals (Weinfeste) throughout the year.

Mainly three German dialects are spoken in Bavaria: <a href="Austro-Bavarian">Austro-Bavarian</a> in Old Bavaria (South-East and East), <a href="Swabian%20German">Swabian German</a> (an <a href="Alemannic%20German">Alemannic German</a> dialect) in the Bavarian part of Swabia (South West) and <a href="East%20Franconian%20German">East Franconian German</a> in Franconia (North). In the small town <a href="Ludwigsstadt">Ludwigsstadt</a> in the north, district Kronach in Upper Franconia, <a href="Thuringian%20dialect">Thuringian dialect</a> is spoken. In the 20th century an increasing part of the population began to speak <a href="Standard%20German">Standard German</a>, mainly in the cities.

Bavarians consider themselves to be <a href="egalitarian">egalitarian</a> and informal. Their sociability can be experienced at the annual <a href="Oktoberfest">Oktoberfest</a>, the world's largest beer festival, which welcomes around six million visitors every year, or in the famous <a href="beer%20garden">beer garden</a>s. In traditional Bavarian beer gardens, patrons may bring their own food but buy beer only from the brewery that runs the beer garden. 
In the United States, particularly among <a href="German%20Americans">German Americans</a>, Bavarian culture is viewed somewhat nostalgically, and several "Bavarian villages" have been founded, most notably <a href="Frankenmuth%2C%20Michigan">Frankenmuth, Michigan</a>; <a href="Helen%2C%20Georgia">Helen, Georgia</a>; and <a href="Leavenworth%2C%20Washington">Leavenworth, Washington</a>. Since 1962, the latter has been styled with a Bavarian theme and is home to an Oktoberfest celebration it claims is among the most attended in the world outside of Munich.

Bavaria is home to several football clubs including <a href="FC%20Bayern%20Munich">FC Bayern Munich</a>, <a href="1.%20FC%20N%C3%BCrnberg">1. FC Nürnberg</a>, <a href="FC%20Augsburg">FC Augsburg</a>, <a href="TSV%201860%20Munich">TSV 1860 Munich</a>, <a href="FC%20Ingolstadt%2004">FC Ingolstadt 04</a> and <a href="SpVgg%20Greuther%20F%C3%BCrth">SpVgg Greuther Fürth</a>. Bayern Munich is the most popular and successful football team in Germany having won a record 27 German titles. They are followed by 1. FC Nürnberg who have won 9 titles. SpVgg Greuther Fürth have won 3 championships while TSV 1860 Munich have been champions once. FC Bayern won the 2013 UEFA Champions League final.

Many famous people have been born or lived in present-day Bavaria:

Brandenburg

Brandenburg (; , <a href="Lower%20Sorbian%20language">Lower Sorbian</a>: "Bramborska", ) is one of the sixteen <a href="states%20of%20Germany">federated states</a> of <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. It lies in the northeast of the country covering an area of 29,478 square kilometers and has 2.48 million inhabitants. The capital and <a href="List%20of%20cities%20in%20Germany%20by%20population">largest city</a> is <a href="Potsdam">Potsdam</a>. Brandenburg surrounds but does not include the national capital and city-state <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> forming a metropolitan area.

Originating in the medieval <a href="Northern%20March">Northern March</a>, the <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg">Margraviate of Brandenburg</a> <a href="Brandenburg-Prussia">grew</a> to become the core of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a>, which would later become the <a href="Free%20State%20of%20Prussia">Free State of Prussia</a> with part being the <a href="province%20of%20Brandenburg">province of Brandenburg</a>. Brandenburg is one of the federal states that were re-created in 1990 upon the <a href="German%20reunification">reunification</a> of the former <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a> and <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>.

In late medieval and early modern times, Brandenburg was one of seven <a href="prince-elector">electoral states</a> of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>, and, along with Prussia, formed the original core of the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a>, the first unified German state. Governed by the <a href="House%20of%20Hohenzollern">Hohenzollern dynasty</a> from 1415, it contained the future German capital Berlin. After 1618 the <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg">Margraviate of Brandenburg</a> and the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Prussia">Duchy of Prussia</a> were combined to form <a href="Brandenburg-Prussia">Brandenburg-Prussia</a>, which was ruled by the same branch of the <a href="House%20of%20Hohenzollern">House of Hohenzollern</a>. In 1701 the state was elevated as the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a>. Franconian <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> and <a href="Ansbach">Ansbach</a>, Swabian <a href="Burg%20Hohenzollern">Hohenzollern</a>, the eastern European connections of Berlin, and the status of Brandenburg's ruler as <a href="prince-elector">prince-elector</a> together were instrumental in the rise of that state.

Brandenburg is situated in territory known in antiquity as <a href="Magna%20Germania">Magna Germania</a>, which reached to the Vistula river. By the 7th century, <a href="Slavic%20peoples">Slavic peoples</a> are believed to have settled in the Brandenburg area. The Slavs expanded from the east, possibly driven from their homelands in present-day Ukraine and perhaps Belarus by the invasions of the <a href="Huns">Huns</a> and <a href="Pannonian%20Avars">Avars</a>. They relied heavily on river transport. The two principal Slavic groups in the present-day area of Brandenburg were the <a href="Hevelli">Hevelli</a> in the west and the <a href="Sprevane">Sprevane</a> in the east.

Beginning in the early 10th century, <a href="Henry%20the%20Fowler">Henry the Fowler</a> and his successors conquered territory up to the <a href="Oder%20River">Oder River</a>. Slavic settlements such as Brenna (<a href="Brandenburg%20an%20der%20Havel">Brandenburg an der Havel</a>), Budusin (<a href="Bautzen">Bautzen</a>), and Chośebuz (<a href="Cottbus">Cottbus</a>) came under <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">imperial</a> control through the installation of margraves. Their main function was to defend and protect the eastern <a href="marches">marches</a>. In 948 Emperor <a href="Otto%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Otto I</a> established margraves to exert imperial control over the pagan Slavs west of the Oder River. Otto founded the Bishoprics of <a href="Bishopric%20of%20Brandenburg">Brandenburg</a> and <a href="Bishopric%20of%20Havelberg">Havelberg</a>. The <a href="Northern%20March">Northern March</a> was founded as a northeastern border territory of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a>. However, a great uprising of <a href="Wends">Wends</a> drove imperial forces from the territory of present-day Brandenburg in 983. The region returned to the control of Slavic leaders.

During the 12th century, the <a href="Ottonian">Ottonian</a> German kings and emperors re-established control over the mixed Slav-inhabited lands of present-day Brandenburg, although some Slavs like the <a href="Sorbs">Sorbs</a> in <a href="Lusatia">Lusatia</a> adapted to <a href="Germanization">Germanization</a> while retaining their distinctiveness. The Roman Catholic Church brought bishoprics which, with their walled towns, afforded protection from attacks for the townspeople. With the monks and bishops, the history of the town of <a href="Brandenburg%20%28town%29">Brandenburg an der Havel</a>, which was the first center of the state of Brandenburg, began.

In 1134, in the wake of a German <a href="Northern%20Crusade">crusade</a> against the <a href="Wends">Wends</a>, the German magnate, <a href="Albert%20the%20Bear">Albert the Bear</a>, was granted the <a href="Northern%20March">Northern March</a> by the Emperor <a href="Lothair%20III%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Lothar III</a>. He formally inherited the town of Brandenburg and the lands of the Hevelli from their last Wendish ruler, <a href="Pribislav%20of%20Brandenburg">Pribislav</a>, in 1150. After crushing a force of Sprevane who occupied the town of Brandenburg in the 1150s, Albert proclaimed himself ruler of the new <a href="Margraviate%20of%20Brandenburg">Margraviate of Brandenburg</a>. Albert, and his descendants the <a href="House%20of%20Ascania">Ascanians</a>, then made considerable progress in conquering, colonizing, Christianizing, and cultivating lands as far east as the Oder. Within this region, Slavic and German residents intermarried. During the 13th century, the Ascanians began acquiring territory east of the Oder, later known as the <a href="Neumark">Neumark</a> (see also <a href="Altmark">Altmark</a>).

In 1320, the Brandenburg Ascanian line came to an end, and from 1323 up until 1415 Brandenburg was under the control of the <a href="Wittelsbach">Wittelsbach</a>s of <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>, followed by the <a href="House%20of%20Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a> Dynasties. Under the Luxembourgs, the <a href="Margrave%20of%20Brandenburg">Margrave of Brandenburg</a> gained the status of a <a href="prince-elector">prince-elector</a> of the Holy Roman Empire. In the period 1373-1415, Brandenburg was a part of the <a href="Lands%20of%20the%20Bohemian%20Crown">Lands of the Bohemian Crown</a>. In 1415, the Electorate of Brandenburg was granted by Emperor <a href="Sigismund%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Sigismund</a> to the <a href="House%20of%20Hohenzollern">House of Hohenzollern</a>, which would rule until the end of World War I. The Hohenzollerns established their capital in Berlin, by then the economic center of Brandenburg.

Brandenburg converted to Protestantism in 1539 in the wake of the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, and generally did quite well in the 16th century, with the expansion of trade along the Elbe, Havel, and Spree Rivers. The Hohenzollerns expanded their territory by co-rulership since 1577 and acquiring the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Prussia">Duchy of Prussia</a> in 1618, the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Cleves">Duchy of Cleves</a> (1614) in the <a href="Rhineland">Rhineland</a>, and territories in <a href="Westphalia">Westphalia</a>. The result was a sprawling, disconnected country known as <a href="Brandenburg-Prussia">Brandenburg-Prussia</a> that was in poor shape to defend itself during the <a href="Thirty%20Years%27%20War">Thirty Years' War</a>.

Beginning near the end of that devastating conflict, however, Brandenburg enjoyed a string of talented rulers who expanded their territory and power in Europe. The first of these was <a href="Frederick%20William%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">Frederick William</a>, the so-called "Great Elector", who worked tirelessly to rebuild and consolidate the nation. He moved the royal residence to <a href="Potsdam">Potsdam</a>. At the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Westphalia">Treaty of Westphalia</a>, his envoy <a href="Joachim%20Friedrich%20von%20Blumenthal">Joachim Friedrich von Blumenthal</a> negotiated the acquisition of several important territories such as <a href="Halberstadt">Halberstadt</a>. Under the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Oliva">Treaty of Oliva</a> Christoph Caspar <a href="von%20Blumenthal">von Blumenthal</a>(son of the above) negotiated the incorporation of the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Prussia">Duchy of Prussia</a> into the Hohenzollern inheritance.

When Frederick William died in 1688, he was followed by his son <a href="Frederick%20I%20of%20Prussia">Frederick</a>, third of that name in Brandenburg. As the lands that had been acquired in Prussia were outside the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire, Frederick assumed (as Frederick I) the title of "<a href="King%20in%20Prussia">King in Prussia</a>" (1701). Although his self-promotion from margrave to king relied on his title to the Duchy of Prussia, Brandenburg was still the most important portion of the kingdom. However, this combined state is known as the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">Kingdom of Prussia</a>.

Brandenburg remained the core of the Kingdom of Prussia, and it was the site of the kingdom's capitals, Berlin and Potsdam. When Prussia was subdivided into provinces in 1815, the territory of the Margraviate of Brandenburg became the <a href="Province%20of%20Brandenburg">Province of Brandenburg</a>, again subdivided into the <a href="Regierungsbezirk%20Frankfurt">government regions of Frankfurt</a> and <a href="Potsdam">Potsdam</a>. In 1881, the City of Berlin was separated from the Province of Brandenburg. However, industrial towns ringing Berlin lay within Brandenburg, and the growth of the region's industrial economy brought an increase in the population of the province. The Province of Brandenburg had an area of and a population of 2.6 million (1925). After World War II, the <a href="Neumark%20%28region%29">Neumark</a>, the part of Brandenburg east of the <a href="Oder-Neisse%20Line">Oder-Neisse Line</a>, was transferred to <a href="Poland">Poland</a>; and its native German population expelled. The remainder of the province became a state in the <a href="Soviet%20Zone%20of%20occupation%20in%20Germany">Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany</a> when Prussia was dissolved in 1947.

Since the foundation of <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a> in 1949 Brandenburg formed one of its component states. The State of Brandenburg was completely dissolved in 1952 by the <a href="Council%20of%20Ministers%20of%20the%20GDR">Socialist government of East Germany</a>, doing away with all component states. The East German government then divided Brandenburg among several "Bezirke" or districts. (See <a href="Administrative%20division%20of%20the%20German%20Democratic%20Republic">Administrative division of the German Democratic Republic</a>). Most of Brandenburg lay within the <a href="Cottbus%20%28Bezirk%29">Bezirke of Cottbus</a>, <a href="Frankfurt%20%28Bezirk%29">Frankfurt</a>, or <a href="Potsdam%20%28Bezirk%29">Potsdam</a>, but parts of the former province passed to the <a href="Schwerin%20%28Bezirk%29">Schwerin</a>, <a href="Neubrandenburg%20%28Bezirk%29">Neubrandenburg</a> and <a href="Magdeburg%20%28Bezirk%29">Magdeburg districts</a> (town <a href="Havelberg">Havelberg</a>). East Germany relied heavily on <a href="lignite">lignite</a> (the lowest grade of coal) as an energy source, and lignite strip mines marred areas of southeastern Brandenburg. The industrial towns surrounding Berlin were important to the East German economy, while rural Brandenburg remained mainly agricultural.

The present State of Brandenburg was re-established on 3 October 1990 upon <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a>. The newly elected Landtag of Brandenburg first met on 26 October 1990. As in other former parts of East Germany, the lack of modern infrastructure and exposure to West Germany's competitive market economy brought widespread unemployment and economic difficulty. In the recent years, however, Brandenburg's infrastructure has been modernized and unemployment has slowly declined.

In 1995, the governments of Berlin and Brandenburg proposed to merge the states in order to form a new state with the name of "Berlin-Brandenburg", though some suggested calling the proposed new state "Prussia". The merger was rejected in a <a href="plebiscite">plebiscite</a> in 1996 – while West Berliners voted for a merger, East Berliners and Brandenburgers voted against it.

Brandenburg is bordered by <a href="Mecklenburg-Vorpommern">Mecklenburg-Vorpommern</a> in the north, <a href="Poland">Poland</a> in the east, the <a href="Free%20State%20of%20Saxony">Freistaat Sachsen</a> in the south, <a href="Saxony-Anhalt">Saxony-Anhalt</a> in the west, and <a href="Lower%20Saxony">Lower Saxony</a> in the northwest.

The <a href="Oder%20River">Oder River</a> forms a part of the eastern border, the <a href="Elbe">Elbe River</a> a portion of the western border. The main rivers in the state itself are the <a href="Spree">Spree</a> and the <a href="Havel">Havel</a>. In the southeast, there is a wetlands region called the <a href="Spreewald">Spreewald</a>; it is the northernmost part of <a href="Lusatia">Lusatia</a>, where the <a href="Sorbs">Sorbs</a>, a <a href="Slavic%20peoples">Slavic</a> people, still live. These areas are bilingual, i.e., German and <a href="Sorbian%20language">Sorbian</a> are both used.

Brandenburg is known for its well-preserved natural environment and its ambitious natural protection policies which began in the 1990s. 15 large protected areas were designated following <a href="German%20reunification">Germany's reunification</a>. Each of them is provided with state-financed administration and a park ranger staff, who guide visitors and work to ensure nature conservation. Most protected areas have visitor centers.

The majority (79.8%) of Brandenburgers can be defined as non-religious, adherents of non-Christian religions or not adherents of the larger Christian denominations.

17.1% of the Brandenburgers adhere to the local <a href="Evangelical%20Church%20in%20Germany">Evangelical Church in Germany</a> (mostly the <a href="Evangelical%20Church%20in%20Berlin%2C%20Brandenburg%20and%20Silesian%20Upper%20Lusatia">Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia</a>), while 3.1% are <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> (mostly the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Berlin">Archdiocese of Berlin</a>, and a minority in the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20G%C3%B6rlitz">Diocese of Görlitz</a>). 

Brandenburg is divided into 14 rural districts ("Landkreise") and four urban districts ("kreisfreie Städte"), shown with their population in 2011:

The most recent election took place on 14 September 2014. The coalition government formed by the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">Social Democrats</a> and the <a href="The%20Left%20%28Germany%29">Left Party</a> led by <a href="Dietmar%20Woidke">Dietmar Woidke</a> (SPD) was re-elected. The next ordinary state election is scheduled for 2019.

<a href="Berlin%20Sch%C3%B6nefeld%20Airport">Berlin Schönefeld Airport</a> (IATA code:SXF) is the largest airport in Brandenburg. It is the second largest <a href="international%20airport">international airport</a> of the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolitan region and is located southeast of central <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> in <a href="Sch%C3%B6nefeld">Schönefeld</a>. The airport is a base for <a href="Condor%20Flugdienst">Condor</a>, <a href="easyJet">easyJet</a> and <a href="Ryanair">Ryanair</a>. In 2016, SXF handled 11.652.922 Passengers (+36,7%).

It is planned to incorporate Schönefeld's existing infrastructure and terminals into the new <a href="Berlin%20Brandenburg%20Airport">Berlin Brandenburg Airport</a> (BER), which is scheduled to open not before the end of 2017. The new BER will have an initial capacity of 35-40 million passengers a year. Due to increasing air traffic in Berlin and Brandenburg plans for airport expansions are in the making (as of 2017).

In 2016, around 49.000 students were enlisted Brandenburg universities and higher education facilities. The largest institution is the <a href="University%20of%20Potsdam">University of Potsdam</a>, located southwest of <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>.

Bundestag

The Bundestag (, "Federal <a href="diet%20%28assembly%29">Diet</a>") is a constitutional and legislative body at the federal level in <a href="Germany">Germany</a>. For its similar function, it is often described as a <a href="lower%20house">lower house</a> of parliament along the lines of the US House of Representatives and the Canadian or the British House of Commons. The German constitution, however, does not define the Bundestag and the <a href="Bundesrat%20of%20Germany">Bundesrat</a> as the lower and upper houses of a bicameral legislature.

The Bundestag was established by chapter III of the <a href="Basic%20Law%20for%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany">Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany</a> (Constitution) in 1949 as one of the legislative bodies of Germany and thus the historical successor to the earlier <a href="Reichstag%20%28Weimar%20Republic%29">Reichstag</a>.

Since 1999 it has met in the <a href="Reichstag%20Building">Reichstag Building</a> in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. <a href="Norbert%20Lammert">Norbert Lammert</a> is the current <a href="President%20of%20the%20Bundestag">President of the Bundestag</a>. Members of the Bundestag ("Mitglieder des Bundestages") are usually elected every four years by all adult German citizens in a mixed system of constituency voting and list voting. There are currently 631 seats; however, one – belonging to the <a href="Christian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany">CDU</a> – remains vacant. The Election Day, however, can be earlier if the Federal <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany">Chancellor</a> ("Bundeskanzler") loses a <a href="motion%20of%20no%20confidence">vote of no confidence</a> and asks the Federal <a href="President%20of%20Germany">President</a> ("Bundespräsident") to dissolve the Bundestag in order to hold new general elections.

In the 19th century the name Bundestag was the unofficial designation for the assembly of the sovereigns and mayors of the Monarchies and Free Cities which formed the <a href="German%20Confederation">German Confederation</a> (1815–1866). Its seat was in the <a href="Free%20City%20of%20Frankfurt">Free City of Frankfurt</a> on the Main.
With the dissolution of the German Confederation in 1866 and the founding of the <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> (<a href="Deutsches%20Reich">Deutsches Reich</a>) in 1871, the Reichstag was established as the German parliament in Berlin, which was the capital of the then Kingdom of Prussia (the largest and most influential state in both the Confederation and the empire). Two decades later, the current parliament building was erected. The Reichstag delegates were elected by direct and equal male suffrage (and not the <a href="Prussian%20three-class%20franchise">three-class electoral system</a> prevailing in Prussia until 1918). The Reichstag did not participate in the appointment of the Chancellor until the parliamentary reforms of October 1918. After the Revolution of November 1918 and the establishment of the Weimar Constitution, women were given the right to vote for (and serve in) the Reichstag, and the parliament could use the no-confidence vote to force the chancellor or any cabinet member to resign. In March 1933, one month after the <a href="Reichstag%20fire">Reichstag fire</a>, the then president, Paul von Hindenburg, a retired war hero, gave <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> ultimate power through the <a href="Reichstag%20Fire%20Decree">Decree for the Protection of People and State</a> and the <a href="Enabling%20Act%20of%201933">Enabling Act of 1933</a>, although Hitler remained at the post of Federal Government Chancellor (though he called himself the Führer). After this the Reichstag met only rarely, usually at the (Kroll Opera House) following the Reichstag fire starting in 1933 to unanimously rubber-stamp the decisions of the government. It last convened on 26 April 1942.

With the <a href="Basic%20Law%20for%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany">new constitution of 1949</a>, the Bundestag was established as the new (West) German parliament. Because <a href="West%20Berlin">West Berlin</a> was not officially under the jurisdiction of the Constitution, a legacy of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, the Bundestag met in <a href="Bonn">Bonn</a> in several different buildings, including (provisionally) a former water works facility. In addition, owing to the city's <a href="West%20Berlin%23Legal%20status">legal status</a>, citizens of West Berlin were unable to vote in elections to the Bundestag, and were instead represented by 22 non-voting delegates chosen by the <a href="House%20of%20Representatives%20of%20Berlin">House of Representatives</a>, the city's legislature.

The <a href="Bundeshaus%20%28Bonn%29">Bundeshaus in Bonn</a> is the former Parliament Building of Germany. The sessions of the German Bundestag were held there from 1949 until its move to Berlin in 1999. Today it houses the International Congress Centre Bundeshaus Bonn and in the north areas the branch office of the <a href="Bundesrat%20of%20Germany">Bundesrat</a> ("Federal Council", the Upper House of the German Federal Parliament representing the "Länder", i.e. the federated States). The southern areas became part of German offices for the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> in 2008.
The former <a href="Reichstag%20building">Reichstag building</a> housed a history exhibition (Fragen an die deutsche Geschichte) and served occasionally as a conference center. The Reichstag building was also occasionally used as a venue for sittings of the Bundestag and its committees and the <a href="Bundesversammlung%20%28German%20Confederation%29">Bundesversammlung</a> (Federal Assembly), the body which elects the German Federal President. However, the Soviets harshly protested against the use of the Reichstag building by institutions of the Federal Republic of Germany and tried to disturb the sittings by flying supersonic jets close to the building.

Since 1999, the German parliament has again assembled in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> in its original <a href="Reichstag%20%28building%29">Reichstag building</a>, which was built in 1888 based on the plans of German architect Paul Wallot and underwent a significant renovation under the lead of British architect <a href="Sir%20Norman%20Foster">Sir Norman Foster</a>. Parliamentary committees and subcommittees, public hearings and faction meetings take place in three auxiliary buildings, which surround the Reichstag building: the Jakob-Kaiser-Haus, Paul-Löbe-Haus and Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus.

In 2005, a small aircraft crashed close to the German parliament. It was then decided to ban private air traffic over Central Berlin.

Together with the <a href="Bundesrat%20%28Germany%29">Bundesrat</a>, the Bundestag is the <a href="legislative%20branch">legislative branch</a> of the <a href="Politics%20of%20Germany">German political system</a>.

Although most legislation is initiated by the executive branch, the Bundestag considers the legislative function its most important responsibility, concentrating much of its energy on assessing and amending the government's legislative program. The committees (see below) play a prominent role in this process. Plenary sessions provide a forum for members to engage in public debate on legislative issues before them, but they tend to be well attended only when significant legislation is being considered.

The Bundestag members are the only federal officials directly elected by the public; the Bundestag in turn elects the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany%20%28Federal%20Republic%29">Chancellor</a> and, in addition, exercises oversight of the executive branch on issues of both substantive policy and routine administration. This check on executive power can be employed through binding legislation, public debates on government policy, investigations, and direct questioning of the chancellor or cabinet officials. For example, the Bundestag can conduct a question hour "(Fragestunde)," in which a government representative responds to a previously submitted written question from a member. Members can ask related questions during the question hour. The questions can concern anything from a major policy issue to a specific constituent's problem. Use of the question hour has increased markedly over the past forty years, with more than 20,000 questions being posed during the 1987-90 term. Understandably, the opposition parties are active in exercising the parliamentary right to scrutinize government actions.

Constituent service does also take place in the form of the Petition Committee. In 2004, the Petition Committee received over 18,000 complaints from citizens and was able to negotiate a mutually satisfactory solution to more than half of them. In 2005, as a pilot of the potential of <a href="internet%20petition">internet petition</a>s, a version of <a href="e-Petitioner">e-Petitioner</a> was produced for the Bundestag. This was a collaborative project involving The <a href="Scottish%20Parliament">Scottish Parliament</a>, <a href="International%20Teledemocracy%20Centre">International Teledemocracy Centre</a> and the Bundestag ‘Online Services Department’. The system was formally launched on 1 September 2005, and in 2008 the Bundestag moved to a new system based on its evaluation.

The Bundestag is elected for four years, and new elections must be held between 46 and 48 months after the beginning of its electoral term. Unless the Bundestag is dissolved prematurely, its term ends when the next Bundestag convenes, which must occur within 30 days of the election.
Prior to 1976, there could be a period where one Bundestag had been dissolved and the next Bundestag could not be convened; during this period, the rights of the Bundestag were exercised by a so-called "Permanent Committee".

Members serve four-year terms, with elections held every four years, or earlier in the relatively rare case that the Bundestag is dissolved prematurely by the <a href="President%20of%20Germany">president</a>. The Bundestag can be dissolved by the president on the recommendation of the chancellor if the latter has lost a vote of confidence in the Bundestag, if the recommendation is made and accepted before the Bundestag acts to elect a new Chancellor. This has happened three times: 1972 under Chancellor <a href="Willy%20Brandt">Willy Brandt</a>, 1983 under Chancellor <a href="Helmut%20Kohl">Helmut Kohl</a> and 2005 under Chancellor <a href="Gerhard%20Schr%C3%B6der">Gerhard Schröder</a>. The procedures for these situations are governed by Articles 67 and 68 of the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Law regarding the election procedure itself is the Federal Election Act 1956 (Bundeswahlgesetz/BWahlG)

All candidates must be at least eighteen years old; there are no term limits. The election uses the <a href="Mixed%20member%20proportional%20representation">MMP electoral system</a>. In addition, the Bundestag has a minimum threshold of either 5% of the national party vote or three (directly elected) constituency representatives for a <a href="political%20party">party</a> to gain additional representation through the system of proportional representation. Thus, small minority parties cannot easily enter the Bundestag and prevent the formation of stable majority governments as they could under the Weimar constitution.

The most recent election, the <a href="German%20federal%20election%2C%202017">German federal election, 2017</a>, was held on 24 September 2017.

Half of the Members of the Bundestag are elected directly from 299 constituencies (<a href="first-past-the-post%20system">first-past-the-post system</a>), the other half are elected from the parties’ Land lists in such a way as to achieve <a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a> for the total Bundestag (if possible).

Accordingly, each voter has two votes in the elections to the Bundestag. The first vote, allowing voters to elect their local representatives to the Bundestag, decides which candidates are sent to Parliament from the constituencies.

The second vote is cast for a party list; it determines the relative strengths of the parties represented in the Bundestag.

At least 598 Members of the Bundestag are elected in this way. Parties that gain more than 5% of the second votes or win at least 3 direct mandates are allocated seats in the Bundestag in proportion to the number of votes it has received (<a href="d%27Hondt%20method">d'Hondt method</a> until 1987, <a href="largest%20remainder%20method">largest remainder method</a> until the 2005 election, now <a href="Sainte-Lagu%C3%AB%20method">Sainte-Laguë method</a>).

In addition to this, there are certain circumstances in which some candidates win what are known as <a href="overhang%20seat">overhang seat</a>s when the seats are being distributed. If a party has gained more direct mandates in a Land than it is entitled to according to the results of the second vote, it does not forfeit these mandates because all directly elected candidates are guaranteed a seat in the Bundestag. The other parties are then compensated by getting additional seats as well, the "balance seats", so proportionality is preserved.

The most important organisational structures within the Bundestag are <a href="fraction%20%28politics%29">parliamentary groups</a> ("Fraktionen"; sing. "Fraktion"), which are traditionally formed by political parties represented in the chamber which incorporate more than 5% of the Bundestag legislators; <a href="Christian%20Democratic%20Union%20of%20Germany">CDU</a> and <a href="Christian%20Social%20Union%20of%20Bavaria">CSU</a> have always formed a single united "Fraktion". The size of a party's "Fraktion" determines the extent of its representation on legislative committees, the time slots allotted for speaking, the number of committee chairs it can hold, and its representation in executive bodies of the Bundestag. The "Fraktionen," not the members, receive the bulk of government funding for legislative and administrative activities.

The leadership of each "Fraktion" consists of a parliamentary party leader, several deputy leaders, and an executive committee. The leadership's major responsibilities are to represent the "Fraktion," enforce party discipline, and orchestrate the party's parliamentary activities. The members of each "Fraktion" are distributed among <a href="working%20group">working group</a>s focused on specific policy-related topics such as social policy, economics, and foreign policy. The "Fraktion" meets every Tuesday afternoon in the weeks in which the Bundestag is in session to consider legislation before the Bundestag and formulate the party's position on it.

Parties which do not fulfill the criterion for being a "Fraktion" but have at least three seats by direct elections (i.e. which have at least three MPs representing a certain electoral district) in the Bundestag can be granted the status of a "group" of the Bundestag. This applied to the <a href="Left%20Party%20%28Germany%29">Party of Democratic Socialism</a> (PDS) from 1990-1998. This status entails some privileges which are in general less than those of a "Fraktion". In the current Bundestag, there are no such groups (the PDS had only two MPs in parliament until 2005 and could thus not even considered a group anymore; the party—now <a href="The%20Left%20%28Germany%29">The Left</a>—has now returned to the Bundestag with full "Fraktion" status).

The Bundestag's executive bodies include the <a href="Council%20of%20Elders%20of%20the%20Bundestag%20%28Germany%29">Council of Elders</a> and the <a href="Presidium%20of%20the%20Bundestag">Presidium</a>. The council consists of the Bundestag leadership, together with the most senior representatives of each "fraktion", with the number of these representatives tied to the strength of the Parliamentary groups in the chamber. The council is the coordination hub, determining the daily legislative agenda and assigning committee chairpersons based on Parliamentary group representation. The council also serves as an important forum for interparty negotiations on specific legislation and procedural issues. The Presidium is responsible for the routine administration of the Bundestag, including its clerical and research activities. It consists of the chamber's president (usually elected from the largest "fraktion") and vice presidents (one from each "fraktion").

Most of the legislative work in the Bundestag is the product of standing committees, which exist largely unchanged throughout one legislative period. The number of committees approximates the number of federal ministries, and the titles of each are roughly similar (e.g., defense, agriculture, and labor). There are, as of the current eighteenth Bundestag, 23 standing committees. The distribution of committee chairs and the membership of each committee reflect the relative strength of the various Parliamentary groups in the chamber. In the current eighteenth Bundestag, the <a href="CDU/CSU">CDU/CSU</a> chaired twelve committees, the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20of%20Germany">SPD</a> seven, <a href="The%20Left%20%28Germany%29">The Left</a> (Die Linke) two, and the <a href="Alliance%2090%27/Greens">Greens</a> (Bündnis 90/Die Grünen), two. Members of the opposition party can chair a significant number of standing committees (e.g. The budget committee is always chaired by the biggest opposition party). These committees have either a small staff or no staff at all.

As is the case with some other parliaments, the Bundestag is subject to the "principle of discontinuation", meaning that a newly elect Bundestag is legally regarded to be a body and entity completely different from the previous Bundestag. This leads to the result, that any motion, application or action submitted to the previous Bundestag, e.g. a bill referred to the Bundestag by the Federal Government, is regarded as void by non-decision (German terminology: ""Die Sache fällt der Diskontinuität anheim""). Thus any bill that has not been decided upon by the beginning of the new electoral period must be brought up by the government again, if it aims to uphold the motion, this procedure in effect delaying the passage of the bill. Furthermore, any newly elected Bundestag will have to freshly decide on the rules of procedure ("Geschäftsordnung"), which is done by a formal decision of taking over such rules from the preceding "Bundestag" by reference.

Any Bundestag is considered dissolved only once a newly elected Bundestag has actually gathered in order to constitute itself (Article 39 sec. 1 sentence 2 of the Basic Law), which has to happen within 30 days of its election (Article 39 sec. 2 of the Basic Law). Thus, it may happen (and has happened) that the old Bundestag gathers and makes decisions even after the election of a new Bundestag that has not gathered in order to constitute itself. For example, elections to the 16th Bundestag took place on 18 September 2005, but the 15th Bundestag still convened after election day to make some decisions on German military engagement abroad, and was entitled to do so, as the newly elected 16th Bundestag did not convene for the first time until 18 October 2005.

BMW AG is a Germany-based company which currently produces <a href="automobile">automobile</a>s and <a href="motorcycle">motorcycle</a>s, and produced aircraft engines until 1945.

The company was founded in 1916 and has its headquarters in <a href="Munich">Munich</a>, <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>. BMW produces motor vehicles in Germany, Brazil, China, India, South Africa and the United States. In 2015, BMW was the world's twelfth largest producer of motor vehicles, with 2,279,503 vehicles produced. The Quandt family are long-term shareholders of the company, with the remaining stocks owned by <a href="public%20float">public float</a>.

Automobiles are marketed under the brands <a href="list%20of%20BMW%20vehicles%23cars">BMW</a> (with sub-brands <a href="BMW%20M">BMW M</a> for performance models and <a href="BMW%20i">BMW i</a> for plug-in electric cars), <a href="Mini%20%28marque%29">Mini</a> and <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Motor%20Cars">Rolls-Royce</a>. Motorcycles are marketed under the brand <a href="BMW%20Motorrad">BMW Motorrad</a>.

The company has significant motorsport history, especially in <a href="touring%20car%20racing">touring cars</a>, <a href="Formula%201">Formula 1</a>, <a href="sports%20car%20racing">sports cars</a> and the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man%20TT">Isle of Man TT</a>.

"BMW AG" is an abbreviation for the German name "Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft" (). "Bayerische Motoren Werke" translates into English as "Bavarian Motor Works", while <a href="Aktiengesellschaft">Aktiengesellschaft</a> signifies it is a corporation owned by shareholders.

BMW's origins can be traced back to three separate German companies: Rapp Motorenwerke, Bayerische Flugzeugwerke and Automobilwerk Eisenach. The history of the name itself begins with <a href="Rapp%20Motorenwerke">Rapp Motorenwerke</a>, an aircraft engine manufacturer. In April 1917, following the departure of the founder Karl Friedrich Rapp, the company was renamed Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW).. BMW's first product was the <a href="BMW%20IIIa">BMW IIIa</a> aircraft engine. The IIIa engine was known for good fuel economy and high-altitude performance. The resulting orders for IIIa engines from the German military caused rapid expansion for BMW.

After the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> in 1918, BMW was forced to cease aircraft-engine production by the terms of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Versailles Armistice Treaty</a>. To maintain in business, BMW produced farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. In 1922, former major shareholder <a href="Camillo%20Castiglioni">Camillo Castiglioni</a> purchased the rights to the name BMW, which led to the company descended from Rapp Motorenwerke being renamed Süddeutsche Bremse AG (known today as <a href="Knorr-Bremse">Knorr-Bremse</a>). Castiglioni was also an investor in another aircraft company, called "Bayerische Flugzeugwerke", which he renamed BMW. The disused factory of Bayerische Flugzeugwerke was re-opened to produce engines for busses, trucks, farm equipment and pumps, under the brand name BMW. BMW's corporate history considers the founding date of Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (7 March 1916) to be the birth of the company.

As the restrictions of the Armistice Treaty began to be lifted, BMW began production of motorcycles in 1923, with the <a href="BMW%20R32">R32</a> model.

BMW's production of automobiles began in 1928, when the company purchased the <a href="Automobilwerk%20Eisenach">Automobilwerk Eisenach</a> car company. Automobilwerk Eisenach's current model was the <a href="BMW%20Dixi">Dixi 3/15</a>, a licensed copy of the <a href="Austin%207">Austin 7</a> which had begun production in 1927. Following the takeover, the Dixi 3/15 became the <a href="BMW%203/15">BMW 3/15</a>, BMW's first production car.

In 1920, the <a href="BMW%203/20">BMW 3/20</a> became the first BMW automobile designed entirely by BMW. It was powered by a four-cylinder engine, which BMW designed based on the Austin 7 engine.

BMW's first automotive <a href="straight-six%20engine">straight-six engine</a> was released in 1933, in the <a href="BMW%20303">BMW 303</a>. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded its model range to include sedans, coupes, convertibles and sports cars.

With German rearmament in the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>. The factory in Munich made ample use of forced labour: foreign civilians, prisoners of war and inmates of the concentration camp Dachau <a href="http%3A//www.ausstellung-zwangsarbeit.org/en/285/"></a>. Among its successful World War II engine designs were the <a href="BMW%20132">BMW 132</a> and <a href="BMW%20801">BMW 801</a> air-cooled <a href="radial%20engines">radial engines</a>, and the pioneering <a href="BMW%20003">BMW 003</a> <a href="axial%20compressor">axial-flow</a> <a href="turbojet">turbojet</a>, which powered the tiny, 1944–1945–era jet-powered "emergency fighter", the <a href="Heinkel%20He%20162">Heinkel He 162</a> "Spatz". The BMW 003 jet engine was first tested as a prime power plant in the first prototype of the <a href="Messerschmitt%20Me%20262">Messerschmitt Me 262</a>, the Me 262 V1, but in 1942 tests the BMW prototype engines failed on takeoff with only the standby <a href="Junkers%20Jumo%20210">Junkers Jumo 210</a> nose-mounted piston engine powering it to a safe landing. The few Me 262 A-1b test examples built used the more developed version of the 003 jet, recording an official top speed of 800 km/h (497 mph). The first-ever four-engine jet aircraft ever flown were the sixth and eighth prototypes of the <a href="Arado%20Ar%20234%23Ar%20234A">Arado Ar 234</a> jet reconnaissance-bomber, which used BMW 003 jets for power. Through 1944 the 003's reliability improved, making it a suitable power plant for air frame designs competing for the <a href="Emergency%20Fighter%20Program">"Jägernotprogramm"</a>'s <a href="light%20fighter">light fighter</a> production contract. which was won by the Heinkel He 162 "Spatz" design. The BMW 003 aviation turbojet was also under consideration as the basic starting point for a pioneering <a href="turboshaft">turboshaft</a> powerplant for German armored fighting vehicles in 1944–45, as the <a href="GT%20101">GT 101</a>. Towards the end of the Third Reich, BMW developed some military aircraft projects for the "Luftwaffe", the BMW Strahlbomber, the BMW Schnellbomber and the BMW Strahljäger, but none of them were built.

During World War II, many BMW production facilities had been heavily bombed. BMW's facilities in <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a> were seized by the Soviet Government and the remaining facilities were banned by the Allies from producing motorcycles or automobiles. During this ban, BMW used basic secondhand and salvaged equipment to make pots and pans, later expanding to other kitchen supplies and bicycles.

In 1947, BMW was granted permission to resume motorcycle production and its first post-war motorcycle - the <a href="History%20of%20BMW%20motorcycles%231945%E2%80%931955">R24</a> - was released in 1948. BMW was still forbidden from producing automobiles, however the Bristol Aeroplane Company (BAC) was producing cars in England based on BMW's pre-war models, using plans that BAC had taken from BMW's German offices. 

Production of automobiles resumed in 1952, with the <a href="BMW%20501">BMW 501</a> large sedan. Throughout the 1950s, BMW expanded their model range with sedans, coupes, convertibles and sports cars. In 1954, the <a href="BMW%20502">BMW 502</a> was BMW's first to use a V8 engine. To provide an affordable model, BMW began production of the <a href="Isetta">Isetta</a> micro-car (under licence from <a href="Iso%20%28automobile%29">Iso</a>) in 1955. Two years later, the four-seat <a href="BMW%20600">BMW 600</a> was based on a lengthened version of the Isetta design. In 1959, the BMW 600 was replaced by the larger <a href="BMW%20700">BMW 700</a> coupe/sedan.

By 1959, BMW was in debt and losing money. The Isetta was selling well but with small profit margins. Their 501-based luxury sedans were not selling well enough to be profitable and were becoming increasingly outdated. Their 503 coupé and 507 roadster were too expensive to be profitable. Their <a href="BMW%20600">600</a>, a four-seater based on the Isetta, was selling poorly. The motorcycle market imploded in the mid-1950s with increased affluence turning Germans away from motorcycles and toward cars. BMW had sold their Allach plant to <a href="MAN%20SE">MAN</a> in 1954. <a href="American%20Motors">American Motors</a> and the <a href="Rootes%20Group">Rootes Group</a> had both tried to acquire BMW.

At BMW's <a href="annual%20general%20meeting">annual general meeting</a> on 9 December 1959, Dr. Hans Feith, chairman of BMW's <a href="supervisory%20board">supervisory board</a>, proposed a merger with <a href="Daimler-Benz">Daimler-Benz</a>. The dealers and small shareholders opposed this suggestion and rallied around a counter-proposal by Dr. Friedrich Mathern, which gained enough support to stop the merger. At that time, the Quandt Group, led by half-brothers <a href="Herbert%20Quandt">Herbert</a> and <a href="Harald%20Quandt">Harald Quandt</a>, had recently increased their holdings in BMW and had become their largest shareholder. In 1960, the development program began for a new range of models, called the "Neue Klasse" (New Class) project. The resulting <a href="BMW%20New%20Class">New Class</a> four-door sedans, introduced in 1962, are credited for saving the company financially and establishing BMW's identity as a producer of leading sports sedans.

In 1965, the New Class range was expanded with the <a href="BMW%20New%20Class%23New%20Class%20Coup%C3%A9s">2000 C and 2000 CS</a> luxury coupes. The range was further expanded in 1966 with the iconic <a href="BMW%2002%20Series">BMW 02 Series</a> compact coupes.

BMW acquired the <a href="Hans%20Glas">Hans Glas</a> company based in <a href="Dingolfing">Dingolfing</a>, Germany, in 1966. Glas vehicles were briefly badged as BMW until the company was fully absorbed. It was reputed that the acquisition was mainly to gain access to Glas' development of the timing belt with an overhead camshaft in automotive applications, although some saw Glas' Dingolfing plant as another incentive. However, this factory was outmoded and BMW's biggest immediate gain was, according to themselves, a stock of highly qualified engineers and other personnel. The Glas factories continued to build a limited number of their existing models, while adding the manufacture of BMW front and rear axles until they could be closer incorporated into BMW.

In 1968, BMW began production of its first <a href="straight-six%20engine">straight-six engine</a> since World War II. This engine coincided with the launch of the <a href="BMW%20E3">New Six</a> large sedans (the predecessor to the <a href="BMW%207%20Series">7 Series</a>) and <a href="BMW%20E9">New Six CS</a> large coupes (the predecessor to the <a href="BMW%206%20Series">6 Series</a>).

The first <a href="BMW%205%20Series">5 Series</a> range of mid-size sedans were introduced in 1972, to replace the New Class sedans. The 5 Series platform was also used for the <a href="BMW%206%20Series">6 Series</a> coupes, which were introduced in 1976. In 1975, the first model of the iconic <a href="BMW%203%20Series">3 Series</a> range of compact sedans/coupes was introduced. The <a href="BMW%207%20Series">7 Series</a> large sedans were introduced in 1978.

In 1992, BMW acquired a large stake in California-based <a href="industrial%20design">industrial design</a> studio <a href="DesignworksUSA">DesignworksUSA</a>, which they fully acquired in 1995. In 1994, BMW bought the British <a href="Rover%20Group">Rover Group</a> (which at the time consisted of the <a href="Rover%20%28car%29">Rover</a>, <a href="Land%20Rover">Land Rover</a>,<a href="Mini">Mini</a> and <a href="MG%20%28car%29">MG</a> brands as well as the rights to defunct brands including <a href="Austin%20Motor%20Company">Austin</a> and <a href="Morris%20Motors">Morris</a>), and owned it for six years. By 2000, Rover was incurring huge losses and BMW decided to sell the combine. The MG and Rover brands were sold to the Phoenix Consortium to form <a href="MG%20Rover">MG Rover</a>, while Land Rover was taken over by <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a>. BMW, meanwhile, retained the rights to build the new <a href="BMW%20Mini">Mini</a>, which was launched in 2001.

Chief designer <a href="Chris%20Bangle">Chris Bangle</a> announced his departure from BMW in February 2009, after serving on the design team for nearly seventeen years. He was replaced by <a href="Adrian%20van%20Hooydonk">Adrian van Hooydonk</a>, Bangle's former right-hand man. Bangle was known for his radical designs such as the 2002 7 Series and the 2002 Z4. In July 2007, the production rights for <a href="Husqvarna%20Motorcycles">Husqvarna Motorcycles</a> was purchased by BMW for a reported 93 million euros. <a href="BMW%20Motorrad">BMW Motorrad</a> plans to continue operating Husqvarna Motorcycles as a separate enterprise. All development, sales and production activities, as well as the current workforce, have remained in place at its present location at Varese.

In June 2012, BMW was listed as the #1 most reputable company in the world by Forbes.com. Rankings are based upon aspects such as "people's willingness to buy, recommend, work for, and invest in a company is driven 60% by their perceptions of the company and only 40% by their perceptions of their products."

BMW produces complete automobile at its factories in Germany (<a href="Munich">Munich</a>, <a href="Dingolfing">Dingolfing</a>, <a href="Regensburg">Regensburg</a> and <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>), United States (<a href="Greer%2C%20South%20Carolina">Greer</a>), South Africa (<a href="Rosslyn%2C%20Gauteng">Rosslyn</a>) and China (<a href="Shenyang">Shenyang</a>). BMW also has local assembly operation using complete <a href="Knock-down%20kit">knock down components</a> in Thailand, Russia, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, and India, for 3, 5, 7 series and X3.

In 2006, the BMW group (including Mini and Rolls-Royce) produced 1,366,838 four-wheeled vehicles, which were manufactured in five countries. In 2010, it manufactured 1,481,253 four-wheeled vehicles and 112,271 motorcycles (under both the BMW and Husqvarna brands).

By 2011, about 56% of BMW-brand vehicles produced are powered by petrol engines and the remaining 44% are powered by diesel engines. Of those petrol vehicles, about 27% are four-cylinder models and about nine percent are eight-cylinder models. On average, 9,000 vehicles per day exit BMW plants, and 63% are <a href="rail%20freight">transported by rail</a>.

Annual production since 2005 is as follows:

In China, BMW sold 415,200 vehicles between January and November 2014, through a network of over 440 BMW stores and 100 Mini stores.

BMW began production of motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after World War I. Its motorcycle brand is now known as <a href="BMW%20Motorrad">BMW Motorrad</a>. Their first successful motorcycle after the failed Helios and Flink, was the "<a href="BMW%20R32">R32</a>" in 1923, though production originally began in 1921. This had a "<a href="Flat-twin%20engine">boxer</a>" twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the <a href="History%20of%20BMW%20motorcycles%23R%20series">R Series</a>.

During the Second World War, BMW produced the <a href="BMW%20R75">BMW R75</a> motorcycle with a <a href="sidecar">sidecar</a> attached. Having a unique design copied from the <a href="Z%C3%BCndapp">Zündapp</a> KS750, its sidecar wheel was also motor-driven. Combined with a lockable <a href="differential%20%28mechanics%29">differential</a>, this made the vehicle very capable off-road, an equivalent in many ways to the <a href="Willys%20MB">Jeep</a>.

In 1982, came the <a href="BMW%20K1200S">K Series</a>, shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven <a href="History%20of%20BMW%20motorcycles%23F%20series">F</a> and <a href="History%20of%20BMW%20motorcycles%23G%20series">G</a> series with single and parallel twin <a href="Rotax">Rotax</a> engines.

In the early 1990s, BMW updated the <a href="airhead%20%28motorcycle%29">airhead</a> Boxer engine which became known as the <a href="oilhead">oilhead</a>. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170 cc and enhanced performance to for the <a href="BMW%20R1200GS">R1200GS</a>, compared to of the previous <a href="BMW%20R1150GS">R1150GS</a>. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing , respectively.

In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing , derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.

BMW introduced <a href="anti-lock%20braking%20system">anti-lock brakes</a> on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles pave the way for the introduction of <a href="electronic%20stability%20control">electronic stability control</a>, or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.

BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an <a href="Earles%20fork">Earles fork</a>, front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called <a href="swinging%20arm">swinging arm</a>).
Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.

BMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.

The <a href="BMW%20i">BMW i</a> is a sub-brand of BMW founded in 2011 to design and manufacture <a href="plug-in%20electric%20vehicle">plug-in electric vehicle</a>s. The sub-brand initial plans called for the release of two vehicles; <a href="series%20production">series production</a> of the <a href="BMW%20i3">BMW i3</a> all-electric car began in September 2013, and the market launch took place in November 2013 with the first retail deliveries in Germany. The <a href="BMW%20i8">BMW i8</a> sports <a href="plug-in%20hybrid">plug-in hybrid</a> car was launched in Germany in June 2014. Combined sales of the BMW i brand models reached the 50,000 unit milestone in January 2016. Two years after its introduction, the <a href="BMW%20i3">BMW i3</a> ranked as the world's third best selling all-electric car in history. Global sales of the BMW i3 achieved the 50,000 unit milestone in July 2016.

In February 2016, BMW announced the introduction of the "iPerformance" model designation, which will be given to all BMW <a href="plug-in%20hybrid">plug-in hybrid</a> vehicles from July 2016. The aim is to provide a visible indicator of the transfer of technology from <a href="BMW%20i">BMW i</a> to the BMW core brand. The new designation will be used first on the plug-in hybrid variants of the latest <a href="BMW%207%20Series">BMW 7 Series</a>. Global sales of all BMW plug-in electrified models achieved the 100,000 unit milestone in early November 2016, consisting of more than 60,000 BMW i3s, over 10,000 BMW i8s, and about 30,000 from combined sales of all BMW iPerformance plug-in hybrid models.

, four BMW electrified models have been released, the <a href="BMW%20X5%20xDrive40e%20iPerformance">BMW X5 xDrive40e iPerformance</a>, <a href="BMW%20225xe%20iPerformance%20Active%20Tourer">BMW 225xe iPerformance Active Tourer</a>, <a href="BMW%20330e%20iPerformance">BMW 330e iPerformance</a>, and the <a href="BMW%20740e%20iPerformance">BMW 740e iPerformance</a>. The <a href="BMW%20530e%20iPerformance">BMW 530e iPerformance</a> is scheduled to be released in Europe March 2017 as part of the upcoming seventh generation <a href="BMW%205%20Series%20%28G30%29">BMW 5 Series</a> lineup. In November 2016, BMW announced the company expected to deliver 60,000 of its electrified i and iPerformance models in 2016, and a sales target of 100,000 units for 2017. BMW set the goal to expand the share of its electrified models to between 15% and 25% of sales by 2025, when batteries have doubled their capacity.

In 2015, BMW in cooperation with <a href="https%3A//www.scherm.com/en/">SCHERM Group</a> has started deploying electric trucks on European roads, making it the first company to ever do so. The truck itself is manufactured by the <a href="http%3A//www.terberggroup.com/en/">Terberg Group</a>, one of the world's largest independent specialist vehicle suppliers.

BMW produce a number of high-performance derivatives of their cars developed by their <a href="BMW%20M">BMW M GmbH</a> (previously BMW Motorsport GmbH) subsidiary.

The current M models are:

In July 2009, BMW announced that it would withdraw from Formula One at the end of the 2009 season. The team was sold back to the previous owner, Peter Sauber, who kept the BMW part of the name for the 2010 season due to issues with the <a href="Concorde%20Agreement">Concorde Agreement</a>. The team has since dropped BMW from their name starting in 2011.


BMW has a long and successful history in <a href="touring%20car%20racing">touring car racing</a>.

BMW announced on 15 October 2010 that it will return to <a href="touring%20car%20racing">touring car racing</a> during the 2012 season. Dr. Klaus Draeger, director of research and development of the BMW Group, who was in charge of the return to DTM racing (<a href="Deutsche%20Tourenwagen%20Masters">Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters</a>), commented that "The return of BMW to the DTM is a fundamental part of the restructuring of our motorsport activities. With its increased commitment to production car racing, BMW is returning to its roots. The race track is the perfect place to demonstrate the impressive sporting characteristics of our vehicles against our core competitors in a high-powered environment. The DTM is the ideal stage on which to do this."


BMW has signed deals to license Toyota technology in the areas of diesel engines, lithium batteries, and hydrogen fuel cells.

BMW ConnectedDrive provides services and apps controlled through the vehicle's on-board computer. BMW announced the rollout of additional ConnectedDrive functions based around telecommunications in 2014. The new services and apps were made available to Australian delivered cars built during the April/March period.

The ConnectedDrive update introduced real-time traffic data, concierge and a new emergency call system to work alongside BMW's existing driver assistance services.

In 2015, BMW Australia launched a customer portal that included integrated access to the new services and apps.

In <a href="association%20football">football</a>, BMW sponsors <a href="Fu%C3%9Fball-Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> club <a href="Eintracht%20Frankfurt">Eintracht Frankfurt</a>.

It was an official sponsor of the <a href="London%202012">London 2012</a> olympics providing 4000 BMWs and Minis in a deal made in November 2009. The company also made a six-year sponsorship deal with the <a href="United%20States%20Olympic%20Committee">United States Olympic Committee</a> (USOC) in July 2010.

BMW has sponsored various European golf events such as the <a href="PGA%20Championship">PGA Championship</a> at Wentworth, the <a href="BMW%20Italian%20Open">BMW Italian Open</a> and the <a href="BMW%20International%20Open">BMW International Open</a> in Germany.

In 2012, BMW Australia announced a 2-year sponsorship agreement with the <a href="AACTA%20Awards">Australian Film Institute's Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA) Awards</a>. As part of the agreement, BMW supplied a fleet of vehicles renowned for appearing in feature films. The vehicles supplied included a range of elegant BMW limousines, iconic BMW's of the past and the <a href="BMW%206%20Series">BMW 6 Series</a> which featured in . The automotive company also sponsored the South African national Rugby team. The sponsorship was cancelled due to controversies on the Rugby team's part.

In football BMW currently sponsors <a href="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> club <a href="Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a> after <a href="Volkswagen">Volkswagen</a> elected to discontinue <a href="Schalke%2004">Schalke 04</a>'s automotive partner due to dieselgate case.

The company is a charter member of the <a href="U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>'s (EPA) National Environmental Achievement Track, which recognizes companies for their environmental stewardship and performance. It is also a member of the South Carolina Environmental Excellence Program.

In 2012, BMW was named the world's most sustainable automotive company for the eighth consecutive year by the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes. The BMW Group is the only automotive enterprise in the index since its inception in 1999. In 2001, the BMW Group committed itself to the United Nations Environment Programme, the UN Global Compact and the Cleaner Production Declaration. It was also the first company in the automotive industry to appoint an environmental officer, in 1973. BMW is a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.

BMW is industry leader in the Carbon Disclosure Project's Global 500 ranking and 3rd place in Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index across all industries.
BMW is listed in the FTSE4GoodIndex.
The BMW Group was rated the most sustainable DAX 30 company by Sustainalytics in 2012.

BMW has taken measures to reduce the impact the company has on the environment. It is trying to design less-polluting cars by making existing models more efficient, as well as developing environmentally friendly fuels for future vehicles. Possibilities include: electric power, hybrid power (combustion engines and electric motors) hydrogen engines.

BMW offers 49 models with EU5/6 emissions norm and nearly 20 models with CO2 output less than 140 g/km, which puts it on the lowest tax group and therefore could provide the future owner with eco-bonus offered from some European countries.

However, there have been some criticisms directed at BMW, and in particular, accusations of <a href="greenwash">greenwash</a> in reference to their BMW Hydrogen 7. Some critics claim that the emissions produced during <a href="hydrogen%20fuel">hydrogen fuel</a> production outweigh the reduction of tailpipe emissions, and that the Hydrogen 7 is a distraction from more immediate, practical solutions for car pollution. The BBC's <a href="Jorn%20Madslien">Jorn Madslien</a> questioned whether the Hydrogen 7 was "a truly green initiative or merely a cynical marketing ploy"

BMW has created a range of high-end bicycles sold online and through dealerships. They range from the Kid's Bike to the EUR 4,499 Enduro Bike. In the United States, only the Cruise Bike and Kid's Bike models are sold.

BMW vehicles follow a certain <a href="nomenclature">nomenclature</a>; usually a 3 digit number is followed by 1 or 2 letters. The first number represents the series number. The next two numbers traditionally represent the <a href="engine%20displacement">engine displacement</a> in cubic centimeters divided by 100. However, more recent cars use those two numbers as a performance index, as e.g. the 116i, 118i and 120i (all 2,0L petrol-powered), just like the 325d and 330d (both 3,0L diesel) share the same motor block while adjusting engine power through setup and turbocharging. A <a href="History%20of%20BMW%20motorcycles%23Model%20designation">similar nomenclature</a> is used by <a href="BMW%20Motorrad">BMW Motorrad</a> for their motorcycles.

The system of letters can be used in combination, and is as follows:

For example, the BMW 750iL is a fuel-injected 7 Series with a long wheelbase and 5.4 litres of displacement. This badge was used for successive generations, E65 and F01, except the "i" and "L" switched places, so it read "Li" instead of "iL".

When 'L' supersedes the series number (e.g. L6, L7, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as a special luxury variant, having extended leather and special interior appointments. The L7 is based on the E23 and E38, and the L6 is based on the E24.

When 'X' is capitalised and supersedes the series number (e.g. X3, X5, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as one of BMW's Sports Activity Vehicles (SAV), their brand of <a href="Crossover%20%28automobile%29">crossovers</a>, with <a href="BMW%20xDrive">BMW's xDrive</a>. The second number in the 'X' series denotes the platform that it is based upon, for instance the X5 is derived from the 5 Series. Unlike BMW cars, the SAV's main badge does not denote engine size; the engine is instead indicated on side badges.

The 'Z' identifies the vehicle as a two-seat roadster (e.g. Z1, Z3, Z4, etc.). 'M' variants of 'Z' models have the 'M' as a suffix or prefix, depending on country of sale (e.g. 'Z4 M' is 'M Roadster' in Canada).

Previous X & Z vehicles had 'i' or 'si' following the engine displacement number (denoted in litres). BMW is now globally standardising this nomenclature on X & Z vehicles by using 'sDrive' or 'xDrive' (simply meaning rear or all-wheel drive, respectively) followed by two numbers which vaguely represent the vehicle's engine (e.g. Z4 sDrive35i is a rear-wheel-drive Z4 roadster with a 3.0 L twin-turbo fuel-injected engine).

BMW last used the 's' for the E36 328is, which ceased production in 1999. However, the 's' nomenclature was brought back on the 2011 model year BMW 335is and BMW Z4 sDrive35is. The 335is is a sport-tuned trim with more performance and an optional <a href="dual%20clutch%20transmission">dual clutch transmission</a> that slots between the regular 335i and top-of-the-line <a href="BMW%20M3">M3</a>.

The 'M' – for <a href="BMW%20M">Motorsport</a> – identifies the vehicle as a high-performance model of a particular series (e.g. M3, M5, M6, etc.). For example, the M6 is the highest performing vehicle in the 6 Series lineup. Although 'M' cars should be separated into their respective series platforms, it is very common to see 'M' cars grouped together as its own lineup on the official BMW website.

There are exceptions to the numbering nomenclature.

The M version of the <a href="BMW%201%20Series">BMW 1 Series</a> was named the <a href="BMW%201%20Series%20M%20Coupe">BMW 1 Series M Coupe</a> rather than the traditional style "M1" due to the possible confusion with BMW's former <a href="BMW%20M1">BMW M1</a> homologation sports car.

The M versions of the Sports Activity Vehicles, such as the <a href="BMW%20X5%20M">X5 M</a>, could not follow the regular naming convention since MX5 was used for <a href="Mazda">Mazda</a>'s <a href="Mazda%20MX-5">MX-5 Miata</a>.

For instance in the 2008 model year, the BMW 125i/128i, 328i, and 528i all had 3.0 naturally aspirated engines (<a href="BMW%20N52">N52</a>), not a 2,500 cc or 2,800 cc engine as the series designation number would lead one to believe. The '28' is to denote a detuned engine in the 2008 cars, compared to the 2006 model year '30' vehicles (330i and 530i) whose 3.0 naturally aspirated engines are from the same N52 family but had more output.

The 2008 BMW 335i and 535i also have 3.0-litre engine; however the engines are <a href="turbocharger">twin-turbocharged</a> (<a href="BMW%20N54">N54</a>) which is not identified by the nomenclature. Nonetheless the '35' indicates a more powerful engine than previous '30' models that have the <a href="BMW%20N52">naturally aspirated N52 engine</a>. The 2011 BMW 740i and 335is shares the same twin-turbo 3.0 engine from the N54 family but tuned to higher outputs, although the badging is not consistent ('40' and 's'). The 2013 BMW 640i Gran Coupe's twin-scroll single turbo 3.0L inline-6 engine makes similar output to the older twin turbo inline-6 engines.

The E36 and E46 323i and E39 523i had 2.5-litre engines. The E36 318is made after 1996 has a 1.9 L engine (<a href="BMW%20M44">M44</a>) as opposed to the 1.8 L (<a href="BMW%20M42">M42</a>) used in the 1992 to 1995 models. The E36 316i "Contour" manufactured between 1999 and 2000 could be fitted with the 1.9 L M43B19 (<a href="BMW%20M43">M43</a>). The E39 540i had a 4.4 L <a href="BMW%20M62">M62</a> engine, instead of a 4.0 L as the designation would suggest.

The badging for recent V8 engines (<a href="BMW%20N62">N62</a> and <a href="BMW%20N63">N63</a>) also does not indicate displacement, as the 2006 750i and 2009 750i have 4800 cc (naturally aspirated) and 4400 cc (twin-turbocharged) engines, respectively.

In BMW CSL models (for example <a href="BMW%20M3%20CSL">BMW M3 CSL</a>), the letter L stands for Leichtbau (German for lightweight) instead of Lang (German for long wheelbase).

In June 2011, BMW and Sixt launched <a href="Drivenow">Drivenow</a>, a joint-venture that provides carsharing services in several cities in Europe and North America. As of December 2012, DriveNow operates over 1,000 vehicles, which serve five cities worldwide and over 60,000 customers.

BMW has expanded its DriveNow car-sharing service in Seattle, rebranded as ReachNow.

BMW has developed <a href="street%20light">street light</a>s equipped with sockets to charge <a href="electric%20car">electric car</a>s, called <a href="Light%20and%20Charge">Light and Charge</a>.

From the summer of 2001 until October 2005, BMW hosted <a href="The%20Hire">The Hire</a>, showcasing sporty models being driven to extremes. These videos are still popular within the enthusiast community and proved to be a ground-breaking online advertising campaign.

Annually since 1999, BMW enthusiasts have met in Santa Barbara, CA to attend <a href="Bimmerfest">Bimmerfest</a>. One of the largest brand-specific gatherings in the United States, over 3,000 people attended in 2006, and over 1,000 BMW cars were present. In 2007, the event was held on 5 May.

The initials BMW are pronounced in German. The model series are referred to as "Einser" ("One-er" for 1 series), "Dreier" ("Three-er" for 3 series), "Fünfer" ("Five-er" for the 5 series), "Sechser" ("Six-er" for the 6 series), "Siebener" ("Seven-er" for the 7 series). These are not actually slang, but are the normal way that such letters and numbers are pronounced in German.

The English slang terms Beemer, Bimmer and Bee-em are variously used for BMWs of all kinds, cars and motorcycles.

In the US, specialists have been at pains to <a href="Linguistic%20prescription">prescribe</a> that a distinction must be made between using Beemer exclusively to describe BMW motorcycles, and using Bimmer only to refer to BMW cars, in the manner of a "true aficionado" and avoid appearing to be "uninitiated."
The Canadian "<a href="Globe%20and%20Mail">Globe and Mail</a>" prefers Bimmer and calls Beemer a "yuppie abomination," while the "<a href="Tacoma%20News%20Tribune">Tacoma News Tribune</a>" says it is a distinction made by "auto snobs." An editor of "<a href="Business%20Week">Business Week</a>" was satisfied in 2003 that the question was resolved in favor of Bimmer by noting that a Google search yielded 10 times as many hits compared to Beemer.

Manufacturers employ <a href="Industrial%20design">designer</a>s for their cars, but BMW has made efforts to gain recognition for exceptional contributions to and support of the arts, including art beyond motor vehicle design. These efforts typically overlap or complement BMW's marketing and branding campaigns. <a href="BMW%20Headquarters">BMW Headquarters</a> designed in 1972 by Karl Schwanzer has become a European icon, and artist <a href="Gerhard%20Richter">Gerhard Richter</a> created his "Red, Yellow, Blue" series of paintings for the building's lobby. In 1975, <a href="Alexander%20Calder">Alexander Calder</a> was commissioned to paint the <a href="BMW%203.0CSL">3.0CSL</a> driven by Hervé Poulain at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. This led to more <a href="BMW%20Art%20Car">BMW Art Car</a>s, painted by artists including <a href="David%20Hockney">David Hockney</a>, <a href="Jenny%20Holzer">Jenny Holzer</a>, <a href="Roy%20Lichtenstein">Roy Lichtenstein</a>, and others. The cars, currently numbering 17, have been shown at the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>, <a href="Guggenheim%20Museum%20Bilbao">Guggenheim Museum Bilbao</a>, and, in 2009, at the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%20Museum%20of%20Art">Los Angeles County Museum of Art</a> and New York's <a href="Grand%20Central%20Terminal">Grand Central Terminal</a>. BMW was the principal sponsor of the 1998 "<a href="The%20Art%20of%20the%20Motorcycle">The Art of the Motorcycle</a>" exhibition at the <a href="Solomon%20R.%20Guggenheim%20Museum">Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum</a> and other Guggenheim museums, though the financial relationship between BMW and the Guggenheim was criticised in many quarters.

In 2012, BMW brought out the BMW Art Guide by <a href="Independent%20Collectors">Independent Collectors</a>, which had, amongst others, the <a href="Dikeou%20Collection">Dikeou Collection</a>.
It is the first global guide to private and publicly accessible collections of contemporary art worldwide.

The 2006 "BMW Performance Series" was a marketing event geared to attract black car buyers, and included the "BMW Pop-Jazz Live Series," a tour headlined by jazz musician Mike Phillips, and the "BMW Blackfilms.com Film Series" highlighting black filmmakers.

BMW has garnered a reputation over the years for its <a href="April%20Fools%27%20Day">April Fools</a> pranks, which are printed in the British press every year. In 2010, they ran an advertisement in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" announcing that customers would be able to order BMWs with different coloured badges to show their affiliation with the political party they supported.

On 9 October 2014, BMW's new South American automobile plant in <a href="Araquari">Araquari</a>, <a href="Santa%20Catarina%20%28state%29">Santa Catarina</a> produced its first car. BMW intend to increase its production capacity to over 30,000 vehicles a year. The new site is intended to create around 1,300 new jobs, of which 500 have already been filled.

In October 2008, BMW Group Canada was named one of <a href="Greater%20Toronto%27s%20Top%20Employers">Greater Toronto's Top Employers</a> by Mediacorp Canada Inc., which was announced by the <a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a> newspaper.

Signing a deal in 2003 for the production of sedans in China, May 2004 saw the opening of a factory in the North-eastern city of <a href="Shenyang">Shenyang</a> where <a href="Brilliance%20Auto">Brilliance Auto</a> produces BMW-branded automobiles in a joint venture with the German company.

<a href="Bavarian%20Auto%20Group">Bavarian Auto Group</a> is a multinational group of companies established in March 2003 when it was appointed as the sole importer of BMW and Mini in Egypt, with monopoly rights for import, assembly, distribution, sales and after-sales support of BMW products in Egypt. Since that date, BAG invested a total amount of US$100 million distributed on seven companies and 11 premises in addition to three stores.

<a href="BMW%20India">BMW India</a> was established in 2006 as a sales subsidiary in <a href="Gurgaon">Gurgaon</a> (National Capital Region). A state-of-the-art assembly plant for BMW 3 and 5 Series started operation in early 2007 in <a href="Chennai">Chennai</a>. Construction of the plant started in January 2006 with an initial investment of more than one billion Indian Rupees. The plant started operation in the first quarter of 2007 and produces the different variants of <a href="BMW%203%20Series">BMW 3 Series</a>, <a href="BMW%20GT">BMW GT</a>, <a href="BMW%205%20Series">BMW 5 Series</a>, <a href="BMW%207%20Series">BMW 7 Series</a>, <a href="BMW%20X1">BMW X1</a>, <a href="BMW%20X3">BMW X3</a>, <a href="BMW%20X5">BMW X5</a>, <a href="Mini%20Cooper%20S">Mini Cooper S</a>, <a href="Mini%20Cooper%20D">Mini Cooper D</a> and <a href="Mini%20Countryman">Mini Countryman</a>. Further more, it has expanded its model range to include the <a href="BMW%20Z4">BMW Z4</a>, <a href="BMW%20X6">BMW X6</a>, BMW M Cars, and <a href="BMW%20i8">BMW i8</a>. There are a total of 31 variants of BMW cars on offer in the Indian market today.

The vast majority of BMW automobiles in Japan are imported and sold by BMW Japan Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW AG.

In July 2014, BMW announced it was establishing a plant in Mexico, in the city and state of <a href="San%20Luis%20Potosi">San Luis Potosi</a> involving an investment of $1 billion. The plant will employ 1,500 people, and produce 150,000 cars annually, commencing in 2019.

BMWs have been assembled in South Africa since 1968, when Praetor Monteerders' plant was opened in <a href="Rosslyn%2C%20Gauteng">Rosslyn</a>, near <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a>. BMW initially bought shares in the company, before fully acquiring it in 1975; in so doing, the company became BMW South Africa, the first wholly owned subsidiary of BMW to be established outside Germany. Three unique models that <a href="BMW%20Motorsport">BMW Motorsport</a> created for the South African market were the <a href="BMW%20E23">E23</a> M745i (1983), which used the <a href="BMW%20M88">M88</a> engine from the <a href="BMW%20M1">BMW M1</a>, the BMW 333i (1986), which added a six-cylinder 3.2-litre <a href="BMW%20M30">M30</a> engine to the <a href="BMW%20E30">E30</a>, and the <a href="BMW%203%20Series%20%28E30%29">E30</a> BMW 325is (1989) which was powered by an <a href="Alpina">Alpina</a>-derived 2.7-litre engine.

Unlike United States manufacturers, such as <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a> and <a href="General%20Motors">GM</a>, which divested from the country in the 1980s, BMW retained full ownership of its operations in South Africa. Following the end of <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> in 1994, and the lowering of import tariffs, BMW South Africa ended local production of the 5 Series and 7 Series, in order to concentrate on production of the 3 Series for the export market. South African–built BMWs are now exported to <a href="right%20hand%20drive">right hand drive</a> markets including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, as well as <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>. Since 1997, BMW South Africa has produced vehicles in <a href="left-hand%20drive">left-hand drive</a> for export to Taiwan, the United States and Iran, as well as South America.

BMWs with a <a href="Vehicle%20Identification%20Number">VIN</a> starting with "NC0" are manufactured in South Africa.

The <a href="BMW%20US%20Manufacturing%20Company">BMW Manufacturing Company</a> opened in 1994, in South Carolina, and has been manufacturing all <a href="BMW%20Z4">Z4</a> and <a href="BMW%20X5">X5</a> models, and more recently the <a href="BMW%20X6">X6</a> and <a href="BMW%20X3%20%28F25%29">X3</a>, including those for export to Europe, on the same assembly line in <a href="Greer%2C%20South%20Carolina">Greer</a> between <a href="Greenville%2C%20South%20Carolina">Greenville</a> and <a href="Spartanburg%2C%20South%20Carolina">Spartanburg</a>. In an average work day the company builds 600 vehicles: 500 X5s and 100 Z4s. The engines for these vehicles are built in Munich, Germany. BMWs with a <a href="Vehicle%20Identification%20Number">VIN</a> starting with "4US and 5US" are manufactured in Greer.

In 2010 BMW announced that it would spend $750 million to expand operations at the Greer plant. This expansion will allow production of 240,000 vehicles a year and will make the plant the largest car factory in the United States by number of employees. BMW's largest single market is the United States, where 339 dealerships sold 346,023 cars in 2015.

, the Greer facility produces all BMW X3, X4, X5, X5 M, X6 and X6 M models.

BMW began using the slogan 'The Ultimate Driving Machine' in the 1970s. In 2010, this long-lived campaign was mostly supplanted by 'Joy', a campaign intended to make the brand more "approachable" and to better appeal to women, but by 2012 they had returned to "The Ultimate Driving Machine", which has a strong public association with BMW.

In 2013, BMW replaced the 'double-gong' sound used in TV and Radio advertising campaigns since 1998. The new sound, developed to represent the future identity of BMW, was described as "introduced by a rising, resonant sound and underscored by two distinctive bass tones that form the sound logo's melodic and rhythmic basis." The new sound was first used in BMW 4 Series Concept Coupe TV commercial. The sound was produced by Thomas Kisser of HASTINGS media music.

The circular blue and white BMW logo or <a href="Roundel%23Corporate%20use">roundel</a> evolved from the circular <a href="Rapp%20Motorenwerke">Rapp Motorenwerke</a> company logo, from which the BMW company grew, combined with the blue and white colors of the <a href="flag%20of%20Bavaria">flag of Bavaria</a>. The logo has been portrayed as the movement of an aircraft propeller with the white blades cutting through a blue sky—first used in a BMW advertisement in 1929, twelve years after the roundel was created—but this is not the origin of the logo itself.
The BMW logo still used today was created in early 1920.

In 2012, BMW vehicles were stolen by programming a blank key fob to start the car through the <a href="on-board%20diagnostics">on-board diagnostics</a> (OBD) connection. The primary causes of this vulnerability lie in the lack of appropriate <a href="authentication">authentication</a> and <a href="authorization">authorization</a> in the OBD specifications, which rely largely on <a href="security%20through%20obscurity">security through obscurity</a>. BMW offered all owners a free fix through a software update, and all newer vehicles have upgraded software that fixed this vulnerability.

Dieter Spaar was asked by <a href="ADAC">ADAC</a> to analyze ConnectedDrive and its hardware called Combox. He uncovered the following problems which allowed him e.g. to remotely open the car:
BMW was notified in advance of the publication to provide fixes. The transport is now encrypted and BMW's server certificate is verified. The updates were delivered via ConnectedDrive config change. All BMW, Mini and Rolls Royce cars produced between March 2010 and 8 December 2014 are vulnerable. Cars without battery or parked in places without mobile connection still may be vulnerable, an update can be initiated manually.

Bornholm

Bornholm (; ) is a <a href="Denmark">Danish</a> island in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, to the east of the rest of <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, south of <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, northeast of <a href="Germany">Germany</a> and north of the westernmost part of <a href="Poland">Poland</a>. The main industries on the island include, <a href="dairy%20farming">dairy farming</a>, and arts and crafts such as <a href="glass%20production">glass production</a> and <a href="pottery">pottery</a> using locally worked <a href="clay">clay</a>. <a href="Tourism">Tourism</a> is important during the summer. There is an especially large number of Denmark's <a href="Nordic%20round%20churches">round church</a>es on the island. The total area according to www.noegletal.dk (Municipal and Regional Key Figures) was (January 2016). Population was 39,664 (1 April 2017).

The island is called "solskinsøen" ("The Sunshine Island") because of its weather and "klippeøen" ("The Rock Island") because of its , which consists of <a href="granite">granite</a>, except along the southern coast. The heat from the summer is stored in the rock formations and the weather is quite warm until October. As a result of the climate, a local variety of the <a href="common%20fig">common fig</a>, known as "Bornholm's Diamond", can grow locally on the island. The island's topography consists of dramatic rock formations in the north (unlike the rest of <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, which is mostly gentle rolling hills) sloping down towards pine and <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> forests (greatly affected by storms in the 1950s), farmland in the middle and sandy beaches in the south.

Strategically located in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, Bornholm has been fought over for centuries. It has usually been ruled by Denmark, but also by <a href="L%C3%BCbeck">Lübeck</a> and <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>. The ruin of <a href="Hammershus">Hammershus</a>, at the northwestern tip of the island, is the largest <a href="castle%23History">medieval fortress</a> in <a href="northern%20Europe">northern Europe</a>, testament to the importance of its location.

Bornholm Regional <a href="Municipality">Municipality</a>, established January 2003 by the merger of <a href="Bornholm%20County">Bornholm County</a> with 5 <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Denmark">municipalities</a>, covers the entire island. Bornholm was one of the three last Danish municipalities () not belonging to a <a href="counties%20of%20Denmark">county</a> — the others were <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> and <a href="Frederiksberg">Frederiksberg</a>. On 1 January 2007, the municipality lost its short-lived (2003 until 2006) county status and became part of the <a href="Capital%20Region%20of%20Denmark">Capital Region of Denmark</a>. The municipality's educational needs are served by the <a href="Bornholms%20Erhvervsskole">Bornholms Erhvervsskole</a>, the main educational institute on the island.

The island is situated between 54°59'11" and 55°17'30" northern latitude and 14°45' and 15°11' eastern longitude.

Directly west of Bornholm across the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> mostly on the island of <a href="Sj%C3%A6lland">Sjælland</a> are several municipalities of <a href="Region%20Sj%C3%A6lland">Region Sjælland</a>: <a href="Stevns%20Municipality">Stevns</a>, <a href="Faxe%20Municipality">Faxe</a>, <a href="N%C3%A6stved%20Municipality">Næstved</a> (the part that used to be the municipality of <a href="Flads%C3%A5">Fladså</a>) and <a href="Vordingborg%20Municipality">Vordingborg</a>, including <a href="M%C3%B8n">Møn</a>, which is around across the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>.

It typically takes 3 hours for passengers and freight (<a href="HSC%20Leonora%20Christina">ferry</a> :2 hours; driving :1 hour) to travel between <a href="R%C3%B8nne">Rønne</a> and <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> via <a href="Ystad">Ystad</a> in <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>. There is a ferry departure mostly reserved for freight of goods between <a href="R%C3%B8nne">Rønne</a> and <a href="K%C3%B8ge">Køge</a>. If there is capacity on a departure, "normal" passengers can come aboard. There are also ferry routes to <a href="Sassnitz">Sassnitz</a> and <a href="%C5%9Awinouj%C5%9Bcie">Świnoujście</a>. Between <a href="Bornholm%20Airport">Bornholm Airport</a> and <a href="Copenhagen%20Airport">Copenhagen Airport</a> by airplane it is 25 minutes.

The <a href="Ertholmene">Ertholmene</a> archipelago is located to the northeast of Bornholm. These islands, which do not belong to a municipality or region, are administered by the Danish <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28Denmark%29">Ministry of Defence</a>.

Many inhabitants speak the <a href="Bornholmsk%20dialect">Bornholmsk dialect</a>, which is officially a <a href="Danish%20language%23Dialects">dialect of Danish</a>. Bornholmsk retains three <a href="grammatical%20gender">grammatical gender</a>s, like <a href="Icelandic%20language">Icelandic</a> and most dialects of <a href="Norwegian%20language">Norwegian</a>, but unlike standard <a href="Danish%20language">Danish</a>. Its <a href="phonology">phonology</a> includes <a href="archaism">archaism</a>s (unstressed and internal , where other dialects have and ) and innovations ( for before and after front-tongue vowels). This makes the dialect difficult to understand for some Danish speakers. However, <a href="Swedish%20language">Swedish speakers</a> often consider Bornholmian to be easier to understand than standard Danish. The <a href="Intonation%20%28linguistics%29">intonation</a> resembles the <a href="Scanian%20dialect">Scanian dialect</a> spoken in nearby <a href="Scania">Scania</a>, the southernmost province of <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>.

 

Bornholm Regional Municipality is the local authority (<a href="Danish%20language">Danish</a>, "kommune") covering the entire island. It is the result of a merger of the five former (1 April 1970 until 2002) municipalities on the island (<a href="Allinge-Gudhjem%20Municipality">Allinge-Gudhjem</a>, <a href="Hasle%2C%20Bornholm">Hasle</a>, <a href="Nex%C3%B8">Nexø</a>, <a href="R%C3%B8nne">Rønne</a> and <a href="Aakirkeby">Aakirkeby</a>) and the former <a href="Bornholm%20County">Bornholm County</a>. Bornholm Regional Municipality was also a county in its own right during its first four years from 1 January 2003 until 31 December 2006. From 1 January 2007 all counties were abolished, and Bornholm became part of <a href="Region%20Hovedstaden">Region Hovedstaden</a> whose main responsibility is the health service. The municipality still retains its name Bornholm "Regional" Municipality. The island had 22 municipalities until March 1970, of which 6 were market towns and 16 parishes. In addition to supervising parish municipalities, which was the responsibility of the counties in "all" of Denmark, the market town municipalities of Bornholm were supervised by Bornholm County as well and not by the Interior Ministry as was the case in the rest of Denmark. The seat of the municipal council is the island's main town, Rønne. The voters decided to merge the county with the municipalities in a referendum May 29, 2001, effective from January 1, 2003. On the <a href="ballot">ballot</a> was written the question, "Do you want the six municipal entities of Bornholm to be joined to form one municipal entity as of 1 January 2003?" 73.9% of those voting ticked off the box "Ja" (English, "Yes") on the ballot. The lowest percentage for the merger was in <a href="Nex%C3%B8">Nexø</a> municipality, whose mayor, Annelise Molin, a Social Democrat, spoke out against the merger. It was required that each municipality had more "Yes" votes than "No" votes. Otherwise the merger would have to be abandoned altogether. The six municipal entities had 122 councillors (of which county clls were 15) and the new regional municipality would have 27 councillors from the start. They will be reduced to 23 from 1 January 2018 (<a href="Danish%20local%20elections%2C%202017">election November 2017</a>). The merger was approved in a law by the <a href="Folketing">Folketing</a> 19 March 2002, transferring the tasks of the abolished county and old municipalities to the new "Bornholm Regional Municipality". The first regional mayor was Thomas Thors, a physician and member of the <a href="Social%20Democrats%20%28Denmark%29">Social Democrats</a> and previously mayor of Rønne Municipality. Bjarne Kristiansen, representing the local Borgerlisten political party, served as mayor from January 1, 2006 until 2009. From January 1, 2010 the mayor has been Winni Grosbøll, a high school teacher and a member of the <a href="Social%20Democrats%20%28Denmark%29">Social Democrats</a> ("Socialdemokratiet") <a href="Politics%20of%20Denmark">political party</a>.

Ferry services connect Rønne to <a href="%C5%9Awinouj%C5%9Bcie">Świnoujście</a> (<a href="Poland">Poland</a>), <a href="Sassnitz">Sassnitz</a> (<a href="Germany">Germany</a>), <a href="K%C3%B8ge">Køge</a>, by road ( as the crow flies) south of Copenhagen, <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>; the destination to Køge replaced the nighttime route directly to and from Copenhagen (for both cargo and passengers) from 1 October 2004; and <a href="HSC%20Leonora%20Christina">catamaran</a> services to <a href="Ystad">Ystad</a> (<a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>). <a href="Simrishamn">Simrishamn</a> (<a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>) has a ferry connection during the summer. There are also regular <a href="catamaran">catamaran</a> services between <a href="Nex%C3%B8">Nexø</a> and the Polish ports of <a href="Ko%C5%82obrzeg">Kołobrzeg</a>, <a href="%C5%81eba">Łeba</a> and <a href="Ustka">Ustka</a>. There are direct bus connections Ystad-Copenhagen, coordinated with the catamaran. There are also flights from <a href="Bornholm%20Airport">Bornholm Airport</a> to Copenhagen and other locations.

Bornholm Regional Municipality was not merged with other municipalities on 1 January 2007 in the nationwide <a href="Municipalities%20of%20Denmark%23Municipal%20Reform%202007">Municipal Reform of 2007</a>.

The larger towns on the island are located on the coast and have harbours. There is however one exception, centrally placed <a href="Aakirkeby">Aakirkeby</a>, which was also the name of the municipality from 1970 until 2002, which also included the harbor, , to the south. The largest town is <a href="R%C3%B8nne">Rønne</a>, the seat, in the southwest. The other main towns (clockwise round the island) are <a href="Hasle%2C%20Bornholm">Hasle</a>, <a href="Allinge-Sandvig">Allinge-Sandvig</a>, <a href="Gudhjem">Gudhjem</a>, <a href="Svaneke">Svaneke</a> and <a href="Nex%C3%B8">Nexø</a>. Monday morning 22 September 2014 it was documented by "Folkeregistret" in the municipality that the number of people living in the municipality that day were 39,922, the lowest number in over 100 years.

, the Danish statistical office gave the populations as follows:

The "town" of Rønne after the merger of the island's administrative entities 1 January 2003 reached a low point of 13568 inhabitants 1 January 2014. 15957 people in 1965 (date unknown;number not registerbased) lived in the two parishes that would become Rønne municipality from 1 April 1970. In the table, numbers for Rønne are for the parish of Rønne, , alone. Year unknown. It does not include , which was also a part of Rønne Municipality. Other localities (with approximate populations, not updated) include <a href="Aarsballe">Aarsballe</a> (86), <a href="Arnager">Arnager</a> (151), <a href="Olsker">Olsker</a> (67), <a href="Rutsker">Rutsker</a> (64), <a href="R%C3%B8">Rø</a> (181), <a href="Stenseby">Stenseby</a> (?) and <a href="Vang%2C%20Bornholm">Vang</a> (92).

In Old Norse the island was known as "Borgundarholm", and in <a href="History%20of%20Danish">ancient Danish</a> especially the island's name was "Borghand" or "Borghund"; these names were related to <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> "borg" "height" and "bjarg/berg" "mountain, rock", as it is an island that rises high from the sea. Other names known for the island include "Burgendaland" (9th century), "Hulmo" / "Holmus" ("<a href="Gesta%20Hammaburgensis%20ecclesiae%20pontificum">Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum</a>"), "Burgundehulm" (1145), and "Borghandæholm" (14th century). The Old English translation of Orosius uses the form "Burgenda land". Some scholars believe that the <a href="Burgundians">Burgundians</a> are named after Bornholm; the Burgundians were <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic peoples</a> who moved west when the <a href="Western%20Roman%20Empire">Western Roman Empire</a> collapsed and occupied and named <a href="Burgundy%20%28region%29">Burgundy</a> in <a href="France">France</a>.
Bornholm formed part of the historical <a href="Lands%20of%20Denmark">Lands of Denmark</a> when the nation united out of a series of petty chiefdoms. It was originally administratively part of the province of <a href="Scania">Scania</a> and was administered by the <a href="Scanian%20Law">Scanian Law</a> after this was codified in the 13th century. Control over the island evolved into a long-raging dispute between the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Lund">See of Lund</a> and the <a href="List%20of%20Danish%20monarchs">Danish crown</a> culminating in several battles. The first fortress on the island was "<a href="Gamleborg">Gamleborg</a>" which was replaced by "<a href="Lilleborg%2C%20Bornholm">Lilleborg</a>", built by the king in 1150. In 1149, the king accepted the transfer of three of the island's four <a href="Hundred%20%28country%20subdivision%29">herreder</a> (districts) to the archbishop. In 1250, the archbishop constructed his own fortress, <a href="Hammershus">Hammershus</a>. A campaign launched from it in 1259 conquered the remaining part of the island including Lilleborg. The island's status remained a matter of dispute for an additional 200 years.

Bornholm was pawned to <a href="L%C3%BCbeck">Lübeck</a> for 50 years starting in 1525. Its first militia, <a href="Bornholms%20Milits">Bornholms Milits</a>, was formed in 1624.
Swedish forces conquered the island in 1645, but returned the island to Denmark in the following peace settlement. After the war in 1658, Denmark ceded the island to Sweden under the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Roskilde">Treaty of Roskilde</a> along with the rest of the <a href="Sk%C3%A5neland">Skåneland</a>, <a href="Bohusl%C3%A4n">Bohuslän</a> and <a href="Tr%C3%B8ndelag">Trøndelag</a>, and it was occupied by Swedish forces.

A revolt broke out the same year, culminating in Villum Clausen's shooting of the Swedish commander <a href="Johan%20Printzensk%C3%B6ld">Johan Printzensköld</a> on 8 December 1658. Following the revolt, a deputation of islanders presented the island as a gift to King <a href="Frederick%20III%20of%20Denmark">Frederick III</a> on the condition that the island would never be ceded again. This status was confirmed in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Copenhagen%20%281660%29">Treaty of Copenhagen</a> in 1660.

<a href="Swedes">Swedes</a>, notably from <a href="Sm%C3%A5land">Småland</a> and Scania, emigrated to the island during the 19th century, seeking work and better conditions. Most of the migrants did not remain.
Bornholm also attracted many famous artists at the beginning of the 20th century, forming a group now known as the <a href="Bornholm%20school%20of%20painters">Bornholm school of painters</a>. In addition to <a href="Oluf%20H%C3%B8st">Oluf Høst</a>, they include <a href="Karl%20Isaksson">Karl Isaksson</a> (1878–1922), from Sweden, and the Danes <a href="Edvard%20Weie">Edvard Weie</a> (1879-1943), <a href="Olaf%20Rude">Olaf Rude</a> (1886–1957), <a href="Niels%20Lergaard">Niels Lergaard</a> (1893–1982), and <a href="Kr%C3%A6sten%20Iversen">Kræsten Iversen</a> (1886–1955).

Bornholm, as a part of Denmark, was <a href="Denmark%20in%20World%20War%20II">captured by Germany</a> on 10 April 1940, and served as a lookout post and listening station during the war, as it was a part of the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a>. The island's perfect central position in the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> meant that it was an important "natural fortress" between <a href="Germany">Germany</a> and <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, effectively keeping submarines and destroyers away from Nazi-occupied waters. Several concrete coastal installations were built during the war, and several coastal batteries had tremendous range. However, none of them were ever used, and only a single test shot was fired during the occupation. These remnants of Nazi rule have since fallen into disrepair and are mostly regarded today as historical curiosities. Many tourists visit the ruins each year, however, providing supplemental income to the tourist industry.

On 22 August 1943 a <a href="V-1%20flying%20bomb">V-1 flying bomb</a> (numbered V83, probably launched from a <a href="Heinkel%20He%20111">Heinkel He 111</a>) crashed on Bornholm during a test – the warhead was a dummy made of concrete. This was photographed or sketched by the Danish Naval Officer-in-Charge on Bornholm, Lieutenant Commander Hasager Christiansen. This was the first sign British Intelligence saw of Germany's aspirations to develop flying bombs and rockets which were to become known as V-1 and <a href="V-2">V-2</a>.

Bornholm was heavily bombarded by the <a href="Soviet%20Air%20Forces">Soviet Air Force</a> in May 1945. German garrison commander, German Navy Captain <a href="List%20of%20Knight%27s%20Cross%20of%20the%20Iron%20Cross%20recipients%20%28Ka-Km%29">Gerhard von Kamptz</a>, refused to surrender to the Soviets, as his orders were to surrender to the Western Allies. The Germans sent several telegrams to Copenhagen requesting that at least one British soldier should be transferred to Bornholm, so that the Germans could surrender to the western allied forces instead of the Soviets. When von Kamptz failed to provide a written capitulation as demanded by the Soviet commanders, Soviet aircraft relentlessly bombed and destroyed more than 800 civilian houses in <a href="R%C3%B8nne">Rønne</a> and <a href="Nex%C3%B8">Nexø</a> and seriously damaged roughly 3,000 more on 7–8 May 1945.

During the Soviet bombing of the two main towns on 7 and 8 May, Danish radio was not allowed to broadcast the news because it was thought it would spoil the liberation festivities in Denmark. On 9 May Soviet troops landed on the island, and after a short fight, the German garrison (about 12,000 strong) surrendered. Soviet forces left the island on 5 April 1946.

In the mid 1940s Donald (descendant of <a href="Ben%20Sayers">Ben Sayers</a>) and Mavis Sayers arrived in Bornholm on a boat from Copenhagen. On their arrival they were greeted by a band and were paraded into the town centre. They were celebrated by the locals as the first English people to visit Bornholm since the end of the war and were treated like royalty during their stay. Following their stay they were frequently invited back as they were seen as a symbol of the restoration of Bornholm.

After the evacuation of their forces from Bornholm, the Soviets took the position that the stationing of foreign troops on Bornholm would be considered a declaration of war against the Soviet Union, and that Denmark should keep troops on it at all times to protect it from such foreign aggression. This policy remained in force after NATO was formed, with Denmark as a founding member. The Soviets accepted the stationing there of Danish troops, which were part of NATO but viewed as militarily inferior elements of the alliance, but they strongly objected to the presence of other NATO troops on Bornholm, in particular of US troops.

On the surface of Bornholm older formations can be seen better than in the rest of Denmark. "Stubbeløkken" - which is still operating (Danish "i drift") - and "Klippeløkken" granite quarries in just east of central <a href="R%C3%B8nne">Rønne</a> - and statistically a part of the town - are among the few remaining quarries of what was once many active quarries on the island. The island's varied geography and seascapes attract visitors to its many beauty spots from the <a href="Hammeren">Hammeren</a> promontory in the northwest to the <a href="Almindingen">Almindingen</a> forest in the centre and the <a href="Dueodde">Dueodde</a> beaches in the southeast. Of special interest are the rocky sea cliffs at <a href="Jons%20Kapel">Jons Kapel</a> and <a href="Helligdomsklipperne">Helligdomsklipperne</a>, the varied topography of <a href="Paradisbakkerne">Paradisbakkerne</a> and rift valleys such as <a href="Ekkodalen">Ekkodalen</a> and <a href="D%C3%B8ndalen">Døndalen</a>. Bornholm's <a href="List%20of%20windmills%20on%20Bornholm">numerous windmills</a> include the <a href="post%20mill">post mill</a> of <a href="Egeby%20M%C3%B8lle">Egeby</a> and the well-kept <a href="Aarsdale%20Windmill">Dutch mill at Aarsdale</a>. The lighthouse at <a href="Dueodde%20Lighthouse">Dueodde</a> is Denmark's tallest, while <a href="Hammeren%20Lighthouse">Hammeren Lighthouse</a> stands at a height of <a href="Above%20mean%20sea%20level">above sea level</a> and <a href="R%C3%B8nne%20Lighthouse">Rønne Lighthouse</a> rises over the waterfront.

Examples of roads that have (very) steep <a href="Grade%20%28slope%29">climbs</a> and descents are: (inland) <a href="Simbleg%C3%A5rdsvej">Simblegårdsvej</a> in <a href="Klemensker">Klemensker</a>, which begins by the village inn <a href="Klemens%20Kro">Klemens Kro</a>, and <a href="Slamrebjergvej">Slamrebjergvej</a> just outside <a href="Nex%C3%B8">Nexø</a> extending northward from the main road from <a href="R%C3%B8nne">Rønne</a>. Along the coast there are several steep roads, which is also the case in some parts of <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a> as a whole, for instance in and around <a href="Vejle%20Municipality">Vejle</a>.

The island hosts examples of 19th- and early-20th-century architecture, and about 300 wooden houses in <a href="R%C3%B8nne">Rønne</a> and <a href="Nex%C3%B8">Nexø</a>, donated by <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, when the island was repairing damage caused by the war.
The island is home to 15 <a href="list%20of%20Bornholm%20churches">medieval churches</a>, four of which are <a href="Nordic%20round%20churches">round churches</a> with unique artwork and architecture. The ancient site of <a href="Rispebjerg">Rispebjerg</a> has remains of sun temples from the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> and earthworks from the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>.

There are 14 <a href="European%20bison">European bison</a> near <a href="%C3%85kirkeby">Åkirkeby</a>, attracting 100,000 visitors a year.




Bornholm is connected to the Swedish electricity grid by a submarine 60 kV AC cable, which is among the longest AC cables in Europe. This cable is capable of delivering all the electrical energy consumed on Bornholm. However Bornholm also generates its own electricity at small thermal power plants and especially <a href="wind%20turbine">wind turbine</a>s.

Bornholm is also home to a large internationally funded demonstration project to test the viability of novel energy market mechanisms to regulate energy networks with a high prevalence of renewables (such as wind turbines and photovoltaics). 50% of the project is EU-funded, with the remainder coming mainly from large corporations. See http://www.eu-ecogrid.net/ecogrid-eu for more.

22 September 2014 population numbers showed fewer than 40,000 inhabitants on the island for the first time in over 100 years. The "Folkeregister" in the municipality could document 39,922 inhabitants in the municipality on that date.

Bornholm has an <a href="oceanic%20climate">oceanic climate</a> relatively similar to southern Sweden and mainland Denmark, whose summer highs and winter lows are heavily moderated by its maritime and isolated position. Even though heat is rare, the climate is sunny during summers and rainfall is generally sparse for a climate of this type. The winter (November–December) 2010 - (January–April) 2011 was exceptionally extreme with snow depth reaching at least 146 <a href="centimeter">cm</a>, 2 inches short of 5 <a href="foot%20%28unit%29">feet</a> (<a href="snowdrift">snowdrift</a>s 6 <a href="Metre">meters</a>, almost 20 feet) the highest in Northern Europe. Military had to assist. The <a href="Danish%20Meteorological%20Institute">DMI</a> estimated the weight of snow to be 100 <a href="million">million</a> <a href="ton">ton</a>. 2013 was a cold year, with only June, July, and August being warm.

Bornholm's geography as an island and moderate climate makes Bornholm an ideal location for sailing and other water-based sports.

Bornholm has also become an internationally recognised venue for 'match racing', a sailing sport where two identical (or one design) supplied racing yachts are raced in one-on-one dogfights on the water. The <a href="Danish%20Open%20%28yachting%29">Danish Open</a> event was held in Bornholm in September 2010 at the port town of Rønne on the Western coast of Bornholm. The racing yachts used for the Danish Open event are Danish-designed DS37 racing yachts. These highly manoeuvrable and versatile boats are also used in the Match Cup Sweden event.

The five-day Danish Open is a key event in the <a href="World%20Match%20Racing%20Tour">World Match Racing Tour</a> calendar which is one of only 3 events awarded 'special event' status by the <a href="International%20Sailing%20Federation">International Sailing Federation</a>. The Tour is the world's leading professional 'match racing' series and features a nine-event calendar which crosses three continents during the series.

Points accrued during the Danish Open contribute directly to the World Match Racing Tour championship with the winner of the season finale at the Monsoon Cup in Malaysia claiming the ultimate match racing title ISAF World Match Racing Champion.

Unlike other sailing sports, match racing is suited to locations like Bornholm, because it takes place in close proximity to the shore which provides spectacular heat-of-the-action viewing for the on-shore audience.

There are two small stadiums: <a href="Nex%C3%B8%20Stadion">Nexø Stadion</a>, in <a href="Nex%C3%B8">Nexø</a>, where <a href="NB%20Bornholm">NB Bornholm</a> <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club play; and the slightly larger multi-use stadium <a href="R%C3%B8nne%20Stadion%20Nord">Rønne Stadion Nord</a> in <a href="R%C3%B8nne">Rønne</a>, which serves the <a href="Non-FIFA%20international%20football">Bornholm national football team</a>, multi-section club most well known for <a href="Athletics%28sport%29">athletics</a> IK Viking, and several local football clubs. The <a href="DBU%20Bornholm">DBU Bornholm</a> is the local branch governing football on the island.

Various Christian denominations have become established on the island, most during the 19th century.

Book

A book is a set of sheets of <a href="paper">paper</a>, <a href="parchment">parchment</a>, or similar materials that are fastened together to hinge at one side. A single sheet within a book is a <a href="Recto">leaf</a>, and each side of a leaf is a <a href="page%20%28paper%29">page</a>. Writing or images can be printed or drawn on a book's pages. An electronic image that is formatted to resemble a book on a computer screen, <a href="smartphone">smartphone</a> or <a href="e-reader">e-reader</a> device is known as an electronic book or <a href="e-book">e-book</a>.

The term "books" may also refer to a body of works of <a href="literature">literature</a>, or a main division of literature (e.g., <a href="children%27s%20literature">children's literature</a>) . In <a href="library%20and%20information%20science">library and information science</a>, a book is called a <a href="monograph">monograph</a>, to distinguish it from serial <a href="periodical">periodical</a>s such as <a href="magazine">magazine</a>s, <a href="academic%20journal">journal</a>s, or <a href="newspaper">newspaper</a>s. In <a href="novel">novel</a>s and sometimes other types of books (for example, biographies), a book may be divided into several large sections, also called books (Book 1, Book 2, Book 3, and so on). An avid reader or collector of books or a book lover is a <a href="Bibliophilia">bibliophile</a> or colloquially, "bookworm".

A shop where <a href="Bookselling">books are bought and sold</a> is a <a href="bookshop">bookshop</a> or bookstore. Books are also sold in some department stores, drugstores and newspaper vendors. Books can also be borrowed from <a href="Lending%20library">libraries</a>. <a href="Google">Google</a> has estimated that as of 2010, approximately 130,000,000 distinct titles had been published. In some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has decreased because of the use of <a href="Ebooks">e-books</a>, though sales of e-books declined in the first half of 2015.

The word book comes from <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> "bōc", which in turn comes from the <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic</a> root "*bōk-", <a href="cognate">cognate</a> to "<a href="beech">beech</a>". Similarly, in <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic languages</a> (for example, <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a>, <a href="Bulgarian%20language">Bulgarian</a>, <a href="Macedonian%20language">Macedonian</a>) "буква" (bukva—"letter") is cognate with "beech". In Russian and in <a href="Serbian%20language">Serbian</a> and Macedonian, the word "букварь" (bukvar') or "буквар" (bukvar) refers specifically to a primary school textbook that helps young children master the techniques of reading and writing.
It is thus conjectured that the earliest <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a> writings may have been carved on beech wood. Similarly, the Latin word "codex", meaning a book in the modern sense (bound and with separate leaves), originally meant "block of wood".

When <a href="History%20of%20writing">writing systems</a> were created in <a href="ancient%20civilization">ancient civilization</a>s, a variety of objects, such as stone, <a href="clay%20tablet">clay</a>, tree bark, metal sheets, might be used for writing. The study of such inscriptions forms a major part of history. The study of inscriptions is known as <a href="epigraphy">epigraphy</a>. <a href="History%20of%20the%20alphabet">Alphabetic writing</a> emerged in <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. The Ancient Egyptians would often write on <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a>, a plant grown along the Nile River. At first the words were not separated from each other ("<a href="scriptura%20continua">scriptura continua</a>") and there was no <a href="punctuation">punctuation</a>. Texts were written from right to left, left to right, or even so that alternate lines read in opposite directions. The technical term for that last type of writing is '<a href="boustrophedon">boustrophedon</a>', which means literally 'ox-turning' for the way a farmer drives an ox to plough his fields.

A tablet might be defined as a physically robust writing medium, suitable for casual transport and writing. See also <a href="stylus">stylus</a>, the instrument used to write on a tablet. <a href="Clay%20tablet">Clay tablet</a>s were flattened and mostly dry pieces of clay that could be easily carried, and impressed with a (possibly dampened) <a href="stylus">stylus</a>. They were used as a writing medium, especially for writing in <a href="cuneiform">cuneiform</a>, throughout the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> and well into the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>. Tablets were used by traders to record sales of goods such as bushels of grain and by rulers' scribes to record tax or other levy collections.

<a href="Wax%20tablet">Wax tablet</a>s were pieces of wood covered in a thick enough coating of wax to record the impressions of a stylus. They were the normal writing material in schools, in accounting, and for taking notes. They had the advantage of being reusable: the wax could be melted, and reformed into a blank. The custom of binding several wax tablets together (Roman "pugillares") is a possible precursor for modern books (i.e. codex). The etymology of the word "codex" (block of wood) also suggests that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets.

Scrolls can be made from <a href="papyrus">papyrus</a>, a thick <a href="paper">paper-like</a> material made by weaving the stems of the papyrus plant, then pounding the woven sheet with a hammer-like tool until it is flattened. Papyrus was used for writing in <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>, perhaps as early as the <a href="First%20Dynasty">First Dynasty</a>, although the first evidence is from the account books of King <a href="Nefertiti%20Kakai">Nefertiti Kakai</a> of the <a href="Fifth%20Dynasty">Fifth Dynasty</a> (about 2400 BC). Papyrus sheets were glued together to form a <a href="scroll%20%28parchment%29">scroll</a>. Tree bark such as <a href="Tilia">lime</a> and other materials were also used.

According to <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> (History 5:58), the <a href="Phoenicians">Phoenicians</a> brought writing and papyrus to Greece around the 10th or 9th century BC. The Greek word for papyrus as writing material ("biblion") and book ("biblos") come from the Phoenician port town <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a>, through which papyrus was exported to Greece. From Greek we also derive the word tome (), which originally meant a slice or piece and from there began to denote "a roll of papyrus". "Tomus" was used by the Latins with exactly the same meaning as "volumen" (see also below the explanation by Isidore of Seville).

Whether made from papyrus, <a href="parchment">parchment</a>, or paper, scrolls were the dominant form of book in the Hellenistic, Roman, Chinese, Hebrew, and Macedonian cultures. The more modern <a href="codex">codex</a> book format form took over the Roman world by <a href="late%20antiquity">late antiquity</a>, but the scroll format persisted much longer in Asia.

<a href="Isidore%20of%20Seville">Isidore of Seville</a> (died 636) explained the then-current relation between codex, book and scroll in his Etymologiae (VI.13): "A codex is composed of many books; a book is of one scroll. It is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks ("codex") of trees or vines, as if it were a wooden stock, because it contains in itself a multitude of books, as it were of branches." Modern usage differs.

A codex (in modern usage) is the first information repository that modern people would recognize as a "book": leaves of uniform size <a href="bookbinding">bound</a> in some manner along one edge, and typically held between two <a href="book%20cover">covers</a> made of some more robust material. The first written mention of the codex as a form of book is from <a href="Martial">Martial</a>, in his Apophoreta at the end of the first century, where he praises its compactness. However, the codex never gained much popularity in the pagan Hellenistic world, and only within the Christian community did it gain widespread use. This change happened gradually during the 3rd and 4th centuries, and the reasons for adopting the codex form of the book are several: the format is more economical, as both sides of the writing material can be used; and it is portable, searchable, and easy to conceal. A book is much easier to read, to find a page that you want, and to flip through. A scroll is more awkward to use. The Christian <a href="author">author</a>s may also have wanted to distinguish their writings from the pagan and Judaic texts written on scrolls. In addition, some metal books were made, that required smaller pages of metal, instead of an impossibly long, unbending scroll of metal. A book can also be easily stored in more compact places, or side by side in a tight library or shelf space.

The fall of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> in the 5th century A.D. saw the decline of the <a href="culture%20of%20ancient%20Rome">culture of ancient Rome</a>. Papyrus became difficult to obtain due to lack of contact with Egypt, and parchment, which had been used for centuries, became the main writing material. Parchment is a material made from processed animal skin and used—mainly in the past—for writing on.
Parchment is most commonly made of calfskin, sheepskin, or goatskin. It was historically used for writing documents, notes, or the pages of a book. Parchment is limed, scraped and dried under tension. It is not tanned, and is thus different from leather. This makes it more suitable for writing on, but leaves it very reactive to changes in relative humidity and makes it revert to rawhide if overly wet.

Monasteries carried on the <a href="Latin%20literature">Latin</a> writing tradition in the <a href="Western%20Roman%20Empire">Western Roman Empire</a>. <a href="Cassiodorus">Cassiodorus</a>, in the monastery of Vivarium (established around 540), stressed the importance of copying texts. <a href="Benedict%20of%20Nursia">St. Benedict of Nursia</a>, in his "<a href="Rule%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Rule of Saint Benedict</a>" (completed around the middle of the 6th century) later also promoted reading. The "Rule of Saint Benedict" (Ch. ), which set aside certain times for reading, greatly influenced the monastic culture of the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> and is one of the reasons why the clergy were the predominant readers of books. The tradition and style of the Roman Empire still dominated, but slowly the peculiar medieval book culture emerged.

Before the invention and adoption of the <a href="printing%20press">printing press</a>, almost all books were copied by hand, which made books expensive and comparatively rare. Smaller monasteries usually had only a few dozen books, medium-sized perhaps a few hundred. By the 9th century, larger collections held around 500 volumes and even at the end of the Middle Ages, the papal library in <a href="Avignon">Avignon</a> and Paris library of the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">Sorbonne</a> held only around 2,000 volumes.
The "<a href="scriptorium">scriptorium</a>" of the monastery was usually located over the <a href="chapter%20house">chapter house</a>. Artificial light was forbidden for fear it may damage the manuscripts. There were five types of scribes:

The bookmaking process was long and laborious. The parchment had to be prepared, then the unbound pages were planned and ruled with a blunt tool or lead, after which the text was written by the <a href="scribe">scribe</a>, who usually left blank areas for illustration and <a href="rubrication">rubrication</a>. Finally, the book was bound by the <a href="bookbinding">bookbinder</a>.
Different types of ink were known in antiquity, usually prepared from soot and gum, and later also from <a href="gall">gall</a> nuts and <a href="Iron%28II%29%20sulfate">iron vitriol</a>. This gave writing a brownish black color, but black or brown were not the only colors used. There are texts written in red or even gold, and different colors were used for illumination. For very luxurious manuscripts the whole parchment <a href="Purple%20parchment">was colored purple</a>, and the text was written on it with gold or silver (for example, <a href="Codex%20Argenteus">Codex Argenteus</a>).

Irish monks introduced spacing between words in the 7th century. This facilitated reading, as these monks tended to be less familiar with Latin. However, the use of spaces between words did not become commonplace before the 12th century. It has been argued that the use of spacing between words shows the transition from semi-vocalized reading into silent reading.

The first books used <a href="parchment">parchment</a> or <a href="vellum">vellum</a> (<a href="calfskin">calfskin</a>) for the pages. The book covers were made of wood and covered with leather. Because dried parchment tends to assume the form it had before processing, the books were fitted with clasps or straps. During the later <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, when public libraries appeared, up to the 18th century, books were often chained to a bookshelf or a <a href="desk">desk</a> to prevent theft. These chained books are called "libri catenati".

At first, books were copied mostly in monasteries, one at a time. With the rise of universities in the 13th century, the <a href="Manuscript%20culture">Manuscript culture</a> of the time led to an increase in the demand for books, and a new system for copying books appeared. The books were divided into unbound leaves ("pecia"), which were lent out to different copyists, so the speed of book production was considerably increased. The system was maintained by secular <a href="stationery">stationers</a> guilds, which produced both religious and non-religious material.

<a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> has kept the art of the scribe alive up to the present. According to Jewish tradition, the <a href="Torah">Torah</a> scroll placed in a <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a> must be written by hand on parchment and a printed book would not do, though the congregation may use printed prayer books and printed copies of the Scriptures are used for study outside the <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>. A <a href="sofer">sofer</a> "scribe" is a highly respected member of any observant Jewish community.

People of various religious (Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, Muslims) and ethnic backgrounds (Syriac, Coptic, Persian, Arab etc.) in the Middle East also produced and bound books in the <a href="Islamic%20Golden%20Age">Islamic Golden Age</a> (mid 8th century to 1258), developing advanced techniques in <a href="Islamic%20calligraphy">Islamic calligraphy</a>, <a href="miniature%20%28illuminated%20manuscript%29">miniatures</a> and bookbinding. A number of cities in the medieval Islamic world had book production centers and book markets. Yaqubi (d. 897) says that in his time Baghdad had over a hundred booksellers. Book shops were often situated around the town's principal mosque as in <a href="Marrakesh">Marrakesh</a>, <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, that has a street named "Kutubiyyin" or book sellers in English and the famous <a href="Koutoubia%20Mosque">Koutoubia Mosque</a> is named so because of its location in this street.

The medieval <a href="Muslim%20world">Muslim world</a> also used a method of reproducing reliable copies of a book in large quantities known as <a href="Proofreading">check reading</a>, in contrast to the traditional method of a single scribe producing only a single copy of a single manuscript. In the check reading method, only "authors could authorize copies, and this was done in public sessions in which the copyist read the copy aloud in the presence of the author, who then certified it as accurate." With this check-reading system, "an author might produce a dozen or more copies from a single reading," and with two or more readings, "more than one hundred copies of a single book could easily be produced." By using as writing material the relatively cheap paper instead of parchment or papyrus the Muslims, in the words of Pedersen "accomplished a feat of crucial significance not only to the history of the Islamic book, but also to the whole world of books".

In <a href="woodblock%20printing">woodblock printing</a>, a relief image of an entire page was carved into blocks of wood, inked, and used to print copies of that page. This method originated in China, in the <a href="Han%20dynasty">Han dynasty</a> (before 220 AD), as a method of <a href="printing">printing</a> on <a href="textiles">textiles</a> and later <a href="paper">paper</a>, and was widely used throughout <a href="East%20Asia">East Asia</a>. The oldest dated book printed by this method is "<a href="The%20Diamond%20Sutra">The Diamond Sutra</a>" (868 AD).The method (called "<a href="Woodcut">Woodcut</a>" when used in art) arrived in Europe in the early 14th century. Books (known as <a href="Woodblock%20printing">block-books</a>), as well as <a href="playing-cards">playing-cards</a> and <a href="old%20master%20print">religious pictures</a>, began to be produced by this method. Creating an entire book was a painstaking process, requiring a hand-carved block for each page; and the wood blocks tended to crack, if stored for long. The monks or people who wrote them were paid highly.

The Chinese inventor <a href="Bi%20Sheng">Bi Sheng</a> made <a href="movable%20type">movable type</a> of earthenware circa 1045, but there are no known surviving examples of his printing. Around 1450, in what is commonly regarded as an independent invention, <a href="Johannes%20Gutenberg">Johannes Gutenberg</a> invented movable type in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and <a href="hand%20mould">hand mould</a>. This invention gradually made books less expensive to produce, and more widely available.

Early printed books, single sheets and images which were created before 1501 in Europe are known as <a href="incunable">incunable</a>s or "incunabula". "A man born in 1453, the year of the fall of Constantinople, could look back from his fiftieth year on a lifetime in which about eight million books had been printed, more perhaps than all the scribes of Europe had produced since Constantine founded his city in A.D. 330."

Steam-powered printing presses became popular in the early 19th century. These machines could print 1,100 sheets per hour, but workers could only set 2,000 letters per hour. <a href="Monotype">Monotype</a> and <a href="linotype%20machine">linotype</a> typesetting machines were introduced in the late 19th century. They could set more than 6,000 letters per hour and an entire line of type at once. There have been numerous improvements in the printing press. As well, the conditions for <a href="freedom%20of%20the%20press">freedom of the press</a> have been improved through the gradual relaxation of restrictive censorship laws. See also <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual property</a>, <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a>, <a href="copyright">copyright</a>. In mid-20th century, European book production had risen to over 200,000 titles per year.

Throughout the 20th century, libraries have faced an ever-increasing rate of publishing, sometimes called an <a href="information%20explosion">information explosion</a>. The advent of <a href="electronic%20publishing">electronic publishing</a> and the <a href="internet">internet</a> means that much new information is not printed in paper books, but is made available online through a <a href="digital%20library">digital library</a>, on <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a>, in the form of e-books or other online media. An <a href="on-line%20book">on-line book</a> is an e-book that is available online through the internet. Though many books are produced digitally, most digital versions are not available to the public, and there is no decline in the rate of paper publishing. There is an effort, however, to convert books that are in the <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a> into a digital medium for unlimited redistribution and infinite availability. This effort is spearheaded by <a href="Project%20Gutenberg">Project Gutenberg</a> combined with <a href="Distributed%20Proofreaders">Distributed Proofreaders</a>. There have also been new developments in the process of publishing books. Technologies such as POD or "<a href="print%20on%20demand">print on demand</a>", which make it possible to print as few as one book at a time, have made self-publishing (and <a href="vanity%20publishing">vanity publishing</a>) much easier and more affordable. On-demand publishing has allowed publishers, by avoiding the high costs of warehousing, to keep low-selling books in print rather than declaring them out of print.

The methods used for the printing and binding of books continued fundamentally unchanged from the 15th century into the early 20th century. While there was more <a href="mechanization">mechanization</a>, a <a href="book%20printer">book printer</a> in 1900 had much in common with <a href="Johannes%20Gutenberg">Gutenberg</a>. <a href="Printing%20press">Gutenberg's invention</a> was the use of movable metal types, assembled into words, lines, and pages and then printed by <a href="letterpress">letterpress</a> to create multiple copies. Modern paper books are printed on <a href="Printing%20and%20writing%20paper">papers</a> designed specifically for printed books. Traditionally, book papers are off-white or low-white papers (easier to read), are opaque to minimise the show-through of text from one side of the page to the other and are (usually) made to tighter <a href="caliper">caliper</a> or thickness specifications, particularly for case-bound books. Different paper qualities are used depending on the type of book: <a href="Machine%20finished%20coated%20paper">Machine finished coated paper</a>s, <a href="woodfree%20uncoated%20paper">woodfree uncoated paper</a>s, <a href="coated%20fine%20paper">coated fine paper</a>s and <a href="special%20fine%20paper">special fine paper</a>s are common paper grades.

Today, the majority of books are printed by <a href="offset%20lithography">offset lithography</a>. When a book is printed the pages are laid out on the plate so that after the printed sheet is folded the pages will be in the correct sequence. Books tend to be manufactured nowadays in a few standard sizes. The <a href="Book%20size">sizes of books</a> are usually specified as "trim size": the size of the page after the sheet has been folded and trimmed. The standard sizes result from sheet sizes (therefore machine sizes) which became popular 200 or 300 years ago, and have come to dominate the industry. British conventions in this regard prevail throughout the English-speaking world, except for the USA. The European book manufacturing industry works to a completely different set of standards.

Modern bound books are organized according to a particular format called the book's "layout". Although there is great variation in layout, modern books tend to adhere to as set of rules with regard to what the parts of the layout are and what their content usually includes. A basic layout will include a "front cover", a "back cover", and the book's content which is called its "body copy" or "content pages". The front cover often bears the book's title (and subtitle, if any) and the name of its author or editor(s). The "inside front cover" page is usually left blank in both hardcover and paperback books. The next section, if present, is the book's "front matter", which includes all textual material after the front cover but not part of the book's content— such things as a forward, a dedication, and a table of contents as well as publisher data such as the book's edition or printing number and place of publication. Between the body copy and the back cover goes the "end matter" which would include any indices, sets of tables, or diagrams, glossaries, or lists of cited works (though an edited book with multiple contributing authors usually places cited works at the end of each authored chapter). The "inside back cover" page, like that inside the front cover, is usually blank. The "back cover" itself is the usual place for the book's <a href="ISBN">ISBN</a>, and maybe a photograph of the author(s)/ editor(s), perhaps with a short introduction to them. Also here often appear plot summaries, barcodes, and excerpted reviews of the book.

Some books, particularly those with shorter runs (i.e. fewer copies) will be printed on sheet-fed offset presses, but most books are now printed on web presses, which are fed by a continuous roll of paper, and can consequently print more copies in a shorter time. As the production line circulates, a complete "book" is collected together in one stack, next to another, and another A <a href="web%20press">web press</a> carries out the folding itself, delivering bundles of "signatures" (sections) ready to go into the gathering line. Note that the pages of a book are printed two at a time, not as one complete book. Excess numbers are printed to make up for any spoilage due to make-readies or test pages to assure final print quality.

A "make-ready" is the preparatory work carried out by the pressmen to get the printing press up to the required quality of <a href="Impression%20%28publishing%29">impression</a>. Included in make-ready is the time taken to mount the plate onto the machine, clean up any mess from the previous job, and get the press up to speed. As soon as the pressman decides that the printing is correct, all the make-ready sheets will be discarded, and the press will start making books. Similar make readies take place in the folding and binding areas, each involving spoilage of paper.

After the signatures are folded and gathered, they move into the <a href="bindery">bindery</a>. In the middle of last century there were still many trade binders – stand-alone binding companies which did no printing, specializing in binding alone. At that time, because of the dominance of letterpress printing, typesetting and printing took place in one location, and binding in a different factory. When type was all metal, a typical book's worth of type would be bulky, fragile and heavy. The less it was moved in this condition the better: so printing would be carried out in the same location as the typesetting. Printed sheets on the other hand could easily be moved. Now, because of increasing <a href="Automation">computerization</a> of preparing a book for the printer, the typesetting part of the job has flowed upstream, where it is done either by separately contracting companies working for the publisher, by the publishers themselves, or even by the authors. Mergers in the book manufacturing industry mean that it is now unusual to find a bindery which is not also involved in book printing (and vice versa).

If the book is a <a href="hardcover">hardback</a> its path through the bindery will involve more points of activity than if it is a <a href="paperback">paperback</a>. Unsewn binding, is now increasingly common. The signatures of a book can also be held together by "Smyth sewing" using needles, "McCain sewing", using drilled holes often used in schoolbook binding, or "notch binding", where gashes about an inch long are made at intervals through the fold in the spine of each signature. The rest of the binding process is similar in all instances. Sewn and notch bound books can be bound as either hardbacks or paperbacks.

"Making cases" happens off-line and prior to the book's arrival at the binding line. In the most basic case-making, two pieces of cardboard are placed onto a glued piece of cloth with a space between them into which is glued a thinner board cut to the width of the spine of the book. The overlapping edges of the cloth (about 5/8" all round) are folded over the boards, and pressed down to adhere. After case-making the stack of cases will go to the <a href="foil%20stamping">foil stamping</a> area for adding decorations and type.

Recent developments in book manufacturing include the development of digital printing. Book pages are printed, in much the same way as an office copier works, using <a href="toner">toner</a> rather than ink. Each book is printed in one pass, not as separate signatures. Digital printing has permitted the manufacture of much smaller quantities than offset, in part because of the absence of make readies and of spoilage. One might think of a web press as printing quantities over 2000, quantities from 250 to 2000 being printed on sheet-fed presses, and digital presses doing quantities below 250. These numbers are of course only approximate and will vary from supplier to supplier, and from book to book depending on its characteristics. Digital printing has opened up the possibility of print-on-demand, where no books are printed until after an order is received from a customer.

In the 2000s, due to the rise in availability of affordable handheld computing devices, the opportunity to share texts through electronic means became a more appealing option for media publishers. Thus, the "e-book" was made. The term e-book is a contraction of "electronic book"; it refers to a book-length publication in digital form. An e-book is usually made available through the internet, but also on CD-ROM and other forms. E-Books may be read either via a computer or by means of a portable book display device known as an e-book reader, such as the <a href="Sony%20Reader">Sony Reader</a>, <a href="Barnes%20%26amp%3B%20Noble%20Nook">Barnes & Noble Nook</a>, <a href="Kobo%20eReader">Kobo eReader</a>, or the <a href="Amazon%20Kindle">Amazon Kindle</a>. These devices attempt to mimic the experience of reading a print book.

Book design is the art of incorporating the content, style, format, design, and sequence of the various components of a book into a coherent whole. In the words of Jan Tschichold, book design "though largely forgotten today, methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve have been developed over centuries. To produce perfect books these rules have to be brought back to life and applied." Richard Hendel describes book design as "an arcane subject" and refers to the need for a context to understand what that means. Many different creators can contribute to book design, including <a href="graphic%20design">graphic design</a>ers, <a href="artist">artist</a>s and editors.

The size of a modern book is based on the printing area of a common flatbed press. The pages of type were arranged and clamped in a frame, so that when printed on a sheet of paper the full size of the press, the pages would be right side up and in order when the sheet was folded, and the folded edges trimmed.

The most common book sizes are:

Sizes smaller than 16mo are:

Small books can be called booklets.

Sizes larger than quarto are:

The largest extant medieval manuscript in the world is <a href="Codex%20Gigas">Codex Gigas</a> 92 × 50 × 22 cm. The <a href="world%27s%20largest%20book">world's largest book</a> is made of stone and is in <a href="Kuthodaw%20Pagoda">Kuthodaw Pagoda</a> (<a href="Burma">Burma</a>).

A common separation by content are <a href="fiction">fiction</a> and <a href="non-fiction">non-fiction</a> books. This simple separation can be found in most <a href="collection%20%28museum%29">collections</a>, <a href="library">libraries</a>, and <a href="bookstore">bookstore</a>s.

Many of the books published today are fiction, meaning that they are in-part or completely untrue. Historically, paper production was considered too expensive to be used for <a href="entertainment">entertainment</a>. An increase in global <a href="literacy">literacy</a> and <a href="printing">print</a> technology led to the increased publication of books for the purpose of entertainment, and allegorical <a href="social%20commentary">social commentary</a>. Most fiction is additionally categorized by <a href="genre">genre</a>.

The <a href="novel">novel</a> is the most common form of fiction book. Novels are stories that typically feature a <a href="plot%20%28narrative%29">plot</a>, <a href="setting%20%28fiction%29">setting</a>, <a href="theme%20%28literature%29">themes</a> and <a href="character%20%28arts%29">characters</a>. Stories and narrative are not restricted to any topic; a novel can be whimsical, serious or <a href="controversy">controversial</a>. The novel has had a tremendous impact on entertainment and <a href="publishing">publishing</a> <a href="Market%20%28economics%29">market</a>s. A <a href="novella">novella</a> is a term sometimes used for fiction <a href="prose">prose</a> typically between 17,500 and 40,000 words, and a <a href="Novella">novelette</a> between 7,500 and 17,500. A <a href="short%20story">short story</a> may be any length up to 10,000 words, but these word lengths vary.

<a href="Comic%20book">Comic book</a>s or <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a>s are books in which the story is illustrated. The characters and narrators use speech or thought bubbles to express verbal language.

In a library, a <a href="reference%20book">reference book</a> is a general type of non-fiction book which provides information as opposed to telling a story, essay, commentary, or otherwise supporting a point of view. An <a href="almanac">almanac</a> is a very general reference book, usually one-volume, with lists of data and information on many topics. An <a href="encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> is a book or set of books designed to have more in-depth articles on many topics. A book listing <a href="word">word</a>s, their <a href="etymology">etymology</a>, meanings, and other information is called a <a href="dictionary">dictionary</a>. A book which is a collection of <a href="map">map</a>s is an <a href="atlas">atlas</a>. A more specific reference book with tables or lists of data and information about a certain topic, often intended for professional use, is often called a <a href="handbook">handbook</a>. Books which try to list references and abstracts in a certain broad area may be called an <a href="index%20%28publishing%29">index</a>, such as "Engineering Index", or <a href="abstract%20%28summary%29">abstracts</a> such as chemical abstracts and biological abstracts.
Books with technical information on how to do something or how to use some equipment are called <a href="instruction%20manual">instruction manual</a>s. Other popular <a href="how-to">how-to</a> books include <a href="cookbook">cookbook</a>s and <a href="home%20improvement">home improvement</a> books.

Students typically store and carry <a href="textbook">textbook</a>s and <a href="schoolbooks">schoolbooks</a> for study purposes. <a href="Elementary%20school">Elementary school</a> pupils often use <a href="workbook">workbook</a>s, which are published with spaces or blanks to be filled by them for study or <a href="homework">homework</a>. In US <a href="higher%20education">higher education</a>, it is common for a student to take an exam using a <a href="blue%20book%20exam">blue book</a>.

There is a large set of books that are made only to write private ideas, notes, and accounts. These books are rarely published and are typically destroyed or remain private. <a href="Notebook">Notebook</a>s are blank papers to be written in by the user. <a href="Student">Student</a>s and <a href="writer">writer</a>s commonly use them for taking notes. <a href="Scientist">Scientist</a>s and other researchers use <a href="lab%20notebook">lab notebook</a>s to record their notes. They often feature spiral coil bindings at the edge so that pages may easily be torn out.

<a href="Address%20book">Address book</a>s, <a href="phone%20book">phone book</a>s, and <a href="meeting">calendar/appointment</a> books are commonly used on a daily basis for recording appointments, meetings and personal <a href="Address%20%28geography%29">contact information</a>.

Books for recording periodic entries by the user, such as daily information about a journey, are called <a href="logbook">logbook</a>s or simply logs. A similar book for writing the owner's daily private personal events, information, and ideas is called a <a href="diary">diary</a> or <a href="personal%20journal">personal journal</a>.

<a href="Business">Business</a>es use <a href="accounting">accounting</a> books such as journals and <a href="ledger">ledger</a>s to record financial data in a practice called <a href="bookkeeping">bookkeeping</a>.

There are several other types of books which are not commonly found under this system. <a href="photograph%20album">Albums</a> are books for holding a group of items belonging to a particular theme, such as a set of <a href="photograph">photograph</a>s, card collections, and memorabilia. One common example is <a href="stamp%20album">stamp album</a>s, which are used by many hobbyists to protect and organize their collections of <a href="postage%20stamps">postage stamps</a>. Such albums are often made using removable plastic pages held inside in a ringed binder or other similar holder. Picture books are books for children with pictures on every page and less text (or even no text).

<a href="Hymnal">Hymnal</a>s are books with collections of <a href="music">music</a>al <a href="hymn">hymn</a>s that can typically be found in <a href="church%20%28building%29">churches</a>. <a href="Breviary">Prayerbooks</a> or <a href="missal">missal</a>s are books that contain written <a href="prayer">prayer</a>s and are commonly carried by <a href="monk">monk</a>s, <a href="nun">nun</a>s, and other devoted followers or <a href="clergy">clergy</a>.

<a href="Hardcover">Hardcover</a> books have a stiff binding. <a href="Paperback">Paperback</a> books have cheaper, flexible covers which tend to be less durable. An alternative to paperback is the glossy cover, otherwise known as a dust cover, found on magazines, and comic books. Spiral-bound books are bound by spirals made of metal or plastic. Examples of spiral-bound books include teachers' manuals and <a href="puzzle%20book">puzzle book</a>s (<a href="crossword">crossword</a>s, <a href="sudoku">sudoku</a>).

<a href="Publishing">Publishing</a> is a process for producing pre-printed books, <a href="magazines">magazines</a>, and newspapers for the reader/user to buy.

Publishers may produce low-cost, pre-publication copies known as <a href="galley%20proof">galleys</a> or 'bound proofs' for promotional purposes, such as generating reviews in advance of publication. Galleys are usually made as cheaply as possible, since they are not intended for sale.

Private or personal libraries made up of non-fiction and fiction books, (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in <a href="archive">archive</a>s) first appeared in <a href="classical%20Greece">classical Greece</a>. In the ancient world, the maintaining of a <a href="library">library</a> was usually (but not exclusively) the privilege of a wealthy individual. These libraries could have been either private or public, i.e. for people who were interested in using them. The difference from a modern <a href="public%20library">public library</a> lies in the fact that they were usually not funded from public sources. It is estimated that in the city of Rome at the end of the 3rd century there were around 30 public libraries. Public libraries also existed in other cities of the ancient <a href="History%20of%20the%20Mediterranean%20region">Mediterranean region</a> (for example, <a href="Library%20of%20Alexandria">Library of Alexandria</a>). Later, in the Middle Ages, monasteries and universities had also libraries that could be accessible to general public. Typically not the whole collection was available to public, the books could not be borrowed and often were chained to reading stands to prevent theft.

The beginning of modern public library begins around 15th century when individuals started to donate books to towns. The growth of a <a href="public%20library">public library</a> system in the United States started in the late 19th century and was much helped by donations from <a href="Andrew%20Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a>. This reflected classes in a society: The poor or the middle class had to access most books through a public library or by other means while the rich could afford to have a <a href="private%20library">private library</a> built in their homes. In the United States the Boston Public Library 1852 "Report of the Trustees" established the justification for the public library as a tax-supported institution intended to extend educational opportunity and provide for general culture.

The advent of <a href="paperback">paperback</a> books in the 20th century led to an explosion of popular publishing. Paperback books made owning books affordable for many people. Paperback books often included works from genres that had previously been published mostly in <a href="pulp%20magazines">pulp magazines</a>. As a result of the low cost of such books and the spread of bookstores filled with them (in addition to the creation of a smaller market of extremely cheap used paperbacks) owning a private library ceased to be a status symbol for the rich.

In library and booksellers' catalogues, it is common to include an abbreviation such as "Crown 8vo" to indicate the <a href="paper%20size">paper size</a> from which the book is made.

When rows of books are lined on a book holder, <a href="bookend">bookend</a>s are sometimes needed to keep them from slanting.

During the 20th century, <a href="librarian">librarian</a>s were concerned about keeping track of the many books being added yearly to the <a href="Gutenberg%20Galaxy">Gutenberg Galaxy</a>. Through a global society called the <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20Library%20Associations%20and%20Institutions">International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions</a> (IFLA), they devised a series of tools including the <a href="International%20Standard%20Bibliographic%20Description">International Standard Bibliographic Description</a> (ISBD). Each book is specified by an International Standard Book Number, or ISBN, which is unique to every edition of every book produced by participating publishers, worldwide. It is managed by the ISBN Society. An ISBN has four parts: the first part is the country code, the second the <a href="publisher">publisher</a> code, and the third the title code. The last part is a <a href="check%20digit">check digit</a>, and can take values from 0–9 and X (10). The <a href="European%20Article%20Number">EAN</a> <a href="Barcode">Barcode</a>s numbers for books are derived from the ISBN by prefixing 978, for <a href="Bookland">Bookland</a>, and calculating a new check digit.

Commercial publishers in industrialized countries generally assign ISBNs to their books, so buyers may presume that the ISBN is part of a total international system, with no exceptions. However, many government publishers, in industrial as well as developing countries, do not participate fully in the ISBN system, and publish books which do not have ISBNs. A large or public collection requires a <a href="Library%20catalog">catalogue</a>. Codes called "call numbers" relate the books to the catalogue, and determine their locations on the shelves. Call numbers are based on a <a href="Library%20classification">Library classification</a> system. The call number is placed on the spine of the book, normally a short distance before the bottom, and inside. Institutional or national standards, such as <a href="American%20National%20Standards%20Institute">ANSI</a>/<a href="NISO">NISO</a> Z39.41 - 1997, establish the correct way to place information (such as the <a href="title%20%28publishing%29">title</a>, or the name of the author) on book spines, and on "shelvable" book-like objects, such as containers for <a href="DVD">DVD</a>s, <a href="video%20tape">video tape</a>s and <a href="software">software</a>.

One of the earliest and most widely known systems of cataloguing books is the <a href="Dewey%20Decimal%20Classification">Dewey Decimal System</a>. Another widely known system is the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress%20Classification">Library of Congress Classification</a> system. Both systems are biased towards subjects which were well represented in US libraries when they were developed, and hence have problems handling new subjects, such as computing, or subjects relating to other cultures. Information about books and authors can be stored in databases like <a href="online%20general-interest%20book%20database">online general-interest book database</a>s. <a href="Metadata">Metadata</a>, which means "data about data" is information about a book. Metadata about a book may include its title, ISBN or other classification number (see above), the names of contributors (author, editor, illustrator) and publisher, its date and size, the language of the text, its subject matter, etc.


Aside from the primary purpose of reading them, books are also used for other ends:

Once the book is published, it is put on the market by the distributors and the bookstores. Meanwhile, his promotion comes from various media reports. Book marketing is governed by the law in many states.

In recent years, the book had a second life in the form of reading aloud. This is called public readings of published works, with the assistance of professional readers (often known actors) and in close collaboration with writers, publishers, booksellers, librarians, leaders of the literary world and artists.

Many individual or collective practices exist to increase the number of readers of a book. Among them:

This form of the book chain has hardly changed since the eighteenth century, and has not always been this way. Thus, the author has asserted gradually with time, and the copyright dates only from the nineteenth century. For many centuries, especially before the invention of printing, each freely copied out books that passed through his hands, adding if necessary his own comments. Similarly, bookseller and publisher jobs have emerged with the invention of printing, which made the book an industrial product, requiring structures of production and marketing.

The invention of the Internet, e-readers, tablets, and projects like Wikipedia and Gutenberg, are likely to strongly change the book industry in the years to come.

Paper was first made in China as early as 200 BC, and reached Europe through <a href="History%20of%20Islam">Muslim</a> territories. At first made of rags, the <a href="industrial%20revolution">industrial revolution</a> changed paper-making practices, allowing for paper to be made out of wood pulp. Papermaking in Europe began in the 11th century, although <a href="vellum">vellum</a> was also common there as page material up until the beginning of the 16th century, vellum being the more expensive and durable option. Printers or publishers would often issue the same publication on both materials, to cater to more than one market.

Paper made from <a href="wood%20pulp">wood pulp</a> became popular in the early 20th century, because it was cheaper than <a href="linen">linen</a> or <a href="abaca">abaca</a> cloth-based papers. Pulp-based paper made books less expensive to the general public. This paved the way for huge leaps in the rate of literacy in industrialised nations, and enabled the spread of information during the <a href="Second%20Industrial%20Revolution">Second Industrial Revolution</a>.

Pulp paper, however, contains acid which eventually destroys the paper from within. Earlier techniques for making paper used <a href="limestone">limestone</a> rollers, which neutralized the acid in the pulp. Books printed between 1850 and 1950 are primarily at risk; more recent books are often printed on acid-free or <a href="alkaline">alkaline</a> paper. Libraries today have to consider <a href="mass%20deacidification">mass deacidification</a> of their older collections in order to prevent decay.

Stability of the climate is critical to the long-term preservation of paper and book material. Good air circulation is important to keep fluctuation in climate stable. The <a href="HVAC">HVAC</a> system should be up to date and functioning efficiently. Light is detrimental to collections. Therefore, care should be given to the collections by implementing light control. General housekeeping issues can be addressed, including <a href="pest%20control">pest control</a>. In addition to these helpful solutions, a library must also make an effort to be prepared if a disaster occurs, one that they cannot control. Time and effort should be given to create a concise and effective disaster plan to counteract any damage incurred through "acts of God" therefore an <a href="emergency%20management">emergency management</a> plan should be in place.

Bal Thackeray

Bal Keshav Thackeray (; 23 January 1926 – 17 November 2012) was an Indian politician who founded the <a href="Shiv%20Sena">Shiv Sena</a>, a <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> right-wing <a href="Marathi%20people">Marathi</a> <a href="Ethnocentrism">ethnocentric</a> party active mainly in the western state of <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>.

Thackeray began his professional career as a <a href="cartoonist">cartoonist</a> with the English language daily "<a href="The%20Free%20Press%20Journal">The Free Press Journal</a>" in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, but left it in 1960 to form his own political weekly "<a href="Marmik%20%28periodical%29">Marmik</a>". His political philosophy was largely shaped by his father <a href="Keshav%20Sitaram%20Thackeray">Keshav Sitaram Thackeray</a>, a leading figure in the <a href="Samyukta%20Maharashtra%20Samiti">Samyukta Maharashtra</a> (United Maharashtra) movement, which advocated the creation of a separate linguistic state. Through "Marmik", he campaigned against the growing influence of non-Marathis in Mumbai. In 1966, Thackeray formed the Shiv Sena party to advocate for the interests of <a href="Maharashtrians">Maharashtrians</a> in Mumbai's political and professional landscape. Holding views attacking Muslims and once praising Adolf Hitler, he was known for his writings and was seen as a good orator. He had a large political influence in the state, especially in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>; his party frequently used violent means against its detractors. Thackeray was blamed for inciting violence against Muslims during the 1992–1993 <a href="Bombay%20riots">Bombay riots</a> in the Srikrishna Commission Report, an inquiry by the government.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Thackeray built the party by forming temporary alliances with nearly all of state's political parties. Thackeray was also the founder of the Marathi-language newspaper "<a href="Saamana">Saamana</a>". After the riots of 1992-3, he and his party took a <a href="Hindutva">Hindutva</a> stance. In 1999, Thackeray was banned from voting and contesting in any election for six years on the recommendations of the Election Commission for indulging in seeking votes in the name of religion. Besides getting arrested multiple times and briefly going to prison, Thackeray never faced any major legal repercussions for his actions. Upon his death, he was accorded a <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a> with a large number of mourners present. Thackeray did not hold any official position and never was formally elected as the leader of his party.

Thackeray was born in <a href="Pune">Pune</a> on 23 January 1926 to Ramabai and <a href="Keshav%20Sitaram%20Thackeray">Keshav Sitaram Thackeray</a> (also known as 'Prabodhankar'). He was the eldest of nine siblings and belonged to the Marathi <a href="Chandraseniya%20Kayastha%20Prabhu">Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhu</a> or CKP community. Keshav was a progressive social activist and writer who was involved in the <a href="Samyukta%20Maharashtra%20Movement">Samyukta Maharashtra Movement</a> of the 1950s that argued for the creation of a unified state called Maharashtra for <a href="Marathi%20language">Marathi</a>-speaking areas with <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> as its capital. Keshav's political philosophy inspired Thackeray.

Thackeray began his career as a cartoonist in the "<a href="Free%20Press%20Journal">Free Press Journal</a>" in Mumbai. His cartoons were also published in the Sunday edition of "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>". In 1960, he launched the cartoon weekly "<a href="Marmik">Marmik</a>" with his brother Srikant. He used it to campaign against the growing numbers and influence of non-Marathi people in Mumbai, targeting south Indians. After Thackeray's differences with the "Free Press Journal", he and four or five people, including politician <a href="George%20Fernandes">George Fernandes</a>, left the paper and started their own daily "News Day". The paper survived for one or two months.

The success of "Marmik" prompted him to form the <a href="Shiv%20Sena">Shiv Sena</a> on 19 June 1966. The name "Shiv Sena" (<a href="Shivaji">Shivaji</a>'s Army) was after the 17th century renowned local <a href="Maratha%20Empire">Maratha</a> king. Initially, Thackeray said it was not a political party but an army of Shivaji, inclined to fight for the Marathi "manoos" (person). It demanded that native speakers of the state's local language <a href="Marathi%20language">Marathi</a> (the "sons of the soil" movement) be given preferential treatment in private and public sector jobs. The early objective of the Shiv Sena was to ensure their job security competing against <a href="south%20Indian">south Indian</a>s and <a href="Gujaratis">Gujaratis</a>. In its 1966 party manifesto, Thackeray primarily blamed south Indians. In "Marmik", Thackeray published a list of corporate officials from a local directory, many being south Indians, citing it as proof that Maharashtrians were being discriminated against.

His party grew in the next ten years. Senior leaders such as <a href="Babasaheb%20Purandare">Babasaheb Purandare</a>, chief attorney for Trade Union of Maharashtra Madhav Mehere joined the party and chartered architect Madhav Gajanan Deshpande backed various aspects of the party operations. In 1969, Thackeray and <a href="Manohar%20Joshi">Manohar Joshi</a> were jailed after participating in a protest demanding the merger of <a href="Karwar">Karwar</a>, <a href="Belgaum%20border%20dispute">Belgaum</a> and <a href="Nipani">Nipani</a> regions in Maharashtra. During the 1970s, it did not succeed in the local elections and it was active mainly in Bombay, compared to the rest of the state. The party set up local branch offices and settled disputes, complaints against the government. It later started violent tactics with attacks against rival parties, migrants and the media; the party agitated by destroying public and private property. Thackeray publicly supported <a href="Indira%20Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a> during the <a href="The%20Emergency%20%28India%29">1975 Emergency</a> to avoid getting arrested; Thackeray supported the <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">Congress party</a> numerous times.

Politically, the Shiv Sena was <a href="Anti-communism">anti-communist</a>, and wrested control of trade unions in Mumbai from the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20India">Communist Party of India (CPI)</a>. Local unemployed youth from the declining textile industry joined the party and it further expanded because of Marathi migrants from the <a href="Konkan">Konkan region</a>. By the 1980s, it became a threat to the ruling Congress party which initially encouraged it because of it rivalling the CPI. In 1989, the Sena's newspaper "<a href="Saamna">Saamna</a>" was launched by Thackeray. Because of Thackeray being against the <a href="Mandal%20Commission">Mandal Commission</a> report, his close aide <a href="Chhagan%20Bhujbal">Chhagan Bhujbal</a> left the party in 1991. Following the <a href="Bombay%20Riots">1992 Bombay riots</a>, Thackeray took stances viewed as anti-Muslim and based on <a href="Hindutva">Hindutva</a>. The SS later allied itself with the <a href="Bharatiya%20Janata%20Party">Bharatiya Janata Party</a> (BJP). The BJP-Shiv Sena alliance won the 1995 <a href="Maharashtra%20Vidhan%20Sabha">Maharashtra State Assembly</a> elections and were in power from 1995 to 1999. Thackeray declared himself to be the "remote control" chief minister. Thackeray and the Shiv Sena were blamed for inciting violence against Muslims during the 1992–1993 riots in an inquiry ordered by the <a href="government%20of%20India">government of India</a>, the Srikrishna Commission Report.

He had influence in the film industry. His party workers agitated against films he found controversial and would disrupt film screenings, causing losses. <a href="Bombay%20%28film%29">"Bombay"</a>, a 1995 film on the riots was opposed by them.

On 28 July 1999 Thackeray was banned from voting and contesting in any election for six years from 11 December 1999 till 10 December 2005 on the recommendations of the Election Commission for indulging in corrupt practice by seeking votes in the name of religion. In 2000, he was arrested for his role in the riots but was released because the <a href="statute%20of%20limitations">statute of limitations</a> expired. In 2002, Thackeray issued a call to form Hindu <a href="suicide%20bomber">suicide bomber</a> squads to take on the menace of terrorism. In response, the Maharashtra government registered a case against him for inciting enmity between different groups. At least two organisations founded and managed by retired Indian Army officers, Lt Col Jayant Rao Chitale and Lt Gen. P.N. Hoon (former commander-in-chief of the Western Command), responded to the call with such statements as not allowing Pakistanis to work in India due to accusations against Pakistan for supporting attacks in India by militants. After the six-year voting ban on Thackeray was lifted in 2005, he voted for the first time in the 2007 <a href="Brihanmumbai%20Municipal%20Corporation">BMC</a> elections. Eight or nine cases against Thackeray and "Saamna" for inflammatory writings were not investigated by the government.

Thackeray said that the Shiv Sena had helped the Marathi people in Mumbai, especially in the public sector.<ref name="Public sector, Threats against other communities, businesses owned especially by Guj and Marwaris/"></ref> Thackeray believed that Hindus must be organised to struggle against those who oppose their identity and religion. Opposition leftist parties alleged that the Shiv Sena has done little to solve the problem of unemployment facing a large proportion of Maharashtrian youth during its tenure, in contradiction to its ideological foundation of 'sons of the soil.'

In 2006, Thackeray's nephew <a href="Raj%20Thackeray">Raj Thackeray</a> broke away from Shiv Sena to form the <a href="Maharashtra%20Navnirman%20Sena">Maharashtra Navnirman Sena</a> (MNS) during Thackeray's retirement and appointment of his son, <a href="Uddhav%20Thackeray">Uddhav</a> rather than Raj as the leader of Shiv Sena. <a href="Narayan%20Rane">Narayan Rane</a> also quit around that time.

The Sena acted as a "<a href="moral%20police">moral police</a>" and opposed Valentine's Day celebrations. On 14 February 2006, Thackeray condemned and apologised for the violent attacks by its Shiv Sainiks on a private celebration in Mumbai. "It is said that women were beaten up in the Nallasopara incident. If that really happened, then it is a symbol of cowardice. I have always instructed Shiv Sainiks that in any situation women should not be humiliated and harassed." Thackeray and the Shiv Sena remained opposed to it, although they indicated support for an "Indian alternative."

In 2007, he was briefly arrested and let out on bail after referring to Muslims as "green poison" during a Shiv Sena rally.

On 27 March 2008, in protest to Thackeray's editorial, leaders of Shiv Sena in <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a> resigned, citing its "outrageous conduct" towards non-Marathis in Maharashtra and announced that they would form a separate party. Addressing a press conference, Shiv Sena's North India chief Jai Bhagwan Goyal said the decision to leave the party was taken because of the "partial attitude" of the party high command towards Maharashtrians. Goyal further said "Shiv Sena is no different from <a href="Khalistan">Khalistan</a> and Jammu and Kashmir militant groups which are trying to create a rift between people along regional lines. The main aim of these forces is to split our country. Like the <a href="Maharashtra%20Navnirman%20Sena">Maharashtra Navnirman Sena</a>, the Shiv Sena too has demeaned North Indians and treated them inhumanely."

Thackeray died on 17 November 2012 as a consequence of a <a href="cardiac%20arrest">cardiac arrest</a>. Mumbai came to a virtual halt immediately as the news broke out about his death, with shops and commercial establishments shutting down. The entire state of Maharashtra was put on high alert. The police appealed for calm and 20,000 <a href="Mumbai%20police">Mumbai police</a> officers, 15 units of the State Reserve Police Force and three contingents of the <a href="Rapid%20Action%20Force">Rapid Action Force</a> were deployed. It was reported that Shiv Sena workers forced shops to close down in some areas. The then Prime Minister <a href="Manmohan%20Singh">Manmohan Singh</a> called for calm in the city and praised Thackeray's "strong leadership", while there were also statements of praise and condolences from other senior politicians such as the then Gujarat Chief Minister <a href="Narendra%20Modi">Narendra Modi</a> and the BJP leader and MP, <a href="L.%20K.%20Advani">L. K. Advani</a>.

He was accorded a <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a> at <a href="Shivaji%20Park">Shivaji Park</a>, which generated some controversy and resulted from demands made by Shiv Sena. It was the first public funeral in the city since that of <a href="Bal%20Gangadhar%20Tilak">Bal Gangadhar Tilak</a> in 1920. Thackeray's body was moved to the park on 18 November. Many mourners attended his funeral, although there were no official figures. The range reported in media sources varied from around 1 million, to 1.5 million and as many as nearly 2 million. His cremation took place the next day, where his son Uddhav lit the pyre. Among those present at his cremation were senior representatives of the <a href="Government%20of%20Maharashtra">Maharashtra government</a> and the event was broadcast live on national television channels. The Parliament of India opened for its winter session on 21 November 2012. Thackeray was the only non-member to be noted in its traditional list of obituaries. He is one of few people to have been recorded thus without being a member of either the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha. Despite having not held any official position, he was given the <a href="21-gun%20salute">21-gun salute</a>, which was again a rare honour. Both houses of <a href="Bihar">Bihar</a> Assembly also paid tribute. The funeral expenses created further controversies when media reports claimed that the <a href="Brihanmumbai%20Municipal%20Corporation">BMC</a> had used taxpayers' money. In response to these reports, the party later sent a cheque of Rs. 500,000 to the Corporation.

"<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>," in an editorial, said regarding the shutdown that "Thackeray’s legion of followers raised him to the status of a demigod who could force an entire State to shut down with the mere threat of violence". Following his death, police arrested a 21-year-old woman who posted a Facebook comment against him, as well as her friend who "liked" the comment. Shiv Sena members also vandalised the clinic owned by the woman's relative.

Thackeray was called 'Balasaheb' and "Hindu Hruday Samrat" ("Emperor of Hindu Hearts") by his supporters. His yearly address at <a href="Shivaji%20Park">Shivaji Park</a> was popular among his followers. In 2012, he instead gave a video-taped speech and urged his followers "to give the same love and affection to his son and political heir Uddhav as they had given him". Thackeray was known to convert popular sentiment into votes, getting into controversies and making no apologies for it though his son has tried to tone down the party's stance after his death. He was known for his inflammatory writings, was seen as a good orator who used cruel humour to engage his audience. He had a large political influence throughout the state, especially in Mumbai. His party never had any formal internal elections nor was he ever formally elected as its chief at any point. <a href="Gyan%20Prakash">Gyan Prakash</a> said, "Of course, the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement had mobilized Marathi speakers as a political entity, but it was Thackeray who successfully deployed it as an anti-immigrant, populist force."

Following Thackeray's death in 2012, the Pakistani newspaper "Express Tribune" published an editorial defining him as a "bigot" who instigated racism and violence against Muslims.

A memorial for him was proposed at Shivaji Park but legal issues and opposition from local residents continue to delay it.

Thackeray is satirised in <a href="Salman%20Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a>'s 1995 novel "<a href="The%20Moor%27s%20Last%20Sigh">The Moor's Last Sigh</a>" as 'Raman Fielding'. The book was banned by the Maharashtra state government. <a href="Suketu%20Mehta">Suketu Mehta</a> interviewed Thackeray in his critically acclaimed, <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer-nominated</a>, non-fiction 2004 book "<a href="Maximum%20City">Maximum City</a>". Thackeray previewed director <a href="Ram%20Gopal%20Verma">Ram Gopal Verma's</a> film "<a href="Sarkar%20%28film%29">Sarkar</a>", which is loosely based on him, released in 2005. The 2011 documentary "<a href="Jai%20Bhim%20Comrade">Jai Bhim Comrade</a>" depicted a speech by Thackeray at a public rally, in which he articulated "genocidal sentiments" about Muslims, stating that they were the "species to be exterminated." The documentary followed this by showing several <a href="Dalit">Dalit</a> leaders criticizing Thackeray for his beliefs.

Thackeray was married to Meena Thackeray (née Vaidya) and had three sons, Bindumadhav, Jaidev and <a href="Uddhav%20Thackeray">Uddhav</a>. Meena died in 1995 and Bindumadhav died the following year in a car accident. Uddhav succeeded his father as the leader of Shiv Sena.Uddhav's son, <a href="Aditya%20Thackeray">Aditya</a> wants to continue the family dynasty by getting active in the youth wing of the party

<a href="Raj%20Thackeray">Raj</a> is his brother Srikant's son. Despite Raj's breakaway from the main party, Raj continues to maintain that Thackeray was his ideologue and relations between them improved during Thackeray's final years.

Thackeray drew cartoons for "Marmik" and contributed to "Saamna" till 2012. He cited the British cartoonist <a href="David%20Low%20%28cartoonist%29">David Low</a> as his inspiration. He was fond of beer and cigars.

Thackeray was criticised for his praise of <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> which he later neither admitted nor denied. He was quoted by "<a href="Asiaweek">Asiaweek</a>" as saying: "I am a great admirer of Hitler, and I am not ashamed to say so! I do not say that I agree with all the methods he employed, but he was a wonderful organiser and orator, and I feel that he and I have several things in common...What India really needs is a <a href="dictator">dictator</a> who will rule benevolently, but with an iron hand." However, "<a href="Indian%20Express">Indian Express</a>" published an interview 29 January 2007: "Hitler did very cruel and ugly things. But he was an artist, I love him [for that]. He had the power to carry the whole nation, the mob with him. You have to think what magic he had. He was a miracle...The killing of Jews was wrong. But the good part about Hitler was that he was an artist. He was a daredevil. He had good qualities and bad. I may also have good qualities and bad ones."

Thackeray also declared that he was "not against every Muslim, but only those who reside in this country but do not obey the laws of the land...I consider such people [to be] traitors." The Shiv Sena is viewed by the liberal media as being anti-Muslim, though Shiv sena members officially reject this accusation. When explaining his views on <a href="Hindutva">Hindutva</a>, he conflated Islam with violence and called on Hindus to "fight terrorism and fight Islam." In an interview with Suketu Mehta, he called for the mass expulsion of illegal Bangladeshi Muslim migrants from India and for a <a href="visa%20%28document%29">visa</a> system to enter Mumbai, the Indian National Congress state government had earlier during the Indira Gandhi declared national emergency considered a similar measure.

He told "<a href="India%20Today">India Today</a>" "[Muslims] are spreading like a cancer and should be operated on like a cancer. The...country should be saved from the Muslims and the police should support them [Hindu Maha Sangh] in their struggle just like the police in Punjab were sympathetic to the Khalistanis." However, in an interview in 1998, he said that his stance had changed on many issues that the Shiv Sena had with Muslims, particularly regarding the Babri Mosque or <a href="Ram%20Janmabhoomi">Ram Janmabhoomi</a> issue: "We must look after the Muslims and treat them as part of us." He also expressed admiration for Muslims in Mumbai in the wake of the <a href="11%20July%202006%20Mumbai%20train%20bombings">11 July 2006 Mumbai train bombings</a> perpetrated by <a href="Islamic%20fundamentalism">Islamic fundamentalists</a>. In response to threats made by <a href="Abu%20Azmi">Abu Azmi</a>, a leader of the <a href="Samajwadi%20Party">Samajwadi Party</a>, that accusations of terrorism directed at Indian Muslims would bring about communal strife, Thackeray said that the unity of Mumbaikars (residents of Mumbai) in the wake of the attacks was "a slap to fanatics of Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi" and that Thackeray "salute[s] those Muslims who participated in the two minutes' silence on July 18 to mourn the blast victims." Again in 2008 he wrote: "Islamic terrorism is growing and Hindu terrorism is the only way to counter it. We need suicide bomb squads to protect India and Hindus." He also reiterated a desire for Hindus to unite across linguistic barriers to see "a Hindustan for Hindus" and to "bring Islam in this country down to its knees."

In 2008, following agitation against Biharis and other north Indians travelling to Maharashtra to take civil service examinations for the <a href="Indian%20Railways">Indian Railways</a> due to an overlimit of the quota in their home provinces, Thackeray also said of Bihari MPs that they were "spitting in the same plate from which they ate" when they criticised Mumbaikars and Maharashtrians. He wrote: "They are trying to add fuel to the fire that has been extinguished, by saying that Mumbaikars have rotten brains." He also criticised <a href="Chhath%20Puja">Chhath Puja</a>, a holiday celebrated by Biharis and those from eastern Uttar Pradesh, which occurs on six days of the Hindu month of Kartik. He said that it was not a real holiday. This was reportedly a response to MPs from Bihar who had disrupted the proceedings of the <a href="Lok%20Sabha">Lok Sabha</a> in protest to the attacks on North Indians. Bihar Chief Minister <a href="Nitish%20Kumar">Nitish Kumar</a>, upset with the remarks, called on the prime minister and the central government to intervene in the matter. A "Saamna" editorial prompted at least 16 MPs from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, belonging to the <a href="Rashtriya%20Janata%20Dal">Rashtriya Janata Dal</a>, <a href="Janata%20Dal%20%28United%29">Janata Dal (United)</a>, Samajwadi Party and the <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">Indian National Congress</a>, to give notice for <a href="breach%20of%20privilege">breach of privilege</a> proceedings against Thackeray. After the matter was raised in the Lok Sabha, <a href="Speaker%20of%20Lok%20Sabha">Speaker</a> <a href="Somnath%20Chatterjee">Somnath Chatterjee</a> said: "If anybody has made any comment on our members' functioning in the conduct of business in the House, not only do we treat that with the contempt that it deserves, but also any action that may be necessary will be taken according to procedure and well established norms. Nobody will be spared.'"

In 2009, he criticised Marathi cricketer <a href="Sachin%20Tendulkar">Sachin Tendulkar</a> for saying he was an Indian before he was a Maharashtrian.

Bitola

Bitola ( known also by several <a href="%23Etymology">alternative names</a>) is a city in the southwestern part of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a>. It is located in the southern part of the <a href="Pelagonia">Pelagonia</a> valley, surrounded by the <a href="Baba%20Mountain%2C%20Macedonia">Baba</a>, <a href="Nid%C5%BEe">Nidže</a> and <a href="Kajmak%C4%8Dalan">Kajmakčalan</a> mountain ranges, north of the <a href="Med%C5%BEitlija-N%C3%ADki">Medžitlija-Níki</a> border crossing with <a href="Greece">Greece</a>. The city stands at an important junction connecting the south of the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> region with the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> and <a href="Central%20Europe">Central Europe</a>, and is an administrative, cultural, industrial, commercial, and educational centre. It has been known since the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> period as "The City of The Consuls", since many European countries had consulates in Bitola. <br>
Bitola is one of the oldest cities on the territory of The Republic of Macedonia, having been founded as <a href="Heraclea%20Lyncestis">Heraclea Lyncestis</a> in the middle of the 4th century BC by <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a>. The city was the last capital of <a href="Ottoman%20Rumelia">Ottoman Rumelia</a>, from 1836–1867. According to the 2002 census, Bitola is the <a href="List%20of%20cities%20in%20the%20Republic%20of%20Macedonia%20by%20population">second-largest city</a> in the country. Bitola is also the seat of the <a href="Bitola%20Municipality">Bitola Municipality</a>.

The name "Bitola" is derived from the <a href="Old%20Church%20Slavonic">Old Church Slavonic</a> word ("obitěĺь", meaning "monastery, cloister") as the city was formerly noted for its monastery. When the meaning of the name was no longer understood, it lost its prefix "o-". The name "Bitola" is mentioned in the <a href="Bitola%20inscription">Bitola inscription</a>, related to the old city fortress built in 1015. Modern Slavic variants include the <a href="Macedonian%20language">Macedonian</a> "Bitola" (Битола), the <a href="Serbian%20language">Serbian</a> "Bitolj" (Битољ) and <a href="Bulgarian%20language">Bulgarian</a> "Bitolya" (Битоля). In <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> times, the name was Hellenized to "Voutélion" (Βουτέλιον) or "Vitólia" (Βιτώλια), hence the names "Butella" used by <a href="William%20of%20Tyre">William of Tyre</a> and "Butili" by the Arab geographer <a href="Muhammad%20al-Idrisi">al-Idrisi</a>. During the ruling of Radomir Gavril(1014–1015) Bitola is mentioned under the name of Buteliu. 
The <a href="Aromanian%20language">Aromanian</a> name is "Bituli".

The <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> name for the city ("Monastíri", Μοναστήρι), also meaning "monastery", is a <a href="calque">calque</a> of the Slavic name. The <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a> name "Manastır" () is derived from the Greek name, as is the <a href="Albanian%20language">Albanian</a> name ("Manastir").

Bitola is located in the southwestern part of Macedonia. The <a href="Dragor%20River">Dragor River</a> flows through the city. Bitola lies at an elevation of 615 meters above sea level, at the foot of <a href="Baba%20Mountain%2C%20Macedonia">Baba Mountain</a>. Its magnificent <a href="Pelister">Pelister</a> mountain (2601 m) is a national park with exquisite flora and fauna, among which is the rarest species of pine, known as <a href="Macedonian%20pine">Macedonian pine</a> or <a href="pinus%20peuce">pinus peuce</a>, as well as a well-known ski resort.

Covering an area of . and with a population of 122,173 (1991), Bitola is an important industrial, agricultural, commercial, educational, and cultural center. It represents an important junction that connects the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a> to the south with the <a href="Aegean%20Sea">Aegean Sea</a> and <a href="Central%20Europe">Central Europe</a>.

Bitola has a mild continental climate typical of the Pelagonija region, experiencing warm and dry summers, and cold and snowy winters. The Koppen classification for this climate is Cfb.

Bitola is very rich in monuments from the prehistoric period. Two important ones are <a href="Velu%C5%A1ka%20Tumba">Veluška Tumba</a>, and <a href="Bara%20Tumba">Bara Tumba</a> near the village of Porodin. From the <a href="Copper%20Age">Copper Age</a> there are the settlements of Tumba near the village of Crnobuki, Šuplevec near the village of Suvodol, and Visok Rid near the village of Bukri. The <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> is represented by the settlements of Tumba near the village of Kanino and the settlement with the same name near the village of Karamani.

The area of the town is located in ancient <a href="Lynkestis">Lynkestis</a>, a region of <a href="Upper%20Macedonia">Upper Macedonia</a>, which was ruled by semi-independent chieftains till the later <a href="Argead%20dynasty">Argead</a> rulers of <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedon</a>. The tribes of Lynkestis were known as "Lynkestai". They were a <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> tribe and belonged to the <a href="Molossians">Molossian</a> group of the <a href="Epirotes">Epirotes</a>. There are important metal artifacts from the ancient period at the necropolis of Crkvishte near the village of Beranci. A golden earring dating from the 4th century BC is depicted on the <a href="Obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse</a> of the Macedonian 10 <a href="Macedonian%20denar">denar</a> banknote, issued in 1996.

<a href="Heraclea%20Lyncestis">Heraclea Lyncestis</a> ( - "City of Hercules upon the Land of the Lynx") was an important settlement from the <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic period</a> till the early <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. It was founded by <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a> by the middle of the 4th century BC, and named after the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> hero <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a>. With its strategic location, it became a prosperous city. The <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> conquered this part of Macedon in 148 BC and destroyed the political power of the city. However, its prosperity continued mainly due to the Roman <a href="Via%20Egnatia">Via Egnatia</a> road which passed near the city. Several monuments from the Roman times remain in Heraclea, including a <a href="portico">portico</a>, <a href="thermae">thermae</a> (baths), an <a href="amphitheater">amphitheater</a> and a number of <a href="basilica">basilica</a>s. The theatre was once capable of housing an audience of around 3,000 people.

In the early <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a> period (4th to 6th centuries AD) Heraclea was an important episcopal centre. Some of its bishops were mentioned in the acts of the Church Councils, including Bishop Evagrius of Heraclea in the Acts of the <a href="Archbishopric%20of%20Sardica%23Council%20of%20Sardica">Sardica Council</a> of 343 AD. A small and a great (Large) basilica, the bishop's residence, and a funeral basilica near the necropolis are some of the remains of this period. Three <a href="nave">nave</a>s in the Great Basilica are covered with <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a>s of very rich floral and figurative <a href="iconography">iconography</a>; these well preserved mosaics are often regarded as fine examples of the early <a href="Christian%20art">Christian art</a> period. During the 4th and 6th centuries, the names of other bishops from Heraclea were recorded. The city was sacked by <a href="Ostrogoths">Ostrogothic</a> forces, commanded by <a href="Theodoric%20the%20Great">Theodoric the Great</a> in 472 and, despite a large gift to him from the city's bishop, it was sacked again in 479. It was restored in the late 5th and early 6th centuries. In the late 6th century the city suffered successive attacks by <a href="Slavic%20peoples">Slavic</a> tribes and was gradually abandoned.

In the 6th and 7th centuries, the region around Bitola experienced a demographic shift as more and more Slavic tribes settled in the area. In place of the deserted theater, several houses were built during that time. The Slavs also built a fortress around their settlement. Bitola became a part of the <a href="First%20Bulgarian%20Empire">First Bulgarian Empire</a> from late in the 8th to early 11th centuries. The spread of Christianity was assisted by St. <a href="Clement%20of%20Ohrid">Clement of Ohrid</a> and <a href="Naum%20of%20Preslav">Naum of Preslav</a> in the 9th and early 10th centuries. Many monasteries and churches were built in the city.

In the 10th century, Bitola was under the rule of the Bulgarian Tsar Samuil. He built a castle in the town, later used by his successor <a href="Gavril%20Radomir%20of%20Bulgaria">Gavril Radomir of Bulgaria</a>. The town is mentioned in several medieval sources. <a href="John%20Skylitzes">John Skylitzes</a>'s 11th-century chronicle mentions that Emperor <a href="Basil%20II">Basil II</a> burned Gavril's castles in Bitola, when passing through and ravaging Pelagonia. The second <a href="chrysobull">chrysobull</a> (1019) of Basil II mentioned that the Bishop of Bitola depended on the <a href="Orthodox%20Archbishopric%20of%20Ohrid%20%28ancient%29">Archbishopric of Ohrid</a>. During the reign of Samuil, the city was an important centre in the Bulgarian state and the seat of the Bitola Bishopric. In many medieval sources, especially Western, the name "Pelagonia" was synonymous with the Bitola Bishopric, and in some of them Bitola was known under the name of Heraclea due to the church tradition that turned the Heraclea Bishopric into the Pelagonian Metropolitan's Diocese. In 1015, Tsar Gavril Radomir was killed by his cousin <a href="Ivan%20Vladislav%20of%20Bulgaria">Ivan Vladislav</a>, who declared himself tsar and rebuilt the city fortress. To celebrate the occasion, a <a href="Bitola%20inscription">stone inscription</a> written in the <a href="Cyrillic">Cyrillic</a> alphabet was set in the fortress; in it the Slavic name of the city is mentioned: Bitol.

Following battles with the Tsar Ivan Vladislav, Byzantine emperor <a href="Basil%20II">Basil II</a> recaptured Monastiri in 1015. The town is mentioned as an episcopal centre in 1019 in a record by Basil II. Two important uprisings against Byzantine rule took place in the Bitola area in 1040 and 1072. After the Bulgarian state was restored in the late 12th century, Bitola was incorporated under the rule of Tsar <a href="Kaloyan%20of%20Bulgaria">Kaloyan of Bulgaria</a>. It was conquered again by Byzantium at the end of the 13th century, but it became part of <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> in the first half of the 14th century, after the conquests of <a href="Stefan%20Du%C5%A1an">Stefan Dušan</a>.

As a military, political and cultural center, Bitola played a very important role in the life of the medieval society in the region, prior to the Ottoman conquest in the mid-14th century. On the eve of the Ottoman conquest, Bitola (Monastir in Ottoman Turkish) experienced great growth with its well-established trading links all over the Balkan Peninsula, especially with big economic centers like <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>, <a href="Thessalonica">Thessalonica</a>, <a href="Dubrovnik">Ragusa</a> and <a href="Veliko%20Tarnovo">Tarnovo</a>. Caravans of various goods moved to and from Bitola.

From 1382 to 1912, Manastır (now Bitola) was part of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. Fierce battles took place near the city during the arrival of Ottoman forces. Ottoman rule was completely established after the death of <a href="Prince%20Marko">Prince Marko</a> in 1395 when Ottoman Empire established the <a href="Sanjak%20of%20Ohrid">Sanjak of Ohrid</a> as a part of the <a href="Rumelia%20Eyalet">Rumelia Eyalet</a> and one of earliest established sanjaks in Europe. Before it became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1395 its initial territory belonged to the realm of <a href="Prince%20Marko">Prince Marko</a>. Initially its <a href="county%20town">county town</a> was Bitola and later it was <a href="Ohrid">Ohrid</a>, so it was initially sometimes referred to as Sanjak of Monastir or Sanjak of Bitola.

After the <a href="Ottoman%20wars%20in%20Europe">Austro-Ottoman wars</a>, the trade development and the overall thriving of the city was stifled. But in the late 19th century, it again it became the second-biggest city in the wider southern Balkan region after <a href="Salonica">Salonica</a>.

In 1874, Manastır became the center of <a href="Monastir%20Vilayet">Monastir Vilayet</a> which included the sanjaks of <a href="Sanjak%20of%20Dibra">Debra</a>, <a href="Servia%2C%20Greece">Serfidze</a>, <a href="Sanjak%20of%20Elbasan">Elbasan</a>, Manastır (Bitola), <a href="Kor%C3%A7%C3%AB">Görice</a> and towns of <a href="Kicevo">Kırcaova</a>, <a href="Prilep">Pirlepe</a>, <a href="Florina">Florina</a>, <a href="Kastoria">Kesriye</a> and <a href="Grevena">Grevena</a>.

Traditionally a strong trading center, Bitola is also known as "the city of the consuls". In the final period of the Ottoman rule (1878-1912), Bitola had consulates from twelve countries. During the same period, there were a number of prestigious schools in the city, including a military academy that, among others, was attended by the famous Turkish reformer <a href="Mustafa%20Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk">Mustafa Kemal Atatürk</a>. Bitola was also the headquarters of many cultural organizations that were established at that time.
There are opposing ethnographic data from that period, but it appears that no specific ethnic or religious group could claim an absolute majority of the population. According to the <a href="http%3A//www.univ.trieste.it/%7Estoria/corsi/Dogo/tabelle/popolaz-ottomana1911.jpg">1911 Ottoman census</a>, <a href="Greeks">Greeks</a> were the largest Christian population in the vilayet, with 740,000 Greeks, 517,000 Bulgarians and 1,061,000 Muslims in the vilayets of Selanik (Thessaloniki) and Manastır. However, it should be noted that the basis of the Ottoman censuses was the millet system. People were assigned an ethnicity according to their religion. So all Sunni Muslims were categorised as Turks, although many of them were <a href="Albanians">Albanians</a>, and all members of the Greek Orthodox church as Greeks, although their numbers included a vast majority of <a href="Aromanians">Aromanians</a>, South Albanians, and some Macedonian Slavs. The rest were divided between Bulgarian and Serb Orthodox churches.
Bitola’s population itself was very various. It numbered some 50,000 at the end of the 19th century. There were around 7,000 Aromanians most of whom fully embraced the Hellenist ideas, although many of them joined the Romanian idea. Bitola also had significant Muslim population - 11,000 (Turks, Roma, and Albanians) as well Jewish commununity - 5,200. The Slavic-speakers were divided between the Bulgarian Exarchate - 8,000, and the Greek Patriarchate - 6,300.

In 1894, Manastır was connected with <a href="Salonika">Selanik</a> by train. The first motion picture made in the Balkans was recorded by the <a href="Aromanians">Aromanian</a> <a href="Manakis%20brothers">Manakis brothers</a> in Manastır in 1903. In their honour, the annual Manaki Brothers International Film Camera Festival is held in modern Bitola.

In 1912, <a href="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>, <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>, <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> and <a href="Greece">Greece</a> fought the Ottomans in the <a href="First%20Balkan%20War">First Balkan War</a>. After victory <a href="Battle%20of%20Sarantaporo">at Sarantaporo</a>, Greek troops advanced towards Monastir but were defeated by the Ottomans <a href="Battle%20of%20Sorovich">at Sorovich</a>. The <a href="Battle%20of%20Monastir">Battle of Monastir</a> (16–19 November 1912) led to Serbian occupation. According to the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Bucharest%2C%201913">Treaty of Bucharest, 1913</a>, the region of Macedonia was divided into three parts between Greece, Serbia and Bulgaria, with Monastir ceded to Serbia, given the name "Bitola".

During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> Bitola was on the <a href="Salonica%20Front">Salonica Front</a>. Bulgaria, a <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Power</a>, took the city on 21 November 1915, while the Allied forces <a href="Monastir%20Offensive">recaptured it in 1916</a>. Bitola was divided into French, Russian, Italian and Serbian sections, under the command of French general <a href="Maurice%20Sarrail">Maurice Sarrail</a>. Until Bulgaria's surrender in late autumn 1918, Bitola remained a front line city and was almost daily bombarded by air and battery and suffered almost total destruction.

AT the end of World War I Bitola was restored to the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Kingdom of Serbia</a>, and, consequently, became part in 1918 of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed Yugoslavia in 1929. Bitola became one of the major cities of the <a href="Vardarska%20banovina">Vardarska banovina</a>.

During the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> (1941–45), the Germans (on 9 April 1941) and later Bulgarians (on 18 April 1941) took control of the city. But in September 1944, Bulgaria switched sides in the war and withdrew from Yugoslavia, and Bitola was freed by the <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Yugoslav Partisans</a>. On 4 November, the 7th Macedonian Liberation Brigade entered Bitola victoriously. A <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Monastir">historical Jewish community</a>, of Sephardic origin, lived in the city until World War II, when mostly were killed or migrated to the United States and Chile. After the end of the war, a Macedonian state was established for the first time in modern history, within Yugoslavia. This had cost about 25,000 human lives. In 1945, the first Gymnasium (named "<a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a>") to use the Macedonian language, was opened in Bitola.

The city has many historical building dating from many historical periods. The most notable ones are from the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman age</a>, but there are some from the more recent past.

Širok Sokak (, meaning "Wide Alley") is a long <a href="pedestrian%20street">pedestrian street</a> that runs from <a href="Magnolia%20Square">Magnolia Square</a> to the City Park.

It is unknown when Bitola's <a href="clock%20tower">clock tower</a> was built. Written sources from the 16th century mention a clock tower, but it is not clear if it is the same one. Some believe it was built at the same time as St. Dimitrija Church, in 1830. Legend says that the Ottoman authorities collected around 60,000 eggs from nearby villages and mixed them in the <a href="Mortar%20%28masonry%29">mortar</a> to make the walls stronger.

The tower has a rectangular base and is about 30 meters high. Near the top is a rectangular terrace with an iron fence. On each side of the fence is an iron console construction which holds the lamps for lighting the clock. The clock is on the highest of three levels. The original clock was replaced during World War II with a working one, given by the Nazis because the city had maintained German graves from World War I.
The massive tower is composed of walls, massive spiral stairs, wooden mezzanine constructions, <a href="pendentive">pendentive</a>s and the dome. During the construction of the tower, the façade was simultaneously decorated with simple stone plastic.

The Church of <a href="Saint%20Demetrius">Saint Demetrius</a> was built in 1830 with voluntary contributions of local merchants and craftsmen. It is plain on the outside, as all churches in the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> had to be, but of rare beauty inside, lavishly decorated with <a href="chandelier">chandelier</a>s, a carved bishop throne and an engraved <a href="iconostasis">iconostasis</a>. According to some theories, the iconostasis is a work of the <a href="Mijaks">Mijak</a> engravers. Its most impressive feature is the arc above the imperial quarters with modeled figures of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> and the apostles.

Other engraved wood items include the bishop's throne made in the spirit of Mijak engravers, several <a href="icon%20frames">icon frames</a> and five more-recent pillars shaped like thrones. The frescoes originate from two periods: the end of the 19th century, and the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> to the present. The icons and frescoes were created thanks to voluntary contributions of local businessmen and citizens. The authors of many of the icons had a vast knowledge of iconography schemes of the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>. The icons show a great sense of color, dominated by red, green and ochra shades. The abundance of golden ornaments is noticeable and points to the presence of <a href="late-Byzantine">late-Byzantine</a> artwork and <a href="baroque%20style">baroque style</a>. The icon of Saint Demetrius is signed with the initials "D. A. Z.", showing that it was made by iconographer Dimitar Andonov the <a href="zograph">zograph</a> in 1889. There are many other items, including the <a href="chalice">chalice</a>s made by local masters, a darohranilka of Russian origin, and several paintings of scenes from the New Testament, brought from Jerusalem by pilgrims.

The old <a href="bazaar">bazaar</a> (<a href="Macedonian%20language">Macedonian</a>: "Стара Чаршија") is mentioned in a description of the city from the 16th and the 17th centuries. The present <a href="bezisten">bezisten</a> does not differ much in appearance from the original one. The bezisten had eighty-six shops and four large iron gates. The shops used to sell textiles, and today sell food products.

The Deboj Bath is a <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Turkish</a> bath (<a href="Turkish%20bath">hamam</a>). It is not known when exactly it was constructed.
